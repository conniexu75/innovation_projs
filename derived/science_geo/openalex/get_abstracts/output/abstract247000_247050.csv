https://openalex.org/W2124248227,"The presence and function of CB 2 receptors in central nervous system (CNS) neurons are controversial. We report the expression of CB 2 receptor messenger RNA and protein localization on brainstem neurons. These functional CB 2 receptors in the brainstem were activated by a CB 2 receptor agonist, 2-arachidonoylglycerol, and by elevated endogenous levels of endocannabinoids, which also act at CB 1 receptors. CB 2 receptors represent an alternative site of action of endocannabinoids that opens the possibility of nonpsychotropic therapeutic interventions using enhanced endocannabinoid levels in localized brain areas."

We present a high-resolution genetic map of the human genome, based on statistical analyses of genetic variation data, and identify more than 25,000 recombination hotspots, together with motifs and sequence contexts that play a role in hotspot activity. Differences between the behavior of recombination rates over large (megabase) and small (kilobase) scales lead us to suggest a two-stage model for recombination in which hotspots are stochastic features, within a framework in which large-scale rates are constrained."
https://openalex.org/W2162306102,"Calorie restriction extends life span in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals. Here, we report that calorie restriction for either 3 or 12 months induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression and 3′,5′-cyclic guanosine monophosphate formation in various tissues of male mice. This was accompanied by mitochondrial biogenesis, with increased oxygen consumption and adenosine triphosphate production, and an enhanced expression of sirtuin 1. These effects were strongly attenuated in eNOS null-mutant mice. Thus, nitric oxide plays a fundamental role in the processes induced by calorie restriction and may be involved in the extension of life span in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2100657568,"Acetoxylation of ethylene to vinyl acetate (VA) was used to investigate the mechanism of the promotional effect of gold (Au) in a palladium (Pd)-Au alloy catalyst. The enhanced rates of VA formation for low Pd coverages relative to high Pd coverages on Au single-crystal surfaces demonstrate that the critical reaction site for VA synthesis consists of two noncontiguous, suitably spaced, Pd monomers. The role of Au is to isolate single Pd sites that facilitate the coupling of critical surface species to product, while inhibiting the formation of undesirable reaction by-products."

https://openalex.org/W1987312773,"Theoretical and laboratory research suggests that phenotypic plasticity can evolve under selection. However, evidence for its evolutionary potential from the wild is lacking. We present evidence from a Dutch population of great tits ( Parus major ) for variation in individual plasticity in the timing of reproduction, and we show that this variation is heritable. Selection favoring highly plastic individuals has intensified over a 32-year period. This temporal trend is concurrent with climate change causing a mismatch between the breeding times of the birds and their caterpillar prey. Continued selection on plasticity can act to alleviate this mismatch."
https://openalex.org/W2069774708,"The reduction of iron is an essential step in the transferrin (Tf) cycle, which is the dominant pathway for iron uptake by red blood cell precursors. A deficiency in iron acquisition by red blood cells leads to hypochromic, microcytic anemia. Using a positional cloning strategy, we identified a gene, six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 3 (Steap3), responsible for the iron deficiency anemia in the mouse mutant nm1054. Steap3 is expressed highly in hematopoietic tissues, colocalizes with the Tf cycle endosome and facilitates Tf-bound iron uptake. Steap3 shares homology with F(420)H(2):NADP(+) oxidoreductases found in archaea and bacteria, as well as with the yeast FRE family of metalloreductases. Overexpression of Steap3 stimulates the reduction of iron, and mice lacking Steap3 are deficient in erythroid ferrireductase activity. Taken together, these findings indicate that Steap3 is an endosomal ferrireductase required for efficient Tf-dependent iron uptake in erythroid cells."
https://openalex.org/W2091060631,We used fluorescence microscopy to measure global and local concentrations of 28 cytoskeletal and signaling proteins fused to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe . Native promoters controlled the expression of these functional YFP fusion proteins. Fluorescence measured by microscopy or flow cytometry was directly proportional to protein concentration measured by quantitative immunoblotting. Global cytoplasmic concentrations ranged from 0.04 (formin Cdc12p) to 63 micromolar (actin). Proteins concentrated up to 100 times in contractile rings and 7500 times in spindle pole bodies at certain times in the cell cycle. This approach can be used to measure the global and local concentrations of any fusion protein.
https://openalex.org/W2052609775,"Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is a methyltransferase that plays an important role in many biological processes through its ability to trimethylate lysine 27 in histone H3. Here, we show that Akt phosphorylates EZH2 at serine 21 and suppresses its methyltransferase activity by impeding EZH2 binding to histone H3, which results in a decrease of lysine 27 trimethylation and derepression of silenced genes. Our results imply that Akt regulates the methylation activity, through phosphorylation of EZH2, which may contribute to oncogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1963710629,"A proposed strategy to aid in controlling the growing burden of vector-borne disease is population replacement, in which a natural vector population is replaced by a population with a reduced capacity for disease transmission. An important component of such a strategy is the drive system, which serves to spread a desired genotype into the targeted field population. Endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria are potential transgene drivers, but infections do not naturally occur in some important mosquito vectors, notably Aedes aegypti . In this work, stable infections of w AlbB Wolbachia were established in A. aegypti and caused high rates of cytoplasmic incompatibility (that is, elimination of egg hatch). Laboratory cage tests demonstrated the ability of w AlbB to spread into an A. aegypti population after seeding of an uninfected population with infected females, reaching infection fixation within seven generations."

https://openalex.org/W2007669066,"Autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy is a rare congenital myopathy characterized by delayed motor milestones and muscular weakness. In 11 families affected by centronuclear myopathy, we identified recurrent and de novo missense mutations in the gene dynamin 2 (DNM2, 19p13.2), which encodes a protein involved in endocytosis and membrane trafficking, actin assembly and centrosome cohesion. The transfected mutants showed reduced labeling in the centrosome, suggesting that DNM2 mutations might cause centronuclear myopathy by interfering with centrosome function."
https://openalex.org/W1968665346,"Chronic inflammation has a pathological role in many common diseases and is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Here we assess the role of genetic variation in selenoprotein S (SEPS1, also called SELS or SELENOS), a gene involved in stress response in the endoplasmic reticulum and inflammation control. After resequencing SEPS1, we genotyped 13 SNPs in 522 individuals from 92 families. As inflammation biomarkers, we measured plasma levels of IL-6, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha. Bayesian quantitative trait nucleotide analysis identified associations between SEPS1 polymorphisms and all three proinflammatory cytokines. One promoter variant, -105G --> A, showed strong evidence for an association with each cytokine (multivariate P = 0.0000002). Functional analysis of this polymorphism showed that the A variant significantly impaired SEPS1 expression after exposure to endoplasmic reticulum stress agents (P = 0.00006). Furthermore, suppression of SEPS1 by short interfering RNA in macrophage cells increased the release of IL-6 and TNF-alpha. To investigate further the significance of the observed associations, we genotyped -105G --> A in 419 Mexican American individuals from 23 families for replication. This analysis confirmed a significant association with both TNF-alpha (P = 0.0049) and IL-1beta (P = 0.0101). These results provide a direct mechanistic link between SEPS1 and the production of inflammatory cytokines and suggest that SEPS1 has a role in mediating inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2106452970,"Mass spectrometric analysis of human plasma and urine revealed abundant nitrated derivatives of all principal unsaturated fatty acids. Nitrated palmitoleic, oleic, linoleic, linolenic, arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acids were detected in concert with their nitrohydroxy derivatives. Two nitroalkene derivatives of the most prevalent fatty acid, oleic acid, were synthesized (9- and 10-nitro-9-cis-octadecenoic acid; OA-NO2), structurally characterized and determined to be identical to OA-NO2 found in plasma, red cells, and urine of healthy humans. These regioisomers of OA-NO2 were quantified in clinical samples using 13C isotope dilution. Plasma free and esterified OA-NO2 concentrations were 619 ± 52 and 302 ± 369 nm, respectively, and packed red blood cell free and esterified OA-NO2 was 59 ± 11 and 155 ± 65 nm. The OA-NO2 concentration of blood is ∼50% greater than that of nitrated linoleic acid, with the combined free and esterified blood levels of these two fatty acid derivatives exceeding 1 μm. OA-NO2 is a potent ligand for peroxisome proliferator activated receptors at physiological concentrations. CV-1 cells co-transfected with the luciferase gene under peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) response element regulation, in concert with PPARγ, PPARα, or PPARδ expression plasmids, showed dose-dependent activation of all PPARs by OA-NO2. PPARγ showed the greatest response, with significant activation at 100 nm, while PPARα and PPARδ were activated at ∼300 nm OA-NO2. OA-NO2 also induced PPAR γ-dependent adipogenesis and deoxyglucose uptake in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes at a potency exceeding nitrolinoleic acid and rivaling synthetic thiazo-lidinediones. These data reveal that nitrated fatty acids comprise a class of nitric oxide-derived, receptor-dependent, cell signaling mediators that act within physiological concentration ranges.

These data reveal that nitrated fatty acids comprise a class of nitric oxide-derived, receptor-dependent, cell signaling mediators that act within physiological concentration ranges. The oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids converts lipids, otherwise serving as cellular metabolic precursors and structural components, into potent signaling molecules including prostaglandins, leukotrienes, isoprostanes, and hydroxy- and hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoates. These enzymatic and auto-catalytic oxidation reactions yield products that orchestrate immune responses, neurotransmission, and the regulation of cell growth. For example, prostaglandins are cyclooxygenase-derived lipid mediators that induce receptor-dependent regulation of inflammatory responses, vascular function, initiation of parturition, cell survival, and angiogenesis (1Smith W.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F181-F191PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the various isoprostane products of arachidonic acid auto-oxidation exert vasoconstrictive and pro-inflammatory signaling actions via receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms (2Montuschi P. Barnes P.J. Roberts L.J. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1791-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). A common element of these diverse lipid signaling reactions is that nitric oxide (.NO) 6The abbreviations used are: NOnitric oxideLNO2nitrated linoleic acidPPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorOA-NO2nitrated oleic acidONOO-peroxynitriteMPOmyeloperoxidaseHPLC ESI MS/MShigh performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometryMRMmultiple reaction monitoringCIDcollision-induced dissociationPPREPPAR response elementsDTPAdiethylenetriaminepentaacetateDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFBSfetal bovine serum. and other oxides of nitrogen significantly impact lipid mediator formation and bioactivities. nitric oxide nitrated linoleic acid peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor nitrated oleic acid peroxynitrite myeloperoxidase high performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry multiple reaction monitoring collision-induced dissociation PPAR response elements diethylenetriaminepentaacetate Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal bovine serum. The ability of .NO and .NO-derived species to oxidize, nitrosate, and nitrate biomolecules serves as the molecular basis for how .NO influences the synthesis and reactions of bioactive lipids (3Rubbo H.

FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1889-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Interactions between .NO and lipid oxidation pathways are multifaceted and inter-dependent. For example, .NO regulates both the catalytic activity and gene expression of prostaglandin H synthase (6Vidwans A.S. Uliasz T.F. Hewett J.A. Hewett S.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11533-11542Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Conversely, leukotriene products of lipoxygenases induce nitric-oxide synthase-2 expression and increase inflammatory .NO production (7Larfars G. Lantoine F. Devynck M.A. Palmblad J. Gyllenhammar H. Blood. 1999; 93: 1399-1405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The free radical reactivity of .NO lends an ability to inhibit the autocatalytic chain propagation reactions of lipid peroxyl radicals during membrane and lipoprotein oxidation (8Rubbo H. Radi R.

Of relevance, reactions between .NO-derived species, unsaturated fatty acids, and lipid oxidation intermediates yield a spectrum of fatty acid oxidation and nitration products (3Rubbo H. Radi R.

Herein, we report that nitroalkene derivatives of all principal unsaturated fatty acids are present in human blood and urine. Of the fatty acid content in red cells, linoleic acid and oleic acid comprise ∼8 and ∼18% of total, respectively (21Dodge J.T. Phillips G.B. J. Lipid Res. 1967; 8: 667-675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Due to its prevalence and structural simplicity, oleic acid was evaluated as a potential candidate for nitration. The synthesis, structural characterization, and cell signaling activities of 9- and 10-nitro-9-cis-octadecaenoic acids are described (nitrated oleic acid, OA-NO2; Fig. 1). OA-NO2 regioisomers were measured in human blood and urine at levels exceeding those of LNO2. Furthermore, OA-NO2 activates PPARγ with a greater potency than LNO2. These data reveal that nitrated unsaturated fatty acids represent a class of lipid-derived, receptor-dependent signaling mediators. Materials—9-Octadecenoic acid (oleic acid) was purchased from Nu-Check Prep (Elysian, MN). [13C18]Oleic acid (>98% isotopic purity) was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. (Andover, MA). OA-NO2 and [13C18]OA-NO2 were synthesized as described below. Phenylselenium bromide, HgCl2, NaNO2, anhydrous tetrahy-drofuran (THF), CH3CN, CDCl3, insulin, dexamethasone, and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine were obtained from Sigma. Peroxynitrite (ONOO-) was prepared as described (22Koppenol W.H. Kissner R. Beckman J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 296-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Silica gel G and HF thin layer chromatography plates (250 and 2000 μm) were from Analtech (New-ark, DE). Methanolic BF3, horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit IgG, and Coomasie Blue were from Pierce. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) derived from human polymorphonuclear leukocytes was obtained from Calbiochem. Synthetic solvents were of HPLC grade or better from Fisher Scientific. Solvents used for extractions and mass spectrometric analyses were from Burdick and Jackson (Muskegon, MI). Anti-PPARγ and anti-β-actin antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-aP2 antibody was from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA). Synthesis of OA-NO2—Oleic acid and [13C18]oleic acid were nitrated as described (9Baker P.R. Schopfer F.J. Sweeney S. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11577-11582Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 12Lim D.G. Sweeney S. Bloodsworth A. White C.R. Chumley P.H. Krishna N.R. Schopfer F. O'Donnell V.B. Eiserich J.P. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15941-15946Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), with modifications. Oleic acid, HgCl2, phenylselenium bromide, and NaNO2 (1:1.3:1:1, mol/mol) were combined in THF/acetonitrile (1:1, v/v) with a final concentration of 0.15 m oleic acid. The reaction mixture was stirred (4 h, 25 °C), followed by centrifugation to sediment the precipitate. The supernatant was recovered, the solvent evaporated in vacuo, the product mixture redissolved in THF (original volume), and the temperature reduced to 0 °C. A 10-fold molar excess of H2O2 was slowly added with stirring to the mixture, which was allowed to react in an ice bath for 20 min followed by a gradual warming to room temp (45 min). The product mixture was extracted with hexane, the organic phase collected, the solvent removed in vacuo, and lipid products solvated in CH3OH. OA-NO2 was isolated by preparative TLC using silica gel HF plates developed twice in a solvent system consisting of hexane/ether/acetic acid (70:30:1, v/v). The region of silica containing OA-NO2 was scraped and extracted (23Bligh E.G. Dyer W.L. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). Based on this synthetic rationale, two regioisomers are generated: 9- and 10-nitro-9-cis-octadecenoic acids (generically termed OA-NO2). Preparative TLC does not adequately resolve the two isomers. [13C18]OA-NO2 was synthesized using [13C18]oleic acid as a reactant. All nitrated fatty acid stock solutions were diluted in MeOH, aliquoted, and stored under argon gas at -80 °C. Under these conditions, OA-NO2 isomers remain stable for >3 months. The nitroalkene positional isomers are described as cis throughout this article based on the configuration of the carbon skeleton, which correlates the cis alkene stereochemistry in the nitroalkenes with the corresponding cis alkene stereochemistry in naturally occurring oleic acid. The IUPAC nomenclature of the nitroalkenes has the opposite stereochemical terminology, because it focuses on the relationship of the higher priority nitro group to the carbon substituents on the alkene. For example, the 9-nitro isomer has the carbon chains cis to each other on the nitroalkene, but the official IUPAC nomenclature designates this compound as E (or trans) because the nitro group on C-9 and the carbon chain on C-10 have the E (entgegen) or trans relationship to each other. Quantitation of Synthetic OA-NO2—The concentrations of synthetic OA-NO2 stock solutions were determined using chemiluminescent nitrogen analysis (Antek Instruments, Houston, TX), a quantitative measure of nitrogen content in synthetic and biological samples (24Deng Y. Wu J.T. Zhang H. Olah T.V. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2004; 18: 1681-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 25Pai T.G. Payne W.J. LeGall J. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified synthetic nitroalkene preparations were subjected to complete pyrolysis (>1000 °C). The nitrogen-containing OA-NO2 reacts with O2 to ultimately yield .NO at a ratio of one mole .NO for every mole of nitrogen present in OA-NO2. The generated .NO reacts with O3 to yield nitrogen dioxide (.NO2,O2, and hv, the latter of which is sensitively detected with a photomultiplier). Concentrations were calculated using caffeine as standard. Stability of OA-NO2 and LNO2—The relative stabilities of OA-NO2 and LNO2 in MeOH and phosphate buffer (100 mm KiPO4 containing 100 μm DTPA, pH 7.4) were determined by electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (ESI MS/MS) using the quantitative methodology detailed below. OA-NO2 and LNO2 (3 μm each) were incubated at 37 °C in either MeOH or phosphate buffer, and aliquots were taken over time. The aliquots were extracted as described (23Bligh E.G. Dyer W.L. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar), with 1 μm [13C18]LNO2 added during the monophase stage of the extraction procedure as an internal standard, and analyzed for non-degraded OA-NO2 and LNO2. In aqueous buffer, nitrated lipids degrade more rapidly than in organic solvents (20Schopfer F.J. Baker P.R. Giles G. Chumley P. Batthyany C. Crawford J. Patel R.P. Hogg N. Branchaud B.P. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19289-19297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar); thus, their stability in phosphate buffer was measured over 2 h. The stability of nitrated fatty acids solvated in MeOH at 37 °C was measured over the course of 1 month. OA-NO2 Spectrophotometric Characterization—OA-NO2 stock solution concentrations derived from chemiluminescent nitrogen analysis were utilized to determine dilution concentrations for subsequent spectral analysis. An absorbance spectrum of OA-NO2 from 200-450 nm was generated using 23 μm OA-NO2 in phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.4) containing 100 μm DTPA. The extinction coefficients (ϵ) for OA-NO2 and the isotopic derivative [13C18]OA-NO2 were measured (λ270) using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). Absorbance values for increasing concentrations of OA-NO2 and [13C18]OA-NO2 were plotted against concentration to calculate ϵ. NMR Spectrometric Analysis of OA-NO2—1H and 13C NMR spectra were acquired using a Varian INOVA 300 and a 500 MHz NMR and recorded in CDCl3. Chemical shifts are in δ units (ppm) and referenced to residual proton (7.26 ppm) or carbon (77.28 ppm) signals in deuterated chloroform. Coupling constants (J) are reported in Hertz (Hz). Structural Characterization of OA-NO2 by ESI MS/MS—Qualitative analysis of OA-NO2 by ESI MS/MS was performed using a hybrid triple quadrupole-linear ion trap mass spectrometer (4000 Q trap, Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex). To characterize synthetic and endogenous OA-NO2, a reverse-phase HPLC methodology was developed using a 150 × 2 mm C18 Phenomenex Luna column (3 μm particle size). Lipids were separated and eluted from the column using a gradient solvent system consisting of A (H2O containing 0.1% NH4OH) and B (CNCH3 containing 0.1% NH4OH) under the following conditions: 20-65% B (10 min); 65-95% B (1 min; hold for 3 min) and 95-20% B (1 min; hold for 3 min). OA-NO2 was detected using a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) scan mode by reporting molecules that undergo a m/z 326/279 mass transition consistent with the loss of the nitro group ([M - (HNO2)]-). Concurrent with MRM determination, enhanced product ion analysis (EPI) was performed to generate characteristic and identifying fragmentation patterns of eluting species with a precursor mass of m/z 326. Zero grade air was used as source gas, and nitrogen was used in the collision chamber. Red Blood Cell Isolation and Lipid Extraction—Peripheral blood from fasting, apparently healthy human volunteers was collected by venipuncture into heparinized tubes (UAB Institutional Review Board-approved protocol no. X040311001). Blood was centrifuged (1200 × g; 10 min), the buffy coat was removed, and erythrocytes were isolated. Lipid extracts were prepared from red cells and plasma and directly analyzed by mass spectrometry (23Bligh E.G. Dyer W.L. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). Care was taken to avoid acidification during extraction to prevent artifactual lipid nitration due to the presence of endogenous nitrite (9Baker P.R. Schopfer F.J. Sweeney S. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11577-11582Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In experiments using urine as the biological specimen (UAB Institutional Review Board-approved protocol no. X040311003), extraction conditions were identical. Detection and Quantitation of OA-NO2 in Human Blood and Urine—Quantitation of OA-NO2 in biological samples was performed as described (9Baker P.R. Schopfer F.J. Sweeney S. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11577-11582Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), with modifications. Matched blood and urine samples were obtained after >8 h fasting; urine was collected from the first void of the day. During the monophase stage of the lipid extraction (23Bligh E.G. Dyer W.L. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar), [13C18]OA-NO2 was added as internal standard to correct for any losses. Nitrated fatty acids were then analyzed by HPLC ESI MS/MS in the negative ion mode. Lipids were eluted from the HPLC column using an isocratic solvent system consisting of CH3CN:H2O:NH4OH (85:15:0.1, v/v) so that the two OA-NO2 regioisomers co-elute. During quantitative analyses, two MRM transitions were monitored: m/z 326/279 (OA-NO2) and m/z 344/297 ([13C18]OA-NO2), transitions consistent with the loss of the nitro group from the respective precursor ions. The areas under each peak were integrated, the ratios of analyte to internal standard areas were determined, and OA-NO2 was quantitated using Analyst 1.4 quantitation software (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex). Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. (n = 10; 5 female and 5 male). To address whether artifactual synthesis of OA-NO2 occurred during sample preparation and extraction, control studies were performed as described (9Baker P.R. Schopfer F.J. Sweeney S. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11577-11582Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Briefly, [13C18]oleic acid was added as a reporter molecule prior to red cell and plasma lipid purification and analysis, which permitted the MS detection of possible 13C-labeled OA-NO2 formation. Also, 200 μm NO2- was included in initial lipid extractions to determine whether separations or analysis-induced nitration reactions might be supported by physiological NO2- levels that can exceed 200 nm (14Rassaf T. Bryan N.S. Kelm M. Feelisch M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1590-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 15Rassaf T. Bryan N.S. Maloney R.E. Specian V. Kelm M. Kalyanaraman B. Rodriguez J. Feelisch M. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 481-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In no case did we detect artifactual nitration of oleic acid due to sample processing and analysis. Qualitative Analysis of Nitro and Nitrohydroxy Adducts of Fatty Acids—Using HPLC ESI MS/MS in the negative ion mode, blood and urine samples were evaluated for the presence of nitroalkene derivatives other than LNO2. HPLC separations using the qualitative gradient elution methodology were performed similarly to those used to characterize OA-NO2, with some modifications. Alternative MRM transitions were used to detect other potential nitroalkene derivatives. Theoretical MRM transitions were determined for the CID-induced loss of the nitro group from nitrated palmitoleic (16:1-NO2), linolenic (18:3-NO2), arachidonic (20:4-NO2), and eicosapentaenoic (20:5-NO2) acids. MRM transitions for nitrohydroxy adducts were also monitored: 16:1(OH)-NO2; 18:1(OH)-NO2; 18:2(OH)-NO2; 18:3(OH)-NO2, 20:4(OH)-NO2, and 20:5(OH)-NO2. In Vitro Formation of OA-NO2—Three different conditions were examined for an ability to induce nitration of oleic acid: acidic nitration, treatment with peroxynitrite, and treatment with MPO in the presence of H2O2 and nitrite. Briefly, for acidic nitration, oleic acid (1 mm) and sodium nitrite (100 μm) were prepared in phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.2) in the presence of 2% sodium cholate (26O'Donnell V.B. Eiserich J.P. Chumley P.H. Jablonsky M.J. Krishna N.R. Kirk M. Barnes S. Darley-Usmar V.M. Freeman B.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The pH was adjusted to 3.0, and the reaction mixture was incubated with stirring (40 min; 25 °C). The reaction was stopped by solvent extraction, and OA-NO2 levels were measured by HPLC ESI MS/MS. For peroxynitrite-induced nitration, oleic acid (1 mm) was suspended in phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.2), and ONOO- was infused via syringe pump into a stirred chamber (100 μm/min; 15 min) (26O'Donnell V.B. Eiserich J.P. Chumley P.H. Jablonsky M.J. Krishna N.R. Kirk M. Barnes S. Darley-Usmar V.M. Freeman B.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Decayed ONOO- (pH 7.4, 10 min) was added as a control. Products were extracted and analyzed for OA-NO2. For MPO-induced nitration, oleic acid (1 mm) was incubated in phosphate buffer (100 mm; pH 7.2) in the presence of MPO (50 nm), sodium nitrite (100 μm), and hydrogen peroxide (100 μm) as described (27Eiserich J.P. Baldus S. Brennan M.L. Ma W. Zhang C. Tousson A. Castro L. Lusis A.J. Nauseef W.M. White C.R. Freeman B.A. Science. 2002; 296: 2391-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). The reaction proceeded for 90 min with additional aliquots of hydrogen peroxide added at 30-min intervals. The reaction was stopped by lipid extraction, and OA-NO2 was measured by HPLC ESI MS/MS. Significance of difference between treated and control groups was determined using a one-tailed, paired Student's t test. PPAR Transient Transfection Assay—CV-1 cells from the ATCC (Manassas, VA) were grown to ∼85% confluence in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Twelve hours before transfection, the medium was removed and replaced with anti-biotic-free medium. Cells were transiently co-transfected with a plasmid containing the luciferase gene under the control of three tandem PPAR response elements (PPRE) (PPRE × 3 TK-luciferase and PPARγ, PPARα, or PPARδ expression plasmids, respectively (provided by Ron Evans, Salk Institute). In all cases, a green fluorescence protein (GFP) expression plasmid was co-transfected as the control for transfection efficiency. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were returned to Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) for 24 h and then treated as indicated for another 24 h. Reporter luciferase assay kits from Promega (Madison, WI) were used to measure the luciferase activity according to the manufacturer's instructions with a luminometer (Victor II, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Luciferase activity was normalized by GFP units. Each condition was performed in triplicate for each experiment (n ≥ 3). 3T3-L1 Differentiation and Oil Red O Staining—3T3-L1 preadipocytes were propagated and maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS. To induce differentiation, 2-day post-confluent preadipocytes (designated day 0) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS plus 1 and 3 μm OA-NO2 for 14 days. The medium was changed every 2 days. Rosiglitazone (3 μm) and oleic acid (3 μm) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Differentiated adipocytes were stained with oil red O as described previously (28Zhang J. Fu M. Cui T. Xiong C. Xu K. Zhong W. Xiao Y. Floyd D. Liang J. Li E. Song Q. Chen Y.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10703-10708Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). [3H]2-Deoxy-d-Glucose Uptake Assay in Differentiated 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—[3H]2-Deoxy-d-glucose uptake was analyzed as described previously (29Mukherjee R. Hoener P.A. Jow L. Bilakovics J. Klausing K.

To clarify the mechanism of DJ-1 protection, we have overexpressed the gene in cultured dopaminergic cells that were then subjected to chemical stress. In the rat dopaminergic cell line, N27, and in primary dopamine neurons, overexpression of wild type DJ-1 protected cells from death induced by hydrogen peroxide and 6-hydroxydopamine. Overexpressing the L166P mutant DJ-1 had no protective effect. By contrast, knocking down endogenous DJ-1 with antisense DJ-1 rendered cells more susceptible to oxidative damage. We have found that DJ-1 improves survival by increasing cellular glutathione levels through an increase in the rate-limiting enzyme glutamate cysteine ligase. Blocking glutathione synthesis eliminated the beneficial effect of DJ-1. Protection could be restored by adding exogenous glutathione. Wild type DJ-1 reduced cellular reactive oxygen species and reduced the levels of protein oxidation caused by oxidative stress. By a separate mechanism, overexpressing wild type DJ-1 inhibited the protein aggregation and cytotoxicity usually caused by A53T human α-synuclein. Under these circumstances, DJ-1 increased the level of heat shock protein 70 but did not change the glutathione level. Our data indicate that DJ-1 protects dopaminergic neurons from oxidative stress through up-regulation of glutathione synthesis and from the toxic consequences of mutant humanα-synuclein through increased expression of heat shock protein 70.

In recent years, several genes linked to PD have been discovered. α-Synuclein was the first gene identified whose mutations, A53T and A30P, cause autosomal dominant forms of PD (4Polymeropoulos M.H.

Importantly, aggregated α-synuclein has been found to be a major component of Lewy bodies (6Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (6111) Google Scholar). Mutations in a second gene, Parkin, cause early onset PD with autosomal recessive inheritance (7Kitada T. Asakawa S.

DJ-1 interacts with H-ras to increase cell transformation (13Nagakubo D. Taira T. Kitaura H. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). DJ-1 is a regulatory subunit of an RNA-binding protein complex (14Hod Y. Pentyala S.N. Whyard T.C. El-Maghrabi M.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Through binding to PIASxα, the transcriptional inhibitor of androgen receptor, DJ-1 can positively regulate transcription of the androgen receptor (15Takahashi K. Taira T. Niki T. Seino C.

Of most interest, DJ-1 has been identified as a hydroperoxide-responsive protein that becomes more acidic following oxidative stress, suggesting that it may function as an antioxidant protein (16Mitsumoto A.

To study the role of DJ-1 protein in dopaminergic cells, we have overexpressed wild type (WT) DJ-1 and L166P mutant DJ-1 in a rat dopaminergic cell line (N27 cells) and in rat dopamine neurons from embryonic mesencephalic cultures (18Zhou W. Hurlbert M.S. Schaack J. Prasad K.N. Freed C.R. Brain Res. 2000; 866: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 19Zhou W. Freed C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10128-10135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Our results show that overexpression of WT DJ-1 can protect dopamine neurons from oxidative stress, whereas knockdown of endogenous DJ-1 renders cells more susceptible to oxidative damage. We have found that DJ-1 protects cells from oxidative stress by up-regulating cellular GSH levels. By a separate mechanism, overexpression of WT DJ-1 inhibits A53T human α-synuclein toxicity through up-regulation of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70). cDNA Cloning, Mutagenesis, and Adenovirus Construction—The human wild type DJ-1 cDNA was amplified by PCR from an expressed sequence tag clone. The point mutation to produce L166P was performed using a PCR-based mutagenesis. To knock down rat endogenous DJ-1 protein, we designed and screened small interfering RNA to rat DJ-1 using a small interfering RNA Target Finder program (genscript.com). A 75-bp synthesized DNA fragment encoding DJ-1 small interfering RNA was cloned into the same vector as WT DJ-1 (termed as antisense DJ-1, “AS DJ-1”). All of the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. We used the Ad-Easy system to create adenoviruses expressing human WT DJ-1, human L166P DJ-1, and rat AS DJ-1. We have previously described the creation of adenoviruses expressing WT and A53T human α-synuclein (18Zhou W. Hurlbert M.S. Schaack J. Prasad K.N. Freed C.R.

N27 Cell Culture, Adenovirus Transduction, and Drug Treatments—Cells from the dopaminergic cell line N27 were cultured in 24-well plates in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamate, and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (18Zhou W. Hurlbert M.S. Schaack J. Prasad K.N. Freed C.R. Brain Res. 2000; 866: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 19Zhou W. Freed C.R. J. Biol.

To transduce cells, adenoviruses at a concentration of 200 plaque-forming units (pfu)/cell were mixed with medium and added to cultures for 24 h. Under these conditions, more than 80% of cells expressed transgene 24 h later. For α-synuclein plus DJ-1 co-transduction, each adenovirus was used at 200 pfu/cell. Two days after adenovirus transduction, the cells were incubated with drugs at various doses for 24 h: H2O2 (25–100 μm; Sigma), 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA, 10–80 μm; RBI), and proteasome inhibitor lactacystin (0.1–1.0 μm; Sigma). Cell Viability by MTT Assay—Twenty-four hours after drug treatment, MTT (Sigma) was added to culture medium (final concentration at 0.4 mg/ml) and incubated for 2 h. Culture medium was removed, and precipitates were dissolved in 0.04 m HCl in isopropanol. Cell viability was measured by spectrometry at A590 as described (18Zhou W. Hurlbert M.S. Schaack J.

Primary Rat Mesencephalic Culture, Adenovirus Transduction, and Drug Treatments—Rat ventral mesencephalon from embryonic day 15 was mechanically dissociated and cultured in 24-well plates in F12 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamate, and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (18Zhou W. Hurlbert M.S. Schaack J. Prasad K.N. Freed C.R. Brain Res. 2000; 866: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Two days later, adenoviruses were used to transduce cells at a concentration of 400 pfu/cell. Because AS DJ-1 transduced cells could not be imaged with antibodies to DJ-1, the reporter construct GFP adenovirus at 200 pfu/cell was always co-transduced with AS DJ-1 adenovirus. Control cells were transduced with GFP adenovirus at 200 pfu/cell. Adenoviruses were incubated in culture medium for 2 days. Three days after adenovirus transduction, the cells were exposed to drugs at three doses for 24 h: H2O2 (0, 50, and 100 μm), 6-OHDA (0, 50, and 100 μm), dopamine (0, 50 and 100 μm), and lactacystin (0, 0.5, and 1.0 μm). Immunocytochemistry—N27 cells and rat primary cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and processed for immunocytochemistry as described (18Zhou W. Hurlbert M.S. Schaack J. Prasad K.N. Freed C.R. Brain Res. 2000; 866: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 19Zhou W. Freed C.R. J. Biol.

The antibodies included mouse anti-human DJ-1 (1:500; Stressgen); rabbit anti-DJ-1 (recognizes both human and rat DJ-1, 1:300; Chemicon); mouse anti-α-synuclein (1:500; Transduction Laboratory); rabbit anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; 1:150; Pel Freez). Green fluorescence (fluorescein isothiocyanate) and Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies were used for double labeling of cells. Apoptosis in Primary Dopamine Neurons—Following DJ-1/TH or GFP/TH dual immunostaining, the cells were stained with nuclear dye Hoechst 33258 (10 μg/ml; Molecular Probes). We examined transduced dopamine neurons (i.e. DJ-1/TH or GFP/TH dual positive cells) and identified apoptotic cells with nuclear condensation or fragmentation. Approximately 150–200 transduced dopamine cells from three wells were assessed for each condition, and the rates of apoptosis were determined. The experiments were repeated three times for each condition. Measurement of GSH Levels—N27 cells were scraped and collected by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of PBS containing 1 mm EDTA and homogenized. The supernatant was deproteinated by 10% metaphosphoric acid (Sigma) and collected for determining total GSH levels according to the manufacturer's protocol (glutathione assay kit; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). A duplicate culture with the same treatments was used to determine the total cell number by MTT assay. The total GSH levels were expressed as nmol/mg of protein and then as the percentage of control. Inhibition of GSH Synthesis and Treatment with Exogenous GSH—GSH is synthesized by glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) and glutathione synthetase (GS). Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) is an irreversible inhibitor of GCL. To deplete intracellular glutathione, N27 cells were pretreated with 200 μm BSO (Sigma) for 24 h before adenovirus transduction. BSO was maintained during and after adenovirus transduction until GSH assay. To test whether exogenous GSH could reverse BSO inhibition of DJ-1 function, GSH (100 μm; Sigma) was added to culture medium during the adenoviral transduction. GSH Synthesis Enzyme Activity Assays—N27 cells were collected, homogenized, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The GCL and GS enzyme activities were determined by the formation of ADP using a coupled assay with pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. The GCL reaction mixture (final volume, 200 μl) contained 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.2), 20 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm l-glutamate, 10 mm l-cysteine, 5 mm ATP, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm NADH, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 2 units of pyruvate kinase, and 2 units of lactate dehydrogenase. The GS reaction mixture contained 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.2), 20 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm ATP, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm glycine, 5 mm l-γ-glutamyl-l-α-aminobutyrate, 0.2 mm NADH, 0.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 2 units of pyruvate kinase, and 2 units of lactate dehydrogenase. The reaction was initiated by adding 100 μg of protein extract, and the absorbance at 340 nm was monitored. The specific activity is expressed as units/mg of protein and then as a percentage of control. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR Analysis—We used semi-quantitative RT-PCR to determine the mRNA levels of GCL, GS, and Hsp70. Total RNA was isolated from cultures using TriZOL reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. One μg of total RNA was used to synthesize first strand cDNA in 20 μl of reaction with a RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). For each 50 μl of PCR, 2 μl of cDNA was used with gene-specific primers (primer sequences available upon request). PCR conditions were optimized, and linear amplification range was determined for each primer pair by varying annealing temperature and cycle numbers. We also amplified β-actin as an internal control. Ten μl of PCR product was separated on 1.2% agarose gel, and the image density was analyzed using Image J software. The levels of mRNAs were expressed as the ratios to β-actin and then as the percentages of control. Measurement of Intracellular ROS Levels—Intracellular ROS levels were measured by flow cytometry in cells loaded with the redox-sensitive dye DCFH-DA (Molecular Probes). Approximately 1 × 106 N27 cells were incubated in the dark for 30 min at 37 °C with 10 μm DCFH-DA, harvested, and resuspended in the PBS. Fluorescence was recorded on FL-1 channel of FACScan® (Becton Dickinson). Western Blotting—The cells were incubated in a lysis buffer (0.5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4) for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g, and the supernatants were collected. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA method. Fifty μg of total protein was separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gel and processed for Western blotting using the following antibodies: mouse anti-human DJ-1 (1:4,000; Stressgen), rabbit anti-pan DJ-1 (1:5,000; Chemicon), mouse anti-α-synuclein (1:4,000; Transduction Laboratories), rabbit anti-Hsp70 (1:3,000; Chemicon), and mouse anti-β-actin (1:5000; Chemicon). The Western blotting was detected with a chemiluminescent detection kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Detection of Protein Carbonyls—The cells were collected by scraping, and the proteins were lysed in lysis buffer. Soluble protein was used to determine protein carbonyls by the Oxyblot protein oxidation kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Chemicon). Briefly, 10 μg (per 10 μl) of soluble protein was incubated for 15 min with an equal volume of 12% SDS and 2 volumes of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) and then with 1.5 volumes of neutralization solution to stop the reaction. The samples were spotted on nitrocellulose membrane, dried, and cross-linked with UV cross-linker (Stratagene). The membranes were incubated with blocking buffer (PBS with 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% sodium azide, and 0.2% Tween 20) for 30 min at room temperature, exposed to rabbit anti-DNPH protein antibody (1:4000) for 1 h, followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed after each step in PBS with 0.2% Tween 20 and visualized with a chemiluminescent detection kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Dot blots were scanned, and the intensities of the dots were quantified with NIH Image J by measuring density in a preset circle of the same size. To confirm equal protein loading for dot blots, the same amount of protein (10 μg) was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting using anti-β-actin antibody (1:5000; Chemicon). Statistics—All of the experiments were repeated at least three times. The data were analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance and the Fisher LSD post hoc test. Significance was set at p < 0.05. The values are shown as the means ± S.E. Overexpression of Human DJ-1 Protects N27 Cells from Oxidative Stress—We used adenoviral vectors to induce DJ-1 overexpression in N27 cells. Two days after adenovirus transduction, more than 80% of cells had strong expression of human DJ-1 in cytoplasm (Fig. 1, A and B). Cells transduced with L166P DJ-1 had weaker expression of human DJ-1 compared with WT DJ-1 (Fig. 1C). Using a pan DJ-1 antibody to detect both human and endogenous rat DJ-1, we found endogenous expression of rat DJ-1 in untransduced N27 cells (control; Fig. 1D). After transduction with human WT DJ-1, the expression of total DJ-1 was significantly enhanced (Fig. 1E). By contrast, the expression of total DJ-1 was significantly reduced in N27 cells transduced with AS DJ-1 (Fig. 1F), indicating the successful knockdown of endogenous rat DJ-1. We used Western blotting to confirm the expression levels of human DJ-1 as well as total DJ-1 in N27 cells (Fig. 1G). Quantitative data show that cells transduced with human WT DJ-1 had about four times the total DJ-1 of control cells, whereas cells transduced with L166P DJ-1 had twice the levels of control. Knockdown of endogenous DJ-1 with AS DJ-1 produced levels that were 20% of control (Fig. 1H). We analyzed cell viability in N27 cells that had been transduced with WT DJ-1, L166P DJ-1, and AS DJ-1 for 2 days and treated with H2O2, 6-OHDA, and lactacystin for 24 h. We found that cells overexpressing WT DJ-1 had significantly better cell viability than untransduced control or GFP-transduced cells after oxidative treatments (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01, n = 12; Fig. 1, I and J). This protective effect was not present in L166P DJ-1 transduced cells (p > 0.1 compared with control, n = 12). Reducing endogenous DJ-1 with AS DJ-1 led to significantly worse cell viability than control (*, p < 0.05, n = 12), indicating that endogenous DJ-1 protects against oxidative stress. Overexpression of WT DJ-1 did not protect N27 cells against cell toxicity caused by the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin (data not shown), indicating that the action of DJ-1 has some metabolic specificity. Expression of WT DJ-1 Protects Rat Primary Dopamine Neurons from Oxidative Stress—Embryonic rat mesencephalic cultures were transduced with adenovirus containing WT DJ-1, L166P DJ-1, or AS DJ-1 for 3 days, followed by treatment with H2O2, 6-OHDA, and lactacystin for 24 h. About 25–30% of total cells were positive for DJ-1 after immunostaining with human DJ-1 antibody in WT and L166P DJ-1 transduced cultures (Fig. 2, A and B). There were very few DJ-1 positive cells in AS DJ-1 transduced cultures (Fig. 2C). In transduced dopamine neurons (i.e. DJ-1/TH or GFP/TH double-labeled cells), we found that overexpression of WT DJ-1 protected cells from apoptosis induced by oxidative stress (Fig. 2, D–F), whereas L166P DJ-1 did not protect (Fig. 2, G–I). Using Western blotting with human DJ-1 and pan DJ-1 antibodies, we confirmed overexpression of human WT DJ-1 and the knockdown of rat endogenous DJ-1 (Fig. 2, J and K). We analyzed apoptotic cell death in dopamine neurons. Quantitative data show that dopamine cells transduced with WT DJ-1 had significantly fewer apoptotic cells after oxidative stress than did control cultures (*, p < 0.05, n = 12; Fig. 2, L and M). In contrast, knocking down endogenous DJ-1 with AS DJ-1 led to significantly more apoptotic dopamine cells than seen in control cultures treated with oxidizing agents (*, p < 0.05, n = 12; Fig. 2, L and M). As we found with N27 cells, cell toxicity caused by the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin was not prevented by overexpression of WT DJ-1 (data not shown). DJ-1 Protects N27 Cells against Oxidative Damage by Up-regulating Intracellular GSH Levels—Because overexpression of WT DJ-1 can protect dopaminergic cells from oxidative stress, we measured the intracellular levels of the reducing agent GSH in N27 cells with or without 24 h of exposure to 50 μm H2O2. Without H2O2 treatment, there were no significant differences in GSH levels between cells overexpressing DJ-1 and control cells (p > 0.1, n = 9; Fig. 3A). With H2O2 treatment, we found that control cells showed a fall in GSH levels, whereas cells overexpressing WT DJ-1 could sustain normal GSH concentrations (*, p < 0.05, n = 9; Fig. 3A). Cells overexpressing AS DJ-1 had levels of GSH that were even lower than controls (*, p < 0.05, n = 9; Fig. 3A). Cell viability was directly linked to GSH levels with WT DJ-1 treated cells having significantly greater viability than control or AS DJ-1 treated cells (*, p < 0.05, n = 9; Fig. 3B). Blocking GSH synthesis with BSO significantly reduced intracellular GSH levels, even in WT DJ-1 transduced cells, indicating that DJ-1 acts through GSH synthesis to increase GSH levels rather than by reducing breakdown of GSH (Fig. 3A). Even in cells transduced with WT DJ-1, BSO treatment led to cell death from oxidative stress (Fig. 3B). When transduced cells were supplemented with exogenous GSH (200 μm) with BSO also present, intracellular GSH levels rose and cell viability recovered to near control levels in all transduced groups (Fig. 3, A and B). We went on to assay the activity of two GSH synthetic enzymes. We found that WT DJ-1 significantly increased GCL enzymatic activity under oxidative stress (*, p < 0.05 compared with control, n = 9; Fig. 3C), whereas GS enzymatic activity was not changed in any transduced groups (p > 0.1, n = 9; Fig. 3C). Furthermore, we found that WT DJ-1 significantly increased mRNA levels for GCL after oxidative stress (**, p < 0.01 compared with control without H2O2, n = 9; Fig. 3D). The levels of mRNA for GCL were also increased in control and GFP- and L166P DJ-1-treated cells, although to a lesser extent than WT DJ-1 (*, p < 0.05 compared with control without H2O2, n = 9; Fig. 3D). By contrast, treatment with AS DJ-1 produced no increase in GCL mRNA, suggesting that a certain amount of endogenous DJ-1 is required to increase GCL mRNA. The GS mRNA levels were not changed after H2O2 exposure in any treatment group (data not shown). Because GCL is the rate-limiting enzyme in GSH synthesis, increased GCL transcription and enzymatic activity caused increased synthesis of GSH. The results indicate that DJ-1 protects cells against oxidative stress by increasing biosynthesis of intracellular GSH. DJ-1 Reduced ROS and Protein Oxidation Levels in N27 Cells after Oxidative Stress—Because WT DJ-1 increased GSH levels, we examined other cellular oxidation products. We used the fluorescent sensor DCF to measure cellular ROS by flow cytometry. Sample images of ROS are shown in Fig. 4 (A–D). The results showed that expression of WT DJ-1 significantly reduced total cellular ROS levels after oxidative stress compared with control, whereas AS DJ-1 significantly increased ROS levels (**, p < 0.01, n = 9; Fig. 4E). The L166P DJ-1 had no effect on ROS. We have also examined protein oxidation after oxidative stress. A sample blot is shown in Fig. 4F. The protein carbonyl dot blots showed that WT DJ-1 significantly reduced protein oxidation compared with control (**, p < 0.01, n = 8; Fig. 4, F and G), whereas AS DJ-1 further increased protein oxidation (*, p < 0.05, n = 8; Fig. 4, F and G). Transduction with L166P DJ-1 showed no protection against protein oxidation compared with control (p > 0.1, n = 8; Fig. 4, F and G). DJ-1 Inhibits A53T Human α-Synuclein Toxicity and Aggregation in N27 Cells—We have shown previously that overexpression of A53T mutant human α-synuclein in N27 cells leads to protein aggregation and apoptotic cell death (18Zhou W. Hurlbert M.S. Schaack J. Prasad K.N. Freed C.R. Brain Res. 2000; 866: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In the current study, N27 cells were transduced with adenovirus expressing A53T human α-synuclein and co-transduced with WT DJ-1, L166P DJ-1, or AS DJ-1. The cells that expressed only human A53T α-synuclein frequently had large, α-synuclein-positive cytoplasmic aggregates and apoptotic nuclei (Fig. 5, A–E). By contrast, when WT DJ-1 was co-expressed with A53T α-synuclein, the cells had fewer aggregates and less apoptosis (Fig. 5, F–I). Quantitativel"

In a functional MRI (fMRI) study, we investigated whether other monkey frontal areas respond to actions performed by others. Observation of a hand grasping objects activated four frontal areas: rostral F5 and areas 45B, 45A, and 46. Observation of an individual grasping an object also activated caudal F5, which indicates different degrees of action abstraction in F5. Observation of shapes activated area 45, but not premotor F5. Convergence of object and action information in area 45 may be important for full comprehension of actions."
https://openalex.org/W2167352815,"The usual methods for establishing human embryonic stem cell lines are controversial as embryos are destroyed in the process. Two papers in this issue present different means of deriving such cells from mice without the loss of a cloned embryo with potential to develop. Meissner and Jaenisch describe a proof-of-principle experiment in mice based on altered nuclear transfer (ANT), a process that creates blastocysts unable to implant in the uterus. The new technique involves blocking the Cdx2 gene, but as Cdx2 might be needed for therapeutic strategies using these cells, the gene knockout is made reversible and Cdx2 can be turned back on once an embryonic stem-cell culture is established. ANT is one alternative being discussed in US Congress hearings on the possible use of NIH funds for stem-cell research (tinyurl.com/dhwvx). Chung et al. describe a new way of deriving mouse embryonic stem cell lines that does not disrupt the embryo's ability to implant into the womb and develop. This procedure is based on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) as used in fertility treatments, where embryos are screened for genetic defects. If healthy, they are then implanted into the uterus and develop normally. If the procedure can be transferred to human embryos already undergoing PGD, it may be possible to create banks of human embryonic stem cell lines without additional risk to the embryos. The most basic objection to human embryonic stem (ES) cell research is rooted in the fact that ES cell derivation deprives embryos of any further potential to develop into a complete human being1,2. ES cell lines are conventionally isolated from the inner cell mass of blastocysts3,4,5 and, in a few instances, from cleavage stage embryos6,7,8,9. So far, there have been no reports in the literature of stem cell lines derived using an approach that does not require embryo destruction. Here we report an alternative method of establishing ES cell lines—using a technique of single-cell embryo biopsy similar to that used in pre-implantation genetic diagnosis of genetic defects10—that does not interfere with the developmental potential of embryos. Five putative ES and seven trophoblast stem (TS) cell lines were produced from single blastomeres, which maintained normal karyotype and markers of pluripotency or TS cells for up to more than 50 passages. The ES cells differentiated into derivatives of all three germ layers in vitro and in teratomas, and showed germ line transmission. Single-blastomere-biopsied embryos developed to term without a reduction in their developmental capacity. The ability to generate human ES cells without the destruction of ex utero embryos would reduce or eliminate the ethical concerns of many."

We performed a randomized phase 1/2 study in lymphopenic individuals after high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for myeloma. Combination immunotherapy consisting of a single early post-transplant infusion of in vivo vaccine-primed and ex vivo costimulated autologous T cells followed by post-transplant booster immunizations improved the severe immunodeficiency associated with high-dose chemotherapy and led to the induction of clinically relevant immunity in adults within a month after transplantation. Immune assays showed accelerated restoration of CD4 T-cell numbers and function. Early T-cell infusions also resulted in significantly improved T-cell proliferation in response to antigens that were not contained in the vaccine, as assessed by responses to staphylococcal enterotoxin B and cytomegalovirus antigens (P < 0.05). In the setting of lymphopenia, combined vaccine therapy and adoptive T-cell transfer fosters the development of enhanced memory T-cell responses."

Iron maintains a unique role in physiology via its ability to change readily its oxidation state in response to changes in its local environment. A general simplification of its primary function is that it mediates one-electron redox reactions. This chemical property of iron enables it to act as an essential component in several biological activities, including as a cofactor for enzymes such as tyrosine hydroxylase. Oxygen binding to biomolecules such as hemoglobin and myoglobin is also coordinated by iron. Indeed iron deficiency can lead to a host of disorders, including anemia and restless legs syndrome (1Zecca L. Stroppolo A. Gatti A. Tampellini D. Toscani M. Gallorini M. Giaveri G. Arosio P. Santambrogio P. Fariello R.G. Karatekin E. Kleinman M.H. Turro N. Hornykiewicz O. Zucca F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9843-9848Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar).Paradoxically, the biochemical properties that make iron beneficial in many biological processes appear to be a drawback when the balance between its accumulation/sequestration within cellular compartments and its release is disturbed in favor of iron accumulation (2Kress G.J. Dineley K.E. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5848-5855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, iron overload is associated with several neurological conditions (3Connor J.R. Menzies S.L.

Together, these findings suggest that iron-dependent toxicity is part of the affector pathway of injury in a host of neurological conditions.How do iron chelators prevent neuronal injury? Iron is generally believed to participate in neuronal dysfunction and death through its ability to catalyze (via electron donation) the generation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals via Fenton chemistry (1Zecca L. Stroppolo A. Gatti A. Tampellini D. Toscani M. Gallorini M. Giaveri G. Arosio P. Santambrogio P. Fariello R.G. Karatekin E. Kleinman M.H. Turro N. Hornykiewicz O. Zucca F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9843-9848Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In this model hydroxyl radicals modify lipid, protein, and DNA targets to induce cell dysfunction in these cellular constituents (27Winterbourn C.C. Toxicol. Lett. 1995; 82: 969-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that iron chelators can inhibit Fenton chemistry and prevent neuronal cell injury by sequestering accumulated free iron; however, this pathway of protection remains controversial. Indeed, prior studies from our laboratory have suggested alternative pathways of protection by iron chelators.In an in vitro model of oxidative stress, we correlated the protective effects of iron chelators with their ability to activate the transcriptional activator hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (28Zaman K. Ryu H. Hall D. O'Donovan K. Lin K.I. Miller M.P. Marquis J.C. Baraban J.M. Semenza G.L. Ratan R.R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9821-9830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this scheme, iron chelators inhibit the activity of a class of iron-dependent enzymes called the HIF prolyl 4-hydroxylases. Inhibition of HIF prolyl 4-hydroxylases prevents the attachment of an OH group (hydroxylation) to phylogenetically conserved proline residues at amino acid 402 and 564 in the protein HIF-1α (29Willam C. Masson N. Tian Y.M. Mahmood S.A. Wilson M.I. Bicknell R. Eckardt K.U. Maxwell P.H. Ratcliffe P.J. Pugh C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10423-10428Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Unhydroxylated HIF-1α does not bind the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase, von Hippel-Lindau protein (30Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H.

Gielbert J. Gaskell S.J. Kriegsheim A. Hebestreit H.F. Mukherji M. Schofield C.J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J.

HIF-1α is thus not ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. Once stabilized, nuclear HIF-1α can heterodimerize with its partner HIF-1β, bind to the pentanucleotide hypoxia-response element (5′-TGATC-3′) in gene regulatory regions, and transactivate the expression of established protective genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and erythropoietin (33Semenza G.L. Agani F. Feldser D. Iyer N. Kotch L. Laughner E. Yu A. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 475: 123-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Bruick R.K. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2614-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). According to this model, the protective effects of iron chelators are not exclusively the result of suppression of Fenton chemistry, but may also result from the inhibition of iron-dependent prolyl hydroxylases. However, direct evidence that HIF-prolyl hydroxylase inhibition is a relevant target for protection from oxidative death by iron chelators has yet to be presented. In this paper we show that small molecule or peptide inhibitors of the HIF prolyl 4-hydroxylases are sufficient to inhibit neuronal death because of oxidative stress in vitro and because of permanent focal ischemia in vivo. These results implicate HIF prolyl 4-hydroxylases as targets for neuroprotection in the central nervous system.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCompound A, a proprietary compound, was obtained from Fibrogen Inc. DFO and 3,4-DHB were purchased from Sigma. Tat-HIF/ODD/wt (YGKKRRQRRRDLDLEMLAPYIPMDDDFQL) and Tat-HIF/ODD/mut (YGKKRRQRRRDLDLEMLAAYIAMDDDFQL) peptides were synthesized by Biopolymers Laboratory, Harvard Medical School. 40, 100, and 10 μm of compound A, DFO, and 3,4-DHB, respectively, were used throughout the studies unless otherwise stated. Peptides were used at a concentration of 100 μm unless otherwise stated.Primary Neurons—Cell cultures were obtained from the cerebral cortex of fetal Sprague-Dawley rats (embryonic day 17) as described previously (35Murphy T.H. Schnaar R.L. Coyle J.T. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1624-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). All experiments were initiated 24 h after plating. Under these conditions, the cells are not susceptible to glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity.Immunoblot Analysis—Cell lysates were obtained by rinsing cortical neurons with cold PBS and adding 0.1 m potassium phosphate containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Samples were then boiled in Laemmli buffer and electrophoresed under reducing conditions on 12% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Nonspecific binding was inhibited by incubation in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.9% NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dried milk for 1.5 h. Primary antibodies against aldolase (rabbit muscle; Rockland), α-tubulin (Sigma), HIF-1α (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), VEGF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and p21 (BD Biosciences) were diluted 1:2000, 1:2000, 1:500, 1:400 and 1:500, respectively, in TBST containing 1% milk overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with respective horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive proteins were detected according to the enhanced chemiluminescent protocol (Amersham Biosciences).Luciferase Assay—Primary neurons infected with adenovirus (multiplicity of infection = 100) containing luciferase gene driven by an HRE promoter (a kind gift from Dr. Robert Freeman) were treated with DFO, 3,4-DHB, compound A, and the HIF-peptides overnight. The luciferase assay was performed using the bioluminescent method (Promega Corp.).Viability Assays—For cytotoxicity studies, cells were rinsed with warm PBS and then placed in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 5.5 g/liter glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 μm cystine, containing the glutamate analog homocysteate (HCA; 5 mm). HCA was diluted from 100-fold concentrated solutions that were adjusted to pH 7.5. Viability was assessed by calcein-acetoxymethyl ester (AM)/ethidium homodimer-1 staining (live/dead assay) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) under fluorescence microscopy and the MTT assay (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) method (36Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45566) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effects of the drugs on cytotoxicity, we added DFO, 3,4-DHB, compound A, and the HIF peptide simultaneously with HCA.Immunofluoroscence Staining—Indirect labeling methods were used to determine the levels of HIF-1 protein in cortical neuron cultures. Dissociated cells from cerebral cortex were seeded onto poly-d-lysine-coated 8-well culture slides (BD Biosciences) and treated with Tat-HIF/ODD/mut, Tat-HIF/ODD/wt, and DFO overnight. Cells were washed with warm PBS and fixed at room temperature for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde. After washing, cells were incubated with blocking solution containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 5% goat serum in PBS for 1 h, followed by incubation with rabbit HIF-1 antibody (Upstate Cell Signaling, Lake Placid, NY) (1:100 dilution) overnight. After three washes with PBS, cells were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (1:200 dilution) and DAPI. The slides were washed three times with PBS and mounted with fluorochrome mounting solution (Vector Laboratories). Images were analyzed under a confocal fluorescence microscope (Zeiss LSM50, Germany). Control experiments were performed in the absence of primary antibody.HIF Prolyl 4-Hydroxylase Activity Assay—The effects of Tat-HIF/ODD/mut, Tat-HIF/ODD/wt on purified HIF-prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity was analyzed by the method based on the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate (37Hirsila M. Koivunen P. Gunzler V. Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30772-30780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar).ICP-MS Analysis—Cortical neurons were plated and treated with 3,4-DHB, DFO, or compound A. Cells were collected, lyophilized, and stored at -80 °C until further testing. 50 μl of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) (Aristar, BDH) was added to each lyophilized sample. Samples were allowed to digest overnight at room temperature followed by heating for 20 min at 90 °C using a heating block. Samples were diluted 1:25 with 1% HNO3 prior to analysis. Analysis was carried out on a Varian UltraMass ICP-MS instrument using operating conditions suitable for routine multielement analysis. The instrument was calibrated using 0, 10, 50, and 100 ppb of a certified multielement ICP-MS standard solution (ICP-MS-CAl2-1, AccuStandard). A certified internal standard solution containing 100 ppb of yttrium (89Y) as an internal control (ICP-MS-IS-MIX1-1, AccuStandard) was also used.Calcein-AM Assay—Primary neurons were treated with the drugs 3,4-DHB, DFO, and compound A overnight as described previously. Fluorescence was measured from intact cells using an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 535 nm (38Breuer W. Epsztejn S. Cabantchik Z.I. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) after addition of 0.25 μm calcein-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added to cultured neuronal cultures for 30 min at room temperature.IRP/IRE Binding Assay—Cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized, and collected. To separate membrane-bound organelles from cytosol, the cells were washed and homogenized in lysis buffer (10 mm/liter HEPES, pH 7.4, 40 mmol/liter KCl, 5% glycerol, 3 mmol/liter MgCl2, 0.1 mmol/liter EDTA, 1 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 g/liter leupeptin). Cells were sonicated to disrupt membranes. The homogenates were centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C and 4000 × g to sediment nuclei. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 4 °C and 145,000 × g for 1 h, and the cytosolic fraction was collected. For preparation of RNA transcripts, the pGEM7Zf(+)-5′L containing the complete 5′-untranslated region of rat liver L-ferritin cDNA (39Bettany A.J. Eisenstein R.S. Munro H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16531-16537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was provided by R. S. Eisenstein (University of Wisconsin, Madison). The ferritin IRE RNA transcripts were prepared from maI-digested pGEM7Zf(+)-5′L containing 100 bases of 5′-untranslated region and 40 bases from the vector. RNA transcripts were synthesized from 1 μ g of linearized plasmid DNA in the presence of 100 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (800 Ci/mmol), 12 μm unlabeled CTP, 0.5 mm of the three unlabeled nucleotides, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 20 units of T7 RNA polymerase in a 20-μl reaction volume. The reaction was carried out for 1 h at 37 °C. The yield of the transcript synthesized was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Under these conditions, the specific activity was ∼5 × 108 cpm/μg RNA. For the RNA band shift assay, 5 μg of protein for the cytoplasmic fractions were incubated with the synthetic radiolabeled IRE probe. The RNA-protein complexes were separated on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. The autoradiograms were scanned, and the resulting digital image was subjected to densitometric band analysis using the Labworks Analysis software (UVP Inc., Upland, CA). The results of the RNA band shift assays were expressed as active IRP binding from each treatment as a ratio of control.RT-PCR—The levels of p21, enolase, VEGF, and β-actin were analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR by using the one-step RT-PCR kit ReddyMix version (Abgene). The following primers were used in this study: enolase 5′-GGTTCTCATGCTGGCAACAAGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TAAACCTCTGCTCCAATGCGC-3′ (antisense) (GenBank™ accession number M012554); VEGF 5′-TGCAATGATGAAGCCCTGGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGCTATGCTGCAGGAAGCTCA-3′ (antisense) (GenBank™ accession number M32167); p21 5′-ATGTCCGATCCTGGTGATGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACTTCAGGGCTTTCTCTTGC-3′ (antisense) (GenBank™ accession number U24174); β-actin 5′-CCTCATGAAGATCCTGACCG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGCCAATAGTGATGACCTGG-3′ (antisense) (GenBank™ accession number NM007393).In Vivo Experiments—All experimental procedures were approved by the Harvard Medical Area Standing Committee on Animals and meet the standards of the Federal and State reviewing organizations.Animal Preparation and Monitoring—Eleven adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 11) weighing 250-280 g (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were operated on. Nine rats survived and were analyzed for this study. Mortality was 18% (2:11) and occurred equally in the groups of animals (one rat in each group). Death occurred during the first 20 h postoperatively. Animals were allowed free access to food and water before and after surgery. Briefly, rats were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of 400 mg/kg chloral hydrate followed 45 min later by a maintenance intraperitoneal infusion at a rate of 120 mg/kg/h using a butterfly needle set. The animals were free breathing. Their body temperatures were kept stable at 36.5 ± 0.5 °C using a feedback-regulating heating pad and a rectal probe (Harvard Apparatus, MA). The right femoral artery was cannulated for measurement of arterial blood gases, glucose, and mean arterial blood pressure. These physiological parameters were monitored before and after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). In addition, laser Doppler flowmetry (Moor Instruments, Devon, UK) was used to monitor the regional cerebral blood flow through a burr hole 2 mm in diameter created in the right parietal bone (2 mm posterior and 6 mm lateral to bregma).Surgery—All rats were subjected to right MCAO. Under the operating microscope, the right common carotid artery was exposed through a midline incision in the neck. A 4-0 nylon suture with its tip rounded by heating over a flame and subsequently coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma) was introduced into the external carotid artery and then advanced into the internal carotid artery for a length of 18-19 mm from the bifurcation. This method placed the tip of the suture at the origin of the anterior cerebral artery, thereby occluding the MCA. The placement of the suture tip was monitored by laser Doppler flowmetry measurements of regional cerebral blood flow. MCAO caused a sharp drop in regional cerebral blood flow to less than 30% of preischemic base line. The suture was left in place, and the animals were allowed to awaken from the anesthesia following closure of the operation sites.Drug Administration—3,4-DHB was dissolved in ethanol (vehicle) for a total volume of 100 μl and was administered intraperitoneally to animals (n = 6) at a dose of 180 mg/kg of body weight. 3,4-DHB was administered 6 h before MCAO. Compound A was administered to animals (n = 9) at a dose of 100 mg/kg of body weight using a gavage 6 h before the MCAO. The control animals received an equivalent volume of the vehicle (ethanol for 3,4-DHB and carboxymethylcellulose for compound A) on a similar administration schedule.Infarct Measurement—24 h after MCAO, the animal were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and xylazine (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and decapitated. The brain was rapidly removed, sliced into seven 2-mm coronal sections using a rat matrix (RBM 4000C, ASI Instrument Inc., Warren, MI), and stained according to the standard 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) method (40Bederson J.B.

Ginsberg M.D. Stroke. 1996; 27: 1616-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Each slice was drawn using a computerized image analyzer (Scion Corp.). The calculated infarction areas were then compiled to obtain the infarct volumes per brain (in mm3). Infarct volumes were expressed as a percentage of the contralateral hemisphere volume to compensate for edema formation in the ipsilateral hemisphere (42Swanson R.A. Morton M.T. Tsao-Wu G.

Ryu H. Lee J. Mwidau A. Neve R.L. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 352: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Inhibition of cystine uptake into the cell via system Xc-results in depletion of intracellular cysteine, the rate-limiting precursor of glutathione synthesis. Cyst(e)ine deprivation thus leads to depletion of the major cellular antioxidant glutathione, an imbalance in cellular oxidants and antioxidants and oxidative stress-induced death. Indeed, a host of agents with known antioxidant capacity can completely abrogate glutamate toxicity in this paradigm. To determine whether prolyl 4-hydroxylase inhibition is sufficient to prevent oxidative glutamate toxicity, we treated immature cortical neurons with established, structurally diverse, low molecular weight inhibitors of the prolyl 4-hydroxylases, DFO, 3,4-DHB, and compound A. DFO, 3,4-DHB, and compound A were selected for testing because their mechanisms of prolyl hydroxylase inhibition are believed to be distinct. 3,4-DHB has been shown previously to be an inhibitor of collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylases with respect to the 2-oxoglutarate and ascorbate cofactors and to be neutral with respect to Fe2+ (45Majamaa K. Gunzler V. Hanauske-Abel H.M. Myllyla R. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7819-7823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the ability of DFO to inhibit recombinant prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity can be overcome by addition of exogenous iron to the test tube (45Majamaa K. Gunzler V. Hanauske-Abel H.M. Myllyla R. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7819-7823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Compound A has been reported to be an inhibitor of HIF prolyl 4-hydroxylases (30Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Kaelin W.G. Science. 2001; 292 (Jr.): 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (3828) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting using a specific antibody to HIF-1α established that, like hypoxia, all of these agents (100 μm DFO, 10 μm dihydroxybenzoic acid, 40 μm compound A) stabilize HIF-1α but do so in normoxic neurons (Fig. 1A). Stabilization of HIF-1α by each of these low molecular weight compounds was associated with significant transactivation of a reporter gene driven by hypoxia-response elements (boldface in the sequence) from the promoter region of the enolase gene (5′-ACGCTGAGTGCGTGCGGGACTCGGAGTACGTGACGGA-3′) (Fig. 1B; p < 0.05). A control reporter gene without these response elements or one with the hypoxia-response elements mutated were not up-regulated by these compounds (not shown).To verify that increased reporter activity was reflected in increased protein expression, immunoblotting was performed to monitor levels of aldolase, VEGF, and p21waf1/cip1, known HIF-1-regulated genes (33Semenza G.L. Agani F. Feldser D. Iyer N. Kotch L. Laughner E. Yu A. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 475: 123-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). α-Tubulin was used as a control because its transcriptional regulation appears to be HIF-independent. As expected, DFO, 3,4-DHB, and compound A all increased protein levels of aldolase, VEGF, and p21waf1/cip1 but not α-tubulin (Fig. 1C). Taken together these results established that like non-neuronal cells, DFO"

Worm Maintenance for Tube Production—Colonies of P. californica were collected from the intertidal zone near Santa Barbara, CA and maintained in the laboratory with flowing filtered seawater and aeration. To collect tubes, several worms were removed from the colony with 1–2 cm of their original tubes intact and spaced out on a bed of 2-cm-thick clean sand grains in a plastic container (7Stewart R.J. Weaver J.C. Morse D.E. Waite J.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2004; 207: 4727-4734Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Commercial sand (grain size range 400–600 μm) (Sigma) was provided for new growth. The collected tubes were washed extensively with deionized water followed by several rinses of double deionized water, then either freeze-dried or blotted dry on tissue paper for immediate protein processing. PCR and Preparation of cDNA—Total RNA was extracted from the cement gland in the thorax of P. californica with RNase plant mini kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA) according to the supplier's protocols. First strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase with Adapter Primer, 5′-GGC CAC GCG TCG ACT AGT ACT (T)16 (Invitrogen), and used in subsequent PCR reactions. Based on specific amino acid sequences in Pc-1 and Pc-2 from a previous study (8Waite J.H. Jensen R. Morse D.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5733-5738Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) (i.e. VGGYGYGAK and WGHPAVHK, respectively), the 3′-ends of Pc-1 and Pc-2 were PCR amplified using 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3′-RACE) with degenerate oligonucleotides (sense Pc-1, 5′-GGN GGN TAY GGN TAY GGN GCN AA-3′; Pc-2, 5′-TGG GGN CAY CCN GCN GTN CAY AA-3′) and an abridged universal amplification primer (antisense 5′-GGC CAC GCG TCG ACT AGT AC-3′, Invitrogen). The PCR reaction was carried out in 25 μl of 1 × Buffer B (Fisher), 5 pmol of each primer, 5 μmol of each dNTP, 1 μl of the first strand reaction mixture, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Fisher) for 32 cycles on a Robocycler (Stratagene). Each cycle consisted of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 52 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, with a final extension time of 5 min. The PCR products were subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis followed by gel purification and cloned into a PCR TA vector (TOPO TA cloning kit, Invitrogen). Plasmids were transformed into competent Top10 cells for amplification, purification, and sequencing. The insert encoded the COOH-terminal sequence of Pc-1 and Pc-2, respectively, including the 3′-untranslated region. To obtain the 5′-ends of the Pc-1 and Pc-2 cDNA, the GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen) was used to obtain sequence information from full-length transcripts by 5′-RACE. PCR was conducted under the same condition as above with gene specific primers (antisense Pc-1, 5′-TTT CCC CCG AAT TGG TAA TTA ATA CCC-3′; Pc-2, 5′-AGA CTT TGG TGT GAG GAA TTA ATA GCC-3′) and a GeneRacer 5′ primer. A cDNA library was constructed from the mRNA extracted from the cement gland in the thorax of P. californica using the CloneMiner™ cDNA library construction kit (Invitrogen) and adapted for serine-rich protein screening. Initial screening was done by PCR using a degenerate oligonucleotide corresponding to Ser5 (sense 5′-GAA TTC AGY AGY AGY AGY AG-3′ with engineered EcoR I site) and a vector-specific universal primer, T7 5′-AATACGACTCACTATAG-3′. PCR conditions, cloning, and sequencing involved the same strategy outlined above are shown in the supplemental material. After obtaining the 3′ sequences of Pc-3A and Pc-3B, nondegenerate gene-specific primers were designed to amplify the gene sequence with 5′ RACE strategy. To ensure integrity of each cDNA, antisense primers (Pc-3A-reverse, 5′-C TCA ATG GCC TTG AAC CTA GAA TAC-3′; Pc-3B-reverse, 5′-ACA TAT AAG TCG TGT AAA TCT ATT TCT AAC-3′) were designed within the 3′-untranslated region to amplify the full-length sequence. The PCR products were subcloned into a PCR TA vector and sequenced as described above. In Situ Hybridization—Worms were carefully removed from their tubes, anesthetized in 33% magnesium sulfate, then fixed, dehydrated, and embedded in methylmethacrylate (9:1 BMA with 1% benzoyl peroxide for thermal cure) as described in Warren et al. (10Warren K.C. Coyne K.J. Waite J.H. Cary S.C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Embedded tissue was microtomed into 2-μm-thick sections and acetone-de-embedded. Sections were then rehydrated, washed with diethylpyrocarbonate-treated Q-H2O, digested with proteinase (10 μg/ml proteinase K) for 4 min at 37 °C, acetylated with 0.1 m triethanolamine, 0.5% acetic anhydride for 3 min, and blocked with blocking solution (1 × Denhardt's solution, 5% dextran sulfate, 0.2 mg/ml sheared herring sperm DNA, 4 × SSC, and 50% formamide) for 2 h at 42°C. DIG-labeled oligonucleotide was then added to the blocking solution, and the tissue sections were hybridized overnight at 42 °C. The DIG-labeled oligonucleotide was prepared by DIG-PCR labeling kit (Roche Diagnostics) using primers sense 5′-ATGAAATCCTTCACTATTTTTGCC-3′ and antisense 5′-AGAGCTGGAACTAGAGCTGTA-3′. Negative control reactions for later in situ hybridization included regular dUTP instead of DIG-labeled dUTP. Hybridization product was visualized by incubating the sections with anti-DIG-AP and subsequently adding color substrates nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as described by the supplier (Roche Diagnostics) and viewed by light microscopy. Parallel whole worms were stained for Pc-1 and -2 using the Arnow reaction (11Waite J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 258: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cement Analysis—For routine analysis, cement proteins were hydrolyzed in 6 m HCl and 5% phenol in vacuo for 24 h at 110 °C. Phosphoserine losses were corrected by extrapolation of hydrolysis to zero time (7Stewart R.J. Weaver J.C. Morse D.E. Waite J.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2004; 207: 4727-4734Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Hydrolysates were flash evaporated to dryness at 50 °C and subjected to amino acid analysis on a Beckman 6300 Autoanalyzer using an 85-min elution program for post-translationally modified amino acids (12Waite J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cysteine was detected as carboxymethylcysteine following reduction by dithiothreitol and alkylation with iodoacetate as previously described (13Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7736) Google Scholar), and phosphoserine was detected as such at 2.7 min (7Stewart R.J. Weaver J.C. Morse D.E. Waite J.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2004; 207: 4727-4734Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). For cross-link analysis, worm cement proteins on sand grains were hydrolyzed for 1–2 h at conditions otherwise described above. Dopa and cysteinyldopa were purified from flash evaporated cement hydrolysates using phenyl boronate affinity chromatography (Affi-Gel 601 Boronate, Bio-Rad). Hydrolysate residues resuspended in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) were applied to the boronate column (14Hawkins C.J. Lavin M.F. Parry D.L. Ross I.L. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 159: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Bound ligands were washed with 10 column volumes of phosphate buffer, followed by 10 column volumes of 2.5 mm NH4HCO3 and 10 column volumes of deionized distilled water. Fractions eluted with 5% acetic acid were freeze-dried and subjected to amino acid analysis (12Waite J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (Micromass QTOF2 tandem mass spectrometer) using a syringe pump to inject samples at a rate of 5 μl/min. All sample analyses were compared with authentic 2-S-cysteinyl-Dopa and 5-S-cysteinyl-Dopa. Using the known peptide sequences from two cement precursors (Pc-1 and Pc-2) as the basis for gene-specific degenerate oligonucleotides, complete sequences were deduced from the cDNAs obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR of cement gland extracts followed by 3′-and 5′-RACE. Representative and variant sequences are shown in Fig. 1 and in supporting data, respectively. Both Pc-1 and -2 are basic proteins with calculated pI values at 9.7 and 9.9, respectively, that are consistent with those measured directly by isoelectric focusing (8Waite J.H. Jensen R. Morse D.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5733-5738Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Three variants of Pc-1 were sequenced, and all have a mass of about 18 kDa and consist mostly of three amino acids, glycine, lysine, and tyrosine, the last of which is extensively modified to Dopa (8Waite J.H. Jensen R. Morse D.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5733-5738Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). All three contain 15 repeats of a consensus decapeptide VGGYGYGGKK, in which the italicized residues are occasionally substituted (Fig. 1A). With respect to Pc-2, only one variant (21 kDa) was found. This also contains degenerate copies of a consensus repeat, HPAVHKALGGYG, but with considerable variety in connecting and flanking sequences (Fig. 1B). Again, most of the tyrosine is converted to Dopa in the mature protein (8Waite J.H. Jensen R. Morse D.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5733-5738Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). While the high level of glycine was consistent with the compositional bias of the cement, Pc-1 and -2 are deficient in the other most abundant amino acid of cement, namely serine and/or phosphoserine, thus suggesting another precursor with a strong compositional bias (TABLE ONE).TABLE ONEAmino acid compositions in mol % (residues per 100 residues) determined by amino acid analysis of P. californica cement and deduced from cDNA for the precursor proteins, Pc-1, Pc-2, and Pc-3Amino acidCementPc-2Pc-1Pc-3aPc-1 and Pc-3 compositions calculated from the average composition of seven variants for Pc-3and three for Pc-1.

Open table in a new tab The average composition of a phosphoserine/serine-rich cement precursor was deduced by subtracting the compositions of Pc-1 and Pc-2 from the composition of whole cement (TABLE ONE). Three assumptions were made in this calculation: (i) that the glycine in cement is contributed only by Pc-1 (>45 mol %) and Pc-2 (>29 mol %), (ii) that histidine in cement is derived from Pc-2, and (iii) that Pc-1 and Pc-2 each contribute a third to the composite whole. The accuracy of this approach is compromised mostly by the considerable amounts of tyrosine in the Pcs known to be lost first to Dopa, then to Dopaquinone, and finally to cross-links and/or oxidation products that ultimately involve collateral losses of other amino acids (15McDowell L.M. Burzio L.A. Waite J.H. Schaefer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20293-20295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 16Burzio L.A. Waite J.H. Biochem. 2000; 39: 11147-11153Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 17Dryhurst G. Kadish K.M. Scheller F. Renneberg R. Biological Electrochemistry. 1. Academic Press, New York1982: 138-139Google Scholar) as well. Given the Ser/Ser(P) content in cement at 28.5 mol %, the Ser contributions of Pc-1 and Pc-2 are 0.6/3 and 3.7/3 Ser/Ser(P), respectively, or about 1.5 parts out of 28.5. The difference (28.5–1.5 = 27 and 27 × 3 = 81 mol %) suggests that a precursor containing more than 80 mol % Ser/Ser(P) is reasonably predicted for the third cement protein. Attempts to extract a protein with ∼80 mol % phosphoserine (Pc-3) directly from the cement gland or from cement deposited by captive worms on acid washed sand remain inconclusive. Possible reasons for this include the insolubility of cement (phosphoserine is associated with the insoluble fractions) and also that phosphoserine-rich proteins are notoriously difficult to stain following polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (18Fisher L.W. Termine J.D. Ornoy A. Harell A. Sela J. Current Advances in Skeletogenesis. Elsevier Publishing Co., New York1998: 467-472Google Scholar). In planning a molecular strategy for deducing sequence of Pc-3s, the following two points were exploited: 1) at 80 mol % serine, the probability of at least one stretch of five consecutive serines must be high, and 2) the codon preference for serine in Pc1 and -2 was AGT/C. Combining the two points, primers based on (AGT/C)4AG coupled with sequence from the 3′-untranslated region sufficed after RACE to discover the Pc3 sequences (Fig. 1C). The runs of uninterrupted serines range from Ser4 to Ser13 in length. Following further screens of cement gland cDNA with primers based on the serine rich domains, two types of putative Pc-3 variants emerged: Pc-3A variants are between 50 and 60 mol % serine and contain a highly basic carboxyl terminus with six cysteines. In contrast, the Pc-3B variants lack the basic amino acids at the carboxyl terminus and have serine levels approaching 90 mol %. Calculated masses range from 10 to 30 kDa, with an expected increase of 5–25 kDa due to phosphorylation alone. The average mol % for Ser (/Ser(P)) for all seven variants was about 73 mol % (Pc-3, TABLE ONE), which compares reasonably well with the 80 mol % predicted from the cement analysis. Calculated pI values of fully phosphorylated Pc-3s would range from 0.5 to 1.5, which would place them among the most acidic proteins known. That Pc-3 proteins are variants specifically associated with the cement gland of P. californica was demonstrated by in situ hybridization of digoxigenin-labeled Pc-3 using a gene-specific sequence 120 bp in length in the 5′-untranslated region (Fig. 2A). The label was localized to the cement gland in the thorax. In a parallel study, a worm was specifically stained for Dopa, which serves as a convenient marker for Pc-1 and -2 (Fig. 2D). Only the thorax stained with the Dopa reagent. Two intriguing features of the deduced sequences shown in Fig. 1 are the persistent cysteine content (range: 1–3.5%) with a cement average of a little over 2 mol % and a tyrosine content of 10 mol %. Analysis by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy showed the cement to be moderately endowed with sulfur (Fig. 3F), and acid hydrolyzed cement subjected to amino acid analysis contained cystine at 0.4 residue/100 residues (TABLE ONE). The latter, however, is less than half the expected level in terms of cysteine. To further explore the fate of cysteine, cement deposited by the worms onto acid-washed sand was collected and subjected to iodoacetate alkylation with or without prior reduction by dithiothreitol. No carboxymethylcysteine could be detected without prior reduction. With reduction, the detected carboxymethylcysteine (0.91 + 0.18 mol %, n = 3) was comparable with the cystine (0.44 + 0.16 mol %, n = 3) found in unreduced hydrolyzed samples. To account for the missing half of predicted cysteine, we postulated that Pc-1, -2, and -3 might be secreted with both thiolate and disulfide bonded cysteines. The thiolates could be rapidly scavenged by Dopaquinones formed upon oxidation of Dopa residues at seawater pH (pH 8.2) and thus become the basis of an effective protein cross-linking chemistry (17Dryhurst G. Kadish K.M. Scheller F. Renneberg R. Biological Electrochemistry. 1. Academic Press, New York1982: 138-139Google Scholar, 19Ito S. Kato T. Shinpo K. Fujita K. Biochem.

Using amino acid analysis, phenylboronate affinity chromatography, and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, significant levels of 5-S-cysteinyl-Dopa were detected in hydrolysates of Phragmatopoma cement (Fig. 3, G and H). The compound isolated from hydrolyzed cement plaques binds tightly to phenylboronate, has an elution time of about 54 min by amino acid analysis, a mass of 316.1 Da by ESI mass spectrometry, and a fragmentation profile by tandem ms following collision-induced decomposition that is consistent with authentic 5-S-cysteinyl-Dopa (Fig. 4). All of the observed fragments have counterparts to a previously studied pentafluoropropionyl/methylated derivative of 5-S-cysteinyl-Dopa following fast atom bombardment ms (21Agrup G. Hansson C. Rorsman H. Rosengren A.-M. Rosengren E. Commun. Dept. Anat. Univ. Lund. 1976; 5: 885-892Google Scholar) and are identified accordingly in Fig. 5. It is worth noting that although the 2- and 5-S-isomers are distinguished by their elution times on amino acid analysis, the 2-S also has distinct features on tandem ms; the intensity of the 228 and 182 peaks is consistently at 100 and 60%, respectively (results not shown).FIGURE 5Coacervated cement model with cross-linking. In complex coacervation, polyions are mixed in solution in the cement gland at a pH where the net charge is zero leading to phase separation (7Stewart R.J. Weaver J.C. Morse D.E. Waite J.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2004; 207: 4727-4734Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Dollops of coacervate are then released from the cement gland and applied to one or more spots on each sand grain. The dollops gel shortly after each sand grain is positioned onto the tube wall and solidify due to cross-link formation. The gelling is attributed to the lower solubility of magnesium and calcium ions with phosphate groups at seawater pH (7Stewart R.J. Weaver J.C. Morse D.E. Waite J.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2004; 207: 4727-4734Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and the cross-linking to adduct formation between oxidized Dopa and cysteine groups in proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A 5-S-cysteinyl-Dopa cross-link density of one per 100 amino acids was estimated from the amino acid analysis. Given the known tendency of cysteinyl-Dopa to reoxidize and undergo additional nucleophilic additions (22Ito S. Inoue S. Yamamoto Y. Fujita K. J. Med. Chem. 1981; 24: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), this density must be considered an absolute minimum. Phragmatopoma cement represents perhaps the simplest permanent bioadhesive investigated to date. In contrast to mussels and barnacles, which endeavor to attach themselves directly to the substratum, Phragmatopoma, which remains mobile within its tube, seeks only to make a concretion of sand grains. Despite this, Pc proteins exhibit some similarities with previously characterized marine adhesive proteins. Like almost all the mussel byssal adhesive proteins, Pc-1 and -2 contain high levels of Dopa and lysine. A few mussel adhesive proteins are Gly-rich like Pc-1; fp-1 from Aulacomya ater, for example, has a consensus repeat of AGYGGVK (23Burzio L.A. Saez C. Pardo J. Waite J.H. Burzio L.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1479: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), which is shorter but shares many of the functionalities of the VGGYGYGGK repeat. Pc-2 is more unique, and no matches for its consensus peptide could be found in Swiss-Prot. Only one other Mytilus adhesive protein, fp-3, has comparable tryptophan content (24Papov V.V. Diamond T.V. Biemann K. Waite J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20183-20192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Of the cement proteins, Pc-3 is most unlike other known adhesive precursors. Few proteins or domains exhibit the compositional serine/phosphoserine bias of Pc-3 especially Pc3B which exceeds 90 mol % Ser. Chick phosvitin has a phosphoserine rich domain that contains several runs of serine as long as 14 residues (25Byrne B.M. van Het Schip A.D. van de Klundert J.A.M Arnberg A.C. Gruber M. Ab G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4275-4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Phosphophoryns, matrix proteins from tooth dentin with the consensus sequence (DpSpS)n, are another example (26Ritchie H.H. Wang L.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21695-21698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 27George A. Bannon L. Sabsay B. Dillon J.W. Malone J. Veis A. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32869-32873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Both of these are involved in binding to Ca2+ ions and amorphous calcium phosphate and/or hydroxyapatite. The successful sand masonry of P. californica is likely to be largely determined by the adhesive properties of its cement and the manner of its dispensation. Four conditions are widely considered to be prerequisites for effective practical adhesion: 1) the absence of weak boundary layers, 2) good spreading of the adhesive over the surface, 3) formation of extensive interfacial interactions, and 4) uniform setting or curing of the adhesive (28Schonhorn H. Oliver J.F. Adhesion in Cellulosic and Wood-based Composites. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1981: 91-111Crossref Google Scholar). Because these prerequisites were not formulated for underwater conditions, a further prerequisite is necessary and that is delivery of the cement/adhesive as a fluid that is nondispersible by the seawater medium. This will be considered first. Pc-1, -2, and -3 are water-soluble polyelectrolyte solutes, thus secreting them together or sequentially would risk loss by dilution to the surrounding seawater. To overcome this problem, Stewart et al. (7Stewart R.J. Weaver J.C. Morse D.E. Waite J.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2004; 207: 4727-4734Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) proposed a model based on complex coacervation. Complex coacervation refers to a liquid:liquid phase separation that occurs when polycations such as basic proteins are mixed with polyanions such as acidic proteins at a pH where there is charge equivalence (29Bungenberg de Jong H.G. Kruyt H.R. Colloid Science. 2. Elsevier Publishing Co., Inc., Amsterdam1949: 433-482Google Scholar, 30Veis A. Veis A. Biological Polyelectrolytes.3. Marcel Dekker, New York1970: 211-273Google Scholar). When equivalence occurs in a symmetrical mixture of polyelectrolytes with similar charge density, molecular weight, and flexibility, a denser concentrated phase (coacervate) separates from the more dilute equilibrium phase. Coacervates have unusual properties that would seem to be able to satisfy prerequisites 1 and 2, that is, removing weak boundary layers and exhibiting good or spontaneous spreading. Coacervate proteins, by virtue of being more desolvated than noncoacervated proteins (31Ohno H. Shibayama M. Tsuchida E. Makromol. Chem. 2003; 184: 1017-1024Crossref Google Scholar), may be able to absorb water from wet surfaces. In addition, given the low interfacial tension between the coacervate and equilibrium solution phases, coacervates tend to spread readily over most surfaces (29Bungenberg de Jong H.G. Kruyt H.R. Colloid Science. 2. Elsevier Publishing Co., Inc., Amsterdam1949: 433-482Google Scholar). Pc-1, -2, and -3 ostensibly resemble commercial coacervate precursors (29Bungenberg de Jong H.G. Kruyt H.R. Colloid Science. 2. Elsevier Publishing Co., Inc., Amsterdam1949: 433-482Google Scholar) in being highly charged and flexible polymers in aqueous solution, but their influence on coacervation when mixed in roughly equal concentrations must be specifically considered. Let us assume that mixing is done at pH 5, which is thought to be the intragranular pH of a mature regulated secretory granule (32Johnson R.G. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 232-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Pc-1 and -2 are polycationic with a charge densities at pH 5 of about +0.2 and +0.35/residue and molecular masses of 18 and 21 kDa, respectively. Pc-3 charge density, assuming complete phosphorylation of serines, is higher at –0.4 to –0.8/residue at pH 5.0, and Pc-3 masses are phosphorylation-dependent ranging from 10 to 30 kDa for unphosphorylated variants and 18 to 52 kDa for fully phosphorylated forms. Given the dominance of negative charges in Pc-3s, it is clear that charge equivalence could not be achieved with the polyelectrolytes alone. Addition of microions such as Mg2+ and Ca2+ to the mixture could help overcome the charge imbalance but high salt also suppresses coacervation (30Veis A. Veis A. Biological Polyelectrolytes.3. Marcel Dekker, New York1970: 211-273Google Scholar). Cytochemical studies of cement producing cells in the cement glands of the tubeworms have established that Mg2+ and Ca2+ are colocalized with phosphate in mottled granules (6Gruet Y. Vovelle J. Grasset M. Can. J. Zool. 1987; 65: 837-842Crossref Google Scholar, 33Vovelle J. Grasset M. Cah. Biol. Mar. 1990; 31: 333-348Google Scholar), but it is not known whether Pc-1 and -2 are also present. The emerging picture is one that contrasts starkly with coacervation based on a symmetrical mixture. The necessity of microion addition for charge equivalence, high polydispersity in molecular weight and negative charges (via phosphorylation), and the effect of divalent ion binding on Pc-3 backbone flexibility all portend a multiphase coacervate morphology. Although this is consistent with the porous structure of the cement (7Stewart R.J. Weaver J.C. Morse D.E. Waite J.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2004; 207: 4727-4734Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and of the mottled cement precursor granules (3Vovelle J. Arch. Zool. Exp. Gen. 1965; 106: 1-187Google Scholar, 33Vovelle J. Grasset M. Cah. Biol. Mar. 1990; 31: 333-348Google Scholar), a fundamental understanding of the process will require much more study. With regard to the third prerequisite of adhesion, given the high polarities of Pc proteins, extensive electrostatic and van der Waals interactions with the surface of the substratum are inevitable but their interaction strength would be diminished by the high dielectric constant of seawater. Pc proteins, however, are also capable of interfacial contacts that are independent of the dielectric constant of seawater. These are most notably the interaction of Dopa with surface oxides, which results in a coordinate bond (34Dalsin J.L. Lin L. Tosatti S. Vörös J. Textor M. Messersmith P.M. Langmuir. 2005; 21: 640-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), and the interaction of phosphoserines with minerals such as iron oxides and apatite to form insoluble ionic bonds (35Boffardi B.P. Mater. Perform. 1993; 32: 50-53Google Scholar). Curing results from the formation of intermolecular cross-bridges (fourth prerequisite) in the adhesive. If future studies determine that the cysteinyldopa cross-links in cement are intermolecular, then this would fulfill the setting requirement.

A role for phosphoserines in setting is suggested by the high levels of Mg/Ca2+ in the cement and cement gland (6Gruet Y. Vovelle J. Grasset M. Can. J.

Indeed, Ca/Mg2+ interactions with phosphates represent an excellent pH triggered type of setting. At low pH the interaction would be largely electrostatic, whereas at pH 8, given the Ksp (calcium phosphate) = 2.02 × 10–33, it would become ionic and precipitate (36Kuboki Y. Fujisawa R. Aoyama K. Sasaki S. J. Dent. Res. 1979; 58: 1926-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 proposes the key steps in Phragmatopoma cement formation. Some or all cement precursors are stockpiled together with Mg/Ca as multiphase coacervates in secretory cell granules of the cement gland. The granule coacervate contents are released onto the surface of a sand grain where they coalesce and spread. Because the interactions between Mg/Ca2+ and phosphate groups are less soluble at seawater pH, the cement becomes less fluid and more gel-like. Finally, Dopa residues not coordinated at the interface oxidize to Dopaquinones that react with cysteines to form irreversible cysteinyldopa cross-links. We know of no other instance in which coacervation is exploited in adhesion. The setting by Ca2+, however, shares a striking parallel with a common commercial glue (e.g. Elmer's White Glue™), which consists of a phosphoprotein (casein) that can be rendered water-resistant by the addition of lime (Ca(OH)2) at alkaline pH (2Salzberg H.K. Skeist I. Handbook of Adhesives. Van Nostrand Reinhold Co., New York1977: 158-171Google Scholar). The adhesive advantages gained by Phragmatopoma cement in having an order of magnitude more phosphate groups than casein and a significant inclusion of polycations with Dopa groups (Pc-1 and -2) remain to be explored.

By contrast, TNF primarily induces gene transcription through the inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Apo2L/TRAIL also can stimulate these kinases, albeit less strongly; however, the underlying mechanisms of this stimulation and its relation to apoptosis are not well understood. Here we show that Apo2L/TRAIL activates kinase pathways by promoting the association of a secondary signaling complex, subsequent to assembly of a primary, death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). The secondary complex retained the DISC components FADD and caspase-8, but recruited several factors involved in kinase activation by TNF, namely, RIP1, TRAF2, and NEMO/IKKγ. Secondary complex formation required Fas-associated death domain (FADD), as well as caspase-8 activity. Apo2L/TRAIL stimulation of JNK and p38 further depended on RIP1 and TRAF2, whereas IKK activation required NEMO.

The TNF ligand superfamily is defined by structural similarity and ability to recognize corresponding TNF receptor (TNFR) superfamily members, which share homology in their extracellular, cysteine-rich domains. The intracellular domains of TNFRs are devoid of enzymatic activity: The majority contain an amino acid sequence motif that mediates interaction with TNFR-associated factors (TRAFs). Conversely, a minority of TNFRs share an intracellular “death domain” motif, which interacts with adaptor molecules that contain related death domains. The signaling activities and biological functions of the death-domain-containing TNFR subgroup are diverse. A key signaling activity of Fas, which binds to Fas ligand (FasL), and of DR4 and DR5, which bind to Apo2L/TRAIL, is apoptosis induction. On the other hand, TNFR1, which binds TNF and LT-α, primarily regulates transcription of pro-inflammatory and immunomodulatory genes and contributes to cell death signaling only in unique situations. tumor necrosis factor TNF receptor antibody Apo2L ligand cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein death-inducing signaling complex Fas-associated protein with death domain Fas ligand fetal bovine serum glutathione S-transferase cellular FLICE inhibitory protein inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB c-Jun amino-terminal kinase nuclear factor-κB Roswell Park Memorial Institute small interfering RNA receptor interacting protein TNF receptor-associated death domain TNF receptor-associated factor tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone inhibitor of κB kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase mouse embryo fibroblast stress-activated protein kinase; CHI interleukin-8 immunoblot monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. The apoptosis-signaling events that the death-inducing ligands FasL and Apo2L/TRAIL trigger are relatively well defined (reviewed in Refs. 6Ashkenazi A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar, 7Peter M.E. Krammer P.H. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 8LeBlanc H.N. Ashkenazi A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Binding of Fas, DR4, or DR5 by cognate ligand leads to conformational changes that promote interaction between the death domain of the receptor and the homologous region of the adaptor molecule Fas-associated death domain (FADD). FADD also contains a “death effector domain,” which mediates recruitment of two death effector domain-containing apical proteases: caspase-8 and caspase-10. This primary signaling complex, consisting of ligand, receptor, FADD, and apical caspase(s), is dubbed the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) (9Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1787) Google Scholar). Caspase-8 and -10 belong to the cysteine protease family, which plays a crucial role in programmed cell death. In living cells, caspase-8 and -10 are expressed as inactive precursors; in the DISC, these caspases become activated by oligomerization. Once activated, caspase-8 and -10 undergo proteolytic self-processing, in turn cleaving and activating downstream effector caspases, such as caspase-3, -6, and -7, which mediate the execution phase of apoptotic cell death (10Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar, 11Cowling V. Downward J. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1046-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In certain cell types, death receptor stimulation of caspase-8 and -10 triggers sufficient effector caspase activation to commit the cell to apoptotic death. In others, death requires further amplification of the apoptosis signal. This augmentation can be initiated by caspase-8-mediated cleavage of the proximal pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bid. The truncated form of Bid activates the distal pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bax and Bak, which trigger mitochondrial release of factors that promote activation of the apical protease caspase-9. In turn, caspase-9 stimulates further effector caspase activity, ensuring completion of the cell death program. A cellular factor called FLICE inhibitory protein (FLIP), which bears structural similarity to caspase-8 and -10 but lacks caspase activity, can inhibit death receptor-mediated apoptosis signaling (12Tschopp J. Irmler M. Thome M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). FLIP occurs in both short (FLIPS) and long (FLIPL) alternative mRNA splicing forms. Both forms can compete for apical caspase recruitment to the DISC, whereas FLIPL also can inhibit the full processing of caspase-8 and -10. In contrast to the apoptosis-initiating events triggered by binding of FasL and Apo2L/TRAIL to their corresponding death receptors, TNF binding to TNFR1 leads to activation of the IKK/NF-κB, JNK, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways (13Chen G. Goeddel D.V. Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). Upon ligation, TNFR1 binds through its death domain to the adaptor molecule TNFR-associated death domain (TRADD). TRADD in turn binds two other adpators: RIP1, which also contains a death domain and mediates activation of the IKK and p38 pathways, and TRAF2, which supports activation of IKK and JNK. TNFR1 activates the NF-κB pathway by inducing TRAF2-dependent formation of the signalosome complex, in which the scaffold protein NEMO/IKKγ and two kinases, IKKα and IKKβ, are key catalytic components (14Zhang S.Q. Kovalenko A. Cantarella G. Wallach D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). IKK signalosome activation results in phosphorylation of the inhibitor of NF-κB(IκB), which in resting cells binds to NF-κB subunits and keeps them in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation triggers proteosomal degradation of IκB, liberating NF-κB to move to the nucleus, where it can promote gene transcription. TRAF2 recruits two additional molecules, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (cIAP1) and cIAP2, to the TNFR1 complex, but the role of these cIAPs in TNFR1 signaling remains unclear. In most cellular contexts, TNF activates the IKK, JNK, and p38 kinase pathways but not apoptotic caspase pathways. Induction of several NF-κB-dependent anti-apoptotic genes by TNF, including FLIP, cIAP1, cIAP2, XIAP, Bcl-XL, and A1, prevents apoptosis activation; however, under certain conditions, such as general inhibition of protein synthesis or specific blockade of NF-κB activation, TNF can stimulate a strong pro-apoptotic signal (reviewed in Refs. 15Kucharczak J. Simmons M.J. Fan Y. Gelinas C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8961-8982Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar and 16Varfolomeev E.E. Ashkenazi A. Cell. 2004; 116: 491-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Apoptosis initiation by TNF relies on the formation of a secondary intracellular signaling complex, composed of TRADD, RIP1, and TRAF2, as well as FADD and caspase-8 (17Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). Although the strongest signaling activity of FasL and Apo2L/TRAIL is apoptosis induction in susceptible cells, there is accumulating evidence for the ability of these ligands to activate the IKK, JNK, and p38 pathways (reviewed in Refs. 18Krammer P.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar, 19Almasan A. Ashkenazi A.

Immunity. 2004; 21: 877-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). NF-κB stimulation by FasL and Apo2L/TRAIL is of particular interest, because of the anti-apoptotic activity of this transcription factor. Indeed, some tumors display a correlation between NF-κB activity and resistance to death-inducing ligands. Moreover, in some cancer cell lines, inhibition of NF-κB activity by various molecular approaches reverts resistance to cell death signaling by FasL and Apo2L/TRAIL (reviewed in Refs. 15Kucharczak J. Simmons M.J. Fan Y. Gelinas C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8961-8982Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 24Greten F.R. Karin M. Cancer Lett. 2004; 206: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). However, the biological role and significance of kinase pathway activation in the context of apoptosis signaling by FasL and Apo2L/TRAIL are not well understood. Furthermore, in contrast to the well-defined events mediating caspase stimulation by these ligands, the molecular determinants underlying their kinase-activating function have been controversial. Published studies with FADD or caspase-8 null mice focused on apoptosis signaling and did not examine kinase pathway activation in detail (25Yeh W.C. de la Pompa J.L. McCurrach M.E. Shu H.B.

Ectopic expression of dominant-negative FADD or caspase-8 mutants did not interfere with activation of NF-κB or JNK by TNF, FasL, or Apo2L/TRAIL (27Wajant H. Johannes F.J. Haas E. Siemienski K.

In contrast, detailed examination of mutant Jurkat T cell lines with deficiency in FADD or caspase-8 revealed an absolute necessity of these proteins for apoptosis as well as kinase pathway activation by death receptor ligands (28Juo P.

More recent experiments utilizing siRNA-based gene silencing techniques have confirmed the requirement of FADD and caspase-8 for kinase pathway activation by FasL, although Apo2L/TRAIL was not investigated (32Imamura R.

Additional studies yielded conflicting data supporting or excluding a direct involvement of TRAF2 and RIP1 in activation of JNK and NF-κB by FasL and Apo2L/TRAIL (31Kreuz S. Siegmund D. Rumpf J.J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 6638-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Although important insights into kinase pathway activation by FasL and Apo2L/TRAIL have been achieved to date, we aimed in this present study to attain further elucidation of the molecular components and events that mediate this function, specifically as it pertains to Apo2L/TRAIL. Kinase pathway adaptors such as TRADD and RIP1 were reported to interact with the Apo2L/TRAIL receptors DR4 and DR5 in overexpression model systems (reviewed in Ref. 2Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5154) Google Scholar). In DR4/5-transfected HEK 293 and HeLa cells, RIP1 is associated with unstimulated DR4 and DR5, increases in abundance after ligand stimulation, and undergoes caspase-dependent cleavage (35Harper N.

However, studies that examined associations between endogenous cellular components did not confirm recruitment of TRADD, RIP1, or TRAF2 to the Apo2L/TRAIL DISC (22Kimberley F.C. Screaton G.R.

Here, we demonstrate the formation of a secondary signaling complex subsequent to assembly of the Apo2L/TRAIL DISC and identify several components of this complex that are crucial for kinase pathway activation. In addition, we provide evidence that kinase stimulation by Apo2L/TRAIL is associated with increased chemokine production and macrophage migration, suggesting that one role of kinase activation by this pro-apoptotic ligand may be to promote the recruitment of phagocytes to the site of apoptosis.

The following siRNA pairs were used for gene knockdown experiments: FADD, 5′-CACAGAGAAGGAGAACGCA and 5′-UGCGUUCUCCUUCUCUGUG (pair no. 4); RIP1, 5′-CAGCCUGGUUCACUGCACA and 5′-UGUGCAGUGAACCAGGCUG (no. 16), 5′-CCACUAGUCUGACGGAUAA and UUAUCCGUCAGACUAGUGG (no. 70), 5′-GAAAGAGUAUUCAAACGAA and 5′-UUCGUUUGAAUACUCUUUC (no. 71), 5′-GAAAGAGUAUUCAAACGAA and 5′-UUCGUUUGAAUACUCUUUC (no. 178); caspase-8, 5′-UGAAGAUAAUCAACGACUA and 5′-UAGUCGUUGAUUAUCUUCA (no. 86), 5′-GUAUACCUGUUGAGACUGA and 5′-UCAGUCUCAACAGGUAUAC (no. 87), 5′-GAUUUAUCAUCACCUCAAA and 5′-UUUGAGGUGAUGAUAAAUC (no. 88); TRAF2, 5′-GUGUCGAGUCCCUUGCAGA and 5′-UCUGCAAGGGACUCGACAC (no. 11), 5′-GGUCUUGGAGAUGGAGGCA and 5′-UGCCUCCAUCUCCAAGACC (no. 12); JNK1, 5′-UGAUGUGUCUUCAAUGUCA and 5′-UGACAUUGAAGACACAUCA (no. 110), 5′-UAAGCCGACCAUUUCAGAA and 5′-UUCUGAAAUGGUCGGCUUA (no. 111); JNK2, 5′-CCAAACUCAUGCAAAGAGA and 5′-UCUCUUUGCAUGAGUUUGG (no. 118). Cells were transfected as described previously (39Sharp D.A. Lawrence D.A. Ashkenazi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19401-19409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Activation of JNK, p38 MAPK, and IKK/NF-κB—Cells were seeded into 10-cm dishes and in the case of gene silencing experiments were transfected as described above. Twelve hours before treatment cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and the growth media were replaced by media containing 2% heat-inactivated FBS. On the next day, cells were detached from the plates with non-enzymatic solution (Sigma) and placed into 24-well dishes (0.5-2 × 106 cells/well) in 0.25 ml of media containing 2% heat-inactivated FBS. In the gene silencing experiments, cells were treated with 0.25 ml of media containing 200 ng/ml Apo2L/TRAIL or 30 ng/ml TNF. In other experiments cells were treated with the ligand concentrations indicated in the figure legends. Upon treatment cells were lysed with a kinase lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton, 1× phosphatase inhibitor mixture II (no. P-5726, Sigma)) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis, using phospho-specific anti-p38, -JNK, -IκBα, or total IκBα antibodies and ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro JNK1 Assay—Cells were prepared and treated similarly to the immunoblot analysis. Upon lysis, JNK1 was immunoprecipitated, and in vitro kinase reaction was performed using recombinant GST-c-Jun substrate as described before (40Kerkhoff E. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 2576-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). 32P incorporation into GST-c-Jun was determined by SDS-PAGE analysis followed by autoradiography. Cytotoxicity Assays—Cells (1-1.5 × 104 per well) were seeded into 96-well dishes in media containing 5% of heat-inactivated FBS. 8-12 h later the media was changed, and cells were treated with human Apo2L/TRAIL, FasL, or TNF (cycloheximide was used in the latter case at 0.5-2 μg/ml, as indicated in the figure legends) for 18-24 h. Cell viability was measured by neutral red uptake as described (41Johnston M.D. Finter N.B. Young P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 78: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Examination of cIAP2 mRNA Expression—Total RNA was extracted from Apo2L/TRAIL (100 ng/ml)-, FasL (100 ng/ml)-, or TNF (100 ng/ml)-treated UACC62 cells by RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Real-time PCR (Taqman) was carried out in a 50-μl reaction containing 50 ng of total RNA, 0.6 μm each of gene-specific forward and reverse primers, and 0.2 μm of gene-specific fluorescence probe. cIAP2-specific primers (forward, GGACAGGAGTTCATCCGTCAA; reverse, GGGCTGTCTGATGTGGATAGC; and probe, TCAAGCCAGTTACCCTCATCTACTTGAACAGC). Gene-specific PCR products were measured using an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System following the manufacturer's instructions (PE Corp.). The relative levels of cIAP2 mRNA were normalized to RPL19 mRNA levels measured in the same sample. The changes of cIAP2 mRNA expression upon stimulation were calculated as a ratio of relative cIAP2 mRNA expression at the indicated time points (Fig. 1D) to the relative cIAP2 mRNA level at 0 time point. Cytometric Bead Array Immunoassay—Cells were detached by non-enzymatic solution (Sigma) and seeded into 6-well dishes (0.5 × 106 cells/well in 2 ml of media). Treatment of the cells with Apo2L/TRAIL (100 ng/ml) or FasL (100 ng/ml) or TNF (10 ng/ml) in 1% FBS media was initiated 1 h later. After 8 h of incubation the cells were spun down, aliquots of conditioned media were collected from the supernatant, and the concentrations of cytokines IL-8 and CCL2/MCP-1 were determined by using a Human Inflammation Kit and a Human Chemokine Kit II (BD Bioscience, nos. 551811 and 558015, respectively). Macrophage Migration Assay—Human macrophages were isolated from a donor blood using Miltenyi CD11b+ beads. Cells were rested in serum-free medium for 12 h and then subjected (2 × 105 cells per upper chamber well) to migration assay using BD BioCoat™ Tumor Invasion System (no. 354165, BD Biosciences). 6 h later, the number of macrophages migrated to the bottom chambers filled with 5% fetal calf serum (as a positive control), or with the condition media samples collected from HT1080 or HT29 cells incubated in the serum-free media or treated for 8 h with Apo2L/TRAIL (100 ng/ml) in serum-free media were calculated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Kinase Pathway Activation by Death-inducing Ligands—We reasoned that cells with moderate apoptosis susceptibility to Apo2L/TRAIL might facilitate investigation of its kinase activation mechanisms. To this end, we tested several cancer cell lines for sensitivity to death induction by Apo2L/TRAIL, FasL, or TNF plus the protein translation inhibitor cycloheximide. The HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell line displayed intermediate sensitivity to each of the three ligands, whereas other cell lines tested displayed differential sensitivity (Fig. 1A). Taking these data together with the extensive previous characterization of HT1080 cells as a model system for TNF signaling (31Kreuz S. Siegmund D. Rumpf J.J. Samel D. Leverkus M. Janssen O.

Cell. 2003; 115: 61-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), we chose this cell line for further experiments, while verifying key observations in other cell lines. We began our investigation by testing the kinetics and potency of kinase pathway activation by death receptor ligands (Fig. 1B). We determined JNK pathway activation by immunoprecipitation of JNK1 and analysis of its ability to phosphorylate c-Jun; p38 MAPK activation by immunoblot (IB) detection of cellular phospho-p38 levels; and IKK/NF-κB pathway activation by IB detection of phospho-IκB and total IκB. Apo2L/TRAIL or FasL treatment of HT1080 cells induced a biphasic kinetic profile of JNK activation, with c-Jun phosphorylating activity peaking first at 15 min and then again at 120 or 60 min, respectively (Fig. 1B).

In sub-Saharan Africa, two such conditions occur at particularly high frequencies: presence of the structural variant hemoglobin S and alpha(+)-thalassemia, a condition characterized by reduced production of the normal alpha-globin component of hemoglobin. Individually, each is protective against severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria, but little is known about their malaria-protective effects when inherited in combination. We investigated this question by studying a population on the coast of Kenya and found that the protection afforded by each condition inherited alone was lost when the two conditions were inherited together, to such a degree that the incidence of both uncomplicated and severe P. falciparum malaria was close to baseline in children heterozygous with respect to the mutation underlying the hemoglobin S variant and homozygous with respect to the mutation underlying alpha(+)-thalassemia. Negative epistasis could explain the failure of alpha(+)-thalassemia to reach fixation in any population in sub-Saharan Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2029252362,"The derivation of embryonic stem (ES) cells by nuclear transfer holds great promise for research and therapy but involves the destruction of cloned human blastocysts. Proof of principle experiments have shown that 'customized' ES cells derived by nuclear transfer (NT-ESCs) can be used to correct immunodeficiency in mice. Importantly, the feasibility of the approach has been demonstrated recently in humans, bringing the clinical application of NT-ESCs within reach. Altered nuclear transfer (ANT) has been proposed as a variation of nuclear transfer because it would create abnormal nuclear transfer blastocysts that are inherently unable to implant into the uterus but would be capable of generating customized ES cells. To assess the experimental validity of this concept we have used nuclear transfer to derive mouse blastocysts from donor fibroblasts that carried a short hairpin RNA construct targeting Cdx2. Cloned blastocysts were morphologically abnormal, lacked functional trophoblast and failed to implant into the uterus. However, they efficiently generated pluripotent embryonic stem cells when explanted into culture."

https://openalex.org/W2001091850,"Prion infectivity is typically restricted to the central nervous and lymphatic systems of infected hosts, but chronic inflammation can expand the distribution of prions. We tested whether chronic inflammatory kidney disorders would trigger excretion of prion infectivity into urine. Urinary proteins from scrapie-infected mice with lymphocytic nephritis induced scrapie upon inoculation into noninfected indicator mice. Prionuria was found in presymptomatic scrapie-infected and in sick mice, whereas neither prionuria nor urinary PrP Sc was detectable in prion-infected wild-type or PrP C -overexpressing mice, or in nephritic mice inoculated with noninfectious brain. Thus, urine may provide a vector for horizontal prion transmission, and inflammation of excretory organs may influence prion spread."

Pim kinases are emerging as important mediators of cytokine signaling pathways in hematopoietic cells, and they contribute to the progression of certain leukemias and solid tumors. A number of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins are phosphorylated by Pim kinases and may act as their effectors in normal physiology and in disease. Recent crystallographic studies of Pim-1 have identified unique structural features but have not provided insight into how the kinase recognizes its target substrates. Here, we have conducted peptide library screens to exhaustively determine the sequence specificity of active site-mediated phosphorylation by Pim-1 and Pim-3. We have identified the major site of Pim-1 autophosphorylation and find surprisingly that it maps to a novel site that diverges from its consensus phosphorylation motif. We have solved the crystal structure of Pim-1 bound to a high affinity peptide substrate in complexes with either the ATP analog AMP-PNP or the bisindolylmaleimide kinase inhibitor 2-[1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1H-indol-3-yl]-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)maleimide HCl. These structures reveal an unanticipated mode of recognition for basic residues upstream of the phosphorylation site, distinct from that of other kinases with similar substrate specificity.

A number of proteins have been identified that are phosphorylated by Pim kinases in vitro, including transcriptional repressors (HP1), activators (NFATc1 and c-Myb), and co-activators (p100), as well as regulators of the cell cycle (p21WAF1/CIP1, Cdc25A phosphatase, and the kinase C-TAK1/MARK3/Par1A) (22Koike N.

The status of any of these proteins, however, as bona fide effectors of Pim kinases in vivo has not been established. Pim kinases appear to phosphorylate the pro-apoptotic protein BAD both in vitro and in vivo on Ser-112, a gatekeeper residue for its inactivation, and induce apoptotic resistance under conditions of growth factor withdrawal (20Fox C.J.

Interestingly, selectivity for arginine at the -5 and -3 positions within substrates is also a feature of Akt/PKB, a downstream mediator of cell survival in phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling (35Alessi D.R.

Their studies revealed a constitutively active kinase conformation in the absence of phosphorylated residues in the activation loop. In addition, the Pim-1 structures revealed a unique hinge region lacking a hydrogen bond donor, suggesting potential for the development of specific Pim kinase inhibitors that target the ATP binding site. We have extended these structural studies to provide insight into the molecular basis for substrate recognition by Pim-1. Comparison of the previously determined Pim-2 phosphorylation motif with new peptide library screens performed on Pim-1 and Pim-3 indicates that the three Pim kinases share a common consensus sequence. Accordingly, we have found that the optimized peptide previously described for Pim-2 is also a high affinity substrate for Pim-1, enabling crystallographic studies of Pim-1·peptide complexes.

Cells were lysed using a high pressure homogenizer and cleared by centrifugation, and the lysate was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography. The eluted Pim-1 protein was treated with λ-phosphatase together with tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease overnight to remove phosphorylation and the hexahistidine tag, respectively. The protein was further purified on a Mono Q column and resolved into two species, shown by ESI-MS to be homogeneous non-phosphorylated and singly phosphorylated Pim-1. Protein was stored at 4 °C in elution buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 10 mm DTT) or frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C.Determination of Peptide Phosphorylation Specificity—Phosphorylation motifs for Pim kinases were determined using a positional scanning peptide library approach essentially as described previously (34Hutti J.E. Jarrell E.T. Chang J.D. Abbott D.W. Storz P. Toker A. Cantley L.C. Turk B.E. Nat. Methods. 2004; 1: 27-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out in multiwell plates in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Tween 20, 50 μm ATP (including 0.3 μCi/μl [γ-33P]ATP), 50 μm peptide substrate, and 300 nm Pim kinase for 2-4 h at 30 °C. Peptide substrates had the general sequence YAXXXXX(S/T)XXXXAGKK(biotin), where S/T represents an even mixture of serine and threonine, K(biotin) is ϵ-(biotinamidocaproyl)-lysine, and is a roughly equimolar mixture of the 17 amino acids, excluding cysteine, serine, and threonine. Each well contained a distinct peptide in which one of the X positions was fixed as one of 22 residues (one of the unmodified proteogenic amino acids, phosphothreonine, or phosphotyrosine). At the end of the incubation time, aliquots of each reaction were spotted onto streptavidin membrane, which was processed as described (34Hutti J.E. Jarrell E.T. Chang J.D. Abbott D.W. Storz P. Toker A. Cantley L.C. Turk B.E. Nat. Methods. 2004; 1: 27-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Pimtide by Pim-1 was assayed by P81 phosphocellulose filter binding as described using 9 pm Pim-1 for 5-10 min at 30 °C. Initial rates were measured at peptide substrate concentrations of 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 nm and an ATP concentration of 25 μm to determine the Km value. Reaction progress was linear over time.Autophosphorylation—Reactions were initiated at room temperature by the addition of 5 μm (final concentration) non-phosphorylated Pim-1 to a 200-μl solution containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm MnCl2. At each time point a 5-μl aliquot was removed and added to a stop buffer containing 20 mm EDTA and 0.1% formic acid. Protein masses were determined by liquid chromatography-MS, using an Agilent LC/MSD TOF system with reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization and an orthogonal time-of-flight mass analyzer. Proteins were desalted prior to mass spectrometry by rapid elution off a C3 column with a gradient of 5-95% acetonitrile in water with 0.1% formic acid. Spectra were analyzed and exported using Analyst QS (Agilent) and transformed using MagTran.Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Calorimetric measurements were carried out using a VP-ITC titration calorimeter (MicroCal, Inc.). Peptides (100-500 μm) were titrated into Pim-1 protein (10 μm) buffered in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. Heats of dilution were measured in blank titrations and were subtracted from the binding heats. Data were analyzed using a single binding site model implemented in the Origin software package provided with the instrument. Peptides were synthesized by Thermo Electron GmbH and purified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (Pimtide: ARKRRRHPSGPPTA-amide; p21tide: RKRRQTSMTD; PAP-1tide: KKRKHKASKSS).Crystallization—Non-phosphorylated Pim-1 (buffered in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 10 mm DTT) was concentrated to 5-8 mg/ml in the presence of bound ligands (theoretical final concentrations: 0.6 mm Pimtide, and either 0.6 mm BIM1 or 1 mm AMP-PNP-MgCl2. BIM1 (2-[1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1H-indol-3-yl]-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)maleimide HCl) was purchased from Calbiochem and added from a 50 mm Me2SO stock solution. Co-crystals were grown at 4 °C in 150-nl sitting drops mixing 100 nl of Pim-1 ligand complex with a 50-nl precipitant. The Pim-1·BIM1·Pimtide co-crystal grew from a precipitant solution containing 0.1 m SPG (pH 6.0, mix ratio 2:7:7 succinate/sodium phosphate/glycine), 30% polyethylene glycol 1000, 0.5% Me2SO. The Pim-1·AMP-PNP·Pimtide co-crystal grew from a precipitant solution containing 0.2 m NH4Cl pH 6.3, 20% polyethylene glycol 3350.Structure Determination—Pim-1 diffraction data were collected on a frozen crystal (100 K) using a Rigaku FRE x-ray generator equipped with multilayer mirrors and an R-AXIS HTC detector. Images were indexed and integrated using MOSFLM (45Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; 26 (Vol., Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK)Google Scholar), and scaled using SCALA (46Evans P.R. Proceedings of CCP4 Study Weekend on Data Collection & Processing. 1993; (pp.): 114-122Google Scholar) implemented in the CCP4 (47P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar) suite of programs. The structures were solved using molecular replacement and the program Phaser (48Storoni L.C. McCoy A.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar) with coordinates of Pim-1 in complex with BIM1 (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1XWS). Both structures were refined with REFMAC5 (49Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13779) Google Scholar) using iterative rounds of rigid-body refinement and restrained refinement with TLS, against maximum likelihood targets, interspersed with manual rebuilding of the model using Xfit/XtalView (50McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar).Coordinates—Coordinates for Pim-1 in complex with the bisindolylmaleimide inhibitor BIM1 and Pim-1 consensus peptide as well as AMP-PNP and Pim-1 consensus peptide have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB codes 2BIL and 2BZK, respectively).RESULTSThe Three Pim Kinases Share a Common Phosphorylation Consensus Sequence—Based on analysis of individual peptide substrates, Pim-1 has been described as having selectivity for basic residues at the -5 through -2 positions relative to the phosphorylation site and for smaller residues at the +1 position (32Friedmann M. Nissen M.S. Hoover D.S. Reeves R. Magnuson N.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 33Palaty C.K. Clark-Lewis I. Leung D. Pelech S.L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recently we used a peptide library approach to systematically evaluate the contribution of all amino acid residues at each of nine positions surrounding a fixed phosphoacceptor site to phosphorylation by Pim-2 (34Hutti J.E. Jarrell E.T. Chang J.D. Abbott D.W. Storz P. Toker A. Cantley L.C. Turk B.E. Nat. Methods. 2004; 1: 27-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Although most closely related to the other Pim kinases, human Pim-2 is only 61 and 66% identical within its catalytic domain to Pim-1 and Pim-3, respectively, suggesting that there may be differences in substrate specificity among members of the family. To determine if this were the case, we repeated the peptide library screens using bacterially expressed Pim-1 and Pim-3 (Fig. 1). The phosphorylation profile of both Pim-1 and Pim-3 is overall very similar to that of Pim-2, including both major and secondary selections. In addition to a strong preference for basic residues, particularly arginine, at the -5 and -3 positions, the common Pim kinase motif is characterized by selectivity at a number of other sites, including histidine at the -2, proline at the -1, and glycine at the +1 positions.A consensus peptide substrate, Pimtide (ARKRRRHPSGPPTA), was previously generated based on the peptide library results and shown to be efficiently phosphorylated by Pim-2 (34Hutti J.E. Jarrell E.T. Chang J.D. Abbott D.W. Storz P. Toker A. Cantley L.C. Turk B.E. Nat. Methods. 2004; 1: 27-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). As a prelude to structural studies, we determined the binding affinity of this peptide to the various Pim kinases by ITC (Fig. 2). Both Pim-1 and Pim-3 bind to Pimtide with strikingly high affinity, having KD values in the range of 40-60 nm (TABLE ONE). Binding is driven strongly by enthalpy as expected by the large number of polar interactions in the peptide protein interface. Limitations in the sensitivity of standard radiolabel kinase assays made it difficult to accurately measure the atypically low Km value for Pimtide phosphorylation by Pim-1. We were able to determine this value to be below 100 nm and on the same order as the binding constant (Km = 34 ± 6 nm, n = 3). By comparison, the affinity of Pimtide for Pim-2 is somewhat weaker (0.64 μm), consistent with its higher reported Km value (1.2 μm) as a Pim-2 substrate (34Hutti J.E. Jarrell E.T. Chang J.D. Abbott D.W. Storz P. Toker A. Cantley L.C. Turk B.E. Nat. Methods. 2004; 1: 27-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Compared with Pimtide, the binding affinities for Pim-1 of phosphorylation site peptides derived from two Pim-1 substrates, p21WAF1/CIP1 and PAP-1, are approximately three orders of magnitude weaker. Likewise, ribosomal protein S6-derived peptides of similar length often used to assay Pim-1 activity have reported Km values ranging from 6-13 μm (33Palaty C.K. Clark-Lewis I. Leung D. Pelech S.L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). By comparison, other kinases in the CAMK group have Km values for optimized peptide substrates that are typically in the 5-10 μm range (51Ross H. Armstrong C.G. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 977-981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Determination of Pim kinase affinities for peptide substrates by ITC.

The major autophosphorylation site has been mapped to Ser-261(*) within the sequence RQRVSS*ECQHL, which conforms well to the Pim-1 consensus, containing arginine at both -5 and -3 (39Jacobs M.D. Black J. Futer O. Swenson L. Hare B. Fleming M. Saxena K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13728-13734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Following limited dephosphorylation with λ-phosphatase, this singly phosphorylated species can be resolved from fully dephosphorylated Pim-1 by Mono Q ion exchange chromatography. Autophosphorylation was followed in vitro using non-phosphorylated Pim-1 protein by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS, Fig. 3). A single autophosphorylation event was rapidly detected with a half-time of 5-10 min, and a second phosphorylation did not accumulate to more than ∼20% after 5-h incubation. Surprisingly, the major in vitro autophosphorylation site was not detected at Ser-261 but was mapped to Ser-8(*) in the unstructured protein N terminus within the sequence LSKINS*LAHLR by mass spectrometry (data not shown). To confirm this result the in vitro autophosphorylation was repeated using the singly Ser-261-phosphorylated Pim-1 protein. Identical phosphorylation kinetics were observed, indicating that Ser-261 phosphorylation may be an artifact of bacterial expression and that the Pim-1 N terminus may be a more likely authentic autophosphorylation site in vivo. Autophosphorylation during expression in bacteria is likely to occur in trans either co-translational"
https://openalex.org/W2096141745,"Gram-negative bacteria commonly interact with eukaryotic host cells by using type III secretion systems (TTSSs or secretons). TTSSs serve to transfer bacterial proteins into host cells. Two translocators, IpaB and IpaC, are first inserted with the aid of IpaD by Shigella into the host cell membrane. Then at least two supplementary effectors of cell invasion, IpaA and IpgD, are transferred into the host cytoplasm. How TTSSs are induced to secrete is unknown, but their activation appears to require direct contact of the external distal tip of the apparatus with the host cell. The extracellular domain of the TTSS is a hollow needle protruding 60 nm beyond the bacterial surface. The monomeric unit of the Shigella flexneri needle, MxiH, forms a superhelical assembly. To probe the role of the needle in the activation of the TTSS for secretion, we examined the structure-function relationship of MxiH by mutagenesis. Most point mutations led to normal needle assembly, but some led to polymerization or possible length control defects. In other mutants, secretion was constitutively turned ""on."" In a further set, it was ""constitutively on"" but experimentally ""uninducible."" Finally, upon induction of secretion, some mutants released only the translocators and not the effectors. Most types of mutants were defective in interactions with host cells. Together, these data indicate that the needle directly controls the activity of the TTSS and suggest that it may be used to ""sense"" host cells."

https://openalex.org/W2001751922,"PAK4 is a member of the group B family of p21-activated kinases. Its expression is elevated in many cancer cell lines, and activated PAK4 is highly transforming, suggesting that it plays an important role in tumorigenesis. Although most previous work was carried out with overexpressed PAK4, here we used RNA interference to knock down endogenous PAK4 in cancer cells. By studying PAK4 knockdown HeLa cells, we demonstrated that endogenous PAK4 is required for anchorage-independent growth. Because cell survival is a key part of tumorigenesis and anchorage-independent growth, we studied whether PAK4 has a role in protecting cells from cell death. To address this, we studied the role for PAK4 downstream to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α receptor. Although overexpressed PAK4 was previously shown to abrogate proapoptotic pathways, here we demonstrate that endogenous PAK4 is required for the full activation of prosurvival pathways induced by TNFα. Our results indicate that PAK4 is required for optimal binding of the scaffold protein TRADD to the activated TNFα receptor through both kinase-dependent and kinase-independent mechanisms. Consequently, activation of several prosurvival pathways, including the NFκB and ERK pathways, is reduced in the absence of PAK4. Interestingly, constitutive activation of the NFκB and ERK pathways could compensate for the lack of PAK4, indicating that these pathways function downstream to PAK4. The role for PAK4 in regulating prosurvival pathways is a completely new function for this protein, and the connection between PAK4 and cell survival under stress helps explain its role in tumorigenesis and development.

Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1860) Google Scholar). TNFα was also shown to play important roles in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation, inflammatory responses, and immune functions (1Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1860) Google Scholar, 2Baud V. Karin M.

Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which different signaling transduction pathways activated by TNFα interact with each other are only recently being defined.It is well established that binding of TNFα to the TNFR1 (TNFα receptor 1) on the cell membrane leads to activation of prosurvival pathways followed by proapoptosis pathways. According to recent models (4Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar), the prosurvival pathways are activated by a rapid recruitment of a protein complex, known as complex I, to the cytosolic portion of the activated TNFR1. Formation of complex I, including TNFR1, TRADD, RIP, and TRAF2 proteins, leads to activation of the NFκB pathway, as well as mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways such as the ERK, JNK, and p38 pathways (3Chen G. Goeddel D.V. Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). The NFκB pathway is considered to be the major prosurvival pathway (5Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar).The proapoptosis pathways are activated by a second complex, known as complex II or DISC (death-inducing signaling complex), which includes TRADD, RIP, and FADD proteins (4Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which complex I transitions to complex II is still not clear, and it is not certain whether TNFR1 is even included in complex II (4Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar, 6Schneider-Brachert W. Tchikov V. Neumeyer J. Jakob M. Winoto-Morbach S. Held-Feindt J. Heinrich M. Merkel O. Ehrenschwender M. Adam D. Mentlein R. Kabelitz D. Schutze S. Immunity. 2004; 21: 415-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). FADD is the essential component of this complex. FADD can recruit and activate the apoptosis initiators caspase 8 and 10, leading to the activation of two different apoptosis pathways (7Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3988) Google Scholar). The extrinsic mitochondria-independent apoptosis pathway is activated through directly cleavage and activation of executor caspases 3 and 7 by caspases 8 and 10. Activated caspases 3 and 7 then regulate the activities of target proteins that play important roles in various aspects of apoptosis (8Schultz D.R. Harrington Jr., W.J. Semin. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 32: 345-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The intrinsic mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathway is mediated by cleavage and activation of the Bcl-2 family protein BID by activated caspase 8 (9Li P. Nijhawan D. Wang X. Cell. 2004; 116: S57-S59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting cleaved BID translocates to mitochondria, where it interacts with other Bcl-2 family members to promote cytochrome c release (10Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3061) Google Scholar). Released cytochrome c leads to activation of caspase 9, followed by cleavage and activation of caspase 3 and apoptosis (9Li P. Nijhawan D. Wang X. Cell. 2004; 116: S57-S59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ivanov V.N. Bhoumik A. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3152-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).Upon activation of the TNFα receptor, the cell responds either by undergoing apoptosis or by activating survival pathways. For the cell to survive, full activation of the survival pathways triggered by complex I is critical. Activation of the NFκB pathway leads to increased expression of several antiapoptotic proteins such as FLIP and c-IAP, which can bind to complex II. If the NFκB pathway is fully activated and sufficient amounts of FLIP and C-IAP are presented in complex II, the activation of caspase 8 will be blocked, and the cell will survive (4Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar). Because the NFκB-mediated survival depends on the production of new proteins, it is disrupted by drugs such as the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). The combination of TNFα and CHX therefore favors activation of the apoptosis pathway, leading to cell death (4Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar).The p21-activated kinase family of serine/threonine kinases were originally identified as targets for the Rho GTPases Cdc42 and Rac (12Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Although originally identified as proteins that regulate cell morphology (13Eby J.J.

Biol. 1998; 8: 967-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the six mammalian PAKs have also been shown to play important roles in regulating cell survival and apoptosis. For example, apoptotic stimuli can induce rapid activation of full-length PAK2 to promote cell survival (14Jakobi R. Moertl E. Koeppel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16624-16634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). At later time points, PAK2 is also cleaved, probably by caspase 3, and the resulting activated fragment is associated with DNA fragmentation and membrane changes that occur during apoptosis (15Chan W.H. Yu J.S. Yang S.D. J. Protein Chem. 1998; 17: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). PAK1, PAK4, and PAK5 were also reported to protect cells from apoptosis by directly phosphorylating the proapoptotic protein Bad (16Schurmann A. Mooney A.F. Sanders L.C. Sells M.A. Wang H.G.

Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E.

PAK4 has important roles in embryonic development, and deletion of PAK4 in mice leads to embryonic lethality, along with defects in both cardiac and neural development (21Qu J. Li X. Novitch B.G.

In cultured cells, PAK4 regulates cell adhesion, cytoskeletal organization, and transformation (22Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 23Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Shi Q. Ha K.C. de Lanerolle P. Minden A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3523-3533Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Overexpression of wild type or activated PAK4 was shown to protect cells from apoptosis induced by UV irradiation and serum withdrawal. This is associated with direct phosphorylation and inactivation of BAD by PAK4 (19Gnesutta N. Qu J. Minden A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14414-14419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Overexpressed PAK4 also protects cells from apoptosis induced by a fusion of TNFR1 and the Fas receptor. In this case the protective response appears to be kinase-independent and is associated with an abrogation of the recruitment and activation of caspase 8 to DISC (24Gnesutta N. Minden A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7838-7848Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).Although PAK4 is expressed at low levels in most normal tissues, PAK4 mRNA levels are greatly up-regulated in many cancer cell lines from various origins (25Callow M.G. Clairvoyant F. Zhu S. Schryver B. Whyte D.B. Bischoff J.R. Jallal B. Smeal T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 550-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). This led us to study whether PAK4 is important for oncogenesis and cell survival in cancer cells. Whereas our previous work was carried out in cell lines that overexpress exogenous PAK4, here we took advantage of RNAi technology to knock down endogenous PAK4 expression in a cancer cell line that expresses high levels of PAK4. We found that endogenous PAK4 is required for anchorage-independent growth and for the full activation of the survival pathways induced by TNFα in HeLa cells. Specifically, we found that PAK4 is required for optimal binding of TRADD to the activated TNFα receptor. The kinase activity is not absolutely required but can further enhance the interaction between TNFα and TRADD. Consequently, activation of the NFκB pathway by TNFα was reduced in the absence of PAK4, as well as the ERK and JNK pathways. Interestingly, constitutive activation of the NFκB and ERK pathways could over-ride the loss of PAK4 and restore cell survival, indicating that these pathways operate downstream to PAK4. Thus, PAK4 acts not only as a direct inhibitor of the proapoptotic pathway, but it is also required for the activation of the survival pathways. Because increased cell survival is an important part of oncogenesis, our results help explain why PAK4 is highly transforming and why its expression is associated with oncogenic transformation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfections—HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. All of the media were supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 4 mm glutamine. 1.5 μg/ml puromycin was added for stable cell lines. Transient transfection assays were carried out in HeLa cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation or Lipofectamine method.Construction of PAK4 Knockdown Stable Cell Lines—Two small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides were synthesized to target two different regions in the PAK4 cDNA: PAK4-RNAi-1 targeting a linker region between the regulatory domain and the kinase domain AACTTCATCAAGATTGGCGAG and PAK4-RNAi-2 targeting a sequence within the kinase domain AACGAGGTGGTAATCATGAGG. Transient transfection of both siRNAs could disrupt PAK4 expression in HeLa cells, whereas a scrambled double-stranded RNA did not affect PAK4 expression.pSuper vector was kindly provided by the lab of Dr. Ron Prywes, and 64-mer oligonucleotide DNA nucleotides targeting the same region as PAK4-RNAi-1 were designed according to the specifications recommended (26Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3941) Google Scholar) and synthesized by Invitrogen. pSuper-PAK4 was constructed by ligation of the annealed nucleotides into the BgII and Hin-dIII sites of the pSuper vector. Stable cell lines were made by co-transfection of pSuper or pSuper-PAK4 together with the pLPC vector (containing a puromycin-resistant gene) into HeLa cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. The cells were selected with puromycin (1.5 μg/ml), and the colonies were picked ∼2 weeks after selection. 20 clones from both transfections were picked, and expression of PAK4 was determined by Western blot. The expression of PAK4 was successfully knocked down in 4 of the 20 clones from the pSuper-PAK4 transfection.Reagents and Antibodies—Human recombinant TNFα and goat polyclonal anti-TNFR1 antibody were from R & D Systems. CHX was from Sigma. Mouse anti-human PARP, anti-phospho-SAPK/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) (G9), anti-phospho-p44/42 (Thr202/Tyr204) E10, anti-BID, and anti-caspase 8 (1C12) antibody were from New England Biolabs. Mouse anti-TNFR1 (H-5), rabbit anti-IκBα (C-21), anti-IKKα, and anti-ERK2 antibody were from Santa Cruz; mouse anti-TRADD (clone 37) and anti-RIP (clone 38) were from BD Transduction Labs. Rabbit anti-phosphorylated IκBα (pS32pS36) was from BIOSOURCE International. Mouse anti-human JNK1 antibody was from Pharmingen. Secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were from Sigma.Growth Curve—To estimate the growth rate of stably transfected cell lines, equal numbers of each stable cell line were seeded in growth medium in six-well plates. Each day after the seeding, one set of cells was collected using trypsin and counted. Each point on the curve is the average of three duplicates.Flow Cytometry—After UV or TNFα+CHX treatment, both floating and attached cells were collected by low speed centrifugation, washed in PBS, and fixed in ice-cold methanol for overnight. The cells were then stained with propidium iodide (50 mg/ml) in the presence of 50 mg/ml RNase A for 30 min at room temperature. The DNA content indicated by propidium iodide staining was analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson).Apoptosis Assay—For the apoptosis assay, equal numbers of cells were seeded in 6-cm plates. For TNFα-CHX treatment, the cells were washed once with PBS, and then medium containing 10 ng/ml TNFα and 10 μg/ml CHX either alone or together were added. For UV irradiation, the cells were washed twice with PBS and then exposed to 50 J/m2 UV light in a UV cross-linker (Fisher) followed by the addition of fresh medium. After stimulation the cells were collected at the indicated time points (both attached and floating dead cells unless otherwise indicated). Two different methods were used to quantify the apoptosis level in the treated cells: quantitation of the sub-G1 population using FACS analysis and the detection of the 85-kDa proteolytic product of PARP by Western blot. The percentage of the PARP cleavage was quantified using NIH Image J.Soft Agar Assay—2 ml of 0.6% Bacto agar in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and glutamine was plated into six-well plates. Stable cell lines suspended in 2 ml of 0.3% Bacto agar in the same medium were seeded into these six-well plates at 5,000 or 10,000 cells/well. Each cell line was tested in duplicates. After 2-3 weeks, the colonies were visualized under an inverted light microscope. Digital pictures were also taken for each well, and the number and size of the colonies were measured using NIH Image J.TdT-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling Assays—Wild type and PAK4 knockout embryos were obtained as shown previously (21Qu J. Li X. Novitch B.G. Zheng Y. Kohn M. Xie J.-M. Kozinn S. Bronson R. Beg A.A. Minden A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7122-7133Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining was performed on paraffin-embedded sections using an ApopTag peroxidase in situ apoptosis detection kit (Integrin), according to the manual from the manufacturer.Immunoprecipitation—The immunoprecipitation protocol was adapted from those as described previously (24Gnesutta N. Minden A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7838-7848Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 27Funakoshi-Tago M. Sonoda Y. Tanaka S. Hashimoto K. Tago K. Tominaga S. Kasahara T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29359-29365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were washed by cold PBS twice before being lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA), supplemented with proteinase and phosphatase inhibitors (2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4). The cell lysates were collected, rotated at 4 °C for an hour, and cleaned by centrifugation to obtain whole cell extracts. For immunoprecipitation, 50 μl of protein G-agarose slurry (Santa Cruz) preloaded with antibodies or goat serum was added to equal amounts of cell extracts and rotated overnight at 4 °C. The immune complexes were precipitated by centrifugation, washed two times with lysis buffer, then washed one time with lysis buffer plus 250 mm NaCl, and then washed two times again with lysis buffer. The precipitated proteins were denatured in SDS loading buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and analyzed by Western blotting. The results of the Western blots were quantified using NIH Image J.For the PAK4 rescue experiments, control and PAK4 knockdown (RNAi) cells were left untreated (0 min) or treated with TNFα+CHX for 5 min. Equal amounts of cell lysate were combined with equal amount of lysate from HeLa cells stably overexpressing hemagglutinin-tagged wild type PAK4 (PAK4WT) (19Gnesutta N. Qu J. Minden A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14414-14419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), Myc-tagged kinase-dead PAK4 (PAK4KM) (24Gnesutta N. Minden A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7838-7848Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), or Myc-tagged constitutively active PAK4 (PAK4NE) (19Gnesutta N. Qu J. Minden A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14414-14419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of the cell lysates were then incubated with protein G-agarose beads loaded with anti-TNFR1 antibody. TRADD protein bound to the TNFR1 was analyzed by Western blot and was also quantified using NIH Image J. The expression levels of TRADD protein in lysates from the HeLa cells stably overexpressing wild type PAK4 (PAK4WT), kinase-dead PAK4 (PAK4KM), or constitutively active PAK4 (PAK4NE) and from the control and PAK4-RNAi cells was assessed by Western blot. The blots were also probed with PAK4 antibody to show the expression of endogenous PAK4, as well as hemagglutinin-tagged PAK4WT, Myc-tagged PAK4NE, and Myc-tagged PAK4KM.Western Blot Analysis—Western blots were carried out as described in Ref. 28Li X. Minden A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7134-7142Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar. The results of the Western blots were quantified using NIH Image J.RESULTSPAK4 Is Required for Anchorage-independent Growth in HeLa Cells— Overexpression of activated PAK4 has been shown to induce anchorage-independent growth on soft agar (23Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Shi Q. Ha K.C. de Lanerolle P. Minden A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3523-3533Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 25Callow M.G. Clairvoyant F. Zhu S. Schryver B. Whyte D.B. Bischoff J.R. Jallal B. Smeal T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 550-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). To determine whether endogenous PAK4 is also required for anchorage-independent growth in cancer cell lines, we used siRNA to knockdown PAK4 expression in HeLa cells. HeLa cells were chosen because they are an example of a cancer cell line (derived from a cervical carcinoma) expressing high levels of PAK4 (25Callow M.G. Clairvoyant F. Zhu S. Schryver B. Whyte D.B. Bischoff J.R. Jallal B. Smeal T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 550-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Two siRNAs were synthesized to target two different regions in the PAK4 cDNA: PAK4-RNAi-1 (AACTTCATCAAGATTGGCGAG) targeting a linker region between the regulatory domain and kinase domain and PAK4-RNAi-2 (AACGAGGTGGTAATCATGAGG) targeting a sequence within the kinase domain. Transient transfection of both siRNAs could disrupt PAK4 protein expression in HeLa cells, whereas a scrambled double-stranded RNA did not affect PAK4 expression, as shown by Western blot in Fig. 1A.An expression vector (pSuper-PAK4) targeting the same region as PAK4-RNAi-1 was constructed and used to generate stable cell lines. Expression of PAK4 in control (empty vector alone) or PAK4 knockdown (pSuper-PAK4) HeLa cell lines was assessed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 1B, the expression of PAK4 was successfully knocked down in cells containing pSuper-PAK4 (subsequently referred to as PAK4 knockdown cells), whereas the control pSuper vector alone did not affect PAK4 expression. PAK1 and PAK2 expression levels were not affected by the PAK4 RNAi (Fig. 1B).Wild type HeLa cells, control stable cell lines, and PAK4 knockdown cells were plated on soft agar. After 2 weeks, PAK4 knockdown stable cells formed significantly fewer and smaller clones on soft agar compared with control cells, as shown in Fig. 1C and as quantified in TABLE ONE. These data indicate that PAK4 plays an essential role in the anchorage-independent growth of HeLa cells. To determine whether the decreased growth in soft agar was due to an overall decrease in growth rate, we analyzed the growth rate of PAK4 knockdown versus wild type cells under normal growth conditions. As shown in Fig. 1D, PAK4 knockdown cells grew at the same rate as the control cells. Likewise, the PAK4 knockdown cells had the same profile of G1, G2, and S phase, as indicated by FACS data (Fig. 1E), which indicates that the PAK4 knockdown cells had no defects in cell growth or progression through the cell cycle under normal conditions.TABLE ONEStatistics of the soft agar assay Shown are the sizes and numbers of colonies formed when testing for anchorage-independent growth in control cells (transfected with empty vector) and PAK4 knockdown (RNAi) cells (clones 1 and 20). Colonies/one 6-well plate were counted for each experiment.

Overexpression of PAK4 was previously shown to protect cells from apoptosis (24Gnesutta N. Minden A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7838-7848Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Furthermore, deletion of PAK4 in mice leads to a pronounced increase in apoptosis in certain parts of the PAK4 knockout embryos (21Qu J. Li X. Novitch B.G. Zheng Y. Kohn M. Xie J.-M. Kozinn S. Bronson R. Beg A.A. Minden A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7122-7133Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This suggests that PAK4 is required for protecting cells from apoptosis in some tissues during development.To determine whether PAK4 is also required for protecting cancer cells from apoptosis, knockdown and control cells were treated with either TNFα+CHX or UV irradiation. Results from FACS analysis indicate that there were more sub-G1 (apoptotic) cells in the PAK4 knockdown cells compared with the control cells after 4 h of TNFα+CHX treatment (Fig. 2A). Likewise, PAK4 knockdown cells were also more sensitive to UV-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2A). We also analyzed another apoptosis indicator, the cleavage of PARP protein by the executor caspase 3. Western blot analysis indicates that PARP cleavage occurred earlier in the PAK4 knockdown cells, as indicated in Fig. 2B. The cleavage states of apoptosis initiator caspase 8 and its downstream effector BID were also analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 2C, both caspase 8 and BID were cleaved and activated earlier in PAK4 knockdown cells compared with the control cells. Our results indicate that the absence of PAK4 leads to an earlier onset of apoptosis, indicating that PAK4 plays an essential and early role in protecting cells from cell death.FIGURE 2PAK4 knockdown cells are more sensitive to both UV- and TNFα+CHX-induced apoptosis. A, quantitation of the sub-G1 population after TNFα+CHX or UV treatment. Control and PAK4 knockdown (RNAi) cells were treated with TNFα+CHX or UV to induce apoptosis. The cells were collected 4 h after treatment and then fixed and stained with propidium iodide. DNA content was analyzed by FACS flow cytometry. The percentage of the apoptotic cells (sub-G1 population) in response to TNFα+CHX or UV treatment is shown. PAK4 knockdown cells were more sensitive to both UV and TNFα+CHX induced apoptosis. B, PARP cleavage occurs earlier in PAK4 knockdown cells compared with control cells, following TNFα+CHX treatment. Control and PAK4 knockdown (RNAi) cells were left untreated (0 h) or treated with TNFα+CHX for 2, 3, or 4 h to induce apoptosis. Whole cell lysates was then analyzed by Western blot. The same blot was probed with anti-actin antibody as a loading control. The cleavage of PARP was quantified using NIH Image J, and the percentages of cleaved PARP in three experiments were averaged and plotted. PARP is cleaved earlier in the PAK4 knockdown cells. C, caspase 8 and BID cleavage occur earlier in PAK4 knockdown cells upon TNFα+CHX treatment.

Here we report the x-ray crystal structure of KaiB from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1. The KaiB crystal diffracts at a resolution of 2.6 Å and includes four subunits organized as a dimer of dimers, each composed of two non-equivalent subunits. The overall shape of the tetramer is an elongated hexagonal plate, with a single positively charged cleft flanked by two negatively charged ridges whose surfaces includes several terminal chains. Site-directed mutagenesis of Synechococcus KaiB confirmed that alanine substitution of residues Lys-11 or Lys-43 in the cleft, or deletion of C-terminal residues 95–108, which forms part of the ridges, strongly weakens in vivo circadian rhythms. Characteristics of KaiB deduced from the x-ray crystal structure were also confirmed by physicochemical measurements of KaiB in solution. These data suggest that the positively charged cleft and flanking negatively charged ridges in KaiB are essential for the biological function of KaiB in the circadian molecular machinery in cyanobacteria.

Cell. 1999; 96: 271-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar). Cyanobacteria are the simplest organisms that exhibit circadian rhythms, and the circadian clock gene cluster, kaiABC, is essential for circadian rhythms in cyanobacteria such as Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 (hereafter called Synechococcus) (2Ishiura M.

KaiB from T. elongatus was chosen for this study because proteins from this thermophilic cyanobacterium tend to be highly stable. Furthermore, efficient procedures for gene transfer and manipulation in T. elongatus (17Onai K. Morishita M. Kaneko T. Tabata S. Ishiura M. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2004; 271: 50-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have recently been developed and circadian rhythms in T. elongatus have been characterized (18Onai K. Morishita M. Itoh S.

We report here the 2.6 Å x-ray crystal structure of T. elongatus KaiB, which reveals that KaiB is an unusual tetramer, composed of two asymmetrical dimers, that assumes the shape of an elongated hexagonal plate. The tetramer has a positively charged cleft flanked by two negatively charged ridges, suggesting that the cleft may play a role in ligand binding. The solution structure of KaiB was analyzed by gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation, and the presence of functional substructures in KaiB was tested by site-directed mutagenesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—T. elongatus KaiB and KaiB T64C were expressed and purified as described previously (19Iwase R.

The protein was purified by ion-exchange chromatography on a DEAE-cellulose column (Wako), a Q-Sepharose High Performance column (Amersham Biosciences), and a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences).Structure Determination—The details of crystallization and data collection have been previously described (19Iwase R. Imada K. Hayashi F. Uzumaki T. Namba K. Ishiura M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 727-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The KaiB crystals belonged to the monoclinic space group P21, with unit-cell dimensions a = 90.0, b = 67.0, c = 105.8 Å, and β = 101.3°. The T64C crystals belonged to the monoclinic space group P2 with unit-cell dimensions a = 63.7, b = 33.4, c = 93.7 Å, and β = 100.1°. The diffraction data were collected at SPring-8 beamlines, BL41XU and BL38B1, and the statistics of the diffraction data were reported previously (19Iwase R. Imada K. Hayashi F. Uzumaki T. Namba K. Ishiura M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 727-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Initial phase was calculated from multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data of the osmium-derivative crystals of KaiB using the SOLVE program (20Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). After density modification, the protein backbone was traced using the graphics program O (21Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar), but only 50% of the molecule could be constructed due to the low quality of the obtained map. To improve the map, experimental phase was combined with the partial model phase, and after several iterations of model building and phase improvement, >90% of the molecule was built. Because the T64C crystal showed higher diffraction limit, the model was used to solve the crystal structure of T64C using the molecular replacement method with the program MOLREP (22Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar). By using the dimer model as a search model, we obtained the best solution with a correlation coefficient of 0.487 and an R-factor of 0.478. We refined the model using X-PLOR (23Brünger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar) and, for the final stage, REFMAC5 (22Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar). We randomly selected 5% of the reflections and set them aside as a test set for cross-validation. During the refinement process, we performed manual modification using “omit map.” The refinement converged to an R-factor of 22.7% and a free R-factor of 28.9% for all data at a resolution of 2.6 Å. The final model contained 404 residues and 93 solvent atoms. A Ramachandran plot showed 86.5% and 13.5% residues located in the most favorable and allowed region, respectively.

For T64C, 1 mm dithiothreitol was included in the elution buffer. Bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa) were used as molecular mass standards. Proteins were detected at A280.Chemical Cross-linking Experiments—Chemical cross-linking experiments were performed as previously described (15Hayashi F. Suzuki H. Iwase R. Uzumaki T. Miyake A. Shen J.R. Imada K. Furukawa Y. Yonekura K. Namba K. Ishiura M. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A total of 6 μg of KaiB was incubated at 25 °C with 20 mm 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (Pierce) and 20 mm N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (Pierce) in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.15 m NaCl. After 0, 15, 60, or 120 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol at final concentrations of 333 mm and 6.7 mm, respectively. Then the products were precipitated by addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 6% (v/v), collected by centrifugation, and dissolved in 10 μl of a solution containing 6 m urea, 1% SDS, 0.22 mm bromphenol blue, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). The reaction products were subjected to SDS-PAGE according to the Weber-Osborn method (24Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stained with a Silver Stain Kit (Wako). Low Molecular Weight Marker (Amersham Biosciences) was used as a molecular size marker.Analytical Ultracentrifugation—The molecular weight of KaiB was determined by sedimentation equilibrium analysis at 20 °C on an Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman) with various rotation speeds, using 0.49 or 0.73 mg/ml KaiB in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl. The molecular mass was analyzed using the program Optima TM XL-A/XLI version 4.0 (Beckman).In Vitro Mutagenesis, Gene Transfer, and in Vivo Rhythm Assay—We mutated kaiB genes by PCR-mediated site-directed in vitro mutagenesis and introduced them into TS2 in the genomes of a kaiB-null strain of Synechococcus carrying a PkaiBC::luxAB reporter gene (2Ishiura M.

We measured the circadian bioluminescence rhythms of the transformed cells as previously described (5Uzumaki T. Fujita M. Nakatsu T. Hayashi F. Shibata H. Itoh N. Kato H. Ishiura M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 7: 623-631Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18Onai K. Morishita M. Itoh S. Okamoto K. Ishiura M. J.

Biochem. 2005; 340: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).For in vivo rhythm assay in T. elongatus, we replaced the kaiABC loci and its downstream tlr0484 locus (17Onai K. Morishita M. Kaneko T. Tabata S. Ishiura M. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2004; 271: 50-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) in the genome of a T. elongatus carrying a PpsbA1::Xl luxAB reporter gene (18Onai K. Morishita M. Itoh S. Okamoto K. Ishiura M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4972-4977Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) with a DNA segment containing both the T. elongatus kaiABC loci whose kaiB gene was mutated and a Cm-selective marker gene (17Onai K. Morishita M. Kaneko T. Tabata S. Ishiura M. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2004; 271: 50-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) inserted into the tlr0484 gene by homologous recombination (17Onai K. Morishita M. Kaneko T. Tabata S. Ishiura M. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2004; 271: 50-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, the tlr0484 gene was disrupted in the transformed cells carrying the mutated kaiB gene. We measured the bioluminescence rhythms of the transformed cells at 41 °C as described previously (18Onai K. Morishita M. Itoh S. Okamoto K. Ishiura M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4972-4977Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).Measurement of the CD 4The abbreviation used is: ! CDcircular dichroism. Spectra of KaiB—CD spectra were determined using a spectropolarimeter equipped with a thermally jacketed quartz cuvette of a 1-mm path length (Jasco JA-720W). The CD spectra of KaiB (10 μm) were determined at 25 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl over a wavelength range of 200–270 nm.RESULTSX-ray Crystal Structure of the KaiB Tetramer: A Dimer of Dimers—KaiB is highly conserved among twelve cyanobacterial species, with the exception of a short C-terminal region (Fig. 1). KaiB from T. elongatus consists of 108 amino acid residues and has a deduced molecular mass of 12,025 Da. T. elongatus KaiB was crystallized (see “Experimental Procedures”), and the protein structure was determined at 2.6 Å by x-ray crystallography. The asymmetric unit of the KaiB crystal contains four KaiB monomers (labeled A–D in Fig. 2A). The final model includes Lys-6 to Ala-101 for subunit A, Leu-4 to Glu-108 for subunit B, Ala-2 to Ala-101 for subunit C, and Arg-5 to Leu-107 for subunit D. Subunits A and B and subunits C and D form two independent dimers (AB and CD), respectively, in each of which subunits are related by local 2-fold symmetry. Each of these two dimers, AB and CD, has a partner dimer related by a crystallographic 2-fold axis forming tetramers T1 (ABA′B′) and T2 (CDC′D′), respectively (Fig. 2A). These two tetramers are essentially identical, except for the N- and C-terminal regions of the A (A′) and C (C′) subunits (Fig. 2, A and C). Subunits A and B in tetramer T1 correspond, respectively, to subunits C and D in tetramer T2. The tetramer forms a slightly deformed, elongated hexagonal plate with a size of ∼85 × 60 × 30 Å. The local 2-fold symmetry axes, which run approximately perpendicular to the crystallographic 2-fold axis, do not intersect the crystallographic 2-fold axis; thereby the four subunits are not equivalent in contrast to usual tetrameric structures. But each tetramer has two pairs of equivalent subunits: A-A′ (C-C′) and B-B′ (D-D′) (Fig. 2A). The environments of subunits A and B are completely different. Subunit A interacts directly with B and B′ but not with A′, whereas subunit B is in close contact with all the other subunits in the tetramer (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2X-ray crystal structure of KaiB tetramer. A, crystal packing of KaiB represented as a Cα backbone diagram. Each asymmetric unit of the crystal of the mutant KaiB T64C contained two independent dimers (AB and CD). Each dimer formed a tetramer (T1 and T2) with a crystallographic 2-fold axis (black oval). Molecules related by crystallographic 2-fold axes are indicated by the same color. Other tetramers (pale gray) were also generated by the crystallographic symmetry. The black frame indicates a unit cell. B, structure of KaiB monomer represented as a ribbon diagram. Helices and strands are shown in orange and green, respectively. C, comparison of the structures of four independent KaiB subunits in the asymmetric unit. Cα traces of all four subunits are superimposed in stereo diagram. Subunits A, B, C, and D are shown in green, orange, cyan, and blue, respectively. The figures were generated with MOLSCRIPT (28Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and Raster3D (29Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3869) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The globular core of the KaiB subunit (Tyr-8 to Tyr-94) has a two-layer α/β sandwich structure consisting of three β strands (β1, β2, and β4) and three α helices (α1, α2, and α3) (Fig. 2B). This region adopts a novel fold that has not been reported previously. A β-sheet comprising parallel strands β1 and β2 and anti-parallel strand β4 forms a wall on one side, while anti-parallel helices α1, α2, and α3 form a wall on the other side (Fig. 2B). The chain connecting β2 and α2 forms an L-shaped loop (Val-47 to Ala-61) that includes β3, which extends away from the core structure (Fig. 2B). β3 extends almost perpendicular to the core β-sheet and contributes to dimer formation by forming an intersubunit anti-parallel β-strand. The core structures of the four independent subunits in an asymmetric unit can be superimposed with root mean square displacements of 0.52–0.65 Å for corresponding Cα atoms (Fig. 2C).In contrast to the core structure, both N- and C-terminal regions show large conformational variation. Subunits B and D, which are located in an equivalent position in each tetramer, exhibit similar N- and C-terminal structures (Fig. 2C). Their C-terminal regions from Tyr 94 fold back onto the surface of the core structure, making a loop and forming a short β-turn-β structure (β5 and β6) in the last stretch from Ala-101, while their N-terminal regions run along these C-terminal chains, although the first three or four residues are missing (Fig. 2, B and C). However, subunits A and C, which are also located in an equivalent position in each tetramer, have distinctly different terminal chain conformations from subunits B and D. Although the C-terminal chain of subunit A folds back in a conformation similar to subunits B and D, the C-terminal seven residues, which would form the short β-turn-β motif, is not visible and the N-terminal chain appears to extend away from the C-terminal chain, although the first five residues are not visible. The terminal chains of subunit C extend away from the core (Fig. 2, A and C), where the N-terminal chain is visible from Ala-2, whereas the C-terminal seven residues are not visible. The conformational variability of the terminal chains is displayed graphically in Fig. 2C. These data suggest that the N- and C-terminal regions of KaiB have significant flexibility and adaptability, and these regions may play important roles in the physiological function of KaiB.Intra- and Interdimer Interfaces—The KaiB tetramer is a dimer of the dimeric unit AB or CD for tetramers T1 and T2, respectively (Fig. 2A). The dimer-dimer subunit interface is shown graphically in Fig. 3A, and the monomer-monomer interface (within each dimer) is shown graphically in Fig. 3B. The interactions between subunits A and B and subunits C and D are tight. The AB interface is formed by an N-terminal segment of β4, a C-terminal segment of β1, and the L-shaped loop involving β3 (Fig. 3B). This interface is mostly hydrophobic involving Ala-15, Val-47, Leu-48, Pro-51, Leu-53, Ile-59, and Ile-88 (Fig. 3B), unlike the surrounding edges, which are more hydrophilic. Strand β3 runs on one edge of this interface, and β3 strands from the dimer subunits (AB or CD) form an intersubunit antiparallel β strand interaction at the center of slightly concaved surface of the dimer. Subunit B′ (D′)of the A′B′ (C′D′) dimer binds tightly to this surface (Fig. 3A). The other two edges of this dimer interface also have some intersubunit hydrogen bonds. Thus, many hydrogen bonds on the edges enclose the hydrophobic interface, suggesting that this dimer interaction is highly stable in solution and in the intracellular environment.FIGURE 3Molecular interfaces in KaiB tetramer. A, inter-dimer interface. B, intra-dimer interface. Interfaces are displayed by dividing a tetramer into two dimers in A, and each dimer into two monomers (B) by translation and rotation. Molecules are displayed in Corey-Pauling-Koltan representation with atoms involved in the intermolecular interactions (within an intermolecular atomic distance of 5 Å) color-coded as follows: red, charged oxygen; pink, polar oxygen; blue, charged nitrogen; light blue, polar nitrogen; yellow, carbon; and green, sulfur. The figures were generated with MOLSCRIPT (28Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and Raster3D (29Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3869) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The dimer-dimer interface (AB-A′B′ or CD-C′D′) is comprised of three segments of subunit A or C (β3, α2, and a C-terminal segment of β4) and four segments of subunit B or D (an N-terminal segment of β1, a C-terminal segment of β4, the loop connecting α1 to β2, and a relatively long segment from β3 to the N terminus of α3). This interface is more hydrophilic than the monomer interface (Fig. 3A). However, the dimer-dimer interface is extensive and includes several hydrophobic side chain interactions. In addition, the surface area of this interface is larger than the monomer interface, burying 26.5% of the total surface area of the four subunits of KaiB. This suggests that the tetramer structure is highly stable in solution and in the intracellular environment. It may also indicate that the KaiB tetramer has an important biological function.KaiB Tetramer in Solution—The structure of KaiB was also studied in solution using gel filtration chromatography, chemical cross-linking, and analytical ultracentrifugation. KaiB eluted as a single peak during gel filtration chromatography with an apparent molecular mass of 55 kDa, which corresponds to the molecular mass of a tetramer or pentamer (Fig. 4A). The gel filtration elution profile was the same for KaiB without or with the five residue N-terminal tag, which was added to the recombinant protein used for crystallography (Fig. 4A). This suggests that native KaiB is structurally similar to recombinant KaiB. When KaiB was cross-linked with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and the reaction products analyzed by SDS-PAGE, the relative density of the KaiB tetramer increased with increasing incubation time (Fig. 4B). Sedimentation equilibrium analysis confirmed that KaiB is a tetramer with approximate molecular mass of 48.6 kDa. The residual plot for the tetramer model curve fitted to the sedimentation profile showed that higher order association and dissociation does not occur under physiological conditions (Fig. 4C). Similar experiments with Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 (hereafter called Anabaena) KaiB confirmed that Anabaena KaiB also exists as tetramer in solution (Fig. 5). This result is not in agreement with a previous report that Anabaena KaiB migrates as a dimer during gel filtration (12Garces R.G. Wu N. Gillon W. Pai E.F. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1688-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The reason for this discrepancy is not known.FIGURE 4Measurements of the oligomeric state of KaiB.

https://openalex.org/W2036902401,"MthK is a Ca2+-gated K+ channel from Methanobacterium autotrophicum. The crystal structure of the MthK channel in a Ca2+-bound open state was previously determined at 3.3 Å and revealed an octameric gating ring composed of eight intracellular ligand-binding RCK (regulate the conductance of K+) domains. It was suggested that Ca2+ binding regulates the gating ring conformation, which in turn leads to the opening and closing of the channel. However, at 3.3 AÅ resolution, the molecular details of the structure are not well defined, and many of the conclusions drawn from that structure were hypothetical. Here we have presented high resolution structures of the MthK RCK domain with and without Ca2+ bound from three different crystals. These structures revealed a dimeric architecture of the RCK domain and allowed us to visualize the Ca2+ binding and protein-protein contacts at atomic detail. The dimerization of RCK domains is also conserved in other RCK-regulated K+ channels and transporters, suggesting that the RCK dimer serves as a basic unit in the gating ring assembly. A comparison of these dimer structures confirmed that the dimer interface is indeed flexible as suggested previously. However, the conformational change at the flexible interface is of an extent smaller than the previously hypothesized gating ring movement, and a reconstruction of these dimers into octamers by applying protein-protein contacts at the fixed interface did not generate enclosed gating rings. This indicated that there is a high probability that the previously defined fixed interface may not be fixed during channel gating. In addition to the structural studies, we have also carried out biochemical analyses and have shown that near physiological pH, isolated RCK domains form a stable octamer in solution, supporting the notion that the formation of octameric gating ring is a functionally relevant event in MthK gating. Additionally, our stability studies indicated that Ca2+ binding stabilizes the RCK domains in this octameric state. MthK is a Ca2+-gated K+ channel from Methanobacterium autotrophicum.

Additionally, our stability studies indicated that Ca2+ binding stabilizes the RCK domains in this octameric state. Potassium channels control the flow of K+ across the cell membrane and are ubiquitously expressed in nearly all organisms (1Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2001; (3rd Ed., Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA)Google Scholar). One of the basic properties of K+ channels is gating, the opening and closing of the channel in response to external stimuli. These stimuli may be changes in membrane potential (voltage gating) or ligand binding (ligand gating). Each kind of ligand gives rise to a ligand-gated K+ channel with a specific structure for ligand binding. Ligands can be small ions such as Ca2+ in high conductance Ca2+-gated K+ channels (2Magleby K.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 81-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), small molecules such as ATP in KATP channels (3Ashcroft S.J. Ashcroft F.M. Cell. Signal. 1990; 2: 197-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), or large proteins such as the G protein βγ subunits in G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channels (4Wickman K. Clapham D.E. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 865-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Despite the structural diversity required for different ligands, most ligand-binding domains in K+ channels are located at the C terminus of the pore, close to the end of the pore-lining inner helix. This common position suggests a general mechanism used to convert the chemical energy of ligand binding to the mechanical work of opening the channel. The majority of prokaryotic ligand-gated K+ channels are regulated by a conserved, C-terminal ligand-binding domain known as the RCK domain. This domain was first characterized based on the crystal structure of the cytoplasmic domain of an Escherichia coli K+ channel (5Jiang Y. Pico A. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 2001; 29: 593-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The structure revealed the RCK domain to be an α/β protein with a structure similar to many dehydrogenase enzymes. The isolated RCK domain forms a homodimer with a bilobed architecture. The lobe of each RCK domain has a Rossmann fold, and dimerization produces a deep cleft between two lobes with potential ligand-binding sites within the cleft. RCK domains are also found in some bacterial K+ uptake and efflux machinery such as the Trk system (6Schlosser A. Hamann A. Bossemeyer D. Schneider E. Bakker E.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 7Parra-Lopez C. Lin R. Aspedon A. Groisman E.A.

Guy H.R. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 775-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), in which this domain is referred to as a KTN (K+ transport, nucleotide binding) domain (10Roosild T.P. Miller S. Booth I.R. Choe S. Cell. 2002; 109: 781-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Some RCK domains have a conserved sequence motif (GXGXXG... (D/E)) for NAD+ binding (11Bellamacina C.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), but others do not, reflecting the diversity of ligands for RCK domains. A structure-based sequence alignment and mutagenesis studies have shown that RCK domains also exist at the intracellular C-terminal side of the eukaryotic high conductance Ca2+-gated K+ channels (BK or maxiK) (5Jiang Y. Pico A. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 2001; 29: 593-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 12Pico A. Ph.D. thesis. 2003; (The Rockefeller University)Google Scholar). The wide distribution of RCK domains in K+ channels and transporters indicates their importance in regulating the flow of K+ ions across the cell membrane. The ligand for and physiological function of the E. coli K+ channel are still unclear, and the structure of the E. coli RCK domain provides only limited information on its role in regulating channel function. The structure of the MthK channel, another RCK-regulated K+ channel, provides some important insights into understanding the RCK-regulated gating mechanism (13Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). MthK is a tetrameric K+ channel from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum that can be activated by Ca2+. Each MthK subunit has two membrane-spanning segments that together form the ion conduction pore and an RCK domain at the C terminus. The x-ray structure of the MthK channel in a ligand (Ca2+)-bound open state suggested that the functional channel requires eight RCK domains to form an octameric gating ring on the intracellular side of the pore. Four RCK domains are covalently linked to the pore, and four additional RCK domains, co-expressed from the MthK gene using an alternative internal start site (Met-107), are co-assembled in the cytosol. Ca2+ binding is thought to cause conformational changes in the gating ring that then lead to the opening of the pore. Two distinct protein interfaces between the MthK RCK domains hold the octameric gating ring together. Based on a structural comparison between RCK domains from the MthK channel and the E. coli K+ channel, one dimer interface was suggested to be flexible, and the other was suggested to be fixed (13Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). The protein-protein contacts at the putative fixed interface are formed by three hydrophobic residues on the external face of helix αD. These three residues are either hydrophobic or aromatic among all RCK domains but not among other Rossmann folded proteins. The protein contacts at the putative flexible interface are more extensive, involving a helix-turn-helix (αF-turn-αG) interlock and a C-terminal subdomain that protrudes out from the gating ring. Although the structure of the open MthK channel provides some crucial insights into RCK-regulated gating in K+ channels, many fundamental questions remain unanswered. Most importantly, the structure of the MthK channel in a ligand-free closed conformation, which could facilitate a much better understanding of the ligand-induced conformational change in RCK domains, is yet to be solved. A simple approach to this problem is to study the structure of the RCK domain alone, with or without bound ligand. In this study, we have presented high resolution structures of the MthK RCK domain determined from three different crystals. One of the structures is in a Ca2+-bound state and was refined to 1.7 Å. The high resolution structure provided a much more accurate model, allowing us to visualize critical protein-protein interactions such as van der Waal contacts, salt bridges, and solvent interactions at atomic detail. It also undoubtedly served as a better guide for structure-based mutagenesis studies. Unlike the RCK domains in the MthK structure, which form an octameric gating ring, the isolated RCK domains form dimers through interactions at the flexible interface, whereas the interactions at the fixed interface are absent in all three crystal structures solved. This prevented us from visualizing the gating ring movement upon Ca2+ binding. However, the structural comparisons among all these dimers along with modeling exercises provided informative insight into the conformational change at the flexible interface and raised the possibility that the fixed interface may not remain fixed during channel gating. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that at pHs above neutral (pH 7.5-8.0), the RCK domain by itself can form a stable octameric gating ring in solution. The octamer is disrupted in these crystals by the low pH crystallization conditions, which may cause a histidine residue (His-193), important for protein contacts at the fixed interface, to become protonated, destabilizing the interface. Denaturation studies of RCK octamers in urea showed that the binding of Ca2+ has a strong effect on the stability of the gating ring. Protein Purification and Crystallization—Taking advantage of the fact that the MthK gene expressed in E. coli also produces the soluble RCK domain in excess to the channel, we were able to obtain the purified domain from the soluble fraction of E. coli cell lysates in which the MthK gene was overexpressed. The gene was cloned into a pQE70 vector (Qiagen) with a thrombin cleavage site between the channel and the C-terminal hexahistidine tag. The channel was overexpressed in E. coli SG13009 cultures by induction with 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at A600 ∼0.8, and cells were harvested and lysed in 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl containing leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) to inhibit proteases. The supernatant of the cell lysate containing an excess of the RCK domain was collected after centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 20 min. The RCK domain was purified on a Talon Co2+ affinity column (Clontech) and eluted with 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, and 300 mm imidazole. Protein eluted from the Co2+ column was incubated for 3 h at room temperature (∼21 °C) in the presence of 1.0 unit of thrombin (Roche Applied Science) per 2.0 mg of protein to remove the hexahistidine tag and further purified on a Superdex 200 (10/30) size-exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl. The purified protein was concentrated to about 6 mg/ml using a 10-kDa cutoff Amicon Ultra (Millipore) for crystallization. All crystals were grown by sitting-drop vapor diffusion at 20 °C by mixing equal volumes of protein and reservoir solutions. The crystal of space group R32 was grown over a reservoir solution of 200 mm NH4SO4, 100 mm cacodylate, pH 5.5, and 25-30% polyethylene glycol 400 and has a unit cell of a = b = 164.88 Å, c = 82.852 Å, α = β = 90°, γ = 120° with one subunit per asymmetric unit. The two P21 crystals were both grown over a reservoir solution of 1 m NH4 formate, 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0-4.5, 10% polyethylene glycol 4000. One of the protein solutions used for crystallization contained 20 mm CaCl2. The P21 crystal with Ca2+ has a unit cell of a = 57.979 Å, b = 37.908 Å, c = 96.652 Å, α = γ = 90°, β = 95.486°, and that without Ca2+ has a unit cell of a = 57.900 Å, b = 38.167 Å, c = 96.700 Å, α = γ = 90°, β = 95.946°. Both crystals contain two subunits in an asymmetric unit. Structure Determination—All data were collected at the Argonne National Laboratory Structural Biology Center (19 ID or 19 BM beamlines) at the Advanced Photon Source at -180 °C under a nitrogen stream. The data sets were processed and scaled with HKL2000 (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar), and the structures were determined by molecular replacement methods with CNS (15Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M.

The model for the R32 crystal form was refined to 2.8 Å with an Rwork of 22.4% and Rfree of 26.2% and contains residues 113-336, two extra amino acids from the thrombin cleavage site, and five water molecules. The model for the P21 crystal with Ca2+ was refined to 1.7 Å with an Rwork of 22.8% and Rfree of 26.8%. It contains residues 116-336 plus three extra amino acids from the thrombin cleavage site in one subunit, residues 116-334 in the other subunit, two Ca2+ ions, and 542 water molecules. The model for the P21 crystal without Ca2+ was refined to 2.1 Å with an Rwork of 21.1% and Rfree of 24.5%. It contains residues 116-336 plus three extra amino acids from the thrombin cleavage site in one subunit, residues 116-335 in the other subunit, and 290 water molecules. The numbering in the models is based on the sequence of the MthK channel. Fluorescence and Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—The RCK domain was purified in 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, and 250 mm NaCl as described above. The urea stock solutions at various concentrations were prepared fresh in the same buffer, and their pH was adjusted to 8.0. The RCK samples were mixed with urea stocks at a ratio of 1:3 (v/v) and left at room temperature for half an hour before subjecting them to fluorescence or CD spectroscopy measurements. CaCl2 was added to the protein samples before mixing with urea. Samples were excited at 280 nm, and the fluorescence emission from 300 to 380 nm was scanned using a PTI model A1010 fluorometer (South Brunswick, NJ). The CD spectra in a wavelength range of 260-200 nm was recorded on an AVIV Model 62DS spectropolarimeter (Lakewood, NJ) using a 1-mm path length cuvette. Overall Structure of MthK RCK Domain—All crystals used for the structural analysis were grown in sitting drops by vapor diffusion, and their structures were determined by molecular replacement using the RCK domain from the open MthK channel structure (13Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). The RCK domains crystallized in two distinct crystal forms. One crystal has an R32 space group and contains one subunit per asymmetric unit. The final structure was refined to 2.8 Å with an Rwork and Rfree of 22.4 and 26.2%, respectively. The other two crystals were grown in identical crystallization conditions, except for the presence or absence of 20 mm CaCl2 in the protein solutions, and have a P21 space group with similar unit cell dimensions. The crystal grown in the presence of 20 mm CaCl2 is in the Ca2+-bound state, whereas the crystal grown in the absence of CaCl2 is in the unligated state. Both P21 structures contain two subunits per asymmetric unit. The final structure of the Ca2+-bound form was refined to 1.7 Å with an Rwork and Rfree of 22.8 and 26.8%, respectively. The structure of the ligand-free form was refined to 2.1 Å with an Rwork and Rfree of 21.1% and of 24.5%, respectively.

Open table in a new tab The MthK RCK domain forms a dimer in all three crystal structures and has a bilobed architecture with a deep cleft between the lobes, where two Ca2+ ions can bind (Fig. 1B). Although the R32 crystal contains only one subunit in an asymmetric unit, the molecular dyad of the dimer coincides with one of the crystallographic two-fold axes. Each RCK subunit can be divided into three subdomains (Fig. 1A): the N-terminal subdomain, which forms a Rossmann folded lobe; the intermediate subdomain with a helix-turn-helix (αG-turn-αF) structure that crosses over to the neighboring subunit to form an interlocking dimerization interaction with its counterpart; and the C-terminal subdomain, which forms an extension of the dimer interface and further stabilizes the RCK homodimer. The C-terminal subdomain is less conserved among RCK domains, being absent in some, such as the one from E. coli (5Jiang Y. Pico A. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 2001; 29: 593-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The dimer interface between the RCK domains is extremely extensive and buries about 3200 Å2 of otherwise solvent-accessible area. The interactions within the interface are composed of van der Waals contact between nonpolar surface and hydrogen bonds, involving almost all the residues from the intermediate subdomain and some interfacial residues from the C-terminal subdomain. The extensiveness of this dimer interface and the fact that monomeric RCK is never detected under nondenaturating conditions suggest that the dimerization of RCK domain through this interface is conserved in the assembly of the MthK channel. In addition to the MthK RCK, structures of RCK homologs from other systems are also available. These are the RCK domain from the six-transmembrane E. coli K+ channel (5Jiang Y. Pico A. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 2001; 29: 593-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and the KTN domains of the Ktr K+ import systems from Methanococcus jannaschii and Bacillus subtilis (10Roosild T.P. Miller S. Booth I.R. Choe S. Cell. 2002; 109: 781-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). They all form homodimers with the same bilobed architecture and use the same helix crossover motif to hold the two Rossmann folded lobes together with a deep cleft in between (Fig. 1, B-D). However, the dimerization interface of the MthK RCK domain is distinct from that of the E. coli RCK domain. The E. coli RCK does not have the C-terminal subdomain (Fig. 1C), and its dimer interface has a helixstrand-helix (αF-βG-αG) structure. This helix-strand-helix is equivalent to the helix-turn-helix intermediate domain in the MthK RCK but forms a handshake-like motif for dimerization instead of an interlock. The KTN domain shares high sequence similarity to the MthK RCK despite the fact that the ligand for the KTN domain is NAD/NADH. The KTN structure was solved using a truncated construct in which the C-terminal region right after helix αF was removed (Fig. 1D). Considering the sequence similarity, we expect the full-length KTN domain to have a similar structure and the same dimer interface (a helix interlock with the C-terminal subdomain) as the MthK RCK. Ca2+-binding Site—The high resolution structure from the P21 crystal of the MthK RCK in the presence of Ca2+ allowed us to accurately define the coordination of the Ca2+ ions. The RCK dimer has two Ca2+-binding sites located at the bottom of the cleft between the two Rossmann folded lobes. The two sites are 11 Å apart and are separated by two phenylalanine residues (Phe-232), one from each subunit (Fig. 2A). Ca2+ binding is coordinated by three acidic residues (Asp-184, Glu-210, and Glu-212) and three water molecules. As shown in Fig. 2B, the Ca2+ ion in each RCK subunit is chelated by a total of seven oxygen atoms. Three oxygen atoms from the carboxylates of two acidic residues (two from Asp-184 and one from Glu-212), along with two oxygen atoms from two water molecules, form an almost planar ring around the Ca2+ ion. Another two oxygen atoms, one from Glu-210 carboxylate and one from the third water molecule, align almost perpendicularly above and below the ring. The distances between the Ca2+ ion and the oxygen atoms are within the range of 2.3-2.7 Å. Although the Ca2+-binding motif in MthK RCK domain is not the same as EF-hand (17Lewit-Bentley A. Rety S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), the arrangement of Ca2+ coordination by seven oxygen atoms is similar, and such an arrangement was also observed in other Ca2+-binding proteins such as porcine pancreatic elastase (18Meyer E. Cole G. Radhakrishnan R. Epp O. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Sci. 1988; 44: 26-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 3EST). The RCK Dimer Interface Is Flexible—The dimer interface of the MthK RCK domain was previously suggested to be flexible based on a structural comparison between RCK domains from the MthK channel and the E. coli K+ channel, two different proteins that are closely related but have distinct differences. With an intact flexible interface in all these MthK RCK dimer structures, we are now able to evaluate the intermolecular conformation across the interface in the same protein in different states. As the RCK dimers from both the Ca2+-bound and the unbound P21 crystals have almost identical structures and can be superimposed with minimal differences (Fig. 3A), only the Ca2+-bound structure was used in the comparison with the gating ring-forming RCK dimer from the MthK structure. The individual Rossmann folded lobes superimpose quite well with each other in these RCK structures, but the relative positions of the two lobes across the dimer interface are different. To visualize this difference, we positioned the gating ring-forming RCK dimer about its molecular dyad (Fig. 3, B and C, vertical arrows) and superimposed the other RCK dimer against the lobe on the left. The P21 RCK dimer adopts a more open conformation with the right lobe swinging clockwise (Fig. 3B). To accommodate such a change, the C-terminal subdomains from both subunits swing clockwise accordingly. The movement is as if the molecular dyad rotates clockwise around the flexible hinge point located at the bottom of the cleft while keeping the left lobe stationary. The R32 RCK dimer, on the other hand, adopts a more closed conformation, and the right side lobe and the C-terminal subdomains have a counterclockwise rotation, leading to a narrower and deeper cleft (Fig. 3C). It is likely that the RCK structure from the R32 crystal is more closely related to a closed conformation. The observation that two RCK subunits adopt different relative positions across the flexible interface in different crystals clearly demonstrated that this interface is indeed flexible as previously proposed from the MthK structure. In the context of the gating ring, we expect that each RCK subunit will undergo a similar kind of conformational change at the flexible interface during channel gating as we observed in those dimer structures. A similar interface in the KTN domain was also proposed to be flexible from structural studies (10Roosild T.P. Miller S. Booth I.R. Choe S. Cell. 2002; 109: 781-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the two Ca2+-binding sites, located within the interdomain cleft, are in the vicinity of the flexible hinge point between βF and αF. The two ligand (NAD/NADH)-binding sites in the KTN dimer, although not the same as the Ca2+-binding sites in the MthK RCK, are also within the cleft and close to the hinge point (Fig. 1D). The common positions of the ligand-binding sites in different RCK dimers indicate a similar conformational change across the flexible interface upon ligand binding. It is worth noting that the conformational differences between the flexible interfaces of the isolated RCK dimers and the gating ring-forming RCK dimer are not large enough to account for the previously hypothesized gating ring movement. Furthermore, an attempt to reconstruct these dimers into octamers by applying protein-protein contacts at the fixed interface failed to generate the enclosed, four-fold symmetrical gating ring. This suggested that to form a gating ring, the protein contacts at the fixed interface can no longer stay fixed. These observations pointed toward a high probability that the fixed interface is actually not fixed during channel gating. With the movement of the fixed interface, a larger conformational change at the flexible interface is no longer necessary to achieve a substantial gating ring movement. The RCK Domain Forms a Stable Octameric Gating Ring in Solution— The structure of the MthK channel suggested that a functional MthK channel requires the formation of an octameric gating ring on the intracellular side. However, under the conditions used in this study, the RCK domain forms a dimer. To determine the identity of the stable form of the RCK domain in solution, we used size-exclusion chromatography to estimate its oligomeric state (Fig. 4). At a pH above neutral (i.e. pH 7.5-8.0), with or without Ca2+, the purified RCK domain elutes at a position equivalent to the size of a 200-kDa protein, consistent with the formation of an octameric complex. At lower pH (i.e. pH ∼4.5-5.5), however, the RCK domain elutes as a dimer. This dimer in the low pH solution is likely to be the same as the crystallographic dimers, in which the flexible interface is maintained,"

Upon binding to susceptible cells, αHL assembles via an inactive prepore to form a water-filled homoheptameric transmembrane pore. The N terminus of αHL, which in the crystal structure of the fully assembled pore forms a latch between adjacent subunits, has been thought to play a vital role in the prepore to pore conversion.

We then discovered that the mutation Ser217 → Asn, which was present in our original set of truncations but not in the new ones, promotes complete inactivation upon truncation of the N terminus. Therefore, the N terminus of αHL cannot be critical for the prepore to pore transformation as previously thought.

The transmembrane or stem domain, which is flanked by the triangle region, is defined by a 14-stranded antiparallel β barrel to which each subunit contributes two strands (Figs. 1A and 2A). The crystal structure of αHL pore serves as a prototype for the end point of the assembly process of this class of βPFTs (Fig. 1B).FIGURE 2Structural homology in β barrel pore-forming toxins.

At least six class-F proteins and seven class-S proteins are found in various Staphylococcus strains (2Prevost G. Menestrina G. Colin D.A. Werner S. Bronner S. Serra M.D. Moussa L.B. Coraiola M.

Although the structure of a Luk oligomer has not been solved, the structures of two water-soluble class-F monomers, LukF (hlgB gene product) and LukF-PV, and one class-S monomer, LukS-PV, have been determined (Fig. 2, B and C) (19Guillet V.

Shepard W. Monteil H. Samama J.P. Mourey L. Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The folds of all three monomers resemble that of the αHL protomer in the heptameric pore, with the exception of the amino latch and stem domains (Fig. 2, A-C). The Luk structures serve as prototypes for the starting point in the assembly of this class of βPFTs (Fig. 1B). A mechanistic framework with four distinguishable stages has been proposed for the assembly of αHL and related βPFTs (20Olson R. Nariya H. Yokota K. Kamio Y. Gouaux E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 22Walker B. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21782-21786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the water-soluble monomer (stage 1, Fig. 1B), the N terminus and the prestem are packed against the β sandwich core of the protein (20Olson R. Nariya H. Yokota K. Kamio Y. Gouaux E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). At this stage, both the N terminus and the pre-stem are susceptible to proteolysis (22Walker B. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21782-21786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the monomer binds to membranes (stage 2, Fig. 1B), the pre-stem becomes resistant to proteolysis. However, the N terminus is still protease-sensitive. It is not clear whether any structural changes take place in stage 2, which is the most poorly defined of the four stages; the reduced susceptibility of the pre-stem to proteases could arise from a lack of accessibility to the enzymes at the bilayer surface. Lateral diffusion then gives rise to prepore formation (stage 3, Fig. 1B). The details of the pathway for oligomerization are not well understood (23Nguyen V.T. Kamio Y. Higuchi H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4968-4979Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 24Bayley H. Jayasinghe L. Wallace M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 385-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Monomers could add onto a growing chain of subunits until it reaches the proper length to circularize or assembly could occur through random encounters between intermediates (e.g. dimers, trimers, etc.) (23Nguyen V.T. Kamio Y. Higuchi H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4968-4979Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 24Bayley H. Jayasinghe L. Wallace M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 385-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The protease-resistant pre-stem regions of individual protomers reside inside the prepore (9Fang Y. Cheley S. Bayley H. Yang J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9518-9522Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 22Walker B. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Bayley H. J. Biol.

Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which is by definition not lytic (stage 3, Fig. 1B). The N terminus of the prepore remains protease-sensitive (22Walker B. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21782-21786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Walker B. Braha O. Cheley S. Bayley H. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 99-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In our hands, no intermediates have been observed in the prepore to pore conversion, which may therefore be a cooperative process (stage 4, Fig. 1B) (25Walker B. Braha O. Cheley S. Bayley H. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 99-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In the case of wild-type αHL, formation of the transmembrane β barrel is accompanied by re-organization of the N terminus, which latches onto the neighboring subunit (15Song L. Hobaugh M.R. Shustak C. Cheley S. Bayley H. Gouaux J.E. Science. 1996; 274: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar, 27Valeva A. Pongs J. Bhakdi S. Palmer M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1325: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the fully formed pore, the amino latch is hidden within the cavity of the cap domain and resists proteolysis (Fig. 2A) (22Walker B. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21782-21786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Walker B. Braha O. Cheley S. Bayley H. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 99-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The αHL pore has been extensively engineered for applications in biotechnology (28Bayley H. Jayasinghe L. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2004; 21: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). For example, in stochastic sensing a wide variety of analytes can be detected at the single molecule level through the modulation of the current flowing through a single pore (29Braha O. Walker B. Cheley S. Kasianowicz J.J. Song L. Gouaux J.E. Bayley H. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 497-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 30Gu L.Q. Braha O. Conlan S. Cheley S. Bayley H.

Further, the αHL pore has recently been used as a nanoreactor to examine chemical reactions at the single molecular level (32Shin S.H. Luchian T. Cheley S. Braha O. Bayley H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 41 (3707-3709): 3523Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 33Shin S.H. Bayley H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 10462-10463Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 34Luchian T. Shin S.H.

Engl. 2003; 42: 1926-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the αHL pore is emerging as a useful tool in both basic science and biotechnology (28Bayley H. Jayasinghe L. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2004; 21: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 31Bayley H. Cremer P.S. Nature. 2001; 413: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is especially important to understand the assembly and structure of αHL and related βPFTs in detail. In the present report, we shed additional light on the role of the N terminus in the assembly of αHL. In an early study, the analysis of truncation mutants suggested that the N terminus plays a crucial role in the transformation of the prepore to an active pore (22Walker B. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21782-21786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Truncating the polypeptide by just two residues at the N terminus rendered αHL completely inactive and arrested assembly at the prepore stage (stage 3, Fig. 1B). However, a later study suggested that truncated polypeptides have limited pore-forming activity (36Vandana S. Raje M. Krishnasastry M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24858-24863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the present work, we resolve this issue through an examination of the original truncation mutants and a new series in which up to 22 residues are deleted. We find that: 1) up to 17 residues can be deleted from the N terminus of αHL without complete loss of activity, 2) latch formation is not necessary to form functional pores, 3) residue 217 cooperates with the N terminus during pore formation, and 4) the N terminus prevents the premature oligomerization of monomers in solution. Construction of Mutants—All constructs were assembled in the pT7-SC1 expression vector (17Miles G. Cheley S. Braha O. Bayley H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8514-8522Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 37Cheley S. Malghani M.S. Song L. Hobaugh M. Gouaux J.E. Yang J. Bayley H. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and verified by DNA sequencing of the entire αHL inserts. Genes encoding the truncation mutants were generated by PCR mutagenesis and ligation-free in vivo recombination as described elsewhere (38Jones D.H. Dieffenbach C.W. Dveksler G.S. PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 591-601Google Scholar, 39Howorka S. Bayley H. BioTechniques. 1998; 25 (768, 770 passim): 764-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Except for αHL-NΔ1, each forward mutagenic primer for N-terminal truncation contained an NdeI site at the initiation codon followed by an alanine codon (see Table 1). The WT αHL, αHL-NΔ3, and αHL-NΔ12 genes were then used to generate the point mutants: αHL-S217N, αHL-S217P, (αHL-NΔ3)-S217N, (αHL-NΔ3)-S217P, and (αHL-NΔ12)-S217N.TABLE 1Nomenclature of N terminal truncation mutants of αHL An Ala codon was placed at the first position of each mutant gene in all the mutants except αHL-NΔ1. If the polypeptides were deformylated, the initial Ala would ensure the efficient co-translational removal of the N-terminal methionine (22Walker B. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21782-21786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we do not know whether our IVTT proteins contain fMet or Met at the N terminus. αHL-NΔ3 is the same deletion as αHL(A3-293) (22Walker B. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21782-21786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and αHL-NΔ12 is the same as αHL(A12-293), except that the earlier truncation mutants carried the additional mutation S217N.123456789101112131415161718192021222324WTαHLADSDINIKTGTTDIGSNTTVKTGDαHL-NΔ1DSDINIKTGTTDIGSNTTVKTGDαHL-NΔ2ASDINIKTGTTDIGSNTTVKTGDαHL-NΔ3ADINIKTGTTDIGSNTTVKTGDαHL-NΔ4AINIKTGTTDIGSNTTVKTGDαHL-NΔ5ANIKTGTTDIGSNTTVKTGDαHL-NΔ6AIKTGTTDIGSNTTVKTGDαHL-NΔ7AKTGTTDIGSNTTVKTGDαHL-NΔ8ATGTTDIGSNTTVKTGDαHL-NΔ9AGTTDIGSNTTVKTGDαHL-NΔ10ATTDIGSNTTVKTGDαHL-NΔ11ATDIGSNTTVKTGDαHL-NΔ12ADIGSNTTVKTGDαHL-NΔ13AIGSNTTVKTGDαHL-NΔ14AGSNTTVKTGDαHL-NΔ15ASNTTVKTGDαHL-NΔ16ANTTVKTGDαHL-NΔ17ATTVKTGDαHL-NΔ18ATVKTGDαHL-NΔ19AVKTGDαHL-NΔ20AKTGDαHL-NΔ21ATGDαHL-NΔ22AGD Open table in a new tab Synthetic LukS (hlgC) and LukF (hlgB) genes were used to produce point mutants of the leukocidin proteins: LukF-P215N, LukS-P201N, LukS-P202N, and LukS-P201N/P202N. The codon usage in these constructs differs from the natural genes, but the encoded amino acid sequences are unchanged. 4L. Jayasinghe, G. Miles, and H. Bayley, unpublished work. The PCR mutagenesis/in vivo recombination technique was again used to generate these mutants (38Jones D.H. Dieffenbach C.W. Dveksler G.S. PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 591-601Google Scholar, 39Howorka S. Bayley H. BioTechniques. 1998; 25 (768, 770 passim): 764-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, codons 1-18 of the synthetic LukS gene were connected by PCR mutagenesis/in vivo recombination to the gene segment encoding residues 22-293 of WT αHL to generate the mutant LukS(1-18)HL. Similarly, codons 1-21 of the synthetic LukF gene were connected to codons 22-293 of WT αHL to generate the mutant LukF(1-21)HL. Coupled in Vitro Transcription and Translation—Proteins were generated by coupled in vitro transcription and translation (IVTT) by using an Escherichia coli T7-S30 extract system for circular DNA (Promega, no. L1130). The complete amino acid mixture (1 mm) minus cysteine and the complete amino acid mixture (1 mm) minus methionine, supplied in the kit, were mixed in equal volumes to obtain the working amino acid solution required to generate high concentrations of the proteins. The amino acids (2.5 μl) were mixed with premix solution (10 μl), l-[35S]methionine (1 μl, MP Biomedicals, no. 51001H, 1175 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml), plasmid DNA (4 μl, 400 ng/μl), and T7-S30 extract (7.5 μl) supplemented with rifampicin (20 μg/ml final) (37Cheley S. Malghani M.S. Song L. Hobaugh M. Gouaux J.E. Yang J. Bayley H. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synthesis was carried out for 1 h at 37 °C (for αHL mutants) or 30 °C (for leukocidin mutants) to produce 25 μl of radiolabeled IVTT protein. Membrane Binding and Oligomerization—WT αHL or mutant proteins (IVTT, 1.5 μl) were incubated with washed rRBC membranes (3 μl, 4.2 mg of protein/ml) in MBSA (30 μl, 10 mm MOPS titrated with NaOH, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mg/ml BSA) for 1 h at 37 °C. After centrifugation, the resulting membrane pellets were washed with MBSA and subjected to electrophoresis in 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Figs. 3A and 4A). The gels were fixed for 30 min prior to drying and autoradiography. Radiolabeled markers (14C-methylated proteins) were from Amersham Biosciences (no.

For the hemolytic assay, in the case of αHL, IVTT protein (5 μl) was diluted with MBSA buffer (95 μl) in the first well of each row (Figs. 3B and 5C) or column (Fig. 4B) of a microtiter plate. In the case of the leukocidins, LukS (5 μl) and LukF (5 μl) proteins were diluted in MBSA (90 μl) in the first well of each row (Fig. 3D). The proteins were then subjected to 2-fold serial dilution with the same buffer across each row (Figs. 3B,3D, and 5C) or down each column (Fig. 4B), leaving 50 μl in each well. Hemolysis was initiated by the addition of an equal volume of washed rRBC (1% in MBSA) to each well and monitored by observing the decrease in light scattering at 595 nm with a Bio-Rad microplate reader (Model 3550-UV) (40Cheley S.

Limited Proteolysis Assay—WT αHL and mutant proteins (IVTT, 25 μl) were incubated with rRBC membranes (5 μl, 4.2 mg of protein/ml) and MBSA (30 μl)for 1 h at 37 °C. The washed membrane pellets were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 5% gels. Oligomers were obtained from the gels and concentrated as described elsewhere (30 μl) (18Jayasinghe L.

They were then divided into two portions of 15 μl each. One portion was treated with water (1 μl), and the other portion was treated with proteinase K (1 μl, 0.1 mg/ml final, New England Biolabs, no. P8102S). After incubation for 5 min at room temperature, both samples were treated with phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (in 1 μl of isopropanol, 10 mm final, Sigma, no.

After the addition of 2× sample buffer (17 μl) (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar), the samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and subjected to electrophoresis in a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 3C). The gel was fixed for 30 min prior to drying and autoradiography. In a separate experiment (Fig. 5B), WT αHL, LukS(1-18)HL, and LukF(1-21)HL (IVTT, 5 μl) were oligomerized on washed rRBC membranes (3 μl, 4.2 mg of protein/ml) in 30 μl of MBSA (37 °C, 1 h). After centrifugation, the resulting membrane pellets were washed with MBSA and resuspended in MBSA (40 μl). They were then divided into four tubes (9 μl each). Sample 1 was mixed with water (1 μl). Samples 2-4 were treated with proteinase K solution (1 μl; 0.005, 0.05, and 0.5 mg/ml final, respectively; New England Biolabs, no. P8102S) for 5 min at room temperature. The proteinase K reactions were terminated with phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (in 1 μl of isopropanol, 10 mm final, Sigma, no. P7626) for 5 min at room temperature. Sample buffer (11 μl, 2×) (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar) was added to each tube. The samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and subjected to electrophoresis in a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 5B). The gel was fixed for 30 min prior to drying and autoradiography. Preoligomerization of Truncated Mutants—WT αHL and mutant proteins were expressed by IVTT (12.5 μl). Without the addition of rRBC membranes, the samples were centrifuged (25,000 × g, 10 min), and the supernatants were separated. Supernatant (3 μl) was mixed with MBSA (22 μl) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Sample buffer (25 μl, 2×) (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar) was then added to each tube. The unheated samples were subjected to electrophoresis in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 6A). The gel was fixed for 30 min prior to drying and autoradiography. For limited proteolysis, the IVTT supernatants from WT αHL and the mutants (4 μl) were mixed with MBSA (36 μl) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The samples were then divided into four tubes (9 μl each), treated with proteinase K as described earlier, and subjected to electrophoresis in a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 6B). Construction of αHL Mutants to Analyze the Effect of the Residue at Position 217 on the Conversion of the Prepore to the Active Pore—The role of the N terminus of αHL in pore formation was originally investigated before the availability of structural data. In the first study, Walker and coworkers in our laboratory generated four truncation mutants of αHL by deleting 2, 11, 22, and 38 residues from the N terminus (22Walker B. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21782-21786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All formed SDS-stable oligomeric complexes on rRBC but were incapable of lysis. Therefore, these mutants were proposed to be arrested at a “prepore” stage, and it was inferred that the N terminus of αHL plays a crucial role in the c"

Six members of this family have been identified in mammals (GPC1-GPC6). Glypicans act as regulators of the activity of various cytokines, including Wnts, Hedgehogs, and bone morphogenetic proteins. It has been reported that processing by a convertase is required for GPC3 activity during convergent extension in zebrafish embryos, for GPC3-induced regulation of Wnt signaling, and for the binding of GPC3 to Wnt5a. In our laboratory, we have recently demonstrated that GPC3 promotes the growth of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) by stimulating canonical Wnt signaling. Because there is increasing evidence indicating that the structural requirements for GPC3 activity are cell type specific, we decided to investigate whether GPC3 needs to be processed by convertases to stimulate cell proliferation and Wnt signaling in HCC cells. We report here that a mutant GPC3 that cannot be processed by convertases is still able to play its stimulatory role in Wnt activity and HCC growth.

Because there is increasing evidence indicating that the structural requirements for GPC3 activity are cell type specific, we decided to investigate whether GPC3 needs to be processed by convertases to stimulate cell proliferation and Wnt signaling in HCC cells. We report here that a mutant GPC3 that cannot be processed by convertases is still able to play its stimulatory role in Wnt activity and HCC growth. Glypicans are a family of heparan sulfate proteoglycans that are linked to the exocytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor (1Lander A.D. Stipp C.S.

In general, glypicans are expressed predominantly during development. Their expression levels change in a stage- and tissue-specific manner, suggesting that they are involved in morphogenesis (4Filmus J. Song H.H.

Genetic and functional studies performed in Drosophila, Xenopus, zebrafish, and mammals have demonstrated that glypicans can stimulate the signaling activity of Wnts, Hedgehogs, and bone morphogenetic proteins (7Jackson S.M.

In the specific case of Wnts, glypicans have been reported to stimulate both the canonical and non-canonical pathways (8Baeg G.H. Perrimon N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 13Topczewsky J. Sepich D.S. Myers D.C. Walker C. Amores A. Lele Z. Hammerschmidt M. Postlethwait J. Solnica-Krezel L. Dev.

Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 421-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), it was originally proposed that the stimulatory activity of glypicans is based on their ability to act as facilitators of the interaction between Wnts and their receptors (8Baeg G.H. Perrimon N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This hypothesis has been supported by the finding that several Wnts can co-immunoprecipitate with glypicans (14Ohkarawa B. Yamamoto T.S. Tada M. Ueno N.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6245-6254Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), although it is now known that at least in certain cell systems the heparan sulfate chains are not required for the glypican-Wnt interaction (18Song H.H. Shi W. Xiang Y. Filmus J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2116-2125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 21Capurro M. Xiang Y.Y. Lobe C. Filmus J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6245-6254Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). This lack of requirement of the heparan sulfate chains for the interaction with a growth factor has also been reported for perlecan, another heparan sulfate proteoglycan that can regulate cell proliferation (22Gonzalez E.M. Mongiat M. Slater S.J. Baffa R. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38113-38116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition to acting as facilitators of ligand-receptor interactions, glypicans have been shown to play a role during development in the transport of Wnts, Hedgehogs, and bone morphogenetic proteins for the purpose of morphogen gradient formation (23Fujise M.

Cell. 2004; 7: 513-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). One of the highly conserved structural features of the glypicans is the location of the insertion sites for the heparan sulfate chains, which seem to be restricted to the last 55 amino acids, placing such chains in proximity to the cell surface (6Song H.H. Filmus J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Another conserved feature of this protein family is the location of 14 cysteine residues, suggesting that glypicans share a highly similar three-dimensional structure (6Song H.H. Filmus J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of glypicans has unveiled the existence of an internal cleavage site in at least three family members (GPC1, GPC3, and GPC4) (29David G. Lories V. Decock B. Marynen P. Cassiman J. Van Den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3165-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 30Filmus J. Shi W. Wong Z.M. Wong M.J. Biochem.

Cleavage at this site generates an ∼40-kDa N-terminal subunit and an ∼30-kDa C-terminal subunit containing the heparan sulfate chains (Fig. 1A). After cleavage both subunits remain linked to each other by one or more disulfide bonds and the N-terminal subunit is not released into the conditioned medium, but the subunits can be separated in reducing conditions (31Watanabe K. Yamada H. Yamaguchi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1207-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A recent study by De Cat et al. (15De Cat B. Muyldermans S.Y. Coomans C. Degeest G. Vanderschueren B. Creemers J. Biemar F. Peers B. David G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) on GPC3 shows that this endoproteolytic site can be cleaved by members of the convertase protein family. Moreover, this study shows that cleavage by a convertase is required for GPC3 activity during convergent extension in zebrafish embryos, for the binding of GPC3 to Wnt5a, and for GPC3-induced regulation of Wnt signaling (15De Cat B. Muyldermans S.Y. Coomans C. Degeest G. Vanderschueren B. Creemers J. Biemar F. Peers B. David G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Convertases are ubiquitously expressed subtilisin-like serine endoproteases that activate proproteins by cleavage at specific recognition sites (32Taylor N.A. Van de Ven W.J.M. Creemers J.W.M. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1215-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The first mammalian convertase that was characterized was furin, but at least six other members of this family have been identified after furin. Many classes of proteins have been shown to be processed by convertases, including neuropeptides, hormones, growth factors, metalloproteases, and adhesion molecules (32Taylor N.A. Van de Ven W.J.M. Creemers J.W.M. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1215-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). These proteins are usually synthesized as inactive precursors, and their processing by convertases is required for activation. It is now well established that convertases play a critical role in many physiological processes and that they are involved in numerous pathologies, including cancer (32Taylor N.A. Van de Ven W.J.M. Creemers J.W.M. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1215-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 33Khatib A.M. Siegfried G. Chretien M. Metrakos P. Seidah N.G. Am. J.

Our laboratory has recently reported that GPC3 is up-regulated in most human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) 2The abbreviations used are: HCChepatocellular carcinomaGPC3glypican-3HAhemagglutinin AGPIglycosil-phosphatidylinositolEFelongation factorFACSfluorescence-activated cell sortingwtwild-type.2The abbreviations used are: HCChepatocellular carcinomaGPC3glypican-3HAhemagglutinin AGPIglycosil-phosphatidylinositolEFelongation factorFACSfluorescence-activated cell sortingwtwild-type.

In addition, we showed that GPC3 promotes the growth of HCC by stimulating canonical Wnt signaling (21Capurro M. Xiang Y.Y. Lobe C. Filmus J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6245-6254Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The growth-stimulating activity of GPC3 in HCC cells has also been reported by another laboratory (35Huang J.S. Chao C.C. Su T.L. Yeh S.H. Chen D.S. Chen C.T. Chen P.J. Jou Y.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). One interesting finding of our study was that the heparan sulfate chains were not essential for the GPC3-induced activation of Wnt signaling and for the GPC3-induced stimulation of HCC growth in vivo. Similarly, the heparan sulfate chains were shown to be dispensable for the regulatory activity of GPC4 in convergent extension during Xenopus gastrulation, a process that is also known to be driven by Wnt signaling (14Ohkarawa B. Yamamoto T.S. Tada M. Ueno N. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 2129-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Contrarily, in the study by De Cat et al. (15De Cat B. Muyldermans S.Y. Coomans C. Degeest G. Vanderschueren B. Creemers J. Biemar F. Peers B. David G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) it was shown the heparan sulfate chains are essential for the regulatory activity of GPC3 on Wnt signaling in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Collectively, these results suggest that the structural requirements for GPC3-induced regulation on Wnt signaling are cell context specific. We decided therefore to investigate whether the processing of GPC3 by convertases is necessary for its regulatory activity of Wnt signaling in the context of HCC cells. We report here that a mutant GPC3 that cannot be cleaved by convertases is still able to stimulate the growth of HCC cells. Moreover, we also show that cleavage by convertases is not required for the interaction of GPC3 with Wnt7b and Wnt3a and for the potentiation of canonical Wnt signaling. hepatocellular carcinoma glypican-3 hemagglutinin A glycosil-phosphatidylinositol elongation factor fluorescence-activated cell sorting wild-type. hepatocellular carcinoma glypican-3 hemagglutinin A glycosil-phosphatidylinositol elongation factor fluorescence-activated cell sorting wild-type. Cell Lines and Plasmids—PLC-PRF-5 and HLF cell lines were cultured in minimal essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) supplemented with minimal essential medium non-essential amino acids solution (Invitrogen), and sodium pyruvate (1 mm). The 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal bovine serum. The PLC-PRF-5 and 293T cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), and the HLF cell line was donated by Dr. Eiji Miyoshi (University of Osaka). L cells permanently transfected with Wnt3A-pLNCx or empty vector (pLNCx) as control were obtained from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. To collect conditioned medium, the cells were grown at high density for 4 days. Rat1 cells permanently transfected with Wnt1-pLNCx or empty vector (pLNCx) were obtained from Dr. J. Kitajewsky (Columbia University). Expression vectors containing N-terminal hemagglutinin A (HA)-tagged GPC3, the mutant GPC3 that cannot be glycanated (GPC3ΔGAG), and the mutant GPC3 lacking the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchoring domain (GPC3ΔGPI) were previously described (36Duenas Gonzales A.

Generation of the Convertase-resistant GPC3 Mutant—To eliminate the endoproteolytic cleavage site in the N-terminal HA-tagged GPC3 cDNA, arginine residues 355 and 358 were mutated to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis (GPC3 RR → AA), and mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. To verify that this mutant is convertase resistant, 293T cells were transiently transfected with the full-length wild-type GPC3 cDNA (GPC3 wt), the GPC3 RR → AA cDNA, or with vector alone (EF) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and the lysates analyzed by Western blot using anti-GPC3 (1G12) or anti-HA (12CA5; Roche Applied Science) monoclonal antibodies as previously described (34Capurro M. Wanless I.R. Sherman M. Deboer G. Shi W. Miyoshi E. Filmus J. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 81-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Generation of Stable GPC3-expressing HCC Cell Lines—PLC-PRF-5 and HLF cells were transfected with selectable expression vectors containing the full-length wild-type GPC3 cDNA (GPC3 wt), the GPC3 RR → AA cDNA, the GPC3ΔGAG cDNA, or with vector alone (EF) as a negative control using Lipofectin (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were selected and FACS-sorted as previously described (21Capurro M. Xiang Y.Y. Lobe C. Filmus J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6245-6254Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The expression levels of GPC3 in the different stably transfected cell populations was also analyzed by FACS as previously described (21Capurro M. Xiang Y.Y. Lobe C. Filmus J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6245-6254Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Cell Proliferation Assay—Cells were plated into 24-well dishes (20,000 cells/well) in medium without antibiotics. At the indicated time points, cells were trypsinized and counted with a hemocytometer. Each experiment was done at least three times by quadruplicates. Tumorigenicity Assay—5 × 106 cells were injected subcutaneously into the left flank of 7-week-old CB-17 SCID mice (Charles River Canada) using a 26-gauge needle. At the indicated time points, the volumes of the tumors were determined by measuring the largest (a) and smallest (b) axis using a caliper. Volume was calculated according to the formula V = 0.5 ab2. Significance of differences between the groups of mice was determined by the Mann-Whitney test, and the level of significance was set as p <0.05. Mice handling and experimental procedures were performed in accordance with institutional guidelines. Cytoplasmic β-Catenin Assessment—Cells were grown in the absence of serum for 48 h, washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline, and harvested with a cell scrapper. Cytoplasmic fractions were prepared as previously described (21Capurro M. Xiang Y.Y. Lobe C. Filmus J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6245-6254Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), and the level of cytoplasmic β-catenin was assessed by Western blot with the antibody clone 14 (BD Transduction Laboratories). Actin (AC-40 Ab; Sigma) was used as loading control. Luciferase Assay for TOPFLASH Reporter Activity—293T cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 200,000 cells/well and co-transfected with a luciferase reporter vector driven by the TOPFLASH promoter (37Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2896) Google Scholar), a β-galactosidase expression vector, and GPC3 wt, GPC3 RR → AA, or vector alone (EF) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). One day after transfection the cells were incubated for 6 h with conditioned media from Wnt3A-transfected L cells or L cells transfected with empty vector as control. Cells were then lysed, and luciferase activity (Luciferase Assay System; Promega) and β-galactosidase activity were determined. Each luciferase value was normalized for transfection efficiency using β-galactosidase activity. Each experiment was performed three times by triplicates. To perform the luciferase assay with PLC-PRF-5 cells we followed a procedure similar to that for the 293T cells, except that we used Lipofectin (Invitrogen) for transfection, and for stimulating Wnt signaling the cells were co-cultured with 300,000 Wnt1-expressing Rat1 cells or Rat1 cells transfected with empty vector as control for 16 h. Wnt-GPC3 Co-immunoprecipitation—293T cells were transfected with GPC3 wt or GPC3 RR → AA mutant and HA-tagged Wnt3A or Wnt7B expression vectors using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Two days after transfection, cell lysates were prepared in 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate in phosphate-buffered saline. Lysates containing 400 μg of protein were precleared with protein G-Sepharose (fast flow; Sigma) during 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, GPC3 was immunoprecipitated from the precleared lysates adding anti-GPC3 1G12 monoclonal antibody (2.5 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the beads were collected and the presence of Wnt in the immunoprecipitated material analyzed by Western blot using an anti-HA antibody (3F10; Roche Applied Science). To control for efficiency of transfection, GPC3 and Wnt levels were assessed by Western blot analysis of total lysates. Generation of the Convertase-resistant GPC3 Mutant—A mutant GPC3 (GPC3 RR → AA) that cannot be processed by convertases was generated by replacing Arg355 and Arg358 in the intraproteolytic processing site RQYR with alanine residues. The resistance of this mutant GPC3 to convertase-mediated processing was verified by Western blot analysis of transiently transfected 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, when the anti-GPC3 antibody 1G12 (which detects an epitope located in the C terminus) is used for Western blot analysis in reducing conditions, wild-type GPC3 generates a smear that extends from 30 to ∼200 kDa, which corresponds mostly to the products of the glycanation of the C terminus 30-kDA fragment (Fig. 1A). It should also be noted that a portion of the smear corresponds to the glycanation products of the full-length GPC3, because analysis with the anti-HA antibody shows that not all the GPC3 that is on the cell surface is processed by convertases in transiently transfected 293T cells. In addition, the Western blot analysis revealed the presence of a ∼70-kDa band. This band most likely represents the GPC3 core protein that has not been glycanated yet. As expected, Western blot analysis of the GPC3 RR → AA mutant with the 1G12 antibody shows the disappearance of the portion of the smear with a range of molecular masses that is lower than the full-length GPC3 core protein, confirming that GPC3 cleavage and the generation of the 30-kDa C terminus and of its glycanated products does not occur when the site recognized by the convertases is mutated. When the cell lysate containing wild-type GPC3 was analyzed with an anti-HA antibody (12CA5) that recognizes the HA tag located at the N terminus, the intensity of the smear is dramatically reduced. This is expected because the anti-HA antibody cannot recognize the 30-kDa subunit and its glycanated products. On the other hand the anti-HA antibody recognizes a 40-kDa fragment that corresponds to the N terminus generated as a result of convertase-driven cleavage of GPC3. In addition, a limited amount of smear corresponding to non-cleaved glycanated GPC3 is observed. Analysis of the GPC3 RR → AA mutant with the anti-HA antibody therefore confirms that this mutant cannot be cleaved by convertases. GPC3 Cleavage by Convertases Is Not Required for the Stimulation of HCC Cell Proliferation—We have previously shown that ectopic GPC3 stimulates the in vitro and in vivo growth of PLC-PRF-5 and HLF, two HCC cell lines that express very little and no endogenous GPC3, respectively (21Capurro M. Xiang Y.Y. Lobe C. Filmus J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6245-6254Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Both cells lines are able to process GPC3, as indicated by the fact that ectopic wild-type GPC3 generates in these cells smears with a smaller molecular mass range (Fig. 2). In addition, the ability of the HCC cells to cleave GPC3 can be recognized by the presence of a 40-kDa band in Western blots probed with the anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2). To provide a better estimation of the proportion of GPC3 that is cleaved by convertases, we transfected the two HCC cell lines with a mutant GPC3 that cannot be glycanated (22Gonzalez E.M. Mongiat M. Slater S.J. Baffa R. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38113-38116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Based on the intensity of the ∼30-kDa band that corresponds to the non-glycanated C terminus, we estimate that ∼50% of the GPC3 expressed by the PLC-PRF-5 and HLF cell lines is cleaved by convertases (Fig. 2F). To determine whether the processing of GPC3 by convertases is necessary for its growth-stimulatory activity, we also transfected PLC-PRF-5 and HLF cells with the GPC3 RR → AA mutant. Populations of transfected cells expressing high levels of mutant GPC3 were then isolated by FACS, and the expression of similar GPC3 levels in the various cell populations was confirmed by Western blot and FACS analysis (Fig. 2, C-E). It should be noted that the HLF cells seem to be able to synthesize much longer heparan sulfate chains, because the range of molecular masses of the smear detected in these cells is significantly larger than that observed for PLC-PRF-5 cells. Next, the effect of ectopic GPC3 on the proliferation rate of the transfected HCC cells was investigated. As shown in Fig. 2, we found that both the wild-type GPC3 and the RR → AA mutant GPC3 were able to stimulate the proliferation rate of the two HCC cell lines to the same extent. Moreover, wild-type or RR → AA mutant GPC3 similarly stimulated the tumorigenicity of PLC-PRF-5 cells in mice (Fig. 3). We conclude, therefore, that the processing of GPC3 by convertases is not necessary for its in vitro and in vivo growth-stimulatory activity in HCC cells. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the structural requirements for glypican activity are cell context specific. In principle, it could be argued that processing of GPC3 in the transfected HCC cells is not required because the ectopic levels of GPC3 are very high. It should be noted, however, that we have already shown that the levels of GPC3 expressed by transfected PLC-PRF-5 and HLF cells are within the physiological range, because they are lower that those found in HepG2, a GPC3-positive HCC cell line (21Capurro M.

The GPC3-induced Stimulation of Canonical Wnt Signaling in HCC Cells Is Independent of Cleavage by Convertases—We recently reported that GPC3 promotes HCC growth by stimulating the canonical Wnt pathway (21Capurro M. Xiang Y.Y. Lobe C. Filmus J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6245-6254Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Because De Cat et al. (15De Cat B. Muyldermans S.Y. Coomans C. Degeest G. Vanderschueren B. Creemers J. Biemar F. Peers B. David G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) showed that convertase activity is required for GPC3-induced regulation of canonical Wnt activity and it is well established that glypicans can also potentiate the activity of other heparin binding growth factors, we decided to investigate whether non-cleaved GPC3 also stimulates HCC cell proliferation by activating Wnt activity. To this end we studied the effect of wild-type or RR → AA mutant GPC3 on the levels of cytoplasmic β-catenin in the PLC-PRF-5 and HLF cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, the mutant GPC3 is able to induce the accumulation of levels of cytoplasmic β-catenin similar to wild-type GPC3. We conclude, therefore, that the processing of GPC3 by convertases is not required for the stimulation of canonical Wnt signaling in HCC cells. De Cat el al. (15De Cat B. Muyldermans S.Y. Coomans C. Degeest G. Vanderschueren B. Creemers J. Biemar F. Peers B. David G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) showed that processing by convertases is required for the GPC3-induced regulation of canonical Wnt1 in Chinese hamster ovary and MCF-7 cells. Because PLC-PRF-5 and HLF cells do not express Wnt1 (21Capurro M. Xiang Y.Y. Lobe C. Filmus J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6245-6254Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), it could be proposed that the lack of requirement of convertase processing for GPC3-induced activation of autocrine Wnt signaling in HCC cells that we observed is due to the fact that this requirement is restricted for the regulation of Wnt1 activity. To test this possibility we compared the effect of GPC3 and the RR → AA mutant in the response of PLC-PRF-5 cells to exogenous Wnt1. Because soluble Wnt1 is mostly inactive, we decided to co-culture the GPC3-transfected PLC-PRF-5 cells with Rat1 cells permanently transfected with a Wnt1 expression vector. To measure the response of the PLC-PRF-5 cells to Wnt1 we transiently transfected these cells with the canonical Wnt-responsive TOPFLASH luciferase reporter plasmid. We found that the RR → AA mutant GPC3 was as effective as the wild-type GPC3 in stimulating Wnt1 activity (Fig. 4B). GPC3 Processing by Convertases Is Not Necessary to Stimulate Canonical Wnt Signaling in 293T Cells—To determine whether the lack of requirement of convertase processing for GPC3-induced stimulation of Wnt activity is a phenomenon restricted to HCC cells, we decided to study the effect of the RR → AA mutant GPC3 on the response to exogenous canonical Wnt in 293T cell lines. To this end, we measured Wnt-induced transcriptional activity in 293T cells transiently transfected with the TOPFLASH-luciferase reporter plasmid and various GPC3 expression vectors. Conditioned medium from Wnt3A-transfected L cells was used as the source of exogenous Wnt. Fig. 5, upper panel, shows that wild-type GPC3 significantly increases the response of 293T cells to Wnt3A and that the RR → AA mutant GPC3 induces a similar increase. As a negative control we also tested the effect of a mutant GPC3 lacking the GPI-anchoring domain (GPC3ΔGPI). This mutant cannot be attached to the cell membrane and did not stimulate Wnt signaling in HCC cells (21Capurro M. Xiang Y.Y. Lobe C. Filmus J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6245-6254Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). As expected, GPC3ΔGPI was unable to stimulate luciferase activity in 293T cells (Fig. 5). Western blot analysis of GPC3 in the transiently transfected 293T cells showed that the wild-type GPC3 and the RR → AA mutant constructs generated similar expression levels (Fig. 5, lower panel). Convertase Processing Is Not Required for the Co-immunoprecipitation of GPC3 and Wnts—It has been proposed that glypicans stimulate Wnt signaling by facilitating the interaction of Wnts and their signaling receptors (8Baeg G.H. Perrimon N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we have demonstrated that in 293T cells GPC3 co-immunoprecipitates with Wnt3a and Wnt7b (21Capurro M. Xiang Y.Y. Lobe C. Filmus J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6245-6254Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Interestingly, De Cat et al. (15De Cat B. Muyldermans S.Y. Coomans C. Degeest G. Vanderschueren B. Creemers J. Biemar F. Peers B. David G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) have shown that in MCF-7 breast cancer cells the non-cleavable GPC3 does not co-immunoprecipitate with Wnt5a. We decided to investigate, therefore, whether the RR → AA mutant GPC3 co-immunoprecipitates with Wnt7b and Wnt3a in 293T cells. To this end we transiently transfected wild-type or RR → AA mutant GPC3 and HA-tagged Wnt3a and Wnt7b into 293T cells. GPC3 was then immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates using the anti-GPC3 1G12 antibody, and the presence of Wnt in the precipitated material was analyzed by Western blot with an anti-HA antibody. Fig. 6 shows that both Wnt3A and Wnt7B co-immunoprecipitated indistinctly with wild-type or mutant GPC3. We have shown here that in the context of HCC cells, GPC3 does not need to be processed by convertases to be able to potentiate canonical Wnt signaling and to exert its in vitro and in vivo growth-stimulatory activity. Moreover, we have shown that unprocessed GPC3 can co-immunoprecipitate with Wnts and stimulate their signaling activity in 293T cells, indicating that the convertase-independent activity of GPC3 is not specific for HCC cells. Currently we do not know why convertase processing is required for GPC3 activity in some contexts but not in others. The interaction of Wnts with their signaling receptors is highly complex. Co-receptors and other extracellular proteins that regulate Wnt-Frizzled interactions have been identified (38Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 781-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (4138) Google Scholar). We speculate that the requirement of convertase processing for GPC3 activity may be determined by the particular composition of the ligand-receptor complex in a given cell context and/or by the expression levels of the components of such complex."
https://openalex.org/W2163972733,"We report a regime of ion beam sputtering that occurs for sufficiently steep slopes. High slopes propagate over large distances without dissipating the steepest features. Both the propagation velocity and the dynamically selected slope are universal, independent of the details of the initial shape of the surface. The resulting behavior can be understood as the propagation of a shock front that self-selects a stable slope, as has been previously observed in thin-film fluid flows. Experiments confirm predictions of the theory. An important implication of the propagative behavior at high surface slopes is that a pattern can be fabricated at a large length scale and, through uniform ion irradiation, reduced to a smaller length scale while preserving, or even sharpening, the sharpest features."
https://openalex.org/W1996792476,"The proto-oncoprotein SYT is involved in the unique translocation t(X;18) found in synovial sarcoma SYT-SSX fusions. SYT has a conserved N-terminal domain (SNH domain) that interacts with the human paralog of Drosophila Brahma (hBRM) and Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1) chromatin remodeling proteins and a C-terminal transactivating sequence rich in glutamine, proline, glycine, and tyrosine (QPGY domain). Here we reported the isolation of the ribonucleoprotein SYT-interacting protein/co-activator activator (SIP/CoAA), which specifically binds the QPGY domain of SYT and also the SYT-SSX2 translocation fusion. SIP/CoAA is a general nuclear co-activator and an RNA splicing modulator that contains two RNA recognition motifs and multiple hexapeptide repeats. We showed that the region consisting of the hexapeptide motif (YQ domain) is similar to the hexapeptide repeat domain found in EWS and in TLS/FUS family proteins. The YQ domain also resembles the QPGY region of SYT itself and like all these other domains acts as a transcriptional activator in reporter assays. Most interestingly, the last 84 amino acids adjacent to YQ down-modulate by 25-fold the YQ transactivation of the reporter gene, and both domains are important for SIP/CoAA binding to SYT. In addition, SYT acts together with SIP/CoAA in stimulating estrogen and glucocorticoid receptor-dependent transcriptional activation. Activation is hormone-dependent and requires functional hBRM and/or BRG1. The stimulation is strongly reduced if the N-terminal region of hBRM/BRG1 (amino acids 1–211) is deleted.

Chromosomal translocations that result in oncogenic transformation frequently involve the fusion of two genes that express novel chimeric proteins (1Aman P. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1999; 9: 303-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 2Helman L.J. Meltzer P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In many cases these proteins are aberrant transcription factors. In synovial sarcoma, the unique chromosomal translocation t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2) results in the fusion of the proto-oncogene SYT on chromosome 18 to either of three closely related genes SSX1, SSX2, and SSX4 on chromosome X. This chromosomal translocation is found in more than 90% of synovial sarcomas cases (3Kawai A. Woodruff J. Healey J.H. Brennan M.F. Antonescu C.R. Ladanyi M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). The resulting chimeric genes express SYT-SSX1, SYT-SSX2, or SYT-SSX4 fusion proteins in which the 8 C-terminal amino acids of SYT, at the main translocation point, are replaced by the last 78 amino acids of the C-terminal end of the SSX proteins (4Clark J.

Although the protein is localized in the cell nucleus, it has no recognizable nucleic acid-binding motifs, and its biological function is still unclear. SYT has two recognized functional domains as follows: (i) a conserved N-terminal SNH 5The abbreviations used are: SNHSYT N-terminal homology domainhBRMhuman paralog of Drosophila BrahmaBRG1Brahma-related gene 1EREestrogen response elementERestrogen receptorE217β-estradiolGREglucocorticoid-response elementGRglucocorticoid receptorSIP/CoAASYT-interacting protein/co-activator activatorBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolTRBPthyroid hormone receptor-binding proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salineBDbinding domainRRMsRNA recognition motifsGSTglutathione S-transferaseRGGarginine-glycine-glycineCBPcAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein.5The abbreviations used are: SNHSYT N-terminal homology domainhBRMhuman paralog of Drosophila BrahmaBRG1Brahma-related gene 1EREestrogen response elementERestrogen receptorE217β-estradiolGREglucocorticoid-response elementGRglucocorticoid receptorSIP/CoAASYT-interacting protein/co-activator activatorBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolTRBPthyroid hormone receptor-binding proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salineBDbinding domainRRMsRNA recognition motifsGSTglutathione S-transferaseRGGarginine-glycine-glycineCBPcAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein. domain (amino acids 15–73), and (ii) a region rich in glutamine (Q), proline (P), glycine (G), and tyrosine (Y), called the QPGY domain, which encompasses the C-terminal half of the protein (amino acids 187–387) (9Thaete C.

The SNH domain binds a conserved region known as the SNF11 binding domain (SNF11 BD) situated at the N terminus of the two highly homologous human proteins hBRM and BRG1 (amino acids 158–214 for hBRM; amino acids 156–211 for BRG1) (10Perani M. Ingram C.J. Cooper C.S. Garrett M.D. Goodwin G.H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8156-8167Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the yeast homolog Snf2, this domain binds the SNF11 protein (11Treich I. Cairns B.R. de los Santos T. Brewster E. Carlson M. Mol. Cell.

In human cells, there are two major SWI/SNF complexes named BAF (or SWI/SNF-A) and PBAF (or SWI/SNF-B) that possess similar functions but differ in some protein subunit composition (16Kwon H. Imbalzano A.N. Khavari P.A. Kingston R.E. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 370: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 17Wang W. Cote J. Xue Y. Zhou S. Khavari P.A. Biggar S.R. Muchardt C.

Biol. 2000; 20: 8879-8888Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). BAF contains either one of the two ATPases hBRM or BRG1 whereas PBAF contains only BRG1. Another signature that confirms distinctness is the fact that the BAF250 protein (also called p270/p250) is present in the BAF complex and not in PBAF, and polybromo (or BAF180) is only found in the PBAF complex. There is also good evidence that endogenous SYT is associated with native human SWI/SNF complexes. On the other hand, the C-terminal region of the fusion, encoding the SSX1 C terminus (amino acids 310–387), binds to core histones and oligonucleosomes (20Kato H. Tjernberg A. Zhang W. Krutchinsky A.N. An W. Takeuchi T. Ohtsuki Y. Sugano S. de Bruijn D.R. Chait B.T. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5498-5505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The AF10 protein, which is a putative transcription factor deregulated in t(10;11)-positive acute leukemias, was also found to interact with the SNH domain of SYT (21de Bruijn D.R. dos Santos N.R. Thijssen J. Balemans M. Debernardi S. Linder B. Young B.D. Geurts van Kessel A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3281-3289Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Finally, a role independent from transcriptional activation has also been reported for SYT. The SYT protein can interact with the p300 histone acetyltransferase, but not CBP, for the regulation of cell adhesion possibly by activating the β1 integrin/fibronection receptor. When cells undergo G1 arrest because of contact inhibition, p300 binds to the N-terminal region of SYT in the cell nucleus. The interaction is lost if the first 43 amino acids of SYT (which contains part of the SNH domain) are deleted (22Eid J.E. Kung A.L. Scully R. Livingston D.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 839-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The QPGY domain of SYT resembles the N-terminal activation region of the EWS and FUS/TLS family of proteins (9Thaete C. Brett D. Monaghan P. Whitehouse S. Rennie G. Rayner E. Cooper C.S. Goodwin G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and is even more closely related to the N-terminal region of BAF250 (20Kato H. Tjernberg A. Zhang W. Krutchinsky A.N. An W. Takeuchi T. Ohtsuki Y. Sugano S. de Bruijn D.R. Chait B.T. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5498-5505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which (as described above) is part of the BAF complex and confers specificity to this complex (19Nie Z. Xue Y. Yang D. Zhou S. Deroo B.J. Archer T.K. Wang W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8879-8888Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The SYT QPGY domain appears to be composed of degenerate repeats based on the amino acids glutamine, proline, glycine, and tyrosine, but it is not possible to discern a consensus repeat sequence (9Thaete C. Brett D. Monaghan P. Whitehouse S. Rennie G. Rayner E. Cooper C.S. Goodwin G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) as recognized in EWS protein (23Delattre O. Zucman J. Plougastel B. Desmaze C. Melot T. Peter M. Kovar H. Joubert I. de Jong P. Rouleau G. Aurias A. Gilles Thomas G. Nature. 1992; 359: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, the transactivating QPGY region can also interact with itself, but there are no other proteins that are known to bind to this domain (10Perani M. Ingram C.J. Cooper C.S. Garrett M.D. Goodwin G.H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8156-8167Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this work we have focused our attention on the QPGY domain of SYT. Transfection experiments that we have carried out previously, with SYT fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4, demonstrate that the QPGY repeat region stimulates the expression of reporter constructs (9Thaete C. Brett D. Monaghan P. Whitehouse S. Rennie G. Rayner E. Cooper C.S. Goodwin G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 10Perani M. Ingram C.J. Cooper C.S.

Genet. 1997; 6: 1559-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus, although it has no obvious DNA binding domain, SYT may be a transcriptional co-activator that binds to unknown sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify new proteins that directly interact with the QPGY domain. Here we describe a novel interaction between the QPGY domain of SYT and the general co-activator ribonucleoprotein SYT-interacting protein/co-activator activator (SIP/CoAA) (25Iwasaki T. Chin W.W.

SIP/CoAA also binds to SYT-SSX fusion proteins and may be important in the formation of synovial sarcoma. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening and Cloning of Full-length cDNA of SIP/CoAA—The yeast two-hybrid system was used to clone the SIP/CoAA cDNA from a library made from the synovial sarcoma cell line SS255. A DNA fragment corresponding to amino acids 159–314 was subcloned into the plasmid pYTH9 and stably integrated into the yeast cell line Y190. Expression of the bait was detected by Western blot analysis using a hemagglutinin antibody (Insite Biotech). 250,000 colony-forming units were screened using the lithium acetate transfection method. The transfected yeast was then plated onto trp–-leu–-his– selection agar containing 25 mm 3-aminotriazole. Positive clones were assayed for β-galactosidase activity in a filter assay as described in the Clontech protocol. The insert of one of the positive clones (clone 60) was cloned into pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene) and sequenced using fluorescent dye terminator Taq-FS ready reaction kit (Applied Biosystems). The sequence of the 5′-end of SIP/CoAA was obtained using genomic DNA. cDNA was radioactively labeled and used to probe the PAC library RPCI5 (28Ioannou P.A. Amemiya C.T. Garnes J. Kroisel P.M. Shizuya H. Chen C. Batzer M.A. de Jong P.J. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). 40 positive PACs were obtained and fluorescently fingerprinted (29Gregory S.G. Howell G.R. Bentley D.R. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 1162-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Tiling sets were obtained using FPC software (30Soderlund C. Longden I. Mott R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1997; 13: 523-535PubMed Google Scholar), and central PAC 845F19 was identified as containing the full-length SIP/CoAA and localized to chromosome 11q13.3. The PAC 845F19 clone was used as template in a PCR with a 5′-primer (TTCGGACGTTTTGCCTGTCG) derived from an EST sequence (accession number 610833) together with the reverse primer CTGCTTCCTTCTCCATGTGA. The PCR product was subsequently combined with the C-terminal half of SIP/CoAA into pBIND vector (Promega) to obtain a full-length cDNA clone of SIP/CoAA in a mammalian expression vector (GenBank™ accession number AF080561). Sequence alignment was carried out using Clustal analysis (www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/). Motif characterization was done using Fuzzpro (www.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk/Software/EMBOSS/Apps/fuzzpro.html), Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation (MEME), and Motif Alignment and Search Tool (MAST) (meme.sdsc.edu/meme/website/intro.html). Plasmid Description and Construction—Mammalian two-hybrid vectors pBIND (GAL4) and pACT (VP16) were used in the CheckMate mammalian two-hybrid assays (Promega). Full-length VP16-SYT and VP16-SYT-SSX2 were described previously (10Perani M. Ingram C.J. Cooper C.S. Garrett M.D. Goodwin G.H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8156-8167Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and GAL4-SIP/CoAA was obtained as described above. Each deletion clone was generated by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). The vector pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) was used to clone GST-SIP/CoAA fusion for in vitro interactions assays. Clones expressing FLAG-tagged SIP/CoAA, SYT, SYT-SSX2, hBRM, and BRG1 were prepared using the pCMV-Tag2 vector (Stratagene). Constructs pcDNA5/FRT/TO-BRG1 FL and pcDNA5/FRT/TO-BRG1ΔSNF11 expressing full-length BRG1 and BRG1Δ1–211 were prepared using the pcDNA5/FRT/TO expression vector (Invitrogen). These clones were derived, by restriction enzymes, from the full-length GAL4-SIP/CoAA, VP16-SYT, VP16-SYT-SSX2, pcDNA4/HisMax-hBRM, and pcDNA4/HisMax-BRG1 vectors. pcDNA4/HisMax-hBRM and pcDNA4/HisMax-BRG1 vectors were provided kindly by Dr. S.

Antibodies and Immunoprecipitations—Polyclonal anti-SYT 903 rabbit antibody was described previously (10Perani M. Ingram C.J. Cooper C.S. Garrett M.D. Goodwin G.H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8156-8167Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-SIP/CoAA 907 rabbit antibody was raised and affinity-purified as described for anti-SYT 903 (10Perani M. Ingram C.J. Cooper C.S. Garrett M.D. Goodwin G.H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8156-8167Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) by using the synthetic peptide C+RSPTKSSLDYRRLPD from the C-terminal region of SIP/CoAA (Eurogentec). Anti-SYT 903 antibody was cross-linked using Seize X Protein A immunoprecipitation kit (Perbio) as indicated in the text. Commercially available anti-VP16 activation domain 2GV-4 mouse monoclonal (Euromedex) and anti-FLAG M2-agarose-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibodies (Sigma) were used for immunoprecipitations. Protein G beads (Sigma) were used to immunoprecipitate mouse monoclonal antibodies. Untransfected nuclear and cytoplasmic cell lysates of HeLa cells (350 mm NaCl and 100 mm NaCl, respectively) were prepared as described previously (33Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). Briefly, 8 × 105 cells were scraped off by using cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pelleted, and resuspended in 400 μl of cold 100 mm NaCl buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)). The cells were allowed to swell on ice for 10 min and then vortexed gently for 10 s. Samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant obtained (cytoplasmic fraction) was used immediately for co-immunoprecipitation or Western blot analysis. The pellet was then resuspended in 100 μl of cold 350 mm NaCl buffer (350 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)) and incubated on ice for 20 min for high salt extraction. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and the extraction process was repeated a second time. The two 350 mm supernatants (nuclear fractions) were combined and diluted 1:2 with 100 mm NaCl buffer to 400 μl and used immediately for co-immunoprecipitation or Western blot analysis. Whole cell lysates of transfected COS7 cells were obtained using M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent (Perbio) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the immunoprecipitations, cell lysates were prepared in the presence of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mm glycerol phosphate) and incubated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody for 4 h at 4°C or with anti-VP16 activation domain 2GV-4 mouse monoclonal antibody for 1 h at 4 °C and for a further 3 h after 50 μl of 50% (v/v) protein G-Sepharose (Sigma; preequilibrated in PBS buffer) was added. Protein G beads were collected by centrifugation, and the pellets were washed five times in cold PBS buffer. Beads were eluted using ImmunoPure IgG elution buffer, pH 2.8 (Perbio), incubated at room temperature for 5 min or 2× LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The eluted proteins were passed through a Spin-X centrifuge tube filter containing a cellulose acetate membrane of 0.22-μm pore diameter (Perbio) to avoid any contamination with residual antibody conjugate beads. Samples were analyzed by protein electrophoresis. GST Pull-down Assay—35S-Labeled proteins were generated using the TnT T7 quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Pull downs with in vitro 35S-radiolabeled luciferase and SYT full-length were performed as described previously (10Perani M. Ingram C.J. Cooper C.S. Garrett M.D. Goodwin G.H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8156-8167Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Immunopurification and in Vitro Interaction of FLAG-SIP/CoAA with VP16-SYT and VP16-SYT-SSX2 from Transfected Cell Lysates—Immunopurification and in vitro interaction of FLAG-SIP/CoAA with VP16-SYT and VP16-SYT-SSX2 was performed as described previously (10Perani M. Ingram C.J. Cooper C.S. Garrett M.D. Goodwin G.H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8156-8167Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, FLAG-SIP/CoAA, VP16-SYT, and VP16-SYT-SSX2 were immunopurified from cell lysates from separately transfected COS7 cells using anti-VP16 activation domain clone 2GV-4 mouse monoclonal antibody (Euromedex) with protein G-Sepharose (Sigma), and anti-FLAG M2-agarose-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma). FLAG-SIP/CoAA was then eluted and added to the purified VP16-SYT or VP16-SYT-SSX2 proteins bound to the beads via anti-VP16 mouse monoclonal antibody. Beads were collected by centrifugation after 4 h of incubation and washed in cold PBS buffer. Bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by Western blot. Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins from whole cell lysates and immunoprecipitations were analyzed by NuPAGE 4–12% BisTris SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) and transferred onto an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Blots were incubated with the indicated primary antibody and then with the species-specific horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad), and bands were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL detection reagents, Amersham Biosciences). Transient Transfections and Two-hybrid Assays—The CheckMate mammalian two-hybrid dual reporter firefly/Renilla luciferase assay (Promega) was used to detect protein-protein interactions. For each transfection different combinations of plasmid DNA of the mammalian vectors pBIND and pACT (Promega) expressing full-length or deletion constructs of SYT and SIP/CoAA were transfected together with the luciferase reporter vector pG5-luc according to the protocol as described previously (10Perani M. Ingram C.J. Cooper C.S. Garrett M.D. Goodwin G.H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8156-8167Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Duplicate transfections were carried out in COS7 cells (monkey kidney fibroblast) using 6-well plates and Superfect reagent (Qiagen). The experiments were repeated at least three times independently and the results presented as the average ± S.D. GAL4 and VP16 parental vectors (provided by Promega) were used for negative controls. Firefly luciferase values were obtained using a microtiter plate luminometer (Dynex). Results were normalized for transfection efficiency by the use of co-expressed Renilla luciferase gene located on the pBIND vector, and for levels of protein expression by Western blot analysis to control for variations in protein expression level of transfected constructs. The SW13 cell line was normally cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Glutamax I (Invitrogen), supplemented with fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and streptomycin sulfate (0.1 g/liter)/benzylpenicillin sodium (0.06 g/liter). 24 h before transfection SW13 cells were plated in 6-well plates and grown in phenol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum (GlobePharm), streptomycin sulfate (0.1 g/liter)/benzylpenicillin sodium (0.06 g/liter), and Glutamax I (1×) (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected with pERE-luc (150 ng) and pERα (150 ng) or pGRE-luc (150 ng) and pGR (150 ng) together with 400 ng of the indicated combinations of the following constructs: FLAG-hBRM FL, FLAG-SIP/CoAA FL, and FLAG-SYT FL or pcDNA5/FRT/TO-BRG1 FL and pcDNA5/FRT/TO-BRG1ΔSNF11 expressing full-length BRG1 and BRG1Δ1–211. FLAG-tagged or pcDNA5/FRT/TO empty vectors were added so that the same amount of DNA was used in each transfection. Transfections were carried out using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after transfection, the medium was aspirated and replaced with phenol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum, streptomycin sulfate (0.1 g/liter)/benzylpenicillin sodium (0.06 g/liter), and Glutamax I supplemented either with 10 nm E2 (Sigma) or 100 nm dexamethasone (Sigma), and 0.1% ethanol was used as a vehicle control. 24 h post-hormone treatment, cells were washed in cold PBS and lysed in 500 μl/well of Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Luciferase values were obtained by testing 20 μl of the cell lysates using a microtiter plate luminometer (Dynex). Results were normalized for transfection efficiency by the use of co-expressed pRL-SV40-luc vector (150 ng) that constitutively expresses the Renilla luciferase. Levels of protein expression were also determined by Western blot analysis to control for variations in the protein expression level of transfected constructs. The experiments were repeated at least three times independently and each time in duplicate. The results shown represent the average ± S.D. SIP/CoAA, a Novel SYT-binding Protein—In an attempt to isolate new proteins that interact with the transactivating QPGY domain of SYT, we screened a cDNA library made from the synovial sarcoma cell line SS255 using the yeast two-hybrid technique. The bait consisted of the C-terminal QPGY activation domain (amino acids 160–387) fused to a GAL4 DNA binding domain. A screen of 2.5 × 105 transformants yielded three clones that grew on trp–-leu–-his– selection medium and that were positive in the β-galactosidase assay. Sequence determination of these clones revealed that the inserts were identical, with the coding sequence of the inserts in-frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain. Specificity of interaction was shown when the DNA from these clones was isolated and retransformed into yeast expressing C-terminal SSX2 and C-terminal PRCC (34Skalsky Y.M. Ajuh P.M. Parker C.

They have identical modular architectures and cleave the same substrates, C2 and C4, but show markedly different efficiencies toward C4. Multisite-directed mutagenesis was used to engineer hybrid C1s/MASP-2 molecules where either the complement control protein (CCP) modules or the serine protease (SP) domain of C1s were swapped for their MASP-2 counterparts. The resulting chimeras (C1s(MASP-2 CCP1/2) and C1s(MASP-2 SP), respectively) were expressed and characterized chemically and functionally. Whereas C1s(MASP-2 SP) was recovered as an active enzyme, C1s(MASP-2 CCP1/2) was produced in a proenzyme form and was susceptible to activation by C1r, indicating that the activation properties of the chimeras were dictated by the nature of their SP domain. Similarly, each activated chimera had an esterolytic activity characteristic of its own SP domain and cleaved C2 with an efficiency comparable with that of their parent C1s and MASP-2 proteases. Both chimeras cleaved C4, but whereas C1s(MASP-2 SP) and C1s had Km values in the micromolar range, C1s(MASP-2 CCP1/2) and MASP-2 had Km values in the nanomolar range, resulting in 21–27-fold higher kcat/Km ratios. Thus, the higher C4 cleavage efficiency of MASP-2 arises from a higher substrate recognition efficacy of its CCP modules. Remarkably, C1s(MASP-2 CCP1/2) retained C1s ability to associate with C1r and C1q to form a pseudo-C1 complex and to undergo activation within this complex, indicating that the C1s-CCP modules have no direct implication in either function.

The classical and lectin pathways of complement activation, two major components of innate immunity against pathogenic microorganisms in vertebrates, elicit the same defense reactions in response to infection, and involve similar recognition and triggering mechanisms. C1, the complex that triggers the classical pathway, comprises a flower-like hexameric recognition subunit C1q and two copies of homologous, yet distinct modular serine proteases, C1r and C1s, which together form a Ca2+-dependent tetramer C1s-C1r-C1r-C1s. C1r is responsible for internal C1 activation, a two-step process first involving autolytic C1r activation and then cleavage of proenzyme C1s. Activated C1s is a highly specific trypsin-like protease that mediates limited proteolysis of C4 and C2, the natural protein substrates of C1, thereby triggering activation of the pathway (1Cooper N.R.

Expression of recombinant modular segments from the C-terminal catalytic region of both proteases has revealed that, whereas C2 cleavage is mediated by their SP domain alone, C4 cleavage requires additional sites located in the CCP modules, likely involved in substrate recognition (14Rossi V.

The present study was undertaken to assess the relative contribution of the SP domain and the CCP modules of C1s and MASP-2 to their C4 cleaving activity and investigate what determines the higher efficiency of MASP-2 toward this substrate. For this purpose, we took advantage of the fact that C1s and MASP-2 share homologous modular structures to engineer chimeric C1s molecules comprising either the CCP modules or the SP domain of MASP-2. This domain swapping strategy allows us to demonstrate that the higher C4-cleavage efficiency of MASP-2 arises from the higher C4 recognition efficacy of its CCP modules and reveals that the SP domain of each protease is able to cooperate with the CCP modules of the other.

The plasmids encoding the chimeric proteins were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the parental plasmids using the QuikChange™ multi site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Three single restriction sites, ClaI, AgeI, and NheI, were introduced into pFastBac C1s and pFastBac MASP-2 at the boundaries between modules CUB2 and CCP1, between CCP2 and the SP domain, and after the stop codon, respectively (Fig. 1). The resulting mutated plasmids named pFastBac C1s* and pFastBac MASP-2* were subsequently used for domain swapping. The chimeric plasmid pFastBac C1s(MASP-2 CCP1/2) was obtained by inserting the ClaI (4969)/AgeI (5364) segment of pFastBac MASP-2* within the ClaI (4907)/AgeI (5293) sites of pFastBac C1s*. The chimeric plasmid pFastBac C1s(MASP-2 SP) was obtained in a similar way by insertion of the AgeI (5364)/NheI (6148) segment of pFastBac MASP-2* within the AgeI (5293)/NheI (6117) sites of pFastBac C1s*. All DNA constructs used in this study were checked by double-stranded DNA sequencing (Genome Express, Grenoble, France). Cells and Viruses—The insect cells Spodoptera frugiperda (Ready-Plaque Sf9 cells from Novagen) and Trichoplusia ni (High Five™) were routinely grown and maintained as described previously (27Thielens N.M. Cseh S. Thiel S. Vorup-Jensen T. Rossi V. Jensenius J.C. Arlaud G.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5068-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Recombinant baculoviruses were generated using the Bac-to-Bac™ system (Invitrogen). The bacmid DNA was purified using the Qiagen midiprep purification system (Qiagen S. A., Courtaboeuf, France) and used to transfect Sf9 insect cells utilizing cellfectin in Sf900 II SFM medium (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Recombinant virus particles were collected 4 days later and amplified as described by King and Possee (28King L.A. Possee R.D. The Baculovirus Expression System: A Laboratory Guide. Chapman and Hall, Ltd., London1992: 111-114Google Scholar). Protein Production and Purification—All chimeric proteins were produced and purified using the same procedure, except that diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate was omitted at all steps in the case of C1s(MASP-2 SP). Briefly, High Five cells (1.75 × 10 7 cells/175-cm2 tissue culture flask) were infected with the recombinant viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 2–3 in Sf900 II SFM medium at 28 °C for 72 h. Culture supernatants were collected by centrifugation, dialyzed against 50 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride, 145 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and loaded onto the C1s-Sepharose column (3 × 5 cm) after the addition of 2 mm CaCl2 and 2 mm diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate. Elution of the bound material was carried out with the same buffer containing 5 mm EDTA instead of CaCl2. The eluate was concentrated to 0.3–0.5 mg/ml by centrifugation on a PM-30 membrane (Amicon, Millipore), dialyzed against 50 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride, 145 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and stored at –20 °C until use. Activation of Wild-type C1s, C1s*, and C1s(MASP-2 CCP1/2)—Wild-type C1s and its C1s* and C1s(MASP-2 CCP1/2) variants (3.6 μm each) were activated by incubation with a 2.2% molar ratio of the activated C1r CCP2-SP fragment for 100 min at 37 °C in 50 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride, 145 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Activation was monitored by SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing conditions and subsequent quantification by gel scanning of the A and B chains characteristic of activated C1s. Esterolytic Assays—The esterolytic activity of wild-type C1s, C1s*, the CCP1/2-SP fragment of MASP-2, and both C1s/MASP-2 chimeras was measured on the synthetic ester Ac-Gly-Lys-OMe using an assay described previously (29Arlaud G.J. Thielens N.M. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 223: 61-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Initial cleavage rates were determined at 30 °C at a substrate concentration of 1 mm and at protease concentrations ranging from 1 to 3 nm. The esterolytic activity of each variant (measured as mol of substrate cleaved/s/mol of enzyme) was expressed relative to that of wild-type C1s. Proteolytic Assays—The kinetic parameters of C4 and C2 cleavage were determined using the SDS-PAGE analysis-based method described previously (12Rossi V. Cseh S. Bally I. Thielens N.M. Jensenius J.C.

For C4 cleavage by the CCP1/2-SP fragment of MASP-2 and the C1s(MASP-2 CCP1/2) chimera, the enzyme concentration was 0.5 nm, and substrate concentrations ranged from 50 to 500 nm. C4 cleavage by wild-type C1s, C1s*, and the C1s(MASP-2 SP) hybrid was performed at a 1 nm enzyme concentration, with substrate concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 4 μm. C2 cleavage was carried out under the same conditions in all instances, i.e. a 2 nm enzyme concentration and with C2 concentrations ranging from 1 to 4 μm. The kinetics constants were determined from initial rates analyses by the Lineweaver-Burk method using linear regression analysis and are based on four to five experiments at six different substrate concentrations. Titration with C1 Inhibitor—Titration of the enzymatic activity of C1s and the C1s(MASP-2 CCP1/2) and C1s(MASP-2 SP) chimeras was performed essentially as described previously (12Rossi V. Cseh S. Bally I. Thielens N.M. Jensenius J.C. Arlaud G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40880-40887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) by preincubating the proteases (0.25 μm each) with increasing concentrations of C1 inhibitor (50–500 nm) for 15 min at 37°C in 145 mm NaCl, 50 mm triethanolamine-HCl, 1 mg/ml ovalbumin, pH 7.4. Residual C2 cleaving activity was then measured by incubating the enzymes (3.75 nm for C1s(MASP-2 SP) and 7.5 nm for C1s and C1s(MASP-2 CCP1/2)) with 2.25 μm C2 for 10 min at 37 °C followed by SDS-PAGE analysis of the cleavage as described above. Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy—Analyses were performed using a BIAcore 3000 instrument (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). C1q was immobilized on the surface of a CM5 sensor chip (BIAcore AB) using the amine-coupling chemistry as described previously (30Zundel S. Cseh S. Lacroix M. Dahl M.R. Matsushita M. Andrieu J.P. Schwaeble W.J. Jensenius J.C. Fujita T. Arlaud G.J. Thielens N.M. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 4342-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The C1s-C1r-C1r-C1s tetramer (10 nm) was reconstituted from proenzyme C1r and each C1s variant in 145 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 50 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.4, containing 0.005% surfactant P20 (BIAcore AB). Binding to immobilized C1q (10,000 resonance units) was measured at a flow rate of 20 μl/min in the buffer used for tetramer reconstitution. Equivalent volumes of each tetramer were injected on a surface with immobilized bovine serum albumin to serve as blank sensorgrams. Regeneration of the surface was realized with injection of the same buffer containing 5 mm EDTA instead of 2 mm CaCl2. Data were analyzed by global fitting to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model of the association and dissociation phases for several concentrations simultaneously using the BIAevaluation 3.1 software (BIAcore AB). The apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) were calculated from the ratio of the dissociation koff and association kon rate constants, and maximal binding capacities (Rmax) were determined using the same model. Activation of C1s(MASP-2 CCP1/2) within the C1 Complex—C1 (0.25 μm) was reconstituted from equimolar amounts of C1q and the tetramer containing proenzyme C1r and either wild-type C1s, C1s*, or C1s(MASP-2 CCP1/2) and incubated in 145 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 50 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.4, for various periods at 37 °C to allow spontaneous activation (31Tacnet-Delorme P. Chevallier S. Arlaud G.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6374-6381Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures were submitted to SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing conditions, and activation was measured by Western blot using a polyclonal anti-C1s antibody as described previously (14Rossi V. Bally I. Thielens N.M. Esser A.F. Arlaud G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1232-1239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Other Methods—SDS-PAGE analysis was performed as described previously (23Thielens N.M. Aude C.A. Lacroix M.B. Gagnon J. Arlaud G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14469-14475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of the recombinant proteins was performed according to published procedures (14Rossi V. Bally I. Thielens N.M. Esser A.F. Arlaud G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1232-1239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) using anti-C1s and anti-MASP-2 antibodies (12Rossi V.

N-terminal sequence analysis was performed as described previously (32Rossi V. Gaboriaud C. Lacroix M. Ulrich J. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Gagnon J. Arlaud G.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7311-7321Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The objective of this study was to evaluate the respective contribution of the SP domain and CCP modules of C1s and MASP-2 to their catalytic activity, notably with respect to their differential efficiency toward C4. For this purpose, two chimeric C1s molecules containing either the SP domain of MASP-2 (C1s(MASP-2 SP)) or its CCP1 and CCP2 modules (C1s(MASP-2 CCP1/2)) were engineered using multisite-directed mutagenesis. As detailed under “Experimental Procedures,” the domain swapping procedure used required introduction of new restriction sites at module boundaries in the C1s cDNA, resulting in slight amino acid changes (Fig. 2). Thus, at the CUB2-CCP1 junction, the Asp275-Pro276 segment of wild-type C1s was replaced by Ser-Met in C1s(MASP-2 CCP1/2) and by Ser-Ile in C1s(MASP-2 SP) and the intermediate species C1s* containing only the restriction sites (Fig. 2B). At the CCP2-SP boundary, Lys405 of wild-type C1s was replaced by Val in C1s* and C1s(MASP-2 SP). As detailed later, the intermediate C1s* species was used as a control to evaluate the possible effects of these amino acid changes. Chemical Characterization of the C1s/MASP-2 Chimeras—Wild-type C1s, C1s*, C1s(MASP-2 CCP1/2), and C1s(MASP-2 SP) were expressed in a baculovirus/insect cell system and secreted in the culture supernatant at concentrations of about 10, 6, 2, and 0.15 mg/liter, respectively. All C1s variants could be purified by affinity chromatography on a C1s-Sepharose column in the presence of Ca2+ ions, indicating that the interaction properties characteristic of their N-terminal CUB1-epidermal growth factor moiety (33Gregory L.A.

As assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis, C1s, C1s*, and C1s(MASP-2 CCP1/2) were essentially pure and exhibited a single-chain structure under reducing conditions, indicating that they were in the proenzyme state (Fig. 3A). Whereas C1s* and wild-type C1s had similar apparent molecular masses (83 kDa), that of C1s(MASP-2 CCP1/2) was significantly lower (78 kDa), consistent with the fact that the MASP-2 CCP2 module lacks N-linked glycosylation, contrary to its counterpart in C1s (Fig. 2A). As expected, C1s(MASP-2 CCP1/2) was reactive to both anti-C1s and anti-MASP-2 antibodies (data not shown). SDS-PAGE analysis of the C1s(MASP-2 SP) chimera under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 3B) revealed two bands generally present in equivalent amounts, (i) a 79-kDa species corresponding to the full-length protease, yielding two sequences, Glu-Pro-Thr-Met-Tyr-Gly-Glu-Ile-Leu-Ser and Ile-Tyr-Gly-Gly-Gln-Lys-Ala-Lys-Pro-Gly, corresponding to the N-terminal ends of C1s and of the MASP-2 SP serine protease domain, respectively and (ii) a 50-kDa species yielding only the first sequence above and reacting only with anti-C1s antibodies, corresponding to a truncated fragment derived from the N-terminal end of the chimeric protein. Analysis under reducing conditions indicated that full-length C1s(MASP-2 SP) was totally activated, as it yielded two bands at 29 and 60 kDa corresponding to the serine protease domain and the N-terminal chain expected to be released upon activation (see Fig. 2). The former chain reacted only with anti-MASP-2 antibodies (data not shown), whereas the latter co-migrated with the truncated fragment mentioned above. Functional Characterization of the C1s/MASP-2 Chimeras—Activation of C1s* and the C1s(MASP-2 CCP1/2) chimera was readily achieved by incubation with the CCP2-SP fragment of C1r, as assessed by the release of two chains upon SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing conditions (data not shown). As expected, the light chains, corresponding to the SP domains (30 kDa), co-migrated with that of wild-type C1s. In contrast, the N-terminal heavy chain of C1s(MASP-2 CCP1/2) had an apparent mass of 58 kDa, significantly lower than those of C1s and C1s* (61 kDa). Compared with wild-type C1s, no significant difference was observed in the activation kinetics of C1s* and C1s(MASP-2 CCP1/2), and >95% activation was achieved in all cases upon incubation with C1r CCP2-SP under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” The esterolytic activity of the various activated C1s variants was next measured using Ac-Gly-Lys-OMe as a substrate and compared with those of wild-type C1s and of the CCP1/2-SP fragment of MASP-2, which retains the esterolytic and proteolytic activities of full-length MASP-2 (12Rossi V.

As illustrated in Fig. 4, C1s* and C1s(MASP-2 CCP1/2) cleaved this substrate with an efficiency very similar to that of wild-type C1s. In contrast, C1s(MASP-2 SP) had a significantly lower activity comparable with that of the CCP1/2-SP fragment of MASP-2. This clearly indicated that each activated variant was catalytically active and had an esterolytic activity characteristic of its own SP domain (12Rossi V. Cseh S. Bally I. Thielens N.M.

Both activated C1s/MASP-2 chimeras specifically cleaved C2, as assessed by their ability to split this protein into its characteristic C2a and C2b fragments (data not shown). In both cases, C2 cleavage was essentially complete after incubation for 20 min at 37 °C at an enzyme: substrate molar ratio of 1:1000. The kinetic parameters of C2 cleavage were determined for both chimeras and compared with those obtained with wild-type C1s, C1s*, and the CCP1/2 fragment of MASP-2. As listed in TABLE ONE, all enzymes showed comparable kcat values. Although slight differences were observed in the Km values, the C2 cleavage efficiency of each chimera, as measured by the kcat/Km ratio, was not significantly differen"
https://openalex.org/W1977764104,"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channels are gated by binding and hydrolysis of ATP at the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). We used covalent modification of CFTR channels bearing a cysteine engineered at position 334 to investigate changes in pore conformation that might accompany channel gating. In single R334C-CFTR channels studied in excised patches, modification by [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate (MTSET+), which increases conductance, occurred only during channel closed states. This suggests that the rate of reaction of the cysteine was greater in closed channels than in open channels. R334C-CFTR channels in outside-out macropatches activated by ATP alone were modified with first order kinetics upon rapid exposure to MTSET+. Modification was much slower when channels were locked open by the addition of nonhydrolyzable nucleotide or when the R334C mutation was coupled to a second mutation, K1250A, which greatly decreases channel closing rate. In contrast, modification was faster in R334C/K464A-CFTR channels, which exhibit prolonged interburst closed states. These data indicate that the reactivity of the engineered cysteine in R334C-CFTR is state-dependent, providing evidence of changes in pore conformation coupled to ATP binding and hydrolysis at the NBDs. The data also show that maneuvers that lock open R334C-CFTR do so by locking channels into the prominent s2 subconductance state, suggesting that the most stable conducting state of the pore reflects the fully occupied, prehydrolytic state of the NBDs.

CFTR channel gating is controlled by binding and hydrolysis of ATP plus PKA-dependent phosphorylation at the regulatory domain; binding of ATP leads to dimerization of the two NBDs, which is linked to channel opening, whereas hydrolysis of ATP causes disassociation of the dimers and subsequent channel closure (2Vergani P. Lockless S.W. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C. Nature. 2005; 433: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Hence, these events in the NBDs induce conformational changes in the pore domain, which leads to opening and closing of the channel pore by an unknown mechanism. cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein kinase A [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate 2-sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonate N-tris(hydroxymethyl)-methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid N-methyl-d-glucamine 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate nucleotide-binding domain wild type CFTR. cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein kinase A [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate 2-sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonate N-tris(hydroxymethyl)-methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid N-methyl-d-glucamine 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate nucleotide-binding domain wild type CFTR. Several lines of evidence suggest that the CFTR pore experiences more than two conformations (i.e. the closed and open states), including evidence that changes in anion selectivity and susceptibility to blockade are associated with the ATP-dependent gating cycle (3Yue H.

Landes Biosciences, Georgetown, TX2003: 1-34Google Scholar). We recently showed that single wild type CFTR (WT-CFTR) channels exhibit two subconductance states as well as the full-conductance state (17Zhang Z.-R. Cui G. Liu X. Song B. Dawson D.C. McCarty N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 458-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar); the stability and frequency of these substates are enhanced in some channels bearing mutations in the putative pore-lining regions. Using covalent labeling of channels bearing an engineered cysteine, we demonstrated that the subconductance and full conductance states represent different conducting states of a single chloride permeation pathway, which may reflect different conformations of the pore-lining helices (17Zhang Z.-R. Cui G. Liu X. Song B. Dawson D.C. McCarty N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 458-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In that study, real time modification of single R334C-CFTR channels was observed during patch clamp experiments by the sulfhydryl-modifying agent, MTSET+, diffusing to the tip of the electrode; the resulting deposition of positive charge increased the open channel conductance. Strikingly, we never observed MTSET+-induced modification during an open burst. Therefore, we hypothesized that the accessibility or reactivity of the engineered cysteine in R334C-CFTR for modification by MTSET+ may be favored by the closed state. To test this hypothesis, we performed a series of experiments to measure the rate coefficients for modification by MTSET+ and MTSES– under a variety of conditions that alter the channel open probability (Po) of R334C-CFTR. Here we report for the first time in the CFTR pore that the rate coefficient for modification of an engineered cysteine by thiol-modifying reagents is significantly lower when channels are open compared with when channels are allowed to close. The results provide direct evidence that conformational changes in the outer vestibule of CFTR are linked to the ATP-dependent gating cycle. Preparation of Oocytes and cRNA—For mutant R334C, site-directed mutagenesis used a nested PCR strategy in which the mutation was designed into antiparallel oligomers (18Smith S.S. Liu X. Zhang Z.-R. Sun F. Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 407-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The rest of the mutants used in this study were prepared with the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene; La Jolla, CA) using oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis. All mutant constructs were verified by sequencing across the entire open reading frame before use. For macropatch recordings, cRNAs were prepared from a high expression construct, which was kindly provided by Dr. D. Gadsby (Rockefeller University). Oocytes were injected in a range of 5–100 ng of CFTR cRNAs. Oocytes were incubated at 18 °C in modified Liebovitz's L-15 medium with the addition of HEPES (pH 7.5), gentamicin, and penicillin/streptomycin. Recordings were made 24–72 h after the injection of cRNAs. Electrophysiology—The electrophysiological recording methods used were similar to those described previously (17Zhang Z.-R. Cui G. Liu X.

For single channel recording, CFTR channels were studied in excised, inside-out patches at room temperature (22–23 °C). All single channel recordings for R334C- and R34C/K1250A-CFTR used asymmetrical [Cl–] in order to increase the single channel amplitude at VM = –100 mV, where the pipettes were filled with a low [Cl–]-containing solution (see below). Oocytes were prepared for study by shrinking in hypertonic solution (200 mm monopotassium aspartate, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2) followed by manual removal of the vitelline membrane. Pipettes were pulled in four stages from borosilicate glass (Sutter Instrument Co.; Novato, CA) and had resistances averaging ∼10 megaohms when filled with low [Cl–] pipette solution containing 30 mm NMDG-Cl, 270 mm NMDG-aspartate, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm TES (pH 7.4). The sulfhydryl-modifying reagents MTSET+ or MTSES– (200 μm) were backfilled into the pipettes before seal formation and allowed to diffuse to the tip during and after seal formation; solution lacking MTS reagent was used to fill the very tip of the pipette. Typical seal resistances were 200 gigaohms or greater. R334C-, R334C/K464A-, and R334C/K1250A-CFTR channels were activated by excision into intracellular solution containing 300 mm NMDG-Cl, 1.1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm Tris-EGTA, 1 mm MgATP, 10 mm TES (pH 7.4), 50 units/ml PKA. In experiments designed to increase Po of R334C-CFTR channels, 2.75 mm AMP-PNP was added to intracellular solution containing 1 mm MgATP and 100 units/ml PKA. CFTR currents were measured with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments; Union City, CA) and were recorded at 10 kHz to DAT tape. For subsequent analysis, records were filtered at a corner frequency of 100 Hz and acquired using a Digidata 1322A interface (Axon) and computer at 2.5 ms/point with pClamp 8.0. For outside-out macropatch recordings, electrode tips were filled with a modified intracellular solution (150 mm NMDG-Cl, 1.1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm Tris-EGTA, 10 mm TES, pH 7.4) and then backfilled with the same solution containing either 1 mm MgATP plus 100 units/ml PKA or 1 mm MgATP, 100 units/ml PKA, and 2.75 mm AMP-PNP. Through time, nucleotides and PKA diffused to the intracellular face of the outside-out patch; CFTR channels were fully activated in ∼50–75 min. The normal extracellular solution (150 mm NMDG-Cl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm TES, pH 7.4) served as bath solution, to which we added MTSET+ or MTSES– to reach final concentrations of 10–100 μm, respectively. The pipette potential was held at 0 mV and then stepped to either +80 or –80 mV during exposure to MTSET+. In the case of modification by MTSES–, the pipette potential was held at 0 mV and then stepped to +80 mV during perfusion of MTSES–. A fast perfusion system (model SF-77B; Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) controlled by pClamp software was employed for all outside-out macropatch experiments; the time constant for solution exchange using this system is <25 ms as judged by activation of endogenous calcium-activated chloride channels (17Zhang Z.-R.

Outside-out macropatch recordings were performed with an Axopatch 200B amplifier operated by pClamp 8.0 software, filtered at 200 Hz, and analyzed using Clampfit 9.0. Analysis of Single Channel and Macropatch Experiments—For single channel recordings, transition analysis used a 50% cut-off between the open and closed current levels. Burst duration analysis was completed on records from patches containing 1–4 active CFTR channels; we used a minimum interburst duration cut-off of 100 ms to discriminate between interburst gating and fast intraburst closings (19Zhang Z.-R. Zeltwanger S. McCarty N.A. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 175: 35-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The mean open burst duration was estimated as previously described (19Zhang Z.-R. Zeltwanger S.

Physiol. 1998; 111: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The dwell time histograms of mean burst duration were constructed with Igor software (Wavemetrics; Lake Oswego, OR) and then fit to an exponential function. The bin widths for R334C-CFTR recordings in the absence of AMP-PNP were 100 ms, and for R334C-CFTR in the presence of additional AMP-PNP or for a dual mutant R334C/K1250A, bin widths were 500 and 1000 ms, respectively. For outside-out macropatch experiments, we used pClamp 9.0 to fit the time course of covalent modification of CFTR currents using an exponential function to obtain the time constant, τ, which was converted to a rate coefficient with units of M–1 s–1 by dividing by [MTSET+] or [MTSES–]. In all experiments, we compared the quality of the fit of the data by a single exponential function and the fit by the sum of two exponentials by assessing the values of the correlation coefficient and S.D., as well as by visual inspection of the goodness of fit to the data trace itself. For those experiments where the data were described best by a single exponential function (Figs. 2A, 5B, and 7A), fitting the data with the sum of two exponentials led to 1) a smaller correlation coefficient, 2) a larger S.D. value, and 3) poor superimposition of the fit line on top of the data trace.FIGURE 5MTSET+-induced modification of R334C/K1250A-CFTR and R334C/K464A-CFTR.

The kinetics of modification of R334C/K1250A-CFTR by MTSET+ at Vm = –80 mV also were described best by the sum of two exponential functions, having values of τ1 = 12.9 s and τ2 = 126 s in this experiment. In contrast, the kinetics of modification of R334C/K464A-CFTR by MTSET+ were fit best with a first-order exponential function, with τ = 1.92 s in this experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 7MTSES–-induced modification of R334C-CFTR and R334C/K1250A-CFTR.

MTSET+ and MTSES– were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. MTSET+ and MTSES– were first suspended in deionized water at a concentration of 100 mm, frozen in aliquots at –20 °C, and thawed and diluted into recording solution immediately before use. L-15 medium was from Invitrogen. PKA was from Promega (Madison, WI). Statistics—Unless otherwise noted, values given are mean ± S.E. for n observations.

R334C Channels Are Modified by MTSET+ Only in the Closed State—We have shown previously that the MTSET+-induced covalent modification of a cysteine engineered at CFTR position 334 (in transmembrane domain 6) increased single channel conductance without altering gating properties (17Zhang Z.-R.

Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 407-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In contrast, WT-CFTR does not respond to either MTSET+ or MTSES– when these reagents are applied to the outside surface of the membrane (data not shown; see Ref. 18Smith S.S. Liu X. Zhang Z.-R. Sun F. Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 407-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Excised, inside-out patch clamp recordings in which the pipette was backfilled with MTSET+ allowed us to watch the process of modification in real time as the MTSET+ diffused to the electrode tip and deposited positive charge at the engineered cysteine (Fig. 1A). Despite hours of recording of R334C-CFTR channels, the process of modification was observed to occur only during the closed interval (i.e. sometime between the last opening with lower conductance and the first opening with higher conductance). This observation led us to hypothesize that modification of R334C-CFTR might be favored by the closed state. To test this hypothesis, we coupled the R334C mutation with a mutation at the Walker lysine of NBD2, K1250A, which prolongs the open burst duration of CFTR channels (21Carson M.B. Travis M.S.M Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1711-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 22Powe Jr., A.C. Al-Nakkash L. Li M. Hwang T.-C. J.

Fig. 1B shows a recording of a single R334C/K1250A-CFTR channel, where the electrode was backfilled with 200 μm MTSET+. Modification was delayed until the channel transitioned to a brief closed state. Upon reopening, channel amplitude was increased, reflecting covalent modification by MTSET+. Hence, even when Po was increased by the K1250A mutation, modification at R334C did not take place in the open state. These observations strongly suggest that modification of R334C-CFTR by MTSET+ is favored by the closed state. As shown in Fig. 1A and reported previously (17Zhang Z.-R. Cui G. Liu X. Song B. Dawson D.C. McCarty N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 458-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), R334C-CFTR channels exhibit stable subconductance behavior, including transitions to s1, s2, and f conductance states. In contrast, all of the open bursts of R334C/K1250A-CFTR before modification lacked transitions between conductance states and were “locked” in the s2 state (Fig. 1B). Following MTSET+-induced modification, R334C/K1250A-CFTR channels opened to, and remained locked in, the s2 state. Amplitudes for the s2 state in R334C/K1250A-CFTR were not significantly different from the amplitudes of the s2 state of R334C-CFTR before and after modification (p = 0.85) (17Zhang Z.-R. Cui G. Liu X. Song B. Dawson D.C. McCarty N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 458-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These data suggest that interruption of the ATP-dependent gating cycle leads to stabilization of the pore conformation, resulting in fewer transitions between the three open conductance levels characteristic of R334C-CFTR; this provides further support for the notion that transitions between open conductance levels in CFTR channels are linked to NBD-mediated gating events. Macroscopic Kinetics of Modification Were Altered in the Presence of AMP-PNP—If modification of R334C-CFTR is favored by the closed state, we would expect to observe a slowing of the macroscopic time course of modification under conditions that increase Po. To test this hypothesis, we studied outside-out macropatches pulled from oocytes expressing R334C-CFTR (17Zhang Z.-R. Cui G. Liu X. Song B. Dawson D.C. McCarty N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 458-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Following steady state activation by ATP and PKA in the pipette, the outside surface of the membrane was rapidly exposed to a solution containing 10 μm MTSET+. Under standard conditions, where the pipette solution contained ATP, rapid exposure to MTSET+ caused an increase in macroscopic current (Fig. 2A); the time course of modification in all four experiments of this type was best described by a first-order exponential, with time constant τ = 5.93 ± 1.37 s (TABLE ONE). We converted the time constant to a modification rate coefficient as described under “Experimental Procedures,” giving a value of 18,922 ± 3,218 M–1 s–1. To increase the Po of R334C-CFTR channels, we included a poorly hydrolyzable ATP analogue, AMP-PNP, at 2.75 mm in addition to ATP in the pipette (24Hwang T.-C. Nagel G. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4698-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 25Gadsby D.C. Dousmanis A.G. Nairn A.C. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; : 247-256PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows that the increase in macroscopic current upon exposure of R334C-CFTR channels to MTSET+ in the presence of cytosolic ATP + AMP-PNP exhibited a somewhat different time course compared with experiments with ATP alone. Although we expected a much slower modification process, the kinetics of modification in the presence of AMP-PNP were fit best with the sum of two exponential functions, with time constants τ1 = 4.35 ± 0.9 s (fractional amplitude: 69 ± 4%) and τ2 = 157 ± 14.9 s (fractional amplitude 31 ± 4%; TABLE ONE). The modification rate coefficients were 20,636 ± 4,984 M–1 s–1, and 684 ± 93 m–1 s–1, respectively. Hence, modification of R334C-CFTR in the presence of mixtures of ATP and AMP-PNP occurred in two phases. The value of the time constant describing the faster phase of modification in the presence of AMP-PNP (τ1) was not statistically different from the single time constant (τ) in the presence of ATP alone (p = 0.362), nor were the modification rate coefficients different (p = 0.286). WT-CFTR channels in the presence of mixtures of ATP and AMP-PNP alternate between openings of normal duration, when ATP is bound at both NBDs, and prolonged openings, when AMP-PNP is bound at NBD2 (26Fuller M.D. Zhang Z.-R. Cui G. Kubanek J. McCarty N.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1328-C1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 27Fuller M.D. Zhang Z.-R. Cui G. McCarty N.A. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 1-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The slower phase of macroscopic modification in the presence of AMP-PNP may reflect the process of modification of those channels that are locked into a long open burst. The faster phase of modification in the presence of AMP-PNP may reflect the modification process of channels exhibiting open bursts of normal duration.TABLE ONEKinetics of modification of R334C under a variety of conditionsCondition1 mm ATP0.2 mm ATP1 mm ATP1 mm ATP + 2.75 mm AMP-PNP1 mm ATP1 mm ATP1 mm ATP1 mm ATPMutantR334CR334CR334C/K464AR334CR334C/K1250AR334CR334CR334C/K1250A[MTSET+] (μm)101010101050[MTSES-] (μm)5050τ (s) (n)5.93 ± 1.37 (4)5.88 ± 0.49 (5)2.44 ± 0.27 (3)aSignificant difference from value for R334C-CFTR with 1 mm ATP, exposed to 10 μm MTSET+.4.35 ± 0.9 and 157 ± 14.9 (5)12.5 ± 0.94 and 225 ± 29 (5)aSignificant difference from value for R334C-CFTR with 1 mm ATP, exposed to 10 μm MTSET+.2.73 ± 0.24 (5)4.23 ± 0.18 (3)bSignificant difference from value for R334C-CFTR with 1 mm ATP, exposed to 50 μm MTSET+.11.3 ± 0.7 and 132 ± 30.1 (5)a Significant difference from value for R334C-CFTR with 1 mm ATP, exposed to 10 μm MTSET+.b Significant difference from value for R334C-CFTR with 1 mm ATP, exposed to 50 μm MTSET+. Open table in a new tab To understand better the results from macropatch experiments, we performed detached inside-out single channel recordings in R334C-CFTR, in the presence of ATP + AMP-PNP, using the real time modification approach. In Fig. 3, three traces shown are from the same patch containing at least three active channels; traces A, B, and C are from near the beginning, near the middle, and near the end of the experiment, respectively. One can clearly see that there are two populations of open bursts that differ in duration; the vast majority of openings are brief, such as those seen in the absence of AMP-PNP, whereas other prolonged openings arise from channels that are locked open (arrow in trace A). During real time modification by MTSET+, channel openings increased in amplitude but with different time courses. All modified openings in the middle trace were brief ones, whereas the prolonged openings remained unmodified, and all openings in the third trace were already modified. On average, the first modified prolonged opening appeared 147.6 ± 43.2 s later than the first modified brief opening; in five of six patches, all brief openings were modified before the first prolonged one was modified. Furthermore, the prolonged unmodified openings and prolonged modified openings induced by AMP-PNP were “locked” in the s2 state, as was found for R334C/K1250A-CFTR with ATP alone, and the s2 state amplitudes were virtually identical to those for the s2 state of R334C-CFTR in the presence of ATP alone (p > 0.5). The data in Figs. 2 and 3 suggested that in the presence of mixtures of ATP and AMP-PNP, one population of channels exhibits prolonged burst durations, making them less reactive toward MTSET+, whereas the other population gates to the closed state more normally, making them more likely to react with MTSET+. We analyzed the mean burst duration of unmodified R334C-CFTR channels either in the presence of ATP alone (Fig. 4A) or in the presence of ATP + AMP-PNP (Fig. 4C). Burst duration dwell time histograms (Fig. 4, B and D) were constructed from multiple patches, as described (19Zhang Z.-R. Zeltwanger S. McCarty N.A. J. Membr.

The tumor suppressor protein p53 plays a fundamental role in protecting the organism against the emergence of cell populations with an abnormal genotype. The protein is present at low levels in normal cells due to its rapid turnover. In response to various types of genotoxic stress, it is stabilized and regulates the expression of genes that mediate cell cycle arrest and DNA repair or trigger apoptosis. Mice with a null mutation of the TP53 gene show a high incidence of tumor formation, and a large proportion of human cancers have a somatic mutation either in the TP53 gene itself or in genes that encode components of the p53-regulated stress response pathway (1Levine A.J.

Mutated p53 fails to induce endogenous Mdm2 and is therefore longer lived than transcriptionally competent wild type (WT) p53. In addition to being a transcriptional activator, p53 has also been reported to suppress numerous promoters. Among these are the β-fibrinogen, IL-6, insulin receptor, and albumin gene promoters when linked to reporter genes. Whereas the exact mechanism of transcriptional repression by p53 in these cases remained unclear, an interference with C/EBP-dependent transactivation seemed to be involved (14Wang L. Rayanade R.J.

CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) belong to the superfamily of transcription factors characterized by the basic region/leucine zipper (bZIP) structure (18Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2513) Google Scholar). To date, six members of the C/EBP family have been identified: C/EBPα,-β,-δ,-ϵ,-γ, and -ζ (19Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). C/EBPs play a fundamental role in differentiation processes and reproductive function. Ablation of the C/EBPβ gene in mice leads to defective mammary gland differentiation and failure to ovulate (20Seagroves T.N. Krnacik S. Raught B. Gay J. Burgess-Beusse B. Darlington G.J. Rosen J.M.

The C/EBPβ mRNA gives rise to two protein isoforms, the so-called liver-enriched activatory protein (LAP) and the liver-enriched inhibitory protein (LIP). The latter is a truncated form lacking the N-terminal transactivation domains of LAP and antagonizes the transcriptional activity of other C/EBP isoforms (25Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). The most likely explanation for the generation of LAP and LIP is alternative translation initiation, with initiation at codons Met1 or Met24 in the human C/EBPβ mRNA resulting in LAP proteins of 36- and 33.5-kDa molecular mass and initiation at the downstream codon Met199 giving rise to the 16-kDa repressor LIP (26Calkhoven C.F. Muller C. Leutz A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1920-1932PubMed Google Scholar). However, a proteolytic mechanism has also been proposed to explain the presence of LIP in tissue extracts, at least in rodents (27Baer M. Johnson P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26582-26590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The leucine zipper of C/EBPs accommodates formation of a multitude of homo- and heterodimers between activator and/or repressor isoforms (19Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). In addition, C/EBPs have been found to interact with members of other families of transcription factors, such as helix-loop-helix (28Lu M. Seufert J. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28349-28359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), zinc finger (29Stein B. Yang M.X. Mol. Cell.

We have previously described up-regulation of C/EBPβ and p53 in the course of decidualization of human endometrial stromal cells (ESC) (32Pohnke Y. Kempf R. Gellersen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24808-24818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 33Pohnke Y. Schneider-Merck T. Fahnenstich J. Kempf R. Christian M. Milde-Langosch K. Brosens J.J. Gellersen B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 5233-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This differentiation process occurs in the late secretory phase of the menstrual cycle and prepares the uterine lining for implantation of the blastocyst. In primary cultures of human ESC, decidualization can be induced by several days of treatment with cAMP analogues. An exquisite marker of decidualization is activation of the decidual prolactin (dPRL) gene (34Gellersen B. Brosens J.J. J. Endocrinol. 2003; 178: 357-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The dPRL promoter is induced by the activating form of C/EBPβ, LAP, and this induction was found to be antagonized by p53 (33Pohnke Y. Schneider-Merck T. Fahnenstich J. Kempf R. Christian M. Milde-Langosch K. Brosens J.J. Gellersen B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 5233-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this study, we characterize the functional interaction between C/EBPβ and p53 and describe a mutual transrepression between these two classes of transcription factors. Cell Culture—Saos-2 human osteosarcoma cells (HTB-85; American Type Culture Collection) and COS-7 African Green Monkey kidney cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Primary cultures of human ESC were prepared as detailed previously (33Pohnke Y. Schneider-Merck T. Fahnenstich J. Kempf R. Christian M. Milde-Langosch K. Brosens J.J. Gellersen B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 5233-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) from anonymous biopsy samples obtained from premenopausal women at the time of hysterectomy for benign gynecological disorders. Informed consent was obtained, and the study was approved by the local ethics committee. ESC were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12, 10% steroid-depleted fetal calf serum, and antibiotics as above. Stimulations were performed in the same medium supplemented with insulin (1 μg/ml) and 10–9 m 17-β-estradiol. Transient Transfection and Protein Extraction—Transient transfections for luciferase reporter gene assays were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions or by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously in triplicates using 24-well plates (growth area 1.88 cm2) (35Gellersen B. Kempf R. Telgmann R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). One μg of reporter construct and amounts of expression vector as indicated in the figure legends were used. Controls received equimolar amounts of empty expression vector, and total DNA was kept constant by the addition of promoterless plasmid DNA. Medium was replaced 16 h later, and cells were harvested 24 h after medium replacement. Luciferase activity was measured with the luciferase reagent kit (Promega). Transfections were repeated at least three times, and the means of three or four independent experiments were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test. Cross-linking, Co-immunoprecipitation—Saos-2 cells were transfected with p53 and C/EBPβ expression constructs. Thirty h post-transfection, monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and subjected to reversible cross-linking with the cell-permeable, thiol-cleavable reagent dithiobis(succinimidyl)propionate. Cells were exposed to dithiobis(succinimidyl)propionate (5 mm) for 30 min at room temperature, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of Tris, pH 7.5, to 20 mm. After 15 min, monolayers were washed with PBS and extracted with radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors (Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture; Roche Applied Science). Whole cell extracts (300 μg) were preabsorbed with anti-hemagglutinin-agarose conjugate (Sigma) for 2 h at 4°C. Supernatants were retrieved and immunoprecipitated with 15 μl of slurry of p53 monoclonal antibody DO-1 cross-linked to agarose beads (Oncogene Research Products) overnight at 4 °C. After five washes in radioimmune precipitation buffer, immunocomplexes were disrupted, and disulfide bonds were cleaved by heating the beads in SDS gel loading buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol (10 min, 95 °C). Primary ESC were treated with 0.5 mm 8-bromoadenosine cAMP (8-Br-cAMP; Biolog, Bremen, Germany) for 6 days before harvest. Monolayers were washed once with ice-cold PBS and scraped in PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100. Cells were allowed to swell on ice for 5–15 min and sonicated for 3 × 5 s, and the lysate was incubated on ice for 30 min to solubilize proteins and cleared by microcentrifuging for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatant containing 200 μg of protein was incubated with anti-p53 DO-1 agarose as described above. Immunocomplexes were washed six times with PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 and disrupted by heating the sediment in SDS gel loading buffer. SDS-PAGE, Western Blotting, and Immunodetection—Proteins were electrophoresed on 10–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (NuPage BisTris; Invitrogen) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon membranes (Millipore Corp.). Immunodetection was performed with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (SuperSignal; Pierce). Rabbit antibodies against C/EBPβ (C-19; 100 μg/ml) and p53 (FL-393; 2 mg/ml) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). An antiserum against the N terminus of C/EBPβ (LAP-specific) was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Monoclonal FLAG antibody M2 (2 mg/ml) was from Stratagene, and monoclonal p53 antibodies DO-1 (Ab-6) (0.1 mg/ml) and PAb421 (1 mg/ml) were from Oncogene. The following dilutions were used for Western blot analysis: C/EBPβ antisera, 1:1000; p53 FL-393, 1:5000; all monoclonal antibodies, 1:1000. Secondary antibodies (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG; Dianova) were employed at a dilution of 1:2500 and 1:10,000, respectively. For detection of immunoprecipitated proteins with monoclonal antibodies, peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, F(ab′)2 fragment-specific, was used (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 1:5000. Indirect Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—ESC were seeded on 4-well chamber slides (BD Falcon) at 1.1 × 105 cells/well and treated with 8-Br-cAMP (0.5 mm) for 6 days. Cells were fixed with MetOH (10 min, –20 °C), washed with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with normal goat serum. Monoclonal antibody to p53 (PAb421) and polyclonal antibody to C/EBPβ (LAP-specific; Cell Signaling Technology) were diluted in PBS (1:100). Following a 1-h incubation at room temperature and washing, secondary antibodies diluted in PBS, 2% normal goat serum (Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:100) and Cy2-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:50)) (Dianova) were added for 1 h. Nuclei were counterstained with TO-PRO-3 (1:1000; Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR)) for 5 min. Slides were mounted with ProLong Antifade (Molecular Probes), and images were captured with an AxioPlan2 confocal microscope (Zeiss). Reporter Constructs and Expression Vectors—All luciferase gene reporter constructs were generated in the pGL3-Basic plasmid (Promega). The dPRL promoter/luciferase reporter fusion construct dPRL-332/luc3, the minimal promoter construct dPRL-32/luc3, and the C/EBP-responsive reporter construct CEBP-RE/–32/luc3 (previously designated NFIL6RE/luc3) have been described elsewhere (32Pohnke Y. Kempf R. Gellersen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24808-24818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A reporter construct with the minimal rat PRL promoter element –36/+36 in pGL2-Basic (Promega) was provided by Dr. M. G. Rosenfeld (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, San Diego, CA). The insert was isolated by restriction with BglII and HindIII and cloned into the respective sites in pGL3-Basic to yield –36rPRL/luc3. The p53-responsive reporter plasmid p53-RE/–36rPRL/luc3 was generated based on the yeast one-hybrid control reporter vector p53BLUE (Clontech), which carries a p53-responsive region in the reporter plasmid pLacZi. The response element was amplified by PCR using primers flanking the response element: LacZ-sense (5′-CTTCTGTTCGGAGATTACC-3′) and LacZ-antisense (5′-ATGCTACAAAGGACCTAATG-3′). The PCR product was inserted into the Ecl136II site of –36rPRL/luc3 upstream of the rPRL promoter element. To construct a reporter vector for mammalian one-hybrid experiments, 2×LEX/–36rPLR/luc3, two complementary oligonucleotides (sense sequence, 5′-TACTGCTGTATATAAAACCAGTGGTTATATGTACAGTACTcgagg-3′) containing the LexA operon sequence and an overhang (lowercase) to include an XhoI site (underlined) were annealed, cut with XhoI, and ligated head-to-tail. The resulting dimer was inserted into the SmaI site of –36rPRL/luc3. Human p53 expression vectors pcDNA/p53 and pcDNA/p53/FLAG (carrying a C-terminal FLAG epitope) have been described (33Pohnke Y. Schneider-Merck T. Fahnenstich J. Kempf R. Christian M. Milde-Langosch K. Brosens J.J. Gellersen B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 5233-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Residues Leu22 and Trp23 of p53 were mutated to Gln and Ser by site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange system and Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) on template pcDNA/p53/FLAG to generate pcDNA/p53.M22,23/FLAG. Two complementary oligonucleotides were used, which introduced the two point mutations (lowercase) in codons 22 and 23 (boldface) and destroyed a unique AclI site (underlined) for diagnostic purposes: 5′-TCAGACCaATcGAAACTACTTCCTGAAAACAAtGTTCTGTCCC-3′ (sense sequence). Arg175 was changed to His by site-directed mutagenesis using complementary oligonucleotides with a point mutation (lowercase) in codon 175 (boldface) and a point mutation (lowercase) to destroy an Eco47III site (underlined) for diagnostic purposes to yield pcDNA/p53.M175/FLAG: 5′-GAGGCaCTGCCCCCACCATGAGCGtTGCTC-3′ (sense sequence). An expression vector with the tetramerization and regulatory domains deleted, pcDNA/p53ΔT4-RR/FLAG, was constructed as follows; the HindIII-Eco0109I fragment of pcDNA/p53/FLAG, reaching from the 5′-end of the inserted cDNA to just 5′ of the FLAG sequence, was removed, and the Eco0109I overhang was filled in (pcDNA-FLAG). The HindIII-SspI fragment of pcDNA/p53/FLAG from the 5′-end of the cDNA to the codon for Tyr327 was isolated and inserted into pcDNA-FLAG, resulting in a deletion of amino acids 327–389. For construction of a vector with deletion of the TAD, pcDNA/p53ΔTAD/FLAG, aa 1–65 were removed. A sense primer was designed that spans the codon for Met66 of p53 and creates a Kozak consensus sequence around this triplet (boldface) by three mutations (lowercase) and a 5′-HindIII site (underlined) by one mutation (lower-case): 5′-CAGATGAAGCTtCCAccATGgCAGAGGCTG-3′. This primer was paired with an antisense primer anchored in pcDNA3.1(+) downstream of the polylinker for PCR on template pcDNA/p53/FLAG. The PCR product was digested with HindIII and ApaI and inserted into the respective sites of pcDNA3.1(+). p53 expression constructs in pcDNA3.1 were subjected to in vitro transcription/translation using the TNT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in a final volume of 25 μl in the presence of [35S]methionine. For mammalian one-hybrid analysis, the DBD of the LexA repressor was fused to p53, using the vector pLexApolyII (kindly provided by Dr. Jean Schneikert, Institute for Genetics, Research Center Karlsruhe, Germany). FLAG-tagged WT p53 cDNA was amplified from pcDNA/p53/FLAG with a 5′-primer mutating the start codon and introducing a BamHI site and a 3′-primer anchored downstream of the polylinker. The BamHI-restricted amplicon was inserted into the BamHI site of pLexApolyII to yield pLex/p53/FLAG. Expression vector for human p300 (pCMVβ-NHA-p300) was kindly provided by Dr. David Livingston (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA) (36Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Expression vectors for human C/EBPs in pSG5 (pSG-C/EBPβ, pSG/LAP, pSG/LIP) have been described previously (32Pohnke Y. Kempf R. Gellersen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24808-24818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The LAP insert was excised with EcoRI and BglII and inserted into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pcDNA3.1(–) (Invitrogen) to yield pcDNA/LAP. For construction of pcDNA/LIP, a restriction fragment was prepared from pSG-C/EBPβ extending from the SacII site 49 bp upstream of Met199 to the BglII site in the 3′-polylinker of pSG5. The SacII overhang was polished, and the fragment was inserted into the EcoRV and BamHI sites of pcDNA3.1(–). On template pSG/LIP, the insert was amplified by PCR with an upstream primer mutating the start ATG (Met199) and adding an EcoRV site and a downstream primer mutating the stop codon and attaching a FLAG epitope followed by a NotI site. After restriction of the amplicon with EcoRV and NotI, it was inserted into the respective sites of pVP22/Myc-His (Invitrogen). From this construct (pVP22/LIP-FLAG), the Bpu1102I-PmeI fragment was isolated (encompassing the 3′-end of LIP cDNA and the FLAG-, Myc-, and His6 epitopes) and used to replace the Bpu1102I-HindIII (blunted) fragment of pcDNA/LIP. The resultant vector pcDNA/LIP-FLAG carries the LIP cDNA with 3′ FLAG-, Myc-, and His6 epitopes. The vector pcDNA/LAP-FLAG was generated by discarding the 5′ NheI-Bpu1102I fragment from pcDNA/LIP-FLAG and replacing it with the NheI-Bpu1102I fragment retrieved from pcDNA/LAP. GST Pull-down Assays—GST pull-down assays were performed essentially as detailed elsewhere using pGEX/LAP and pGEX/LIP for bacterial expression of GST fusion proteins (37Christian M. Pohnke Y. Kempf R. Gellersen B. Brosens J.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 141-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). GST, GST-LAP, or GST-LIP, immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), were incubated with 50 μlof 35S-labeled in vitro translation product generated from p53 expression vectors, and bound material was eluted and electrophoresed in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Five μlofthe in vitro translation reaction was loaded on the gel as the input of 35S signal. The gel was dried, and proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear proteins were extracted by the high salt procedure (35Gellersen B. Kempf R. Telgmann R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 38Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W.

Double-stranded oligonucleotides used as probes or competitors for EMSA were dPRL promoter fragment dPRL–332/–270, and consensus binding sites for C/EBP (CEBP-RE), p53 (p53-RE), and Ets-1/PEA3 (Ets-RE) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Per binding reaction, 5 μg of nuclear protein, unless indicated otherwise, and 10,000 cpm of probe were used. For probe dPRL–332/–270, the following binding buffer (BP-high salt) was employed: 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 60 mm KCl, 1.25 mm spermidine, 3.5% Ficoll, and 0.02 units poly(dI-dC) (Roche Applied Science). Precoincubations of two different protein preparations were performed overnight at 4 °C. For binding to p53-RE and C/EBP-RE, the following buffer (Bf-B) was used: 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.02 units of poly(dI-dC). After the addition of probe, incubation was continued for 40 min at 4 °C. For supershift analyses, antibody (1–2 μl/reaction) was added for an additional 20-min incubation at room temperature. The following antibodies were employed: monoclonal p53 antibodies clone PAb421 (1 μl) and clone DO-1 (2 μl) (Oncogene); polyclonal antibody to C/EBPδ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal antibodies to C/EBPβ raised against a peptide corresponding to residues 258–276 of rat C/EBPβ (C-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (1 μl) or directed against residues 228–242 of human C/EBPβ (Active Motif) (2 μl), C-terminal antibody to human Ets-1/Ets-2 (C-275; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (2 μl), and monoclonal FLAG antibody M2 (Stratagene) (1 μl).

A directed evolution strategy combining error-prone PCR, saturation mutagenesis, and DNA shuffling was used to improve the polychlorinated biphenyl-degrading potential of DoxG. Screening was facilitated through analysis of filtered, digital imaging of plated colonies. A simple scheme, which is readily adaptable to other activities, enabled the screening of >105 colonies/h. The best variant, designated DoxGSMA2, cleaved 3,4-DHB with an apparent specificity constant of 2.0 ± 0.3 × 106 m-1 s-1, which is 770 times that of wild-type (WT) DoxG. The specificities of DoxGSMA2 for 1,2-DHN and 2,3-DHB were increased by 6.7-fold and reduced by 2-fold, respectively, compared with the WT enzyme. DoxGSMA2 contained three substituted residues with respect to the WT enzyme: L190M, S191W, and L242S. Structural data indicate that the side chains of residues 190 and 242 occur on opposite walls of the substrate binding pocket and may interact directly with the distal ring of 3,4-DHB or influence contacts between this substrate and other residues. Thus, the introduction of two bulkier residues on one side of the substrate binding pocket and a smaller residue on the other may reshape the binding pocket and alter the catalytically relevant interactions of 3,4-DHB with the enzyme and dioxygen.

Nevertheless, even the “best” strains poorly transform congeners containing more than four chloro substituents, and none completely degrades all lightly chlorinated congeners. For example, one of the best PCB-degrading strains, Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 (previously Pseudomonas sp. LB400 (1Bopp L.H. J. Ind. Microbiol. 1986; 1: 23-29Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar)), possesses the unusual ability to transform 2,2′,5,5′-tetrachlorobiphenyl; however, it is transformed to the corresponding 3,4-dihydroxybiphenyl, a dead-end metabolite. polychlorinated biphenyl 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 3,4-dihydroxybiphenyl 2-hydroxy-4-phenyl-6-oxo-hexa-2,4-dienoic acid 2-hydroxy-5-phenyl-6-oxo-hexa-2,4-dienoic acid 2-hydroxy-6-phenyl-6-oxo-hexa-2,4-dienoic acid high performance liquid chromatography Luria-Bertani wild-type. Efforts to improve the PCB-degrading capabilities of natural isolates have included the engineering of bph enzymes to transform a broader range of congeners and the introduction of downstream pathways to degrade the chlorobenzoates produced by bph (2Gibson D.T. Parales R.E. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2000; 11: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Most of the engineering has focused on the catalytic component of biphenyl dioxygenase (bphA1-2), the first enzyme of the pathway (3Barriault D. Sylvestre M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47480-47488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 4Furukawa K. Suenaga H. Goto M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5189-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 5Suenaga H. Mitsuoka M. Ura Y. Watanabe T. Furukawa K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5441-5444Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The large subunit of biphenyl dioxygenase harbors the principal determinants of the enzyme substrate specificity. Accordingly, the corresponding genes from divergent bacterial strains have been subjected to DNA shuffling, generating variants possessing improved rates of transforming certain PCB congeners (6Barriault D. Plante M.M. Sylvestre M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3794-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 7Kumamaru T. Suenaga H. Mitsuoka M. Watanabe T. Furukawa K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). As might be expected, this focus on the first enzyme of the pathway is not a complete solution inasmuch as other bph enzymes are inhibited by certain PCB metabolites. For example, 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase, a ring-cleaving enzyme, is inhibited by 2′,6′-dichloro DHB (8Dai S. Vaillancourt F.H. Maaroufi H. Drouin N.M. Neau D.B. Snieckus V. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 934-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 9Fortin P.D. Lo A.T. Haro M.A. Kaschabek S.R. Reineke W. Eltis L.D. J.

Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and BphD, a serine hydrolase, is inhibited by 3-Cl and 4-Cl 2-hydroxy-6-phenyl-6-oxo-hexa-2,4-dienoic acids (HOPDAs) (11Seah S.Y. Labbe G. Kaschabek S.R. Reifenrath F. Reineke W. Eltis L.D. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1511-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). There have been no reports of successful attempts to overcome these metabolic blocks by engineering these enzymes. Strains that degrade other biaryls provide an underexploited source of PCB-transforming enzymes. For example, DoxG, an extradiol dioxygenase involved in naphthalene degradation by Pseudomonas sp. strain C18, catalyzes the extradiol cleavage of 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene (1,2-DHN) (Fig. 2A) (12Denome S.A. Stanley D.C. Olson E.S. Young K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6890-6901Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it also catalyzes the cleavage of 2,3-DHB, 3,4-DHB, and 2,2′,5,5′-tetrachloro-3,4-DHB, albeit with low specificity (13Barriault D. Durand J. Maaroufi H. Eltis L.D. Sylvestre M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 4637-4642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Distal and proximal extradiol cleavage of 3,4-DHB by DoxG yielded two products, 2-hydroxy-4-phenyl-6-oxo-hexa-2,4-dienoic acid (4-phenyl-HODA, Fig. 2B) and 5-phenyl HODA (Fig. 2C), in a 2.8:1 ratio. Recent crystal structures of DoxG (1.7 Å resolution) and its complexes with 1,2-DHN (1.5 Å), 2,3-DHB (1.9 Å), and 3,4-DHB (1.6 Å) revealed that the enzyme possesses a relatively open and adaptable substrate pocket that permits variations in the association of the hydroxylated ring with the iron atom as well as changes in the conformations of active site residues (27Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14517-14520Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This suggests that the DoxG substrate binding pocket would be a good starting point for engineering experiments. Such efforts would be further facilitated by the development of improved high throughput screens for PCB-degrading activities. In the present study, a directed evolution strategy combining errorprone PCR, saturation mutagenesis and DNA shuffling was used to improve the 3,4-DHB-cleaving capabilities of DoxG. A simple and versatile high-throughput colorimetric screening method was developed. The specificity of DoxG and DoxGSMA2 for 1,2-DHN, 2,3-DHB, and 3,4-DHB was investigated. The effects of the observed mutations are discussed with respect to crystal structures of enzyme-substrate complexes. Chemicals—2,3-DHB was a kind gift from Dr. Victor Snieckus (14Nerdinger S. Marchhart R. Riebel P. Kendall C. Johnson M.R. Yin C.F. Snieckus V. Eltis L.D. Chem. Commun. 1999; : 2259-2260Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 3,4-DHB was from ULTRA Scientific (North Kingstown, RI). 1,2-DHN was from Sigma-Aldrich. Ferene S was from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). All other chemicals were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. Strains, Media, and Growth—Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used for DNA propagation and was cultured at 37 °C and 200 rpm in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth with the appropriate antibiotics. Pseudomonas putida KT2442 (15Herrero M. de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6557-6567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar) transformed with pVLT31 (16de Lorenzo V. Eltis L. Kessler B. Timmis K.N. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) derivatives was used for overexpression and was cultured at 30 °C and 250 rpm in LB with 20 μg/ml tetracycline supplemented with phosphate buffer and mineral salts as previously described (17Vaillancourt F.H. Han S. Fortin P.D. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34887-34895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). E. coli Nova Blue DE3 (EMD Biosciences, Inc.) and pT7-7 (18Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar) derivatives were used to screen libraries of enzyme variants and for overexpression. The libraries were grown on 110 LB agar plates (1 g of Tryptone extract, 0.5 g of yeast extract, 10 g of NaCl, and 15 g of agar/liter) containing 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside and 100 mg/liter ampicillin at a colony density of 15-20 colonies/cm2. DNA Manipulation—Plasmid DNA was propagated, purified, digested, and amplified according to standard procedures (19Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000Google Scholar). Sequencing was performed using an ABI 373 Stretch instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using Big-Dye 3.1 terminators. For directed evolution experiments, doxG was cloned into pT7-7. Briefly, the gene was amplified from pMPVDG (13Barriault D. Durand J. Maaroufi H. Eltis L.D. Sylvestre M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 4637-4642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using two oligonucleotides: 5′doxG (5′-GAGATTCCATATGAGTAAGCAAGCTGCAGT-3′; an NdeI site is underlined) and 3′doxG (5′-CGGGATCCTTAGCTCAGTT-TTACATCCAGGC-3′; a C.BamH1 site is underlined). The PCR reaction was performed using Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions and at an annealing temperature of 45 °C. The resulting amplicon was digested with NdeI and C.BamHI and cloned in pT7-7, yielding pT7doxG. The sequence of the cloned gene was verified. To obtain the L242S variant, the 595-bp NdeI/BclI fragment of pT7doxG was ligated to the 2776-bp NdeI/BclI fragment of the vector encoding DoxGSMA2 (see “Results”). The L190M/S191W double variant was similarly obtained using the 2776-bp NdeI/BclI fragment of pT7doxG and the 595-bp NdeI/BclI fragment of the vector carrying DoxGSMA2. Protein Purification—DoxGSMA2 was purified from E. coli Nova Blue DE3 freshly transformed with a pT7-7 vector carrying the doxG variant. The cell pellet originating from a 4-liter culture was resuspended in 10 mm Tris, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5. Subsequent manipulations were performed anaerobically as described previously (17Vaillancourt F.H. Han S. Fortin P.D. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34887-34895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The cells were disrupted by three successive passages through a French press (Spectronic Instruments Inc., Rochester, NY) operated at a pressure of 20,000 p.s.i. The cell debris was removed by ultracentrifugation in gas-tight tubes at 37,000 rpm for 40 min in a T1250 rotor (DuPont Instruments). The clear supernatant was carefully decanted and filtered using a 0.45-μm filter (Sartorius AG, Göttingen, Germany). This fluid was referred to as the raw extract. The raw extract was divided into two equal portions (∼15 ml each). Each portion was loaded onto an HR16/10 Mono Q column equilibrated with 10 mm Tris, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5. The enzyme was eluted at a flow of 6 ml/min using a 320-ml linear gradient from 150 to 350 mm NaCl in buffer A. Fractions of 8 ml were collected. Activity-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated to 3 ml by ultrafiltration, and loaded onto a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 column equilibrated with buffer A containing 33 mm ammonium sulfate and 0.25 mm ferrous ammonium sulfate. The protein was eluted at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. Activity-containing fractions (5 ml) were pooled, concentrated to greater than 25 mg/ml protein, and frozen as beads in liquid N2. Purified DoxGSMA2 was stored at -80 °C for up to 6 months without any significant loss of activity. DoxG was overexpressed in P. putida KT2442 freshly transformed with pHMPVDG and purified essentially as described for DoxGSMA2. Directed Evolution—Directed evolution experiments involved three successive steps: 1) error-prone PCR, 2) saturation mutagenesis of select positions, and 3) DNA shuffling. Libraries generated from each step were transformed into E. coli Nova Blue DE3 and screened for increased 3,4-DHB cleavage activity following the protocol described below. Error-prone PCR was carried out according to published protocols (21Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Applications. 1992; 2: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar) using T7For (5′-GACTCACTATAGGGAG-3′) and oT7-7rev2 (5′-CTCATGTTTGACAGCTTATC-3′) as primers. The resulting amplicon was digested with NdeI and BamHI and cloned in pT7-7 to yield a library of doxG variants. Saturation mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange® multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and oligonucleotides containing 32-fold degenerated codons (NN(G/T)) at the target positions. DNA shuffling was performed using the Expand High Fidelityplus polymerase mixture (Roche Applied Science) and the T7For and oT7-7rev2 primers according to published protocols (22Stemmer W.P. Nature. 1994; 370: 389-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). After reassembly, the shuffled variants were amplified using the 5′doxG and 3′doxG primers as described above. The obtained amplicon was digested using NdeI and C.BamHI and cloned in pT7-7. Activity Screening—Libraries of DoxG variants (pT7-7 derivatives) were transformed into E. coli Nova Blue DE3, plated on 15-cm Petri dishes, and grown for 16 h. Colonies were then sprayed with a 5 mm solution of 3,4-DHB; those containing an extradiol 3,4-DHB cleaving activity developed a yellow coloration. To facilitate the visualization and quantification of the resulting degradation products (λmax ≅ 400 nm), images of the plates were captured through a 400-nm optical filter at different time points using a Canon Powershot A80 digital camera (Canon Canada, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) (Fig. 3A). In the resulting images the colonies producing yellow products appeared as dark spots against a light background (Fig. 3B). These spots were quantified using ImageQuant 5.2 (Amersham Biosciences; Fig. 3C). The colonies showing the greatest volume, determined by integration using ImageQuant software, were picked and grown in 96 deep-well plates in 1 ml of LB medium containing 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and 100 mg/liter ampicillin. The cells were harvested, frozen at -80 °C for at least 15 min, and lysed using BugBuster™ (Novagen, San Diego, CA). Activities were measured in the cleared cell lysates using 100 μm 3,4-DHB and phosphate buffer (I = 0.1 m, pH 7.0). Reactions were performed at 25 °C, and ring cleavage was monitored at 405 nm using a Victor 3Supported in part by an National Institutes of Health institutional training award, T32-GM008296. Current address: Center for Advanced Microstructures and Devices, Louisiana State University, 6980 Jefferson Hwy., Baton Rouge, LA 70806. microplate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The cleavage of 2,3-DHB was monitored under similar conditions at 450 nm. Activities were normalized according to the expression level of each DoxG variant. Expression levels were assessed using SyproRuby-stained SDS-PAGE gels imaged using a Typhoon 9410 Imager (Amersham Biosciences). Steady-state Kinetic Measurements and Data Analysis—Ring-cleaving activity was measured by following the consumption of dioxygen using a Clark-type polarographic electrode (Yellow Springs Instrument Co. model 5301, Yellow Springs, OH) as previously described (17Vaillancourt F.H. Han S. Fortin P.D. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34887-34895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed using phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, I = 0.1 m, 25.0 ± 0.1 °C (290 μm dissolved O2) unless otherwise stated. The standard activity assay was performed using 80 μm substrate. The coupling of DHB and O2 consumption was assessed by measuring the amount of O2 consumed after the addition of 110 nmol of either 2,3- or 3,4-DHB. In addition, the yield of HOPDA from the cleavage of 2,3-DHB was assessed spectrophotometrically at 434 nm (ϵ = 11,300 m-1 cm-1 (9Fortin P.D. Lo A.T. Haro M.A. Kaschabek S.R. Reineke W. Eltis L.D. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar)) For kinetic experiments, concentrations of active enzyme in the assay were defined by the iron content of the injected purified enzyme solution and were used in calculating specificity and catalytic constants. Steady-state rate equations were fit to data using the least squares and dynamic weighting options of LEONORA (23Cornish-Bowden A. Analysis of Enzyme Kinetic Data. Oxford University Press, New York, NY1995Google Scholar). For experiments performed using cell extracts, activities were normalized according to the expression level of DoxG, determined by SDS-PAGE analyses as described above. One unit of enzymatic activity was defined as the quantity of enzyme required to consume 1 μmol of O2/per min. HPLC Analysis of Cleavage Products—Reaction products were separated by reverse-phase chromatography using a Waters 2695 separation module equipped with a Waters 2996 photodiode array detector and a C18 symmetry 3.5-μm column (4.6 × 75 mm) (Waters, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Products were eluted using a 20-90% acetonitrile gradient in an aqueous solution of 0.5% phosphoric acid. A library of DoxG variants was generated by random mutagenesis using error-prone PCR. Sequence analysis of 6 randomly selected clones indicated that the mutation rate was 0.7% at the nucleotide level, corresponding to an average of 2 amino acid changes per enzyme variant. This analysis further indicated that the rates of transition and transversion mutation were equivalent. Libraries of more than 200,000 clones were routinely obtained from a single ligation reaction containing 0.15 μg of DNA. A high throughput colorimetric screen was designed to identify DoxG variants with improved specificity for 3,4-DHB. Accordingly, libraries of mutated DoxG were plated on solid medium and sprayed with 5 mm 3,4-DHB. Colonies containing a 3,4-DHB cleavage activity developed the yellow color characteristic of the meta cleavage products (enolate anions). Images were captured through a 400-nm optical filter 2 min after exposure to 3,4-DHB and processed to extract the blue channel (Fig. 3, A-B). In the resulting image the colonies producing yellow products appeared as dark spots against a light background (Fig. 3B). The intensity of these spots was quantified using ImageQuant 5.2 software (Fig. 3C). Analysis of the processed images obtained using a library of randomly mutated DoxG revealed that a small number of colonies (<0.5%) developed more intense color than colonies containing the wild-type enzyme. Attempts to follow the development of the yellow color with time (30-s intervals) were not successful. Colonies associated with spots having the highest pixel intensity were selected for further screening using a 96-well microplate assay. Ninety colonies were picked and grown in 96 deep-well plates in 1 ml of LB medium containing 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside and 100 mg/liter ampicillin. Upon the addition of 0.1 mm 3,4-DHB, 7 DoxG variants showed a 1.6-5-fold increase in cleavage activity versus the wild-type enzyme (TABLE ONE). To confirm that activity increases were not due to differences in expression levels, the activity of the variants was also assayed using 2,3-DHB. Those variants possessing the largest change in activity ratio were further characterized. Analyses of these clones using Sypro Ruby-stained SDS-PAGE revealed that the overall difference in expression levels of the variants was less than 20% (results not shown).TABLE ONERelative activities of selected DoxG variantsLibraryVariantMutationsRelative 3,4-DHB activity (variant/WT)Increase in 3,4-DHB:2,3-DBH activity ratio-fold1WTNone11IP27I154F4.66.6IP33L242S5.11P267LIP36D21E1.8NDV290AIP37I154F412.1L182SI265LK300IIP38H59L1.6NDK165RL253MB1L242S3.843P267LS191TB8L242S3.512P267LQ101R2SA8L242V1.710.0SA12L242T2.663.0SB1L242G6.418.1SB2I154W9.012.3SB4I154W8.812.1SB6S191W3.380.2L242KSC1L190M9.915.3S191YL242ISG12L190Y4.720.9L242I3SMA2L190M9.833.6S191WL242S Open table in a new tab Mapping the mutations onto the structure of the DoxG·3,4-DHB complex revealed that each variant had at least one substitution in a residue that contributes to the substrate binding pocket (Fig. 4A). One notable exception occurred in variant B8. B8 contains the same two substitutions as IP33 (L242S and P267L) in addition to the Q101R substitution. Comparison of the B8 and IP33 suggests that the Q101R mutation increased substrate preference for 3,4-DHB relative to 2,3-DHB by 12-fold (TABLE ONE). This residue is 30 Å away from the enzyme active site iron, yet had a significant effect on the substrate preference of the enzyme. For any given residue, an average of 5.7 amino acid substitutions should be accessible by random mutagenesis (24Miyazaki K. Arnold F.H. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 49: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). To increase the number of substitutions sampled at key positions, four residues were subject to saturation mutagenesis: Ile-154, Leu-190, Ser-191, and Leu242. These residues are located within 14 Å of the enzyme active site iron, and the random mutagenesis results showed that their substitution had a large effect on the enzyme activity (TABLE ONE). To contain the size of the experiment, the residues were mutated pairwise; 154 and 242 in one trial and 190 and 191 in the second. The two resulting libraries consisted of variants containing all possible 20 amino acids at each target position. This strategy allowed us to explore >99.9% of the possible diversity while screening less than 10,000 clones. An initial agar plate-based screening of ∼25,000 clones from each library followed by microplate-based screening of promising clones identified numerous variants displaying 2-10-fold increases in 3,4-DHB cleavage rates using 100 μm 3,4-DHB (TABLE ONE). All variants contained mutations involving hydrophobic residues lining the substrate binding pocket of the enzyme. The 6 best clones with the addition of variants IP27 and IP33 were submitted to DNA shuffling. Sequencing of 5 randomly picked clones indicated that the shuffling efficacy was 2-3 recombination events per clone. A library of ∼25,000 clones was screened for improved 3,4-DHB degrading activity. The most active variant, DoxGSMA2, contained three mutations: L190M, S191W, and L242S (Fig. 5A). This variant was the recombination product of three parental variants: IP33, SB6, and SC1. It is noteworthy that mutations at adjacent residues were recombined by DNA shuffling. DoxGSMA2 was purified anaerobically to apparent homogeneity as summarized in TABLE TWO. Purified DoxGSMA2 contained greater than 96% of its complement of iron and had a specific activity of 1.9 units/mg using 2,3-DHB as substrate. Preparations of DoxG were of a quality similar to that obtained previously (26Neau, D. B. (2004) Structural Studies of the 1,2-Dihydroxynaphthalene Dioxygenase, DoxG, Reveal Features that Permit the Cleavage of 4-Substituted Catechols. Ph.D. thesis, Purdue UniversityGoogle Scholar). WT DoxG and DoxGSMA2 were purified to apparent homogeneity, and steady-state kinetic studies were performed to investigate the combined effect of the three mutations on the specificity of the enzyme. The coupling of DHB and O2 consumption in DoxG and DoxGSMA2 was investigated using an O2 electrode that had been calibrated using 2,3-DHB and 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase from B. xenovorans LB400, a well coupled system (17Vaillancourt F.H. Han S. Fortin P.D. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34887-34895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For both the WT and SMA2 variants, the amount of O2 consumed corresponded within 3% to the amount of 2,3- or 3,4-DHB added to the reaction mixture. In the case of WT DoxG, the addition of 110 nmol of 2,3-DHB resulted in the consumption of 111 ± 3.4 nmol of O2 and the production of 109 ± 1.2 nmol of HOPDA. For DoxGSMA2, 111 ± 3.0 nmol of O2 were consumed, and 110 ± 0.3 nmol of HOPDA were formed. In these assays the complete depletion of the substrate was confirmed by HPLC. These results demonstrate that the consumption of O2 was tightly coupled to the cleavage of DHB in both enzymes.TABLE TWOPurification details of DoxGSMA2Purification stepTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldmgunitsunits/mg%Raw extract7302100.29100Mono Q1001301.3059Superdex 200801501.9070 Open table in a new tab Enzymatic assays were performed in air-saturated phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, (I = 0.1 m) at 25 °C using 1,2-DHN, 2,3-DHB, and 3,4-DHB as substrates (TABLE THREE). The apparent kcat of the variant for 3,4-DHB was increased by a factor of 2.4 relative to the WT enzyme. However, the Km value of the variant for 3,4-DHB was greatly reduced, resulting in specificity 770 times above that of WT enzyme. The specificities of the variant for 1,2-DHN and 2,3-DHB were also changed with respect to the WT enzyme but to much lesser extents (6.7- and 0.5-fold, respectively). Notably, for each substrate, the kcat values of the two enzymes varied by less than a factor of three.TABLE THREEApparent steady-state kinetic parameters of DoxG variantsVariantSubstratekcatKmkcat/Kms−1μm103 m−1 s−1WT1,2-DHN9.6 (0.8)120 (20)77 (7)WT2,3-DHB1.8 (0.04)2.6 (0.3)680 (60)WT3,4-DHB1.6 (0.07)600 (100)2.6 (0.3)DoxGSMA21,2-DHN6.1 (0.3)11.8 (1.9)520 (70)DoxGSMA22,3-DHB0.70 (0.03)2.0 (0.4)350 (60)DoxGSMA23,4-DHB3.8 (0.1)1.9 (0.3)2000 (300) Open table in a new tab As discussed below, the L242S substitution occurs on one side of the substrate binding pocket, whereas the L190M and S191W substitutions occur on the other. To evaluate the effect of these substitutions on the substrate preference of DoxG, the L242S and L190M/S191W variants of DoxG were prepared by fragment ligation, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The relative specific activity of the four variants toward 1,2-DHN, 2,3-DHB, and 3,4-DHB are summarized in TABLE FOUR. Although DoxGSMA2, containing all three mutations, possessed a significantly higher activity toward 3,4-DHB, the two sets of substitutions had opposite effects on the enzyme 3,4-DHB cleavage activity when studied in isolation. Thus, although the 3,4-DHB cleavage activity of the L242S variant was 2.5-fold higher than that of the wild-type enzyme, that of the L190M/S191W variant was 3-fold lower.

As a general rule, conformation of the EF-hand-containing domains in the calmodulin family is “closed” in the absence and “open” in the presence of bound cations; a notable exception is the unusual Ca2+-bound closed domain in the essential light chain of the Ca2+-activated scallop muscle myosin. Here we have reported the 1.8 Å resolution structure of the regulatory domain (RD) of Physarum myosin II in which Ca2+ is bound to a canonical EF-hand that is also in a closed state. The 12th position of the EF-hand loop, which normally provides a bidentate ligand for Ca2+ in the open state, is too far in the structure to participate in coordination of the ion.

To reveal the mechanism behind the regulatory effect of Ca2+, we compared conformational flexibilities of the liganded and unliganded RD.

Conventional myosins (class II) have a fundamental role in muscle contraction and in a variety of cellular motilities. The globular heads of myosins consist of the motor domain responsible for the enzymatic activity and actin binding, and the so-called regulatory domain (RD), 4The abbreviations used are: RDregulatory domainCaMcalmodulinLClight chainELCmyosin essential LCRLCmyosin regulatory LCHCmyosin heavy chainMDmolecular dynamicsr.m.s.root mean squareMES2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid. which acts as a lever arm during force generation, and it is the site of regulation in regulated conventional myosins. The essential and regulatory light chain subunits (ELC and RLC) bind to the lever arm to stabilize its structure. They belong to the EF-hand family of Ca2+-binding proteins, including calmodulin (CaM), the ubiquitous eukaryotic Ca2+ sensor; however, most of the divalent cation-binding sites of ELC and RLC have been lost during evolution. The two heads continue in a long coiled-coil dimer, which is responsible for filament formation under physiological conditions (for a review, see Ref. 1Sellers J.R. Myosins. 1999; 2 (Oxford University Press, Oxford): 1323-1423Google Scholar). Generally, the motor activity is switched on by an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, either by direct binding to the ELC in molluscan myosins (2Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Kalabokis V.N. Perreault-Micale C.L. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1999; 190: 55-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or via the CaM-myosin light chain kinase system in smooth and non-muscle myosins (3Cell Motil.

Each light chain binds to an IQ motif (consensus sequence: IQXXXRGXXXR) of the heavy chain (HC), stabilizing its α-helical structure.

Besides the scallop RD structure, two crystal structures and one homology model of CaM or CaM-like light chains bound to unconventional myosin IQ motifs have been described, but only in the apo-form (14Houdusse A.

We have previously provided evidence that the single inhibitory Ca2+-binding site of Physarum myosin is located in the first EF-hand of ELC, similar to the scallop myosin regulatory Ca2+ site (17Farkas L. Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Nakamura A. Kohama K. Nyitray L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27399-27405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of the EF-hand suggested that the Ca2+-saturated N-terminal lobe of ELC is in a closed state. In the present work, we have reported the structure of the Ca2+-bound Physarum RD at 1.8 Å resolution. The structure unambiguously showed that Ca2+ is indeed bound to a fully closed N-terminal lobe of ELC. Characterization of dynamic properties of both the apo- and the Ca2+-loaded RD by hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments and molecular dynamics simulations enabled us to get a more detailed view of conformational fluctuations following Ca2+ binding. Based on the results, we have proposed a simple model to explain the modulatory effect of Ca2+ on the activity of Physarum myosin, in which Ca2+-induced alteration in the internal dynamics of RD provides the basis for allosteric regulation. Preliminary results of this work have been presented elsewhere (18Farkas L. Debreczeni J. Harmat V. Kohama K. Nakamura A. Nyitray L. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2001; 22: 591aGoogle Scholar). Protein Preparation—Physarum RD was prepared as described earlier (17Farkas L. Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Nakamura A. Kohama K. Nyitray L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27399-27405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, the three-chain complex (ELC, RLC, and myosin HC fragment Ile-771–Gly-841) was expressed from a pET15b vector-based recombinant DNA in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells and lysed under native condition by sonication. The cleared lysate was applied to a Ni2+-affinity column followed by anion-exchange chromatography on a MonoQ column. Purity of the protein solution was examined on 15% SDS-PAGE. In some samples, the N-terminal His tag was removed by thrombin cleavage before the ion-exchange chromatography. The RD was extensively dialyzed against solution A containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol and then concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml by centrifugation with a Centricon filter unit (cut-off: 30 kDa). Crystallization and Preparation of Heavy Atom Derivatives—Crystals were grown at 4 °C by vapor diffusion in hanging drops containing equal volume of protein in solution A and reservoir solution (20% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.5 m NaAc, pH 4.6, 0.1 m NH4Ac, 0.05 m NaCl). The crystals belong to the primitive orthorhombic space group P212121 and have unit cell dimensions a = 55.57 Å, b = 70.86 Å, c = 97.88 Å, with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. After unsuccessful attempts of molecular replacement, heavy atom derivatives were prepared by soaking the crystals in 5–20 mm solutions of samarium, europium, holmium, ytterbium, mercury, and lead salts. Europium, lead, and mercury caused the crystals to crack, and the other derivatives were found to be isomorphous. Data Collection and Structure Determination—Data sets were collected from single crystals at 100 K with a 165-mm-diameter MAR Research CCD detector at the ID 14-1 beamline at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. As a cryo-protectant, 30% polyethylene glycol 400 was used. Images were processed with Denzo and Scalepack (19Otwinowsky Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). ShelxD (20Sheldrick G.M. Hauptmann H.A. Weeks C.M. Miller M. Usón I. Arnold E. Rossmann M. Ab initio phasing. International Tables for Crystallography. F. 2001: 333-351Google Scholar) was employed to find the heavy atom positions based on anomalous signals. Since the heavy atom sites had the same position in the different derivatives, only the ytterbium derivative, which afforded the highest resolution and the strongest anomalous signal, was used in further steps. Heavy atom sites were refined, and the first electron density map was calculated with Sharp (21Fortelle E Bricogne de la G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar) from isomorphous data combined with anomalous scattering. Phases were improved using the programs Solomon and dm (22Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBN Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; (Number 31, pp., Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK): 34-38Google Scholar). Auto-building of the structure was tried with ArpWarp (24Perrakis A. Morris R.J. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar); subsequent runs built about 70% of the structure. For hand editing of the structure, the program XtalView (25McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar) was employed; refinement was carried out with Refmac (26Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). Data statistics are listed in Supplemental Table One. It is notable that identical models were obtained from crystals that were grown from RD either with or without removal of the N-terminal His tag from the HC fragment. Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange—The kinetics of hydrogen-deuterium exchange in D2O was measured by a Bruker IFS 28 Fourier-transformed infrared spectrophotometer. CaF2 cells with a path length of 110 μm were used both for the sample and for background measurements. Measurements were carried out at 30.0 ± 0.1 °C, controlled with a Techne TU 16D temperature controller. The samples were dialyzed in 0.05 m MES, pH 6.0, and 2 mm CaCl2 or in 2 mm EGTA, lyophilized above liquid nitrogen for 9 h, and then dissolved (1.5–2 mg of protein) in D2O. The IR spectra (400–4000 cm-1 region) were recorded starting 30–50 s after complete dissolution. Absorbances of the amide I and amide II bands were evaluated from the spectra at the wave numbers of their maxima, i.e. at 1650 and 1547.5 cm-1, respectively. The values were corrected with the baseline absorbances measured at 1789 cm-1. The fraction of unexchanged hydrogens (X) was calculated from the ratio of amide II and amide I absorbances, taking the values of the unexchanged proteins and the completely deuterated ones as 100 and 0%, respectively. The results were presented as relaxation spectra (27Závodszky P. Johansen J.T. Hvidt A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 56: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), i.e. plotting X versus log (k0t) as suggested by Závodszky et al. (28Závodszky P. Kardos J. Svingor A Petsko G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7406-7411Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), where k0 is the chemical exchange rate constant, which was calculated from the empirical expression, k0 = (10-pHread + 10pHread-6) 100.05(T-25) s-1. Molecular Dynamics Calculations—Physarum RD structure with two Ca2+ ions bound at the inhibitory and crystal packing binding sites, respectively, and the same structure without the Ca2+ ions were inputs of two separate MD calculations. The GROMACS (29Lindahl E. Hess B. van der Spoel D. J. Mol. Mod. 2001; 7: 306-317Crossref Google Scholar) program package was used for the whole MD procedure, i.e. the preparation of the simulation box, the addition of water molecules for the explicit water model, energy minimizations, position-restrained preconditioning, and the 10-ns-long unrestrained MD runs at temperature of 300 K. The GROMOS (30van Gunsteren W.F. Billeter S.R. Eising A.A. Hünenberger P.H. Krüger P. Mark A.E. Scott W.R.P. Tironi I.G.

Chem. 1997; 18: 1463-1472Crossref Scopus (11986) Google Scholar) algorithm for bond constraints were utilized. The total charge was neutralized by the addition of counter ions. The r.m.s. deviation of substructures of Physarum RD, number of H-bonds, and interaction energy between the light chains were calculated with standard GROMACS analysis tools for the whole 10-ns trajectories. The protein structure at T = 0 ns was used as a reference of r.m.s. fit before r.m.s. deviation calculations. Overall Description of the Structure—Fig. 1 shows the 1.8 Å resolution crystal structure of the Physarum myosin RD. It displays all the general features of the neck regions of a conventional myosin, as seen before in the crystal structures of scallop myosin RD and, in less detail, of chicken skeletal myosin subfragment 1 (33Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar). The RD complex has an elongated shape; the two light chains stabilize the long α-helical segment of the heavy chain. There is a pronounced hook region in the HC near the C-terminal end, where the N-lobe of RLC binds to it. The C-terminal lobes of both Physarum light chains are in the same semi-open conformation as in the scallop RD (10Houdusse A. Cohen C. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and also in an apo-CaM/two IQ complexes and the CaM-like Mlc1p/IQ complexes of class V myosin (15Houdusse A. Trybus K. Cohen C. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 158aGoogle Scholar, 16Terrak M. Wu G. Stafford W.F. Lu R.C. Dominguez R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The semi-open conformation provides strong binding of the LCs/CaMs to the first part of an IQ motif. The N-terminal lobe of ELC displays a closed conformation despite the fact that the first EF-hand, which has been shown to be the inhibitory Ca2+-binding site of Physarum myosin (17Farkas L. Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Nakamura A. Kohama K. Nyitray L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27399-27405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), contains a bound Ca2+ ion. This domain, like that of the scallop RD, binds to the second part of the first IQ motif with rather external surface contacts. There is only a slight bend in the HC helix, where it interacts with the N-lobe of ELC. The structure of both the N-terminal and the C-terminal lobes shows high similarity to the corresponding lobes of scallop RD, with r.m.s. deviations for backbone superimpositions of 0.81 and 1.18 Å, respectively. The two lobes of RLC when compared with the corresponding lobes of scallop myosin gave similar r.m.s. deviation values (1.53 and 1.14 Å). However, the above comparisons also highlight variability of the orientations that the two lobes can adopt on different myosins. For instance, the N- and C-lobes of RLC are in closer proximity in the Physarum RD; therefore, the interlobe interactions more extensively stabilize the sharp bending of the HC. The flexible nature of the interlobe linkers could also have functional implications as it was pointed out by comparing RDs of scallop myosin head crystal structures in different functional states (12Gourinath S. Himmel D.M. Brown J.H. Reshetnikova L. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of RLC, in good accordance with the scallop structure, forms an open structure and interacts strongly with hydrophobic residues of the “hook” region of the HC, although its first EF-hand cannot bind divalent cations (17Farkas L. Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Nakamura A. Kohama K. Nyitray L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27399-27405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, a second Ca2+ ion was located in the electron density, bound to the second EF-hand of RLC, which mediates crystal contacts. We will argue that this site has no biological importance and that its occupation by Ca2+ does not significantly affect our structural and functional interpretations. Inhibitory Ca2+-binding Site in the First EF-hand of ELC—The striking feature of the crystal structure is that the Ca2+-bound N-terminal lobe adopts a closed conformation, whereas in the case of other conventional EF-hand proteins, the lobe conformation is generally open when a divalent cation is bound. As shown in Fig. 2A, four amino acid residues and two water molecules are involved in the formation of an octahedral coordination geometry; Asp-15, Asp-17, Asp-19 are liganded to the Ca2+ ion by one of their carboxyl oxygens, and Lys-21 is coordinated by its carbonyl oxygen. All coordinating residues are homologous with the liganding residues in CaM, and they are also in the same conformation. However, in the Physarum ELC, in contrast to CaM, residues after the eight position of the Ca2+-binding loop cannot be involved in the coordination since the domain is in a closed conformation. The second (exiting) helix of this EF-hand displaced, and the residues after the ninth position are removed from the vicinity of the Ca2+ ion. To stabilize the binding of the ion, Glu-26 at the 12th position of the loop is substituted by a water molecule. The sixth ligand is a second water molecule, similarly to the canonical binding structure (34Babu Y.S. Sack J.S. Greenhough T.J. Bugg C.E. Means A.R. Cook W.J. Nature. 1985; 315: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 35Babu Y.S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). Since Glu-26 would act as a bidentate ligand but was replaced by a water molecule, the Ca2+ site has six ligands instead of the usual seven. The loop may accommodate cations of similar size due to the fact that one of the water molecules, completing the coordination sphere, is not supported by any residues directly; therefore, its position may be slightly adjusted to meet the need of the cation. This would account for the observed Mg2+ binding of this site (17Farkas L. Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Nakamura A. Kohama K. Nyitray L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27399-27405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The unusual closed state is stabilized, and the closed-to-open conformational transition is prevented by several factors. First of all, the second EF-hand, which cannot bind any cation, can stabilize the closed state of the whole N-terminal lobe through cooperative interactions. Stability of the closed state is also provided by the short antiparallel β-sheet segments at the end of the loops. Moreover, specific interactions between the HC and the first two helices of ELC fix the relative position of the N-terminal lobe adequately for a closed lobe conformation. The corresponding lobe of the scallop ELC is also in a closed state; however, it was argued that this Ca2+-binding site is in an EF-hand with non-canonical liganding residues, and the site is stabilized only by extensive interactions with RLC and the HC helix (10Houdusse A. Cohen C. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Comparison of the Ca2+-binding EF-hands of Physarum and scallop ELC (Fig. 2B) shows that the first helix of scallop ELC has an extra turn allowing the unique binding of Ca2+ in the closed state with additional stabilizing interactions with the RLC. EF-hand I of the Physarum structure lacks this extra helical turn and in fact has a fully canonical loop structure. Finally, lack of methionine residues in the N-lobe of Physarum ELC (and only one in scallop ELC) could also be a structural factor preventing the large conformational transition; it was suggested that methionine side chains may facilitate Ca2+-induced opening in EF-hands of the CaM superfamily (36Nelson M.R. Chazin W.J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 270-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the structure of the Ca2+-saturated N-lobe of Physarum ELC is very similar to the recently reported crystal structure of a mutant Ca2+-bound CaM locked in the closed conformation by a disulfide bond (Fig. 2B) (37Grabarek Z. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1351-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). r.m.s. deviations of the backbone carbons after superimposing EF-hand I and EF-hand II of the N-lobes are 0.53 and 0.80 Å, respectively. The author has reasoned that the structure represents the transition state of the Ca2+ switch (37Grabarek Z. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1351-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Apparently, the Ca2+-induced close-to-open transition in the N-lobe of ELC also has a high activation barrier imposed on the structure by the interactions described above, and the lobe conformation freezes in a sort of transition state of the close-to-open isomerization. N-terminal Lobe of RLC—The whole N-lobe of RLC adopts an open conformation, although EF-hand I does not bind a cation. As described above, the lobe conformation can be stabilized by various forces, such as HC-LC interactions and cooperative bonds between the two EF-hand regions, and not solely by the binding of a divalent cation. In the case of scallop myosin RLC, although the second loop cannot bind a metal ion, the presence of Mg2+ in the first loop, together with the binding of the HC target helix, results in the conformational transition to the open form of the whole domain. The open state is apparently the consequence of the binding mode of the domain to the hook region of the HC, which is similar to other amphipathic CaM target sites (38Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1251-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 39Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar) and does not necessarily require binding of divalent ions to its first EF-hand. This seems to be a general feature of RLCs in lower eukaryotes, which are unable to bind any divalent metals. The asymmetric unit of the crystal structure contains a second bound Ca2+ in the second EF-hand of the RLC, coordinated by seven oxygen atoms arranged similarly to other, canonical EF-hands. As shown in Fig. 3, five residues are involved in the binding: Asp-64, Asn-68, and Thr-66 by their side chain oxygens, Lys-70 by its carbonyl oxygen, and Glu-75 by both of its side chain oxygens as a bidentate ligand. The seventh ligand is provided by Glu-49 of a crystal symmetry-related ELC, instead of a water molecule as found in other EF-hand proteins. The rather uncommon way of Ca2+ coordination raises the question whether this Ca2+-binding site has any physiological function. No biochemical data exist that would indicate binding of Ca2+ or Mg2+ to Physarum myosin II in solution beyond the well characterized Ca2+-binding site of ELC (4Kohama K. Kendrick-Jones J. J.

Moreover, aside from the liganding residue from ELC, only a single H-bridge can be seen between the RLC and the symmetry-related ELC, which cannot be regarded as a specific bond between the two molecules. Therefore, we have suggested that the second Ca2+ mediates only packing interactions during crystallization and that this site is unlikely to contribute to the open state of the lobe. However, one cannot rule out that the actual lobe orientation and the angle at the HC hook are slightly affected by the unusual ligand-mediated crystal contact. Bends in the Heavy Chain Helix—The interface between the two LCs is not as extended as observed in the scallop RD. These interactions are not sufficient to position the two chains in a relatively fixed position like the numerous H-bonds and van der Waals contacts at the ELC-RLC interface in scallop RD, suggesting that the Ca2+ binding does not require an extensive cooperative interaction network. As a probable consequence of the fewer interchain linkages, the HC is bent only slightly (∼10°) between the two IQ motifs when compared with ∼40° in the scallop RD and the chicken skeletal S1 structures (Fig. 4). At a sharp bend of the HC (the hook at the RLC interlobe region), the angle is almost 135° in Physarum RD structure, whereas it is only ∼90° in the scallop and skeletal RD structures (Fig. 4). Moreover, the RD leans in the opposite directions in the Physarum RD. The beginning of the HC helix, the so-called pliant region at the motor domain/lever arm junction of the myosin head (12Gourinath S. Himmel D.M. Brown J.H. Reshetnikova L. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (87) Google Scholar), is straight in the Physarum RD structure as in the scallop S1 and not bent as in the smooth muscle crystal structure (40Dominguez R. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C. Cell. 1998; 94: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). The same salt bridge stabilizes the pliant region as in the scallop structure. The above facts indicate that the position of the myosin heads and the initial part of coiled-coil rod could be quite different in the myosin isoforms.

Oncogenic transformation sensitizes cells to E4orf4-induced cell death. To uncover additional components of the E4orf4 network required for induction of its unique mode of apoptosis, we used yeast genetics to select gene deletions conferring resistance to E4orf4. Deletion of YND1, encoding a yeast Golgi apyrase, conferred partial resistance to E4orf4. However, Ynd1p apyrase activity was not required for E4orf4-induced toxicity. Ynd1p and Cdc55p, the yeast protein phosphatase 2A-B subunit, contributed additively to E4orf4-induced toxicity. Furthermore, concomitant overexpression of one and deletion of the other was detrimental to yeast growth, demonstrating a functional interaction between the two proteins. YND1 and CDC55 also interacted genetically with CDC20 and CDH1/HCT1, encoding activating subunits of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome. In addition to their functional interaction, Ynd1p and Cdc55p interacted physically, and this interaction was disrupted by E4orf4, which remained associated with both proteins.

Induction of apoptosis by E4orf4 has been reported to be at least partially caspase-dependent in 293T cells, but it is caspase-independent in Chinese hamster ovary and H1299 cells, suggesting that non-classical apoptotic pathways are involved (7Lavoie J.N.

Virol. 2001; 75: 789-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In 293T cells, where E4orf4-induced apoptosis is caspase-dependent, components of the death receptor pathway contribute to the process (10Livne A. Shtrichman R. Kleinberger T. J.

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is composed usually of three subunits, a catalytic C subunit, a scaffolding A subunit, and one of several regulatory B subunits (Bα-δ/B55, B′α-ϵ/B56, B″(PR72, PR130, PR59, PR48)), encoded by unrelated gene families. The B subunits dictate the cellular localization and substrate specificity of the phosphatase (reviewed in Ref. 11Sontag E. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that E4orf4 interacts with PP2A through a direct association with the phosphatase Bα/B55 regulatory subunit (2Kleinberger T. Shenk T. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7556-7560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E4orf4 can also interact with PP2A molecules containing a different regulatory subunit, B′/B56 (12Shtrichman R. Sharf R. Kleinberger T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3757-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The interaction of E4orf4 with an active PP2A enzyme is required for induction of apoptosis (9Shtrichman R. Sharf R. Barr H. Dobner T. Kleinberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10080-10085Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 12Shtrichman R. Sharf R. Kleinberger T.

Virol. 2000; 74: 7869-7877Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar); however, only PP2A holoenzymes containing the Bα/B55 subunit mediate this process (12Shtrichman R. Sharf R. Kleinberger T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3757-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). E4orf4 also associates with members of the Src kinase family, leading to its Tyr phosphorylation and to deregulation of Src signaling. E4orf4 Tyr phosphorylation is correlated with a shift of E4orf4 accumulation from the nucleus to the cytoskeleton and to cell membranes and enhances E4orf4-induced apoptosis (14Lavoie J.N. Champagne C. Gingras M Robert C.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1037-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 15Gingras M.C. Champagne C. Roy M. Lavoie J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To further dissect the E4orf4 apoptotic pathway, a genetic system was applied, using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although some components of the metazoan core machinery of cell death, such as Bcl-2 family members, are absent in yeast, it has been previously shown that this organism could serve as a powerful tool for apoptosis research (16Matsuyama S. Nouraini S. Reed J.C. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 618-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Since Src kinase family members and death receptor pathway components, known to play a part in E4orf4-induced apoptosis in mammalian cells, are absent in yeast, the yeast system was not expected to reveal the full spectrum of E4orf4-induced events in mammalian cells. However, E4orf4-induced apoptosis can occur in the absence of these effectors (10Livne A. Shtrichman R. Kleinberger T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 789-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 17Robert A. Miron M.J. Champagne C. Gingras M.C. Branton P.E. Lavoie J.N. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and yeast and mammalian PP2A subunits share an extensive homology. Thus, the yeast system could reveal components of the apoptotic pathway regulated by the E4orf4-PP2A complex. When expressed in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, E4orf4 induces PP2A-dependent irreversible growth arrest (18Kornitzer D. Sharf R. Kleinberger T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 331-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 19Roopchand D.E. Lee J.M. Shahinian S. Paquette D. Bussey H. Branton P.E. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5279-5290Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Cdc55p, the yeast homologue of the PP2A-Bα/B55 subunit, is required for growth inhibition by E4orf4, whereas Rts1p, the yeast B′/B56 homologue, is dispensable for E4orf4-induced toxicity. To further demonstrate the relevance of the yeast system to E4orf4-induced apoptosis in mammalian cells, E4orf4 was randomly mutagenized in vitro by a chemical mutagen, and non-toxic E4orf4 mutants were selected in yeast (20Afifi R. Sharf R. Shtrichman R. Kleinberger T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4444-4447Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These mutants were shown to be non-apoptotic in mammalian cells and demonstrated a reduced ability to associate with an active PP2A. These results underscore the high conservation of E4orf4 targets between yeast and mammalian cells. Using yeast, we demonstrated that E4orf4 functionally interacted with components of the yeast cell-cycle machinery. Thus, E4orf4 enhanced Cdc28 activity in an Mih1-dependent manner and inhibited the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). Furthermore, E4orf4 physically associated with APC/C and targeted PP2A to this complex. E4orf4 was also shown to interact genetically with CDC20 and CDH1/HCT1, encoding two substrate-specific APC/C-activating subunits. The end result of the interactions of E4orf4 with the cell cycle machinery was the induction of mitotic arrest (18Kornitzer D. Sharf R. Kleinberger T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 331-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We further showed that E4orf4 could cause G2/M arrest in mammalian cells as well, prior to induction of apoptosis (18Kornitzer D. Sharf R. Kleinberger T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 331-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These results indicated that S. cerevisiae could be used as a tool to identify E4orf4 effectors, which are relevant to E4orf4-induced events in mammalian cells. Nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases, also known as NTPDases, apyrases, or E-ATPases, hydrolyze a variety of nucleoside 5′-triphosphates and 5′-diphosphates with different nucleotide preferences. Most of the members of this family are integral membrane glycoproteins, and their catalytic sites face the extracellular medium or the lumen of intracellular organelles. Golgi- and endoplasmic reticulum-NTPDases may be important in hydrolysis of nucleotide diphosphates to the corresponding nucleoside monophosphates and consequently in the import of nucleotide sugars from the cytosol into the Golgi or the endoplasmic reticulum. They may thus have an impact on protein glycosylation. Members of the NTPDase family share five highly conserved sequence domains, called apyrase conserved domains. Several residues involved in apyrase catalytic activity are found in the apyrase conserved domains (reviewed in Ref. 21Zimmermann H. Drug Dev. Res. 2001; 52: 44-56Crossref Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In this study, we undertook a classical genetics approach designed to identify yeast genes that are required for E4orf4-mediated toxicity in S. cerevisiae. The genetic analysis revealed that Ynd1p, a Golgi NTPDase, functionally interacted with Cdc55p to mediate E4orf4-induced toxicity. Biochemical studies demonstrated that Ynd1p associated with Cdc55p, and this interaction was disrupted in the presence of E4orf4, which remained associated with both proteins. However, Ynd1p enzymatic activity was not required for E4orf4-induced toxicity. Furthermore, NTPDase-4 (Lalp70/UDPase), a human Ynd1p homologue, associated with E4orf4 in mammalian cells, indicating its involvement in E4orf4-induced events. Plasmids, Yeast Strains, Mammalian Cell Lines, and Media—Yeast were grown either in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, 0.015% l-tryptophan, 2% glucose) or in synthetic complete medium (22Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. 1986; (pp. , Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 163-167Google Scholar). For induction with galactose, cells were grown in synthetic medium with 2% raffinose overnight. They were then diluted to A600 0.3 and allowed to grow another 2 h before the addition of galactose to 2%. Alternatively, cells were grown in 2% glucose to mid-log phase, washed once, and resuspended in 2% galactose. All yeast strains used in this study are listed in TABLE ONE, along with their sources. All the strains are isogenic with wild type (WT) strain W303. The mammalian cells utilized in this study were 293 cells (23Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russel W.C. Nairn R. J. Gen.

To generate the YND1 mutants E152Q and S189A, the pGZ148 plasmid was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange XL kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Generation of Mutant Yeast Collections—Yeast strain W303, containing p414 GALL-E4orf4, was mutagenized with the transposon insertion library mTn-lacZ/LEU2 (29Burns N. Grimwade B. Ross-Macdonald P.B. Choi E Finberg Y. Roeder K. Snyder G.S.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1087-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), as described in detail by the Yale Genome Analysis Center. Briefly, yeast cells were transformed with NotI-digested library DNA, using the LioAc method. After transformation, the cells were grown for 3 h in YPD medium, washed once in H2O, and then plated on galactose medium for selection of E4orf4-resistant yeast clones. Surviving colonies were picked, and E4orf4 levels were assessed by Western blot analysis. Yeast clones expressing WT levels of E4orf4 were mated with the parent W303 strain, and the resulting diploid cells were subjected to tetrad analysis to find those displaying Mendelian segregation of resistance to E4orf4. Identification of Transposon-disrupted Genes—To determine the site of transposon insertion, genomic DNA immediately adjacent to the transposon was rescued in Escherichia coli, using a plasmid marked with URA3 (pRSQ2-URA3) to replace part of the transposon by recombination of lacZ sequences (29Burns N. Grimwade B. Ross-Macdonald P.B. Choi E Finberg Y. Roeder K. Snyder G.S.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1087-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Yeast DNA was digested with EcoRI and circularized. Resulting plasmids containing a bacterial origin of replication, the β-lactamase gene and a portion of the lacZ gene with adjacent yeast DNA, were recovered in bacteria. Plasmids were sequenced using a primer complementary to the 5′ end of the transposon. A detailed description of the process can be found at the Yale Genome Analysis Center. Knock-out of YND1—A ynd1Δ strain in which the YND1 orf was replaced by a kanamycin cassette was obtained from G. Guidotti (CTY182-8: Mat a, ura3-52, Δhis3, lys2, ynd1::KanR). To create a ynd1Δ strain with the W303 genetic background, the kanamycin cassette replacing the YND1 orf, flanked by 500 bp on each side, was PCR-amplified from CTY182-8, using the 5′-oligonucleotide GTGAACGGACAAATTCTA and the 3′-oligonucleotide CGTTGTTGTTTGGCAAGC. The DNA product was transformed into W303 yeast cells, and homologous recombination to the YND1 locus was verified by PCR. Immunoblot Analysis and Co-immunoprecipitations of yeast and mammalian proteins—For immunoblots and co-immunoprecipitations, yeast extracts were prepared by bead-beating cells for 4 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer (250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 100 μm sodium vanadate, 100 nm okadaic acid (Calbiochem), 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1:250 Sigma protease inhibitor mixture for use in yeast extracts, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma)). The lysates were spun to separate beads and debris from the clear lysate. The beads were washed twice more in the lysis buffer, and immunoprecipitations were carried out in the same lysis buffer. Mammalian cell extracts were prepared as described previously (9Shtrichman R. Sharf R. Barr H. Dobner T. Kleinberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10080-10085Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), using a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1× protease inhibitors mixture (Sigma), 10 mm NaF, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.25 mm sodium vanadate, 5 nm okadaic acid. Antibodies to E4orf4 were covalently coupled to protein-Sepharose beads (9Shtrichman R. Sharf R. Barr H. Dobner T. Kleinberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10080-10085Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Lysates, antibodies, and protein A beads were rotated for 3 h at 4 °Cand then washed three times in lysis buffer. For detection of Lalp70/UDPase, cell extracts were chromatographed on SDS-PAGE after incubation at 37 °C for 5 min, without boiling. Antibodies used in this work were: anti-HA (Covance, Berkeley, CA), anti-E4orf4 (6Shtrichman R. Kleinberger T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2975-2982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), anti-Cdc55p (30Koren R.

NTPDase Activity Assays—NTPDase enzymatic assays were performed using crude membrane preparations, as described by Zhong and Guidotti (26Zhong X. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32704-32711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Image Acquisition and Processing—Yeast colonies were photographed with the Bio-Rad ChemiDoc™ documentation apparatus or with a B.I.S. Bio Imaging System (model 202D). Gels were scanned using a UMAX ASTRA 3450 scanner. Images were processed using Adobe PhotoShop 5.0 or 7.0. Generation of a Mutant Yeast Strain That Is Partially Resistant to E4orf4 and Identification of the Mutated Gene Involved—Yeast strain W303 containing p414 GALL-E4orf4, a URA3-marked, high copy episomal plasmid expressing E4orf4 from a galactose-inducible promoter, was transformed with a LEU2-marked, transposon-mutagenized yeast DNA library. Transformants were plated on leucine- and uracil-deficient semisolid medium containing galactose. An aliquot of the transformants was plated on medium containing glucose to estimate the number of transformants obtained. Out of 121,000 transformants, 61 colonies grew on galactose. To exclude clones that might have survived due to loss of E4orf4 expression, Western blot analysis was performed on the viable colonies. Only five colonies expressed WT levels of E4orf4 upon induction on galactose. Following removal of the E4orf4-expressing plasmid from the resistant colonies by selection on 5-fluoroorotic acid, the colonies were mated with WT W303 cells, yielding five diploids. Tetrad analysis revealed that only one mutant exhibited a 2:2 Mendelian segregation of the E4orf4-resistant phenotype in a manner consistent with a single gene defect. The gene whose disruption conferred partial resistance to E4orf4 was identified by plasmid rescue of genomic yeast sequences lying adjacent to the transposon as YND1 (YER005w), encoding a yeast Golgi apyrase (26Zhong X. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32704-32711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 31Gao X.D. Kaigorodov V. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21450-21456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Deletion of YND1 resulted in partial resistance of the yeast cells to E4orf4 (Fig. 1A), whereas it did not alter expression of the E4orf4 protein (see Fig. 3B). Introduction of a WT YND1 gene into ynd1Δ cells reinstated E4orf4-induced toxicity (Fig. 1B). YND1 is specifically required for E4orf4-induced toxicity since its deletion did not alter toxicity induced by overexpression of Candida Albicans GCN4 (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that YND1 is a novel component of the E4orf4 toxic pathway in yeast.FIGURE 3Overexpression of Cdc55p in a ynd1Δ genetic background causes supersensitivity of the cells to E4orf4-induced toxicity. A,WTand ynd1Δ mutant cells were transformed with combinations of pDAD-E4orf4 (a weak expressor of E4orf4) and pADH-CDC55, as noted in the figure. Serial 5-fold dilutions of the various yeast samples were plated on -URA-LEU glucose or galactose plates and grown for 3 days at 30 °C. B, proteins were prepared from an aliquot of the cells in A and were subjected to Western blot analysis with E4orf4- and Tpd3p-specific antibodies. Tpd3p served as a loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Ynd1p and Cdc55p Contribute to Separate E4orf4-induced Pathways, Which Interact Functionally—Since both Ynd1p and a PP2A heterotrimer containing the Cdc55p regulatory subunit contribute to E4orf4-induced growth arrest in yeast cells, we further investigated whether they were part of one or more E4orf4-induced pathways. A double mutant strain cdc55Δynd1Δ was generated, and galactose-induced E4orf4 toxicity was compared in WT cells, in the single mutant strains, cdc55Δ and ynd1Δ, and in the double mutant (Fig. 2, A and B). The cdc55Δ cells grew less well than the other strains on galactose and produced smaller colonies. The colonies were slightly smaller when E4orf4 was expressed in the cdc55Δ cells, indicating that these cells were not fully resistant to E4orf4, as reported previously (19Roopchand D.E. Lee J.M. Shahinian S. Paquette D. Bussey H. Branton P.E. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5279-5290Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The ynd1Δ cells were also partially resistant to E4orf4, generating smaller colonies in its presence. However, as demonstrated before, they were more resistant to E4orf4 than WT cells. The double mutant appeared to be fully resistant to E4orf4 while still expressing WT E4orf4 protein levels (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that Cdc55p and Ynd1p have additive effects on E4orf4-induced events. We have previously reported that overexpression of Cdc55p facilitates hypertoxicity of E4orf4 (18Kornitzer D. Sharf R. Kleinberger T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 331-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To test whether Ynd1p was required for PP2A-mediated toxicity of E4orf4, Cdc55p was overexpressed in WT cells or in a Ynd1Δ genetic background, and its effect on E4orf4 toxicity was tested. For these experiments, E4orf4 was expressed from a weak GAL promoter and induced very little growth arrest by itself, and Cdc55p was expressed from a constitutive ADH promoter. As demonstrated in Fig. 3A, the presence of YND1 was not required for Cdc55p-mediated hypersensitization of yeast cells to E4orf4. Moreover, the ynd1Δ strain appeared to be supersensitive to the combination of E4orf4 and overexpressed Cdc55p when compared with the WT yeast strain. In addition, ynd1Δ cells overexpressing Cdc55p grew slower than WT cells overexpressing this protein (Fig. 3A, compare colony sizes on glucose plates). The difference in sensitivity to E4orf4 did not result from altered levels of E4orf4, as seen in Fig. 3B. Thus, Ynd1p is not a downstream target of the E4orf4-PP2A complex; however, it may functionally interact with Cdc55p. To further test for a functional interaction between Cdc55p and Ynd1p, WT, cdc55Δ and cdc55Δynd1Δ cells were transformed with a plasmid expressing Ynd1p-HA from a glycerol dehydrogenase promoter. As seen in Fig. 4, although WT and cdc55Δynd1Δ cells were efficiently transformed with the pGDH-YND1-HA plasmid, no transformants were obtained in the cdc55Δ cells, suggesting that increased Ynd1p expression is lethal in this background. Furthermore, YND1-HA overexpression slowed down the growth of WT cells, and to a lesser extent, that of cdc55Δynd1Δ cells (Fig. 4). These results suggest that too much Ynd1p is detrimental to cell growth even in the presence of Cdc55p and that synthetic lethality in the cdc55Δ background occurs only when Ynd1p levels increase above a certain threshold. To further examine the functional interaction between YND1 and CDC55, we tested whether deletion of YND1 suppressed phenotypes associated with inactivation of CDC55. cdc55 mutants demonstrate defective spindle checkpoint activity (32Minshull J.

Biol. 1997; 17: 620-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), which could result from a diminished ability to promote dephosphorylation of Cdc28p (32Minshull J. Straight A. Rudner A.D. Dernburg A.F. Belmont A. Murray A.W. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1609-1620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and from enhanced derepression of APC/C activity in the mutant cells, leading to a less effective inactivation of the APC/C by the spindle checkpoint pathway (18Kornitzer D. Sharf R. Kleinberger T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 331-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, Cdc55p antagonizes the Tor signaling pathway, and cdc55Δ mutants exhibit rapamycin resistance (34Jiang Y. Broach J.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2782-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we tested whether deletion of YND1 suppressed these two phenotypes. To test whether the double mutant cdc55Δynd1Δ lost the checkpoint defect caused by loss of CDC55, we examined the benomyl sensitivity of this strain. Strains defective in the spindle checkpoint pathway are more sensitive to low levels of benomyl, a microtubuledepolymerizing agent, probably due to an increased proportion of cells that"

Using x-ray crystallography, we have characterized the three-dimensional structure of the anti-id mAb MK2-23 Fab′ and shown that its heavy chain complementarity-determining region (CDR3) (H3) and its light chain CDR1 (L1) are closely associated. These moieties are the source of HMW-MAA mimicry, since they display partial amino acid sequence homology along with a similar structural fold with the HMW-MAA core protein. Furthermore, a 15-residue peptide comprising the H3 loop of anti-id mAb MK2-23 demonstrates HMW-MAA-like in vitro and in vivo reactivity.

Antigen mimicry has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several pathophysiological conditions such as viral immune evasion (1Wucherpfennig K.W. Strominger J.L.

In these situations, the structurally similar foreign moieties either interfere with the normal biological functions mediated by their nominal counterparts or elicit unwanted immune responses against the host antigens. The consequences sometimes can be quite detrimental. Nevertheless, in the case of autoimmune responses mediated by molecular mimicry, an intriguing finding is the restriction of the damage to an organ or a tissue. This pattern is distinct from the general immune hyper-responsiveness caused by suppression of the regulatory arm of the immune system, such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) blockade (8Chikuma S. Bluestone J.A. Immunol. Res. 2003; 28: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 9von Boehmer H. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). The potential ability of molecular mimicry to target a specific host antigen has provided the rationale for its use to elicit and/or enhance an immune response against human tumor antigens that are mostly non-mutated self-antigens and therefore poorly or non-immunogenic in patients (for review, see Refs. 10Wang X. Luo W. Foon K.A. Ferrone S. Cancer Chemother. Biol. Response Modif. 2001; 19: 309-326PubMed Google Scholar and 11Luo W. Hsu J.C. Kieber-Emmons T. Wang X. Ferrone S. Cancer Chemother. Biol.

Response Modif. 2005; 22: 769-787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-id mAb markedly differ in their immunogenicity as measured by their ability to elicit a humoral immune response to the corresponding self-tumor antigen. The cause of this variability is not known. The lack of this information reflects, at least in part, the limited knowledge about the structural basis of antigen mimicry by anti-id antibodies and about the relationship between the extent of antigen mimicry and ability of a mimic to overcome unresponsiveness to a self-tumor antigen. Since this knowledge may improve the design of tumor vaccines, in the present study we have investigated the structural basis of human high molecular weight-melanoma associated antigen (HMW-MAA) (12Campoli M.R. Chang C.C. Kageshita T. Wang X. McCarthy J.B. Ferrone S. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 24: 267-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) mimicry by the mouse anti-id mAb MK2-23 (13Kusama M. Kageshita T. Chen Z.J. Ferrone S. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 3844-3852PubMed Google Scholar). The latter anti-id mAb was derived from a mouse immunized with the HMW-MAA-specific idiotypic mAb 763.74 (13Kusama M. Kageshita T. Chen Z.J. Ferrone S. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 3844-3852PubMed Google Scholar). This antigen system was selected for our studies, since anti-id mAb MK2-23 has been found to elicit HMW-MAA-specific antibodies in mice and rabbits (14Chen Z.J. Yang H. Ferrone S. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1082-1090PubMed Google Scholar, 15Chen Z.J. Yang H. Liu C.C. Hirai S. Ferrone S. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 112-119PubMed Google Scholar), both of which express orthologs of human HMW-MAA constitutively (16Schlingemann R.O. Rietveld F.J. de Waal R.M. Ferrone S. Ruiter D.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 136: 1393-1405PubMed Google Scholar, 17Diers-Fenger M. Kirchhoff F. Kettenmann H. Levine J.M. Trotter J. Glia. 2001; 34: 213-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In addition, anti-id mAb MK2-23 was able to induce HMW-MAA-specific humoral responses in patients with melanoma (18Mittelman A. Chen Z.J. Yang H. Wong G.Y. Ferrone S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This immune response appears to be clinically relevant, since it was associated with regression of metastases in a few patients (20Mittelman A. Chen Z.J. Liu C.C. Hirai S. Ferrone S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 415-421PubMed Google Scholar) and with a statistically significant survival prolongation (18Mittelman A. Chen Z.J. Yang H. Wong G.Y. Ferrone S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The elicited HMW-MAA-specific antibodies, or anti-anti-id antibodies, were also found to inhibit the binding of mAb 763.74 (21Giacomini P. Ng A.K. Kantor R.R.S. Natali P.G. Ferrone S. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 3586-3590PubMed Google Scholar) to HMW-MAA in vitro (14Chen Z.J. Yang H. Ferrone S. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1082-1090PubMed Google Scholar, 15Chen Z.J. Yang H. Liu C.C. Hirai S.

Using x-ray crystallography and immunological studies, we have found that the complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) of the anti-id mAb MK2-23 heavy chain plays an important role in the three-dimensional structural basis of HMW-MAA mimicry by anti-id mAb MK2-23. Purification of Anti-id mAb MK2-23 F(ab′)2 Fragments—F(ab′)2 fragments were generated by digesting with immobilized pepsin (Pierce) mouse mAb IgG1 MK2-23 (14Chen Z.J. Yang H. Ferrone S. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1082-1090PubMed Google Scholar), which was purified from ascites by protein A chromatography (Bio-Rad). High purity mAb MK2-23 F(ab′)2 fragments were obtained by sequential protein A column and S-200 gel filtration chromatography. Peak S-200 fractions were pooled and concentrated to 7.9-10 mg/ml in low salt phosphate buffer (50 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). Purified F(ab′)2 fragment preparations were preincubated at room temperature with 5 mm dithiothreitol at pH 5.5 for 1.5 h, yielding monomeric Fab′ fragments. Crystallization and Data Collection—Diffraction-quality crystals were obtained from 20% polyethylene glycol 6000, in 0.1 m HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, at a protein concentration of 7.9 mg/ml. Protein and precipitant solutions were mixed at the 3:2 ratio, and droplets were allowed to vapor diffuse against wells of precipitant solutions in hanging droplets. Fab′ fragments were crystallized in the orthorhombic space group P212121 having unit-cell dimensions a = 75.05 Å, b = 76.89 Å, c = 82.18 Å, α = β = γ = 90° and one Fab′ molecule in the asymmetric unit. Diffraction data to 2.50 Å resolution were collected with a crystal flash frozen in liquid nitrogen on a R-AXIS IV area detector equipped with a rotating anode x-ray source (93,266 measured intensities, 17,003 unique reflections, 99.9% complete, intensity/σ (intensity) = 4.2 in the highest resolution shell, Rmerge = 0.067). Structure Solution and Refinement of the Model of Anti-id mAb MK2-23 Fab′ Fragments—The three-dimensional structure of the mAb MK2-23 Fab′ fragments was determined by the molecular replacement method using a known Fab structure (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 2RCS) as the search model and XPLOR routines (22Brünger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. 1992; (Yale University Press, New Haven, CT)Google Scholar). The experimentally determined sequences for the variable domains were built into the electron density, and the model was subjected to several rounds of refinement and rebuilding using the CNS package of software (23Brünger A.T.

Kageshita T. Perosa F. Ono R. Okada H. Ferrone S. Hybridoma. 1989; 8: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The purity and activity of mAb preparations were assessed by SDS-PAGE and by testing with the corresponding antigen in a binding assay, respectively. Biotinylation was performed using NHS-LC-biotin (succinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate) (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Assessment of Peptide PMK2-23H3 Antigenicity—Synthetic peptides derived from anti-id mAb MK2-23CDR3H (PMK2-23H3, ARSNYV-GYHVRWYFD), anti-id mAb MK2-23CDR1L (PMK2-23L1, SVEYYGSSLMQ), and HMW-MAA (PHMW-MAA.D2.7, IRSG-DEVHYHVTAGPRW) were purchased from N. C. Wang, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. A synthetic peptide derived from β2-microglobulin (Pb2m, KNGERIEKVEHS), used as a negative control, was purchased from University of Georgia Molecular Genetics Instrumentation Facility (Athens, GA). Escalating concentrations of peptides as indicated were incubated with biotinylated mAb 763.74 (0.5 mg/ml) at 4 °C overnight in U-bottom 96-well plates. The mixture was then incubated with HMW-MAA-bearing melanoma cells Colo38 (105/well) for 1 h at 4 °C. After three washes with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, an optimal amount of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin was added. Reactions were then developed and visualized with the 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate system (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Reactions were reported as OD measured with an ELISA reader. Percent inhibition was calculated by the formula: 100% × (ODirrelevant peptide - ODtest peptide)/ODirrelevant peptide. Dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated as the molar concentration of the peptide required to cause a 50% inhibition of binding of biotinylated mAb 763.74 to HMW-MAA-bearing melanoma cells Colo38 (25Temponi M. Gold A.M. Ferrone S. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 2497-2503PubMed Google Scholar). Assessment of Peptide PMK2-23H3 Immunogenicity—Peptide PMK2-23H3 conjugated to the carrier protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin with the cross-linking agent m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Pierce) was mixed with complete Freund adjuvant for priming (100 μg/injection) and with incomplete Freund adjuvant for boosting (50 μg/injection). Immunizations were given subcutaneously to 8-week-old female BALB/c mice (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) (five per group) on days 0, 21, and 42. Sera were harvested before immunization and on days 7 and 28. They were tested for reactivity with the immunizing peptide coated on 96-well plates (24Temponi M. Kageshita T. Perosa F. Ono R. Okada H. Ferrone S. Hybridoma. 1989; 8: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and with HMW-MAA-bearing melanoma cells in ELISA and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, as described previously (14Chen Z.J. Yang H. Ferrone S. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1082-1090PubMed Google Scholar, 26Luo W. Hsu J.C. Tsao C.Y. Ko E. Wang X. Ferrone S. J.

Amino Acid (aa) Sequence Homology and Structural Similarity of Anti-id mAb MK2-23 CDRs with HMW-MAA Core Protein—To investigate whether aa sequence homology plays a role in the HMW-MAA mimicry by anti-id mAb MK2-23, we compared the aa sequence of the anti-id mAb MK2-23 CDRs with that of the HMW-MAA core protein (27Pluschke G. Vanek M. Evans A. Dittmar T. Schmid P. Itin P. Filardo E.J. Reisfeld R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9710-9715Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), since CDRs constitute the idiotope of an antibody. Only a partial homology was found between the CDR3H (H3) and the HMW-MAA core protein (Fig. 1 and data not shown). This region corresponds to residues 94-102 within anti-id mAb MK2-23 H3, displaying eight identical, although discontinuous, and one conservative matches with the region spanning from residues 1159 to 1174 in the HMW-MAA core protein. In addition, the region corresponding to residues 29-33 within anti-id mAb MK2-23 L1 shows four identical and one conservative matches with residues 1132-1136 of the HMW-MAA core protein (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the two homologous regions map, with only 21 aa apart, to the seventh of the 15 putative chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) repeat units of the domain 2 of HMW-MAA (designated HMW-MAA.D2.7, residues 1128-1216) (Fig. 1) (28Staub E. Hinzmann B. Rosenthal A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The HMW-MAA.D2.7 segment is predicted to adopt an all-β-fold conformation, comprising eight β-strands (28Staub E. Hinzmann B. Rosenthal A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This prediction is supported by the alignment of the putative HMW-MAA.D2.7 β-strands to the six β-strands of a N-cadherin fragment with a known three-dimensional structure (PDB code 1NCJ). Interestingly, the two HMW-MAA.D2.7 regions (residues 1132-1135 and residues 1159-1174), with which anti-id mAb MK2-23 L1 and H3 have homology, are located within the predicted first and fourth β-strands, respectively, in the HMW-MAA segment (Fig. 1) (28Staub E. Hinzmann B. Rosenthal A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that the anti-id mAb MK2-23 L1 and H3 loops represent the moiety that mimics the HMW-MAA epitope. Overall Three-dimensional Structure of Anti-id mAb MK2-23 Fab′ Fragments—To determine whether anti-id mAb MK2-23 L1 and H3 loops display a structural fold similar to that of the HMW-MAA.D2.7 segment, we crystallized and solved the structure of the anti-id mAb MK2-23 Fab′ fragments. The overall structure of anti-id mAb MK2-23 Fab′ fragment exhibits the typical immunoglobulin fold with 377 of 379 non-Gly and non-Pro residues in the allowed regions (Fig. 2A and TABLE ONE). The two residues that are in the disallowed region are Ala51 of the L chain and Ser172 of the H chain, both of which are located on turns with well defined electron densities. Our experimental electron densities agree well with the deduced aa sequences of anti-id mAb MK2-23 Fab′ L and H chains, except for the following discrepancies. An Ala side chain was better accommodated than an Arg at residue 71 of the H chain. A few solvent-exposed side chains, such as Tyr100 and Arg100C of the H chain (on the H3 loop), did not show appreciable electron densities. It is likely that these side chains participate in antigen recognition and are dynamically disordered in absence of an antigen. Secondary and Tertiary Conformations of Anti-id mAb MK2-23 L1 and H3—Next we examined the structural features of L1 and H3 loops of the anti-id mAb MK2-23. L1 consists of residues Arg24, Ala25, Ser26, Glu27, Ser27A, Val27B, Glu27C, Tyr27D, Tyr28, Gly29, Ser30, Ser31, Leu32, Met33, and Gln34 (29Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. 1991; (5th Ed., Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Washington, D. C.)Google Scholar). According to current classifications (30Al-Lazikani B. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 927-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), anti-id mAb MK2-23 L1 belongs to the Vk L1 canonical structure 5, containing four insertions. An interesting feature of this L1 loop is the formation of a pair of anti-parallel strands linked by three inter-strand hydrogen bonds (27BCO-HN32, 27DNH-OC30, and 27DCO-HN30) and a left-handed hairpin turn having Tyr28 and Gly29 backbones in the (+,+) helical conformational space of the Ramachandran plot. Whether the latter geometry is a common feature among all canonical structure 5 L1 loops or a unique characteristic of anti-id mAb MK2-23 L1 remains to be determined, since the three-dimensional structure of at least another canonical structure 5 L1 loop is not yet available at the time of preparation of this manuscript (30Al-Lazikani B. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 927-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Of note here is that the average temperature factor for L1 is about 45 Å2, which is significantly higher than the average temperature factor of the entire molecule (36 Å2). The H3 loop, consisting of residues Ser95, Asn96, Tyr97, Val98, Gly99, Tyr100, His100A, Val100B, Arg100C, Trp100D, Tyr100E, Phe100F, Asp101, and Val102, contains six insertions (29Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. 1991; (5th Ed., Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Washington, D. C.)Google Scholar). H3 is relatively longer than that of other mouse immunoglobulins; it is only shorter than that of mAb R19.9 (PDB code 1FAI) and mAb R45-45-11 (PDB code 1IKF) by 1 and 3 residues, respectively. In accordance with the structural patterns of the immunoglobulin H3 loop torso region (31Morea V. Tramontano A. Rustici M. Chothia C. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 269-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), anti-id mAb MK2-23 H3 belongs to a class in which the torso region does not contain a β-bulge, which is the most common class, but a regular β-sheet hairpin structure (31Morea V. Tramontano A. Rustici M. Chothia C. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 269-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The salt bridge between Arg94 and Asp101 is absent, but like in most immunoglobulins, the combination of the length and sequence of the loop between Arg94 and Asp101 dictates to a large extent the specificity. The anti-parallel strands at the loop termini are held by hydrogen bonding (95CO-HN101, 96NH—OC100E, 96CO-HN100E, and 98NH-OC100C). At the tip of the loop, residues Tyr100 to Arg100C form a distorted type III helical turn with a 100CO-HN100C hydrogen bond. Similar to L1, H3 also displays high thermal motion (average B ∼60 Å2); however, the main chain and most of the side chain electron densities, except those of Tyr97 and Arg100C, are well defined to allow an unequivocal tracing of the backbone. It is noteworthy that the L1 and H3 loops pack closely against each other through hydrophobic interactions (L1 Leu32 side chain against the H3 main chain, Val106 and Tyr27D side chains) and through the formation of one hydrogen bond (L1 Gln34 to H3 Trp100D CO). Comparison of L1 and H3 Loops of Anti-id mAb MK2-23 with Those of Other Anti-id mAb—To examine the structural variation of the anti-id mAb MK2-23 L1 and H3 loops as compared with other anti-id antibodies, we aligned the three-dimensional structure of these two loops with those of the four anti-id mAb structures available thus far: 409.5.3 (PDB code 1AIF), 6A6 (PDB code 1PG7), E225 (PDB code 1CIC), and E5.2 (PDB code 1DVF). Two anti-anti-id mAb, 131 (PDB code 2CK0) and GH1002 (PDB code 1GHF), and two idiotypic mAb, Mopc21 (PDB code 1IGC) and R24 (PDB code 1R24), were used for comparison. Using least squares fitting, the loop termini, which correspond to the conserved residues 23 and 37 of the L chain and 91 and 106 of the H chain, superimpose well with root mean square deviations (r.m.s.d.) between 0.2 and 1 Å (Fig. 3). Between the termini, the loops, and especially H3, adopt varying conformations with the largest r.m.s.d. around 6.5 Å. The H3 loop of anti-id mAb MK2-23 is long and forms a pair of anti-parallel β-strands linked by four hydrogen bonds (Figs. 2B and 3). Together with the L1 loop, the H3 loop of anti-id mAb MK2-23 projects a 41-residue-long surface, which is the most protruded among all the anti-id antibodies with a known three-dimensional structure. Similarity in the in Vitro Reactivity of the Anti-id mAb MK2-23-derived Peptide PMK2-23H3 and of the HMW-MAA.D2.7-derived Peptide PHMW.D2.7—The peptide ARSNYVGYHVRWYFD (designated as PMK2-23H3), which was derived from the H3 loop of anti-id mAb MK2-23 encompassing the described HMW-MAA-homologous aa sequence, was synthesized and analyzed for reactivity with the HMW-MAA-specific idiotypic mAb 763.74. As shown in Fig. 4, peptide PMK2-23H3 inhibits the binding of mAb 763.74 to HMW-MAA-bearing melanoma cells to a similar extent as the HMW-MAA.D2.7-derived peptide (IRSGDEVHYHVTAGPRW, designated as PHMW.D2.7). The inhibition is specific, since the irrelevant peptide Pb2m had no detectable effect on the binding of mAb 763.74 to melanoma cells. The Kd values for peptides PMK2-23H3 and PHMW.D.2.7 are 871 and 900 nm, respectively. The peptide SVEYYGSSLMQ (designated as PMK2-23L1), which was derived from the L1 loop of anti-id mAb MK2-23 encompassing the described HMW-MAA-homologous aa sequence, was also synthesized. Because of its low solubility, peptide PMK2-23L1 could not be used alone or in combination with peptide PMK2-23H3 in peptide binding assays. HMW-MAA-like Immunogenicity of the Anti-id mAb MK2-23-derived Peptide PMK2-23H3—Anti-id mAb MK2-23H3-derived peptide PMK2-23H3 elicited in BALB/c mice antibodies that reacted with the immunizing peptide, with the HMW-MAA-derived peptide PHMW.D2.7 and with anti-id mAb MK2-23, as measured in a peptide binding assay (Fig. 5A). The elicited antibody response is specific, since the sera from the mice immunized with the irrelevant peptide Pb2m displayed no detectable reactivity with peptides PMK2-23H3 and PHMW.D2.7. More importantly, peptide PMK2-23H3 elicited in BALB/c mice antibodies with selective reactivity with HMW-MAA-bearing cells. As shown in Fig. 5B, sera from peptide PMK2-23H3-immunized mice reacted with HMW-MAA-transfected M14 melanoma cells (M14.HMW-MAA) but did not react with the mock-transfected counterpart (M14.neo) both in ELISA and in FACS analysis. The crystal structure of the anti-id mAb MK2-23 Fab′ fragments revealed distinctive features of the three-dimensional conformations of CDR loops L1 and H3, strongly suggesting that the two loops play important roles in the interaction with mAb 763.74 and in the mimicry of the HMW-MAA epitope defined by mAb 763.74. Interestingly, when compared with H3 loops of anti-id mAb 409.5.3 (PDB code 1AIF), 6A6 (PDB code 1PG7), E225 (PDB code 1CIC), and E5.2 (PDB code 1DVF) with known three-dimensional structures, anti-id mAb MK2-23 L1 and H3 appear to be more protruded, displaying large variations in conformations. Of note is the left-handed hairpin turn present in L1 and a pair of anti-parallel β-strands with strong interstrand hydrogen-bonding present in H3. These findings are in agreement with the predicted structure of the corresponding HMW-MAA.D2.7 fragment, which may also adopt a similar β-strand conformation (28Staub E. Hinzmann B. Rosenthal A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate the involvement of the anti-id mAb MK2-23 H3 loop (and perhaps also of the L1 loop) in the HMW-MAA mimicry by anti-id mAb MK2-23. First, the two loops exhibit moderate aa sequence homology with the HMW-MAA core protein, and the homologous regions are located in the same CSPG repeat unit (aa 1128-1216) only 21 residues apart. Supported by secondary structure prediction, these two HMW-MAA regions may be spatially close to form the epitope recognized by the HMW-MAA-specific mAb 763.74. Second, the anti-id mAb MK2-23H3-derived peptide PMK2-23H3 inhibits the binding of mAb 763.74 to HMW-MAA-bearing cells to the same extent as the corresponding HMW-MAA-derived peptide PHMW.D2.7. Last, peptide PMK2-23H3 elicited HMW-MAA-specific antibodies in BALB/c mice which express the antigen AN2. The latter displays at least 80% homology with HMW-MAA. These results imply that the peptide PMK2-23H3 is able to break unresponsiveness to a self-tumor antigen. The role of the anti-id mAb MK2-23 L1 loop could not be tested in this study because of the low solubility of the synthesized peptide. Whether the L1 loop is part of the scaffold that helps form the HMW-MAA-mimicking moiety remains to be determined. Taken together, these results support the role of a 15-residue motif of the anti-id mAb MK2-23 H3 loop in the structural basis of HMW-MAA mimicry by the anti-id mAb MK2-23. The role of the H3 loop of anti-id antibodies in antigen mimicry has been reported in other antigenic systems. Fields et al. (32Fields B.A. Goldbaum F.A. Ysern X. Poljak R.J. Mariuzza R.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) have shown that in a hen egg lysozyme system the anti-id mAb VH3 accounts for 77% of the interaction with the idiotypic antibody. Furthermore, Ban et al. (33Ban N. Escobar C. Garcia R. Hasel K. Day J. Greenwood A. McPherson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1604-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that in the feline infectious peritonitis virus E2 peplomer system the anti-id mAb VH constitutes 63% of the binding interface with the idiotypic antibody. Notably, in these systems the anti-id antibodies were found to represent the mirror images of their nominal antigens, because they are both structurally and functionally similar to the nominal antigen, i.e. they are able to elicit antigen-binding, anti-anti-id antibodies. Whether this structural organization of the idiotypic cascade is a general rule or is restricted to some antigenic system remains to be determined. From a practical viewpoint, the identification of a single peptide loop as an important structure-mimicking element allows us to investigate the relationship between the degree of antigen mimicry by a peptide mimic and its ability to overcome unresponsiveness to the nominal self-antigen. In the case of anti-id mAb MK2-23, the 15-residue H3 loop is a partial β-strand and is self-stabilized by 4 interchain hydrogen bonds, suggesting that the anti-id mAb MK2-23 H3 loop is quite stable in solution. This feature will facilitate introduction of aa substitutions into the loop to modulate its structure and functional properties. It is tempting to speculate that subtle changes in the structural property of the H3 loop may change its ability to induce nominal antigen-specific immune response. This possibility is supported by the finding that the isoaspartyl form of a cytochrome c peptide but not its nominal (aspartyl) counterpart can break humoral tolerance to the self-cytochrome c (34Mamula M.J.

In addition to hair loss, female HHRs show involution of the mammary gland at an early stage of lactation. In the present study we investigated the mammary gland development in HHR. Morphological examinations revealed that HHR mammary glands are underdeveloped in virgins and exhibit distended alveoli on day 1 of lactation (L1), followed by involution. Milk secretion was observed on L1 in HHR. Whey acidic protein and other proteins were increased in milk of HHR and heterozygous rats on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

STAT5, one of the seven members of the STAT gene family, was identified as a prolactin-activated transcription factor essential for lactogenic hormone response in mammary epithelial cells (2Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). STAT5A, initially described as a regulator of milk protein gene transcription in mammary epithelial cells, is involved in different regulatory tasks in various cell types. The activation mechanism of STAT5 has been studied in detail (3Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Prolactin binding causes receptor dimerization and intracellular activation of Jak2 kinase. Tyrosine phosphorylation of receptor and of STAT5 molecules recruited to the receptor ensures the dimerization of STAT5 through interactions of phosphotyrosines with the Src homology 2 domains, followed by translocation to the nuclei. Transcription is activated through binding to specific DNA elements located in the promoters of responsive genes (4Bole-Feysot C. Goffin V. Edery M. Binart N. Kelly P.A. Endocr.

STAT5A expression has been detected in the mammary gland in its virgin, pregnant, lactating, and postlactation states (6Liu X. Robinson G.W. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Hennighausen L. Proc. Natl. Acad.

O-Linked N-acetylglucosaminylation (O-GlcNAc) is a frequent post-translational modification of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. One molecule of GlcNAc is linked as a single monosaccharide to the hydroxyl group of Ser or Thr and is not further elongated. Like phosphorylation, modification by O-GlcNAc is highly dynamic (11Zachara N.E. Hart G.W. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 12Medina L. Grove K.

Enzymes responsible for the attachment (O-GlcNAc transferase) and for removal (O-GlcNAcase) of this sugar (13Toleman C. Paterson A.J. Whisenhunt T.R. Kudlow J.E. J. Biol.

In 1985 a male hairless rat mutant was first observed among a breeding colony of Sprague-Dawley rats (SDRs) in our school and named the Hirosaki hairless rat (HHR). Breeding experiments revealed that the trait was autosomal recessive (15Hanada K. Chiyoya S. Suzuki K. Hashimoto I. Hatayama I. J. Dermatol. 1988; 15: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), but the responsible gene remains to be established.

HHR attain sexual maturity at approximately 10 weeks of age and give birth to young but are not able to nurse them (15Hanada K. Chiyoya S. Suzuki K. Hashimoto I. Hatayama I. J. Dermatol. 1988; 15: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Such a characteristic has also been reported for other mutant rats (18Inazu M. Kasai K. Sakaguchi T. Lab. Anim.

Physiol. 1935; 111: 392-396Crossref Google Scholar) and mice (21Howard A. J. Hered. 1940; 31: 467-470Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition to hair loss, female HHR shows involution of the mammary gland at early stage of lactation, and most newborn rats die within a week because of less feeding. In the present study we investigated the mammary gland development in HHR and found mature differentiation accompanying milk secretion at early stage of lactation followed by subsequent involution. In HHR, STAT5A is modified with O-GlcNAc but is not Tyr-phosphorylated on day 1 of lactation (L1). Furthermore, O-GlcNAcylated STAT5A is localized in nuclei of mammary epithelial cells and binds to the STAT5-responsive element. Animals—Female HHRs and SDRs maintained in our department were housed in plastic cages in air-conditioned rooms with a 12-h light/dark cycle in the Institute for Animal Experiments of Hirosaki University School of Medicine and had free access to water and food. A minimum of four female rats of individual genotypes, wild (SDR), HHR, and heterozygous, were sacrificed at ages indicated for experiments. This study was carried out in accordance with the Guidelines for Animal Experimentation, Hirosaki University. Histological Analysis and Immunohistochemistry—For whole mount examination, mammary tissues from rats were fixed on glass slides with acetone overnight and stained with Harris's hematoxylin according to the method described by Russo et al. (22Russo J. Saby J. Isenberg W.M. Russo I.H. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1977; 59: 435-445Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For histological examination, mammary tissues were fixed in 10% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections (4-μm thick) were routinely passed through xylene and a graded alcohol series and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The area of the lobuloalveolar structures was measured with the NIH image software program in nine microscopic fields at 100-fold magnification. Immunohistochemical analysis for STAT5A was performed by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) method (23Hsu S. Raine L. Fanger H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1981; 29: 577-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (13462) Google Scholar) using anti-STAT5A antibody (L-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Affinity-purified, biotin-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G and the ABC complex (Vectastain ABC kit, PK4001) were obtained from Vector Laboratories Inc. (Burlingame, CA). The sites of peroxidase binding were determined by the diaminobenzidine method. Sections were then lightly counterstained with hematoxylin for microscopic examination. Western Blotting—Nuclear or cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from rat mammary tissues, as described by Wheeler et al. (24Wheeler T.T. Broadhurst M.K. Sadowski H.B. Farr V.C. Prosser C.G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 176: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Proteins of these extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207280) Google Scholar) on 7.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted to Hybond nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) (26Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44927) Google Scholar). Blots were probed with an anti-STAT5A antibody (1:1000; v/v) or an anti-Tyr-phosphorylated STAT5A antibody (catalog number 9351, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000; v/vi; Amersham Biosciences). Signals were generated with an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to manufacturer's protocol. Antibody against O-GlcNAc-modified proteins was purchased from Affinity BioReagents, Inc. (Golden, CO). TUNEL Assay—Cell death was localized in tissue sections by TUNEL analysis (27Waddell B.J. Hisheh S. Dharmarajan A.M. Burton P.J. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 63: 1913-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Paraffin tissue sections (4 μm) were dewaxed by 60 °C for 30 min and washed with toluene twice for 5 min each. Sections were hydrated through a graded series of ethanol and phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with 20 μg/ml proteinase K in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, an ApopTag Plus peroxidase in situ apoptosis detection kit (Intergen Discovery Products, Purchase, NY) was used for nick-end labeling according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescein-linked nucleotides incorporated into DNA breaks were observed with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX60). Postweaning mammary tissue was included as a positive control. Prolactin Determination—Rat serum prolactin concentrations were measured with a commercial EIA kit (Wako, Osaka, Japan), according to manufacturer's protocol. Lectin Affinity Chromatography—Lectin affinity chromatography of nuclear extract or cytoplasmic extract was carried out with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-agarose beads (Wako). Lectin beads, 500 μl of 50% (v/v) suspension in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.4, and 0.5 m NaCl were incubated with 500 μl of nuclear or cytoplasmic extracts (500 μg of protein) for 1 h at room temperature. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford's method (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216607) Google Scholar). Bound proteins were eluted off of the beads with 1 m N-acetylglucosamine in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.5 m NaCl for 10 min at room temperature. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—An EMSA was carried out essentially as described by Schmitt-Ney et al. (29Schmitt-Ney M. Happ B. Ball R.K. Groner B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3130-3134Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and Li and Rosen (30Li S. Rosen J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2063-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The double-stranded oligonucleotide of the β-casein promoter, containing the high affinity STAT5A binding site (-75 to -104, 5′-TGTGGACTTCTTGGAATTAAGGGACTTTTG-3′), was used as a probe. Because the whey acidic protein (WAP) promoter (-740 to -720) did not provide shifted bands, the β-casein promoter was used. Nuclear extracts were incubated with the probe labeled with 32P and then electrophoresed on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and visualized by autoradiography. For the competition experiment a 10- to 50-fold excess of the unlabeled oligonucleotide was added. For the antibody supershift experiment, anti-STAT5A antibody or nonimmune serum was added to the reaction mixture containing labeled probe and proteins. Amino Acid Sequencing—Proteins of rat milk were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Blots were applied to a protein sequencer (model 492, Applied Biosystems). N-terminal amino acid sequencing was carried out as reported previously (31Ishikawa T. Tsuchida S. Satoh K. Sato K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). STAT5A cDNA Sequencing—Total RNAs were extracted from the mammary gland on L1 using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Seven primer pairs were designed for reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction, and RT-PCR was performed with an Access RT-PCR System (Promega). The RT-PCR products were loaded on agarose gel (1%) electrophoresis, and resolved bands were recovered from the gel using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). These were sequenced with a Big Dye terminator kit (PE Biosystem, Foster City, CA) and an ABI DNA sequencer Model 310 (PE Biosystems). Early Involution of HHR Mammary Glands in Lactation—Whole mount examination of HHR mammary glands was performed at the virgin stage (up to 12 weeks old) and on the 1st and 7th days of lactation, L1 and L7, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” During the virgin stage, HHR showed underdeveloped mammary glands with smaller alveoli and fewer branching, as compared with the SDR (Fig. 1, A and B). No differences in lobuloalveolar structure were, however, observed between HHR and SDR on L1 (Fig. 1, C and D). HHR glands showed involution and decreased lobuloalveolar structures on L7, whereas SDR maintained well developed structures (Fig. 1, E and F). Heterozygous rats showed normal mammary gland development patterns like those of SDRs (data not shown). Histological examination of HHR mammary glands was also performed on these time points. No differences were observed between HHR and SDR in virgins (Fig. 2, A and B). HHR glands on L1 showed mostly distended alveoli, and glandular acini were more expanded and more developed as compared with those of SDRs (Fig. 2, C and D). HHR glands on L7 showed involution, whereas SDRs maintained well developed structures of lactating mammary glands (Fig. 2, E and F). The area of lobuloalveolar structures in HHR on L1 occupied 48% of the mammary gland area, comparable with the value for the mammary gland of SDR (41%). In HHR the value decreased to 18% on L7, although it did not in SDR (Fig. 2G).FIGURE 2Histology of the mammary glands of HHR (A, C, and E) and SDR (B, D, and F) at various stages. The inguinal mammary glands from virgin rats (A and B), lactating rats 1 day after delivery (L1) (C and D), and lactating rats 7 days after delivery (L7) (E and F) were fixed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The images were obtained at 100× magnification. Panel G represents the percentage of areas of alveolar epithelia in the mammary tissues of lactating HHR (gray bars) and SDR (white bars) 1 day (L1) and 7 days (L7) after delivery.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Apoptosis Induction in HHR Mammary Glands in Lactation—To examine the early involution of HHR mammary glands, apoptotic cell death was evaluated by the TUNEL assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” On L1, TUNEL-positive cells occupied 2.5% of alveolar epithelial cells in HHR, although only 0.2% in SDR. Similar results were also obtained on L7 (Fig. 3). Heterozygous rats as well as SDR showed very low TUNEL-positive cells (data not shown). These results indicated that the accelerated involution of HHR mammary gland in lactation was due to apoptosis induction. WAP Levels in HHR Milk—Although the mammary glands of HHRs were involuted early in lactation and these rats could not raise their pups on L7, the glands showed expanded acini and milk secretion on L1. To examine whether milk protein profiles were different between HHRs and SDRs, milk collected from these rats, including heterozygous rats at L1, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). Protein staining revealed three major bands (67, 37, and 28 kDa) in SDR milk, whereas two additional bands (77 and 21 kDa, marked with asterisks in Fig. 4) along with two minor proteins (34 and 32 kDa) in HHR and heterozygous rats. By N-terminal amino acid sequencing, the 67-, 37-, and 28-kDa bands were identified as serum albumin, β-casein, and α-casein, respectively. The 21-kDa protein observed in HHR and heterozygous rats was identified as WAP. The 77-kDa protein could not be identified by this procedure. These results indicate that levels of four proteins including WAP are increased in HHR milk, raising the possibility of enhanced activities of some transcription factors. Localization of Unphosphorylated STAT5A in Nuclei of HHR Mammary Glands—Because STAT5A is a key transcription factor involved in the development of the mammary gland and WAP gene expression (30Li S. Rosen J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2063-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), we examined its expression in HHR mammary glands by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Protein levels of STAT5A (subunit Mr of 94 kDa) in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were not different between HHR and SDR on L1 and L7 (Fig. 5, A and B). Because phosphorylation of STAT5A at Tyr-694 is reported to be essential for its nuclear migration and transcriptional activity (2Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar), nuclear fractions were also examined with an antibody against Tyr-phosphorylated STAT5A. The phosphorylated form was not detected in HHR but was detected in SDR (Fig. 5C). Phosphorylated protein was also observed in heterozygous rats on L1 but not on L7. STAT5B was only faintly stained in cytoplasmic fractions of both HHRs and SDRs on L1 and L7 (data not shown). Immunohistochemistry was performed to demonstrate nuclear localization of STAT5A. In virgin rats, STAT5A was demonstrated in nuclei of mammary gland cells of SDRs, although only weakly in HHRs (Fig. 6, A and B). On L1 most nuclei of lobuloalveolar cells were heavily stained for STAT5A in HHRs, whereas some nuclei were weakly stained in SDRs (Fig. 6, C and D). On L7 HHRs lacked lobuloalveolar structures and showed ductal structures. Both nuclei and cytoplasm of ductal cells were heavily stained for STAT5A (Fig. 6E). SDR exhibited distended lobuloalveolar structures, and some nuclei were strongly stained (Fig. 6F). These results indicate that STAT5A is localized in nuclei of mammary gland cells in HHRs as well as SDRs.FIGURE 6Immunohistochemical analysis for STAT5A in the mammary glands of HHRs (A, C, and E) and SDRs (B, D, and F) at various stages. The inguinal mammary glands from virgin rats (A and B), lactating rats 1 day after delivery (L1) (C and D), and lactating rats 7 days after delivery (L7) (E and F) were fixed and stained for STAT5A with the antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The images were obtained at 200× magnification.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sequencing of HHR STAT5A cDNA—The sequencing of whole HHR STAT5A cDNA was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The deduced amino acid sequence did not differ from the rat STAT5A sequence reported to date (7Kazansky A.V. Raught B. Lindsey S.M. Wang Y.F. Rosen J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1598-1609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Serum Concentrations of Prolactin—Because prolactin is known to induce activation of STAT5A in the mammary gland (2Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar), serum levels were assayed in HHRs and SDRs. Prolactin concentrations were the highest at pregnancy (20 days postcoitus), and decreased on L1 in both HHRs and SDRs. The values were not different between HHRs and SDRs at individual time points except on L7 (Fig. 7). These results suggested that the activation of STAT5A in HHRs on L1 was not due to altered prolactin levels. Modification of STAT5A with O-Linked N-Acetylglucosamine in HHR Mammary Glands—STAT5A was localized in nuclei of HHR mammary gland cells but was not phosphorylated. Recently, it was reported that STAT5A is modified with O-linked GlcNAc for transcriptional activation (32Gewinner C. Hart G. Zachara N. Cole R. Beisenherz-Huss C. Groner B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3563-3572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To examine whether STAT5A in the HHR mammary gland was modified by glycosylation, cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of HHR and SDR were subjected to WGA affinity chromatography. The flow-through fractions and bound fractions eluted with 1 m GlcNAc were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Protein staining patterns of bound fractions were not significantly different between SDRs and HHRs on L1 and L7 (data not shown). In Western blotting with an antibody recognizing O-GlcNAc-modified proteins, however, several proteins ranging from 97- to 30-kDa were detected in the nuclei of the HHR mammary gland on L1, although not in SDR or heterozygous rats. Such bands were not observed in HHRs on L7 (Fig. 8A). With Western blotting we examined whether bound fractions include STAT5A. The protein was detected in HHR nuclei on L1 (Fig. 8B) but hardly in SDR or heterozygous rat nuclei. Bound fractions of HHR or SDR cytoplasmic fractions did not contain STAT5A (Fig. 8D), whereas unbound fractions did (Fig. 8, C and E). Binding of O-GlcNAcylated STAT5A to STAT5-responsive Element—Nuclear extracts from HHR and SDR mammary glands on L1 were subjected to EMSA with a probe for STAT5. Although STAT5A levels in nuclear extracts were not different between HHRs and SDRs (Fig. 5B), HHRs showed an increased amount of shifted band as compared with SDRs and heterozygous rats (Fig. 9A). The band was specific for the STAT5-responsive element, because it was lost with increasing amounts of unlabeled probe. To determine whether the band includes STAT5A, EMSA was performed in the presence of the anti-STAT5A antibody. Although supershifted band was not evident, the band was decreased by increasing amounts of the antibody (Fig. 9B). Furthermore, to examine whether O-GlcNAcylated STAT5A binds to the STAT5-responsive element, HHR nuclear extracts bound to WGA-agarose were also subjected to EMSA. Band shift occurred in bound fraction, indicating that O-GlcNAcylated STAT5A binds to the element (Fig. 9C). The present study has revealed that HHR mammary glands are underdeveloped in virgin rats and exhibited distended alveoli on L1 but involution on L7 due to apoptosis (Figs. 1, 2, 3). In milk obtained from HHR and heterozygous rats some proteins were increased, and one of them was identified as WAP. STAT5A is a transcription factor that regulates mammary gland maturation and expression of milk proteins including WAP (3Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 7Kazansky A.V. Raught B. Lindsey S.M. Wang Y.F. Rosen J.M. Mol.

Western blotting and immunohistochemical examination have revealed that STAT5A is localized in nuclei of HHR mammary gland cells but is not Tyr-phosphorylated (Fig. 5 and 6). We had considered a possibility that the STAT5A gene of HHR was mutated and that the mutant protein could not be phosphorylated at the Tyr-694 residue. Sequencing of whole HHR STAT5A cDNA obtained by RT-PCR revealed an identity with the STAT5A amino acid sequence reported to date (2Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar), ruling out such a possibility. O-GlcNAc modification of Ser and Thr residues of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins is proposed to modulate their functional activity, and O-GlcNAcylated proteins shuttle between cytoplasm and nucleus (34Comer F.I. Hart G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), suggesting that O-GlcNAc serves as a nuclear localization signal. Transcription factors such as STAT5, p53, c-Myc, and SV40 T antigen have been shown to be O-GlcNAcylated (12Medina L. Grove K. Haltiwanger R.S. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 35Shaw P. Freeman J. Bovey R. Iggo R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 921-930PubMed Google Scholar, 36Chou T.Y. Dang C.V. Hart G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4417-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Gewinner et al. (32Gewinner C. Hart G. Zachara N. Cole R. Beisenherz-Huss C. Groner B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3563-3572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) have reported that O-GlcNAc glycosylation is involved in activation of STAT5A. In the present study, STAT5A was demonstrated to be O-GlcNAcylated, and such modified STAT5A was only detected in nuclei of HHR on L1 (Fig. 8B). Furthermore, O-GlcNAcylated STAT5A was shown to bind to the STAT5-responsive element with an enhanced affinity (Fig. 9). Although we had examined whether the addition of an antibody against O-GlcNAc-modified proteins in the EMSA resulted in alterations in a shifted band, the results were negative (data not shown). Therefore, instead of the antibody, WGA-agarose was used to purify O-GlcNAc-modified proteins including STAT5A, and bound fractions were subjected to the assay. This exhibited a shifted band with a similar mobility as the band bound by STAT5A (Fig. 9, B and C). Furthermore, in Western blotting of bound fractions to WGA-agarose with an anti-O-GlcNAc-modified protein antibody, several proteins including a 94-kDa protein were detected in HHR nuclear extract, and the STAT5A band of 94-kDa was also demonstrated (Fig. 8, A and B). These results strongly support the hypothesis that STAT5A is modified with O-GlcNAc. O-GlcNAc modification and involution occurred simultaneously on L1 in HHRs. Because prolactin levels were not different between HHRs and SDRs (Fig. 7), activation of STAT5A in HHR is unlikely to be due to prolactin and seems to depend on the transient O-GlcNAc modification. Heterozygous rats did not show such modification or early involution. These results suggest a close association between STAT5A O-GlcNAcylation and involution induction. Either up-regulation of O-GlcNAc transferase activity (37Shafi R. Iyer S.P. Ellies L.G. O'Donnell N. Marker K.W. Chui D. Hart G.W. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5735-5739Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) or down-regulation of O-GlcNAcase activity is suggested as a factor involved in increase of the glycosylated protein, and further study is needed to identify the factors. Milk WAP was increased not only in HHR but also in heterozygous rats without STAT5A glycosylation, indicating that WAP expression in heterozygotes was not due to glycosylated STAT5A. Furthermore, unlike involution, WAP expression in heterozygotes is not consistent with the pattern of HHR inheritance. Although STAT5A regulates expression of genes encoding milk proteins such as WAP (30Li S. Rosen J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2063-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and β-casein (2Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 38Groner B. Altiok S. Meier V. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 100: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), only WAP was increased in HHR. It remains to be clarified whether O-GlcNAcylated STAT5A as well as Tyr-phosphorylated STAT5A can stimulate expression of WAP and β-casein genes. Several groups have documented an apparent reciprocity between O-GlcNAc modification and O-phosphorylation (13Toleman C. Paterson A.J. Whisenhunt T.R. Kudlow J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53665-53673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 39Haltiwanger R.S. Kelly W.G. Roquemore E.P. Biomberg M.A. Dong L.Y. Kreppel L. Chou T.Y. Hart G.W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1992; 20: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), suggesting that the addition of GlcNAc to Ser or Thr residues of proteins blocks phosphorylation of these residues. STAT5A of HHR did not exhibit Tyr phosphorylation but exhibited O-GlcNAcylation. Ser phosphorylation of STAT3 is suggested to inhibit Tyr phosphorylation (40Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blensi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Thus, STAT5A O-GlcNAcylation on a Ser residue in HHR may block subsequent Tyr phosphorylation. Because in addition to STAT5A many O-GlcNAc modified proteins were detected in HHRs (Fig. 8A), changes in O-GlcNAc transferase or O-GlcNAcase activities may be involved in altered phenotypes of the mutant strain. It was reported that constitutively active STAT5A has pleiotropic functions regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in an interleukin 3-dependent Ba/F3 cell line (41Ariyoshi K. Nosaka T. Yamada K. Onishi M. Oka Y. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24407-24413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 42Nosaka T. Kawashima T. Misawa K. Ikuta K. Mui A.L. Kitamura T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4754-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Because HHR mammary glands are underdeveloped during the virgin stage, STAT5A seems to be less active during the virgin stage (Figs. 1 and 6) and pregnancy (data not shown), suggesting that HHR STAT5A is not constitutively active but transiently activated at the early stage of lactation. Targeted disruption of STAT5A gene in mice resulted in underdevelopment of the mammary gland during pregnancy and lactation (43Liu X. Robinson G.W. Wagner K.U. Garrett L. Wynshaw-Boris A. Hennighausen L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in nuclear receptor coactivators such as the steroid receptor coactivators SRC-1, and SRC-3, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-binding protein (PBP), and PPAR-interacting protein (PRIP) exhibit defective development of the mammary gland (44Xu J.

SRC-1-deficient mice and PRIP-deficient mice show a normal elongation of ducts but decreased number of ductal branches during puberty and decreased numbers and small size of alveoli during pregnancy (44Xu J.

The PRIP-deficient mice also show decreased numbers of lobuloalveoli during lactation and failed to nurture pups. Like these mutant mice, HHRs show underdeveloped mammary gland during the virgin stage but well developed structure on L1. Expression of these nuclear receptor coactivators was retained in the mammary glands of HHRs (data not shown). Thus, these coactivators are unlikely to be responsible for disorders in mammary gland development of HHRs. The development of epithelial organs such as the mammary gland and hair depends on a series of sequential interactions between epithelial cells and adjacent mesenchymal cells (48Dunbar M.E. Dann P.R. Robinson G.W. Hennighausen L. Zhang J.P. Wysolmerski J.J. Development. 1999; 126: 3485-3493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of parathyroid hormone-related protein interferes with hair follicle development (49Wysolmerski J.J. Broadus A.E. Zhou J. Fuchs E. Milstone L.M. Philbrick W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1133-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and impairs branching morphogenesis during mammary gland development and lobuloalveolar development during pregnancy (50Wysolmerski J.J. McCaughern-Carucci J.F. Daifotis A.G. Broadus A.E. Philbrick W.M. Development. 1995; 121: 3539-3547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although underdevelopment of the mammary gland and hair loss in HHR seem to reflect disorders in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, enhanced expression of the protein was not observed in these organs by immunohistochemistry (data not shown). In conclusion, the present study indicated that the mammary glands of HHR show terminal differentiation for a short period at early stage of lactation, immediately followed by involution. In HHR, STAT5A is modified with O-GlcNAc but is not Tyr-phosphorylated on L1. This type of glycosylation is suggested to be involved in the transient activation of STAT5A in HHR. We thank Drs. Takashi Ishikawa and Tatsusuke Sato, Department of Medical Technology, Hirosaki University School of Health Sciences, for advice and support."
https://openalex.org/W2042291783,"The cold-active phosphoglycerate kinase from the Antarctic bacterium Pseudomonas sp. TACII18 exhibits two distinct stability domains in the free, open conformation. It is shown that these stability domains do not match the structural N- and C-domains as the heat-stable domain corresponds to about 80 residues of the C-domain, including the nucleotide binding site, whereas the remaining of the protein contributes to the main heat-labile domain. This was demonstrated by spectroscopic and microcalorimetric analyses of the native enzyme, of its mutants, and of the isolated recombinant structural domains. It is proposed that the heat-stable domain provides a compact structure improving the binding affinity of the nucleotide, therefore increasing the catalytic efficiency at low temperatures. Upon substrate binding, the enzyme adopts a uniformly more stable closed conformation. Substrate-induced stability changes suggest that the free energy of ligand binding is converted into an increased conformational stability used to drive the hinge-bending motions and domain closure.

Besides its key metabolic function in living organisms, PGK has been widely used as a model enzyme to study domains in proteins and their relative motions (1Jaenicke R. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 155-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 2Reed M.A. Hounslow A.M. Sze K.H. Barsukov I.G. Hosszu L.L. Clarke A.R. Craven C.J. Waltho J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Indeed, the structure of PGK consists of two globular domains of nearly equal size, referred to as the N- and C-terminal domains, linked by a hinge helix. In this structure, the C terminus of the protein crosses back the hinge region and folds into the N-domain, bringing the N- and C-extremities in close proximity where they generally interact via ion pairs (3Blake C.C.

Blake C.F. Proteins. 1992; 12: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), whereas the nucleotide substrate is bound to the C-domain (6Davies G.J. Gamblin S.J. Littlechild J.A. Dauter Z.

Crystallographic studies have shown that the free or single substrate-liganded forms adopt an open conformation in which the distance between the substrates is too long to permit catalysis, probably to avoid the futile hydrolysis of 1,3-PGA or ATP (7Bernstein B.E. Michels P.A. Hol W.G. Nature. 1997; 385: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). By contrast, the binding of both substrates induces a closed conformation resulting from hinge-bending motions of 32° at the level of the hinge helices and leading to domain closure into a catalytically competent conformation with well aligned substrates for phosphoryl transfer (7Bernstein B.E.

The stability and folding of yeast PGK has been extensively investigated and deconvolution of its single DSC heat absorption peak suggests the occurrence of two overlapping transitions that have been tentatively assigned to the N- and C-domains (9Brandts J.F. Hu C.Q. Lin L.N. Mas M.T. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8588-8596Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Furthermore, folding studies using guanidinium chloride as denaturation agent have suggested that the C-domain is the most stable domain, although contradicting results have been reported (9Brandts J.F.

In this context, the PGK from the Antarctic bacterium Pseudomonas sp. TACII18 (PsPGK) represents a unique model to study stability domains in PGK. The high level of amino acid sequence similarity of PsPGK with phosphoglycerate kinases from other species has allowed the building of a homology model based on the available crystal structures (14Bentahir M. Feller G. Aittaleb M. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Himri T. Chessa J.P. Gerday C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11147-11153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, crystals of PsPGK have been obtained (15Mandelman D. Bentahir M. Feller G. Gerday C. Haser R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1666-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and its structure solved at 2.1 Å resolution indeed reveals a general fold identical to that of other monomeric PGKs. 3D.

Aghajari, manuscript in preparation. However, the preliminary characterization of PsPGK by DSC (14Bentahir M. Feller G. Aittaleb M. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Himri T. Chessa J.P. Gerday C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11147-11153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) has shown that it possesses two well defined transitions in the unliganded conformation (see also Fig. 1). It follows that the enzyme contains two types of structures or regions differing by their intrinsic stability and responsible for the occurrence of a heat-labile domain (melting point (Tm) ∼50 °C) and a heat-stable domain (Tm ∼60 °C) when thermal unfolding is recorded by DSC. Such stability domains within the protein may or may not correspond to the structural N- and C-domains. One cannot exclude for instance that each structural domain contains both heatlabile and heat-stable structures that unfold sequentially. We report here the unusual stability pattern of this enzyme and the complex effects of substrate binding inducing hinge-bending motions. The results have several implications in folding studies of PGK and of proteins in general as well as in the field of enzyme adaptations to extreme temperatures. Mutagenesis of PsPGK—The pgk gene from the Antarctic bacterium Pseudomonas sp. TACII18 has been cloned in the expression vector pET22b as previously described (14Bentahir M. Feller G. Aittaleb M. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Himri T. Chessa J.P. Gerday C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11147-11153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Genetic engineering was performed on the gene or on gene fragments inserted in the plasmid pSP73. Mutations were introduced by polymerase chain reaction as described (16Feller G. Bussy O. Houssier C. Gerday C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23836-23841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The mutation Trp305 → Phe was introduced by changing the codon TGG into TTC on the gene fragment generated by SalI-PstI digestion. The mutation Phe135 → Trp was introduced by changing the codon TTT into TGG on the gene fragment generated by XbaI-SalI digestion. Deletion of domain coding regions was carried out by inverse PCR using silent primers, 24 nucleotides in length, starting in 5′ at codon for Thr1 (reverse primer) and for Ala172 (forward primer) for the deletion of the N-domain and starting in 5′ at codon for Leu170 (reverse primer) and at the stop codon (forward primer) for the deletion of the C-domain. The amplification products were purified (QIAquick PCR purification kit, Qiagen), phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase and circularized by ligation before transformation. The sequence of these constructions was checked by double-strand sequencing on an ALF DNA sequencer Express II (Amersham Biosciences) and transferred to the expression vector using appropriate restriction sites. Protein Expression and Purification—The recombinant proteins were expressed in Eschericha coli BL21(DE3) grown at 18 °C as described previously (14Bentahir M. Feller G. Aittaleb M. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Himri T. Chessa J.P. Gerday C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11147-11153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), except that Terrific broth was used for cultivation and induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-galactopyranoside was performed at A600 nm of the culture between 3 and 5. The recombinant proteins were purified essentially as described (14Bentahir M. Feller G. Aittaleb M. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Himri T. Chessa J.P. Gerday C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11147-11153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) following high pressure or freeze-thawing cell disruption, protamine sulfate precipitation of nucleic acids, ammonium sulfate fractionation, phenyl-Sepharose, and Q-Sepharose chromatography. The double mutant Phe135 → Trp/Trp305 → Phe was precipitated at 50% ammonium sulfate saturation, whereas the recombinant isolated domains were brought to 30% ammonium sulfate saturation before phenyl-Sepharose chromatography. For the domain proteins, the buffer was 50 mm Tris, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm benzamidine, pH 7.5, and a second Q-Sepharose chromatography was required. All the proteins were pure on the basis of a single band on SDS-PAGE, a single N-terminal amino acid sequence, and a single ion distribution in mass spectrometry. Analytical Procedures—N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined using a pulsed liquid-phase protein sequencer (Procise 492, Applied Biosystems, PerkinElmer Division) fitted with an on-line phenylthiohydantoin analyzer. Electrospray mass spectrometry of the proteins (5-10 μm) was performed on a Q-TOF Ultima mass spectrometer (Micromass). Absorbance spectra were recorded on an Uvikon XS spectrophotometer (Bio-Tek Instruments). Fluorescence spectra were recorded on an SLM-Aminco model 8100 spectrofluorimeter (Spectronic Instruments). Circular dichroism spectra were acquired under constant nitrogen flush using a J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Corp.) in a 0.2-cm path length cell for the far-UV region. All spectrophotometric analyses were performed at 20 °C. Differential Scanning Calorimetry—Measurements were performed using a MicroCal MCS-DSC instrument as detailed (17Feller G. d'Amico D. Gerday C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4613-4619Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Samples (∼3 mg/ml) were dialyzed overnight against 30 mm Mops, pH 7.5. Thermograms of the isolated domains and for reversibility tests were recorded in the presence of 0.5 m 3-(1-pyridinio)-1-propanesulfonate to delay aggregation. Thermograms were analyzed according to a non-two-state model in which the Tm, the calorimetric enthalpy (ΔHcal), and the van't Hoff enthalpy (ΔHvH) of individual transitions are fitted independently using the MicroCal Origin software (version 2.9). The magnitude and source of the errors in the Tm and enthalpy values have been discussed elsewhere (18Matouschek A. Matthews J.M. Johnson C.M. Fersht A.R. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Fitting standard errors on a series of three DSC measurements made under the same conditions in the present study were found to be ±0.1 K on Tm and ±1% on both enthalpies. Fitting standard errors on four batches of purified PsPGK were found to be ± 1 Kon Tm and ± 10% on both enthalpies. General Properties—The thermogram of PsPGK (Fig. 1a) shows that its heat-induced unfolding is characterized by two distinct heat absorption peaks separated by a temperature interval of about 10 °C (TABLE ONE) and henceforward referred to as the heat-labile (Tm = 49.8 °C) and the heat-stable (Tm = 60.6 °C) transitions (with Tm, the melting point at the top of the transition). In our experimental conditions, no aggregation occurred in the heated sample and a stable post-transition baseline was recorded allowing the calculation of a progress baseline accounting for both transitions (Fig. 1a). On this basis, an estimation of the heat capacity difference between the unfolded and the native states can be made for the whole molecule (ΔCp = 7.47 kcal mol-1 K-1), for the heat-labile (ΔCp = 5,93 kcal mol-1 K-1) and the heat-stable (ΔCp = 1,54 kcal mol-1 K-1) transitions. A ΔCp value of 7.5 kcal mol-1 K-1 has been reported for yeast PGK (11Freire E. Murphy K.P. Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Galisteo M.L. Privalov P.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and the specific value of 19.3 cal/mol residue for PsPGK (386 amino acid residues) is in perfect agreement with data reported for large proteins (17Feller G. d'Amico D. Gerday C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4613-4619Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). As far as heat absorption during unfolding is concerned, the normalized surface (ΔHcal, corresponding to all enthalpy-driven interactions disrupted during unfolding) below the heat-labile transition is nearly twice that of the heat-stable transition (Fig. 1b; TABLE ONE), indicating that a large fraction of the native PsPGK conformation has a low stability. As shown in Fig. 2, thermal unfolding of the heat-labile transition is fully reversible. In addition, the ΔHcal/ΔHvH ratio for this transition (where ΔHvH is the van't Hoff enthalpy calculated from the slope of the transition) is ∼1.5, indicating that the heat-labile transition may be composed by more than one cooperative unit, as confirmed below. By contrast, thermal unfolding of the heat-stable transition is not reversible and, as a result, the ΔHcal/ΔHvH ratio decreases to ∼0.35. It should be noted that unfolding of the latter transition drastically reduces the reversibility of the heatlabile transition (Fig. 2). This suggests that the protein regions involved in both transitions are structurally connected. Addition of 5 mm dithiothreitol does not improve the reversibility, indicating that oxidation of the three free cysteines (Cys56, Cys132, and Cys207) is not a major determinant of the irreversible unfolding.TABLE ONEThermodynamic parameters of the free and liganded PsPGK and of its isolated domains ΣΔ Hcal is the integrated area of the transition and may differ from the sum of the individual ΔHcal obtained by deconvolution.Protein and ligandTm1ΔHcal1ΔHvH1Tm2ΔHcal2ΔHvH2ΣΔHcal°Ckcal mol–1kcal mol–1°Ckcal mol–1kcal mol–1kcal mol–1Free PsPGK49.81609860.657147217+ 5 mm ADP54.416510260.963139226+ 5 mm 3-PGA55.116111260.853158212+5 mm Mg2+-ADP, 3-PGA (closed)60.5220250219+40 mm Na2SO456.3228154222Free N-domain51.611611Free C-domain58.34814148+5 mm Mg2+-ADP60.49615299 Open table in a new tab Mutagenesis Study of the Structural Domains—PsPGK contains one single Trp residue at position 305 in the C-domain. As shown by heat-induced unfolding monitored by fluorescence (excitation wavelength: 295 nm), this Trp is quenched in its microenvironment. Indeed, unfolding results in fluorescence increase (Fig. 1c) and the appearance of a hyperfluorescent intermediate. The temperature of maximal dequenching closely corresponds to the melting point of the heat-labile transition observed by DSC. The mutation Trp305 → Phe totally abolishes the dequenching transition (data not shown) therefore ascertaining the assignment of the fluorescence signal to Trp305. Interestingly, the DSC thermogram of this mutant displays an altered heat-labile transition (Fig. 3), as indicated by the decrease of Tm (-5 °C) and of ΔHcal (-30%), whereas the heat-stable transition remains almost unaffected. One can conclude that the C-domain mainly contributes to the heat-labile transition. On the other hand, the mutation Phe135 → Trp has been introduced in the N-domain and the DSC trace of this mutant (Fig. 3) also exhibits a drastic destabilization of the heat-labile transition (Tm -8 °C, ΔHcal -50%). These results indicate that both N and C structural domains of PsPGK contribute to the heat-labile DSC transition. Accordingly, each DSC transition of PsPGK cannot be assigned to the unfolding of a specific structural domain. One can also note a slight increase of the Tm for the heat-stable transition in both mutants. This can be tentatively related to the relaxation of weak interactions between interacting domains in the protein when one of these domains is destabilized (9Brandts J.F. Hu C.Q. Lin L.N. Mas M.T. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8588-8596Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 11Freire E. Murphy K.P. Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Galisteo M.L. Privalov P.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). When both mutations are combined in the double mutant Phe135 → Trp/Trp305 → Phe, it is expressed and purified as an inactive and partly folded protein, as demonstrated by the weak DSC heat absorption peak (Fig. 3, inset). It was found that after addition of 20 mm sulfate ions, the double mutant recovered 20% of the wild-type PsPGK activity. In the presence of sulfate, the DSC thermogram of the mutant exhibits two slight transitions (Fig. 3, inset). This indicates that the sulfate ion behaves like a folding effector of PsPGK. The Isolated N and C Structural Domains—To further characterize the contribution of the PsPGK structural domains in both DSC transitions, the isolated N- and C-domains were expressed in E. coli from the pgk gene truncated in the middle of the first hinge helix. The plasmid construct coding for the N-domain contained the nucleotide sequence from Met-Thr1 to Leu170 (mature protein numbering; 18,107.9 Da for 170 aa), whereas the sequence for Met-Thr1-Ala172 to Ala386 was used for the C-domain (21,996.3 Da for 216 aa). It should be recalled that because the C-terminal end of PGK folds into the N-domain, truncation in the middle of the gene results in the expression of an N-domain devoid of ∼15 residues that remain attached to the recombinant C-domain. N-terminal amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry analyses (N-domain: 18,107 Da; C-domain: 21,999 Da) indicated that the initiating formylmethionine has been removed and that no other post-translational modification occurred during the expression and purification processes. The UV absorbance spectra well reflect the aromatic amino acid content of the analyzed proteins. The N-domain (six Phe, three Tyr) lacking Trp has a low absorption coefficient (ϵ280 nm = 3,960 m-1 cm-1) and its spectrum is dominated by Tyr residues, with three slight shoulders from Phe between 260 and 270 nm (Fig. 4a). Having an additional Trp residue, the absorption coefficient of the C-domain (nine Phe, three Tyr, one Trp) is much higher (ϵ280 nm = 9,530 m-1 cm-1). An equimolar mix of both N- and C-domains restores the absorbance value of the native PsPGK but the imperfect superimposition of the spectra indicates slight differences in the aromatic microenvironment within the recombinant domains. The fluorescence emission spectrum of PsPGK (Fig. 4b) is poorly defined as a result of the above-mentioned quenching of Trp305. Similarly, the N-domain fluorescence spectrum is dominated by Tyr residues. However, the pronounced red shift of the C-domain fluorescence spectrum shows that Trp 305 is dequenched and therefore, this residue is not in its native microenvironment in the recombinant domain. It follows that the equimolar mix of both domains restores the maximal fluorescence intensity of the native PsPGK but at a higher emission wavelength. The far-UV circular dichroism spectrum of the native PsPGK (Fig. 4c) displays two strong ellipticity minima at 208 and 222 nm indicating a high content of secondary structures. The spectra of both isolated N- and C-domains also present these minima but at a weaker ellipticity, especially for the N-domain. As a result, the equimolar mix of both domains reveals a lower secondary structure content as compared with the native enzyme. Finally, the near-UV CD spectra indicate an asymmetric environment of aromatic residues (and possibly of cysteines) typical of a folded conformation in the three proteins and the equimolar mix (Fig. 4d). From these spectrophotometric analyses, it can be concluded that the isolated N- and C-domains possess well organized secondary structures and a defined tertiary structure which however differ from the native state of PsPGK. Nevertheless, the DSC thermograms of these isolated domains reveal their individual contribution to the biphasic profile of the native PsPGK (Fig. 5). The recombinant C-domain unfolds at a temperature closely corresponding to the heat-stable transition and accounts for about 80% of heat absorption (ΔHcal = 48 kcal mol-1). By contrast, the N-domain is strongly destabilized and only accounts for less than 10% (ΔHcal = 11 kcal mol-1) of the heat-labile transition. It seems therefore that only the C-domain contributes to the heat-stable DSC transition, whereas the structures of both domains responsible for the heat-labile DSC transition have not a compact conformation in the recombinant fragments. The spectroscopic and calorimetric data therefore indicate that the heat-labile structures in the recombinant domains tend to have molten globule-like properties, i.e. a defined but non-compact conformation with a low intrinsic conformational stability (Figs. 4 and 5). This contrasts with the well folded isolated domains obtained from more stable PGKs (10Missiakas D. Betton J.M. Minard P. Yon J.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8683-8689Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19Hosszu L.L. Craven C.J. Spencer J. Parker M.J. Clarke A.R. Kelly M. Waltho J.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 20Zaiss K. Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4633-4639Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the isolated C-domain still binds the substrate Mg2+-ADP (Fig. 5, inset, and TABLE ONE), as revealed by the large (ΔHcal +50 kcal mol-1) and sharp transition at a higher Tm (+2 °C). On the other hand, both 3-PGA and sulfate seem to bind to the isolated N-domain, but these effects cannot be quantified as a result of the weakness of the heat absorption peak. Substrate-induced Stability Changes—Crystallographic studies have shown that the PGK from Trypanosoma brucei can be trapped in the closed, active conformation (7Bernstein B.E. Michels P.A. Hol W.G. Nature. 1997; 385: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) upon incubation with one substrate (Mg2+-ADP) and one product (3-PGA). In these conditions, the DSC thermogram of PsPGK (Fig. 6) reveals that substrate binding and the resulting hinge-bending motions drive the free (open) PsPGK into a closed, compact and uniformly more stable conformation, as indicated by the single sharp transition at a higher Tm. The ΔHcal/ΔHvH ratio of ∼0.9 also indicates that unfolding of the closed conformation is cooperative and approaches a two-state mechanism which however is poorly reversible (∼6%; data not shown). The nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analog AMP-pnp has been used to study hinge bending but the crystal structures of the porcine 3-PGA-AMP-pnp (21May A. Vas M. Harlos K. Blake C. Proteins. 1996; 24: 292-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and the yeast 3-PGA-AMP-pnp (22McPhillips T.M. Hsu B.T. Sherman M.A. Mas M.T. Rees D.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4118-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) complexes do not adopt a closed conformation. As a matter of fact, the thermogram of PsPGK incubated with Mg2+ AMP-pnp and 3-PGA (Fig. 6) is indicative of a less compact and stable conformation (estimated from the sharpness and Tm of the transition, respectively) than that recorded for the closed conformation. It should also be noted that in the absence of Mg2+, the conformational changes promoted by ADP and 3-PGA are less pronounced (Fig. 6), underlining that the true physiological substrate is the complex Mg2+-ADP. Crystallographic studies have shown that the individual substrates do not induce the closed conformation (5Harlos K. Vas M. Blake C.F. Proteins. 1992; 12: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 6Davies G.J. Gamblin S.J. Littlechild J.A. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Watson H.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, the DSC thermograms of PsPGK incubated with one substrate (Fig. 6) display drastic alterations of both the heat-labile and heat-stable transitions, revealing significant modifications of the structure energetics. Finally, the DSC traces of PsPGK in the presence of Mg2+-ADP and of Mg2+-ATP are markedly different suggesting that upon phosphoryl transfer to ATP, the enzyme undergoes a noticeable conformational change. It should be noted that all these substrate-induced stability changes only affect the Tm values and the unfolding cooperativity of the transitions. Indeed, as shown in TABLE ONE, there is no significant variation of the surface of the transitions (ΔHcal) for the binary and ternary PsPGK complexes, whereas the sharpness (ΔHvH) and Tm of the transitions are modified. Substrate and Ion Binding—The available crystal structures of binary and ternary PGK complexes and a multiple sequence alignment allowed to identify the highly conserved residues of PsPGK involved in substrate and ion binding. 3-PGA binds to the N-terminal domain (residues Asp20, Asn22, Arg35, His58, Arg61, Arg112, Gly141, Arg145, Gly362, Gly363, and Ala364) in the so-called basic patch, whereas ADP binds to the C-terminal domain (residues Ser191, Lys196, Ile282, Leu283, Asn306, Glu313,Gly340, and Thr342). Fig. 7 shows the effect of increasing concentrations of both substrates on the DSC thermograms of PsPGK. It can be seen that upon 3-PGA binding, the Tm of the heat labile transition is displaced toward higher values whereas the heat-stable transition remains unaffected. This confirms that the structural N-domain bearing the 3-PGA binding site belongs to the heat-labile DSC transition. On the other hand, upon ADP binding the stability of the heat-labile transition is improved, but in this case, the surface (ΔHcal) of the heat-stable transition is also increased. This again confirms that the structural C-domain bearing the ADP binding site contributes to both the heatlabile and heat-stable DSC transitions. Interestingly, a plot of the Tm increase for the heat-labile transition as a function of the substrate concentration can be fitted to a binding isotherm (Fig. 7, insets) providing apparent Kd values of 0.51 mm for 3-PGA and 0.38 mm for ADP. These values are in agreement with the Km values previously determined by standard kinetic methods (14Bentahir M. Feller G. Aittaleb M. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Himri T. Chessa J.P. Gerday C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11147-11153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The above-mentioned experiments have been performed in the absence of Mg2+. This ion was shown to interact with an acidic side chain of the ADP binding site (7Bernstein B.E. Michels P.A. Hol W.G. Nature. 1997; 385: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), corresponding to Asp341 in the C-domain of PsPGK. Fig. 8 shows that increasing concentrations of MgCl2 only affect the heat-stable DSC transition by decreasing its Tm. At MgCl2 concentrations higher than 2 mm, the heat-stable transition tends to fuse with the heat-labile DSC transition that remains unaltered but sample precipitation precluded further analysis of this phenomenon. These results clearly demonstrate that the Mg2+-binding site belongs to the heat-stable DSC transition. Finally, the sulfate ion can be viewed as a test case for our assignment of the DSC transitions because it has been reported to bind both to the N- (Arg61) and C- (Lys192) domains (23Szilagyi A.N. Vas M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8551-8563Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). And indeed, increasing Na2SO4 concentrations affect both the heat-labile and heat-stable DSC transitions (Fig. 8), which fuse in a conformation mimicking the substrate-induced closed conformation, however, at a lower Tm. Stability and Structural Domains—Several multidomain proteins display distinct stability domains resulting in multiphasic DSC thermograms (24Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1982; 35: 1-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). In some cases, a close correlation was found between structural and stability domains, i.e. each DSC transition can be assigned to the unfolding of a specific structural domain (25Novokhatny V.V. Kudinov S.A. Privalov P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 215-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 26Tatunashvili L.V. Filimonov V.V. Privalov P.L. Metsis M.L. Koteliansky V.E. Ingham K.C. Medved L.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 27Lin L.N. Mason A.B. Woodworth R.C. Brandts J.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1881-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 28Misselwitz R. Welfle K. Welfle H. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1994; 16: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 29Suzuki Y. Takano K. Kanaya S. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 632-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, PsPGK clearly demonstrates that such correlation is not always valid as, in this case, we have shown that the heat-stable DSC domain belongs to the structural C-domain, whereas both N and C structural domains contribute to the main heat-labile DSC domain. The size of the heat-stable domain in PsPGK can be estimated to 100 residues in a first approximation, assuming that all 386 residues contribute equally to ΔHcal of the DSC transitions (TABLE ONE). A more precise estimation of 80 residues can be based on ΔCp of the transitions (5.93 and 1.54 kcal mol-1 K-1 for the first and second transitions, respectively) because this parameter has been found relatively constant for proteins of similar size, whatever their intrinsic stability (17Feller G. d'Amico D. Gerday C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4613-4619Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The spectroscopic and mutagenesis studies as well as the effects of substrates and ions on the DSC transitions indicate that this heat-stable domain includes or is very close to the nucleotide binding site. If the stability pattern of the PsPGK structural C-domain (i.e. containing both heat-labile and heat-stable structures) is extended to other homologous PGK, this can partly explain the contradicting results reported for the stability of the C-domain (9Brandts J.F. Hu C.Q. Lin L.N. Mas M.T. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8588-8596Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 10Missiakas D. Betton J.M. Minard P. Yon J.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8683-8689Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 11Freire E. Murphy K.P. Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Galisteo M.L. Privalov P.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 12Gast K. Damaschun G. Desmadril M. Minard P. Muller-Frohne M. Pfeil W. Zirwer D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 13Sherman M.A. Beechem J.M. Mas M.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13934-13942Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Substrate-induced Stability Changes and Hinge-bending Motions— Considering the weak stability of the major DSC transition (Fig. 1), the free PsPGK appears to possess a relatively loose open conformation. Upon binding of a single substrate molecule, either Mg2+ADP or 3-PGA, the heat-labile structures evolve toward a more compact conformation (Fig. 7). This can be related to an induced-fit mechanism by which binding of the substrate induces a structural rearrangement of the binding site. It should be noted that this drastic modification of PsPGK conformational stability mainly involves the structure energetics because only discrete modifications have been reported between the crystal structures of free and single substrate-bound PGKs (5Harlos K. Vas M. Blake C.F. Proteins. 1992; 12: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 6Davies G.J. Gamblin S.J. Littlechild J.A. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Watson H.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The behavior of the isolated C-domain provides useful insights into the energetics of hinge-bending motions in PsPGK. Indeed, Fig. 5 (inset) and TABLE ONE show a drastic increase of ΔHcal and of Tm for this isolated domain upon Mg2+-ADP binding. An estimation of the conformational stability in the free and substrate-bound states can be obtained using Equation 1. ΔG(T)=ΔHcal(1−T/Tm)+ΔCp(T−Tm)−TΔCplnT/Tm) (Eq. 1) The validity of this approximation has been discussed elsewhere (30Privalov P.L. Medved L.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 159: 665-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 31Vogl T. Jatzke C. Hinz H.J. Benz J. Huber R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1657-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 32D'Amico S. Marx J.C. Gerday C. Feller G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7891-7896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The computed stability curves indicate an increase of the conformational stability (free energy of unfolding) of 5.5 kcal mol-1 upon substrate binding. On the other hand, the free energy of substrate binding can be estimated to -5 kcal mol-1 using the Km value for the nucleotide (0.21 mm) and the following relation (Equation 2). ΔGb=−RTlnKa (Eq. 2) Comparison of both free energy estimates strongly suggests that the nucleotide binding free energy is transferred into conformational stability. However, such behavior of the heat-stable transition is not observed in the native PsPGK upon ADP (Fig. 7) and Mg2+ (Fig. 8) binding. One can therefore propose that in the native enzyme, the gain in conformational stability arising from substrate binding is now converted into the energy required for hinge-bending motions and domain closure. The lack of ΣΔHcal difference between the free and closed forms of PsPGK (TABLE ONE) also supports this view. Finally, in a thoughtful study of PGK activation, the authors concluded that it cannot be decided whether anion activation is a consequence of domain closure or anion binding itself mediates the closure by connecting the two domains (23Szilagyi A.N. Vas M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8551-8563Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). From our results, it seems that the latter hypothesis is valid, as demonstrated by the apparent domain closure induced by the sulfate anion activator (Fig. 8). Activity at Low Temperatures—The unusual stability pattern of PsPGK should also be considered in the context of the enzyme adaptations to catalysis at low temperatures. In order to catalyze the essential glycolytic step at temperatures close to 0 °C found in the Antarctic environment, this enzyme possesses a high specific activity to compensate for the reduction of chemical reaction rates at such low temperatures. In addition, PsPGK displays a high affinity for the nucleotide, therefore improving the kcat /Km ratio which is the relevant parameter for intracellular enzymes (14Bentahir M. Feller G. Aittaleb M. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Himri T. Chessa J.P. Gerday C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11147-11153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It has been argued that the high activity of cold-adapted enzymes is gained through an improved flexibility or mobility of the active site and of the structures bearing the active site residues in order to facilitate molecular motions in low thermal energy conditions (32D'Amico S. Marx J.C. Gerday C. Feller G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7891-7896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 33Feller G. Gerday C. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 1: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 34Georlette D. Blaise V. Collins T. D'Amico S. Gratia E. Hoyoux A. Marx J.C. Sonan G. Feller G. Gerday C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2004; 28: 25-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In the case of PsPGK, the active site is formed by the interface of the N- and C-domains that have to move to bring the substrates in close proximity. Accordingly, the predominant weak stability of this enzyme can enhance the substrate-induced conformational changes (Figs. 6 and 7) and the resulting hinge-bending motions at low temperatures. It has also been suggested that during the course of evolution, some psychrophilic enzymes have reached a state close to the lowest stability compatible with the native state (17Feller G. d'Amico D. Gerday C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4613-4619Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 33Feller G. Gerday C. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 1: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 35D'Amico S. Gerday C. Feller G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25791-25796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This is supported here by the drastic effects of the single conservative mutations introduced in both N- and C-domains (Fig. 3), by the almost unfolded state of the double mutant (Fig. 3, inset) and by the lack of compact conformation of the structures forming the heat-labile DSC transition in the isolated domains (Figs. 4 and 5). As far as substrate binding is concerned, most psychrophilic enzymes have a reduced affinity arising from the active site mobility (33Feller G. Gerday C. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 1: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 36Xu Y. Feller G. Gerday C. Glansdorff N. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2161-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), whereas PsPGK has a better affinity for the nucleotide. One can therefore propose that the heat-stable domain of PsPGK provides a more compact and structured nucleotide binding site which, consequently, has a high affinity. This seems to be an elegant molecular adaptation allowing the optimization of both kcat and Km at low temperatures, not previously observed in other psychrophilic enzymes. We thank R. Marchand and A.
