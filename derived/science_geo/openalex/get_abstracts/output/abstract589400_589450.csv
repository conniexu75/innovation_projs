Yao et al. developed a catalyst composed of layered gold clusters on molybdenum carbide (MoC) nanoparticles to convert CO through its reaction with water into H 2 and CO 2 at temperatures as low as 150°C. Water was activated on MoC to form surface hydroxyl groups, which then reacted with CO adsorbed on the gold clusters. Science , this issue p. 389"

Song et al. synthesized rectangular arrays of double-stranded DNA (see the Perspective by Yang and Lin). Transient square configurations transform into two stable rectangular structures by pinching across a pair of opposing vertices. Binding of DNA trigger strands causes switching into the alternative stable configuration. The tiles thus create a cascade of transformations along a particular pathway, thereby transmitting information about where binding occurred. Science , this issue p. eaan3377 ; see also p. 352"
https://openalex.org/W2640197197,"At least 30 types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) send distinct messages through the optic nerve to the brain. Available strategies of promoting axon regeneration act on only some of these types. Here we tested the hypothesis that overexpressing developmentally important transcription factors in adult RGCs could reprogram them to a ""youthful"" growth-competent state and promote regeneration of other types. From a screen of transcription factors, we identified Sox11 as one that could induce substantial axon regeneration. Transcriptome profiling indicated that Sox11 activates genes involved in cytoskeletal remodeling and axon growth. Remarkably, α-RGCs, which preferentially regenerate following treatments such as Pten deletion, were killed by Sox11 overexpression. Thus, Sox11 promotes regeneration of non-α-RGCs, which are refractory to Pten deletion-induced regeneration. We conclude that Sox11 can reprogram adult RGCs to a growth-competent state, suggesting that different growth-promoting interventions promote regeneration in distinct neuronal types."

Nichols et al. studied this question using brain-wide Ca2 + imaging at single-neuron resolution in nematodes. By changing O 2 concentrations, they could rapidly switch the worms between behaviorally quiescent and active states. They observed a global quiescence brain state characterized by the systemic down-regulation of neuronal network dynamics. Signaling from O 2 sensory neurons rapidly evoked and maintained active network dynamics. Conversely, in the absence of such arousing cues, network dynamics converged into the quiescent mode.

Tourette syndrome (TS) is a model neuropsychiatric disorder thought to arise from abnormal development and/or maintenance of cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits. TS is highly heritable, but its underlying genetic causes are still elusive, and no genome-wide significant loci have been discovered to date. We analyzed a European ancestry sample of 2,434 TS cases and 4,093 ancestry-matched controls for rare (< 1% frequency) copy-number variants (CNVs) using SNP microarray data. We observed an enrichment of global CNV burden that was prominent for large (> 1 Mb), singleton events (OR = 2.28, 95% CI [1.39–3.79], p = 1.2 × 10−3) and known, pathogenic CNVs (OR = 3.03 [1.85–5.07], p = 1.5 × 10−5). We also identified two individual, genome-wide significant loci, each conferring a substantial increase in TS risk (NRXN1 deletions, OR = 20.3, 95% CI [2.6–156.2]; CNTN6 duplications, OR = 10.1, 95% CI [2.3–45.4]).

Approximately 1% of TS cases carry one of these CNVs, indicating that rare structural variation contributes significantly to the genetic architecture of TS. Tourette syndrome (TS) is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by multiple chronic involuntary motor and vocal tics, with an estimated population prevalence of 0.3%–0.9% (Scharf et al., 2015Scharf J.M. Miller L.L. Gauvin C.A. Alabiso J. Mathews C.A. Ben-Shlomo Y. Population prevalence of Tourette syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.Mov. Disord. 2015; 30: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Tics typically emerge during childhood and peak in adolescence, with a subsequent reduction in symptoms, supporting the notion that TS is neurodevelopmental in origin (Robertson et al., 2017Robertson M.M. Eapen V. Singer H.S. Martino D. Scharf J.M. Paschou P. Roessner V. Woods D.W. Hariz M. Mathews C.A. et al.Gilles de la Tourette syndrome.Nat Rev Dis Primers. 2017; 3: 16097Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Most TS patients (> 85%) present with additional neuropsychiatric comorbidities, typically attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (Hirschtritt et al., 2015Hirschtritt M.E.

Consequently, TS is often considered a model neuropsychiatric disorder in that identification of its underlying molecular, cellular, and neurophysiologic etiology may be broadly applicable to a wide range of psychiatric disorders.

Family studies indicate that children of affected parents have a 60-fold higher risk of developing TS or chronic tics (CT), a closely related disorder, compared to the general population (Browne et al., 2015Browne H.A. Hansen S.N. Buxbaum J.D. Gair S.L. Nissen J.B. Nikolajsen K.H. Schendel D.E. Reichenberg A. Parner E.T. Grice D.E. Familial clustering of tic disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder.JAMA Psychiatry. 2015; 72: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). TS heritability is estimated to be 0.77 (Mataix-Cols et al., 2015Mataix-Cols D. Isomura K. Pérez-Vigil A. Chang Z. Rück C. Larsson K.J. Leckman J.F. Serlachius E. Larsson H. Lichtenstein P.

A Population-Based Cohort Study.JAMA Psychiatry. 2015; 72: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), making it one of the most heritable complex neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite this strong genetic component, the identification of bona fide TS susceptibility genes has proven challenging. Although linkage analyses have identified several candidate regions, there is little consensus across studies, suggesting that, as with other neuropsychiatric disorders, TS is genetically complex and heterogeneous (Robertson et al., 2017Robertson M.M. Eapen V. Singer H.S. Martino D. Scharf J.M. Paschou P. Roessner V. Woods D.W. Hariz M. Mathews C.A. et al.Gilles de la Tourette syndrome.Nat Rev Dis Primers. 2017; 3: 16097Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Similarly, analyses of TS genetic architecture using aggregated SNP data demonstrate that TS is highly polygenic, with the majority of inherited TS risk distributed throughout the genome (Davis et al., 2013Davis L.K. Yu D. Keenan C.L. Gamazon E.R. Konkashbaev A.I. Derks E.M. Neale B.M. Yang J. Lee S.H. Evans P. et al.Partitioning the heritability of Tourette syndrome and obsessive compulsive disorder reveals differences in genetic architecture.PLoS Genet. 2013; 9: e1003864Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), though an initial genome-wide association study (GWAS) did not yield any genome-wide significant loci, likely due to small sample size (Scharf et al., 2013Scharf J.M.

Studies examining rare structural variation in individuals with TS have implicated several neurodevelopmental genes involved in neurite outgrowth and axonal migration. Rare chromosomal abnormalities affecting CNTNAP2 (Verkerk et al., 2003Verkerk A.J.M.H. Mathews C.A. Joosse M. Eussen B.H.J. Heutink P.

Because of evidence suggesting that rare CNVs may have a role in TS etiology (Fernandez et al., 2012Fernandez T.V. Sanders S.J. Yurkiewicz I.R. Ercan-Sencicek A.G. Kim Y.-S. Fishman D.O.

Sebat J. CNVs: harbingers of a rare variant revolution in psychiatric genetics.Cell. 2012; 148: 1223-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar), we assessed the impact of rare CNVs on TS disease risk in a large sample of 6,527 unrelated individuals of European ancestry. We demonstrate a global increase in the burden of large, rare CNVs in TS cases compared to controls driven primarily by large, singleton events, in particular large (> 1Mb) deletions, consistent with marked genetic heterogeneity. We also report the first two TS susceptibility loci that meet genome-wide significance: deletions in NRXN1 and duplications in CNTN6. Each confers a substantial increase in disease risk and together are present in 1% of TS cases. An overview of the sample selection, quality control, CNV detection, and data analysis performed in this study is presented in Figure 1 and described in detail in the STAR Methods. All TS cases and controls were recruited through the Tourette Syndrome Association International Consortium for Genetics (TSAICG) or through the Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome GWAS Replication Initiative (GGRI), with additional controls selected from external studies (STAR Methods). All DNA samples were genotyped on the Illumina OmniExpress SNP array platform (Table S1A). We restricted analysis to SNP assays common to all array versions. We conducted extensive quality-control analyses including both SNP-based and CNV-based exclusion of outliers (Table S1B; STAR Methods) and genotype-based determination of ancestry (Figure S1). The final dataset consisted of 6,527 unrelated European ancestry samples: 2,434 individuals diagnosed with TS and 4,093 unselected controls. Genome-wide detection of CNVs was performed using the consensus of two widely used Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based methods (STAR Methods). Additionally, we used a locus-specific, intensity-based clustering method to generate CNV genotypes in all samples across 11 common HapMap3 loci for sensitivity analysis (Figure S2; Table S2; STAR Methods). Using the proportion of concordant HMM-based calls at these loci as a sensitivity measure, we confirmed the absence of any bias in CNV detection between cases and controls across all loci (p = 0.54, Fisher’s Exact test) and between individuals (p = 0.15, Welch’s t test; see Table S3). Post-call cleaning was performed and CNVs were annotated for gene content and frequency (STAR Methods). CNVs were considered “genic” if they overlapped any exon of a known protein-coding RefSeq transcript. Frequencies were defined based on a 50% overlap with other CNVs as described elsewhere (CNV and Schizophrenia Working Groups of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2017CNV and Schizophrenia Working Groups of the Psychiatric Genomics ConsortiumPsychosis Endophenotypes International ConsortiumContribution of copy number variants to schizophrenia from a genome-wide study of 41,321 subjects.Nat. Genet. 2017; 49: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar); “singletons” denote CNVs with a frequency of one across the entire dataset. We filtered calls for rare (frequency < 1% or < 65 events) CNVs ≥ 30 kb in length and spanning at least ten probes. Finally, using a heuristically derived series of in silico validation metrics, we removed aberrant CNV calls due to mosaicism and misclassified rare events (Figure S3; STAR Methods). In total, we resolved 9,375 rare CNVs (Table S4). An increase in rare CNV burden has been consistently demonstrated in other NDDs (CNV and Schizophrenia Working Groups of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2017CNV and Schizophrenia Working Groups of the Psychiatric Genomics ConsortiumPsychosis Endophenotypes International ConsortiumContribution of copy number variants to schizophrenia from a genome-wide study of 41,321 subjects.Nat. Genet. 2017; 49: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Controlling for potential confounders, burden analysis was performed using logistic regression (STAR Methods) with three different burden metrics: (1) total number of CNVs (CNV count), (2) total genomic size of all CNVs (CNV length), and (3) number of genes affected (CNV gene count). For genic CNVs (n = 4,604), we observed modest but significant increases in burden across all metrics (Figure 2A): CNV count (OR 1.05 [1.01–1.10], p = 0.027), CNV gene count (OR 1.09 [1.01–1.17], p = 0.019), and CNV length (OR 1.15 [1.07–1.24], p = 1.9 × 10−4). By contrast, no enrichment was seen in a comparable number (n = 4,771) of non-genic events. The increased burden in TS was most significant for CNV length and consistent across each control set individually (Figure S4). To explore the CNV length burden further, we partitioned the data across a range of CNV size and frequency bins and observed the enrichment was mainly attributable to large (> 1 Mb; OR 1.26 [1.08–1.49], p = 5.3 × 10−3) (Figure 2B) and/or singleton CNVs (OR 1.13 [1.04–1.24], p = 2.9 × 10−3) (Figure 2C). We next explored whether specific CNV classes were enriched in TS. Since the elevated TS CNV burden was confined to large and/or very rare events, we re-evaluated the CNV count burden restricted to genic singletons, stratified by CNV size. We observed a significant enrichment of singletons > 500 kb (OR 1.43 [1.06–1.95], p = 0.020) that was further increased in the largest size category (> 1 Mb, OR 2.28 [1.39–3.79], p = 1.2 × 10−3). The enrichment of > 1 Mb genic CNVs was greater for deletions (OR 2.75 [1.28–6.29], p = 0.012) than duplications (OR 1.98 [1.04–3.83], p = 0.038) (Figure 3A). Notably, the enrichment of singleton deletions > 1 Mb was driven by CNVs spanning genes under strong evolutionary constraint (probability of loss-of-function intolerance [pLI] score > 0.9; Lek et al., 2016Lek M. Karczewski K.J. Minikel E.V. Samocha K.E. Banks E. Fennell T. O’Donnell-Luria A.H. Ware J.S. Hill A.J. Cummings B.B. et al.Analysis of protein-coding genetic variation in 60,706 humans.Nature. 2016; 536: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (6555) Google Scholar) (rate ratio = 2.65 [1.40–5.00], p = 2.7 × 10−3; Poisson regression; STAR Methods). It is well established that certain regions of the human genome are prone to rare, recurrent CNVs associated with a broad range of NDDs (Malhotra and Sebat, 2012Malhotra D. Sebat J. CNVs: harbingers of a rare variant revolution in psychiatric genetics.Cell. 2012; 148: 1223-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). To evaluate if such pathogenic CNVs confer risk for TS, we classified all rare CNV calls by clinical relevance according to American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) guidelines (Kearney et al., 2011Kearney H.M. Thorland E.C. Brown K.K. Quintero-Rivera F. South S.T. Working Group of the American College of Medical Genetics Laboratory Quality Assurance CommitteeAmerican College of Medical Genetics standards and guidelines for interpretation and reporting of postnatal constitutional copy number variants.Genet. Med. 2011; 13: 680-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar) and assessed for enrichment between cases and controls. Known pathogenic CNVs were identified in 1.9% of TS cases versus 0.8% of controls (OR 3.03 [1.85–5.07], p = 1.5 × 10−5) (Figure 3B). Consistent with an increased pathogenicity of deletions compared to duplications, this enrichment was greater for deletions alone (OR per CNV 3.94 [1.83–8.95], p = 6.3 × 10−4). By contrast, no increase in burden was observed among CNVs classified as either benign or of unknown clinical significance. To test our sample for enrichment of rare CNVs at individual loci, we conducted an unbiased, point-wise (segmental) genome-wide association test, treating deletions and duplications independently (STAR Methods). As non-overlapping CNVs affecting the same gene would be unaccounted for by segmental assessments of enrichment, we also conducted a complementary gene-based test, conditioned on CNVs affecting exons. In contrast to SNP-based GWAS, there is no established p value threshold to indicate genome-wide significance for CNVs, since the number of rare CNV breakpoints per genome varies across individuals and detection platforms. Therefore, for both tests, we established both locus-specific p values (Pseg and Pgene for segmental and gene-based tests, respectively) and genome-wide corrected p values (Pcorr) empirically through 1,000,000 label-swapping permutations, using the max(T) method (Westfall and Troendle, 2008Westfall P.H. Troendle J.F. Multiple testing with minimal assumptions.Biom. J. 2008; 50: 745-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar; STAR Methods) to control for family-wise error rate (FWER). Both tests converged on the same two loci, one for deletions and another for duplications, which were enriched among TS cases and survived genome-wide correction for multiple testing. For deletions, the peak segmental association signal was located on chromosome 2p16 (Pseg = 7.0 × 10−6; Pseg-corr = 1.0 × 10−3; Figure 4A), corresponding to heterozygous losses affecting the first coding exon of NRXN1, and found exclusively among TS cases (N = 10, Figure 4B). In the gene-based test of exonic CNVs, heterozygous NRXN1 deletions were also the most significant association genome-wide (Pgene = 5.9 × 10−5; Pgene-corr = 8.5 × 10−4), representing 12 cases (0.49%) and 1 control (0.02%), corresponding to a substantially increased TS risk (OR 20.3 [2.6–156.0]). Consistent with previously identified pathogenic NRXN1 deletions in other NDDs, these exon-spanning CNVs clustered at the 5′ end and predominantly affected the NRXN1-α isoform (Dabell et al., 2013Dabell M.P. Rosenfeld J.A. Bader P. Escobar L.F. El-Khechen D. Vallee S.E. Dinulos M.B.P. Curry C. Fisher J. Tervo R. et al.Investigation of NRXN1 deletions: clinical and molecular characterization.Am. J. Med. Genet. A. 2013; 161A: 717-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For duplications, the segmental association test identified one genome-wide significant locus on chromosome 3p26, within CNTN6 (Pseg = 5.4 × 10−5, Pseg-corr = 6.9 × 10−3), with a secondary peak located directly upstream (Pseg = 5.9 × 10−5, Pseg-corr = 6.9 × 10−3, Figures 4A and 4C). Closer inspection revealed an enrichment of large duplications spanning this gene. The gene-based test identified the same locus, exonic CNTN6 duplications, with heterozygous gains found in 12 cases (0.49%) and 2 controls (0.05%), corresponding to an OR = 10.1 (2.3–45.4) (Pgene = 2.5 × 10−4, Pgene-corr = 8.3 × 10−3). Notably, the CNTN6 duplications in TS cases were considerably larger than those in controls (641 versus 143 kb). Eight of 12 TS carriers harbored a duplication > 500 kb in length, while duplications in controls were < 200 kb. All genic CNV calls across NRXN1 and CNTN6 were verified by inspection of probe-level intensity plots (Figures S5 and S6). No additional loci were significant after controlling for FWER, under either segmental or gene-based tests of association, and we obtained similar results after pair-matching each case with its closest ancestrally matched control, suggesting that these results are not due to inter-European population stratification (Figure S7; STAR Methods). In this study, we demonstrate a significant role for rare structural variation in the pathogenesis of TS, a still poorly understood neurodevelopmental disorder. We observe an increased global burden of rare CNVs and report two definitive TS risk loci that surpass empirical thresholds for genome-wide significance, deletions in NRXN1 and duplications in CNTN6. NRXN1 is a highly studied, pre-synaptic cell-adhesion molecule involved in synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission at both glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses (Pak et al., 2015Pak C. Danko T. Zhang Y. Aoto J. Anderson G. Maxeiner S. Yi F. Wernig M. Südhof T.C. Human Neuropsychiatric Disease Modeling using Conditional Deletion Reveals Synaptic Transmission Defects Caused by Heterozygous Mutations in NRXN1.Cell Stem Cell. 2015; 17: 316-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). NRXN1 is primarily transcribed from two alternative promoters, resulting in a full-length NRXN1-α isoform and a shorter C-terminal NRXN1-β isoform (Ushkaryov et al., 1992Ushkaryov Y.A. Petrenko A.G. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Neurexins: synaptic cell surface proteins related to the alpha-latrotoxin receptor and laminin.Science. 1992; 257: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). NRXN1-α contains six alternative splice sites, which in combination generate hundreds of unique transcripts that segregate within specific brain regions and cell types (Fuccillo et al., 2015Fuccillo M.V.

NRXN1-α isoforms preferentially bind to various trans-synaptic partners, including neuroligins, cerebellins, neurexophilins, and leucine-rich repeat transmembrane proteins, each of which subserves different synaptic functions (de Wit and Ghosh, 2016de Wit J. Ghosh A. Specification of synaptic connectivity by cell surface interactions.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17: 22-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). NRXN1-α trans-synaptic interactions play a critical role in thalamo-cortical synaptogenesis and plasticity (Singh et al., 2016Singh S.K. Stogsdill J.A. Pulimood N.S. Dingsdale H. Kim Y.H. Pilaz L.-J.

Tourette syndrome is associated with recurrent exonic copy number variants.Neurology. 2010; 74: 1583-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), small sample sizes precluded a definitive association of this gene with TS. We demonstrate, in a large independent sample, that exonic NRXN1 deletions confer a substantial increase in TS risk. The association of heterozygous NRXN1 deletions with different NDDs is one of the most reliable findings in the neuropsychiatry CNV literature (Dabell et al., 2013Dabell M.P. Rosenfeld J.A. Bader P. Escobar L.F. El-Khechen D. Vallee S.E. Dinulos M.B.P. Curry C. Fisher J. Tervo R. et al.Investigation of NRXN1 deletions: clinical and molecular characterization.Am. J. Med. Genet. A. 2013; 161A: 717-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, 4 of the 12 TS cases with exonic NRXN1 deletions in our sample had another broadly defined NDD (2 ASD, 1 developmental delay, 1 developmental speech/language disorder unspecified) (Table S5), supporting the hypothesis that these deletions may interfere with a generalized neurodevelopmental process that, when combined with other disease-specific mutations and/or background polygenic risk, results in the observed phenotypic pleiotropy. Like NRXN1, CNTN6 encodes a cell-adhesion molecule expressed primarily in the CNS (Ogawa et al., 1996Ogawa J. Kaneko H. Masuda T. Nagata S. Hosoya H. Watanabe K.

Contactins are members of the L1 immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins, and Cntn6 serves multiple functions in the developing mouse nervous system, including orientation of apical dendrites in cortical pyramidal neurons, regulation of Purkinje cell development and synaptogenesis, and oligodendrocyte differentiation from neuroprogenitor cells (Oguro-Ando et al., 2017Oguro-Ando A.

https://openalex.org/W2699457337,"Animals rely on dedicated sensory circuits to extract and encode environmental features. How individual neurons integrate and translate these features into behavioral responses remains a major question. Here, we identify a visual projection neuron type that conveys predator approach information to the Drosophila giant fiber (GF) escape circuit. Genetic removal of this input during looming stimuli reveals that it encodes angular expansion velocity, whereas other input cell type(s) encode angular size. Motor program selection and timing emerge from linear integration of these two features within the GF. Linear integration improves size detection invariance over prior models and appropriately biases motor selection to rapid, GF-mediated escapes during fast looms. Our findings suggest feature integration, and motor control may occur as simultaneous operations within the same neuron and establish the Drosophila escape circuit as a model system in which these computations may be further dissected at the circuit level.

https://openalex.org/W2632293652,"Dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) has been implicated in cell death signaling secondary to axonal damage in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and other neurons. To better understand the pathway through which DLK acts, we developed enhanced functional genomic screens in primary RGCs, including use of arrayed, whole-genome, small interfering RNA libraries. Explaining why DLK inhibition is only partially protective, we identify leucine zipper kinase (LZK) as cooperating with DLK to activate downstream signaling and cell death in RGCs, including in a mouse model of optic nerve injury, and show that the same pathway is active in human stem cell-derived RGCs. Moreover, we identify four transcription factors, JUN, activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2), myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A), and SRY-Box 11 (SOX11), as being the major downstream mediators through which DLK/LZK activation leads to RGC cell death. Increased understanding of the DLK pathway has implications for understanding and treating neurodegenerative diseases."

The mechanisms for selective single-cell firing during sharp-wave ripples, and those that govern memory degradation in pathological conditions remain to be clarified. In temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), a disease affecting hippocampal and parahippocampal microcircuits, fast ripples (250–600 Hz) have been associated with both interictal discharges and sharp-wave-like events (Bragin et al., 1999Bragin A. Engel Jr., J. Wilson C.L. Fried I. Mathern G.W.

Pathological fast ripples are a clinically useful biomarker in epilepsy, but their effects on cognition are not clear (Kucewicz et al., 2014Kucewicz M.T. Cimbalnik J. Matsumoto J.Y. Brinkmann B.H. Bower M.R. Vasoli V. Sulc V. Meyer F. Marsh W.R. Stead S.M. Worrell G.A. High frequency oscillations are associated with cognitive processing in human recognition memory.Brain. 2014; 137: 2231-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Given difficulties in identifying ripples associated to hippocampal sharp waves in clinical settings (Staba et al., 2002Staba R.J. Wilson C.L. Bragin A. Fried I. Engel Jr., J. Quantitative analysis of high-frequency oscillations (80-500 Hz) recorded in human epileptic hippocampus and entorhinal cortex.J.

Conundrums of high-frequency oscillations (80-800 Hz) in the epileptic brain.J. Clin. Neurophysiol. 2015; 32: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), addressing this question in humans is challenging. Here, we took advantage of a rat model of TLE exhibiting distortion of sharp-wave ripples and different memory abilities to pursue the mechanisms for firing selectivity. We found that the spectral properties of sharp-wave ripples were correlated with increased neuronal firing and loss of selectivity typical of the epileptic hippocampus. Using unsupervised clustering of sharp-wave ripples (Reichinnek et al., 2010Reichinnek S. Künsting T. Draguhn A. Both M. Field potential signature of distinct multicellular activity patterns in the mouse hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 15441-15449Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, Taxidis et al., 2015Taxidis J. Anastassiou C.A. Diba K. Koch C. Local field potentials encode place cell ensemble activation during hippocampal sharp wave ripples.Neuron. 2015; 87: 590-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we disclosed a synaptic mechanism that can be used to perturb firing selectivity at the single-cell and microcircuit level. Our results demonstrate how global and cell-specific network activity are critical for hippocampal memory function. We first asked whether sharp-wave-associated ripples could be separated from interictal epileptiform events in chronically epileptic rats. In normal rats, physiological ripples (100–250 Hz) emerge in the CA1 region during immobility and slow-wave sleep. Thus, we implanted 16-channel silicon probes in the dorsal hippocampus of normal and epileptic behaving animals. Rats performed either the episodic-like “what-where-when” memory task (EP task; n = 4 control, n = 4 epileptic) or a one-trial object recognition task (OR task; n = 3 control, n = 3 epileptic; Figure 1A) (Inostroza et al., 2013Inostroza M. Brotons-Mas J.R. Laurent F. Cid E. de la Prida L.M. Specific impairment of “what-where-when” episodic-like memory in experimental models of temporal lobe epilepsy.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 17749-17762Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). LFP signals were acquired along CA1 layers (Figure 1B). In normal rats (n = 7), characteristic sharp-wave ripples occurred during awake immobility and slow-wave sleep in periods between trials at a rate of 0.55 ± 0.18 events/s (Figure 1C, left). Sharp-wave amplitude was maximal in the stratum radiatum (1.03 ± 0.24 mV) and associated with ripples at the stratum pyramidale. Time-frequency spectra revealed that ripples contributed consistently to the 100–250 Hz band (Figure 1C). Sharp-wave-associated gamma oscillations were identified in some events (Sullivan et al., 2011Sullivan D. Csicsvari J. Mizuseki K. Montgomery S. Diba K. Buzsáki G. Relationships between hippocampal sharp waves, ripples, and fast gamma oscillation: influence of dentate and entorhinal cortical activity.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 8605-8616Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), but we focused on the ripple band given its relevance for the epileptic condition (Bragin et al., 1999Bragin A. Engel Jr., J. Wilson C.L. Fried I. Mathern G.W. Hippocampal and entorhinal cortex high-frequency oscillations (100--500 Hz) in human epileptic brain and in kainic acid--treated rats with chronic seizures.Epilepsia. 1999; 40: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, Alvarado-Rojas et al., 2015Alvarado-Rojas C. Huberfeld G. Baulac M. Clemenceau S. Charpier S. Miles R. de la Prida L.M. Le Van Quyen M. Different mechanisms of ripple-like oscillations in the human epileptic subiculum.Ann. Neurol. 2015; 77: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Similar events were recorded in epileptic rats between trials but their spectral components were remarkably variable (Figure 1C, right). In the stratum radiatum, sharp-wave amplitude (0.82 ± 0.20 mV, n = 7; p = 0.18; Student’s t test) and rate (0.37 ± 0.16 events/s, p = 0.19) were similar to records from control rats. They clearly differed from interictal discharges with larger, saturating amplitude fluctuations (Figure S1A). We thus excluded sessions with interictal or ictal events for further analysis. Are ripples recorded in normal and epileptic rats spectrally different? We defined two indices to characterize individual events. The fast ripple index was the proportion of the 100–600 Hz power spectrum above a frequency cutoff, usually 250 Hz. Ripple entropy was a measure of spectral disorganization in the 100–600 Hz band (see STAR Methods). The larger the entropy, the more disorganized the spectra; the larger the fast ripple index, the stronger the ripple contribution to the fast frequency band. Events from normal and epileptic rats could be separated statistically for cutoff thresholds of 180–350 Hz (Figure 1D for 250 Hz; Figures S1B–S1D). Overall, ripples in epileptic rats exhibited higher entropy (p = 0.017), fast ripple index (p = 0.015), and frequency (p = 0.018; Figure 1E). How do sharp-wave ripples in epileptic rats relate to their memory performance? Previously, we showed that epileptic rats failed in their ability to discriminate old and recently displaced and non-displaced objects in the “what-where-when” task (objects A1 and B2 in the EP task, Figure 1A; Inostroza et al., 2013Inostroza M. Brotons-Mas J.R. Laurent F. Cid E. de la Prida L.M. Specific impairment of “what-where-when” episodic-like memory in experimental models of temporal lobe epilepsy.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 17749-17762Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We confirmed a similar trend in the subset of animals used for this study (Figure 1F; effect for group F(1,10) = 15.14, p = 0.002, but not for objects nor interaction, two-way ANOVA). Importantly, we found strong correlation between spectral indices of sharp-wave ripples recorded during the inter-trial and the discrimination ratio for object A1 and B2 for both groups together (Figure 1G for the fast ripple index; for entropy: R = −0.73, p = 0.0013; frequency: R = −0.68, p = 0.003).

In the current dataset, we found an association between the fast ripple index of offline events and the mean inter-layer coherence of theta oscillations recorded in the exploratory phases of the task (R = −0.87; p = 0.004; Laurent et al., 2015Laurent F. Brotons-Mas J.R. Cid E. Lopez-Pigozzi D. Valero M. Gal B. de la Prida L.M. Proximodistal structure of theta coordination in the dorsal hippocampus of epileptic rats.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 4760-4775Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To dissect the contribution of different physiological indices, we used a generalized linear model (GLM). This analysis models the discrimination index as a combination of independent effects of (1) ripple spectral indices (Ibarz et al., 2010Ibarz J.M. Foffani G. Cid E. Inostroza M. Menendez de la Prida L. Emergent dynamics of fast ripples in the epileptic hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 16249-16261Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), (2) theta power at the stratum lacunosum-moleculare (Inostroza et al., 2013Inostroza M. Brotons-Mas J.R. Laurent F.

Neurosci. 2013; 33: 17749-17762Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), (3) coherence with molecular layers (Laurent et al., 2015Laurent F. Brotons-Mas J.R. Cid E. Lopez-Pigozzi D. Valero M. Gal B. de la Prida L.M. Proximodistal structure of theta coordination in the dorsal hippocampus of epileptic rats.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 4760-4775Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and (4) interaction between theta and gamma (30–60 Hz) at the stratum radiatum (Lopez-Pigozzi et al., 2016Lopez-Pigozzi D. Laurent F. Brotons-Mas J.R. Valderrama M. Valero M. Fernandez-Lamo I. Cid E. Gomez-Dominguez D. Gal B. Menendez de la Prida L. Altered oscillatory dynamics of CA1 parvalbumin basket cells during theta-gamma rhythmopathies of temporal lobe epilepsy.eNeuro. 2016; 3: 3Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We found that the fast ripple index explained most of the variance of discrimination for both objects A1 and B2 at a significance level of p < 0.05 (Figure 1H). Thus, excluding covariation, ripple spectral dynamics is directly correlated with discrimination ability, suggesting some direct effect on consolidation processes. To test this point further, we evaluated ripple effects by using one-trial object recognition tasks at 50 min and 100 min intervals (OR task) in an independent cohort of animals (n = 7 control, n = 9 epileptic, Figure 1A). Differences of exploration between objects would suggest interferences between novelty and familiarity that when tested allocentrically and with long delays depend on the hippocampus (Barker and Warburton, 2011Barker G.R.I. Warburton E.C. When is the hippocampus involved in recognition memory?.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 10721-10731Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). We found that epileptic rats performed similar to controls at 50 min but less well at 100 min inter-trial interval (Figure 1I; F(1,12) = 4.32, p = 0.047 for groups; no effect for interval; interaction p = 0.068; two-way ANOVA). The temporal trend for control rats was compatible with successful recall after sleep typical of 100 min interval (p = 0.021; Binder et al., 2012Binder S. Baier P.C. Mölle M. Inostroza M. Born J. Marshall L. Sleep enhances memory consolidation in the hippocampus-dependent object-place recognition task in rats.Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 2012; 97: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Epileptic rats failed to show such a trend (Figure 1I) and differences between groups became more pronounced at longer intervals (p = 0.011). These data suggest similar abilities between groups for encoding and retrieval for short retention intervals and a failure of epileptic rats in memory consolidation at long intervals of 100 min. Spectral indices of sharp-wave ripples were similar for events recorded in sleep and during immobility (Figure S1E). We asked whether sleep pattern could contribute but found no difference between epileptic and control animals of either the sleep stages or the duration of REM episodes (control: 22–164 s; epileptic: 43–147 s). Instead, only the discrimination index in the 100 min interval OR task correlated with the fast ripple index (Figure 1J). These data therefore suggest that spectrally disorganized sharp-wave ripples during immobility and sleep may impair memory function. Do differences in ripple spectra reflect some specific cellular process of memory consolidation? We looked for cellular determinants of ripple spectral features in juxtacellular recordings of CA1 pyramidal cells from freely moving rats (Figure 2A). Sharp-wave ripple events recorded with glass pipettes exhibited similar spectral features to those obtained with silicon probes (Figures S2A and S2B). Pyramidal cells from normal rats generally fired 1–3 spikes at the trough of spontaneous ripples recorded with the glass pipette and were identified by their characteristic autocorrelogram (Figure 2B; n = 14 cells; n = 8 histologically confirmed). In contrast, cells recorded from epileptic rats were more typically active (3–6 spikes; Figure 2C; n = 7 cells, 4 histologically confirmed) and their firing was less coherent with LFP than in control cells (Figure S2C; Foffani et al., 2007Foffani G. Uzcategui Y.G. Gal B. Menendez de la Prida L. Reduced spike-timing reliability correlates with the emergence of fast ripples in the rat epileptic hippocampus.Neuron. 2007; 55: 930-941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Un-identified putative pyramidal cells exhibited similar action potential features and autocorrelation than histologically validated cells. Previously, we described a bias of CA1 neuronal firing and participation during physiological sharp-wave ripples along the deep-superficial sub-layers (Valero et al., 2015Valero M. Cid E. Averkin R.G. Aguilar J. Sanchez-Aguilera A. Viney T.J. Gomez-Dominguez D. Bellistri E. de la Prida L.M. Determinants of different deep and superficial CA1 pyramidal cell dynamics during sharp-wave ripples.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 1281-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We considered histological information to predict the position of un-identified cells with respect to the border with the stratum radiatum (Figures S2D–S2G; STAR Methods). Firing from control cells exhibited the bias that we described before, with superficial cells firing more and more consistently during sharp-wave ripples (Figure 2D, left). In contrast, in epileptic rats the deep-superficial trend was impaired (Figure 2D, right; Figure S2H). Overall, the group effect dominated differences of single-cell firing rate (F(1,17) = 29.99, p < 0.0001) and participation during sharp-wave ripples (F(1,17) = 10.19, p = 0.005; Figure S2I) (no deep-superficial effect nor interaction, two-way ANOVA). Next, we looked for the cellular correlates of ripple features by comparing single-cell firing and the spectral indices of nearby field events. We found a steep correlation between the fast ripple index and the firing rate of single cells (Figure 2E; Figures S3A and S3B). This single-cell/ripple correlation was also evident in n = 3 cells recorded together with an additional tungsten wire at a distance of 150–400 μm (Figures S3C and S3D; see STAR Methods), suggesting that it reflected collective behavior of neighboring neurons. Single-cell participation was higher for sharp-wave ripples with faster spectral components, especially in epileptic rats (Figure 2F). In information theory, the probability of participation P is related to the information content as –log(P). Thus, higher participation resulted in less information content of single cells during sharp-wave ripples in epileptic rats (Figure 2F, right). Altogether, these results suggest that extracellular ripple features are good proxy for microcircuit firing dynamics. When sharp-wave ripple frequency spectrum is most disorganized, single-cell firing is least selective. Cells that participate indiscriminately in more events have the least information content. In normal animals, this may occur exceptionally while in epileptic rats is rather the norm (see events indicated in Figure 1D for instance). These data provide further evidence that cognitive behavior and sharp-wave ripple spectral content are linked, possibly through common cellular or synaptic processes involved in memory consolidation. How can single cells fire selectively during some events? A major role of sharp-wave ripples is reactivation of single cells with specific neuronal ensembles. Presumably, different ensembles consist of unique groups of neurons, which may generate specific LFP events (Bazelot et al., 2016Bazelot M. Teleńczuk M.T. Miles R. Single CA3 pyramidal cells trigger sharp waves in vitro by exciting interneurones.J. Physiol. 2016; 594: 2565-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In order to capture this specificity, we made an unsupervised classification of different sharp-wave ripple fields to test firing selectivity of pyramidal cells recorded juxtacellularly. All ripple events recorded in a given session were grouped into self-organizing maps (SOMs) according to their topological similarities in a multi-dimensional parameter space (Kohonen, 2001Kohonen T.

The present study evaluated the risk of depression after hearing impairment in all age groups matched by age, sex, income, and region of residence.The Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service-National Patient Samples were collected for a period from 2002 to 2013. Hearing impairment was defined as a hearing threshold ≥ 60 dB in both ears or as ≥ 80 dB in one ear and ≥ 40 dB in one ear. Hearing-impaired participants performed a pure tone audiometry test 3 times and an auditory brainstem response threshold test once. The 6,136 hearing-impaired participants were matched 1:4 with 24,544 controls with no reported hearing impairment for age, sex, income, and region of residence. Depression was investigated based on the International Classification of Disease-10 codes F31 (bipolar affective disorder) through F39 (unspecified mood disorder) by a psychiatrist from 2002 through 2013. The crude (simple) and adjusted (age, sex, income, region of residence, dementia, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia) hazard ratio (HR) of hearing impairment on depression were analyzed using Cox-proportional hazard model.The rate of depression was significantly higher in the severe hearing-impaired group than in the control group (7.9% vs. 5.7%, P < 0.001). Severe hearing impairment increased the risk of depression (adjusted HR = 1.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.24-1.52, P < 0.001). In a subgroup analysis, young (0-29 years old), middle-aged (30-59 years old), and old (≥ 60 years old) severe hearing-impaired groups showed significantly increased risk of depression compared to controls with no reported hearing impairment. In accordance with income level, severe hearing impairment elevated depression in the low and high income groups, but not in the middle income group.Severe hearing impairment increased the risk of depression independently of age, sex, region, past medical histories, and income (in low and high income persons but not in middle income persons)."
https://openalex.org/W2630280812,"Neuroligins and neurexins promote synapse development and validation by forming trans-synaptic bridges spanning the synaptic cleft. Select pairs promote excitatory and inhibitory synapses, with neuroligin 2 (NLGN2) limited to inhibitory synapses and neuroligin 1 (NLGN1) dominating at excitatory synapses. The cell-surface molecules, MAM domain-containing glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor 1 (MDGA1) and 2 (MDGA2), regulate trans-synaptic adhesion between neurexins and neuroligins, impacting NLGN2 and NLGN1, respectively. We have determined the molecular mechanism of MDGA action. MDGA1 Ig1-Ig2 is sufficient to bind NLGN2 with nanomolar affinity; its crystal structure reveals an unusual locked rod-shaped array. In the crystal structure of the complex, two MDGA1 Ig1-Ig2 molecules each span the entire NLGN2 dimer. Site-directed mutagenesis confirms the observed interaction interface. Strikingly, Ig1 from MDGA1 binds to the same region on NLGN2 as neurexins do. Thus, MDGAs regulate the formation of neuroligin-neurexin trans-synaptic bridges by sterically blocking access of neurexins to neuroligins."
https://openalex.org/W2706782906,"Membrane-associated mucin domain-containing glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor proteins (MDGAs) bind directly to neuroligin-1 (NL1) and neuroligin-2 (NL2), thereby respectively regulating excitatory and inhibitory synapse development. However, the mechanisms by which MDGAs modulate NL activity to specify development of the two synapse types remain unclear. Here, we determined the crystal structures of human NL2/MDGA1 Ig1-3 complex, revealing their stable 2:2 arrangement with three interaction interfaces. Cell-based assays using structure-guided, site-directed MDGA1 mutants showed that all three contact patches were required for the MDGA’s negative regulation of NL2-mediated synaptogenic activity. Furthermore, MDGA1 competed with neurexins for NL2 via its Ig1 domain. The binding affinities of both MDGA1 and MDGA2 for NL1 and NL2 were similar, consistent with the structural prediction of similar binding interfaces. However, MDGA1 selectively associated with NL2, but not NL1, in vivo. These findings collectively provide structural insights into the mechanism by which MDGAs negatively modulate synapse development governed by NLs/neurexins."

The objective is to evaluate the impact of NSAIDs at their environmental concentrations on microbial community assembly and activity. The exposure experiments were conducted under three conditions (5 μg L-1 DCF, 5 μg L-1 DCF+5 μg L-1 IBP and 5 μg L-1 DCF+5 μg L-1 IBP+ 5 μg L-1 NPX) in sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) for 130 days. Removals of COD and NH4+-N were not affected but total nitrogen (TN) removal decreased. IBP and NPX had the high removal efficiencies (79.96% to 85.64%), whereas DCF was more persistent (57.24% to 64.12%). In addition, the decreased removals of TN remained the same under the three conditions (p > 0.05). The results of oxidizing enzyme activities, live cell percentages and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) indicated that NSAIDs damaged the cell walls or microorganisms and the mixtures of the three NSAIDs increased the toxicity. The increased Shannon-Wiener diversity index suggested that bacterial diversity was increased with the addition of selected NSAIDs. Bacterial ribosomal RNA small subunit (16S) gene sequencing results indicated that Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were enriched, while Micropruina and Nakamurella decreased with the addition of NSAIDs. The enrichment of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes indicated that both of them might have the ability to degrade NSAIDs and thereby could adapt well with the presence of NSAIDs."

We confirmed in this study that, in accordance with the decrease of H-type vessels, the proangiogenic potential of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) declined during osteoporosis. Screening of the histone acetyltransferase family revealed that GCN5 decreased in BMSCs derived from osteoporotic femur. Further analysis identified that GCN5 plays important roles in regulating the proangiogenic potential of BMSCs. GCN5 promoted BMSC-mediated angiogenesis by enhancing H3K9ac levels on the promoter of Vegf. The decrease of GCN5 in osteoporotic BMSCs led to the decline of proangiogenic capacity. Accordingly, overexpression of GCN5 enhanced the proangiogenic potency of osteoporotic BMSCs. Furthermore, recovering GCN5 expression in vivo by lentiviral expression vector significantly attenuated the loss of angiogenesis in ovariectomized mouse femurs.

Importantly, presynaptic expression of stabilized β-catenin in either layer (L) 4 excitatory neurons or L2/3 pyramidal neurons significantly upregulated excitatory synaptic transmission and dendritic spine density in L2/3 pyramidal neurons, while its sparse postsynaptic expression in L2/3 neurons had no such effects. In addition, presynaptic β-catenin expression enhanced release probability of glutamatergic synapses. Newly identified β-catenin-interacting protein p140Cap is required in the presynaptic locus for mediating these effects.

Baculovirus however is capable of carrying large exogenous DNA fragments. Here we investigate the use of baculoviral vectors as a delivery vehicle for CRISPR/Cas9 based genome-editing tools. We demonstrate transduction of a panel of cell lines with Cas9 and an sgRNA sequence, which results in efficient knockout of all four targeted subunits of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC). We further show that introduction of a homology directed repair template into the same CRISPR/Cas9 baculovirus facilitates introduction of specific point mutations and endogenous gene tags.

Few items grab the public's attention like sports, from extremes of great victory to injury and defeat. No injury currently arouses stronger interest than concussion. Giza et al., discuss how neuroscience can provide balance between physical activity and TBI, and guide thoughtful discourse and policy. Headers in soccer, helmet-to-helmet hits in American football, fighting in ice hockey, intense combat in mixed martial arts—these potential mechanisms of brain injury are played out daily in sports and recreational activities all over the world. Traumatic brain injury (TBI), not long ago called the “silent epidemic,” is increasingly in the public eye, playing in venues from local youth sports events to professional sports world championships to governmental hearings. The World Health Organization and others report that TBI is becoming one of the top global causes of acquired disability and represents a major public health issue. While impairments due to concussion or mild TBI are often not readily visible to an outside observer, the sheer number of those affected (80%–90% of all TBI are mTBI or concussion) as well as the vast number of individuals, including children, potentially exposed to repeated head impacts (over 250 million participants worldwide in soccer alone) warrant the increasing attention being brought to this arena. Here we will discuss how the medical concern over head injuries intersects with the world of neuroscience research. The field of sports neurotrauma has been hampered by qualitative definitions, oversimplification of injury and outcomes, pre-existing bias among stakeholders, and a reliance on retrospective observational studies. Nonetheless, innovative new technologies, when rigorously coupled with clinical correlates and biological mechanisms, offer tremendous opportunity for future advances. Bringing more rigorous experimental designs that include proper controls and prospective longitudinal follow-up, and incorporating preclinical translational studies, will more definitively prove or disprove our prior suppositions and lead to better, fact-based practice guidelines. Traumatic brain injury starts as biomechanical force transmitted to a soft, rubbery, wrinkled organ that constitutes 2% of the body’s weight and hogs 20% of the body’s energy. These forces disrupt cell membranes and damage intracellular scaffolding, releasing ionic floods and indiscriminate waves of neurotransmitters and triggering a cellular energy crisis. Axons undulate, synapses retract, and the cerebral internet disconnects, at least temporarily. Blood vessels become leaky and inflammation sets in (Giza and Hovda, 2014Giza C.C. Hovda D.A. Neurosurgery. 2014; 75: S24-S33Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Concurrently, cellular metabolism kicks into overdrive to help restore homeostasis, followed by a period of diminished neural activity and cerebral blood flow. It is likely that our brains evolved in settings where mild TBI (mTBI)/concussion events are quite common, and accordingly, various biological mechanisms work to restore things to normalcy after such injuries, although it may take hours, days, or even weeks for complete biological recovery. Furthermore, in the setting of greater injury severity, and quite likely also in settings of closely spaced repeated mTBI, biological homeostatic mechanisms may falter, resulting in more persistent functional impairments, lasting changes in connectivity, and even cell death (Prins et al., 2013Prins M.L. Alexander D. Giza C.C. Hovda D.A. J. Neurotrauma. 2013; 30: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). While reporting the neurobiology of concussion can seem rather dry, reporting bad behavior, violence, and death are riveting to the public’s attention. In this increasingly shrill environment, how then do scientists and clinicians weigh in on the dialog about TBI and sports? To uncover the truth, one must first step back from any dogma, anecdote, intuition, or opinion. Four major areas of the sports concussion problem that would benefit enormously from the objective application of scientific principles include the following: (1) definition and distinctions of acute and chronic syndromes, (2) improved diagnostics, (3) evidence-based intervention and treatment, and (4) better delineating the beneficial biological effects of activity and sports participation. Not every acute blow to the head is a concussion. Diffuse cerebral edema with or without intracranial hemorrhage, sometimes termed “second impact syndrome,” is a neurological catastrophe that has high mortality and morbidity. In 2006, Zackery Lystedt, a high school football player in Washington state, took a hit not unlike hundreds of player-to-player collisions that occur in contact sports every day. But after this, he experienced severe brain swelling that required neurosurgery and neurocritical care. His story and others have been motivating forces to the 50 state concussion laws in the U.S., starting with the Lystedt Law in Washington in 2009. These laws generally require (1) concussion/TBI education, (2) removal from play of athletes suspected of concussion/TBI, and (3) evaluation by a trained medical provider prior to return to sport. Similar legal and regulatory steps have started to spread internationally, with the recent passage of Rowan’s Law in Canada and efforts to increase sports TBI education in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The terms mild, moderate, and severe TBI have historically been based on the Glasgow Coma Score. So in this nomenclature, mTBI refers to the mild end of the TBI spectrum, which may include concussion but may also include small intracranial hematomas or skull fractures. Concussion is a syndrome of neurological and pathophysiological dysfunction induced by biomechanical force. Symptoms are typically maximal early on and improve over time, a clinical characteristic mostly overlooked in the media. While mTBI and concussion are often used synonymously, concussion may be considered a clinical syndrome included in the category of mTBI. The term subconcussion is currently used to represent a presumably asymptomatic injury that occurs with repeated impacts but may have cumulative consequences. Its existence is supported by studies using highly sensitive advanced imaging, biochemical, or electrophysiological techniques showing evidence of microstructural, molecular, or functional changes in individuals exposed to repeated impacts but without a clinical diagnosis of concussion. In the media and the medical literature, this terminology is often confused. The clinical neurosciences must not only better define these acute syndromes, but then must carefully distinguish them when relaying information to peers and to the public. While it may seem beneficial to one’s concussion grant to lump in numbers of thousands of annual severe TBI deaths, this only serves to obfuscate the real and important distinctions between different types and severity of TBI. These distinctions are almost certainly important for pathobiology, treatment, and outcome, so studies not taking this into consideration will continue to struggle to find meaningful effects and interventions that can successfully translate to improved human outcomes. Just as not every acute head impact results in a concussion, not every post-concussion symptom is a sign of dementia. For the vast majority of individuals experiencing a concussion, symptoms improve with time. In clinical studies, many of the risk factors for prolonged symptoms are related to comorbid conditions, like migraine, anxiety, depression, prior mTBI, or learning disabilities. Repetitive mTBI with a short impact interval is associated with more pronounced acute physiological changes in both animal models and human studies (Prins et al., 2013Prins M.L. Alexander D. Giza C.C. Hovda D.A. J. Neurotrauma. 2013; 30: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, Vagnozzi et al., 2008Vagnozzi R. Signoretti S. Tavazzi B. Floris R. Ludovici A. Marziali S. Tarascio G. Amorini A.M. Di Pietro V. Delfini R. Lazzarino G. Neurosurgery. 2008; 62: 1286-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). It is reasonably postulated that repetitive impacts with incomplete recovery could set the stage for chronic degenerative changes; however, the lay press is far ahead of the actual science here, where plausible mechanistic hypotheses remain to be proven or refuted. Clinical studies in cohorts of professional athletes have uncovered chronic neurocognitive impairment as measured by objective neuropsychological testing, and this impairment appears consistently related to the amount of impact exposure, suggesting a causal relationship. However, none of these clinical studies are longitudinal, and none have resulted in pathological or radiographic confirmation of neurodegeneration. As if that weren’t complicated enough, more severe TBI in general is recognized as a likely environmental risk factor for some dementias, including associations with Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s, and possibly CTE. Again, both basic and clinical neurosciences can lead the way to a clearer understanding of the sequelae of mild TBI or concussion by first better defining the outcomes, which then naturally lead to better understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying these outcomes. Only then can we proceed to develop sensible interventions to improve long-term consequences. If repetitive impacts result in metabolic vulnerability, then interventions can range from affecting the timing of return to contact risk, monitoring specific biological parameters, to more accurately delineate recovery or even providing alternative metabolic substrates or activating affected neurotransmitter systems to accelerate or enhance physiological recovery. Without better definitions, better diagnostics are not possible. However, with improved definitions, there are diagnostic elements where a science-based approach has great potential. Given the subjective nature of a concussion diagnosis and the range of clinical syndromes that can result after mTBI or concussion, it is clear that a single diagnostic is not likely to determine whether any brain injury occurred. It is important therefore to keep a broader perspective with emphasis on a diversity of diagnostic approaches. It’s also imperative to rigorously test new tasks or devices for validity and reliability. Rushing technology to the mass market may be an effective business model, but in the world of concussion and TBI, inadequately tested declarations of efficacy can also cause harm and slow progress. Blood/fluid biomarkers are of great interest to deliver an objective measure for diagnosis of mTBI, in a setting where our most sensitive tools are inherently subjective symptom checklists, with their specificity dropping rapidly over time. Fluid-based biomarkers are already seeing some utility in acute care settings to determine individuals for whom diagnostic neuroimaging should be performed. One clinical scenario where these advances would be immediately applicable include improving on clinical decision rules for imaging mTBI in the emergency department to better identify and care for patients with intracranial lesions that affect medical care. Another would be in the setting of abusive head trauma in infants, where the presentation is often with nonspecific symptoms and an unclear medical history, but the consequences of missing the diagnosis can be severe. A myriad of impact sensors are being marketed directly to parents, athletes, and even school districts. While an attractive idea, reams of existing data already demonstrate that there is no easily delineated “concussion threshold,” and thus the idea of a stop/go signaling device for general use in contact sports is not supported by science (Guskiewicz and Mihalik, 2011Guskiewicz K.M.

Now, despite the inability of a biomechanical sensor to trigger a stop/go decision, one huge advantage of biomechanical sensors is that they obtain objective, quantifiable data. And while the impacts they record don’t often result in clinical signs and symptoms, impact sensors remain a very powerful tool for researchers. Validated impact sensors should be able to objectively quantify forces regardless of whether they generate reportable symptoms. These devices can, over time and in properly designed studies, help determine whether a particular pattern or location or timing of impacts is more likely to result in a clinical concussion. More importantly, such devices might inform us as to the risk of short- or longer-term sequelae from concussive impacts. A final consideration is that there is great need for sensors that may be used in non-helmeted sports, including mouthguards, retainers, or earpieces. Most athletes, particularly female athletes, participate in sports not requiring helmets. At the same time, there is growing awareness that females are at increased risk of concussion or mTBI (O’Connor et al., 2017O’Connor K.L. Baker M.M. Dalton S.L. Dompier T.P. Broglio S.P. Kerr Z.Y. J. Athl. Train. 2017; 52: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), making it all the more important that we be able to measure and record these impacts. Advanced imaging is both a useful and problematic addition to the sports concussion picture. Currently expensive and immovable, these technologies provide exquisite detail and ever-increasing resolution to detect changes in brain. In fact, almost every study using diffusion tensor imaging or functional MRI detects significant differences from controls, whether the affected group is those with concussion/mTBI or attention problems or mood problems or pain. Furthermore, a particular signal may have different meanings in different contexts—type or severity of injury, age of subject, or time after injury may all affect the biological interpretation of a given imaging signal (Budde et al., 2011Budde M.D. Janes L. Gold E. Turtzo L.C. Frank J.A. Brain. 2011; 134: 2248-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The challenge with these technologies, then, is to understand the biological meaning of the signals being detected, and with that, the clinical or functional relevance (Vagnozzi et al., 2008Vagnozzi R. Signoretti S. Tavazzi B. Floris R. Ludovici A. Marziali S. Tarascio G. Amorini A.M. Di Pietro V. Delfini R. Lazzarino G. Neurosurgery. 2008; 62: 1286-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, Kamins et al., 2017Kamins J. Bigler E. Covassin T. Henry L. Kemp S. Leddy J.J. Mayer A. McCrea M. Prins M.

With great promise comes great responsibility—rushing advanced imaging into clinical service, where sample size is an n of 1 and the interpretation of the signal may be different based on many individual factors, risks a patient interpreting they have untreatable brain damage when that may be far from the case. Not only does neurotechnology offer opportunities for diagnosis of acute mTBI, but it may hold the key to monitoring recovery and risk for chronic problems. This is an area of substantial promise, but as yet with little data. There are reports of blood or fluid or genetic markers that predict worse acute outcomes, like acute cerebral swelling (CACNA1A) or chronic neurocognitive impairments after repeated impacts (APOE4). With time, will these become clinically useful? Electrophysiological measures have long been used both acutely and chronically after more severe TBI, and many efforts are now underway to translate these modalities to mTBI/concussion. In many cases, the physiological function of the signals detected remains unclear. Another area of promise includes ultrasound, where portable, noninvasive measurements of cerebral blood flow or cerebrovascular reactivity are showing changes after concussion and also after intervention, in small studies (Kamins et al., 2017Kamins J. Bigler E. Covassin T. Henry L. Kemp S. Leddy J.J. Mayer A. McCrea M. Prins M. Schneider K.J. et al.Br. J. Sports Med. 2017; (Published online April 28, 2017)https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2016-097464Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Having objective predictors of outcome may signal a time period for safer return to contact sports, suggest mechanism-specific therapeutics or even affect personal choices with regards to participation in higher risk activities. While major challenges remain in management of post-concussion vulnerability, progress in this area is already seen, and it’s one of the areas where basic science has informed clinical work in important ways. For instance, the basic science finding of neurometabolic dysfunction underlying a period of vulnerability to repeated concussion has been linked to clinical vulnerability in multiple studies. Clinical research showed increased risk for a second concussion during the first 10 days following the first concussion; more recently, clinical studies showed longer recovery in athletes who “played through” their concussions compared to those who were immediately removed from play. Metabolic and cerebrovascular dysfunction appear to occur in both animals and humans during this time window after concussion (Prins et al., 2013Prins M.L. Alexander D. Giza C.C. Hovda D.A. J. Neurotrauma. 2013; 30: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, Vagnozzi et al., 2008Vagnozzi R. Signoretti S. Tavazzi B. Floris R. Ludovici A. Marziali S. Tarascio G. Amorini A.M. Di Pietro V. Delfini R. Lazzarino G. Neurosurgery. 2008; 62: 1286-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), but the direct linkages between these measures of physiological dysfunction and cerebral vulnerability are still lacking and should be high-priority targets. Similar findings and loose associations exist for cytoskeletal disruption, deposition of damaged proteins (tau, amyloid, a-synuclein) and inflammation. The possibility that this acute vulnerability not only translates into worse/prolonged acute dysfunction but also initiates biological processes that lead to more permanent change or neurodegeneration is ominous (Giza and Hovda, 2014Giza C.C. Hovda D.A. Neurosurgery. 2014; 75: S24-S33Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Clinical studies to untangle these relationships prospectively will take years or decades, but work in animal models can greatly accelerate our understanding of these linkages and may be important to target the most promising points for intervention. Further investigation can better delineate this vulnerable period; for now, “when in doubt, sit it out” is the clinical mantra, but future studies will also permit us to answer “…but for how long”? The mainstay of concussion clinical management has been rest. This evolved from two concepts. First, protecting the brain from repeat injury during the vulnerable window—as already discussed, there is considerable evidence for this in both basic and clinical concussion/TBI research. The second concept is more challenging, namely the idea that the injured brain needs to be protected from any neural activity or stimulation. For this, the data are more complex. In non-TBI focal lesion models that result in limb weakness, forced overuse of the affected limb can result in a larger brain lesion, but with a nuance—enlargement of the brain lesion only occurred with forced overuse in the acute (<7 days post-injury) period. In fact, forced overuse outside the acute period, dubbed constraint-induced therapy, has become a rehabilitative intervention for hemiparesis in cases of more severe TBI, stroke, and cerebral palsy. In experimental models of diffuse mTBI, the effects of exercise also show mixed results. Acute voluntary exercise interferes with normal plasticity and cognition, but subacute (>7 days post-injury) voluntary wheel running enhances neurotrophins and other molecular markers of plasticity and results in improved cognition. This effect also appears to partially be dependent upon the severity of the initial injury. Interestingly, forced exercise results in a more sustained stress response, which may counteract the beneficial effects of post-TBI activity (Griesbach et al., 2011Griesbach G.S. Hovda D.A. Tio D.L. Taylor A.N. Neuroscience. 2011; 178: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The pre-injury status of the individual also weighs heavily here; in a study where animals were exercising regularly prior to concussive injury, the greater the delay in returning to physical activity post-injury, the greater the deficit (Mychasiuk et al., 2016Mychasiuk R. Hehar H. Ma I. Candy S. Esser M.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2016; 44: 2407-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Clinically, the original mandate to “sit it out” resulted in some practitioners instituting not only restrictions on contact sports participation (which is supported by evidence) but also prohibitions on non-contact physical activity, cognitive activity, and even use of electronics with screens (for which scientific evidence is lacking). This has been dubbed “cocoon therapy.” Subsequent clinic studies have not supported severe restrictions on non-contact risk activity after concussion. In fact, prolonged inactivity certainly diminishes physical conditioning and function, likely interferes with mechanisms of repair and plasticity, and may result in worsened neurobehavioral status (i.e., lack of social interactions with teammates, anxiety, and depression). There is limited but promising clinical research suggesting that graded aerobic exercise may promote recovery in patients with post-concussion syndrome, further arguing against cocoon therapy and prompting more investigation to determine the “sweet spot” in concussion recovery for returning an individual to both cognitive and physical activity. No one ever got a concussion from doing homework. There are multiple other areas where basic neuroscience can lead the way for translational and clinical work in concussions. Metabolic perturbation is a hallmark of concussive injury, and while physiological recovery generally occurs fairly rapidly, laboratory studies suggest that provision of alternative energy sources such as ketones, fatty acids, monocarboxylates, and others may reduce injury or shorten duration of dysfunction. Synaptic transmission is affected following concussion/mTBI. Unlike severe TBI, where destruction of large portions of tissue may render synaptic reconnection impossible, synaptic dysfunction and neural inactivation after mTBI may be mitigated through judiciously timed use of activating pharmacotherapies. Inflammatory cascades are activated after TBI of all severities, and balancing the potential beneficial versus detrimental effects of modulating inflammatory systems is ripe for basic and translational investigation. The physiological effects of sleep and sleep-dependent activation of the glymphatic system in promoting recovery after brain injuries are just starting to be investigated. As happens for any common condition with limited proven interventions, many have jumped into the fray with their one-size-fits-all therapy for concussions, often held only to the standard that the treatment must have some consumer appeal. This is an area for great caution, as financial, media-related, reputational, and even scientific conflicts of interest can emerge overtly or insidiously. While new ideas are always welcome to push forward the frontiers of knowledge, hidden biases and agendas at best delay the quest for the truth, and at worst reverse the progress of years of painstaking careful science in an effort to find a quick fix, a simple answer (or make a quick buck). As in all rigorous science, anecdote and testimonials should be accorded the weight they deserve, and the hard work of having appropriate controls, randomizing, blinding, and objective outcome measures should not give way to short cuts, sloppy research, and inappropriate conclusions. Impacting one’s brain repeatedly is not a good thing. However, equating sports participation with smoking or calling for a ban on all contact sports oversimplifies a complex equation. Similar or maybe greater risks accrue to the inactive brain, or the brain in an inactive body. While basic and clinical neuroscience studies examining biological adaptations in response to physical activity have clearly shown benefit, how to quantitate these benefits in a setting of risk for concussive or other injury is unclear. Another important area for investigation relates to the specific role of such physical activity after injury—what type, intensity, and timing of activity will result in maximal benefit? Where is the physiological “sweet spot” after concussion where increased demands of physical or mental exertion are associated with lasting functional improvement? For sports involving contact risk, what is the minimum level of training (particularly during brain development) to develop the physical skills necessary to play at the next level, and how does this balance with the potential risk savings obtained by simply delaying the age at which contact play is permitted? It is also important to keep the risk of concussion in perspective with all the other arguably greater risks faced by adolescents in the U.S., including obesity, tobacco/drugs, alcohol, and sexually transmitted diseases (Johnson et al., 2014Johnson N.B. Hayes L.D. Brown K. Hoo E.C. Ethier K.A. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)MMWR Suppl. 2014; 63: 3-27PubMed Google Scholar)."

A particular miRNA can have one to thousands of messenger RNA targets, establishing the potential for a small change in sequence or overall miRNA structure to have profound phenotypic effects. However, the majority of non-human primate miRNA is predicted solely by homology to the human genome and lacks experimental validation. In the present study, we sequenced thirteen species representing a wide range of the primate phylogeny. Hundreds of miRNA were validated, and the number of species with experimentally validated miRNA was tripled. These species include a sister taxon to humans (bonobo) and basal primates (aye-aye, mouse lemur, galago). Consistent with previous studies, we found the seed region and mature miRNA to be highly conserved across primates, with overall structural conservation of the pre-miRNA hairpin. However, there were a number of interesting exceptions, including a seed shift due to structural changes in miR-501. We also identified an increase in the number of miR-320 paralogs throughout primate evolution. Many of these non-conserved miRNA appear to regulate neuronal processes, illustrating the importance of investigating miRNA to learn more about human evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2714434942,"Despite TMS wide adoption, its spatial and temporal patterns of neuronal effects are not well understood. Although progress has been made in predicting induced currents in the brain using realistic finite element models (FEM), there is little consensus on how a magnetic field of a typical TMS coil should be modeled. Empirical validation of such models is limited and subject to several limitations.We evaluate and empirically validate models of a figure-of-eight TMS coil that are commonly used in published modeling studies, of increasing complexity: simple circular coil model; coil with in-plane spiral winding turns; and finally one with stacked spiral winding turns. We will assess the electric fields induced by all 3 coil models in the motor cortex using a computer FEM model. Biot-Savart models of discretized wires were used to approximate the 3 coil models of increasing complexity. We use a tailored MR based phase mapping technique to get a full 3D validation of the incident magnetic field induced in a cylindrical phantom by our TMS coil. FEM based simulations on a meshed 3D brain model consisting of five tissues types were performed, using two orthogonal coil orientations.Substantial differences in the induced currents are observed, both theoretically and empirically, between highly idealized coils and coils with correctly modeled spiral winding turns. Thickness of the coil winding turns affect minimally the induced electric field, and it does not influence the predicted activation.TMS coil models used in FEM simulations should include in-plane coil geometry in order to make reliable predictions of the incident field. Modeling the in-plane coil geometry is important to correctly simulate the induced electric field and to correctly make reliable predictions of neuronal activation."
https://openalex.org/W2651983102,"Commercial Cydia pomonella granulovirus (CpGV) products have been successfully applied to control codling moth (CM) in organic and integrated fruit production for more than 30 years. Since 2005, resistance against the widely used isolate CpGV-M has been reported from different countries in Europe. The inheritance of this so-called type I resistance is dominant and linked to the Z chromosome. Recently, a second form (type II) of CpGV resistance in CM was reported from a field population (NRW-WE) in Germany. Type II resistance confers reduced susceptibility not only to CpGV-M but to most known CpGV isolates and it does not follow the previously described Z-linked inheritance of type I resistance. To further analyze type II resistance, two CM strains, termed CpR5M and CpR5S, were generated from parental NRW-WE by repeated mass crosses and selection using the two isolates CpGV-M and CpGV-S, respectively. Both CpR5M and CpR5S were considered to be genetically homogeneous for the presence of the resistance allele(s). By crossing and backcrossing experiments with a susceptible CM strain, followed by resistance testing of the offspring, an autosomal dominant inheritance of resistance was elucidated. In addition, cross-resistance to CpGV-M and CpGV-S was detected in both strains, CpR5M and CpR5S. To test the hypothesis that the autosomal inheritance of type II resistance was caused by a large interchromosomal rearrangement involving the Z chromosome, making type I resistance appear to be autosomal in these strains; fluorescence in situ hybridization with bacterial artificial chromosome probes (BAC-FISH) was used to physically map the Z chromosomes of different CM strains. Conserved synteny of the Z-linked genes in CpR5M and other CM strains rejects this hypothesis and argues for a novel genetic and functional mode of resistance in CM populations with type II resistance."

Research cruises in 2010 (approximately 2–3 months after the well had been capped), 2011, and 2014 were conducted to determine the initial and subsequent effects of the oil spill on deep-sea soft-bottom infauna. A total of 34 stations were sampled from two zones: 20 stations in the “impact” zone versus 14 stations in the “non-impact” zone. Chemical contaminants were significantly different between the two zones. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons averaged 218 ppb in the impact zone compared to 14 ppb in the non-impact zone. Total petroleum hydrocarbons averaged 1166 ppm in the impact zone compared to 102 ppm in the non-impact zone. While there was no difference between zones for meiofauna and macrofauna abundance, community diversity was significantly lower in the impact zone. Meiofauna taxa richness over the three sampling periods averaged 8 taxa/sample in the impact zone, compared to 10 taxa/sample in the non-impact zone; and macrofauna richness averaged 25 taxa/sample in the impact zone compared to 30 taxa/sample in the non-impact zone. Oil originating from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill reached the seafloor and had a persistent negative impact on diversity of soft-bottom, deep-sea benthic communities. While there are signs of recovery for some benthic community variables, full recovery has not yet occurred four years after the spill."

The current study aims to yield normative data: i.e., the physiological standard for 30 selected quantitative 3D parameters that accurately capture and describe a full-skeleton, upright-standing attitude. Specific and exclusive consideration was given to three distinct categories: postural, spine morphology and pelvic parameters. To capture such 3D parameters, the authors selected a non-ionising 3D opto-electronic stereo-photogrammetric approach. This required the identification and measurement of 27 body landmarks, each specifically tagged with a skin marker. As subjects for the measurement of these parameters, a cohort of 124 asymptomatic young adult volunteers was recruited. All parameters were identified and measured within this group. Postural and spine morphology data have been compared between genders. In this regard, only five statistically significant differences were found: pelvis width, pelvis torsion, the ""lumbar"" lordosis angle value, the lumbar curve length, and the T12-L5 anatomically-bound lumbar angle value. The ""thoracic"" kyphosis mean angle value was the same in both sexes and, even if, derived from skin markers placed on spinous processes it resulted in perfect agreement with the X-ray based literature. As regards lordosis, a direct comparison was more difficult because methods proposed in the literature differ as to the number and position of vertebrae under consideration, and their related angle values. However, when the L1 superior-L5 inferior end plate Cobb angle was considered, these results aligned strongly with the existing literature. Asymmetry was a standard postural-spinal feature for both sexes. Each subject presented some degree of leg length discrepancy (LLD) with μ = 9.37mm. This was associated with four factors: unbalanced posture and/or underfoot loads, spinal curvature in the frontal plane, and pelvis torsion. This led to the additional study of the effect of LLD equalisation influence on upright posture, relying on a sub-sample of 100 subjects (51 males, 49 females). As a result of the equalisation, about 82% of this sub-sample showed improvement in standing posture, mainly in the frontal plane; while in the sagittal plane less than 1/3 of the sub-sample showed evidence of change in spinal angles. A significant variation was found in relation to pelvis torsion: 46% of subjects showed improvement, 49% worsening. The method described in study presents several advantages: non-invasive aspect; relatively short time for a complete postural evaluation with many clinically useful 3D and 2D anatomical/biomechanical/clinical parameters; analysis of real neutral unconstrained upright standing posture."

Furthermore, obtainable sonar images are of low resolution. To address these problems, a novel underwater dam crack detection and classification approach based on sonar imagery is proposed. First, the sonar images are divided into image blocks. Second, a clustering analysis of a 3-D feature space is used to obtain the crack fragments. Third, the crack fragments are connected using an improved tensor voting method. Fourth, a minimum spanning tree is used to obtain the crack curve. Finally, an improved evidence theory combined with fuzzy rule reasoning is proposed to classify the cracks. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to detect underwater dam cracks and classify them accurately and effectively under complex underwater environments."
https://openalex.org/W2715755399,"Despite the success of cART, greater than 50% of HIV infected people develop cognitive and motor deficits termed HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Macrophages are the major cell type infected in the CNS. Unlike for T cells, the virus does not kill macrophages and these long-lived cells may become HIV reservoirs in the brain. They produce cytokines/chemokines and viral proteins that promote inflammation and neuronal damage, playing a key role in HIV neuropathogenesis. HIV Tat is the transactivator of transcription that is essential for replication and transcriptional regulation of the virus and is the first protein to be produced after HIV infection. Even with successful cART, Tat is produced by infected cells. In this study we examined the role of the HIV Tat protein in the regulation of gene expression in human macrophages. Using THP-1 cells, a human monocyte/macrophage cell line, and their infection with lentivirus, we generated stable cell lines that express Tat-Flag. We performed ChIP-seq analysis of these cells and found 66 association sites of Tat in promoter or coding regions. Among these are C5, CRLF2/TSLPR, BDNF, and APBA1/Mint1, genes associated with inflammation/damage. We confirmed the association of Tat with these sequences by ChIP assay and expression of these genes in our THP-1 cell lines by qRT-PCR. We found that HIV Tat increased expression of C5, APBA1, and BDNF, and decreased CRLF2. The K50A Tat-mutation dysregulated expression of these genes without affecting the binding of the Tat complex to their gene sequences. Our data suggest that HIV Tat, produced by macrophage HIV reservoirs in the brain despite successful cART, contributes to neuropathogenesis in HIV-infected people."

The minimum aggregating dose of ristocetin was similarly reduced in both patient groups, and modulated by their underlying VWF mutations. Platelet VWF content was normal in all patients lacking in large multimers, but sometimes reduced in those with a normal multimer pattern. All the former patients and none of the latter had persistent or transient thrombocytopenia. A short VWF half-life (affecting plasma VWF levels) was seen in both groups, but more pronounced in patients without large multimers. Bleeding scores were also high in all patients, but more so in those without large multimers, apparently regardless of their platelet count. The marked phenotypic heterogeneity of type 2B VWD concerns not only patients' VWF multimer pattern, but also their bleeding risk, and consequently their appropriate treatment too.

Phylogenetic analyses revealed that both strains fell within the cluster of the genus Pseudoalteromonas and represented an independent lineage. The average nucleotide identity and in silico DNA-DNA hybridization values between JW1T and type strains of the closely related Pseudoalteromonas species were 70.9-83.3% and 20.0-26.4%, respectively. The sole respiratory quinone in both strains is ubiquinone 8 (Q-8). The principal fatty acids are summed feature 3 (C16:1ω7c and/or iso-C15:0 2OH), C18:1ω7c, and C16:0. The major polar lipids are phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, one unidentified glycolipid, one unidentified aminolipid, and one unidentified phospholipid.

https://openalex.org/W2636425596,"Transformation is the main platform for genetic improvement and gene function studies in plants. However, the established somatic embryo transformation system for grapevines is time-consuming and has low efficiency, which limits its utilization in functional genomics research. Vitis amurensis is a wild Vitis species with remarkable cold tolerance. The lack of an efficient genetic transformation system for it has significantly hindered the functional identification of cold stress related genes in the species. Herein, an efficient method was established to produce transformed calli of V. amurensis. Segments of petioles from micropropagated plantlets of V. amurensis exhibited better capacity to differentiate calli than leaf-discs and stem segments, and thus was chosen as target tissue for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Both neomycin phosphotransferase II (NPTII) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) genes were used for simultaneous selection of transgenic calli based on kanamycin resistance and eGFP fluorescence. Several parameters affecting the transformation efficiency were optimized including the concentration of kanamycin, Agrobacterium stains, bacterial densities, infection treatments and co-cultivation time. The transgenic callus lines were verified by checking the integration of NPTII gene into calli genomes, the expression of eGFP gene and the fluorescence of eGFP. Up to 20% of the petiole segments produced transformed calli after 2 months of cultivation. This efficient transformation system will facilitate the functional analysis of agronomic characteristics and related genes not only in V. amurensis but also in other grapevine species."

However the variability of bast fiber yield and quality represents an important barrier to further exploitation. Primary and secondary fiber content was examined in two commercial hemp varieties (Fedora 17, Santhica 27) grown under contrasted sowing density and irrigation conditions. Both growing conditions and hemp varieties impact stem tissue architecture with a large effect on the proportion of secondary fibers but not primary fibers. Attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy allowed the discrimination of manually-isolated native primary fibers and secondary fibers but did not reveal any clustering according to growing conditions and variety. Infrared data were confirmed by wet chemistry analyses that revealed slight but significant differences between primary and secondary fiber cell wall composition. Infrared spectroscopy of technical fibers obtained after mechanical defibering revealed differences with native primary, but not secondary fibers and also discriminated samples obtained from plants grown under different conditions. Altogether the results suggested that the observed variability of hemp technical fibers could be partially explained by i) differences in secondary fiber production and ii) differential behavior during mechanical defibering resulting in unequal separation of primary and secondary fibers."

This study exploits the extensive data on MRSA infections in the Norwegian surveillance system to investigate the important factors defining the MRSA epidemiology. Methods We performed a quasi-Poisson regression of the monthly notification rate (NR) of MRSA infections reported from January 2006 to December 2015, comparing the time trend among people with an immigrant vs. Norwegian background and domestic vs. imported infections, stratified by age groups. Findings A total of 5289 MRSA infections were reported during the study period, of which 2255 (42·6%) were acquired in Norway, 1370 (25·9%) abroad, and 1664 (31·5%) with an unknown place of acquisition. Overall, the monthly NR increased significantly from 2006 to 2015 (+0·8% each month). The monthly increase in immigrants (+1·3%) was steeper than that in people with a Norwegian background (+0·6%). There was a significant growth (+0·4%) in the rate of domestically acquired infections, however, the NR of infections acquired abroad increased faster (+0·8%). For both imported and domestic infections, the increase occurred in persons aged < 70 years. Interpretation Our analysis suggests that immigration and importation, especially among persons aged < 40 years, represent important factors for the increasing notification rate of MRSA infections in Norway."

The objectives of this paper are to describe infant feeding knowledge and practices in Boucle du Mouhoun, Burkina Faso; to identify predictors of exclusive breastfeeding among infants <6 months, and consumption of soft, semi-solid or solid food among infants 6–11 months; to describe mothers’ sources of information regarding breastfeeding. Methods A cross-sectional survey (n = 2288) of a representative sample of women aged 15–49 years with at least one live birth in past year took place during June and July 2015. Crude and multivariable random-effects logistic regressions were used to identify factors predictive of exclusive breastfeeding and consumption of soft, semi-solid or solid food. Results 30% of infants <6 months were exclusively breastfed; 67% of infants age 6–11 months consumed soft, semi-solid or solid food the day and night before the interview. 2% of infants age 6–11 months had a minimum acceptable diet. There was strong evidence of a positive association between knowledge and practice of exclusive breastfeeding, nonetheless 60% of mothers who correctly identified that an infant should be exclusively breastfed for 6 months did not breastfeed their infant exclusively. Only 42% of mothers reported receiving advice on breastfeeding from a health worker, despite all mothers having contact with a health worker at least once during pregnancy or postpartum. Conclusion Given poor practices and low levels of knowledge, targeted interventions are needed to improve infant nutrition in Boucle du Mouhoun during antenatal, delivery and postnatal care. Most women now deliver in a facility in Burkina Faso; increased attention should be paid to ensuring that existing guidelines relating to support and counselling for infant feeding are adhered to. Factors such as social norms are also important and these should be investigated in more detail using qualitative methods."
https://openalex.org/W2706881813,"Obesity in many current pre-clinical animal models of obesity and diabetes is mediated by monogenic mutations; these are rarely associated with the development of human obesity. A new mouse model, the FATZO mouse, has been developed to provide polygenic obesity and a metabolic pattern of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, that support the presence of insulin resistance similar to metabolic disease in patients with insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes. The FATZO mouse resulted from a cross of C57BL/6J and AKR/J mice followed by selective inbreeding for obesity, increased insulin and hyperglycemia. Since many clinical studies have established a close link between higher body weight and the development of type 2 diabetes, we investigated whether time to progression to type 2 diabetes or disease severity in FATZO mice was dependent on weight gain in young animals. Our results indicate that lighter animals developed metabolic disturbances much slower and to a lesser magnitude than their heavier counterparts. Consumption of a diet containing high fat, accelerated weight gain in parallel with disease progression. A naturally occurring and significant variation in the body weight of FATZO offspring enables these mice to be identified as low, mid and high body weight groups at a young age. These weight groups remain into adulthood and correspond to slow, medium and accelerated development of type 2 diabetes. Thus, body weight inclusion criteria can optimize the FATZO model for studies of prevention, stabilization or treatment of type 2 diabetes."

The aim of this study was to optimise a HHD-technique and to test its reproducibility and validity.This study involved three phases, in which two techniques were evaluated. Both HHD-techniques used a lever-arm of 22 centimetre. HHD-technique 1 used a break-technique. After obtaining within-session test-retest reproducibility (phase 1) we optimised the HHD-technique by adding a fixation-belt and using a make-technique (HHD-technique 2). We tested the within-session test-retest and inter-rater reproducibility (phase 2) and the validity (phase 3) of HHD-technique 2 using an isokinetic dynamometer. New cohorts of participants were recruited for each phase.Phase 1: we tested HHD-technique 1 in 26 participants with a lower extremity amputation. It was test-retest reproducible (ICC3.1agreement: 0.80-0.92, standard error of measurement (SEM): 3.1-4.4 Nm and smallest detectable change (SDC): 8.6-12.3 Nm). There were questions regarding the validity of the measurement, because the mean muscle torque of the residual limb and sound limb were similar, which is uncommon. Phase 2: reproducibility of HHD-technique 2 was tested in 44 participants with a lower extremity amputation. It was test-retest reproducible (ICC3.1agreement: 0.96-0.97, SEM: 3.9-4.7 Nm and SDC: 10.9-12.9 Nm) but not inter-rater reproducible despite having good reliability (ICC3.1agreement: 0.92, SEM: 6.9-7.6 Nm and SDC: 19.2-21.2 Nm). Systematic bias and bias related to the magnitude of the muscle torque was suspected. Phase 3: the concurrent validity was established in 30 healthy participants (r = 0.84). Systematic bias in measurement error was present, including a consistent overestimation of the muscle torque of 28% using the HHD.HHD-technique 2 is a test-retest reproducible and valid measuring technique The technique may be further optimised by the use of an external device to stabilise the HHD."
https://openalex.org/W2656686091,"Purpose To investigate the effect of oroxylin A on the survival of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and the activation of microglial cells in a rat optic nerve (ON) crush model. Methods Oroxylin A (15mg/Kg in 0.2ml phosphate-buffered saline) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS control) was immediately administered after ON crush once by subcutaneous injection. Rats were euthanized at 2 weeks after the crush injury. The density of RGC was counted by retrograde labeling with FluoroGold and immunostaining of retina flat mounts for Brn3a. Electrophysiological visual function was assessed by flash visual evoked potentials (FVEP). TUNEL assay, immunoblotting analysis of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the retinas, and immunohistochemistry of GFAP in the retinas and ED1 in the ON were evaluated. Results Two weeks after the insult, the oroxylin A-treated group had significantly higher FG labeled cells and Brn3a+ cells suggesting preserved RGC density in the central and mid-peripheral retinas compared with those of the PBS-treated group. FVEP measurements showed a significantly better preserved latency of the P1 wave in the ON-crushed, oroxylin A-treated rats than the ON-crushed, PBS treated rats. TUNEL assays showed fewer TUNEL positive cells in the ON-crushed, oroxylin A-treated rats. The number of ED1 positive cells was reduced at the lesion site of the optic nerve in the ON-crushed, oroxylin A-treated group. Increased GFAP expression in the retina was reduced greatly in ON-crushed, oroxylin A-treated group. Furthermore, administration of oroxylin A significantly attenuated ON crush insult-induced iNOS and COX-2 expression in the retinas. Conclusions These results demonstrated that oroxylin A hasss neuroprotective effects on RGC survival with preserved visual function and a decrease in microglial infiltration in the ONs after ON crush injury."
https://openalex.org/W2666264305,"Disheveled-associated activator of morphogenesis (DAAM) is a diaphanous-related formin protein essential for the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics in diverse biological processes. The conserved formin homology 1 and 2 (FH1–FH2) domains of DAAM catalyze actin nucleation and processively mediate filament elongation. These activities are indirectly regulated by the N- and C-terminal regions flanking the FH1–FH2 domains. Recently, the C-terminal diaphanous-autoregulatory domain (DAD) and the C terminus (CT) of formins have also been shown to regulate actin assembly by directly interacting with actin. Here, to better understand the biological activities of DAAM, we studied the role of DAD-CT regions of Drosophila DAAM in its interaction with actin with in vitro biochemical and in vivo genetic approaches. We found that the DAD-CT region binds actin in vitro and that its main actin-binding element is the CT region, which does not influence actin dynamics on its own. However, we also found that it can tune the nucleating activity and the filament end–interaction properties of DAAM in an FH2 domain-dependent manner. We also demonstrate that DAD-CT makes the FH2 domain more efficient in antagonizing with capping protein. Consistently, in vivo data suggested that the CT region contributes to DAAM-mediated filopodia formation and dynamics in primary neurons. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the CT region of DAAM plays an important role in actin assembly regulation in a biological context."
https://openalex.org/W2697936773,"Photo-identification surveys of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins were conducted from 2009 to 2014 off Reunion Island (55°E33'/21°S07'), in the Indian Ocean. Robust Design models were applied to produce the most reliable estimate of population abundance and survival rate, while accounting for temporary emigration from the survey area (west coast). The sampling scheme consisted of a five-month (June-October) sampling period in each year of the study. The overall population size at Reunion was estimated to be 72 individuals (SE = 6.17, 95%CI = 61-85), based on a random temporary emigration (γ"") of 0.096 and a proportion of 0.70 (SE = 0.03) distinct individuals. The annual survival rate was 0.93 (±0.018 SE, 95%CI = 0.886-0.958) and was constant over time and between sexes. Models considering gender groups indicated different movement patterns between males and females. Males showed null or quasi-null temporary emigration (γ"" = γ' < 0.01), while females showed a random temporary emigration (γ"") of 0.10, suggesting that a small proportion of females was outside the survey area during each primary sampling period. Sex-specific temporary migration patterns were consistent with movement and residency patterns observed in other areas. The Robust Design approach provided an appropriate sampling scheme for deriving island-associated population parameters, while allowing to restrict survey effort both spatially (i.e. west coast only) and temporally (five months per year). Although abundance and survival were stable over the six years, the small population size of fewer than 100 individuals suggested that this population is highly vulnerable. Priority should be given to reducing any potential impact of human activity on the population and its habitat."

However, measles among migrants and the resulting changes in epidemiological characteristics have brought new challenges to the elimination of measles. We aim to describe the measles epidemic trend over the past 30 years in a central district in Shanghai, China.The present study was conducted in the Jing'an District, which is located in the center of Shanghai. Based on historical surveillance data of measles, we calculated the incidence of measles among local residents and migrants separately. Next, we classified all of the cases of the measles among local residents between 1984 and 2015 into 8 age groups and 5 birth cohorts. Finally, we calculated the measles incidence in each time period by the different age groups and birth cohorts, to understand the measles epidemic trend over past 30 years in the Jing'an District.A total of 103 cases of measles were reported from the Jing'an District, Shanghai, from 1984 to 2015. For infants less than 1 year of age and adults over 30 years of age, the incidence of measles continued to rise over the past 30 years. For a specific birth cohort, the incidence of measles after measles vaccination declined initially, and was then followed by a rebound.The incidence of measles in older adults and infants increased in some developed regions, which slows the process of measles elimination. This suggested that the population immunity against measles after measles vaccination would gradually reduce with time. We recommend supplemental immunization against measles in adults in order to reduce the immunity decline, especially for migrants."

https://openalex.org/W2722505563,"Stroke is a leading cause of adult disability worldwide. Improving stroke outcome requires an orchestrated interplay that involves up regulation of pro-survival pathways and a concomitant suppression of pro-apoptotic mediators. In this investigation, we assessed the involvement of eNOS in the AT1 blocker-mediated protective and pro-recovery effects in animals with hypertension. We also evaluated the effect of acute eNOS inhibition in hypertensive animals. To achieve these goals, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were implanted with blood pressure transmitters, and randomized to receive either an eNOS inhibitor (L-NIO) or saline one hour before cerebral ischemia induction. After 3 hours of ischemia, animals were further randomized to receive either candesartan or saline at the time of reperfusion and sacrificed either 24 hours or 7 days later. Candesartan induced an early protective effect that was independent of eNOS inhibition (50% improvement in motor function). However, the protective effect of candesartan was associated with about five fold up regulation of BDNF expression and about three fold reduction in ER stress markers, in an eNOS dependent manner. The early benefit of a single dose of candesartan, present at 24 hours after stroke, was diminished at 7 days, perhaps due to a failure to induce an angiogenic response in these hypertensive animals. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate an early prorecovery effect of candesartan at both functional and molecular levels. Candesartan induced prorecovery signaling was mediated through eNOS. This effect was not maintained at 7 days after experimental ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W2695740290,"Under a traditional paradigm, only those with the expected background knowledge consume academic literature. The lay press, as well as government and non-government agencies, play a complementary role of extracting findings of high interest or importance and translating them for general viewing. The need for accurate reporting and public advising is paramount when attempting to tackle epidemic outbreaks through behavior change. Yet, public trust in media outlets is at a historic low. The Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) model for media reporting on public health emergencies was established in 2005 and has subsequently been used to analyze media reporting on outbreaks of influenza and measles as well as smoking habits and medication compliance. However, no media analysis had yet been performed on the 2013–2016 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak. This study compared the EVD information relayed by lay press sources with general review articles in the academic literature through a mixed-methods analysis. These findings suggest that comprehensive review articles could not serve as a source to clarify and contextualize the uncertainties around the EVD outbreak, perhaps due to adherence to technical accuracy at the expense of clarity within the context of outbreak conditions. This finding does not imply inferiority of the academic literature, nor does it draw direct causation between confusion in review articles and public misunderstanding. Given the erosion of the barriers siloing academia, combined with the demands of today’s fast-paced media environment, contemporary researchers should realize that no study is outside the public forum and to therefore consider shifting the paradigm to take personal responsibility in the process of accurately translating their scientific words into public policy actions to best serve as a source of clarity."

https://openalex.org/W2678467451,"The knee adduction moment (KAM) relates to medial knee osteoarthritis (OA). Several gait modifications to reduce the KAM for the prevention of knee OA have been studied. Most of the modifications, however, involve voluntary changes in leg alignment. Here we investigated the biomechanical effects for reducing the KAM of a walking style with a small trunk rotation and arm swing gait, which is a natural walking style used while wearing a kimono (Nanba walk) that shifts the ground reaction force toward the stance leg (reduced lever arm). Twenty-nine healthy adults (21.5 ± 0.6 years) participated in the present study. A three-dimensional analysis system with 10 cameras and 1 force plate was used to obtain the KAM and other biomechanical data. Surface electromyography (EMG) of the hip and trunk muscles (internal obliquus abdominal muscle: IO, external obliquus abdominal muscle: EO, multifidus muscle: MF, and gluteus medius muscle: Gmed) was also assessed, and integrated EMG (iEMG) of the four muscles was assessed in the first and second halves of the stance phase. The 1st and 2nd peak KAMs were significantly decreased during Nanba walking (0.40±0.09 and 0.37±0.13 Nm/kg) compared with normal walking (0.45±0.09 and 0.45±0.13 Nm/kg; P = 0.002, P<0.001, respectively). The lever arm lengths at the 1st and 2nd peak KAMs were also significantly decreased during Nanba walking compared with normal walking (p = 0.023 and p<0.001, respectively). The iEMGs of IO, EO and Gmed muscles during the first half, and the iEMGs of EO and GM during the second half of the stance phase were significantly increased during Nanba walking compared with normal walking. The Nanba gait modification could be a useful strategy for reducing the KAM with high activation of the trunk and hip joint muscles for the prevention and/or treatment of medial knee OA."
https://openalex.org/W2696714155,"Recent advancements in cell-based therapies for the treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD) show continuing promise for the use of transplanted stem and cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) to promote cardiac restitution. However, a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control the development of these cells remains incomplete and is critical for optimizing their use in such therapy. Long non-coding (lnc) RNA has recently emerged as a crucial class of regulatory molecules involved in directing a variety of critical biological processes including development, homeostasis and disease. As such, a rising body of evidence suggests that they also play key regulatory roles in CPC development, though many questions remain regarding the expression landscape and specific identity of lncRNA involved in this process. To address this, we performed whole transcriptome sequencing of two murine CPC populations–Nkx2-5 EmGFP reporter-sorted embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived and ex vivo, cardiosphere-derived–in an effort to characterize their lncRNA profiles and potentially identify novel CPC regulators. The resulting sequencing data revealed an enrichment in both CPC populations for a panel of previously-identified lncRNA genes associated with cardiac differentiation. Additionally, a total of 1,678 differentially expressed and as-of-yet unannotated, putative lncRNA genes were found to be enriched for in the two CPC populations relative to undifferentiated ES cells."

Neuron. 2017; 94 (this issue): 1173-1189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar demonstrate how neuropeptides from two groups of clock cells appear to be responsible for the fly’s circadian neurons becoming active at different times of day. By delaying the activity of their clock cell targets, they give rise to morning and evening behavior. Liang et al., 2017Liang X. Holy T.E. Taghert P.H. Neuron. 2017; 94 (this issue): 1173-1189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar demonstrate how neuropeptides from two groups of clock cells appear to be responsible for the fly’s circadian neurons becoming active at different times of day. By delaying the activity of their clock cell targets, they give rise to morning and evening behavior. We live in a world of relentless daily light and temperature cycles and so most eukaryotes and some bacteria have evolved an endogenous circa-24 hr (circadian) clock that synchronizes the processes of life with its rhythmic environment. In animals, behavior is rhythmic thanks to the action of clock neurons in the brain. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, 75 clock neurons per hemisphere are distributed into six main clusters, three laterally (s-LNv, l-LNv, and LNd) and three dorsally (DN1, DN2, and DN3) (see Figure 1). The molecular components of the clock cycle in unison in all of them. For instance, under both light-dark cycles (LD) and constant darkness (DD) the clock protein PERIOD (PER) reaches a peak at the end of the night and a trough at the end of the day. However, under LD and for the first few days in DD, the rest/activity cycle of flies is bimodal, with a peak of locomotor activity in the morning (the “M” component) and another in the evening (“E”). Genetic dissection of these clock neurons revealed that the s-LNv cells are typically responsible for early morning activity (hence “M” cells), and likewise, the LNds generate the evening component, so called “E”’ cells. But how can a unimodal and synchronous molecular clock inform the different cells of their different M or E duties? Liang and co-authors began addressing this issue in a previous publication (Liang et al., 2016Liang X. Holy T.E. Taghert P.H. Science. 2016; 351: 976-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). They used light-sheet microscopy (Holekamp et al., 2008Holekamp T.F. Turaga D. Holy T.E. Neuron. 2008; 57: 661-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and a genetically encoded Ca2+ sensor GCaMP6s, to measure intracellular levels of Ca2+ in all circadian neuron groups over a 24 hr period. They observed that the different groups show maximal Ca2+ levels, hence neuronal activity, at different times of the day. The s-LNv neurons peak around dawn, the LNd around dusk, the l-LNv around midday, and DN1 and DN3 around midnight. In simple terms, although all circadian clusters agree on what time it is via their canonical molecular clock, the timing of their peak excitabilities are distinct and sequential. While this was an important and highly significant step in the right direction, it still did not illuminate the mechanisms that sequentially time neuronal activation. For the fly, light is the major entraining cue, and the neuropeptide Pigment Dispersing Factor (PDF) produced by the s- and l-LNv cells has long been recognized as a major synchronizer of the molecular clock in circadian neurons. In a new paper in this issue of Neuron, Liang et al., 2017Liang X. Holy T.E. Taghert P.H. Neuron. 2017; 94 (this issue): 1173-1189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar have now investigated the effects of light and PDF on the sequence of excitability within the network. They examined mutants that eliminate the production or the response to PDF under LD or DD. They observed that the LNds respond to the light-dark regime and to PDF by delaying their Ca2+ rhythm. In contrast, only PDF signaling was able to delay the DN3 while l-LNv and DN1 were insensitive to the neuropeptide. The phase of s-LNv was not affected by these manipulations but their Ca2+ “wave” became wider. When PDFR, the PDF receptor, was re-introduced specifically in those cells in an otherwise PDFR mutant background, the normal width of the Ca2+ “wave” was restored. Hence PDF signaling delays activation of the LNds and contributes to curbing the activation of the s-LNvs. Bath applications of synthetic peptide showed that in both cell types, the effects of PDF can be explained by a reduction of Ca2+ levels and that those effects require the presence of PDFR. Ectopic expression of PDFR in the naturally PDFR null l-LNv further suggested a cell-autonomous mechanism. Moving back to the effect of light, Liang et al., 2017Liang X. Holy T.E. Taghert P.H. Neuron. 2017; 94 (this issue): 1173-1189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar investigated how light pulses delivered at the beginning or the end of the night influenced the Ca2+ waves on the following days. A light pulse in the early night generates a delay in the subsequent start of the locomotor activity cycle, whereas a light pulse in the late night results in an advance. This is an almost universal circadian phase response to light. An early-night light pulse delayed Ca2+ rhythms in all clock neurons on the first day, caused desynchrony in the DN1 and DN3 and a further delay in the s-LNvs and LNds on day 2, with a return to normal phase on day 3. A late-night pulse caused a pronounced anticipation (advance) of the Ca2+ rhythm in the s-LNvs on day 1, whereas on day 2 the advance became smaller and extended to all the other neurons, with the same pattern persisting on day 3. This is quite a different picture from the one obtained by examining the cycling of a PER-LUCIFERASE fusion protein in whole-brain explants of transgenic flies (Roberts et al., 2015Roberts L. Leise T.L. Noguchi T. Galschiodt A.M. Houl J.H. Welsh D.K. Holmes T.C. Curr. Biol. 2015; 25: 858-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this preparation, a late-night light pulse induced the most rapid and coherent phase advance in the LNds while it quickly desynchronized the other circadian groups. Clearly there is not a simple relationship between the activity of neurons and the cycling of their clock molecules. Finally, as the DN1 do not require PDF for the phasing of their Ca2+ cycling, might another neuropeptide be involved? Mutant and mosaic analyses revealed that small Neuropeptide F (sNPF) is necessary for rhythmicity and phase of Ca2+ cycling in DN1, though it is not required for the cycling of PER. The s-LNv and two of the LNd neurons produce sNPF. Either group is sufficient for conferring rhythmicity but the s-LNv is necessary for correct Ca2+ phasing in the DN1. Similarly to PDF, sNPF operates by suppressing Ca2+ activity. The emerging model (Figure 1) is that of a network where the mismatch between the cycling of the molecular clock and that of neuronal activity is due to the delaying effects of light and neuropeptides on Ca2+ cycling. The default condition in the absence of the PDF receptor is a Ca2+ peak at dawn in s-LNv, DN3, and LNds. During the time of their maximal activation, the s-LNv secretes neuropeptides. PDF curbs the sLNv activation and delays the peak of activity of the LNd till dusk, with a further delay contributed by light under LD cycles. PDF is also responsible for delaying the maximal activation of the DN3 to the middle of the night, although it is not clear how the difference in phase between LNd and DN3 is generated under DD. The DN1 also peak in their activity in the middle of the night. However, unlike the DN3 they do not respond to PDF but to sNPF. According to the model there is a double wave of sNPF, first from the dawn-active s-LNv and then from the dusk-active LNd, although the latter seems redundant as it is not required for cycling nor is it sufficient for phase. The model cannot explain why the peak of Ca2+ of the l-LNv occurs in the middle of the morning. Figure 1 illustrates the clock neuronal groups and their expression of PDF and sNPF. Their intercellular communications, dissected by Liang et al., 2017Liang X. Holy T.E. Taghert P.H. Neuron. 2017; 94 (this issue): 1173-1189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, are shown in addition to the time of maximal Ca2+ activation for each group under LD (shown as ZT [zeitgeber time], which corresponds to lights on at ZT0 and lights off at ZT12). If one follows the timing of the clock dial, it is very interesting perhaps that cellular time roughly follows the relative anatomical locations of the cells generating a wave of activation, and of course it is clockwise (at least in this brain hemisphere)! It is almost like looking at the face of a clock. Clearly the model is still incomplete but it accounts for several of the findings that we have described above. Importantly, it suggests that PDF acts as a repressor of neuronal activity rather than as an activator, something that the Drosophila circadian community had long assumed. In addition, a very recent twist to this story is that a previously uncharacterized rhodopsin, Rh7, has been identified within the s-LNv and l-LNv and in some cells lying very close to the DN1 (Ni et al., 2017Ni J.D. Baik L.S. Holmes T.C. Montell C. Nature. 2017; 545: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Rh7 has been shown to mediate an additional light-sensing pathway. As Li and coworkers have used blue light to periodically interrogate the Gcamp reporter, might this have activated Rh7 with unforeseen downstream effects on the clock cells? It could be worthwhile to see whether reducing the expression of Rh7 affects the temporal regulation of neuronal activation. In conclusion, Liang, Holy, and Taghert’s innovative and sophisticated neurogenetic approach consolidates and extends their previous game-changing discovery of differentially timed clock neuron activation while also challenging current ideas of how the system might work (Liang et al., 2016Liang X. Holy T.E. Taghert P.H. Science. 2016; 351: 976-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Yet over the past two decades, the fly has also provided a superb model for the mammalian clock with its simpler 150 cell Drosophila circadian neuronal network compared to the suprachiasmatic nucleus, with its 20,000 neurons and comparable number of astrocytes. Recent work by Brancaccio et al., 2017Brancaccio M. Patton A.P. Chesham J.E. Maywood E.S. Hastings M.H. Neuron. 2017; 93: 1420-1435.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar using Ca2+ reporters has shown how astrocytes and SCN neurons are active during the night and day, respectively. Furthermore the astrocytes inhibit the dorsal SCN neurons via releasing glutamate into the extracellular space, and, remarkably, molecular manipulation of the astrocytes significantly alters the mouse free-running locomotor period. This antiphasic functional relationship between astrocytes and neurons in the SCN echoes the E and M cell groups in the fly circuit. Similar logic with different cellular actors...
