https://openalex.org/W2100749039,"Persistent changes in tree mortality rates can alter forest structure, composition, and ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration. Our analyses of longitudinal data from unmanaged old forests in the western United States showed that background (noncatastrophic) mortality rates have increased rapidly in recent decades, with doubling periods ranging from 17 to 29 years among regions. Increases were also pervasive across elevations, tree sizes, dominant genera, and past fire histories. Forest density and basal area declined slightly, which suggests that increasing mortality was not caused by endogenous increases in competition. Because mortality increased in small trees, the overall increase in mortality rates cannot be attributed solely to aging of large trees. Regional warming and consequent increases in water deficits are likely contributors to the increases in tree mortality rates."
https://openalex.org/W2084708009,"Following recent success in genome-wide association studies, a critical focus of human genetics is to understand how genetic variation at implicated loci influences cellular and disease processes. Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with SNPs around IRGM, but coding-sequence variation has been excluded as a source of this association. We identified a common, 20-kb deletion polymorphism, immediately upstream of IRGM and in perfect linkage disequilibrium (r2 = 1.0) with the most strongly CD-associated SNP, that causes IRGM to segregate in the population with two distinct upstream sequences. The deletion (CD risk) and reference (CD protective) haplotypes of IRGM showed distinct expression patterns. Manipulation of IRGM expression levels modulated cellular autophagy of internalized bacteria, a process implicated in CD. These results suggest that the CD association at IRGM arises from an alteration in IRGM regulation that affects the efficacy of autophagy and identify a common deletion polymorphism as a likely causal variant."

Emission inventory models suggest that biofuel burning accounts for 50 to 90% of emissions, whereas the elemental composition of ambient aerosols points to fossil fuel combustion. We used radiocarbon measurements of winter monsoon aerosols from western India and the Indian Ocean to determine that biomass combustion produced two-thirds of the bulk carbonaceous aerosols, as well as one-half and two-thirds of two black carbon subfractions, respectively. These constraints show that both biomass combustion (such as residential cooking and agricultural burning) and fossil fuel combustion should be targeted to mitigate climate effects and improve air quality."
https://openalex.org/W2073167340,"Patrick Gaffney and colleagues report results of a genome-wide association study for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), identifying variants in the TNFAIP3 region on 6q23 that are strongly associated with the disease. In a related study, Lindsey Criswell and colleagues report a similar association between variants near TNFAIP3 and SLE. The same region on 6q23 has recently been associated with rheumatoid arthritis, but only a subset of risk alleles in this region seem to be common to both diseases. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease influenced by genetic and environmental factors. We carried out a genome-wide association scan and replication study and found an association between SLE and a variant in TNFAIP3 (rs5029939, meta-analysis P = 2.89 × 10−12, OR = 2.29). We also found evidence of two independent signals near TNFAIP3 associated with SLE, including one previously associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). These results establish that variants near TNFAIP3 contribute to differential risk of SLE and RA."
https://openalex.org/W2115038037,"Uncertainty about the phase of strings of SNPs creates complications in genetic analysis, although methods have been developed for phasing population-based samples. However, these methods can only phase a small number of SNPs effectively and become unreliable when applied to SNPs spanning many linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks. Here we show how to phase more than 1,000 SNPs simultaneously for a large fraction of the 35,528 Icelanders genotyped by Illumina chips. Moreover, haplotypes that are identical by descent (IBD) between close and distant relatives, for example, those separated by ten meioses or more, can often be reliably detected. This method is particularly powerful in studies of the inheritance of recurrent mutations and fine-scale recombinations in large sample sets. A further extension of the method allows us to impute long haplotypes for individuals who are not genotyped."
https://openalex.org/W2006885855,"Quantum teleportation is the faithful transfer of quantum states between systems, relying on the prior establishment of entanglement and using only classical communication during the transmission. We report teleportation of quantum information between atomic quantum memories separated by about 1 meter. A quantum bit stored in a single trapped ytterbium ion (Yb + ) is teleported to a second Yb + atom with an average fidelity of 90% over a replete set of states. The teleportation protocol is based on the heralded entanglement of the atoms through interference and detection of photons emitted from each atom and guided through optical fibers. This scheme may be used for scalable quantum computation and quantum communication."
https://openalex.org/W1963819091,"The TNFAIP3 (tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3) gene encodes a ubiquitin editing enzyme, A20, that restricts NF-kappaB-dependent signaling and prevents inflammation. We show that three independent SNPs in the TNFAIP3 region (rs13192841, rs2230926 and rs6922466) are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) among individuals of European ancestry. These findings provide critical links between A20 and the etiology of SLE."

https://openalex.org/W2013500926,"Regeneration of injured neurons can restore function, but most neurons regenerate poorly or not at all. The failure to regenerate in some cases is due to a lack of activation of cell-intrinsic regeneration pathways. These pathways might be targeted for the development of therapies that can restore neuron function after injury or disease. Here, we show that the DLK-1 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway is essential for regeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans motor neurons. Loss of this pathway eliminates regeneration, whereas activating it improves regeneration. Further, these proteins also regulate the later step of growth cone migration. We conclude that after axon injury, activation of this MAP kinase cascade is required to switch the mature neuron from an aplastic state to a state capable of growth."
https://openalex.org/W2009639277,"Trans-SNAP receptor (SNARE, where SNAP is defined as soluble NSF attachment protein, and NSF is defined as N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor) complexes catalyze synaptic vesicle fusion and bind complexin, but the function of complexin binding to SNARE complexes remains unclear. Here we show that in neuronal synapses, complexin simultaneously suppressed spontaneous fusion and activated fast calcium ion-evoked fusion. The dual function of complexin required SNARE binding and also involved distinct amino-terminal sequences of complexin that localize to the point where trans-SNARE complexes insert into the fusing membranes, suggesting that complexin controls the force that trans-SNARE complexes apply onto the fusing membranes. Consistent with this hypothesis, a mutation in the membrane insertion sequence of the v-SNARE synaptobrevin/vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) phenocopied the complexin loss-of-function state without impairing complexin binding to SNARE complexes. Thus, complexin probably activates and clamps the force transfer from assembled trans-SNARE complexes onto fusing membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2086295815,"Under strong optical excitation conditions, it is possible to create highly nonequilibrium states of matter. The nuclear response is determined by the rate of energy transfer from the excited electrons to the nuclei and the instantaneous effect of change in electron distribution on the interatomic potential energy landscape. We used femtosecond electron diffraction to follow the structural evolution of strongly excited gold under these transient electronic conditions. Generally, materials become softer with excitation. In contrast, the rate of disordering of the gold lattice is found to be retarded at excitation levels up to 2.85 megajoules per kilogram with respect to the degree of lattice heating, which is indicative of increased lattice stability at high effective electronic temperatures, a predicted effect that illustrates the strong correlation between electronic structure and lattice bonding."
https://openalex.org/W2080654645,"Reaction time (RT) is one of the most widely used measures of performance in experimental psychology, yet relatively few fMRI studies have included trial-by-trial differences in RT as a predictor variable in their analyses. Using a multi-study approach, we investigated whether there are brain regions that show a general relationship between trial-by-trial RT variability and activation across a range of cognitive tasks.The relation between trial-by-trial differences in RT and brain activation was modeled in five different fMRI datasets spanning a range of experimental tasks and stimulus modalities. Three main findings were identified. First, in a widely distributed set of gray and white matter regions, activation was delayed on trials with long RTs relative to short RTs, suggesting delayed initiation of underlying physiological processes. Second, in lateral and medial frontal regions, activation showed a ""time-on-task"" effect, increasing linearly as a function of RT. Finally, RT variability reliably modulated the BOLD signal not only in gray matter but also in diffuse regions of white matter.The results highlight the importance of modeling trial-by-trial RT in fMRI analyses and raise the possibility that RT variability may provide a powerful probe for investigating the previously elusive white matter BOLD signal."
https://openalex.org/W2002861763,"The reactions of metal clusters with small molecules often depend on cluster size. The selectivity of oxygen reactions with aluminum cluster anions can be well described within an electronic shell model; however, not all reactions are subject to the same fundamental constraints. We observed the size selectivity of aluminum cluster anion reactions with water, which can be attributed to the dissociative chemisorption of water at specific surface sites. The reactivity depends on geometric rather than electronic shell structure. Identical arrangements of multiple active sites in Al16-, Al17-, and Al18- result in the production of H2 from water."

https://openalex.org/W2039279598,"Our understanding of the genetic basis of phenotypic diversity is limited by the paucity of examples in which multiple, interacting loci have been identified. We show that natural variation in the efficiency of sporulation, the program in yeast that initiates the sexual phase of the life cycle, between oak tree and vineyard strains is due to allelic variation between four nucleotide changes in three transcription factors: IME1, RME1 , and RSF1 . Furthermore, we identified that selection has shaped quantitative variation in yeast sporulation between strains. These results illustrate how genetic interactions between transcription factors are a major source of phenotypic diversity within species."
https://openalex.org/W2017176455,"Following infection, naïve CD8 + T cells bearing pathogen-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) differentiate into a mixed population of short-lived effector and long-lived memory T cells to mediate an adaptive immune response. How the TCR regulates memory T cell development has remained elusive. Using a mutant TCR transgenic model, we found that point mutations in the TCR β transmembrane domain (βTMD) impair the development and function of CD8 + memory T cells without affecting primary effector T cell responses. Mutant T cells are deficient in polarizing the TCR and in organizing the nuclear factor κB signal at the immunological synapse. Thus, effector and memory states of CD8 + T cells are separable fates, determined by differential TCR signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2085140645,"Models of the differentiation of memory CD8+ T cells that replicate during secondary infections differ over whether such cells had acquired effector function during primary infections. We created a transgenic mouse line that permits mapping of the fate of granzyme B (gzmB)-expressing CD8+ T cells and their progeny by indelibly marking them with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP). Virus-specific CD8+ T cells express gzmB within the first 2 days of a primary response to infection with influenza, without impairment of continued primary clonal expansion. On secondary infection, virus-specific CD8+ T cells that became EYFP+ during a primary infection clonally expand as well as all virus-specific CD8+ T cells. Thus, CD8+ T cells that have acquired an effector phenotype during primary infection may function as memory cells with replicative function."
https://openalex.org/W1999702498,"Membrane fusion between vesicles and target membranes involves the zippering of a four-helix bundle generated by constituent helices derived from target– and vesicle–soluble N -ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs). In neurons, the protein complexin clamps otherwise spontaneous fusion by SNARE proteins, allowing neurotransmitters and other mediators to be secreted when and where they are needed as this clamp is released. The membrane-proximal accessory helix of complexin is necessary for clamping, but its mechanism of action is unknown. Here, we present experiments using a reconstituted fusion system that suggest a simple model in which the complexin accessory helix forms an alternative four-helix bundle with the target-SNARE near the membrane, preventing the vesicle-SNARE from completing its zippering."
https://openalex.org/W2067154623,"Current emission inventories require an additional ""unknown"" source to balance the global atmospheric budgets of ethane (C2H6). Here, we provide evidence that a substantial part of the missing source can be attributed to natural gas seepage from petroliferous, geothermal, and volcanic areas. Such geologic sources also inject propane (C3H8) into the atmosphere. The analysis of a large data set of methane (CH4), ethane, and propane concentrations in surface gas emissions of 238 sites from different geographic and geologic areas, coupled with published estimates of geomethane emissions, suggests that Earth's degassing accounts for at least 17% and 10% of total ethane and propane emissions, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2069244750,"We constructed a large-scale functional network model in Drosophila melanogaster built around two key transcription factors involved in the process of embryonic segmentation. Analysis of the model allowed the identification of a new role for the ubiquitin E3 ligase complex factor SPOP. In Drosophila , the gene encoding SPOP is a target of segmentation transcription factors. Drosophila SPOP mediates degradation of the Jun kinase phosphatase Puckered, thereby inducing tumor necrosis factor (TNF)/Eiger–dependent apoptosis. In humans, we found that SPOP plays a conserved role in TNF-mediated JNK signaling and was highly expressed in 99% of clear cell renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), the most prevalent form of kidney cancer. SPOP expression distinguished histological subtypes of RCC and facilitated identification of clear cell RCC as the primary tumor for metastatic lesions."
https://openalex.org/W1972750603,"A smoke-free law came into effect in Spain on 1st January 2006, affecting all enclosed workplaces except hospitality venues, whose proprietors can choose among totally a smoke-free policy, a partial restriction with designated smoking areas, or no restriction on smoking on the premises. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the law among hospitality workers by assessing second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure and the frequency of respiratory symptoms before and one year after the ban.We formed a baseline cohort of 431 hospitality workers in Spain and 45 workers in Portugal and Andorra. Of them, 318 (66.8%) were successfully followed up 12 months after the ban, and 137 nonsmokers were included in this analysis. We obtained self-reported exposure to SHS and the presence of respiratory symptoms, and collected saliva samples for cotinine measurement. Salivary cotinine decreased by 55.6% after the ban among nonsmoker workers in venues where smoking was totally prohibited (from median of 1.6 ng/ml before to 0.5 ng/ml, p<0.01). Cotinine concentration decreased by 27.6% (p = 0.068) among workers in venues with designated smoking areas, and by 10.7% (p = 0.475) among workers in venues where smoking was allowed. In Portugal and Andorra, no differences between cotinine concentration were found before (1.2 ng/ml) and after the ban (1.2 ng/ml). In Spain, reported respiratory symptom declined significantly (by 71.9%; p<0.05) among workers in venues that became smoke-free. After adjustment for potential confounders, salivary cotinine and respiratory symptoms decreased significantly among workers in Spanish hospitality venues where smoking was totally banned.Among nonsmoker hospitality workers in bars and restaurants where smoking was allowed, exposure to SHS after the ban remained similar to pre-law levels. The partial restrictions on smoking in Spanish hospitality venues do not sufficiently protect hospitality workers against SHS or its consequences for respiratory health."
https://openalex.org/W1985236576,"Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is characterized by the induction of oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokine expression. Recently demonstrating that oxidative stress and TNF-α each stimulate interleukin (IL)-18 expression in cardiomyocytes, we hypothesized that I/R also induces IL-18 expression and thus exacerbates inflammation and tissue damage. Neutralization of IL-18 signaling should therefore diminish tissue injury following I/R. I/R studies were performed using a chronically instrumented closed chest mouse model. Male C57BL/6 mice underwent 30 min of ischemia by LAD coronary artery ligation followed by various periods of reperfusion. Sham-operated or ischemia-only mice served as controls. A subset of animals was treated with IL-18-neutralizing antibodies 1 h prior to LAD ligation. Ischemic LV tissue was used for analysis. Our results demonstrate that, compared with sham operation and ischemia alone, I/R significantly increased (i) oxidative stress (increased MDA/4-HNE levels), (ii) neutrophil infiltration (increased MPO activity), (iii) NF-κB DNA binding activity (p50, p65), and (iv) increased expression of IL-18Rβ, but not IL-18Rα or IL-18BP transcripts. Administration of IL-18-neutralizing antibodies significantly reduced I/R injury measured by reduced infarct size (versus control IgG).

However, the precise role of IL-18 in I/R injury and its regulation in vivo are incompletely understood, and the signal transduction pathways involved in its induction in myocardial constituent cells in vitro have not been identified.The purpose of this study was to (i) determine the temporal expression of IL-18, IL-18 receptors, and IL-18BP during I/R in vivo, (ii) define the causal role of IL-18 in myocardial I/R injury in vivo, and (iii) examine the signaling pathways involved in simulated I/R (sI/R)-mediated IL-18 induction in isolated adult mouse cardiomyocytes in vitro. Our results demonstrate that (i) IL-18 is induced in vivo in postischemic myocardium, (ii) its neutralization blunts I/R-induced tissue injury, and (iii) I/R up-regulates IL-18Rβ and IL-18BP but not IL-18Rα expression. Further, sI/R enhances biologically active IL-18 expression in primary adult mouse cardiomyocytes via IKK-dependent IκB degradation and NF-κB activation. Together, these results indicate that IL-18 plays a critical role in ischemia/reperfusion injury and thus is a potential therapeutic target for ischemic heart disease.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals-All animal studies conformed to National Institutes of Health guidelines (48National Research Council Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

In brief, male C57BL/6 mice weighing ∼25–30 g and aged 3–4 months were anesthetized by urethane (1000 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and etomidate (25 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and mechanically ventilated with a rodent ventilator set at 150 breaths/min (100% oxygen). Mice were placed on a heated, temperature-controlled operating table for small animals (Vestavia Scientific). Using microscopic dissection (surgical microscope system; Applied Fiberoptics), the chest was opened along the left side of the sternum by cutting through the ribs to approximately midsternum, and the chest walls were retracted with 6-0 sutures. The pericardium was then gently dissected to allow visualization of coronary artery anatomy. An 8-0 Surgipro monofilament polypropylene suture with the U-shaped tapered needle was passed under the LAD. The needle was then cut from the suture, and the two ends of the 8-0 suture were then threaded through a 0.5-mm piece of PE-10 tubing that was previously soaked in 100% alcohol overnight, forming a loose snare around the LAD coronary artery. Each end of the suture was then exteriorized through each side of the chest wall. The chest was then closed with four interrupted stitches utilizing 6-0 sutures. The ends of the exteriorized 8-0 suture were then tucked under the skin, which was then also closed with 6-0 sutures. At 1 week after instrumentation, the animals were reanesthetized and randomly assigned to sham or I/R groups. The 8-0 suture, which had been previously exteriorized, was cleared of all debris from the skin and chest and carefully taped to heavy metal picks. Ischemia of LAD coronary artery was accomplished by gently pulling the heavy metal picks apart until an S-T segment elevation appeared on the electrocardiogram. The electrocardiogram was constantly monitored throughout the entire ischemic interval to ensure persistent ischemia. After 30 min, reperfusion was accomplished by pushing the metal picks toward the animal and cutting the suture close to the chest wall. Reperfusion was confirmed by resolution of the S-T segment elevation, which usually occurred very quickly. An additional four animals underwent only ischemia (30 min of ischemia and no reperfusion). Sham-operated animals were prepared identically without undergoing the I/R protocol. At the indicated time points (Fig. 1A), the hearts were rapidly excised and rinsed in ice-cold physiological saline. The right ventricle and atria were trimmed away, and the left ventricle was divided into ischemic and nonischemic zones and snap frozen in liquid N2.Adult Mouse Cardiomyocytes-Calcium-tolerant adult mouse ventricular myocytes were isolated by modified Langendorff perfusion and collagenase digestion, adapting the methodology described by the Alliance for Cellular Signaling (18Sambrano G.R. Fraser I. Han H. Ni Y. O'Connell T. Yan Z. Stull J.T. Nature. 2002; 420: 712-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (available on the World Wide Web). In brief, mice were given heparin (1000 units/kg intraperitoneally) and then deeply anesthetized with intramuscular ketamine (43.5 mg/kg), acepromazine (1.5 mg/kg), and xylazine (1.7 mg/kg). Median sternotomy was performed, and the heart was rapidly excised and rinsed with physiologic saline. The aortic lumen was isolated and tied to an 18-gauge cannula, and the heart was perfused with oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2), Ca2+-free modified Tyrode's bicarbonate buffer (126 mm NaCl, 4.4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 18 mm NaHCO3, 11 mm glucose, 4 mm HEPES, 10 mm 2,3-butanedione monoxime, 30 mm taurine, pH 7.35) at 37 °C for 5 min. Following this, the heart was perfused with 50 ml of digestion buffer (modified Tyrode's bicarbonate buffer with 0.25 mg/ml Liberase Blendzyme type 1 (Roche Applied Science), 0.14 mg/ml trypsin (Sigma), and CaCl2 2.5 μm) in a recirculating fashion for 12–15 min. The heart was then removed, and the left ventricle (LV) was separated and dissected with small, blunt forceps in 2–3 ml of digestion buffer. The minced tissue suspension was gently agitated by repeated pipette aspiration and transferred into myocyte stopping buffer 1 (modified Tyrode's bicarbonate buffer with 10% fetal calf serum and 12.5 μm CaCl2) in a 50-ml conical tube and allowed to sediment for 10 min. The supernatant was transferred to another tube and centrifuged at 90 × g for 2 min. The sediment/pellet from both tubes were combined and resuspended in myocyte stopping buffer 2 (modified Tyrode's bicarbonate buffer with 5% fetal calf serum and 12.5 μm CaCl2) in a 100-mm culture dish. Small aliquots of CaCl2 were then added in a graded fashion at 4-min intervals to sequentially increase the Ca2+ concentration to 500 μm (five total steps). The suspension was then placed in a 50-ml conical tube and allowed to sediment for 10 min at 22 °C. As above, the supernatant was transferred to another tube and gently centrifuged at 90 × g for 2 min, and myocytes contained in both the sediment and the pellet were combined and resuspended in minimal essential medium (pH 7.35–7.45; catalogue number M1018; Sigma) containing 1.2 mm Ca2+, 12 mm NaHCO3, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were then plated onto 35-mm cell culture dishes precoated with 20 μg/ml mouse laminin in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% penicillin/streptomycin for 1 h. Cardiomyocytes were maintained under resting conditions in the incubator for at least 16 h before experimentation. Ischemia/reperfusion was simulated by incubating cardiomyocytes 30 min in an “ischemia buffer” containing 118 mm NaCl, 24 mm NaHCO3, 1.0 mm NaH2PO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm sodium lactate, 16 mm KCl, 10 mm 2-deoxyglucose (pH adjusted to 6.2), followed by reoxygenation for 4 h. Reoxygenation was accomplished by replacing the ischemic buffer with normal medium under normoxic conditions. All of the studies were completed within 72 h after isolation.Cardiomyocytes were treated with PDTC (100 μm in PBS) for 1 h prior to undergoing sI/R. IKK was targeted by SC-514 (10 μm in DMSO for 1 h). In addition, IKKβ and IκB-α were targeted using adenoviral dominant negative IKKβ or IκBα (dnIKKβ or dnIκBα, respectively), as described previously (19Chandrasekar B. Mummidi S. Mahimainathan L.

Transfection efficiency of cardiomyocytes with these adenoviral vectors is near 100%. 24 h after infection, cells underwent sI/R.Splenocyte Isolation-Male C57BL/6 mice weighing ∼25–30 g and aged 3–4 months were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The spleens from three animals were pooled and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer in RPMI1640 plus 10% fetal calf serum. The cell suspension was then carefully overlaid on His-topaque 1083 (Sigma), centrifuged at 800 × g for 20 min at 22 °C, and the splenic mononuclear cells were carefully collected from the media/Ficoll interface and resuspended in RPMI 1640 plus 10% fetal calf serum. Splenocytes (5 × 106/ml) were incubated with and without cardiomyocyte-derived culture supernatants following simulated I/R and LPS (1 μg/ml) for 24 h at 37 °C. After incubation, supernatants were sampled and analyzed for IFN-γ production by ELISA (n = 6).Adenoviral Transduction-Replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus encoding green fluorescent protein (Ad.GFP), dnIKKβ (Ad.dnIKKβ), and phosphorylation-deficient IκB-α (S32A/S36A; Ad.dnIκB-α) have all been described before (19Chandrasekar B.

After 1 h, the adenovirus-containing medium was replaced with medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. 24 h later, cardiomyocytes underwent ischemia/reoxygenation as described above. Adenoviral transduction did not result in cardiomyocyte death (data not shown).Lipid Peroxidation-Ischemic zones were assessed for lipid peroxidation (22Chandrasekar B. Colston J.T. Geimer J. Cortez D. Freeman G.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1579-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Left ventricular tissue from sham-operated animals at 2.5 h served as controls. Frozen tissues were homogenized in 250 μl of ice-cold 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). After centrifugation, 200 μl of supernatant were analyzed for lipid peroxidation products (malondialdehyde (MDA)/4-hydroxyalkenals (4-HNE)) using a lipid peroxidation assay kit (Calbiochem).Detection of Intracellular ROS-Intracellular ROS levels were visualized using the cell-permeable, redox-sensitive fluorophore, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Prior to undergoing simulated ischemia or ischemia/reoxygenation for the indicated time periods, cardiomyocytes were incubated in medium containing 30 μm non-fluorescent DCFH-DA for 1 h to obtain stable intracellular levels of the probe. Similar concentrations were maintained during simulated ischemia or ischemia/reoxygenation. Upon entry into the cell, DCFH-DA is initially converted into non-fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCFH) by cellular esterase and then oxidized to fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) in the presence of ROS (DCFH-DA → DCFH → DCF). DCF fluorescence was visualized by fluorescent microscopy. The intensity of DCF in the cells indicates increased intracellular levels of ROS. Image acquisition and analysis were performed as previously reported (23Swift L.M. Sarvazyan N. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H982-H990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cells were observed through a Plan-Apo ×60 oil immersion objective mounted on an inverted Olympus microscope with an Olympus LSM GB200 confocal imaging system attached. Excitation of dyes was achieved using the 488-nm line of a 15-milliwatt argon ion laser. All images were collected at room temperature. Mean fluorescence intensity was calculated by averaging area intensities from a number of outlined cells. For each condition described, six images of different cells were collected, and experiments were repeated at least three times.MPO Activity-MPO activity in ischemic LV tissue was analyzed as described previously (22Chandrasekar B. Colston J.T. Geimer J. Cortez D. Freeman G.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1579-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In brief, cardiac tissue samples were first homogenized in 20 mm potassium phosphate (1:10, w/v) and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellets were then frozen (-20 °C) for 12 h. After thawing, the pellet was added to a solution consisting of 0.5% hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide dissolved in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 30 units/ml aprotinin. Each sample was sonicated for 1 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of the supernatant were reacted with a solution of O-dianisidine dihydrochloride (0.167 mg/ml) and 0.0005% H2O2, and absorbance at 405 nm was measured over time. MPO activity is defined as the quantity of enzyme degrading 1 μmol of peroxide/min at 37 °C and is expressed as units/g of tissue (wet weight).Transcription Factor Activation-DNA Binding Activity-Nuclear proteins were extracted from the ischemic zones of the myocardium from I/R-treated mice using a nuclear extraction kit (catalog number AY2002; Panomics, Fremont, CA). Formation of NF-κB protein-DNA complexes in postischemic myocardium and isolated cardiomyocytes was analyzed by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and its subunit composition was analyzed by a supershift assay. In addition, NF-κB activation and its subunit composition were also analyzed by ELISA (TransAM™ TF ELISA kits; catalog number 43296; Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) (19Chandrasekar B. Mummidi S.

Specificity of NF-κB DNA binding activity was determined by competition with unlabeled consensus or mutant NF-κB oligonucleotides or consensus Oct1 (5′-TGT CGA ATG CAA ATC ACT AGA A-3′) oligonucleotides. In addition, labeled mutant NF-κB oligonucleotide also served as a control. In supershift assays, the nuclear protein extracts were incubated with antibodies (1 μg) p50 (sc-7178 X) or p65 (sc-109 X; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 40 min prior to EMSA.

https://openalex.org/W2031917607,"When electrons pair in a superconductor, quasi-particles develop an acute sensitivity to different types of scattering potential that is described by the appearance of coherence factors in the scattering amplitudes. Although the effects of coherence factors are well established in isotropic superconductors, they are much harder to detect in their anisotropic counterparts, such as high-superconducting-transition-temperature cuprates. We demonstrate an approach that highlights the momentum-dependent coherence factors in Ca 2– x Na x CuO 2 Cl 2 . We used Fourier-transform scanning tunneling spectroscopy to reveal a magnetic-field dependence in quasi-particle scattering interference patterns that is sensitive to the sign of the anisotropic gap. This result is associated with the d -wave coherence factors and quasi-particle scattering off vortices. Our technique thus provides insights into the nature of electron pairing as well as quasi-particle scattering processes in unconventional superconductors."
https://openalex.org/W1987703665,"The alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs is a critical mechanism in genomic complexity, disease, and development. Studies of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) indicate that this gene undergoes a variety of splice events in humans. However, no studies have extensively analyzed the tissue distribution in other species or compared evolutionary differences of RAGE isoforms. Because the majority of studies probing RAGE function have been performed in murine models, we therefore performed studies to identify and characterize the splice variants of the murine RAGE gene, and we compared these to human isoforms. Here, using mouse tissues, we identified numerous splice variants including changes in the extracellular domain or the removal of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, which produce soluble splice isoforms. Comparison of splice variants between humans and mice revealed homologous regions in the RAGE gene that undergo splicing as well as key species-specific mechanisms of splicing. Further analysis of tissue splice variant distribution in mice revealed major differences between lung, kidney, heart, and brain. To probe the potential impact of disease-like pathological states, we studied diabetic mice and report that RAGE splice variation changed dramatically, resulting in an increase in production of soluble RAGE (sRAGE) splice variants, which were not associated with detectable levels of sRAGE in murine plasma. In conclusion, we have determined that the murine RAGE gene undergoes extensive splicing with distinct splice isoforms being uniquely distributed in different tissues. These differences in RAGE splicing in both physiological and pathogenic states further expand our understanding of the biological repertoire of this receptor in health and disease."

We found that the A30P mutant accelerates nucleation-dependent fibrillization of wild type (WT) α-synuclein. Electron microscopy observation and ultracentrifugation experiments revealed that shedding of fragments occurs from A30P fibrils and that these fragments accelerate fibrillization by serving as seeds. Immunochemical analysis using epitope-specific antibodies and biochemical analyses of protease-resistant cores demonstrated that A30P fibrils have a distinct conformation. Interestingly, WT fibrils formed with A30P seeds exhibited the same character as A30P fibrils, as did A30P fibrils formed with WT seeds, indicating that the A30P mutation affects the conformation and fibrillization of both WT and A30P. These effects of A30P mutation may explain the apparent conflict between the association of A30P with Parkinson disease and the slow fibrillization of A30P itself and therefore provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of α-synucleinopathies.

Neuropathological features of PD are selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and appearance of intracellular inclusion bodies, referred to as Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites. Ultrastructurally, LBs are composed of a dense core of filamentous and granular material that is surrounded by radially oriented fibrils (1Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M.

The tandem repeat region has been assumed to form an amphipathic α-helix by binding to phospholipid (13Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol.

Recombinant α-synuclein in vitro assembles into fibrils that closely resemble those in brains with PD and dementia with LBs upon incubation at a high concentration at 37 °C with shaking, whereas other synuclein family proteins (i.e. β-synuclein and γ-synuclein) neither accumulate in the brain (1Spillantini M.G.

Assembly of protein into fibrils is usually a nucleation-dependent process that consists of a lag phase (nucleation) and a growth phase (elongation). α-Synuclein fibrillization was confirmed to be a nucleation-dependent process (22Narhi L. Wood S.J. Steavenson S. Jiang Y. Wu G.M. Anafi D. Kaufman S.A. Martin F. Sitney K. Denis P. Louis J.C. Wypych J. Biere A.L. Citron M. J. Biol.

The addition of seeds to the monomer promotes fibrillization by rendering the nucleation process redundant. Not only wild type (WT) fibrils but also A53T fibrils have been reported to act as nuclei for fibrillization of WT α-synuclein (30Wood S.J. Wypych J. Steavenson S. Louis J.C. Citron M. Biere A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19509-19512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated nucleation-dependent fibrillization of WT and A30P α-synuclein and the conformations of WT and A30P fibrils formed in the presence of WT and A30P seeds. We found that A30P seeds accelerated the nucleation-dependent fibrillization of WT α-synuclein more effectively than did WT seeds. Further, A30P fibrils have a distinct conformation from WT fibrils and show a higher level of fragment shedding. The WT fibrils formed in the presence of A30P seeds showed the same character as A30P fibrils, suggesting that the nucleation-dependent assembly of WT fibrils in the presence of A30P seeds results in conversion of WT conformation to that of A30P. Further, the A30P fibrils formed in the presence of WT seeds shared the properties of A30P fibrils. The in vitro results shown here implicate the structural and functional differences among α-synuclein amyloid fibrils, useful for understanding the pathogenesis of α-synucleinopathies. Antibodies-α-Synuclein epitope-specific polyclonal antibodies syn1-10, syn75-91, and syn131-140 were raised against synthetic peptides MDVFMKGLSKC (residues 1-10 with Cys at the C terminus), CTAVAQKTVEGAGSIAAA (residues 75-91 with Cys at the N terminus), and CEGYQDYEPEA (residues 131-140 with Cys at the N terminus) of human α-synuclein, respectively. Peptides were conjugated to m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydrosuccinimide ester-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The keyhole limpet hemocyanin-peptide complex (1 mg of each immunogen) emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant was injected subcutaneously into a New Zealand white rabbit, followed by five weekly subcutaneous injections of 150 mg of KLH-peptide complex emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant starting from 3 weeks after the first immunization. Other anti-α-synuclein antibodies, number 36 (residues 1-10) and NAC2 (residues 75-91), were kindly provided by Dr. Iwatsubo and Dr. Jäkälä, respectively. Expression and Purification of Human WT and Mutant α-Synuclein-Human α-synuclein cDNA in bacterial expression plasmid pRK172 was provided by Dr. Goedert. A30P, E46K, and A53T mutations were induced by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). WT and mutant α-synuclein were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells and purified as described (31Masuda M. Dohmae N. Nonaka T. Oikawa T. Hisanaga S. Goedert M. Hasegawa M. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1775-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined as described (31Masuda M. Dohmae N. Nonaka T. Oikawa T. Hisanaga S. Goedert M.

Fibrillization of WT and Mutant α-Synuclein-Purified WT and mutant α-synuclein (1 mg/ml) were each incubated at 37 °C, with shaking at 200 rpm in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% NaN3. For quantitative assessment of fibrillization, aliquots (10 μl) of assembly mixture were removed at various time points, brought to 300 μl with 5 mm Thioflavin S (Th-S) in 20 mm MOPS, pH 6.8, and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. Fluorimetry was performed using a Hitachi F4000 fluorescence spectrophotometer (set at 440 nm excitation/521 nm emission) as described (32Taniguchi S. Suzuki N. Masuda M. Hisanaga S. Iwatsubo T.

Preparation of Seeds-Purified WT and mutant α-synuclein (7 mg/ml) were each incubated for 96-120 h at 37 °C, with shaking at 200 rpm in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% NaN3. Assembly mixture was diluted in 5 volumes of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and ultracentrifuged at 151,000 × g for 20 min at 25 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 5 volumes of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and ultracentrifuged at 151,000 × g for 20 min again. The pellets were resuspended homogeneously by pipetting in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% NaN3 and used as seeds. Aliquots of seeds or fibrils were solubilized in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, and the concentration of α-synuclein was determined as described (31Masuda M. Dohmae N. Nonaka T. Oikawa T. Hisanaga S. Goedert M. Hasegawa M. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1775-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Nucleation-dependent Fibrillization of α-Synuclein-Purified WT or mutant α-synuclein (1 mg/ml) in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% NaN3 was incubated with seeds (1% of total protein) for 0-144 h at 37 °C without shaking. Fibrillization was monitored by measuring Th-S fluorescence. Semiquantitative Analysis of Fibril Length in Suspended Fibrils-Fibrils formed in the presence or absence of seeds (0.1 mg/ml) were observed at a magnification of ×25,000 by electron microscopy after suspension by pipetting. Fibril length was measured on the photographs, and the populations were calculated. Characterization of Seeds by Ultracentrifugation-Seeds or fibrils formed in the presence of seeds (1.0 mg/ml) were suspended in 5 volumes of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature, followed by ultracentrifugation for 20 min at 109,000 × g. The pellets were resuspended in equal volumes of the supernatant with 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The supernatant and suspension were treated with 5× SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After staining of gels with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) and scanning, the intensities of the α-synuclein band were quantified by Scion Image (Scion Corp.). Aliquots of the supernatants were examined by electron microscopy and used for studies of nucleation-dependent fibrillization. Electron Microscopy-Fibrils, seeds and fibrils formed in the presence of seeds were diluted in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Aliquots of these dilutions and centrifugal supernatants of seeds and fibrils formed in the presence of seeds were placed on 400-mesh collodion-coated grids, negatively stained with 2% lithium phosphotungstate, and observed with a JEOL 1200EXII electron microscope. Dot Blot Assay-α-Synuclein monomer, seeds and fibrils formed in the presence of seeds were diluted in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% NaN3 and spotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was probed with epitope-specific α-synuclein antibodies syn1-10 (N-terminal region), syn75-91 (NAC region), and syn131-140 (C-terminal region) or stained with CBB to detect total protein. Immunoreactivity was visualized using the avidin-biotin detection system (Vector Laboratories) and quantified by scanning as described above. Comparison of Protease-resistant Cores of α-Synuclein Fibrils-Seeds or fibrils formed in the presence of seeds (1.0 mg/ml) were sonicated and treated with 50 μg/ml trypsin or 2 μg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by boiling for 5 min. The solution was treated with sample buffer containing 2% SDS and 8 m urea and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Cytotoxicity Assay-The cytotoxic effect of α-synuclein fibrils was assessed by measuring cellular redox activity with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), as described (33Masuda M. Suzuki N. Taniguchi S. Oikawa T. Nonaka T. Iwatsubo T. Hisanaga S. Goedert M. Hasegawa M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6085-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Briefly, SH-SY5Y cells cultured in a 96-well microtiter plate were treated with 500 nm α-synuclein monomer, fibrils (suspended by pipetting or sonication), or fibrils formed in the presence of seeds. Following a 6-h incubation, the cytotoxic effect was assessed by measuring cellular redox activity. Statistical Analysis-Statistic analysis was performed using unpaired Student's t test. The results are expressed as means ± S.E. of three independent experiments (n = 3). Effect of A30P Seeds on Fibrillization of α-Synuclein-First, we tested the effect of mutations on fibrillization of α-synuclein. As shown in Fig. 1A, both A53T and E46K mutants fibrillized faster than WT, whereas the fibrillization of A30P mutant was much slower than that of WT, confirming the previous observations. Since A53T fibrils can act as seeds for the fibrillization of WT α-synuclein (30Wood S.J. Wypych J. Steavenson S. Louis J.C. Citron M. Biere A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19509-19512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar), we next investigated whether A30P fibrils also act as seeds for WT monomer. We incubated WT α-synuclein with WT, A30P, E46K, or A53T seeds under conditions where WT α-synuclein itself does not form fibrils and analyzed fibrillization (Fig. 1B). Fibrillization was observed following the addition of either WT seeds or mutant seeds. Interestingly, the assembly was faster in the presence of A30P seeds than in the presence of WT or the other mutant seeds. The time required for half-maximal fibrillization was ∼1.5 days with A30P seeds, which is shorter than those with the other seeds, WT (2.5 days), E46K (more than 6 days), and A53T (6 days). In the brains of patients with the A30P mutation, both WT and A30P α-synuclein are expressed. Therefore, a mixture of WT and A30P α-synuclein was incubated with WT or A30P seeds, and the progress of fibrillization was observed in terms of Th-S fluorescence intensity. As in the case of WT α-synuclein monomer alone, A30P seeds accelerated the fibrillization process more effectively than did WT seeds (supplemental Fig. 1). Fibrillization was not observed in the absence of seeds. The time for half-maximal fibrillization was ∼1.5 days with A30P seeds and 3.5 days with WT seeds. Shedding of Fragments from A30P Fibrils-To elucidate the mechanism of the effect of A30P seeds on fibrillization, we utilized electron microscopy (Fig. 2). Many tiny or short fibrils were observed in A30P seeds, whereas relatively long fibrils were predominantly detected in WT, E46K, and A53T seeds (Fig. 2A, v, vi, vii, and viii). This observation was confirmed by measuring the fibril length in these seeds. Short fibrils of less than 100 nm were predominant in the A30P seeds, whereas longer fibrils were detected in the WT and A53T seeds (supplemental Fig. 3A). Before preparation of the seeds, WT and mutant α-synuclein fibrils were uniformly long and showed no morphological differences (Fig. 2A, i, ii, iii, and iv). Therefore, it appeared that A30P fibrils readily fragmented during the process of seed preparation. To test whether the small fibrils could be separated by centrifugation or not, WT and mutant α-synuclein seeds were ultracentrifuged, and the supernatants were observed by electron microscopy. Surprisingly, many tiny fibrils were observed in the supernatant of A30P seeds, whereas such tiny fibrils were hardly detected in the supernatant of WT, E46K, and A53T seeds (Fig. 2A, ix, x, xi, and xii), indicating that A30P fibrils have a higher propensity for shedding fragments than do WT fibrils and that the small fragments are recovered in the supernatant of ultracentrifugation. We then attempted to quantitate the fragmented fibrils by ultracentrifugation. The centrifugal supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with CBB. As expected, more α-synuclein was detected in the supernatant of A30P seeds than in those of WT, E46K, and A53T seeds (Fig. 2, B and C). Next, we investigated whether the tiny fibrils recovered in the supernatant of ultracentrifugation can act as seeds for fibrillization of α-synuclein. WT α-synuclein was incubated with the supernatant of WT, A30P, E46K, or A53T seeds (10% of total volume), and fibrillization was monitored by a Th-S assay. In the presence of the supernatant of WT, E46K, and A53T seeds, a very slow increase of Th-S was observed, whereas fibrillization was accelerated in the presence of the supernatant of A30P seeds (Fig. 2D), as seen in the fibrillization in Fig. 1B. These results indicate that the A30P fibrils readily shed many tiny fibrils that can act as seeds for fibrillization. Shedding Property of WT Fibrils Formed in the Presence of A30P Seeds-Next, we investigated whether or not the WT fibrils formed in the presence of A30P seeds have the same properties as A30P fibrils (Fig. 3A). The WT fibrils formed in the presence of A30P seeds appeared to be morphologically indistinguishable from the WT fibrils formed in the presence of WT seeds before preparation of suspensions (Fig. 3A, i and ii). However, after suspension, many tiny fibrils were shed from WT fibrils formed in the presence of A30P seeds, whereas only a few short fibrils were shed from WT fibrils formed in the presence of WT seeds (Fig. 3A, iii and iv). This was confirmed by measuring the fibril length in these suspensions of fibrils produced by pipetting (supplemental Fig. 3B). After ultracentrifugation, many tiny fibrils were observed in the supernatant of WT fibrils formed in the presence of A30P seeds, whereas few such fibrils were detected in the supernatant of WT fibrils formed in the presence of WT seeds (Fig. 3A, v and vi). Quantitative analysis confirmed that a larger amount of α-synuclein was present in the supernatant of WT fibrils formed in the presence of A30P seeds than in that of WT fibrils formed in the presence of WT seeds (Fig. 3, B and C). These results suggest that WT fibrils formed in the presence of A30P seeds have the same shedding propensity as A30P fibrils. Immunochemical Analysis of α-Synuclein Fibrils with Epitope-specific Antibodies-To investigate the structural differences between WT fibrils and A30P fibrils and between WT fibrils formed in the presence of WT seeds and WT fibrils formed in the presence of A30P seeds, we employed a dot blot assay with three epitope-specific antibodies to α-synuclein, syn1-10 (N-terminal region), syn75-91 (NAC region), and syn131-140 (C-terminal region). As shown in Fig. 4, G and I, syn131-140 stained both WT and A30P fibrils (fibril seeds) almost equally, whereas syn75-91 (Fig. 4, E and I) strongly labeled only WT fibrils. syn1-10 (Fig. 4, C and I) labeled A30P fibrils more strongly than WT fibrils. Similar results were obtained with other independently produced anti-α-synuclein antibodies to the N terminus (number 36, a gift from Dr. Iwatsubo) and anti-NAC antibody (NAC2, a gift form Dr. Jäkälä) (data not shown). These results suggest that the conformation of A30P fibrils is different from that of WT fibrils. Interestingly, dot blot analysis of WT fibrils formed in the presence of A30P seeds showed a pattern of immunoreactivity similar to that of A30P fibrils (Fig. 4, D, F, and I), whereas WT fibrils formed in the presence of WT seeds showed the same pattern as WT fibrils (Fig. 4, D, F, and I). These results suggest that the WT fibrils formed in the presence of A30P seeds have a similar conformation to that of A30P fibrils. WT or A30P monomer showed very weak immunoreactivities to syn1-10 and syn75-91 (supplemental Fig. 2, C, E, and I). WT fibrils showed comparatively strong immunoreactivities to all three antibodies, whereas A30P fibrils showed a distinct pattern (supplemental Fig. 2, D, F, and I), being labeled strongly with syn1-10 but hardly at all with syn75-91. Comparison of Protease-resistant Cores of WT and A30P α-Synuclein Fibrils-In order to investigate the structural differences between WT and A30P fibrils and also between WT fibrils formed in the presence of WT seeds and WT fibrils formed in the presence of A30P seeds, we analyzed protease-resistant cores of these fibrils after digestion with trypsin or proteinase K. Amyloid fibrils in neurodegenerative diseases and other types of amyloidosis are known to be highly resistant to many proteases, and the analysis of protease-resistant cores is frequently used for investigating the structures of various amyloid fibrils (34Miake H.

When monomeric α-synuclein was digested with trypsin or proteinase K, no band was detected (Fig. 5A). In contrast, 8-12 kDa core bands remained when the fibrils were treated with trypsin or proteinase K. Trypsin digestion of the fibrils composed of WT afforded two major bands of 10 and ∼13 kDa (black arrowheads), and a similar band pattern was observed after the digestion of the WT fibrils formed in the presence of the WT seeds. On the other hand, two major bands of 9.5 and ∼12.5 kDa (white arrowheads) with smaller molecular weights than those of the WT bands were detected after the digestion of A30P fibrils and WT fibrils formed in the presence of A30P seeds (Fig. 5, B and C). Similarly, digestion of WT fibrils and WT fibrils formed in the presence of WT seeds with proteinase K, a nonspecific protease, showed three major bands of 10-12 kDa (black arrowheads), whereas one major band of ∼11.5 kDa (white arrowhead) was detected after the digestion of A30P fibrils and WT fibrils formed in the presence of A30P seeds (Fig. 5, B and C). These protein-chemical data strongly suggest that the core structures of A30P fibrils and WT fibrils formed in the presence of A30P seeds are distinct from those of WT fibrils and WT fibrils formed in the presence of WT seeds and further support the immunochemical results described above.

https://openalex.org/W2017048239,"Although much progress has been made toward the identification of innate immune receptors, far less is known about how these receptors recognize specific microbial products. Such studies have been hampered by the need to purify compounds from microbial sources and a reliance on biological assays rather than direct binding to monitor recognition. We have employed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding studies using a wide range of well defined synthetic muropeptides derived from Gram-positive (lysine-containing) and Gram-negative (diaminopimelic acid (DAP)-containing) bacteria to demonstrate that Toll-like receptor 2 can recognize peptidoglycan (PGN). In the case of lysine-containing muropeptides, a limited number of compounds, which were derived from PGN remodeled by bacterial autolysins, was recognized. However, a wider range of DAP-containing muropeptides was bound with high affinity, and these compounds were derived from nascent and remodeled PGN. The difference in recognition of the two classes of muropeptides is proposed to be a strategy by the host to respond appropriately to Gram-negative and -positive bacteria, which produce vastly different quantities of PGN. It was also found that certain modifications of the carboxylic acids of isoglutamine and DAP can dramatically reduce binding, and thus, bacterial strains may employ such modifications to evade innate immune detection. Cellular activation studies employing highly purified PGN from Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus plantarum, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus support the structure binding relationship. The data firmly establish Toll-like receptor 2 as an innate immune sensor for PGN and provides an understanding of host-pathogen interactions at the molecular level."

https://openalex.org/W2058279229,"The Mre11/Rad50/Xrs2 complex initiates IR repair by binding to the end of a double-strand break, resulting in 5' to 3' exonuclease degradation creating a single-stranded 3' overhang competent for strand invasion into the unbroken chromosome. The nuclease(s) involved are not well understood. Mre11 encodes a nuclease, but it has 3' to 5', rather than 5' to 3' activity. Furthermore, mutations that inactivate only the nuclease activity of Mre11 but not its other repair functions, mre11-D56N and mre11-H125N, are resistant to IR. This suggests that another nuclease can catalyze 5' to 3' degradation. One candidate nuclease that has not been tested to date because it is encoded by an essential gene is the Dna2 helicase/nuclease. We recently reported the ability to suppress the lethality of a dna2Delta with a pif1Delta. The dna2Delta pif1Delta mutant is IR-resistant. We have determined that dna2Delta pif1Delta mre11-D56N and dna2Delta pif1Delta mre11-H125N strains are equally as sensitive to IR as mre11Delta strains, suggesting that in the absence of Dna2, Mre11 nuclease carries out repair. The dna2Delta pif1Delta mre11-D56N triple mutant is complemented by plasmids expressing Mre11, Dna2 or dna2K1080E, a mutant with defective helicase and functional nuclease, demonstrating that the nuclease of Dna2 compensates for the absence of Mre11 nuclease in IR repair, presumably in 5' to 3' degradation at DSB ends. We further show that sgs1Delta mre11-H125N, but not sgs1Delta, is very sensitive to IR, implicating the Sgs1 helicase in the Dna2-mediated pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2086313707,"The Lkb1 tumour suppressor is a multitasking kinase participating in a range of physiological processes. We have determined the impact of Lkb1 deficiency on intestinal homeostasis, particularly focussing on secretory cell differentiation and development since we observe strong expression of Lkb1 in normal small intestine Paneth and goblet cells. We crossed mice bearing an Lkb1 allele flanked with LoxP sites with those carrying a Cyp1a1-specific inducible Cre recombinase. Lkb1 was efficiently deleted from the epithelial cells of the mouse intestine after intraperitoneal injection of the inducing agent β-naphthoflavone. Bi-allelic loss of Lkb1 led to the perturbed development of Paneth and goblet cell lineages. These changes were characterised by the lack of Delta ligand expression in Lkb1-deficient secretory cells and a significant increase in the levels of the downstream Notch signalling effector Hes5 but not Hes1. Our data show that Lkb1 is required for the normal differentiation of secretory cell lineages within the intestine, and that Lkb1 deficiency modulates Notch signalling modulation in post-mitotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2067449016,"The role of olfactory marker protein (OMP), a hallmark of mature olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), has been poorly understood since its discovery. The electrophysiological and behavioral phenotypes of OMP knockout mice indicated that OMP influences olfactory signal transduction. However, the mechanism by which this occurs remained unknown.We used intact olfactory epithelium obtained from WT and OMP(-/-) mice to monitor the Ca(2+) dynamics induced by the activation of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, voltage-operated Ca(2+) channels, or Ca(2+) stores in single dendritic knobs of OSNs. Our data suggested that OMP could act to modulate the Ca(2+)-homeostasis in these neurons by influencing the activity of the plasma membrane Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchanger (NCX). Immunohistochemistry verifies colocalization of NCX1 and OMP in the cilia and knobs of OSNs. To test the role of NCX activity, we compared the kinetics of Ca(2+) elevation by stimulating the reverse mode of NCX in both WT and OMP(-/-) mice. The resulting Ca(2+) responses indicate that OMP facilitates NCX activity and allows rapid Ca(2+) extrusion from OSN knobs. To address the mechanism by which OMP influences NCX activity in OSNs we studied protein-peptide interactions in real-time using surface plasmon resonance technology. We demonstrate the direct interaction of the XIP regulatory-peptide of NCX with calmodulin (CaM).Since CaM also binds to the Bex protein, an interacting protein partner of OMP, these observations strongly suggest that OMP can influence CaM efficacy and thus alters NCX activity by a series of protein-protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2050355159,"Apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum has been implicated in the invasion of host erythrocytes and is an important vaccine candidate. We have previously described a 20-residue peptide, R1, that binds to AMA1 and subsequently blocks parasite invasion. Because this peptide appears to target a site critical for AMA1 function, it represents an important lead compound for anti-malarial drug development. However, the effectiveness of this peptide inhibitor was limited to a subset of parasite isolates, indicating a requirement for broader strain specificity. Furthermore, a barrier to the utility of any peptide as a potential therapeutic is its susceptibility to rapid proteolytic degradation. In this study, we sought to improve the proteolytic stability and AMA1 binding properties of the R1 peptide by systematic methylation of backbone amides (N-methylation). The inclusion of a single N-methyl group in the R1 peptide backbone dramatically increased AMA1 affinity, bioactivity, and proteolytic stability without introducing global structural alterations. In addition, N-methylation of multiple R1 residues further improved these properties. Therefore, we have shown that modifications to a biologically active peptide can dramatically enhance activity. This approach could be applied to many lead peptides or peptide therapeutics to simultaneously optimize a number of parameters.

According to World Health Organization reports, almost half of the world human population is at risk of contracting malaria and approximately one million people are killed by this disease each year, most of which are young children. No reliable vaccine currently exists against Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes the most severe form of malaria, and parasites are becoming increasingly resistant to previously effective pharmaceuticals (1Ridley R.G. Nature. 2002; 415: 686-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Thus, novel strategies to combat this disease are urgently required. Proteins involved in the erythrocytic stage of the parasite life cycle represent attractive targets for anti-malarial therapeutics, because this stage is responsible for the clinical symptoms of malaria. Apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) 3The abbreviations used are: AMA1, apical membrane antigen 1; MTBD, 7-methyl-1,5,7-triazabicyclo-[4.4.0]-dec-5-ene; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; mAb, monoclonal antibody; HBTU, 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3,-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate; DMF, dimethylformamide; DCM, dichloromethane; TNBS, 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid; SPR, surface plasmon resonance. is an integral membrane protein common to all Plasmodium species that is thought to be important for parasite invasion of host red blood cells and hepatocytes (2Silvie O.

Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 706-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms of the role of AMA1 in parasite invasion are unknown, but recent evidence suggests that it is involved in stabilizing the binding of the invasive form of the parasite to the erythrocyte (3Triglia T. Healer J. Caruana S.R. Hodder A.N. Anders R.F. Crabb B.S. Cowman A.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 706-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 4Mitchell G.H. Thomas A.W. Margos G. Dluzewski A.R. Bannister L.H. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In animal models, immunization with recombinant AMA1 induces protection from subsequent parasite challenge (5Anders R.F. Crewther P.E. Edwards S. Margetts M. Matthew M.L. Pollock B. Pye D. Vaccine. 1998; 16: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 6Collins W.E. Pye D. Crewther P.E. Vandenberg K.L. Galland G.G. Sulzer A.J. Kemp D.J. Edwards S.J. Coppel R.L. Sullivan J.S.

Healer J. Caruana S.R. Hodder A.N. Anders R.F. Crabb B.S. Cowman A.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 706-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 7Hehl A.B. Lekutis C. Grigg M.E. Bradley P.J.

AMA1 has therefore received much attention as a potential vaccine candidate or drug target. Although lacking the major structural diversity of some other P. falciparum antigens, AMA1 exhibits allelic variation that is a result of point mutations. Because immunization with AMA1 induces inhibitory antibodies that are less effective against heterologous parasite lines (8Healer J. Murphy V. Hodder A.N. Masciantonio R. Gemmill A.W. Anders R.F.

Immun. 2002; 70: 6948-6960Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), overcoming this diversity is a key hurdle in the development of AMA1-based anti-malarials. An immune response or drug would therefore ideally target a conserved region that is required for function. In addition to polyclonal and mAbs that bind to AMA1 and block parasite invasion in vitro (9Hodder A.N. Crewther P.E. Anders R.F. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 3286-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 11Dutta S. Haynes J.D. Barbosa A. Ware L.A. Snavely J.D. Moch J.K. Thomas A.W. Lanar D.E. Infect.

Casey J.L. Coley A.M. Masciantonio R. Sabo J.K. Keizer D.W. Lee E.F. McMahon A. Norton R.S. Anders R.F. Foley M. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 6981-6989Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 14Li F.

The most potent peptide inhibitor of invasion was the recently identified 20-residue peptide, R1 (13Harris K.S. Casey J.L. Coley A.M. Masciantonio R. Sabo J.K. Keizer D.W. Lee E.F. McMahon A. Norton R.S. Anders R.F. Foley M. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 6981-6989Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Peptides that recognize functional sites and act as biological agonists or antagonists can be useful for the design of small molecule mimics, or as therapeutics per se. The R1 peptide is an important lead compound for drug development, because its ability to block parasite growth indicates that it targets a site critical for AMA1 function. However, of the four parasite lines tested, the R1 peptide was only effective against the 3D7 and D10 strains, and not HB3 or W2mef, limiting its utility as a therapeutic agent in its current form. A further barrier to the general use of peptides as pharmaceuticals is that they are rapidly degraded by peptidases and proteases in biological fluids, leading to poor bioavailability (15Egleton R.D. Davis T.P. Peptides. 1997; 18: 1431-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to modify the R1 peptide to improve its pharmaceutical potential and AMA1-binding properties. The methylation of backbone amides (N-methylation) is one strategy of peptide modification that has been employed to confer superior characteristics on a lead peptide. This involves the replacement of residues within a peptide sequence with the corresponding N-methyl amino acid, subtly changing the peptide backbone. The introduction of a methyl group into a peptide has the advantage of substantially improving a number of pharmacokinetically useful parameters, including membrane permeability, conformational flexibility, and proteolytic stability (16Fairlie D.P. Abbenante G. March D.R. Curr. Med. Chem. 1995; 2: 654-686Google Scholar). Additionally, it results in a loss of hydrogen bonding potential at the affected site, reducing the role of mainchain hydrogen bonds at a binding interface and potentially altering binding properties (17Bergseng E. Xia J. Kim C.Y. Khosla C. Sollid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21791-21796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). There are a number of examples of N-methyl amino acid containing peptides with a range of bioactivities, including antibiotic (18Ebata M. Takahashi Y. Otsuka H. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1966; 39: 2535-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), anti-viral (19Pettit G.R. Kamano Y. Herald C.L. Fujii Y. Kizu H. Boyd M.R. Boettner F.E. Doubek D.L. Schmidt J.M. Chapuis J.C. Michel C. Tetrahedron. 1993; 49: 9151-9170Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar), anti-cancer (20Ramanjulu J.M. Ding X.B. Joullie M.M. Li W.R. J. Org. Chem. 1997; 62: 4961-4969Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and immunosuppressant activities (21Wenger R.M. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1984; 67: 502-525Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Importantly, modification of biologically active peptides by the inclusion of N-methyl amino acids into an original sequence has been shown to enhance the potency (22Dechantsreiter M.A. Planker E. Matha B. Lohof E. Holzemann G. Jonczyk A. Goodman S.L. Kessler H. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 3033-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar), change the receptor subtype selectivity (23Rajeswaran W.G. Hocart S.J. Murphy W.A. Taylor J.E. Coy D.H. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 1305-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and stabilize a peptide toward proteolytic degradation in a biological system (24Bruehlmeier M. Garayoa E.G. Blanc A. Holzer B. Gergely S. Tourwe D. Schubiger P.A. Blauenstein P. Nucl. Med. Biol. 2002; 29: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This approach therefore offers the potential to optimize multiple parameters simultaneously. In this study, we systematically N-methylate residues within the previously identified AMA1-binding peptide, R1, and describe the synthesis and altered properties of these mono-, di-, and tri-N-methylated R1 derivatives. To introduce an N-methyl group into residues for which an N-methyl analogue is not commercially available, we used on-resin N-methylation (25Miller S.C. Scanlan T.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 2301-2302Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar), facilitating a comprehensive N-methyl scan of the R1 peptide. Analysis of each of these R1 derivatives revealed that inclusion of a single N-methyl group was sufficient to dramatically improve AMA1 affinity, bioactivity, and peptide stability without altering the global peptide structure. Moreover, the introduction of multiple N-methyl groups further increased AMA1 affinity and slightly improved recognition of AMA1 derived from different parasite lines. This represents a substantial step forward in the design of an effective anti-malarial compound able to bind to AMA1 and inhibit malarial parasite growth. Furthermore, this work may contribute to the development of a rational strategy for modulating and optimizing the activity of bioactive peptides. Materials-Chlorotrityl resin, N,N-diisopropylethylamine, piperidine, hydroxybenzotriazole, HBTU were all obtained from GLBiochem, Shanghai, China. DMF, DCM, diethyl ether, and 2-mercaptoethanol were obtained from Ajax Chemicals (Melbourne, Australia). MTBD, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, methyl triflate, o-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride, chloranil, and TNBS were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The N-methyl amino acids Fmoc-NMe-Val-OH, Fmoc-NMe-Phe-OH, Fmoc-NMe-Ala-OH, Fmoc-NMe-Leu-OH, Fmoc-NMe-Ile-OH, Fmoc-NMe-Met-OH, and Fmoc-Ser-OH were obtained from Peptide Solutions (Melbourne, Australia). Fmoc-NMe-Arg(Mtr)-OH was obtained from Chem Impex (Wood Dale, IL). Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH, Fmoc-His(Trt)-OH, Fmoc-Ser(tBu)-OH, and Fmoc-Glu(OtBu)-OH were obtained from GLBiochem and incorporated into the sequence as N-methyl residues by the “on-resin” method of Miller and Scanlan (25Miller S.C. Scanlan T.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 2301-2302Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Derivatization of the Resin-Chlorotrityl resin (1.0 g, 1 mmol) was suspended in dry DCM (10 ml). Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH (1 mmol) was dissolved in dry DCM (10 ml), and the solution was added to the resin. N,N-diisopropylethylamine (4 mmol, 680 μl) was added, and the solution was stirred for 2 h. After this time methanol (1 ml) was added, and the solution was stirred for another 30 min. The resin was washed sequentially with DCM and ether and then air-dried. The loading of Fmoc-Lys(Boc) onto the resin was estimated by the increase in resin weight and was typically 0.5–0.6 mmol/g. Solid-phase Synthesis Protocol-The scale for synthesis was typically 0.5 g and 0.25 mmol. Resin (0.5 g) was washed with DMF (4 × 10 ml) and then treated with a solution of 25% piperidine/DMF (containing 0.1 m hydroxybenzotriazole) for 10 min. After this time the resin was washed with DCM (4 × 10 ml), then DMF (4 × 10 ml), and then a small sample (∼5 mg) was subjected to a TNBS test (26Hancock W.S. Battersby J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 71: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) for the presence of primary amine. The Fmoc-amino acid (1 mmol and 4-fold excess) was activated by dissolution in DMF (2 ml) followed by the addition of a solution of HBTU in DMF (2 ml, 0.5 m) to which was added N,N-diisopropylethylamine (340 μl, 2 mmol). This solution was sonicated for 2 min and then added to the resin. This resin-coupling reaction mixture was agitated for 1 h and then drained and washed with DMF (4 × 10 ml). A resin sample was then tested for the presence of residual amine using the TNBS test (26Hancock W.S. Battersby J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 71: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). If the test was positive then another aliquot of the Fmoc-amino acid was activated, and the coupling procedure was repeated. Where an N-methyl was to be incorporated into the peptide sequence following the piperidine treatment, o-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride (0.75 mmol, 3 eq) was dissolved in dry DCM (4 ml), and the solution was added to the resin together with 2,4,6-collidine (1.25 mmol, 5 eq). This reaction mixture was stirred for 2 h. The N terminus was then methylated by treatment with a solution of methyl triflate (0.75 mmol, 3 eq) and the base MTBD (2 eq, 77 mg) in DMF (4 ml), and the mixture was stirred for 30 min. After this period the resin was drained, washed with DMF (4 × 10 ml), and then treated repeatedly with a solution of 2-mercaptoethanol/1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene/DMF (200 μl/200 μl/4 ml). Usually this procedure involved 3 × 30 min treatments until there was no more yellow color evident in the solution (due to the o-nitrobenzenesulfonyl group). The resin was then tested for the presence of a secondary amine due to the N-methyl group on the N terminus. The next amino acid was then activated and coupled in the normal manner (HBTU). Note that the TNBS test could not be used to detect the secondary amine of proline and the N-methyl amino acids: in this case the chloranil test (27Vojkovsky T. Pept. Res. 1995; 8: 236-237PubMed Google Scholar) was used. Peptide Cleavage from Resin and Purification-Upon completion of the required peptide synthesis cycles the N-terminal amino group was deprotected and the resin was washed with DCM (5 × 10 ml) and lastly ether. The resin (typically 0.8–1.0 g) was air-dried overnight and then treated with a solution of trifluoroacetic acid/dithiothreitol/triisopropylsilyl/H2O (90/5/2.2/2.5, 10 ml) for 2 h. The mixture was then filtered, and cold ether (40 ml) was added to the solution, which resulted in the precipitation of the peptide. The peptide slurry was centrifuged (3500 rpm, 3 min) and the crude peptide was isolated by decanting the ethereal supernatant. The peptide was then dissolved in 30% acetonitrile/water, and the solution was lyophilized. The lyophilized peptides were purified on a Gemini C18 5 μm semi-prep high-performance liquid chromatography column (Phenomenex: dimension, 50 × 21.2 mm; flow, 6 ml/min). Collected fractions were analyzed on an Absorbosphere HD C18 5 μm analytical high-performance liquid chromatography column (Alltech: dimension, 150 × 3.2 mm; flow, 0.7 ml/min). Pure fractions were pooled and lyophilized, and the molecular weight was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. Production of M13 bacteriophage displaying the R1 peptide was carried out as described elsewhere (28Casey J.L. Coley A.M. Foley M. Zachariou M. Affinity Chromatography Methods and Protocols. 2nd Ed. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2007: 111-136Google Scholar). Briefly, K91 Escherichia coli cells harboring the modified phage genome fUSE5, which included DNA encoding the R1 peptide, were incubated in broth culture to produce phage. Phage were harvested by precipitation with polyethylene glycol/NaCl (30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 (Sigma), 2.6 m NaCl) followed by centrifugation and resuspension of the phage pellet in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Phage concentration was determined in colony-forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) as previously described (28Casey J.L. Coley A.M. Foley M. Zachariou M. Affinity Chromatography Methods and Protocols. 2nd Ed. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2007: 111-136Google Scholar). The 3D7 parasite line was cultured essentially as described previously (29Cranmer S.L. Magowan C. Liang J. Coppel R.L. Cooke B.M. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1997; 91: 363-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 30Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6184) Google Scholar), and parasites were synchronized by sorbitol lysis of all but ring stage parasites (31Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2839) Google Scholar). R1 peptide and methylated R1 analogues were assayed for their ability to inhibit parasite growth as previously described (13Harris K.S. Casey J.L. Coley A.M. Masciantonio R. Sabo J.K. Keizer D.W. Lee E.F. McMahon A. Norton R.S. Anders R.F. Foley M. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 6981-6989Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, peptides were diluted in PBS, and 50 μl was added in triplicate to sterile flat-bottomed microtiter wells (Nunc). Complete culture media (50 μl) and synchronized schizont-stage parasites (100 μl) were added to each well (4% hematocrit, 0.3% parasitemia) and plates were incubated for 40–42 h at 37 °C in a moist atmosphere of 94% N2, 1% O2, 5% CO2. After washing with ice-cold PBS, parasites were frozen, then thawed, and relative parasitemia levels were determined by assaying for parasite lactate dehydrogenase activity (10Kennedy M.C. Wang J. Zhang Y.L. Miles A.P. Chitsaz F. Saul A. Long C.A. Miller L.H. Stowers A.W. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 6948-6960Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Absorbance was measured at 650 nm (A650 nm), and the percent inhibition of invasion was calculated as: 100 - [(A650 nm peptide sample - A650 nm red blood cells only)/(A650 nm no peptide control - A650 nm red blood cells only) × 100]. 96-well microtiter plates (Maxisorp, Nunc) were coated with 2 μg/ml recombinant AMA1. The antigen was diluted in coating buffer (15 mm Na2CO3, 34 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.6), and plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Unbound protein was removed by washing with PBS, and any unbound surfaces were blocked with 10% skim milk powder in PBS. R1 peptide or N-methylated R1 analogues were applied to the wells in duplicate in the presence of a constant concentration of R1 phage (∼2 × 109 cfu/ml). Following incubation for 1 h at room temperature, with shaking, unbound phage was removed by washing with PBS 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma). Bound phage was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-M13 antibodies (1:5000, Amersham Biosciences). Binding was visualized using tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma), and the absorbance was read at 450 nm. A Biacore T100 biosensor instrument (32Papalia G.A. Baer M. Luehrsen K. Nordin H. Flynn P. Myszka D.G. Anal. Biochem. 2006; 359: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was used to measure the kinetics of the interaction of R1 peptides and their N-methylated derivatives with AMA1 proteins from different strains of P. falciparum. All immobilization and binding experiments were performed at 25 °C using HBS-EP+ buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.05% surfactant P20, pH 7.4) as the running buffer. AMA1 was immobilized on CM5 sensor chips using standard amine-coupling chemistry. The carboxymethyl dextran surface was activated with a 7-min injection at 10 μl/min of a 1:1 ratio of 0.4 m 1-ethy-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride/0.1 m N-hydroxy succinimide. Coupling of AMA1 to the chip surface was achieved using a manual control approach whereby small volumes (1–15 μl) of AMA1 diluted to 12.5 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, were injected over the activated surface at 5 μl/min until immobilization of ∼1500–2500 relative units was reached (1 relative units = 1 pg of protein/mm2). The immobilization procedure was completed by a 7-min injection (10 μl/min) of 1 m ethanolamine (pH 8.5) to deactivate residual reactive sites. Final immobilized AMA1 levels achieved were as follows: 3D7 = 1530, HB3 = 2705 relative units and W2mef = 2499 relative units. In each experiment at least one of the flow cells on the chip was used as “mock surface” for referencing purposes. This was prepared by subjecting a surface to the amine coupling procedure with no protein present. All biosensor binding experiments were performed in triplicate in HBS-EP+ running buffer at 25 °C. To generate the binding data, a series of peptide concentrations, typically ranging from 5 to 320 nm for 3D7 and from 0.32 to 40.96 μm for W2mef and HB3, were injected over immobilized AMA1 at a constant flow rate of 60 μl/min for 1 min. Peptide dissociation was then monitored by injecting HBS-EP+ running buffer for 5 min, after which time all of the peptide completely dissociated from the AMA1 surface and thus no further regeneration was required. All Biacore sensorgrams were processed using Scrubber software (Version 2, available from Biologic Software, Australia). Sensograms were first zeroed on the y axis and then x-aligned at the beginning of the injection. Bulk refractive index changes were removed by subtracting the reference flow cell responses. The average response of all blank injections was subtracted from all analyte injections and blank sensorgrams to remove systematic artifacts in the experimental and reference flow cells. Scrubber analysis software was used to determine ka and kd from the processed data sets by globally fitting to a 1:1 biomolecular binding model that included the mass transport term (33Myszka D.G. Jonsen M.D. Graves B.J. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The KD was calculated from the quotient kd/ka. Alternatively, for rapidly dissociating interactions, affinity (KD) estimates were derived using steady-state affinity algorithm available within Scrubber. Samples were prepared for NMR analysis by dissolving peptides in 500 μl of 95% H2O/5% 2H2O containing 10 mm sodium acetate to a final concentration of ∼1.7 mm. The pH was adjusted to 4.6–4.7. 1H NMR spectra of most peptides showed a single major set of resonances, indicating that any impurities were non-peptidic (the amide and aromatic regions of one-dimensional spectra are shown in supplemental Fig. S1). Additional peaks with intensities <10% of the main peak were present in spectra of N-Me-Leu-8, N-Me-Leu-8/N-Me-Ser-14, and N-Me-Val-1/N-Me-Leu-8/N-Me-Ser-14. As these peptides were >90% pure, these additional peaks must have arisen from minor conformers. The most likely origin of this conformational heterogeneity is cis-trans isomerism around the peptide bond involving the N-methyl group at Leu-8; this has been observed previously in other N-methylated peptides (34Goodman M. Chen F. Lee C.Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1974; 96: 1479-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 35Trzepalka E. Kowalczyk W. Lammek B. J. Pept. Res. 2004; 63: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Two different preparations of N-Me-Leu-8 showed identical ratios of major to minor species. Two-dimensional homonuclear total correlation spectra with a spin-lock time of 60 ms and double quantum filtered correlation NMR spectra were acquired at 600 MHz on a Bruker DRX-600 spectrometer. Two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOESY) spectra with a mixing time of 250 ms were also acquired at 600 MHz. For N-Me-Leu-8 and N-Me-Val-1/N-Me-Leu-8/N-Me-Ser-14, nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectra with a mixing time of 250 ms were also acquired at 800 MHz on a Bruker Avance 800. Water was suppressed using the WATERGATE pulse sequence (36Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenal V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3527) Google Scholar). All spectra were collected at 5 °C unless otherwise stated and were referenced to an impurity peak at 0.15 ppm or to the water resonance. Translational diffusion measurements were performed for N-Me-Leu-8, N-Me-Leu-8/N-Me-Ser-14, and N-Me-Val-1/N-Me-Leu-8/N-Me-Ser-14 using a pulsed field gradient longitudinal eddy-current delay pulse sequence (37Gibbs S.J.

Spectra were processed using XWINNMR (Version 3.5, Bruker Biospin) and TOPSPIN (Version 1.3, Bruker Biospin) and analyzed using XEASY (Version 1.3.13) (40Bartels C. Xia T.H. Billeter M. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). Chemical shift assignments for the major conformation of the peptides are tabulated in the supplemental material and have been deposited in the BioMagResBank (41Seavey B.R. Farr E.A. Westler W.M. Markley J.L. J. Biomol. NMR. 1991; 1: 217-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). 3JHNHA coupling constants were measured from double quantum filtered correlation spectra at 600 MHz and converted to dihedral restraints as follows: 3JHNHα > 8 Hz, φ =-120 ± 40°; 3JHNHα < 6 Hz, φ =-60 ± 30°. If a positive φ angle could be excluded on the basis of NOE data (42Ludvigsen S. Poulsen F.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), φ angles were restricted to the range -180 to 0°. No χ1 angle or hydrogen bond restraints were included for N-Me-Leu-8 and N-Me-Val-1/N-Me-Leu-8/N-Me-Ser-14. Intensities of NOE cross-peaks were measured in XEASY and calibrated using the CALIBA macro of the program CYANA (version 1.0.6) (43Herrmann T. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). NOEs providing no restraint or representing fixed distances were removed. For structure calculations of N-Me-Leu-8 and N-Me-Val-1/N-Me-Leu-8/N-Me-Ser-14, the constraint list resulting from the CALIBA macro of CYANA was used directly in XPLOR-NIH (44Schwieters C.D.

https://openalex.org/W2042036439,"The telomeric protein TRF1 negatively regulates telomere length by inhibiting telomerase access at the telomere termini, suggesting that the protein level of TRF1 at telomeres is tightly regulated. Regulation of TRF1 protein abundance is essential for proper telomere function and occurs primarily through post-translational modifications of TRF1. Here we describe RLIM, a RING H2 zinc finger protein with intrinsic ubiquitin ligase activity, as a TRF1-interacting protein. RLIM increases TRF1 turnover by targeting it for degradation by the proteasome in a ubiquitin-dependent manner, independently of Fbx4, which is known to interact with and negatively regulate TRF1. Whereas overexpression of RLIM decreases the level of TRF1 protein, depletion of endogenous RLIM expression by small hairpin RNA increases the level of TRF1 and leads to telomere shortening, thereby impairing cell growth. These results demonstrate that RLIM is involved in the negative regulation of TRF1 function through physical interaction and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Hence, RLIM represents a new pathway for telomere maintenance by modulating the level of TRF1 at telomeres."
https://openalex.org/W2064122707,"Versican/PG-M is a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan of the extracellular matrix which interacts with hyaluronan at the N-terminal G1 domain, composed of A, B, and B' subdomains. Recently, we generated knock-in mice Cspg2(Delta3/Delta3), whose versican, without the A subdomain, has decreased hyaluronan (HA) binding affinity, thereby exhibiting reduced deposition of versican in the extracellular matrix. Here, we show that the Cspg2(Delta3/Delta3) fibroblasts within 20 passages proliferate more slowly and acquire senescence. Whereas the extracellular matrix of the wild type fibroblasts exhibited a network structure of hyaluronan and versican, that of the Cspg2(Delta3/Delta3) fibroblasts exhibited approximately 35 and approximately 85% deposition of versican and HA, without such a structure. The Cspg2(Delta3/Delta3) fibroblasts showed a substantial increase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and expression of senescence markers p53, p21, and p16. Treatment of wild type fibroblasts with hyaluronidase and exogenous hyaluronan enhanced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and treatment with an anti-CD44 antibody that blocks HA-CD44 interaction inhibited the phosphorylation. These results demonstrate that versican is essential for matrix assembly involving hyaluronan and that diminished versican deposition increases free hyaluronan fragments that interact with CD44 and increase phosphorylation of ERK1/2, leading to cellular senescence."
https://openalex.org/W2077590028,"The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is a major histocompatibility complex class I-related molecule known to protect IgG and albumin from catabolism and transport IgG across polarized epithelial cells in a bidirectional manner. Previous studies have shown species-specific differences in ligand binding, IgG transport direction, and steady-state membrane distribution when expressed in polarized epithelial cells. We hypothesized that these differences may be due to the additional N-glycans expressed on the rat FcRn, because N-glycans have been proposed to function as apical targeting signals, and that two of the N-glycan moieties have been shown to contribute to the IgG binding of rat FcRn. A panel of mutant human FcRn variants was generated to resemble the N-glycan expression of rat FcRn in various combinations and subsequently transfected into Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells together with human β2-microglobulin. Mutant human FcRn clones that contained additional N-glycan side-chain modifications, including that which was fully rodentized, still exhibited specificity for human IgG and failed to bind to mouse IgG. At steady state, the mutant human FcRn with additional N-glycans redistributed to the apical cell surface similar to that of rat FcRn. Furthermore, the rodentized human FcRn exhibited a reversal of IgG transport with predominant transcytosis from an apical-to-basolateral direction, which resembled that of the rat FcRn isoform.

Proc. Nutr. Soc. 1969; 28: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These functional properties were confirmed to be mediated by FcRn with the subsequent isolation from neonatal rat intestinal brush borders followed by the cloning of the rat homologue identified as a 50-kDa major histocompatibility complex class I-related heavy chain in non-covalent association with a 12-kDa subunit consistent with β2-microglogbulin (β2m) (2Simister N.E. Mostov K.E. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1989; 54: 571-580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since that time, the structural and functional properties of FcRn have been identified for the human, rat, mouse, bushtail possum, pig, monkey, sheep, cow, and horse isoforms with the majority of information available from human and rodent sources (3Yoshida M. Masuda A. Kuo T.T. Kobayashi K. Claypool S.M. Takagawa T. Kutsumi H. Azuma T. Lencer W.I. Blumberg R.S. Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 2006; 28: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In all species identified, a hallmark feature of FcRn is pH-dependent IgG binding. FcRn binds its ligand IgG at acidic pH, but not at neutral pH, due to the conserved presence of basic histidine residues within the CH2-CH3 domain interface of the Fc domain of IgG, which interact with corollary acidic residues within the α2 and α3 domains of FcRn (4Burmeister W.P. Huber A.H. Bjorkman P.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). FcRn is developmentally regulated especially in rodents where it is expressed at high levels within the intestinal epithelium during the first 2 weeks of life prior to weaning where it functions in the passive acquisition of IgG from breast milk (5Rodewald R. Lewis D.M. Kraehenbuhl J.P. CIBA Found. Symp. 1983; 95: 287-299PubMed Google Scholar, 6Gill R.K. Mahmood S. Sodhi C.P. Nagpaul J.P. Mahmood A. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 36: 252-257PubMed Google Scholar). Despite its designation as neonatal, FcRn is expressed in many tissues and cell types beyond neonatal life in most animal species where it has been identified. FcRn has been detected in numerous types of polarized epithelia, including those from the intestines, lung, breast, and kidney, as well as other parenchymal cells, including hepatocytes, endothelial cells, and hematopoietic cells, where it is expressed in dendritic cells, monocytes, macrophages, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and, perhaps, B cells (7Roopenian D.C. Akilesh S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar, 8Mi W. Wanjie S. Lo S.T. Gan Z. Pickl-Herk B. Ober R.J. Ward E.S. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 7550-7561Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). FcRn protects monomeric IgG and albumin from degradation in both parenchymal and hematopoietic cells, is responsible for the bidirectional transcytosis of IgG and IgG antigen/antibody complexes across polarized epithelia, and, finally, directs immune complexes to lysosomes in dendritic cells for facilitation of antigen presentation (9Yoshida M. Claypool S.M. Wagner J.S. Mizoguchi E. Mizoguchi A. Roopenian D.C. Lencer W.I. Blumberg R.S. Immunity. 2004; 20: 769-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 10Qiao S.W. Kobayashi K. Johansen F.E. Sollid L.M. Andersen J.T. Milford E. Roopenian D.C. Lencer W.I. Blumberg R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 9337-9342Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Despite overall similarities in structure with the presence of extracellular α1–3 domains, a transmembrane anchor and a short cytoplasmic tail of ∼42 amino acids, detailed amino acid comparisons reveal significant differences, which may account for reported functional variation between FcRn homologues among different species. For example, rat and mouse FcRn are known to be “promiscuous” in their ability to bind various species of IgG, including human and rabbit. In contrast, human FcRn is more limited in its cross-species IgG binding (11Ober R.J. Radu C.G. Ghetie V. Ward E.S. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 1551-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). “Murinization” of human FcRn by Ward and colleagues has demonstrated that sequences at residue 137 and between 121–132 within the α2 domain regulate the ability of human FcRn to exhibit a broad range of cross-species binding to IgG and thus account for this property of mouse FcRn (12Zhou J. Johnson J.E. Ghetie V. Ober R.J. Ward E.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 901-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, differences in FcRn structure between the various homologues of FcRn can be utilized to focus on regions of the molecule that may control the functions of FcRn and its mechanisms. One of the major structural differences observed between human and rodent FcRn is the presence of a single N-glycan motif in human FcRn within the α2 domain compared with rodent (mouse and rat) FcRn, which contains three additional N-glycan carbohydrate modifications within the α1, α2, and α3 domains (supplemental Fig. S1). This is interesting because the rat N-glycans have been implicated in FcRn-IgG interactions (7Roopenian D.C. Akilesh S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar). Specifically, the N-glycan located at Asn-128 within the α2 domains of rat FcRn has been observed to contact Fc. Human FcRn does not contain this homologous carbohydrate residue (13Martin W.L. West Jr., A.P. Gan L. Bjorkman P.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 867-877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the crystal structure of FcRn has shown that the interaction between the N-glycan associated with Asn-128 forms a “carbohydrate handshake” that helps stabilize the association of FcRn with IgG (14Vaughn D.E. Bjorkman P.J. Structure. 1998; 6: 63-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Still, the physiologic significance of the N-glycans that are associated with FcRn remains unclear. It is interesting that N-glycans have been suggested to be apical targeting signals in other proteins (15Scheiffele P. Peranen J. Simons K. Nature. 1995; 378: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). However, nothing is known with respect to FcRn. Most studies of both human and rat FcRn trafficking in epithelial cells have focused on the cytoplasmic tail, which has revealed the critical role of this domain in basolateral membrane targeting, endocytosis, and transcytosis. Deletion of the hFcRn cytoplasmic tail or point mutations of membrane proximal sites that are functional in calmodulin binding diminish preferential basolateral targeting and redistribute hFcRn to the apical membrane together with a decrease in IgG transcytosis (16Claypool S.M. Dickinson B.L. Wagner J.S. Johansen F.E. Venu N. Borawski J.A. Lencer W.I. Blumberg R.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1746-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 17Dickinson B.L.

Cell. 2008; 19: 414-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Similarly, studies of rat (r)FcRn in rat inner medullary collecting duct cells, a rat kidney epithelial cell line, have shown that deletion of the rFcRn cytoplasmic tail or mutation of serine-313, a site for phosphorylation, significantly diminishes apical-to-basolateral IgG transport (18McCarthy K.M. Lam M. Subramanian L. Shakya R. Wu Z. Newton E.E. Simister N.E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1591-1598PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations of the tryptophan and dileucine motif present within the rFcRn cytoplasmic tail results in increased apical expression due to decreased apical endocytosis (19Wu Z. Simister N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5240-5247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). When rFcRn with green fluorescent protein at the cytoplasmic tail was expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) II cells, endocytosis of rFcRn-green fluorescent protein was observed, but transport of wild-type Fc fragments did not occur (20Tesar D.B. Tiangco N.E. Bjorkman P.J. Traffic. 2006; 7: 1127-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether this was due to structural interference of the green fluorescent protein domain with possible basolateral trafficking information within the FcRn cytoplasmic tail. Another study has also emphasized the significance of the cytoplasmic tail in membrane targeting. When the rFcRn cytoplasmic tail is attached to the ectodomain of FcγRII, the cytoplasmic tail is able to direct the bidirectional transcytosis of IgG across MDCK cells (21Stefaner I. Praetor A. Hunziker W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8998-9005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To date, no prior studies have evaluated apical targeting signals or non-cytoplasmic tail motifs that may be responsible for either human or rodent FcRn trafficking in polarized epithelia. As described above, a major structural difference between rodent and human FcRn is the presence of four, rather than one, N-glycan carbohydrate side-chain modifications within the ectodomains of rodent FcRn. However, the functional role for these post-translational modifications is unknown. We therefore investigated the role of these residues by conferring them upon hFcRn, or “rodentization” of hFcRn, through the addition of amino acid residues into hFcRn that are associated with N-linked carbohydrate substitutions as would be observed in the rodent isoform. Our study shows that addition of the rodent N-glycans to the human homologue, irrespective of their number or location within hFcRn, did not allow for binding of hFcRn to rat IgG. However, rodentization of hFcRn resulted in apical redistribution of membrane-bound FcRn and reversal of the dominant vector of IgG transport associated with hFcRn (predominantly basal-to-apical membrane) to a direction that is typically associated with the rFcRn homologue (apical-to-basolateral membrane) (16Claypool S.M.

The primers used for each mutation and amino acid sequence mutations of hFcRn that were created are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 1. rFcRn and rat (r) β2m cDNA (both a kind gift from Dr. Pamela Bjorkman, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA) were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 and pEF5/V6-HisA (Invitrogen), respectively. Similar to the previous human FcRn construct, an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag (5′-YPYDVPDYA-3′) following a major histocompatibility complex class I signal peptide was inserted to precede the mature polypeptide of rat (r) FcRn (16Claypool S.M.

Stable clones were subsequently selected by ring cloning.TABLE 1Primers used in site-directed mutagenesis utilizing overlapping primers Open table in a new tab Antibodies-Monoclonal antibodies 12CA5 (mouse IgG2b) specific for HA, BBM.1 (mouse IgG) specific for both human and rat β2m, 1G3 (mouse IgG1) specific for rat FcRn, anti-GP135 (mouse IgG) specific for an apical marker in MDCK II cells, and anti-β-actin (Sigma, mouse IgG) were used as described previously (16Claypool S.M.

Polyclonal human and rabbit IgG antibodies (Lampire Biological Laboratories) were used for transcytosis studies. These polyclonal antibodies were first dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane before use. Cells-MDCK II cells with empty plasmid vectors, hFcRn mutant clones, and rFcRn were maintained in medium containing Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, and the appropriate mammalian selection antibiotics at 37 °C with 5% CO2 environment. MH1C1, a rat liver cell line, was maintained in medium containing Ham’s F-12 medium (Cellgro) with 15% horse serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2 environment. IgG Binding-Cells were lysed in CHAPS at pH 6.0 or 8.0 as described previously (22Claypool S.M. Dickinson B.L. Yoshida M. Lencer W.I. Blumberg R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28038-28050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Equal protein concentrations from the lysates were incubated with either 200 μg of human or mouse IgG (Lampire Biological Laboratories) for 2 h followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. Following immunoprecipitation, the proteins were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE gels under nonreducing conditions and subsequently transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (What-man) prior to detection by immunoblotting. Cell Surface Biotinylation-Polarized cells were grown on 12-mm, 0.4-μm polycarbonate membrane Transwells (Corning, Inc.) for at least 72–96 h. Transepithelial resistance was measured before commencement of experiments with a resistance meter (World Precision Instrument, Inc.). The Transwells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently incubated with 1 mg/ml biotin (Pierce) at either or both membrane surfaces for 30 min before washing and quenching as described previously (22Claypool S.M.

The membranes were then removed from the Transwells, and the cells lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay containing Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) at pH 7.4 for 1 h. After centrifugation, postnuclear supernatants were harvested. Equal quantities of protein were used for the study, with 95% of the material used for incubation with avidin agarose for 24 h, and the remaining 5% used for lysate. Following immunoprecipitation, the proteins were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Densitometry analysis was performed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). IgG Transcytosis-Cells were grown to confluence on 12-mm, 0.4-μm polycarbonate membrane Transwells (Corning), and the transepithelial resistance was determined by resistance meter as described above. The Transwells were washed in Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS, Sigma), pH 6 and subsequently in pH 7.4. This was followed by a 20-min equilibration with HBSS, pH 6, at the side anticipated to receive hIgG and HBSS, pH 7.4, at the contralateral side of the monolayer. Human IgG (Lampire) equilibrated in HBSS, pH 6, was added to the input chamber of the Transwell and allowed to incubate for 120 min at 37 °C with 5% CO2 environment. The output chamber fluid was then removed, and the hIgG concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. For experiments using rabbit IgG blocking, rabbit polyclonal IgG (Lampire) equilibrated in HBSS, pH 6, was added at the time of HBSS, pH 6, equilibration prior to the addition of hIgG. Statistics-Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t test. p < 0.05 was determined to be significant. Functional Expression of Human FcRn Mutants and Rat FcRn in MDCK II Cells-To generate mutant hFcRn expressing additional N-glycans that mimic those that are contained within rFcRn, nucleotide sequences of the corresponding hFcRn region were mutated to encode NX(T/S) to allow posttranslational modification with N-glycan carbohydrate (supplemental Fig. S1 and Fig. 1). For each clone, a negative control was created by modifying the sequence to contain the motif QX(T/S), which we defined as (m) mutant (Fig. 1). In this case, an asparagine residue was substituted with a conservative glutamine that does not allow for N-glycan addition. Different numbers, locations, and combinations of N-glycans were created as described schematically in supplemental Fig. S2. Using a similar mutagenesis method, hFcRn without any N-glycans was also generated as an additional control (0-hFcRn). These human FcRn mutants and rat FcRn constructs were transfected into MDCK II cells that expressed the corresponding species of human or rat β2m, because we have previously found that this is substrate-limiting in MDCK II cells (22Claypool S.M. Dickinson B.L. Yoshida M. Lencer W.I. Blumberg R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28038-28050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The transfectants were then examined for expression of the corresponding proteins. As shown in Fig. 2A (lane 4), the wild-type human FcRn protein was observed as a band of ∼40–43 kDa, which is consistent with the predicted molecular mass of hFcRn. As predicted, the addition of each N-glycan moiety increased the molecular mass of hFcRn by 1.5–3 kDa (Fig. 2A). As such, hFcRn that had been modified to contain an additional carbohydrate side-chain modification at the corresponding position within the α1 domain (1-hFcRn), α2 domain (3-hFcRn), or α3 domain (4-hFcRn) migrated as a band of ∼45 kDa (Fig. 2A). hFcRn that had been mutated to contain the non-glycosylating sequence, QS(T/S), within the α1 (1m-hFcRn), α2 (3m-FcRn), and α3 (4m-hFcRn) domains expressed the same molecular masses as that of wild-type hFcRn (Fig. 2A, lanes 10, 16, and 22). All hFcRn clones and mutants expressed hβ2m (data not shown). hFcRn, which encoded different combinations of rodent-like carbohydrate side-chain modifications, were also generated (supplemental Fig. S2). Characterization of these hFcRn isoforms after transfection into MDCK II cells are shown in Fig. 2B. These clones included hFcRn with two additional carbohydrate side-chain modifications at positions 1 and 3 (as per nomenclature described in supplemental Figs. S1 and S2) (123-hFcRn), positions 1 and 4 (124-hFcRn), and positions 3 and 4 (234-hFcRn). In comparison to WT-hFcRn (Fig. 2B, lane 1), with the addition of two N-glycan carbohydrates, all of these isoforms migrated as a glycoprotein of ∼50 kDa (Fig. 2B, lanes 5, 9, and 13). Finally, a fully rodentized version of hFcRn (4N-hFcRn) was created that contained N-glycan carbohydrate at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 (supplemental Fig. S2). When expressed in MDCK II cells, the 4N-hFcRn migrated as a protein of ∼52 kDa, which is identical to that of wild-type rat FcRn (Fig. 2C, lane 5 and 9). On the other hand, the hFcRn clone that had no N-glycans (0-hFcRn) migrated as a ∼37-kDa protein (Fig. 2C, lane 17), which is the same molecular mass as all clones that had been subjected to peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) digestion, an enzyme that removes all N-glycan carbohydrate side chains, resulting in only the “deglycosylated” protein. The characteristics of the N-glycan(s) expressed by the various FcRn isoforms created were characterized by sensitivity to endoglycosidase H (Endo H), which cleaves only high mannose carbohydrate residues from N-linked glycoproteins, and PNGase F, which cleaves all forms of N-glycan carbohydrate side-chain residues, including high mannose and complex N-glycan isoforms. The addition of Endo H resulted in deglycosylation of only high mannose FcRn isoforms but not that of FcRn with complex N-glycans and thus resulted in the generation of a band at ∼37 kDa, which is consistent with a deglycosylated FcRn heavy chain (arrow in Fig. 2A, lanes 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, and 23; Fig. 2B, lanes 2, 6, 10, and 14; and Fig. 2C, lanes 6, 10, and 13). After Endo H digestion, in addition to the deglycosylated FcRn heavy chain, an upper band representing FcRn with complex N-glycans that remained resistant to Endo H digestion was detected in each clone examined. On the other hand, PNGase F removes both high mannose (immature) and complex (mature) N-glycans, resulting in only the deglycosylated FcRn heavy chain. In each case, PGNase F digestion resulted in complete digestion of all FcRn heavy chains leading to the generation of a deglycosylated hFcRn, which was of the same molecular weight as that of the 0-hFcRn heavy chain (Fig. 2A, lanes 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24; Fig. 2B, lanes 4, 8, 12, and 16; and Fig. 2C, lanes 8, 12, 16, and 20). All mutant hFcRn clones thus expressed N-glycans with both high mannose and complex N-glycan carbohydrate isoforms. Addition of N-Glycan(s) on hFcRn Does Not Confer Binding to Mouse IgG-Previous studies have shown that hFcRn can only bind to IgG from a limited range of species. Specifically, human FcRn can only bind to human and rabbit IgG, whereas rodent FcRn can bind to a broad range of IgG species, including those of mouse, rat, human, and rabbit (11Ober R.J. Radu C.G. Ghetie V. Ward E.S. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 1551-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The fully rodentized hFcRn (4N-hFcRn), along with 0-hFcRn, WT-hFcRn, and WT rFcRn, were used to determine whether addition of N-glycan(s) to hFcRn would allow for hFcRn binding to mouse IgG. MDCK II cells expressing these various hFcRn isoforms and rFcRn were lysed in CHAPS at pH 6 or pH 8, and the lysates were subsequently incubated with either human or mouse IgG. Protein G-Sepharose was then added to allow for binding to human or mouse IgG as performed previously (16Claypool S.M. Dickinson B.L. Wagner J.S. Johansen F.E. Venu N. Borawski J.A. Lencer W.I. Blumberg R.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1746-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 22Claypool S.M. Dickinson B.L. Yoshida M. Lencer W.I. Blumberg R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28038-28050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Mouse IgG was used rather than rat IgG, because protein G-Sepharose is known to bind poorly to rat IgG. Precipitates of FcRn-IgG-Protein G-Sepharose complexes were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. Detection of the HA tag expressed on all hFcRn clones, as defined by immunoblotting with the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody, showed that 0-hFcRn, WT-hFcRn, WT-rFcRn, and the fully rodentized hFcRn (4N-hFcRn) exhibited pH-dependent binding to human IgG at pH 6 (Fig. 3A, lanes 7–10) but not pH 8 (Fig. 3B, lanes 7–10). Whereas the mature isoforms of WT-hFcRn, 4N-hFcRn, and WT-rFcRn bound to human IgG at pH 6 (Fig. 3A, lanes 9 and 10), both the mature and immature isoforms of WT-rFcRn were observed to bind to mouse IgG (Fig. 3A, lane 15). However, neither the 0-hFcRn, WT-hFcRn, nor fully rodentized hFcRn (4N-hFcRn) demonstrated binding to mouse IgG at either pH 6 (Fig. 3A, lanes 12–14) or pH 8 (Fig. 3B, lanes 12–14). Similar observations were made with all the rodentized hFcRn variants and mutant hFcRn clones (1m-, 3m-, and 4m-hFcRn) shown in Fig. 2 in that none were able to bind to mouse IgG (data not shown). rFcRn exhibited pH-dependent binding to both human and mouse IgG at pH 6 (Fig. 3A, lanes 10 and 15) and not at pH 8 (Fig. 3B, lanes 10 and 15), as predicted (11Ober R.J. Radu C.G. Ghetie V. Ward E.S. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 1551-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Thus, addition of N-glycans to hFcRn to mimic that of rFcRn does not confer cross-species binding to mouse IgG. Interestingly, hFcRn is able to bind to human IgG in the absence of N-glycans. Increased Apical Membrane Surface Expression of Rat FcRn and hFcRn with Addition of N-Glycans-Previous studies have shown that hFcRn localizes predominately to the basolateral surface, whereas rFcRn is distributed to both membrane surfaces (16Claypool S.M. Dickinson B.L. Wagner J.S. Johansen F.E. Venu N. Borawski J.A. Lencer W.I. Blumberg R.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1746-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 19Wu Z. Simister N.E. J.

To determine the effect of N-glycans on the steady-state membrane surface distribution of hFcRn in MDCK II cells, the various transfected clones were grown on Transwells, allowed to polarize before membrane surface labeling with biotin, precipitated with avidin agarose, and subsequently analyzed for protein composition by immunoblotting with the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody. Various amounts of FcRn proteins were detected on both apical and basolateral cell surfaces of MDCK II cells that expressed 0-hFcRn, WT-hFcRn, 4N-hFcRn, and rFcRn (Fig. 4A, lanes 3–10, left blots). Fig. 4A (right blots) shows immunoblotting of the entire protein lysates analyzed in Fig. 4A (left blots) with the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody, to detect each of the different FcRn constructs, and β-actin, to demonstrate equal loading (Fig. 4A, lanes 13–20).

https://openalex.org/W1975346956,"Background The requirements for priming of HIV-specific T cell responses initially seen in infected individuals remain to be defined. Activation of T cell responses in lymph nodes requires cell-cell contact between T cells and DCs, which can give concurrent activation of T cells and HIV transmission. Methodology The study aim was to establish whether DCs pulsed with HIV-1 could prime HIV-specific T cell responses and to characterize these responses. Both infectious and aldrithiol-2 inactivated noninfectious HIV-1 were compared to establish efficiencies in priming and the type of responses elicited. Findings Our findings show that both infectious and inactivated HIV-1 pulsed DCs can prime HIV-specific responses from naïve T cells. Responses included several CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes shown to be recognized in vivo by acutely and chronically infected individuals and some CD4+ T cell epitopes not identified previously. Follow up studies of acute and recent HIV infected samples revealed that these latter epitopes are among the earliest recognized in vivo, but the responses are lost rapidly, presumably through activation-induced general CD4+ T cell depletion which renders the newly activated HIV-specific CD4+ T cells prime targets for elimination. Conclusion Our studies highlight the ability of DCs to efficiently prime naïve T cells and induce a broad repertoire of HIV-specific responses and also provide valuable insights to the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2069096799,"The cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells is a highly dynamic compartment where membranes readily undergo fission and fusion to reorganize the cytoplasmic architecture, and to import, export and transport various cargos within the cell. The double membrane of the nuclear envelope that surrounds the nucleus, segregates the chromosomes from cytoplasm and regulates nucleocytoplasmic transport through pores. Many details of its formation are still unclear. At fertilization the sperm devoid of nuclear envelope pores enters the egg. Although most of the sperm nuclear envelope disassembles, remnants of the envelope at the acrosomal and centriolar fossae do not and are subsequently incorporated into the newly forming male pronuclear envelope. Remnants are conserved from annelid to mammalian sperm.Using lipid mass spectrometry and a new application of deuterium solid-state NMR spectroscopy we have characterized the lipid composition and membrane dynamics of the sperm nuclear envelope remnants in isolated sperm nuclei.We report nuclear envelope remnants are relatively fluid membranes rich in sterols, devoid of sphingomyelin, and highly enriched in polyphosphoinositides and polyunsaturated phospholipids. The localization of the polybasic effector domain of MARCKS illustrates the non-nuclear aspect of the polyphosphoinositides. Based on their atypical biophysical characteristics and phospholipid composition, we suggest a possible role for nuclear envelope remnants in membrane fusion leading to nuclear envelope assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2059309083,"Reactivation of the Epstein-Barr virus from latency is dependent on expression of the viral BZLF1 protein. The BZLF1 promoter (Zp) normally exhibits only low basal activity but is activated in response to chemical inducers such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and calcium ionophore. We found here that Transducer of Regulated cAMP-response Element-binding Protein (CREB) (TORC) 2 enhances Zp activity 10-fold and more than 100-fold with co-expression of the BZLF1 protein. Mutational analysis of Zp revealed that the activation by TORC is dependent on ZII and ZIII cis elements, binding sites for CREB family transcriptional factors and the BZLF1 protein, respectively. Immunoprecipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and reporter assay using Gal4-luc and Gal4BD-BZLF1 fusion protein indicate that TORC2 interacts with BZLF1, and that the complex is efficiently recruited onto Zp. These observations clearly indicate that TORC2 activates the promoter through interaction with the BZLF1 protein as well as CREB family transcriptional factors. Induction of the lytic replication resulted in the translocation of TORC2 from cytoplasm to viral replication compartments in nuclei, and furthermore, activation of Zp by TORC2 was augmented by calcium-regulated phosphatase, calcineurin. Silencing of endogenous TORC2 gene expression by RNA interference decreased the levels of the BZLF1 protein in response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate/ionophore. Based on these results, we conclude that Epstein-Barr virus exploits the calcineurin-TORC signaling pathway through interactions between TORC and the BZLF1 protein in reactivation from latency."
https://openalex.org/W2006855463,"The synthetic ciguatoxin CTX3C has been shown to activate tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive sodium channels (Nav1.2, Nav1.4, and Nav1.5) by accelerating activation kinetics and shifting the activation curve toward hyperpolarization (Yamaoka, K., Inoue, M., Miyahara, H., Miyazaki, K., and Hirama, M. (2004) Br. J. Pharmacol. 142, 879–889). In this study, we further explored the effects of CTX3C on the TTX-resistant sodium channel Nav1.8. TTX-resistant channels have been shown to be involved in transducing pain and related sensations (Akopian, A. N., Sivilotti, L., and Wood, J. N. (1996) Nature 379, 257–262). Thus, we hypothesized that ciguatoxin-induced activation of the Nav1.8 current would account for the neurological symptoms of ciguatera poisoning. We found that 0.1 μm CTX3C preferentially affected the activation process of the Nav1.8 channel compared with those of the Nav1.2 and Nav1.4 channels. Importantly, without stimulation, 0.1 μm CTX3C induced a large leakage current (IL). The conductance of the IL calculated relative to the maximum conductance (Gmax) was 10 times larger than that of Nav1.2 or Nav1.4. To determine the molecular domain of Nav1.8 responsible for conferring higher sensitivity to CTX3C, we made two chimeric constructs from Nav1.4 and Nav1.8. Chimeras containing the N-terminal half of Nav1.8 exhibited a large response similar to wild-type Nav1.8, indicating that the region conferring high sensitivity to ciguatoxin action is located in the D1 or D2 domains. The synthetic ciguatoxin CTX3C has been shown to activate tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive sodium channels (Nav1.2, Nav1.4, and Nav1.5) by accelerating activation kinetics and shifting the activation curve toward hyperpolarization (Yamaoka, K., Inoue, M., Miyahara, H., Miyazaki, K., and Hirama, M.

Ciguatoxin is a lipophilic cyclic polyether with 13 ether rings (Fig. 1) derived from the dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus toxicus (1Yasumoto T. Chem.

Furthermore, it has been shown that ciguatoxin competes with brevetoxin binding to site 5 of Nav1.2 channels by radioactive photolabeling techniques (4Trainer V.L. Thomsen W.J. Catterall W.A.

However, it is still uncertain how ciguatoxin causes pain or how it modulates sensory inputs by changing the activity of sodium channels expressed in DRG neurons. Multiple sodium channel isoforms are expressed in DRG neurons, including both TTX-S (Nav1.1, Nav1.6, and Nav1.7) and TTX-resistant (TTX-R) (Nav1.8 and Nav1.9) Na+ channels (6Rush A.M. Cummins T.R. Waxman S.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2007; 579: 1-14Crossref Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Among these, Nav1.8 might be of great importance for transmitting pain signals, because it is expressed exclusively by primary afferent neurons (7Akopian A.N. Sivilotti L. Wood J.N.

In addition, deletion of the Nav1.8 gene in mice produced mutants that were resistant to noxious mechanical stimuli and refractory to the development of inflammatory hyperalgesia (7Akopian A.N.

Thus, ciguatoxin might preferentially attack Nav1.8 compared with TTX-S Na+ channels, explaining the neurological symptoms of ciguatera. We tested the effects of synthetic ciguatoxin CTX3C on heterologously expressed Nav1.2, Nav1.4, and Nav1.8 channels in either HEK293 or ND7-23 cells. To confirm the preferential effects of CTX3C on Nav1.8 channels, we also tested the effects on chimeric channels formed from the N-terminal domains of Nav1.8 and the C-terminal domains of Nav1.4, or vice versa. Nav1.8 expressed in ND7-23 cells had an apparently increased sensitivity to ciguatoxins compared with that of Nav1.2 and Nav1.4 expressed in HEK293 cells. Data from chimeric channels indicated that high sensitivity to ciguatoxins of Nav1.8 was derived of the N-terminal half of the Nav1.8 molecule.

Chimeras were constructed using the two cDNAs by swapping domains; the N-terminal half-domains (D1D2) of the SNS cDNA were flanked by the C-terminal half-domains (D3D4) of the μ1 cDNA resulting in SS/MM (the first two domains derived from SNS Na+ channels followed by the last two domains derived from μ1Na+ channels), and vice versa resulting in MM/SS, at the junction of the intracellular loop between D2 and D3, corresponding to Pro-918 for μ1 cDNA or Pro-1000 for SNS cDNA. Briefly, the insertion of five bases, GGCCG, at the proline coding codon, C/CC, created the NotI site, GC/GGCCGC, using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Domain swapping was performed at the created NotI sites. Finally, the artificially inserted five bases were deleted using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit. All of the resulting constructs were confirmed with restriction mapping and sequencing using an ABI PRISM™ 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

The transfected cells were used for electrophysiological experiments through post-transfection day 3. Transfection-positive cells were identified by epifluorescence microscopy performed using a 100-watt mercury lamp and a standard fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Single isolated green fluorescent cells were then studied as described below. Solutions and Chemicals-The bath solution contained 70 mm NaCl, 67 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). TTX (0.3 μm) was added only when currents from ND7-23 cells were recorded to eliminate INa other than Nav1.8. The pipette solution contained 70 mm CsF, 60 mm CsCl, 12 mm NaF, 5 mm EGTA, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Ciguatoxin congeners, CTX3C, and 51-hydroxy-CTX3C (51-OH-CTX3C) were synthesized de novo by the method described previously (18Hirama M. Oishi T. Uehara H. Inoue M. Maruyama M. Oguri H. Satake M.

The stock solution of the ciguatoxin congeners (1 mm) in DMSO was diluted with bath solution to a final concentration of 0.1–10 μm. Bath solution was continuously supplied at a rate of 2 ml min–1. Separately, as described previously (21Yamaoka K. Inoue M. Miyahara H. Miyazaki K. Hirama M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 142: 879-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), CTX3C solution was directly infused into the bath chamber with siphon and vacuum tubing in a Y configuration, so that the cells under study were positioned in the center of the stream. Electrophysiological Recording and Data Analysis-Macroscopic INa from transfected cells was measured using the whole-cell patch clamp method. Whole-cell patch pipettes with a resistance of 1.5–3 megohms were used to achieve optimum voltage control. Whole-cell currents (filtered at 10 kHz) were recorded using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments; Foster City, CA), and more than 80% of the series resistance was compensated to minimize voltage errors. Recordings were started 10 min after establishing a whole-cell recording configuration. Whole-cell membrane currents were digitized at a sampling rate of 50–100 kHz with a 12-bit analogue-to-digital converter (DigiData 1321A interface; Axon Instruments), controlled by pClamp software (version 8; Axon Instruments). INa was determined by subtraction of linear capacitative and leak current with the P/4 protocol (22Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1974; 63: 533-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) in all experiments, except for the case where a relatively large background current was induced with CTX3C or those that were undertaken to measure the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation. All experiments were conducted at room temperature (22–24 °C). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. along with the number of observations (n), unless otherwise stated. Statistically significant differences between group means were determined by the Student's t test for paired or unpaired observations, as appropriate. The criterion for statistical significance was p < 0.05. Ciguatoxin-induced Background Currents through Na+ Channels-It has been demonstrated that at least 1 μm CTX3C is necessary to modulate Nav1.2, Nav1.4, and Nav1.5 channels (21Yamaoka K. Inoue M. Miyahara H. Miyazaki K. Hirama M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 142: 879-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) when the holding potential is kept at –140 mV. In this study, the holding potential was set at –100 mV. Under these conditions, 0.1 μm CTX3C was sufficient to induce activation of Nav1.2 (data not shown) and Nav1.4 channels expressed in HEK293 cells, as demonstrated by a negative shift of threshold potential, a shortening of time to peak, and a suppression of the amplitude of the sodium current INa (Fig. 2B). In the presence of TTX (0.3 μm), we recorded the INa of Nav1.8 channels expressed in ND7-23 cells (23Dunn P.M. Coote P.R. Wood J.N. Burgess G.M. Rang H.P. Brain Res. 1991; 545: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the functional expression of which is enhanced with cotransfection of p11 as reported previously (16John V.H. Main M.J.

Baker M.D. Poon W.Y. Kong H. Chao M.V. Wood J.N. Nature. 2002; 417: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Nav1.8 channels were activated and reached maximum currents at more depolarized potentials (from –50 to –30 mV for threshold and from –10 to +10 mV for peak potentials) and were inactivated with a 10 times slower time course than those of Nav1.4 (Fig. 2C). The most prominent difference between Nav1.4 and Nav1.8 channels was that background (or leak) currents were induced in the latter without depolarizing pulses at –100 mV (Fig. 3). CTX3C (0.1 μm) induced a large current of more than 400 pA in Nav1.8, but not in Nav1.4 (∼6 pA), when no depolarizing pulses were applied from a holding potential of –100 mV, although both cells exhibited comparable maximum peak currents (–2,650 pA versus –2,370 pA for Nav1.8 and Nav1.4, respectively) in the absence of CTX3C.FIGURE 3Spontaneous induction of sustained current by CTX3C without depolarized steps. The membrane was continuously clamped at –100 mV during the perfusion of 0.1 μm CTX3C. This induced a spontaneous leak current of ∼6 pA in Nav1.4 (A), but a large current in Nav1.8 (B). Further depolarization to –80 mV (the bottom traces in each panel indicate the membrane potential applied) increased the currents in both Nav1.4 and Nav1.8 channels, but the Nav1.8 channels were already susceptible to inactivation at –80 mV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Quantification of Ciguatoxin-induced Resting Sodium Conductance-As the number of functionally expressed channels varies from cell to cell, it is not appropriate simply to compare the amplitude of ciguatoxin-induced currents between cells. Maximum conductance in the absence of CTX3C (Gmax-control) is a good measure of the number of functionally expressed channels in each cell. Thus, we evaluated the potency of CTX3C to induce background conductance (resting sodium conductance) at –100 mV in the presence of 0.1 μm CTX3C relative to Gmax-control. CTX3C (0.1 μm) induced a resting sodium conductance of 0.84 ± 0.27% (n = 7) relative to the Gmax-control in Nav1.8, which was significantly larger than that in Nav1.4 (0.08 ± 0.03%, n = 5; p < 0.05; Fig. 4). Molecular Determinants of Nav1.8 Exhibiting Larger Resting Sodium Conductance in Response to CTX3C-To test whether the effects of CTX3C on Nav1.8 expressed in ND7-23 cells are derived from ND7-23 cell environment or Nav1.8 molecule itself, we made two chimeras from Nav1.4 and Nav1.8 channels that could be successfully expressed in HEK293 cells: MM/SS and SS/MM. The former contained the two N-terminal domains of Nav1.4 followed by the C-terminal two domains of Nav1.8, and vice versa for the latter (Fig. 4A). CTX3C (0.1 μm) induced a resting sodium conductance of 0.85 ± 0.12% (n = 6) in SS/MM-expressing cells, relative to the Gmax-control, which was significantly larger (p < 0.01) than that of the MM/SS-expressing cells (0.05 ± 0.03%; n = 5), but similar to Nav1.8 in ND7-23 cells. We further tested whether the property of SS/MM could be preserved in ND7-23 cells. SS/MM in ND7-23 cells responded to 0.1 μm 51-OH-CTX3C producing a resting sodium conductance of 0.40 ± 0.20% (n = 4) relative to the Gmax-control, which are comparable with data from SS/MM in HEK293 cells in the presence of 0.1 μm 51-OH-CTX3C, 1.91 ± 1.33% (n = 3). We used 51-OH-CTX3C here, because of a lack of availability of CTX3C. 51-OH-CTX3C had a quantitatively similar effect on resting sodium conductance of SS/MM in HEK293 cells to that of CTX3C (see Fig. 4B). Changes in Sodium Channel Kinetics Induced by CTX3C-Induction of resting sodium conductance by CTX3C might be an extreme form of leftward shift of the activation curve that can be observed using the conductance-voltage relationship (Fig. 5). The voltage dependences of activation of Nav1.4, Nav1.8, and the related chimera (SS/MM and MM/SS) channels in the absence of CTX3C were adequately described by a single Boltzmann distribution; however, the sum of two Boltzmann distributions was required for ciguatoxin-modified Nav1.8 (Fig. 5B) and SS/MM channels. The voltages required for half-maximal activation (Vact1/2; midpoint) and kact (slope factor) for each construct are shown in Table 1. The Vact1/2 for Nav1.8 and SS/MM in control cells was more depolarized by ∼20–30 mV than those for Nav1.4 and MM/SS, respectively, indicating that the high threshold nature of Nav1.8 is derived from the N-terminal domains of the molecule (D1/D2). Ciguatoxin application induced a leftward shift of the Vact1/2 of Nav1.4 to a limited extent (∼3 mV), but more substantially in MM/SS, although the slopes of the two constructs were not notably changed (Table 1). A significant effect on the Vact1/2 was seen in both Nav1.8 and SS/MM; an extra component of the activation curve (the low threshold component) was created in a more hyperpolarized range. The Vact1/2 values for the high threshold component for Nav1.8 and SS/MM, respectively, were depolarized by 11 and 8 mV compared with that of the single component in each respective control (Table 1). In addition, the slope factors of the ciguatoxin-created low threshold components of Nav1.8-expressing and SS/MM-expressing cells were remarkably large (–18.3 ± 2.8 and –17.8 ± 1.4 mV, respectively). The creation of this Nav1.8-selective component may be related to the induction of resting sodium conductance.TABLE 1Ciguatoxin-induced changes in activation properties measured with conductance-voltage relationship* p < 0.05, statistical comparisons were performed using the paired two-tailed Student's t test. Open table in a new tab * p < 0.05, statistical comparisons were performed using the paired two-tailed Student's t test. Depolarizing square pulses to –10 mV from a holding potential of –100 mV in a voltage clamp condition activated the channels and let their currents reach peak values within 0.44 ± 0.05 ms (n = 3) in Nav1.2-expressing cells and 0.43 ± 0.04 ms (n = 5) in Nav1.4-expressing cells; however, this was much slower in Nav1.8-expressing cells as the time to peak for Nav1.8 was 1.51 ± 0.28 ms (n = 6). The values of the time to peaks of the related constructs, SS/MM and MM/SS, fell between these limits (1.01 ± 0.05 ms, n = 3, for SS/MM and 0.76 ± 0.16 ms, n = 4, for MM/SS). CTX3C (0.1 μm) accelerated the activation process of the Na+ channels by shortening the time to peaks by 26.0 ± 8.2% (n = 3) in Nav1.2 and by 11.3 ± 3.3% (n = 5) in Nav1.4, but this effect was significantly larger (p < 0.05) in Nav1.8 (by 31.9 ± 6.9%, n = 6). Again, the related constructs, SS/MM and MM/SS, showed values between those of Nav1.4 and Nav1.8. The suppressive effect of CTX3C on the Na+ channels can be seen in the changes in maximum conductance (Gmax) estimated by fitting conductance-voltage relationships using the Boltzmann equation (Fig. 5). When the activation curve was made of the sum of two components, the Gmax was treated as the sum of each amplitude (Gmax = Gmax1 + Gmax2). CTX3C (0.1 μm) equally reduced the Gmax of Nav1.2, Nav1.4, Nav1.8, and SS/MM by around 18–22%, except in MM/SS-transfected cells, where it was reduced by 37% (Table 1). The steady-state voltage dependence of fast inactivation was evaluated by applying a 500-ms conditioning prepulse to various potentials from a holding potential of –100 mV, followed by a brief repriming interval (500 μs) and finally a test pulse to –20 mV. The relationship between the test INa and membrane potential in the presence and absence of CTX3C was fitted by the Boltzmann equation with two parameters, Vinact1/2 (half-inactivation voltage) and slope factor (kinact). The values of Vinact1/2 in the controls indicated a depolarized voltage-dependent relationship in the steady-state inactivation of Nav1.8, SS/MM, and MM/SS compared with that of Nav1.4 (Table 2). In contrast to activation-curve studies, ciguatoxin did not create an extra component of steady-state inactivation. The slope factors were relatively constant. However, the voltage dependence was partly affected by 0.1 μm CTX3C, as the Vinact1/2 values were significantly hyperpolarized in Nav1.2, Nav1.4, and Nav1.8 (Table 2). The Vinact1/2 was less affected in SS/MM, whereas a large shift of Vinact1/2 was observed in MM/SS (Table 2).TABLE 2Ciguatoxin-induced changes in inactivation properties measured with steady-state inactivation curves* p < 0.05.** p < 0.01; statistical comparisons were performed using the paired two-tailed Student's t test. Open table in a new tab * p < 0.05. ** p < 0.01; statistical comparisons were performed using the paired two-tailed Student's t test. Effects on Rate of Recovery from Slow Inactivation-It has been demonstrated that TTX-R sodium channels show faster repriming kinetics from inactivation than TTX-S sodium channels, and CTX1B further shortened their recovery time, with consequent increases in excitability, such as an easy transition to repetitive firing (3Strachan L.C. Lewis R.J. Nicholson G.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 288: 379-388PubMed Google Scholar). We did similar experiments with a standard two-pulse protocol and a variable interpulse interval (5, 10, 20, 40, 128, 256, 512, 1,000, and 2,000 ms). A conditioning prepulse to 0 mV was used to inactivate sodium channels, after which a 4-ms depolarizing test pulse to 0 mV was applied. A 500-ms prepulse duration was used to fully inactivate the sodium channels. Typical recovery time courses from inactivation for Nav1.4 and Nav1.8 are shown in Fig. 6. In the control, the Nav1.8 channels recovered with two time constants of τ1 = 15.1 ± 3.5 ms and τ2 = 670 ± 238 ms (n = 4), and the relative amplitude between the two components, Aτ2/Aτ1, was 0.27 ± 0.1; the corresponding values for Nav1.4 were τ1 = 32.4 ± 15.6 ms, τ2 = 580 ± 113 ms, and Aτ2/Aτ1 = 1.15 ± 0.24 (n = 5). CTX3C (0.1 μm) slowed the time constants to τ1 = 18.4 ± 4.0 ms, τ2 = 17,500 ± 14,200 ms, and Aτ2/Aτ1 = 0.23 ± 0.03 for Nav1.8 (n = 4), and τ1 = 21.0 ± 9.2 ms, τ2 = 706 ± 252 ms, and Aτ2/Aτ1 = 1.48 ± 0.34 for Nav1.4 (n = 5), respectively (Table 3). From these data, it is difficult to determine which channel has the faster recovery kinetics. For clarity, the available, noninactivated fraction of channels at the 5-ms (R5) and 128-ms (R128) interval are indicated in Table 3. Nav1.8 recovered by 52 ± 4% for 5 ms and 93 ± 0.2% for 128 ms in the control, but this was slowed by CTX3C to 43 ± 7 and 87 ± 13% (n = 3), respectively. Nav1.4 recovered more slowly than Nav1.8 and to a more limited extent (by 78 ± 1.9% in the control and 58 ± 8.3% in the presence of CTX3C during 128 ms). These results do not support the contribution of change in repriming kinetics by CTX3C to the hyperexcitability of DRG neurons, in contrast with the findings of Strachan et al. (3Strachan L.C. Lewis R.J. Nicholson G.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

https://openalex.org/W2015590404,"Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) autoantibodies directly inhibit desmoglein (Dsg) 3-mediated transinteraction. Because cellular signaling also seems to be required for PV pathogenesis, it is important to characterize the role of direct inhibition in pemphigus acantholysis to allow establishment of new therapeutic approaches. Therefore, we modeled the Dsg1 and Dsg3 sequences into resolved cadherin structures and predicted peptides targeting the adhesive interface of both Dsg3 and Dsg1. In atomic force microscopy single molecule experiments, the self-designed cyclic single peptide specifically blocked homophilic Dsg3 and Dsg1 transinteraction, whereas a tandem peptide (TP) consisting of two combined single peptides did not. TP did not directly block binding of pemphigus IgG to their target Dsg antigens but prevented PV-IgG-induced inhibition of Dsg3 transinteraction in cell-free (atomic force microscopy) and cell-based (laser tweezer) experiments, indicating stabilization of Dsg3 bonds. Similarly, PV-IgG-mediated acantholysis and disruption of Dsg3 localization in HaCaT keratinocytes was partially blocked by TP. This is the first evidence that direct inhibition of Dsg3 binding is important for PV pathogenesis and that peptidomimetics stabilizing Dsg transinteraction may provide a novel approach for PV treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2025742782,"Background In several neurodegenerative disorders, toxic effects of glial cells on neurons are implicated. However the generality of the non-cell autonomous pathologies derived from glial cells has not been established, and the specificity among different neurodegenerative disorders remains unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings We newly generated Drosophila models expressing human mutant huntingtin (hHtt103Q) or ataxin-1 (hAtx1-82Q) in the glial cell lineage at different stages of differentiation, and analyzed their morphological and behavioral phenotypes. To express hHtt103Q and hAtx1-82Q, we used 2 different Gal4 drivers, gcm-Gal4 and repo-Gal4. Gcm-Gal4 is known to be a neuroglioblast/glioblast-specific driver whose effect is limited to development. Repo-Gal4 is known to be a pan-glial driver and the expression starts at glioblasts and continues after terminal differentiation. Gcm-Gal4-induced hHtt103Q was more toxic than repo-Gal4-induced hHtt103Q from the aspects of development, locomotive activity and survival of flies. When hAtx1-82Q was expressed by gcm- or repo-Gal4 driver, no fly became adult. Interestingly, the head and brain sizes were markedly reduced in a part of pupae expressing hAtx1-82Q under the control of gcm-Gal4, and these pupae showed extreme destruction of the brain structure. The other pupae expressing hAtx1-82Q also showed brain shrinkage and abnormal connections of neurons. These results suggested that expression of polyQ proteins in neuroglioblasts provided a remarkable effect on the developmental and adult brains, and that glial cell lineage expression of hAtx1-82Q was more toxic than that of hHtt103Q in our assays. Conclusion/Significance All these studies suggested that the non-cell autonomous effect of glial cells might be a common pathology shared by multiple neurodegenerative disorders. In addition, the fly models would be available for analyzing molecular pathologies and developing novel therapeutics against the non-cell autonomous polyQ pathology. In conclusion, our novel fly models have extended the non-cell autonomous pathology hypothesis as well as the developmental effect hypothesis to multiple polyQ diseases. The two pathologies might be generally shared in neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2074814502,"Protein ubiquitination is essential for many events linked to intracellular protein trafficking. We sought to elucidate the possible involvement of the S. cerevisiae deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp2 in transporter and receptor trafficking after we (this study) and others established that affinity purified Ubp2 interacts stably with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 and the (ubiquitin associated) UBA domain containing protein Rup1. UBP2 interacts genetically with RSP5, while Rup1 facilitates the tethering of Ubp2 to Rsp5 via a PPPSY motif. Using the uracil permease Fur4 as a model reporter system, we establish a role for Ubp2 in membrane protein turnover. Similar to hypomorphic rsp5 alleles, cells deleted for UBP2 exhibited a temporal stabilization of Fur4 at the plasma membrane, indicative of perturbed protein trafficking. This defect was ubiquitin dependent, as a Fur4 N-terminal ubiquitin fusion construct bypassed the block and restored sorting in the mutant. Moreover, the defect was absent in conditions where recycling was absent, implicating Ubp2 in sorting at the multivesicular body. Taken together, our data suggest a previously overlooked role for Ubp2 as a positive regulator of Rsp5-mediated membrane protein trafficking subsequent to endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2056103120,"The catalytic mechanism of Propionibacterium acnes polyunsaturated fatty acid isomerase (PAI) is explored by kinetic, spectroscopic, and thermodynamic studies. The PAI-catalyzed double bond isomerization takes place by selective removal of the pro-R hydrogen from C-11 followed by suprafacial transfer of this hydrogen to C-9 as shown by conversion of C-9-deuterated substrate isotopologs. Data on the midpoint potential, photoreduction, and cofactor replacement suggest PAI to operate via an ionic mechanism with the formation of FADH2 and linoleic acid carbocation as intermediates. In line with this proposal, no radical intermediates were detected neither by stopped flow absorption nor by EPR spectroscopy. The substrate preference toward free fatty acids is determined by the interaction between Arg-88 and Phe-193, and the reaction rate is strongly affected by replacement of these amino acids, indicating that the efficiency of the hydrogen transfer relies on a fixed distance between the free carboxyl group and the N-5 atom of FAD.

Recently, we reported the crystal structure of a FAD-dependent PUFA isomerase from Propionibacterium acnes (PAI) in complex with (10E,12Z)-CLA (7Liavonchanka A. Hornung E. Feussner I. Rudolph M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2576-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and proposed a viable reaction mechanism involving the transient oxidation of LA by FAD (Fig. 1A). Thus, PAI belongs to a functionally diverse group of flavoenzymes catalyzing reactions with no net redox change (8Bornemann S. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Similar to other PUFA isomerases described so far, PAI prefers free fatty acids as substrates (9Hornung E. Krueger C. Pernstich C. Gipmans M. Porzel A. Feussner I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1738: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which can be rationalized by the crystal structure (7Liavonchanka A. Hornung E. Feussner I. Rudolph M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2576-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 10Liavonchanka A. Hornung E. Feussner I. Rudolph M. Acta Crystallograph. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2006; 62: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The carboxylate group of the fatty acid is hydrogen bonded to Arg-88, which itself interacts via π-stacking with Phe-193 (Fig. 1B). This Arg/Phe lock ensures selectivity for fatty acids, and the interaction with unpolar and bulky head groups such as fatty acid methyl esters, triacylglycerols, or phospholipids is sterically and electrostatically unfavorable. Moreover, the structural model of PAI reaction suggested that the direction of the allylic shift during LA isomerization is governed by the position of Phe-168 relative to FAD (Fig. 1B). However, for biotechnological purposes, a modified PAI accepting fatty acid esters as substrates would be preferable because these are much more readily accessible than the free fatty acids. In the present work we describe the stereochemical analysis of hydrogen transfer during LA isomerization and the redox properties of free PAI and the enzyme-product complex. The roles of Arg-88, Phe-193, and Phe-168 for substrate recognition and catalysis are demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis and analysis of kinetic properties of the mutant enzymes. Exchange of Arg-88 and Phe-193 to less polar/smaller residues did not increase activity of PAI toward complex lipids, indicating that the geometry of the fatty acid binding channel is crucial to optimal substrate positioning and selectivity. Furthermore, the potential occurrence of transient radical intermediates has been tested by rapid scan electronic absorption spectroscopy and EPR spectroscopy. Chemicals-Restriction enzymes and DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from MBI Fermentas (St. Leon-Rot, Germany). Standards of fatty acids as well as all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma; methanol, hexane, and 2-propanol (all HPLC grade) were from Baker. PCR-based Mutagenesis-The cloning of PAI open reading frame into bacterial expression vector has been described elsewhere (9Hornung E. Krueger C. Pernstich C. Gipmans M. Porzel A. Feussner I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1738: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The plasmid pGEX-6P-1-PAI was used as a template for PCR-based mutagenesis with QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following oligonucleotides were used to introduce point mutations: R88A_NruI_a, 5′-cgacgggccgaaactgcgtagcgagttcctgcacgagg-3′; R88A_NruI_b, 5′-cctcgtgcaggaactcgctacgcagtttcggcccgtcg-3′; R88S_NruI_a, 5′-cgacgggccgaaactgcgtagcgagttcctgcacgagg-3′; R88S_NruI_b, 5′-cctcgtgcaggaactcgctacgcagtttcggcccgtcg-3′; F193A_BgIII_a, 5′-cttcgtcaccatgatgtccgcggccaagggagacctg-3′; F193A_BgIII_b, 5′-caggtctcccttggccgcggacatcatggtgacgaag-3′; F168L_Eco47III_a, 5′-ggatcaaccccttcacagcgctcggctacgggcacttcgac-3′; F168L_Eco47III_b, 5′-gtcgaagtgcccgtagccgagcgctgtgaaggggttgatcc-3′; G168F169_PstI_a, 5′-tggatcaaccccttcactgcaggcttctacgggcacttcgacaacg-3′; and G168F169_PstI_b, 5′-cgttgtcgaagtgcccgtagaagcctgcagtgaaggggttgatcca-3′. Amplification program consisted of 2 min of denaturation at 94 °C, followed by 18 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 6.5 min at 72 °C. Protein Purification-PAI wild type protein and variants were overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified as described in Ref. 7Liavonchanka A. Hornung E. Feussner I. Rudolph M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2576-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar. Labeled Substrate Synthesis-[11,11-2H2]LA was prepared by organic synthesis using [1,1-2H2]1-bromo-2-octyne as the labeled synthon. The chemical purity according to GC-MS was more than 98%, and the isotope composition was 94.3% dideuterated, 5.1% monodeuterated, and 0.6% undeuterated molecules. [(11S)-2H]LA was prepared by enzymatic desaturation of [(11S)-2H]stearic acid using methodology described in detail (11Hamberg M. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 736-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar): chemical purity, >98%; isotope enrichment, >98.0% monodeuterated molecules; stereochemical purity of deuterium label, >90%. [(9S)-2H]Stearic acid was prepared from a sample of (9S)-hydroxy LA (40 mg) by a sequence involving methyl esterification (diazomethane), catalytic hydrogenation (platinum catalyst; solvent, methanol), conversion to the p-toluenesulfonate ester (p-toluenesulfonyl chloride in pyridine), lithium aluminum deuteride reduction, and oxidation (Jones reagent; solvent, acetone). The product was purified by reverse phase HPLC to afford 11 mg of the labeled stearic acid. Its isotope composition was 98.9% monodeuterated and 1.1% undeuterated molecules as determined by GC-MS analysis of the methyl ester derivative. Another sample of deuterated stearic acid was prepared from CLA (4 mg) produced by action of PAI on [11,11-2H2]LA. A solution of labeled CLA in toluene (1.5 ml) containing Wilkinson's catalyst (4 mg) was stirred at 57 °C for 1 h under an atmosphere of hydrogen gas. Following purification by reverse phase HPLC, 1.2 mg of deuterated stearic acid was obtained having an isotopic composition of 61.1% dideuterated and 35.6% monodeuterated, and 3.3% undeuterated molecules. Activity Assays and Analysis of Reaction Products-Typically, 10 μg of substrate was incubated with 1 μg of purified PAI protein in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5 (final volume, 1 ml). The products were extracted according to Ref. 12Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43084) Google Scholar, and the fatty acids were dissolved in methanol and converted to methyl esters with (trimethylsilyl)-diazomethane. Esterified fatty acids were transmethylated with sodium methoxide in methanol as described (13Hornung E. Pernstich C. Feussner I. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4852-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To trace the fate of isotopic label, fatty acids were converted to 4,4-dimethyloxazoline derivatives as described (14Christie W.W. Lipids. 1998; 33: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and analyzed mass spectrometrically according to (14Christie W.W. Lipids. 1998; 33: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), using the 6890 gas chromatograph/5973 mass selective detector system (Agilent). Otherwise, GC and GC-MS analysis was performed as in Ref. 9Hornung E. Krueger C. Pernstich C. Gipmans M. Porzel A. Feussner I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1738: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar. The relative percentage of LA methyl ester isomerization by PAI mutants compared with wt enzyme was estimated by GC based on the ratio of CLA to LA peak areas for each protein. Kinetic Assays-All of the assays were performed in 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, at 25 °C. FA stock solutions were prepared in ethanol in the concentration range of 0.1-50 mm. For every measurement 5 μl of FA stock solution was mixed with buffer, 0.5-4 μg of purified wt or mutant PAI protein added, and absorbance of the solution at 234 nm was recorded with an Amersham Biosciences Ultrospec 1100 pro spectrophotometer for 1 min. The final reaction volume was 500 μl, with the ethanol concentration thus not exceeding 1%, and the molar excess of the substrate over the enzyme ranged from 50- to 500-fold. The concentration of CLA was calculated using ϵ234 = 24000 m-1 cm-1. Three independent measurements per data point were averaged, and a Michaelis-Menten equation was fit using Origin 6.1 software. Cofactor Exchange-5-Deaza-5-carba-FAD was a generous gift of Prof. S. Ghisla (University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany). 200 μg of purified PAI was diluted to 50 μg/ml in 6 m guanidium chloride, 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm dithiothreitol. This solution was passed through a 25-ml G25 desalting column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol to remove FAD and refold PAI. The protein solution was concentrated in Vivaspin concentrators (molecular mass cut-off = 30 kDa), and 5× molar excess of 5-deaza-FAD was added; protein diluted 10-fold with 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and concentrated again. Washing step was repeated twice; final protein concentration was about 1 mg/ml or 20 μm. With this preparation UV-visible spectra were recorded and activity tests performed. Incubations with Tetrahymena pyriformis-The sodium salt of the labeled stearates (0.5 mg) was added to 20 ml of growth medium followed by 0.5 ml of a suspension of an actively growing culture of T. pyriformis phenoset 30039 (purchased from American Type Culture Collection) (11Hamberg M. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 736-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cells were collected by centrifugation after a growth period of 48 h at 25 °C. The fatty acid fraction obtained following alkaline hydrolysis was methyl-esterified and analyzed by GC-MS. Anaerobic Photoreduction and Redox Potential Measurement-For photoreduction and redox potential determination, the method described by Massey and Hemmerich (16Massey V. Hemmerich P. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) was used. The buffer in all of the experiments was 100 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 10 mm EDTA, and protein concentration was 30-40 μm. For the photoreduction of free PAI and PAI in complex with (10E,12Z)-CLA, 2 μm 5-deaza-FAD and 1 μm of the following redox dyes were added: methyl viologen (E = -430 mV), 2-hydroxy-1,4-napthaquinone (E = -145 mV), and phenazine methosulfate (E = 80 mV). The sample was transferred to the cuvette and rendered anaerobic by 20-30 cycles of vacuum application and flushing with oxygen-free nitrogen. The cuvette was illuminated in the ice bath for 2-min intervals using a 200 W slide projector lamp and allowed to equilibrate at 20 °C until no changes in the UV-visible spectrum were observed, after which the final spectrum was recorded. For redox potential determination the reaction was prepared as above except that phenazine methosulfate and 2-hydroxy-1,4-napthoquinone were omitted and 30 μm anthraquinone-2-sulfonate (E = -225 mV), 2-hydroxy-1,4-napthaquinone or safranine O (Em = -290 mV) was used as the reference dye. For the PAI- (10E,12Z)-CLA complex, an equimolar amount of the substrate LA was included in the reaction. LA was quantitatively converted to (10E,12Z)-CLA during the course of the measurements as confirmed by GC-MS (data not shown). Rapid Scan Stopped Flow UV-visible Absorption Measurements-The time-resolved absorbance spectra of PAI during turnover of its substrate LA were recorded with a SX20 stopped flow spectrophotometer equipped with diode array acquisition (Applied Photophysics Ltd.). PAI (1.6 mg/ml in 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.5) was mixed with varied concentrations of LA (same buffer) ranging from 50 to 250 μm in 1 + 1 mixing ratio at 25 °C. All of the measurements were carried out using an optical cell with a path length of 10 mm. A total of 100 spectra were recorded successively in two different time regimes (50 spectra from 2 to 100 ms, 50 spectra from 100 ms to 100 s). Hydrogen Transfer during the Isomerization-To establish the stereochemistry of hydrogen transfer during PAI-catalyzed isomerization, the reaction products deriving from LA (isotopically labeled with deuterium at C-11) were analyzed by GC-MS after conversion to 4,4-dimethyloxazoline derivatives. The pattern of 4,4-dimethyloxazoline-(10E,12Z)-CLA fragmentation is shown in Fig. 2A (here only the region of interest containing peaks of high m/z is included). In nonlabeled (10E,12Z)-CLA, gaps of 12 atomic mass units between the fragments C-9-C-10 (m/z = 210 and 222) and C-12-C-13 (m/z = 236 and 248) enable localization of double bonds at positions 10 and 12; fragment C-11 and M+ have masses of m/z = 236 and 333, respectively. When [(11S)-2H]linoleic acid was used as a substrate, deuterium remained at position C-11, as indicated by +1-atomic mass unit increase in the C-11 fragment (observed masses for C-9-C-12 fragments are 210, 222, 237, 249, and M+ = 334; Fig. 2B), which is in line with the mechanism based on the PAI crystal structure (7Liavonchanka A. Hornung E. Feussner I. Rudolph M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2576-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In case of [11,11-2H2]linoleic acid, the transfer of one deuterium from C-11 to C-9 is evident (observed masses for C-9-C-12 fragments are 211, 223, 238, 250, and M+ = 335; Fig. 2C), i.e. fragments C-9 and C-10 have +1-atomic mass unit mass increase compared with nonlabeled (10E,12Z)-CLA, and all fragments higher than C-10 have a +2-atomic mass unit increase. These results prove that replacement of 1H for 2H at the C-11 position of LA does not render the enzyme inactive but allows for kinetic isotope effect studies (see below). The isotopic ratio between hydrogen and deuterium was similar for the substrate and product, indicating no loss of deuterium during the isomerization reaction. The reaction in 2H2O did not lead to deuterium incorporation in the product, ruling out both direct involvement of solvent in the reaction and hydrogen exchange between N-5 of reduced FAD and water. This result is buttressed by crystal structure analysis where there was no water detectable in the PAI active site (7Liavonchanka A. Hornung E. Feussner I. Rudolph M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2576-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The fact that even after prolonged incubation of PAI with (10E,12Z)-CLA, no traces of LA were detected by GC (data not shown) confirms that isomerization of LA by PAI is a quasi-irreversible process. Assuming that the initial PAI·LA complex is irreversibly converted to the PAI· (10E,12Z)-CLA complex at the rate determined by k3, the classical Michaelis-Menten kinetic scheme consisting of two steps can be applied to PAI reaction. Obviously, in our scheme k3 combines several kinetically distinct steps, including hydrogen transfer from LA to FAD and from reduced FAD to the fatty acid intermediate as well as dissociation of (10E,12Z)-CLA from the active site upon completed isomerization. Enzymatic isomerization of [11,11-2H2]LA led to the formation of CLA, which retained one of the deuterium atoms at C-11, whereas the other was transferred to C-9 (supplemental Fig. S1). To determine the absolute configuration of the C-9 deuterium atom of CLA, a sample of [9,11-2H2](10E,12Z)-CLA was hydrogenated, and the resulting dideuterated stearate was incubated with a growing culture of T. pyriformis. This microorganism actively desaturates stearic acid to yield a mixture of oleic acid, LA, and γ-linolenic acid by sequential introduction of double bonds at Δ9, Δ12, and Δ6 (11Hamberg M. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 736-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As first shown by Schroepfer and Bloch (17Schroepfer G.J. Bloch K. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 54-63Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the bacterium Corynebacterium diphteriae, such double bond-forming processes proceed stereospecifically, e.g. the Δ9 double bond of oleate was introduced by selective removal of the pro-R hydrogens at C-9 and C-10 of the parent stearate. We prepared a sample of [(9S)-2H]stearic acid from the easily accessible (9S)-HOD and found that γ-linolenic acid generated from this stearate upon incubation with Tetrahymena largely retained the deuterium label (data not shown). Therefore, the Tetrahymena Δ9-desaturase, like the corresponding enzyme in Corynebacterium, selectively removed the pro-R hydrogen from C-9 when creating the Δ9 double bond. Incubation of the dideuterated stearic acid with Tetrahymena prepared from [9,11-2H2](10E,12Z)-CLA likewise generated γ-linolenic acid, which retained the deuterium label (data not shown), thus demonstrating that the configuration of the C-9 deuterium of the 9,11-dideuterated CLA was “R” (supplemental Fig. S1). As seen, PAI-catalyzed double bond isomerization takes place by stereoselective abstraction of the pro-R hydrogen from C-11 followed by a suprafacial transfer of this hydrogen to C-9 (Fig. 1A). To analyze the role of hydrogen abstraction at C-11 for overall catalysis, we carried out kinetic isotope effect (KIE) studies with the same substrates as above (data are summarized in Table 1). Briefly, KIE values of 5.26 and 1.25 were observed for [11,11-2H2]LA and [(11S)-2H]LA, respectively, based on Vmax values. Unfortunately, (11R)-deuterated LA was not available as a substrate for KIE studies; however, a theoretical KIE of [(11R)-2H]LA conversion can be calculated according to the “rule of the geometric mean” (no isotope effects on isotope effects) and would thus amount to 4.21. This value is typical for a primary isotope effect and clearly identifies the (11R) deuteron to undergo transfer to C-9 in the course of isomerization. The small KIE of 1.25 for turnover of [(11S)-2H]LA corresponds well with an α-secondary isotope effect.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of PAI wt and mutant formsProteinSubstrateKmVmaxk3μmnm/ss−1PAI wtLA4.82 ± 0.8443.67 ± 3.404.37 ± 0.34PAI wt[(11S)-2H]LA4.08 ± 0.5235.09 ± 2.143.51 ± 0.21PAI wt[11, 11-2H2]LA2.28 ± 0.558.27 ± 0.790.83 ± 0.08PAILA65.70 ± 8.0429.28 ± 1.232.93 ± 0.12R88SPAILA37.94 ± 7.8832.70 ± 2.580.33 ± 0.26F193APAILA25.77 ± 4.1315.52 ± 0.600.16 ± 0.06R88S/F193APAILAAll mutants inactiveR88AF168LF168G/G169F Open table in a new tab The estimated Km values for LA and [(11S)-2H]LA are identical within experimental error. However, the Km value for [11,11-2H2]LA is 2-fold decreased compared with that of LA (2.28 ± 0.55 and 4.82 ± 0.84 μm, respectively), indicating that substrate binding occurs significantly faster than the subsequent hydrogen transfer steps. In addition, hydrogen abstraction at C-11 (11R) appears to be rate-limiting for PAI reaction, consistent with pronounced KIE calculated for conversion of [(11R)-2H]LA. Mutation of Key Residues Involved in Substrate Alignment-To study the substrate specificity of PAI with respect to fatty acids and FA esters, the roles of the gating residues Arg-88, Phe-193, and Phe-168 in substrate recognition and catalysis were analyzed. The two gating residues, Arg-88 and Phe-193, were mutated to small noncharged amino acids, and the steadystate kinetic parameters of the mutant enzymes with LA as substrate were estimated (Table 1). Mutation of Arg-88 to Ala inactivated PAI to an extent that activity could not be measured spectrophotometrically, and only residual amounts of (10E,12Z)-CLA were detectable by GC. Single exchanges of Arg-88 to Ser and of Phe-193 to Ala, as well as the combination of both, caused pronounced increases in Km ranging from 5- to 13-fold. Thus, substrate binding is compromised in the absence of the gating residues. The Vmax was decreased 25% for Ser-88 and 30% for Ala-193 mutation, respectively, and it was ∼60% lower for the double variant compared with wt PAI. Moreover, mutations of Arg-88 and Phe-193 slightly improved PAI activity toward esterified fatty acids (Table 2). A clear difference was observed for LA methyl ester, which was converted to (10E,12Z)-CLA methyl ester by the Ser-88 mutant 4-fold more efficiently than by wt PAI, based on product analysis by GC.TABLE 2Reaction products of PAI wt and selected mutants with LA analogs and lipidsProteinSubstrateProductPAI wtMethyl ester LA10,12-CLA (traces)R88S, F193A, R88S/F193A10,12-CLA (3-5%)PAI wtLinoleyl-CoA10,12-CLA-CoAR88S, F193A, R88S/F193A10,12-CLA-CoAPAI wtTri-linoleyl-glycerolNoneR88S, F193A, R88S/F193ANonePAI wtDi-linoleyl-phosphatidylcholineNoneR88S, F193A, R88S/F193ANone Open table in a new tab The structural model of PAI reaction suggested that the direction of the allylic shift during LA isomerization is governed by the position of Phe-168 relative to FAD (7Liavonchanka A. Hornung E. Feussner I. Rudolph M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2576-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). When Phe-168 was switched in position with neighboring Gly-169 or replaced by Ile in PAI, the activity was abolished (Table 1), although the enzyme seemed to be properly folded with FAD incorporated as has been verified by spectroscopic properties of the variants as shown for the Phe-168 mutant (supplemental Fig. S2). These experiments highlight the crucial role of the aromatic ring in Phe-168 and its proper position relative to FAD for PAI activity. Substrate Binding and Anaerobic Photoreduction-For an unambiguous identification of FAD semiquinone and calculation of equilibrium constants for semiquinone formation, the redox properties of free PAI and the enzyme-product complex were analyzed by photoreduction. The changes in PAI spectrum upon substrate binding and anaerobic photoreduction are shown in Fig. 3A. The addition of LA (both aerobic and anaerobic) turned the color of PAI solution from yellow to orangered, and an additional shoulder appeared in the spectrum around 545 nm. The color returned to yellow by repeated cycles of dilution-ultrafiltration because of the washout of LA. Neither oleic acid (18:1Δ9Z) nor stearic acid (18:0) produced similar spectral changes upon mixing with PAI, showing that two double bonds in substrate or product are essential for this effect. Thus, these spectral changes could be attributed to the charge-transfer interaction between LA or (10E,12Z)-CLA and oxidized FAD. Flavoenzymes often form charge-transfer complexes with electron-rich substrates, e.g. this type of interaction was extensively studied for acyl-CoA oxidases and modified acyl-CoA species (18Ghisla S. Thorpe C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 494-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Because the complete transfer of an π-electron from LA and (10E,12Z)-CLA to FAD is unlikely, the spectral changes probably reflect a transient state resulting from a π-stacking interaction between Phe-168, the double bonds of the fatty acids, and the isoalloxazine ring of FAD. Anaerobic photoreduction of PAI resulted in decreased absorbance at 380 and 454 nm and in the appearance of a broad spectral peak in the range 500-700 nm with the isosbestic points at 325 and 525 nm (Fig. 3C). Apparently, the same species was formed upon photoreduction of the PAI-(10E,12Z)-CLA complex (Fig. 3B) with the second isosbestic point shifted from 525 to 560 nm. These broad peaks could be attributed to neutral flavin semiquinone, which absorbs in the range 580-600 nm with an extinction coefficient of ∼4000 m-1 cm-1 (19Chapman S.K. Reid G.A. Flavoprotein Protocols. Humana Press, New Jersey1999Crossref Google Scholar). However, under our experimental conditions, even after extensive irradiation of both the PAI-(10E,12Z)-CLA complex and the unreacted protein, the long wavelength peak was not disappearing to the base level as would be expected for the reduction of flavin semiquinone to hydroquinone (Fig. 3B, inset, and data not shown). After exposure to air, the initial spectrum was restored (Fig. 3B, bold line), indicating that the absorbance increase at 620 nm was due to the reduced FAD but the spectral data could not be used for the unambiguous identification of FAD semiquinone and calculation of equilibrium constants for semiquinone formation and decay. Cofactor Replacement-To further examine the nature of the reduced FAD species involved in PAI turnover, the activity of PAI reconstituted with the flavin analog 5-deaza-5-carba-FAD was probed. In contrast to FAD and FMN, the latter compound acts exclusively as a two-electron acceptor and is therefore commonly employed as a probe for the discrimination between radical and ionic mechanisms in flavoenzymes (20Murthy Y.V. Massey V. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 436-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Refolding of PAI with 6 m guanidium chloride by a gel filtration method was used to produce apo-PAI with about 30% yield (as determined by A280 for protein sa"

https://openalex.org/W1988712577,"Complement receptor 2 (CR2, CD21) is a cell membrane protein, with 15 or 16 extracellular short consensus repeats (SCRs), that promotes B lymphocyte responses and bridges innate and acquired immunity. The most distally located SCRs (SCR1-2) mediate the interaction of CR2 with its four known ligands (C3d, Epstein-Barr virus gp350, interferon-alpha, and CD23). Inhibitory monoclonal antibodies against SCR1-2 block binding of all ligands. To develop ligand-specific inhibitors that would also assist in identifying residues unique to each receptor-ligand interaction, phage were selected from randomly generated libraries by panning with recombinant SCR1-2, followed by specific ligand-driven elution. Derived peptides were tested by competition ELISA. One peptide, C3dp1 (APQHLSSQYSRT) exhibited ligand-specific inhibition at midmicromolar IC(50). C3d was titrated into (15)N-labeled SCR1-2, which revealed chemical shift changes indicative of specific intermolecular interactions. With backbone assignments made, the chemical shift changes were mapped onto the crystal structure of SCR1-2. With regard to C3d, the binding surface includes regions of SCR1, SCR2, and the inter-SCR linker, specifically residues Arg(13), Tyr(16), Arg(28), Tyr(29), Ser(32), Thr(34), Lys(48), Asp(56), Lys(57), Tyr(68), Arg(83), Gly(84), Asn(101), Asn(105), and Ser(109). SCR1 and SCR2 demonstrated distinct binding modes. The CR2 binding surface incorporating SCR1 is inconsistent with a previous x-ray CR2-C3d co-crystal analysis but consistent with mutagenesis, x-ray neutron scattering, and inhibitory monoclonal antibody epitope mapping. Titration with C3dp1 yielded chemical shift changes (Arg(13), Tyr(16), Thr(34), Lys(48), Asp(56), Lys(57), Tyr(68), Arg(83), Gly(84), Asn(105), and Ser(109)) overlapping with C3d, indicating that C3dp1 interacts at the same CR2 site as C3d."

https://openalex.org/W2058907666,"Affymetrix three-prime expression microarrays contain thousands of redundant probe sets that interrogate different regions of the same gene. Differential expression analysis methods rarely consider probe redundancy, which can lead to inaccurate inference about overall gene expression or cause investigators to overlook potentially valuable information about differential regulation of variant mRNA products. We investigated the behaviour and consistency of redundant probe sets in a publicly-available data set containing samples from mouse brain amygdala and hippocampus and asked how applying filtering methods to the data affected consistency of results obtained from redundant probe sets. A genome-based filter that screens and groups probe sets according to their overlapping genomic alignments significantly improved redundant probe set consistency. Screening based on qualitative Present-Absent calls from MAS5 also improved consistency. However, even after applying these filters, many redundant probe sets showed significant fold-change differences relative to each other, suggesting differential regulation of alternative transcript production. Visual inspection of these loci using an interactive genome visualization tool (igb.bioviz.org) exposed thirty putative examples of differential regulation of alternative splicing or polyadenylation across brain regions in mouse. This work demonstrates how P/A-call and genome-based filtering can improve consistency among redundant probe sets while at the same time exposing possible differential regulation of RNA processing pathways across sample types."
