https://openalex.org/W2092791231,"alpha-Synucleinopathies are neurodegenerative disorders that range pathologically from the demise of select groups of nuclei to pervasive degeneration throughout the neuraxis. Although mounting evidence suggests that alpha-synuclein lesions lead to neurodegeneration, this remains controversial. To explore this issue, we generated transgenic mice expressing wild-type and A53T human alpha-synuclein in CNS neurons. Mice expressing mutant, but not wild-type, alpha-synuclein developed a severe and complex motor impairment leading to paralysis and death. These animals developed age-dependent intracytoplasmic neuronal alpha-synuclein inclusions paralleling disease onset, and the alpha-synuclein inclusions recapitulated features of human counterparts. Moreover, immunoelectron microscopy revealed that the alpha-synuclein inclusions contained 10-16 nm wide fibrils similar to human pathological inclusions. These mice demonstrate that A53T alpha-synuclein leads to the formation of toxic filamentous alpha-synuclein neuronal inclusions that cause neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2006206079,"Electrical microstimulation was used to study primary motor and premotor cortex in monkeys. Each stimulation train was 500 ms in duration, approximating the time scale of normal reaching and grasping movements and the time scale of the neuronal activity that normally accompanies movement. This stimulation on a behaviorally relevant time scale evoked coordinated, complex postures that involved many joints. For example, stimulation of one site caused the mouth to open and also caused the hand to shape into a grip posture and move to the mouth. Stimulation of this site always drove the joints toward this final posture, regardless of the direction of movement required to reach the posture. Stimulation of other cortical sites evoked different postures. Postures that involved the arm were arranged across cortex to form a map of hand positions around the body. This stimulation-evoked map encompassed both primary motor and the adjacent premotor cortex. We suggest that these regions fit together into a single map of the workspace around the body."
https://openalex.org/W2055022577,"To test the hypothesis that inhibition of axonal transport is sufficient to cause motor neuron degeneration such as that observed in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we engineered a targeted disruption of the dynein-dynactin complex in postnatal motor neurons of transgenic mice. Dynamitin overexpression was found to disassemble dynactin, a required activator of cytoplasmic dynein, resulting in an inhibition of retrograde axonal transport. Mice overexpressing dynamitin demonstrate a late-onset progressive motor neuron degenerative disease characterized by decreased strength and endurance, motor neuron degeneration and loss, and denervation of muscle. Previous transgenic mouse models of ALS have shown abnormalities in microtubule-based axonal transport. In this report, we describe a mouse model that confirms the critical role of disrupted axonal transport in the pathogenesis of motor neuron degenerative disease."
https://openalex.org/W1967318257,"Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1 and 2) are synaptic signaling components necessary for several forms of learning. In mice lacking ERK1, we observe a dramatic enhancement of striatum-dependent long-term memory, which correlates with a facilitation of long-term potentiation in the nucleus accumbens. At the cellular level, we find that ablation of ERK1 results in a stimulus-dependent increase of ERK2 signaling, likely due to its enhanced interaction with the upstream kinase MEK. Consistently, such activity change is responsible for the hypersensitivity of ERK1 mutant mice to the rewarding properties of morphine. Our results reveal an unexpected complexity of ERK-dependent signaling in the brain and a critical regulatory role for ERK1 in the long-term adaptive changes underlying striatum-dependent behavioral plasticity and drug addiction."
https://openalex.org/W2012666269,"Pathologic alterations in the microtubule-associated protein tau have been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Here, we show that tau overexpression, in combination with phosphorylation by the Drosophila glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) homolog and wingless pathway component (Shaggy), exacerbated neurodegeneration induced by tau overexpression alone, leading to neurofibrillary pathology in the fly. Furthermore, manipulation of other wingless signaling molecules downstream from shaggy demonstrated that components of the Wnt signaling pathway modulate neurodegeneration induced by tau pathology in vivo but suggested that tau phosphorylation by GSK-3beta differs from canonical Wnt effects on beta-catenin stability and TCF activity. The genetic system we have established provides a powerful reagent for identification of novel modifiers of tau-induced neurodegeneration that may serve as future therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2025926103,"Changes in somatosensory input can remodel human cortical motor organization, yet the input characteristics that promote reorganization and their functional significance have not been explored. Here we show with transcranial magnetic stimulation that sensory-driven reorganization of human motor cortex is highly dependent upon the frequency, intensity, and duration of stimulus applied. Those patterns of input associated with enhanced excitability (5 Hz, 75% maximal tolerated intensity for 10 min) induce stronger cortical activation to fMRI. When applied to acutely dysphagic stroke patients, swallowing corticobulbar excitability is increased mainly in the undamaged hemisphere, being strongly correlated with an improvement in swallowing function. Thus, input to the human adult brain can be programmed to promote beneficial changes in neuroplasticity and function after cerebral injury."
https://openalex.org/W2082785396,"Association and relay neurons that are generated in the dorsal spinal cord play essential roles in transducing somatosensory information. During development, these two major neuronal classes are delineated by the expression of the homeodomain transcription factor Lbx1. Lbx1 is expressed in and required for the correct specification of three early dorsal interneuron populations and late-born neurons that form the substantia gelatinosa. In mice lacking Lbx1, cells types that arise in the ventral alar plate acquire more dorsal identities. This results in the loss of dorsal horn association interneurons, excess production of commissural neurons, and disrupted sensory afferent innervation of the dorsal horn. Lbx1, therefore, plays a critical role in the development of sensory pathways in the spinal cord that relay pain and touch."
https://openalex.org/W1982195853,"AMPA-receptor (AMPAR) transport to synapses plays a critical role in the modulation of synaptic strength. We show that the functionally critical GluR2 subunit stably resides in an intracellular pool in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). GluR2 in this pool is extensively complexed with GluR3 but not with GluR1, which is mainly confined to the cell surface. Mutagenesis revealed that elements in the C terminus including the PDZ motif are required for GluR2 forward-transport from the ER. Surprisingly, ER retention of GluR2 is controlled by Arg607 at the Q/R-editing site. Reversion to Gln (R607Q) resulted in rapid release from the pool and elevated surface expression of GluR2 in neurons. Therefore, Arg607 is a central regulator. In addition to channel gating, it also controls ER exit and may thereby ensure the availability of GluR2 for assembly into AMPARs."
https://openalex.org/W1995138630,"Glia-axon interactions are essential for the development and function of the nervous system. We combine in vivo imaging and genetics to address the mechanism by which the migration of these cells is coordinated during embryonic development. Using stable transgenic lines, we have followed the migration of one subset of glial cells and their target axons in living zebrafish embryos. These cells coalesce at an early stage and remain coupled throughout migration, with axons apparently pathfinding for glia. Mutant analysis demonstrates that axons provide instructive cues that are sufficient to control glial guidance. Furthermore, mutations in the transcription factor Sox10/cls uncouple the migration of axons and glia. Finally, genetic ablation of this glial subtype reveals an essential role in nerve fasciculation."
https://openalex.org/W2120989812,"We investigated the impact of rod-bipolar signal transfer on visual sensitivity. Two observations indicate that rod-rod bipolar signal transfer is nonlinear. First, responses of rods increased linearly with flash strength, while those of rod bipolars increased supralinearly. Second, fluctuations in the responses of rod bipolars were larger than expected from linear summation of the rod inputs. Rod-OFF bipolar signal transfer did not share this strong nonlinearity. Surprisingly, nonlinear rod-rod bipolar signal transfer eliminated many of the rod's single-photon responses. The impact on sensitivity, however, was more than compensated for by rejection of noise from rods that did not absorb photons. As a consequence, rod bipolars provide a near-optimal readout of rod signals at light levels near visual threshold."
https://openalex.org/W2060580046,"The highly specific relationships between parallel fiber (PF) and climbing fiber (CF) receptive fields in Purkinje cells and interneurons suggest that normal PF receptive fields are established by CF-specific plasticity. To test this idea, we used PF stimulation that was either paired or unpaired with CF activity. Conspicuously, unpaired PF stimulation that induced long-lasting, very large increases in the receptive field sizes of Purkinje cells induced long-lasting decreases in receptive field sizes of their afferent interneurons. In contrast, PF stimulation paired with CF activity that induced long-lasting decreases in the receptive fields of Purkinje cells induced long-lasting, large increases in the receptive fields of interneurons. These properties, and the fact the mossy fiber receptive fields were unchanged, suggest that the receptive field changes were due to bidirectional PF synaptic plasticity in Purkinje cells and interneurons."
https://openalex.org/W2160173410,"In mammals, methionine metabolism occurs mainly in the liver via methionine adenosyltransferase-catalyzed conversion to S-adenosylmethionine. Of the two genes that encode methionine adenosyltransferase(MAT1Aand MAT2A), MAT1A is mainly expressed in adult liver whereas MAT2A is expressed in all extrahepatic tissues. Mice lacking MAT1A have reduced hepatic S-adenosylmethionine content and hyperplasia and spontaneously develop nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. In this study, we examined whether chronic hepatic S-adenosylmethionine deficiency generates oxidative stress and predisposes to injury and malignant transformation. Differential gene expression in MAT1A knockout mice was analyzed following the criteria of the Gene Ontology Consortium. Susceptibility of MAT1A knockout mice to CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity and malignant transformation was determined in 3- and 18-month-old mice, respectively. Analysis of gene expression profiles revealed an abnormal expression of genes involved in the metabolism of lipids and carbohydrates in MAT1A knockout mice, a situation that is reminiscent of that found in diabetes, obesity, and other conditions associated with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. This aberrant expression of metabolic genes in the knockout mice was associated with hyperglycemia, increased hepatic CYP2E1 and UCP2 expression and triglyceride levels, and reduced hepatic glutathione content. The knockout animals have increased lipid peroxidation and enhanced sensitivity to CCl4-induced liver damage, which was largely due to increased CYP2E1 expression because diallyl sulfide, an inhibitor of CYP2E1, prevented CCl4-induced liver injury. Hepatocellular carcinoma developed in more than half of the knockout mice by 18 months of age. Taken together, our findings define a critical role for S-adenosylmethionine in maintaining normal hepatic function and tumorigenesis of the liver."
https://openalex.org/W96550490,"We tested the hypothesis that pacemaker neurons generate breathing rhythm in mammals. We monitored respiratory-related motor nerve rhythm in neonatal rodent slice preparations. Blockade of the persistent sodium current (I(NaP)), which was postulated to underlie voltage-dependent bursting in respiratory pacemaker neurons, with riluzole (< or =200 microM) did not alter the frequency of respiratory-related motor output. Yet, in every pacemaker neuron recorded (50/50), bursting was abolished at much lower concentrations of riluzole (< or =20 microM). Thus, eliminating the pacemaker population (our statistics confirm that this population is reduced at least 94%, p < 0.05) does not affect respiratory rhythm. These results suggest that voltage-dependent bursting in pacemaker neurons is not essential for respiratory rhythmogenesis, which may instead be an emergent network property."
https://openalex.org/W1981585359,"We present evidence that synapse retraction occurs during normal synaptic growth at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ). An RNAi-based screen to identify the molecular mechanisms that regulate synapse retraction identified Arp-1/centractin, a subunit of the dynactin complex. Arp-1 dsRNA enhances synapse retraction, and this effect is phenocopied by a mutation in P150/Glued, also a dynactin component. The Glued protein is enriched within the presynaptic nerve terminal, and presynaptic expression of a dominant-negative Glued transgene enhances retraction. Retraction is associated with a local disruption of the synaptic microtubule cytoskeleton. Electrophysiological, ultrastructural, and immunohistochemical data support a model in which presynaptic retraction precedes disassembly of the postsynaptic apparatus. Our data suggests that dynactin functions locally within the presynaptic arbor to promote synapse stability."
https://openalex.org/W2037702696,"Synaptotagmin is a proposed Ca2+ sensor on the vesicle for regulated exocytosis and exhibits Ca2+-dependent binding to phospholipids, syntaxin, and SNAP-25 in vitro, but the mechanism by which Ca2+ triggers membrane fusion is uncertain. Previous studies suggested that SNAP-25 plays a role in the Ca2+ regulation of secretion. We found that synaptotagmins I and IX associate with SNAP-25 during Ca2+-dependent exocytosis in PC12 cells, and we identified C-terminal amino acids in SNAP-25 (Asp179, Asp186, Asp193) that are required for Ca2+-dependent synaptotagmin binding. Replacement of SNAP-25 in PC12 cells with SNAP-25 containing C-terminal Asp mutations led to a loss-of-function in regulated exocytosis at the Ca2+-dependent fusion step. These results indicate that the Ca2+-dependent interaction of synaptotagmin with SNAP-25 is essential for the Ca2+-dependent triggering of membrane fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2128062921,"Sucrase-isomaltase (SI), an intestine-specific gene, is induced in the differentiated small intestinal villous epithelium during the suckling-weaning transition in mice. We have previously identified cis-acting elements within a short evolutionarily conserved SI promoter. However, the nature and profile of expression of the interacting proteins have not been fully characterized during this developmental transition. Herein, we show that hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α (HNF-1α), GATA-4, and caudal related homeodomain proteins Cdx2 and Cdx1 are the primary transcription factors from the adult mouse intestinal epithelium to interact with the SIF3, GATA, and SIF1 elements of the SI promoter. We wanted to study whether HNF-1α, GATA-4, and Cdx2 can cooperate in the regulation of SI gene expression. Immunolocalization experiments revealed that HNF-1α is detected in rare epithelial cells of suckling mice and becomes progressively more expressed in the villous epithelial cells during the suckling-weaning transition. GATA-4 protein is expressed exclusively in villous differentiated epithelial cells of the proximal small intestine, decreases in expression in the ileum, and becomes undetectable in the colon. HNF-1α, GATA-4, and Cdx2 interactin vitro and in vivo. These factors activate SI promoter activity in cotransfection experiments where GATA-4 requires the presence of both HNF-1α and Cdx2. These findings imply a combinatory role of HNF-1α, Cdx2, and GATA-4 for the time- and position-dependent regulation of SI transcription during development.

Gastrointestinal Cancers: Biology, Diagnosis, and Therapy. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1995: 21-43Google Scholar). In mice, important changes in the acquisition of mature enterocyte functions are observed during the 3rd postnatal week, which corresponds to the suckling-weaning transition. Among these changes are the activation of transcription of distinct genes related to specific functions of the intestinal epithelium (3Rings E.H. Krasinski S.D. van Beers E.H. Moorman A.F. Dekker J.

Sucrase-isomaltase (SI),1 an enzyme expressed in the brush border of mature enterocytes, represents one of the most extensively studied genes activated during this developmental transition (4Traber P.G. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1998; 353: 911-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). SI is first detectable in mouse embryonic intestine and remains stable through the first 2 weeks of postnatal life. At the time of the suckling-weaning transition, a dramatic induction of SI mRNA and protein is observed. A proximal to distal gradient of SI expression and activity is then established with highest level in the jejunum and no detectable level in the colon (3Rings E.H. Krasinski S.D. van Beers E.H.

A vertical gradient of expression is also observed along the crypt-villus axis with a maximal level in the lower two-thirds of the villi and no expression in the crypts (3Rings E.H.

Although the distribution of SI expression is well documented during intestinal development, the exact developmental mechanisms that govern SI and intestinal gene expression are still poorly defined.In the past, we have identified a number of SI promoter elements important to support its expression in intestinal epithelial cells (9Traber P.G., Wu, G.D. Wang W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3614-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a short evolutionarily conserved SI gene promoter was shown to recapitulate the developmental expression of SI in transgenic mice (6Tung J. Markowitz A.J. Silberg D.G. Traber P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G83-G92PubMed Google Scholar). This indicated that all of the elements required for the developmental regulation of the SI gene are comprised within this short region. This short promoter contains three identified regulatory sites: sucrase-isomaltase footprint 1 (SIF1), SIF3, and GATA.The SIF1 element interacts with Cdx transcription factors (10Suh E. Chen L. Taylor J. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7340-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 11Taylor J.K. Levy T. Suh E.R. Traber P.G.

The expression of Cdx1 and Cdx2 is restricted to the intestinal epithelium (13Silberg D.G. Swain G.P. Suh E.R. Traber P.G. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Cdx1 protein is found mainly in the crypt compartment, whereas the Cdx2 protein is detected in both the crypt and the villus compartments (13Silberg D.G. Swain G.P. Suh E.R. Traber P.G.

Cdx2 stimulates differentiation and expression of SI in intestinal epithelial cells (16Suh E. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). However, the specific role of the SIF1 element in the regulation of SI promoter activity in vivo is unclear.The SIF3 element interacts with the transcription factors HNF-1α and HNF-1β, which bind to DNA as either homodimers or heterodimers. They are expressed in a variety of tissues, including liver, kidney, and intestine and have been implicated in the regulation of multiple genes (17Mendel D.B. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 677-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HNF-1α stimulates SI promoter activity via the SIF3 element, whereas HNF-1β down-regulates this effect (18Boudreau F. Zhu Y. Traber P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32122-32128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although HNF-1α mRNA has been localized in the crypts and bottom of the villi in the small intestine (19Serfas M.S. Tyner A.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G506-G513PubMed Google Scholar), the exact pattern of HNF-1α protein distribution during intestinal development is unknown.More recently (20Boudreau F.B. Rings E.H.H.M. Swain G.P.

Grand R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G69-G84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we have identified a GATA element localized in the proximal region of the SI promoter. GATA-4, 5, and 6 are expressed in the intestine as well as various mesoderm- and endoderm-derived tissues such as heart, liver, lung, and gonad, where they play critical roles in regulating tissue-specific gene expression (22Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38949-38952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). GATA-4 transcripts are detected in villi of the small intestine in both mice (23Arceci R.J. King A.A. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Wilson D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and chicken (24Gao X. Sedgwick T. Shi Y.B. Evans T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2901-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), whereas the GATA-6 mRNA is localized predominantly at the crypt-villus junction (24Gao X. Sedgwick T. Shi Y.B. Evans T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2901-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). However, the exact distribution of GATA proteins in the intestine has not been addressed. GATA-4 and GATA-6 play critical roles in the definitive formation of the endoderm early during embryonic life (25Kuo C.T. Morrisey E.E. Anandappa R. Sigrist K., Lu, M.M. Parmacek M.S. Soudais C.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3579-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Their involvement in the maintenance of the intestinal epithelium remains speculative.In this study, we investigated whether HNF-1α, GATA-4, and Cdx2 could activate the development-regulated SI gene through combinatorial interactions. We report that HNF-1α and GATA-4 protein expression is temporally and regionally modulated in a way that correlates well with the activation of SI expression during the suckling-weaning transition in the intestine. We show that these proteins physically interact with each other and cooperate functionally in the activation of the SI gene promoter. These findings imply a combinatory role of HNF-1α, Cdx2, and GATA-4 for the maturation of the small intestinal mucosa.DISCUSSIONThe understanding of molecular mechanisms that govern tissue-specific gene expression often lead to the identification of transcription factors responsible for tissue specialization and maturation. In the past and herein, we used the SI gene as a model to study the molecular basis of the establishment and maintenance of the intestinal phenotype. A short evolutionarily conserved SI promoter contains cis-acting elements that interact with HNF-1α, GATA-4, and Cdx proteins. Interestingly, similar elements are present in a number of intestinal specific gene promoters such as IPAL (29Taylor J.K. Boll W. Levy T. Suh E. Siang S. Mantei N. Traber P.G. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1419-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (21Krasinski S.D. Van Wering H.M. Tannemaat M.R. Grand R.J. Am. J.

We have recently described the importance of the HNF-1 and GATA elements in the regulation of SI promoter activity in vivo (18Boudreau F. Zhu Y. Traber P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32122-32128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 20Boudreau F.B. Rings E.H.H.M. Swain G.P. Sinclair A.M. Suh E.R. Silberg D.G. Scheuermann R.H. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5467-5478Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the current study, we showed that the Cdx element is essential for SI gene transcription. Our findings also indicated that HNF-1α protein expression was induced in the villous epithelium during the suckling-weaning transition. In addition, GATA-4 protein was restricted to the villous epithelium with a decreasing gradient of expression along the horizontal axis of the intestine. We demonstrate that HNF-1α, GATA-4, and Cdx2 interact and cooperate for the transcriptional activation of intestine-specific genes. Our results imply that the Cdx element is required for SI gene transcription but that combinatorial interactions of HNF-1α, GATA-4, and Cdx2 are important for the temporal and spatial regulation of SI gene expression during postnatal development.The HNF-1α protein is detected in only a few epithelial cells in suckling animals to become progressively expressed in differentiated enterocytes during the suckling-weaning transition. In adult mice, HNF-1α mRNA has been found to be highest in crypts of the small and large intestine with a decreasing gradient along the vertical axis (19Serfas M.S. Tyner A.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G506-G513PubMed Google Scholar). Our analysis shows that HNF-1α protein is detected abundantly in villus enterocytes with only minor expression in the crypt compartment. The molecular network involved in the regulation of HNF-1α has been characterized partly in embryoid bodies (41Duncan S.A. Navas M.A. Dufort D. Rossant J. Stoffel M. Science. 1998; 281: 692-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) but remains largely unknown in the intestinal epithelium context. GATA-4 protein expression is also restricted to villous epithelial cells but is not expressed in the most distal part of the intestine. GATA-4 transcripts were originally reported to be present in the mouse small intestinal villus region and undetectable in the colon (23Arceci R.J. King A.A. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Wilson D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have reported that the GATA-4 mRNA was localized in the entire tract of the intestinal epithelium late in mouse embryonic development (42Morrisey E.E., Ip, H.S., Lu, M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and up-regulated along the crypt-villus axis in chicken (24Gao X. Sedgwick T. Shi Y.B. Evans T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2901-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Our findings demonstrate that the GATA-4 protein is restricted to the small intestinal villus region and absent in the colon, a pattern that is established early during embryonic development. 2F. Boudreau and G. P. Swain, unpublished observations. The molecular mechanisms that control GATA-4 expression are still to be determined. Our findings coupled to others suggest that regulation of HNF-1α and GATA-4 relies on transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms that promote the regionalization of gene expression along both the horizontal and vertical axes during intestinal development.The overall distribution of HNF-1α, GATA-4, and Cdx2 proteins during the suckling-weaning transition corresponds well with the induction of SI (6Tung J. Markowitz A.J. Silberg D.G. Traber P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G83-G92PubMed Google Scholar) and IPAL (43Boll W. Schmid-Chanda T. Semenza G. Mantei N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12901-12911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) mRNA expression. Nevertheless, it is likely that post-translational modifications may play a role in the functional interaction of these factors to regulate intestinal gene transcription. We have reported previously that phosphorylation of the serine 60 residue within the Cdx2 protein which occurs in the crypt compartment reduces its trans-activation capacity (15Rings E.H.H.M. Boudreau F. Taylor J.K. Moffett J. Suh E.R. Traber P.G. Gastroenterology. 2001; 121: 1437-1450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of GATA-4 by certain activated kinase pathways influences both binding and trans-activation potency (44Liang Q. Wiese R.J. Bueno O.F. Dai Y.S. Markham B.E. Molkentin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7460-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar,45Charron F. Tsimiklis G. Arcand M. Robitaille L. Liang Q. Molkentin J.D. Meloche S. Nemer M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2702-2719Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Two different GATA family members (GATA-1 and GATA-3) are direct targets of CREB-binding protein histone acetyltransferase activity, and the acetylation of family conserved GATA-specific domains results in the modification of their activation capacity (46Boyes J. Byfield P. Nakatani Y. Ogryzko V. Nature. 1998; 396: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 47Blobel G.A. Nakajima T. Eckner R. Montminy M. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4676-4687Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition, other transcription factors and cofactors are likely to be involved in the modulation of SI gene expression. For example, Cux/CDP interacts with and represses SI promoter activity via an element that encloses the GATA site (20Boudreau F.B. Rings E.H.H.M. Swain G.P. Sinclair A.M. Suh E.R. Silberg D.G. Scheuermann R.H. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5467-5478Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Cdx2 and GATA-4 interact with the cofactor p300 (49Hussain M.A. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28950-28957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 50Dai Y.S. Markham B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37178-37185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), whereas HNF-1α interacts with both CREB-binding protein and its associated factor PCAF (51Soutoglou E. Papafotiou G. Katrakili N. Talianidis I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12515-12520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Whether these post-translational and physical interactions occur along the vertical and horizontal axes of the intestine during development remains to be determined.The Cdx2 and HNF-1α proteins can interact via their respective homeodomain region in vitro (52Mitchelmore C. Troelsen J.T. Spodsberg N. Sjostrom H. Noren O. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that Cdx2, HNF-1α, and GATA-4 all interact with each other and are part of a same complex. However, detailed mechanisms and the nature of the domains involved for the formation of a stable complex with transcriptionally active intestinal genes in vivo will need further studies. It has been suggested that GATA proteins can influence the activity of certain gene promoters without physically interacting with DNA but through physical interactions between other proteins binding to regulatory elements of the promoter (53Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2437-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). GATA-5 and HNF-1α cooperatively activate the lactase gene promoter, an effect that is independent of an intact GATA interacting site (21Krasinski S.D. Van Wering H.M. Tannemaat M.R. Grand R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G69-G84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the transcriptional activation of the SI promoter by GATA-4 does not require an intact GATA site but depends on Cdx2 and HNF-1α. Therefore, it is possible that other family members such as GATA-5 and GATA-6 could influence SI promoter activity via similar indirect interactions.The importance of Cdx2 in the maintenance of the intestinal phenotype has been demonstrated in knockout experiments (54Tamai Y. Nakajima R. Ishikawa T. Takaku K. Seldin M.F. Taketo M.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2965-2970PubMed Google Scholar, 55Beck F. Chawengsaksophak K. Waring P. Playford R.J. Furness J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7318-7323Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of Cdx2 within the stomach epithelium results in the formation of intestinal metaplasia (56Silberg D.G. Sullivan J. Kang E. Swain G.P. Moffett J. Sund N.J. Sackett S.D. Kaestner K.H. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 689-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The GATA-4 protein plays a role in the specification of the mouse gastric epithelium as demonstrated with the use of chimeric mice (57Jacobsen C.M. Narita N. Bielinska M. Syder A.J. Gordon J.I. Wilson D.B. Dev. Biol. 2002; 241: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and stimulates the differentiation of embryonic cells into extraembryonic endoderm (58Fujikura J. Yamato E. Yonemura S. Hosoda K. Masui S. Nakao K. Miyazaki J.-i. Niwa H. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The possible role of HNF-1α in the formation and maintenance of the gastrointestinal tract has not been yet characterized carefully (59Pontoglio M. Barra J. Hadchouel M. Doyen A. Kress C. Bach J.P. Babinet C. Yaniv M. Cell. 1996; 84: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar,60Lee Y.H. Sauer B. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3059-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The future challenge will be to investigate the combinatory roles of HNF-1α, GATA-4, and Cdx2 in the morphogenesis and differentiation of the intestinal epithelium during development. The maturation of the intestinal epithelium involves several steps that are initiated early during embryogenesis and completed at the beginning of adulthood (1Montgomery R.K. Mulberg A.E. Grand R.J. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 702-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 2Traber P.G. Wu G.D. Rustgi A.K. Gastrointestinal Cancers: Biology, Diagnosis, and Therapy. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1995: 21-43Google Scholar). In mice, important changes in the acquisition of mature enterocyte functions are observed during the 3rd postnatal week, which corresponds to the suckling-weaning transition. Among these changes are the activation of transcription of distinct genes related to specific functions of the intestinal epithelium (3Rings E.H. Krasinski S.D. van Beers E.H. Moorman A.F. Dekker J. Montgomery R.K. Grand R.J. Buller H.A. Gastroenterology. 1994; 106: 1223-1232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Sucrase-isomaltase (SI),1 an enzyme expressed in the brush border of mature enterocytes, represents one of the most extensively studied genes activated during this developmental transition (4Traber P.G. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1998; 353: 911-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). SI is first detectable in mouse embryonic intestine and remains stable through the first 2 weeks of postnatal life. At the time of the suckling-weaning transition, a dramatic induction of SI mRNA and protein is observed. A proximal to distal gradient of SI expression and activity is then established with highest level in the jejunum and no detectable level in the colon (3Rings E.H. Krasinski S.D. van Beers E.H. Moorman A.F. Dekker J. Montgomery R.K. Grand R.J. Buller H.A. Gastroenterology. 1994; 106: 1223-1232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 5Krasinski S.D. Estrada G. Yeh K.Y.

Physiol. 1997; 273: G83-G92PubMed Google Scholar). A vertical gradient of expression is also observed along the crypt-villus axis with a maximal level in the lower two-thirds of the villi and no expression in the crypts (3Rings E.H. Krasinski S.D. van Beers E.H. Moorman A.F. Dekker J. Montgomery R.K. Grand R.J. Buller H.A. Gastroenterology. 1994; 106: 1223-1232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 7Traber P.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 8Traber P.G., Yu, L., Wu, G.D. Judge T.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: G123-G130PubMed Google Scholar). Although the distribution of SI expression is well documented during intestinal development, the exact developmental mechanisms that govern SI and intestinal gene expression are still poorly defined. In the past, we have identified a number of SI promoter elements important to support its expression in intestinal epithelial cells (9Traber P.G., Wu, G.D. Wang W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3614-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a short evolutionarily conserved SI gene promoter was shown to recapitulate the developmental expression of SI in transgenic mice (6Tung J. Markowitz A.J. Silberg D.G. Traber P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G83-G92PubMed Google Scholar). This indicated that all of the elements required for the developmental regulation of the SI gene are comprised within this short region. This short promoter contains three identified regulatory sites: sucrase-isomaltase footprint 1 (SIF1), SIF3, and GATA. The SIF1 element interacts with Cdx transcription factors (10Suh E. Chen L. Taylor J. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7340-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 11Taylor J.K. Levy T. Suh E.R. Traber P.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2293-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) that belong to mammalian homeobox gene family related to the Drosophila melanogaster gene caudal (12Burglin T.R. A Comprehensive Classification of Homeobox Genes. Sambrook and Tooze Publishing Partnership, New York1994Google Scholar). The expression of Cdx1 and Cdx2 is restricted to the intestinal epithelium (13Silberg D.G. Swain G.P. Suh E.R. Traber P.G. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Cdx1 protein is found mainly in the crypt compartment, whereas the Cdx2 protein is detected in both the crypt and the villus compartments (13Silberg D.G. Swain G.P. Suh E.R. Traber P.G. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 14James R. Erler T. Kazenwadel J. J. Biol.

Gastroenterology. 2001; 121: 1437-1450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cdx2 stimulates differentiation and expression of SI in intestinal epithelial cells (16Suh E. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). However, the specific role of the SIF1 element in the regulation of SI promoter activity in vivo is unclear. The SIF3 element interacts with the transcription factors HNF-1α and HNF-1β, which bind to DNA as either homodimers or heterodimers. They are expressed in a variety of tissues, including liver, kidney, and intestine and have been implicated in the regulation of multiple genes (17Mendel D.B. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 677-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HNF-1α stimulates SI promoter activity via the SIF3 element, whereas HNF-1β down-regulates this effect (18Boudreau F. Zhu Y. Traber P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32122-32128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although HNF-1α mRNA has been localized in the crypts and bottom of the villi in the small intestine (19Serfas M.S. Tyner A.L. Am."
https://openalex.org/W1595640022,"Bcl-2, a protein that blocks apoptosis by inhibiting the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) and release of cytochrome c appears to affect normal mitochondrial function by altering electron flow and increasing rates of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In this study, we show that glutathione (GSH) depletion induces ROS production and selective toxicity in HL60 cells that overexpress Bcl-2 compared with neomycin vector control cells. Toxicity was mediated by the MPT because it was blocked with the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) ligand bongkrekic acid and resulted in mitochondrial cytochrome c release, caspase 3 activation, and DNA fragmentation, indicating the involvement of an apoptotic pathway. Respiratory chain inhibitors stigmatellin and antimycin A, which inhibit Qo and Qi sites of respiratory chain complex III, respectively, blocked ROS production, preserved the redox state of protein thiols, and prevented cell death. These results indicate that in the absence of GSH, endogenous ROS generated at respiratory complex III induce MPT independently of Bcl-2. The results also suggest a new model for MPT in which the central pore protein ANT is regulated by adenine nucleotide and the activity of mitochondrial respiratory complex III."

Tumor necrosis factor-α rapidly and transiently activated ERK1/2 and JNK in fibroblasts, whereas the activation of p38 MAPK was more persistent. Inhibition of p38 activity by SB203580 markedly (by 80–90%) inhibited induction of MMP-1 and MMP-3 expression by tumor necrosis factor-α, whereas blocking the activation of ERK1/2 by PD98059 had no effect. Activation of endogenous ERK1/2 by adenovirus-mediated transfer of constitutively active MEK1 resulted in potent induction of MMP-1 and MMP-3 expression. Activation of endogenous or adenovirally expressed p38α by adenovirally delivered constitutively active MKK3b and MKK6b also enhanced MMP-1 and MMP-3 expression and augmented the up-regulatory effect of ERK1/2 activation on the expression of these MMPs. Activation of ERK1/2 resulted in induction of c-jun, junB, and c-fos expression, whereas activation of p38 alone had no effect. In contrast, activation of p38α resulted in marked stabilization of MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNAs. These results identify two distinct and complementary signaling mechanisms mediating induction of MMP-1 and MMP-3 expression in dermal fibroblasts: AP-1-dependent transcriptional activation via the ERK1/2 pathway and AP-1-independent enhancement via p38α MAPK by mRNA stabilization. It is conceivable that both modes of action play an important role in controlling the proteolytic phenotype of fibroblasts, e.g. in wound repair and tumor invasion.

At present, 21 human members of MMP gene family have been identified, and they can be classified into subgroups of collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins, membrane-type MMPs, and other MMPs based on their structure and substrate specificity (1Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3827) Google Scholar, 2Johansson N. Ahonen M. Kähäri V.-M. Cell. Mol.

There is a considerable amount of evidence that MMPs play an important role in controlled tissue remodeling in physiologic situations, including developmental tissue morphogenesis, tissue repair, and angiogenesis. In addition, MMPs obviously play an important role in destruction of normal tissue architecture, e.g. in rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, autoimmune blistering skin disorders, cutaneous photoaging, and tumor invasion and metastasis (1Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3827) Google Scholar, 2Johansson N. Ahonen M. Kähäri V.-M. Cell. Mol.

Recent results show that MMPs also cleave growth factors, cytokine, chemokines, and their receptors and can in this way regulate cellular growth factor response and inflammatory reaction (3Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 463-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (3172) Google Scholar). The expression of most MMPs in unstimulated cells is low, but is induced by a variety of extracellular stimuli, including mitogenic growth factors, cytokines, tumor promoters, and contact with the ECM (4Westermarck J. Kähäri V.-M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). All the above-mentioned stimuli activate the nuclear AP-1 transcription factor complex, and AP-1 dimers consisting of members of the jun and fos gene families bind to the cognate cis-element at around −70 in the 5′-flanking regulatory region of several genes, resulting in activation of gene transcription (see Ref. 4Westermarck J. Kähäri V.-M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). The induction of c-jun and c-fos expression is mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (see Refs. 4Westermarck J. Kähäri V.-M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar and 5Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar).

In addition, our recent results show that the activation of ERK1/2 alone potently enhances MMP-1 promoter activity, whereas activation of p38 MAPK alone has a minimal effect on the transcriptional activity of the human MMP-1 gene (9Westermarck J., Li, S.-P. Kallunki T. Han J. Kähäri V.-M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2373-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In this study, we have examined the specific roles of distinct MAPK signaling modules in regulation of the expression of endogenous MMP-1 and stromelysin-1 (MMP-3), a potent activator of latent MMP-1 in normal human skin fibroblasts. We show that the induction of MMP-1 and MMP-3 by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is dependent on the activity of p38 MAPK, but not on that of ERK1/2. Activation of p38α alone by constitutively active MKK3b resulted in induction of MMP-1 and MMP-3 expression by stabilization of MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNAs, but had no effect on c-jun, junB, and c-fosexpression. Specific activation of endogenous ERK1/2 by adenovirus-mediated expression of constitutively active MEK1 resulted in induction of MMP-1 and MMP-3 expression and activation of c-jun, junB, and c-fos expression. The most abundant expression of MMP-1 and MMP-3 was noted when ERK1/2 were activated in combination with JNK or p38. These results provide evidence for two distinct and complementary mechanisms mediating induction of the collagenolytic capacity of dermal fibroblasts: AP-1-dependent transcriptional activation of MMP-1 gene expression via the ERK1/2 pathway and AP-1-independent enhancement via p38 MAPK by mRNA stabilization, suggesting that both play an important role in controlling the proteolytic phenotype of fibroblasts, e.g. in wound repair and tumor invasion. Human recombinant TNF-α, MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 (2′-amino-3′-methoxyflavone), p38 inhibitor SB203580 (4-(fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-1H-imidazole), and RNA polymerase II inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-1-b(β)-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) were obtained from Calbiochem. Anisomycin was obtained from Sigma. Normal human skin fibroblast cultures were established from a punch biopsy obtained from a voluntary healthy male donor (age 23). Establishment of human Ha-Ras-transformed fibroblasts (KMST-6/Ras) has been described previously (10Jahan I. Mihara K. Bai L. Namba M. In Vitro Cell. Dev.

Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mm glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For experiments, fibroblasts were maintained in culture medium supplemented with 0.5% FCS for 18 h; TNF-α (20 ng/ml) was added; and the incubations were continued for the indicated periods of time.

Our previous results indicate that activation of fibroblast MMP-1 expression by contact with collagen, by the lipid second messenger ceramide, and by the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid involves coordinate activation of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK (6Reunanen N.

In this study, we have further elucidated the specific roles of these MAPK cascades in regulation of the expression of two MMPs abundantly expressed by normal human skin fibroblasts, i.e. MMP-1 and MMP-3. Initially, the cells were treated with TNF-α (20 ng/ml) for different periods of time, and the activation of ERK1/2 and p38 was determined by Western blot analysis using antibodies against activated forms of these MAPKs. As shown in Fig.1A, exposure of fibroblasts to TNF-α resulted in rapid and transient activation of ERK1/2, detected at 15 and 30 min of incubation. Interestingly, p38 MAPK was also rapidly (15 min) activated by TNF-α; but in contrast to ERK1/2, activation of p38 was more persistent and still detectable at 6 h of incubation (Fig. 1A). The activity of JNK, determined by kinase assay, was also potently increased by TNF-α after 15 and 30 min of incubation (Fig. 1B), but the activity returned to basal levels after 30 min (data not shown). To examine the specific roles of ERK1/2 and p38 in the regulation of MMP-1 and MMP-3 expression, we treated fibroblasts with TNF-α alone or in combination with the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 or with the p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor SB203580. Exposure of dermal fibroblasts to TNF-α resulted in marked up-regulation of MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNA levels, and the enhancement of both by TNF-α was potently suppressed by 10 and 20 μm SB203580 (by 76 and 90%, respectively), whereas PD98059 (40 μm) alone or in combination with SB203580 had no effect (Fig. 1C). The up-regulation of pro-MMP-1 and pro-MMP-3 production by TNF-α was also potently down-regulated by SB203580, but not by PD98059 (Fig.1D). To confirm the inhibitory effect of PD98059 on ERK1/2 activation, we determined the levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in cells treated with TNF-α alone or in combination with PD90859. As shown in Fig.1E, treatment of fibroblasts with PD98059 (40 μm) entirely inhibited the activation of ERK1/2 by TNF-α, but had no effect on the activation of p38. To corroborate the specificity of the inhibitory effect of SB203580 on p38 MAPK activity, we determined the levels of activated ATF2, a substrate for JNK (25Minden A. Lin A. Smeal T. Derijard B. Cobb M. Davis R.J. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6683-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), and the levels of phosphorylated CREB and ATF1, downstream targets of p38 (26Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1F, treatment of fibroblasts with TNF-α resulted in rapid and transient phosphorylation of CREB and ATF1, and the activation of both was entirely inhibited by SB203580 (20 μm). TNF-α treatment of cells also resulted in phosphorylation of ATF2 at 15 and 30 min of incubation, but the activation was not inhibited by SB203580 (Fig. 1F). In contrast, treatment with SB203580 resulted in prolonged activation of ATF2, still noted at 60 min (Fig. 1F). These results indicate that at the concentration used (20 μm), SB203580 inhibits the activity of p38 MAPK, but has no effect on endogenous JNK activity in normal dermal fibroblasts. Altogether, these results show that p38 MAPK plays an important role in induction of MMP-1 and MMP-3 expression and suggest that, in the presence of JNK and p38 activity, activation of ERK1/2 is not critical for this event. The enhancement of human MMP-1 and MMP-3 gene transcription involves activation of the AP-1 element located around −70 in the 5′-flanking regulatory region of the genes (4Westermarck J. Kähäri V.-M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). The induction of the expression of the principal components of the AP-1 dimers, c-Jun and c-Fos, is mediated by distinct MAPK pathways (4Westermarck J. Kähäri V.-M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar, 5Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that activation of ERK1/2 results in potent stimulation of human MMP-1 promoter activity, whereas activation of p38 by MKK3 and MKK6 has a minimal effect on MMP-1 promoter activity (9Westermarck J., Li, S.-P. Kallunki T. Han J. Kähäri V.-M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2373-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In this context, we examined the roles of p38 and ERK1/2 MAPKs in the regulation of distinct components of the AP-1 complex. As shown in Fig. 2 (Aand B), treatment of dermal fibroblasts with TNF-α resulted in rapid and transient up-regulation of c-jun, junB, and c-fos mRNA levels. Interestingly, pretreatment of the cells with SB203580 potently suppressed the induction of junB and c-fos mRNAs at 30-min and 1-h time points, whereas inhibition of the induction of c-jun mRNA abundance was less potent (Fig.2A). In parallel, PD98059 entirely inhibited the induction of c-fos mRNA abundance by TNF-α and in part prevented the induction of c-jun and junB mRNA levels at 30-min and 1 h time points, whereas at later time points, the levels were similar both in the presence and absence of PD98059 (Fig.2B). These results show that both ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK mediate the induction of c-jun and junBexpression in dermal fibroblasts by TNF-α and that both pathways are essential for induction of c-fos expression. Recent studies have shown that activation of NF-κB is required for interleukin-1-induced induction of MMP-1 and MMP-3 expression in rabbit dermal and synovial fibroblasts (27Bond M. Baker A.H. Newby A.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 28Vincenti M.P. Coon C.I. Brinckerhoff C.E. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 1987-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In this context, we also studied whether blocking ERK1/2 and p38 cascades in fibroblasts affects activation of NF-κB by TNF-α. As shown in Fig. 2C, treatment of fibroblasts with TNF-α resulted in rapid phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, and this effect was not altered by cotreatment of cells with SB203580 and PD98059. These results show that inhibition of MMP-1 and MMP-3 expression by SB203580 does not involve inhibition of NF-κB activation. To directly examine the role of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK in regulation of the expression of the endogenous MMP-1 and MMP-3 genes, we utilized adenovirus-mediated gene delivery of constitutively active MEK1, MKK7, MKK3b, and MKK6b to fibroblasts. As shown in Fig. 3(A and B), infection of cells with the recombinant adenovirus RAdMEK1ca, harboring constitutively active MEK1, resulted in marked activation of ERK1/2, but not p38. The activation of ERK1/2 by constitutively active MEK1 was inhibited by PD98059 (40 μm). In parallel, infection of cells with adenoviruses for constitutively active MKK3b (RAdMKK3bE) and MKK6b (RAdMKK6bE) alone or in combination resulted in activation of p38, but not ERK1/2 (Fig. 3A). Infection of cells with RAdMEK1 and RAdMKK3bE or RAdMKK6bE resulted in coordinate activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK (Fig. 3A). Infection of dermal fibroblasts with the adenovirus RAdMKK7D, harboring a constitutively active mutant of MKK7, resulted in activation of JNK as determined by kinase assay using recombinant c-Jun as substrate (Fig. 3B), but had no effect on activation of ERK1/2 or p38 (Fig. 3A). In parallel, adenoviral expression of constitutively active MEK1, MKK3b, or MKK6b had no effect on JNK activity (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, simultaneous expression of constitutively active MKK3b or MKK6b in fibroblasts markedly potentiated the activation of JNK by MKK7D, resulting in a level of JNK activity comparable to that obtained by treatment of dermal fibroblasts with anisomycin (Fig. 3B). Expression of constitutively active MEK1, MKK7, MKK3b, or MKK6b either alone or in the combinations indicated had no effect on total cellular levels of ERK1/2 or p38 (Fig.3A). Infection of cells with control viruses RAd66 and RAdlacZ had no marked effect on the activation of ERK1/2, JNK, or p38 (Fig. 3, A and B). Activation of ERK1/2 by transduction of fibroblasts with RAdMEK1ca resulted in marked enhancement of the abundance of MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNAs as determined by Northern blot hybridizations 24 h after adenoviral infection (Fig. 3C). Activation of p38 MAPK by adenovirally delivered constitutively active MKK3b and MKK6b alone or in combination also resulted in enhancement of MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNA levels, although clearly less potently than obtained with constitutively active MEK1 (Fig. 3C). In addition, expression of constitutively active MKK3b and MKK6b augmented the enhancement of MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNA levels by constitutively active MEK1 alone (Fig. 3C). Production of pro-MMP-1 and pro-MMP-3 by dermal fibroblasts was also enhanced as a r"

In this study, using in vitro and in vivo assays, we show that the association between ataxin-1 and PQBP-1 is positively influenced by expanded polyglutamine sequences. In cell lines, interaction between the two molecules induces apoptotic cell death. As a possible mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we found that mutant ataxin-1 enhances binding of PQBP-1 to the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II large subunit (Pol II). This reduces the level of phosphorylated Pol II and transcription. Our results suggest the involvement of PQBP-1 in the pathology of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) and support the idea that modified transcription underlies polyglutamine-mediated pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2125546204,"Detection of lymphatic endothelal cells (LECs) has been problematic because of the lack of specific markers. The homeobox transcription factor Prox1 is expressed in LECs of murine and avian embryos. We have studied expression of Prox1 in human tissues with immunofluorescence. In 19-wk-old human fetuses, Prox1 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3) are coexpressed in LECs of lymphatic trunks and lymphatic capillaries. Prox1 is located in the nucleus, and its expression is mutually exclusive with that of the blood vascular marker PAL-E. Prox1 is a constitutive marker of LECs and is found in tissues of healthy adults and lymphedema patients. Blood vascular endothelial cells (BECs) of hemangiomas express CD31 and CD34, but not Prox1. A subset of these cells is positive for VEGFR-3. Lymphatics in the periphery of hemangiomas express Prox1 and CD31, but not CD34. In lymphangiomas, LECs express Prox1, CD31, and VEGFR-3, but rarely CD34. In the stroma, spindle-shaped CD34-positive cells are present. We show that Prox1 is a reliable marker for LECs in normal and pathologic human tissues, coexpressed with VEGFR-3 and CD31. VEGFR-3 and CD34 are less reliable markers for LECs and BECs, respectively, because exceptions from their normal expression patterns are found in pathologic tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2162246060,"Neurotransmitter is stored in synaptic vesicles and released by exocytosis into the synaptic cleft. One of the fundamental questions in central synaptic transmission is whether a quantal packet of transmitter saturates postsynaptic receptors. To address this question, we loaded the excitatory transmitter L-glutamate via whole-cell recording pipettes into the giant nerve terminal, the calyx of Held, in rat brainstem slices. This caused marked potentiations of both quantal and action potential-evoked EPSCs mediated by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. These results directly demonstrate that neither AMPA nor NMDA receptors are saturated by a single packet of transmitter, and indicate that vesicular transmitter content is an important determinant of synaptic efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2090935893,"Endocannabinoids serve as retrograde messengers in many brain regions. These diffusible lipophilic molecules are released by postsynaptic cells and regulate presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Here we describe an additional mechanism that mediates the spread of endocannabinoid signaling to distant inhibitory synapses. Depolarization of cerebellar Purkinje cells reduced the firing rate of nearby interneurons, and this reduction in firing was blocked by the cannabinoid receptor antagonist AM251. The cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 also reduced firing rates in interneurons, and this inhibition arose from the activation of a small potassium conductance. Thus, endocannabinoids released from the dendrites of depolarized neurons can lead to inhibition of firing in nearby cells. Because interneurons can project over several hundred micrometers, this inhibition of firing allows cells to regulate synaptic inputs at distances well beyond the limits of endocannabinoid diffusion."

Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 485-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), is thought to play a dominant role in relaxation of smooth muscle in this tissue. The pathophysiological relevance of the cyclic GMP-protein kinase G (PKG) pathway is evidenced by the successful use of cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDE-5) such as sildenafil (Viagra) in the treatment of erectile dysfunction (for review see Ref.3Moreland R.B. Hsieh G. Nakane M. Brioni J.D. J. Pharma. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 225-234PubMed Google Scholar). Other signaling pathways involving vasoactive intestinal polypeptide/cAMP may also be operative in relaxation of the CC. Severe erectile dysfunction in cGMP-dependent kinase 1-deficient mice, with normal cAMP signaling, also demonstrated the importance of PKG and the inability of the cAMP pathway to compensate for the absence of the cGMP signaling cascade in vivo (4Hedlund P. Aszódi A. Pfeifer A. Aim P. Hofmann F. Ahmad M. Fässler R. Andersson K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2349-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 5Pfeifer A. Klatt P.

The contracted (resting) state of the CC smooth muscle is considered to be mediated by release of norepinephrine, endothelin-1, neuropeptide Y, prostanoids, and angiotensin II (1Andersson K.-E.

Inhibition of these agonists at the receptor level or in their downstream signaling pathways should, like NO stimulation, also lead to a decrease in myosin regulatory light chain (RLC20) phosphorylation and consequent relaxation through decreased cytoplasmic [Ca2+] and/or inhibition of Ca2+sensitization (for review see Refs. 12Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar and 13Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. J. Physiol. 2000; 522: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Calcium sensitization is brought about by agonist activation of heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptors, the exchange of GTP for GDP on the small GTPase RhoA, its activation and dissociation from its partner Rho-GDI (guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor). GTP·RhoA activates Rho-kinase, which inhibits myosin light chain phosphatase, resulting in an increase in RLC20 phosphorylation and force at constant [Ca2+] (13Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. J.

A recent study of an in vivo rat model demonstrated that a Rho-kinase inhibitor caused a dramatic increase in CC pressure and erection independent of NO (19Chitaley K. Wingard C.J. Webb R.C.

This finding suggests that the RhoA-Ca2+ sensitization pathway is present and active in the “resting state” of CC smooth muscle. These authors proposed that antagonism of Rho-kinase introduces a potential alternate avenue for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. The Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 (20Uehata M. Ishizaki T.

In this study we directly demonstrate very potent Ca2+sensitization of force in permeabilized rabbit and human CC in which Ca2+ concentrations are clamped and show that a component of this pathway, RhoA, is very highly expressed in CC compared with its content in other smooth muscles; the RhoA binding partner, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI), is also present at high concentrations. Using a Rho binding domain pull-down assay, we also show that, during Ca2+ sensitization with GTPγS, a large fraction of the endogenous RhoA is in the active, GTPγS-bound form, and that the Rho-kinase inhibitor inhibits calcium sensitization induced by GTPγS, phenylephrine, and endothelin-1. Furthermore, the magnitude of relaxation of maximal GTPγS-induced calcium-sensitized force by Y-27632 is 2- to 3-fold greater than by 8-Br-cGMP in rabbit CC. We also find that CC expresses telokin, a target of PKG (25Wu X Haystead T.A.J. Nakamoto R.K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol.

New Zealand rabbits (2–3 kg) were anesthetized with halothane and killed by exsanguination according to protocols approved by the Center for Comparative Medicine at the University of Virginia. The penis was excised, and the CC was dissected free from the tunica albuginea. Human CC specimens were obtained at the time of implantation of a penile implant from four patients, one diagnosed with vasculogenic erectile dysfunction due to atherosclerotic disease and the other three with type II diabetes mellitus. These three patients had failed to achieve an adequate erection for intercourse following administration of the PDE-5 inhibitor sildenafil and intracavernous prostaglandin E1, which raises cAMP. Small strips (0.15–0.2 mm wide and 2 mm long) were cut with razor knives from the regions where longitudinal bundles could be well resolved under a dissecting microscope. The ends of the muscle bundles were tied with monofilament silk to a force transducer and a stationary hook and mounted on a bubble plate for force measurements. After recording the contractile response to high potassium, the muscle was transferred to relaxing solution (G1) containing 1 mm EGTA and permeabilized with 0.1 mg/mlStaphylococcus aureus α-toxin. Maximal Ca2+-activated force was determined at pCa 4.5 (CaG). All solutions and the use of α-toxin and A23187 have been described previously (15Kitazawa T. Masuo M. Somlyo A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Affinity precipitation of active Rho was performed using the Rho binding domain (RBD) of the fusion protein, mDia (33Kimura K. Tsuji T. Takada Y. Miki T. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17233-17236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). pEGX-4T-1 mouse mDia RBD (amino acids 2–304) was introduced in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pTrx, and the GST fusion protein was expressed, conjugated to glutathione beads, and purified. Small strips of CC (0.15–0.2 mm wide and 2 mm long) were permeabilized with α-toxin for 2 h at room temperature, washed in G1, and contracted with pCa6.5. After 10 min, 10 μm GTPγS was added for a predetermined amount of time, and tissues were snap frozen and pulverized at liquid nitrogen temperature. The powder was rapidly homogenized in the homogenization buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and a protease inhibitor mixture (P-8340, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). Homogenized samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min, and a small quantity of supernatant was saved to be analyzed later for total RhoA content. The remaining supernatant was incubated with 30 μg of GST-RBD fusion protein conjugated with glutathione beads at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed twice with homogenization buffer and then resuspended in 48 μl of non-reducing sample buffer with 2 μl of 1 mdithiothreitol and heated to 100 °C for 5min. Positive and negative control samples, into which GTPγS or GDP was exchanged into the endogenous RhoA of rabbit tissues, were homogenized in homogenization buffer and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. For nucleotide exchange, 10 mmEDTA was added to each sample, 1 mm GDP was added to the negative control and 50 μm GTPγS to the positive controls. Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min, and then the reaction was stopped by addition of 60 mmMgCl2. These controls samples were then incubated with glutathione-mDia beads and run in parallel with the tissue samples. After binding to mDia RBD, the samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 4–20% gradient gel. Bound RhoA was detected by Western blot using a monoclonal antibody against RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Strips of rabbit and human CC, strips of rabbit femoral artery and sheets of the longitudinal muscle of rabbit ileum at rest or following stimulation were homogenized in ice-cold buffer (250 mm sucrose, 25 mm Tris, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture, see above), pH 7.4. Tissue homogenates were submitted to SDS-PAGE with 8% polyacrylamide for MYPT-1, PP1δ, ROKα, and ROKβ and 12% for all other proteins followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk and phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBST) for 1 h and then incubated with primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. The following dilutions of primary antibodies were used: anti-RhoA (monoclonal antibody SC-418, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 1:10,000, rabbit polyclonal anti-telokin antibody prepared against recombinant full-length rabbit telokin at 1:1,000, anti-MLC20 (monoclonal antibody, Sigma) at 1:200, anti-GDI (rabbit polyclonal antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:5,000, anti-Rho-kinase ROKα (monoclonal antibody, Transduction Laboratories) at 1:1,000, anti-ROKβ (monoclonal antibody, Transduction Laboratories) at 1:500, anti-MYPT-1 (sheep polyclonal antibody (Upstate, Waltham, MA) at 1:1,000, anti-PP1δ (Upstate) at 1:5,000, anti-CPI-17 (rabbit polyclonal) at 1:2,000 (34Eto M. Wong L. Yazawa M. Brautigan D.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 46: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The blots were washed in PBST, incubated in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies to mouse, rabbit, or sheep for 1 h at room temperature and detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein signals were quantitated by densitometry using an Epson Expression 1600 scanner (Long Beach, CA) and the IMAGE Gel Quantitation Program (National Institutes of Health). Protein was determined with the Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit. Quantitation of RhoA, GDI, telokin, and MLC20 in tissues was carried out in the linear range of the antibody reactivity. For electron microscopy, strips of CC smooth muscle were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde with 0.1% tannic acid in cacodylate buffer followed by osmium tetroxide, stained with uranyl acetate en bloc, dehydrated, and embedded in Spurr's resin. Sections were viewed in a Phillips CM12 electron microscope. The respective activities of the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 and of 8-Br-cGMP to relax permeabilized Ca2+-sensitized CC muscle strips were compared (Fig. 1). Muscles were maximally sensitized with GTPγS or endothelin plus GTP with Ca2+ concentrations clamped at pCa 6.9–6.7. GTPγS (10 μm) and endothelin (100 nm) were highly effective in eliciting Ca2+sensitization. 10 μm GTPγS induced Ca2+sensitization as follows: 64% ± 11.6 S.D. of maximal Ca-induced force (pCa 4.5) (n = 42) in rabbit CC and 52% ± 4.9 S.D. (n = 7) in several strips from three human CC specimens. Endothelin induced Ca2+ sensitization as follows: 35% ± 5.2 S.D. of pCa 4.5 (n = 11) in rabbit CC and 46% ± 4.1 S.D. (n = 6) in human CC. Phenylephrine-induced Ca2+ sensitization in rabbit CC was significantly smaller, ∼10–20% of the CaG response. Y-27632 (10 μm) completely reversed the GTPγS-, endothelin-, and phenylephrine-induced Ca2+ sensitization force. Saturating concentrations of 8-Br-cGMP (50 μm) produced only a small relaxation of GTPγS-induced Ca2+ sensitization in rabbit CC, whereas subsequent addition of 10 μm Y-27632 induced complete relaxation of endothelin-, phenylephrine-, or GTPγS-mediated Ca2+ sensitization. The results showing inhibition of maximal GTPγS- induced Ca2+ sensitization are summarized in Fig. 2 where 50 μm 8-Br-cGMP induced 35% ± 11.4 S.D. (n= 13) relaxation compared with 97% ± 4.3 S.D. (n = 10) relaxation induced by 10 μm Y-27632. The IC50 = 0.9 μm for Y-27632-induced relaxation of GTPγS-mediated Ca2+ sensitization is shown in Fig.3. 8-Br-cGMP was more effective in relaxing endothelin than GTPγS-mediated Ca2+sensitization, 96% ± 4.4 S.D. (n = 7) in rabbit CC. In several strips of human CC obtained from three of the patients, Y-27632 completely relaxed GTPγS as well as endothelin plus GTP-induced calcium sensitization (n = 3) with a similar sensitivity as found in rabbit CC (Fig.4); 50 μm 8-Br-cGMP was more effective than in the rabbit CC (compare Figs. 1 and 4). As in the rabbit CC (Fig. 1C), even when 8-Br-cGMP induced a large reversal of sensitized force, subsequent additions of Y-27632 induced a further relaxation (Fig. 4, A and D).FIG. 2Summary of the comparison of the effects of 10 μm Y-27632 and 50 μm 8-Br-cGMP on GTPγS-induced calcium sensitization in α-toxin-permeabilized rabbit cavernosal smooth muscle at constant Ca2+.

Rabbit ileum smooth muscle is included for comparison with rabbit and human CC. Because the CC has an exceedingly high content of connective tissue relative to smooth muscle, to obtain comparable estimates of the concentrations of RhoA, Rho·GDI, and telokin in smooth muscle, the concentrations were normalized to tissue myosin content estimated from known concentrations of purified turkey gizzard myosin loaded on the same gel (Fig. 5D). The myosin in the standards and tissue specimens was detected with an antibody to MLC20. Comparison of myosin contents detected by Western blotting with a MLC20 antibody (Fig. 5D) clearly shows the lower myosin content of equal protein loads in the cavernosum samples compared with rabbit ileum as well as the significantly higher RhoA content (Fig. 5A) and Rho·GDI (Fig. 5B) in cavernosum compared with ileum at equal protein loads, which is obvious even without correcting for the lower cellular content of the CC samples. The relative amounts of myosin, telokin, and RhoA in the CC and rabbit ileum, estimated by comparison with known concentrations of those proteins, are shown in Table I. The myosin content per microgram of total protein in the ileum is 3.4 times that in the rabbit CC. The RhoA content per microgram of total protein was 5.3 ng in the corpus compared with 1.1 ng in the ileum sample. Correcting for the large contribution of connective tissue to total protein in the CC by normalizing the RhoA measurements to the myosin content results in a 17-fold higher RhoA concentration in the rabbit CC than in rabbit ileum; the relative expression of telokin was not significantly different. A similar 16-fold greater RhoA content was measured in human CC samples compared with rabbit ileum (Fig. 5). Normalization of Rho·GDI to myosin content in the same sample (not shown) also gave a content that was ∼17-fold higher in CC than in ileum smooth muscle.Table IProtein contents in rabbit corpus cavernosum1 μg of total rabbit corpus cavernosum protein1 μg of total ileum proteinngMyosin19.065.0Telokin4.019.0RhoA5.31.1 Open table in a new tab The density of myosin filaments seen in electron micrographs of rabbit CC smooth muscle (Fig. 6) was typical of other smooth muscles such as ileum, showing normal arrays of myosin and actin filaments with a high actin to myosin ratio, justifying our above normalization of RhoA content to myosin content. Incidentally, a well-developed sarcoplasmic reticulum forming surface couplings with the plasma membrane as well as the presence of a basement membrane were also observed. To determine whether the very high concentrations of CC RhoA were accessible to activation during Ca2+ sensitization with GTPγS, we used a pull-down assay for GTP·RhoA. The mDia Rho binding domain (RBD) conjugated with glutathione beads extracted a larger fraction of RhoA·GTPγS per total RhoA in the homogenate from rabbit CC compared with rabbit ileum under identical assay conditions (Fig.7). The RhoA remaining in the supernatant may have also included some GTPγS·RhoA, because the extent of extraction depends on the amount of mDia-bound beads used in the assay, which, for technical reasons, we could not increase further. Positive and negative controls illustrate that the assay extracts GTPγS-bound but not GDP-bound RhoA from tissue homogenates treated to load the given nucleotide onto the endogenous RhoA. These results indicate that the highly expressed RhoA in CC is correctly folded and available to be activated by Ca2+ sensitization. Other proteins, thought to participate in Ca2+sensitization signaling pathways such as Rho-kinase, myosin phosphatase regulatory subunit MYPT-1, PP1δ, and the myosin phosphatase inhibitor protein CPI-17 were also detected in human and rabbit CC (Figs. 8 and 9). ROKα content at identical protein loading was greater in both human and rabbit CC compared with ileum, even without correcting for the lower myosin content in the CC (Fig. 8A). The reverse relationship occurred with ROKβ content. Rabbit femoral artery contained both isoforms. The absolute amounts of ROKα and β could not be quantitated due to the lack of recombinant ROK proteins and the unknown differences in sensitivities of the two antibodies used for detection. The MYPT-1 and PP1δ contents in both human and rabbit CC, scaling to myosin contents, were similar to the phasic rabbit ileum and greater than in the tonic femoral artery (Fig. 8B). CPI-17 content in the rabbit CC (Fig. 9A), scaled to myosin content (Fig. 9B), was much closer to the femoral artery than the ileum. In the three samples of human CC, CPI-17 Western blots resulted in a lower molecular weight protein than found in rabbit CC, ileum, or femoral artery.FIG. 9Comparison of CPI-17 content in corpus cavernosum ( CC ), ileum (IL), and femoral artery (FA) samples under identical protein loads and detected by Western blotting.

Brioni J.D. J. Pharma. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 225-234PubMed Google Scholar) and may act on intact tissue by modulating both cytoplasmic calcium levels and/or Ca2+ sensitivity (36Lincoln T.M. Dey N.

The use of permeabilized CC allowed us to test directly the role of RhoA-mediated Ca2+ sensitization, and its reversal by a Rho-kinase inhibitor with Ca2+ concentrations clamped allowing changes in force to reflect Ca2+-independent mechanisms, such as modulation of myosin phosphatase activity. The magnitudes of Ca2+ sensitization induced by GTPγS were unusually large, ∼64% (range 44–91%) of maximal calcium-induced force in rabbit CC and ∼52% in human CC, compared with 20–45% observed in other smooth muscles (24Fu X.

https://openalex.org/W2003019920,"The steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) proteins comprise a well-characterized family of nuclear receptor (NR) coactivators that increase transcriptional activation by NRs via covalent modification of chromatin proteins and recruitment of other coactivators. We have recently shown that the SRC family member GRIP1 interacts with a class of SUMO-1 (small ubiquitin-like modifier 1) E3 ligases, the PIAS proteins, and that the coactivator is subjected to SUMO-1 modifications (sumoylation). In this work, we demonstrate that lysine residues 239, 731, and 788 of GRIP1 serve as principal attachment sites for SUMO-1. Lys-731 and Lys-788 are located in the NR interaction domain (NID), and their substitution by arginines impairs the ability of GRIP1 to colocalize with androgen receptor (AR) in nuclei. Likewise, Lys-731 and Lys-788 mutants of GRIP1 have attenuated ability to enhance AR-dependent transcription and fail to synergize with PIASxβ-mediated activation of AR function, indicating that sumoylation modifies the ability of GRIP1 to function as a steroid receptor coactivator. The Lys-731 sumoylation site is conserved in SRC-3 and SRC-1, and the NIDs of the latter coactivators harbor one or two additional sites matching with the consensus sites for SUMO-1 attachment, respectively, suggesting a more general role for the modification in the regulation of SRC protein activity.

The SRC proteins interact with the NRs in a ligand-dependent manner and enhance transcriptional activity of the receptors via recruitment of additional cofactors such as CBP/p300 and proteins with acetyltransferase or methyltransferase activity. The activation domain 1 (AD1) of SRC proteins (amino acids 1040–1120 in GRIP1, Fig. 1A) is responsible for binding to the cointegrator CBP/p300 (5Voegel J.J. Heine M.J.S. Tini M. Vivat V. Chambon P.

The C terminus of SRC proteins that contains the activation domain 2 (AD2) binds other coactivator proteins, such as the arginine methyltransferase CARM1 and the Zac1 protein (13Chen D., Ma, H.

Even though many mechanistic aspects of NR and coregulator function have become more clear, the ways by which these proteins compartmentalize in cell nuclei together with factors regulating dynamics of coactivator-receptor complex formation and exchange have remained elusive. Post-translational modifications allow fast alterations in protein-protein interactions in protein assemblies or subcellular structures and thus potentially control the dynamics and exchange of steroid receptor-coactivator complexes. Recent evidence indicates that phosphorylation indeed regulates the activity of SRC proteins. Elimination of two mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) sites of SRC-1 attenuated its ability to coactivate progesterone receptor-dependent transcription (15Rowan B.G. Garrison N. Weigel N.L. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8720-8730Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation of GRIP1 and AIB1 have been implicated in their regulation (16Lopez G.N. Turck C.W. Schaufele F. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22177-22182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 17Font de Mora J. Brown M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5041-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), and in the case of AIB1 phosphorylation stimulates recruitment of p300 (17Font de Mora J. Brown M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5041-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Acetylation of ACTR by CBP/p300 in turn disrupts the association of this coactivator with NRs (18Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) modification (sumoylation) is a recently characterized covalent modification leading to attachment of SUMO to specific lysine residues of target proteins, especially nuclear proteins (19Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 20Yeh E.T.H. Gong L. Kamitani T.

Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Even though sumoylation is mechanistically similar to ubiquitination, sumoylation does not promote protein degradation. Instead, the modification appears to regulate protein-protein interactions and protein targeting. SUMO proteins can be divided into two families, SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/SUMO-3 proteins (19Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 20Yeh E.T.H. Gong L. Kamitani T.

Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). In ubiquitination, E3 ubiquitin ligases that promote ubiquitin transfer from the E2 enzyme to the target lysine are responsible for substrate specificity (22Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PIAS proteins that interact with steroid receptors and GRIP1 and modulate their transcriptional activity (23Kotaja N. Aittomäki S. Silvennoinen O. Palvimo J.J. Jänne O.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1986-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 24Kotaja N. Vihinen M. Palvimo J.J. Jänne O.A. J. Biol.

In this work, we have identified the principal SUMO-1 acceptor sites in GRIP1 and show that the sites located in the NID regulate the function of this SRC protein. Conversion of the SUMO-1 acceptor lysines to arginines in the NID impairs nuclear colocalization of GRIP1 with AR and compromises the activity of GRIP1 on AR-dependent transcription. Our results suggest that SUMO-1 modification can act as a novel determinant in NR-SRC interactions. pARE2TATA-LUC and pPB(-285/+32)-LUC have been described previously (28Moilanen A.-M. Poukka H.

Shuai, respectively. pGST-Ulp1 was obtained from Dr. M. Hochstrasser. pSG5-GRIP1 Lys → Arg mutants (K239R, K1452R, K731R/K788R, and K239R/K731R/K788R) were generated using the site-directed mutagenesis system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). COS-1 cells and HeLa cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing penicillin (25 units/ml), streptomycin (25 units/ml) and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS). HeLa cells were supplemented with non-essential amino acids. Cells were seeded for reporter gene assays and immunoprecipitations onto 12-well plates (3 × 104 cells) or 6-cm dishes (3 × 105 cells), respectively, and transfected 24 h later using FuGENE reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions with the amounts of plasmids specified in figure legends. The medium was changed to one containing 10% charcoal-stripped (CS) FBS 4 h before transfection. 20 h after transfection the cells received fresh medium containing 2% CS FBS with or without 100 nm testosterone or dexamethasone. 48 h after transfection the cells were harvested, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined (29Ikonen T. Palvimo J.J. Jänne O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29821-29828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline, and cell extracts were prepared in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.3% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1:200 protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide). Concentrated (2×) SDS sample buffer was added to lysate samples, and after heating at 95 °C for 5 min proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Hybond enhanced chemiluminescence nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). GRIP1 was detected with mouse monoclonal anti-GRIP1 antibody (NeoMarkers) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Immunocomplexes were visualized with ECL Western blotting detection reagents from Amersham Biosciences. Immunoprecipitation of GRIP1 from cell extracts was performed with mouse monoclonal anti-GRIP1 antibody. Bound proteins were released in 2× SDS sample buffer and immunoblotted with monoclonal antibody against GMP-1 (SUMO-1) (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. COS-1 cells grown on glass coverslips (1.5 × 105cells/well) on six-well plates were transfected with FuGENE with 0.75 μg of pEGFP-AR with or without pSG5-GRIP1, and the total amount of DNA was balanced to 1.5 μg with empty pSG5. 24 h after transfection the cells received fresh medium with 2% CS FBS containing vehicle or testosterone after which they were fixed with paraformaldehyde (4% in phosphate-buffered saline) and permeabilized with Triton X-100 (30Poukka H. Karvonen U. Yoshikawa N. Tanaka H. Palvimo J.J. Jänne O.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2991-3001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence labeling was performed with Rhodamine-Red-X-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) recognizing monoclonal anti-GRIP1 (a gift from Dr. Myles Brown). Fluorescence analysis was carried out with the Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal laser system (488 nm excitation for EGFP and 568 nm for rhodamine) connected to the Zeiss Axiovert 135M microscope using a ×63, 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective. Both channels were excited, collected separately, and merged for the inspection of colocalization. Four lysine residues (Lys-239, Lys-731, Lys-788, and Lys-1452) in the GRIP1 sequence fulfill the consensus SUMO-1 attachment sequence ΨKXE (where Ψ is a large hydrophobic residue and X represents any amino acid) found in an overwhelming number of the SUMO-1 substrates (31Rodriquez M.S. Dargemont C. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12654-12659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). To examine whether these lysine residues serve as SUMO-1 acceptors in mammalian cells, GRIP1 was expressed in COS-1 cells without or with SUMO-1, and the cell lysates were immunoblotted with the anti-GRIP1 antibody. Expression of wild-type GRIP1 with SUMO-1 yielded four to five additional, slower migrating forms that were detected with anti-GRIP1 antibody (Fig.1B), suggesting that GRIP1 is modified by SUMO-1 at multiple sites. Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with anti-GRIP1 antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-SUMO-1 antibody verified that the slower migrating bands indeed corresponded to GRIP1 covalently modified by SUMO-1 (Fig.1C). Mutation of Lys-239 to arginine (K239R) changed the sumoylation pattern of GRIP1 leading to disappearance of the slowest migrating sumoylated band, whereas conversion of the C-terminally located Lys-1452 to arginine did not influence the extent of GRIP1 sumoylation. By contrast, concomitant mutation of the Lys-731 and Lys-788 residues (K731R/K788R) located in the NID abolished most of the sumoylated forms of GRIP (Fig. 1, B and C). Thus, lysines 239, 731, and 788 of GRIP1 serve as major SUMO-1 acceptors. However, since the K239R/K731R/K788R triple mutant exhibited a low level of sumoylation (i.e. one or two weak anti-SUMO-1 immunoreactive bands (Fig. 1)) additional conjugation site(s) may exist. Alternatively, elimination of the major sumoylation sites of GRIP1 may enable sumoylation of Lys-1452 that is not otherwise subjected to this modification. SUMO-1 was thought to be incapable of forming polymers (32Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35368-35374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), but SUMO-1 chain formation has recently been demonstrated on nucleoporin RanBP2 (33Pichler A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F. Cell. 2002; 108: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). However, mechanistic aspects of (poly)SUMO formation and characteristics of the SUMO-1-SUMO-1 linkage are unknown. Treatment of immunopurified GRIP1 with Ulp1, a SUMO-specific protease (34Li S-J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), yielded monomers rather than species indicative of SUMO-1 multimers, 2N. Kotaja, U. Karvonen, O. A. Jänne, and J. J. Palvimo, unpublished observations. implying that sumoylation of GRIP1 corresponds to attachment of SUMO-1 monomers to specific lysine acceptors. Sumoylation plays a role in protein targeting (19Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 21Müller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). To elucidate whether substitutions of SUMO-1 acceptor sites in GRIP1 alter subcellular distribution or localization of GRIP1 in relation to AR, full-length AR fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP-AR) and wild-type GRIP1 or GRIP1 mutants were coexpressed in COS-1 cells. GRIP1 was visualized by monoclonal antibody against GRIP1 along with a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody. When expressed alone, wild-type GRIP1 typically resided in round nuclear granules that were considerably larger in size and fewer in number than the holoAR foci 3U. Karvonen, O. A. Jänne, and J. J. Palvimo, FEBS Lett., in press. (Fig.2A). Interestingly, coexpression of holoAR with wild-type GRIP1 elicited coactivator redistribution in nuclei, resulting in a complete colocalization with AR (Fig. 2B). The overall nuclear distribution of GRIP1(K731R/K788R) or other GRIP1 mutants alone did not differ from that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 2, C and H).2 However, the K731R/K788R mutant showed significantly diminished colocalization with AR in that one-half of the cells expressing both proteins displayed the GRIP1 mutant in nuclear foci that were distinct from AR granules (Fig. 2E). The colocalization pattern of GRIP1(K239R/K731R/K788R) was comparable to that of GRIP1(K731R/K788R),2 whereas that of GRIP1(K239R) was only slightly impaired (see Fig. 2, G and H). Distribution of the GRIP1(K1452R) was indistinguishable from that of wild-type GRIP1 with respect to colocalization with AR.2These results indicate that sumoylation sites in the NID of GRIP play a role in targeting or recruitment of the coactivator to AR-containing subnuclear sites. To study the importance of GRIP1's sumoylation sites on AR-dependent transcription, COS-1 cells were transfected with ARE2TATA-LUC containing two androgen response elements in front of a TATA-box together with AR and wild-type GRIP1 or GRIP1 mutants. Wild-type GRIP1 activated AR-dependent transcription in a dose-dependent manner yielding a ≥7-fold enhancement in transcription (Fig.3A). GRIP1(K731R/K788R) and GRIP1(K239R/K731R/K788R) mutants were unable to activate AR-dependent transcription to the same extent as wild-type GRIP1 (∼4-fold versus ≥7-fold). By contrast, the activity of GRIP1(K239R) was only slightly less than that of wild-type GRIP1, and the Lys-1452 → Arg conversion did not influence the ability of GRIP1 to activate AR-dependent transcription. These results are in line with the impaired ability of NID-mutated GRIP1 forms to colocalize with AR in nuclei. The attenuated transcriptional activity of GRIP1(K731R/K788R) and GRIP1(K239R/K731R/K788R) cannot be explained by alterations in the levels of expressed proteins (Fig.3B). The effects of the substitutions of SUMO-1 acceptor sites in GRIP1 on the function of AR were not specific for transformed COS-1 cells since GRIP1(K731R/K788R) and GRIP1(K239R/K731R/K788R) displayed severely attenuated ability to coactivate the receptor also in HeLa cells (Fig. 3C). Moreover, the effects of NID mutations were not selective for AR, as these mutations also blunted the activity of GRIP1 on glucocorticoid receptor-dependent transcription; both GRIP1(K731R/K788R) and GRIP1(K239R/K731R/K788R) displayed only ∼50% of the activity of the wild-type protein. Lysines 731 and 788 of GRIP1 are located in the NID region. Therefore, we also tested whether mutations of these sites attenuate the function of GRIP1 on AR LBD in isolation. To this end expression vectors encoding AR LBD fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain, and wild-type GRIP1 or GRIP1 mutants were expressed in COS-1 cells. The activity of AR AF-2 was measured by using a reporter driven by Gal4-binding sites (G5-LUC). In agreement with our previous results (29Ikonen T. Palvimo J.J. Jänne O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29821-29828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), the holoAR LBD alone was transcriptionally silent in COS-1 cells, but ectopic expression of wild-type GRIP1 yielded a ≥40-fold activation of AR LBD-dependent transcription (Fig.4A). Mutation of Lys-239 or Lys-1452 failed to influence the activity of GRIP1 on AR LBD in isolation, but GRIP1(K731R/K788R) had less than half of wild-type GRIP1 activity. Thus, the sumoylation sites located in the NID influence the interaction of the coactivator with the AR LBD. In keeping with these results the NID mutations did not alter the function of the coactivator on an AR mutant devoid of the whole LBD (ARΔ641–902, Ref. 29Ikonen T. Palvimo J.J. Jänne O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29821-29828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) (Fig.4B). To study the importance of SUMO-1 acceptor sites of GRIP1 for its transcriptional synergism with PIAS proteins (24Kotaja N. Vihinen M. Palvimo J.J. Jänne O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17781-17788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), wild-type GRIP1 or GRIP1(K239R/K731R/K788R) was expressed with and without PIAS1 or Miz1 (PIASxβ), and their effects on AR-dependent transcription were assayed. A small amount of PIASxβ or PIAS1 alone caused only a modest 1.6- or 1.2-fold transcriptional enhancement, respectively (Fig.5). When wild-type GRIP1 was expressed together with PIASxβ or PIAS1, their effects were clearly more than additive in that AR-dependent transcription was activated by 15.1- or 10.1-fold, respectively, versus 5.3-fold activation by GRIP1 alone (Fig. 5). Elimination of the three sumoylation sites in GRIP1 blunted the synergism with PIAS proteins, as only 5.6- or 3.2-fold activation of AR-dependent transcription was seen when the GRIP1(K239R/K731R/K788R) was coexpressed with PIASxβ or PIAS1, respectively. These results imply that the SUMO-1 modifications of GRIP1 are involved in the transcriptional cooperation between GRIP1 and PIAS proteins. In this work, we have characterized SUMO-1 modification of the nuclear receptor coactivator protein GRIP1 and shown that residues Lys-239, Lys-731, and Lys-788 of GRIP1 act as potential SUMO-1 acceptors. Lys-731 and Lys-788 are located in the NID, and their concomitant mutation abolishes most of GRIP1 sumoylation. The NID harbors three LXXLL motifs (NR-boxes), and Lys-731 is located between NR-boxes II and III, whereas Lys-788 resides C-terminally to NR-box III. The latter two NR-boxes are crucial for the ability of GRIP1 to bind to NRs, with the NR-box III being essential for the interaction with AR LBD (11Ding X.F. Anderson C.M., Ma, H. Hong H. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, GRIP1(K731R/K788R) that carries two substitutions in the NID exhibited markedly compromised ability to enhance transcription dependent on holoAR and also showed attenuated activity on AR LBD in isolation. It is worth pointing out that GRIP1 function was blunted by the K731R/K788R mutation to an extent comparable to that elicited by a compound mutation disrupting NR-boxes II and III (35Ma H. Hong H. Huang S-M. Irvine R.A. Webb P. Kushner P.J. Coetzee G.A. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6164-6173Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Moreover, the effects of these mutations are not restricted to AR, as they also influence the activity of GRIP1 on glucocorticoid receptor-dependent transcription. Intriguingly, the Lys-731 sumoylation site is conserved in the two other members of the SRC family, SRC-1 and SRC-3, and the NIDs of these coactivators harbor one (Lys-786 in SRC-3) or two (Lys-780 and Lys-806 in SRC-1) additional sites matching the consensus motif for SUMO-1 attachment. SUMO-1 modifications are involved in the regulation of subcellular and subnuclear targeting and localization of proteins (19Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 21Müller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The best characterized examples include RanGAP1 and promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). Attachment of SUMO-1 to RanGAP1 targets it to the nuclear pore complex and during mitosis to the kinetochores and mitotic spindles (36Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar, 37Joseph J. Tan S.H. Karpova T.S. McNally J.G. Dasso M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Modification of PML by SUMO-1 directs it to subnuclear domains termed PML nuclear bodies (38Müller S. Matunis M.J. Dejean A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Sumoylation also regulates protein-protein complex formation. Attachment of SUMO-1 to PML is needed for PML-mediated recruitment of other proteins (39Ishov A.M. Sotnikov A.G. Negorev D. Vladimirova O.V. Neff N. Kamitani T. Yeh E.T.H. Strauss III, J.F. Maul G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). In view of these data, one can envision that SUMO-1 modifications also modulate transcription factor-coregulator targeting. In agreement with this notion, the reduced transcriptional activity of the GRIP1 NID mutant was accompanied by its impaired colocalization with AR in nuclei, suggesting that sumoylation of GRIP1 at specific sites is involved in targeting the coactivator to AR-containing domains. By and large, the factors influencing subnuclear localization and targeting of steroid receptors and their coactivators are poorly understood. Therefore, it is not currently clear why the localization pattern of GRIP1(K731R/K788R) in relation to AR varied among the cells; about one-half of the unsynchronized cells showed the two proteins in separate nuclear compartments, whereas the other half displayed a colocalization pattern indistinguishable from that of wild-type GRIP1. Potential explanations include cell cycle-related factors that influence nuclear architecture. GRIP1 has recently been shown to localize in nuclear foci, a subset of which associates with the PML bodies (40Baumann C.T., Ma, H. Wolford R. Reyes J.C. Maruvada P. Lim C. Yen P.M. Stallcup M.R. Hager G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 15: 485-500Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and it is plausible that the sumoylation of GRIP1 influences the tethering of the coactivator to these bodies. Interestingly, association of certain proteins with the PML bodies is indeed regulated with the cell cycle (41Grobelny J.V. Godwin A.K. Broccoli D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 133: 4577-4585Google Scholar, 42Wu G. Lee W.-H. Chen P.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30618-30622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Many DNA-binding transcription factors, such as AR, p53, c-Myb and c-Jun are subjected to SUMO-1 modification (43Poukka H. Karvonen U. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14145-14150Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 44Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M.P. Lain S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Hay R.T.

Chem. 2002; 277: 8999-9009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Elimination of sumoylation sites from these proteins increases their transcriptional activity in most instances. In view of this it was somewhat unexpected that mutations of the SUMO-1 acceptor sites in GRIP1 attenuated their activity on AR-dependent transcription. However, it is possible that SUMO-1 modifications of AR and GRIP1 occur at different stages of AR-transcription complex formation to serve distinct roles in gene activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies have shown that estrogen receptor α and coactivators assemble on target promoters in a fashion that is sequential and rapidly cycling (47Shang Y., Hu, X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). Because SUMO-1 modification is a specific, reversible, and highly dynamic process, it may provide an important means to regulate assembly and disassembly of transcriptional complexes. We hypothesize that PIAS protein-promoted sumoylation of GRIP1 (25Kotaja N. Karvonen U. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5222-5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) enables the recruitment of the coactivator along with a PIAS protein from subnuclear domains to AR-containing sites. Subsequently, AR-bound GRIP1 recruits CBP/p300 and other coactivators to the promoter, which in turn leads to activation of target gene transcription. Sumoylation of AR may take place after the first cycle of transcription has commenced, leading to displacement of the receptor from DNA. The involvement of PIAS proteins in this assembly is supported by our findings that these proteins act in a synergistic fashion with GRIP1 in steroid receptor-dependent transcription (24Kotaja N. Vihinen M. Palvimo J.J. Jänne O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17781-17788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As shown in the current study, this synergism is abolished when the SUMO-1 acceptor sites of GRIP1 are mutated. Sumoylation may also regulate CBP/p300 function, since the two proteins possess three potential SUMO-1 acceptor sites at their bromo domain adjacent to their acetyltransferase domain. In view of this it is interesting that SUMO-1 modification of histone deacetylase 1 has recently been shown to potentiate its activity (48David G. Neptune M.A. DePinho R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23658-23663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Taken together, SUMO-1 modification is emerging as an important control mechanism in subnuclear targeting and protein-protein interactions. Its role in the regulation of steroid receptor-coactivator assemblies warrants further studies.

https://openalex.org/W2139237590,"An in vitro model has been developed to study migration, survival, proliferation, and capillary-like differentiation of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs) in an environment that avoids tumor promoters and complex matrices. HMVEC monolayers were plated, then induced to form three-dimensional, capillary-like networks by overlaying with human type I collagen followed by a second overlay of collagen with embedded fibroblasts. Detachment and migration of endothelial cells into the matrix was triggered within hours by the overlaying collagen, and the fibroblasts stimulated survival and formation of cords, vacuoles, tubes, and, after 4 to 5 days, capillary networks. The differentiation into branching capillary-like structures was dependent on direct fibroblast-endothelial cell contact and was not achieved when fibroblasts were replaced by seven types of melanoma cells, which included radial and vertical growth phase primary and metastatic stages. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), when overexpressed in fibroblasts, stimulated endothelial cell proliferation and migration, whereas angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) had only motogenic effects. Neutralizing antibodies against VEGF and blocking antibodies for VEGF-receptor 2 (VEGFR2) significantly inhibited but not completely obliterated capillary network formation, suggesting that the VEGF signaling pathway is important but not exclusive and that other fibroblast-derived soluble factors and fibroblast-endothelial cell contact are essential for endothelial cell survival and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2056003659,"Perception can change nonlinearly with stimulus contrast, and perceptual threshold may depend on the direction of contrast change. Such hysteresis effects in neurometric functions provide a signature of perceptual awareness. We recorded brain activity with functional neuroimaging in observers exposed to gradual contrast changes of initially hidden visual stimuli. Lateral occipital, frontal, and parietal regions all displayed both transient activations and hysteresis that correlated with change and maintenance of a percept, respectively. Medial temporal activity did not follow perception but increased during hysteresis and showed transient deactivations during perceptual transitions. These findings identify a set of brain regions sensitive to visual awareness and suggest that medial temporal structures may provide backward signals that account for neural and, thereby, perceptual hysteresis."

In a genetic screen for C. elegans mutants exhibiting partial defects in motor axon projections, we isolated the max-1 gene (required for motor neuron axon guidance). max-1 loss-of-function mutations cause fully penetrant but variable axon guidance defects. Mutations in unc-5 and unc-6, but not in unc-40, dominantly enhance the mutant phenotypes of max-1, whereas overexpression of unc-5 or unc-6, but not of unc-40, bypasses the requirement for max-1. MAX-1 proteins contain PH, MyTH4, and FERM domains and appear to be localized to neuronal processes. Human MAX-1 and UNC5H2 colocalize in discrete subcellular regions of transfected cells. Our results suggest a possible role for MAX-1 in netrin-induced axon repulsion by modulating the UNC-5 receptor signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2055688463,"The generation of extracellular oxidants by neutrophils has been widely investigated, but knowledge about the chemical reactions that occur in the phagolysosome, the cellular compartment that kills pathogens, is more limited. One important pathway may involve the production of potent halogenating agents such as hypochlorous acid (HOCl) by the myeloperoxidase-hydrogen peroxide-halide system. However, explorations of the oxidation chemistry of phagolysosomes have been hampered by the organelle's inaccessibility. To overcome this limitation, we recovered Escherichia coli that had been internalized by human neutrophils. We then analyzed the bacterial proteins for 3-chlorotyrosine, a stable marker of damage by HOCl. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that levels of 3-chlorotyrosine in E. coli proteins increased markedly after the bacteria were internalized by human neutrophils. This increase failed to occur in E. coli exposed to neutrophils deficient in NADPH oxidase or myeloperoxidase, implicating H(2)O(2) and myeloperoxidase in the halogenation reaction. The extent of protein chlorination by normal neutrophils paralleled bacterial killing. Our observations support the view that the phagolysosome of human neutrophils uses the myeloperoxidase-hydrogen peroxide-chloride system to chlorinate bacterial proteins. In striking contrast, human neutrophils failed to nitrate bacterial proteins unless the medium was supplemented with 1 mm nitrite, and the level of nitration was low. Protein chlorination associated with bacterial killing was unaffected by the presence of nitrite in the medium. Nitration required NADPH oxidase but appeared to be independent of myeloperoxidase, suggesting that neutrophils can nitrate proteins through a pathway that requires nitrite but is independent of myeloperoxidase."

Neuronal activity regulates polyamine synthesis, yet whether this affects Ca2+-AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission is unknown. We test whether 4 hr of increased visual stimulation regulates glutamatergic retino-tectal synapses in Xenopus tadpoles. Tectal neurons containing Ca2+-AMPARs form a gradient along the rostro-caudal developmental axis. These neurons had inwardly rectifying AMPAR-mediated EPSCs. Four hours of visual stimulation or addition of intracellular spermine increased rectification in immature neurons. Polyamine synthesis inhibitors blocked the effect of visual stimulation, suggesting that visual activity regulates AMPARs via the polyamine synthesis pathway. This modulation resulted in changes in the integrative properties of tectal neurons. Regulation of polyamine synthesis by physiological stimuli is a novel form of modulation of synaptic transmission important for understanding the short-term effects of enhanced sensory experience during development."
https://openalex.org/W2038315213,"Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a human disease characterized by sensitivity to sunlight, severe neurological abnormalities, and accelerated aging.

Bioessays. 1996; 18: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). There are two complementation groups of CS, CS-A and CS-B. The CSBgene (CSB) encodes the CSB protein (CSB) with 1493 amino acids and a molecular mass of 168 kDa (2Troelstra C. Odijk H. de Wit J. Westerveld A. Thompson L.H. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Mol.

Cell. 1992; 71: 939-953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). An important clinical feature of CS-B is accelerated aging. Thus, CS-B may be a useful model for studying the aging process in humans. Fibroblasts from CS-B patients are hypersensitive to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and show delayed recovery of RNA synthesis after exposure (1Friedberg E.C. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). CS-B cells have a pronounced defect in repair of UV radiation-induced DNA damage in actively transcribed genes (4Venema J. Mullenders L.H. Natarajan A.T. van Zeeland A.A. Mayne L.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4707-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). UV radiation-induced DNA damages are mostly bulky helix-distorting lesions that are removed by nucleotide-excision repair (NER). The transcription-coupled repair (TCR) pathway specifically removes these lesions in actively transcribed genes (5Balajee A.S. Bohr V.A. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 250: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). CS-B cells are deficient in TCR, and this is thought to be the molecular basis of some features of the CS phenotype (6van Hoffen A. Natarajan A.T. Mayne L.V. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H. Venema J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5890-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), especially the increased sensitivity to UV radiation. However, it is unlikely that the TCR defect and the resulting UV radiation sensitivity of CS-B cells account for other clinical features of CS such as progressive neurodegeneration. Thus, CS-B cells may be deficient in other processes besides TCR of UV radiation-induced DNA damage. All organisms are continuously exposed to reactive oxygen species, which cause cellular damage and are thought to contribute to the aging process (7Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4450) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species damage DNA and generate numerous DNA lesions such as modified bases and sugar moieties, strand breaks, and DNA-protein cross-links (reviewed in Ref. 8Dizdaroglu M. Free Radic. Res. 1998; 29: 551-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). 8-hydroxy-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-OH-Gua) is a ubiquitous lesion in oxidatively damaged DNA that is mutagenic, causing G → T transversions in vitro and in vivo (9Le Page F.

Nevertheless, the biological consequences of 8-OH-Ade could be significant, because it is abundant in oxidatively damaged DNA (17Jaruga P. Rodriguez H. Dizdaroglu M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 8-OH-Ade is repaired in mammalian cells (18Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1389-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), but the mechanism by which it is repaired is not known (19Dizdaroglu M. Yoshikawa T. Toyokuni S. Yamamoto Y. Naito Y. Free Radicals in Chemistry, Biology and Medicine. OICA International, London2001: 58-76Google Scholar).

Pathol. 1997; 50: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the DNA repair defect in CS plays an important role in the course and symptoms of this disorder. Whole cell extracts (WCEs) from primary CS-B cells incise 8-OH-Gua at a lower rate than normal cell lines, and this deficiency is complemented by transfection of the cells with wild type CSB (21Dianov G. Bischoff C. Sunesen M. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1365-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, CS-B-null cells and CS-B motif V/VI mutants are more sensitive to γ-radiation than wild type cells (22Tuo J. Muftuoglu M. Chen C. Jaruga P. Selzer R.R. Brosh Jr., R.M. Rodriguez H.

WCEs from transfected CS-B-null cells and motif V/VI mutants also incise 8-OH-Gua-containing oligonucleotides less efficiently than wild type cells.

In this study, we investigated the role of CSBin cellular repair of 8-OH-Ade. CSB mutants were expressed in CS-B-null cells and in vitro incision of 8-OH-Ade was analyzed using WCEs from these cell lines. In addition, the nucleoside form of 8-OH-Ade, 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyadenosine (8-OH-dAdo) was measured in genomic DNA of these cells by means of a recently developed assay that uses liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) with the isotope dilution technique (17Jaruga P.

CS1AN.S3.G2 was transfected with pcDNA3.1 carrying the wild type CSB, mutant CSB altered in the putative helicase motif VI (Q942E and R946A) or the vector pcDNA3.1 (pc3.1) (Invitrogen) (Fig. 2). The reason we applied Q942E and R946A is that these cell lines are the most deficient ones in repair of 8-OH-Gua among the 8 stably transfected cell lines established in this laboratory with site-directed mutation(s), which are distributed in various motifs of the helicase domain (22Tuo J.

The sequences of the oligonucleotide used in the incision assay are listed in Table I. The oligonucleotide with the lesion was 32P-5′-end-labeled and annealed with a complementary strand containing a T opposite 8-OH-Ade.

Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h, terminated by the addition of 0.8 μl of 10% SDS and 0.8 μl of 5 mg/ml proteinase K, and incubated for 10 min at 55 °C. DNA was precipitated with 2 μl of 5 mg/ml glycogen (Ambion), 4 μl of 11m ammonium acetate, and 70 μl of cold ethanol overnight at −20 °C. Samples were centrifuged for 1 h at 4 °C, washed with 200 μl of 70% ethanol, and collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was dried in a speed-vacuum and resuspended in 10 μl of formamide-loading dye (5% EDTA, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 0.02% xylene cyanol in 95% formamide). Samples were separated on a denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel (containing 7 m urea, 89 mm Tris borate, pH 8.0, and 2 mm EDTA). The reaction products were visualized by autoradiography and quantified on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Oligonucleotides containing a single uracil or 5-hydroxycytosine, which were known to have no differences in incision activity of our CS-B wild type, null, or mutant cell lines, were used as the WCE control (22Tuo J.

Open table in a new tab The measurement of 8-OH-dAdo in enzymic hydrolysates of DNA samples was performed by liquid chromatography/isotope-dilution mass spectrometry (LC/IDMS) as previously described except for the stable isotope-labeled internal standard, which was used for quantification by IDMS (17Jaruga P. Rodriguez H. Dizdaroglu M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the present work, a stable isotope-labeled analog of 8-OH-dAdo was prepared and isolated in pure form. Commercially available [15N5]dATP (Medical Isotopes, Inc. Pelham, NH) was used as the starting material. An aqueous solution of [15N5]dATP (5 mg/100 ml) was bubbled with N2O and exposed to ionizing radiation in a60Co γ-source at a dose of 400 Gy (30 Gy/min). This treatment was expected to produce 8-OH-[15N5]dATP from [15N5]dATP among other products, because it is well known that the exposure of aqueous solutions of dAdo to ionizing radiation generates 8-OH-dAdo (reviewed in Refs. 28Breen A.P. Murphy J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 1033-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar and 29Dizdaroglu M. Mutat. Res. 1992; 275: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). 8-OH-[15N5]dATP was dephosphorylated to 8-OH-[15N5]dAdo as follows: an aliquot of 100 ml of the irradiated solution of [15N5]dATP was lyophilized to dryness, dissolved in 1 ml of 10 mmphosphate buffer (pH 8.0), and incubated with alkaline phosphatase (5 units) at 37 °C for 24 h. The sample was filtered by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 30 min through an ultrafiltration membrane with a molecular mass cutoff of 5 kDa (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). An aliquot (5 μl) of the filtered sample was analyzed by LC/MS and found to contain 8-OH-[15N5]dAdo on the basis of the previously reported LC/MS analysis of 8-OH-Ado (17Jaruga P. Rodriguez H. Dizdaroglu M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Semipreparative LC was used to isolate 8-OH-[15N5]dAdo from an irradiated and dephosphorylated sample of [15N5]dATP using a Supelcosil LC-8 DB reversed-phase column (25 × 1 cm inner diameter, 5-μm particle size) (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA). The solvents and the elution gradient were as previously described (17Jaruga P. Rodriguez H. Dizdaroglu M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), except that a flow rate of 2 ml/min was used. The column was kept at room temperature. Under the experimental conditions used, 8-OH-[15N5]dAdo eluting at 18.3 min was completely separated from [15N5]dAdo, which eluted at 17.3 min. This is the same elution order previously described for the unlabeled analogues of these compounds using an analytical LC column (17Jaruga P. Rodriguez H. Dizdaroglu M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The fractions corresponding to 8-OH-[15N5]dAdo were collected. At least 30 injections of 100 μl were performed. Collected fractions were combined, dried in a SpeedVac under vacuum, and then dissolved in 200 μl of water. The absorption spectrum of the solution was recorded between the wavelengths of 210 and 350 nm. The spectrum was identical to the absorption spectrum of authentic 8-OH-dAdo (30Cavalieri L.F. Bendich A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1950; 72: 2587-2594Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Analytical LC/MS was carried out to confirm the identity of 8-OH-[15N5]dAdo and its purity. The isolated compound was pure and did not contain any detectable unlabeled 8-OH-dAdo. The elution time of 8-OH-[15N5]dAdo was the same as that of 8-OH-dAdo, and its mass spectrum was similar to that of 8-OH-dAdo (17Jaruga P. Rodriguez H. Dizdaroglu M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As expected, however, the masses of the typical ions of 8-OH-[15N5]dAdo were shifted by 5 Da to greater masses, i.e. m/z 157 (the protonated base ion (BH2+)), 273 (the protonated molecular ion (MH+)), and 295 (the sodium adduct ion (MNa+)). The concentration of the solution of 8-OH-[15N5]dAdo was determined by UV spectrophotometer using the absorption coefficient of 12764m−1 cm−1 at 270 nm (30Cavalieri L.F. Bendich A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1950; 72: 2587-2594Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and by LC/MS using a 0.1 mm solution of 8-OH-dAdo as an internal standard. Both measurements yielded essentially identical results. The concentration of the solution of 8-OH-[15N5]dAdo was 0.037 ± 0.003 mm. 8-OH-dAdo was measured in DNA samples spiked with 2 pmol of 8-OH-[15N5]dAdo per 70 μg of DNA. The concentration of DNA samples was determined by UV spectrophotometry. DNA samples were hydrolyzed with nuclease P1, phosphodiesterase I, and alkaline phosphatase as described (17Jaruga P. Rodriguez H. Dizdaroglu M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and filtered by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 30 min using an ultrafiltration membrane with a molecular mass cutoff of 5 kDa. An aliquot of 20 μl of the filtered samples containing 20 μg of hydrolyzed DNA was injected on the LC column. Characteristic ions of 8-OH-dAdo atm/z 152 (BH2+), 268 (MH+), and 290 (MNa+), and those of 8-OH-[15N5]dAdo atm/z 157 (BH2+), 273 (MH+), and 295 (MNa+) were recorded during LC/MS analysis using the selected-ion monitoring (SIM) mode at the retention time period, when these compounds eluted. Groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance tests. Duncan′s multiple range test was used for post-hoc comparison of means. Differences were considered significant whenp < 0.05. In this study, we investigated the possibility that CSB is involved in cellular repair of 8-OH-Ade, a major lesion in oxidatively damaged DNA. 8-OH-Ade repair was assessed and compared in wild type, CS-B-null, and putative CS-B helicase motif VI mutant cells. Glycosylase/apurinic lyase activity in CS-B cell lines was quantified by measuring incision of an oligonucleotide with a single 8-OH-Ade residue. Fig. 3A shows the incision activity of wild type, CS-B-null, and two CS-B mutant cell lines, and the results are summarized in Fig. 3B. Fig.4, A and B show similar results, the only difference being that we used the substrate with C opposite the 8-OH-Ade lesion to possibly generate maximal nick-forming activity (25Girard P.M. D'Ham C. Cadet J. Boiteux S. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 1299-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 26Zharkov D.O. Rosenquist T.A. Gerchman S.E. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28607-28617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). CS-B-null and mutant cell lines incise 8-OH-Ade less efficiently than wild type cells in both situations. The activity of CS-B-null cells was ∼3-fold lower than wild type cells (p < 0.05), and the activity of motif VI mutants (CSBQ942E and CSBR946A) was ∼2-fold lower than wild type cells (p < 0.05). There were no differences in uracil or 5-hydroxycytocine incision of WCE of the tested cell lines (data not shown) (22Tuo J. Muftuoglu M. Chen C. Jaruga P. Selzer R.R. Brosh Jr., R.M. Rodriguez H.

Rodriguez H. Dizdaroglu M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). DNA samples isolated from cells were hydrolyzed to nucleosides by endo- and exonucleases. Prior to hydrolysis, an aliquot of 8-OH-[15N5]dAdo was added as internal standard to the DNA samples. LC/IDMS was carried out in SIM mode to monitor the characteristic ions of 8-OH-dAdo and 8-OH-[15N5]dAdo at the appropriate retention time period, when these compounds eluted. The BH2+, MH+, and MNa+ ions of both compounds were simultaneously recorded. As expected, no difference between the retention times of these analogues was observed. Fig. 5 shows the ion-current profiles at m/z 152 (BH2+) and m/z 290 (MNa+) of 8-OH-dAdo and at m/z 157 (BH2+) and m/z 295 (MNa+) of 8-OH-[15N5]dAdo, recorded during the LC/IDMS-SIM analysis of the enzymic hydrolysate of a DNA sample isolated from CSBQ942E cells following γ-radiation at 2 Gy. The results showed unequivocal identification of 8-OH-dAdo in DNA from all cell lines used in this study. The quantification was achieved by the integration of the signals of the monitored ions such as those in Fig. 5 and the calculation of the level of 8-OH-dAdo on the basis of the known amount of 8-OH-[15N5]dAdo added to the DNA samples as an internal standard prior to enzymic hydrolysis. Fig. 6 shows the level of 8-OH-dAdo in cells following exposure to ionizing radiation. Cells were irradiated and allowed 30 min to recover and repair radiation-induced DNA damage. The level of 8-OH-dAdo was similar (∼0.7 molecules/106DNA nucleosides) in genomic DNA of non-irradiated cells regardless of genotype. No change in the 8-OH-dAdo level was observed in γ-irradiated wild type cells, indicating complete and rapid repair of this lesion. The time of complete repair within 30 min is in agreement with the recently reported repair kinetics of 8-OH-Ade in human cells (18Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1389-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In contrast, significantly greater levels of 8-OH-dAdo were observed in γ-irradiated CS-B-null and motif VI mutant cells. In motif VI mutants, exposure to γ-radiation at 5 Gy followed by a 30-min incubation resulted in a higher level of 8-OH-dAdo than exposure to γ-radiation at 2 Gy. These results demonstrate that 8-OH-dAdo accumulates in a dose-dependent manner in irradiated mutant cells but does not accumulate in irradiated wild type cells. Previous studies have shown that mutations in CSB cause a deficiency in cellular repair of 8-OH-Gua (22Tuo J. Muftuoglu M. Chen C. Jaruga P. Selzer R.R. Brosh Jr., R.M. Rodriguez H. Dizdaroglu M. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45772-45779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The present study shows that CS-B-null and motif VI mutant cells are also deficient in incision of 8-OH-Ade. Consistent with this observation, 8-OH-Ade accumulates more in genomic DNA of CS-B-null and motif VI mutant cells than in wild type cells following exposure of cells to γ-radiation at low doses. These results suggest that CS-B-null and motif VI mutant cells are deficient in cellular repair of 8-OH-Ade. This in turn indicates that CSB plays an important role in cellular repair of 8-OH-Ade and that the putative helicase motif VI of CSB is important for this DNA repair function. CSB is highly homologous to proteins of the SWI/SNF2 family (2Troelstra C. Odijk H. de Wit J. Westerveld A. Thompson L.H. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Mol. Cell.

SWI/SNF proteins participate in a wide variety of cellular functions including DNA repair, regulation of transcription, maintenance of chromosome stability, and chromatin remodeling (5Balajee A.S.

Cell. 1997; 88: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). SWI/SNF2 proteins contain seven highly conserved motifs for DNA or RNA helicase activity (2Troelstra C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar), but so far, none has been shown to have this function. Previous experiments were carried out to characterize the cellular response of various CS-B mutant cell lines to different challenges (Table II) (22Tuo J. Muftuoglu M. Chen C. Jaruga P. Selzer R.R.

We have also mapped the CSB putative helicase motifs and determined their role in cellular repair of 8-OH-Gua (Table II). Those experiments showed that motifs V and VI are essential for the cellular response to oxidative stress and for cellular repair of 8-OH-Gua in genomic DNA.

Open table in a new tab It is not clear what mechanism underlies the role of CSB in the repair of 8-OH-Gua and 8-OH-Ade. The enzymes involved specifically in repair of 8-OH-Ade have not yet been identified (reviewed in Ref. 19Dizdaroglu M. Yoshikawa T. Toyokuni S. Yamamoto Y. Naito Y. Free Radicals in Chemistry, Biology and Medicine. OICA International, London2001: 58-76Google Scholar), but some evidence suggests that repair of 8-OH-Ade is mechanistically different from repair of 8-OH-Gua. Among the bacterial and mammalian DNA glycosylases, which were investigated for their activity on lesions in oxidatively damaged DNA, only Escherichia coliformamidopyrimidine glycosylase (Fpg) exhibited a low activity on 8-OH-Ade in DNA containing multiple modified bases (35Boiteux S. Gajewski E. Laval J. Dizdaroglu M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 36Karakaya A. Jaruga P. Bohr V.A. Grollman A.P. Dizdaroglu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, this activity was insignificant when compared with the activity of Fpg on 8-OH-Gua, 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyGua), and 4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyAde), which are the principal substrates of Fpg. The inactivity of Fpg was suggested to result from the absence of a C6-keto group in 8-OH-Ade (37Tchou J. Bodepudi V. Shibutani S. Antoshechkin I. Miller J. Grollman A.P. Johnson F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15318-15324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study on the cellular repair of modified DNA bases showed that 8-OH-Ade is efficiently repaired in human cells with kinetics similar to the repair kinetics of pyrimidine-derived lesions rather than to that of purine-derived lesions (18Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1389-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). This suggests that human cells possess enzyme(s) to repair 8-OH-Ade. However, it is not known whether this repair activity involves BER or NER, or both. A yeast functional homolog of E. coli Fpg encoded by the OGG1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yOgg1) was shown to excise 8-OH-Gua and FapyGua, but not FapyAde or 8-OH-Ade (38Karahalil B. Girard P.M. Boiteux S. Dizdaroglu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1228-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 39van der Kemp P.A. Thomas D. Barbey R., De Oliveira R. Boiteux S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5197-5202Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Human homologues of yOgg1 were recently isolated (reviewed in Ref. 40Boiteux S. Radicella J.P. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Two polymorphic forms of hOgg1 namely α-hOgg1-Ser326 and α-hOgg1-Cys326 are produced in human cells. Similar to yOgg1, both enzymes were reported to efficiently excise 8-OH-Gua and FapyGua, but not FapyAde or 8-OH-Ade from DNA with multiple lesions (41Dherin C. Radicella J.P. Dizdaroglu M. Boiteux S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4001-4007Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Two enzymes from Drosophila melanogaster also exhibited similar activities that efficiently excised 8-OH-Gua and FapyGua from DNA, but not FapyAde and 8-OH-Ade (42Deutsch W.A. Yacoub A. Jaruga P. Zastawny T.H. Dizdaroglu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32857-32860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 43Dherin C. Dizdaroglu M. Doerflinger H. Boiteux S. Radicella J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4583-4592Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the same context, it should be pointed out, that although 8-OH-Ade was repaired in human cells with kinetics similar to repair kinetics of pyrimidine-derived lesions, none of the known pyrimidine lesion-specific DNA glycosylases removed 8-OH-Ade from DNA either (reviewed in Ref. 19Dizdaroglu M. Yoshikawa T. Toyokuni S. Yamamoto Y. Naito Y. Free Radicals in Chemistry, Biology and Medicine. OICA International, London2001: 58-76Google Scholar). These studies clearly show that there is a paucity of knowledge about enzymes that repair 8-OH-Ade in cells orin vitro. On the other hand, our results confirm results from the previous study on the cellular repair of 8-OH-Ade in terms of the ability of human cells to repair this lesion and in terms of its repair kinetics (18Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1389-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). By studying the biochemical contribution and expression regulation of CSB to cellular repair of 8-OH-Gua, we found that CSB itself participates in the catalytic process of 8-OH-Gua incision in vitro, and CSB facilitates the expression of hOgg1. 2J. Tuo, C. Chen, X. Zeng, M. Christiansen, and V. A. Bohr, unpublished data.Further research is necessary to understand the mechanism by which CSB facilitates cellular repair of 8-OH-Ade and to identify other proteins that might contribute directly or indirectly to cellular repair of this lesion. 8-OH-Ade was identified as its nucleoside form 8-OH-dAdo, and its level and accumulation in genomic DNA of CS-B mutant cells was quantified by means of a recently developed methodology using LC/IDMS (44Jaiswal M. LaRusso N.F. Nishioka N. Nakabeppu Y. Gores G.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6388-6393PubMed Google Scholar). The present study is the first application of this technique to the measurement of the formation and repair of 8-OH-dAdo in living cells. The specificity and sensitivity of LC/IDMS in the SIM mode permitted us to detect and quantify 8-OH-dAdo at a level of ∼7 molecules/107 DNA nucleosides. Such a level of detection by LC/IDMS-SIM had previously been reported (44Jaiswal M. LaRusso N.F. Nishioka N. Nakabeppu Y. Gores G.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6388-6393PubMed Google Scholar). For quantification, we isolated a stable isotope-labeled analog of 8-OH-dAdo in pure form for the first time and used it as the internal standard. It should be pointed out that the use of liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) has also been reported for the identification of 8-OH-dAdo (45Frelon S. Douki T. Ravanat J.L.

However, the isotope-dilution technique has been applied for quantification in two instances only (45Frelon S. Douki T. Ravanat J.L. Pouget J.P. Tornabene C. Cadet J. Chem Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 1002-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 48Weimann A. Belling D. Poulsen H.E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The sensitivity level for 8-OH-dAdo of this technique in the multiple reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode is similar to that of LC/IDMS-SIM (17Jaruga P. Rodriguez H. Dizdaroglu M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the application of LC/MS/MS-MRM to the measurement of 8-OH-dAdo in living cells has not been reported. In conclusion, the present study suggests that CSB plays a role in the cellular repair of 8-OH-Ade and that the putative helicase motif VI of CSB may be important in this process. In addition, 8-OH-Ade and other lesions such as 8-OH-Gua might accumulate in the DNA of CS patients and could potentially contribute to pathology associated with CS. We thank Dr. C.

The composite biophysical behavior of heteromeric kainate receptors is determined by intersubunit interactions whose nature is unclear. Here we use dysiherbaine, a selective kainate receptor agonist, to show that GluR5 subunits assembled in heteromeric GluR5/KA-2 kainate receptor complexes can gate current without concomitant activation of their partner KA-2 subunits. A long-lasting interaction between dysiherbaine and GluR5 subunits elicits a tonic current from GluR5/KA-2 receptors; subsequent cooperative gating of KA-2 subunits can be elicited by both agonists, such as glutamate, and some classically defined antagonists, such as CNQX. This study demonstrates that each type of subunit within a heteromeric kainate receptor contributes a distinct conductance upon activation by agonist binding, and therefore provides insight into the biophysical function of ionotropic glutamate receptors."

Here we report the characterization of the siderophore transporter CaArn1p in the fungal pathogenCandida albicans. Deletion of CaARN1 reduced the ability of C. albicans to use iron bound to the hydroxamate-type siderophore ferrichrome and abolished it when two high-affinity iron permease genes (CaFTR1 and CaFTR2) were also deleted, indicating a role of CaArn1p as well as the permeases in ferrichrome-iron uptake.

Green fluorescent protein-tagged CaArn1p was observed predominantly in the plasma membrane, with some in the cytoplasm as distinct spots.

Kaplan J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As a general antimicrobial defense mechanism, mammals possess a sophisticated iron-withholding system consisting of high-affinity iron-binding proteins in body fluids, iron uptake proteins on the cell surface, and iron storage proteins inside the cells (1Askwith C.C. de Silva D. Kaplan J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 2de Silva D.M. Askwith C.C. Kaplan J. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This system effectively maintains the free iron concentration in body fluid at an extremely low level insufficient for microbial growth. However, microbial pathogens have collectively evolved a diverse repertoire of highly effective iron acquisition mechanisms, some of which appear to be specifically “designed” to defeat the iron-withholding system or to target iron-rich niches of the host (3Weinberg E.D. Physiol. Rev. 1984; 64: 65-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 4Ratledge C. Dover L.G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 881-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar, 5Howard D.H.

For example, pathogenic Neisseria species have surface receptors specific for the host extracellular iron-binding proteins transferrin and lactoferrin, turning the two major components of the host iron-withholding system into their iron sources (7Schryvers A.B. Stojiljkovic I. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1117-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 8Lewis L.A. Gray E. Wang Y.P. Roe B.A. Dyer D.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Candida albicans possesses mechanisms for attracting and lysing erythrocytes and utilizing the iron in hemoglobin (9Manns J.M. Mosser D.M. Buckley H.R. Infect.

These iron acquisition schemes constitute important virulence factors. A more commonly used strategy for microorganisms to acquire iron is the secretion of high-affinity iron chelators called siderophores (11Wooldridge K.G. Williams P.H. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 12: 325-348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Stintzi A. Barnes C., Xu, J. Raymond K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Jacobi C.A. Heesemann J. Microbiology (Read.). 2001; 147: 1115-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Siderophores are able to extract iron from host iron-binding proteins, and the siderophore-iron complexes are then assimilated by the pathogens via specific receptors and transporters. Some microorganisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and pathogenicNeisseria species do not produce their own siderophores, but are able to use the ones secreted by other organisms (7Schryvers A.B. Stojiljkovic I. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1117-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 16Yun C.W. Ferea T. Rashford J. Ardon O. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Kaplan J. Philpott C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10709-10715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).C. albicans is currently the most prevalent human fungal pathogen, causing infections in immunocompromised hosts (17Girishkumar H. Yousuf A.M. Chivate J. Geisler E. Postgrad. Med. J. 1999; 75: 151-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In some patients, C. albicans cells enter the blood stream, establishing fatal systemic infection. How does C. albicansacquire iron for growth in the iron-restricted blood stream and internal organs? We have previously shown that the high-affinity iron permease CaFtr1p is indispensable for C. albicans to establish systemic infection in mice (18Ramanan N. Wang Y. Science. 2000; 288: 1062-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). However, there is no evidence that CaFtr1p or its interacting partner oxidase, CaFet3p, can withdraw iron directly from iron-binding proteins of the host. According to studies of iron uptake mechanisms in S. cerevisiae and other organisms, there are at least two possible ways by which C. albicans may dissociate iron from the iron-binding proteins. First, C. albicans produces extracellular ferric reductases, which may convert the bound ferric iron to unbound ferrous iron. The free ferrous iron is then transported into the cells by the high-affinity iron uptake system (1Askwith C.C. de Silva D. Kaplan J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 19Askwith C. Kaplan J. Trends Biochem.

Microbiology (Read.). 2001; 147: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Second, C. albicans may produce siderophores, which directly extract the bound ferric iron. Genes encoding ferric reductases have been cloned from C. albicans (22Hammacott J.E. Williams P.H. Cashmore A.M. Microbiology (Read.). 2000; 146: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and there have been several reports on possible siderophore production by C. albicans (23Minnick A.A.

Either the siderophore-bound iron may be released by the ferric reductases and then picked up by the high-affinity uptake system (18Ramanan N. Wang Y. Science. 2000; 288: 1062-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 26Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S., Li, L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J.

Yeast. 2002; 19: 329-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), or the siderophore-iron complex is transported into the cell via receptor-mediated mechanisms (28Lesuisse E. Knight S.A. Camadro J.M. Dancis A. Yeast. 2002; 19: 329-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Ardon O. Bussey H. Philpott C. Ward D.M. Davis-Kaplan S. Verroneau S. Jiang B. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43049-43055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the siderophore-mediated iron binding may function upstream of and provide free iron to the oxidase-permease iron uptake system. It has been reported that disruption oftonB in Bordetella bronchiseptica and Bordetella pertussis prevents utilization of ferric siderophores, hemin, and hemoglobin as iron sources (30Nicholson M.L. Beall B. Microbiology (Read.). 1999; 145: 2453-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the siderophore uptake mechanism is related to the use of hemoglobin iron by C. albicans.Four siderophore transporters (Arn1p, Arn2p/Taf1p, Arn3p/Sit1p, and Arn4p/Enb1p) have been reported in S. cerevisiae, collectively responsible for the uptake of a range of siderophores of different structures and chemical properties (16Yun C.W.

These proteins belong to the major facilitator superfamily, whose members have been found in many organisms. Currently, one siderophore transporter gene (CaARN1) has been found in C. albicans, and its function has been investigated by heterologous expression in S. cerevisiae (28Lesuisse E. Knight S.A. Camadro J.M. Dancis A. Yeast. 2002; 19: 329-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Ardon O. Bussey H. Philpott C. Ward D.M. Davis-Kaplan S. Verroneau S. Jiang B. Kaplan J. J. Biol.

Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43049-43055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) reported that CaArn1p expressed in S. cerevisiae specifically mediates the uptake of FC1-iron, but does not transport iron bound to FOB. This result seems to contradict the report by Lesuisse et al. (28Lesuisse E. Knight S.A. Camadro J.M. Dancis A. Yeast. 2002; 19: 329-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), who observed intracellular accumulation of fluorescent analogs of both FC and FOB in C. albicans.In this study, we constructed C. albicans mutants with deletions of either CaARN1 alone or together with the high-affinity iron permease genes and compared them for iron uptake from different siderophores. We also investigated the cellular localization of CaArn1p, identified transcription regulators ofCaARN1 expression, and examined the virulence of theCaARN1 deletion mutant using a mouse model for systemic candidiasis.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we investigated the properties and functions of the siderophore transporter CaArn1p in C. albicans. CaARN1 has been characterized in the heterologous hostS. cerevisiae (28Lesuisse E. Knight S.A. Camadro J.M. Dancis A. Yeast. 2002; 19: 329-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Ardon O.

Chem. 2001; 276: 43049-43055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), which provided very useful information for the design of our experiments to study the gene in its native host. Our study confirmed some previous results, such as the role of CaArn1p in siderophore uptake, its FC specificity, and iron-regulated expression of the gene. In addition, we made some new observations that may shed light on the understanding of CaArn1p function and roles in C. albicans virulence.Comparison of siderophore-iron uptake in mutants with deletions ofCaARN1 alone and of both the CaARN1 and CaFTR genes showed that siderophore-iron can be used via both the siderophore transporter and the oxidase-permease iron uptake system. The oxidase-permease system can assimilate iron from both FC and FOB. This route of uptake would require the function of ferric reductases to release iron in ferrous form from the siderophores. The role of ferric reductases in the utilization of siderophore-iron by the oxidase-permease system has been well documented (16Yun C.W. Ferea T. Rashford J. Ardon O. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Kaplan J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 16354-16359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Our results support the conclusions that siderophore-iron uptake occurs through both reductive and non-reductive pathways in yeast. In agreement with the FC specificity of CaArn1p reported by Ardon et al. (29Ardon O. Bussey H. Philpott C. Ward D.M. Davis-Kaplan S. Verroneau S. Jiang B. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43049-43055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we also observed that CaArn1p transported FC-bound iron, but had undetectable activity for FOB-bound iron. However, these observations do not agree with the intracellular accumulation of a fluorescent FOB analog reported by Lesuisse et al. (28Lesuisse E. Knight S.A. Camadro J.M. Dancis A. Yeast. 2002; 19: 329-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). One explanation could be that the intracellular fluorescence was due to the slow entry of the compound via liquid-phase endocytosis over the 24-h growth of cells before fluorescence microscopy. This slow entry of FOB would not be detected as significant by the 15–30-min 59Fe uptake assay used by us and by Ardonet al. (29Ardon O. Bussey H. Philpott C. Ward D.M. Davis-Kaplan S. Verroneau S. Jiang B. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43049-43055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Using GFP tagging, we were able to determine CaArn1p localization in living cells. Because the tagged protein could fully correct the defect of Caarn1Δ in using FC-iron, the observed GFP fluorescence pattern should reflect the physiological cellular localization of CaArn1p. In living C. albicans cells, the majority of CaArn1p-GFP was found in the plasma membrane, and a small amount was found in the cytoplasm with a punctate appearance. This localization is apparently different from the predominant localization of Arn1p and Arn3p in intracellular vesicles in S. cerevisiae previously observed by others (16Yun C.W. Ferea T. Rashford J. Ardon O. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Kaplan J. Philpott C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10709-10715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 47Yun C.W. Tiedeman J.S. Moore R.E. Philpott C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16354-16359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, these authors did not exclude the possibility that a small amount of Arn1p and Arn3p could also be localized on the plasma membrane. Although we have not determined the nature of the intracellular vesicles containing CaArn1p in C. albicans, we assume that they are likely to be the same as those containing Arn1p and Arn3p in S. cerevisiae. The two different observations do not necessarily contradict each other. These proteins may be localized in both the plasma membrane and intracellular vesicles in a dynamic equilibrium, which is shifted toward different ends in the two organisms to suit each one's specific need for siderophore-iron in their respective natural environmental niches. These two organisms are well known to differ in the number ofARN genes, specificity for siderophores, and ability in siderophore production. A similar situation is the ability of C. albicans (but not S. cerevisiae) to shift a dynamic cell cycle-dependent distribution of a pool of actin toward a persistent localization at the hyphal tips when cells switch growth from the yeast form to the filamentous form (48Hazan I. Sepulveda-Becerra M. Liu H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Then, what is the relationship between the CaArn1p molecules in the two locations? One possibility is that CaArn1p in the intracellular vesicles may come from the internalization of the ones in the plasma membrane. This internalization might be a result of CaArn1p-mediated transport of siderophore-iron complexes into the cells, a mechanism similar to the receptor-mediated cellular uptake of transferrin-iron complexes in mammals (1Askwith C.C. de Silva D. Kaplan J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Supporting this explanation, we observed an increase in the number of fluorescent spots in cells treated with FC in a concentration-dependent manner, but not in cells treated with FOB or Fe. However, it is equally possible that the receptors are internalized alone as a mechanism to down-regulate CaArn1p levels on the cell surface after translocating iron across the plasma membrane. At this stage, we are unable to distinguish between these two possibilities. Other researchers have also suggested that Arn3p/Sit1p is likely to act as a transporter at the cell surface and be rapidly recycled by internalization (20Knight S.A. Lesuisse E. Stearman R. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Microbiology (Read.). 2002; 148: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 34Lesuisse E. Simon-Casteras M. Labbe P. Microbiology (Read.). 1998; 144: 3455-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These authors mentioned that a mutant completely defective for endocytosis showed normal siderophore uptake, a result strongly challenging the hypothesis of Arnp-mediated internalization as the mechanism for FC uptake. However, the role of endocytosis in FC utilization needs to be tested in C. albicans. Although the mechanism of Arnp-mediated siderophore uptake is still not clear, our observation of a prominent cell-surface localization of CaArn1p strongly suggests that the main site of function for this protein is at the plasma membrane inC. albicans, where it is likely to play a direct role in binding and transporting siderophore-iron. The observation of an FC-induced increase in the intracellular localization of CaArn1p suggests testable hypotheses for the mechanisms of siderophore-iron transport and recycling of the transporter.The expression of many genes involved in iron uptake is regulated by iron concentration in both S. cerevisiae and C. albicans (16Yun C.W.

Chem. 2001; 276: 34221-34226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, an AFT homolog does not seem to be present in C. albicans. Currently, it is not clear whether there is any transcription factor in C. albicansthat activates transcription in an iron-dependent manner. Recently, evidence, including this study, is accumulating that the global transcription repressor Tup1p is responsible for the repression of at least some iron uptake-related genes in both S. cerevisiae and C. albicans (20Knight S.A. Lesuisse E. Stearman R. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Microbiology (Read.). 2002; 148: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 21Lesuisse E. Blaiseau P.L. Dancis A. Camadro J.M.

Tup1p associates with Ssn6p to form a general transcription repressor. However, this complex requires additional DNA-binding subunits for its specificity for different promoters (42Braun B.R. Johnson A.D. Science. 1997; 277: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 43Braun B.R. Head W.S. Wang M.X. Johnson A.D. Genetics. 2000; 156: 31-44PubMed Google Scholar, 44Braun B.R. Kadosh D. Johnson A.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4753-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In C. albicans, two DNA-binding proteins, CaNrg1p and Rfg1p, have been found to mediate CaTup1p repression of target genes (43Braun B.R. Head W.S. Wang M.X. Johnson A.D. Genetics. 2000; 156: 31-44PubMed Google Scholar, 44Braun B.R. Kadosh D. Johnson A.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4753-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 45Kadosh D. Johnson A.D. Mol. Cell.

Therefore, we examined CaARN1 expression in bothCanrg1Δ and rfg1Δ mutants to ascertain which one mediates CaTup1p function. We discovered that deletion ofCaNRG1 had no discernible effect on the iron-responsive regulation of CaARN1, whereas deletion of RFG1resulted in loss of repression under iron-replete conditions to the same extent as deletion of CaTUP1. These results indicate that CaTup1p repression of CaARN1 is primarily, if not entirely, mediated by Rfg1p. Because CaNrg1p mediates the repression ofCaFTR1 and CaCFL2 in C. albicans (40Murad A.M. Leng P. Straffon M. Wishart J. Macaskill S. MacCallum D. Schnell N. Talibi D. Marechal D. Tekaia F. d'Enfert C. Gaillardin C. Odds F.C. Brown A.J.

Microbiol. 2001; 42: 981-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), it would be interesting to know why the repression of genes for different iron uptake systems are mediated by different DNA-binding proteins.To determine whether CaARN1 is required for C. albicans virulence, we tested the ability of the Ura+Caarn1Δ mutant in causing death in mice via intravenous injection. The mutant exhibited a similar level of virulence as its isogenic wild-type strain, suggesting that CaArn1p function is not critically required for iron acquisition during this route of infection. This result indirectly supports our previous report of the essentiality of the oxidase-permease iron uptake system (18Ramanan N. Wang Y. Science. 2000; 288: 1062-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), the only other alternative high-affinity iron uptake system known so far inC. albicans. Although the systemic candidiasis model is useful in testing factors important for the pathogen to grow or survive in the bloodstream and internal organs, it does not necessarily reflect the entire natural route of infection. C. albicans mainly colonizes the mucosal surfaces along the gastrointestinal and vaginal tracts. The pathogen is exposed to various environmental niches with limited iron supply and is in contact with different resident microbial communities. CaArn1p function may be required for iron uptake in these niches. The use of different infection models is required to unveil the role of siderophore-iron uptake in C. albicansinfection. Iron is an essential nutrient for nearly all organisms because it serves as an obligate component of many indispensable enzymes and other proteins (1Askwith C.C. de Silva D. Kaplan J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As a general antimicrobial defense mechanism, mammals possess a sophisticated iron-withholding system consisting of high-affinity iron-binding proteins in body fluids, iron uptake proteins on the cell surface, and iron storage proteins inside the cells (1Askwith C.C. de Silva D. Kaplan J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 2de Silva D.M. Askwith C.C. Kaplan J. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This system effectively maintains the free iron concentration in body fluid at an extremely low level insufficient for microbial growth. However, microbial pathogens have collectively evolved a diverse repertoire of highly effective iron acquisition mechanisms, some of which appear to be specifically “designed” to defeat the iron-withholding system or to target iron-rich niches of the host (3Weinberg E.D. Physiol. Rev. 1984; 64: 65-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 4Ratledge C. Dover L.G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 881-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar, 5Howard D.H.

For example, pathogenic Neisseria species have surface receptors specific for the host extracellular iron-binding proteins transferrin and lactoferrin, turning the two major components of the host iron-withholding system into their iron sources (7Schryvers A.B.

Previously we found that combining touch on one hand with visual stimulation in the anatomically corresponding hemifield could boost responses in contralateral visual cortex. Here we manipulated which visual hemifield corresponded to the location of the stimulated hand, by changing gaze direction such that right-hand touch could now arise in either the left or right visual field. Crossmodal effects on visual cortex switched from one hemisphere to the other, depending on gaze direction, regardless of whether the hand was seen.

Numerous biological functions have been attributed to the activity of the hormone ranging from reproduction, metabolism, and immune regulation (1Bole-Feysot C. Goffin V. Edery M. Binart N. Kelly P.A. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 225-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar). Prolactin is a primary factor required for the growth and terminal differentiation of mammary epithelial cells as determined by the induction of transcription of various milk protein genes such as β-casein, β-lactoglobulin, and whey acidic protein (2Rosen J.M. Wyszomierski S.L. Hadsell D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 407-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).The molecular mechanisms by which PRL induces milk protein gene transcription have been the subject of intensive research. Interaction of PRL with its receptor, the PRLR, a member of the class I cytokine receptor superfamily, induces receptor dimerization leading to activation of a member of the Janus cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase family, Jak2, and members of the Src-like kinase family necessary for signal generation (3Lebrun J.J.

Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 674-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extensive in vitro as well as gene knock out studies revealed that PRL utilizes the Jak2/Stat5 pathway to induce milk protein gene transcription (5Schmitt-Ney M. Doppler W. Ball R.K. Groner B. Mol.

The mechanisms by which Stat molecules are regulated have increasingly become more intricate with the discovery that Stat proteins interact with various cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins that may regulate Stat-mediated gene transcription. For example Stat5 has been shown to interact with steroid receptors, the glucocorticoid receptor (8Wyszomierski S.L. Yeh J. Rosen J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 330-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the co-activator CBP/p300 (9Pfitzner E. Jahne R. Wissler M. Stoecklin E. Groner B. Mol.

It is still unclear how these interactions contribute to Stat5 activation of PRL target genes.Another important mediator of PRL signaling to milk protein gene activation is the cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. SHP-2 is a ubiquitously expressed phosphatase containing two amino-terminal SH2 domains and a carboxyl-terminal phosphatase domain (13Freeman Jr., R.M. Plutzky J. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

A variety of studies indicate that SHP-2 interacts with an assortment of molecules that are involved in signal transduction pathways downstream of different growth factor receptors and cytokine receptors such as members of the insulin receptor substrate family of proteins (16Myers Jr., M.G.

Pratt J.C. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Mol.

SHP-2 is known to exert a positive effect in mediating the activation of the Jak-Stat pathway in response to different cytokines such as PRL (21Ali S. Chen Z. Lebrun J.J. Vogel W. Kharitonenkov A. Kelly P.A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 22Berchtold S. Volarevic S. Moriggl R. Mercep M. Groner B. Mol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 2344-2354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, SHP-2 can also be implicated in the negative regulation of cytokine-mediated signaling to the Jak-Stat pathway. In terms of interleukin-6 signaling, glycoprotein 130 recruitment of SHP-2 attenuates the activity of the Jak-Stat pathway affecting the efficacy and duration of signaling to the induction of acute phase plasma proteins (25Kim H. Baumann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5326-5338Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Similarly in GH signaling mutations of the SHP-2-binding sites in the growth hormone receptor prolongs GH-promoted tyrosyl phosphorylation of the receptor, Jak2, and Stat5b (26Stofega M.R. Herrington J. Billestrup N. Carter-Su C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1338-1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We have shown previously (21Ali S. Chen Z. Lebrun J.J. Vogel W. Kharitonenkov A. Kelly P.A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) that in response to PRL, SHP-2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated, physically associates with the PRLR-Jak2 complex, and is critical for the activation of the β-casein gene promoter. Furthermore, expression of a dominant negative variant of SHP-2 whereby the phosphatase domain is deleted led to the loss of tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity of Stat5 (22Berchtold S. Volarevic S. Moriggl R. Mercep M. Groner B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 556-567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular events following SHP-2 recruitment to the PRLR-Jak2 complex and its regulation of Stat5 activation are not fully characterized. In our present study we demonstrate a PRL-dependent association of SHP-2 with Stat5 in mammary cells. In addition, we report for the first time PRL-mediated nuclear translocation of SHP-2, and we have shown that upon PRL stimulation SHP-2 and Stat5 exist in a complex on the Stat5-responsive element of the β-casein gene promoter. Furthermore, the catalytic activity of SHP-2 was found to regulate the formation of a SHP-2-Stat5 complex, tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5, and translocation of SHP-2 to the nucleus. The data together indicate that SHP-2 and Stat5 as a complex participate in PRL signal transduction in mammary cells.DISCUSSIONOver the past decade extensive studies have indicated that the Jak/Stat pathway is one of the principal signaling pathways utilized by members of the class I cytokine receptor family to transduce their signals in target tissues. Recently it became apparent, although less studied, that other pathways and effector molecules could also play an important role in regulating this signaling cascade. The ubiquitously expressed protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 has been designated both as a positive and a negative regulator of signaling downstream of different cytokine receptors. Our present study reinforces and extends the critical role of SHP-2 in PRL signaling leading to milk protein gene activation and highlights an intricate relationship between the two molecules, SHP-2 and Stat5a, required for their activation and function.The Jak2/Stat5a pathway has been shown to be central in mediating PRL signals to the activation of milk protein gene transcription. In this study we have demonstrated a novel physical association of SHP-2 with Stat5a in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of mammary cells in response to PRL stimulation. Our results indicate that the interaction of SHP-2 with Stat5a depends on an intact carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain of SHP-2 and an active catalytic domain and correlates with the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5a on the conserved tyrosine residue (Tyr-694). We have shown previously (32Ali S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39073-39080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) that the carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain of SHP-2 is required in order for SHP-2 to be recruited to the PRLR. Therefore, together the data indicate that Stat5a tyrosine phosphorylation downstream of the PRLR depends on the ability of the PRLR to recruit catalytically active SHP-2, further demonstrating the positive role of SHP-2 downstream of the PRLR leading to the activation of Stat5a. Also the data points to the fact that the formation of an SHP-2-Stat5a complex follows the classical SH2-phosphotyrosine interaction mechanism requiring Tyr- 694 of Stat5. However, in view of the fact that tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5 on other residues besides Tyr-694 has been documented (33Ariyoshi K. Nosaka T. Yamada K. Onishi M. Oka Y. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24407-24413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we therefore cannot implicate Tyr-694 specifically as the site of association.However, the biochemical parameters influencing the interaction of SHP-2 with Stat5 may vary in different cell types and/or downstream of different cytokines. For example, Yu et al. (34Yu C.L. Jin Y.J. Burakoff S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 599-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) have demonstrated previously by GST pull-down experiments that the CS mutant of SHP-2 overexpressed in COS7 cells associated with Stat5 when preincubated with the cytosol of CTLL20 cells stimulated with interleukin-2 but were unable to show an association between SHP-2 wild type and Stat5. Therefore, it is still to be determined whether the formation of a SHP-2-Stat5 complex and SHP-2 regulation of Stat5 activation is tissue-specific and/or ligand-specific. In this regard whereas SHP-2 has been implicated in negative regulation of signaling to Stat5b activation downstream of the growth hormone receptor (26Stofega M.R. Herrington J. Billestrup N. Carter-Su C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1338-1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our results indicate that in breast cancer cells, T47D cell line, GH stimulation leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5a and to SHP-2/Stat5a interaction. This effect of huGH could be due to its ability to activate its own receptor as well as the human PRLR.Subcellular compartmentalization and/or distribution of effector molecules occur in order for signaling proteins to target their substrates. We have shown here for the first time that SHP-2 undergoes subcellular relocalization in response to PRL stimulation in mammary cells. We found that in mammary cells as early as 45 min following PRL stimulation SHP-2 presents itself by localizing in the nucleus. Nuclear translocation of SHP-2 was found to correlate with the nuclear translocation of Stat5 in HC11 cells. This activity is not unique to SHP-2. Ram et al. (35Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17694-17702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) have demonstrated previously that GH induced nuclear localization of SHP-1, the mammalian homologue of SHP-2, and its association with GH activated tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat5b in liver cells. This study implicates SHP-1 in the dephosphorylation and recycling back of Stat5b to the cytoplasm (35Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17694-17702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that Ram et al. (35Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17694-17702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) were able to show that in liver cells nuclear translocation of SHP-1 does not depend on a simultaneous nuclear translocation of Stat5b. Nuclear translocation of SHP-1 may be to due to an intrinsic activity of the phosphatase because a half-bipartite KRK nuclear localization sequence within the carboxyl-terminal distal region of SHP-1 was described (36Craggs G. Kellie S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23719-23725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, no such sequence was identified on SHP-2 (36Craggs G. Kellie S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23719-23725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In fact our results indicate that SHP-2 nuclear translocation in response to PRL treatment correlates with the activation of Stat5. PRL treatment did not lead to nuclear translocation of the catalytically inactive SHP-2. This form of SHP-2 is unable to interact with Stat5. In addition, Stat5 is not tyrosine phosphorylated in this environment and therefore, is not expected to translocate to the nucleus, suggesting that Stat5 may act as a “carrier” for SHP-2 to the nucleus by providing its own nuclear translocation machinery.We have shown that SHP-2 exists in a complex with Stat5 on the GAS-responsive element on the β-casein gene promoter (Fig. 10). We speculate that an active SHP-2 and a tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat5a translocate to the nucleus and potentially function in the nucleus to regulate transcription as both SHP-2 and Stat5a as a complex binds to DNA. In the nucleus SHP-2 may potentially be involved in the transcription of Stat5-responsive genes. Targets for SHP-2 in the nucleus have not been identified until now. It is believed that the Stat dimer becomes dephosphorylated by an unidentified protein-tyrosine phosphatase to form non-phosphorylated Stat monomers in the nucleus (37Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar, 38Shuai K. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 405-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that SHP-2 is required to activate Stat5a in the cytoplasm, and we find it unlikely that it would be involved in the dephosphorylation and deactivation of Stat5a in the nucleus. Nuclear localization of protein-tyrosine phosphatases may allow them to participate in regulating the state of phosphorylation of specific molecules including those involved in the transcriptional machinery of a cell such as co-activators, co-repressors, DNA/RNA polymerases, as well as chromatin adding another level of complexity in the function of protein-tyrosine phosphatases. In summary, our study indicates that PRL treatment of mammary cells induces the cytosolic and nuclear association of SHP-2 with Stat5a. This interaction is a cardinal requirement for activation and nuclear translocation of SHP-2/Stat5a in turn determining the fate of milk protein gene transcription. PRL1 is a polypeptide hormone secreted by the pituitary gland and by multiple extra-pituitary sites. Numerous biological functions have been attributed to the activity of the hormone ranging from reproduction, metabolism, and immune regulation (1Bole-Feysot C. Goffin V. Edery M. Binart N. Kelly P.A. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 225-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar). Prolactin is a primary factor required for the growth and terminal differentiation of mammary epithelial cells as determined by the induction of transcription of various milk protein genes such as β-casein, β-lactoglobulin, and whey acidic protein (2Rosen J.M.

The molecular mechanisms by which PRL induces milk protein gene transcription have been the subject of intensive research. Interaction of PRL with its receptor, the PRLR, a member of the class I cytokine receptor superfamily, induces receptor dimerization leading to activation of a member of the Janus cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase family, Jak2, and members of the Src-like kinase family necessary for signal generation (3Lebrun J.J.

Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 674-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extensive in vitro as well as gene knock out studies revealed that PRL utilizes the Jak2/Stat5 pathway to induce milk protein gene transcription (5Schmitt-Ney M. Doppler W. Ball R.K. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3745-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 7Liu X. Robinson G.W.

It is known that Stat proteins are latent cytoplasmic transcription factors that are activated upon cytokine stimulation, heterodimerize and/or homodimerize, and translocate to the nucleus to bind to DNA elements in order to initiate the transcription of specific genes. The mechanisms by which Stat molecules are regulated have increasingly become more intricate with the discovery that Stat proteins interact with various cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins that may regulate Stat-mediated gene transcription. For example Stat5 has been shown to interact with steroid receptors, the glucocorticoid receptor (8Wyszomierski S.L. Yeh J. Rosen J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 330-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the co-activator CBP/p300 (9Pfitzner E. Jahne R. Wissler M. Stoecklin E. Groner B. Mol.

Komatsu N. Ohashi H. Miyajima A. Ikeda Y. Blood. 1998; 92: 4652-4662PubMed Google Scholar). It is still unclear how these interactions contribute to Stat5 activation of PRL target genes. Another important mediator of PRL signaling to milk protein gene activation is the cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. SHP-2 is a ubiquitously expressed phosphatase containing two amino-terminal SH2 domains and a carboxyl-terminal phosphatase domain (13Freeman Jr., R.M. Plutzky J. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11239-11243Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 14Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A.

A variety of studies indicate that SHP-2 interacts with an assortment of molecules that are involved in signal transduction pathways downstream of different growth factor receptors and cytokine receptors such as members of the insulin receptor substrate family of proteins (16Myers Jr., M.G.

Pratt J.C. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 729-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), as well as several proteins with immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs such as signal regulatory protein (18Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), protein zero related (19Zhao Z.J. Zhao R. J. Biol.

Liu L. Krystal G. Cambier J.C. Daeron M. Vivier E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1994-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Although the role of SHP-2 downstream of cytokine receptors has been investigated, the precise contribution of SHP-2 to cytokine signaling remains in large part unknown. SHP-2 is known to exert a positive effect in mediating the activation of the Jak-Stat pathway in response to different cytokines such as PRL (21Ali S. Chen Z. Lebrun J.J. Vogel W. Kharitonenkov A. Kelly P.A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 22Berchtold S. Volarevic S. Moriggl R. Mercep M. Groner B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 556-567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), interferon α/β (23David M. Zhou G. Pine R. Dixon J.E. Larner A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15862-15865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and growth hormone (GH) (24Kim S.O. Jiang J., Yi, W. Feng G.S. Frank S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2344-2354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, SHP-2 can also be implicated in the negative regulation of cytokine-mediated signaling to the Jak-Stat pathway. In terms of interleukin-6 signaling, glycoprotein 130 recruitment of SHP-2 attenuates the activity of the Jak-Stat pathway affecting the efficacy and duration of signaling to the induction of acute phase plasma proteins (25Kim H. Baumann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5326-5338Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Similarly in GH signaling mutations of the SHP-2-binding sites in the growth hormone receptor prolongs GH-promoted tyrosyl phosphorylation of the receptor, Jak2, and Stat5b (26Stofega M.R. Herrington J. Billestrup N. Carter-Su C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1338-1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown previously (21Ali S. Chen Z. Lebrun J.J. Vogel W. Kharitonenkov A. Kelly P.A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) that in response to PRL, SHP-2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated, physically associates with the PRLR-Jak2 complex, and is critical for the activation of the β-casein gene promoter. Furthermore, expression of a dominant negative variant of SHP-2 whereby the phosphatase domain is deleted led to the loss of tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity of Stat5 (22Berchtold S. Volarevic S. Moriggl R. Mercep M. Groner B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 556-567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular events following SHP-2 recruitment to the PRLR-Jak2 complex and its regulation of Stat5 activation are not fully characterized. In our present study we demonstrate a PRL-dependent association of SHP-2 with Stat5 in mammary cells. In addition, we report for the first time PRL-mediated nuclear translocation of SHP-2, and we have shown that upon PRL stimulation SHP-2 and Stat5 exist in a complex on the Stat5-responsive element of the β-casein gene promoter. Furthermore, the catalytic activity of SHP-2 was found to regulate the formation of a SHP-2-Stat5 complex, tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5, and translocation of SHP-2 to the nucleus. The data together indicate that SHP-2 and Stat5 as a complex participate in PRL signal transduction in mammary cells. DISCUSSIONOver the past decade extensive studies have indicated that the Jak/Stat pathway is one of the principal signaling pathways utilized by members of the class I cytokine receptor family to transduce their signals in target tissues. Recently it became apparent, although less studied, that other pathways and effector molecules could also play an important role in regulating this signaling cascade. The ubiquitously expressed protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 has been designated both as a positive and a negative regulator of signaling downstream of different cytokine receptors. Our present study reinforces and extends the critical role of SHP-2 in PRL signaling leading to milk protein gene activation and highlights an intricate relationship between the two molecules, SHP-2 and Stat5a, required for their activation and function.The Jak2/Stat5a pathway has been shown to be central in mediating PRL signals to the activation of milk protein gene transcription. In this study we have demonstrated a novel physical association of SHP-2 with Stat5a in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of mammary cells in response to PRL stimulation. Our results indicate that the interaction of SHP-2 with Stat5a depends on an intact carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain of SHP-2 and an active catalytic domain and correlates with the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5a on the conserved tyrosine residue (Tyr-694). We have shown previously (32Ali S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39073-39080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) that the carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain of SHP-2 is required in order for SHP-2 to be recruited to the PRLR. Therefore, together the data indicate that Stat5a tyrosine phosphorylation downstream of the PRLR depends on the ability of the PRLR to recruit catalytically active SHP-2, further demonstrating the positive role of SHP-2 downstream of the PRLR leading to the activation of Stat5a. Also the data points to the fact that the formation of an SHP-2-Stat5a complex follows the classical SH2-phosphotyrosine interaction mechanism requiring Tyr- 694 of Stat5. However, in view of the fact that tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5 on other residues besides Tyr-694 has been documented (33Ariyoshi K. Nosaka T. Yamada K. Onishi M. Oka Y. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24407-24413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we therefore cannot implicate Tyr-694 specifically as the site of association.However, the biochemical parameters influencing the interaction of SHP-2 with Stat5 may vary in different cell types and/or downstream of different cytokines. For example, Yu et al. (34Yu C.L. Jin Y.J. Burakoff S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 599-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) have demonstrated previously by GST pull-down experiments that the CS mutant of SHP-2 overexpressed in COS7 cells associated with Stat5 when preincubated with the cytosol of CTLL20 cells stimulated with interleukin-2 but were unable to show an association between SHP-2 wild type and Stat5. Therefore, it is still to be determined whether the formation of a SHP-2-Stat5 complex and SHP-2 regulation of Stat5 activation is tissue-specific and/or ligand-specific. In this regard whereas SHP-2 has been implicated in negative regulation of signaling to Stat5b activation downstream of the growth hormone receptor (26Stofega M.R. Herrington J. Billestrup N. Carter-Su C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1338-1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our results indicate that in breast cancer cells, T47D cell line, GH stimulation leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5a and to SHP-2/Stat5a interaction. This effect of huGH could be due to its ability to activate its own receptor as well as the human PRLR.Subcellular compartmentalization and/or distribution of effector molecules occur in order for signaling proteins to target their substrates. We have shown here for the first time that SHP-2 undergoes subcellular relocalization in response to PRL stimulation in mammary cells. We found that in mammary cells as early as 45 min following PRL stimulation SHP-2 presents itself by localizing in the nucleus. Nuclear translocation of SHP-2 was found to correlate with the nuclear translocation of Stat5 in HC11 cells. This activity is not unique to SHP-2. Ram et al. (35Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17694-17702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) have demonstrated previously that GH induced nuclear localization of SHP-1, the mammalian homologue of SHP-2, and its association with GH activated tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat5b in liver cells. This study implicates SHP-1 in the dephosphorylation and recycling back of Stat5b to the cytoplasm (35Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17694-17702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that Ram et al. (35Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17694-17702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) were able to show that in liver cells nuclear translocation of SHP-1 does not depend on a simultaneous nuclear translocation of Stat5b. Nuclear translocation of SHP-1 may be to due to an intrinsic activity of the phosphatase because a half-bipartite KRK nuclear localization sequence within the carboxyl-terminal distal region of SHP-1 was described (36Craggs G. Kellie S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23719-23725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, no such sequence was identified on SHP-2 (36Craggs G. Kellie S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23719-23725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In fact our results indicate that SHP-2 nuclear translocation in response to PRL treatment correlates with the activation of Stat5. PRL treatment did not lead to nuclear translocation of the catalytically inactive SHP-2. This form of SHP-2 is unable to interact with Stat5. In addition, Stat5 is not tyrosine phosphorylated in this environment and therefore, is not expected to translocate to the nucleus, suggesting that Stat5 may act as a “carrier” for SHP-2 to the nucleus by providing its own nuclear translocation machinery.We have shown that SHP-2 exists in a complex with Stat5 on the GAS-responsive element on the β-casein gene promoter (Fig. 10). We speculate that an active SHP-2 and a tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat5a translocate to the nucleus and potentially function in the nucleus to regulate transcription as both SHP-2 and Stat5a as a complex binds to DNA. In the nucleus SHP-2 may potentially be involved in the transcription of Stat5-responsive genes. Targets for SHP-2 in the nucleus have not been identified until now. It is believed that the Stat dimer becomes dephosphorylated by an unidentified protein-tyrosine phosphatase to form non-phosphorylated Stat monomers in the nucleus (37Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar, 38Shuai K. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 405-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that SHP-2 is required to activate Stat5a in the cytoplasm, and we find it unlikely that it would be involved in the dephosphorylation and deactivation of Stat5a in the nucleus. Nuclear localization of protein-tyrosine phosphatases may allow them to participate in regulating the state of phosphorylation of specific molecules including those involved in the transcriptional machinery of a cell such as co-activators, co-repressors, DNA/RNA polymerases, as well as chromatin adding another level of complexity in the function of protein-tyrosine phosphatases. In summary, our study indicates that PRL treatment of mammary cells induces the cytosolic and nuclear association of SHP-2 with Stat5a. This interaction is a cardinal requirement for activation and nuclear translocation of SHP-2/Stat5a in turn determining the fate of milk protein gene transcription. Over the past decade extensive studies have indicated that the Jak/Stat pathway is one of the principal signaling pathways utilized by members of the class I cytokine receptor family to transduce their signals in target tissues.

https://openalex.org/W2104667341,"Alteration in renal glomerular mesangial cell growth and fibronectin matrix deposition is a hallmark of glomerulosclerosis, which ultimately leads to end-stage renal failure. We have previously shown that the expression of integrin-linked kinase (ILK), a cytoplasmic component of the cell-extracellular matrix contacts, is increased in mesangial cells in human patients with diabetic nephropathy. We show here that ILK forms a complex with PINCH and CH-ILKBP in primary mesangial cells, which are co-clustered at fibrillar adhesions, sites that are involved in fibronectin matrix deposition. To investigate functional significance of the PINCH-ILK-CH-ILKBP complex formation, we expressed the PINCH-binding N-terminal fragment and the CH-ILKBP-binding C-terminal fragment of ILK, respectively, in mesangial cells by using an adenoviral expression system. Overexpression of either the N-terminal fragment or the C-terminal fragment of ILK effectively inhibited the PINCH-ILK-CH-ILKBP complex formation. Inhibition of the PINCH-ILK-CH-ILKBP complex formation significantly reduced fibronectin matrix deposition and inhibited cell proliferation. These results indicate that the PINCH-ILK-CH-ILKBP complex is critically involved in the regulation of mesangial fibronectin matrix deposition and cell proliferation, and suggest that it may potentially serve as a useful target in the therapeutic control of progressive renal failure and other pathological processes involving abnormal cell proliferation and fibronectin matrix deposition."
https://openalex.org/W2166167622,"Previous studies have shown that pharmacological activation of presynaptic kainate receptors at glutamatergic synapses facilitates or depresses transmission in a dose-dependent manner. However, the only synaptically activated kainate autoreceptor described to date is facilitatory. Here, we describe a kainate autoreceptor that depresses synaptic transmission. This autoreceptor is present at developing thalamocortical synapses in the barrel cortex, specifically regulates transmission at frequencies corresponding to those observed in vivo during whisker activation, and is developmentally down regulated during the first postnatal week. This receptor may, therefore, limit the transfer of high-frequency activity to the developing cortex, the loss of which mechanism may be important for the maturation of sensory processing."
https://openalex.org/W2001730105,"We report the extensive editing of mRNAs that encode the classical delayed rectifier K+ channel (SqKv1.1A) in the squid giant axon. Using a quantitative RNA editing assay, 14 adenosine to guanine transitions were identified, and editing efficiency varied tremendously between positions. Interestingly, half of the sites are targeted to the T1 domain, important for subunit assembly. Other sites occur in the channel's transmembrane spans. The effects of editing on K+ channel function are elaborate. Edited codons affect channel gating, and several T1 sites regulate functional expression as well. In particular, the edit R87G, a phylogenetically conserved position, reduces expression close to 50-fold by regulating the channel's ability to form tetramers. These data suggest that RNA editing plays a dynamic role in regulating action potential repolarization in the giant axon."
https://openalex.org/W2009181219,"In the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 pre-mRNA, different regions in the introns flanking alternative exon 7B have been implicated in the production of the A1 and A1B mRNA splice isoforms. Among these, the CE1a and CE4 elements, located downstream of common exon 7 and alternative exon 7B, respectively, are bound by hnRNP A1 to promote skipping of exon 7Bin vivo and distal 5′ splice site selection in vitro. Here, we report that CE1a is flanked by an additional high affinity A1 binding site (CE1d). In a manner similar to CE1a, CE1d affects 5′ splice site selection in vitro. Consistent with a role for hnRNP A1 in the activity of CE1d, a mutation that abrogates A1 binding abolishes distal 5′ splice site activation. Moreover, the ability of CE1d to stimulate distal 5′ splice site usage is lost in an HeLa extract depleted of hnRNP A/B proteins, and the addition of recombinant A1 restores the activity of CE1d. Notably, distal 5′ splice site selection mediated by A1 binding sites is not compromised in an extract prepared from mouse cells that are severely deficient in hnRNP A1 proteins. In this case, we show that hnRNP A2 compensates for the A1 deficiency. Further studies with the CE4 element reveal that it also consists of two distinct portions (CE4m and CE4p), each one capable of promoting distal 5′ splice site use in an hnRNP A1-dependent manner. The presence of multiple A1/A2 binding sites downstream of common exon 7 and alternative exon 7B probably plays an important role in maximizing the activity of hnRNP A1/A2 proteins. In the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 pre-mRNA, different regions in the introns flanking alternative exon 7B have been implicated in the production of the A1 and A1B mRNA splice isoforms.

Notably, distal 5′ splice site selection mediated by A1 binding sites is not compromised in an extract prepared from mouse cells that are severely deficient in hnRNP A1 proteins. In this case, we show that hnRNP A2 compensates for the A1 deficiency. Further studies with the CE4 element reveal that it also consists of two distinct portions (CE4m and CE4p), each one capable of promoting distal 5′ splice site use in an hnRNP A1-dependent manner. The presence of multiple A1/A2 binding sites downstream of common exon 7 and alternative exon 7B probably plays an important role in maximizing the activity of hnRNP A1/A2 proteins. mRNA precursor heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein nucleotide(s) glutathione S-transferase rA2, and rA1B, recombinant A1, A2, and A1B, respectively The alternative splicing of mRNA precursors (pre-mRNAs)1 is a major contributor to the diversity of the mammalian proteome (1Lander E.S.

The control of splice site selection therefore has profound implications in the production of protein isoforms with different functions. Recent progress in uncovering the molecular strategies that control alternative splicing has led to the identification of many types of sequence elements that influence either positively or negatively the selection of the alternative splice sites. Exonic splicing enhancers are bound by specific members of the SR protein family that can enforce the use of weak 5′ and 3′ splice sites (reviewed in Ref. 4Graveley B.R. RNA. 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Enhancer elements have also been described in the introns flanking some alternative exons (5Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell.

Other types of proteins, including members of the hnRNP F/H family of proteins, can bind specifically to intron or exon control elements and hence can contribute to enhancer activity (10Black D.L.

Elements that reduce the use of a neighboring splice site are also important in the control of splice site selection. In many cases, the activity of splicing silencers can be mediated by proteins that inhibit specific steps of splice site recognition or spliceosome assembly. A frequent example of this kind of splicing control in mammals involves the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein, which binds to some 3′ splice sequences and prevents U2AF binding (15Southby J. Gooding C. Smith C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2699-2711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lin C.H. Patton J.G. RNA. 1995; 1: 234-245PubMed Google Scholar, 17Singh R. Valcárcel J. Green M.R.

RNA. 1997; 3: 996-1015PubMed Google Scholar). Other examples uncovered in mammalian pre-mRNAs include the binding of the SR proteins ASF/SF2 and SRp30c upstream of the branch site in the adenovirus IIIa pre-mRNA and the hnRNP A1 pre-mRNA, respectively (20Simard M.J. Chabot B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4001-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 21Kanopka A. Mühlemann O. Aküsjarvi G. Nature. 1996; 381: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which inhibition occurs in these cases appear different, since ASF/SF2 prevents U2 snRNP binding in the adenoviral pre-mRNA, whereas SRp30c does not prevent the assembly of a U2-containing complex on the downstream 3′ splice site (21Kanopka A. Mühlemann O. Aküsjarvi G. Nature. 1996; 381: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 22Simard M.J. Chabot B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7353-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Members of the family of core hnRNP A/B proteins have also been identified as factors involved in the modulation of splice site selection. Using model pre-mRNAs carrying competing 5′ splice sites, important shifts toward distal 5′ splice sites can be obtained by the addition of purified or recombinant hnRNP A1 to a HeLa nuclear extract (23Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 365-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 24Mayeda A. Munroe S.H. Cáceres J.F. Krainer A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5483-5495Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The Drosophila hrp48 protein, which is similar to hnRNP A1, is required in collaboration with P-element somatic inhibitor and the U1 snRNP to repress splicing of the P-element pre-mRNA in somatic tissues (25Hammond L.E. Rudner D.Z. Kanaar R. Rio D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7260-7267Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). hnRNP A1 can elicit exon skipping, but not all pre-mRNAs are responsive to variations in the concentration of hnRNP A1 in vitro (26Mayeda A. Helfman D.M. Krainer A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2993-3001Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). A1 can also negatively affect the use of 3′ splice sites in a variety of exons including the alternative exon of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 gene (27Del Gatto-Konczak F. Olive M. Gesnel M.C. Breathnach R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), the tat and vpr exons of the human immunodeficiency virus (28Caputi M. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Zahler A.M.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2904-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Consistent with the finding that A1 can recognize specific RNA elements (33Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), most of the functions that have been attributed to hnRNP A1 in natural pre-mRNAs are based on its ability to interact with specific sequences. In all cases examined to date, the hnRNP A1 splice isoform A1B, the A2 protein, and its splicing variant B1 can functionally replace A1 in 5′ splice site and 3′ splice site selection assays in vitro (24Mayeda A. Munroe S.H. Cáceres J.F. Krainer A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5483-5495Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 28Caputi M. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Zahler A.M.

Virol. 2001; 75: 8487-8497Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that hnRNP A1 can modulate the alternative splicing of its own pre-mRNA through binding to sequences in the introns flanking alternative exon 7B. The 17-nt-long CE1a element downstream of exon 7 and the 24-nt-long CE4 sequence downstream of alternative exon 7B can promote distal 5′ splice site selection in an A1-dependent manner (34Chabot B. Blanchette M. Lapierre I. La Branche H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1776-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 35Blanchette M. Chabot B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1939-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Both CE1a and CE4 contain the sequence UAGAGU, which closely resembles the “winner” A1 binding site UAGGGU obtained by selection of amplified pools of RNA sequences (33Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Whereas these high affinity A1 binding sites promote strong shifts in 5′ splice site utilization in vitro, their effect on splicing is not associated with equivalent changes in U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle binding to the competing 5′ splice sites (34Chabot B. Blanchette M. Lapierre I. La Branche H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1776-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We have proposed that the mechanism by which hnRNP A1 controls 5′ splice site selection in this system involves an interaction between bound A1 molecules, an event that would place the proximal 5′ splice site in a loop and would bring in closer proximity the most distant pair of splice sites (35Blanchette M. Chabot B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1939-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 36Hutchison S. Simard M.J. Nasim F.H. Cordeau M. Chabot B. Recent Res. Dev. Mol. Cell.

Springer-Verlag GmbH & Co., Heidelberg, Germany2003Google Scholar). Here, we have uncovered additional elements capable of promoting distal 5′ splice site selection in vitro. Notably, we find that sequences flanking CE1a and different portions of CE4 can individually interact with hnRNP A1. Our results indicate that control elements promoting distal 5′ splice site utilization in the hnRNP A1 pre-mRNA are organized in groups of adjacent A1 binding sites. This organization may facilitate the recruitment of hnRNP A1/A2 proteins and may stimulate or stabilize the proposed change in pre-mRNA conformation. The pS1 plasmid was described previously (34Chabot B. Blanchette M. Lapierre I. La Branche H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1776-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). pSCE1 and pSCE1a correspond to the pS2 and pS10 plasmids described in Ref. 34Chabot B. Blanchette M. Lapierre I. La Branche H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1776-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar. pSCE1z, pSCE1z31, pSCE1z35, pSCE1e, pSCE1d, and pSCE1ad were produced by inserting reannealed oligonucleotides corresponding to the mouse sequences of various portions of CE1 at theSmaI site of pS1. pC3′ −/−, pC5′ −/−, pC5′ 4/4, and pC5′ 1a/1a were described in Ref. 35Blanchette M. Chabot B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1939-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar. To generate pC5′ 4m/4m, reannealed oligonucleotides corresponding to the mouse CE4m sequence were inserted into the SmaI site downstream of exon 7 and theEcoRV site downstream of exon 7B of pC5′ −/−. p45 was kindly provided by Faiz Nasim and was made by replacing theEcoO109I-EcoRI fragment of pC3′−/− with the EcoO109I-EcoRI fragment from pC5′−/−. p45-WCE1d and p45-M1 through p45-M7 were generated by inserting reannealed oligonucleotides into the XmaI site of p45, following Klenow treatment. The reannealed CE1e, CE1d, CE1dM6, and CE1dM7 oligonucleotides were inserted into the HincII site of pBluescript KS+ to produce pKCE1e, pKCE1d, pKCE1dM6, and pKCE1dM7. pKCE4m and pKCE1a were described previously (35Blanchette M. Chabot B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1939-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Splicing substrates were produced from plasmids linearized with ScaI, except for p45-M3 which was obtained by cutting with EarI, and transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of cap analog and [α-32P]UTP (AmershamBiosciences). CE1e, CE1d, M6, and M7 RNAs were produced from pKCE1e, pKCE1d, pKCE1dM6, and pKCE1dM7 linearized with HindIII, and CE1a and CE4m were produced from pKCE1a and pKCE4m linearized withEcoRI and transcribed as above. RNA purification was performed as described in Ref. 38Chabot B. Hames D. Higgins S. RNA Processing. 1. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 1-29Google Scholar. HeLa, CB3C7, and CB3C7-20 nuclear extracts were prepared (39Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) and used in splicing reactions as described previously (34Chabot B. Blanchette M. Lapierre I. La Branche H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1776-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Creatine kinase was added to HeLa, CB3C7, and CB3C7-20 extracts at a final concentration of 1 unit/12.5 μl. In all splicing gels, we have used lariat molecules (intermediates and products) to monitor splicing at each 5′ splice site. The fact that these molecules usually migrate above the pre-mRNA allows a more precise estimation of splicing efficiency, particularly when pre-mRNA degradation obscures mRNA production. Furthermore, adequate separation between lariat products requires longer runs or the use of lower percentage acrylamide gels, which cause the distal 5′ exon and the distal mRNA to run out the gel. Recombinant GST-A1, A2, and A1B proteins were purified using a glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) following procedure II as described in Fiset and Chabot (40Fiset S. Chabot B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2268-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Bacterial lysis was performed in buffer A (50 mm piperazine-HCl, pH 9.8, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml bacitracine, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) in the presence of 3 mg/ml lysozyme and 1% Triton X-100. The proteins were eluted from the columns with buffer B (200 mm piperazine-HCl, pH 9.8, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mmreduced glutathione). The purified proteins were dialyzed against buffer D (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). The concentration of the recombinant proteins was measured by Bradford (Bio-Rad) using serial dilutions of bovine serum albumin as a standard. The RNA samples were heated at 75 °C for 5 min in a splicing mix (34Chabot B. Blanchette M. Lapierre I. La Branche H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1776-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and snap-cooled on ice. The rA1, rA2, and rA1B proteins were then added to the reactions and allowed to incubate on ice for 10 min prior to the addition of heparin (0.74 mg/ml final concentration) and loading dye. The mixtures were run on 6% native acrylamide gels (29:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) in 1× TBE running buffer. The depletion of hnRNP A1/A1B/A2/B1 proteins from nuclear extracts was carried out essentially as described in Caputi et al. (28Caputi M. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Zahler A.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4060-4067Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 nmol of synthetic RNA oligonucleotide corresponding to a sequence within CE1a (UACCUUUAGAGUAGGC) (Dharmacon Research Inc.) were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, protected from light, in a 100-μl reaction volume containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 10 mm sodium periodate. The periodate-treated RNA was coupled to 0.5 ml of agarose adipic acid hydrazide resin following the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). The resin was washed twice with 10 ml of storage buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 5.7 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and kept as a 50% slurry at 4 °C. The coupling efficiency, which was typically higher than 95%, was measured by comparing the absorbance at 260 nm of 1% of the input periodate-treated RNA to 10% of the unbound material. 175 μl of HeLa nuclear extract containing 5.7 mmMgCl2, 0.90 mm ATP, 36 mmphosphocreatine, 3.58 mm dithiothreitol, and 1.25 unit/ml RNAguard was incubated with 50 μl of packed beads for 10 min at 30 °C under agitation. The mixture was spun, and the supernatant was transferred to a second tube containing 50 μl of the same packed beads. The beads were washed four times with 1 ml of 70% buffer D (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 5 mmMgCl2. The bound proteins were eluted from the column with 100 μl of loading dye (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 6m urea, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.7 mmercaptoethanol, 0.003% bromphenol blue). Equivalent ratios of nuclear extract and proteins eluted from the CE1a RNA column were separated on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels. These samples were transferred to nitrocellulose filters and probed for the presence of hnRNP A1/A1B/A2/B1 using a rabbit serum containing antibodies against a peptide sequence shared by these proteins (kindly provided by Telogene Inc., Sherbrooke, Québec, Canada). This serum was used at a dilution of 1:1000, and decorated proteins were revealed using the ECL detection kit (AmershamBiosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 150-nt-long CE1 element is located in the intron downstream of common exon 7 in the hnRNP A1 pre-mRNA. CE1 is required for efficient skipping of alternative exon 7B in vivo and stimulates distal 5′ splice site use when inserted between the 5′ splice sites of exon 7 and exon 7B in a model pre-mRNA in vitro (34Chabot B. Blanchette M. Lapierre I. La Branche H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1776-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We have reported previously that a small 17-nt segment (CE1a) is responsible for a large portion of the effect of CE1 on 5′ splice site selection (34Chabot B. Blanchette M. Lapierre I. La Branche H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1776-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, because CE1a does not fully restore the activity of the larger CE1 element, additional sequences within CE1 may also be promoting distal 5′ splice site usage. To identify these sequences, we inserted the 3′ end portion of CE1 (CE1z, 58 nt; Fig. 1A) between the two 5′ splice sites in our model pre-mRNA. Typically, the level of proximal and distal 5′ splice site use can be assessed by monitoring the production of lariat molecules following incubation of a labeled pre-mRNA in a nuclear extract and separating the spliced products on a denaturing gel. In comparison with the control S1 pre-mRNA, incubation of SCE1z RNA in a HeLa extract indicated that CE1z stimulated the use of the distal 5′ splice site as observed by an increase in lariat products generated by the use of this site (Fig.1B, compare lane 4 withlane 1). The amplitude of the stimulation was comparable with the effect of CE1a (Fig. 1B, comparelane 4 with lane 3). As observed previously, the full 150-nt CE1 element promoted a nearly complete loss of proximal 5′ splice site use (Fig. 1B, lane 2). To further define the sequence within CE1z that was responsible for the shift, we fragmented CE1z into two smaller slightly overlapping units (CE1z35 and CE1z31). Whereas CE1z31 had a small effect on 5′ splice site selection, CE1z35 was much more active in switching splicing to the distal 5′ splice site (Fig.1B, compare lanes 5 and 6with lane 4). A further dissection of CE1z35 into CE1e (16 nt) and CE1d (19 nt) showed that CE1d, but not CE1e, could shift splicing toward the distal 5′ splice site (Fig. 1B, lanes 7 and 8, respectively). These results indicate that the 19-nt-long CE1d element contains sequences that can promote distal 5′ splice site selection in vitro as efficiently as the previously described CE1a element. When we tested a portion of CE1 that contained both CE1a and CE1d (CE1ad), we observed that the combination of the two elements shifted 5′ splice site selection to a level that was comparable with the level obtained with the complete CE1 element (Fig. 1C, compare lane 3 with lane 2). Thus, the activity of CE1 in HeLa extracts apparently results from the combined effects of CE1a and CE1d. Because hnRNP A1 has been implicated in the activity of CE1a, we tested whether hnRNP A1 was also involved in the activity of CE1d. First, we assessed the ability of hnRNP A1 to interact with CE1d by performing a gel mobility shift assay using increasing amounts of a recombinant GST-A1 protein (rA1). The RNA used for this assay is 83 nt long and contains plasmid sequences followed by the CE1d element. Since CE1e had no effect on 5′ splice site selection, it was used as a control in place of the CE1d element. Slower migrating complexes were observed with CE1d but not with CE1e (Fig.2C, top panel), indicating a specific interaction of rA1 with CE1d. The observation that recombinant A1 protein can specifically interact with CE1d suggests that this interaction may be required for the CE1d-dependent switch in 5′ splice site selection observedin vitro. To test this possibility, we produced seven mutations spanning the CE1d element and assessed their effects on 5′ splice site selection in a HeLa nuclear extract. The mutations are listed in Fig. 2A, and they were tested in a slightly shorter version of the S1 pre-mRNA (pre-mRNA 45) for cloning reasons. Inserting CE1d in pre-mRNA 45 (WCE1d) promotes distal 5′ splice site utilization in a manner similar to what was observed in the S1 backbone (Fig. 2B, lane 2). The majority of the mutations in CE1d did not compromise the activity of the element (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 3–7 and 9 with lane 2). Mutant M6, however, failed to activate distal 5′ splice site selection, yielding a splicing pattern that was similar to the profile obtained in the absence of CE1d (Fig. 2B, compare lane 8 with lane 1). We then tested the small 83-nt-long RNA containing the M6 sequence (M6*) instead of CE1d for binding by hnRNP A1. In comparison with a similar transcript containing the M7 sequence (M7*), which was bound by rA1 (Fig.2C, bottom panel, lanes 5–8), M6* RNA was not bound significantly by rA1 (lanes 1–4). The correlation between A1 binding and the efficiency of distal 5′ splice site activation is consistent with the notion that A1 is involved in the activity of CE1d. To demonstrate that hnRNP A1 mediates the activity of CE1d, we carried out the depletion of hnRNP A1 from a HeLa nuclear extract by affinity chromatography using RNA molecules carrying a high affinity binding site for hnRNP A1. The CE1a RNA was covalently linked to agarose-adipic acid beads and incubated in the presence of a HeLa nuclear extract. The flow-through fraction was recovered and used as the depleted nuclear extract. Western analysis using a polyclonal antibody that recognizes the core hnRNP A1, A2, B1, and A1B proteins (Fig.3A, lane 1) indicates that the majority of these hnRNP proteins had been removed from the nuclear extract (lane 5). hnRNP A1, A2, B1, and A1B proteins were found in the fractions bound to successive CE1a columns (Fig. 3A, lanes 6 and 7). A mock-depleted nuclear extract was also prepared by loading a HeLa nuclear extract on a column lacking RNA. The mock-depleted extract contains the core hnRNP A/B proteins (Fig. 3A, lane 2), and no signal was detected in the bound fractions (lanes 3 and 4). The mock- and A/B-depleted extracts were then tested for activity using a CE1a-containing pre-mRNA (SCE1a). We have shown previously that 5′ splice site usage on this pre-mRNA can be displaced from the distal to the proximal donor site by the addition of an excess of DNA oligonucleotide carrying A1 binding sites and that supplementation with rA1 restores efficient distal 5′ splice site use (35Blanchette M. Chabot B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1939-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Whereas distal 5′ splice site use was predominantly observed in the mock-depleted extract (Fig. 3B, lane 1), only the proximal 5′ splice site was used in the A/B-depleted extract (lane 2), consistent with a role for hnRNP A/B proteins in the activity of CE1a. SCE1d pre-mRNA was similarly spliced to the proximal 5′ splice site in the A/B-depleted extract, suggesting that these proteins may also be required for the activity of CE1d (Fig. 3B, lane 4). The addition of increasing amounts of rA1 to the A/B-depleted extract shifted splicing toward the distal donor site in a CE1d-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). At the highest concentration tested, the addition of rA1 to the SCE1d pre-mRNA nearly completely abrogated proximal 5′ splice site use and activated the distal 5′ splice site (Fig. 3C, lane 10). In contrast, at the same concentration of rA1, proximal 5′ splice site use remained the predominant choice for the control S1 pre-mRNA (Fig. 3C, lane 6). Thus, the greater sensitivity of a pre-mRNA containing CE1d to the supplementation with rA1 indicates that hnRNP A1 can mediate the activity of CE1d. To determine whether hnRNP A1 is absolutely necessary for the activity of CE1a and CE1d, we monitored splicing in an extract prepared from a mouse erythroleukemic cell line previously shown to be severely deficient in hnRNP A1 protein expression. The CB3C7 cell line expresses at least 250-fold lower levels of A1 and A1B mRNAs, because oneHrnpa1 allele has been deleted while the other allele has suffered a retroviral insertion event (41Ben-David Y. Bani M.R. Chabot B., De Koven A. Bernstein A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4449-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 42Yang X. Bani M.R., Lu, S.J. Rowan S. Ben-David Y. Chabot B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Similar to what was observed in a HeLa extract (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–3), both CE1 and CE1a improved distal 5′ splice site utilization in a nuclear extract prepared from CB3C7 cells (Fig.4A, compare lanes 2 and 3 with lane 1). We also tested splicing in a nuclear extract prepared from a derivative of the CB3C7 cell line, which is stably restored for hnRNP A1 expression (CB3C7–20; Fig. 4B, lane 3) (42Yang X. Bani M.R., Lu, S.J. Rowan S. Ben-David Y. Chabot B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The relative levels of distal 5′ splice site utilization of the SCE1a pre-mRNA were comparable in the CB3C7–20 and in the A1-compromised CB3C7 extracts (Fig. 4A, lane 5). These results suggest that CB3C7 cells contain a factor(s) that functionally replace hnRNP A1, allowing CB3C7 extracts to carry out CE1- and CE1a-dependent shifts in 5′ splice site selection. Several observations suggest that the hnRNP A2 protein can functionally replace hnRNP A1 in its ability to promote distal 5′ splice site usein vitro (24Mayeda A. Munroe S.H. Cáceres J.F. Krainer A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5483-5495Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). A2 and its splice variant hnRNP B1 can also replace A1 when repression of a 3′ splice site is associated with nearby high affinity A1 binding sites (28Caputi M. M"
https://openalex.org/W2133471277,"Adhesion molecules such as E-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expressed on endothelial cells (ECs) at sites of inflammation play an important role in the recruitment of leukocytes from the bloodstream into extravascular tissue. However, little is known about the signaling pathways that are initiated in ECs following adhesion molecule engagement. Here, we report that an 85-kDa protein becomes tyrosine phosphorylated in human ECs following leukocyte adhesion or upon antibody-induced clustering of E-selectin or ICAM-1. Through immunoprecipitation experiments, this protein was identified as cortactin, a cytoskeleton-binding molecule and prominent src substrate involved in cell adhesion. Following adhesion molecule clustering, cortactin phosphorylation was inhibited by the src family kinase inhibitor PP2. Both src and tyrosine-phosphorylated cortactin were found to be associated with E-selectin and ICAM-1 following adhesion of antibody-coated beads to ECs. PP2 did not inhibit the association of cortactin with E-selectin and ICAM-1; however, PP2 inhibited adhesion between paraformaldehyde-fixed THP-1 cells and ECs. This decrease in adhesion correlated with inhibition of adhesion molecule clustering on PP2-treated ECs at sites of THP-1 attachment. These findings implicate src and cortactin as mediators of leukocyte/EC interactions at sites of inflammation by regulating adhesion molecule clustering on ECs."

Ca2+ binding to the regulatory domain of cTnC (cNTnC) induces little structural change but sets the stage for cTnI binding. A large “closed” to “open” conformational transition occurs in the regulatory domain upon binding cTnI147–163 or bepridil. This raises the question of whether cTnI147–163 and bepridil compete for cNTnC·Ca2+. In this work, we used two-dimensional1H,15N-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectroscopy to examine the binding of bepridil to cNTnC·Ca2+ in the absence and presence of cTnI147–163 and of cTnI147–163 to cNTnC·Ca2+ in the absence and presence of bepridil. The results show that bepridil and cTnI147–163 bind cNTnC·Ca2+ simultaneously but with negative cooperativity. The affinity of cTnI147–163 for cNTnC·Ca2+ is reduced ∼ 3.5-fold by bepridil and vice versa. Using multinuclear and multidimensional NMR spectroscopy, we have determined the structure of the cNTnC·Ca2+·cTnI147–163·bepridil ternary complex. The structure reveals a binding site for cTnI147–163 primarily located on the A/B interhelical interface and a binding site for bepridil in the hydrophobic pocket of cNTnC·Ca2+. In the structure, the N terminus of the peptide clashes with part of the bepridil molecule, which explains the negative cooperativity between cTnI147–163 and bepridil for cNTnC·Ca2+. This structure provides insights into the features that are important for the design of cTnC-specific cardiotonic drugs, which may be used to modulate the Ca2+ sensitivity of the myofilaments in heart muscle contraction.

Parallel arrays of thick and thin myofilaments organized into sarcomeres within cardiac myocytes are directly responsible for this force generation. Specifically, myosin cross-bridges on thick filaments attach to actin on thin filaments to produce force. This actomyosin interaction is regulated by troponin, a heteotrimeric complex on thin filaments that is comprised of the Ca2+-binding subunit troponin C (cTnC),1inhibitory subunit troponin I (cTnI), and tropomyosin-binding subunit troponin T (cTnT) (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C.

The troponin complex recognizes the transient increase in cytosolic Ca2+ levels in the cardiac myocytes to initiate cardiac muscle contraction. This critical function is accomplished by cTnC, a member of the EF-hand family of Ca2+-binding proteins. The NMR solution structure of cTnC has been determined, and it revealed the presence of two globular domains, N and C, joined by a flexible linker in solution (3Sia S.K., Li, M.X. Spyracopoulos L.

The overall fold of the cTnC structure is very similar to that of skeletal muscle troponin C (sTnC) (4Herzberg O. James M.N.G. J. Mol.

Circulation. 1991; 84: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the significant differences in the first 40 residues, particularly the presence of a defunct Ca2+-binding site I in cTnC, leads to strikingly different Ca2+-induced structural changes in the N-domain of the two proteins. While sNTnC switches from a “closed” to an “open” conformation upon the binding of two Ca2+ions (8Gagné S.M. Tsuda S., Li, M.X. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 9Strynadka N.C.J. Cherney M. Sielecki A.R., Li, M.X. Smillie L.B. James M.N.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 238-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), cNTnC undergoes minimal conformational changes and remains essentially closed upon the binding of one Ca2+ ion (10Spyracopoulos L., Li, M.X. Sia S.K. Gagné S.M. Chandra M. Solaro R.J. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12138-12146Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The exposed hydrophobic surface in the Ca2+-saturated sTnC serves as the sTnI-binding site (11McKay R.T. Tripet B.P. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28494-28500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar,12McKay R.T. Pearlstone J.R. Corson D.C. Gagne S.M. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12419-12430Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Despite the significant reduction in the hydrophobic surface exposure of Ca2+-saturated cTnC, cTnI is able to force open the regulatory domain and binds in a similar fashion as sTnI (13Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The end results are that both the regulatory domains of sTnC and cTnC adopt similar open conformations when bound to their respective TnI regions (sTnI115–131 and cTnI147–163) (13Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 14Spyracopoulos L. McKay R. Sykes B. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 434AGoogle Scholar). This region of TnI has been identified by many biological and biophysical studies to be the region directly responsible for binding to the regulatory domain of TnC, and this interaction modulates those between the N-terminal (sTnI1–40 and cTnI34–71) and the inhibitory regions (sTnI96–115 and cTnI128–147) of TnI and TnC (for reviews, see Refs. 15Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar and16Solaro R.J. Rarick H.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). This conclusion is reinforced by the recently reported 2.6-Å x-ray structure of the cTnC·3Ca2+·cTnI34–210·cTnT2182–288complex (17Takeda S. Yamashida A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 170aAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), in which the regions encompassing cNTnC·Ca2+ and cTnI147–163 match the NMR solution structure of the cNTnC·Ca2+·cTnI147–163 complex (13Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Thus, the sequence of events involved in initiating skeletal and cardiac muscle contraction are actually very similar. However, these events are controlled by delicate energetic balance for the two systems to account for the different physiological behavior of the two muscle types (18McKay R.T. Saltibus L.F., Li, M.X. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12731-12738Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The essential role of cTnC in the regulation of heart muscle contraction makes it an attractive target for cardiotonic drugs in the therapy of heart diseases. These drugs are expected to tune the cardiac function by modulating the Ca2+ sensitivity of the myofilaments and the myofilament protein interactions. Bepridil is one member of the pharmacological compounds capable of binding cTnC and modulating its Ca2+ binding affinity (19MacLachlan L.K. Reid D.G. Mitchell R.C. Salter C.J. Smith S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9764-9770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Solaro R.J. Bousquet P. Johnson J.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1986; 238: 502-507PubMed Google Scholar). The affinity of bepridil has been reported to be ∼10 μm for isolated cTnC (20Solaro R.J. Bousquet P. Johnson J.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1986; 238: 502-507PubMed Google Scholar) and ∼140 μm for the cTnC·cTnI complex (21Abusamhadneh E. Abbott M.B. Dvoretsky A. Finley N. Sasi S. Rosevear P.R. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). An NMR study, using Met residues as markers, identified three bepridil binding sites in cTnC (22Kleerekoper Q. Liu W. Choi D. Putkey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8153-8160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the x-ray structure of the cTnC·3Ca2+·3bepridil complex (23Li Y. Love M.L. Putkey J.A. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5140-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), two bepridil molecules located in the hydrophobic cavity between domains pull the domains close together to result in a compact structure for cTnC, and a third bepridil appears to stabilize an open regulatory domain conformation by binding to the center of the hydrophobic pocket, much like cTnI147–163. The fact that both cTnI147–163 and bepridil can induce a structural ‘opening' in the N-domain of cTnC by interacting with the hydrophobic patch of the domain prompted us to explore whether cTnI147–163 and bepridil compete for cNTnC· Ca2+. To address this issue, we used two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC NMR spectroscopy to examine the binding of bepridil to cNTnC·Ca2+ in the absence and presence of cTnI147–163 and of cTnI147–163 to cNTnC·Ca2+ in the absence and presence of bepridil. The results show that the drug and cTnI147–163 peptide bind to cNTnC·Ca2+simultaneously but with negative cooperativity. The affinity of cTnI147–163 for cNTnC·Ca2+ is reduced ∼3.5-fold by bepridil and vice versa. Using multinuclear and multidimensional NMR spectroscopy, we have determined the structure of the ternary cNTnC·Ca2+·cTnI147–163·bepridil complex. The structure reveals a binding site for cTnI147–163 primarily located on the A/B interhelical interface and a binding site for bepridil in the hydrophobic core of cNTnC·Ca2+. In the structure, the N terminus of the peptide clashes with part of the bepridil molecule, which explains the observed negative cooperativity between cTnI147–163and bepridil for cNTnC·Ca2+. The current structure provides insights into the features that are important for the design of cTnC-specific cardiotonic drugs, which may be used to tune the cardiac function by modulating the Ca2+ sensitivity of the myofilaments and the myofilament protein interactions. The engineering of the expression vector of cNTnC-(1–89) mutant was as described in Chandra et al. (24Chandra M. Dong W.J. Pan B.S. Cheung H.C. Solaro R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13305-13311Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The expression of 15N- and15N/13C-labeled cNTnC in Escherichia coli was as described previously (25Li M.X. Gagné S.M. Spyracopoulos L. Kloks C.P.A.M. Audette G. Chandra M. Solaro R.J. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1997; : 12519-12525Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The synthetic peptide cTnI147–163, acetyl-RISADAMMQALLGARAK-amide, was prepared and characterized as described previously (13Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Bepridil was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Stock solutions (93 mm and 46.5 mm, respectively) of bepridil in Me2SO-d6 (Cambridge Isotopes Inc.) were prepared, and the vials containing the solutions were wrapped in aluminum foil due to its sensitivity to light. All NMR samples were 500 μl in volume. The buffer conditions were 100 mm KCl, 10 mm imidazole in 90% H2O/10% D2O, 15 mm dithiothreitol, and the pH was 6.8. Two bepridil titrations were performed, one to a cNTnC·Ca2+ sample and the other to a cNTnC·Ca2+·cTnI147–163complex sample. Two cTnI147–163 titrations were performed, one using 15N-cNTnC·Ca2+ and the other with the 15N-cNTnC·Ca2+·bepridil complex. For structure determination, NMR samples contain 1–2 mm cNTnC, 6–8 mm Ca2+, 1–2 mm bepridil, and 3–6 mm cTnI147–163. This titration reproduces the titration reported previously (13Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). cTnI147–163 peptide is highly soluble in aqueous solution but tends to form a gel at high concentrations (>50 mm), likely due to aggregation. Thus, no stock peptide solution was prepared; instead, solid peptide was added at every titration point. To a NMR tube containing a 500-μl sample of 0.56 mm15N-cNTnC·Ca2+, solid cTnI147–163 was added for the seven titration points. The sample was mixed thoroughly with each addition. 2 μl of sample was taken at every titration point for amino acid analysis to determine the peptide/protein ratios. Changes in pH associated with cTnI147–163 additions were compensated for by adjusting to pH 6.8 at every titration point. To an NMR tube containing a 500-μl sample of 0.50 mm15N-cNTnC·Ca2+, aliquots of 0.5 μl of 93 mm bepridil in Me2SO-d6 were added for the nine titration points. The sample was mixed thoroughly with each addition. The total volume increase was 4.5 μl, and the change in protein concentration due to dilution was taken into account for data analysis. The change in pH from bepridil addition was negligible. As a control experiment, a two-dimensional 1H,15N-HSQC NMR spectrum of15N-cNTnC·Ca2+ in the presence of 4.5 μl of pure Me2SO-d6 was acquired to confirm that Me2SO-d6 has no effect on15N-cNTnC·Ca2+. To a 500-μl NMR sample containing 0.58 mm15N-cNTnC·Ca2+ and 2.0 mm cTnI147–163, aliquots of 1 μl of 46.5 mm bepridil in Me2SO-d6 were added for the six titration points. The sample was mixed thoroughly after each addition, and no precipitation was observed. The change in pH from the addition of bepridil was negligible. The total volume increase was 6 μl, and the change in protein concentration due to dilution was taken into account for data analysis. To a 500-μl NMR sample containing 0.50 mm15N-cNTnC·Ca2+, aliquots of 6 μl of 46.5 mm bepridil in Me2SO-d6 were added to obtain a 1:115N-cNTnC·Ca2+:bepridil complex. Solid cTnI147–163 peptide was added at every titration point. The sample was mixed thoroughly with each addition. 2 μl of sample was taken at every titration point for amino acid analysis to determine the peptide/protein ratios. Changes in pH associated with cTnI147–163 additions were compensated for by adjusting to pH 6.8 at every titration point. Precipitation of free bepridil was not observed during the titration. Most NMR data used in this study were collected at 30 °C using Unity 600 MHz and Unity Inova 500-MHz spectrometers. Both spectrometers are equipped with triple resonance probes and Z-pulsed field gradients. Two-dimensional 1H,15N-HSQC spectra were acquired using the sensitivity-enhanced gradient pulse scheme developed by Lewis E. Kay and coworkers (26Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem.

For cNTnC in the ternary complex, the chemical shift assignments of the backbone and side-chain atoms and NOE interproton distance restraints were determined using two-dimensional and three-dimensional NMR experiments described in Table I. For the bound cTnI147–163peptide, the proton chemical shifts of the peptide were assigned using two-dimensional 15N/13C-filtered NOESY (250-ms mixing time) and two-dimensional15N/13C-filtered DIPSI experiments (43.2-ms spinlock time). The pulse sequences for these two experiments were based on Ogura et al. (28Ogura K. Terasawa H. Inagaki F. J. Biomol.

The spectra were analyzed using NMRView (32Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar). For cNTnC in the complex, intramolecular distance restraints obtained from the NOESY experiments were calibrated according to Gagné et al. (33Gagné S.M., Li, M.X. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4386-4392Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Intramolecular proton distances for the peptide and bepridil in the complex were calibrated by classifying NOE intensities as strong (2–4 Å), medium (3–5 Å), and weak (4–6 Å). Intermolecular NOEs between bepridil and cNTnC, between cTnI147–163 and cNTnC, and between bepridil and cTnI147–163 were obtained from the15N/13C-filtered and the15N/13C-filtered/edited experiments. Dihedral angle restraints for cNTnC in the complex were derived from data obtained from HNHA, HNHB, and NOESY-HSQC experiments according to Siaet al. (3Sia S.K., Li, M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Gagné S.M.

For bound cTnI147–163, dihedral restraints of −60° ± 25° and −30° ± 25° for φ and ψ, respectively, were obtained from the chemical shift indices of the peptide 1Hα protons for residues that showed α-helical chemical shift indices values (34Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Using an initial set of intramolecular NOE restraints for cNTnC, 100 structures of cNTnC alone were calculated starting from an extended conformation. The calculations were done using simulated annealing protocol implemented in X-PLOR (35Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1 A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven1992Google Scholar) with 10,000 high temperature steps (time step of 30 ps) and 6000 cooling steps (time step of 30 ps). Approximately 50% of the initial structures converged. These structures were used as templates for further rounds of refinements. Dihedral angle restraints and six artificial distance restraints from chelating oxygen atoms to Ca2+ ion were added at later stages of the refinement process. The structure of the ternary complex was calculated starting from the extended conformations of cNTnC, bepridil, and cTnI147–163 peptide using simulated annealing protocol with the same conditions as above. The calculations were carried out using the distance and the φ, ψ, and χ1 dihedral restraints for cNTnC and for cTnI147–163 (see Table II), 6 distance restraints to the Ca2+ ion, 28 intermolecular distance restraints between cNTnC and bepridil, 30 intermolecular distance restraints between cNTnC and cTnI147–163 peptide, 24 intramolecular distance restrains for the bound cTnI147–163 peptide, as well as an intermolecular distance restraint between bepridil and cTnI147–163 (see Table II).

Wang, M. X. Li, and B. D. Sykes, unpublished.was used to monitor the binding of cTnI147–163 to cNTnC·Ca2+·bepridil. Using residues Leu-29 and Glu-66 of cNTnC as examples, Fig.1 depicts the cTnI147–163-induced peak shifts on cNTnC·Ca2+ (arrow A), the bepridil-induced peak shifts on cNTnC·Ca2+ (arrow B), the bepridil-induced peak shifts on cNTnC·Ca2+·cTnI147–163 (arrow C), and the cTnI147–163-induced peak shifts on cNTnC·Ca2+·bepridil (arrow D). It is important to point out that these two residues do exemplify all of the residues in the protein, which undergo backbone amide1H or 15N chemical shift changes during titrations. In Fig. 1, arrows A and D represent the binding of cTnI147–163 to cNTnC·Ca2+ in the absence and presence of bepridil, respectively, whereasarrows B and C represent the binding of bepridil to cNTnC·Ca2+ in the absence and presence of cTnI147–163, respectively. It is interesting to notice that arrows A and B point to different directions, but arrows C and D point to the same end position. This indicates that a stable ternary cNTnC·Ca2+·cTnI147–163·bepridil complex forms in the end regardless of whether bepridil was added first followed by cTnI147–163 or vice versa. This observation is reminiscent of our previous work on EMD 57033 and cTnI128–147 binding to cTnC·3Ca2+, where we demonstrated that both EMD 57033 and cTnI128–147bind cTnC·3Ca2+ in 1:1 ratios in a non-competitive manner (36Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Beier N. Putkey J.A. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8782-8790Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Neither is EMD 57033 binding affected by cTnI128–147nor does EMD 57033 affect cTnI128–147 binding. In the end, a stable ternary cTnC·3Ca2+·cTnI128–147·EMD 57033 complex is formed. Using the same approach as for cTnI128–147and EMD 57033 binding to cTnC, we analyzed the chemical shift changes as a function of the ligand to protein ratios and determined the binding affinities of cTnI147–163 for cNTnC·Ca2+ in the absence and presence of bepridil and those of bepridil for cNTnC·Ca2+ in the absence and presence of cTnI147–163. In contrast to the interaction of EMD 57033 and cTnI128–147 with cTnC·3Ca2+, where the affinity of one ligand is not affected by the other, the affinity of cTnI147–163 for cNTnC·Ca2+ is decreased ∼3.5-fold (from a KD of 154 ± 30 μm to a KD of 550 ± 50 μm) by the presence of bepridil, and that of bepridil for cNTnC·Ca2+ is also decreased ∼3.5-fold (from aKD of 23 ± 5 μm to aKD of 80 ± 15 μm) by the presence of cTnI147–163. This is somewhat surprising, because bepridil has been shown to increase both the activity of actomyosin AT"

MRP1 and MRP2 are thought to contain an N-terminal region of five transmembrane segments (TMD0) coupled to 2 times six transmembrane segments via an intracellular loop (L0). We previously demonstrated for MRP1 that a mutant lacking TMD0 but still containing L0, called L0ΔMRP1, was functional and routed to the lateral plasma membrane. To investigate the role of the TMD0L0 region of MRP2 in routing to the apical membrane, we generated mutants similar to those made for MRP1. In contrast to L0ΔMRP1, L0ΔMRP2 was associated with an intracellular compartment, most likely endosomes. Co-expression with TMD0, however, resulted in apical localization of L0ΔMRP2 and transport activity. Uptake experiments with vesicles containing L0ΔMRP2 demonstrated that the molecule is able to transport LTC4. An MRP2 mutant without TMD0L0, ΔMRP2, was only core-glycosylated and localized intracellularly. Co-expression of ΔMRP2 with TMD0L0 resulted in an increased protein level of ΔMRP2, full glycosylation of the protein, routing to the apical membrane, and transport activity. Our results suggest that the TMD0 region is required for routing to or stable association with the apical membrane.

To examine whether the TMD0 segment is dispensable for the routing of MRP2 to the apical membrane, we have constructed similar mutants as described above for MRP1.

Further details are available upon request. MRP2, ΔMRP2, and L0ΔMRP2 were inserted into the retroviral vector pCMV-neo (33Bengal E. Ransone L. Scharfman R. Dwarki R. Tapscott S.J. Weintraub H.

After selection of transduced cells with either G418 (800 μg/ml) or puromycin (2 μg/ml), single clones were isolated. Detection of the various mutant MRP2 molecules was performed by Western blotting. Proteins were detected using the appropriate monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (see Fig. 2A). L0ΔMRP2 cDNAs were removed from the pCMV-L0ΔMRP2 construct and subcloned into the pAcUW21 plasmid (Invitrogen). pAcUW21-MRP2 was described previously (28Bakos E. Evers R. Calenda G. Tusnady G.E.

Cells were grown on microporous polycarbonate membrane filters (3-μm pore size, 24-mm diameter, TranswellTM 3414; Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well as described previously (30Evers R.

Antibody incubations were as described previously (30Evers R. Kool M. van Deemter L. Janssen H. Calafat J. Oomen L.C.J.M. Paulusma C.C. Oude Elferink R.P.J. Baas F. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1310-1319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were examined with a Leica TCS SP confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems Heidelberg GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) equipped with a ×63 objective. For the co-localization experiments (see Fig. 7), cells were examined with a Zeiss Laser-Scanning Microscope LSM410 equipped with a ×40 objective. Enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) was excited with a krypton 413 laser line; Alexa 532 was excited with a HeNe 543 laser line. MDCKII-MRP2 and MDCKII-L0ΔMRP2 cells were seeded in 12-well plates (3-μm pore size, 12-mm diameter, TranswellTM 3402; Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well. The next day, cells were transiently transfected with pECFP-Endo (0.8 g) or pECFP-Golgi (1.25 g) using LipofectAMINETM 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Five hours after the transfection, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were analyzed after culturing for 24 h. Longer incubation times resulted in toxic effects of the pECFP vectors. Cells were grown for 3 days on microporous polycarbonate filters at a density of 2 × 106 cells/well. Export of [14C]dinitrophenyl glutathione ([14C]DNP-GS) from cells was determined by incubating cells with [14C]CDNB as described previously (30Evers R. Kool M. van Deemter L. Janssen H. Calafat J.

[3H]Vinblastine transport assays were carried out exactly as described (30Evers R. Kool M. van Deemter L. Janssen H. Calafat J. Oomen L.C.J.M. Paulusma C.C. Oude Elferink R.P.J. Baas F. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1310-1319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were seeded in Petri dishes and grown overnight. The next day, tunicamycin (1.5 μg/ml) was added to the medium, and cells were harvested at the time points indicated. For treatment with proteasome inhibitors, cells were seeded as mentioned above. The next day, lactacystin (50 μm) or ALLN (50 μg/ml) was added to the medium. Cells were harvested after an incubation time of 8 h. To investigate the role of the TMD0L0 segment in the routing and function of MRP2, the following mutants were generated (Fig. 1): (i) ΔMRP2 (amino acids 306–1545), (ii) HA-TMD0 (HA tag followed by amino acids 2–189), (iii) TMD0L0 (amino acids 1–305), and (iv) L0ΔMRP2 (amino acids 189–1545). The TMD0L0 and TMD0 fragments were cloned into the retroviral pBabe-CMV-puro vector. ΔMRP2 and L0ΔMRP2 were cloned into the pCMV-neo vector. The use of the pBabe-CMV-Puro and pCMV-neo vectors enabled the selection of two different constructs in one cell. The ΔMRP2 and L0ΔMRP2 proteins were detected with mAb M2III-6, TMD0L0 and L0ΔMRP2 were detected with mAb M2I-4, and HA-TMD0 was detected with mAb 12CA5 (recognizing the HA epitope), as shown in Fig.2A. Monoclonal antibody M2III-6 was raised against amino acids 1339–1545 from rat Mrp2 (3Paulusma C.C. Bosma P.J. Zaman G.J.R. Bakker C.T.M. Otter M. Scheffer G.L. Scheper R.J. Borst P.

Hepatology. 1997; 25: 1539-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar); mAb M2I-4 was raised against amino acids 215–310 of human MRP2 (34Scheffer G.L. Kool M. Heijn M. de Haas M. Pijnenborg A.C. Wijnholds J. van Helvoort A. de Jong M.C. Hooijberg J.H. Mol C.A. van der Linden M. de Vree J.M. van der Valk P. Elferink R.P. Borst P. Scheper R.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5269-5277PubMed Google Scholar). We previously characterized MDCKII-derived cell lines stably producing the MRP2 protein (30Evers R. Kool M. van Deemter L. Janssen H. Calafat J. Oomen L.C.J.M. Paulusma C.C. Oude Elferink R.P.J. Baas F. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1310-1319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using retroviral transductions, we generated MDCKII-derived clones stably expressing the ΔMRP2 or L0ΔMRP2 constructs. By Western blot analysis, we identified several clones that produced relatively high amounts of L0ΔMRP2 (Fig. 2B, lane 7). We also succeeded in isolating clones producing ΔMRP2, but the protein was difficult to detect in total cell lysates (not visible on the exposure of the Western blot shown in Fig.2B, lane 3, but see Fig.3). To investigate whether this was due to proteasome-mediated degradation, cells were incubated in the presence of the proteasome inhibitors ALLN and lactacystin, and this resulted in a clear increase in the amount of ΔMRP2 (Fig. 3). The MDCKII-MRP2 and MDCKII-L0ΔMRP2 cells were retrovirally transduced with plasmids containing either TMD0L0 or HA-TMD0. Cells were selected with puromycin, and single clones were analyzed by Western blotting. As documented in Fig. 2, B and C, clones producing both the ΔMRP2 and TMD0L0Δ protein were isolated. Remarkably, whereas ΔMRP2 produced alone was hardly detectable, co-production with TMD0L0resulted in a strong increase in the amount of ΔMRP2 (Fig.2B, lane 3 versus lanes 4 and 5). In the clone containing both ΔMRP2 and TMD0 (without the L0 part), the amount of ΔMRP2 was not increased (Fig.2B, lane 6). Cells producing L0ΔMRP2 and TMD0L0 or TMD0, respectively, were also isolated (Fig. 2, C and E, lanes 8–10). In these clones, no significant changes in the level of L0ΔMRP2 were observed (Fig. 2B). TMD0 appeared as a discrete band with an apparent molecular mass of 24 kDa and a number of bands around 40 kDa (Fig. 2E, lanes 6 and 10). These are most likely explained by differential glycosylation as shown below. Whereas clones producing the TMD0L0 region alone were isolated (Fig. 2D, lane 2), we only detected TMD0 if it was combined with ΔMRP2 (Fig. 2E, lane 6) or L0ΔMRP2 (Fig.2E, lane 10). The glycosylation sites present in MRP2 have not been mapped but, like in MRP1 (35Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Leslie E.M. Gerlach J.H. Grant C.E. Deely R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23623-23630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), N-glycosylation sequences are present in the N terminus (amino acids 7 and 12) and between putative transmembrane segments 12 and 13 (amino acid 1011). To investigate whether the various fragments of MRP2 were glycosylated, cells were grown in the presence of tunicamycin, a drug preventing N-linked glycosylation. As expected, full-length MRP2 was glycosylated as illustrated by the appearance of a smaller band, around 150 kDa in the presence of tunicamycin (Fig.4A). L0ΔMRP2 was glycosylated both in the presence and absence of TMD0 (Fig.4, B and C). Part of ΔMRP2 was core-glycosylated if produced alone, as illustrated by the band visible just above the unglycosylated protein (Fig. 4D, lane 2). Interestingly, ΔMRP2 became fully glycosylated if co-produced with the TMD0L0polypeptide, and this glycosylation was inhibited by treatment with tunicamycin (Fig. 4D). The amounts of unglycosylated MRP2, L0ΔMRP2, and ΔMRP2 were strongly reduced compared with the glycosylated forms, suggesting that the unglycosylated proteins are rapidly degraded. Both the TMD0 and TMD0L0 fragments were also glycosylated. An increased mobility of these proteins was observed in the presence of tunicamycin (Fig. 4, E and F). For MRP2 and TMD0L0, intermediate bands were observed between the glycosylated and deglycosylated proteins aftert = 24 and 36 h (Fig. 4, A and F, lanes 3 and 4). These could either be due to proteolysis or partial deglycosylation by endogenous endoglycosidases. The subcellular localization of the various MRP2 mutants was determined by indirect immunofluorescence using confocal laser-scanning microscopy. The proteins were detected with the same mAbs as used in the Western blot experiments. Cells were analyzed at the horizontal plane (x/y) and at the plane perpendicular to the monolayer (x/z). The apically localized wild-type MRP2 was used as a control in these experiments (Fig.5A). The results for ΔMRP2 can be summarized as follows: (i) ΔMRP2 alone was present in low concentrations in an intracellular compartment, probably the endoplasmic reticulum, but we have not verified this (Fig.5B). (ii) ΔMRP2 in cells co-expressing TMD0L0 together with ΔMRP2 was mainly present in the apical membrane (Fig. 5C). A substantial amount of the TMD0L0 protein was localized intracellularly. Some protein, however, was also detected in the apical membrane. (iii) ΔMRP2 was detected intracellularly in cells co-expressing ΔMRP2 and TMD0 (data not shown). (iv) The TMD0L0 polypeptide alone was localized in an intracellular compartment (Fig. 5D). Since we previously found that L0ΔMRP1 was properly routed to the lateral membrane, we investigated whether L0ΔMRP2 similarly routed to the apical membrane. The results shown in Fig. 6 document the following. (i) The L0ΔMRP2 protein produced alone is localized intracellularly (Fig. 6A). (ii) In cells co-expressing L0ΔMRP2 and TMD0, the L0ΔMRP2 protein was in the apical membrane, although some intracellular staining was also observed (Fig. 6C). In these cells, we could not visualize the TMD0 polypeptide with mAb 12CA5 in immunofluorescence experiments. Full-length, HA-tagged MRP2 was also not detectable by immunofluorescence, although the protein was functional and visualized in Western blots with mAb 12CA5 (data not shown). The HA epitope is probably not accessible in these proteins, since we also did not succeed in detecting it with other anti-HA mAb or polyclonal antibodies using different fixation methods. (iii) In cells co-expressing L0ΔMRP2 and TMD0L0, both proteins were detected intracellularly (Fig. 6B). Taken together, these data suggest that the TMD0 and TMD0L0 polypeptides interact with L0ΔMRP2 and ΔMRP2, respectively, to form a protein routed to the apical membrane. Since L0-MRP2 is glycosylated, it most likely is not a folding mutant associated with the endoplasmic reticulum. To analyze whether the protein was associated with endosomes or the Golgi apparatus, we performed co-localization studies with fluorescently labeled marker proteins. As marker for the Golgi apparatus, we used a fusion protein consisting of ECFP and a sequence encoding the N-terminal 81 amino acids of human β-1,4-galactosyltransferase (pECFP-Golgi) (36Llopis J. McCaffery J.M. Miyawaki A. Farquhar M.G. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6803-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). As a marker for endosomes, we used the pECFP-Endo vector, which encodes a fusion protein between ECFP and the human RhoB GTPase (37Adamson P. Paterson H.F. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Stable MDCKII-MRP2 and MDCKII-L0ΔMRP2 cells were transiently transfected with the pECFP constructs. The co-localization of proteins in these assays resulted in a yellow signal after merging the ECFP signal (shown in green in Fig.7, left panels) with the signal obtained with mAb M2III-6 (shown inred, middle panels). No overlap was detected between MRP2 and the ECFP-Golgi protein, whereas some overlap was found between MRP2 and the ECFP-Endo protein (Fig. 7, Aand B, right panels). Like MRP2, L0ΔMRP2 was not co-localizing with the ECFP-Golgi marker (Fig. 7C), but overlap was found in the merge with the pECFP-Endo marker (Fig. 7D), suggesting that at least part of this protein is associated with endosomes. To verify whether the co-produced proteins detected in the apical membrane were properly folded, we tested their biological activity. We have shown that wild-type MRP2 is able to transport theVinca alkaloid [3H]vinblastine to the apical side of a cell monolayer (11Evers R. de Haas M. Sparidans R. Beijnen J. Wielinga P.R. Lankelma J. Borst P. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 83: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 30Evers R. Kool M. van Deemter L. Janssen H. Calafat J. Oomen L.C.J.M. Paulusma C.C. Oude Elferink R.P.J. Baas F. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1310-1319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using the same assay conditions, we analyzed the transport of vinblastine by the MDCKII-derived cell lines expressing the various regions of MRP2. Fig.8A shows that wild-type MDCKII cells transported little vinblastine under the experimental conditions employed, whereas MDCKII-MRP2 cells demonstrated a clearly increased transport of vinblastine to the apical side of the cell monolayer. Neither in MDCKII-L0ΔMRP2 nor in MDCKII-ΔMRP2 cells was a significantly increased transport rate detected to either side of the monolayer. In contrast, transport to the apical side of the monolayer was clearly increased in cells co-expressing ΔMRP2 and TMD0L0 or co-expressing L0ΔMRP2 and TMD0, respectively (Fig. 8, B and C, right versus left panels). An important characteristic of MRP2 is its ability to transport certain organic anions. A model substrate to measure MRP-mediated transport of an organic anion from intact cells is DNP-GS. DNP-GS is hydrophilic and therefore only slowly diffuses over the plasma membrane. To measure transport of this compound, cells are incubated with the hydrophobic precursor [14C]CDNB. This compound rapidly diffuses across membranes and is conjugated intracellularly to glutathione by glutathione S-transferases. The [14C]DNP-GS formed can only leave the cells via an active transporter (38Oude Elferink R.P.J. Bakker C.T.M. Jansen P.L.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 759-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As shown before, apical DNP-GS transport by MDCKII-MRP2 monolayers was 3.2-fold higher than in the wild type cells (Table I). In MDCKII-L0ΔMRP2 monolayers, the apical transport activity was 1.8-fold lower than in wild-type cells. This might be due to a down-regulation of the endogenous canine MRP2 that is present in these cells (11Evers R. de Haas M. Sparidans R. Beijnen J. Wielinga P.R. Lankelma J. Borst P. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 83: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Basolateral transport of DNP-GS was somewhat variable among the different clones, probably due to variation in expression levels of endogenous basolaterally localized organic anion transporters. This variation did not correlate with the expression of MRP2 variants. In two clones tested, co-expression of ΔMRP2 with TMD0L0resulted in a 1.8–2.5-fold higher apical transport of DNP-GS than in cells containing ΔMRP2 alone. Co-expression of L0ΔMRP2 with TMD0L0 did not result in an increased transport to the apical side of the monolayer. In contrast, apical transport was increased 2.5-fold in the cells containing both L0ΔMRP2 and TMD0, compared with cells producing L0ΔMRP2 alone.Table ITransport into the medium, intracellular accumulation, and total synthesis of [14C]DNP-GS by MDCKII-derived monolayers after incubation for 20 min with [14C]CDNBCell lineDNP-GS transport (in pmoles per monolayer)ApicalBasalIntracellularTotalpmol/monolayerMDCKII423 ± 38706 ± 18575 ± 741704MRP21377 ± 110436 ± 603432156ΔMRP2375 ± 9701 ± 86342 ± 61418ΔMRP2 + TMD0L0# 12670 ± 47832 ± 9242 ± 171744ΔMRP2 + TMD0L0# 3922 ± 147800 ± 164304 ± 432026L0ΔMRP2239 ± 25904 ± 57449 ± 601592L0ΔMRP2 + TMD0L0# 12164 ± 11925 ± 180362 ± 161451L0ΔMRP2 + TMD0L0# 21216 ± 67730 ± 185490 ± 1121436L0ΔMRP2 + TMD0# 10592 ± 69507 ± 111175 ± 71274 Open table in a new tab Taken together, these data show a correlation between the presence of L0ΔMRP2 plus TMD0 and ΔMRP2 plus TMD0L0, respectively, in the apical membrane and transport of both vinblastine and DNP-GS. The experiments shown above indicate that L0ΔMRP2 did not transport drugs into the medium in MDCKII cells and was localized intracellularly. To investigate whether L0ΔMRP2 is able to transport leukotriene C4, a typical substrate for MRP2, we expressed MRP2 and L0ΔMRP2 in baculovirus-infected insect (Sf9) cells. Fig. 9A shows that we obtained similar levels of MRP2 and L0ΔMRP2 in membrane vesicles prepared from these cells. To examine the functionality of L0ΔMRP2, ATP-dependent uptake of LTC4 was determined in isolated membrane vesicles. The apparent transport rate of L0ΔMRP2 for LTC4(240 nm) was ∼50% of the transport of wild-type MRP2 (Fig.9B). These transport rates were corrected for the differences in protein levels and for the transport-competent inside-out vesicles content, as determined by measuring active Ca2+ uptake. The transport rate of L0ΔMRP2, measured in the presence of higher concentrations of LTC4 (720 nm) for 30 s, was also found to be about 50% of wild type MRP2, indicating that deletion of the TMD0 region did not cause a major change in the apparent Km of L0ΔMRP2 for LTC4. By co-expressing various mutants of MRP2 in polarized MDCKII cells, we searched for regions that are important for routing of MRP2 to the apical plasma membrane. In MDCKII cells, the L0ΔMRP2 protein was localized intracellularly and mainly associated with endosomes. Uptake experiments with L0ΔMRP2-containing vesicles that were isolated from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells demonstrated that this mutant protein is in principle functional, since it mediated the transport of the MRP2 substrate LTC4. Co-expression in MDCKII cells of the N-terminal fragments TMD0L0 and TMD0 with the core fragments ΔMRP2 and L0ΔMRP2, respectively, resulted in routing to the apical plasma membrane. Co-produced mutants localized in the apical membrane are functional, since they transport both the Vinca alkaloid vinblastine and the organic anion DNP-GS. This strongly suggests that the co-produced MRP2 fragments are properly folded and that routing is most likely determined by the same signals that are functional in wild-type MRP2. Our data suggest that the complete TMD0L0 region of MRP2 is required for routing, although it is also possible that TMD0L0 is required to remain stably localized in the apical membrane. These findings are in contrast to our previous experiments with MRP1 mutants, which showed that the TMD0 region of MRP1 is not required for routing to the lateral membrane (27Bakos E. Evers R. Szacacs G. Tusnady G.E. Welker E. Szabo K. de Haas M. van Deemer L. Borst P. Varadi A. Sakardi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32167-321675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 28Bakos E. Evers R. Calenda G. Tusnady G.E. Szakacs G. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4451-4461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cells producing ΔMRP2 and TMD0L0, only a fraction of the latter protein was detectable in the apical membrane, whereas all ΔMRP2 was in the apical membrane. We hypothesize that the TMD0L0 region is required for the sorting of ΔMRP2 from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, where it becomes glycosylated. The TMD0L0 protein probably is expressed in molar excess in our cells, resulting in routing of only those TMD0L0 molecules that interact with ΔMRP2. This hypothesis is in line with the observation that TMD0L0 in the absence of ΔMRP2 is localized intracellularly. The ΔMRP2 protein in the absence of TMD0L0 is most likely degraded by proteasomes, since the protein was only detectable at very low concentrations and was only core-glycosylated. Moreover, treatment with two different proteasome inhibitors resulted in a substantially increased amount of the protein. Co-expression with TMD0L0 clearly increased the stability of ΔMRP2 and resulted in glycosylation. These findings are not specific for ΔMRP2, since we found the same in cells containing ΔMRP1 and its N-terminal TMD0L0fragment. 2G. Calenda and R. Evers, unpublished data. We do not know at present whether ΔMRP2 is a misfolded protein and therefore recognized by the quality control system of the cell, resulting in proteasome-mediated degradation, or whether this molecule lacks signals that are required for sorting from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. Such signals should then be present in L0, since the L0ΔMRP2 protein is glycosylated and functional, at leastin vitro. Remarkably, the L0ΔMRP2 mutant was glycosylated in the absence of TMD0 but was not detected in the plasma membrane. L0ΔMRP2 was in part co-localizing with the ECFP-Endo and not with the ECFP-Golgi protein. An interesting question is whether L0ΔMRP2 is routed from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane and subsequently rapidly endocytosed or directly sorted from the Golgi to endosomes. The implication of the former hypothesis is that TMD0 is required for MRP2 to remain stably localized in the apical membrane. Alternatively, it is tempting to speculate that TMD0 is required for routing of L0ΔMRP2 and that this region contains an apical routing signal. At steady state, however, we see only intracellular staining of the TMD0L0 protein produced alone. This indicates that a possible routing signal only functions in the context of the complete molecule. It is possible that MRP2 contains multiple signals required for routing. That routing signals in polytopic apically localized transporters may be complex is illustrated by recent experiments in which the routing behavior of chimeric proteins containing part of the Na/K-ATPase α-subunit (basolateral localization) and the H,K-ATPase α-subunit (apical localization) was studied (39Dunbar L.A. Aronson P. Caplan M.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Both the extracellular and intracellular loops flanking transmembrane segment four of the H,K-ATPase, but not transmembrane four itself, were sufficient to redirect the normally basolaterally localized Na,K-ATPase to the apical membrane. Following a similar approach for MRP1 and MRP2 may be difficult, since most of the chimeric molecules we analyzed remained associated with the endoplasmic reticulum. 3R. Evers and P. Borst, unpublished observations. Another ATP binding cassette transporter that shows some structural homology to MRPs is the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The C terminus of CFTR contains sequences important for routing to the apical membrane. The last three C-terminal amino acids form a PDZ-binding motif that interacts with proteins containing PDZ domains (40Moyer B.D. Duhaime M. Shaw C. Denton J. Reynolds D. Karlson K.H. Pfeiffer J.

As one of the PDZ domain-containing proteins, PDZK1 (also called CAP1), which binds to CFTR, also interacts with the C terminus of MRP2 (43Milewski M.I. Mickle J.E. Forrest J.K. Stafford D.M. Moyer B.D. Cheng J. Guggino W.B. Stanton B.A. Cutting G.R. J. Cell Science. 2001; 114: 719-726PubMed Google Scholar), it has been speculated that PDZ domain-containing proteins play a role in the localization of MRP2 (45Harris M.J. Kuwano M. Webb M. Board P.G.

Although we formally cannot exclude the possibility that sequences present in the C-terminal tail of MRP2 play an additional role in routing, the last three amino acids are not required in the MDCKII cell line we use, since an MRP2 mutant lacking these last three amino acids localizes to the apical membrane and is functional. 4S.

https://openalex.org/W2093390596,"Using a murine model of demyelinating disease, we demonstrate that remyelination of spinal cord axons is promoted by antibodies to glatiramer acetate (GA, Copolymer-1, Copaxone), a therapeutic agent for multiple sclerosis (MS). Glatiramer acetate is a mixture of randomly synthesized peptides that induces both T cell activation and antibody production in all treated individuals. These observations prompted us to compare the independent effects of adoptively transferred GA-reactive T cells and antibodies in mice with chronic inflammatory demyelination induced by Theiler's virus. Transferred T cells had no effect on lesion load or the extent of remyelination. Purified polyclonal GA antibodies also did not alter lesion load, which suggests that neither GA T cells or antibodies were pathogenic. On the contrary, GA antibodies enhanced the normally low level of remyelination in chronic lesions. The antibodies, which were primarily immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 and IgG2, cross-reacted with oligodendrocytes, perivascular infiltrating cells, astrocytes, and neurons in spinal cord sections. In glial cultures they bound subsets of early lineage oligodendrocytes and microglia. Thus, several mechanisms may have contributed to the promotion of remyelination. These results support the hypothesis that the antibody response in GA-treated patients is beneficial by facilitating repair of demyelinated lesions."
https://openalex.org/W1876377491,"The T-ALL cell lines CCRF-CEM and Jurkat were studied for their sensitivity toward apoptosis induced by tetrocarcin-A (TC-A), an antibacterial and antitumor agent isolated from the actinomycete Micromonospora. This substance promoted cell death via a mitochondrial signaling pathway, that is, by activation of Bid and Bax, loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, release of cytochrome c, and activation of effector caspases, even under conditions of Bcl-2 overexpression. Furthermore, sensitivity to TC-A was not dependent on expression of wild-type caspase-8. In contrast, this apoptotic pathway was inhibited markedly by pretreatment of cells with cycloheximide, an inhibitor of de novo protein synthesis. cDNA microarray chip analysis revealed that TC-A induced a significant up-regulation of members of the heat shock protein family known to be involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress-induced apoptotic program. The activation of caspase-12, the central inducer caspase involved in ER-stress by TC-A treatment, is in concordance with this result. These results show that, in T-ALL cells, TC-A induces an apoptotic machinery via mitochondrial and ER signaling, which is not inhibited by aberrant expression/function of important regulators of death receptor- and drug-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1993633711,"Hepatitis D virus (HDV) encodes two proteins, the 24-kDa small delta antigen (S-HDAg) and 27-kDa large delta antigen (L-HDAg) in its single open reading frame. Both of them had been identified as nuclear phosphoproteins. Moreover, the phosphorylated form of S-HDAg was shown to be important for HDV replication. However, the kinase responsible for S-HDAg phosphorylation remains unknown. Therefore, we employed an in-gel kinase assay to search candidate kinases and indeed identified a kinase with a molecular mass of about 68 kDa. Much evidence demonstrated this kinase to be the double-stranded RNA-activated kinase, PKR. The immunoprecipitated endogenous PKR was sufficient to catalyze S-HDAg phosphorylation, and the kinase activity disappeared in the PKR-depleted cell lysate. The S-HDAg and PKR could be co-immunoprecipitated together, and both of them co-located in the nucleolus. The LC/MS/MS analysis revealed that the serine 177, serine 180, and threonine 182 of S-HDAg were phosphorylated by PKR in vitro. This result was consistent with previous phosphoamino acid analysis indicating that serine and threonine were phosphorylation targets in S-HDAg. Furthermore, serine 177 was also shown to be the predominant phosphorylation site for S-HDAg purified the from cell line. In dominant negative PKR-transfected cells, the level of phosphorylated S-HDAg was suppressed, but replication of HDV was enhanced.

Upon superinfection or co-infection with hepatitis B virus, HDV may cause fulminant hepatitis and progressive chronic liver disease (6Arico S. Aragona M. Rizzetto M. Caredda F. Zanetti A.

Wells F.V. Gerin J.L. Robertson H.D. Science. 1989; 243: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). HDV contains the ribozyme domains for self-cleavage and self-ligation in both genomic and antigenomic strands of RNA (10Kuo M.Y. Sharmeen L. Dinter-Gottlieb G. Taylor J. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 4439-4444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wu H.N. Lin Y.J. Lin F.P. Makino S. Chang M.F. Lai M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1831-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Similar to viroid replication, HDV undergoes a double rolling circle scheme. However, different from viroids, HDV encodes two proteins translated from the same mRNA, small delta antigen (S-HDAg) and large delta antigen (L-HDAg) (12Makino S. Chang M.F. Shieh C.K. Kamahora T.

Virology. 1990; 178: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This viral mRNA is responsible for S-HDAg production. L-HDAg is translated from the same open reading frame through a specific RNA editing process by which the UAG amber termination codon of S-HDAg was converted to UGG tryptophan codon and an additional 19 amino acids were made (14Casey J.L.

Nature. 1996; 380: 454-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). This adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing is catalyzed by double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminase (15Polson A.G. Bass B.L.

Biol. 1998; 18: 1919-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although both forms of delta antigens (HDAg) share an identical N-terminal 194 amino acids, their functions are quite different. The S-HDAg is essential for viral replication, whereas L-HDAg inhibits replication and is required for viral assembly (17Kuo M.Y. Chao M. Taylor J. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1945-1950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chang F.L. Chen P.J., Tu, S.J. Wang C.J. Chen D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

There are several functional domains in HDAg that are responsible for different activities. The N terminus nuclear localization signal and the middle arginine-rich motif mediate HDV RNA transport (20Chang M.F. Chang S.C. Chang C.I., Wu, K. Kang H.Y. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6019-6027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Chang M.F. Sun C.Y. Chen C.J. Chang S.C. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2529-2536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lee C.Z. Lin J.H. Chao M. McKnight K. Lai M.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2221-2227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of the nuclear localization signal or arginine-rich motif leads to the accumulation of HDV RNA in the cytoplasm. The coiled-coil sequence between amino acids 31 and 52 is the delta antigen dimerization signal (23Xia Y.P. Lai M.M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6641-6648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Wang J.G. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 446-454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the nuclear export signal located in the C-terminal domain of L-HDAg is involved in delta antigen exportation to cytoplasm and viral assembly (25Lee C.H. Chang S.C., Wu, C.H. Chang M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8142-8148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Besides these functional motifs, protein modifications also play important roles in the HDV life cycle. The isoprenylation of L-HDAg has been shown to be required for viral assembly (26Glenn J.S. Watson J.A. Havel C.M. White J.M. Science. 1992; 256: 1331-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Both forms of HDAg are phosphorylated when they expressed in mammalian cells and infectious hosts (27Hwang S.B. Lee C.Z. Lai M.M. Virology. 1992; 190: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 28Chen P.J., Wu, H.L. Wang C.J. Chia J.H. Chen D.S. J Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 1997; 12: S188-S192Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Previous phosphoamino acid analysis indicated that L-HDAg was phosphorylated at the serine residue and S-HDAg was phosphorylated at both serine and threonine residues (29Chang M.F. Baker S.C. Soe L.H. Kamahora T. Keck J.G. Makino S. Govindarajan S. Lai M.M. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2403-2410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Mu J.J., Wu, H.L. Chiang B.L. Chang R.P. Chen D.S. Chen P.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 10540-10545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis in conserved serine and threonine residues of S-HDAg found that substitution of serine 177 by alanine reduced HDV genomic RNA accumulation (31Yeh T.S., Lo, S.J. Chen P.J. Lee Y.H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6190-6198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Mu J.J. Chen D.S. Chen P.J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 9087-9095Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This result implied the phosphorylation of S-HDAg was probably related to viral replication. To study the underlying mechanism of how delta antigen phosphorylation affects HDV replication, we tried to identify the exact phosphorylation residues and the responsible cellular kinase. By the in-gel kinase assay and subsequent characterization, we found PKR to be the kinase that associated with and subsequently phosphorylated S-HDAg. Furthermore, by the ion trap tandem mass spectrometry, the PKR-phosphorylated residues were identified at serine 177, serine 180, and threonine 182 in vitro. Finally, we purified the S-HDAg from a S-HDAg-expressing stable cell line and identified serine 177 as the major phosphorylation residue. In vivo, the level of S-HDAg phosphorylation was reduced by overexpressed dominant negative PKR. Besides these biochemical observations, we further found that HDV replication was influenced by PKR activity. This result suggested that PKR participates in the phosphorylation of S-HDAg in vivo and influences HDV replication. Plasmid pcDNA3.1/HDV-2G contains a tandem dimer of the full-length HDV cDNA inserted at theXbaI site of the vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). It transcribes genomic RNA template for replication assay. Plasmid pcDNA3.1/HDV-2AG contains HDV cDNA dimer in the opposite orientation and provides antigenomic RNA for replication. Other HDV-related plasmids used in this experiment were described previously (30Mu J.J., Wu, H.L. Chiang B.L. Chang R.P. Chen D.S. Chen P.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 10540-10545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Mu J.J. Chen D.S. Chen P.J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 9087-9095Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The wild type PKR (PKR-WT) and two dominant negative mutants (PKR-Δ6 and PKR-K296R) (33Craig A.W. Cosentino G.P. Donze O. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24526-24533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) were also subcloned into pcDNA3.1 vector. The N1 cell line was established from HepG2 cell transformed with a trimeric HDV cDNA. HDV RNA replicates constitutively in N1 cells and expresses both small and large delta antigens (34Chen P.J. Kuo M.Y. Chen M.L., Tu, S.J. Chiu M.N., Wu, H.L. Hsu H.C. Chen D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5253-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). An S-HDAg-expressing stable cell line, S3-HDAg, was constructed as described previously except that the target cell line is HeLa S3 rather than HuH-7 (35Wang H.W., Wu, H.L. Chen D.S. Chen P.J. Virology. 1997; 239: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The expression of S-HDAg in this cell line was confirmed by Western blotting. All of the cell lines used in this report were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. S3-HDAg stable cell line was maintained in DMEM medium containing 1.4 μg/μl G418 (Promega). To express the small delta antigen, a fragment containing the S-HDAg reading frame was ligated into the BamHI cloning site of pET-15a. The constructed pET-15a-SHDAg was transformed to BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL competent cells (Stratagene). A single colony was picked and cultured in 10 ml of LB broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol overnight. The bacteria were spun down and transferred to 1 liter of LB broth containing 150 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. When the A600 reached 0.6, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm and cultured for an additional 3 h. The bacteria were pelleted down and resuspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2, 2% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and 50 μg/ml DNase). The soluble fraction and inclusion body were separated by centrifugation at 3000 ×g for 30 min. The recombinant S-HDAg was located in inclusion body. S-HDAg in the inclusion body was further purification by following the procedure described in Ref. 36Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. I. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 6.3.1-6.3.8Google Scholar, except the washing solution containing 2 m urea. This protocol followed Ref. 37Coligan J.E.

Briefly, HeLa S3 cells (about 2 × 107) were lysed by 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm glycerophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1% Triton X-100) and cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min. This lysate was used for the in-gel kinase assay and immunoprecipitation/in vitro kinase assay. For the in-gel kinase assay, purified recombinant S-HDAg was included in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. After electrophoresis, the gel was sequentially immersed in wash, equilibrium, denaturation, and renaturation buffers. Finally, the gel was equilibrated in 200 ml of kinase assay buffer (15 mmHEPES, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mmMgCl2) for 30 min then incubated in 10 ml of kinase buffer containing 50 μm ATP and 20 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. After reaction, the gel was soaked in 5% trichloacetic acid solution to remove nonincorporated [γ-32P]ATP. The gel was dried on a 3MM filter and used for autoradiography. To immunoprecipitate PKR for in-gel kinase and in vitro kinase assays, protein G-agarose conjugated with 1 μg/μl mouse anti-human PKR (Transduction Laboratories) was added to the HeLa S3 cell lysate (500 μg). The same amount of protein G-agarose-conjugated mouse anti-rat PKR serum (Transduction Laboratories) and mouse normal serum (Jackson) were used as negative controls. The PKR also could be precipitated by 20 μl of poly(I:C)-agarose (Amersham Biosciences). For the in-gel kinase assay, the bound PKR was eluted by 20 μl of 8m urea and then subjected to electrophoresis. For thein vitro kinase assay, the PKR-bound agarose was washed by 0.5 ml of PKR kinase buffer (15 mm HEPES, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, and 50 μm ATP) twice. Four micrograms of recombinant S-HDAg and kinase assay buffer containing 20 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP were added to the washed agarose in a final volume of 30 μl and then incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. After reaction, an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sampling buffer was added, and then the mixture was boiled for 10 min. This sample was subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried on a 3MM filter and used for autoradiography. An S3-HDAg or N1-stable cell line was cultured in six-well plates. Before immunofluorescence staining, the cells were treated with 1000 units/ml interferon-α (Calbiochem) for 18 h and then fixed with 2.5% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature. After 1% Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline soaking, cells were stained with human anti-HDAg serum and mouse anti-human PKR serum (Transduction Laboratories). After further staining by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-human IgG or rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson), the S-HDAg and PKR localization was monitored by a confocal spectral microscope (Leica TCS SP2) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Since the S-HDAg is a nucleoprotein, a procedure modified from Dignam’s nuclear extraction protocol was used to remove the cytoplasmic protein to facilitate its purification (38Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar, 39Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Briefly, the S3-HDAg cells (about 1 × 109) were resuspended in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and disrupted by 40 strokes of a Kontes Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was spun for 10 min at 1000 × g, the supernatant was completely removed, and then the nuclei were harvested by further centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 20 min. Nuclear pellet was homogenized in 2.5 ml of buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.42 mNaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by 10 strokes of the Kontes Dounce homogenizer (B type pestle) and stirred at 4 °C for 30 min. The crude nuclear extract was centrifuged for 30 min at 25,000 × g. The remaining nuclear debris was completely lysed by 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 2% Triton X-100. This lysate was further disrupted by a homogenizer until the viscosity disappeared. After 25,000 × g, 30-min centrifugation, the S-HDAg was located in the supernatant. This partially purified S-HDAg was further purified by the strong cationic column or anti-HDAg affinity column. In the strong cationic column purification protocol, the 20HS column (PerSeptive Biosystem; BIOCAD) was pre-equilibrated by five column volumes of equilibrium buffer (35 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 5 mm NaCl). After loading a 100-mg protein sample, the column was prewashed by 20 column volumes of washing buffer (35 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl). The binding protein was eluted in a stepwise manner with different NaCl concentrations from 0.5 to 2.5 m. The NaCl concentration was increased by 0.25 m in each step. Finally, the column was cleaned by a cleaning solution (35 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and 3 m NaCl). For preparing the anti-HDAg affinity column, the anti-HDAg monoclonal antibody (30Mu J.J., Wu, H.L. Chiang B.L. Chang R.P. Chen D.S. Chen P.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 10540-10545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was mixed with Poros protein G beads (PerSeptive Biosystem; BIOCAD) at a concentration about 2 mg of antibody/ml of wet beads. After incubation at room temperature for 1 h, the beads were washed with 10 volumes of 0.2 m sodium borate. The washed beads were resuspended in 10 bead volumes of 0.2m sodium borate and then mixed with methylpimelimidate to bring the final concentration to 20 mm. After coupling at room temperature for 30 min, the reaction was stopped by 0.2m ethanolamine. The antibody-coupled beads could be packaged into columns by following the manufacturer's protocol. The anti-HDAg affinity column purification protocol is similar to a cationic column except that the elution step was substituted by 20-column volumes of glycine buffer (0.1 m glycine, 0.3m MgCl2). The eluted S-HDAg-containing fraction was directly analyzed by Western blotting and concentrated by Centricon Plus-20 centrifugal filter device (Millipore Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The concentrated S-HDAg was subjected to SDS-PAGE. S-HDAg was cut off from the gel after Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and subjected to in-gel digestion and LC/MS/MS analysis (see blow). To detect the S-HDAg expression in S3-SHDAg cell, cells (about 1 × 107) were lysed in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitor cocktails). For Western blot analysis, about 50 μg of the protein was mixed with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sampling buffer, boiled for 10 min, and then subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. After electrotransfer, the expressed S-HDAg and PKR were monitored by anti-HDAg serum and anti-human PKR serum (Transduction Laboratories) using the ECL Western detection Kit (AmershamBiosciences). The preparation of tryptic digest was carried out based on the method described previously (40Tsay Y.G. Wang Y.H. Chiu C.M. Shen B.J. Lee S.C. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, S-HDAg polypeptide in the gel was reduced by 2% mercaptoethanol, 25 mmNH4HCO3, and then modified by 5% 4-vinylpyridine in 25 mmNH4HCO3. The pyridylethylated protein was incubated with 1 μg/ml of modified trypsin (Promega) at 37 °C overnight. The tryptic digest was divided into three equal aliquots before storage at −20 °C. The tryptic digest was analyzed for identification of phosphorylated amino acid residues by LC/MS/MS. All of the LC/MS/MS experiments were performed on an LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan) coupled on an in-line ABI 1400 high pressure liquid chromatograph (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) equipped with a 150 × 0.5-mm PE Brownlee C18 column (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The sample was typically loaded in 5% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. The gradient consisted of 5–30% acetronitrile in 10 min and subsequent 30–65% acetronitrile in 50 min. The first aliquot was analyzed by LC/MS/MS at an automatic mode. The spectra of eluate were collected as successive sets of three different scans: MS, ZOOM, and MS2 scans. The MS scan defined the ion composition at an m/z range of 395–1605; the ZOOM scan examined the isotype patterns of the most intense ion in the MS scan; and the MS2 scan acquired the mass spectrum of the most intense ion upon collision-induced dissociation. The raw data were subjected to automatic interpretation by Sequest Brower software (Finnigan). The enzyme was not specified during the search, which increased the confidence of identification. The matched peptides had proper cleavage sites. A 105.14-Da mass was assigned to all lysine residues that were alkylated in all experiments. The procedure for identification of phosphopeptides by selected ion chromatogram analysis was described in detail previously (40Tsay Y.G. Wang Y.H. Chiu C.M. Shen B.J. Lee S.C. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, the selected ion chromatograms were graphed for Sequest-identified peptides and their hypothetical phosphopeptides to determine their retention time. A hypothetical phosphopeptide was considered as putative phosphopeptides only if its retention time was within 5 min of that of the corresponding unmodified peptide. The identities of these putative peptides were verified by LC/MS/MS in a mass-dependent mode. Only the ions with appropriate m/z values were selected for ZOOM and MS2 scan. The acquired collision-induced dissociation spectra were analyzed by Sequest as well as direct inspection. In co-transfection experiments, HDV cDNA-expressing plasmid (1 μg) and PKR-expressing plasmid (4 μg) were diluted in 250 μl of OPTI-MEM reduced serum medium (Invitrogen). Ten microliters of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) was diluted in the same medium then mixed with previously prepared plasmid at room temperature for 20 min. Before transfection, 293T or HuH-7 cells (2.4 × 105cells/well) were replaced by 2 ml of serum-free DMEM in the six-well plate and then incubated with the LipofectAMINE 2000-plasmid complex for 6 h. Four days after transfection, total RNA and protein were harvested for HDV RNA and S-HDAg analysis by Northern or Western blot (4Wang H.W. Chen P.J. Lee C.Z., Wu, H.L. Chen D.S. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6363-6371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For ribonucleoprotein transfection, the procedure was modified from a previous report (41Sheu G.T. Lai M.M. Virology. 2000; 278: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). COS7 cells were seeded on a six-well plate (2.4 × 105 cell/well) and cultured in a 37 °C incubator overnight. Before transfection, culture medium was replaced by fresh 5% fetal calf serum-DMEM for 4 h. The in vitro transcribed HDV dimeric genomic RNA (2 μg) was mixed with recombinant S-HDAg (0.4 μg) in a final volume of 20 μl in 10 mm HEPES buffer at room temperature for 10 min. Ten microliters ofN-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N, N, N-trimethylammonium methyl sulfate (DOTAP) transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was diluted in 23 μl of 10 mm HEPES buffer for 15 min and then mixed with the previous RNA-protein complex for another 15 min. The COS7 culture medium was discarded and replaced with 1 ml of 5% fetal calf serum-DMEM and DOTAP-ribonucleoprotein mixture for 16 h. Four days after transfection, total RNA and protein were harvested to detect HDV replication. The phosphorylated peptide,167FVPNLQGVPEpSPFSRTGE184, with a phosphogroup at serine 177 was synthesized (Genemed). To enhance antigenicity, eight multiple antigenic peptides were incorporated (42Lam L.L. Pau C.P. Dollard S.C. Pellett P.E. Spira T.J. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2002; 40: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The synthesized peptide (2 mg) was dissolved in 0.4 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and 0.6 ml of Freund's complete adjuvant (Invitrogen) buffer. After subcutaneous immunization four times with 2 mg of peptides, rabbit antiserum against Ser177-phosphorylated S-HDAg peptide was acquired. To deplete the nonspecific antibody in the serum that can recognize the nonphosphorylated S-HDAg, the crude rabbit antiserum was adsorbed to nonphosphorylated, recombinant small delta antigen. The Hybond-C extra (Amersham Biosciences) membrane (about 10 × 10 cm) was immersed in 20 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 6m urea buffer containing 20 mg of recombinant S-HDAg at 4 °C. After overnight incubation, the membrane was washed by 40 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.05% Tween 20 buffer three times. About 40 ml of rabbit anti-serine 177-phosphorylated S-HDAg serum was incubated with the membrane saturated by recombinant S-HDAg at 4 °C overnight. The supernatant was harvested and checked for its specificity by Western blotting. The adsorption procedure was repeated until the serum did not recognize the nonphosphorylated recombinant S-HDAg. The in vivo orthophosphate labeling experiment revealed that both of the S-HDAg and L-HDAg are phosphorylated proteins (27Hwang S.B. Lee C.Z. Lai M.M. Virology. 1992; 190: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To date, the kinase responsible for their phosphorylation has yet to be characterized. The known HDAg-interacting proteins, such as the delta antigen interaction protein A (43Brazas R. Ganem D. Science. 1996; 274: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and nucleolar phosphoprotein B23 (44Huang W.H. Yung B.Y. Syu W.J. Lee Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25166-25175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), have no kinase activities. The yeast two-hybrid system and protein fraction method had been tried when searching for HDAg-associated kinase without success in our laboratory. Therefore, we used the in-gel kinase assay system to examine the candidate kinase for S-HDAg phosphorylation. The total HeLa S3 cell lysate was separated in a SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing recombinant S-HDAg (rS-HDAg). After electrophoresis and protein renaturing, the gel was incubated in a kinase buffer with [γ-32P]ATP. A single major band of ∼68 kDa was only specifically found in the rS-HDAg-containing gel (Fig.1, left panel) but not in the control gel without any protein incorporated (Fig. 1,right panel). Besides, this ∼68-kDa signal was not detected in the gel containing total Escherichia coliprotein (the E. coli was transformed by vector only) as substrate in the in-gel kinase assay (data not shown). Depending on the amount of loaded HeLa S3 cell lysate (Fig. 1,left panel, 20, 10, and 2 μl), the ∼68-kDa phosphorylation signal decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Other faint bands around 68 kDa are nonspecific signals. They were also present in the blank gel (right panel). These might be other nonspecific kinase from crude total cell lysate. By previous in-gel kinase assay, we found a 68-kDa protein able to phosphorylate S-HDAg. To purify and identify this kinase, the total cellular proteins of HeLa S3 cell were resolved on a cationic exchange column. Under the NaCl stepwise elution procedure, the crude cell lysate was fractionated, and t"

Moreover, such structures within the viral genome might be vulnerable to attack by therapeutic strategies. hepatitis C virus nucleotide(s) internal ribosome entry site precursor tRNA hepatitis B virus Hepatitis C virus (HCV)1is a human pathogen causing chronic liver disease in 170 million people worldwide. The virus is classified within the familyFlaviviridae (1Houghton M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.N. Howley P.N. Fields' Virology. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 1035-1057Google Scholar). The RNA genome is single-stranded and functions as the sole mRNA species for translation (1Houghton M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.N. Howley P.N. Fields' Virology. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 1035-1057Google Scholar) (Fig.1A). It comprises a 5′-untranslated region, which functions as an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) (2Tsukiyama-Kohara K. Iizuka N. Kohara M. Nomoto A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1476-1483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a long open reading frame, which encodes a polyprotein precursor of about 3010 amino acids, that is cleaved into structural (core, envelope 1, envelope 2, and p7) and nonstructural (NS-2, NS-3, NS-4, and NS-5) proteins (3Houghton M. Selby M. Weiner A. Choo Q.L. Curr. Stud. Hematol. Blood Transfus. 1994; : 1-11PubMed Google Scholar), followed by a 3′-noncoding region (4Han J.H. Shyamala V. Richman K.H. Brauer M.J. Irvine B. Urdea M.S. Tekamp-Olson P. Kuo G. Choo Q.L. Houghton M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1711-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Analyzing significant numbers of cDNA clones of hepatitis C virus from single isolates provides unquestionable proof that the viral genome cannot be defined by a single sequence but rather by a population of variant sequences closely related to one another (5Martell M. Esteban J.I. Quer J. Genesca J. Weiner A. Esteban R. Guardia J. Gomez J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3225-3229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bukh J. Miller R.H. Purcell R.H. Semin.

Virol. 2000; 74: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the infected patient, a master (the most frequently represented sequence) and a spectrum of mutant sequences (diverging by up to 5%) may be isolated at any given time during chronic infection (7Cabot B. Martell M. Esteban J.I. Sauleda S. Otero T. Esteban R. Guardia J. Gomez J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This manner of organizing genetic information, which characterizes most RNA viruses, is referred to as “quasispecies” (8Domingo E. Holland J.J. Morse S.S. Evolutionary Biology of Viruses. Raven Press, New York1994: 161-184Google Scholar). It has been proven that the use of this strategy provides RNA viruses with a rapid increase of fitness while growing in cell culture conditions (9Domingo E. Holland J.J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 151-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). Many studies on genetic variability in recent years have focused on the analysis of HCV quasispecies. Clinically relevant features, such as the ability to produce chronic infections and severity of disease (including the frequency of hepatocellular carcinoma), have been related to the interplay between host influences and the array of viral variants in each infected individual (10Gomez J. Martell M. Quer J. Cabot B. Esteban J.I. J. Viral Hepat. 1999; 6: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). HCV resistance to interferon treatment (either alone or in combination with ribavirin) is one of the most important clinical implications predicted by the quasispecies model (11Poynard T. Marcellin P. Lee S.S. Niederau C. Minuk G.S. Ideo G. Bain V. Heathcote J. Zeuzem S. Trepo C. Albrecht J.

Corey L. Gretch D.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4288-4296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the necessity to seek new therapies. HCV therapeutic strategies based on ribozyme cleavage are leading candidates. It may be argued that a sequence-dependent ribozyme designed to cleave viral RNA by interaction with a motif in the viral RNA may, in fact, select for (mismatching) variants resistant to the ribozyme. However, strategies could be designed to take advantage of ribozyme capabilities to minimize the effect of virus variability. Combination therapy with multiple ribozymes directed against independent viral loci has been demonstrated to be efficient in inhibiting influenza virus replication in cell culture (15Plehn-Dujowich D. Altman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7327-7332Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Making conserved motifs within the viral genome accessible to therapy, as in the case of the HCV IRES, could be another promising strategy. The ribozyme activity of RNase P is among proposed antiviral agents (16Altman S. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). RNase P is a ubiquitous cellular endonuclease and one of the most abundant and efficient enzymes in the cell. This enzyme is a ribonucleoprotein complex that catalyzes a hydrolysis reaction to remove the leader sequence of precursor tRNA (pre-tRNA) to generate the mature tRNA (17Robertson H.D. Altman S. Smith J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5243-5251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNase P from Escherichia colicontains a catalytic RNA subunit termed M1 RNA and a single polypeptide known as C5 protein (18Altman S. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1989; 62: 1-36PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of a high concentration of Mg2+, M1 RNA itself can hydrolyze tRNA precursors in vitro (19Guerrier-Takada C. Gardiner K. Marsh T. Pace N. Altman S. Cell. 1983; 35: 849-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). Human RNase P also contains an RNA subunit, H1 RNA, but in the absence of protein factors, H1 RNA does not exhibit enzymatic activity by itself in vitro (20Bartkiewicz M. Gold H. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 488-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 21Yuan Y. Altman S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Substrate recognition by the RNase P ribozyme does not rely on sequence requirements but on structural features of the RNA substrate. Custom-designed ribo-oligonucleotides, which hybridize with the target, called external guide sequences, may provide the RNA structure that RNase P recognizes and cleaves in the hybridized complex (16Altman S. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recognition of structures instead of sequences may represent a great advantage in the fight against variable viruses, because single or even double mutations in the target may be tolerated for RNase P recognition (15Plehn-Dujowich D. Altman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7327-7332Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Also, it has already been shown that some forms of the catalytic RNA moiety from E. coliRNase P, M1 RNA (either specifically modified or in vitroselected), can be introduced into the cytoplasm of mammalian cells for the purpose of carrying out targeted cleavage of mRNA molecules (22Kilani A.F. Trang P. Hsu J.S. Kim J. Nepomuceno E. Liou K. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 14: 10611-10622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 23Liu F. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). While performing targeting experiments on HCV RNA transcripts with RNase P, we have found that, surprisingly, purified RNase P (peak activity) from HeLa cells cleaved HCV genomic RNA efficiently at two sites in the absence of external guide sequences. We report here the techniques used to prove that the cleavage is specific to human RNase P and to show where cleavage occurs. We further report that cleavage is maintained in several variant sequences, which makes RNase P cleavage an inherent property of HCV RNA. Since RNase P recognizes and cleaves tRNA-like structures, these results suggest the presence of tRNA-like structures within the viral genome. RNA transcripts used as substrates in the human RNase P assays were derived from plasmids pN(1–4728) Bluescript, which contains nt 1–4728 of hepatitis C virus under the T7 promoter, and pUC19 TyrT, which contains the sequence of the naturally occurring precursor to tRNATyr. To obtain the radioactive substrates for peak RNase P activity from HeLa cells, 1–2-μg DNA templates were transcribed in vitro (1 h at 37 °C) with [α-32P]GTP or [α-32P]NTPs followed by a 5-min treatment with RNase-free DNase I at 37 °C. We used cellulose CF11 chromatography to eliminate DNA fragments and nonincorporated nucleotides. Transcripts were then purified by gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions on 4% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea. Bands were visualized by autoradiography, excised from the gel, and eluted in buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 10 mmEDTA, pH 7.5). The concentration of radioactive transcripts was determined by calculating the amount of incorporated [α-32P]GTP based on scintillation counting. RNase P was purified from 30 g of HeLa cells according to the method of Bartkiewiczet al. (20Bartkiewicz M. Gold H. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 488-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Fractions eluted with a linear gradient of 100–350 mm from a column of DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B (bed volume, 150 ml) were tested to determine (i) enzymatic activity using pre-tRNATyr as substrate and (ii) the presence of the H1 RNA moiety from RNase P but also the presence of RNA from MRP RNase, which could co-extract with RNase P during the purification protocol. H1 RNA and MRP RNA were quantified by using Taqman technology (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and real time reverse transcriptase-PCR (Abi Prism 7700, PE Biosystems) following the protocol used for the quantification of HCV RNA from human serum or liver samples (24Martell M. Gómez J. Esteban J.I. Sauleda S. Quer J. Cabot B. Esteban R. Guardia J. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1999; 37: 327-332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). We have used one set of specific human RNase P primers (PH1–213, 5′-CCCGGCGGATGCCT-3′; PH1–274, 5′-TTGAACTCACTTCGCTGGCC-3′) and a fluorogenic probe (PH1–228, 5′-(VIC; Applied Biosystems) CTTTGCCGGAGCTTGGAACAGACTCA(6-carboxy-tetramethylrhodamine)-3′) and a second set of specific human MRP primers (MRP-90, 5′-AGAGAGTGCCACGTGCATACG-3′; MRP-210, 5′-TAACTAGAGGGAGCTGACGGATG-3′) and a fluorogenic probe labeled with a different reporter (MRP-145, 5′-(6-carboxy fluorescein)CGCCAAGAAGCGTATCCCGCTGA(6-carboxy-tetramethylrhodamine)-3′). Relative quantitation of both RNase P RNA and MRP RNA was performed by comparing the amplification results for the different fractions with those on standard curves generated from serial dilutions of total RNA extracted from HeLa cells. Using the purification protocol described above, RNase P and MRP co-extracted together but with an enrichment of RNase P versus MRP of several orders of magnitude, in all of the tested fractions (3.3 × 1011molecules of RNase P RNA versus 8.2 × 107molecules of MRP RNA, on average, in the fractions from the ammonium chloride gradient). Fractions with coincident peaks of enzymatic activity and H1 RNA amplification were pooled and concentrated, using the Millipore Ultrafree-15 centrifugal filter device, to a final volume of ∼6 ml. The concentrated fractions were subjected to linear glycerol gradient centrifugation, as described (20Bartkiewicz M. Gold H. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 488-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Relative quantitation of RNase P and MRP RNA molecules at this point confirmed previous results (i.e. enrichment of RNase P versus MRP during the purification process (6.7 × 1010 molecules of RNase P RNA versus 6.7 × 107 molecules of MRP RNA, on average, in the fractions from the glycerol gradient)). Again, fractions containing the peak of enzymatic activity were concentrated to a final volume of 0.1 ml and stored at −70 °C. Substrates for RNase P assays, SI, SII, SIII, and SIVtranscripts (1.8 nm final concentration) were preheated at 90 °C for 1 min before the addition of reaction buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgOAc, 100 mm NH4OAc) and left to cool to room temperature. Cleavage reactions were performed with 4% polyethylene glycol, 20 units of RNasin, and 2 μl of the RNase P peak activity and carried out at 30 °C in a volume of 10 μl for 30 min. Samples were subjected to 2% SDS and 5 min at 60 °C to disrupt aggregates before loading. Cleavage products were separated on 4% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. Oligonucleotides released from RNase T1 digestions of all four single or mixed labeled SI, 5′ PI, and 3′ PI RNAs were fractionated to yield two-dimensional fingerprints (first separation by gel electrophoresis and second by homochromatography) exactly as described (25Branch A.D. Benenfeld B.J. Robertson H.D. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 130-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Standard conditions for secondary analysis (with pancreatic RNase A, RNase U2, RNase T2, or 0.4m NaOH) (26Barrell B.G. Cantoni G.L. Davies D.R. Procedures in Nucleic Acid Research. Harper and Row, New York1971Google Scholar) were followed permitting the oligonucleotides to be identified. One-dimensional electrophoresis on DEAE or 3MM paper was done following Barrells' protocol (26Barrell B.G. Cantoni G.L. Davies D.R. Procedures in Nucleic Acid Research. Harper and Row, New York1971Google Scholar). Serum containing anti-Th antibodies from a patient with an autoimmune disease was used to immunodeplete RNase P activity (27Eder P.S. Kekuda R. Stolc V. Altman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1101-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Protein A-Sepharose beads (125 μg, dry weight; Amersham Biosciences) were washed with TMKT buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.02% Tween 20) before incubation for 1 h at room temperature at different concentrations of either normal serum or anti-Th serum (0.25, 0.5, or 1 μl) and in 30 μl of TMKT buffer. After washing four times in TMKT, followed by three washes in RNase P buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgOAc, 100 mm NH4OAc), the beads were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in 2.5 μl of RNase P extract. The suspension was centrifuged, and both the supernatant and the immunoprecipitate were assayed for enzyme activity. To facilitate migration of products on the acrylamide gel, an additional step of proteinase K treatment was carried out after phenol/SDS treatment on each reaction tube. HCV variants were obtained from our library of cloned fragments encompassing HCV nucleotides 2641–2872 from infected patients. Subsequently the fragments were extended by PCR at their 3′-ends using primers HCV-2639 (5′-ACAGGATCCAGTCCTTCCTTGTGTTCTTCT-3′) and HCV-2871 (5′-AACGAATTCCCACACATGCAAGTGCGCCTCAGCTCTGGTGATAAGATATTGTAACCACCA-3′), corresponding to the “wild type” clone (this length of 3′-extension was required for cleavage (data not shown)). Amplified DNA fragments were inserted in BamHI/EcoRI sites of pGem-4Z. RNAs were synthesized from EcoRI-linearized plasmids and contained an additional 45-nt stretch of plasmid polylinker. SI transcript, the DNA template for which has been cloned in the same manner as the variant sequences, was referred as to wild type in these experiments. The nucleotide sequence for the HCV wild type genome is available in the GenBankTM data base under accession number S62220 (28Hayashi N. Higashi H. Kaminaka K. Sugimoto H. Esumi M. Komatsu K. Hayashi K. Sugitani M. Suzuki K. Tadao O. J. Hepatol. 1993; 17: 94-107Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence for HCV variants presented in this article can be accessed through EMBL data base under EMBL data base accession numbersAJ248084, AJ391467, AJ391452, and AJ247989 (7Cabot B. Martell M. Esteban J.I. Sauleda S. Otero T. Esteban R. Guardia J. Gomez J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Initial RNase P cleavage experiments involved a 554-base HCV RNA transcript (SI nt 2486–3040). At the top of Fig. 1A is a schematic drawing of the HCV RNA genome, below which appears the SItranscript located at the structural/nonstructural junction region. The autoradiogram in Fig. 1B shows that, using the SI transcript as a substrate, RNase P peak activity alone, in the absence of any external guide sequence, cleaved the HCV transcript very efficiently, producing two intense cleavage products (5′ PI and 3′ PI). After this unexpected result, we wanted to assess whether cleavage was maintained in a larger transcript, encompassing the first one-third of the genome (Fig.1A, SII nt 1–3032). In the course of that demonstration, we detected a second HCV cleavage site in the IRES region (Fig. 1, A and C). Subsequently, cleavage within the IRES was confirmed using a third transcript corresponding to the first 1360 bases of HCV genome (Fig. 1A, SIII nt 1–1360) as well as in a shorter fragment, 641 nt long (SIV nt 1–641). The key experimental question of the HCV RNA cleavages obtained in the reactions involving unguided RNase P concerns a demonstration that cleavages in different sized transcripts are performed by RNase P itself and not by a co-extracted contaminant. To prove that, we have used direct and indirect methods. If RNase P were responsible for HCV RNA processing activity in our RNase P peak activity (HeLa cell extract), the site of cleavage might be expected to occur between precise nucleotide positions and release products containing the 3′-hydroxyl and 5′-phosphate end groups (17Robertson H.D. Altman S. Smith J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5243-5251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Contaminating RNases almost invariably cleave to yield 5′-hydroxyl and 3′-phosphate end groups (29Adams R.L.P. Knowler J.T. Leader D.P. The Biochemistry of the Nucleic Acids. Chapman and Hall Ltd., London1992: 97-133Crossref Google Scholar), and very few other RNases and ribozymes cleave the phosphodiester backbone through the same mechanism used by RNase P (30Pyle A.M. Science. 1993; 261: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). To allow direct and precise determination of the cleavage site as well as to identify the phosphate polarity of the newly cleaved termini, substrate SI was internally labeled either separately with α-32P-labeled GTP, ATP, CTP, and UTP or simultaneously with all four labeled rNTPs and incubated with RNase P peak activity under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” Both cleavage products (5′ PI and 3′ PI) and control transcript (SI) were fractionated by gel electrophoresis, eluted from the gel, and subjected to RNase T1 digestion. Fig. 2 shows two-dimensional fingerprint analysis (25Branch A.D. Benenfeld B.J. Robertson H.D. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 130-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) of the oligonucleotides generated by RNase T1 digestion of single or mixed labeled uncut SI substrate, 5′ PI, and 3′ PI cleavage products and identifies the exact phosphodiester bond cleaved during the cleavage reaction to be between residues A2860 and G2861 within the four-base RNase T1-resistant oligonucleotide2858CUAG2861 found to be missing from both the 5′ PI and 3′ PI fingerprint patterns (data confirmed by secondary RNase digestion, not shown). These experiments also demonstrate that the final position of the phosphate group is 5′ to the cleavage. More precisely, the arrow in Fig.2D indicates that a new spot appears in the GTP-labeled 3′ PI fingerprint that does not appear in the UTP-labeled 3′ PI (arrow in Fig. 2C). Also, it appears neither in Fig. 2, A and B, nor in the ATP- or CTP-labeled 3′ PI fingerprints (data not shown). This novel spot was eluted and confirmed to be the 5′-terminal residue pGp by its mobility with respect to markers in secondary analysis by one-dimensional electrophoresis on DEAE and 3MM paper (26Barrell B.G. Cantoni G.L. Davies D.R. Procedures in Nucleic Acid Research. Harper and Row, New York1971Google Scholar). Fig.3 depicts RNA fingerprinting analysis of the substrate SIV RNA, corresponding to the HCV IRES, as well as both cleavage products generated by RNase P. In each case, T1-resistant oligonucleotides were eluted and subjected to further enzymatic characterization as described elsewhere (26Barrell B.G. Cantoni G.L. Davies D.R. Procedures in Nucleic Acid Research. Harper and Row, New York1971Google Scholar). As summarized in the legend to Fig. 3, a spot (A, spot 1) from the intact SIV RNA fingerprint was absent from the fingerprint pattern of both cleavage products. This missing RNase T1-resistant oligonucleotide containing the RNase P cleavage site(s) in the SIV RNA substrate is the 17-mer (nt 351–367), thus indicating precise cleavage of the RNA substrate in the HCV IRES domain. This 17-mer is replaced by a new spot in each one of the cleavage products' fingerprints (Fig. 3B, spot 2; Fig. 3C, spot 3). Together, these two were found by secondary analysis to contain the sequence of the missing 17-mer with the expected composition indicating a cleavage site in the vicinity of bases 361–363. Further experiments are in progress to pin down exact termini within this RNase P cleavage domain. Two indirect strategies were used to demonstrate that the activity that cleaves SI and SII and exactly co-purified with RNase P peak activity was in fact RNase P. The experiments were carried out using SI, SII, and SIIIas substrates. Some patients with autoimmune diseases produce antibodies against a 38–40-kDa protein (designated Th antigen) which is an integral component of eukaryotic RNase P (27Eder P.S. Kekuda R. Stolc V. Altman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1101-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the immunoprecipitation experiment, we have incubated a serum containing anti-Th antibodies with our peak activity (RNase P extract), and we have assayed both the supernatant and the pellet. The anti-Th serum that immunodepleted pre-tRNATyr cleavage activity from our glycerol gradient-purified enzyme (Fig.4A, lane 2) also immunodepleted cleavage of HCV transcripts (Fig. 4, B, lanes 6–8, and C, lanes 22–24). Moreover, the autoimmune serum was able to precipitate the processing activity of HCV transcripts SI and SII (Fig. 4, B, lanes 9–11, and C, lanes 25–27) as well as pre-tRNATyr (Fig.4A, lane 3) and a human suppressor pre-tRNA (data not shown). In contrast, the normal human serum failed to precipitate the processing activity (Fig. 4, B, lanes 16–18, C, lane 21). Control reactions of RNase P cleavage, using protein A-Sepharose beads with no added antiserum, showed that the cleavage activity remains in the supernatant after the immunoprecipitation and is not found in the pellet (Fig. 4B, lanes 5 and 12). An inverse correlation between the percentage of cleavage with increasing anti-Th sera (Fig. 4C, lanes 25–27) may be due to inactivation of RNase P activity due to the presence of polyclonal antibodies reacting with important motifs for substrate recognition. Like RNase P, MRP RNases cleave RNA to generate 5′-phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl termini (31Chang D.D. Clayton D.A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and may be immunoprecipitated with anti-Th serum. As a distinguishing feature, MRP RNase does not cleave pre-tRNATyr (32Karwan R. Bennett J.L. Clayton D.A. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1264-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that MRP enzymes were responsible for HCV cleavage, we carried out competitive inhibition experiments between HCV RNA and pre-tRNA. The experiments consisted of incubating the same amount of HCV RNA (SI, SII, or SIII) with increasing concentrations of pre-tRNA (from 18-fold to 4-fold) to inhibit HCV RNA cleavages. When labeled pre-tRNATyr was included in the SI HCV cleavage reactions, the amount of HCV cleavage product decreased with an increasing competitor concentration at a ratio near 1:1 (Fig.5A, lane 5). With the long transcript (SII), a decrease of products from the two cleavage reactions was more noticeable when the molar ratio between pre-tRNATyr and SIIreached 2:1 (Fig. 5B). The direct consequence of the high mutation rate in HCV replication is that variant genomes are continuously being generated. Thus, multiple variant sequences (quasispecies) co-circulate within a patient, and each patient carries a virus with a distinct “master” (the most frequent) sequence (5Martell M. Esteban J.I. Quer J. Genesca J. Weiner A. Esteban R. Guardia J. Gomez J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3225-3229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Gomez J. Martell M. Quer J. Cabot B. Esteban J.I. J. Viral Hepat. 1999; 6: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To define cleavage by RNase P as a general property of HCV, four viral sequences obtained from different patients, together with SI sequence (referred to as wild type here), were compared for RNase P cleavage accessibility (Fig. 6A). We used transcripts from cloned HCV PCR fragments, representing the master sequence from infected patients' quasispecies, with mutations at the vicinity or exactly at the nucleotides adjacent to the scissile bond in the structural/nonstructural junction. Cleavage was consistently observed in all sequences tested although with different efficiencies (Fig. 6B). The concept of RNA mimicry has been defined for those cases where the structure of an RNA molecule has evolved to fit a binding site on a protein or a macromolecular complex that normally interacts with a different RNA (33Springer M. Portier C. Grunberg-Manago M. Simons R.W. RNA structure and function. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 337-413Google Scholar). The specific cleavage of HCV RNA by RNase P suggests that the viral RNA has structural similarities to tRNA. We wished to assess how much these HCV RNA structures resemble tRNA. In competition experiments reciprocal to those shown in Fig. 5, we tested the ability of HCV RNA transcripts SI and SIII(0.9–180 nm) to compete for RNase P activity with the natural substrate pre-tRNATyr (1.8 nm). Fig.7 shows that by using an RNase P concentration capable of cleaving around 25% of the pre-tRNATyr in the reaction, the amount of pre-tRNA cleavage products decreased with increasing HCV RNA concentration. The amount of HCV RNAs required for half-inhibition were between 4- and 6-fold molar excess and were similar for both SI and SIII. In contrast, similar amounts of an unrelated RNA of 400-nt length corresponding to hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen mRNA (nt 1400–1800 of HBV adr subtype) (34Ono Y. Onda H. Sasada R. Igarashi K. Sugino Y. Nishioka K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1747-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), which is not cleaved by RNase P, had no observable effect on RNase P activity on pre-tRNA (data not shown). The fact that the HCV RNA is a competitive inhibitor of pre-tRNA cleavage within a 1 order of magnitude range is evidence of molecular mimicry between the HCV RNA motifs at the cleavage sites and t"
https://openalex.org/W2034976173,"Uridine diphosphoglucose pyrophosphorylase (UDPGP) is a developmentally regulated enzyme in Dictyostelium discoideum, which is involved in trehalose, cellulose, and glycogen synthesis. Two independent UDPGP proteins are believed to be responsible for this activity. To determine the relative contributions of each protein, the genes encoding them were disrupted individually. Cells lacking the udpgp1 gene exhibit normal growth and development and make normal levels of cellulose. In agreement with these phenotypes, udpgp1− cells still have UDPGP activity, although at a reduced level. This supports the importance of the second UDPGP gene. This newly identified gene,ugpB, encodes an active UDPGP as determined by complementation in Escherichia coli. When this gene is disrupted, cells undergo aberrant differentiation and development ending with small, gnarled fruiting bodies. These cells also have decreased spore viability and decreased levels of glycogen, whose production requires UDPGP activity. These phenotypes suggest that UgpB constitutes the major UDPGP activity produced during development. Sequence analysis of the two UDPGP genes shows that UgpB has higher homology to other eukaryotic UDPGPs than does UDPGP1. This includes the presence of 5 conserved lysine residues. Udpgp1 only has 1 of these lysines.

When they overgrow their food source and begin to starve, they stop dividing and initiate a developmental program (1Loomis W.F. Dictyostelium discoideum: A Developmental System.

By using cAMP as a chemoattractant, up to 105 cells aggregate and eventually form a fruiting body consisting of a mass of spore cells situated upon a column of stalk cells. During this process, cAMP regulates the expression of a large number of genes required for development by binding to cell surface receptors and activating several signal transduction pathways (1Loomis W.F.

One such regulated gene is the upgpg1 gene. UDPGP1 catalyzes the creation of UDP-glucose from glucose 1-phosphate and UTP. UDP-glucose is the energetically activated form of glucose and is required for the synthesis of trehalose, cellulose, and glycogen. Previous work (10Ashworth J.M. Sussman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1696-1700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Dimond R.L. Farnsworth P.A. Loomis W.F. Dev. Biol. 1976; 50: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) has shown that the enzyme activity in vegetative cells is low, but detectable, and rises 5-fold during development. To understand better the role of UDPGP in development, cells expressing udpgp1antisense RNA were created. However, these transformants grew and developed normally (12Haribabu B. Pavlovic J. Bodduluri S.R. Doody J.F. Ortiz B.D. Mullings S. Moon B. Dottin R.P. Dev. Genet. 1991; 12: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). This suggested that either low levels of Udpgp1 activity were still present, a second gene existed, or UDPGP activity was not required for development in Dictyostelium. Consistent with the second hypothesis, Manrow and Dottin (13Manrow R.E. Dottin R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 120: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and Fishel et al. (14Fishel B.R. Ragheb J.A. Rajkovic A. Haribabu B. Schweinfest C.W. Dottin R.P. Dev. Biol. 1985; 110: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) found that there appear to be two isoforms of UDPGP. In this paper we describe the phenotype associated with disruption of the udpgp1 gene by homologous recombination. In addition, we describe the identification and disruption of a second UDPGP gene,ugpB. D. discoideum strain Ax3 was grown axenically in HL5 medium to a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml or on SM plates in association with Klebsiella bacteria. DH1 wild-type cells were grown in shaking culture in HL5 medium as described by Gomeret al. (15Gomer R.H. Yuen I.S. Firtel R.A. Development. 1991; 112: 269-278PubMed Google Scholar) except that the medium was supplemented with 20 μg/liter biotin, 5 μg/liter vitamin B12, 200 μg/liter folic acid, 400 μg/liter lipoic acid, 500 μg/liter riboflavin, 600 μg/liter thiamine supplement, and uracil. A mixture of 0.3 g/liter streptomycin sulfate and 0.1 g/liter ampicillin was used as antibiotics. The procedure of Wood et al. (16Wood S.A. Ammann R.R. Brock D.A., Li, L. Spann T. Gomer R.H. Development. 1996; 122: 3677-3685PubMed Google Scholar) was used to determine the percentages of prestalk and prespore cells at low cell density. For development, cells at mid-log phase (2 × 106 cells/ml) were washed in buffer and plated on filter pads following Jain et al. (17Jain R. Yuen I.S. Taphouse C.R. Gomer R.H. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Transformation was performed by electroporation following the procedure of Dynes and Firtel (18Dynes J.L. Firtel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7966-7970Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cells were grown axenically to 2 × 106 cells/ml, and 5 ml were collected by centrifugation at 450 × g and washed in 2 volumes of electroporation buffer (EB, 1 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.1, and 500 mm sucrose). The pellet was resuspended in 0.3 ml of EB. The cell suspension was mixed with 10 μg of DNA. The mixture was transferred to an electroporation cuvette (0.2 cm, Bio-Rad) in an ice water bath. After 3–4 min, the cells were electroporated using a 1.5-kV pulse from a 3-microfarad capacitor. The cells were immediately returned to an ice water bath for 10 min. The cells were then transferred to a 100-mm tissue culture plate and then treated with 3 μl of 100 mm CaCl2 and 100 mm MgCl2. After 15 min, 12 ml of HL5 was added. 24 h later, the medium was replaced with 2 volumes of HL5 containing 10 μg/ml G418. 200 μl was plated into each well of a 96-well plate. After 10 days, aliquots of the culture were plated on SM plates with bacteria to isolate individual clones for further analysis. Total cellular RNA was isolated from vegetative or developed cells as described by Alton and Lodish (19Alton T.H. Lodish H.F. Dev. Biol. 1977; 60: 180-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Northern blots were prepared as described by Haribabu and Dottin (20Haribabu B. Dottin R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2402-2408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Equal amounts of RNA were loaded into each lane of an agarose gel as determined by ethidium bromide staining of the ribosomal RNA bands. The assays were performed as described previously (11Dimond R.L. Farnsworth P.A. Loomis W.F. Dev. Biol. 1976; 50: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with modifications. Cell extracts were prepared by lysing the cells at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml in 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The assay mixture contained the following: 1 mm UDPGP, 2 nmsodium pyrophosphate, 1.6 mm NADP, 10 μmglucose 1,6-diphosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mmMgCl2, 0.05 units of phosphoglucomutase, 0.14 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 85 mm Tricine, pH 7.6, and cell extract to a total volume of 0.5 ml. The increase in absorbance at 340 nm was measured at 37 °C. One unit of enzyme activity is the amount of enzyme necessary to produce 1 nmol of NADPH per min at 37 °C. Total cellular protein was measured using the Bio-Rad protein determination kit. Specific activity is defined as units of enzyme activity per mg of cellular protein. Cellulose was extracted first in a mixture of 80% acetic acid and 10% nitric acid and then measured as described previously (21Updegraff D.M. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 32: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). D. discoideumDNA was prepared as described previously (22Ragheb J.A. Dottin R.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 3891-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To identify the second UDPGP gene, PCR was performed on genomic DNA using degenerate oligonucleotides. The forward primer (F1) was 5′-AGAAGCTTG(A/G)(G/C/A/T)TGGTA(T/C)CC(A/T)CC(A/T)GG-3′, and the reverse primer (R1) was 5′-GAGAATTCAA(T/A/G)A(T/C)(A/G)TA(C/T)TC(C/T)TT(G/C/A/T)CC-3′. PCR was carried out for 35 cycles (94 °C for 60 s, 45 °C for 60 s, 72 °C for 3 min) with Taq DNA polymerase. The amplified PCR products were cloned in pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). This PCR product was then used to screen a λZAP library of D. discoideum genomic DNA (kindly provided by Dr. Herbert Ennis) and phagemid were rescued following the manufacturer’s directions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). REMI mutagenesis of theDictyostelium uracil-prototrophic cell line DH1 was performed using DpnII-linearized DIV2 plasmid essentially as described by Kuspa and Loomis (23Kuspa A. Loomis W.F. Genetics. 1994; 138: 665-674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After selection, mutagenized transformants were screened for developmental phenotypes. The DIV2 plasmid along with flanking genomic DNA of the disrupted gene was rescued from developmental mutants and used to recapitulate the mutant phenotypes by homologous recombination of the rescued plasmid intoDictyostelium strain Ax4. Mutants that recapitulated the phenotype were isolated, and the DIV2 plasmid along with flanking genomic DNA was rescued. The genomic DNA was then sequenced at the Baylor College of Medicine Sequencing Core (Houston, TX) to identify the disrupted gene. To determine cellular glycogen content, cells were harvested as vegetative or 20-h developed cultures, washed in PBM, resuspended to 5 × 106 cells/ml in 10% acetic acid, and lysed through a Cameo 25N 5-micron filter (MSI, Westboro, MA). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation and the supernatant titrated to pH 5.0 with KOH, and 200 μl of the neutralized supernatant was incubated with 100 μl of a 70 units/μl solution of α-amyloglucosidase (in 0.4 msodium acetate, pH 4.8) at 50 °C for 3 h to hydrolyze glycogen to free glucose. After 3 h, the glucose content of 5 and 15 μl of each culture was measured with the Trinder Glucose Assay Kit (Sigma) following the protocol of the manufacturer. Glucose concentrations of the cells were calculated from a standard curve generated from purified glucose. Glucose liberated from glycogen was determined by normalizing cellular glycogen concentrations to glucose concentrations in lysates incubated in the absence of α-amyloglucosidase. Protein concentration of the clarified lysates was determined with the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Reagent (Bio-Rad) using a bovine serum albumin standard, following the protocol of the manufacturer. The spore viability assay was performed essentially as described by Dynes et al. (24Dynes J.L. Lark A.M. Shaulsky G. Kuspa A. Loomis W.F. Firtel R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 948-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To determine the number of viable spores or cells in a culture ofDictyostelium, 1 × 107 cells were plated onto filters and allowed to develop. At various time points, cells were removed from the filters, washed in PBM, and either serially diluted directly in a Klebsiella aerogenes suspension and plated on SM/5 plates (for cell viability assay), or pelleted, resuspended in 10 mm EDTA/0.1% Nonidet P-40 in PB, incubated at 42 °C for 45 min, washed three times in PBM, and then serially diluted inK. aerogenes and plated on SM/5 plates (spore viability assay). We constructed a 6.4-kb fragment containing theudpgp1 genomic locus in which 1.7 kb in the central region of the gene was replaced by a 2.1-kb neomycin resistance cassette (neo) (Fig. 1A). The modified UDPGP sequence with the neo cassette was excised from the vector DNA by digestion with HincII and SacI and then introduced into Ax3 cells by electroporation. Transformants were selected in the presence of G418. Insertion of the construct into theudpgp1 locus by homologous recombination was confirmed by Southern blots (Fig. 1B). We then examined the expression of the udpgp1 gene in the disruptant as well as the parental strain by Northern blot analysis of total cytoplasmic RNA. Wild-type cells show the 1.8-kb transcript expected for the udpgp1 mRNA, with the expected expression patterns during development (Fig.2). The udpgp1−strain generates a 0.8-kb transcript with the same expression pattern as that of the wild-type cells. The reduced size of this RNA suggests that the neo cassette inserted into the middle of the second exon ofudpgp1, causing the production of a stable truncated RNA (Fig. 2) (10Ashworth J.M. Sussman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1696-1700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Dimond R.L. Farnsworth P.A. Loomis W.F. Dev. Biol. 1976; 50: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Taken together, the Southern and Northern data show that in the udpgp1− cells, theudpgp1 gene is replaced with the altered deleted construct by double crossing over as indicated in Fig. 1A. To determine what effect loss of udpgp1 had on vegetative growth, wild-type and udpgp1− cells were grown in suspension and their densities measured. Cells lackingudpgp1 grow at the same rate as wild-type cells (data not shown). To examine the effect of disrupting the udpgp1 gene on development, wild-type andudpgp1− cells were allowed to starve and develop on filter pads for 24 h.udpgp1− cells developed fruiting bodies at the same rate and with the same size as wild-type cells (data not shown). This is in agreement with previous reports (12Haribabu B. Pavlovic J. Bodduluri S.R. Doody J.F. Ortiz B.D. Mullings S. Moon B. Dottin R.P. Dev. Genet. 1991; 12: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) that antisense inactivation of udpgp1 had no obvious effect on growth or development. Thus, the udpgp1 gene is not required for vegetative growth or fruiting body formation. Because UDPGP is a key enzyme in the production of various carbohydrates, we examined the ability ofudpgp1− cells to make cellulose. Cellulose is almost undetectable in vegetative cells. However, cellulose is required for fruiting body formation, consisting of 4% of the dry weight of mature fruiting bodies, and is a major component of stalk and spore cells (1Loomis W.F. Dictyostelium discoideum: A Developmental System. Academic Press, Inc., New York1975: 47-56Crossref Google Scholar, 11Dimond R.L. Farnsworth P.A. Loomis W.F. Dev. Biol. 1976; 50: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 25Sussman M.A. Osborn M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 52: 503-512Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 26Wright B.E. Dahlberg D. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 2074-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). From 0 to 15 h of development, the total amount of cellulose in wild-type cells remains fairly low at 10 μg/108 cells. It then rapidly increases to 80 μg/108 cells by 25 h (Fig.3). The udpgp1−cells show slightly less cellulose than wild-type cells during development, but in the fully developed organism cellulose levels are normal. Thus, udpgp1 is not the major protein involved in cellulose generation. Given that the udpgp1− cells developed normally and have normal levels of cellulose, we decided to examine whether these cells had any UDPGP activity. The developmental profile of UDPGP enzyme activity has been well established (10Ashworth J.M. Sussman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1696-1700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Dimond R.L. Farnsworth P.A. Loomis W.F. Dev. Biol. 1976; 50: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows the expected increase in activity that was previously observed during development for wild-type cells. The enzyme activity declines slightly at 5–10 h into development and then rises to a peak at 20 h (10Ashworth J.M. Sussman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1696-1700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Fishel B.R. Ragheb J.A. Rajkovic A. Haribabu B. Schweinfest C.W. Dottin R.P. Dev. Biol. 1985; 110: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Theudpgp1− strain does not show any enzyme activity in vegetative cells. However, starting at 15 h into development, enzyme activity appears and increases up to about one-third of the total specific activity of wild-type cells. This suggests the existence of at least one other gene that encodes a protein with UDPGP activity. Previously, we reported (14Fishel B.R. Ragheb J.A. Rajkovic A. Haribabu B. Schweinfest C.W. Dottin R.P. Dev. Biol. 1985; 110: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) that immunoprecipitation of the products of in vitro translated total mRNA from wild-type cells with antiserum to UDPGP enzyme identified two polypeptides of 55 and 53 kDa. However, hybrid selection with clonedudpgp1 cDNA rescued mRNA encoding only the higher molecular weight in vitro translated product (14Fishel B.R. Ragheb J.A. Rajkovic A. Haribabu B. Schweinfest C.W. Dottin R.P. Dev. Biol. 1985; 110: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In accordance with the presence of UDPGP activity in theudpgp1−, this suggests the presence of a second UDPGP gene. To identify this second gene, termed ugpB, degenerate PCR was performed on wild-type and udpgp1− genomic DNA using primers matching potentially conserved regions. As expected, PCR products from both reactions measured 112 bp. If the degenerate primers hybridized to the second UDPGP gene, the PCR products from the wild-type DNA would be a mixture amplified from both theudpgp1 and ugpB genes, although that from theudpgp1− DNA should only have originated from the ugpB gene. To test this, the two PCR products were digested with BglII, because a BglII site occurs in the middle of the amplified region of the udpgp1 gene. Such a site would most likely not be present in the ugpBgene. Indeed, the 112-bp PCR product from wild-type DNA was reduced by more than 70% on digestion with BglII, whereas the 112-bp PCR product from udpgp1− DNA was unaffected. This suggested that the majority of the PCR product from theudpgp1− genomic DNA was amplified from theugpB gene. The 112-bp PCR product from the udpgp1− DNA was subcloned into a vector and sequenced. This sequence was then used to screen a genomic library for the second gene. A genomic clone was isolated that contained the partial sequence of the ugpBgene. To recover the ugpB cDNA, a search of theDictyostelium EST data base project revealed several clones. These clones were ordered from the data base project, and the two largest were entirely sequenced. These two clones proved to contain full-length ugpB cDNAs (Fig.5). UgpB is 42.7% identical and 57.1% similar to Udpgp1 at the amino acid level. However UgpB actually possesses greater homology to UDPGPs from several species of animals and plants than it does to Udpgp1 or Udpgp1 does to any of these other orthologues (TableI). The molecular mass of the UgpB protein as derived from the amino acid sequence is 56,153 Da, which is 1734 Da less than the derived molecular weight of Udpgp1. Furthermore, UgpB has a net charge of +5, whereas Udpgp1 has a net charge of −3. The differences in calculated charge and size between Udpgp1 and UgpB are consistent with the analyses of Manrow and Dottin (13Manrow R.E. Dottin R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 120: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and Fishel et al. (14Fishel B.R. Ragheb J.A. Rajkovic A. Haribabu B. Schweinfest C.W. Dottin R.P. Dev. Biol. 1985; 110: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), in which they demonstrated that Udpgp1 is the larger and more acidic of the two UDPGP isozymes.Table ISequence comparison of UgpB and Udpgp1 to homologues from different organismsOrganismUgpBUdpgp1SimIDSimIDYeast60.848.254.237.8Potato61.248.953.837.3Worm61.349.455.640.2Human65.153.957.641.7Udpgp157.142.7100100The amino acid sequences of UgpB and Udpgp1 were compared using Vector NCl, and the percentage similarity and identity were tabulated. Open table in a new tab The amino acid sequences of UgpB and Udpgp1 were compared using Vector NCl, and the percentage similarity and identity were tabulated. To determine whether distinct subgroups could be identified within the UDPGP family of genes, UDPGP amino acid sequences derived from all 21 of the eukaryotic cDNA sequences in GenBankTM were aligned using the multiple sequence alignment program PileUp provided in the Wisconsin Package (Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI). The alignments are displayed as a distance tree (Fig.6). From the tree it is readily apparent that Udpgp1, Saccharomyces cerevisiae2, andCaenorhabditis elegans4 are each on their own branch, whereas the remaining 19 sequences share a common branch. Within the branch containing these 19 sequences, all of the remaining yeast sequences cluster together; all of the plant sequences cluster together; all of the vertebrate sequences cluster together; and all of the nematode sequences cluster together. The DictyosteliumUgpB sequence is on its own branch but is more closely aligned with the animal sequences than the plant or yeast sequences and more closely aligned to all of these sequences than to Udpgp1. Close inspection of the sequences revealed that the three proteins that fail to group with the remaining proteins (Udpgp1, C. elegans4, and S. cerevisiae2) all share the loss of at least two of five conserved lysine residues previously identified as being important for substrate binding or catalysis (27Katsube T. Kazuta Y. Tanizawa K. Fukui T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8546-8551Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 28Kazuta Y. Omura Y. Tagaya M. Nakano K. Fukui T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8541-8545Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These five functionally important lysines are residues 263, 329, 367, 409, and 410 in Potato1 UDPGP (for clarity when discussing homologues of varying lengths these will hereafter be referred to as sites K1, K2, K3, K4, and K5). The residues at sites K1–K5 in the 21 aligned genes are detailed in Fig. 6. From Fig. 6 it is apparent that of the 21 UDPGP amino acid sequences, mutations in sites K1–K3 are restricted to only a small subset of the proteins; K1 is mutated in only Udpgp1 andS. cerevisiae2; K2 is mutated in only Udpgp1,Schizosaccharomyces pombe2, and S. cerevisiae2; K3 is mutated in only S. cerevisiae2; and only Udpgp1,S. cerevisiae2, and C. elegans4 possess mutations in both K4 and K5. This analysis confirms that these five lysine residues are tightly conserved across a wide range of taxa and suggests that Udpgp1, S. cerevisiae2, and C. elegans4, three proteins that segregate as outgroups from the main tree, form a subgroup of UDPGP proteins with possible differences in catalytic or substrate binding abilities from the majority of UDPGP proteins. To examine the developmental expression pattern of ugpB, Northern blots were performed using total RNA from wild-type cells. Theudpgp1 mRNA is ∼1.8 kb, whereas the ugpBmRNA is ∼1.6 kb. For both transcripts, expression does not become strong until 12 h into development and peaks at 16 h into development (Fig. 7). It is important to note that the accumulation of udpgp1 and ugpBtranscripts is consistent with the accumulation of UDPGP enzyme activity. The udpgp1 and ugpB mRNAs were expressed in both prestalk and prespore cell types (data not shown). It has been shown that clones encoding a UDPGP from different organisms can functionally complement a bacterialgalU mutant that lacks UDPGP activity (29Peng H.L. Chang H.Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 30Daran J.M. Dallies N. Thines-Sempoux D. Paquet V. Francois J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 520-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To determine whether the cDNA coding for ugpB is functional, we subjected it to this complementation test. E. coli mutant strains CA10 and CA198 were able to grow on minimal M9 plates containing 0.2% glucose but not on plates supplemented with 0.2% galactose because of deficient UDPGP activity. We transformed these strains with the Dictyostelium cDNA SSA730 encodingugpB, and we observed rescued growth on galactose-containing plates. These observations demonstrate that this ugpB codes for a functional UDPGP. An REMI mutant of ugpB was identified and analyzed. The gene was determined to be disrupted between codons 333 and 334, which is upstream of the regions coding 4 of the 5 conserved lysine residues (Fig. 5). We examined the expression of ugpBin the disruptant by Northern blot, and we found that theugpB− strain fails to make a detectable transcript (data not shown). To characterize the phenotype of ugpB− mutants, parental DH1 and ugpB− cells were starved on filter pads at densities between 1 × 105 and 1 × 108 cells/ml, and the extent of development was analyzed. DH1 and ugpB− cells aggregate over the same range of cell densities, indicating that the mutation does not affect the ability of cells to initiate development or form aggregates. At all cell densities, the mutant strain was essentially indistinguishable from the parental strain until about 16 h into development. At this point, the parental strain briefly formed a few slugs, but the majority of aggregates directly proceeded with the formation of fingers and early culminants. However, inugpB− mutants the majority of the aggregates formed slugs that migrated for several hours before proceeding with finger formation and culmination. Furthermore, the mutants culminated aberrantly, producing small, gnarled fruiting bodies often having very small spore masses (Fig. 8). Therefore, expression of ugpB− was required for normal fruiting body development. By using an immunofluorescence technique described previously (15Gomer R.H. Yuen I.S. Firtel R.A. Development. 1991; 112: 269-278PubMed Google Scholar), we assayed the ability ofugpB− cells to differentiate into CP2-positive (pre-stalk) and SP70-positive (pre-spore) cells during development. Of the wild-type cells that differentiated in this assay, 74.6 ± 0.2% became SP70-positive cells, whereas 25.4 ± 0.2% became CP2-positive cells. The ugpB− mutants did not differ from the wild-type cells, with 76.6 ± 4.2% of the cells becoming SP70-positive and 23.4 ± 4.2% becoming CP2-positive. However, the total number of mutant cells that differentiated was only 77 ± 1.6% of the number of differentiated wild-type cells.ugpB− mutants therefore appear to be capable of undergoing early differentiation and producing the proper ratios of differentiated cells; however, individual cells are less likely to initiate or maintain differentiation. Because UDPGP activity produces UDP-glucose, the substrate for glycogen synthase, we hypothesized thatugpB− cells might be deficient in glycogen production. To test this hypothesis we assayed the glycogen content of both vegetative and starved cells from both the parental andugpB− lines. As shown in Fig.9, vegetativeugpB− cells contain less than half as much glycogen as do wild-type cells. Furthermore, starvedugpB− cells contain only 2% as much glycogen as do starved wild-type cells. These data suggest that mutation of theugpB gene interferes with glycogen metabolism. The ugpB− cells form small, misshapen fruiting bodies. To determine whether viable spores are produced in these abnormal structures, developed parental and mutant cells were heated in a detergent solution to kill non-sporulated cells, and then surviving spores were enumerated on clonal pl"

Upon PHO5 activation the chromatin structure is reconfigured, but the mechanism of this transition remains unclear. Using templates reconstituted into chromatin with purified recombinant yeast core histones, we have investigated the mechanism of chromatin structure reconfiguration on the PHO5 promoter, a prerequisite for transcriptional activation. Footprinting analyses show that intrinsic properties of the promoter DNA are sufficient for translational nucleosome positioning, which approximates that seenin vivo. We have found that both Pho4p and Pho2p can bind their cognate sites on chromatin-assembled templates without the aid of histone-modifying or nucleosome-remodeling factors. However, nucleosome remodeling by these transcriptional activators requires an ATP-dependent activity in a yeast nuclear extract fraction. Finally, transcriptional activation on chromatin templates requires acetyl-CoA in addition to these other activities and cofactors.

The role of nucleosomes in transcriptional regulation has become a major area of study. Fromin vitro studies, it is clear that nucleosomes can repress transcription by RNA polymerase II (1Laybourn P.J. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1991; 254: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 2Lorch Y. LaPointe J.W. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2282-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 3Georges S.A. Kraus W.L. Luger K. Nyborg J.K. Laybourn P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Further confirmation that nucleosomes play a prominent role in gene regulation came from studies showing that histone H4 depletion in yeast cells results in nucleosome loss and transcription derepression of several RNA polymerase II-transcribed genes (4Han M. Grunstein M. Cell. 1988; 55: 1137-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 5Han M. Kim U.J. Kayne P. Grunstein M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Barring artificial loss, nucleosomes must be reconfigured prior to transcriptional activation of these genes. Recently, many yeast activities that remodel chromatin have been identified, including the SWI/SNF, INO80, ISW1, ISW2, and RSC complexes (reviewed in Ref. 6Havas K. Whitehouse I. Owen-Hughes T. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). All of these activities contain a DNA- or chromatin-dependent ATPase subunit required for remodeling. In addition, many transcriptional activators recruit histone acetyltransferase activities, which in yeast include the ADA, Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase (SAGA), NuA3, and NuA4 complexes (7Gregory P.D. Wagner K. Horz W. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 265: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 8Roth S.Y. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). The chromatin structure of the yeast PHO5 promoter regulates RNA polymerase II transcription of the PHO5 gene, which encodes the major, secreted acid phosphatase in yeast (9Bajwa W. Meyhack B. Rudolph H. Schweingruber A.M. Hinnen A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7721-7739Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Under repressive conditions (adequate phosphate) the PHO5 promoter is bound in an array of positioned nucleosomes (10Almer A. Horz W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2681-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Activation ofPHO5 through phosphate starvation is accompanied by a loss or reconfiguration of four nucleosomes from the promoter region (11Almer A. Rudolph H. Hinnen A. Horz W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Activation is initiated through a signal transduction pathway that ultimately results in dephosphorylation of the transcription factor Pho4p, allowing its transport into the nucleus where it can bind to two upstream activation sequences (UAS)1 on the PHO5promoter, UASp1 and UASp2 (12O'Neill E.M. Kaffman A. Jolly E.R. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1996; 271: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 13Kaffman A. Rank N.M. O'Shea E.K.

Schmitz J. Horz W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2523-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Pho2p, a second transcription factor involved in PHO5 activation, binds cooperatively with Pho4p in vitro at both UASs (16Barbaric S. Munsterkotter M. Goding C. Horz W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2629-2639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pho4p and Pho2p must physically interact in vivo for transcription activation to occur (17Shao D. Creasy C.L. Bergman L.W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 358-364PubMed Google Scholar). This interaction can occur regardless of phosphate concentration but does require the presence of DNA (18Magbanua J.P. Ogawa N. Harashima S. Oshima Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 1182-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Both transcription factors are required for full chromatin remodeling and activation of the PHO5 promoter (19Yoshida K. Ogawa N. Oshima Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 217: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, Pho4p is the primary trigger for activation, because Pho2p appears to be constitutively expressed and active. In addition, overexpression ofPHO4 in a pho2 null strain is sufficient for the full chromatin transition and partial transcriptional activation (15Fascher K.D. Schmitz J. Horz W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2523-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Chromatin remodeling on the PHO5 promoter occurs in the absence of replication and does not require transcription (20Schmid A. Fascher K.D. Horz W. Cell. 1992; 71: 853-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 21Fascher K.D. Schmitz J. Horz W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 658-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that chromatin remodeling and activation of transcription can occur independently. Gcn5p, the catalytic subunit of ADA and Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase HAT complexes is required for full PHO5 derepression in a Δpho80 strain or a Δrpd3 strain and full activation in the absence of one of the UASs (22Gregory P.D. Schmid A. Zavari M. Lui L. Berger S.L. Hörz W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 495-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 23Vogelauer M., Wu, J. Suka N. Grunstein M. Nature. 2000; 408: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the rates of PHO5 chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation are significantly delayed (2- to 3-fold) in a Δgcn5 strain (24Barbaric S. Walker J. Schmid A. Svejstrup J.Q. Horz W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4944-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this delay appears to be specific for chromatin structure rather than for activator (Pho4p). Esa1p, the catalytic subunit of NuA4, is indicated to be involved in maintaining the H4 acetylation state on thePHO5 promoter (23Vogelauer M., Wu, J. Suka N. Grunstein M. Nature. 2000; 408: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). SWI/SNF is not required for activation of PHO5, because the PHO5 chromatin transition is unaffected and acid phosphatase levels achieve 70% of wild type levels under activating conditions in strains carrying anSNF2 disruption (25Gaudreau L. Schmid A. Blaschke D. Ptashne M. Horz W. Cell. 1997; 89: 55-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A requirement for RSC has not been tested, and ISW1 and ISW2 do not seem to have a role inPHO5 regulation (26Kent N.A. Karabetsou N. Politis P.K. Mellor J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, INO80 has been reported to be required for full PHO5 activation (27Ebbert R. Birkmann A. Schuller H.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 741-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 28Shen X. Mizuguchi G. Hamiche A. Wu C. Nature. 2000; 406: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Although the trans-acting factors and cis-acting sequences required for chromatin structure modulation and transcription activation of PHO5 have been extensively studied, the detailed mechanisms of this process are not yet understood. Using minichromosome templates isolated from yeast cells, remodeling onPHO5 promoter was shown to require Pho4p, Pho2p, ATP, and fractionated nuclear extract, further elucidating the mechanism of remodeling (29Haswell E.S. O'Shea E.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2817-2827Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, to study the fine details of chromatin structure modulation, a fully defined chromatin template was required. Here we describe the reconstitution of chromatin templates with purified, recombinant yeast core histones possessing many important aspects of the repressed PHO5 promoter. Based on footprinting results, we conclude that sequence-dependent intrinsic properties of the DNA can produce translational positioning of nucleosomes on the PHO5 promoter that approximates that seen in vivo. Consistent with nucleosome positioning, reconstitution of nucleosomes on the PHO5 promoter strongly repressed transcription. Both Pho4p and Pho2p can bind their cognate sites on chromatin-assembled templates without the aid of remodeling factors. However, nucleosome remodeling by these transcriptional activators requires an ATP-dependent activity in a yeast nuclear extract fraction. Finally, transcriptional activation on chromatin templates requires acetyl-CoA in addition to these other activities and cofactors. These findings indicate that transcriptional activation requires Pho4p, Pho2p, nucleosome remodeling, and nucleosome acetylation. Furthermore, DNA binding, nucleosome remodeling, and transcriptional activation are separable steps, in concordance with the ability to separate nucleosome remodeling and transcriptional activation in vivo (15Fascher K.D. Schmitz J. Horz W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2523-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 20Schmid A. Fascher K.D. Horz W. Cell. 1992; 71: 853-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 21Fascher K.D. Schmitz J. Horz W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 658-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Finally, our results suggest that Pho4p and Pho2p binding to UASp2 in nucleosome −2 occurs prior to nucleosome remodeling or acetylation, which then function subsequent to activator binding. The pPHO5-G-less plasmid was produced by subcloning the 526-bp BamHI to ApoI fragment (−542 to −16) of pMH313 (5Han M. Kim U.J. Kayne P. Grunstein M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and a DNA fragment containing no guanine bases in the RNA-like strand into pUC19. In this construct, three guanines were changed to cytosines in the RNA-like strand at positions −24, −22, and −17 relative to the ATG. The plasmid pMH313-G-less was produced by inserting a 100-bp DNA fragment containing no guanine residues in the RNA-like strand into the ApoI and BamHI sites. The same three guanines were changed to cytosines between the RNA start sites and the ATG. Recombinant yeast core histones, purified as described previously (30White C.L. Suto R.K. Luger K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5207-5218Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), were provided by the Luger laboratory. Yeast core histones and recombinant yeast Nap1p were combined at a total core histones to Nap1p ratio of 1:8 (w/w). Acetylated bovine serum albumin (New England BioLabs) was added to 100 μg/ml, Igepal (Sigma) was added to 0.02%, and the mixture was dialyzed for 16 h at 4 °C against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 120 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.02% Igepal. Following dialysis, glycerol was added to 5%, and the complex was stored at 4 °C. For chromatin reconstitution, the core histones and Nap1p were preincubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Then the appropriate amount of core histones and Nap1p was combined with DNA under the same conditions. Reconstitution was allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 45 min, and reconstituted chromatin templates were stored at 4 °C. Reconstituted chromatin (3 μg of DNA) was digested at 37 °C in 200 μl at 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, and 4 mmCaCl2. Micrococcal nuclease (Worthington) was added to 1.0 unit/ml and digested for 2 and 4 min. Free DNA (3 μg) was incubated under the same conditions except that micrococcal nuclease was added to 0.35 unit/ml and digested for 1 and 2 min. Aliquots of 100 μl were transferred to tubes containing 12 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, 5 μl of 2.5 mg/ml proteinase K (Sigma) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The DNA fragments were extracted, precipitated, washed, and dried. The DNA was resuspended in H2O, and the concentration was determined by measuring absorbance (A260). 75 nmol of a32P-end-labeled primer was added to 250 ng of DNA. The sequence of the primers used were 5′-CCACGTGTGAGTGCCAAG-3′ (mn2), 5′-ATGAGGAAAGGAGAGTAGGGTGGTATA-3′ (ml58), and 5′-GAATTGTCGAAATGAAACG-3′ (mn5). The primers bind where indicated in Fig. 1A. Multiple-round primer extension reactions were carried out in 50-μl reactions containing 0.1 mm dNTPs, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.4, and 50 mm KCl. Five cycles of primer extension were done. Extension products were extracted, precipitated, resuspended in formamide loading buffer, and resolved on a 6% sequencing gel. The gel was dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (AmershamBiosciences). To analyze the degree of reconstitution, 5 μg of DNA was relaxed with 10 units of topoisomerase I (MBI Fermentas) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 30 μg/ml BSA for 40 min at 37 °C in a 100-μl reaction. Following initial relaxation, 10 units more of topoisomerase I was added. Reconstitution reactions contained 500 ng of relaxed DNA, 3 mm MgCl2, and octamer·Nap1p complex in reconstitution buffer in a 19-μl reaction volume. Reconstitution was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of STOP (20 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.25 mg/ml glycogen) and 12.5 μg of proteinase K and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The DNA was extracted and precipitated as before. The DNA was divided and run on two 1% TBE (90 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA)-agarose gels, one of which contained 1.8 μg/ml chloroquine, and visualized with ethidium bromide. Two micrograms of DNA, either naked or reconstituted chromatin (chromatin:DNA, w/w ratio of 1:1), was digested in a 100-μl reaction volume in reconstitution buffer and 5 mmCaCl2. Naked DNA was digested with 0.002, 0.004, 0.008, 0.016, and 0.024 unit of MNase, and chromatin was digested with 0.005, 0.02, 0.05, 0.10, and 0.20 unit of MNase at 37 °C for 10 min. DNA was purified as before and resolved on a 10-cm 1% agarose-TBE gel. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide and digitally scanned. Purification of Pho4p (expression vector T7-PHO4, a gift from the O'Shea laboratory) was adapted from Kaffmanet al. (31Kaffman A. Herskowitz I. Tjian R. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1153-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) and is as follows. Pho4p was expressed in BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at anA600 of 0.7 for 3 h at 30 °C in 1 liter of LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The cells were washed once in 30 ml of RB0.1 buffer (20 mm Tris-OAc, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 100 mm potassium acetate), resuspended in 5 ml of RB0.1, and sonicated, and the debris was pelleted at 10,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor. The lysate was loaded at 0.7 ml/min onto a 10-ml DEAE-Sepharose FF (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated in RB0.1 column, and the column was washed with RB0.1. Proteins were eluted with RB1.0 (same as RB0.1, but with 1m potassium acetate), and the peak Pho4p protein fractions were determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed into RB0.3 for 6 h at 4 °C then loaded at 0.4 ml/min onto a 5-ml SP-Sepharose FF (AmershamBiosciences) column equilibrated in RB0.3. The column was washed with RB0.3, then the proteins were eluted with RB1.0. Peak fractions were determined as before. The Pho4p SP-Sepharose pool was dialyzed against RB0.1 then loaded onto a Mono-Q column equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was washed with RB0.1, and proteins were eluted with an RB0.1 to RB1.0 linear gradient at 0.5 ml/min over 20 column volumes. Peak fractions were determined as described above, and protein concentrations were quantitated using the Coomassie Plus Protein Assay kit (Pierce) and stored in liquid nitrogen. Purification of Pho2p was adapted from Brazas and Stillman (32Brazas R.M. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5524-5537Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The Pho2-His expression vector (M2025, a gift from David Stillman) was transformed into BL21(pLysS) E. coli. 250 ml of LB was supplemented with 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Pho2-His was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an A600 of 0.8 for 3 h at 30 °C. Cells were washed once in His binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 1 mm PMSF). Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 10 ml of His binding buffer. Lysozyme was added to 1 mg/ml, and the cells were incubated on ice for 15 min then sonicated. Igepal (Sigma) was added to 0.1%, and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysate was applied to a 1-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) equilibrated in His binding buffer. The column was washed with His binding buffer followed by His binding buffer plus 60 mm imidazole. Pho2-His was eluted with a linear 60 to 600 mm imidazole gradient in His binding buffer. The peak fractions were determined by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel and dialyzed for 4 h at 4 °C against storage buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 100 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm benzamidine). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce). For the competition EMSA both wild type and mutant probes were 24-bp double-stranded oligomers. The EMSA gel showing Pho4p and Pho2p ternary complex formation was run with the indicated amounts of Pho4p and Pho2p, (Fig.2B), 0.4 ng of labeled probe, and 100 ng of poly(dI-dC) in 15 μl of transcription buffer. The sequences of the mutant oligonucleotides were 5′-TTGCCTACGCCGGCGACTCCGCGA-3′ and 5′-TGATTCGCGGAGTCGCCGGCGTAG-3′. The sequences of the wild type probes were 5′-TGATTAAAAGAGTTAATTGAATAG-3′ and 5′-TTGCCTATTCAATTAACTCTTTTA-3′. Oligonucleotides were annealed, and all probes were labeled with Klenow using [α-32P]dATP. Reactions were 12 μl and contained 50 ng of labeled probe, 225 ng of Pho2p competitor as described in the Fig. 3 legend, and EMSA binding buffer (12% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 100 μg/ml BSA). Reactions proceeded on ice for 15 min with labeled probe then an additional 15 min with competitor. Polyacrylamide gels were 5% acrylamide (40:1, acrylamide:bis) in 0.5× TBE. EMSA gels were run at 30 mA for 1.5 h (24-bp UASp1 probe, Fig. 2B) or 2.5 h (106-bp UASp2 probe, Fig. 2C).FIG. 3Analysis of purified Pho4p and Pho2p proteins.

Naked or reconstituted chromatin DNA (500 ng), 100 ng of poly(dI-dC), purified Pho4p and Pho2p (amounts indicated in Fig. 4 legend), 1% polyethylene glycol 3350, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm potassium glutamate, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 2.5 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol in a 20-μl reaction volume were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. DNase I (Worthington) was added (2 units/ml for naked DNA, 16 units/ml for chromatin) and DNA was digested at 30 °C for 2 min. The reaction was stopped, and the DNA was purified as described above (one-dimensional topological analysis). Twenty cycles of primer extension were conducted in 50 μl of 50 mm KCl; 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.4; 0.75 mm MgCl2; 0.05 mm dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP; 125 ng of DNA; 1 unit of Taq polymerase; and 0.1 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP-end-labeled primer (5′-ATTTGGCATGTGCGATCTCTT-3′). DNA products were extracted and precipitated. Products were resuspended in TBE-formamide dye and electrophoresed on a 5% polyacrylamide-urea gel next to a dideoxy sequence generated by using the same primer and template. The gel was then dried and visualized using a PhosphorImager screen. Whole cell extracts (WCE) were prepared from yeast strains YS25 (MATα;his3–11, 15; leu2–3, 112;ura3Δ5;pho4::ura3Δ5;canR) (a gift from Dr. B. Meyhack) and YS27 (MATα; his3–11, 15;leu2–3, 112; ura3Δ5;pho4::ura3Δ5;pho2::ura3Δ5;canR) (a gift from Dr. W. Hörz). The extracts were prepared according to the procedure of Woontner et al.(33Woontner M. Wade P.A. Bonner J. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4555-4560Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Yeast nuclear extracts (NE) were prepared and fractionated as described previously (29Haswell E.S. O'Shea E.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2817-2827Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) using yeast strain YS18 (MATα; his3–11, 15;leu2–3, 112; ura3Δ5;canR) (a gift from Dr. B. Meyhack). One microgram of reconstituted chromatin was digested with micrococcal nuclease (MNase, Worthington) in a 100-μl reaction volume following a 30-min incubation at 30 °C with various components as indicated in the Fig.5 legend. Reactions contained 1 μg of DNA, 6 mmCaCl2, proteins, and ATP as described in the figure legend, and were brought to the final volume with reconstitution buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml BSA, 0.02% Igepal). Naked DNA was digested with 0.004, 0.016, or 0.032 unit of MNase and chromatin was digested with 0.05, 0.25, and 0.75 unit of micrococcal nuclease. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 100 μl of STOP (20 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, and 250 μg/ml glycogen) and 5 μl of 2.5 mg/ml proteinase K, incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, extracted with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, and precipitated with ethanol. Two hundred nanograms of DNA was run on a 20-cm, 1.5% agarose gel in 1× TBE, Southern blotted (Turboblotter, Schleicher and Schuell), and probed with either a 169-bp MfeI toBstEII fragment representing nucleosome −2 or a 110-bpApoI to BamHI fragment representing nucleosome +1 (Fig. 1A). Before reprobing, blots were stripped by boiling in 0.1% SDS and cooling to room temperature. Transcription reactions contained naked or reconstituted DNA (500 ng), 100 μg of whole cell extract, 1% polyethylene glycol 3350, 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 100 mm potassium glutamate, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 2.5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 2 mm ATP and CTP, 25 μm UTP, 0.25 unit of RNase inhibitor (5′/3′), 30 mm phosphocreatine (Sigma), 0.042 unit of creatine kinase (Sigma), and 10 μCi of [32P]UTP in a 30-μl reaction volume. Reactions proceeded at 22 °C for 30 min. RNase T1 buffer (120 μl of 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) and 50 units of RNase T1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added, and reactions were incubated at 22 °C for 15 min. 8 μl of 10% SDS, 17.5 μl of 2.5 mg/ml proteinase K (Sigma), and [γ-32P]ATP-end-labeled recovery standard (∼1000 cpm/reaction) were added and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Fifteen micrograms of glycogen was added, and nucleic acids were ethanol-precipitated. The nucleic acid pellets were washed with 75% ethanol, resuspended in TBE-Formamide dye, and electrophoresed on an 8% polyacrylamide urea sequencing gel at 20 V/cm. The gel was dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. Two micrograms of core histones, free or assembled into chromatin, were incubated with yeast WCE from YS27 cells at 30 °C for 60 min. The reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 0.2 μCi of [14C]acetyl-CoA, and 4.5 μm acetyl-CoA. After incubation, the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide; 30:0.8, acrylamide:bis). The gels were Coomassie Blue-stained, dried, and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. Alternatively, the incubations contained 0.5 μg of core histones in chromatin and only unlabeled acetyl-CoA. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the acetylation state was determined by Western blot using anti-unacetylated H4 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). The same blotted membrane was Western-blotted again using anti-acetylated H4 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). Nucleosomes are positioned on thePHO5 promoter in vivo. To determine chromatin structure on the reconstituted PHO5 promoter, we used micrococcal nuclease digestion in conjunction with multiround primer extension analysis to footprint the nucleosomes (34Hull M.W.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5108-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The primers used for this analysis are shown in Fig.1A. We observed cleavage protection over the TATA-box and RNA start sites (Fig. 1, B and C). The protection occurred between approximately +7 and −123 bp, relative to the ATG (translational start codon) and corresponds to nucleosome −1. At the downstream end of nucleosome −1, strong protection ends at +7, with slight protection seen at +10 (Fig. 1B). No cleavage protection or enhancement is seen from +19 to +55. However, there is some ambiguity as to where protection ends due to lack of cleavage between +10 and +19 on both free DNA and chromatin samples. The upstream edge of nucleosome −1 was inferred from the protection at −123 (Fig. 1C). From −129 through −150 there are several sites of equal or stronger cleavage, defining the linker region between nucleosome −1 and −2. The lack of cleavage between −123 and −129 on both free DNA and the chromatin precludes defining the downstream edge of nucleosome −1 with greater precision. Thus, we place nucleosome −1 between +7 (±5) bp to −123 (±9) bp. The clear footprint observed with primer ml58 and primer mn5 indicates a strong"

Because Bcr-Abl is known to provide mitogenic signals through suppression of apoptosis, we investigated the effect of this oncogene product on signaling by tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a proapoptotic cytokine. We used a bcr-abl-deficient human megakaryocytic leukemia cell line MO7E and an isogenic MBA cell line stably transfected with bcr-abl. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that TNF activated the nuclear transcription factor NF-κB in MO7E cells but not in MBA cells. The impaired NF-κB activation in Bcr-Abl-expressing cells was not due to absence of the NF-κB proteins p65, p50, or p100 or of IκBα or IκBβ. Okadaic acid-induced NF-κB activation was unaffected by Bcr-Abl expression. TNF induced IκBα phosphorylation and degradation in MO7E cells but not in MBA cells. The suppression of TNF-induced NF-κB activation by Bcr-Abl was not restricted to MBA cells, because ectopic expression of Bcr-Abl in human acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells also blocked TNF-induced NF-κB activation. When examined for the TNF receptors by the radioreceptor assay, flow cytometry, or Western blot analysis, we found that Bcr-Abl expression down-regulated the expression of the TNF receptors. The RNase protection assay and Northern blot analysis revealed the transcriptional down-regulation of the TNF receptor by Bcr-Abl protein. Overall, these results indicate that ectopic expression of Bcr-Abl interferes with the TNF signaling pathway through the down-regulation of TNF receptors.

Stam K. Groffen J. de klein A. Groffen G. Nature. 1985; 315: 758Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Depending on the chromosomal fusion point, Bcr-Abl proteins are expressed in three different molecular sizes, 185, 210, and 230 kDa, and are believed to be responsible for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and chronic neutrophilic leukemia, respectively (2Kurzrock R.

Bcr-Abl expression has been implicated in the induction of resistance of chronic myelogenous leukemia to apoptosis induced by antileukemic drugs (10Bedi A. Barber J.P. Bedi G.C., El- Deiry W.S.

Blood. 1994; 83: 1179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This oncogene has been shown to block apoptosis induced by various stimuli through suppression of mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and by blocking the cytosolic pathway that leads to activation of caspase-3 (12Sanchez-Garcia I. Grutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 13Amarante-Mendes G.P. McGahon A.J. Nishioka W.K. Afar D.E. Witte O.N. Green D.R.

Additionally, Bcr-Abl has been shown to regulate c-jun gene expression, activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and the raspathway, which may also contribute to suppression of apoptosis, transformation, and tumorigenesis (15Burgess G.S.

It is thus apparent that t(9, 22) Philadelphia translocation modulates cellular signaling. In mammalian cells, various signal transduction pathways leading to survival or death are activated depending upon extracellular stimuli. How Bcr-Abl expression affects signaling to cytokines that either stimulate or inhibit cell growth is poorly understood. It has been shown that Bcr-Abl affects cell growth via autocrine production and action of IL-3 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in chronic myeloid leukemia (19Jiang X. Lopez A. Holyoake T. Eaves A. Eaves C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12804Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was recently shown that p210bcr-abl interacts with the IL-3 receptor β(c) subunit and constitutively induces its tyrosine phosphorylation (20Wilson-Rawls J. Xie S. Liu J. Laneuville P. Arlinghaus R.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3426PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we investigated the effect of ectopic expression of Bcr-Abl on TNF signaling using the human megakaryocytic leukemic cell line MO7E, which lacks Bcr-Abl, and isogenic MBA, which expresses Bcr-Abl ectopically. Our results indicate that the expression of Bcr-Abl down-regulates TNF-induced NF-κB activation and IκBα phosphorylation through the down-regulation of TNF receptors. We also demonstrate that this effect is not unique to megakaryocytic leukemic cells but also occurs in human T cells and in acute myelogenous leukemia cells. The down-regulation of the TNF receptor by Bcr-Abl occurred at the transcription level. The U-937 cell line was procured from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The human megablastic leukemic cell line MO7E, a growth factor-dependent cell line, was obtained from the Genetics Institute (Boston, MA). We used the isogenic MO7E cell line transformed with retrovirus vector containing the chimeric bcr-abl gene (MBA cell), which is growth factor-independent (8Sirard C. Laneuville P. Dick J.E. Blood. 1994; 83: 1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The stable transfection of human promyelomonocytic HL-60 with neo or with bcr-abl plasmids has been previously described from our laboratory (14Amarante-Mendes G.P. Kim C.N. Liu L. Huang Y. Perkins C.L. Green D.R. Bhalla K. Blood. 1998; 91: 1700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also transfected Jurkat cells with doxycyline-inducible Bcr-Abl plasmid. For this, bcr-abl p210 cDNA was cloned into the BamHI site of the plasmid vector pSTAR (21Zeng Q. Tan Y.H. Hong W. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 259: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid pSTAR Bcr/Abl was stably transfected into Jurkat cells using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Stable clones were screened using 500 μg/ml of G418 sulfate. After selecting the single clone by limiting-dilution method, the bcr-abl gene was induced using 5 μg/ml doxycycline. All of these cells were regularly grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics-antimycotics, except the medium for MO7E was supplemented with 200 units/ml human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Polyclonal antibodies against IκBα, IκBβ, p50, p52, p65, and PARP raised in rabbits were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal antibodies against the phospho-IκBα (Ser-32) and phospho-p42/44 MAPK were obtained from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Biotinylated anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody, anti-biotin IgG-horseradish peroxidase, and β-actin antibody were procured from Sigma. Monoclonal Bcr antibody was obtained from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA). RiboQuant multiprobe RNase protection assay kit was purchased from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Anti-p60 and anti-p80 polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits and purified by ligand affinity column chromatography. Bacterium-derived recombinant human TNF and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor purified to homogeneity with a specific activity of about 5 × 107units/mg were kindly provided by Genentech Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). RPMI 1640, fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics-antimycotics were obtained from Invitrogen. Fifty micrograms of whole-cell lysates were resolved on a 6% SDS-PAGE gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin, and probed with anti-Bcr antibody (1:1000) for 1 h. The blot was washed, exposed to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h, and finally detected by ECL reagent. To detect the phosphorylated form of Bcr-Abl, 15 μg of lysate proteins were resolved on 6% SDS-PAGE gel. The proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin, and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine biotin monoclonal antibody (1:2000). The blot was then treated with anti-biotin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and detected by ECL reagent. NF-κB activation was analyzed by EMSA as described previously (22Chaturvedi M.M. Mukhopadhyay A. Aggarwal B.B. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 319: 585Crossref Google Scholar). In brief, 8-μg nuclear extracts prepared from TNF-treated or untreated cells were incubated with 32P-end-labeled 45-mer double-stranded NF-κB oligonucleotide from human immunodeficiency virus-1 long terminal repeat (5′-TTGTTACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′; underlined are NF-κB binding sites) for 15 min at 37 °C, and the DNA-protein was complex resolved in a 6.6% native polyacrylamide gel. The specificity of binding was examined by competition with unlabeled 100-fold excess oligonucleotide and with mutant oligonucleotide. The composition and specificity of binding were also determined by supershift of the DNA-protein complex using specific and irrelevant antibodies. The antibody-treated samples of NF-κB were resolved on a 5.5% native gel. The radioactive bands from the dried gels were visualized and quantitated by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) using ImageQuant software. Thirty to fifty micrograms of cytoplasmic protein extracts, prepared as described (23Mukhopadhyay A. Manna S.K. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with 5% nonfat milk, and probed with IκBα, IκBβ, p50, p52, p65, and Ser-32-phosphorylated IκBα polyclonal antibodies (1:3000) for 1 h. The blot was washed, exposed to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h, and finally detected by chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). The c-Jun kinase assay was performed by a modified method as described earlier (24Kumar A. Aggarwal B.B. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 300: 339Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole-cell extracts were prepared from TNF-treated cells, and 100-μg cytoplasmic extracts were treated with anti-JNK1 antibodies. The immune complexes were precipitated with protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Pierce). The kinase assay was performed using washed beads as source of enzyme and glutathioneS-transferase-Jun-(1–79) as substrate (2 μg/sample) in the presence of 10 μCi of [32P]ATP per sample. The kinase reaction was carried out by incubating the mixture at 30 °C in kinase assay buffer for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by boiling beads in SDS sample buffer. Finally, protein was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The radioactive bands of the dried gel were visualized and quantitated by phosphorimaging as mentioned earlier. Human recombinant TNF was labeled with Na125I using the IODO-GEN procedure as described (25Aggarwal B.B. Eessalu T.E. Hass P.E. Nature. 1985; 318: 665Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the labeled TNF was 38 μCi/μg. The binding assays were performed by using the 96-well method as previously described (26Higuchi M. Aggarwal B.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 53Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (0.5 × 106/ml) were incubated in a binding buffer (RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum) in a flexible 96-well plate (Falcon 3911) in the presence of 2 μg/ml anti-p60 or anti-p80 antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were then exposed to 50 nm unlabeled TNF in the presence of125I-labeled TNF (0.2 × 106 cpm/sample) in a total volume of 0.1 ml. Thereafter, cells were washed three times with 200 μl of ice-cold medium. Cell-bound radioactivity was then measured by a γ counter (Packard Instrument Co.). The binding of TNF to the p60 or p80 receptor was calculated by subtracting TNF-specific binding in the absence of antibody from that in the presence of either anti-p80 or anti-p60 receptor antibodies, respectively. All results were determined in triplicate and expressed as the mean ± S.E. For analysis of TNFR expression, MO7E and MBA cell lines were harvested, centrifuged, and resuspended in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.1% sodium azide. The cells were incubated with polyclonal, affinity-purified rabbit anti-p60 and p80 antibodies (27Higuchi M. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20892-20899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Aggarwal B.B. Graff K. Samal B. Higuchi M. Liao W. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1993; 12: 149-158PubMed Google Scholar). Following a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, the cells were washed and incubated for an additional 1 h with biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig monoclonal antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). The cells were washed and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Thereafter, the cells were analyzed using a FACS Vantage flow cytometer and CellQuest acquisition and analysis programs (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). To prepare the cell extracts, MBA, MO7E, U937, and KBM-5 cells (2 × 106) were incubated for 30 min on ice in 100 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 250 mmNaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml benzamidine, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The lysates were then centrifuged for 4 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C, the supernatants were collected, and protein was measured by the Bradford method. The cell extract (100 μg) was resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked with blocking solution containing 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20. The membrane was blotted first with anti-p80 TNF receptor antibody (1:1000 dilution in blocking solution) for 1 h, washed three times (10 min each) with phosphate-buffered saline/Tween, and then blotted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG as the secondary antibody for 1 h, washed three times (10 min each), and then detected by chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). The expression of p60 and p80TNF receptor mRNA was determined by RNase protection assay using human cytokine receptor multiprobe template sets (hCR-4) as per the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, each cell type (5 × 106) was washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline to remove medium protein. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen). Ten-microgram RNA samples were hybridized with32P-labeled antisense mRNA probes against IL-1RI, IL-1RII, p60TNFR, p80TNFR, IL-6Rα, gp130, TGFβRI, TGFβRII, L32, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and digested with RNase and T1 nuclease. The protected hybridized probe fragments were resolved on 5% TBE urea polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad). The radioactive bands were visualized using a Bio-Rad Personal Molecular Imager Fx and the associated Quantity One software. Band density was quantitated using the UN-SCAN-IT gel automated digitizing system (Silk Scientific Corp., Orem, UT). The relative mRNA levels were determined by normalizing band intensities of p60 and p80TNFR with that of L32 probe. Cell cultures seeded at 1 × 106 cells/ml were incubated in 75-cm2 flasks. Total RNA was extracted from cells using Trizol reagent. For electrophoresis, 30 μg of RNA was fractionated on 1.2% agarose gels containing 2.2 m formaldehyde at 50–100 V for ∼3 h. Thereafter, the gels were rinsed with diethyl pyrocarbonate, and the RNA was transferred to Hybond nylon membranes (AmershamBiosciences). After alkaline transfer (overnight), the filter was stained with methylene blue to visualize 28 S RNA. Prehybridization was carried out at 65 °C for 1 h in a buffer containing 7% SDS, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2 (Church buffer or hybridization buffer). Filters were then hybridized for 16–20 h with p60 or p80 cDNA probes (approximate specific activity 2 × 108 cpm/μg DNA) in a hybridization buffer containing denatured salmon sperm DNA (200 μg/ml). After hybridization, membranes were washed several times at 65 °C with 40 mm sodium phosphate containing 1% SDS. The filters were exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. Xar-5 film with intensifying screens at −70 °C for 1–3 days. Equal loading of lanes was demonstrated by examination of gels after methylene blue staining of the 28 S rRNA. In this report, we investigated the effect of ectopic expression of Bcr-Abl protein on TNF-mediated cellular responses in the human megakaryoblastic cell line MO7E, which was originally derived from an acute megablastic leukemia patient. To confirm that the effects of Bcr-Abl on these cellular responses are not unique to one cell line, we also used the human acute myelogenous leukemia HL-60 cell line. We first examined the expression of Bcr-Abl protein by Western blot using Bcr-specific antibodies. As shown in Fig.1A, MO7E cells did not express Bcr-Abl protein, whereas MBA cells expressed a large amount of p210bcr-abl protein. We next examined whether this protein exhibited protein-tyrosine kinase activity. The chimeric oncogene product was tyrosine-phosphorylated as shown by phosphotyrosine Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A, lower panel). The activation of NF-κB is one of the earliest cellular responses to TNF in most cells (29Rath P.C. Aggarwal B.B. J. Clin. Immunol. 1999; 19: 350Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 30DiDonato J.A. Mercurio F. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated whether expression of Bcr-Abl modulates TNF-mediated NF-κB activation. MO7E and MBA cells were treated with 0.1 and 1 nm TNF for 30 min, and nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed by DNA-binding assay using EMSA. The results in Fig. 1B show that TNF activated NF-κB in MO7E cells almost to the maximum at 0.1 nm, but in MBA cells TNF even at 1 nm had no effect. These results indicate that Bcr-Abl down-regulates TNF-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 1B). To ensure that the activated NF-κB in MO7E cells was composed of transcriptionally active heterodimers of p50 and p65 subunits, the TNF-treated nuclear extracts were incubated with anti-p65 or anti-p50 antibodies before EMSA. The EMSA result showed that the NF-κB·DNA complex was either abrogated or supershifted when nuclear extract was treated with p50/p65 antibodies (Fig.1C). The DNA binding was not prevented by treatment of nuclear extracts with irrelevant cyclin D1 antibodies or preimmune sera, indicating specificity of the heterodimer. The specificity of the TNF-induced NF-κB·DNA complex was further confirmed by demonstrating that the binding was disrupted in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled κB-oligonucleotide but not by mutant oligonucleotide (Fig. 1C). It is possible that Bcr-Abl down-regulated the expression of NF-κB proteins, making MBA cells unable to respond to TNF-induced NF-κB activation. To determine this, we prepared cytoplasmic extracts from both cell types and examined the expression of p65 (c-Rel), p50, p100, IκBα, and IκBβ by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies. Fig.2A shows that all the NF-κB proteins are expressed to a similar level in both cell types, thus suggesting that Bcr-Abl had no effect on the expression of various NF-κB proteins. Since Bcr-Abl did not affect the expression of various NF-κB proteins, we examined whether it affected the NF-κB activation induced by other agents. For this, cells were treated with 0.5 μm okadaic acid for 4 h, and we prepared the nuclear extracts and examined the NF-κB activation by EMSA. Activation by TNF was used as a control. As shown in Fig.2B, okadaic acid activated NF-κB in both MO7E and in MBA cell lines, indicating that ectopic expression of Bcr-Abl has no effect on NF-κB activation by other agents. TNF-induced NF-κB activation requires phosphorylation of IκBα at serine residues 32 and 36 (30). We investigated whether Bcr-Abl suppresses TNF-induced NF-κB activation through suppression of IκΒα phosphorylation. Cells were treated with TNF in the presence of N-acetylleucylleucylnorlucinal (a proteasome inhibitor), which prevents the degradation of the phosphorylated form of IκBα, and then examined for nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of IκBα using specific antibodies. Fig. 2C shows that the phosphorylated form of IκBα appeared in MO7E cells but not in MBA cells, thus suggesting that Bcr-Abl prevents the phosphorylation of IκBα. TNF is also a potent activator of JNK and MAPKK (29Rath P.C. Aggarwal B.B. J. Clin. Immunol. 1999; 19: 350Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). We examined whether Bcr-Abl also suppresses the TNF-induced activation of JNK and MAPKK. Cells were treated with 0.1 and 1 nm TNF, and whole-cell extracts were prepared and analyzed for JNK by the immune complex kinase assay and for p44/p42 MAPK by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies. As Fig. 2D shows, JNK was constitutively active in MBA cells and not in MO7E cells, suggesting that Bcr-Abl expression leads to JNK activation. Interestingly, TNF failed to activate JNK in MO7E cells, whereas in MBA cells no further enhancement was found. The results in Fig. 2E show that MAPKK, which is an upstream kinase to MAPK, is also constitutively active in MBA cells but not in MO7E cells, suggesting that Bcr-Abl expression leads to MAPKK activation. Similarly, TNF was unable to activate MAPKK in MO7E cells, whereas in MBA cells the constitutive expression of MAPK was not further increased by the ligand. It is possible that the effect of Bcr-Abl on TNF-mediated cellular responses is unique to megakaryoblastic cells. To determine whether Bcr-Abl down-regulates TNF responses in other cell types, we employed human acute myelogenous leukemia HL-60 cells. These cells were transfected with bcr-abl plasmid and then examined for TNF-mediated cellular responses. As shown in Fig.3A, normal HL-60 cells did not express Bcr-Abl, but transfected cells did. As was the case for MBA cells, expression of Bcr-Abl in HL-60 cells down-regulated TNF-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 3B) without any significant loss of NF-κB proteins (Fig. 3C). Thus, the effects of Bcr-Abl on TNF signaling were not cell type-specific. TNF-induced cytotoxicity is known to require activation of caspases that cleave various cellular substrates including PARP (31Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dexit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar). To determine whether Bcr-Abl affects TNF-induced PARP cleavage, we treated cells with TNF in the presence and absence of cycloheximide (which suppresses the synthesis of antiapoptotic proteins), prepared cell extracts, and analyzed them by Western blot using anti-PARP antibodies. The results showed that TNF induced PARP cleavage in HL-60 cells but not in HL-60 cells transfected with Bcr-Abl, thus suggesting that Bcr-Abl also suppresses TNF-induced activation of caspases (Fig.3D). We also examined the effect of doxycyline-inducible Bcr-Abl in Jurkat cells on TNF-induced NF-κB activation. The results showed that TNF activated NF-κB in control cells but not in Bcr-Abl-expressing cells (data not shown). Our results so far indicated that most of the TNF-induced cellular responses were down-regulated by Bcr-Abl irrespective of cell type. It is possible that Bcr-Abl may have suppressed TNF-induced cellular responses through down-regulation of TNF receptors. Most leukemic cells express two types of TNF receptor (viz. p60 and p80) (32Hohmann H-P. Remy R. Brockhause M. VanLoon A.P.G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that most of the TNF signals are mediated through the p60 receptor. We examined the effect of Bcr-Abl expression on the cell surface expression of these two receptors using radioreceptor assays and receptor-specific antibodies. Because both types of TNF receptor are well characterized on U-937 cells, we used these cells as a control. As shown in Fig. 4A, U-937 cells expressed almost 65% p80 and 35% p60 TNF receptors. Similarly, most of the ligand binding in MO7E cells was due to p60 receptor; very little p80 receptor was found. Amazingly, MBA cells were found to lack any specific TNF binding. Thus, these results indicate that Bcr-Abl down-regulates TNF receptors in megakaryoblastic cells. The cell surface of TNF receptors was also examined by flow cytometry. These results also showed that MO7E cells express both the p60 and p80 forms of the TNF receptors, but MBA cells expressed neither of the receptors (Fig. 4B). Whether Bcr-Abl expression down-regulates the TNF receptor protein was examined by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 4C, MO7E cells expressed significant levels of TNF p80 receptor protein, and these levels were comparable with other myeloid cell lines such as U-937 and KBM-5 cells. Two different bands observed suggest a breakdown of the p80 receptor. In contrast, MBA cells did not express TNF p80 receptor protein, suggesting that Bcr-Abl expression down-regulates the TNF receptor protein. No antibody was found sensitive enough to detect the p60 receptor by Western blot analysis. Whether Bcr-Abl down-regulates the expression of TNF receptors at the transcriptional level was determined by isolating the mRNA from different cell types and performing the RNase protection assay using specific probe kits. Fig. 5, Aand B, shows that MO7E cells expressed the mRNA for p60 and p80 receptor, and the expression for p60 was higher than p80. The expression of Bcr-Abl in MO7E eliminated the expression of mRNA for both p60 and p80 receptors. The effects of Bcr-Abl were not unique to TNF receptors, in as much as the mRNA for IL-6Rα and TGFβRII were also completely down-regulated in Bcr-Abl-expressing MBA cells. These results indicate that Bcr-Abl can down-regulate the mRNA for various cytokine receptors. The down-regulation of the mRNA by Bcr-Abl expression was further confirmed by Northern blot analysis. The results in Fig. 5Cindicate that MO7E expressed the mRNA for both the p60 and p80 form of the TNF receptors, whereas MBA cells did not express either of the receptor mRNAs. In this report, we investigated the effect of Bcr-Abl on TNF-mediated NF-κB activation. Our results show that Bcr-Abl suppresses TNF-induced NF-κB activation, IκBα phosphorylation, and caspase-mediated PARP cleavage, and this suppression correlates with down-regulation of TNF receptor expression both at the mRNA and protein levels. Our results also indicate that these effects are not cell type-specific, since Bcr-Abl was effective both in megakaryoblastic, acute myelogenous leukemia cells and in Jurkat T cells. Our results indicate that Bcr-Abl by itself had no effect on constitutive NF-κB activation in either of the human leukemic cell lines. These results, however, differ from two earlier reports of Reuther et al. (33Reuther J.Y. Reuther G.W. Cortez D. Pendergast A.M. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 968Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) and Hamdane et al. (34Hamdane M. David-Cordonnier M-H. D'Halluin J.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), which showed that Bcr-Abl causes constitutive NF-κB activation. Both of these investigators used murine myeloid 32D and DA1 cell lines. Whether the difference in our results from those previously reported is due to the cell line is not clear. We used three different human cell lines and found similar results. Rather than stimulating NF-κB by itself, Bcr-Abl suppressed TNF-induced NF-κB activation in our study. This suppression occurred through the inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation needed for NF-κB activation. This is the first report to our knowledge to indicate that Bcr-Abl can modulate the signaling of any cytokine other than IL-3. IL-3 is known to be produced by Bcr-Abl- expressing leukemic cells and acts as an autocrine growth factor (19Jiang X. Lopez A. Holyoake T. Eaves A. Eaves C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12804Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Bcr-Abl can interact with the IL-3 receptor β-chain and induce constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation (20Wilson-Rawls J. Xie S. Liu J. Laneuville P. Arlinghaus R.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3426PubMed Google Scholar). We found that ectopic expression of Bcr-Abl by itself activated JNK. This result is in agreement with previous reports, one by Raitanoet al. (16Raitano A.B. Halpern J.R. Hambuch T.M. Sawyers C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11746Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) on human embryonic kidney cells and one by Burgess et al. (15Burgess G.S. Williamson E.A. Cripe L.D. Jackson-Litz S. Bhatt J.A. Stanley K. Stewart M.J. Kraft A.S. Nakshatri H. Boswell H.S. Blood. 1998; 92: 2450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on MO7E cells. Whereas Bcr-Abl expression leads to constitutive activation of JNK in MO7E cells, TNF did not. That these cells are insensitive to TNF-induced JNK activation is not due to lack of TNF receptors. Furthermore, these receptors are functional, since they activated NF-κB in MO7E cells. It is possible that TNF receptor-associated factor 2, which is needed for JNK activation but not for NF-κB activation, is either not expressed or not functional due to the expression of TNF receptor-associated factor 2 inhibitors in parental MO7E cells. Our results also indicate that Bcr-Abl suppressed TNF-induced cytotoxicity. TNF was not highly cytotoxic to MO7E cells. The suppression of TNF-induced cytotoxicity in our studies was consistent with down-regulation of TNF-activated caspase activation. Several reports indicate that Bcr-Abl provides a growth advantage to the cells by blocking apoptosis (35Evans C.A. Owen-Lynch P.J. Whetton A.D. Dive C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1735PubMed Google Scholar, 36Gambacorti-Passerini C. le Coutre P. Mologni L. Fanelli M. Bertazzoli C. Marchesi E., Di Nicola M. Biondi A. Corneo G. Belotti D. Pogliani E. Lydon N.B. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 1997; 23: 380Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 37Dan S. Naito M. Tsuruo T. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 710Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 38Laneuville P. Timm M. Hudson A.T. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1360PubMed Google Scholar), thus promoting transformation and tumorigenesis. However, there is very little known about how Bcr-Abl modulates cytokine signaling. IL-3 is known to be produced by Bcr-Abl-expressing leukemic cells and acts as an autocrine growth factor (19Jiang X. Lopez A. Holyoake T. Eaves A. Eaves C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12804Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Additionally, Bcr-Abl may also provide growth advantage to the leukemic cells through suppression of cytokine-mediated apoptosis. Alternatively, it is possible that Bcr-Abl may induce antiapoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2, as reported previously (12Sanchez-Garcia I. Grutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), which could mediate the suppression of TNF-induced apoptosis. Indeed, we did find that Bcr-Abl-expressing MBA cells co-express Bcl-xL, whereas MO7E did not. 2A. Mukhopadhyay, S. Shishodia, J. Suttles, K. Brittingham, B. Lamothe, R. Nimmanapalli, K. N. Bhalla, and B. B. Aggarwal, unpublished data. Our results indicate that most of the effects of Bcr-Abl on TNF signaling can be explained through the down-regulation of TNF receptors. The down-regulation of death receptors is a novel mechanism through which Bcr-Abl could provide a proliferative advantage to the leukemic cells. Our preliminary studies indicate that it is not the TNF receptor alone, but the mRNA for TGF-βRII and IL-6 receptor, that are also down-regulated by Bcr-Abl. IL-6 has inhibitory effects on human and murine leukemic cell lines in vitro (40Onozaki K. Akiyama Y. Okano A. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3602PubMed Google Scholar). By suppressing transcription of IL-6Rα, Bcr-Abl-expressing cells escape the growth-inhibitory effects of IL-6. The role of TGFβ as a negative autocrine growth factor for tumorigenesis has been reported (41Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Nature. 1985; 313: 745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). Most normal cells are growth-inhibited by TGFβ. However, tumor cells lose their responsiveness to TGFβ in several ways (42Roberts A.B. Thompson N.L. Heine U. Flanders C. Sporn M.B. Br. J. Cancer. 1988; 57: 594Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). One of the possible ways by which tumor cells protect themselves from inhibitory effects of TGFβ is by losing TGFβRIIs (39Arteaga C.L. Tandon A.K. von Hoff D.D. Osborne C.K. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 3898PubMed Google Scholar, 43Keller J.R. Sing G.K. Ellingsworth L.R. Ruscetti F.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 39: 79Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We believe that Bcr-Abl-expressing leukemic cells could escape suppression of growth also by down-modulation of TGFβ receptors. Previously, Bcr-Abl had been shown to interact with the IL-3 receptor β-chain and induce constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation (20Wilson-Rawls J. Xie S. Liu J. Laneuville P. Arlinghaus R.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3426PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies suggest that down-regulation of receptors involved in antiproliferative effects may be another mechanism though which Bcr-Abl provides a growth advantage. Overall, the studies described here provide a novel mechanism through which Bcr-Abl may interfere with cytokine signaling, especially those involved in suppression of cell growth. Whether TNF receptors and TNF signaling are down-regulated in samples from chronic myelogenous leukemia or AML patients should be investigated in the future. We thank Dr. Jian Ni and Bharati Matta for assistance with Northern and RNA protection assay analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2066706367,"Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an inducible enzyme that plays an important role in several pathophysiological processes, including inflammation, angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis. We have recently observed that COX-2 induction is restrained in proliferating fibroblasts. The mechanism by which this occurs is unclear. Here, we report the detection and isolation from the conditioned medium of proliferating fibroblasts a factor that suppressed COX-2 expression. This factor, which was named cytoguardin, suppressed COX-2 protein levels induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in fibroblasts and LPS-induced COX-2 protein levels and promoter activities in human endothelial cells and murine RAW 264.7 cells in a comparable concentration-dependent manner. It inhibited COX-2 expression induced by angiogenic factors and endothelial tube formation induced by angiogenic factors and colon cancer cell medium. These findings provide evidence for the control of COX-2 transcription by an endogenous cellular factor."
https://openalex.org/W2049249108,"Mcm3 is a subunit of the hexameric MCM2-7 complex required for the initiation and elongation of DNA replication in eukaryotes. We have characterized two mutant alleles, mcm3-1 and mcm3-10, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and showed that they are defective at different steps of the replication initiation process. Mcm3-10 contains a P118L substitution that compromises its interaction with Mcm5 and the recruitment of Mcm3 and Mcm7 to a replication origin. P118 is conserved between Mcm3, Mcm4, Mcm5, and Mcm7. An identical substitution of this conserved residue in Mcm5 (P83L of mcm5-bob1) strengthens the interaction between Mcm3 and Mcm5 and allows cells to enter S phase independent of Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase (Hardy, C.

Mcm3-1 contains a G246E mutation that diminishes the efficiency of replication initiation (Yan, H., Merchant, A. M., and Tye, B. K. (1993) Genes Dev. 7, 2149–2160) but not its interaction with Mcm5 or recruitment of the MCM2-7 complex to replication origin. These observations indicate that Mcm3-10 is defective in a step before, and Mcm3-1 is defective in a step after the recruitment of the MCM2-7 complex to replication origins. Mcm3 is a subunit of the hexameric MCM2-7 complex required for the initiation and elongation of DNA replication in eukaryotes. We have characterized two mutant alleles, mcm3-1 and mcm3-10, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and showed that they are defective at different steps of the replication initiation process. Mcm3-10 contains a P118L substitution that compromises its interaction with Mcm5 and the recruitment of Mcm3 and Mcm7 to a replication origin. P118 is conserved between Mcm3, Mcm4, Mcm5, and Mcm7. An identical substitution of this conserved residue in Mcm5 (P83L of mcm5-bob1) strengthens the interaction between Mcm3 and Mcm5 and allows cells to enter S phase independent of Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase (Hardy, C. F., Dryga, O., Pahl, P. M. B., and Sclafani, R. A. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 94, 3151–3155). Mcm3-1 contains a G246E mutation that diminishes the efficiency of replication initiation (Yan, H., Merchant, A. M., and Tye, B. K. (1993) Genes Dev. 7, 2149–2160) but not its interaction with Mcm5 or recruitment of the MCM2-7 complex to replication origin. These observations indicate that Mcm3-10 is defective in a step before, and Mcm3-1 is defective in a step after the recruitment of the MCM2-7 complex to replication origins. pre-replication complexes 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole fluorescence-activated cell sorting wild type temperature-sensitive To ensure precise duplication of the nuclear genome, the initiation of DNA synthesis from each replication origin is restricted to no more than once in a mitotic cell cycle. At the heart of this elaborate regulatory mechanism is the temporal separation of the establishment of the pre-replication complexes (pre-RC)1 at replication origins from late M through G1 phase and the activation of the pre-RC to initiate DNA synthesis in S phase (3Diffley J.F.X. Cocker J.H. Dowell S.J. Rowley A. Cell. 1994; 78: 303-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 4Lei M. Tye B.K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1447-1454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A key component of the pre-RC is a complex of six conserved proteins known as the MCM2-7 complex (5Tye B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 649-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The recruitment of the MCM2-7 complex to an origin, a process often referred to as “replication licensing” (6Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Nature. 1988; 332: 546-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), signals the completion of the pre-RC assembly and establishes the competence of the origin for the initiation of DNA synthesis (3Diffley J.F.X.

Nature. 1998; 395: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) that result in the conversion of the MCM2-7 complex into an active helicase (12Geraghty D.S. Ding M. Heintz N.H. Pederson D.S.

Science. 2000; 288: 1643-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Thus, the regulation of the initiation of DNA replication can be viewed as a two-step process involving the assembly and activation of the MCM2-7 complex at replication origins (4Lei M. Tye B.K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1447-1454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular details for the assembly and activation of the MCM2-7 complex are not well understood. Although MCM2-7 hexamers have been purified from various organisms, an active heterohexameric helicase remains to be identified (14Schwacha A. Bell S.P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1093-1104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 15Adachi Y. Usukura J. Yanagida M.

The recruitment of the MCM2-7 complex to replication origins is dependent on the chromatin binding of the origin recognition complex and Cdc6 (17Coleman T.R. Carpenter P.B. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 18Donovan S. Harwood J. Drury L.S. Diffley J.F.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recent studies show that Cdt1 and Mcm10/Dna43 also play important roles in the chromatin binding of the complex (20Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Dhar S.K. Cvetic C. Walter J.C. Dutta A.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 913-926PubMed Google Scholar). An important question is whether the MCM2-7 complex is recruited to a replication origin as a pre-assembled heterohexamer or assembled on the origin de novo by the sequential recruitment of subcomplex intermediates such as the Mcm(3+5), Mcm(4+6+7), and Mcm(2+2) (15Adachi Y. Usukura J. Yanagida M. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 24Prokhorova T.A. Blow J.J. J. Biol.

In vitro replication studies using Xenopus egg extracts indicate that the establishment of the pre-replication complex or “licensing” is achieved only with pre-assembled heterohexamers (24Prokhorova T.A. Blow J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2491-2498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, similar studies suggest that individual MCM subunits or subcomplexes bind stepwise to chromatin during the licensing reaction to form stable hexamers (27Maiorano D. Lemaitre J.M. Mechali M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8426-8431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The characterization of mcm mutants defective in the recruitment of the MCM2-7 complex to replication origins should provide useful information on the process of establishing the pre-replication complex. The activation of the MCM2-7 complex in the S phase requires the coordinated actions of S phase cyclin-dependent kinases (28Schwob E. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1160-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 29Nasmyth K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 30Zou L. Stillman B.

Cell. 1997; 90: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) and the Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase (32Jackson A.L. Pahl P.M.B. Harrison K. Rosamond J. Sclafani R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2899-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 33Pasero P. Braguglia D. Gasser S.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1504-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 34Johnston L.H.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2111-2117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cyclin-dependent kinases are believed to serve as global S phase promoting factors (36Stillman B. Science. 1996; 274: 1659-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 37Nasmyth K. Science. 1996; 274: 1643-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), whereas the Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase specifically phosphorylates origin-bound Mcm2 (9Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Young M.R. Kihara M. Sugino A. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3365-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 10Bousset K. Diffley J.F.X.

The phosphorylation of Mcm2 is believed to induce a conformational change in the MCM2-7 complex essential for the melting of DNA at the origin (12Geraghty D.S. Ding M. Heintz N.H. Pederson D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18011-18021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and the recruitment of Cdc45 and DNA polymerases (30Zou L. Stillman B. Science. 1998; 280: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 31Tanaka T. Knapp D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1997; 90: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a MCM5 mutant allele, mcm5-bob1, bypasses the requirement of the Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase for mitotic DNA replication (1Hardy C.F. Dryga O. Pahl P.M.B. Sclafani R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3151-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 40Sclafani R.A. Tecklenburg M. Pierce A. Genetics. 2002; 161: 47-57PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that this mutation may induce a conformational change in the complex similar to that induced by the Cdc7-Dbf4 phosphorylation of Mcm2. Understanding the changes induced by the mcm5-bob1 mutation may provide valuable information on the activation of the MCM2-7 complex. In this study, we report the characterization of two mcm3mutant alleles. 1) mcm3-10 is defective in recruiting Mcm3-10 and Mcm7 to a replication origin. 2) mcm3-1 is defective in the activation of the MCM2-7 complex. Mcm3-10 contains an amino acid substitution identical to that found in Mcm5-bob1 in a conserved residue. Our results suggest that altered interactions between Mcm3 and Mcm5 caused by mutations in this conserved residue contribute to the different replication defects in the respective mutants. To map the mcm3-1 and mcm3-10 mutations, the mutant strains R61-3C (MAΤα leu2 ura3 his4 trp1 mcm3-1) (41Gibson S.I. Surosky R.T. Tye B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5707-5720Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and LRD11-5A (MATa leu2 ura3 ade1 trp1 mcm3-10) (42Roberts L.A. Characterization and Extragenic Suppressor Analysis of mcm3-10, a Mutant Defective in DNA Replication InitiationDoctoral dissertation. Cornell University, Ithaca, NY1999Google Scholar), a derivative of D273-11A (MAΤα ade1 his1 trp2 dbf10–1) (43Johnston L.H. Thomas A.P.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1982; 186: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), were transformed with linearized plasmids containingMCM3 (pRS314.MCM3) or various portions of theMCM3 generated by restriction enzyme digestion (gapped plasmids) (Fig. 4b). Transformants containing repaired plasmids were selected by growth on selective plates. Transformants that failed to grow at 37 °C contained plasmids carrying the temperature-sensitive (ts) alleles. PlasmidspRS314.mcm3-1 and pRS314.mcm3-10 were recovered from MCM3ΔRS transformants of R61-3C and LRD11-5A, respectively. The mutations were determined by sequencing the recovered plasmids and confirmed by sequencing theEcoRI-SacII fragment PCR-amplified from genomic DNA of R61-3C and LRD11-5A. Homologous sequences were aligned using the “ClustalW algorithm” Lasergene 99 (DNAStar, Madison, WI) with a gap penalty of 10 and a gap length penalty of 10. A MCM3integration plasmid was constructed as follows: the MCM3gene was recovered from YCP50.MCM3 (41Gibson S.I. Surosky R.T. Tye B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5707-5720Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and cloned into a modified version of the integration vector pRS306 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at a SalI site (pRS306.MCM3). TheEcoRI-SacII fragment in pRS306.MCM3was then replaced with that from pRS314.mcm3-1 and pRS314.mcm3-10, respectively, to generatepRS306.mcm3-1 and pRS306.mcm3-10. These plasmids were digested with BamHI and integrated into theMCM3 locus of the yeast strains BJ2168 (MATa pep4 prc1prb1 ura3 leu2 trp1) and W303a (MATa ade2 ura3 leu2 trp1can1). The transformants were grown on 5′-fluoroorotic acid plates to select for strains containing either MCM3 ormcm3. Isogenic mcm3-10 and mcm3-1mutants were selected by their inability to grow on YEPD-rich medium at 37 °C and confirmed by sequencing the mcm3 loci in the respective mutant strains. The arrest phenotypes in these strains are similar to their respective original source strains R61-3C and D273-11A. 4′,6-Diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 0.1 μg/ml) staining was performed as described previously (44Yan H. Gibson S. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 944-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Images were obtained with a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope (Nikon, Japan) under bright and UV light, respectively. To synchronize cell cultures, α-factor (10 μg/ml) or nocodazole (20 μg/ml) was added to log phase cultures (A600= ∼0.5), respectively, and incubated at 25 °C for 2–3 h. To release from cell cycle arrest, cells were spun down and washed three times with pre-warmed YEPD medium. FACS was performed as described previously (45Hutter K.J. Eipel H.E. J. Microbiol. Serol. 1978; 44: 269-282Google Scholar) using Cytox Green at 40 μg/ml (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as the fluorescence dye. The MCM3 cdc7Δ/mcm3-10 CDC7 diploid strain was constructed by crossing D273-11A (MAΤα ade1 his1 trp1 mcm3-10) with RO4 (MATa cdc7::HIS3 his3Δ1 ade1 ade2 ura3 trp1+pRO5: URA3 CDC7). The diploid strain was grown on 5′-fluoroorotic acid plate to select for cells without the plasmid pRO5-URA3 CDC7. Sporulation and tetrad dissection were performed following standard yeast genetics protocols (46Sherman F. Wakem P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 38-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Spores geminated at 30 °C were incubated at 37 °C for analysis of thets phenotype. W303a (WT) and the mcm3 mutant cells grown in YEPD medium at 25 °C were first synchronized at M phase with nocodazole for 2 h and then released into YEPD medium containing α-factor (10 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 1.5 h. Formaldehyde cross-linking was then performed as described previously (23Homesley L. Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Sawyer S. Christensen T. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 913-926PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linked cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES 7.5, 140 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-Orc2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Mcm3 (2Yan H. Merchant A.M. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2149-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), anti-Mcm7 (47Fitch M.J. Flow Cytometric Determinations of Cellular Substances in Algae Bacteria, Mold and YeastsDoctoral dissertation. Cornell University, Ithaca, NY2001Google Scholar), or anti-hemagglutinin antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer, twice with lysis buffer plus 0.5 m NaCl, twice with wash buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.25 m LiCl, 0.75% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mm EDTA), and twice with TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA). Immunoprecipitates were then resuspended in TE buffer with 1% SDS and incubated at 65 °C overnight to reverse protein DNA cross-link. DNA samples were purified using Qiagen PCR purification columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and PCR was carried out using primers 5′-atggcgttattggtgttgatgta-3′/5′-ttgcggtgaaatggtaaaagtc-3′ for ARS1 and 5′-aggggcagcggtttgtgag-3′/5′-tggagctgcttctacgactactga-3′ for ATP11, a gene that encodes a chaperone for the assembly of the F1-ATPase at the following conditions: twice (94 °C for 2 min, 96 °C for 1 min, and 54 °C for 4 min); 28 times (94 °C for 1 min and 54 °C for 1.5 min); and once (70 °C for 5 min). PCR products were incubated with 1:10000 dilution of Vistra Green (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, NJ) and separated on 3% agarose gel. Fluorescent signals were quantitated using Molecular Dynamics Storm 840 PhosphorImager and IMAGEQUANT software. The relative efficiency of origin binding of a protein in a particular strain was calculated as the ratio of ARS1/ATP11 amplified from the immunoprecipitate normalized to the ratio of ARS1/ATP11 amplified from the control immunoprecipitate. Two-hybrid analysis was performed as described previously (48Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Tye B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5081-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The interactions between Mcm5 and Mcm3 proteins were measured as the β-galactosidase activities produced in the yeast two-hybrid strains. pBTM.MCM3, pGAD.MCM3, and pGAD.MCM5 are described in previous studies (48Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Tye B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5081-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). pBTM.mcm5-bob1 (pCH816) and pGAD.mcm-bob1 (pCH825) are gifts from Chris Hardy. pBTM.mcm3-1 and pBTM.mcm3-10 were constructed by replacing theEcoRI-BamHI fragment in pBTM.MCM3 with those recovered from pRS314.mcm3-1 and pRS314.mcm3-10. Whole cell lysates were prepared and probed by anti-Mcm3, anti-LexA, and anti-actin antibodies as described previously (23Homesley L. Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Sawyer S. Christensen T. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 913-926PubMed Google Scholar, 48Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Tye B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5081-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A mcm3-10 strain LRD11-5A (42Roberts L.A. Characterization and Extragenic Suppressor Analysis of mcm3-10, a Mutant Defective in DNA Replication InitiationDoctoral dissertation. Cornell University, Ithaca, NY1999Google Scholar) was transformed with a YEp24-based genomic library (49Nasmyth K.A. Tatchell K. Cell. 1980; 19: 753-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and plated on 25 selective plates. One plate was incubated at 30 °C to estimate the total number of transformants generated. The other 24 were incubated to select for growth at 37 °C. The plasmids from these suppressors were isolated, and the identities of the clones were determined by sequencing analysis. MCM3 is a founding member of the MCM2-7 gene family. It was initially cloned through complementation of the ts growth defect ofmcm3-1 (41Gibson S.I. Surosky R.T. Tye B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5707-5720Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 50Maine G.T. Sinha P. Tye B.-K. Genetics. 1984; 106: 365-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a mutant allele that shows a diminished efficiency of replication initiation (2Yan H. Merchant A.M. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2149-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, at the restrictive temperature, the mcm3-1 cells arrest with a largely replicated genome (41Gibson S.I. Surosky R.T. Tye B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5707-5720Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Another ts mcm3 allele, mcm3-10 also known as dbf10, is unable to initiate DNA synthesis (43Johnston L.H. Thomas A.P.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1982; 186: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 51Toyn J.H. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5312-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To gain insights into the roles of Mcm3 at different steps of the replication initiation process, we characterized replication defects of these two alleles using isogenic strains (“Experimental Procedures”). At the restrictive temperature (37 °C), both mcm3-10 and mcm3-1 cells arrest as predominantly large budded cells (85%) with undivided nuclei (Fig. 1a). Inmcm3-10, the nuclei are localized near the bud neck in the mother cells (Fig. 1a). The migration of nuclei to the bud neck is normally observed before nuclear division but after the completion of DNA synthesis. In mcm3-1, the nuclei are randomly localized within the mother cells (Fig. 1a), consistent with the incomplete replication of the genome in these cells (41Gibson S.I. Surosky R.T. Tye B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5707-5720Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 44Yan H. Gibson S. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 944-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, FACS shows that mcm3-10 cells arrest with DNA contents close to one copy of the haploid genome at the restrictive temperature (Fig. 1b), suggesting a failure to commence DNA replication (51Toyn J.H. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5312-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) even though the nuclei have assumed a bud neck position. As observed previously (41Gibson S.I. Surosky R.T. Tye B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5707-5720Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 44Yan H. Gibson S. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 944-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), mcm3-1mutant cells replicate most if not all of the genome at the restrictive temperature (Fig. 1b), a phenotype shared by several other DNA replication initiation mutants (9Lei M.

The late S phase arrest is believed to be the effect of a combination of leaky initiation defects and incomplete replication of the genome in these mutants (41Gibson S.I. Surosky R.T. Tye B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5707-5720Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 44Yan H. Gibson S. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 944-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A slight increase in the DNA contents of both G1 and G2/M phase cells was observed in all three strains after the temperature shift, probably the result of continuous amplification of mitochondrial DNA. The FACS results suggest that mcm3-10 and mcm3-1 are defective at two different steps in the replication initiation process, mcm3-10 is unable to initiate DNA synthesis and mcm3-1 is unable to complete DNA synthesis. To determine whether recruitment or activation of the MCM2-7 complex is compromised in the mutants, we characterized their respective cell cycle block relative to START, a point in late G1 phase when the MCM2-7 complex has already been recruited to the replication origin but not yet activated (54Piatti S. Bohm T. Cocker J.H. Diffley J.F.X. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1516-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Cells grown at 25 °C were first synchronized at START by α-factor and then released into fresh medium at 37 °C. Cell cycle progression during the course of the treatment was monitored by FACS analysis. The results shown in Fig. 2 indicate thatmcm3-10 cells complete one round of DNA replication and then arrest in the next cell cycle with 1C DNA content after release from α-factor. However, under the same conditions, mcm3-1 cells arrest at the late S phase of the same cell cycle. These results suggest that inactivating Mcm3-10 after the MCM2-7 complex has been recruited to the replication origin does not prevent the initiation or completion of DNA synthesis until the next cell cycle. In contrast, the inactivation of Mcm3-1 after the recruitment of the MCM2-7 complex compromises the initiation (2Yan H. Merchant A.M. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2149-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) as well as the completion of DNA replication. If Mcm3-10 fails to execute an event before the recruitment of the MCM2-7 complex at replication origin, the binding of the complex to origin will probably be affected. To test this hypothesis, the association of Mcm3 and Mcm7 with ARS1 inmcm3-10 cells was analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis (55Jackson V. Cell. 1978; 15: 945-954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 56Hecht A. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Grunstein M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 469-479PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type and both mcm3 mutants were first synchronized in M phase with nocodazole and then released into fresh medium containing α-factor at 37 °C for formaldehyde cross-linking. Cell lysates were prepared for immunoprecipitation using anti-Mcm3 or Mcm7 antibodies. Immunoprecipitation was also performed using polyclonal anti-Orc2 and hemagglutinin antibodies as positive or negative controls. The results indicate that the binding of Orc2 to ARS1 is not affected by either mutant allele (Fig.3a, lanes 1–3, and b), consistent with the observation that the MCM2-7 complex is recruited after origin recognition complex is bound to origin DNA (17Coleman T.R. Carpenter P.B. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 18Donovan S. Harwood J. Drury L.S. Diffley J.F.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5611-5616Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Mcm3-1 does not appear to significantly affect its own binding or the binding of Mcm7 to ARS1 compared with Mcm3 in wild type cells (Fig. 3a, lanes 4, 5 and 7, 8 and b), supporting the hypothesis that Mcm3-1 is fully functional during the recruitment of the MCM2-7 complex. In contrast, the association of both Mcm3-10 and Mcm7 with ARS1 is considerably reduced in mcm3-10 mutants (Fig.3a, lanes 4, 6 and 7, 9, and b), consistent with a failure to execute an event that is required for the recruitment of the MCM2-7 complex. The wild type and mutant Mcm3 proteins were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 3c). To determine the structural change in Mcm3-10 that impedes the recruitment of Mcm3 and Mcm7, we identified the amino acid substitutions in the mcm3 alleles. The ts growth defect of both mcm3 alleles can be rescued by aMCM3-containing plasmid (Fig.4a). To map the mutations in the mcm3 alleles, a series of mcm3 deletions (gapped plasmids) were analyzed for their ability to rescue the growth defect of the mutants at 37 °C (Fig. 4b) (57Shortle D. Novick P. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4889-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). All butmcm3ΔSB failed to rescue the ts phenotype ofmcm3-1 or mcm3-10. Thus, both mutations are localized within the 1 kilobase pair ofEcoRI-SacII fragment in the open reading frame ofMCM3 (Fig. 4b). The repaired plasmids containingmcm3-1 or mcm3-10 were recovered frommcm3ΔRS transformants for sequencing analysis.mcm3-1 is a G to A mutation resulting in a glycine to glutamate substitution at residue 246 (G246E), and mcm3-10is a C to T mutation resulting in a proline to leucine substitution at residue 118 (P118L) (Fig. 4c). Both mutations are N-terminal to the ATPase domain conserved in the Mcm2-7 proteins (5Tye B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 649-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). When these mutations were reintroduced into the yeast genome at theMCM3 locus, the resulting strains exhibited phenotypes of the original mutant alleles (“Experimental Procedures”). A comparison of the amino acid sequences of MCM proteins from different species indicates that Gly246 (mcm3-1) is conserved in the Mcm3 from yeast to human but not between members of the Mcm2-7 family (Fig. 4, c and d). On the other hand, Pro118 (mcm3-10) appears to be conserved in Mcm3, Mcm"
