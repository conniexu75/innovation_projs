https://openalex.org/W2191292005,"The functional and molecular similarities and distinctions between human and murine astrocytes are poorly understood. Here, we report the development of an immunopanning method to acutely purify astrocytes from fetal, juvenile, and adult human brains and to maintain these cells in serum-free cultures. We found that human astrocytes have abilities similar to those of murine astrocytes in promoting neuronal survival, inducing functional synapse formation, and engulfing synaptosomes. In contrast to existing observations in mice, we found that mature human astrocytes respond robustly to glutamate. Next, we performed RNA sequencing of healthy human astrocytes along with astrocytes from epileptic and tumor foci and compared these to human neurons, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells (available at http://www.brainrnaseq.org). With these profiles, we identified novel human-specific astrocyte genes and discovered a transcriptome-wide transformation between astrocyte precursor cells and mature post-mitotic astrocytes. These data represent some of the first cell-type-specific molecular profiles of the healthy and diseased human brain."

Here, we investigate the impact of targeted inhibition of the first step in TMAO generation, commensal microbial TMA production, on diet-induced atherosclerosis. A structural analog of choline, 3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol (DMB), is shown to non-lethally inhibit TMA formation from cultured microbes, to inhibit distinct microbial TMA lyases, and to both inhibit TMA production from physiologic polymicrobial cultures (e.g., intestinal contents, human feces) and reduce TMAO levels in mice fed a high-choline or L-carnitine diet. DMB inhibited choline diet-enhanced endogenous macrophage foam cell formation and atherosclerotic lesion development in apolipoprotein e−/− mice without alterations in circulating cholesterol levels. The present studies suggest that targeting gut microbial production of TMA specifically and non-lethal microbial inhibitors in general may serve as a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of cardiometabolic diseases.

Recent studies suggest that gut microbes are participants in atherosclerosis development. Specifically, choline, phosphatidylcholine, and carnitine—trimethylamine (TMA)-containing nutrients abundant in foods such as meat, egg yolks, and high-fat dairy products—serve as dietary precursors for TMA N-oxide (TMAO) generation in mice and humans, a metabolite that accelerates atherosclerosis in animal models (Koeth et al., 2013Koeth R.A.

TMAO-lowering interventions are, thus, of considerable interest for their potential therapeutic benefit (Brown and Hazen, 2015Brown J.M. Hazen S.L. The gut microbial endocrine organ: bacterially derived signals driving cardiometabolic diseases.Annu. Rev. Med. 2015; 66: 343-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). TMAO formation in mammals occurs via a two-step metaorganismal pathway (Koeth et al., 2013Koeth R.A. Wang Z. Levison B.S. Buffa J.A. Org E. Sheehy B.T. Britt E.B. Fu X. Wu Y.

Chung Y.M. et al.Gut flora metabolism of phosphatidylcholine promotes cardiovascular disease.Nature. 2011; 472: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (3462) Google Scholar). Specifically, following nutrient ingestion, gut microbes form TMA, and then host hepatic flavin monooxygenases (FMOs) catalyze the conversion of TMA into TMAO (Koeth et al., 2013Koeth R.A. Wang Z. Levison B.S. Buffa J.A. Org E. Sheehy B.T. Britt E.B. Fu X. Wu Y. Li L. et al.Intestinal microbiota metabolism of L-carnitine, a nutrient in red meat, promotes atherosclerosis.Nat.

Recent studies highlight the importance of both TMAO and host hepatic FMO3, the primary FMO responsible for TMAO production, as important regulators in host lipid and sterol metabolism, as well as atherosclerosis development (Bennett et al., 2013Bennett B.J. de Aguiar Vallim T.Q.

In addition, recent microbial transfer studies confirm that both choline-diet-enhanced atherosclerosis susceptibility and TMA/TMAO formation are transmissible traits (Gregory et al., 2015Gregory J.C. Buffa J.A. Org E. Wang Z. Levison B.S. Zhu W. Wagner M.A. Bennett B.J. Li L. DiDonato J.A. et al.Transmission of atherosclerosis susceptibility with gut microbial transplantation.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 5647-5660Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the concept of “drugging the microbiome” to inhibit the meta-organismal pathway responsible for TMAO generation is of interest as a potential therapeutic approach for prevention of atherosclerosis. Toward that end, recent studies confirm that suppression of the host enzyme, FMO3, through an antisense oligonucleotide-based approach, results in the reduction of both circulating TMAO levels and diet-enhanced atherosclerosis in animal models (Miao et al., 2015Miao J.

However, while numerous beneficial effects with FMO3 inhibition have been noted, FMO3 inhibition is also accompanied by several untoward side effects, including hepatic inflammation (Shih et al., 2015Shih D.M.

It is also well established that humans with genetic defects in FMO3 suffer from fish odor syndrome, due to the accumulation of TMA and its noxious odor (Cashman et al., 2003Cashman J.R. Camp K. Fakharzadeh S.S. Fennessey P.V. Hines R.N. Mamer O.A. Mitchell S.C. Nguyen G.P. Schlenk D. Smith R.L. et al.Biochemical and clinical aspects of the human flavin-containing monooxygenase form 3 (FMO3) related to trimethylaminuria.Curr. Drug Metab. 2003; 4: 151-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), reducing the appeal of FMO3 as a potential therapeutic target for inhibition. Reduction in TMAO levels by non-lethally targeting the gut microbial pathway(s) involved in TMA production has not yet been explored as a potential therapeutic approach to inhibit atherosclerosis. Anaerobic choline degradation is believed to serve as the major source of TMA formation within the intestines (Bain et al., 2005Bain M.A. Fornasini G. Evans A.M. Trimethylamine: metabolic, pharmacokinetic and safety aspects.Curr. Drug Metab. 2005; 6: 227-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2011Wang Z. Klipfell E. Bennett B.J. Koeth R. Levison B.S. Dugar B. Feldstein A.E. Britt E.B. Fu X. Chung Y.M. et al.Gut flora metabolism of phosphatidylcholine promotes cardiovascular disease.Nature. 2011; 472: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (3462) Google Scholar). Therefore, we focused initial drug screening efforts on the identification of potential inhibitors of microbial TMA production from choline- or so-called choline-TMA lyase activity. The cleavage of the C-N bond of choline to form TMA and acetaldehyde was reported with extracts of Proteus mirabilis, a known human commensal microorganism that is easily cultured, nearly 3 decades ago (Sandhu and Chase, 1986Sandhu S.S. Chase Jr., T. Aerobic degradation of choline by Proteus mirabilis: enzymatic requirements and pathway.Can. J. Microbiol. 1986; 32: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Therefore, we initially used P. mirabilis in early drug screening studies. However, during the course of our drug discovery efforts, the identification of a microbial choline TMA lyase was reported as a unique glycyl radical enzyme complex composed of a catalytic polypeptide, CutC, and an associated activating protein, CutD, encoded by adjacent genes within a gene cluster (Craciun and Balskus, 2012Craciun S. Balskus E.P. Microbial conversion of choline to trimethylamine requires a glycyl radical enzyme.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 21307-21312Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). After this report, we subsequently cloned and expressed the cutC/D genes from P. mirabilis and confirmed that the expressed cutC/D gene complex serves as a microbial choline TMA lyase enzyme source (Figure S1A). For example, intact E. coli Top10 cells in culture lack choline TMA lyase activity, but following transformation with both P. mirabilis cutC/D genes, they acquire the capacity to enzymatically cleave choline to produce TMA. To further confirm that microbial TMA lyase enzyme activity monitored with this system required the presence of both CutC and CutD, we examined multiple additional controls, including the demonstration of the lack of choline TMA lyase activity following transformation with only cutC or cutD individually or following transformation with cutD but in combination with point mutants of cutC previously reported (Craciun and Balskus, 2012Craciun S. Balskus E.P. Microbial conversion of choline to trimethylamine requires a glycyl radical enzyme.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 21307-21312Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) to lack TMA lyase activity (cutC C781A or G1117A of P. mirabilis were made, which correspond to mutation of the conserved thiyl and glycyl-radical active-site residues C489 and G821 in D. alaskensis) (Figure S1A). We surveyed multiple different natural and synthetic structural analogs of choline for their effects on the two microbial choline TMA-lyase activity systems (microbial TMA production using P. mirabilis lysate or recombinant choline TMA lyase activity using cutC/D from P. mirabilis transformed into E. coli) and noted three distinct patterns. Similar results were observed with both systems, with data shown in Figure 1A being from cutC/D-transformed E. coli cell lysates and illustrative data from P. mirabilis lysates shown in Figure S1B. The majority of choline analogs showed no effect on TMA lyase activity, which was monitored by quantifying the impact of the analogs on d9-TMA formation from a fixed amount of [d9-N,N,N-trimethyl]choline (d9-choline) substrate. One notable example in this category is betaine (Figure 1A; Figure S1B), a choline oxidation metabolite and food component that, we recently showed, can serve as a substrate for gut-microbe-dependent TMA and TMAO generation in vivo, albeit at a rate approximately 100-fold less than that observed with a comparable amount of ingested choline (Wang et al., 2014bWang Z. Tang W.H. Buffa J.A. Fu X. Britt E.B. Koeth R.A. Levison B.S. Fan Y. Wu Y. Hazen S.L. Prognostic value of choline and betaine depends on intestinal microbiota-generated metabolite trimethylamine-N-oxide.Eur. Heart J. 2014; 35: 904-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Two of the choline analogs examined, 3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol (DMB) and 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethanol (TMSi-ETOH), in which the nitrogen in choline is replaced with either a carbon or silicon atom, respectively, showed roughly comparable cutC/D choline TMA lyase inhibitory activity with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) in the ∼10 μM range in the recombinant cutC/D system (Figure 1A). Interestingly, the phosphonium analog of choline (P-choline) showed a unique effect by augmenting cutC/D choline TMA lyase activity (Figure 1A; Figure S1B), suggesting that this choline analog acts as an agonist and may promote more effective interaction between the catalytic (CutC) and activating (CutD) polypeptides. Of the choline TMA lyase activity inhibitors identified, we suspected that DMB, given its structure, might be relatively non-toxic, and possibly even found as a natural product in existing foods or alcoholic beverages. Indeed, screening of multiple fermented liquids, oils, and distilled products confirmed that it is present in some alcoholic beverages and oils to varying levels (e.g., DMB was detected in some balsamic vinegars, in red wines, and in some cold-pressed extra virgin olive oils and grapeseed oils; highest levels observed were 25 mM; data not shown). Therefore, we elected to take DMB forward as a potential tool drug with which to test the hypothesis that inhibiting microbial production of TMA might serve as a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of atherosclerosis. In further in vitro studies, DMB was shown to block TMA production from live microbes, inhibiting the rate of intact P. mirabilis conversion of d9-choline into d9-TMA (Figure 1B). Moreover, parallel studies showed no effect of DMB on choline uptake by the live microbes, indicating that DMB does not block choline uptake into the cells (Figure 1C). Interestingly, while DMB inhibited the choline TMA lyase activity of E. coli transformed with cutC/D from P. mirabilis (Figure 1D), the sensitivity of CutC/D from different microbial species to DMB inhibition varied. For example, transforming E. coli with cutC/D from D. alaskenesis—whose homologous CutC and CutD amino acid sequences show 63% and 47% identity to CutC/D from P. mirabilis, respectively—showed decreased extent of inhibition with DMB (Figure 1E; Figure S1C). An obligatory role of CutC in the enzymatic cleavage of choline to produce TMA (and DMB inhibition) in E. coli transformed with the cutC/D gene complex from either P. mirabilis or D. alaskensis was supported in both cases by control studies in which the respective cutC gene was mutated to replace previously reported (Craciun and Balskus, 2012Craciun S. Balskus E.P. Microbial conversion of choline to trimethylamine requires a glycyl radical enzyme.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 21307-21312Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) critical active-site residues involved in catalysis (either C781A or G1117A for CutC from P. mirabilis (Figure 1D) or G489A for CutC from D. alaskensis) (Figure S1C). Examination of alternative TMA substrates with the recombinant cutC/D system (E. coli transformed with P. mirabilis cutC/D) revealed DMB inhibited conversion of both d9-choline and [d9-N,N,N-trimethyl]glycerophosphocholine (d9-GPC) substrates into d9-TMA (Figures S2A–S2E). Moreover, when affinity epitope-tagged CutC and CutD (from E. coli Stellar cells transformed with P. mirabilis cutC/D) were individually isolated to homogeneity, addition of DMB to anaerobic reaction mixtures containing both purified polypeptides showed dose-dependent inhibition in TMA production from either choline or GPC substrates (Figures S2F–S2H). Further studies showed choline and GPC also serve as preferred substrates over [d9-N,N,N-trimethyl]phosphatidylcholine (d9-PC) and [d9-N,N,N-trimethyl]carnitine (d9-carnitine) for TMA production from P. mirabilis lysates, and in both instances, addition of DMB inhibited TMA formation (Figure 1F). Since the CutC/D microbial TMA lyase complex does not effectively use either d9-carnitine or d9-PC as substrates (Figures S2C and S2E), yet both TMA-containing nutrients can be converted into TMA by microbes, we sought to explore whether DMB might serve as an inhibitor to alternative microbial TMA lyase activities. Toward this end, we first cloned the cntA (oxygenase) and cntB (reductase) genes from Acinetobacter baumannii, a recently reported microbial (carnitine-specific) TMA lyase enzyme complex that belongs to the Rieske-type iron-sulfur protein family (Zhu et al., 2014Zhu Y. Jameson E. Crosatti M. Schäfer H. Rajakumar K. Bugg T.D. Chen Y. Carnitine metabolism to trimethylamine by an unusual Rieske-type oxygenase from human microbiota.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 4268-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Examination of the wild-type E. coli BL21 strain showed no carnitine TMA lyase activity, so we transformed these cells with either cntA or cntB (from A. baumannii). While neither transformed E. coli possessed carnitine TMA lyase activity individually, combining the lysates from both cntA- and cntB-transformed E. coli showed the expected acquired enzymatic activity of cleaving d9-carnitine to form d9-TMA (Figure 2A; Figure S3A). Further confirmation that carnitine TMA lyase activity required the CntA polypeptide was achieved by showing that the lysate from E. coli transformed with a cntA point mutant that was previously shown to lack carnitine TMA lyase activity—E205D (Zhu et al., 2014Zhu Y. Jameson E. Crosatti M. Schäfer H. Rajakumar K. Bugg T.D. Chen Y. Carnitine metabolism to trimethylamine by an unusual Rieske-type oxygenase from human microbiota.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 4268-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar)—failed to show activity when combined with cntB-transformed E. coli lysates and incubated with d9-carnitine (Figure S3A). DMB showed no inhibitory effect on CntA/B-catalyzed cleavage of d9-carnitine, and examination of the substrate preference of CntA/B revealed no evidence of TMA production in the presence of alternative potential precursor substrates such as choline, PC, or GPC (Figure 2A).Figure S3Characterization of the Effect of DMB on TMA Lyase Activity of the Reiske-type Proteins CntA/B from A. baumannii and YeaW/X from E. coli, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with pET plasmid harboring constructs with A. baumannii (ATCC 19606) synthesized genes (GenScript) for cntA alone, cntB alone, or the catalytically inactive E205D cntA point mutant, as described under Experimental Procedures.

We recently reported the cloning and characterization of an alternative TMA lyase enzyme complex from E. coli DH10B strain, YeaW/X, which also appears to be a two-component Rieske-type oxygenase/reductase that, at the amino acid level, shows 71% and 50% sequence identity to CntA and CntB, respectively (Koeth et al., 2014Koeth R.A.

To examine the impact of DMB on YeaW/X TMA lyase activity, we first transformed E. coli BL21 cells, which show no detectable TMA lyase activity, with either or both of the yeaW/X genes. We observed that DMB inhibits choline TMA lyase enzyme activity in the presence of both YeaW and YeaX (Figure 2B; Figure S3B). Purified YeaW/X showed enzymatic cleavage of d9-carnitine, [d9-N,N,N-trimethyl]γ-butyrobetaine (d9-γ-butyrobetaine) and [d9-N,N,N-trimethyl]crotonobetaine (d9-crotonobetaine), producing d9-TMA.

We applied an advanced chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) strategy to comprehensively map higher-order chromosome folding and specific chromatin interactions mediated by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) with haplotype specificity and nucleotide resolution in different human cell lineages. We find that CTCF/cohesin-mediated interaction anchors serve as structural foci for spatial organization of constitutive genes concordant with CTCF-motif orientation, whereas RNAPII interacts within these structures by selectively drawing cell-type-specific genes toward CTCF foci for coordinated transcription. Furthermore, we show that haplotype variants and allelic interactions have differential effects on chromosome configuration, influencing gene expression, and may provide mechanistic insights into functions associated with disease susceptibility. 3D genome simulation suggests a model of chromatin folding around chromosomal axes, where CTCF is involved in defining the interface between condensed and open compartments for structural regulation. Our 3D genome strategy thus provides unique insights in the topological mechanism of human variations and diseases."

This work reveals that mouse body language is built from identifiable components and is organized in a predictable fashion; deciphering this language establishes an objective framework for characterizing the influence of environmental cues, genes and neural activity on behavior. Innate behaviors are sculpted by evolution into stereotyped forms that enable animals to accomplish particular goals (such as exploring or avoiding a predator). Ultimately understanding how neural circuits create these patterned behaviors requires a clear framework for characterizing how behavior is organized and evolves over time. One conceptual approach to addressing this challenge arises from ethology, which proposes that the brain builds coherent behaviors by expressing stereotyped modules of simpler action in specific sequences (Tinbergen, 1951Tinbergen N. The study of instinct. Clarendon Press, 1951Google Scholar). Although behavioral modules have traditionally been identified, one at a time, through careful human observation, recent technical advances have enabled more comprehensive characterization of the components of behavior. For example, in invertebrates, behavioral modules and their associated transition probabilities can now be discovered systematically through automated machine vision, clustering, and classification algorithms (Berman et al., 2014Berman G.J.

Furthermore, identifying behavioral modules and transition probabilities has uncovered context-specific strategies used by invertebrate brains to adapt behavior to changes in the environment, which include both the emission of new behavioral modules (such as when the animal switches from “exploring” to “mating”) and the generation of new behaviors through re-sequencing existing modules. In C. elegans, for example, neural circuits that respond to appetitive cues alter transition probabilities between a core set of locomotor-related behavioral modules, thereby creating new behavioral sequences that enable taxis toward attractive odorants (Gray et al., 2005Gray J.M.

Comparable systematic approaches to discovering behavioral modules have not yet been implemented in mice. Instead, traditional behavioral classification approaches have been instantiated in silico, enabling machine vision algorithms to replace tedious and unreliable human scoring of videotaped behavior (de Chaumont et al., 2012de Chaumont F. Coura R.D.-S. Serreau P. Cressant A. Chabout J. Granon S. Olivo-Marin J.-C. Computerized video analysis of social interactions in mice.Nat.

Commun. 2013; 4: 2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These approaches are powerful and have been successfully used to quantify components of innate exploratory, grooming, approach, aggressive, and reproductive behaviors. However, because they depend upon the prior specification, by human observers, of what constitutes a meaningful behavioral module, the insight from these methods is bounded by human perception and intuition. Currently available approaches therefore focus on identifying a small number of pre-specified modules within a given experiment, rather than on discovering new behavioral modules (which potentially encapsulate novel patterns of action), describing the global structure of behavior, or predicting future actions based upon those in the past. Systematically describing the structure of behavior in mice—and understanding how the brain alters that structure to enable adaptation—requires overcoming three challenges. First, it is not clear which features are important to measure when identifying candidate behavioral modules. Mice interact with the world by expressing complex 3D pose dynamics, but because these are difficult to capture, most current methods track 2D parameters such as the position, velocity, or 2D contour of the mouse (de Chaumont et al., 2012de Chaumont F. Coura R.D.-S. Serreau P. Cressant A. Chabout J. Granon S. Olivo-Marin J.-C. Computerized video analysis of social interactions in mice.Nat.

Methods. 2011; 201: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Second, given that behavior evolves on many timescales in parallel, it is not clear how to objectively identify the relevant spatiotemporal scales at which to modularize behavior. Finally, even stereotyped modules of behavior exhibit moment-to-moment and animal-to-animal variability (Colgan, 1978Colgan P.W. Quantitative ethology. John Wiley & Sons, 1978Google Scholar). This variability raises significant challenges for identifying the number and content of behavioral modules, and with associating observed actions with specific behavioral modules. Here we describe a novel method, based upon recent advances in machine vision and learning, that identifies behavioral modules and their associated transition probabilities without human supervision. This approach uses 3D imaging to capture the pose dynamics of mice as they freely behave in a variety of experimental contexts; these data reveal a surprising regularity that appears to divide mouse behavior into recognizable behavioral motifs that are organized at the sub-second timescale. A computational model then takes advantage of the observed fast temporal structure to describe mouse behavior as a series of reused modules, each a brief and stereotyped 3D trajectory through pose space that is connected in time to other modules through predictable transitions. We use this combined 3D imaging/modeling approach to explore how the underlying structure of behavior is altered after distinct environmental, genetic, or neural manipulations and show that this method can detect both predicted changes in action and new features of behavior that had not been previously described. This work reveals that defining behavioral modules based upon structure in the 3D behavioral data itself—rather than using a priori definitions for what should constitute a measurable unit of action—can yield key information about the elements of behavior, offer insight into adaptive behavioral strategies used by mice, and enable discovery of subtle alterations in patterned action. We wished to develop a method that would allow unsupervised phenotyping of mice based upon patterns of 3D movement. However, it is not clear whether spontaneous behaviors exhibited by mice have a definable underlying structure that can be used to characterize action as it evolves over time. To ask whether such a structure might exist, we measured how the shape of a mouse’s body changes as it freely explores a circular open field (Experimental Procedures). We used a single depth camera placed above the arena to capture these 3D pose dynamics and then extracted the image of the mouse from the arena; corrected imaging artifacts due to parallax effects; centered, and aligned the mouse along the inferred axis of its spine; and then quantified how the mouse’s pose changed over time (Figures 1A and S1; Movie S1). Plotting these 3D data over time revealed that mouse behavior is characterized by periods during which pose dynamics evolve slowly, punctuated by fast transitions that separate these periods; this pattern appears to divide the behavioral imaging data into blocks typically lasting 200–900 ms (Figures 1B and S2A). This temporal structure is apparent in the raw imaging pixels (Figure 1B, top), in the inferred shape of the mouse’s spine (Figure 1B, middle), and in dimensionally reduced data that randomly samples from the depth images on the sensor (Figure 1B, bottom; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). This structure is absent in data acquired from anesthetized or dead mice but is present for the entire duration of each experiment in the pose dynamics data of mice exploring behavioral arenas of different shapes and after exposure to a wide variety of sensory cues, suggesting that it is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of mouse behavior (data not shown; Figure S2). To characterize this fast temporal structure, we performed three separate quantitative analyses. First, approximate boundaries between blocks in the behavioral imaging data were identified by a changepoints algorithm, which revealed that the mean block duration was about 350 ms, roughly matching the timescale of the blocks apparent upon visual inspection (Figures 1B and 1C; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Second, we performed temporal autocorrelation analysis on the pose dynamics data, which demonstrated that autocorrelation in the mouse’s pose largely dissipated after 400 ms (tau = 340 ± 58 ms, Figures 1C and S2B). This pattern of autocorrelation reflects specific behavioral dynamics organized at sub-second timescales, as it was destroyed by shuffling the behavioral data at timescales of 500 ms or less, and was not observed in synthetic mouse behavioral data designed to evolve with either random walk or Levy flight characteristics (Figures 1C and S2C). Third, we used a Wiener filter analysis to compare power spectral densities taken from live and dead mice; this approach identifies frequencies that must be changed in imaging data taken from a dead mouse to match the power spectrum of a live mouse. Nearly all of the frequency content differentiating behaving from dead mice was concentrated between 1 and 6 Hz (measured by spectrum ratio, mean 3.75 ± 0.56 Hz, Figures 1C and S2B). Taken together, the qualitative appearance of block structure in the pose dynamics data, along with the convergent results obtained with these three quantitative analyses, demonstrate that mouse pose dynamics exhibit structure at the sub-second timescale. The observed temporal structure within the pose dynamics data suggests a timescale at which continuous behavior may be naturally segmented into meaningful components, as visual inspection of 3D movies revealed that each of the sub-second blocks of behavior appears to encode a recognizable action (e.g., a dart, a pause, the first half of a rear; see Movie S2). To explore the possibility that these sub-second actions are stereotyped (and therefore reproducibly performed at different times during an experiment), the 3D mouse imaging data was subjected to wavelet decomposition followed by principal-component analysis (PCA), which transformed each block in the pose dynamics data into a continuous trajectory through principal component (PC) space (Figures 1D). By scanning the behavioral data using a template matching method (using Euclidean distance among the first 10 PCs, which explain 88% of the data variance) (Figure S2D), additional instances were identified in which each template action was reused (Figure 1D; Supplemental Experimental Procedures; see Figure S3 for additional examples). These anecdotal observations suggest that mice create complex behaviors through the serial expression of stereotyped and reused behavioral modules (Tinbergen, 1951Tinbergen N. The study of instinct. Clarendon Press, 1951Google Scholar). Although our analysis suggests a timescale at which behavioral modules might exist, and qualitative inspection of 3D video and PCA trajectories is consistent with the possibility that sub-second blocks of behavior correspond to reused modules, current methods do not allow for the systematic identification of candidate behavioral modules in mice. Indeed, available approaches neither reveal whether dividing behavior into modules actually helps to explain the overall structure of behavior nor identify the most likely number of modules expressed within any given dataset, or the content and durations of those modules. To address these issues, we built a family of computational models, each of which proposes a unique underlying structure for behavior, and asked which of these models best predicts the pose dynamics of freely behaving mice (Figures 2A and S4); we reasoned that the model that most closely fit behavioral data (to which the model had not been exposed) would reveal key features of the underlying organization of behavior and could be used to characterize its components. After pre-processing the imaging data, the top ten PCs of the data (Figure S4E) were used to fit each model; this use of PCs (which directly reflect the pixel data) as a basis for modeling minimized potential biases from feature engineering. Models were fit using Bayesian nonparametric and Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques that can automatically identify structure within large datasets, including the optimal state number for a given dataset and model (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures; Figure S4). Each model was trained on one set of pose dynamics data and then tested for its ability to explain a separate set of held-out data, a metric canonically used to compare unsupervised learning models (Hastie et al., 2009Hastie T. Tibshirani R. Friedman J. The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction.Second Edition. Springer, 2009Crossref Google Scholar). Our simplest model proposed that each behavioral module is a single fixed pose with no defined transition probabilities between the modules. We iteratively added structure to build increasingly complex models, which incorporated modules with more elaborate internal structures (ranging from mixtures of poses to smooth pose trajectories), allowed predictable transitions between specific modules (by embedding the modules within a Markov model), or both (Figure S4). Where relevant, the fitting procedures were explicitly focused to search for behavioral modules at the sub-second timescale matching the temporal structure identified using our model-free methods; this approach provided an important—and previously unavailable—constraint, given the multiple possible timescales upon which behavior evolves simultaneously. The model that best fit previously unseen behavioral data describes mouse behavior as a sequence of modules (each capturing a brief motif of 3D body motion) that switch from one to another at the sub-second timescale identified by our model-free analysis of pose dynamics (Figures 2A and S4D; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We refer to this model as an AR-HMM, as each behavioral module was modeled as a vector autoregressive (AR) process capturing a stereotyped trajectory through pose space, and the switching dynamics between different modules were modeled using a hidden Markov model (HMM). In other words, the model is a hierarchical description of behavior, with the “internals” of each module reflecting the mouse’s pose dynamics over short timescales, and the longer-timescale relationships between behavioral modules (i.e., the possible module sequences) governed by the transition probabilities specified by an HMM (Figures S4B and S4C). The observation that the AR-HMM outperforms alternative models (Figure 2A) demonstrates that modularity and transition structure at fast timescales are critical for describing mouse behavior, a key prediction from ethology. The AR-HMM systematically identifies modules and their transition probabilities from behavioral data without human supervision; this suggests that the AR-HMM can be used to identify behavioral modules and their associated transition probabilities—and thereby expose the underlying structure of behavior—in a wide variety of experimental contexts. We therefore performed a series of control analyses to establish whether the AR-HMM can indeed reliably identify behavioral modules encoding repeatedly used and stereotyped motifs of distinguishable behavior that are organized at sub-second timescales. Although the AR-HMM is tuned to identify modules at a particular timescale, it is possible that after training the model could fail to effectively capture temporal structure in behavior. However, the AR-HMM successfully identified modules at the fast behavioral timescale defined by the model-free methods, as the distribution of module durations was similar to the duration distribution for changepoints-identified blocks (Figure S5A). Importantly, the ability of the AR-HMM to identify behavioral modules depended upon the inherent sub-second organization of mouse pose data, as shuffling the behavioral data in small chunks (i.e., <500 ms) substantially degraded model performance, whereas shuffling the data in bigger chunks had little effect (Figure S5B). We then asked whether model-identified modules encode repeatedly used and stereotyped motifs of behavior. The pose trajectories associated with a specific model-identified behavioral module took similar paths through PC space, and visual inspection of the 3D movies associated with multiple instances of this module revealed they all encoded a stereotyped rearing behavior (Figure 2B and 2C; Movie S3). In contrast, data instances drawn from different behavioral modules traced distinct (and stereotyped) paths through PC space (Figure 2B; see Figure S5C for additional examples). Furthermore, visual inspection of the 3D movies assigned to different modules reveals that each encoded a coherent pattern of 3D motion that post hoc can be distinguished and labeled with descriptors (see Movie S4 for “walk,” “pause,” and “low rear” modules depicted in Figure 2C, as well as additional examples). The modules identified by the AR-HMM are distinct from each other, as a cross-likelihood analysis demonstrated that the imaging data associated with a given module are best assigned to that module, and not to any of the other behavioral modules (Figure 2D; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). In contrast, the AR-HMM failed to identify any well-separated modules in a synthetic mouse behavioral dataset that lacks modularity but otherwise matches all multidimensional and intertemporal correlations of the real data, demonstrating that the AR-HMM does not discover modularity where none exists (Figure 2D). Furthermore, rerunning the AR-HMM training process from random starting points generated highly similar behavioral modules (R2 = 0.94 ± 0.03, n = 15 restarts, Supplemental Experimental Procedures); in comparison, models with lower held-out likelihood scores had lower consistency (R2 < 0.4), suggesting that these alternatives fail to reliably identify underlying structure in behavior. The AR-HMM output was also robust to the specific training data used, as models created from subsets of a larger dataset representing a single experiment were highly similar to each other (R2 > 0.9). These findings demonstrate that the AR-HMM converges on a consistent set of behavioral modules regardless of the specific training data (within a given experiment) or how the model is initialized. Finally, the modules of behavior and the associated transition probabilities identified by the AR-HMM appear to fully capture the richness of mouse behavior, as a 3D movie of a behaving mouse generated by a trained AR-HMM was qualitatively difficult to distinguish from a 3D movie of behavior exhibited by a real animal (Movie S5; Figure S4E); in contrast, movies generated by more poorly performing models appeared discontinuous and were easily distinguished from actual mice (data not shown). Taken together with our model-free and model-based analyses and controls, the observation that after training our model can synthesize a convincing replica of 3D mouse behavior from learned modules and transition probabilities is consistent with the hypothesis that mouse behavior is organized into distinct sub-second modules that are combined to create coherent patterns of action. The AR-HMM identifies two key features of mouse behavior (from the perspective of 3D pose dynamics): which behavioral modules are expressed during behavior and how those modules transition into each other over time to create action. The AR-HMM identified ∼60 reliably used behavioral modules from a circular open field dataset, which is representative of normal mouse exploratory behavior in the laboratory (51 modules explained 95 percent of imaging frames, and 65 modules explained 99 percent of imaging frames) (Figures 3A, S5D, and S5E; subjective categorization of the 51 most-used modules is shown in Figure S6A). These modules were connected to each other over time in a highly non-uniform manner, with each module preferentially linked to some modules and not others (Figures 3B and S5F; average node degree after thresholding transitions that occur with <5% probability, 4.08 ± 0.10). This specific transition pattern among modules constrained the module sequences observed in the dataset (∼17,000/∼75,000 possible sequences of three modules [“trigrams”] given the total data size), demonstrating that certain module sequences were favored over others and that mouse behavior is therefore predictable (per frame entropy rate without self-transitions 3.78 ± 0.03 bits, with self-transitions 0.72 ± 0.01 bits, entropy rate in a uniform matrix 6.02 bits; average mutual information without self-transitions 1.92 ± 0.02 bits, with self-transitions 4.84 bits ± 0.03 bits; see Movie S6 for multiple examples of the sequence of three modules depicted in Figure 2B). Note that while estimating coarse changes in specific trigram frequencies is possible, accurately estimating higher-order k-gram transition statistics is difficult, as the amount of data required grows exponentially with k. We therefore focus our analysis on lower-order statistics such as module usage frequencies and temporal interactions between pairs of modules. We tested whether the AR-HMM could effectively capture changes in behavior (both predicted and unpredicted) elicited by a range of simple experimental interventions designed to probe the influence of the environment, genes, or neural circuit activity on behavior. We first asked how mice behavior adapts to changes in apparatus shape. We imaged mice within a small square box and then co-trained our model with both the circular open field and square box data, thereby enabling direct comparisons of modules and transitions under both conditions; the modules identified by this co-training procedure did not erroneously lump together data that would otherwise be distinguishable, as each behavioral module’s mean pose trajectory was stereotyped across the different experimental arenas (data not shown). Although mice tended to explore the corners of the square box and the walls of the circular open field, the overall usage of most modules was similar between these apparatuses, consistent with exploratory behavior sharing many common features across arenas (Figure 3C). However, the AR-HMM also identified a small number of behavioral modules that were deployed selectively in just one context, suggesting that different physical environments drive expression of new behavioral modules (Figure 3C). For example, one circular arena-specific module encoded a behavior in which mice walk near the arena wall with a body posture that matches the curvature of the wall, while within the square box mice expressed a context-specific module that encodes a dart out of the center of the square (Figures 3D and 3E). Several behavioral modules were also differentially enriched (but not exclusively expressed) in one context or the other. In the circular arena, for ex"

Before their resolution at 3–20 hr after anaphase, the chromatin bridges induced nuclear envelope rupture in interphase, accumulated the cytoplasmic 3′ nuclease TREX1, and developed RPA-coated single stranded (ss) DNA. CRISPR knockouts showed that TREX1 contributed to the generation of the ssDNA and the resolution of the chromatin bridges. Post-crisis clones showed chromothripsis and kataegis, presumably resulting from DNA repair and APOBEC editing of the fragmented chromatin bridge DNA. We propose that chromothripsis in human cancer may arise through TREX1-mediated fragmentation of dicentric chromosomes formed in telomere crisis."
https://openalex.org/W2192926654,"In this study, we describe the 3D chromosome regulatory landscape of human naive and primed embryonic stem cells. To devise this map, we identified transcriptional enhancers and insulators in these cells and placed them within the context of cohesin-associated CTCF-CTCF loops using cohesin ChIA-PET data. The CTCF-CTCF loops we identified form a chromosomal framework of insulated neighborhoods, which in turn form topologically associating domains (TADs) that are largely preserved during the transition between the naive and primed states. Regulatory changes in enhancer-promoter interactions occur within insulated neighborhoods during cell state transition. The CTCF anchor regions we identified are conserved across species, influence gene expression, and are a frequent site of mutations in cancer cells, underscoring their functional importance in cellular regulation. These 3D regulatory maps of human pluripotent cells therefore provide a foundation for future interrogation of the relationships between chromosome structure and gene control in development and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2219709225,"Learned and adaptive behaviors rely on neural circuits that flexibly couple the same sensory input to alternative output pathways. Here, we show that the Drosophila mushroom body functions like a switchboard in which neuromodulation reroutes the same odor signal to different behavioral circuits, depending on the state and experience of the fly. Using functional synaptic imaging and electrophysiology, we reveal that dopaminergic inputs to the mushroom body modulate synaptic transmission with exquisite spatial specificity, allowing individual neurons to differentially convey olfactory signals to each of their postsynaptic targets. Moreover, we show that the dopaminergic neurons function as an interconnected network, encoding information about both an animal's external context and internal state to coordinate synaptic plasticity throughout the mushroom body. Our data suggest a general circuit mechanism for behavioral flexibility in which neuromodulatory networks act with synaptic precision to transform a single sensory input into different patterns of output activity.

https://openalex.org/W2210879955,"The envelope glycoprotein trimer mediates HIV-1 entry into cells. The trimer is flexible, fluctuating between closed and more open conformations and sometimes sampling the fully open, CD4-bound form. We hypothesized that conformational flexibility and transient exposure of non-neutralizing, immunodominant epitopes could hinder the induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). We therefore modified soluble Env trimers to stabilize their closed, ground states. The trimer variants were indeed stabilized in the closed conformation, with a reduced ability to undergo receptor-induced conformational changes and a decreased exposure of non-neutralizing V3-directed antibody epitopes. In rabbits, the stabilized trimers induced similar autologous Tier-1B or Tier-2 NAb titers to those elicited by the corresponding wild-type trimers but lower levels of V3-directed Tier-1A NAbs. Stabilized, closed trimers might therefore be useful components of vaccines aimed at inducing bNAbs."
https://openalex.org/W2211016425,"A central question in biology is whether variability between genetically identical cells exposed to the same culture conditions is largely stochastic or deterministic. Using image-based transcriptomics in millions of single human cells, we find that while variability of cytoplasmic transcript abundance is large, it is for most genes minimally stochastic and can be predicted with multivariate models of the phenotypic state and population context of single cells. Computational multiplexing of these predictive signatures across hundreds of genes revealed a complex regulatory system that controls the observed variability of transcript abundance between individual cells. Mathematical modeling and experimental validation show that nuclear retention and transport of transcripts between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is central to buffering stochastic transcriptional fluctuations in mammalian gene expression. Our work indicates that cellular compartmentalization confines transcriptional noise to the nucleus, thereby preventing it from interfering with the control of single-cell transcript abundance in the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2210407171,"The organization of human auditory cortex remains unresolved, due in part to the small stimulus sets common to fMRI studies and the overlap of neural populations within voxels. To address these challenges, we measured fMRI responses to 165 natural sounds and inferred canonical response profiles (""components"") whose weighted combinations explained voxel responses throughout auditory cortex. This analysis revealed six components, each with interpretable response characteristics despite being unconstrained by prior functional hypotheses. Four components embodied selectivity for particular acoustic features (frequency, spectrotemporal modulation, pitch). Two others exhibited pronounced selectivity for music and speech, respectively, and were not explainable by standard acoustic features. Anatomically, music and speech selectivity concentrated in distinct regions of non-primary auditory cortex. However, music selectivity was weak in raw voxel responses, and its detection required a decomposition method. Voxel decomposition identifies primary dimensions of response variation across natural sounds, revealing distinct cortical pathways for music and speech."

Cumulatively, these studies suggest that co-opting host lipid metabolism facilitates microbial or viral pathogenesis, and leads to the hypothesis that host defense pathways should attempt to overwrite the metabolic changes induced by invading pathogens. In support of this concept, recent studies have demonstrated that components of host responses to pathogens (e.g., Toll-like receptor [TLR] 3/4 and type I interferon [IFN] signaling) specifically rewire the lipid metabolic program by downregulating de novo cholesterol biosynthesis at the genetic level (Blanc et al., 2011Blanc M.

Thus, it has been suggested that the influence of type I IFN signaling on cholesterol homeostasis would serve to limit the availability of lipid metabolites for intracellular organisms. In contrast, other studies have shown that these same inflammatory signals (e.g., TLR3/4 and type I IFNs) increase lipid uptake from environmental sources, resulting in the accumulation of neutral lipids and ultimately facilitating foam cell formation (Dushkin and Kovshik, 2013Dushkin M.I.

Thus, it remains unclear if the purpose of type I IFN-mediated metabolic reprogramming is to specifically limit the availability of lipid metabolites (e.g., cholesterol) for pathogens as has been proposed, or if there are alternative reasons for the selective reprogramming of flux through the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Herein, we examine this question and delineate a lipid metabolic-inflammatory circuit that links the induction of type I IFN-mediated inflammation with perturbations in the pool size of synthesized cholesterol. Using stable isotope enrichment analysis, we demonstrate that type I IFN signaling shifts the balance of lipid metabolism away from de novo synthesis to favor lipid import without limiting total long-chain fatty acid and cholesterol content in macrophages. Strikingly, we find that genetically enforcing this shift in lipid homeostasis in macrophages alone is sufficient to protect mice from viral challenge, demonstrating the importance of reprogramming the “set point” between synthesis and import in host defense. Unexpectedly, we find that limiting flux through the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway spontaneously induces a type I IFN response that primes cells for heightened anti-viral immunity in both an autocrine and paracrine manner. Mechanistic studies indicate that the STING (TMEM173) signaling axis is required to link the induction of a type I IFN response with alterations in flux through the mevalonate pathway. Replenishing free cholesterol was able to normalize type I IFN levels by limiting STING signaling in cells lacking enzymes of the mevalonate pathway, establishing the importance of cholesterol homeostasis in type-I-mediated inflammation. To better understand how type I IFN signaling modulates the balance of lipid synthesis and import, we employed gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) paired with 13C-stable isotope enrichment studies to measure total and synthesized cholesterol and long-chain fatty acid levels in mouse bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) stimulated with IFNβ, Poly:IC (TLR3 agonist) or infected with murine gammaherpesvirus-68 (MHV-68). Isotopic spectral analysis (ISA) (Williams et al., 2013Williams K.J. Argus J.P. Zhu Y. Wilks M.Q. Marbois B.N. York A.G. Kidani Y. Pourzia A.L. Akhavan D. Lisiero D.N. et al.An essential requirement for the SCAP/SREBP signaling axis to protect cancer cells from lipotoxicity.Cancer Res. 2013; 73: 2850-2862Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) was applied to the mass isotopomer distributions to derive the contribution of de novo synthesis to the total cholesterol and long-chain fatty acid pools over the labeling period. Treatment of BMDMs with either IFNβ or Poly:IC significantly decreased the synthesis of saturated long-chain fatty acids (16:0, 18:0), unsaturated long-chain fatty acids (18:1), and cholesterol (Figures 1A and S1A). However, total fatty acid (16:0, 18:0, 18:1, and 18:2) and cholesterol content increased on a per cell basis (Figures 1B and S1B), suggesting that these cells increase lipid import. Consistent with our MS studies, we observed a significant increase in the uptake of dil-acetylated LDL in response to Poly:IC or IFNβ stimulation in BMDMs (Figure S1C). Importantly, infection of BMDMs with MHV-68 drove a similar shift in the balance of lipid synthesis and import in an interferon α/β receptor (IFNAR)-dependent manner, indicating that type I IFNs mediate lipid metabolic reprogramming (Figures 1A, 1B, S1A, and S1B). We also considered the possibility that the availability of environmental lipids would influence IFN-mediated reprogramming. To address this, we cultured BMDMs with increasing percentages of serum (5%, 10%, and 20%) before stimulation with IFNβ. ISA modeling indicated that type I IFN treatment consistently decreased de novo synthesis of cholesterol and increased import to nearly the same extent in all serum conditions (Figure S1D).Figure S1Repression of Lipid Synthesis Program by Type I IFN, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Net synthesis (in nmol/1e6 cells) of palmitic acid (16:0), stearic acid (18:0), oleic acid (18:1) and cholesterol as measured by Isotopic Spectral Analysis (ISA) in C57BL/6 BMDMs with or without interferonβ (1000U/ml IFNβ), Poly:IC (2ug/ml) or MHV-68 (MOI = 0.5) +/− 10ug/ml IFNAR neutralizing antibody for 48h.(B) Total cellular linoleic acid (18:2) in C57BL/6 BMDMs as stimulated in (A).(C) Uptake of DiI-acLDL in BMDMs treated with IFNβ or Poly:IC as above.(D) Net Synthesis of cholesterol as measured by ISA (left) and total cholesterol (right) from BMDMs ± 1000U/ml IFNβ for 24h.

Next, we examined the expression pattern of genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis and import in MHV-infected BMDMs. We observed that infection decreased expression of genes encoding enzymes of the de novo cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthetic pathways (Figure 1C), similar to previous studies on cholesterol synthesis using cytomegalovirus (Blanc et al., 2013Blanc M. Hsieh W.Y. Robertson K.A. Kropp K.A. Forster T. Shui G. Lacaze P. Watterson S. Griffiths S.J. Spann N.J. et al.The transcription factor STAT-1 couples macrophage synthesis of 25-hydroxycholesterol to the interferon antiviral response.Immunity. 2013; 38: 106-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). MHV infection also significantly increased expression of genes involved in lipid import, including Macrophage Scavenger Receptor (Msr1) and the fatty acid translocase Cd36 (Figures 1C and S1E). Stimulation of BMDMs with IFNβ or Poly:IC for 24 hr revealed a similar reprogramming at the gene and protein expression level (Figures S1F and S1G). Importantly, blocking IFNAR signaling abrogated reprogramming of lipid metabolism driven by either MHV-68 infection or type I IFN stimulation (Figures 1C and S1G). Thus, we conclude that type I IFN signals reprogram the balance of lipid synthesis and import within a macrophage but do not appear to specifically limit cholesterol and long-chain fatty acid availability. The results of our isotope labeling studies led us to ask if this shift in the balance of lipid homeostasis driven by type I IFN is an important component of host defense. To directly address this would require a genetic model where the “set point” controlling the balance of lipid synthesis and scavenging was shifted independent of TLR and IFNAR signaling. To accomplish this, we generated mice with macrophage-specific deletion of SREBP cleavage-activating protein (gene: Scap; protein: SCAP) using the LysM-Cre model. SCAP is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) sterol-sensing protein required to chaperone the sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBP1 and SREBP2) (Horton et al., 2002Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. SREBPs: activators of the complete program of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis in the liver.J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3776) Google Scholar). Upon genetic deletion of Scap, SREBP1 and 2 transcriptional activities are significantly attenuated, resulting in markedly reduced expression of cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis genes (see Figure S2A for schematic) (Kidani et al., 2013Kidani Y. Elsaesser H. Hock M.B. Vergnes L. Williams K.J. Argus J.P. Marbois B.N. Komisopoulou E. Wilson E.B. Osborne T.F. et al.Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins are essential for the metabolic programming of effector T cells and adaptive immunity.Nat. Immunol. 2013; 14: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). As expected, gene expression analysis of BMDMs confirmed that genetic deletion of Scap markedly decreases expression of the genes encoding enzymes of the de novo cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthetic programs (Figure 1D). However, loss-of-Scap does not appear to influence the in vitro differentiation of BMDMs (Figure S2B) nor impact the frequency of macrophages or other immune cell populations in lymph node, spleen, and bone marrow (Figure S2C). Next, we performed 13C-isotope enrichment and ISA to determine if loss-of-Scap altered lipid biosynthetic capacity. We observed that the contribution of synthesis to total lipid pools in Scap−/− BMDMs was decreased compared to controls (Figures 1E and S2D). However, total cholesterol and fatty acid pool sizes were similar between IFNβ-treated control and Scap−/− BMDMs (Figure 1F), demonstrating that loss-of-Scap does not significantly decrease the total amounts of these lipids in BMDMs. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Scap-deficiency phenocopies the shift in lipid homeostasis observed in response to IFNβ stimulation. Next, we sought to determine whether genetically enforcing this metabolic shift in macrophages influenced host defense. To begin investigating this, control and Scap−/− BMDMs were infected with MHV-68. Examination of viral gene expression revealed that Scap−/− BMDMs contained significantly lower viral transcripts (Figure 2A), indicative of lower viral burden. Similarly, stable knockdown of SCAP in human THP1 macrophages rendered cells resistant to HIV-1, decreasing HIV-1 RNA and p24 protein expression by ∼70% (Figure 2B). To determine whether macrophage-specific perturbations in the lipid biosynthetic program could influence viral pathogenesis in vivo, LysM-Cre+/− and LysM-Cre+/−/Scapfl/fl mice were challenged intranasally with MHV-68. Similar to our in vitro results, we found that the loss-of-Scap in macrophages alone was sufficient to reduce viral load in lungs by over 90% (Figure 2C). Taken together, our data indicate that genetic deletion of Scap can be protective in viral infections and support the concept that lipid metabolic reprogramming can be a protective component of host response to viral infections. MHV replicates in a number of cell types, including macrophages and type 1 and type 2 pneumocytes (Hughes et al., 2010Hughes D.J. Kipar A. Sample J.T. Stewart J.P. Pathogenesis of a model gammaherpesvirus in a natural host.J. Virol. 2010; 84: 3949-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), leading us to hypothesize that viral resistance conferred by loss-of-Scap in macrophages may be transferable to neighboring cells. To directly test this, conditioned media (CM) from naive control or Scap−/− macrophages was collected and transferred to wild-type (WT; C57BL/6) BMDM cultures before challenge with MHV-68 (see Figure S3A for schematic). Remarkably, transfer of Scap−/− CM to WT BMDM cultures was able to reduce MHV-68 viral burden by ∼50% (Figure 2D). These results indicate that the viral resistance phenotype observed in Scap-deficient macrophages occurs, at least in part, through the production of secreted factors that then prime cells for anti-viral immunity. Type I IFNs are secreted proteins that are important for anti-viral immunity, leading us to ask if genetic deletion of Scap influenced type I IFN responses. Gene expression studies on unstimulated BMDMs revealed that loss-of-Scap results in the spontaneous induction of a type I IFN-inflammatory response characterized by heightened Ifnb1 and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs, e.g., Mx1, Mx2, Irf7, Ccl2, and Cxcl10) (Figure 2E). Heightened ISG expression was also observed in alveolar macrophages from LysM-Cre+/−/Scapfl/fl mice (Figures 2F and S3B), indicating that loss-of-Scap drives a type I IFN signature in vivo. Addition of IFNAR-blocking antibody to BMDM cultures was able to abrogate ISG expression (Figure 2G), suggesting that Scap−/− macrophage spontaneously produce more type I IFNs. In support of this, transfer of culture supernatants from unstimulated Scap−/− BMDMs to quiescent WT macrophages was able to induce an ISG signature (Figure 2H). We also observed the upregulation of a type I IFN signature in human THP1 macrophages in response to either stable or transient silencing of SCAP (Figures S3C and S3D). Importantly, addition of IFNAR blocking antibody abrogated antiviral capacity of CM from Scap−/− BMDMs (Figure 2I), supporting the concept that the anti-viral effect of Scap deficiency was, in large part, mediated through production of type I IFNs. Next, we assessed the ability of Scap-deficient macrophages to respond to TLR3/4 and IFNAR signaling. We observed that both human and mouse Scap-deficient macrophages have significantly heightened induction of Ifnb1 and ISGs in response to both lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Poly:IC, as well as type I IFN treatment (Figure 2J, left, and Figures S3E–S3G). Interestingly, not all inflammatory responses were upregulated in Scap-deficient macrophages. We found that induction of Il1b, a canonical pro-inflammatory factor downstream of TLR4 activation, was significantly attenuated in response to LPS (Figure 2J, right). IFNAR blockade was able to partially restore upregulation of Il1b expression in TLR4-stimulated Scap-deficient macrophages (Figure S3H), indicating that type IFN signaling contributes, in part, to repression of Il1b in LPS-stimulated cells. Taken together, these data indicate that reprogramming of lipid metabolism can prime macrophages for heightened IFN responses to PAMPs or cytokine signals; however, this type of metabolic reprogramming also entrains specific inflammatory responses at the expense of other inflammatory programs. Scap is required for activation of all isoforms of the SREBP transcription factors. In mammals, there are two SREBP genes that express three SREBP proteins. SREBP1a and SREBP1c are produced via alternative transcriptional start sites on SREBF1, whereas the SREBF2 gene encodes SREBP2 (Horton et al., 2002Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. SREBPs: activators of the complete program of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis in the liver.J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3776) Google Scholar). In general, SREBP1 activates transcription of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis, while SREBP2 is responsible for transcriptionally activating genes required for cholesterol synthesis (schematic Figure S2A). To determine if the ISG signature observed in Scap-deficient macrophages was dependent on loss of the SREBP1 or SREBP2 transcriptional axis, we generated THP1 macrophages stably expressing shRNA targeting either SREBF1 or SREBF2 (designated herein as shSREBP1 or shSREBP2, respectively) and performed RNA-sequencing studies on unstimulated macrophages. As expected, knockdown of SREBP1 attenuated expression of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis, whereas loss of SREBP2 decreased expression of cholesterol biosynthesis genes (Figures S4A and S4B). Bioinformatic analysis of RNA-seq data indicated that heightened expression of ISGs, and enrichment of pathways involved in host defense to viral infection, segregated entirely with the loss of SREBP2 expression (Figures 3A and S4C). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis confirmed that silencing of SREBP2 in primary human PBMC-derived macrophages or THP1 cells resulted in heightened basal expression of IFNB1 and an ISG signature (Figures 3B, S4D, and S4E). In line with this pro-inflammatory phenotype, SREBP2-deficient macrophages were significantly resistant to Influenza A and HIV-1 challenge (Figures 3C and S4F). In contrast, a type I IFN signature was not observed in shSREBP1 macrophages (Figures 3A, 3B, and S4E), indicating that the spontaneous induction of type I interferon-mediated inflammation occurs specifically in response to genetically perturbing the SCAP/SREBP2 pathway.Figure 3Inhibiting the SREBP2 Transcriptional Pathway Engages a Type I IFN Inflammatory ResponseShow full caption(A) RNA-seq data from unstimulated shControl, shSREBP1, and shSREBP2 THP1 cells 72 hr after PMA-differentiation into macrophages.

To date, however, no specific mechanism via which this cytokine could alter cognitive circuits has been demonstrated. Here, we show that local increase of TNFα in the hippocampal dentate gyrus activates astrocyte TNF receptor type 1 (TNFR1), which in turn triggers an astrocyte-neuron signaling cascade that results in persistent functional modification of hippocampal excitatory synapses. Astrocytic TNFR1 signaling is necessary for the hippocampal synaptic alteration and contextual learning-memory impairment observed in experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS).

Synaptic activity is subject to various types of control, including regulatory inputs from surrounding glial cells.

An astrocyte-synapse modulatory pathway was described in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), by which synaptically activated astrocyte G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) stimulate, via glutamate release, NR2B-containing NMDA receptors located in presynaptic excitatory fibers (pre-NMDAR; Jourdain et al., 2007Jourdain P.

Surprisingly, the glial regulatory pathway is itself controlled by the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) (Santello et al., 2011Santello M. Bezzi P. Volterra A. TNFα controls glutamatergic gliotransmission in the hippocampal dentate gyrus.Neuron. 2011; 69: 988-1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Moreover, TNFα exerts additional controls at hippocampal synapses, such as on trafficking of AMPA (Beattie et al., 2002Beattie E.C. Stellwagen D. Morishita W. Bresnahan J.C. Ha B.K. Von Zastrow M. Beattie M.S. Malenka R.C.

TNF-α downregulates inhibitory neurotransmission through protein phosphatase 1-dependent trafficking of GABA(A) receptors.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 15879-15893Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), emerging as a key physiological regulator of hippocampal synaptic function. Therefore, it is important to ask what happens to the hippocampal cognitive circuit when TNFα increases above local homeostatic levels (Santello and Volterra, 2012Santello M. Volterra A. TNFα in synaptic function: switching gears.Trends Neurosci. 2012; 35: 638-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), as occurs in the CNS in a variety of medical conditions linked to inflammation or infection (Clark et al., 2010Clark I.A.

Observations in both humans and animals indicate a link between increased TNFα levels and cognitive alterations (Swardfager and Black, 2013Swardfager W. Black S.E.

Here, starting from the known characteristics of astrocytic modulation of DG synapses (Jourdain et al., 2007Jourdain P. Bergersen L.H. Bhaukaurally K. Bezzi P. Santello M. Domercq M. Matute C.

TNFα controls glutamatergic gliotransmission in the hippocampal dentate gyrus.Neuron. 2011; 69: 988-1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), we asked whether such a condition can affect excitatory transmission at perforant path-granule cell (PP-GC) hippocampal synapses. We find that high (600 pM), but not low (60 pM), TNFα concentrations persistently alter the functional properties of this synaptic circuit, acting via TNF receptor type 1 (TNFR1) and a presynaptic mechanism involving NR2B-containing NMDAR. We also show that the same synaptic alteration, together with impaired contextual memory processing, is present in a murine model of multiple sclerosis (MS), a pathology often presenting with cognitive disturbances (Chiaravalloti and DeLuca, 2008Chiaravalloti N.D. DeLuca J. Cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis.Lancet Neurol. 2008; 7: 1139-1151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar). Finally, taking advantage of a transgenic mouse model, we directly demonstrate that both synaptic and cognitive impairments in the murine MS model depend to a large extent on activation of TNFR1 in astrocytes. To establish whether an increased local level of TNFα affects cognitive circuits, we initially compared the effect produced on excitatory EC-DG synapses by a rapid (10-s) puff of exogenous TNFα, applied at the estimated basal concentration (60 pM; Santello et al., 2011Santello M. Bezzi P. Volterra A. TNFα controls glutamatergic gliotransmission in the hippocampal dentate gyrus.Neuron. 2011; 69: 988-1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) or at a 10-fold higher concentration (600 pM; Figure 1). We used this experimental approach to evaluate the confined effect of the cytokine in the outer/middle molecular layer (OML/MML) of the DG (Figure 1A), and to directly link the observed effect to the used concentration. Application of 60 pM TNFα did not produce any detectable change in basal synaptic activity (mean frequency, amplitude, and kinetics of AMPAR-dependent miniature post-synaptic excitatory currents [mEPSCs]) in dentate GCs within 30 min (Figures 1A–1C and S1). In contrast, application of 600 pM TNFα produced progressive, strong increase in synaptic activity that reached plateau within 10 min and persisted unchanged after 30 min (and, in a few longer experiments, also after 50–60 min; data not shown). This long-lasting effect of the cytokine affected mEPSC frequency selectively, without changing mEPSC amplitude or kinetics (Figures 1A–1C and S1A), suggesting a presynaptic mechanism. When applied via prolonged bath incubation (1–2.5 hr), 600 pM TNFα, however, in addition to mEPSC frequency, also increased mEPSC amplitude, albeit slightly (Figure S1B), suggesting that its action at excitatory synapses is both dose and time dependent. These recordings were performed in young mice (P17–P25), but comparable effects were observed in adult animals (P60–P90; Figure 1D), ruling out that the TNFα effect is a developmental phenomenon. Increased mEPSC frequency in GCs predicts an enhanced EC drive to the DG. To verify this, we recorded EPSCs evoked by lateral PP stimulation (eEPSCs) in individual GCs (Figures 1E and 1F). Brief puffs of 600 pM TNFα, but not 60 pM, induced long-lasting increase in eEPSC amplitude and parallel change in short-term plasticity, denoted by reduced paired-pulse facilitation upon two consecutive stimuli. We conclude that high TNFα persistently enhances glutamate release probability at presynaptic PP terminals, thereby producing aberrant excitability of hippocampal GCs.Figure S1Rapid Application of either 60 or 600 pM Exogenous TNFα Does Not Affect mEPSC Amplitude and Kinetics in a Hippocampal Cognitive Circuit, whereas Prolonged Incubation of 600 pM TNFα Affects Both mEPSC Frequency and Amplitude, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Time-course of mean values of mEPSC amplitude (left), rise time (middle) and decay time (right) in the period going from 5 min before application of TNFα (60 pM: blue; 600 pM: red) up to 30 min after application of the cytokine.

Given that TNFα above 300 pM triggers glutamate release from astrocytes and that astrocytic glutamate transiently strengthens GC synapses via activation of NR2B-containing pre-NMDAR (Bezzi et al., 2001Bezzi P.

TNFα controls glutamatergic gliotransmission in the hippocampal dentate gyrus.Neuron. 2011; 69: 988-1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), we tested whether the long-lasting synaptic effect of elevated TNFα was sensitive to the NR2B antagonist, ifenprodil. Indeed, in the presence of this drug, 600 pM TNFα failed to change mEPSC frequency (Figure 2A). To then check whether TNFα activates NR2B-NMDAR persistently, we applied ifenprodil at the peak of the synaptic effect of the cytokine. The NMDAR antagonist was ineffective at reversing the TNFα increase in mEPSC frequency (Figure 2B). Therefore, the long-lasting synaptic action of TNFα necessitates NR2B-NMDAR activation, but only during its induction. Next, we hypothesized a role for TNFR1, given that specific TNFR1 agonist antibodies mimic the glutamate-releasing action of TNFα in astrocytes (Bezzi et al., 2001Bezzi P. Domercq M. Brambilla L. Galli R. Schols D. De Clercq E. Vescovi A. Bagetta G. Kollias G. Meldolesi J. Volterra A. CXCR4-activated astrocyte glutamate release via TNFalpha: amplification by microglia triggers neurotoxicity.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 702-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). When we applied 600 pM TNFα to hippocampal slices from tnfr1−/− mice (Rothe et al., 1993Rothe J. Lesslauer W. Lötscher H. Lang Y. Koebel P. Köntgen F. Althage A. Zinkernagel R. Steinmetz M. Bluethmann H. Mice lacking the tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 are resistant to TNF-mediated toxicity but highly susceptible to infection by Listeria monocytogenes.Nature. 1993; 364: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar), the cytokine failed to produce any increase in mEPSC frequency (Figure 2C), although basal activity at GC synapses was normal (mEPSC frequency: wild-type: 1.63 ± 0.23 Hz [n = 11]; tnfr1−/−: 1.87 ± 0.28 [n = 4], p = 0.57; amplitude: wild-type: 7.91 ± 0.74 pA; tnfr1−/−: 6.57 ± 0.57, p = 0.32, unpaired t test). Taken together, these data confirm that TNFR1 plays a necessary role in the synaptic effect of TNFα and suggest that, at increased levels, the cytokine stimulates astrocyte signaling via this receptor. To establish that elevated TNFα indeed affects synaptic function via astrocyte signaling, we generated a new double transgenic mouse model, the hGFAPcreT2/tnfr1cneo/cneo mouse. To obtain this model, we crossed mice with TNFR1 conditionally deleted in all cell types (tnfr1cneo/cneo; Victoratos et al., 2006Victoratos P. Lagnel J. Tzima S. Alimzhanov M.B. Rajewsky K.

Scheller A. Braun C. Hirrlinger J. Kirchhoff F.

The efficiency and specificity of astrocytic recombination in the hippocampal DG was determined using hGFAPcreT2/tnfr1cneo/cneo mice expressing the ROSA-EYFP reporter (Srinivas et al., 2001Srinivas S. Watanabe T. Lin C.S. William C.M. Tanabe Y. Jessell T.M. Costantini F. Cre reporter strains produced by targeted insertion of EYFP and ECFP into the ROSA26 locus.BMC Dev. Biol. 2001; 1: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar) (Figure 3B). Young (P22) and adult (P90) mice, studied 13 and 25 days after the first TAM injection, respectively, yielded similar results. In 12 slices from four P90 mice, we counted a total of 1,680 EYFP+ cells, most of which displayed the typical morphology of protoplasmic astrocytes and were distributed patchily, both in the dentate molecular layer (ML) and in the hilus. These cells were also positive for the astrocytic marker glutamine synthetase (GS+/EYFP+ cells) and represented 37% of the total astrocytic population (GS+ cells). About 10% of the EYFP+ cells were confined to the subgranular zone (SGZ), most likely representing stem cells and neuronal precursors. In the OML/MML, where PP-GC synapses lie, 99.3% (714 cells) of the EYFP+ cells were GS+, representing resident astrocytes, while 0.7% (five cells) were NeuN+ or GS−, representing immature GCs sitting in the GC layer and sending growing dendrites to the OML/MML. No reporter expression was detected in mice injected with corn oil (OIL), the TAM vehicle (Figure S2), confirming that cre activity is specifically induced by TAM. The above results were corroborated by genomic PCR analysis of TAM-induced tnfr1 recombination in FACS-sorted populations of NeuN+ cells (no recombination) and NeuN− cells (prominent recombination) obtained from hGFAPcreT2/tnfr1cneo/cneo mouse brains (Figures 3C, S3, and S4). Therefore, hGFAPcreT2/tnfr1cneo/cneo mice are a valid model to investigate the contribution of astrocyte signaling to the actions of TNFα.Figure S2Lack of Reporter Expression in OIL-Treated hGFAPcreT2/tnfr1cneo/cneo Mice, Related to Figure 3Show full captionRepresentative immunolabeling of the hippocampal dentate gyrus of a 90-days old hGFAPcreT2/tnfr1cneo/cneo mouse injected with OIL (z stack, 12 μm; scale bar, 100 μm).

In order to distinguish single cells from cell clusters, singlet gating based on a DAPI-A versus DAPI-W scatter plot was done (Guez-Barber et al., 2012). NeuN+ and NeuN− singlets were then sorted.

(A–C) Flow cytometric analysis was performed on cells enzymatically dissociated from adult mouse brains and fluorescently labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 directed against the neuronal marker NeuN (Alexa Fluor 488-A, see the Experimental Procedures) and with DAPI. The following mouse groups were analyzed: (A) wild-type (n = 12 mice); (B) TAM-treated hGFAPcreT2/tnfr1cneo/cneo (n = 8); (C) tnfr1cneo/cneo (n = 7). For each mouse group, cells were separated in neuronal and non-neuronal populations according to the presence (NeuN+, purple) or absence (NeuN−, orange) of Alexa Fluor 488-A fluorescence. In order to distinguish single cells from cell clusters, singlet gating based on a DAPI-A versus DAPI-W scatter plot was done (Guez-Barber et al., 2012). NeuN+ and NeuN− singlets were then sorted.

Next, we investigated whether TNFα has an effect at PP-GC synapses in TAM-injected hGFAPcreT2/tnfr1cneo/cneo mice with TNFR1 expression functionally reconstituted selectively in astrocytes. Experiments were conducted 10–11 days after TAM onset. A puff of 600 pM TNFα locally in the MML/OML significantly increased mEPSC frequency in GCs (Figure 4A). The cytokine effect was slow and persistent, as observed in wild-type mice (Figure 1B), but less pronounced, possibly because only part of the astrocytic population re-expresses TNFR1 (Figure 3B). In contrast, application of TNFα to slices from OIL-injected hGFAPcreT2/tnfr1cneo/cneo mice (global tnfr1 knockouts, no TAM-induced recombination) produced no synaptic effect (Figure 4B). Any unspecific effect of TAM was also excluded, since in slices from TAM-injected tnfr1cneo/cneo mice, in which TAM cannot induce recombination, TNFα"

However, it is not clear how different mutations of the same gene contribute to different disorders. We characterized two lines of mutant mice with Shank3 mutations linked to ASD and schizophrenia. We found both shared and distinct synaptic and behavioral phenotypes. Mice with the ASD-linked InsG3680 mutation manifest striatal synaptic transmission defects before weaning age and impaired juvenile social interaction, coinciding with the early onset of ASD symptoms. On the other hand, adult mice carrying the schizophrenia-linked R1117X mutation show profound synaptic defects in prefrontal cortex and social dominance behavior. Furthermore, we found differential Shank3 mRNA stability and SHANK1/2 upregulation in these two lines. These data demonstrate that different alleles of the same gene may have distinct phenotypes at molecular, synaptic, and circuit levels in mice, which may inform exploration of these relationships in human patients."

Members of the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family are found in all organisms, from bacteria to human, where they play fundamental roles in chromosome organization and segregation (Hirano, 2012Hirano T.

The archetypal SMC complex, like those found today in prokaryotes, probably acted akin to modern day eukaryotic condensins. They compact chromosomes and aid the resolution of replicated chromatids to facilitate their segregation. How condensin achieves this at the molecular level is not yet clear. The available evidence is consistent with a model in which condensin acts by providing dynamic interactions between pairs of its binding sites (Cheng et al., 2015Cheng T.M.K. Heeger S. Chaleil R.A.G.

Clustering of yeast tRNA genes is mediated by specific association of condensin with tRNA gene transcription complexes.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2204-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The cohesin complex is the crucial mediator of sister chromatid cohesion and appears to be an adaptation of condensin. During the G1 phase of the cell cycle, cohesin acts similarly to condensin, being associated with chromosomes in a dynamic fashion and engaging in contacts between its binding sites (Hadjur et al., 2009Hadjur S. Williams L.M. Ryan N.K. Cobb B.S. Sexton T. Fraser P. Fisher A.G. Merkenschlager M.

During S phase, when chromosomes are replicated, a subset of cohesin is converted into a close-to-permanently chromosome-bound state by acetylation (Rolef Ben-Shahar et al., 2008Rolef Ben-Shahar T.

A molecular determinant for the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion.Science. 2008; 321: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). How cohesins that engage in interactions between newly replicated sister chromatids are singled out for acetylation remains an important question. Irrespective of the answer, stabilization of cohesin by acetylation is essential to establish enduring sister chromatid cohesion. Thus, cohesin can be thought of as a “lockable” condensin. Other contacts that cohesin makes within a chromatid, rather than between sister chromatids, are thought to contribute to gene regulation. In addition, condensin and cohesin facilitate DNA repair processes, to which also a third eukaryotic SMC complex, the Smc5-6 complex, contributes. SMC complexes bind to DNA by topological embrace. This has first been demonstrated in the case of the budding yeast cohesin ring and has meanwhile been confirmed for condensin, the Smc5-6 complex, and a prokaryotic SMC complex (Cuylen et al., 2011Cuylen S.

SMC condensin entraps chromosomal DNA by an ATP hydrolysis dependent loading mechanism in Bacillus subtilis.eLife. 2015; 4: e06659Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, our molecular knowledge of how DNA enters and exits the SMC ring remains scarce. Understanding these DNA transitions at a molecular level will be crucial to comprehend how SMC complexes engage in chromosomal interactions and how those might be regulated. The cohesin ring circumference is made up of a heterodimer of SMC subunits, long flexible coiled-coil proteins. The ring is closed on one side by a stable dimerization interface, known as the SMC hinge. On the other side, a pair of ABC ATPase head domains afford ATP-dependent dimerization. A kleisin subunit (Rad21 in fission yeast) bridges the ATPase heads and stabilizes their interaction. Additional subunits, Scc3 (Psc3 in fission yeast), Pds5, and Wapl make contact with the kleisin to assemble around the ATPase heads. Cohesin loading onto DNA requires ATP hydrolysis by the SMC heads and is promoted by a separate cohesin loader complex (Arumugam et al., 2003Arumugam P. Gruber S. Tanaka K. Haering C.H. Mechtler K.

Dynamic unloading of cohesin from chromosomes in turn is promoted by cohesin’s Wapl subunit by an as yet unknown mechanism (Bernard et al., 2008Bernard P. Schmidt C.K. Vaur S. Dheur S. Drogat J.

Biol. 2013; 23: 64-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Protein engineering has previously been used to close individual cohesin ring interfaces in vivo. This led to the proposal that DNA enters the cohesin ring by opening of the SMC hinge, then exits through the SMC heads and a gap between the kleisin N terminus and Smc3 (Psm3 in fission yeast) (Buheitel and Stemmann, 2013Buheitel J.

This approach has the drawback that protein function might have been affected in ways additional to the intended interface closures. Here, to study DNA entry and exit into and out of the cohesin ring, we have taken a biochemical approach that relies as much as possible on wild-type proteins. We build on our recent biochemical reconstitution of topological cohesin loading onto DNA in vitro, which used a fission-yeast cohesin tetramer complex (Psm1, Psm3, Rad21, and Psc3) and its cohesin loader Mis4-Ssl3. We now add the two remaining cohesin subunits Pds5 and Wapl (Bernard et al., 2008Bernard P. Schmidt C.K. Vaur S. Dheur S. Drogat J. Genier S. Ekwall K. Uhlmann F. Javerzat J.P.

This reveals striking similarities between both directions of DNA transport and leads us to propose a unified model for DNA entry into and exit out of the cohesin ring. A purified fission-yeast cohesin tetramer, consisting of a Psm1-Psm3 dimer, Rad21, and Psc3, topologically loads onto DNA in vitro in a reaction that is facilitated by the Mis4-Ssl3 cohesin loader (Murayama and Uhlmann, 2014Murayama Y. Uhlmann F. Biochemical reconstitution of topological DNA binding by the cohesin ring.Nature. 2014; 505: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Two additional cohesin subunits, Pds5 and Wapl, have been implicated in regulating cohesin’s chromosome association in vivo. To characterize their activities, we purified Pds5 and Wapl following overexpression in budding yeast and E. coli, respectively (Figure 1A). Combining equimolar amounts of Pds5 and Wapl led to formation of a stable heterodimer complex (Figure 1B). We examined Pds5 and Wapl association with the cohesin complex by co-immunoprecipitation. Pull-down of the cohesin tetramer led to co-purification of Pds5 and Wapl, if they were both added (Figure 1C). The cohesin tetramer showed a weaker interaction with Wapl and hardly detectable binding to Pds5 on their own. This suggests that Pds5 and Wapl coordinately bind to the cohesin tetramer. Budding yeast cells contain substoichiometric amounts of Wapl, compared to Pds5 (Chan et al., 2012Chan K.-L. Roig M.B. Hu B. Beckouët F. Metson J. Nasmyth K. Cohesin’s DNA exit gate is distinct from its entrance gate and is regulated by acetylation.Cell. 2012; 150: 961-974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Moreover, Wapl, but not Pds5, is dispensable for cell viability. Therefore, whereas Pds5 and Wapl jointly act in cohesin holocomplex formation, Pds5 must be able to fulfill part of its role independently of Wapl. Pds5 and Wapl associated with a cohesin trimer, containing Psm1-Psm3 and Rad21 but lacking Psc3, with equal efficiency compared to the cohesin tetramer (Figure 1C). This implies that Pds5 and Wapl make extensive contacts with cohesin, in addition to the reported interaction of Wapl with a human Psc3 ortholog (Hara et al., 2014Hara K. Zheng G. Qu Q. Liu H. Ouyang Z. Chen Z. Tomchick D.R. Yu H. Structure of cohesin subcomplex pinpoints direct shugoshin-Wapl antagonism in centromeric cohesion.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We next investigated the impact of Pds5 and Wapl on topological cohesin loading onto a circular DNA substrate. Following incubation in the presence of the cohesin loader and ATP, cohesin is retrieved by immunoprecipitation of Psm3 and bound DNA quantified by gel electrophoresis (Murayama and Uhlmann, 2014Murayama Y. Uhlmann F. Biochemical reconstitution of topological DNA binding by the cohesin ring.Nature. 2014; 505: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). To our surprise, Pds5 addition to the cohesin tetramer markedly inhibited the loading reaction (Figure 1D). Despite not forming a stable complex with cohesin, Pds5 dampened cohesin’s ATPase activity and competed with Mis4-Ssl3 for cohesin binding (Figures S1A and S1B). Strikingly, addition of Wapl to the loading reaction compensated for Pds5’s inhibitory effect and restored loading to levels equal if not greater than that of the cohesin tetramer (Figure 1D). Wapl did not stimulate ATP hydrolysis (Figure S1A), suggesting that it facilitates DNA binding in a different way. Thus, within the cohesin holocomplex that includes Pds5, Wapl facilitates cohesin loading onto DNA. This is at first sight unexpected, as Wapl was thought of as a cohesin unloader. However, we note that budding yeast cells lacking Wapl display reduced chromatin-bound cohesin levels (Rowland et al., 2009Rowland B.D. Roig M.B. Nishino T. Kurze A. Uluocak P. Mishra A. Beckouët F.

Wapl is thought of as a cohesin unloader that facilitates dynamic cohesin turnover on chromosomes (Bernard et al., 2008Bernard P. Schmidt C.K. Vaur S. Dheur S. Drogat J. Genier S. Ekwall K.

Biol. 2013; 23: 64-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We therefore used the following reaction scheme to analyze the cohesin-unloading activity of Wapl (Figure 2A). First, cohesin tetramers were topologically loaded onto DNA, aided by Mis4-Ssl3, in an incubation at low ionic strength (buffer including 30 mM NaCl). This was followed by a second incubation at increased salt concentration (buffer including 150 mM NaCl), when Pds5 and Wapl were added. Cohesin was immunopurified after the first or second incubation and cohesin-bound DNA quantified. If the second incubation lacked additional protein, we observed a small but reproducible loss of DNA, which we interpret as spontaneous DNA unloading (Figure 2B). Addition of Wapl alone did not affect unloading, but addition of Wapl together with Pds5 led to almost complete loss of DNA. Titrating the Wapl concentration showed that even substoichiometric amounts of Wapl efficiently dissociated cohesin from DNA (Figure 2C). The DNA and all the constituent proteins remained intact during these incubations (Figures S2A–S2C), indicating that unloading was not due to nuclease or protease contamination. This suggests that, as well as facilitating DNA entry, Wapl is indeed a potent catalyst of DNA exit from the cohesin ring.Figure S2Characterization of Pds5-Wapl-Mediated Cohesin Unloading, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A–C) The total DNA contained in the reaction was visualized by agarose-gel electrophoresis (A), and cohesin subunits were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining or western blotting, respectively, following the cohesin-unloading incubation (B and C). This confirmed that all macromolecular components remained intact.(D) Mis4-Ssl3 is dispensable for Pds5- and Wapl-dependent cohesin unloading. Cohesin-DNA complexes were recovered by anti-Pk-immunoprecipitation of the Psm3 subunit. Western blotting revealed that Mis4-Ssl3 is not part of the cohesin-DNA complex retrieved by immunoprecipitation.

This confirmed that all macromolecular components remained intact. (D) Mis4-Ssl3 is dispensable for Pds5- and Wapl-dependent cohesin unloading. Cohesin-DNA complexes were recovered by anti-Pk-immunoprecipitation of the Psm3 subunit. Western blotting revealed that Mis4-Ssl3 is not part of the cohesin-DNA complex retrieved by immunoprecipitation. Then a DNA release assay was carried out in the presence of the indicated components (100 nM Psc3, with or without 400 nM of Pds5 and Wapl and 100 nM Mis4-Ssl3). DNA released into the supernatant (“S”) is shown next to the DNA that remained bound to the beads (“B”), the percentage of released DNA was quantified. Addition of increasing concentrations of Pds5, in the absence of Wapl, protected cohesin from spontaneous unloading (Figure 2D). This mirrors the situation during cohesin loading and suggests that Pds5 stabilizes the cohesin ring and counteracts DNA entry or exit. The above unloading reactions were performed in solution, before cohesin was retrieved to analyze bound DNA. We also performed a reaction in which cohesin-DNA complexes were immunopurified after the loading reaction, followed by high-salt washes to remove the Mis4-Ssl3 cohesin loader and other components of the loading reaction. Addition of Pds5 and Wapl, while cohesin remained immobilized on beads, reproduced DNA unloading albeit with lower efficiency (Figure S2D). This setup allowed us to address whether the cohesin loader and ATP play a role in cohesin unloading, as they do during loading. We could not detect a role for Mis4-Ssl3; however, unloading depended on the presence of ATP. Chelating divalent Mg2+ ions by EDTA blocks ATP-dependent reactions. Addition of EDTA after cohesin loading, but before the unloading incubation, abolished cohesin unloading by Pds5-Wapl (Figure 3A). It also blocked the low level of spontaneous, Pds5-Wapl-independent cohesin unloading during the second incubation. This suggests that the topologically DNA-bound cohesin tetramer spontaneously, but inefficiently, unloads from the DNA in an ATP-dependent manner, a reaction that is greatly stimulated by Pds5-Wapl. To confirm the specificity of the EDTA effect and to determine whether ATP must be hydrolyzed for cohesin unloading, we utilized unhydrolyzable ATP-γ-S. Its addition to the unloading reaction, but not additional ATP, blocked cohesin unloading from DNA by Pds5-Wapl (Figure 3A). This suggests that, similar to DNA entry, DNA exit out of the cohesin ring requires ATP hydrolysis. To corroborate that ATP hydrolysis is required for cohesin unloading, we analyzed the behavior of cohesin complexes carrying glutamate-to-glutamine changes in the Walker B motif of the SMC ATPase. In the cases of P. furiosus SMC and budding yeast cohesin, these mutations substantially slow down ATP hydrolysis and stabilize ATP-dependent SMC head dimerization (Arumugam et al., 2006Arumugam P. Nishino T. Haering C.H. Gruber S. Nasmyth K. Cohesin’s ATPase activity is stimulated by the C-terminal Winged-Helix domain of its kleisin subunit.Curr.

We purified fission-yeast cohesin tetramers containing Psm1(E1161Q) “1B,” Psm3(E1128Q) “3B,” or both mutations “1B3B” (Figure S3A). As expected, the rate of ATP hydrolysis by these complexes was substantially reduced, compared to wild-type tetramers (Figure 3B). To our surprise, in vitro loading of cohesin onto DNA was less severely affected. Even 1B3B mutant cohesin complexes retained over half of the topological loading potential of the wild-type complex (Figures 3C, S3B, and S3C). Nonetheless, loading onto DNA of these mutant complexes remained ATP hydrolysis dependent and was inhibited by addition of ATP-γ-S (Figure 3D). This suggests that ATP hydrolysis is not rate limiting for cohesin loading. Rather, adoption of a conformational change, promoted by the cohesin loader, might limit cohesin loading (Murayama and Uhlmann, 2014Murayama Y. Uhlmann F. Biochemical reconstitution of topological DNA binding by the cohesin ring.Nature. 2014; 505: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The conformational change in turn might induce ATP hydrolysis, even if ATPase function is compromised. We came to a similar conclusion from comparing different divalent cations for their ability to support cohesin loading. Replacing Mg2+ with Ca2+ or Mn2+ in the reaction buffer greatly attenuated ATP hydrolysis by cohesin, but to a much lesser degree its loading onto DNA (Figures S3D and S3E). We were now able to prepare comparable amounts of wild-type, 1B, 3B, and 1B3B cohesin-DNA complexes as substrates for cohesin unloading. Whereas 1B cohesin was only mildly affected, 3B cohesin and even more so 1B3B cohesin were greatly defective in unloading by Pds5-Wapl (Figure 3E). This suggests that Walker B motif-dependent ATP hydrolysis is important for DNA exit from the cohesin ring and that ATP hydrolysis limits unloading to a greater degree than the loading reaction. Consistently, Ca2+, which could replace Mg2+ during loading, only inefficiently supported unloading (Figure S3F). Taken together, these results show that both DNA entry into and exit out of the cohesin ring are ATP hydrolysis-dependent reactions. Both reactions therefore likely involve disengagement of the SMC ATPase heads. How does Wapl facilitate both DNA entry into as well as DNA exit out of the cohesin ring? Mis4-Ssl3 stimulates ATP hydrolysis during DNA entry (Murayama and Uhlmann, 2014Murayama Y. Uhlmann F. Biochemical reconstitution of topological DNA binding by the cohesin ring.Nature. 2014; 505: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar); however, the rate of ATP hydrolysis by a cohesin tetramer was not increased by Pds5-Wapl under conditions of both cohesin loading (Figure S1A) or unloading (Figure 4A). It has been suggested that Wapl facilitates cohesin dissociation from chromosomes by opening a DNA exit gate between the kleisin N terminus and Smc3 (Chan et al., 2012Chan K.-L. Roig M.B. Hu B. Beckouët F. Metson J. Nasmyth K.

Characterization of a DNA exit gate in the human cohesin ring.Science. 2014; 346: 968-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether Wapl indeed causes dissociation of the Rad21 N terminus from fission yeast Psm3. We used purified cohesin tetramers in which one of the two separase cleavage sites in Rad21 was changed for the recognition sequence of TEV protease (Murayama and Uhlmann, 2014Murayama Y. Uhlmann F.

Following TEV cleavage, both the N- and C-terminal cleavage products (Rad21N and Rad21C, respectively) remained associated with the cohesin tetramer, which was immunopurified from the reaction via an epitope tag on Psm3. Addition of Pds5-Wapl resulted in loss of Rad21N, but not Rad21C, from the cohesin complex, demonstrating that Pds5-Wapl indeed displaces the kleisin N terminus (Figures 4B and S4A). Rad21N displacement occurred in the presence of ATP or ATP-γ-S, but not in the presence of ADP or in the absence of nucleotide. In contrast, Mis4-Ssl3 in the presence or absence of ATP and DNA did not achieve Rad21N displacement (Figure S4B). These results"

Light sheet microscopy approaches have emerged for cellular-resolution functional brain imaging in small organisms such as larval zebrafish, but remain fundamentally limited in speed. Here, we have developed SPED light sheet microscopy, which combines large volumetric field-of-view via an extended depth of field with the optical sectioning of light sheet microscopy, thereby eliminating the need to physically scan detection objectives for volumetric imaging. SPED enables scanning of thousands of volumes-per-second, limited only by camera acquisition rate, through the harnessing of optical mechanisms that normally result in unwanted spherical aberrations. We demonstrate capabilities of SPED microscopy by performing fast sub-cellular resolution imaging of CLARITY mouse brains and cellular-resolution volumetric Ca(2+) imaging of entire zebrafish nervous systems. Together, SPED light sheet methods enable high-speed cellular-resolution volumetric mapping of biological system structure and function."

Pluripotent stem cells can be induced from somatic cells by nuclear transfer into oocytes, transgene delivery, or treatment with chemical compounds (Gurdon, 1962Gurdon J.B.

Chemically induced reprogramming was first demonstrated by our group in 2013, when we showed that pluripotent stem cells can be generated from mouse somatic cells using a cocktail of seven small molecules (Hou et al., 2013Hou P.

Chemical reprogramming provides a fundamentally new paradigm for studying pluripotency and cell fate reprogramming (Chou and Cheng, 2013Chou B.K. Cheng L.

In addition, this chemical strategy shows promise in cell fate manipulation because small molecules can be cell permeable and easy to manipulate, they do not integrate in to chromosomes, and their effect is reversible. Therefore, chemically induced pluripotent stem cells may have many advantages in cell therapy, disease modeling, and drug discovery (Hou et al., 2013Hou P. Li Y. Zhang X. Liu C. Guan J. Li H. Zhao T.

To date, the molecule roadmap of the reprogramming process has been extensively studied in experiments that induce pluripotency using the transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (OSKM). As previously reported, the changes in gene expression and epigenetic states are primarily induced by two major waves during reprogramming (Hansson et al., 2012Hansson J. Rafiee M.R. Reiland S. Polo J.M. Gehring J. Okawa S. Huber W. Hochedlinger K. Krijgsveld J.

The mesenchymal-to-epithelium transition (MET) mediates an early stage of reprogramming that is induced by OSKM (Li et al., 2010Li R. Liang J. Ni S. Zhou T. Qing X. Li H. He W. Chen J. Li F.

Faddah D.A. Cheng A.W. Itskovich E. Markoulaki S. Ganz K. Klemm S.L. van Oudenaarden A. Jaenisch R. Single-cell expression analyses during cellular reprogramming reveal an early stochastic and a late hierarchic phase.Cell. 2012; 150: 1209-1222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Moreover, a primitive streak-like state has been reported as an intermediate state during the cell fate transition from somatic cells to pluripotent cells (Takahashi et al., 2014Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Sasaki A. Yamamoto M. Nakamura M. Sutou K. Osafune K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotency in human somatic cells via a transient state resembling primitive streak-like mesendoderm.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 3678PubMed Google Scholar). Because chemical reprogramming has been established more recently, comparatively little is known about the reprogramming process that is induced by small molecules. In particular, the small-molecule cocktails that are used in chemical reprogramming have been identified by phenotypic screening and do not involve the direct activation of classical reprogramming factors (Hou et al., 2013Hou P. Li Y. Zhang X. Liu C. Guan J. Li H. Zhao T. Ye J. Yang W. Liu K. et al.Pluripotent stem cells induced from mouse somatic cells by small-molecule compounds.Science. 2013; 341: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar), such as Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. Therefore, it is intriguing to speculate about the similarities and differences between OSKM-induced and chemically induced reprogramming. In addition, a major advantage of the chemical approach is that small molecules can be fine-tuned in terms of their concentrations, durations, structures, and combinations, providing the opportunity to manipulate the chemically induced pluripotent stem cells (CiPSC) generation process more precisely during each stage of reprogramming. Therefore, the identification of key molecular events and intermediate cell states would help greatly improve the efficiency of reprogramming by allowing for the fine-tuning of small molecules and culture conditions based on the markers of each stage of reprogramming. In this study, we identified an extraembryonic endoderm (XEN)-like state as an intermediate during the early stage of chemical reprogramming. Moreover, the chemical reprogramming efficiency is greatly enhanced by small-molecule boosters and the more precise optimization of the reprogramming conditions for each step identified with the XEN-like state as an indicator. In our previously developed method for inducing pluripotent stem cells from fibroblasts, there are three essential stages in the chemical reprogramming process. During these stages, a cocktail of five small molecules, “VC6TF” (VPA, CHIR99021, 616452, tranylcypromine, and forskolin), was used in stage 1 for 16–20 days; another small molecule, DZNep, was added at the start of stage 2 for the next 20–24 days; and 2i-medium (with dual inhibition of ERK and GSK3 with PD0325901 and CHIR99021, respectively) was used in stage 3 for the last 12–16 days. In total, the chemical reprogramming process can take as long as 48–60 days (Hou et al., 2013Hou P. Li Y. Zhang X. Liu C. Guan J. Li H. Zhao T. Ye J. Yang W. Liu K. et al.Pluripotent stem cells induced from mouse somatic cells by small-molecule compounds.Science. 2013; 341: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). To dissect the chemical reprogramming process, we carefully followed the change in cell morphology during chemical reprogramming in each stage. Notably, we found that at the end of stage 1, a number of epithelial colonies formed, and these epithelial cells rapidly expanded during stage 2. More importantly, by tracing the dynamic changes in cell fate during chemical reprogramming, we found that CiPSCs predominantly emerged from the inside of these epithelial cell colonies (Figures 1A, 1B , and S1A). In some experiments, 100% of the CiPSCs were generated from these colonies, even when the cells were re-plated at a lower density; the epithelial cell colonies had grown to <20% confluence. These findings indicate that CiPSCs may be generated from these epithelial cells.Figure S1The Induction of Cell Colonies Expressing XEN Cell Markers Is a Cornerstone Event during Chemical Reprogramming, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Imaging tracing of the formation process of two CiPSC colonies (stage 3) in stage 1 and stage 2 during chemical reprogramming.

Scale bars, 100 μm. Data are represented as mean ± SD. To better understand these epithelial colonies as the potential intermediates of chemical reprogramming, we next used immunofluorescence and qRT-PCR to examine the gene expression pattern of these epithelial cell colonies. By immunofluorescence, we found that all epithelial colonies formed in the end of stage 1 co-expressed SALL4, GATA4, and SOX17, master genes of XENs (Lim et al., 2008Lim C.Y. Tam W.L. Zhang J. Ang H.S. Jia H. Lipovich L. Ng H.H. Wei C.L. Sung W.K. Robson P. et al.Sall4 regulates distinct transcription circuitries in different blastocyst-derived stem cell lineages.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 543-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) (Figure 1C). Our qRT-PCR analysis further detected the expression of other XEN marker genes, such as Sox7 and Gata6 in these colonies (Figure 1D). More importantly, we found expression level of these genes was comparable to that of embryo-derived XEN cells (eXENs) (Kunath et al., 2005Kunath T. Arnaud D. Uy G.D. Okamoto I. Chureau C. Yamanaka Y. Heard E. Gardner R.L. Avner P. Rossant J. Imprinted X-inactivation in extra-embryonic endoderm cell lines from mouse blastocysts.Development. 2005; 132: 1649-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) (Figure 1D). Then, we referred to the epithelial cells expressing XEN markers as XEN-like cells. We next examined whether these XEN-like cells represent an intermediate state of chemical reprogramming. Using a XEN-expressing surface protein, EpCAM, we enriched XEN-like cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and found that selection for EpCAM-positive cells greatly enriched the proportions of cells forming XEN-like cell colonies and subsequently generating CiPSCs by >20-fold (Figures 1E and S1B). Moreover, in another study by our group, we generated CiPSCs from neural stem cells and intestinal epithelial cells (Ye et al., 2015Ye J. Ge J. Zhang X. Cheng L. Zhang Z. He S. Wang Y. Lin H. Yang W. Liu J. et al.Pluripotent stem cells induced from mouse neural stem cells and small intestinal epithelial cells by small molecule compounds.Cell Res. 2015; https://doi.org/10.1038/cr.2015.142Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and found that EpCAM also strongly enriched the cells that formed XEN-like colonies during chemical reprogramming and further generated CiPSCs from these two initial cell types (Figure S1C). In addition, we speculated that transitional colonies that co-expressed XEN master genes and pluripotency-associated genes could be captured, if pluripotent stem cells were induced from XEN-like cells. To determine this, we detected cells that co-expressed GATA4 and OCT4 during stage 2 of reprogramming (Figure S1D), and we observed cell colonies in stage 3 expressing GATA4 in the peripheral and expressing pOct4-GFP in the middle of the colonies, which could be the cell colonies under cell fate transition from XEN-like cells to pluripotent stem cells (Figure S1D). Together, these results indicate that the XEN-like cells represent an intermediate state of chemical reprogramming toward pluripotency. The identification of an intermediate state of chemical reprogramming provides a new opportunity to optimize the reprogramming conditions and to screen novel small-molecule boosters in early reprogramming by using XEN-like colony numbers as the readout. In our previous study, we found that an enhanced concentration of CHIR99021 (from 10 μM to 20 μM) during stage 1 facilitates the generation of CiPSCs from neonatal and adult fibroblasts (Hou et al., 2013Hou P. Li Y. Zhang X. Liu C. Guan J. Li H. Zhao T. Ye J. Yang W. Liu K. et al.Pluripotent stem cells induced from mouse somatic cells by small-molecule compounds.Science. 2013; 341: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Here, we found that the increased concentration of CHIR99021 is also beneficial for the formation of XEN-like colonies from MEFs (Figure 2A). Through qRT-PCR analysis, we found that this increased concentration of CHIR99021 promotes an up to 10-fold increase in the expression of XEN master genes Gata4 and Sox17 and an epithelium cell marker, EpCAM (Figures 2B and S2A).Figure S2Identification of Small Molecules that Promote the Transition from Fibroblasts to the XEN-like Cells, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) qRT-PCR analysis of MET markers (EpCAM, Cdh1) expression after treatment of VC6TF (CHIR, 10 μM and 20 μM) for 12 days.(B) Numbers of SALL4 and GATA4 double-positive colonies after treatment with VC6TF (CHIR, 20 μM), and that with AM580, EPZ004777 (EPZ) and with their combination for 12 days.(C) qRT-PCR analysis of MET markers (Cdh1, EpCAM) expression after treatment with VC6TF (CHIR, 20 μM) and that with AM580 (A), EPZ004777 (E) and A plus E for 12 days.(D) qRT-PCR analysis of Gata4, Gata6, Sox17, Lin28a, EpCAM and Cdh1 expression in cells treated by different small molecule cocktails during stage 1. eXEN and CiPSCs were set as controls.Data are represented as mean ± SD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) qRT-PCR analysis of MET markers (EpCAM, Cdh1) expression after treatment of VC6TF (CHIR, 10 μM and 20 μM) for 12 days.

USA. 2011; 108: 18283-18288Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) in the presence of a small-molecule cocktail, VC6TF, with 20 μM CHIR99021, on the reprogramming of cell fate from fibroblasts to XEN-like cells. Among the tested small molecules, an RA agonist, AM580 (A), and a DOT1L inhibitor, EPZ004777 (E), enhanced the formation of XEN-like colonies by 2- to 3-fold (Figure 2C). When these small molecules were used together in a cocktail of seven small molecules, VC6TFAE, the number of XEN-like colonies was enhanced by >5-fold (Figure 2C). These findings were further validated by counting the numbers of SALL4 and GATA4 double-positive colonies and by detecting the expression of XEN marker genes by qRT-PCR (Figures 2D, 2E, and S2B–S2D). Together, the numbers of XEN-like colonies, an indicator of early reprogramming, could be enhanced more than 50-fold by adjusting the small molecule concentrations and adding additional small molecules. The enhanced generation of XEN-like colonies facilitated the screening of small molecules that promote the transition from XEN-like cells to CiPSCs during stages 2 and 3. Previously, the optimized duration for stage 2 was 20–24 days; few CiPSC colonies could be obtained if stage 2 was shortened to 12 days (Hou et al., 2013Hou P. Li Y. Zhang X. Liu C. Guan J. Li H. Zhao T. Ye J. Yang W. Liu K. et al.Pluripotent stem cells induced from mouse somatic cells by small-molecule compounds.Science. 2013; 341: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Here, we conducted small-molecule screenings in the presence of small molecule cocktail VC6TFA plus DZNep (Z) for only 12 days instead of 20–24 days of stage 2. After screening 88 selected small molecules, we found that CiPSC colonies formed in stage 3 only when supplemented with 5-aza-dC during stage 2 (Figure 3A). Next, we found that 5-aza-dC (D) and EPZ004777 (E) had synergistic effects and promoted the kinetics of stage 2 (Figure 3A). By using a cocktail of eight small molecules, VC6TFAZDE, for 12 days during stage 2, we were able to obtain up to 20 CiPSC colonies from 100,000 re-plated cells at the end of the reprogramming process of 44 days (Figure 3A). In contrast, few CiPSC colonies were obtained during the same time course without 5-aza-dC and EPZ004777. Strikingly, when we used another DOT1L inhibitor, SGC0946 (S), in place of EPZ004777 during stage 2 (Figures S3A and S3B), the reprogramming efficiency was increased further by as much as 5-fold (Figures 3A and 3B), particularly when an optimized 2i-medium (N2B27-2iL medium) was used (Figures 3C and S3B). Next, we further optimized the duration and concentration of the small molecules and the re-plating cell density (Figures 3D, 3E, and S3C–S3E). Using the small-molecule cocktail VC6TFAZDS during stage 2 for 12 days, we were able to induce ∼100–600 CiPSC colonies from 50,000 re-plated cells during the final stage of chemical reprogramming. Notably, although SGC0946 can be more effective than EPZ004777 during stage 2, SGC0946 was not able to substitute for EPZ004777 during stage 1 because cell viability was decreased if SGC0946 was used from the start of chemical reprogramming. Importantly, CiPSC colonies emerged from 24%–53% of the XEN-like colonies in five independent experiments, indicating the transition ratio of a single XEN-like cell in the start of stage 2 to CiPSCs in the end of stage 3 (Figure S3F). In addition, almost all CiPSC colonies were derived from XEN-like colonies, even though the efficiency was greatly improved (Figure S3G). In particular, we found that the duration of the small-molecule treatment and the re-plating cell density were both highly critical during the later stages of reprogramming. Although the old protocol favors a re-plating cell density of 300,000 cells per well (Hou et al., 2013Hou P. Li Y. Zhang X. Liu C. Guan J. Li H. Zhao T. Ye J. Yang W. Liu K. et al.Pluripotent stem cells induced from mouse somatic cells by small-molecule compounds.Science. 2013; 341: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar), the new protocol favors a cell density of 50,000–100,000 cells per well of a 6-well plate (Figure 3D). Furthermore, our initial protocol required 20–24 days of reprogramming during stage 2 to achieve optimal reprogramming efficiency (Hou et al., 2013Hou P. Li Y. Zhang X. Liu C. Guan J. Li H. Zhao T. Ye J. Yang W. Liu K. et al.Pluripotent stem cells induced from mouse somatic cells by small-molecule compounds.Science. 2013; 341: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar), whereas our new protocol had an optimal stage 2 duration of 12 days (Figure 3E). In summary, we were able to greatly improve the cell transition from XEN to pluripotent stem cells by adding new small molecules, modifying the small-molecule structure and optimizing the re-plating density and time course of small-molecule treatment. Next, we combined the optimized reprogramming conditions for stages 1, 2, and 3. Using this new protocol, a well of 50,000 initial fibroblasts was induced, and the cells were expanded to >1,000,000 or more re-plated cells (re-plated into 10–15 wells). A total of 1,000–9,000 CiPSC colonies were obtained at the end of the reprogramming period with a total induction time of 40 days (16, 12, and 12 days for stages 1, 2, and 3, respectively) (Figure 4A). Moreover, this new protocol was reproduced independently more than 30 times, and CiPSCs could also be generated from neonatal dermal fibroblasts (MNFs) and adult lung fibroblasts (MAFs) at a significantly enhanced efficiency (Figure 4B). We further examined the minimal time course required in inducing CiPSCs by using this new small-molecule cocktail and the optimized reprogramming conditions. We found that a minimum of 12 days were required in the formation of XEN-like colonies (cells were re-plated at day 8), and at least another 14 days were required to induce CiPSCs from XEN-like cells (Figure 4C). In total, at the cost of efficiency, a minimum of 26 days are required to induce CiPSCs by using the new protocol (Figure 4C). In comparison, at least 44 days were required to generate only 0–1 CiPSC colony from 40,000 initial cells using the original protocol at day 44. CiPSC colonies were then picked to establish CiPSC lines for further characterization. As shown by qRT-PCR and immunostaining, the CiPSCs expressed all the tested marker genes for pluripotent stem cells, such as Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog (Figures 4D and 4E). Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we found that CiPSCs induced with this new protocol had gene expression profiles similar to those of ESCs (Figures S4A and S4B). CiPSCs were further tested for their potential for in vivo development, and we found that all six tested CiPSC lines were able to form teratoma after injection into SCID mice (Figure 4F) and generate chimeric mice after blastocyst injection (Figure 4G). Among five tested CiPSC lines, four lines showed germline integration potential in chimeric mice, and germline transmission offspring were obtained from chimeric mice (Figure 4G). Moreover, CiPSCs were maintained with normal karyotypes (Figure S4C). Together, these results indicate that we were able to establish a robust CiPSC induction protocol by manipulating the cell fate transition more precisely through the XEN-like state. The robust CiPSC induction method developed here allowed us to better study the molecular mechanisms underlying the reprogramming process. We then examined the expression of some typical pluripotency-associated genes during chemical reprogramming, and we revealed the sequential expression of pluripotency genes (Figures 5A and 5C ). Through single cell qRT-PCR, we found that ∼50% of the cells in stage 2 co-expressed XEN cell markers (Figure S5A).Figure S5Gene Expression Dynamics during CiPSC Generation, Related to Figure 5Show full caption(A) Scatter plot diagram of single cell qRT-PCR analysis in the expression of Sall4 and Gata4, Gata4 and Sox17, and Sall4 and Sox2, respectively, at the indicated time points.

Delivery of antibody therapeutics into the brain to treat central nervous system (CNS) diseases has been a major drug development challenge. With the support of astrocytes and pericytes, a monolayer of endothelial cells creates the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which serves to restrict movement of substances from the circulating blood to the CNS. Generally, only ∼0.1% of circulating antibodies cross the intact BBB, severely limiting the therapeutic utility of antibody therapeutics for CNS disorders (Poduslo et al., 1994Poduslo J.F.

Many endogenous molecules in circulation are able to cross the BBB via specific receptors and transporters expressed on the luminal side of brain endothelial cells. These membrane protein pathways provide a promising route for delivering antibodies across the BBB by utilizing receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) (Fishman et al., 1987Fishman J.B. Rubin J.B.

For example, systemic administration of antibodies against the transferrin receptor (TfR), which is highly expressed on BECs, dramatically enhances CNS delivery of these antibodies across the BBB in both rodents and nonhuman primates (Jefferies et al., 1984Jefferies W.A.

However, targeting TfR with antibodies posed safety liabilities (Couch et al., 2013Couch J.A. Yu Y.J. Zhang Y. Tarrant J.M. Fuji R.N. Meilandt W.J. Solanoy H. Tong R.K. Hoyte K. Luk W. et al.Addressing safety liabilities of TfR bispecific antibodies that cross the blood-brain barrier.Sci. Transl. Med. 2013; 5 (183ra57, 1–12)Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Although mitigation strategies could be developed, the identification of additional RMT targets for enhanced brain delivery is warranted. A number of other BBB receptors have been explored for RMT, but their ability to transport therapeutically relevant doses of antibodies into the brain remains to be demonstrated. In the current study, we generated antibodies against several potential protein targets and tested for their uptake in brain in vivo. We first addressed whether antibodies against previously studied RMT targets could accumulate in brain. We also tested RMT targets identified by differential gene expression analysis via microarray. Finally, an unbiased proteomics approach was used to identify highly expressed transmembrane proteins from isolated mouse primary BECs. Using this approach, three transmembrane BEC proteins were identified as novel candidates for transporting therapeutic antibodies across the BBB. Several murine RMT targets were evaluated for their ability to transport antibodies across the BBB using the screening cascade outlined in Figure 1A. Antibodies that bound specifically to murine antigen as assessed by flow cytometry (FACS) were tested qualitatively for their ability to target mouse brain in vivo by immunostaining mouse cortical tissue 1 hr after a 5 mg/kg dose. Because binding affinity of the antibody to the RMT target can influence brain uptake depending on the dosing paradigm, both a radiolabeled trace dose (∼0.1 mg/kg) and a higher therapeutically relevant dose (20 mg/kg) were then used to assess brain uptake of potential RMT antibodies (Yu et al., 2011Yu Y.J. Zhang Y. Kenrick M. Hoyte K. Luk W. Lu Y. Atwal J. Elliott J.M. Prabhu S. Watts R.J. Dennis M.S. Boosting brain uptake of a therapeutic antibody by reducing its affinity for a transcytosis target.Sci. Transl. Med. 2011; 3: 84ra44Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). As a final assessment, selected antibodies were engineered as bispecific antibodies containing a monovalent anti-BACE1 arm. This allows a direct demonstration of antibody delivery into the brain by measuring β-amyloid (Aβ) concentrations as a function of BACE1 inhibition (Yu et al., 2011Yu Y.J. Zhang Y. Kenrick M. Hoyte K. Luk W. Lu Y. Atwal J. Elliott J.M. Prabhu S. Watts R.J. Dennis M.S. Boosting brain uptake of a therapeutic antibody by reducing its affinity for a transcytosis target.Sci. Transl. Med. 2011; 3: 84ra44Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). We first evaluated two commonly studied RMT targets, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (Lrp1) and insulin receptor (InsR), for their ability to deliver antibodies into mouse brains. Antibodies against murine Lrp1 and InsR were generated from naive antibody phage libraries. FACs analysis using HEK293 cells expressing murine Lrp1 or InsR confirmed positive binding (Figure 1B). However, these antibodies did not appear to localize to brain vasculature in vivo as assessed by immunostaining of mouse cortical tissue 1 hr after a 5 mg/kg dose (Figure 1C). As a positive control, an anti-TfRA exhibited pronounced brain vascular distribution following systemic administration (Yu et al., 2011Yu Y.J. Zhang Y. Kenrick M. Hoyte K. Luk W. Lu Y. Atwal J. Elliott J.M. Prabhu S. Watts R.J. Dennis M.S. Boosting brain uptake of a therapeutic antibody by reducing its affinity for a transcytosis target.Sci. Transl.

To determine whether anti-Lrp1 and anti-InsR can accumulate in brain, radiolabeled I125-control IgG, I125-anti-TfRA, I125-anti-Lrp1, or I125-anti-InsR were IV injected into wild-type mice, and radioactivity was measured. A significant increase in brain uptake, as measured by percent of injected dose per gram of brain tissue, was observed only for I125-anti-TfRA, whereas brain uptake of both I125-anti-Lrp1 and I125-anti-InsR were similar to I125-control IgG (Figure 1D). Using a higher therapeutically relevant dose (20 mg/kg) of anti-Lrp1 did not improve brain accumulation of antibody above that observed for a control IgG, while anti-InsR exhibited a modest increase in brain levels at both time points, but well below anti-TfRA (Figure 1E). Together, these results show that of these widely studied receptors, only antibodies against TfR exhibit robust brain uptake. To identify novel RMT targets, we first took a gene expression analysis approach and reasoned that RMT candidates specifically expressed by BECs could target therapeutics selectively to brain by reducing target-mediated clearance in peripheral organs and improving pharmacokinetics (PK) in vivo. A previous microarray expression profile of FACS-purified mouse brain endothelial cells (Tam et al., 2012Tam S.J. Richmond D.L. Kaminker J.S. Modrusan Z. Martin-McNulty B. Cao T.C. Weimer R.M. Carano R.A.D. van Bruggen N. Watts R.J. Death receptors DR6 and TROY regulate brain vascular development.Dev. Cell. 2012; 22: 403-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) identified two single-pass transmembrane proteins, Ldlrad3 and CD320, each selectively expressed at a higher level by BECs relative to liver and lung endothelial cells (Figure 2A). Interestingly, Tfrc had higher mRNA expression at the BEC, while Lrp1 and Insr lacked any enhanced BEC expression compared to liver and lung endothelial cells, suggesting some commonly studied RMT targets lack selective enrichment at the BBB. Antibodies against mouse Ldlrad3 and CD320 were generated to investigate whether these selectively expressed receptors could enhance brain uptake. FACs analysis using HEK293 cells expressing murine receptor was used to confirm antigen-specific cell surface binding for both antibodies (Figure 2B). Immunostaining of cortical brain tissue 1 hr after a 5 mg/kg dose revealed modest immunoreactivity for anti-Ldlrad3 and a lack of antibody localization for anti-CD320 (Figure 2C). Following an intravenous trace dose of I125-control IgG, I125-anti-TfRA, I125-anti-Ldlrad3, or I125-anti-CD320 administered to wild-type mice, only I125-anti-TfRA exhibited significant uptake in brain. I125-anti-Ldlrad3 and I125-anti-CD320 accumulated in brain at levels comparable to I125-control IgG (Figure 2D). Similar results were observed using a higher therapeutic dose (Figures 2E and 2F). Together, these results indicate that enrichment of plasma membrane receptors in BECs alone is not likely sufficient to identify candidate RMT targets that support antibody transport across the BBB. Although relative transcript levels of Ldlrad3 and Cd320 were selectively enriched in BECs, we reasoned that their absolute protein level at the BBB may be a limiting factor to sufficiently transport antibody across the BBB, as suggested by the poor brain immunostaining (Figure 2C). We thus employed a proteomics approach to identify transmembrane proteins that are highly expressed in BECs to investigate whether protein levels would better predict potential RMT receptors. We used FACs to isolate CD31-positive/CD45-negative BECs from wild-type mice as previously described (Tam et al., 2012Tam S.J. Richmond D.L. Kaminker J.S. Modrusan Z. Martin-McNulty B. Cao T.C.

Cell. 2012; 22: 403-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A). The mass spectrometry analysis of FACs-purified BECs identified established endothelial cell-specific proteins as expected (Figure 3B). Peptide counts from the negatively selected non-BEC lysate (i.e., CD31-negative/CD45-negative) revealed an abundance of glial-specific proteins indicating a mixed population of glial cells and neurons (Zhang et al., 2014Zhang Y. Chen K. Sloan S.A. Bennett M.L. Scholze A.R. O’Keeffe S. Phatnani H.P. Guarnieri P. Caneda C.

In the BEC population, peptide counts revealed TfR to be the highest single-pass transmembrane protein, while protein levels of Lrp1, InsR, Ldlrad3, and CD320 were all below detection (Figure 3C). Interestingly, some peptide counts of Lrp1 were detected in the non-BEC population, which is consistent with previous reports that Lrp1 expression is restricted to neurons, pericytes, and other glial cells (Lillis et al., 2005Lillis A.P. Mikhailenko I. Strickland D.K. Beyond endocytosis: LRP function in cell migration, proliferation and vascular permeability.J. Thromb.

Thus, the poor brain antibody delivery of previously described RMT targets (LRP and InsR) is likely explained by the low abundance of these proteins on BECs. Importantly, this proteomics analysis revealed several highly abundant transmembrane proteins that have not been previously studied for RMT of antibodies. These include the extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer basigin (Bsg), the glucose transporter Glut1, and the solute carrier CD98 heavy chain (CD98hc) (Figure 3C). In agreement with our results, a recently published comprehensive RNA-seq transcriptome analysis of distinct cell populations in the mouse brain also reveals high absolute mRNA levels for Tfrc, Bsg, Slc2a1 (Glut1), and Slc3a2 (CD98hc) and very low absolute mRNA levels for Lrp1, Insr, Ldlrad3, and Cd320 on BECs (Figure 3D; Zhang et al., 2014Zhang Y.

To test whether high protein levels at the BBB correlates with potentially high transport capacity, we generated antibodies against these abundantly expressed targets and evaluated their RMT potential in vivo. A total of five distinct antibodies against murine basigin, Glut1, and CD98hc were generated and evaluated: two for anti-Bsg (A and B), one for anti-Glut1, and two for anti-CD98hc (A and B). Binding was confirmed by FACs using HEK293 cells expressing the respective murine antigen (Figure 4A). In vivo antibody binding was assessed by immunostaining of cortical tissue 1 hr postdose from wild-type mice IV injected with a 5 mg/kg dose. Pronounced vascular localization was observed with all five antibodies at levels comparable to what was previously observed with anti-TfRA (Figure 4B, compared to Figure 1C). A radiolabel trace dose of the higher-affinity I125-anti-BsgA revealed a significant accumulation in brain for the duration of the study, while there was only a modest accumulation in the lower-affinity I125-anti-BsgB compared to I125-control IgG (Figure 4C). The difference between the two anti-Bsg clones may be due to differences in their binding epitope and/or affinity to Bsg. The latter possibility would be consistent with the affinity-dependent differences previously observed with anti-TfR antibody variants at trace dose levels (Yu et al., 2011Yu Y.J. Zhang Y. Kenrick M. Hoyte K. Luk W. Lu Y. Atwal J. Elliott J.M. Prabhu S. Watts R.J. Dennis M.S. Boosting brain uptake of a therapeutic antibody by reducing its affinity for a transcytosis target.Sci. Transl. Med. 2011; 3: 84ra44Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). I125-anti-Glut1 also accumulated in brain compared to I125-control IgG at all time points postdose (Figure 4D). Most strikingly, brain concentrations of both I125-anti-CD98hcA and I125-anti-CD98hcB were the highest of the three RMT targets evaluated, with both anti-CD98hc clones reaching brain levels ∼80- to 90-fold above control IgG and ∼4- to 5-fold above I125-anti-TfRA at their peaks (Figure 4E, note differences in scale from Figures 4C and 4D). Other tissue distribution was also examined and we found greater accumulation of anti-CD98hc antibodies in liver and lung compared to control IgG (data not shown). When wild-type mice were IV injected with a higher therapeutic dose of 20 mg/kg, ∼2- to 4-fold higher levels of anti-BsgA and anti-BsgB were observed in brain at 1 and 24 hr relative to control IgG, comparable to anti-TfRA at both time points (Figures 4F and see Figure S2A available online). In a similar experiment using a 20 mg/kg dose of anti-Glut1, brain concentrations of anti-Glut1 were ∼1.5- to 3-fold higher than control IgG and comparable to anti-TfRA at both time points (Figures 4G and S2B). Of the three RMT candidates, systemic injections of CD98hc antibodies revealed the highest brain concentrations. Brain concentrations of anti-CD98hcA and anti-CD98hcB were ∼9- and 11-fold over that of control IgG, respectively, at 24 hr postdose (Figures 4H and S2C). Furthermore, at 24 hr, brain levels of anti-CD98hcA were significantly higher than that of anti-TfRA. Although all three RMT candidates showed brain uptake by trace and therapeutic dosing, these in vivo studies reveal CD98hc to be the most robust RMT candidate. To further confirm that dosed antibodies definitively cross the BBB and penetrate parenchyma, we assessed the amount of antibody retained in the parenchyma fraction after microvessel depletion of brain homogenates by ELISA. Dosed antibody was clearly detected for all three targets compared to the control antibody, suggesting there was significant passage of antibody across the BBB which bound to the parenchyma isolates (Figure S2D). Consistent with trace and therapeutic dose studies, anti-CD98hc antibody in the parenchyma fraction showed the greatest brain concentration (Figure S2D). The minimal uptake of anti-Glut1 may be a consequence of the specific expression of Glut1 (Slc2a1) in BECs; the protocol to deplete microvessels may not allow for an accurate quantification of remaining antibody in the parenchymal fraction where no antigen is expressed. Thus, antibodies against CD98hc were selected for further in vivo validation as bispecific antibodies as a result of multiple lines of evidence showing the most robust uptake in brain. In order to provide a robust CNS pharmacodynamic (PD) readout that would confirm the ability of an antibody to cross the BBB, we generated bispecific antibodies that bind to CD98hc on one arm, and to the amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage enzyme β-secretase (BACE1) on the other arm (Atwal et al., 2011Atwal J.K. Chen Y. Chiu C. Mortensen D.L. Meilandt W.J. Liu Y. Heise C.E. Hoyte K. Luk W. Lu Y. et al.A therapeutic antibody targeting BACE1 inhibits amyloid-β production in vivo.Sci. Transl. Med. 2011; 3: 84ra43Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). BACE1 is an enzyme that is considered to be the primary generator of Aβ found in plaques in the brains of Alzheimer’s disease patients (Vassar et al., 1999Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. et al.Beta-secretase cleavage of Alzheimer’s amyloid precursor protein by the transmembrane aspartic protease BACE.Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3306) Google Scholar). We previously generated an antibody against BACE1 to inhibit enzymatic activity and thereby reduce Aβ production (Atwal et al., 2011Atwal J.K. Chen Y. Chiu C. Mortensen D.L. Meilandt W.J. Liu Y. Heise C.E. Hoyte K. Luk W. Lu Y. et al.A therapeutic antibody targeting BACE1 inhibits amyloid-β production in vivo.Sci. Transl. Med. 2011; 3: 84ra43Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). However, this antibody has poor BBB penetration and was ineffective at reducing brain Aβ unless dosed at very high concentrations, or paired with anti-TfR as a bispecific antibody (Atwal et al., 2011Atwal J.K. Chen Y. Chiu C. Mortensen D.L. Meilandt W.J. Liu Y. Heise C.E. Hoyte K. Luk W. Lu Y. et al.A therapeutic antibody targeting BACE1 inhibits amyloid-β production in vivo.Sci. Transl. Med. 2011; 3: 84ra43Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, Yu et al., 2011Yu Y.J. Zhang Y. Kenrick M. Hoyte K. Luk W. Lu Y. Atwal J. Elliott J.M. Prabhu S. Watts R.J. Dennis M.S. Boosting brain uptake of a therapeutic antibody by reducing its affinity for a transcytosis target.Sci. Transl. Med. 2011; 3: 84ra44Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Both anti-CD98hcA and anti-CD98hcB were reformatted as bispecific antibodies to allow for a direct assessment of CD98hc-mediated antibody transport across the BBB into the parenchyma through the measurement of brain Aβ levels (refer to Figure 1A). A reduction in CD98hc binding affinity was observed when bivalent anti-CD98hc was converted into a monovalent/bispecific format as measured by competitive ELISA (Figure 5A). While the affinity of anti-CD98hcA was reduced only ∼2-fold, the affinity of anti-CD98hcB was reduced by ∼100-fold, indicating that avidity plays an important role in the bivalent binding of this particular antibody. Radiolabel trace dosing revealed significantly higher peak brain uptake at 1 hr postdose of anti-CD98hcA/BACE1 compared to both control IgG and anti-TfRA/BACE1 (Figure 5B; p < 0.0001). The lower affinity anti-CD98hcB/BACE1 exhibited increased brain uptake compared to control IgG but was below that of anti-CD98hcA/BACE1, likely due to the substantial reduction in binding affinity to CD98hc as a bispecific antibody (Yu et al., 2011Yu Y.J. Zhang Y. Kenrick M. Hoyte K. Luk W. Lu Y. Atwal J. Elliott J.M. Prabhu S. Watts R.J. Dennis M.S. Boosting brain uptake of a therapeutic antibody by reducing its affinity for a transcytosis target.Sci. Transl. Med. 2011; 3: 84ra44Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). To determine extent and duration of anti-CD98hc/BACE1 brain uptake and PD response, a single 50 mg/kg IV injection of either control IgG or anti-CD98hc/BACE1 was administered in wild-type mice. Plasma clearance of the higher affinity anti-CD98hcA/BACE1 antibody was much faster compared to the lower affinity anti-CD98hcB/BACE1, as would be expected for a target-mediated clearance mechanism (Figure 5C). Both anti-CD98hc/BACE1 bispecifics showed significant brain accumulation up to 4 days postdose (Figure 5D). Brain concentrations of anti-CD98hcB/BACE1 remained elevated at day 7 postdose, while the concentration of anti-CD98hcA/BACE1 was comparable to control IgG at this later time point. Taken together, the lower affinity anti-CD98hcB/BACE1 produced better peripheral and brain exposure over time compared to the higher affinity anti-CD98hcA/BACE1 (Figures 5C and 5D). A similar inverse relationship between antibody affinity and brain exposure was also previously observed for anti-TfR/BACE1 antibodies (Couch et al., 2013Couch J.A. Yu Y.J. Zhang Y. Tarrant J.M. Fuji R.N. Meilandt W.J. Solanoy H. Tong R.K. Hoyte K. Luk W. et al.Addressing safety liabilities of TfR bispecific antibodies that cross the blood-brain barrier.Sci. Transl. Med. 2013; 5 (183ra57, 1–12)Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Importantly, both CD98hc/BACE1 antibodies reduced brain Aβ by ∼30%–45% compared to control IgG-treated mice up to 4 days postdose, demonstrating successful transport of these antibodies into the brain parenchyma (Figures 5E and 5F). We also performed in vivo two-photon microscopy to visualize the real-time trafficking of fluorescently labeled CD98hc/BACE1 bispecific variants within the parenchyma and subcortical vasculature of therapeutically dosed mice (Figure S3). Compared to mice dosed with control IgG and anti-CD98hcB/BACE1, we detected a distinct difference in the vascular clearance of anti-CD98hcA/BACE1, as predicted by the faster plasma PK of the higher affinity variant (Figure S3). In addition, we observed greater diffuse signal in the parenchyma of mice dosed with fluorescently labeled anti-CD98hcB/BACE1 by 48 hr, and to a lesser extent anti-CD98hcA/BACE1, indicating enhanced crossing of the antibody through the BBB. Immunocytochemistry on primary mouse BECs revealed that a majority of CD98hc localized to the plasma membrane with some colocalization with caveolin1- and EEA1-positive puncta (Figure S4). Very few puncta colocalized with TfR, a marker of recycling endosomes. We previously observed that antibodies against TfR drive lysosomal degradation of TfR in an affinity-dependent manner, leading to decreased TfR levels both in vitro and in vivo (Bien-Ly et al., 2014Bien-Ly N. Yu Y.J. Bumbaca D. Elstrott J. Boswell C.A. Zhang Y. Luk W. Lu Y. Dennis M.S. Weimer R.M. et al.Transferrin receptor (TfR) trafficking determines brain uptake of TfR antibody affinity variants.J. Exp. Med. 2014; 211: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the endogenous levels of CD98hc in IMCD3 cells. IMCD3s were used as CD98hc is highly expressed in the kidney tubules, and this cell line also form tight junction barrier with uniform CD98hc expression levels. Cells treated with increasing concentrations of anti-CD98hc bispecific antibodies did not change the expression level or stability of CD98hc (Figures 6A and 6B ). We also examined whether antibody treatment induced changes in the subcellular localization of CD98hc. Consistent with the western blot results, a majority of CD98hc remained on the plasma membrane and with no increased trafficking of CD98hc to Lamp1-positive lysosomes (Figures 6C and 6D). Moreover, neither CD98hc bispecific affinity variant affected total brain CD98hc expression in brain lysates from mice that were dosed with 50 mg/kg of anti-CD98hc/BACE1 between 1 and 7 days (Figures 6E–6I). We also evaluated the CD98hc amino acid transport level in the presence or absence of the anti-CD98hc antibodies. As a positive control, we observed transport inhibition by the system-L-specific substrate BCH (2-amino-2-norbornane-carboxylic acid). No inhibition was observed with anti-CD98hc antibody treatments (Figure 6J). Taken together, these data indicate that CD98hc is a novel high-capacity RMT pathway capable of delivering antibody therapeutics across the BBB without perturbing CD"

NEC coat architecture was determined by combining this information with integrative modeling using small-angle X-ray scattering data. The molecular arrangement of the NEC establishes the basic mechanism for budding and scission of tailored vesicles at the INM. Intracytoplasmic transport between compartments is primarily mediated by vesicles (Schekman and Orci, 1996Schekman R. Orci L. Coat proteins and vesicle budding.Science. 1996; 271: 1526-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). These vesicles are shaped by specific coat proteins that are recruited to the site of assembly and function to deform the membrane (McMahon and Gallop, 2005McMahon H.T. Gallop J.L. Membrane curvature and mechanisms of dynamic cell membrane remodelling.Nature. 2005; 438: 590-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). In contrast, movement into and out of the nucleus is effected by “gated transport” via the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). NPCs allow free diffusion of small molecules and can mediate active transport of cargo up to ∼39 nm in diameter (Panté and Kann, 2002Panté N. Kann M. Nuclear pore complex is able to transport macromolecules with diameters of about 39 nm.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Larger macromolecular assemblies, however, are unable to pass through the NPC. Recently, vesicular trafficking was reported to mediate nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of ribonucleoprotein particles (Speese et al., 2012Speese S.D. Ashley J. Jokhi V. Nunnari J. Barria R. Li Y. Ataman B. Koon A. Chang Y.T. Li Q. et al.Nuclear envelope budding enables large ribonucleoprotein particle export during synaptic Wnt signaling.Cell. 2012; 149: 832-846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). This non-canonical pathway across the nuclear double membrane involves vesicle formation at the INM and fusion at the outer nuclear membrane (ONM). Another suggested role of this pathway is in nuclear recycling, i.e., transport of nuclear protein aggregates like defective NPC assembly intermediates to the cytosolic autophagy machinery for degradation (Rose and Schlieker, 2012Rose A. Schlieker C. Alternative nuclear transport for cellular protein quality control.Trends Cell Biol. 2012; 22: 509-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, Webster et al., 2014Webster B.M.

The ribonucleoprotein particle transport mechanism is in many respects similar to nuclear egress of herpesviruses discovered a decade earlier (Mettenleiter et al., 2013Mettenleiter T.C. Müller F. Granzow H. Klupp B.G. The way out: what we know and do not know about herpesvirus nuclear egress.Cell. Microbiol. 2013; 15: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In the latter, ∼125-nm-diameter icosahedral herpesvirus capsids assemble inside the nucleus and use vesicle-mediated transport across the nuclear envelope to gain access to the cytoplasm for further maturation. The combined evidence from the cellular ribonucleoprotein particle and viral capsid transport systems makes it likely that vesicle transport represents a general mechanism for translocation of large cargo from the nucleus to the cytoplasm that herpesviruses have usurped during evolution. Whereas the overall topology of the process of herpesvirus nuclear egress resembles cellular vesicle trafficking, little is known about the nanostructural details that lead to formation, scission, and fusion of INM-derived vesicles. Studied already in great biological detail, herpesvirus nuclear egress therefore represents a unique tractable model system to delineate the general structural and functional basis of nucleo-cytoplasmic vesicle transport. Studies of herpesvirus nuclear egress showed that, during infection, newly formed intranuclear capsids bud at the INM (Figure 1A) followed by membrane scission, resulting in enveloped capsids located in the perinuclear space. The envelope then fuses with the ONM to deliver the capsids to the cytoplasm. A large body of experimental studies has established that, throughout the Herpesviridae, two viral proteins, designated as pUL31 and pUL34 in the alphaherpesviruses herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and pseudorabies virus (PrV), form the heterodimeric nuclear egress complex (NEC; Figure 1A, green). The NEC is required and sufficient for vesicle formation, i.e., budding and scission, at the INM (Klupp et al., 2007Klupp B.G. Granzow H. Fuchs W. Keil G.M. Finke S. Mettenleiter T.C. Vesicle formation from the nuclear membrane is induced by coexpression of two conserved herpesvirus proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 7241-7246Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, Mettenleiter et al., 2013Mettenleiter T.C. Müller F. Granzow H. Klupp B.G. The way out: what we know and do not know about herpesvirus nuclear egress.Cell. Microbiol. 2013; 15: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The C terminus of the type II membrane protein pUL34 tethers the NEC to the INM, while pUL31 is exposed to the nucleoplasm. pUL31 then associates with the capsid surface in the lumen of the nascent perinuclear vesicle. After vesicle fusion with the ONM and release of the capsid, the NEC is exposed to the cytoplasm (Mettenleiter et al., 2013Mettenleiter T.C. Müller F. Granzow H. Klupp B.G. The way out: what we know and do not know about herpesvirus nuclear egress.Cell. Microbiol. 2013; 15: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). NEC components are also likely to mediate cargo selection (Funk et al., 2015Funk C. Ott M. Raschbichler V. Nagel C.H. Binz A. Sodeik B. Bauerfeind R. Bailer S.M. The herpes simplex virus protein pUL31 escorts nucleocapsids to sites of nuclear egress, a process coordinated by its N-terminal domain.PLoS Pathog. 2015; 11: e1004957Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Additionally, kinases recruited to the NEC are responsible for phosphorylation of lamins for local dissolution of the nuclear lamina to allow access of capsids to the INM (Hatch and Hetzer, 2014Hatch E. Hetzer M. Breaching the nuclear envelope in development and disease.J. Cell Biol. 2014; 205: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, Mettenleiter et al., 2013Mettenleiter T.C. Müller F. Granzow H. Klupp B.G. The way out: what we know and do not know about herpesvirus nuclear egress.Cell. Microbiol. 2013; 15: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and for phosphorylation of NEC components (Mou et al., 2009Mou F. Wills E. Baines J.D. Phosphorylation of the UL31 protein of herpes simplex virus 1 by the US3-encoded kinase regulates localization of the nuclear envelopment complex and egress of nucleocapsids.J.

Human cytomegalovirus UL97 phosphorylates the viral nuclear egress complex.J. Virol. 2015; 89: 523-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Whereas this prototypic budding process at the INM and its components are well characterized, the fusion process with the ONM is still under debate, including a possible role of viral fusogenic glycoproteins (Mettenleiter et al., 2013Mettenleiter T.C. Müller F. Granzow H. Klupp B.G. The way out: what we know and do not know about herpesvirus nuclear egress.Cell. Microbiol. 2013; 15: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Recently, in vitro studies showed that partially truncated NEC components artificially membrane tethered to giant unilamellar vesicles formed a coat that can function as a minimal virus-encoded vesiculation machinery, not requiring additional viral or cellular factors (Bigalke et al., 2014Bigalke J.M. Heuser T. Nicastro D. Heldwein E.E. Membrane deformation and scission by the HSV-1 nuclear egress complex.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Furthermore, artificial membrane tethering of pUL31 alone was sufficient for induction of membrane invaginations and membrane scission in giant unilamellar vesicles (Lorenz et al., 2015Lorenz M. Vollmer B. Unsay J.D. Klupp B.G. García-Sáez A.J. Mettenleiter T.C. Antonin W. A single herpesvirus protein can mediate vesicle formation in the nuclear envelope.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 6962-6974Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, owing in part to the reduced complexity of the models used, these studies did not provide sufficient ultrastructural detail to elucidate the architecture and functionality of the NEC coat. Thus, we here investigated the NEC in its native location, in vesicles at the periphery of the nucleus. The size of the nucleus makes it a challenging target for visualization of intra-nuclear structures at molecular resolution in situ. Nevertheless, by applying an integrated multi-modal approach that enabled near-native imaging over variable scales and resolutions (Zeev-Ben-Mordehai et al., 2014Zeev-Ben-Mordehai T. Hagen C. Grünewald K. A cool hybrid approach to the herpesvirus ‘life’ cycle.Curr. Opin. Virol. 2014; 5: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we were able to characterize in detail both the extent of nuclear membrane remodeling and the architecture of the NEC at the INM. We first show in cryo-sections of herpesvirus-infected cells that the NEC forms a protein coat that lines capsid-containing perinuclear vesicles during egress. We then characterize the ultrastructure of NEC-coated vesicles in non-infected cells that co-express pUL31 and pUL34. Further, that latter experimental system provided a higher frequency of these vesicles, allowing successful cellular electron cryo-tomography of lamellae prepared by advanced focused ion beam cryo-milling (cryoFIB). Subsequent three-dimensional averaging of the NEC coat revealed that it forms an ordered lattice with two different hexameric faces. X-ray scattering data of solubilized NEC complexes, combined with integrated modeling, allowed us to determine that these two faces represent pUL34 anchored in the vesicle membrane and pUL31 forming the inner layer. The unique structure and interactions between the two protein layers result in a defined membrane curvature, ensuring that viral capsids are tightly enveloped. Our data reveal how formation of correctly sized perinuclear vesicles is achieved and establish a mechanistic basis for nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of large cargoes. To analyze the NEC coat formed in situ during viral infection in its most native environment, we used electron cryo-microscopy and tomography (cryoEM/T) (Hoenger, 2014Hoenger A. High-resolution cryo-electron microscopy on macromolecular complexes and cell organelles.Protoplasma. 2014; 251: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). CryoET imaging of areas deeper inside cells typically requires vitreous sections in order to provide electron transparent specimens of <500 nm thickness (Lucić et al., 2005Lucić V. Förster F. Baumeister W. Structural studies by electron tomography: from cells to molecules.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 833-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). In electron cryo-microscopy of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS), a method for imaging hydrated and unstained cellular ultrastructural detail (Dubochet, 2012Dubochet J. Cryo-EM--the first thirty years.J. Microsc. 2012; 245: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), NECs were observed as electron-dense coats at the nucleoplasmic side of the INM and in the perinuclear space of HSV-1-infected Vero cells (Figures 1B–1F and Movies S1 and S2). When nuclear capsids were in close contact to the INM, a planar NEC coat of ∼100 nm diameter, i.e., about the width of the capsid, was observed (Figure 1B′, right HSV-1 capsid). The coat curved and expanded during budding of the INM into the perinuclear space (Figure 1B′, left HSV-1 capsid). Interestingly, the electron-dense NEC coat did not extend beyond the individual sites of budding (Figures 1C and 1D and Movie S1). Ultimately, the NEC formed a tightly fitting complete coat around the capsid (Figures 1D–1F and Movies S1 and S2). In HSV-1-infected Vero cells, not only DNA-filled C-capsids underwent primary envelopment (Figures 1B, 1D, and 1F), but also empty A-capsids (Figure 1C) and scaffold-containing immature B-capsids (Figure 1E, right vesicle). Intraluminal vesicles (ILVs, defined as possessing the NEC coat but lacking capsids; Figure 1E, asterisk; Movie S2) represented 34% of all observed perinuclear vesicles in HSV-1-infected Vero cells (14 of 41 vesicles, from 21 tomograms total), with a mean inner diameter of 115 nm ± 11 nm SD (n = 12). During de-envelopment, the NEC coat was left behind at the cytoplasmic face of the outer nuclear membrane (Figure 1F, arrow), and cytoplasmic capsids, now devoid of the NEC coat, subsequently underwent virion assembly (Figure 1F, right, and Movie S2, right upper-corner). This result contradicts previous conclusions drawn on the basis of interpreting densities in heavy-metal-stained, freeze-substituted, plastic-embedded samples (Wild et al., 2015Wild P. Leisinger S. de Oliveira A.P. Schraner E.M. Kaech A. Ackermann M. Tobler K. Herpes simplex virus 1 Us3 deletion mutant is infective despite impaired capsid translocation to the cytoplasm.Viruses. 2015; 7: 52-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and is in line with the absence of pUL31 and pUL34 in extracellular HSV-1 virions (Loret et al., 2008Loret S. Guay G. Lippé R. Comprehensive characterization of extracellular herpes simplex virus type 1 virions.J. Virol. 2008; 82: 8605-8618Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). A grainy nature of the NEC coat was readily visible in computational slices through cryoET reconstructions (Figures 1C–1E and Movies S1 and S2), suggesting a modular lattice-type architecture consisting of repetitive units. To analyze the structure and function of this coat in greater detail, a multimodal imaging approach was needed, spanning several length scales and covering from the nuclear distribution of its fully assembled form down to interactions of its single constituents. In HSV-1-infected cells, the number of capsid envelopment events captured at the INM was low. Therefore, we used a previously described porcine cell line that stably co-expresses pUL31 and pUL34 of PrV as a model frequently showing NEC-mediated vesicle formation (Klupp et al., 2007Klupp B.G. Granzow H. Fuchs W. Keil G.M. Finke S. Mettenleiter T.C. Vesicle formation from the nuclear membrane is induced by coexpression of two conserved herpesvirus proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 7241-7246Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In this BK cell line, pUL34 is anchored to the INM by its authentic C-terminal transmembrane region, with the C-terminal GFP tag exposed on the vesicle outside, i.e., on the opposite membrane side of the NEC. Tagging allowed visualization of the NEC in vivo. By using three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) (Schermelleh et al., 2010Schermelleh L. Heintzmann R. Leonhardt H. A guide to super-resolution fluorescence microscopy.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 190: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar), volumetric live-cell imaging of the nucleus at sub-diffraction resolution was achieved. This revealed clusters of fluorescent speckles of ∼160–1,500 nm diameter at multiple sites around the nuclear periphery, as well as within the nuclear interior along membranous invaginations (Figures 2A and Movie S3). These clusters represent accumulations of NEC-containing vesicles in the perinuclear space (Klupp et al., 2007Klupp B.G. Granzow H. Fuchs W. Keil G.M. Finke S. Mettenleiter T.C. Vesicle formation from the nuclear membrane is induced by coexpression of two conserved herpesvirus proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Imaging of similar regions of BK cells at higher resolution by soft X-ray cryo-microscopy/tomography, guided by correlation with GFP fluorescence (Hagen et al., 2012Hagen C. Guttmann P. Klupp B. Werner S. Rehbein S. Mettenleiter T.C. Schneider G. Grünewald K. Correlative VIS-fluorescence and soft X-ray cryo-microscopy/tomography of adherent cells.J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 177: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), provided detailed information about the spatial distribution of the NEC-containing target structures/vesicle clusters throughout the nucleus (Figure S1 and Movies S4 and S5). The ultrastructure of these intranuclear vesicle clusters was next characterized in 3D by CEMOVIS (Figure 2B), resulting in visualization of vesicles with a grainy inner NEC coat and a mean inner diameter of 107 ± 33 nm SD (n = 79). These vesicles were closely similar in size and structure to the capsid-less ILVs in infected cells (Figure 1E, asterisk). Characterization of larger volumes by serial CEMOVIS sections enabled us to localize and characterize the occurrence of repetitive NEC structures/lattices suited for sub-tomogram averaging, even in rare developmental states (Figure 1). An alternative cryo-thinning technique, cryoFIB, has recently been developed to produce 100–300 nm thick lamellae from vitreous samples. This approach does not rely on physical cutting and, thereby, avoids sectioning artifacts (Marko et al., 2007Marko M. Hsieh C. Schalek R. Frank J. Mannella C. Focused-ion-beam thinning of frozen-hydrated biological specimens for cryo-electron microscopy.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 215-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, Rigort et al., 2012Rigort A. Bäuerlein F.J.B. Villa E. Eibauer M. Laugks T. Baumeister W. Plitzko J.M. Focused ion beam micromachining of eukaryotic cells for cryoelectron tomography.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 4449-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). CryoET data were recorded from cryoFIB-prepared lamellae of plunge-frozen BK cells. Perinuclear vesicles were typically spherical, although some exhibited a more irregular shape (Figures 3A–3C and Movie S6), possibly due to crowding. The NEC protein layer was evident as a clear lattice-like, ∼10-nm-thick coat lining the entire inside of each vesicle with periodic connections to the vesicle membrane (Figures 3A and 3B). Size measurements of vesicles from three tomograms showed a peaked distribution with a mean inner diameter of 103 ± 10 nm SD (n = 31) (Figure 3D). The thickness of the coat and the size of ILVs in BK cells measured in 3D from CEMOVIS and cryoFIB-based data were in agreement (Figures 2B and 3 and Movie S6) and were similar to CEMOVIS data from HSV-1-infected Vero cells (Figure 1E). The vesicle diameters did not show a Gaussian distribution. Instead, the distribution is heavily skewed and peaked with very light tails (Figure 3D). These properties suggest that a specific mechanism inherent to NEC coat assembly is a predominant determinant of vesicle size, with positive skewness indicating a lower limit of the measured parameter. The previous observations suggested a highly repetitive organization of the NEC protein layer. Taking different curvature into account, the structure of the NEC coat was therefore determined independently for each vesicle by sub-tomogram averaging from the cryoFIB/ET data (Figure 4). Each vesicle average revealed a curved hexagonal lattice composed of two tightly interconnected layers of distinct appearance (Figures 4A, 4B, and S2 and Movies S7 and S8 [resolution 3.5–4 nm]). We termed the two NEC layers the membrane-proximal (MP) and membrane-distal (MD) layers. The MD layer is a ∼3-nm-thick hexagonal lattice with a spacing between repeating unit centers of ∼11.5 nm (purple), and the MP layer is ∼7 nm thick (magenta) (Figure 4C and Movie S9). In cross-sections, the repeating unit of the NEC coat (a single hexagon) shared a characteristic “archway” motif—similar to an inverted ‘U’ (Figure 4A and Movie S7). The hexagonal unit could be further decomposed into a motif of angular appearance, one side of the archway, which appeared kinked at approximately two-thirds along its length. Thus, the MP layer consists of a conical arrangement of six independent densities that originate at the unit cell “keystone” extending toward the vesicle center to form an “arch” and connecting with the MD layer near the 2-fold axes. Densities connecting the arch/keystone of the unit cell to the vesicle membrane were already apparent in raw tomograms (Figure 3 and Movie S6) and became accentuated after sub-tomogram averaging (Figure 4A and Movie S7).Figure S2Resolution Assessment of the NEC Coat Map, Related to Figure 4Show full captionFourier shell correlation calculated between two half-datasets of 150 particles each.

The resolution of the map is estimated to be between 35 and 40 Å. At a nominal defocus of −6 μm the first node of the CTF is expected at 1/34 Å-1. We assigned the MP layer to the membrane-anchored pUL34 and the MD layer to pUL31 (Figure 4C and Movie S9). The schematic interpretation shown in Figure 5 is based on analysis of tangential slices revealing the characteristic arrangements of protein density in each layer (Figure 4B and Movie S8). Orthogonal cross-section slices, shown adjacent to the model (Figure 5), reveal that the local curvature of the MD layer (pUL31) is not isotropic. Between 3-fold axes (“3-2-3”) the MD layer is distinctly planar, whereas between 6-fold axes (“6-2-6”), the curvature of MD is consistent with that of the vesicle membrane. The cryoFIB/ET sub-tomogram averages do not readily reveal the stoichiometry of pUL31/34 heterodimers in the NEC coat. The schematic interpretation shown in Figure 5 suggests that the unit cell is composed of a hexamer of heterodimers ([pUL31/34]6). To independently validate the model, we characterized a soluble form of the PrV pUL31/34 heterodimer (Figure S3) by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) (Figure 6). We determined the shape of the soluble heterodimer by ab initio modeling from the 1D SAXS scattering curve (Figures 6A and 6B) (Franke and Svergun, 2009Franke D. Svergun D.I. DAMMIF, a program for rapid ab-initio shape determination in small-angle scattering.J. Appl. Cryst. 2009; 42: 342-346Crossref Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). The angular shape (87 nm3 in volume, radius of gyration of 2.96 nm, and maximum dimension of 10.2 nm) was similar to that observed in the cryoEM sub-tomogram average as one side of the archway. To orient the soluble heterodimers within the cryoEM map, we carried out a fitting search using the SAXS model and sampled the full rotational range. By locally fitting multiple copies of the highest-scoring model into the cryoEM map, we were able to account for the cryoEM density as well as to reproduce its characteristic features (Figures 6C–6I and Movie S10). Together, this integrated modeling suggests that the NEC coat is composed of a ∼10-nm-thick layer of interacting hexameric cores of NEC heterodimers in lateral self-association.Figure 6Stoichiometry of the pUL31/34 Heterodimer within the NEC Coat, Based on SAXS DataShow full caption(A–F) (A) SAXS scattering curve for soluble PrV NEC (red circles; Figure S3) with the fit of the theoretical scattering curve calculated from the ab initio model (green line) and the respective size distribution (inset).

Using 3D, time-lapse intravital imaging for direct visualization of the muscle regeneration process in live mice, we report that extracellular matrix remnants from injured skeletal muscle fibers, ""ghost fibers,"" govern muscle stem/progenitor cell behaviors during proportional regeneration. Stem cells were immobile and quiescent without injury whereas their activated progenitors migrated and divided after injury. Unexpectedly, divisions and migration were primarily bi-directionally oriented along the ghost fiber longitudinal axis, allowing for spreading of progenitors throughout ghost fibers. Re-orienting ghost fibers impacted myogenic progenitors' migratory paths and division planes, causing disorganization of regenerated muscle fibers. We conclude that ghost fibers are autonomous, architectural units necessary for proportional regeneration after tissue injury. This finding reinforces the need to fabricate bioengineered matrices that mimic living tissue matrices for tissue regeneration therapy."

Neural circuits typically comprise many different neurons linked in precise ways by synaptic connections. How neurites discriminate between one another during circuit assembly remains a central issue in neuroscience. Through regeneration studies in vertebrates, Langley, 1895Langley J.N.

Chemoaffinity in the orderly growth of nerve fiber patterns and connections.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1963; 50: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar proposed that molecular differences between neurons determine the specificity of synaptic connections. In its simplest formulation, Sperry’s chemoaffinity hypothesis (Sperry, 1963Sperry R.W. Chemoaffinity in the orderly growth of nerve fiber patterns and connections.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1963; 50: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar) suggested that a lock and key mechanism mediates recognition between synaptic partners. Over the past 30 years, biochemical and genetic approaches have led to the identification of the cell recognition molecules and the intercellular signaling pathways regulating the patterning of axons and dendrites. From these studies, three general molecular strategies underlying circuit assembly have emerged. First, combinatorial use of a limited set of conserved cell surface and secreted molecules regulates axon guidance in many different regions of the developing invertebrate and vertebrate nervous systems. These include netrins, slits, semaphorins, and various cell adhesion molecules, such as cadherins and immunoglobulin superfamily proteins (O’Donnell et al., 2009O’Donnell M. Chance R.K. Bashaw G.J. Axon growth and guidance: receptor regulation and signal transduction.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 32: 383-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Second, gradients of cell surface proteins, notably Ephs and Ephrins as well as Wnts, play a crucial role in the establishment of topographic maps (Cang and Feldheim, 2013Cang J. Feldheim D.A. Developmental mechanisms of topographic map formation and alignment.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 36: 51-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, Schmitt et al., 2006Schmitt A.M. Shi J. Wolf A.M.

Developmental mechanisms of topographic map formation and alignment.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 36: 51-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Third, molecular diversity contributed by large families of related proteins with different recognition specificities impart unique identities to neurons and mediate self-avoidance (repulsion between neurites of the same cell) (Zipursky and Grueber, 2013Zipursky S.L. Grueber W.B. The molecular basis of self-avoidance.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 36: 547-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, Lefebvre et al., 2012Lefebvre J.L. Kostadinov D. Chen W.V. Maniatis T. Sanes J.R. Protocadherins mediate dendritic self-avoidance in the mammalian nervous system.Nature. 2012; 488: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). These include Dscam1 proteins in Drosophila (Schmucker et al., 2000Schmucker D. Clemens J.C. Shu H. Worby C.A. Xiao J. Muda M. Dixon J.E. Zipursky S.L. Drosophila Dscam is an axon guidance receptor exhibiting extraordinary molecular diversity.Cell. 2000; 101: 671-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar) and clustered protocadherins in vertebrates (Kohmura et al., 1998Kohmura N.

Maniatis T. A striking organization of a large family of human neural cadherin-like cell adhesion genes.Cell. 1999; 97: 779-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The molecular diversity of both Dscam1 and protocadherins coupled with their exquisite isoform-specific homophilic binding specificities raised the possibility that they could directly specify patterns of synaptic specificity through a lock and key mechanism. As Dscam1 is largely, if not exclusively, expressed in a probabilistic manner (Miura et al., 2013Miura S.K. Martins A. Zhang K.X. Graveley B.R. Zipursky S.L. Probabilistic splicing of Dscam1 establishes identity at the level of single neurons.Cell. 2013; 155: 1166-1177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and protocadherins also appear to be expressed in this way, it is unlikely that these protein families mediate synaptic matching. Important progress has been made in identifying cell surface molecules regulating synaptic specificity, including Syg1 and Syg2 in the worm (Shen and Bargmann, 2003Shen K. Bargmann C.I.

Neurosci. 2012; 32: 14402-14414Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) raised the possibility that related Ig superfamily proteins regulate layer-specific patterns of synaptic connections between different neurons in the chick retina (see Discussion). As a step toward identifying a common molecular logic underlying synaptic specificity, we sought to identify families of cell surface proteins expressed in a cell-type-enriched fashion in closely related neurons with different patterns of synaptic specificity. Here, we set out to do this using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and molecular genetic approaches in Drosophila. The Drosophila visual system is well suited to uncovering the molecular recognition mechanisms regulating synaptic specificity.

In this paper, we focus on the medulla region of the fly visual system. It comprises columns and layers (Figures 1A–1C ). In a broad sense, columns process information from different points in space and layers process different types of visual information (e.g., ON versus OFF responses). The cell bodies of medulla neurons lie outside the neuropil and synaptic specificity is elaborated within a dense meshwork of axonal and dendritic processes. There are over 100 different types of neurons forming synapses in the medulla. These neurons fall into a few general categories based primarily on their morphology and location of their arbors (Fischbach and Dittrich, 1989Fischbach K.-F. Dittrich A.P.M.

In a landmark study, the synaptic connectivity between neurons in the medulla was determined using serial section electron microscopic reconstruction (Takemura et al., 2013Takemura S.Y. Bharioke A.

The shaded electron micrographic sections through the adult column shown in Figures 1D and 1E are included to emphasize the complexity of the neuropil in one medulla column comprising the processes of on the order of 100 different neuronal cell types (A. Nern, personal communication) (Figures 1D and 1E). These patterns of synaptic connections are complex, specific, and reproducible (Takemura et al., 2015Takemura S. Xu C. Lu Z. Rivlin P. Parag T.

USA. 2015; 44: 13711-13716Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In addition, these studies revealed that within a layer, neurons form synapses with multiple neuronal types (Takemura et al., 2013Takemura S.Y. Bharioke A. Lu Z. Nern A. Vitaladevuni S. Rivlin P.K.

Although some progress has been made in identifying genes regulating layer-specific targeting (Hadjieconomou et al., 2011Hadjieconomou D. Timofeev K. Salecker I. A step-by-step guide to visual circuit assembly in Drosophila.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2011; 21: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), genes controlling synaptic specificity within layers have not been identified. In the work described here, we set out to identify proteins regulating synaptic specificity using RNA-seq to determine the transcriptome of developing R7 and R8 photoreceptor neurons and five lamina monopolar neurons, L1–L5 (Figures 1A and 1B). The axon of each type of neuron elaborates a unique morphology, including layer-specific branches, and forms characteristic patterns of synaptic connections (Fischbach and Dittrich, 1989Fischbach K.-F.

In most cases, synapses formed by each neuron type occur in the layer in which the axon terminates or in which interstitial branches arborize. We show that each cell type expresses mRNAs from hundreds of genes encoding cell surface proteins and unique combinations of them. Using a protein interaction database (Özkan et al., 2013Özkan E.

These families are promising candidates for regulating synaptic specificity within the developing Drosophila CNS. As a first step toward identifying cell surface and secreted molecules as candidates involved in cellular recognition events regulating synaptic specificity through RNA-seq, we developed methods to purify seven neuronal cell types (R7, R8, and L1–L5 neurons) with different layer and synaptic specificities. These neurons were isolated at 40% after puparium formation (APF), just prior to (i.e., R7 and R8) or during early stages of synapse formation (i.e., L1–L5) (Chen et al., 2014Chen Y. Akin O. Nern A. Tsui C.Y.K. Pecot M.Y. Zipursky S.L. Cell-type-specific labeling of synapses in vivo through synaptic tagging with recombination.Neuron. 2014; 81: 280-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar; M.Y.P. and S.L.Z., unpublished data). To purify each cell type at this stage in development, we used a dual labeling approach. We generated transgenes expressing tandem tomato in all cells in the retina or in all cells in the lamina and combined these with a separate GFP marker expressed selectively in a specific cell type (e.g., R8 in the retina or L3 in the lamina) (Figures 1F–1I). Each cell type was isolated in a highly purified form as assessed using qPCR for several diagnostic markers (data not shown) and post hoc analysis of RNA-seq data (Figure 2C). To obtain the transcriptomes of purified cell populations, we isolated total RNA, linearly amplified polyA-mRNA using T7 polymerase, and generated cDNA libraries that were analyzed in a single lane by 50 bp paired-end sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. At least two independent biological replicate libraries were sequenced for each cell type. We obtained between 221 and 441 million reads from each library, with a percentage of uniquely mapped reads ranging between 33% and 74%. Of these, 19% to 32% were intergenic and 60% to 75% mapped to exons. A small fraction of reads mapped to intronic regions (Table S1). The correlation in the distribution of normalized raw reads between biological replicates for each cell type was high (Figure 2A) and ranged from 0.97 to 1 for the L4 and R7 libraries, respectively. The correlation coefficients between libraries of different cell types ranged from 0.87 for R7 versus L4, to 0.97 for R7 versus R8. Pairs of neurons from either the retina or the lamina were more closely related to each other than any given retinal to lamina neuron pair. The L1 and L2 pair, both required for the optomotor response (Borst, 2014Borst A. Fly visual course control: behaviour, algorithms and circuits.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 15: 590-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), are more closely related than other pairs of lamina neurons. These data are consistent with principle component analysis in which R7/R8 are distinct from L1–L5 and that the L1 and L2 pair, as well as L4 and L5 pair, are more closely related to each other than to L3 neurons (Figure 2B). To assess whether differences revealed through RNA-seq reliably reflect differences in expression between cell types, we compared the reads per kilobase of a specific mRNA per million reads (RPKM) values for seven transcripts expressed specifically in each of the seven neuronal cell types as determined by immunohistology. There was an excellent correlation between antibody staining and RPKM values (Figure 2C). Thus, RNA-seq provides a reliable method to identify transcripts differentially expressed between these neurons. We set out to gain a global perspective on gene expression differences between R7, R8, and L1–L5 using two different approaches. First, we performed pairwise comparisons of their transcriptomes and identified differentially expressed genes between different cell types. As we obtained independent verification of cell-type-enriched expression for transcripts with a maximum RPKM slightly below five using protein traps (Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al., 2015Nagarkar-Jaiswal S. Lee P.-T. Campbell M.E. Chen K. Anguiano-Zarate S. Gutierrez M.C. Busby T. Lin W.-W. He Y.

MiMIC: a highly versatile transposon insertion resource for engineering Drosophila melanogaster genes.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) (see later in the text), we set conservative criteria for genes differentially expressed (DE) between cell-types. We selected genes exhibiting a difference of greater than five times between one neuronal cell type and other neurons with expression in at least one cell type exhibiting an RPKM >5 with an adjusted p value of <0.05 (Table S2A). Even with these criteria, the number of DE genes between two cell types was substantial, ranging from 217 to 1,159. In summary, marked differences in gene expression between different neurons were observed at this stage in development. In a second approach, we explored the relationship between patterns of gene expression and specific cell types using a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) (Langfelder and Horvath, 2008Langfelder P. Horvath S. WGCNA: an R package for weighted correlation network analysis.BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9: 559Crossref PubMed Scopus (10446) Google Scholar). This unsupervised and unbiased analysis identified distinct co-expression modules by clustering transcripts with similar expression patterns across all samples (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Cell-type-specific modules were preferentially enriched in cell surface membrane and secreted molecules (CSMs) (Figure S1; Table S3). This is consistent with an important role for intercellular interactions as important determinants of patterns of synaptic connectivity. We next sought to identify genes encoding CSMs that are expressed in a cell-type-enriched fashion, as these are candidates for regulating the cellular interactions underlying synaptic specificity. With a threshold of an RPKM greater than five and an adjusted p value <0.05, we observed that each cell type expresses between a quarter to a third (i.e., between 247 [for R7] and 322 [for L3]) of the 976 genes encoding CSMs predicted to be encoded in the fly genome (Figure S2) (Kurusu et al., 2008Kurusu M.

To gain an appreciation of the differences in genes encoding CSMs expressed between cell types, we carried out a pairwise comparison of RPKM values for each pair of cell types. Here, we observed marked differences in expression, as each pair differentially expressed between 49 (between R7 and R8) and 168 (between R7 and L4) CSM genes (RPKM greater than five in at least one cell type and greater than five times difference between the two cell types) (Table S2B). Further analyses revealed that only a small fraction of the CSM transcripts are selectively enriched in only one cell type of the seven profiled. Thus, each cell type expresses many genes encoding CSMs, the majority of which are expressed in multiple cell types, and there are marked differences in expression between cell types.Figure 3Gene Expression Patterns of CSMs in Each Cell TypeShow full caption(A) Heat map showing expression of all genes encoding CSMs expressed in at least one cell with an RPKM > 5 (n = 444).

Neurons in the Drosophila brain make genetically specified synaptic connections within a dense neuropil in which neuronal processes come into contact with many possible targets, implying that, as proposed by Sperry, 1963Sperry R.W. Chemoaffinity in the orderly growth of nerve fiber patterns and connections.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1963; 50: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar, target neurons “must carry some kind of individual identification tags.” His statement that “the growing fibers are extremely particular when it comes to establishing synaptic connections, each fiber linking only with certain neurons to which it becomes selectively attached by specific chemical affinities” (Sperry, 1963Sperry R.W. Chemoaffinity in the orderly growth of nerve fiber patterns and connections.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1963; 50: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar) applies well to compact hard-wired networks such as the fly brain. The “labeled pathways hypothesis” proposed that each insect CNS neuron expresses specific cell surface proteins (CSPs), called “surface labels,” that function as identification tags or “Sperry molecules.” Each of these proteins would be expressed on a small subset of neuronal growth cones, while its binding partner would mark the surfaces of neurons with which these growth cones interact. This binding partner might itself be a surface label for a different subset of neurons. It was also speculated that some surface labels might be found to be members of gene families (Goodman et al., 1984Goodman C.S. Bastiani M.J. Doe C.Q. du Lac S. Helfand S.L. Kuwada J.Y. Thomas J.B. Cell recognition during neuronal development.Science. 1984; 225: 1271-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). While the labeled pathways hypothesis was developed primarily to explain axon guidance, these concepts can also be applied to synaptic specificity. The Drosophila genome encodes ∼1,000 CSPs, representing more than 80 domain types, that are likely to participate in cell-cell recognition events (Kurusu et al., 2008Kurusu M. Cording A. Taniguchi M. Menon K. Suzuki E. Zinn K. A screen of cell-surface molecules identifies leucine-rich repeat proteins as key mediators of synaptic target selection.Neuron. 2008; 59: 972-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), but there was no obvious way to identify potential surface labels among these. Unexpected insights emerged from an in vitro extracellular “interactome” (ECIA) screen of all Drosophila CSPs containing immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, in which all possible pairwise combinations were tested for binding. The most striking finding from these studies was that a subfamily of 2-Ig domain CSPs, the defective proboscis extension response proteins (Dprs) (Nakamura et al., 2002Nakamura M. Baldwin D. Hannaford S. Palka J. Montell C. Defective proboscis extension response (DPR), a member of the Ig superfamily required for the gustatory response to salt.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3463-3472PubMed Google Scholar), selectively interacts with a 3-Ig domain CSP subfamily, which we denoted as DIPs (Dpr-interacting proteins). Dprs and DIPs form a complex interaction network, the “Dpr-ome,” in which most Dprs bind to multiple DIPs and vice versa (Özkan et al., 2013Özkan E. Carrillo R.A. Eastman C.L. Weiszmann R. Waghray D. Johnson K.G. Zinn K. Celniker S.E. Garcia K.C. An extracellular interactome of immunoglobulin and LRR proteins reveals receptor-ligand networks.Cell. 2013; 154: 228-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). As documented in this paper, the complete Dpr-ome contains 21 Dprs and nine DIPs. dpr1 is the only one of these 30 genes that has been previously characterized. dpr1 mutants have reduced aversion to salt and exhibit courtship defects, and a dpr1 reporter is expressed in subsets of brain neurons (Goldman and Arbeitman, 2007Goldman T.D.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3463-3472PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we describe the crystal structure of a Dpr-DIP complex and show that six dpr and DIP genes are expressed by subsets of larval and pupal CNS neurons. Interactions between Dpr11 and its partner DIP-γ regulate larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) development. In the pupal visual system, Dpr11 and DIP-γ are required for normal formation of synapses between photoreceptors and amacrine neurons. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that Dprs and DIPs are neuronal surface labels involved in the establishment of synaptic specificity during development. We discovered the Dpr-ome using the ECIA, a high-throughput, avidity-driven assay for interactions between extracellular proteins (Özkan et al., 2013Özkan E. Carrillo R.A. Eastman C.L. Weiszmann R. Waghray D. Johnson K.G. Zinn K. Celniker S.E. Garcia K.C. An extracellular interactome of immunoglobulin and LRR proteins reveals receptor-ligand networks.Cell. 2013; 154: 228-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The published Dpr-ome contained several proteins (“orphans”) with no binding partners. Since Dprs 4, 15, and 18 had expressed poorly, we created chimeras for those Dprs in which their first (D1) Ig domains were inserted in place of the D1 of Dpr6, a strong expressor. We also included a new Dpr we identified, Dpr21. We expressed the XCDs of all Dprs, Dpr chimeras, and DIPs as secreted Fc and pentamerized alkaline phosphatase (AP5) fusion proteins and used them in an ECIA to create a more complete Dpr-ome (Figures 1A, S1C, and S1D).Figure S1ECIA Analysis of Dpr-DIP Interactions, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Domain truncations of Dpr6 and DIP-α are arrayed against each other using the ECIA, demonstrating that the first domains of Dprs and DIPs are sufficient for binding to each other.(B) The naming scheme for DIPs.(C and D) Raw results (Absorbance at 650 nm) of the ECIA for all Dprs and DIPs, including new constructs (in boldface) designed to improve expression levels.

CG31814 and CG40378 are in the DIP subfamily but also had no bidirectional interactions, so we have removed them from the network. The revised Dpr-ome defines DIP binding partners for all Dprs except Dpr18. Interestingly, Dpr18 has nonconservative substitutions at three completely conserved sites within the D1 interface region (Figure S2A), suggesting that it may not be able to bind DIPs. However, dpr18 is unlikely to be a pseudogene, because these changes are found in Dpr18 orthologs in other dipteran genomes. The Dpr-ome now contains 21 Dprs and nine DIPs. Each Dpr interacts with one to four DIPs, and each DIP with one to seven Dprs. The “common DIP” (cDIP), a secreted LRR protein of unknown function, binds to 14 Dprs and seven DIPs (Figures 1A, S1C, and S1D). Dprs and DIPs interact in a defined pattern, creating a code that may impart specificity to interactions between cells expressing these proteins. To understand this code, it is necessary to define the molecular details of the interactions between Dprs and DIPs. The D1s of Dpr6 and DIP-α can form a complex (Figure S1A). We determined the crystal structure of Dpr6-D1 bound to DIP-α-D1D2, using the multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction method (Figures 1B and 1C; Table S1). The D1s interact with each other using the CC′C″FG faces of the immunoglobulin fold. The complex is pseudo-symmetric, i.e., the two Ig-type D1s are related to each other via a 2-fold symmetry axis. This nearly orthogonal D1-D1 heterodimer topology bears a striking resemblance to several other Ig-type D1-D1 complexes. These include the SYG-1-SYG-2 complex, which initiates formation of synapses, the JAML-CAR complex, a signaling complex of the immune system, and Nectin complexes (Figures 1D and 1E) (Dong et al., 2006Dong X.

The molecular interaction of CAR and JAML recruits the central cell signal transducer PI3K.Science. 2010; 329: 1210-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The appearance of this interaction geometry in multiple adhesive IgSF protein complexes suggests that it may represent an evolutionarily optimized binding solution for formation of cell-cell synapses. Residues at the center of symmetry for both the JAML-CAR and SYG-1-SYG-2 complexes have polar side chains and can make hydrogen bonds or salt bridges (Figure 1D). By contrast, the core of the Dpr6-DIP-α interaction interface is strongly hydrophobic in nature, with van der Waals contacts dominating the interface and a buried surface area of 1,900 Å2 (Figures 2A, 2C, 2D , S2C, and S2D). It does not contain any salt bridges. There are 15 hydrogen bonds at the interface, but only three do not involve main chain atoms. Therefore, charge complementarity and polar interactions are not the basis of binding specificity among Dprs and DIPs. Rather, shape complementarity is more likely to explain Dpr-DIP specificity. The Sc parameter (Lawrence and Colman, 1993Lawrence M.C. Colman P.M. Shape complementarity at protein/protein interfaces.J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 946-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar) is 0.75, indicating highly complementary surfaces. We confirmed the crystallographically observed Dpr-DIP interface by mutating interface residues and measuring affinity using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). All mutations of the interface diminished or abolished binding, except for Dpr6 H114A. This mutation increased affinity by 10-fold, a result of much slower dissociation kinetics (Figures 2B and S2E). Our Dpr6-DIP-α structure serves as a template for all Dpr-DIP complexes, because Dpr and DIP D1 domains are well conserved. The average sequence identities among Dpr D1s and DIP D1s are 45% and 53%, respectively (Figure S2A). Furthermore, the chemical nature of the Dpr and DIP surfaces involved in the interaction is preserved in all Dprs and DIPs, but the residues are conservatively variable to accommodate the variety of Dpr/DIP complexes that need to be formed. The Dpr6 interface residue with the highest impact on binding affinity, Dpr6 Y123 (Figure 2B), is restricted to the closely related set of amino acids of Y, F, and H. Similarly, the DIP-α residue most critical for binding, Q125, is invariant. The two contacting residues at the 2-fold center of the interface, Dpr6 I115 and DIP-α I83 (Figures 1D and 2A), are limited to I, L, or V among all Dprs and DIPs. We confirmed that these interface contacts are conserved in the Dpr11-DIP-γ pair by mutating Dpr11 residues I159 and F167 (corresponding to Dpr6 I115 and Y123), and DIP-γ residue V88 (corresponding to DIP-α I83). As observed for the Dpr6-DIP-α pair, changing any of these residues to Alanine weakened or abolished binding (Figures 2B and S2F). Finally, specific hydrophobic interface residues correlate with binding of Dprs to particular DIPs. For example, F123 and I124 are unique to the four Dprs (11, 15, 16, 17) that bind to DIP-γ (Figures 1A and S2A). To a lesser degree, the use of hydrophobic residues to modulate shape complementarity has been seen in other cross-reactive receptor-ligand systems, such as the interactions of cytokines with their shared receptors gp130 and γc (Wang et al., 2009Wang X.

To evaluate the expression and phenotypes of Dprs and DIPs, we utilized Minos-mediated integration cassette (MiMIC) insertions (Venken et al., 2011Venken K.J. Schulze K.L. Haelterman N.A. Pan H. He Y. Evans-Holm M. Carlson J.W. Levis R.W. Spradling A.C. Hoskins R.A. Bellen H.J. MiMIC: a highly versatile transposon insertion resource for engineering Drosophila melanogaster genes.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). MiMICs contain a gene-trap cassette, which consists of a strong splice acceptor (SA), followed by STOP codons, an EGFP coding sequence with its own ATG, and a polyA sequence. Hence, 5′ UTR insertions, and some coding intron insertions, function as EGFP reporters that are expressed in the pattern of the gene’s mRNA (Figures S3A and S3B). Insertions in 5′ UTR and constitutive coding introns are highly mutagenic when the SA is in the (+) orientation, generating lethal phenotypes for >90% of essential genes (Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al., 2015Nagarkar-Jaiswal S. Lee P.T. Campbell M.E. Chen K. Anguiano-Zarate S. Gutierrez M.C. Busby T. Lin W.W. He Y.

Coding intron insertions also permit the integration of an artificial exon encoding EGFP (SA-EGFP-splice donor [SD]) into coding sequence. Most such tagged proteins (denoted as X-EGFP-X) display the proper expression pattern and subcellular localization (Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al., 2015Nagarkar-Jaiswal S. Lee P.T. Campbell M.E. Chen K. Anguiano-Zarate S. Gutierrez M.C. Busby T. Lin W.W. He Y.

MiMIC: a highly versatile transposon insertion resource for engineering Drosophila melanogaster genes.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). We tagged endogenous Dprs and DIPs by inserting EGFP in frame into coding sequence. We also converted MiMICs into transcriptional activators (drivers), which express reporters in the pattern of the gene into which they are inserted. Converting a (−) intron MiMIC to a driver in the (+) orientation generates a new loss-of-function (LOF) mutation. The application of MiMIC technology to Dprs and DIPs reveals its remarkable utility in allowing the rapid exploration of gene families. MiMICs exist for 25 of the 30 dpr and DIP genes. We have already tagged 16 of the proteins with EGFP (see http://flypush.imgen.bcm.tmc.edu/pscreen/rmce/) and also generated GAL4 and QF drivers. Figures 3 and S3 show expression in the 3rd instar larval ventral nerve cord (VNC) of MiMIC reporters for dpr11 and its partners DIP-γ and DIP-β, and for DIP-α and its partners dpr6 and dpr10 (see Figure 1A). These are visualized together with motor neuron or cholinergic interneuron driver/reporters. There is partial overlap between the pattern of cell bodies expressing each gene and the labeled motor neurons and interneurons, but the coexpressing neurons are different in each case (Figure 3). Each MiMIC reporter labels a very different pattern of axon tracts and dendrites (Figures S3C–S3H). We also show expression of the dpr11MiMIC MI02231 5′>EGFP reporter (henceforth denoted as dpr11MiMIC) together with nuclear dsRed driven by GAL4s for its two binding partners: DIP-γMiMIC MI03222→GAL4 (henceforth denoted as DIP-γ-GAL4) (Figure 3E) and DIP-βMiMIC MI01971→GAL4 (Figure S3E). In both cases, there are neurons that express both dpr11 and the partner gene, but the patterns of coexpressing neurons are different. In summary, these data show that each of the six genes is expressed by a distinct subset of larval motor neurons and interneurons. dpr11MiMIC and DIP-γMiMIC MI03222 5′>EGFP (henceforth denoted as DIP-γMiMIC) GFP reporters are both expressed by motor neurons, but reporter levels vary between cells (Figure 3). Reporters driven by DIP-γ-GAL4 and by a GAL4 driver derived from dpr11 control sequences (dpr11GMR95G12) label NMJ presynaptic terminals, including the muscle 4 NMJ (Figures 4A and 4C ), as does Dpr11-EGFP-Dpr11, a reporter for endogenous Dpr11 protein localization. Dpr11-EGFP-Dpr11 also exhibits postsynaptic staining surrounding muscle 4 NMJ boutons (Figure 4B), indicating that Dpr11 protein is expressed by muscles. Muscle GFP puncta are observed in DIP-γ-GAL4 > GFP animals (Figure 4C), and rescue experiments (see below) suggest that DIP-γ is also likely to be expressed at low levels in muscles. To evaluate the functions of Dpr11 and DIP-γ in NMJ development, we examined 3rd instar larvae bearing mutations in these genes. We used insertions in 5′ UTR introns that would be expected to eliminate or reduce protein expression. For dpr11, these were dpr11MiMIC and a pBac(SAstopDsRed) mutation (Schuldiner et al., 2008Schuldiner O. Berdnik D. Levy J.M. Wu J.S. Luginbuhl D. Gontang A.C. Luo L. piggyBac-based mosaic screen identifies a postmitotic function for cohesin in regulating developmental axon pruning.Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), dpr11LL01039. These were used as homozygotes or placed over a deficiency (Df), Df(3R)BSC193. For DIP-γ, we used DIP-γMiMIC over Df(3R)Exel6210. dpr11 and DIP-γ mutants are adult-viable. In both dpr11 and DIP-γ mutants, we observed NMJ phenotypes characterized by the presence of supernumerary clustered small boutons known as satellites (Figures 4D–4F and S4A). The number of satellite boutons at the muscle 4 NMJ was increased by 5- to 6-fold relative to wild-type (WT) and by ∼3-fold relative to heterozygous animals (Figure 4G). A transheterozygote (dpr11MiMIC/DIP-γMiMIC) lacking one WT copy of each gene had an equally strong phenotype. This type of interaction between two genes has been observed for other ligand-receptor pairs, including Slit-Roundabout and Semaphorin-Plexin (Kidd et al., 1999Kidd T. Bland K.S. Goodman C.S. Slit is the midline repellent for the robo receptor in Drosophila.Cell. 1999; 96: 785-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, Winberg et al., 1998Winberg M.L. Noordermeer J.N. Tamagnone L. Comoglio P.M. Spriggs M.K. Tessier-Lavigne M. Goodman C.S. Plexin A is a neuronal semaphorin receptor that controls axon guidance.Cell. 1998; 95: 903-916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), and suggests that the encoded proteins function in the same pathway. Consistent with this model, a double mutant lacking both WT copies of each gene had a phenotype no stronger than that of the single mutants (Figure 4G). Given that Dpr11 and DIP-γ bind selectively to each other (Figure 1A), we interpret these findings as an indication that Dpr11-DIP-γ interactions are rate-limiting for control of satellite bouton formation. To define the cells in which Dpr11 and DIP-γ function, we conducted rescue experiments by expressing UAS constructs encoding Dpr11 and DIP-γ in neurons or muscles in the corresponding mutant background. Surprisingly, we observed that expression driven by either a pan-neuronal driver (Elav-GAL4) or a muscle-specific driver (myosin heavy chain [MHC]-GeneSwitch in the presence of RU486) (Osterwalder et al., 2001Osterwalder T. Yoon K.S. White B.H. Keshishian H. A conditional tissue-specific transgene expression system using inducible GAL4.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 12596-12601Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) fully rescued the satellite bouton phenotype for both dpr11 and DIP-γ (Figure 4G). These results are consistent with a model in which adhesion complexes can form between the neuron and the muscle in which Dpr11 is presynaptic and DIP-γ is postsynaptic, as well as vice versa, and the two types of complexes have equivalent functions in regulating presynaptic terminal maturation. However, the data do not exclude the possibility that cis Dpr11-DIP-γ complexes can form on motor neurons and/or on muscles and that these have functions during NMJ development. Satellites are likely to be immature boutons and are often observed in mutants in which the retrograde bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway, which controls NMJ arbor growth, is hyperactivated. In this pathway, a muscle-derived BMP ligand interacts with neuronal BMP receptors (for review, see O’Connor-Giles and Ganetzky, 2008O’Connor-Giles K.M. Ganetzky B. Satellite signaling at synapses.Fly (Austin). 2008; 2: 259-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To evaluate this for dpr11 and DIP-γ, we generated transheterozygotes with one mutant copy of these genes combined with one copy of a lethal mutation, Dadj1E4, in Daughters against dpp (Dad). Dad encodes a negative regulator of BMP signaling (Tsuneizumi et al., 1997Tsuneizumi K. Nakayama T. Kamoshida Y. Kornberg T.B. Christian J.L. Tabata T. Daughters against dpp modulates dpp organizing activity in Drosophila wing development.Nature. 1997; 389: 627-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) and interacts with other BMP pathway components to regulate NMJ development (Menon et al., 2015Menon K.P.

Unrestricted synaptic growth in spinster-a late endosomal protein implicated in TGF-beta-mediated synaptic growth regulation.Neuron. 2002; 36: 403-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We observed strong interactions, indicating that loss of Dpr11 or DIP-γ affects BMP signaling (Figure 4G). We also examined interactions between dpr11 and DIP-γ and an activated BMP receptor subunit, TkvACT. One copy of neuronally expressed UAS-TkvACT does not affect satellite bouton number on its own, but it can synergize with mutations in BMP regulators (O’Connor-Giles et al., 2008O’Connor-Giles K.M.

Nervous wreck interacts with thickveins and the endocytic machinery to attenuate retrograde BMP signaling during synaptic growth.Neuron. 2008; 58: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We found that combining neuronal UAS-TkvACT with one mutant copy of dpr11 or DIP-γ generated satellite bouton phenotypes (Figure 4G), confirming that Dpr11 and DIP-γ regulate signaling through the BMP pathway. Finally, we examined phosphorylated Mothers against dpp protein (pMad), which is commonly used as a readout for BMP signaling intensity. In dpr11 mutants, pMad levels at the NMJ are greatly increased relative to WT (Figures 4H and 4I), indicating that BMP signaling is hyperactivated. To assess the electrophysiological consequences of the loss of each protein, we recorded miniature excitatory postsynaptic potential (mEPSPs) and EPSPs at 3rd instar NMJs. We observed matching electrophysiological phenotypes for dpr11 and DIP-γ mutants in which mEPSP amplitude and frequency were increased to similar extents (Figures 4J–4L, S4D, and S4E). However, there was no effect on evoked responses (EPSPs) (Figures S4B and S4C). mEPSP amplitude changes are usually associated with postsynaptic effects, while mEPSP frequency alterations are associated with presynaptic changes. In summary, the NMJ data show that the loss of either Dpr11 or DIP-γ causes the same defects in presynaptic terminal maturation and neurotransmission. To examine whether Dprs and DIPs are involved in determining synaptic connectivity patterns, we examined their expression and function in the pupal and adult visual system. The retina has ∼800 ommatidia (Om), each containing eight photoreceptors (PRs), R1–R8. R1–R6 are used for motion detection, while R7 and R8 mediate color vision. R7 and R8 project directly to the medulla (Me), while R1–R6 connect indirectly with the Me through lamina (La) neurons. The Me is a 10-layered neuropil divided into ∼800 columns. There are at least 60 types of Me neurons (Fischbach and Dittrich, 1989Fischbach K.F. Dittrich A.P.M. The optic lobe of Drosophila melanogaster. I.

Their cell bodies are outside the neuropil, and each neuron arborizes and forms synapses in a specific set of Me layers. Local neurons are restricted to the Me, while projection neurons arborize in Me layers and send axons to the lobula (Lo) and lobula plate (Lop), which are higher-order centers that integrate input from Me columns and connect to the central brain (Figure 5A).

These data provide evidence for a model of hematopoietic branching in which multiple distinct lineage commitments occur in parallel within the MPP pool. During hematopoiesis, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) self-renew or differentiate into all blood cell types through successive stages of lineage commitment, a process that has become a prototype of multi-lineage diversification from a stem cell pool. The prevailing model of hematopoiesis predicts a step-by-step process of lineage commitment in which HSCs give rise to multipotent progenitors (MPPs) that subsequently generate intermediate lineage restricted progenitors. The strongest support for this model has come from the identification of the common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) (Kondo et al., 1997Kondo M. Weissman I.L. Akashi K. Identification of clonogenic common lymphoid progenitors in mouse bone marrow.Cell. 1997; 91: 661-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar) that produces lymphoid cells (i.e., T and B lymphocytes and NK cells) and the common myeloid progenitor (CMP) (Akashi et al., 2000Akashi K.

A clonogenic common myeloid progenitor that gives rise to all myeloid lineages.Nature. 2000; 404: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1906) Google Scholar) that gives rise to granulocyte-macrophage (GM) progenitors and to the megakaryocyte-erythroid (MkE) progenitors. In this model, the lymphoid-myeloid split forms the first step in lineage commitment downstream of MPPs (Reya et al., 2001Reya T. Morrison S.J. Clarke M.F. Weissman I.L. Stem cells, cancer, and cancer stem cells.Nature. 2001; 414: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (7862) Google Scholar).

Overall, which lineage commitment occurs first between the lymphoid, myeloid, or erythroid lineages remains to be determined. Importantly, most of the results that bear on this question have been obtained using in vitro clonal assays or population-based tracking approaches that can miss in vivo cellular heterogeneity and, thereby, influence our interpretation of lineage commitment. To address this issue, here we have utilized cellular barcoding technology that allows the in vivo tracking of single cell fate (Gerlach et al., 2013Gerlach C. Rohr J.C.

To understand the clonal output of individual CMPs, we obtained mouse CMPs based on their original description (ckit+Sca1−CD16/32lowCD34+) (Akashi et al., 2000Akashi K. Traver D. Miyamoto T. Weissman I.L. A clonogenic common myeloid progenitor that gives rise to all myeloid lineages.Nature. 2000; 404: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1906) Google Scholar), labeled these with unique genetic barcodes in a 6 hr in vitro process, and assessed their ability for myelopoiesis (for the GM lineage) and erythropoiesis (for the MkE lineage). At different time points after transplantation of 2 × 103 barcode-labeled CMPs into irradiated recipients, CMP-derived myeloid cells (GFP+CD11b+) and erythroblasts (GFP+Ter119+) were sorted and assessed for their barcode identity using PCR and deep-sequencing (Figures 1A, 1C, and 1D ; Table S1). Erythroblasts were measured as a proxy for erythropoiesis, as they retain the nucleus required for barcode analysis. Subsequently, barcode-labeled CMPs were assigned to a class of (lineage-biased) progenitor using a hand-tailored classifier that is based on cellular output of each individual progenitor toward the examined lineages (Naik et al., 2013Naik S.H.

Diverse and heritable lineage imprinting of early haematopoietic progenitors.Nature. 2013; 496: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Six days after transplantation, we found that 95% of the engrafted CMPs showed highly biased (>99% of cellular output) production of myeloid cells (69% ± 17% of presumed CMPs) or highly biased (>99% of cellular output) production of erythroblasts (26% ± 13% of presumed CMPs) (Figure 2A; quality controls shown in Figures S1A and S1B; effect of classification threshold in Figures S1D and S1F). Furthermore, this large pool of myeloid-biased or erythroid-biased CMPs accounted for 82% ± 13% and 53% ± 27% of total myeloid cell and erythroblast production, respectively (Figures 2B and S1D). Only 5% ± 4% of CMPs produced appreciable numbers of both myeloid cells and erythroblasts, overall accounting for 11% ± 12% of total myeloid cell reads and 40% ± 27% of total erythroblast reads (Figures 2B, S1D, and S1F). The observation of this high frequency of uni-outcome CMPs could not be explained by limits of detection or sampling issues, as determined by the following detection controls: (1) the per progenitor output (as measured in read counts) of uni-outcome CMPs toward one specific lineage (i.e., myeloid cells or erythroblasts) was as high as the per progenitor output of bi-outcome CMPs toward the same lineage (Figure S1H), and (2) the absence of output of uni-outcome CMPs toward the other lineage was reproducible in technical replicates before applying the replicate filter (data not shown). In other words, lack of detectable output of a given CMP toward either the myeloid cell or erythroblast compartment was a reproducible feature.Figure 2Individual CMPs Yield Either Erythrocytes or Myeloid Cells, Related to Figures S1, S2, and S3Show full caption(A–G) Barcode-labeled CMPs were transplanted into 5gy-irradiated mice.

Classification was done with a threshold of 1%. The graph is representative of one experiment and shows that the read distribution of uni-outcome CMPs was similar to that of the bi-outcome CMPs. (I) Same as (H) for day 14. Showing that also at this time point the cumulative read distribution of uni-outcome CMPs was similar to that of bi-outcome CMPs. Together with sampling controls as shown in (A), these data indicate that the frequent observation of uni-outcome CMPs is not explained by the low cellular output of these cells. Similarly, when assessed 14 days after transplantation, 74% of the engrafted CMP produced essentially only myeloid cells (35% ± 3% of presumed CMPs) or only erythroblasts (39% ± 12% of presumed CMPs) (Figures 2C and S1E), accounting for 74% ± 16% and 53% ± 35% of total myeloid cell and erythroblast production, respectively (Figure 2D; effect of the thresholds shown in Figure S1G; detection control shown in Figure S1I). Also at this point in time, only a minority of CMPs showed substantial production of both myeloid cells and erythroblasts. Finally, heterogeneity in output toward either the myeloid and erythrocyte lineage is not specific to the spleen but was also observed in the bone marrow, where 90% of the engrafted CMP also produced essentially only myeloid cells (35% ± 9% of presumed CMPs) or essentially only erythroblasts (55% ± 12% of presumed CMPs) (Figures 2F, 2G, S2A, and S2B). The observation of the somewhat higher fraction of CMPs with detectable output in both the myeloid and erythrocyte lineage over time (day 6: 5% ± 4% of presumed CMPs; day 14: 26% ± 15% of presumed CMPs) may either be interpreted as a more prolonged engraftment potential of the small subset of CMPs producing both erythroblasts and myeloid cells or as contamination of CMPs by Lin−Sca1+ckit+ (LSK) cells (Figure S1C), whose contribution may also be expected to increase over time after transplantation. A preponderance of uni-output was also observed at two CMP doses tested (Figures S2C and S2D). In addition to heterogeneity in output toward the myeloid and erythrocyte lineage, further disparity in cellular output between individual CMPs was observed at day 14 after transplantation (Figures 2E and S3A), with 16% ± 4% of CMPs producing detectable output only in the dendritic cell (DC) lineage (Figure S3B, note that DC production could not be assessed at day 6). These DC uni-outcome CMPs accounted for 24% ± 25% of total DC production (Figure S3B), and their presence could not be explained by limits of detection (Figure S3C). While these data do not exclude the possibility that some DC uni-outcome CMPs might have produced myeloid cells or erythroblasts at an earlier point in time, this would then imply that individual CMPs differ in the kinetics with which they contribute to DC versus myeloid/erythroid lineage. Collectively, these data show a striking heterogeneity within the CMP pool, greater than previously suggested by in vitro or in vivo experiments that examined output at the population level (Iwasaki et al., 2005Iwasaki H.

Importantly, this heterogeneity could not be explained by detection issues, and it was relatively insensitive to the threshold used for output classification (Figures S1D–S1I, S2A, S2B, S3C, and S3D). To determine at which developmental point the observed divergence between the myeloid and erythroid lineage occurs, we subsequently generated barcode-labeled HSCs (LSK+CD150+) and MPPs (LSK+CD150−Flt3+, excluding lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors) (Figure 1B) and, after transplantation, analyzed their production of myeloid cells and erythroblasts together with their lymphoid cell production"
https://openalex.org/W2220753543,"Touch perception begins with activation of low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) in the periphery. LTMR terminals exhibit tremendous morphological heterogeneity that specifies their mechanical receptivity. In a survey of mammalian skin, we found a preponderance of neurofilament-heavy-chain(+) circumferential endings associated with hair follicles, prompting us to develop a genetic strategy to interrogate these neurons. Targeted in vivo recordings revealed them to be Aβ field-LTMRs, identified 50 years ago but largely elusive thereafter. Remarkably, while Aβ field-LTMRs are highly sensitive to gentle stroking of the skin, they are unresponsive to hair deflection, and they encode skin indentation in the noxious range across large, spotty receptive fields. Individual Aβ field-LTMRs form up to 180 circumferential endings, making them the most anatomically expansive LTMR identified to date. Thus, Aβ field-LTMRs are a major mammalian LTMR subtype that forms circumferential endings in hairy skin, and their sensitivity to gentle skin stroking arises through integration across many low-sensitivity circumferential endings."

Synaptogenic proteins may demarcate and function at specialized synaptic zones, yet limited understanding of cleft topography restricts addressing these questions. We here delineated macromolecular properties of the excitatory synaptic cleft. To gain molecular insights, we investigated two proteins that form trans-synaptic complexes to promote excitatory synapse number, the immunoglobulin adhesion protein SynCAM 1 (Synaptic Cell Adhesion Molecule 1, also named nectin-like 2 or Cadm1) (Biederer et al., 2002Biederer T.

Analysis of excitatory synapses by cryoelectron tomography (cryo-ET), immuno-EM, and STED (stimulated emission depletion) and STORM (stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy) super-resolution imaging supports that the synaptic cleft is composed of structurally and molecularly defined sub-compartments. Cryo-ET enables high-resolution imaging of the entire cleft in a fully hydrated, physiologically relevant state (Lučič et al., 2013Lučič V. Rigort A. Baumeister W. Cryo-electron tomography: the challenge of doing structural biology in situ.J. Cell Biol. 2013; 202: 407-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). We recorded tomograms of neocortical synaptosomes from adult mice (Figures 1A and S1A). All analyzed synapses were asymmetric with a postsynaptic density (PSD) and likely corresponded to excitatory synapses. The mean cleft width of wild-type (WT) synapses was 22.0 ± 0.5 nm (Figure S1C), as described (Rees et al., 1976Rees R.P. Bunge M.B. Bunge R.P. Morphological changes in the neuritic growth cone and target neuron during synaptic junction development in culture.J. Cell Biol. 1976; 68: 240-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Numerous complexes spanned the cleft and often assumed the shape of a laterally extended, net-like density (Figure 1A; Movie S1), as described (Lucić et al., 2005Lucić V. Yang T. Schweikert G. Förster F. Baumeister W. Morphological characterization of molecular complexes present in the synaptic cleft.Structure. 2005; 13: 423-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Trans complexes and net-like structures were seen in all analyzed tomograms. Observation of tomograms indicated an increased central density in the cleft, closer to the postsynaptic side (Figure 1B; Movie S2). To measure whether this density is offset from the middle, we separated the cleft into four layers because this gave the most robust results with low noise (Figure 1C). Each cleft was further divided into four concentric columns with even radii (Figure 1C). Lower cryo-ET grayscale values correspond to higher protein densities, and mean grayscale values exhibited a minimum, i.e., highest, density in the second layer counted from the post- to pre-synaptic membrane when all columns were combined (layer 2 versus layers 1, 3, 4; paired t test, p = 0.0007 [layer 1], p = 0.015 [layer 3], p = 0.0001 [layer 4]; N = 7 WT synapses), as well as in the outermost column (Figures 1D and 1E, left; layer 2 versus layers 1, 3, 4; paired t test, p = 0.015 [layer 1], p = 0.019 [layer 3], p = 0.0003 [layer 4]; N = 7 WT synapses). Densities of the four cleft columns were indistinguishable (data not shown). We next tested whether SynCAM 1 affects the makeup of the synaptic cleft, choosing this immunoglobulin adhesion protein due to its expression across excitatory forebrain synapses, its ability to increase excitatory synapse number in cultured neurons and the brain, and the high synaptic membrane content of SynCAMs (Biederer et al., 2002Biederer T. Sara Y. Mozhayeva M. Atasoy D. Liu X. Kavalali E.T. Südhof T.C. SynCAM, a synaptic adhesion molecule that drives synapse assembly.Science. 2002; 297: 1525-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, Fogel et al., 2007Fogel A.I. Akins M.R. Krupp A.J. Stagi M.

SynCAM 1 adhesion dynamically regulates synapse number and impacts plasticity and learning.Neuron. 2010; 68: 894-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Neocortical synaptosomes from adult SynCAM 1 knockout (KO) mice had the same cleft width as those from WT (Figures 1D, S1A, and S1C). Loss of SynCAM 1 did not alter the layer profile when the data of all columns were averaged (data not shown) or in the outermost column (Figures 1D and 1E, right). The higher grayscale values in the KO could not be interpreted with certainty as lower total cleft protein amounts because of the inability to determine absolute values with cryo-ET. However, relative changes can be robustly compared. This showed that synapses lacking SynCAM 1 exhibited a loss of relative protein density, i.e., an increased grayscale differential, in the outermost cleft column compared to the inner columns (Figure 1F; t test, p = 0.037; N = 7 WT and 8 KO synapses). Loss of SynCAM 1 therefore lowers the density distribution toward the synaptic edge. Because SynCAM 1 loss preserved the highest density in layer 2, other complexes likely establish this profile. We asked whether those interactions can be imbalanced by elevating SynCAM 1. We recorded cryo-ET images of synaptosomes from transgenic mice overexpressing SynCAM 1 in excitatory neurons and from littermates lacking the SynCAM 1 transgene (transgenic controls) (Figure 1G). Cleft width was unaffected by elevated SynCAM 1 (Figures S1B and S1C). Control synapses showed the layer profile expected from WT synapses (Figure 1H, left, versus Figure 1E, left). In contrast, the profile of overexpressor (OE) synapses was flat (Figure 1H, right). We measured an inverted difference (higher density in layer 1 than in layer 2) in the outermost column of OE synapses, different from controls (t test, p = 0.0044; N = 5 synapses each) (Figures 1I and 1J). This inversion only occurred in the outermost column (data not shown). Elevated SynCAM 1 therefore disrupts the layer profile in the outer cleft column, possibly through its increased expression at the postsynaptic edge. These structural aberrations after loss and overexpression of SynCAM 1 indicated that this adhesion protein organizes the outer zone of the cleft. We next localized endogenous SynCAM 1 using immuno-EM of high-pressure frozen hippocampal slices from adult mice (Figure 2A). In CA1 stratum radiatum, anti-SynCAM 1 immunogold particles labeled most frequently excitatory synapses. This was expected from an immuno-EM study with antibodies detecting the family members SynCAM 1, 2, or 3 equally well (Biederer et al., 2002Biederer T. Sara Y. Mozhayeva M. Atasoy D. Liu X. Kavalali E.T. Südhof T.C. SynCAM, a synaptic adhesion molecule that drives synapse assembly.Science. 2002; 297: 1525-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar) and biochemical fractionation (Fogel et al., 2007Fogel A.I. Akins M.R. Krupp A.J. Stagi M. Stein V. Biederer T. SynCAMs organize synapses through heterophilic adhesion.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 12516-12530Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Synaptic labeling was reduced by 84% ± 4% in SynCAM 1 KO sections, validating antibody specificity (Figure S2A). At WT CA1 synapses, gold particles were most common at postsynaptic membranes (46% ± 6% of total synaptic labeling) (Figure 2B). Less labeling was found in the pre- and postsynaptic cytomatrix and presynaptic membranes. To map SynCAM 1 distribution, we measured distances of the gold particles at postsynaptic membranes relative to the PSD center (Figure 2C). This determined that postsynaptic SynCAM 1 localizes to the cleft edge (Figure 2D). The less abundant SynCAM 1 particles at presynaptic membranes were distributed as two populations, one more central and the other peri-synaptic (Figure S2B). These results supported an enrichment of postsynaptic SynCAM 1 at the edge of excitatory synapses. A second important player in the cleft is the postsynaptic receptor tyrosine kinase EphB2 that promotes excitatory synaptogenesis during the rapid phase of synapse addition before neurons mature (Kayser et al., 2008Kayser M.S. Nolt M.J. Dalva M.B. EphB receptors couple dendritic filopodia motility to synapse formation.Neuron. 2008; 59: 56-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, Sheffler-Collins and Dalva, 2012Sheffler-Collins S.I. Dalva M.B. EphBs: an integral link between synaptic function and synaptopathies.Trends Neurosci. 2012; 35: 293-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This role differs from SynCAM 1, which first induces and then maintains excitatory synapses (Robbins et al., 2010Robbins E.M. Krupp A.J. Perez de Arce K. Ghosh A.K. Fogel A.I. Boucard A. Südhof T.C. Stein V. Biederer T. SynCAM 1 adhesion dynamically regulates synapse number and impacts plasticity and learning.Neuron. 2010; 68: 894-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We speculated that this functional difference may be reflected in distinct sub-synaptic localizations. We first addressed to what extent these proteins co-localize at excitatory synapses. Non-permeabilized hippocampal neurons were immunolabeled for endogenous, surface-expressed SynCAM 1 and EphB2 at 14 days in vitro (div) with antibodies against their extracellular domains, followed by permeabilization, immunostaining for the excitatory postsynaptic scaffold protein Homer, and confocal microscopy (Figure 2E). SynCAM 1 and EphB2 were detected at comparable densities along dendrites (data not shown). Automated three-channel co-localization analysis measured that 74% ± 9% of Homer puncta contained SynCAM 1, EphB2, or both. Of the Homer-positive SynCAM 1 puncta, 88% ± 1% co-localized with EphB2, while all synaptic EphB2 puncta were positive for SynCAM 1 (N = 69 dendritic segments from three independent experiments). We next analyzed the sub-synaptic distribution of surface SynCAM 1 and EphB2 by two-channel STED super-resolution microscopy, applying the same sequential immunostaining (Figures 2F and 2G). This showed that SynCAM 1 has a high density at the PSD border, while EphB2 resides within the bounds of the PSD proper (Figure 2H). Trans-synaptic complexes can therefore mark distinct synaptic zones. What is the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of synapse-organizing proteins? To address this question, we used two-color 3D direct STORM (Huang et al., 2008Huang B. Wang W. Bates M. Zhuang X. Three-dimensional super-resolution imaging by stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy.Science. 2008; 319: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar) to analyze cultures of hippocampal neurons at 12–14 div. Endogenous, surface-expressed SynCAM 1 or EphB2 and postsynaptic Homer were visualized by sequential immunostaining and imaged by 3D direct STORM (Figures 3A and 3B ). SynCAM 1 and EphB2 were found along dendrites, including near Homer-positive PSDs. The 3D border of each PSD was defined with a convex hull around Homer localizations (Dani et al., 2010Dani A. Huang B. Bergan J. Dulac C. Zhuang X. Superresolution imaging of chemical synapses in the brain.Neuron. 2010; 68: 843-856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, MacGillavry et al., 2013MacGillavry H.D. Song Y. Raghavachari S. Blanpied T.A. Nanoscale scaffolding domains within the postsynaptic density concentrate synaptic AMPA receptors.Neuron. 2013; 78: 615-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), and the density of SynCAM localizations was determined within this border and outside it in 50 nm shells (Figure 3C). This revealed a prominent peak of SynCAM 1 density between 100 and 200 nm outside the PSD border. This agrees with the immuno-EM and STED localizations, though differences of synapses formed in vivo and by cultured neurons, maturation stage, and two-dimensional STED and 3D STORM imaging need to be considered. We consider antibody penetration issues unlikely, because post-embedding immuno-EM, which is not expected to be affected by access issues, showed similarly restricted labeling (Figure 2D). In contrast to SynCAM 1, EphB2 localizations by 3D STORM were most prominent deeper within the postsynaptic area, with a smaller peak of EphB2 between 100 and 200 nm outside the PSD (Figures 3B and 3C). Of all PSDs, 79% had SynCAM surface localizations within 500 nm of their border and a subset of SynCAM 1 localizations appeared in large ensembles (Figure 3D). To characterize these grouped localizations using automated analysis, we applied area and density criteria to select ensembles that likely consisted of multiple SynCAM 1 molecules (Figures 3E and S3). The volume of SynCAM 1 ensembles varied widely, averaging 8.4 x 106 nm3 with a SD of 6.6 x 106 nm3. The median volume was 3.9 x 106 nm3, approximately one-third the volume of Homer-defined PSDs (median 9.4 x 106 ± 1.5 x 106 nm3). Of PSDs, 21% had SynCAM 1 ensembles within 500 nm of their border, suggesting that they belonged to a unique subpopulation of synapses. To determine whether the presence of SynCAM 1 ensembles correlated with structural features, we measured Homer clusters (Figure 3F). This showed that synapses lacking SynCAM 1 ensembles had an average Homer volume of 7.2 x 106 ± 0.8 x 106 nm3 (N = 120), while Homer clusters had almost twice the volume when marked by SynCAM 1 ensembles (13.1 x 106 ± 2.3 x 106 nm3; N = 31; t test, p = 0.003). These ensembles thus revealed a novel macromolecular feature of trans-synaptic complexes. Neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity regulate the trafficking of N-cadherin and its interactions with β-catenins (Hirano and Takeichi, 2012Hirano S. Takeichi M. Cadherins in brain morphogenesis and wiring.Physiol. Rev. 2012; 92: 597-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Can the distribution of synaptogenic proteins also change in an activity-dependent manner? SynCAM 1 was well suited to test this question, because the position of SynCAM complexes at the synaptic edge may allow them to be readily dispersed. We used a chemical long-term depression (LTD) protocol because SynCAM 1 regulates LTD in vivo (Robbins et al., 2010Robbins E.M. Krupp A.J. Perez de Arce K. Ghosh A.K. Fogel A.I. Boucard A. Südhof T.C. Stein V. Biederer T. SynCAM 1 adhesion dynamically regulates synapse number and impacts plasticity and learning.Neuron. 2010; 68: 894-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Sequential immunostainings were performed for surface SynCAM 1 and the excitatory postsynaptic scaffold protein PSD-95 and were imaged by confocal microscopy (Figure 4A). Analysis was restricted to surface-labeled SynCAM 1 within 0.8 μm of the center of the nearest PSD-95 punctum to measure SynCAM 1 puncta within approximately one PSD diameter, which in our confocal analysis was 0.65 ± 0.02 μm (N = 41 neurites). LTD treatment enlarged synaptic SynCAM 1 puncta by 27% ± 5% (t test, p < 0.0001; N = 41 neurites each). Frequency distribution analysis supported a LTD-induced enlargement of SynCAM 1 puncta across all area ranges (Figure 4B). Synaptic SynCAM 1 proteins can therefore undergo dynamic changes in their surface distribution. This study reports five findings about the cleft of excitatory synapses. First, the cleft is structurally patterned. Second, the cleft is molecularly organized, with SynCAM 1 marking the edge and EphB2 marking the central areas. Third, SynCAM 1 shapes the edge of the cleft. Fourth, SynCAM 1 proteins can form cloud-like ensembles around the postsynaptic border. Fifth, our results support that synaptogenic proteins can undergo activity-dependent re-distribution. Our cryo-ET analysis provides evidence that the excitatory synaptic cleft can be stratified into layers based on protein densities, reminiscent of the intra-cleft line (Gray, 1959Gray E.G. Axo-somatic and axo-dendritic synapses of the cerebral cortex: an electron microscope study.J. Anat. 1959; 93: 420-433PubMed Google Scholar, Hajós, 1980Hajós F. The structure of cleft material in spine synapses of rat cerebral and cerebellar cortices.Cell Tissue Res. 1980; 206: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) prominent after phosphotungstic acid staining (Bloom and Aghajanian, 1968Bloom F.E. Aghajanian G.K. Fine structural and cytochemical analysis of the staining of synaptic junctions with phosphotungstic acid.J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1968; 22: 361-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). This indicates that clusters of adhesion molecules are repetitively organized. Future studies may uncover effects of maturation stage and brain regions on cleft organization. The density and layer profile of the outer cleft column are shaped by SynCAM 1, consistent with its localization to the postsynaptic edge. We regularly observed synaptic vesicles opposite SynCAM 1-labeled PSD edges and hence consider this zone unlikely to be puncta adhaerentia (Palay, 1967Palay S.L. Principles of cellular organization in the nervous system.in: Quorton G.C. Melnchuch T. Schmitt F.O. The Neurosciences. Rockefeller University Press, 1967: 24-31Google Scholar) but rather to be part of synaptic junctions. It is conceivable that SynCAM 1 participates in the conversion of nascent zones, specialized edge regions, into active zones (Bell et al., 2014Bell M.E. Bourne J.N. Chirillo M.A. Mendenhall J.M. Kuwajima M. Harris K.M. Dynamics of nascent and active zone ultrastructure as synapses enlarge during long-term potentiation in mature hippocampus.J. Comp. Neurol. 2014; 522: 3861-3884Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The shortened PSDs and active zones in SynCAM 1 KO mice (Robbins et al., 2010Robbins E.M. Krupp A.J. Perez de Arce K. Ghosh A.K. Fogel A.I. Boucard A. Südhof T.C. Stein V. Biederer T. SynCAM 1 adhesion dynamically regulates synapse number and impacts plasticity and learning.Neuron. 2010; 68: 894-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) may be due to SynCAM 1 loss in this outer column, consistent with our result that PSDs with SynCAM 1 ensembles are substantially larger than those without. SynCAM 1 loss and overexpression selectively affect the structural organization of the cleft’s edge, supporting that differences in the adhesive makeup of synapses are a factor in shaping them. The central density along the cleft is unaffected by SynCAM 1 and is hence likely established by other proteins such as neuroligins or β-neurexins, which form sheets at non-neuronal cell contacts, with a higher density closer to neuroligin (Tanaka et al., 2012Tanaka H. Miyazaki N. Matoba K. Nogi T. Iwasaki K. Takagi J. Higher-order architecture of cell adhesion mediated by polymorphic synaptic adhesion molecules neurexin and neuroligin.Cell Rep. 2012; 2: 101-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). One reason for the diversity of adhesion systems at excitatory synapses may be that they need to occupy distinct cleft nanodomains to instruct different characteristics of synapses. EphB2, acting during the initial period of synapse formation (Kayser et al., 2008Kayser M.S. Nolt M.J. Dalva M.B. EphB receptors couple dendritic filopodia motility to synapse formation.Neuron. 2008; 59: 56-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and SynCAM 1, which induces excitatory synapses and is then required to maintain this increase (Robbins et al., 2010Robbins E.M. Krupp A.J. Perez de Arce K. Ghosh A.K. Fogel A.I. Boucard A. Südhof T.C. Stein V. Biederer T. SynCAM 1 adhesion dynamically regulates synapse number and impacts plasticity and learning.Neuron. 2010; 68: 894-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), are differentially localized to areas deeper in the postsynaptic area and around the PSD. The mechanisms that position trans-synaptic organizers with such precision are currently unknown. Given the role of SynCAM 1 in synapse maintenance, it is conceivable that the stabilization of synapses involves interactions at their edge, possibly through links of SynCAM 1 to the postsynaptic cytoskeleton (Cheadle and Biederer, 2012Cheadle L. Biederer T. The novel synaptogenic protein Farp1 links postsynaptic cytoskeletal dynamics and transsynaptic organization.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 199: 985-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Selectively positioned trans-synaptic proteins may also affect synapse function and define specialized synaptic zones such as proposed for neurotransmitter release (Kavalali, 2015Kavalali E.T. The mechanisms and functions of spontaneous neurotransmitter release.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2015; 16: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The density profile of the cleft is relevant for transmission too, because cleft geometry is predicted to shape synaptic currents (Savtchenko and Rusakov, 2007Savtchenko L.P. Rusakov D.A. The optimal height of the synaptic cleft.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 1823-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Moreover, the density of the cleft’s edge could control access of extra-synaptic neurotransmitter receptors (Choquet and Triller, 2013Choquet D. Triller A. The dynamic synapse.Neuron. 2013; 80: 691-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) via presentation of binding sites or macromolecular crowding (Santamaria et al., 2010Santamaria F. Gonzalez J. Augustine G.J. Raghavachari S. Quantifying the effects of elastic collisions and non-covalent binding on glutamate receptor trafficking in the post-synaptic density.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2010; 6: e1000780Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). PSD size correlates with basal synaptic strength (Harris and Weinberg, 2012Harris K.M. Weinberg R.J. Ultrastructure of synapses in the mammalian brain.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4: a005587Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and the presence of SynCAM 1 ensembles linked to larger PSDs may be regulated by the activity history of each synapse. Given the structural dynamics of synapses during plasticity, it is also of interest that postsynaptic SynCAM 1 complexes occupy a larger area after LTD. In contrast to SynCAM 1, neuroligin 1 is rapidly internalized upon LTD (Schapitz et al., 2010Schapitz I.U. Behrend B. Pechmann Y. Lappe-Siefke C. Kneussel S.J. Wallace K.E. Stempel A.V. Buck F. Grant S.G. Schweizer M. et al.Neuroligin 1 is dynamically exchanged at postsynaptic sites.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 12733-12744Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and cleaved (Peixoto et al., 2012Peixoto R.T. Kunz P.A. Kwon H. Mabb A.M. Sabatini B.L. Philpot B.D. Ehlers M.D. Transsynaptic signaling by activity-dependent cleavage of neuroligin-1.Neuron. 2012; 76: 396-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Synapse-organizing proteins hence exhibit distinct activity-dependent dynamics, adding to the molecular diversity of the cleft. Our study provides evidence that the synaptic cleft is organized into sub-compartments. This introduces the concept of nanodomains to the cleft and expands recent insights into active zones and postsynaptic sites (Choquet and Triller, 2013Choquet D. Triller A. The dynamic synapse.Neuron. 2013; 80: 691-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, MacGillavry et al., 2013MacGillavry H.D. Song Y. Raghavachari S. Blanpied T.A.

Differences in the nanoscale organization and dynamics of the cleft may be important parameters that specify synaptic properties. Cerebral cortex homogenates from mice were subjected to differential centrifugation, followed by Percoll gradient purification of synaptosomes and vitrification. Tilt series were collected using a Polara electron microscope (FEI), reconstructed, and segmented. Acute hippocampal slices were prepared, and high-pressure frozen CA1 samples were processed for post-embedding immuno-EM with monoclonal anti-SynCAM 1 antibodies (MBL International, clone 3E1; 1:50). Grids were observed with a FEI Tecnai Biotwin electron microscope. Hippocampal neurons were cultured from embryonic day 18 rat embryos for STORM imaging and confocal co-localization. Hippocampal cultures from postnatal day 1 rats were used for STED imaging and LTD studies. Chemical LTD was induced at 14 div by treating neurons for 3 min with 20 μM N-methyl-D-aspartate. Non-permeabilized neurons were subjected at 14 div to surface labeling with antibodies against the extracellular domain of SynCAM 1 (MBL International, 3E1; 1:1,000) or EphB2 (R&D Systems, AF467; 1:100). Homer was immunodetected after permeabilization (Synaptic Systems, 160 003; 1:500), as was PSD-95 (NeuroMab, clone K28/43; 1:500). A Leica TCS SPE DM2500 microscope was used for confocal imaging. Neurons were subjected to sequential immunostaining as described above and imaged on a custom-built gated detection, beam scanning, all-pulsed laser STED system with a 100× oil objective (UPLAPO 100XO/PSF, Olympus). Fluorescence was detected by a single photon counting module (SPCM) avalanche photodiode (SPCM-AQR-13-FC, PerkinElmer). Neurons were subjected to sequential immunostaining as described above and imaged on an Olympus IX81 ZDC2 microscope with a 100×/1.49 total internal reflection fluorescence oil objective using simultaneous excitation with 647 and 561 nm lasers. Stochastic blinking was detected with an iXon+ 897 electron microscopy (EM)-charge-coupled device camera (Andor). An astigmatic lens was added, and z axis positions of localized molecules were deduced post hoc.

https://openalex.org/W2219595429,"The members of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase family are important players in breast morphogenesis and cancer. EGFR2/HER2 and EGFR expression have a prognostic value in certain subtypes of breast cancer such as HER2-amplified, basal-like and luminal type B. Many clinically approved small molecular inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies have been designed to target HER2, EGFR or both. There is, however, still limited knowledge on how the two receptors are expressed in normal breast epithelium, what effects they have on cellular differentiation and how they participate in neoplastic transformation. D492 is a breast epithelial cell line with stem cell properties that can undergo epithelial to mesenchyme transition (EMT), generate luminal- and myoepithelial cells and form complex branching structures in three-dimensional (3D) culture. Here, we show that overexpression of HER2 in D492 (D492(HER2)) resulted in EMT, loss of contact growth inhibition and increased oncogenic potential in vivo. HER2 overexpression, furthermore, inhibited endogenous EGFR expression. Re-introducing EGFR in D492(HER2) (D492(HER2/EGFR)) partially reversed the mesenchymal state of the cells, as an epithelial phenotype reappeared both in 3D cultures and in vivo. The D492(HER2/EGFR) xenografts grow slower than the D492(HER2) tumors, while overexpression of EGFR alone (D492(EGFR)) was not oncogenic in vivo. Consistent with the EGFR-mediated epithelial phenotype, overexpression of EGFR drove the cells toward a myoepithelial phenotype in 3D culture. The effect of two clinically approved anti-HER2 and EGFR therapies, trastuzumab and cetuximab, was tested alone and in combination on D492(HER2) xenografts. While trastuzumab had a growth inhibitory effect compared with untreated control, the effect of cetuximab was limited. When administered in combination, the growth inhibitory effect of trastuzumab was less pronounced. Collectively, our data indicate that in HER2-overexpressing D492 cells, EGFR can behave as a tumor suppressor, by pushing the cells towards epithelial differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2339287322,"The low extracellular pH in the microenvironment has been shown to promote tumor growth and metastasis; however, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Particularly, little is known how the tumor cell senses the acidic signal to activate the acidosis-mediated signaling. In this study, we show that breast cancer cells express acid-sensing ion channel 1 (ASIC1), a proton-gated cation channel primarily expressed in the nervous system. RNA interference, knockout and rescue experiments demonstrate a critical role for ASIC1 in acidosis-induced reactive oxidative species and NF-κB activation, two key events for tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, ASIC1 is required for acidosis-mediated signaling through calcium influx. We show that as a cytoplasmic membrane protein, ASIC1 is also associated with mitochondria, suggesting that ASIC1 may regulate mitochondrial calcium influx. Importantly, interrogation of the Cancer Genome Atlas breast invasive carcinoma data set indicates that alterations of ASIC1 alone or combined with other 4 ASIC genes are significantly correlated with poor patient survival. Furthermore, ASIC1 inhibitors cause a significant reduction of tumor growth and tumor load. Together, these results suggest that ASIC1 contributes to breast cancer pathogenesis in response to acidic tumor microenvironments, and ASIC1 may serve as a prognostic marker and a therapeutic target for breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2204374538,"MACC1 (metastasis associated in colon cancer 1) is a prognostic biomarker for tumor progression, metastasis and survival of a variety of solid cancers including colorectal cancer (CRC). Here we aimed to identify the MACC1-induced transcriptome and key players mediating the MACC1-induced effects in CRC. We performed microarray analyses using CRC cells ectopically overexpressing MACC1. We identified more than 1300 genes at least twofold differentially expressed, including the gene SPON2 (Spondin 2) as 90-fold upregulated transcriptional target of MACC1. MACC1-dependent SPON2 expression regulation was validated on mRNA and protein levels in MACC1 high (endogenously or ectopically) and low (endogenously or by knockdown) expressing cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated the binding of MACC1 to the gene promoter of SPON2. In cell culture, ectopic SPON2 overexpression induced cell viability, migration, invasion and colony formation in endogenously MACC1 and SPON2 low expressing cells, whereas SPON2 knockdown reduced proliferative, migratory and invasive abilities in CRC cells with high endogenous MACC1 and SPON2 expression. In intrasplenically transplanted NOD/SCID mice, metastasis induction was analyzed with control or SPON2-overexpressing CRC cells. Tumors with SPON2 overexpression induced liver metastasis (vs control animals without any metastases, P=0.0036). In CRC patients, SPON2 expression was determined in primary tumors (stages I–III), and survival time was analyzed by Kaplan–Meier method. CRC patients with high SPON2 expressing primary tumors demonstrated 8 months shorter metastasis-free survival (MFS) compared with patients with low SPON2 levels (P=0.053). Combining high levels of SPON2 and MACC1 improved the identification of high-risk patients with a 20-month shorter MFS vs patients with low biomarker expression. In summary, SPON2 is a transcriptional target of the metastasis gene MACC1. SPON2 induces cell motility in vitro and CRC metastasis in mice. In patients, SPON2 serves as prognostic indicator for CRC metastasis and survival, and might represent a promising target for therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2210531927,"Mature messenger RNAs (mRNAs) consist of coding sequence (CDS) and 5' and 3' UTRs, typically expected to show similar abundance within a given neuron. Examining mRNA from defined neurons, we unexpectedly show extremely common unbalanced expression of cognate 3' UTR and CDS sequences; many genes show high 3' UTR relative to CDS, others show high CDS to 3' UTR. In situ hybridization (19 of 19 genes) shows a broad range of 3' UTR-to-CDS expression ratios across neurons and tissues. Ratios may be spatially graded or change with developmental age but are consistent across animals. Further, for two genes examined, a 3' UTR-to-CDS ratio above a particular threshold in any given neuron correlated with reduced or undetectable protein expression. Our findings raise questions about the role of isolated 3' UTR sequences in regulation of protein expression and highlight the importance of separately examining 3' UTR and CDS sequences in gene expression analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2213635980,"Motor units comprise a pre-synaptic motor neuron and multiple post-synaptic muscle fibers. Many movement disorders disrupt motor unit contractile dynamics and the structure of sarcomeres, skeletal muscle’s contractile units. Despite the motor unit’s centrality to neuromuscular physiology, no extant technology can image sarcomere twitch dynamics in live humans. We created a wearable microscope equipped with a microendoscope for minimally invasive observation of sarcomere lengths and contractile dynamics in any major skeletal muscle. By electrically stimulating twitches via the microendoscope and visualizing the sarcomere displacements, we monitored single motor unit contractions in soleus and vastus lateralis muscles of healthy individuals. Control experiments verified that these evoked twitches involved neuromuscular transmission and faithfully reported muscle force generation. In post-stroke patients with spasticity of the biceps brachii, we found involuntary microscopic contractions and sarcomere length abnormalities. The wearable microscope facilitates exploration of many basic and disease-related neuromuscular phenomena never visualized before in live humans.Video Abstracthttps://www.cell.com/cms/asset/9e5f070f-43a2-400a-a660-88430df87577/mmc3.mp4Loading ...(mp4, 24.31 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W2197282435,"It is now appreciated that the brain is immunologically active. Highly conserved innate immune signaling responds to pathogen invasion and injury and promotes structural refinement of neural circuitry. However, it remains generally unknown whether innate immune signaling has a function during the day-to-day regulation of neural function in the absence of pathogens and irrespective of cellular damage or developmental change. Here we show that an innate immune receptor, a member of the peptidoglycan pattern recognition receptor family (PGRP-LC), is required for the induction and sustained expression of homeostatic synaptic plasticity. This receptor functions presynaptically, controlling the homeostatic modulation of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles following inhibition of postsynaptic glutamate receptor function. Thus, PGRP-LC is a candidate receptor for retrograde, trans-synaptic signaling, a novel activity for innate immune signaling and the first known function of a PGRP-type receptor in the nervous system of any organism."

https://openalex.org/W2220896323,"Physical activity has been shown to suppress tumor initiation and progression. The neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) is closely related to movement and exhibits antitumor properties. However, whether the suppressive effects of physical activity on tumors was mediated by the nervous system via increased DA level remains unknowns. Here we show that regular moderate swimming (8 min/day, 9 weeks) raised DA levels in the prefrontal cortex, serum and tumor tissue, suppressed growth, reduced lung metastasis of transplanted liver cancer, and prolonged survival in a C57BL/6 mouse model, while overload swimming (16 and 32 min/day, 9 weeks) had the opposite effect. In nude mice that were orthotopically implanted with human liver cancer cell lines, DA treatment significantly suppressed growth and lung metastasis by acting on the D2 receptor (DR2). Furthermore, DR2 blockade attenuated the suppressive effect of moderate swimming on liver cancer. Both moderate swimming and DA treatment suppressed the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β1)-induced epithelial–mesenchymal transition of transplanted liver cancer cells. At the molecular level, DR2 signaling inhibited extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation and expression of TGF-β1 in vitro. Together, these findings demonstrated a novel mechanism by which the moderate exercise suppressed liver cancer through boosting DR2 activity, while overload exercise had the opposite effect, highlighting the possible importance of the dopaminergic system in tumor growth and metastasis of liver cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2273350314,"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most frequent soft tissue sarcoma in children that shares many features of developing skeletal muscle. TBX2, a T-box family member, is highly upregulated in tumor cells of both major RMS subtypes where it functions as an oncogene. TBX2 is a repressor that is often overexpressed in cancer cells and functions in bypassing cell growth control, including the repression of the cell cycle regulators p14 and p21. We have found that TBX2 directly represses the tumor-suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in both RMS and normal muscle. Exogenous expression of TBX2 in normal muscle cells downregulates PTEN, and depletion or interference with TBX2 in RMS cells upregulates PTEN. Human RMS tumors show high levels of TBX2 and correspondingly low levels of PTEN. The expression of PTEN in clinical RMS samples is relatively uncharacterized, and we establish that suppression of PTEN is a frequent event in both subtypes of RMS. TBX2 represses PTEN by directly binding to the promoter and recruiting the histone deacetylase, HDAC1. RMS cells have high levels of activated AKT owing to the deregulation of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) signaling, and depletion or interference with TBX2, which upregulates PTEN, results in a reduction of phospho-AKT. We have also found that the highly related T-box family member TBX3 does not repress PTEN in the muscle lineage. This work suggests that TBX2 is a central component of the PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway deregulation in RMS cells and that targeting TBX2 in RMS tumors may offer a novel therapeutic approach for RMS."
https://openalex.org/W2325020458,"Photosensitizers (PS) are ideally devoid of any activity in the absence of photoactivation, and rely on molecular oxygen for the formation of singlet oxygen ((1)O2) to produce cellular damage. Off-targets and tumor hypoxia therefore represent obstacles for the use of PS for cancer photodynamic therapy. Herein, we describe the characterization of OR141, a benzophenazine compound identified through a phenotypic screening for its capacity to be strictly activated by light and to kill a large variety of tumor cells under both normoxia and hypoxia. This new class of PS unraveled an unsuspected common mechanism of action for PS that involves the combined inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway and proteasomal deubiquitinases (DUBs) USP14 and UCH37. Oxidation of mTOR and other endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated proteins drives the early formation of high molecular weight (MW) complexes of multimeric proteins, the concomitant blockade of DUBs preventing their degradation and precipitating cell death. Furthermore, we validated the antitumor effects of OR141 in vivo and documented its highly selective accumulation in the ER, further increasing the ER stress resulting from (1)O2 generation upon light activation."
https://openalex.org/W2235193128,"Emerging evidence from The Cancer Genome Atlas has revealed that nuclear factor κB2 (nfκb2) gene encoding p100 is genetically deleted or mutated in human cancers, implicating NFκB2 as a potential tumor suppressor. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the antitumorigenic action of p100 remains poorly understood. Here we report that p100 inhibits cancer cell anchorage-independent growth, a hallmark of cellular malignancy, by stabilizing the tumor-suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) mRNA via a mechanism that is independent of p100’s inhibitory role in NFκB activation. We further demonstrate that the regulatory effect of p100 on PTEN expression is mediated by its downregulation of miR-494 as a result of the inactivation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase 2 (ERK2), in turn leading to inhibition of c-Jun/activator protein-1-dependent transcriptional activity. Furthermore, we identify that p100 specifically interacts with non-phosphorylated ERK2 and prevents ERK2 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Moreover, the death domain at C-terminal of p100 is identified as being crucial and sufficient for its interaction with ERK2. Taken together, our findings provide novel mechanistic insights into the understanding of the tumor-suppressive role for NFκB2 p100."
https://openalex.org/W2210006879,"During maximal contractions, the sum of forces exerted by homonymous muscles unilaterally is typically higher than the sum of forces exerted by the same muscles bilaterally. However, the underlying mechanism(s) of this phenomenon, which is known as the bilateral strength deficit, remain equivocal. One potential factor that has received minimal attention is the contribution of body adjustments to bilateral and unilateral force production. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the plantar-flexors in an innovative dynamometer that permitted the influence of torque from body adjustments to be adapted. Participants were identically positioned between two setup configurations where torques generated from body adjustments were included within the net ankle torque (locked-unit) or independent of the ankle (open-unit). Twenty healthy adult males performed unilateral and bilateral maximal voluntary isometric plantar-flexion contractions using the dynamometer in the open and locked-unit mechanical configurations. While there was a significant bilateral strength deficit in the locked-unit (p = 0.01), it was not evident in the open-unit (p = 0.07). In the locked-unit, unilateral torque was greater than in the open-unit (p<0.001) and this was due to an additional torque from the body since the electromyographic activity of the agonist muscles did not differ between the two setups (p>0.05). This study revealed that the mechanical configuration of the dynamometer and then the body adjustments caused the observation of a bilateral strength deficit."
https://openalex.org/W2220208090,"Arginylation is an emerging post-translational modification mediated by arginyltransferase (ATE1) that is essential for mammalian embryogenesis and regulation of the cytoskeleton. Here, we discovered that Ate1-knockout (KO) embryonic fibroblasts exhibit tumorigenic properties, including abnormally rapid contact-independent growth, reduced ability to form cell-cell contacts and chromosomal aberrations. Ate1-KO fibroblasts can form large colonies in Matrigel and exhibit invasive behavior, unlike wild-type fibroblasts. Furthermore, Ate1-KO cells form tumors in subcutaneous xenograft assays in immunocompromised mice. Abnormal growth in these cells can be partially rescued by reintroduction of stably expressed specific Ate1 isoforms, which also reduce the ability of these cells to form tumors. Tumor array studies and bioinformatics analysis show that Ate1 is downregulated in several types of human cancer samples at the protein level, and that its transcription level inversely correlates with metastatic progression and patient survival. We conclude that Ate1-KO results in carcinogenic transformation of cultured fibroblasts, suggesting that in addition to its previously known activities Ate1 gene is essential for tumor suppression and also likely participates in suppression of metastatic growth."
https://openalex.org/W2198764623,"Solar ultraviolet (UV) light is a major etiological factor in skin carcinogenesis, with solar UV-stimulated signal transduction inducing pathological changes and skin damage. The primary sensor of solar UV-induced cellular signaling has not been identified. We use an experimental system of solar simulated light (SSL) to mimic solar UV and we demonstrate that Fyn is a primary redox sensor involved in SSL-induced signal transduction. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by SSL exposure directly oxidize Cys488 of Fyn, resulting in increased Fyn kinase activity. Fyn oxidation was increased in mouse skin after SSL exposure and Fyn-knockout mice formed larger and more tumors compared with Fyn wild-type mice when exposed to SSL for an extended period of time. Murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking Fyn and cells in which Fyn expression was knocked down were resistant to SSL-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, cells expressing mutant Fyn (C448A) were resistant to SSL-induced apoptosis. These findings suggest that Fyn acts as a regulatory nexus between solar UV, ROS and signal transduction during skin carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2258964478,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a cell surface receptor that has an essential role in cell proliferation and survival, and overexpression of EGFR is a common feature of human cancers. In Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), activating mutations of EGFR have also been described. We recently showed that mutant EGFR-L858R inhibits the expression of the p14ARF tumor-suppressor protein to promote cell survival. In this study, we defined the molecular bases by which EGFR controls Arf expression. Using various lung tumor models, we showed that EGF stimulation inhibits Arf transcription by a mechanism involving the nuclear transport and recruitment of EGFR to the Arf promoter. We unraveled the vesicular trafficking protein Vps34 as a mediator of EGFR nuclear trafficking and showed that its neutralization prevents the accumulation of EGFR to the Arf promoter in response to ligand activation. Finally, in lung tumor cells that carry mutant EGFR-L858R, we demonstrated that inhibition of Vps34 using small interfering RNA restrains nuclear EGFR location and restores Arf expression leading to apoptosis. These findings identify the Arf tumor suppressor as a new transcriptional target of nuclear EGFR and highlight Vps34 as an important regulator of the nuclear EGFR/Arf survival pathway. As a whole, they provide a mechanistic explanation to the inverse correlation between nuclear expression of EGFR and overall survival in NSCLC patients."
https://openalex.org/W2311754547,"Due to the total and unexpected collapse of the Iceland scallop, Chlamys islandica, stocks around Iceland during the 2000s, a commercial fishing ban has been imposed on this valuable resource since 2003. Following the initial identification of an apicomplexan parasite in the scallops, a long-term surveillance program was established to evaluate the effect of the parasite on the population. The infections were highly prevalent in all shell sizes throughout the study. However, the parasite only impacts mature scallops where they cause severe macroscopic changes, characterized by an extensively diminished and abnormally coloured adductor muscle. A highly significant relationship was observed between infection intensity and gonad and adductor muscle indices. The first four years of the study, were characterized by high infection intensity and very poor condition of the adductor muscle and gonads, whilst during subsequent years, infections gradually decreased and the condition of the scallops improved. Histopathological changes were restricted to the presence of apicomplexan zoites which were widely distributed, causing varying degrees of pathology in all organs. In heavy infections, muscular and connective tissues were totally necrotized, destroying significant parts of numerous organs, especially the adductor muscle, digestive gland and gonads. The progression of the disease was in good synchrony with the mortality rates and the subsequent decline observed in the scallop stock and recruitment indices. Our findings strongly suggest that the apicomplexan parasite played a major role in the collapse of the Iceland scallop stock in Breidafjordur. In addition to causing mortality, the infections significantly impact gonad development which contributes further to the collapse of the stock in the form of lower larval recruitment. Furthermore, compelling evidence exists that this apicomplexan pathogen is causing serious disease outbreaks in other scallop populations. Similar abnormal adductor muscles and the parasite itself have been identified or observed in association with other mass mortality events in several different scallop species and commercial stocks in the northern hemisphere."

Although the RGC-5 cell line was initially thought to be of retinal ganglion cell origin, recent evidence suggests that the RGC-5 line could have been the result of contamination with 661W mouse cone photoreceptor cells. This raised the possibility that a cone photoreceptor cell line could be multipotent and could be differentiated to a neuronal phenotype.661W and RGC-5 cells, non-neuronal retinal astrocytes, retinal endothelial cells, retinal pericytes, M21 melanoma cells, K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells, and Daudi Burkitt lymphoma cells, were differentiated with staurosporine. The resulting morphology was quantitated using NeuronJ with respect to neurite counts and topology.Treatment with staurosporine induced similar-appearing morphological differentiation in both 661W and RGC-5 cells. The following measures were not significantly different between 661W and RGC-5 cells: number of neurites per cell, total neurite field length, number of neurite branch points, and cell viability. Neuronal-like differentiation was not observed in the other cell lines tested.661W and RGC-5 cells have virtually identical and distinctive morphology when differentiated with low concentrations of staurosporine. This result demonstrates that a retinal neuronal precursor cell with cone photoreceptor lineage can be differentiated to express a neuronal morphology."
https://openalex.org/W2206212608,"One in three hospital acute medical admissions is of an older person with cognitive impairment. Their outcomes are poor and the quality of their care in hospital has been criticised. A specialist unit to care for older people with delirium and dementia (the Medical and Mental Health Unit, MMHU) was developed and then tested in a randomised controlled trial where it delivered significantly higher quality of, and satisfaction with, care, but no significant benefits in terms of health status outcomes at three months.To examine the cost-effectiveness of the MMHU for older people with delirium and dementia in general hospitals, compared with standard care.Six hundred participants aged over 65 admitted for acute medical care, identified on admission as cognitively impaired, were randomised to the MMHU or to standard care on acute geriatric or general medical wards. Cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained, at 3-month follow-up, was assessed in trial-based economic evaluation (599/600 participants, intervention: 309). Multiple imputation and complete-case sample analyses were employed to deal with missing QALY data (55%).The total adjusted health and social care costs, including direct costs of the intervention, at 3 months was £7714 and £7862 for MMHU and standard care groups, respectively (difference -£149 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -298, 4)). The difference in QALYs gained was 0.001 (95% CI: -0.006, 0.008). The probability that the intervention was dominant was 58%, and the probability that it was cost-saving with QALY loss was 39%. At £20,000/QALY threshold, the probability of cost-effectiveness was 94%, falling to 59% when cost-saving QALY loss cases were excluded.The MMHU was strongly cost-effective using usual criteria, although considerably less so when the less acceptable situation with QALY loss and cost savings were excluded. Nevertheless, this model of care is worthy of further evaluation.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01136148."
https://openalex.org/W2219255763,"Testes-specific protease 50 (TSP50) is abnormally overexpressed in many kinds of cancers and promotes cell proliferation and migration. However, whether TSP50 can influence the tumor microenvironment, especially the function of immune cells in the microenvironment, remains largely unknown. We demonstrated that exposure to the conditioned medium from TSP50-overexpressing cells, or co-culture with TSP50-overexpressing cells, enhanced the cytokine production and phagocytic activities of macrophages, and induced M2b polarization. Further investigation showed that production of TNF-α and IL-1β was strongly induced by TSP50 in TSP50-overexpressing cells. TSP50-induced TNF-α and IL-1β were main factors that mediated the effects of TSP50-overexpressing cells on macrophages. The NF-κB pathway could be activated in macrophages upon the treatment of conditioned medium of TSP50-overexpressing cells and its activation is necessary for the observed effects on macrophages. Taken together, our results suggested that oncogenic TSP50 expressed in cells could activate surrounding macrophages and induce M2b polarization, partly through inducing TNF-α/ IL-1β secretion and subsequent NF-κB pathway activation. This implies a potential mechanism by which oncogene TSP50 regulates tumor microenvironment to support tumor development."

However, little attention has been given to the immunological profile of patients under distinct HAART regimens. This work aimed to investigate the differences in the immunological pattern of HIV-1+ patients under the first- or second-line HAART in Brazil.CD4+ T cell counts, Viral load, and plasma concentration of sCD14, sCD163, MCP-1, RANTES, IP-10, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-12, IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 were assessed for immunological characterization of the following clinical groups: Non-infected individuals (NI; n = 66), HIV-1+ untreated (HIV; n = 46), HIV-1+ treated with first-line HAART (HAART 1; n = 15); and HIV-1+ treated with second-line HAART (HAART 2; n = 15).We found that the immunological biosignature pattern of HAART 1 is similar to that of NI individuals, especially in patients presenting slow progression of the disease, while patients under HAART 2 remain in a moderate inflammatory state, which is similar to that of untreated HIV patients pattern. Network correlations revealed that differences in IP-10, TNF-α, IL-6, IFN-α, and IL-10 interactions were primordial in HIV disease and treatment. Heat map and decision tree analysis identified that IP-10>TNF-α>IFN-α were the best respective HAART segregation biomarkers.HIV patients in different HAART regimens develop distinct immunological biosignature, introducing a novel perspective into disease outcome and potential new therapies that consider HAART patients as a heterogeneous group."
https://openalex.org/W2207538520,"In mice, trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) are interspersed in the olfactory epithelium and constitute a chemosensory subsystem that is highly specific for detecting volatile amines. Humans possess six putative functional TAAR genes. Human TAAR5 (hTAAR5) is highly expressed in the olfactory mucosa and was shown to be specifically activated by trimethylamine. In this study, we were challenged to uncover an effective blocker substance for trimethylamine-induced hTAAR5 activation. To monitor blocking effects, we recombinantly expressed hTAAR5 and employed a commonly used Cre-luciferase reporter gene assay. Among all tested potential blocker substances, Timberol®, an amber-woody fragrance, is able to inhibit the trimethylamine-induced hTAAR5 activation up to 96%. Moreover, human psychophysical data showed that the presence of Timberol® increases the olfactory detection threshold for the characteristic fishy odor of trimethylamine by almost one order of magnitude. In conclusion, our results show that among tested receptors Timberol® is a specific and potent antagonist for the hTAAR5-mediated response to trimethylamine in a heterologous system. Furthermore, our data concerning the observed shift of the olfactory detection threshold in vivo implicate that hTAAR5 or other receptors that may be inhibited by Timberol® could be involved in the high affinity olfactory perception of trimethylamine in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2236340583,"Mammary stem cells (MSCs) expansion is associated with aggressive human breast cancer. The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is a breast cancer tumor suppressor, but the mechanisms of this suppression are not completely characterized. To determine whether PPARγ regulates MSC expansion in mammary cancer, we deleted PPARγ expression in the mammary epithelium of an in vivo model of basal breast cancer. Loss of PPARγ expression reduced tumor latency, and expanded the CD24+/CD49f(hi) MSC population. PPARγ-null mammary tumors exhibited increased angiogenesis, which was detected in human breast cancer. In vivo inhibition of a PPARγ-regulated miR-15a/angiopoietin-1 pathway blocked increased angiogenesis and MSC expansion. PPARγ bound and activated a canonical response element in the miR-15a gene. PPARγ-null tumors were sensitive to the targeted anti-angiogenic drug sunitinib but resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Normalization of tumor vasculature with sunitinib resulted in objective response to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Chemotherapy-treated PPARγ-null mammary tumors exhibited luminal phenotype and expansion of unipotent CD61+ luminal progenitor cells. Transplantation of chemotherapy-treated luminal progenitor cells recapitulated the luminal phenotype. These results have important implications for anti-angiogenic therapy in breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2221901310,"Amplification of genes at 13q34 has been reported to be associated with tumor proliferation and progression in diverse types of cancers. However, its role in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) has yet to be explored. We examined two iCCA cell lines and 86 cases of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma to analyze copy number of three target genes, including cullin 4A (CUL4A), insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2), and transcription factor Dp-1 (TFDP1) at 13q34 by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The cell lines and all tumor samples were used to test the relationship between copy number (CN) alterations and protein expression by western blotting and immunohistochemical assays, respectively. IRS2 was introduced, and each target gene was silenced in cell lines. The mobility potential of cells was compared in the basal condition and after manipulation using cell migration and invasion assays. CN alterations correlated with protein expression levels. The SNU1079 cell line containing deletions of the target genes demonstrated decreased protein expression levels and significantly lower numbers of migratory and invasive cells, as opposed to the RBE cell line, which does not contain CN alterations. Overexpression of IRS2 by introducing IRS2 in SUN1079 cells increased the mobility potential. In contrast, silencing each target gene showed a trend or statistical significance toward inhibition of migratory and invasive capacities in RBE cells. In tumor samples, the amplification of each of these genes was associated with poor disease-free survival. Twelve cases (13.9%) demonstrated copy numbers > 4 for all three genes tested (CUL4A, IRS2, and TFDP1), and showed a significant difference in disease-free survival by both univariate and multivariate survival analyses (hazard ratio, 2.69; 95% confidence interval, 1.23 to 5.88; P = 0.013). Our data demonstrate that amplification of genes at 13q34 plays an oncogenic role in iCCA featuring adverse disease-free survival, which may provide new directions for targeted therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2211770535,"Background Mental and body weight disorders are among the major global health challenges, and their comorbidity may play an important role in treatment and prevention of both pathologies. A growing number of studies have examined the relationship between psychiatric status and body weight, but our knowledge is still limited. Objective The present study aims to investigate the cross-sectional relationships of psychiatric status and body mass index (BMI) in Málaga, a Mediterranean city in the South of Spain. Materials and Methods A total of 563 participants were recruited from those who came to his primary care physician, using a systematic random sampling, non-proportional stratified by BMI categories. Structured clinical interviews were used to assess current Axes-I and II mental disorders according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR). BMI was calculated as weight (Kg) divided by square of height in meters (m2). Logistic regression was used to investigate the association between BMI and the presence of any mental disorder. BMI was introduced in the models using restricted cubic splines. Results We found that high BMI values were directly associated with mood and adjustment disorders, and low BMI values were directly associated with avoidant and dependent personality disorders (PDs). We observed an inverse relationship between low BMI values and cluster A PDs. There were not significant relationships between anxiety or substance-related disorders and BMI. Conclusion Psychiatric status and BMI are related in a Mediterranean Spanish population. A multidisciplinary approach to both pathologies becomes increasingly more necessary."
