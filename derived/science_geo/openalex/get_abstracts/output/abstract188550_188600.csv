https://openalex.org/W2001923529,"Reactive oxygen species are involved in many cellular metabolic and signalling processes and are thought to have a role in disease, particularly in carcinogenesis and ageing. We have generated mice with targeted inactivation of Prdx1, a member of the peroxiredoxin family of antioxidant enzymes. Here we show that mice lacking Prdx1 are viable and fertile but have a shortened lifespan owing to the development beginning at about 9 months of severe haemolytic anaemia and several malignant cancers, both of which are also observed at increased frequency in heterozygotes. The haemolytic anaemia is characterized by an increase in erythrocyte reactive oxygen species, leading to protein oxidation, haemoglobin instability, Heinz body formation and decreased erythrocyte lifespan. The malignancies include lymphomas, sarcomas and carcinomas, and are frequently associated with loss of Prdx1 expression in heterozygotes, which suggests that this protein functions as a tumour suppressor. Prdx1-deficient fibroblasts show decreased proliferation and increased sensitivity to oxidative DNA damage, whereas Prdx1-null mice have abnormalities in numbers, phenotype and function of natural killer cells. Our results implicate Prdx1 as an important defence against oxidants in ageing mice."
https://openalex.org/W1969049648,"The point at absolute zero where matter becomes unstable to new forms of order is called a quantum critical point (QCP). The quantum fluctuations between order and disorder1,2,3,4,5 that develop at this point induce profound transformations in the finite temperature electronic properties of the material. Magnetic fields are ideal for tuning a material as close as possible to a QCP, where the most intense effects of criticality can be studied. A previous study6 on the heavy-electron material YbRh2Si2 found that near a field-induced QCP electrons move ever more slowly and scatter off one another with ever increasing probability, as indicated by a divergence to infinity of the electron effective mass and scattering cross-section. But these studies could not shed light on whether these properties were an artefact of the applied field7,8, or a more general feature of field-free QCPs. Here we report that, when germanium-doped YbRh2Si2 is tuned away from a chemically induced QCP by magnetic fields, there is a universal behaviour in the temperature dependence of the specific heat and resistivity: the characteristic kinetic energy of electrons is directly proportional to the strength of the applied field. We infer that all ballistic motion of electrons vanishes at a QCP, forming a new class of conductor in which individual electrons decay into collective current-carrying motions of the electron fluid."

https://openalex.org/W2077827642,"In this study we addressed the role of sphingolipid metabolism in the inflammatory response. In a L929 fibroblast model, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) induced prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production by 4 h and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) induction as early as 2 h. This TNF-induced PGE2 production was inhibited by NS398, a COX-2 selective inhibitor. GC-MS analysis revealed that only COX-2-generated prostanoids were produced in response to TNF, thus providing further evidence of COX-2 selectivity. As sphingolipids have been implicated in mediating several actions of TNF, their role in COX-2 induction and PGE2 production was evaluated. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) induced both COX-2 and PGE2 in a dose-responsive manner with an apparent ED50 of 100-300 nM. The related sphingolipid sphingosine also induced PGE2, though with much less efficacy. TNF induced a 3.5-fold increase in sphingosine-1-phosphate levels at 10 min that rapidly returned to baseline by 40 min. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) directed against mouse SK1 decreased (typically by 80%) SK1 protein and inhibited TNF-induced SK activity. Treatment of cells with RNAi to SK1 but not SK2 almost completely abolished the ability of TNF to induce COX-2 or generate PGE2. By contrast, cells treated with RNAi to S1P lyase or S1P phosphatase enhanced COX-2 induction leading to enhanced generation of PGE2. Treatment with SK1 RNAi also abolished the effects of exogenous sphingosine and ceramide on PGE2, revealing that the action of sphingosine and ceramide are due to intracellular metabolism into S1P. Collectively, these results provide novel evidence that SK1 and S1P are necessary for TNF to induce COX-2 and PGE2 production. Based on these findings, this study indicates that SK1 and S1P could be implicated in pathological inflammatory disorders and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2227891475,"The microscopic origin of superconductivity in the high-transition-temperature (high-T(c)) copper oxides remains the subject of active inquiry; several of their electronic characteristics are well established as universal to all the known materials, forming the experimental foundation that all theories must address. The most fundamental of those characteristics, for both the copper oxides and other superconductors, is the dependence of the superconducting T(c) on the degree of electronic band filling. The recent report of superconductivity near 4 K in the layered sodium cobalt oxyhydrate, Na(0.35)CoO2*1.3H2O, is of interest owing to both its triangular cobalt-oxygen lattice and its generally analogous chemical and structural relationships to the copper oxide superconductors. Here we show that the superconducting T(c) of this compound displays the same kind of behaviour on chemical doping that is observed in the high-T(c) copper oxides. Specifically, the optimal superconducting T(c) occurs in a narrow range of sodium concentrations (and therefore electron concentrations) and decreases for both underdoped and overdoped materials, as observed in the phase diagram of the copper oxide superconductors. The analogy is not perfect, however, suggesting that Na(x)CoO2*1.3H2O, with its triangular lattice geometry and special magnetic characteristics, may provide insights into systems where coupled charge and spin dynamics play an essential role in leading to superconductivity."

https://openalex.org/W2045128403,"The BRCA1 tumor suppressor forms a heterodimer with the BARD1 protein, and the resulting complex functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that catalyzes the synthesis of polyubiquitin chains. In theory, polyubiquitination can occur by isopeptide bond formation at any of the seven lysine residues of ubiquitin. The isopeptide linkage of a polyubiquitin chain is a particularly important determinant of its cellular function, such that K48-linked chains commonly target proteins for proteasomal degradation, while K63 chains serve non-proteolytic roles in various signaling pathways. To determine the isopeptide linkage formed by BRCA1/BARD1-dependent polyubiquitination, we purified a full-length heterodimeric complex and compared its linkage specificity with that of E6-AP, an E3 ligase known to induce proteolysis of its cellular substrates. Using a comprehensive mutation analysis, we found that E6-AP catalyzes the synthesis of K48-linked polyubiquitin chains. In contrast, however, the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer directs polymerization of ubiquitin primarily through an unconventional linkage involving lysine residue K6. Although heterologous substrates of BRCA1/BARD1 are not known, BRCA1 autoubiquitination occurs principally by conjugation with K6-linked polymers. The ability of BRCA1/BARD1 to form K6-linked polyubiquitin chains suggests that it may impart unique cellular properties to its natural enzymatic substrates."

https://openalex.org/W2043965285,"The matrix components responsible for cartilage mechanical properties, type II collagen and aggrecan, are degraded in osteoarthritis through proteolytic cleavage by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and aggrecanases, respectively. We now show that aggrecan may serve to protect cartilage collagen from degradation. Although collagen in freeze-thawed cartilage depleted of aggrecan was completely degraded following incubation with MMP-1, collagen in cartilage with intact aggrecan was not. Using interleukin-1-stimulated bovine nasal cartilage explants where aggrecan depletion occurs during the first week of culture, followed by collagen loss during the second week, we evaluated the effect of selective MMP and aggrecanase inhibitors on degradation. A selective MMP inhibitor did not block aggrecan degradation but caused complete inhibition of collagen breakdown. Similar inhibition was seen with inhibitor addition following aggrecan depletion on day 6–8, suggesting that MMPs are not causing significant collagen degradation prior to the second week of culture. Inclusion of a selective aggrecanase inhibitor blocked aggrecan degradation, and, in addition, inhibited collagen degradation. When the inhibitor was introduced following aggrecan depletion, it had no effect on collagen breakdown, ruling out a direct effect through inhibition of collagenase. These data suggest that aggrecan plays a protective role in preventing degradation of collagen fibrils, and that an aggrecanase inhibitor may impart overall cartilage protection.

These data suggest that aggrecan plays a protective role in preventing degradation of collagen fibrils, and that an aggrecanase inhibitor may impart overall cartilage protection. Cartilage plays a critical role in joint function, where it acts as a shock absorber during joint loading and motion. The extracellular matrix molecules, type II collagen and aggrecan, provide the properties that enable the cartilage to serve this shock-absorbing function. Type II collagen is present as triple helical fibrils that provide cartilage with its structure and tensile strength (3Maroudas A.I. Nature. 1976; 260: 808-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Aggrecan monomers consist of a core protein with three globular domains. The amino-terminal region contains two of these globular domains, G1 and G2, separated by an interglobular domain. The G2 is followed by a long region along which are attached the sulfated glycosaminoglycan side chains, keratan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate and by the C-terminal globular domain, G3 (4Hardingham T.E. Fosang A.J. J. Rheumatol. Suppl. 1995; 43: 86-90PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple aggrecan monomers bind to hyaluronan through their G1 domains to form huge aggregates that are trapped within the collagen network. Because of their high negative charge and water-binding capacity, the aggrecan molecules provide the mechanical properties of compressibility and elasticity to the cartilage. The mechanical properties of the matrix as a whole depend on both major components and their stabilization by intermolecular interactions. The ability of the cartilage to withstand mechanical stress, therefore, is dependent upon its structural integrity and upon the various interactions between the matrix components.Cartilage degradation leading to a loss of joint function in osteoarthritis involves proteolytic cleavage of both aggrecan and collagen. Temporally, aggrecan is one of the first extracellular matrix components to undergo measurable loss in arthritic diseases (5Mankin H.J. Lippiello L. J. Bone Joint Surg. Am. 1970; 52: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Indeed, there are several lines of indirect evidence suggesting that the presence of aggrecan may serve to protect type II collagen molecules from proteolytic degradation. In cartilage explant cultures stimulated to undergo matrix degradation with cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), 1The abbreviations used are: IL-1, interleukin-1; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; ADAMTS, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs.1The abbreviations used are: IL-1, interleukin-1; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; ADAMTS, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs. the aggrecan is degraded early, during the first week of culture, whereas the collagen is not rapidly degraded until later in the culture period when essentially all of the aggrecan has been lost (7Ellis A.J. Curry V.A. Powell E.K. Cawston T.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 94-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 8Kozaci L.D. Buttle D.J. Hollander A.P. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Histological staining of cartilage from osteoarthritic joints indicates aggrecan loss occurs prior to loss of collagen, and in all areas where collagen loss or damage is seen, the staining for aggrecan staining is depleted (6Hollander A.P. Pidoux I. Reiner A. Rorabeck C. Bourne R. Poole A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The loss of aggrecan, which in normal cartilage prevents the diffusion of large molecular weight molecules into the cartilage matrix, may allow an increased diffusion of cytokines and proteases from the synovial fluid into the cartilage tissue leading to further cartilage erosion. With the loss of aggrecan, the collagen fibrils are no longer well supported and can undergo mechanical damage. Finally, studies have shown an interaction between type II collagen and aggrecan molecules (9Hedlund H. Hedbom E. Heineg r.D. Mengarelli-Widholm S. Reinholt F.P. Svensson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5777-5781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and scanning electron microscopy shows aggrecan coating the collagen fibers. Thus, it could be envisioned that aggrecan physically prevents protease access to the collagen molecules raising the question of whether aggrecan serves to protect collagen from degradation, and conversely whether collagen degradation could be prevented by retention of cartilage aggrecan.Although type II collagen and aggrecan are both degraded in osteoarthritis by proteolytic cleavage, different proteases are responsible. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are thought to be responsible for type II collagen cleavage (10Vincenti M.P. Clark I.M. Brinckerhoff C.E.

This was evaluated by 1) comparing the ability of collagenase to degrade collagen in cartilage with normal aggrecan content or in aggrecan-depleted cartilage, and 2) by determining the ability of selective aggrecanase inhibitors devoid of collagenase inhibitory activity to block both aggrecan and type II collagen breakdown and release in cartilage explants.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal calf serum, trypsin, and penicillin/streptomycin were purchased from Invitrogen.

Me2SO alone at the highest final concentration used had no effect on the parameters tested. The compounds were evaluated against a semi-purified preparation of aggrecanase from IL-1-stimulated bovine nasal cartilage conditioned media (15Arner E.C. Hughes C.E. Decicco C.P. Caterson B.

IC50 values were determined against a bovine aggrecan monomer substrate and were based on the inhibition of aggrecan fragment generation that possessed an N terminus of “ARGS.”Preparation of Bovine Nasal Cartilage Explants—Cartilage was prepared from the nasal septum of mature steer (> 9 months of age) at the time of slaughter. Uniform cartilage disks were prepared from the nasal septum by Covance Research Products (Denver, PA) as previously described (16Arner E.C. Pratta M.A. Decicco C.P. Xue C.B. Newton R.C. Trzaskos J.M. Magolda R.L. Tortorella M.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 878: 92-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Digestion of Collagen in Freeze-thawed Cartilage Explants—Cartilage disks were frozen and thawed 3 times to render the chondrocytes non-viable and used as a substrate for enzymatic digestion. Each disk was cut into quarters and paired pieces from the same disk used for various treatments. Cartilage pieces were incubated 16 h with trypsin (5 μg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline to deplete the matrix aggrecan or with buffer alone as a control (data not shown). At the end of the incubation 5% fetal calf serum was added for 60 min to inactivate the trypsin, and the disks were washed 4× with phosphate-buffered saline. Aggrecan-depleted cartilage and control cartilage pieces that contained a normal aggrecan matrix were incubated with 500 nm full-length MMP-1 or in buffer alone and the matrix integrity assessed visually after 24 h.Cartilage Cultures—Bovine nasal cartilage disks were sliced into eighths and cultured as previously described (20Arner E.C. Pratta M.A. Arthritis Rheum. 1989; 32: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, each slice was weighed and placed into a well of a 96-well plate in a total volume of 180 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum and 1× antibiotic/antimycotic (Invitrogen) and equilibrated for at least 3 days prior to treatment. Cartilage was stimulated with IL-1 in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1× antibiotic/antimycotic in the absence or presence of inhibitors. Culture media were removed for analysis and replaced with fresh treatments every two to 3 days.Aggrecan Degradation—Aggrecan degradation was monitored by assessing sulfated glycosaminoglycan released into the media using the dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) dye assay with shark chondroitin sulfate as a standard (21Farndale R.W. Sayers C.A. Barrett A.J. Connect. Tissue Res. 1982; 9: 247-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). Aggrecan content of the cartilage was determined following digestion of the tissue with papain for 24 h at 65 °C as previously described (20Arner E.C. Pratta M.A. Arthritis Rheum. 1989; 32: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).Collagen Degradation—Collagen degradation products were assayed in the media or in the papain digest of the cartilage using a hydroxyproline assay (22Creemers L.B. Jansen D.C. Van Veen-Reurings A. Van den Bos T. Everts V. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 656-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Fifty microliters of cell culture media or 10 μl of cartilage digest were hydrolyzed with 50 μl 12N HCl for 18 h at 100 °C. The hydrolysate was then dried in a vacuum desicator over NaOH pellets. The residue was dissolved in water (150 μl), transferred to a 96-well plate, and dried in a chemical hood. Sixty microliters of water was then added to each well followed by 20 μl of assay buffer (1-propanol/water/pH 6 buffer; 3:2:10 ratio). The pH 6 buffer consisted of 0.24 m citric acid, 0.88 m anhydrous sodium acetate trihydrate, 0.88 m anhydrous sodium acetate, 0.21 m acetic acid, 0.85 m sodium hydroxide, pH 6. The solution was allowed to shake until the residue was fully solubilized. Forty microliters of chloramine T reagent (0.282 g of chloramine T, 1 ml of water, 8 ml of pH 6 buffer, 1 ml of 1-propanol) was then added, and the samples were allowed to shake for 15 min at room temperature. Eighty microliters of DMBA reagent (2 g of dimethylaminobenzaldehyde, 1.25 ml of 1-propanol, 2.75 ml of perchloric acid) was added, and the plate was incubated on a shaker for 20 min at 70 °C. After the plate was allowed to cool, absorbances were determined at 570 nm on a Molecular Devices Thermomax microplate reader. Data were converted to nanograms of hydroxyproline based on a standard curve that consisted of hydroxyproline levels ranging from 20–2000 ng/well.Evaluation of Denatured Collagen—Denatured type II collagen fragments retained within the tissue were removed as previously described by digesting the tissue with chymotrypsin (23Hollander A.P. Heathfield T.F. Webber C. Iwata Y. Bourne R. Rorabeck C. Poole A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1722-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) and then assayed using the hydroxyproline assay described above.Statistical Analysis—Significant differences between groups were tested by Duncan's multiple range test when analysis of variance was significant (p < 0.05). Values shown are mean ± S.E. for glycosaminoglycan release (n = 8); mean ± S.D. for hydroxyproline levels (n = 3).RESULTSCollagenase Digestion of Cartilage—To determine whether the presence of aggrecan matrix affects the ability of collagenase to degrade cartilage collagen, freeze-thawed bovine nasal cartilage explants were treated with trypsin (5 μg/ml) for 16 h to deplete the aggrecan content of the tissue. In a preliminary experiment, analysis of the aggrecan content in cartilage treated with trypsin under these conditions resulted in aggrecan depletion (data not shown). However, the cartilage was visually unchanged and appeared hard and white like the native cartilage not treated with trypsin. Incubation of aggrecan-depleted cartilage with MMP-1 (500 nm) for 24 h resulted in complete breakdown of the cartilage matrix to a gelatinous mass (Fig. 2). Under these same conditions, MMP-1 treatment of cartilage with an intact aggrecan matrix resulted in minimal changes of the cartilage matrix. These data suggest that the aggrecan matrix provides protection to the collagen fibrils from enzymatic cleavage.Fig. 2Presence of aggrecan protects collagen from collagenase digestion. Paired pieces of freeze-thawed bovine nasal cartilage were incubated for 16 h with 5 μg/ml trypsin (A) to deplete aggrecan content of the tissue or with buffer (B) as an intact aggrecan control. Both slices were then incubated with 500 nm full-length human MMP-1 for 24 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Time Course of IL-1-stimulated Aggrecan and Collagen Degradation—Bovine nasal cartilage was incubated with IL-1 for 20 days, and media were removed and replaced with fresh treatments every 2–3 days. Media were assessed for aggrecan and collagen degradation products (Fig. 3). Aggrecan degradation products were released into the media by day 2 and 4 following IL-1 stimulation, with media glycosaminoglycan levels decreasing by day 6 and 8, suggesting depletion of aggrecan from the cartilage. In separate studies, assessment of cartilage digests indicated that aggrecan content of the tissue was depleted following 6–8 days of IL-1 exposure (24Arner E.C. Pratta M.A. Trzaskos J.M.

Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), collagen degradation occurred following the depletion of aggrecan. No detectable hydroxyproline levels were present in media at day 10, but increased levels were detected at day 12 and peaked by day 17.Fig. 3Time course of IL-1-induced aggrecan and collagen degradation in bovine nasal cartilage. Bovine nasal cartilage was incubated in media without (open symbols) or with IL-1 (20 ng/ml) (solid symbols) for 20 days. Media were removed for analysis and replaced with fresh treatments every 2–3 days. Media were assessed for aggrecan and collagen degradation products as described in “Experimental Procedures.” Aggrecan degradation (squares) is reported as μg glycosaminoglycan (GAG) per mg wet weight cartilage, and collagen degradation (circles) is reported as μg hydroxyproline (HP) per mg wet weight cartilage.

This compound has been shown to inhibit a variety of MMPs with Ki values in the nanomolar range, but is ineffective in inhibiting aggrecanase, with an IC50 of >10 μm (Table I) (24Arner E.C.

XS309 was evaluated for its ability to block IL-1-stimulated aggrecan and collagen degradation monitored on day 4 and day 14, respectively, based on results of time course studies above. Inclusion of XS309 (10 μm) with IL-1 from time 0 had no effect on IL-1-stimulated aggrecan degradation (Fig. 4A), consistent with previous work suggesting that metalloproteinases are not involved in aggrecan degradation (17Gazzinelli R.T.

However, consistent with the involvement of MMPs in type II collagen degradation, XS309 effectively blocked IL-1-induced collagen degradation in the same cultures at day 14 (Fig. 4B). A recent (27Yasuda T. Poole A.R. Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 138-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) report suggests that collagen degradation in this model is mediated by collagenase-3 (MMP-13) based on inhibition by a selective inhibitor of this enzyme. The fact that XS309 is an effective inhibitor of MMP-13 is consistent with the published observations using the selective MMP-13 inhibitor.Fig. 4Effect of an MMP inhibitor on matrix degradation. Bovine nasal cartilage explants were incubated without or with IL-1 (20 ng/ml) for 14 days with or without the MMP inhibitor, XS309 (10 μm), added either on day 0 at the time of IL-1 addition or at day 6 following depletion of aggrecan by IL-1.

J. 1997; 323: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) there is no evidence to suggest that significant collagen degradation occurs prior to aggrecan depletion in this system. The temporal relationship between aggrecan and collagen degradation, therefore, suggests that it should be unnecessary for an MMP inhibitor to be present prior to aggrecan depletion to be effective in blocking collagen degradation. To test this hypothesis, we incubated cartilage for 6 days with IL-1 in the absence of XS309, and then added the inhibitor with IL-1 from day 6 through day 14. XS309 was equally effective in blocking collagen degradation when added 6 days after IL-1 treatment versus addition at time 0 (Fig. 4B). A similar observation was made when the compound was added 8 days after IL-1 treatment commenced (data not shown). These data suggest that there is no significant level of collagen degradation by MMPs occurring in response to IL-1 treatment prior to degradation and depletion of the aggrecan matrix.Effect of Aggrecanase Inhibition on Aggrecan and Collagen Degradation—The contribution of aggrecanase to the degradation of the cartilage matrix was investigated using a selective aggrecanase inhibitor, ST109 (18Yao W.

This compound inhibits aggrecanase with submicromolar potency but is inactive against a panel of MMPs including MMP-13 at concentrations up to 5 μm (Table I). The compound was added with IL-1 at time 0, and the effect on aggrecan and collagen degradation was monitored on day 4 and day 14, respectively (Fig. 5). IL-1 caused an increase in aggrecan degradation that was effectively blocked by the aggrecanase inhibitor, suggesting that aggrecan degradation induced by IL-1 is mediated by aggrecanase (Fig. 5A). In addition, the aggrecanase inhibitor caused a significant inhibition in IL-1-induced collagen degradation (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that retention of aggrecan by an aggrecanase inhibitor may be effective in protecting type II collagen as well.Fig. 5Effect of an aggrecanase inhibitor on matrix degradation. Bovine nasal cartilage explants were incubated without or with IL-1 (20 ng/ml) for 14 days with or without the aggrecanase inhibitor, ST109 (10 μm), added either on day 0 at the time of IL-1 addition or at day 6 following depletion of aggrecan by IL-1.

https://openalex.org/W2122511750,"The mammalian E2F family of transcription factors plays a crucial role in the regulation of cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. Consistent with its biological role in a number of important cellular processes, E2F regulates the expression of genes involved in cell cycle, DNA replication, DNA repair, and mitosis. It has proven difficult, however, to determine the specific roles played by the various known family members in these cellular processes. The work presented here now extends the complexity of this family even further by the identification of a novel E2F family member, which we now term E2F7. Like the expression of the known E2F activators, E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3, the expression of E2F7 is growth-regulated, at least in part, through E2F binding elements on its promoter, and its protein product is localized to the nucleus and associates with DNA E2F recognition sites with high affinity. A number of salient features, however, make this member unique among the E2F family. First, the E2F7 gene encodes a protein that possesses two distinct DNA-binding domains and that lacks a dimerization domain as well as a transcriptional activation and a retinoblastoma-binding domain. In contrast to the E2F activators, E2F7 can block the E2F-dependent activation of a subset of E2F target genes as well as mitigate cellular proliferation of mouse embryo fibroblasts. These findings identify E2F7 as a novel member of the mammalian E2F transcription factor family that has properties of a transcriptional repressor capable of negatively influencing cellular proliferation.

Studies using tissue culture and in vivo mouse models have led to the identification of the E2F transcription factor family as an important effector of Rb function impacting cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cellular differentiation. From these studies, a paradigm for Rb action in the control of cellular proliferation has emerged. In this view, cyclin-dependent kinase activation results in the phosphorylation of Rb and the release of E2F family members from Rb-containing complexes, leading to E2F target activation and cell cycle progression (1Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar, 2Nevins J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar, 3Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). The regulation of E2F activities is not solely due to the action of Rb but is also subject to control at multiple tiers involving new synthesis, localization, phosphorylation, acetylation, and degradation (2Nevins J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar, 3Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). The E2F proteins and their heterodimeric DP partners, encoded by eight distinct genes, contain an evolutionary conserved DNA-binding and dimerization domain and, at least for E2F1–5, a conserved transactivation and pocket protein-binding domain. Although heterodimerization with DP proteins is required for E2F DNA binding activity, the specificity of the heterodimer complex is mediated by the E2F subunit (1Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar). Both structural and functional properties have separated the E2F family members into three subclasses. The expression of E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3a, which represent the first subclass, oscillates during the cell cycle, peaks late in G1, and coincides with the activation of G1/S-specific genes (4Leone G. DeGregori J. Yan Z. Jakoi L. Ishida S. Williams R.S. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2120-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). During this period, E2F1–3a can be found transiently bound to many E2F target promoters (5Cam H. Dynlacht B.D. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 311-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Consistent with an important role for these proteins in cellular proliferation, the combined disruption of E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) impedes E2F-target expression and cellular proliferation, indicating that these E2Fs may function as transcriptional activators (6Wu L. Timmers C. Maiti B. Saavedra H.I. Sang L. Chong G.T. Nuckolls F. Giangrande P. Wright F.A. Field S.J. Greenberg M.E. Orkin S. Nevins J.R. Robinson M.L. Leone G. Nature. 2001; 414: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In contrast to the E2F activators, the expression of the second E2F subclass composed of E2F3b, E2F4, and E2F5 appears relatively constant in relation to cell growth (4Leone G. DeGregori J. Yan Z. Jakoi L. Ishida S. Williams R.S. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2120-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Several studies have implicated the second E2F subclass in transcriptional repression by recruiting the pocket proteins Rb, p107, and p130 and their associated histone-modifying enzymes to E2F target gene promoters (3Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). E2F6, the only member of the third subclass, contains domains for DNA binding and dimerization but lacks residues for pocket protein binding or transactivation. Instead, E2F6 is thought to mediate repression either through its direct binding to polycomb group proteins or through the formation of a large multimeric complex containing Mga and Max proteins (7Ogawa H. Ishiguro K. Gaubatz S. Livingston D.M. Nakatani Y. Science. 2002; 296: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 8Trimarchi J.M. Fairchild B. Wen J. Lees J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1519-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The function of E2Fs in regulating cellular proliferation and differentiation has been also investigated in nonmammalian species. Of these, Drosophila melanogaster is the most extensively studied organism, containing at least two E2F genes (dE2F1–2) and one DP gene (dDP). In many ways, dE2F1 appears to be a homolog of the mammalian E2F activator subclass, whereas dE2F2 resembles members of the mammalian repressor subclass (9Stevaux O. Dimova D. Frolov M.V. Taylor-Harding B. Morris E. Dyson N. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4927-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). E2F related activities have also been described in Caenorhabditis elegans and Xenopus laevis but have not been found in yeast (10Ceol C.J. Horvitz H.R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 461-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 11Suzuki A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 217-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains six E2F genes (AtE2Fa–e) and two DP genes (AtDPa and AtDPb). Similar to their mammalian E2F1–3 counterparts, AtE2Fa–c proteins can transactivate E2F targets and are equipped with conserved residues for DNA binding, dimerization, transactivation, and pocket protein binding (12Mariconti L. Pellegrini B. Cantoni R. Stevens R. Bergounioux C. Cella R. Albani D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9911-9919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 13Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16553-16558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). On the other hand, AtE2Fd–f diverge from the mammalian E2F3b-6 repressors, because they possess two DNA-binding domains (DBD) and lack any of the other conserved regions necessary for E2F-dependent repression (12Mariconti L. Pellegrini B. Cantoni R. Stevens R. Bergounioux C. Cella R. Albani D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9911-9919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 13Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16553-16558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Comparative analysis of the protein sequences between the human, mouse, fly, nematode, and A. thaliana genomes revealed that the DBD of the E2F proteins is highly conserved. We therefore used the mouse E2F3 DNA-binding amino acid sequence as bait to identify additional putative E2F family members within the recently completed mouse and human genome. We identified a new putative mammalian E2F, which we now designate as E2F7. The salient feature of this member is that it contains two tandem DBDs that are highly related to the DBDs of all other E2Fs and thus has a similar structural organization as AtE2Fd–f from plants. In contrast to most known mammalian E2Fs, this novel member lacks the residues necessary for dimerization, transactivation, and pocket protein binding. We show that this protein can bind to E2F DNA-binding consensus sites, can act as a transcriptional repressor, and can inhibit cellular proliferation. cDNA Identification and Characterization—The Celera and GenBank™ data bases were searched with the protein sequence of the E2F3 DBD using the PSI-BLAST program. Two overlapping E2F7 mouse expressed sequence tags (EST) were identified and purchased from Research Genetics (BE533279) and RIKEN Yokohama Institute (BB637825). A unique XcmI restriction site within the overlapping region was used to merge the two EST clones to produce a full-length 5519-bp-long cDNA. The open reading frame of 2715 bp was cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3–5xMyc, downstream and in the same reading frame of the Myc epitope sequence. MEF Generation—Primary MEFs were isolated from 13.5-day-old embryos using standard methods (6Wu L. Timmers C. Maiti B. Saavedra H.I. Sang L. Chong G.T. Nuckolls F. Giangrande P. Wright F.A. Field S.J. Greenberg M.E. Orkin S. Nevins J.R. Robinson M.L. Leone G. Nature. 2001; 414: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The experiments presented here were repeated in at least two different MEF preparations. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 12.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Serum Starvation and Serum Stimulation—Subconfluent MEFs were synchronized by incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.2% FBS for 48 h and then stimulated to proliferate by the addition of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 12.5% FBS. The cells were collected at different time points after serum stimulation and were processed for BrdU incorporation assays, flow cytometry, and RNA isolation as previously described (4Leone G. DeGregori J. Yan Z. Jakoi L. Ishida S. Williams R.S. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2120-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). For the BrdU incorporation assays, we counted at least twice 300 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) counter-stained nuclei for each time point. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA for Northern blot analysis was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen), and mRNA was subsequently purified using PolyATract mRNA isolation system as described by the manufacturer (Promega). Purified mRNA was separated on a 1% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde and transferred onto a Gene Screen membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The cDNA probe corresponding to the first 1200 bp of the E2F7 open reading frame was labeled using Prime-It RmT (Stratagene) with 50 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP. The cell cycle blot as well as a commercially purchased mouse tissue Northern blot (Origene) were hybridized overnight under high stringency conditions (5× SSPE, 50% formamide, 5× Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS at 42 °C) and washed several times (0.2× SSC, 0.2% SDS at 65 °C) before autoradiography. Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription PCR—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent. For the reverse transcription-PCR, oligo(dT)-primed first strand cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA using the Superscript Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol, and aliquots of 1 μl were used for each PCR. 45 cycles of PCR amplification were performed in a final volume of 20 μl with 20 pmol of the following gene-specific primers mixed together in one PCR: 5′-GGACACCCACAGCCAACCT and 5′-CGTGCCAACCATACTGATTCTTAG for E2F7 and 5′-CCCGCAGTTCCAGAAGCTC and 5′-GCATCACCTCCTTGTTCAC for glycosylphosphatidylinositol. Promoter Isolation and E2F Site Mutations—A 8-kbp genomic fragment containing the putative promoter region and the first exon was isolated from BAC clone RP23–80G4 and subcloned into pBluescript SK(+/-). The primers 5′-GAGAGACTCGAGGGGCACCCTACAAAATAACAGT and 5′-GAGAGAAAGCTTATTTCCCCCTACACAAACAACGAC containing XhoI and HindIII, respectively, were used to generate a 2-kbp E2F7 promoter fragment via PCR. The PCR product was digested with XhoI and HindIII, subcloned into XhoI/HindIII-digested pGL2Basic, and sequenced. The three E2F recognition sites in the E2F7 promoter were mutated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as specified by the manufacturer. The following point mutations were incorporated (the wild-type sequence is followed by the mutant sequence): E2F site 1, 5′-CCCCGCGGGAAA to 5′-CCCCGCTTGAAA; E2F site 2, 5′-TTTAGCGGGGA to 5′-TTTAAAGGGGA; and E2F site 3, 5′-TTTGCGCCAAA to 5′-TTTGAACCAAA. All of the constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Reporter Assays—MEFs were grown in triplicate and transfected with the firefly luciferase expression vectors, together with either thymidine kinase (TK) Renilla luciferase or cytomegalovirus (CMV)-β-galactosidase as internal controls, as described previously (14Sears R. Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5227-5235Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). After transfection, the cells were brought to quiescence by serum starvation and then stimulated to grow by the addition of fresh medium with serum. The cells were harvested at various time points, and luciferase was detected by a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (14Sears R. Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5227-5235Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—MEFs were grown in 35-mm dishes and transfected with Myc-tagged E2F7 or control vector. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and methanol/acetone (1:1). The Myc antibody 9E10 (Santa Cruz, SC-40) was incubated for 2 h at a dilution of 1:100 in 1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated with a rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (diluted 1:75; Vector Laboratories). The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the nuclei were stained with DAPI. Western Blot Analysis—Cell protein lysates were separated in SDS acrylamide gels and blotted into polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The blots were first incubated in blocking buffer (10% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween) and subsequently incubated in blocking buffer containing the antibody specific for Myc (SC-40; 1 μg/ml). The primary antibody was then detected using horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibodies and ECL reagent as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). E2F DNA Binding Assays—E2F assays were performed as described previously (15Nevins J.R. DeGregori J. Jakoi L. Leone G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Supershift analysis was carried out as previously described using an antibody specific against Myc (SC-40). An end-labeled 130-bp-long plasmid DNA fragment from the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) promoter containing two E2F recognition site was used as a probe. The proliferating cell nuclear antigen probe contains the annealed oligonucleotides 5′-TCGAGTTTTCCCGCCTTTTTTCCCGCCTTC and 5′-TCGAGAAGGCGGGAAAAAAGGCGGGAAAAC including two copies of an E2F sites derived from the tobacco proliferating cell nuclear antigen promoter (13Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16553-16558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The E2 probe is composed of the annealed oligonucleotide 5′-TCGAGACGTAGTTTTCGCGCTTAAATTTGAGAAAGGGCGCGAAACTAGTCCTTAAC and 5′-TCGAGTTAAGGACTAGTTTCGCGCCCTTTCTCAAATTTAAGCGCGAAAACTACGTC, representing positions -76 to -25 of the E2 promoter, which contains the two E2F recognition sites (16Kovesdi I. Reichel R. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2180-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Retroviral Infections—Full-length cDNAs for Myc-tagged versions of mouse E2F3a and E2F7 were subcloned into the pBABE retroviral vector containing a hygromycin-resistant gene. High titer viruses were produced by transient transfection of retroviral constructs into the Phoenix-Eco packaging cell line as described previously (17Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar). MEFs were infected with the retrovirus using standard methods and selected for several days in the presence of 400 μg ml-1 hygromycin. Proliferation Assay—MEFs were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/60-mm dish. Duplicate plates of cells were counted daily using a Beckton Dickson Coulter Counter. Identification of a Putative Novel E2F Family Member: E2F7—The E2F family of transcription factors is composed of six members. To determine whether additional members exist, we searched the recently completed human and mouse genomes (Celera and GenBank™ data bases) for genes containing amino acid homology to the E2F3 DBD. In addition to the six known E2F genes, this analysis identified an additional E2F-related gene, hereafter designated as E2F7, which shared a significant level of homology to other family members that was restricted to the DBD. Based on sequence alignments and assembly of BAC clones, this novel gene can be mapped to mouse chromosome 10 and human chromosome 12. Further in silico analysis of EST data bases revealed multiple mouse (GenBank™ accession numbers BB637825 and BE533279 and Unigene Cluster Mm.11747) and human (GenBank™ accession numbers BE896102 and BE279429 and Unigene Cluster Hs.144687) EST that did not match any of the known E2Fs and that shared extensive sequence identity with the putative E2F7 genomic sequence, suggesting that E2F7 is expressed in both mice and humans. Two mouse EST clones, BB637825 and BE533279, obtained from RIKEN and the IMAGE Consortium, respectively, were sequenced and found to contain an identical overlapping region of 487 bp. A unique XcmI restriction site within this overlapping region was used to construct a full-length cDNA clone of ∼5519 bp, containing an open reading frame of 2715 bp (Fig. 1A). The cDNA includes 212 bp of a 5′-untranslated region followed by an initiating ATG, as judged by the presence of a Kozak consensus sequence, and an inframe TAG termination codon. Alignment of ∼60 overlapping EST identified from the GenBank™ EST data base (Unigene cluster Mm.11747) to the E2F7 cDNA confirmed the above 5′ nucleotide sequence, because none extended beyond the indicated 5′ end of the E2F7 cDNA. Since our initial identification of the putative E2F7 gene, complete sequencing of two full-length 3.6-kb cDNA clones by the FANTOM Consortium and the RIKEN Genome Exploration Research Group (AK031078, XM_196008) have confirmed the existence of the E2F7 cDNA (Fig. 1A). The mouse E2F7 gene contains 13 introns and 14 exons. Of the 13 splice donor/acceptor sites, 12 had consensus GT/AG dinucleotides. The splice donor site at exon 12 could not be determined, because of a small gap in the genomic sequence. The only splice acceptor site, which varied from the typical consensus pattern, was found at exon 13 containing an AA dinucleotide. The E2F7 open reading frame begins at the first base of the second exon and encodes a protein of 904 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of ∼100 kDa. Exon 14 contains the TAG termination codon followed by 2.5 kb of 3′-untranslated sequence including two polyadenylation signals, with the last one situated 14 nucleotides upstream from the poly(A+) tail (Fig. 1A). Comparative Analysis of E2F7 with Known E2Fs—The most notable feature of the putative E2F7 member is that it possesses two DBDs. Amino acid sequence comparison revealed that each of the DBDs of E2F7 have significant homology (30–38% identity) with the DBDs of the other known mammalian E2Fs (Fig. 1B). No significant homology was found between other regions of E2F7 and the known E2Fs. The two DBDs of E2F7 are similar to each other at the amino acid level (29.2% identity). Interestingly, each of the E2F7 DBDs have a high degree of homology with the corresponding AtE2Fd–f DBDs, 51–59% identity for the first and 35–46% identity for the second (Fig. 1C). Again, no homology between E2F7 and these three plant E2Fs was found in regions other than the DBD. E2F7 has three nuclear localization motifs and like AtE2Fd–f, it lacks a dimerization, transactivation, pocket protein-binding, and cyclin A-binding domain. Tissue-specific and Cell Cycle-dependent Expression of E2F7—To determine the patterns of E2F7 expression in adult mice, mRNA levels were measured by Northern blot analysis using an E2F7-specific probe containing the N-terminal 1200 bp of coding sequence. Two specific sized transcripts hybridized to this probe; however, at higher stringencies the slower 5.5-kb migrating transcript was the predominant species that could be detected (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2A, the highest levels of E2F7 expression were observed in the skin and thymus, with little or no expression in the brain, muscle, and stomach. Previous studies have detailed the distinct pattern of expression of the various E2F family genes following mitogenic stimulation of cells. To determine whether E2F7 expression was responsive to growth stimuli, E2F7 expression was measured by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR and Northern blot analysis in synchronized cell populations. To this end, mouse embryonic fibroblasts were starved in 0.2% FBS for 48 h and subsequently stimulated with 12.5% FBS, and the cells were harvested at different time points for RNA isolation. Cells similarly treated in parallel cultures were incubated with BrdU, fixed at the various time points post-stimulation, and processed for indirect immunofluorescence. This analysis indicated that serum stimulation of quiescent cells results in an increase of E2F7 expression similar to that of E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3 (18Leone G. Nuckolls F. Ishida S. Adams M. Sears R. Jakoi L. Miron A. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3626-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), with levels peaking during the S phase, suggesting that the regulation of E2F7 expression is cell growth-dependent (Fig. 2, B and C). Analysis of Promoter Sequence Controlling the Expression of the E2F7 Locus—The cell growth-dependent accumulation of E2F7 mRNA suggests that it may be transcriptionally regulated in response to growth stimuli, albeit that other transcriptional-independent mechanisms are also possible. Examination of sequences upstream of the predicted ATG start codon revealed the presence of a number of potential binding sites for a variety of transcription factors (Fig. 3A). Notably, the putative E2F7 promoter contained three potential E2F-binding elements near the 5′ end of the predicted first exon, with Sp1 recognition sites very close to each of the E2F binding elements. To explore the role of transcriptional regulation in the control of E2F7 expression, we isolated and cloned a 2-kb genomic DNA fragment containing the 5′ sequence flanking the first exon into a luciferase reporter construct (pr-E2F7). To first determine whether the growth-regulated accumulation of E2F7 mRNA could be accounted for a transcriptional mechanism, the activity of the prE2F7 reporter construct was measured in synchronized MEF populations. To this end, MEFs were transfected with the prE2F7 reporter construct along with a TK-driven Renilla luciferase plasmid as an internal control; the cells were then growth-arrested by serum deprivation and subsequently stimulated to reenter the cell cycle by the addition of 12.5% serum. The cells were then harvested at various times after serum addition, and cell extracts were assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activity. As shown in Fig. 3B, E2F7 promoter activity was low in quiescent cells and in early G1 cells but increased 8-fold by 24 h post-stimulation, corresponding with the serum-dependent induction of E2F7 mRNA observed previously (Fig. 2, B and C). To investigate the role of the putative E2F recognition sites in regulating the growth-dependent activation of E2F7, the three E2F binding elements on its promoter were eliminated in combination (Fig. 3A). MEFs were transfected with either the wild-type or each of the mutated E2F7 promoter constructs, as well as with a TK-Renilla luciferase plasmid as an internal control. Transfected cells were growth-arrested in low serum medium and then stimulated to reenter the cell cycle by the addition of 12.5% serum. The promoter with the three E2F sites mutated exhibited a 5-fold increase in activity in quiescent cells (Fig. 3, B and C), suggesting that these E2F-binding elements play a negative regulatory role on the regulation of its expression. In addition, mutation of the E2F-binding sites also resulted in higher E2F7 promoter activity when cells were restimulated with serum, as early as 6 h post-stimulation, indicating that E2F7 expression can also be regulated positively through E2F-binding site-independent transcriptional mechanisms. The fact that wild-type and mutant E2F7 promoter constructs could be activated equally well by the overexpression of E2F1 (Fig. 3, D and E), suggests that E2F activators can regulate the E2F7 promoter independently of these three E2F-binding elements. Together, these data suggest that E2F7 expression is subject to E2F-mediated negative and positive regulation by different mechanisms. E2F7 Is a Nuclear Protein, Binds E2F Consensus Sites, and Has Transcriptional Repression Function—We have also investigated the function of the E2F7 gene product. Because the E2F7 gene contains multiple putative nuclear localization signals (Fig. 1A), we initially evaluated the subcellular localization of a Myc-tagged version of E2F7 (Myc-E2F7). Transient transfection of Myc-E2F7 resulted in its efficient expression as detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4A). Cells transfected with Myc-E2F7 were also plated in parallel, fixed, and processed for immunofluorescence with anti-Myc (9E10) antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4B (and data not shown), Myc-E2F7 is localized exclusively in the nucleus regardless of cell cycle position; cells transfected with a control vector did not show any staining, indicating that the antibody did not detect any endogenous Myc protein under these experimental settings. The ability of E2F7 to bind to E2F DNA recognition sequences was also evaluated. Nuclear or whole cell extracts made from Myc-E2F7 or control vector transfected cells were subjected to electromobility shift assays using three distinct radiolabeled DNA fragments corresponding to the E2F sites in the DHFR, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and E2 promoters. In each case, a novel complex could be visualized in extracts from Myc-E2F7 transfected cells that migrated faster than the other known E2F family members (Fig. 4C). The presence of the Myc-tagged E2F7 in these fast migrating complexes was verified by supershifting with an anti-Myc (9E10) antibody. We next examined the possible role of E2F7 in the transcriptional control of E2F-responsive genes. To this end, MEFs were transfected with luciferase reporter constructs carrying a variety of E2F-responsive promoters, including TK, E2F2, E2F3a, polymerase α, and Rb along with increasing amounts of a Myc-E2F7 expressing vector. Standardization with β-galactosidase activity as an internal control revealed that E2F7 expression in cycling population of cells led to a consistent decrease in some of the E2F target genes, with little or no effect in others (Fig. 5A). The inability to activate transcription is consistent with the fact that E2F7 does not contain a transactivation domain. The inhibition of E2F target genes was accentuated when synchronized population of cells was assayed instead. The prE2F2 reporter gene is activated in an E2F-dependent manner during the G1/S transition in cells induced to enter the cell cycle. To determine whether E2F7 can inhibit this G1/S-specific induction, MEFs were transfected with the Myc-E2F7 expression vector and an E2F-reporter construct (prE2F2) as before, but where subsequently arrested in G0 by serum deprivation, and then induced to enter the cell cycle by the addition of serum for 15 h. Expression of Myc-E2F7 inhibited the serum-induced activation of the prE2F2 reporter in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B), suggesting that E2F7 can block the ability of endogenous E2F complexes to activate this reporter. To determine whether the ability of E2F7 to repress E2F target gene expression is E2F-dependent, we asked whether Myc-E2F7 could inhibit the ability of E2Fs to transactivate E2F-responsive reporter constructs. In these experiments, MEFs were transiently transfected with E2F1 and the prE2F2 reporter construct and increasing amounts of E2F7. As previously shown, E2F1 expression resulted in the activation of reporter gene activity by ∼6-fold (Fig. 5C). This E2F1-mediated activation was effectively inhibited by Myc-E2F7 in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that E2F7 can act to inhibit E2F-mediated activation of target genes. E2F7 Inhibits Cellular Proliferation—Members of the E2F family play a critical role in the control of cellular proliferation. To explore the potential role of E2F7 in cellular growth, we measured the effect of E2F7 overexpression on cellular proliferation. Wild-type primary MEFs were infected with a retrovirus expressing Myc-E2F7, selected for a brief period with hygromycin, and replated at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells/60-mm tissue culture dish, and viable cells were counted for a period of 7 days. Relative to control cells infected with an E2F3a expressing retrovirus (pBABE-MycE2F3a) or an empty pBABE vector, the proliferation rate of Myc-E2F7 expressing cells was decreased (Fig. 6A). To address whether the reduced growth rates of E2F7 overexpressing cells could be attributed to a specific defect in the G1/S transition, MEFs infected with either a Myc-E2F7 overexpressing or control virus were synchronized by serum deprivation, then stimulated to proliferate by the addition of serum, and assayed for S phase entry by the incorporation of BrdU into replicating DNA. Surprisingly, S phase entry was not delayed in cells overexpressing E2F7 (Fig. 6B). Rather, overexpression of E2F7 led to an accumulation of cells in G2/M and a decrease in G1 as determined by flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 6C). This accumulation in G2/M, although not pronounced, was consistently observed in numerous experiments. Together, these results indicate that E2F7 overexpression can lead to impaired proliferation and accumulation of cells in G2/M phase. Consistent with the absence of a G1/S phase-specific defect in E2F7 overexpressing cells, the accumulation of known E2F target transcripts, including Dhfr, Cdc6, cyclin A2, cyclin E, and mcm3 was similar in Myc-E2F7-expressing and control cells (data not shown). These findings suggest that the impaired proliferation in E2F7-overexpressing cells is not related to a defect in the G1/S transition. E2F plays an important role in the control of cell proliferation in many different species, including mammals, flies, nematodes, amphibians, and plants. Comparative evaluation of amino acid sequences reveal that the DBD of E2Fs are evolutionary conserved and therefore represent an essential feature that serves to identify E2F family members. Herein we describe the cloning and characterization of a novel murine gene that contains this most conserved domain common to all known E2Fs. Functional studies confirm that this novel protein can bind to consensus E2F DNA recognition sequences, supporting its classification as a genuine member of the E2F family, and we have thus named it E2F7. Despite this designation, structural and functional data indicate that E2F7 functions in a different manner from the other E2F family members. The most notable feature of E2F7 is that it contains two DBDs and lacks the heterodimerization domain, suggesting that this protein recognizes E2F consensus sites independently of a DP partner. This novel E2F member most closely resembles the recently identified AtE2Fd–f subfamily members in A. thaliana. Kosugi and Ohashi (13Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16553-16558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) speculate that the tandem repeat of the DBDs within the plant E2Fs might structurally mimic the DBD formed in E2F/DP heterodimers. This speculation was supported by the fact that deletion of either one of the two DBDs in AtE2Fd–f resulted in a complete loss of its ability to bind DNA. Like E2F6, E2F7 also lacks the C-terminal domains necessary for transactivation and pocket protein binding, consistent with its inability to activate known E2F-responsive genes. Instead, E2F7 is able to block the endogenous E2F-dependent transcriptional activity as well as the transactivating activity of overexpressed E2F1. The mechanism of transcriptional repression is unclear but might involve competition between E2F7 and other E2Fs for the same DNA target sites. E2F6 has been shown to actively repress gene expression by interacting directly with polycomb group proteins through their association via its marked box domain (8Trimarchi J.M. Fairchild B. Wen J. Lees J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1519-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Although E2F7 does not possess a similar marked box domain, it might contain a functionally related domain(s) that could potentially recruit co-repressors to E2F-regulated promoters. Interestingly, E2F7-mediated transcriptional repression appears to be target gene-dependent because only a subset of known E2F-regulated promoters can be efficiently repressed by E2F7 overexpression, indicating functional specificity for distinct E2F targets. Whether this specificity is dictated by the selectivity of binding to different E2F DNA recognition sites, by the recruitment of co-factors, or through other mechanisms is not known. The identification of E2F7 as a novel E2F family member adds a further level of complexity to the control of E2F-dependent gene expression. It is possible that by inhibiting the DNA binding capacity of the other known E2Fs during the cell cycle, it might modulate cell cycle progression or might provide cells with the ability to respond to additional external cues. In this respect, our data show that the regulation of E2F7 expression is cell growth-dependent, suggesting that E2F7 may play an important role in counter balancing E2F-induced gene expression, as has been demonstrated for the antagonistic relationship between the Drosophila E2Fs (9Stevaux O. Dimova D. Frolov M.V. Taylor-Harding B. Morris E. Dyson N. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4927-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although measurement of E2F7 expression by either Northern, reverse transcriptase-PCR, or reporter assays indicate that its regulation is cell growth-dependent, analysis of the E2F7 gene product has yet to be carried out and must await the generation of E2F7-specific antibodies. In contrast to other E2Fs, E2F7 overexpression led to an inhibition of cellular growth in primary MEFs, accompanied by a moderate but reproducible accumulation of cells in the G2 phase. The E2F7-mediated accumulation of cells in the G2 phase may arise from a decrease in G2 progression, a delay in the exit of cells from G2, or an inability of cells to efficiently enter mitosis. Further investigation will be required to identify the exact mechanism of cell growth inhibition mediated by E2F7 and to identify the specific targets regulated by E2F7 that might mediate this effect. Because E2F7 overexpression has the capacity to slow down cellular growth, one could envision that E2F7 may function as a tumor suppressor gene and that mutations within this gene might result in cancer formation. Although we have yet to establish the true physiological function of E2F7, its broad expression pattern suggests that it may provide an important contribution to the regulation of E2F activities in multiple tissues during development and/or tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2046635134,"An innovative leaping action propels these bugs to the top of the insect athletic league. There are two basic body designs for jumping that enable many animals to escape from predators, to increase their speed of locomotion or to launch into flight1. Animals with long legs (bush babies, kangaroos and frogs, for example) have a levering power that enables them to use less force to jump the same distance as short-legged animals of comparable mass, whereas those with short legs must rely on the release of stored energy in a rapid catapult action. Insects exploit both designs: bush crickets use the leverage provided by long legs2, fleas use stored energy to power their short legs3, and grasshoppers4 combine features of each. Fleas are considered to be the champion jumpers, but here I show that froghoppers (spittle bugs) are in fact the real champions and that they achieve their supremacy by using a novel catapult mechanism for jumping."

To reproduce the formation of PHF in tissue culture, we stably expressed human tau with and without pathogenic mutations in human SH-SY5Y cells and exposed them for 5 days to aggregated synthetic β-amyloid peptide (Aβ42). This caused a decreased solubility of tau along with the generation of PHF-like tau-containing filaments. These were 20 nm wide and had periodicities of 130-140 nm in the presence of P301L mutant tau or 150-160 nm in the presence of wild-type tau. Mutagenesis of the phosphoepitope serine 422 of tau prevented both the Aβ42-mediated decrease in solubility and the generation of PHF-like filaments, suggesting a role of serine 422 or its phosphorylation in tau filament formation. Together, our data underscore a role of Aβ42 in the formation of PHF-like filaments. Our culture system will be useful to map phosphoepitopes of tau involved in PHF formation and to identify and characterize modifiers of the tau pathology.

NFT are composed of filamentous aggregates that include paired helical filaments (PHF) and narrow twisted ribbons. These are made of the microtubule-associated protein tau (4Lee V.M. Goedert M.

Rev. 2001; 35: 266-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Tau in these filaments is hyperphosphorylated both at physiological sites and at additional, pathological sites. Phosphorylation of tau is associated with the dissociation of tau from microtubules and with its relocalization from axons to cell bodies and dendrites. Pathologic increases in this pool of soluble tau, along with conformational changes of the natively unfolded tau, are initial critical steps in the assembly of the more insoluble pathological tau filaments. Transgenic mice expressing pathogenic mutations of human tau generate a few low abundant NFT (6Lewis J. McGowan E. Rockwood J. Melrose H. Nacharaju P. Van Slegtenhorst M. Gwinn-Hardy K. Murphy M.P.

These data established a mechanistic relationship of β-amyloid toxicity with NFT formation. To circumvent the inherent limitations of the above in vivo experiments (including poor breeding of doubly transgenic mice as well as stereotaxic techniques) and to establish PHF formation in tissue culture, we expressed both wild-type and mutant forms of human tau in human SH-SY5Y cells and exposed them to preparations of aggregated synthetic β-amyloid. We were able to produce bona fide PHF-like tau filaments within 5 days of tissue culture. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The longest human 4-repeat tau isoform, htau40, was cloned into the pRc/RSV expression vector (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange kit; Stratagene) was performed to generate the tau mutant P301L and the double mutants, P301L/S422E and P301L/S422A. The sequences of the mutagenized oligonucleotides were as follows: P301L, 5′-GGTTTGTAGACTATTTGCACACTGCCGCCTCCCTGGACGTGTTTG-3′; S422E, 5′-GCATCGACATGGTAGACGAGCCCCAGCTCGCCACGC-3′; S422A, 5′-GCATCGACATGGTAGACGCGCCCCAGCTCGCCACGC-3′. All constructs were sequenced to confirm the absence of randomly introduced mutations. Cell Culture—Human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were transfected with either wild-type or mutant htau40 cDNA constructs using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) and selected with 125 μg/ml G418 for 30 days. Pools of selected clones were seeded at a density of 0.3-2.0 × 104 cells/cm2, depending on the type of experiment (low density culture for immunocytochemistry and high density culture for electron microscopy and Western blot analysis). To normalize for cell numbers, undifferentiated cells were seeded at a density which, after Aβ42 incubation for 5 days, was below 50% and thus comparable with numbers of differentiated cells at the time of Aβ42 treatment. To induce neuronal differentiation, cells were seeded on collagen type I-coated dishes and treated with 20 μm all-trans-retinoic acid (Sigma) for 5 days in standard culture medium and cultivated for an additional 5 days in serum-free medium complemented with 50 ng/ml brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Peprotech, Lucerne, Switzerland) (10Encinas M.

Moreover, the cells expressed synaptophysin when cultured on murine organotypic hippocampal slices. 2O. Raineteau and A. Ferrari, data not shown. Two independent lots of Aβ42 (Nos. 524548 and 535120) and Aβ42-1 (Lot No. 536763) were synthesized by Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland), reconstituted in PBS at calculated concentrations of 220 μm, shaken at 1000 rpm for 24 h at 37 °C, and analyzed by electron microscopy. This preparation contained β-amyloid fibrils along with protofibrils and SDS-stable oligomers (11Hartley D.M. Walsh D.M. Ye C.P. Diehl T. Vasquez S. Vassilev P.M. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J.

Suspensions of Aβ42 preparations corresponding to 10 μm soluble peptide were added to each culture for 1-5 days for immunohistochemistry or 2-5 days for sarkosyl extractions and electron microscopy. Once Aβ42 preparations had been added to the cells, the medium was not changed. This, in addition to the stickiness of Aβ42, may explain why Aβ42 formed large clumps on the cells as visualized by immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy. Lactate dehydrogenase assays (Sigma) were performed to measure the toxicity of Aβ42. Immunofluorescence Analysis and Antibodies—For immunocytochemistry, cells were grown on collagen-coated coverslips and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in microtubule-stabilizing buffer at room temperature for 30 min, followed by permeabilization with 0.3% Triton X-100.

Acta Neuropathol. 1999; 97: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and pS422 (BIOSOURCE Inc., Nivelles, Belgium; IC, 1:1000) were used to detect tau phosphorylated at Ser-422. Antibodies for neuronal markers included NF200 (Sigma; IH, 1:400), NSE (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark; IC, 1:200), and MAP2 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA; IC, 1:400), and as a glial marker GFAP (Sigma; IC, 1:100) was used. Monoclonal antibody 4G8 (Signet Laboratories, Dedham, MA; IC, 1:500; EM, 1:50) was used to detect Aβ amyloid peptide. Secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (West Grove, PA). For a quantification, two independent experiments were performed and 200 cells were counted for each experimental condition. Western Blot Analysis, Aβ-ELISA, and Quantitative RT-PCR—Tau-expressing cells were grown on 10-cm dishes and extracted in RIPA buffer as described previously (14Probst A. Gotz J. Wiederhold K.H. Tolnay M. Mistl C. Jaton A.L. Hong M. Ishihara T. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Crowther R.A. Spillantini M.G. Burki K. Goedert M. Acta Neuropathol. 2000; 99: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on a 10% NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen), blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with HT7 and a β-actin-specific antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK; 1:5000). The levels and solubility of tau protein were determined by extracting Aβ-treated and control cells using buffers with increasing ionic strengths (14Probst A. Gotz J. Wiederhold K.H. Tolnay M. Mistl C. Jaton A.L. Hong M. Ishihara T. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Crowther R.A. Spillantini M.G. Burki K. Goedert M. Acta Neuropathol. 2000; 99: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The cells were homogenized in high-salt reassembly (RAB) buffer to generate the RAB-insoluble fractions. Following centrifugation, the pellets were homogenized in RIPA buffer and centrifuged. The RIPA-insoluble pellets were extracted with 70% formic acid (FA) to give the FA fractions. Centrifugation was done at 50,000 × g for 20 min. Protein concentrations of the samples from each fraction were adjusted to equal levels and the same amounts of protein run on a 10% NUPAGE gel and blotted as described above. As loading control and to exclude contamination of the FA fraction with soluble proteins, the blots were probed with a GAPDH-specific monoclonal antibody (BioDesign, Saco, ME; 1:500). Furthermore, an Aβ42-specific ELISA (Innogenetics, Gent, Belgium) was included for a subset of the samples. For quantification, the Western blots were probed with the tau-specific antibody HT7 and analyzed by densitometry. The same exposure time was chosen for all blots. The x-ray films were scanned at 400 ppi and the images analyzed with the AlphaEase software (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). For the purpose of graphic representation, for each blot the intensity values of all time points were normalized using the value at time point t 0. Statistical analysis of the intensity differences between PBS- and Aβ42-treated samples was done with the original intensity values, because only the relative and not the absolute differences are relevant for the two-tailed Student's t test. The real-time quantitative PCR for tau was done with HPLC-purified primers and an HPLC-purified probe (forward primer, 5′-CAAGACCAAGAGGGTGACACG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TCAGAGCCCGGTTCCTCAG-3′ (Metabion GmbH, Martinsried, Germany); TaqMan probe, 5′-6-FAM-CTGGCCTGAAAGAATCTCCCCTGCA-BHQ-1-3′ (Biosearch Technologies Inc., Novato, CA). As reference gene, the TaqMan rodent GAPDH control no. 4308313 (Applied Biosystems, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used and ΔCt values (cycle threshold values) were determined. Sarkosyl Extraction and Immunoelectron Microscopy—Sarkosyl extractions of tau were done as previously described (15Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Cairns N.J. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1992; 8: 159-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). The extracts were placed on formvar/carbon-coated 300-mesh grids and incubated with the primary antibody in PBS/0.1% gelatin for 90 min at room temperature. Antibody Tau-5A6 was used at a 1:50 dilution. As a positive control, AD brain extracts were included; the secondary antibody used for AD extracts was either conjugated to gold (data not shown) or not (for Fig. 4). In addition, extracts were incubated with the Aβ42-specific antibody 4G8 at 1:50 dilutions. Again, controls were included in which the primary antibody had been omitted. Grids were incubated with 6 nm Au-conjugated or unconjugated secondary antibodies (Aurion, Wageningen, Netherlands) and stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid. Micrographs were recorded on a Philips model CM12 electron microscope. Thin Section Immunoelectron Microscopy—To visualize β-amyloid on the cells, samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde. Following fixation, tissue blocks were epoxy-embedded, sectioned with a Reichert Ultracut E microtome (Leica, Solms, Germany), placed on 200-mesh copper grids, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. To visualize tau filaments, cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, washed with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS, embedded in 3% agar (Noble; Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI), and submerged in sucrose-PVP 2 m (Sigma) for 3 days. Samples were mounted and cut on a Reichert Ultracut S cryostat (Leica) to obtain ultra-thin sections. Grids were processed for immunolabeling as follows. After a blocking step in 5% goat serum in PBS for 20 min, the primary anti-tau antibody Tau-5A6 was added in 1% goat serum in PBS at a 1:50 dilution for 2 h, followed by a 6-nm gold-coupled goat anti-mouse antiserum (Aurion) in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS at a 1:5 dilution for 1 h. Controls were included in which the primary antibody had been omitted. Washes were done with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 10 min. Finally, the grids were stained with 3% uranyl acetate and 2% methylcellulose. Micrographs were recorded on a Philips model CM12 electron microscope. To determine the number of gold-decorated tau filamentous aggregates/cell, a cut-off of 15 gold particles per aggregate was defined, and groups of gold particles were counted per cell in 30 Aβ42-treated compared with 30 untreated cells. Aβ42 Decreases the Solubility of Tau—To assess the role of Aβ42 in tau aggregation and filament formation in tissue culture, we added preparations of aggregated synthetic Aβ42 to the media of SH-SY5Y cells that had been stably transfected with expression constructs encoding the longest 4-repeat isoform of human tau, with or without the pathogenic FTDP-17 mutation P301L (Fig. 1A). Confocal analysis confirmed the presence of Aβ42 aggregates deposited on both cell bodies and neurites (Fig. 1B). Neither the size nor the number of these aggregates varied within 1 and 5 days of incubation. Electron-microscopic analyses demonstrated that Aβ42 aggregates contained the expected amorphous fibrous material that was similar to that extracted from brain β-amyloid plaques (Fig. 1, C-E). In this assay system the initial 5 days of treatment with Aβ42 were not accompanied by any obvious increases in cell death, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays did not reveal increased LDH release, as compared with vehicle controls (data not shown). Western blots confirmed that cellular levels of human tau were similar in all transfected conditions, both in undifferentiated cells (data not shown) and cells that were sequentially differentiated with retinoic acid and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Fig. 1A). To determine the role of Aβ42 in the aggregation of tau, we used undifferentiated cells that expressed wild-type human tau. We extracted cellular proteins in high-salt RAB buffer to generate the RAB fraction. We then homogenized the RAB-insoluble pellet in RIPA buffer to obtain RIPA-soluble proteins and extracted the RIPA-insoluble pellet with FA to obtain the FA-soluble protein fraction (Fig. 2). Equal amounts of total protein of the treated and untreated fractions were loaded, but the FA fractions contained less protein than the RAB and RIPA fractions. The signals in the three fractions could not be added up to determine the total amount of tau, because tau had been sequentially extracted. After 1 day of Aβ42 treatment, most tau was present in the RAB fraction and only a small fraction was RAB-insoluble and found in the RIPA fraction, as compared with none in the RIPA fraction of the vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 2A). During 5 days of incubation with Aβ42, the solubility of tau decreased significantly because a substantial amount of it appeared in the RIPA and FA fractions. In contrast, in untreated control cells, tau was absent from the FA fraction after 5 days of incubation with the vehicle (Fig. 2B). In addition to full-length tau, we observed, at variable degrees, truncated tau with a molecular mass of 28 kDa. Probing of the blots (Fig. 2B) with a GAPDH-specific monoclonal antibody confirmed equal amounts of protein in the RAB fraction. Moreover, we could exclude a carryover of soluble proteins into the FA fraction (Fig. 2C). An Aβ42-specific ELISA (Innogenetics) was included for a subset of the samples. This assay showed that substantial amounts of Aβ42 were in the RIPA and FA fraction (data not shown). Therefore, by loading equal amounts of protein of the Aβ42- and PBS-treated FA fractions, the amount of FA-soluble tau is likely to be underestimated in the Aβ42-treated compared with the PBS-treated FA fractions. Next, to monitor the kinetics of tau assembly, combined levels of FA-soluble full-length and truncated tau were quantified after incubation with Aβ42 for 0 h, 6 h, 1 d, 3 d, and 5 d and compared with PBS-treated controls. Three independent experiments revealed an increase of tau in the FA fraction with longer exposure to Aβ42 that was statistically significant at 5 d (Fig. 2D, *, two-tailed Student's t test; p = 0.03). To determine whether Aβ42 affects tau transcription, we performed a quantitative RT-PCR analysis. When undifferentiated P301L cells were compared with mock-transfected cells at time point 0, we found that incubation with Aβ42 for 5 days did not alter tau mRNA levels, either in mock- or P301L-transfected cells (Fig. 3). Aβ42 Induces PHF-like Tau Filaments—To determine whether the decreased solubility of tau in response to exposure to Aβ42 was associated with the formation of PHF, we analyzed sarkosyl protein extracts by negative contrast electron microscopy (Fig. 4). As a control, we included sarkosyl extracts from a human brain with a confirmed NFT pathology. It contained many PHF with expected widths of 20 nm and periodicities of 75-80 nm (Fig. 4A) (16Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2288-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Immunoelectron microscopy of sarkosyl protein extracts of undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells expressing wild-type human tau with the monoclonal antibody Tau-5A6 identified many twisted filaments with widths of up to 20 nm, periodicities of 150-160 nm, and lengths of up to 1200 nm (Fig. 4, B and C and Table I). They resembled the PHF extracted from NFT in human neurodegenerative diseases and are best described as narrow twisted ribbons (17Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Kamphorst W. Heutink P. van Swieten J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1359-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar).Table ITau filament formationUndifferentiatedDifferentiatedPBSAβ42PBSAβ42MockNDaND, not determinedNDNoNoWild-type tauNoYesNoYesP301L tauNoYesNoYesP301L/S422E tauNoNoNoNoP301L/S422A tauNoNoNoNoa ND, not determined Open table in a new tab Because the ultrastructural characteristics of abnormal filaments in human neurodegenerative diseases vary with pathogenic mutations (4Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2162) Google Scholar, 5Gotz J. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2001; 35: 266-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), we analyzed the abnormal filaments generated by P301L mutant tau. Again, Aβ42 caused the generation of PHF-like filaments both in differentiated and undifferentiated cells stably transfected with P301L mutant tau (Fig. 4, D and E and Table I). These PHF had shorter periodicities of 130-140 nm with similar widths as compared with the wild-type tau filaments, consistent with the fact that mutations can affect the phenotype of the tau filaments. To exclude that the PHF-like filaments contained β-amyloid fibrils derived from our Aβ42 preparation, we showed that the anti-Aβ42 antibody 4G8 failed to decorate the PHF, whereas it clearly decorated β-amyloid fibrils extracted with the identical sarkosyl protocol (data not shown). Moreover, we found with electron microscopy that our β-amyloid fibrils were 7-10 nm wide and lacked regular periodicities (Fig. 1E, inset) (11Hartley D.M. Walsh D.M. Ye C.P. Diehl T. Vasquez S. Vassilev P.M. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8876-8884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Control experiments showed that neither vehicle controls nor identical preparations of the reverse peptide Aβ42-1 caused the formation of PHF. Neuronally differentiated SH-SY5Y cells transfected with either wild-type or P301L tau also formed many PHF-like filaments after 5 days of exposure to the Aβ42 preparation (Table I). This may be because of similar cellular levels of human tau in both differentiated and undifferentiated cells, in that cellular levels of tau in the transfected cells exceeded those of endogenous 3-repeat tau (18Uberti D. Rizzini C. Spano P.F. Memo M. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 235: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) by more than 10 times (Fig. 1A). A quantitative analysis of filament formation in sarkosyl extracts by negative staining electron microscopy is impossible because the adherence of the sample to the grid surface is irregular, due to the irreproducibility of the surface charge of the carbon-coated grids. Thus, filaments may cluster in one field of a grid, whereas another field may be completely empty. A semi-quantitative analysis can be achieved by immunoelectron microscopy on ultra-thin cryosections of cells. We treated undifferentiated wild-type tau-expressing cells either with Aβ42 or PBS and obtained cryosections that were incubated with the human tau-specific antibody Tau-5A6, followed by a gold-labeled secondary antibody. As a control, the primary antibody was omitted. Cryoelectron microscopy has the disadvantage that cellular structures are not resolved, but antibodies can penetrate the sections more easily. Many gold-decorated aggregates were revealed in the cytoplasm of neurons that were treated with Aβ42 (Fig. 5, A and B). For a quantification, an arbitrary cut-off of 15 gold particles was defined to increase the stringency and to reduce the background. Groups of gold particles were counted per cell in Aβ42-treated compared with untreated cells. This revealed a strong increase in the number of tau aggregates in Aβ42-treated cells (Fig. 5C). Role of Epitope Ser-422 of Tau in Aggregation and Filament Formation—In transgenic mice expressing P301L tau, Ser-422 was among the epitopes that were selectively phosphorylated in response to Aβ42 injections (9Gotz J. Chen F. van Dorpe J. Nitsch R.M. Science. 2001; 293: 1491-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Therefore, we stained both neuronally differentiated P301L and wild-type tau-expressing cells with the phospho-Ser-422-specific antiserum pS422 and included the phospho-Ser-202/Thr-205-specific antibody AT8 as a control. 200 cells were counted for each experimental condition. Aβ42 treatment did not cause increases in the numbers of AT8-positive cells; all HT7-positive tau-expressing cells were also AT8-positive, even in the absence of Aβ42 (data not shown). In contrast, incubation of P301L-expressing cells with Aβ42 for 1 day caused a more than 2-fold increase in the number of pS422-positive cells compared with HT7-positive cells, whereas wild-type tau-expressing cells required treatment for 5 days with Aβ42 to increase the ratio of pS422-positive cells (19Haque N. Tanaka T. Iqbal K. Grundke-Iqbal I. Brain Res. 1999; 838: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6, A-D). This difference was statistically significant (*, wild-type cells treated with Aβ42 for 5 days: 29.81% ± 7.04% pS422-positive cells/HT7-positive cells; wild-type cells treated with vehicle for 5 days: 18.75% ± 9.49%; p < 0.05; **, P301L cells treated with Aβ42 for 1 day: 64.66% ± 12.93% pS422/HT7-positive cells; P301L cells treated with vehicle for 1 day: 27.93% ± 5.60%; p < 0.002; Mann-Whitney U test). To better characterize the role of Ser-422 in tau filament formation, we mutated Ser-422 to alanine or glutamic acid and expressed either P301L/S422A or P301L/S422E double mutants both in undifferentiated and in neuronally differentiated cells at similar levels as compared with the wild-type and P301L single mutant cells (Fig. 1A). The Ser-422 mutations were introduced into the P301L mutant and not into the wild-type tau expression constructs because the P301L cells showed the strongest phospho-Ser-422 staining. Next, we incubated the undifferentiated cells for 5 days with Aβ42 and fractionated tau into the RAB fraction, the RIPA-soluble fraction, and the FA-soluble fraction. In contrast to Aβ42-treated P301L tau-expressing cells, tau was not present in the FA fraction of P301L/S422A and P301L/S422E extracts, indicating that mutagenesis of Ser-422 blocked the Aβ42-mediated decrease in the solubility of tau (Fig. 6E). Finally, we determined whether treatments with Aβ42 would induce PHF-like tau filaments in either double mutant cell line. We did not find any evidence for PHF-like tau filament formation in the presence of the S422A or the S422E mutation (Table I). Together, these data suggest an important role of Ser-422 in Aβ42-induced tau filament formation. The results of this study show that Aβ42 decreases the solubility of tau and induces PHF-like tau filaments in a human tissue culture system. A 5-day incubation with aggregated synthetic Aβ42 of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells that had been stably transfected with expression constructs encoding the longest human tau isoform, with or without the pathogenic FTDP-17 mutation P301L, caused a substantial amount of tau to appear in the FA fraction. A quantitative TaqMan PCR analysis of Aβ42-treated cells did not reveal increased tau mRNA synthesis, although increases below 1.5-fold would not be detected by this method. Instead, the increased appearance of tau in the FA fraction indicates a role of Aβ42 in the biophysical properties of tau that determine its solubility within cells. However, we cannot exclude that Aβ42 may also affect the turnover rate of tau. The decreased solubility of tau in response to exposure to Aβ42 was also associated with the formation of twisted tau filaments as shown by negative contrast electron microscopy of sarkosyl protein extracts. These resembled the PHF extracted from NFT in human neurodegenerative diseases and are best described as narrow twisted ribbons (17Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Kamphorst W. Heutink P. van Swieten J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1359-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). This difference in periodicity to the PHF extracted from human postmortem brains may be related to the known influence of the ratio of 4-repeat to 3-repeat human tau. In comparison to the 1:1 ratio in human brains (4Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2162) Google Scholar), this ratio was high (above 10:1) in our experimental system. The ultrastructural characteristics of abnormal filaments in human neurodegenerative diseases vary with pathogenic mutations (4Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2162) Google Scholar, 5Gotz J. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2001; 35: 266-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We found that the PHF-like filaments extracted from cells expressing P301L mutant tau had shorter periodicities of 130-140 nm compared with wild-type tau filaments, consistent with the fact that mutations can affect the phenotype of the tau filaments. For comparison, the twisted ribbons in FTDP-17 patients carrying the P301L mutation have periodicities of greater than 130 nm (4Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2162) Google Scholar), whereas the tau filaments in Drosophila generated by expression of human 4-repeat wild-type tau have periodicities of 45 nm (20Jackson G.R. Wiedau-Pazos M. Sang T.-K. Wagle N. Brown C.A. Massachi S. Geschwind D.H. Neuron. 2002; 34: 509-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with our previous results of Aβ42-induced PHF-like tau filament formation in transgenic mice (9Gotz J. Chen F. van Dorpe J. Nitsch R.M. Science. 2001; 293: 1491-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar), but in contrast to the transgenic mice Aβ42-induced PHF formation in tissue culture also occurred with wild-type tau. This may be related to the species difference and points to the possibility that human cells in culture may be more susceptible to the formation of abnormal tau filaments as compared with murine cells in vivo. Fibrillar aggregates of tau were previously observed in Chinese hamster ovary cells that had been transfected with triple mutant tau expression constructs (21Vogelsberg-Ragaglia V. Bruce J. Richter-Landsberg C. Zhang B. Hong M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4093-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In a related study (22Perez M. Hernandez F. Gomez-Ramos A. Smith M. Perry G. Avila J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1484-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), combined treatments of SH-SY5Y cells with okadaic acid and 4-hydroxynonenal induced 2-3-nm-wide fibrillar tau polymers. The PHF-like filaments in our tissue culture system clearly differed from both of the above in that they were much longer, about 10 times wider, and had readily identifiable twisted structures (Fig. 4). This difference could well be related to the prolonged exposure to Aβ42 in our experiments, because we could not observe any filamentous structures for up to 2 days of exposure to Aβ42 (Table I). A semi-quantitative analysis of filament analysis by immunoelectron microscopy on ultra-thin cryosections of cells revealed a significant increase in the number of tau aggregates in Aβ42-treated cells. The albeit-low number of aggregates in the untreated group is not unexpected, because overexpression of tau in itself is likely to cause some aggregation as has been shown in vivo for wild-type or P301L mutant tau-expressing mice in the absence of Aβ42 (6Lewis J. McGowan E. Rockwood J. Melrose H. Nacharaju P. Van Slegtenhorst M. Gwinn-Hardy K. Murphy M.P. Baker M. Yu X. Duff K. Hardy J. Corral A. Lin W.L. Yen S.H. Dickson D.W. Davies P. Hutton M. Nat.

Pathol. 2001; 158: 555-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The expression of P301L mutant tau in transgenic mice showed that the presence of a pathogenic mutation is required for both early and substantial tau filament and tangle formation; wild-type tau transgenic mice develop only a few tangles at very old age, despite higher expression levels of the transgene (7Gotz J. Chen F. Barmettler R. Nitsch R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 529-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 24Ishihara T. Hong M. Zhang B. Nakagawa Y. Lee M.K. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Neuron. 1999; 24: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Obviously, in mice, the pathogenic mutation is needed to catalyze the pathogenic conversion of tau, which is not the case in our cellular model. Therefore, our cellular model mimics more closely human sporadic AD, where tau filament formation occurs in the absence of tau mutations and tau overexpression. However, it has to be kept in mind that in humans AD needs decades to develop, whereas in vitro pathological changes have to be achieved within a few days or in vivo within a few months, asking for high (and therefore unphysiological) levels of tau expression. Our data also imply that either the Ser-422 site of tau itself or its phosphorylation are necessary, although not sufficient, for tau filament formation. Despite the presence of the P301L mutation that in humans and in tau transgenic mouse models enhances tau filament formation, the S422A and S422E mutants did not form tau filaments by incubating the cells with Aβ42. In transgenic mice expressing P301L tau, Ser-422, but not the AT8 epitope Ser-202/Thr-205, was among the epitopes that were selectively phosphorylated in response to Aβ42 injections (9Gotz J. Chen F. van Dorpe J. Nitsch R.M. Science. 2001; 293: 1491-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Aβ42 treatment did not cause increases in the numbers of AT8-positive cells because all HT7-positive tau-expressing cells were also AT8-positive, even in the absence of Aβ42. These findings are in agreement with those obtained in mice (9Gotz J. Chen F. van Dorpe J. Nitsch R.M. Science. 2001; 293: 1491-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). In contrast, incubation of P301L-expressing cells with Aβ42 for only 1 day caused a more than 2-fold increase in the number of pS422-positive cells compared with HT7-positive cells. Mutagenesis of Ser-422 revealed that tau was not present in the FA fraction of Aβ42-treated P301L/S422A or P301L/S422E cells, in contrast to Aβ42-treated wild-type or P301L tau-expressing cells. Similarly, we did not find any evidence for PHF-like tau filament formation in the presence of the S422A or the S422E mutation, suggesting an important role of Ser-422 both in the Aβ42-induced decrease in tau solubility and in tau filament formation (Table I). The finding that mutating the serine of epitope 422 to glutamic acid also precluded tau filament formation was unexpected because the S422E modification was designed to mimic the negative charge caused by phosphorylation of this site. Thus, the sole addition of a negative charge at this site is not sufficient to induce the formation of PHF-like tau filaments; coordinated phosphorylation at multiple residues, including Ser-422, may be required. Tau adopts distinct conformations during sequential phosphorylation reactions, and the AD-specific phosphoepitope AT100 can only be generated by a sequential phosphorylation of tau, initially by glycogen synthase kinase-3β followed by protein kinase A, indicating that prephosphorylation at particular sites can alter the conformation and prevent phosphorylation at other sites (25Zheng-Fischhofer Q. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Illenberger S. Godemann R. Mandelkow E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 542-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation is provided by the fact that Ser-422 is located next to a putative caspase-3 cleavage site at position 421 and that altered caspase cleavage is involved in the rates of filament formation (26Abraha A.

In conclusion, we established a tissue culture system for the generation of bona fide PHF-like filaments that closely resembled those extracted from brains of AD patients. The results provided by this system are compatible with an important role of Aβ42 in the generation of NFT in AD, and with a pivotal, yet not exclusive, role of the Ser-422 epitope of tau in tau fibrillogenesis. Our data imply that either the Ser-422 site itself or its phosphorylation are necessary, but not sufficient, for tau filament formation. PHF-like tau filament formation was achieved within 5 days, much faster than in current transgenic mouse models (8Lewis J. Dickson D.W. Lin W.-L. Chisholm L. Corral A. Jones G. Yen S.-H. Sahara N.

Therefore, this culture system will be useful to map phosphoepitopes of tau involved in PHF formation and to identify and characterize modifiers of the tau pathology. Further adaptation of the system may allow the screening and validation of compounds designed to prevent PHF formation."
https://openalex.org/W2004828624,"The possible mechanism of a radiation-induced bystander response was investigated by using a high-LET heavy particle microbeam, which allows selected cells to be individually hit with precise numbered particles. Even when only a single cell within the confluent culture was hit by one particle of 40Ar (approximately 1260 keV/microm) or 20Ne (approximately 380 keV/microm), a 1.4-fold increase of micronuclei (MN) was detected demonstrating a bystander response. When the number of targeted cells increased, the number of MN biphasically increased; however, the efficiency of MN induction per targeted cell markedly decreased. When 49 cells in the culture were individually hit by 1 to 4 particles, the production of MN in the irradiated cultures were approximately 2-fold higher than control levels but independent of the number and LET of the particles. MN induction in the irradiated-culture was partly reduced by treatment with DMSO, a scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and was almost fully suppressed by the mixture of DMSO and PMA, an inhibitor of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC). Accordingly, both ROS and GJIC contribute to the above-mentioned bystander response and GJIC may play an essential role by mediating the release of soluble biochemical factors from targeted cells."
https://openalex.org/W2166434234,"Chitotriosidase is a chitinase that is massively expressed by lipid-laden tissue macrophages in man. Its enzymatic activity is markedly elevated in serum of patients suffering from lysosomal lipid storage disorders, sarcoidosis, thalassemia, and visceral Leishmaniasis. Monitoring of serum chitotriosidase activity in Gaucher disease patients during progression and therapeutic correction of their disease is useful to obtain insight in changes in body burden on pathological macrophages. However, accurate quantification of chitotriosidase levels by enzyme assay is complicated by apparent substrate inhibition, which prohibits the use of saturating substrate concentrations. We have therefore studied the catalytic features of chitotriosidase in more detail.

Chitin, the linear polymer of β 1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine, is a structural component of cell walls and coatings of many organisms. For a long time it was thought that mammals are unable to produce endoglucosaminidases that fragment chitin. Investigations on Gaucher disease led to the serendipitous discovery of a functional endogenous chitinase in man (1Hollak C.E.M. van Weely S. van Oers M.H.J. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Clin.

It was observed that serum samples from Gaucher patients show a 1000-fold elevated capacity to hydrolyze 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-chitotriose. The responsible enzyme, named chitotriosidase, was shown to be able to cleave natural chitin and a variety of artificial chitin-like substrates such as 4-methylumbelliferyl and p-nitrophenyl chitooligosaccharides. Chitotriosidase belongs to the family 18 of glycosylhydrolases and is highly homologous to chitinases from lower organisms. The enzyme consists of a N-terminal TIM-barrel structure containing the catalytic groove and a C-terminal chitin-binding domain connected by a short hinge region. The crystal structure of the 39-kDa catalytic domain and its complexes with a chitooligosaccharide and allosamidin has been described recently (4Fusetti F. von Moeller H. Houston D. Rozeboom H.J.

The structures reveal an elongated active site cleft, compatible with binding long chitin polymers. The catalytic center of chitotriosidase closely resembles that of chitinases from lower organisms like chitinase A/B from Serratia marcescens. The catalytic reaction of family chitinases takes place through a retaining mechanism, resulting in β-anomers by hydrolysis of β 1,4-glycosidic linkages. The reaction is initiated by distortion of the pyranose ring of the (–1) sugar moiety in the active site and protonation of the glycosidic oxygen by a protonated acidic residue forming a covalent oxazolinium ion intermediate. The subsequent nucleophilic attack differs from classical reaction mechanisms of retaining enzymes such as lysozyme (5Davies G.J. Mackenzie L. Varrot A. Dauter M. Brzozowski A.M. Schulein M. Withers S.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11707-11713Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) in that it involves the N-acetyl group of the (–1) sugar, rather than a carboxylate side chain on the protein, a so-called substrate-assisted mechanism (6Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C.

Chitotriosidase is selectively expressed in chronically activated tissue macrophages, like the lipid-laden storage cells that accumulate in large quantities in various tissues of Gaucher patients (8Aerts J.M. Hollak C.E. Baillieres Clin. Haematol. 1997; 10: 691-709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Tissue macrophages largely secrete newly synthesized 50-kDa chitotriosidase, but about one-third is directly routed to lysosomes and proteolytically processed to the 39-kDa unit that remains catalytically active (9Renkema G.H. Boot R.G. Strijland A Donker-koopman W.E. van den Berg M. Muijsers A.O. Aerts J.M.F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, one in every three individuals from various ethnic groups carries one abnormal chitotriosidase gene with a 24-bp duplication that prevents production of enzyme (10Boot R.G. Renkema G.H.

About 6% of the population is homozygous for this mutant allele and consequently completely lacks chitotriosidase activity. In analogy to the function of homologous chitinases in plants, the physiological role of chitotriosidase is most likely in innate immunity toward chitin containing pathogens. An increased risk for nematode infection has indeed been described for chitotriosidase-deficient individuals (11Choi E.H. Zimmerman P.A. Foster C.B. Zhu S. Kumaraswami V. Nutman T.B. Chanock S.J. Genes Immun. 2001; 2: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Pathological tissue macrophages in specific disease conditions massively express chitotriosidase. A shared feature of such cells is accumulation of lipid material in the lysosomal apparatus. The molecular mechanism that underlies the tightly controlled expression of chitotriosidase is not yet known. In serum of patients suffering from lysosomal lipid storage disorders (12Guo Y. He W.

The abnormality is exploited for diagnostic and monitoring purposes. For example, the efficacy of the extremely costly enzyme replacement therapy of Gaucher patients is monitored by following corrections in plasma chitotriosidase activity levels (8Aerts J.M.

Haematol. 1997; 10: 817-838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, accurate quantification of chitotriosidase levels by enzyme assay is prohibited by apparent substrate inhibition (1Hollak C.E.M. van Weely S. van Oers M.H.J. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1288-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). The inevitable use of subsaturating substrate concentrations reduces the reproducibility and sensitivity of the assay and has hampered its wide-scale application outside expert laboratories. We have studied the molecular basis for the apparent substrate inhibition of chitotriosidase in more detail. The information obtained allowed us to design a novel artificial substrate that can be used for a substantially improved enzyme activity assay. The results of the study are here reported and discussed. Human Recombinant 50-kDa Chitotriosidase—Enzyme was purified from the medium of stably transfected baby hamster kidneys cells using the full-length human chitotriosidase cDNA cloned in the pNUT vector (4Fusetti F. von Moeller H.

The enzyme was purified by sequential chromatofocussing, isoelectrofocussing, and gel filtration (2Renkema G.H. Boot R.G. Muijsers A.O. Donker-Koopman W.E. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2198-2202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Chitin oligosaccharides were purchased from Seikagu Kogyo. All other chemicals, including 4-methylumbelliferone, p-nitrophenol, and their conjugates with chitooligosaccharides, were purchased from Sigma, Aldrich, or Baker. Enzyme Activity Measurements—The conventional enzyme assays with commercial artificial fluorogenic or chromogenic substrates were performed exactly as described before (1Hollak C.E.M. van Weely S. van Oers M.H.J. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1288-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Briefly, enzyme preparations were incubated at 37 °C with 22 μm 4-MU 1The abbreviations used are: 4-MU, 4-methylumbelliferyl; PNP, p-nitrophenyl; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatograpy; AMCase, acidic mammalian chitinase.-chitooligosaccharides or with 220 μm PNP-chitooligosaccharides in McIlvain buffer (100 mm citric acid, 200 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.6) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The enzyme assay was stopped by addition of excess 0.3 m glycine-NaOH, pH 10.3. Formed 4-methylumbelliferone was detected fluorometrically (excitation at 445 nm; emission at 366 nm); formed PNP was detected spectrophotometrically at 405 nm. The optimal assay conditions with the newly synthesized 4-MU-(4-deoxy)chitobiose were at 114 μm in the same buffer. A 35 mm stock solution of the novel substrate was prepared in Me2SO. Chitooligosaccharide Analysis—Isocratic HPLC chromatography with a Prevail carbohydrate ES column (Alltech), and UV detection at 214 nm was used to analyze chitooligosaccharides. The injection volume was 10 μl, the flow rate of the eluent (62:28 (w/w) acetonitrile:H2O) was 1 ml/min. Synthesis of the Novel Substrate 4-MU-(4-deoxy)chitobiose—Octaacetyl chitobioside (1), prepared by acetolysis of chitin (15Inaba T. Ohgushi T. Iga T. Hasegawa E. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1984; 32: 1597-1603Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), was transformed into the partially protected disaccharide (2) according to a previously reported procedure (16Shaban M. Jeanloz R.W. Carbohydr. Res. 1971; 19: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of the acetate groups followed by regioselective introduction of the 4″-6″-benzylidene group, acetylation and final acidic removal of the benzylidene moiety, rendered 2 with a yield of 41%. Regioselective benzoylation of the 6″-hydroxyl function in 2 with 1-(benzyloxy)benzotriazole (17Kim S. Chang H. Kim W.J. J. Org. Chem. 1985; 50: 1751-1752Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and subsequent esterification with 1,1′-thiocarbonyldiimidazole rendered key intermediate 3 with a 53% yield. Barton deoxygenation (18Barton D.H.R. McCombie S.W. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1975; : 1574-1585Crossref Scopus (1973) Google Scholar) of 3 was accomplished by treatment with tributyltin hydride and a catalytic amount of azoisobutyronitrile in toluene, yielding 4″-deoxyheptaacetyl chitobioside (4) with a 72% yield. Subsequent chlorination to 5, followed by condensation with sodium 4-methylumbelliferonate, and final de-O-esterification (19Delmotte F.M. Privat J.-P.D.J. Monsigny M.L. Carbohydr. Res. 1975; 40: 353-364Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) rendered homogeneous 4-MU-(4″-deoxy)chitobiose, compound 6, with a 20% yield. Transglycosylation—The complex relationship of increasing concentrations of 4-methylumbelliferyl chitobiose, triose, and tetraose substrates with the rate of fluorescent (4-MU; 4-methylumbelliferone) product formation is depicted for pure recombinant chitotriosidase (Fig. 1). It can be seen that at higher substrate concentrations less product is formed, nearly independent of the chemical nature of the substrate. Identically shaped curves were obtained for the corresponding p-nitrophenyl substrates and the rate of colored p-nitrophenol formation (not shown). This suggests that the concentration of N-acetylglucosamine moieties at the non-reducing end of the substrate molecules is somehow critical. The finding prompted us to examine the possibility of some transglycosylation event involving these moieties. For this purpose, pure recombinant chitotriosidase was incubated with 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-N-acetylglucosamine, p-nitrophenyl chitobiose, or a combination of both compounds. Fig. 2 shows that, as expected, no fluorescent 4-MU is formed upon incubation of enzyme with both compounds separately. In sharp contrast, incubation with the mixture of both compounds results in formation of fluorescent 4-MU after a lag phase. Transglycosylation offers an attractive explanation for the outcome of the experiment, as schematically presented in Fig. 2 (right side). As an initial step, chitotriosidase removes a chitobiose moiety from the PNP-chitobiose substrate. Next, the oxazolinium transition state intermediate may either use H2O or the hydroxyl at the C-4 position in 4-MU-N-acetylglucosamine as acceptor. The latter reaction results in formation of 4-MU-chitotriose, which after some time is cleaved by chitotriosidase to yield fluorescent 4-MU.Fig. 2Demonstration of transglycosylation with artificial chitooligosaccharides. Left-hand side, recombinant 50-kDa chitotriosidase was incubated for different time periods with 2.7 mm PNP-chitobiose (A), with 1.6 mm 4-MU-N-acetylglucosamine (B), or with the mixture of both substrates (C).

Right-hand side, explanation of result.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the ability of chitotriosidase to transglycosylate natural chitooligosaccharides, pure recombinant enzyme was incubated with 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-N-acetylglucosamine and chitopentaose of p-nitrophenyl chitobiose. 10-fold larger amounts of fluorescent 4-MU are formed in the presence of chitopentaose as compared with p-nitrophenyl chitobiose, indicating that the natural oligosaccharide can act as donor in the transglycosylation reaction. Fig. 3 shows that upon incubation of 5 mm chitopentaose with recombinant chitotriosidase, not only chitobiose and chitotriose, but also chitotetraose, and even chitohexaose and chitoheptaose, are formed. Since chitotriosidase is unable to remove or add a single N-acetylglucosamine moiety, formation of chitotetraose demonstrates that chitotriosidase can exert transglycosidase activity toward chitooligosaccharides. The formation of small amounts of chitoheptaose points in the same direction. The total recovery of glucosamine units in the experiment is virtually 100%. It was noticed that meanwhile unequal amounts of chitobiose and chitotriose are formed. Apparently, the transglycosidase activity of chitotriosidase is very considerable, and predominantly chitobiose is donated to accepting chitooligosaccharides. The apparent substrate inhibition with 4-MU-chitooligosaccharide substrates can be fully explained by the transglycosidase capacity of chitotriosidase (see Scheme 1). With increasing concentration of 4-MU-chitobiose there is increasing formation of 4-MU-chitotetraose by transglycosidase activity. Chitobiose units can be subsequently transferred from 4-MU-chitotetraose to 4-MU-chitobiose molecules, a futile cycle generating no new products and not releasing fluorescent 4-MU. The experimenter observes this process as inhibition of enzyme activity, since that is monitored by formation of fluorescent 4-MU. Design and Synthesis of Novel Substrate—The realization that ongoing transglycosylation is the cause of the problems encountered with the measurement of enzymatic activity of chitotriosidase using artificial chitooligosaccharide substrates stimulated us to design a novel substrate molecule that is lacking a hydroxyl at the C-4 position of the non-reducing N-acetylglucosamine. A novel compound, 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetylglucosamine-4,1-(4-deoxy)-N-acetylglucosamine (4-MU-(4-deoxy)chitobiose) was synthesized, exactly as described under “Materials and Methods” (see Fig. 4 for its chemical structure and route of synthesis). We envisioned that this compound should only be able to act as substrate for hydrolysis but not as acceptor for transglycosylation. Fig. 5 shows for pure recombinant chitotriosidase the relationship between the rate of fluorescent 4-MU formation and the concentration of 4-MU-chitobiose and 4-MU-(4-deoxy)chitobiose, respectively. Normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics occurs with 4-MU-deoxychitobiose as substrate, sharply contrasting to the marked substrate inhibition with 4-MU-chitobiose. This finding is in accordance with the fact that the novel substrate 4-MU-deoxychitobiose cannot undergo transglycosylation.Fig. 5Chitotriosidase activity toward 4-MU-chiobiose and its deoxy variant. Human recombinant chitotriosidase was incubated for 15 min with increasing concentrations of 4-MU substrates, and released 4-MU was detected fluorometrically as described under “Materials and Methods.” Activity toward 4-MU-chitobiose (▪), activity toward 4-MU-deoxy-chiotbiose (▴) expressed in arbitrary units (Arbs).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Application of Novel Chitotriosidase Assay—The optimal enzyme activity assay conditions were determined for the novel deoxy-substrate. Maximal activity of recombinant chitotriosidase toward the substrate occurs at pH 5.6 with an apparent Km of about 50 micromolar. An assay mixture composed of 114 μm of the deoxy-substrate in 0.1/0.2 m McIlvaine buffer, pH 5.6, allows the measurement of enzyme activity at maximal rate. Production of 4-MU is directly proportional to enzyme input and linear in time over a broad range. The standard assay mixture described above also allows reliable detection of the endogenous chitotriosidase in biological samples like plasma, serum, cerebral spine fluid, urine and extracts of blood cells, cultured macrophages, and tissues (not shown). This was further substantiated by the spiking of increasing amounts of recombinant chitotriosidase in the various biological samples. Linearity with time and proportionality to sample input were also examined. For reason of maximal sensitivity, subsaturating concentrations of 4-MU-chitobiose or 4-MU-chitotriose had to be used in enzymatic assays (1Hollak C.E.M. van Weely S. van Oers M.H.J. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1288-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Although the intra-assay reproducibility with the published method is satisfactory, the inter-assay reproducibility is intrinsically poor due to unavoidable differences in precise substrate concentration. Moreover, the proportionality with enzyme input of such assays is relatively limited. In comparison with enzyme assays with the conventional 4-MU-chitobiose or 4-MU-chitotriose substrate, the enzyme assay with the novel deoxy-substrate is far more sensitive, linear in time, and directly proportional to enzyme input over a far larger range (see Fig. 6 for an illustration). Nowadays plasma chitotriosidase activity levels are determined to assist in the clinical management of Gaucher patients. Plasma chitotriosidase has evolved as an important tool in decision making in the clinic. For example, initiation of costly enzyme replacement therapy for Gaucher patients is considered in many centers when the plasma chitotriosidase level exceeds a critical threshold level and changes in activity level serve as guideline for optimalization of dosing regimens during enzyme replacement therapy of Gaucher patients (8Aerts J.M. Hollak C.E. Baillieres Clin. Haematol. 1997; 10: 691-709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 14Mistry P.K. Abrahamov A. Baillieres Clin. Haematol. 1997; 10: 817-838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Obviously, the application of plasma chitotriosidase measurements for these purposes requires highly reliable and reproducible data while monitoring patients over a large period of time. The intrinsic limitation of the current chitotriosidase activity measurement with non-constant and non-saturating concentrations of 4-MU-chitobiose or 4-MU-chitotriose as substrates is the difficulty to ensure that the measured reaction rate is reproducibly proportional to enzyme concentration (1Hollak C.E.M. van Weely S. van Oers M.H.J. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1288-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). In our experience, the only way this can be (nearly) accomplished when using the conventional 4-MU-chitooligosaccharide substrates is to vary enzyme input meticulously to obtain a fixed amount of product formation in a defined assay time period. This laborious approach implies that a sample has to be measured in duplicate at various dilutions. In sharp contrast, the assay with the novel substrate allows measurement at maximal reaction rate that is continuously proportional to enzyme concentration. The novel assay is therefore far more robust and does not require the tedious precautions associated with the current assay. A significant additional advantage of the assay with the novel substrate is the ∼5-fold increase in sensitivity of detection. This is extremely helpful for diagnostic applications in relation to a variety of disease conditions with relatively modest (2–10-fold) plasma chitotriosidase elevations like sarcoidosis, thalassemia, and lysosomal lipid storage disorders. Our demonstration of a marked transglycosidase capacity of chitotriosidase is not entirely unexpected based on some very recent literature reports. During the course of our investigation it was described that family 18 chitinases from plants and microbes are to a variable extent able to catalyze transglycosylation reactions. A comparative study revealed that plant family 18 chitinases have a (–4)(–3)(–2)(–1)(+1)(+2)-type binding cleft, while the microbial family 18 chitinases show a (–2)(–1)(+1)(+2)(+3)(+4)-type binding cleft. Transglycosylation is found in the latter, but not in the former. Soaking of human chitotriosidase crystals with chitooligosaccharides has so far not been informative in this respect. Despite carrying out the experiments at pH 10.6 hydrolysis occurred, rendering electron density maps where only an ordered N-acetylglucosamine dimer could be observed at subsites –2 and –1 (4Fusetti F. von Moeller H.

The production of recombinant human chitotriosidase with one key active site residue, Glu-140, mutated to Asp or Leu has been earlier described by us (20Renkema G.H. Boot R.G. Au F.L. Donker-Koopman W.E. Strijland A. Muijsers A.O. Hrebicek M. Aerts J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 504-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The inactive mutant protein has retained its ability to bind chitooligosaccharides in the catalytic cleft. The soaking of crystals of inactive mutant chitotriosidase with chitooligosaccharides should render a better insight in reaction mechanism and structural factors controlling enzyme function. It will be of interest to study in greater detail the prerequisites in the catalytic center of chitotriosidase to act as a transglycosidase. Informative should also be a comparison of chitotriosidase with a highly related, human gastrointestinal chitinase (21Boot R.G. Blommaart E.F. Swart E. Ghauharali-van der Vlugt K. Bijl N. Moe C.

Despite the high degree of homology with the macrophage chitotriosidase, AMCase has a number of distinct features. Interestingly, AMCase uniquely shows a dual pH optimum for hydrolysis. A second optimum of hydrolytic activity occurs at very low pH (about pH 2.0). AMCase shows a different ratio of rates of hydrolysis and transglycosylation of chitooligosaccharides. Particularly at low pH the enzyme seems less able to act as transglycosylase. This observation is consistent with the present assumption that AMCase predominantly fulfils a role as food-processing hydrolase in the stomach. The results of our investigation raise intriguing questions about the evolutionary origin and physiological significance of the transglycosidase capacity of chitotriosidase. The human chitotriosidase gene has clearly evolved from a chitinase gene in primitive organisms, and many elements have been conserved among species during evolution (10Boot R.G. Renkema G.H. Verhoek M. Strijland A. Bliek J. de Meulemeester T.M. Mannens M.M. Aerts J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25680-25685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). It is conceivable, although highly speculative, that transglycosidase activity of the primitive chitinase of the ancestral unicellular organisms allowed biosynthetic formation of increasingly larger chitooligosaccharide polymers near their surface. Prior to the evolution of the more complex, biosynthetic oligosaccharide transferases using activated sugars, the enzyme could thus have played a role in the formation of the first generations of protective coats. An interesting aspect of the transglycosidase activity of chitotriosidase is the ongoing co-formation of chitotetraose while chitin is degraded. Chitotetraose is a structure that recently receives considerable attention. Studies in plants have revealed that chitotetraose may act as signaling molecule that plays important regulatory roles (see for example Ref. 22Bakkers J. Kijne J.W. Spaink H.P. EXS (Basel). 1999; 87: 71-83PubMed Google Scholar for a recent review). Moreover there are reports that chitotetraose may influence embryogenesis in zebra fish (23Bakkers J. Semino C.E. Stroband H. Kijne J.W. Robbins P.W. Spaink H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7982-7986Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 24Semino C.E. Allende M.L. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2000; 44: 183-193PubMed Google Scholar). In view of this it might be speculated that also in man a challenge with some chitin-containing organism could result in local generation of chitotetraose and subsequently elicit further responses of local cells and the immune system. In this connection it will be of interest to examine more closely in animals the effects of administration of chitotetraose. At present it is generally believed that man completely lacks endogenous chitin and also endogenous substrates for chitinases (see for example Ref. 25Shahabuddin M. Kaslow D.C. Parasitol. Today. 1993; 9: 252-255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Our study, however, raises the question as to whether endogenous compounds act as (temporary) acceptors for chitobiose moieties transferred by chitotriosidase from chitin-containing infectious organisms. In this manner endogenous materials and cells could become decorated with chitobiose motives. Such motives could act as a marker and play a role in local remodeling events that often occur in sites of infections. In connection with this it will be of great importance to investigate in more detail the potential existence of endogenous acceptors of chitobiose moieties. Such studies should help to reveal whether the transglycosidase activity of chitotriosidase is just an evolutionary remnant or still has a physiological function in man.

https://openalex.org/W2024893903,"Pregnancy and lactation provide excellent models of physiological hyperphagia and hyperprolactinemia. To identify possible factors associated with the increased feeding in these situations, we measured hypothalamic mRNA levels of three orexigenic neuropeptides--NPY, MCH, and orexins--in nonpregnant, pregnant, and lactating rats by in situ hybridization. NPY mRNA content in the arcuate nucleus was significantly increased during pregnancy and lactation. However, MCH and prepro-orexin expression was decreased in both states. 48 or 72 h of fasting in pregnant and lactating rats further elevated NPY mRNA levels and increased the low MCH mRNA content. Surprisingly, no effect was observed in prepro-orexin mRNA levels. Finally, we investigated the possible effect of high PRL levels on these orexigenic signals using a model of hyperprolactinemia induced by pituitary graft. NPY mRNA content was unchanged, but MCH and prepro-orexin mRNA levels were significantly decreased. Our results suggest that the increased NPY expression might be partly responsible for the hyperphagia observed during pregnancy and lactation. MCH and prepro-orexin may be involved in the adaptation of other homeostatic mechanisms and their decreased levels in these physiological settings could be mediated by the elevated circulating PRL levels."
https://openalex.org/W2136448843,"The epidemic increase in type 2 diabetes can be prevented only if markers of risk can be identified and used for early intervention. We examined the clinical phenotype of individuals characterized by normal or low IRS-1 protein expression in fat cells as well as the potential molecular mechanisms related to the adipose tissue. Twenty-five non-obese individuals with low or normal IRS-1 expression in subcutaneous abdominal fat cells were extensively characterized and the results compared with 71 carefully matched subjects with or without a known genetic predisposition for type 2 diabetes. In contrast to the commonly used risk marker, known heredity for diabetes, low cellular IRS-1 identified individuals who were markedly insulin resistant, had high proinsulin and insulin levels, and exhibited evidence of early atherosclerosis measured as increased intima media thickness in the carotid artery bulb. Circulating levels of adiponectin were also significantly reduced. Gene analyses of fat cells in a parallel study showed attenuated expression of several genes related to fat cell differentiation (adiponectin, aP2, PPARgamma, and lipoprotein lipase) in the group of individuals characterized by a low IRS-1 expression and insulin resistance. A low IRS-1 expression in fat cells is a marker of insulin resistance and risk for type 2 diabetes and is associated with evidence of early vascular complications. Impaired adipocyte differentiation, including low gene expression and circulating levels of adiponectin, can provide a link between the cellular marker and the in vivo phenotype."

In this study, we characterized the signaling pathway linking oxidative stress to p53 through the platelet-derived growth factor β (PDGFβ) receptor and the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase. In response to H2O2, we observed phosphorylation of p53 specifically at serine 15, but not serine 9, 20, or 392. Phosphorylation of Ser-15 was correlated with enhanced induction and functional activation of p53 manifest as transcription of the p53 target p21 CIP / WAF. We found that H2O2 induced phosphorylation of the PDGFβ receptor and increased ATM kinase activity, two events integral to p53 activation as either AG1433 (a PDGFβ receptor inhibitor) or caffeine (an ATM kinase inhibitor) inhibited Ser-15 phosphorylation. Similarly, p53 activation by H2O2 was inhibited by kinase-inactive forms of the PDGFβ receptor or ATM. Inhibition of ATM kinase had no effect on H2O2-induced PDGFβ receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas PDGFβ receptor suppression with RNA interference impaired H2O2-induced ATM activation, indicating that ATM lies downstream to the PDGFβ receptor in this signaling cascade. Functionally, inhibition of the PDGFβ receptor abrogated the inhibition of cell proliferation, and promotion of apoptosis due to H2O2 treatment.

The rapid generation of ROS by neutrophils is an important component of their antimicrobial function that is also associated with significant cellular damage and consequent necrosis or apoptosis. In contrast, sublethal fluxes of ROS have been associated with a number of adaptive and maladaptive phenomena such as growth control (1Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar) and malignant transformation (2Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X. Sorescu D. Chung A.B. Griendling K.K. Lambeth J.D. Nature. 1999; 401: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). With the recent realization that a family of NADPH oxidase enzymes exists in mammalian cells (3Lambeth J.D. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2002; 9: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), it is likely that many other roles of ROS will come to light in the near future. Reactive oxygen species have been implicated in DNA damage by genotoxic agents such as UV and ionizing radiation or doxorubicin. Subsequent accumulation of ROS-damaged DNA is a critical event during carcinogenesis and aging (4Ames B.N. Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7915-7922Crossref PubMed Scopus (5354) Google Scholar). DNA damage triggers a variety of signaling pathways that lead either to apoptosis or to DNA damage repair that is coupled with cell cycle regulation. One junction of such pathways is controlled by the tumor suppressor protein p53, also known as a potent transcription factor. Normally, p53 is present at low levels in the cytoplasm due to its complexation with the murine double minute 2 (mdm2) protein (5Marston N.J. Crook T. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2707-2716PubMed Google Scholar), a ubiquitin ligase that modifies p53 in its C-terminal domain (6Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). Cellular stresses induce p53 phosphorylation in its N-terminal domain (7Mayr G.A. Reed M. Wang P. Wang Y. Schweds J.F.

These kinases represent a subgroup of the phosphatidylinositol kinase superfamily that broadly function in response to DNA damage or control of the cell cycle. However, the precise upstream signals responsible for N-terminal p53 phosphorylation and its activation in response to oxidative stress are not known. The goal of this study, therefore, was to examine the effect of oxidative stress on p53 with a particular emphasis on the proximal signaling pathways involved in p53 activation. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and LipofectAMINE Plus reagent were purchased from Invitrogen. Protein A/G-agarose was from Pierce. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), doxorubicin, AG1478, AG1295, AG1433, 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2), genistein, PD98059, SB203580, LY294002, caffeine, and wortmannin were obtained from Calbiochem. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone PY20) and p21 Cip1 / WAF1 antibody were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The recombinant p53 protein, anti-PDGFβ-receptor antibody, and ATM kinase antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-V5 antibody was obtained from Invitrogen. Primary antibodies directed against phosphop53 and secondary peroxidase-labeled antibodies were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were obtained from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD), grown on 0.2% gelatin-coated tissue culture plates in endothelial cell growth medium (BioWhittaker), and used between passages 2 and 5. NIH/3T3 cells and the Hs 235.Sk cell line (derived from a patient with ataxia telangiectasia) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After confluence, cells were routinely equilibrated for 30 min in HEPES-buffered physiologic salt solution containing 22 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 124 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 0.16 mm HPO4, 0.4 mm H2PO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, and 5.6 mm glucose prior to H2O2 exposure to minimize extracellular oxidation during experiments. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—After treatments, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm EDTA for 30 min on ice followed by brief sonication. Cell lysates were then cleared by centrifugation (13,600 × g) for 10 min, and the supernatants were incubated with primary antibody for 16 h at 4 °C followed by a 2-h incubation with protein A/G-agarose. Proteins were precipitated by centrifugation (13,000 × g), and pellets were washed twice with lysis buffer, twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in loading buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, and 0.2% bromphenol blue. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (12Chen K. Maines M.D. Cell. Mol. Biol. (Noisy-Le-Grand). 2000; 46: 609-617PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Cell Signaling). Densitometric analysis of Western blots was performed using commercially available software (PDI Imageware System, Huntington Station, NY). Plasmids—Constructs of wild-type ATR (ATR-WT) and kinase-dead ATR point mutant (ATR-KD) were kindly provided by Dr. Paul Ngheim (Harvard University) (13Nghiem P. Park P.K. Kim Y.Y. Desai B.N. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian expression vectors harboring full-length ATM cDNA (ATM-WT) and kinase-dead (D2879A/N2884K/D2898A) ATM cDNA (ATM-KD) were kindly provided by Dr. Brendan Price (Dana Farber Cancer Institute) (14Turenne G.A. Paul P. Laflair L. Price B.D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5100-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We constructed a dominant-negative form of the murine PDGFβ receptor lacking the intracellular signaling domain (Δ563–1098) based on the mouse sequence (15Cartel N.J. Liu J. Wang J. Post M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L786-L798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from NIH/3T3 cells, and reverse transcription (RT)PCR was performed as described (16Chen K. Vita J.A. Berk B.C. Keaney Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16045-16050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) with forward (5′-ATG GGG CTT CCA GGA GTG A-3′) and reverse (5′-CTC ATA GCG TGG CTT CTT CTG C-3′) primers. The predicted 1,686-bp PCR product was then subcloned into mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO (Invitrogen). The orientation and nucleotide sequence of the inserted fragment were confirmed by DNA sequencing (ABI PRISM 377, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A control plasmid was constructed in which the 1,686-bp product was subcloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO in the reverse orientation. The truncated form inhibited PDGF-mediated PDGFβ receptor phosphorylation by ∼50%, whereas the control plasmid had no effect (data not shown). For the vector expressing a hairpin small interfering RNA (siRNA) against PDGFβ receptor, we designed a double-stranded oligonucleotide (5′-TCG AGG TAC CAG CAG GTA GAT GAG GAG TAC TGC TCA TCT ACC TGC TGG TAC TTT TT-3′ and 5′-CTA GAA AAA GTA CCA GCA GGT AGA TGA GCA GTA CTC CTC ATC TAC CTG CTG GTA CC-3′) that was synthesized by Invitrogen and subsequently ligated into the SalI/XbaI site of pSuppressorNeo (Imgenex, San Diego, CA). The plasmid construct was then confirmed by sequencing. ATM Kinase Assay—ATM kinase activity was measured by immune complex assay using recombinant p53 as the substrate. After various treatments, cells were lysed, and ATM kinase was immunoprecipitated with anti-ATM antibody as described above. Washed immunoprecipitates were then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 30 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm MnCl2, supplemented with 2 μg of p53 protein and 200 μm ATP. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 3× gel loading buffer (150 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 6% SDS, 600 mm dithiothreitol, 30% glycerol, and 0.6% bromphenol blue), and samples were boiled for 3 min prior to SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation of p53 was determined by Western blotting (as described above) with antibody specific for the phospho-p53 at Ser-15). Transfections and RT-PCR—In transfection experiments, cells at 60% confluence were incubated in Opti-MEM medium containing 2 μg of plasmid as a LipofectAMINE Plus-DNA complex for 5 h. The medium was then changed to fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and the cells were incubated for 30 h prior to experimentation. The procedures for semiquantitative RT-PCR were essentially as described (17Chen K. Inoue M. Okada A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The forward and reverse primers corresponding to human p53 and p21 Cip1 / WAF1 were 5′-ACA GCC AAG TCT GTG ACT T-3′ and 5′-CAC GCA CCT CAA AGC TGT T-3′; and 5′-GCT GGG GAT GTC CGT CAG AA-3′ and 5′-GAG CGA GGC ACA AGG GTA CAA-3′, respectively. Constitutively expressed glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was amplified with forward (5′-ACA GTC CAT GCC ATC ACT GCC-3′) and reverse (5′-AGG AAA TGA GCT TGA CAA AGT-3′) primers in a similar fashion. Cell Proliferation Assay—Cell proliferation in response to H2O2 was determined with the bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) proliferation assay kit (Oncogene, San Diego, CA) to detect the incorporation of BrdUrd into cells. Briefly, BrdUrd was added to HUVECs or NIH/3T3 cells treated with H2O2 or vehicle in 96-well platesfollowed by a 4-h incubation before the cells were fixed for enzyme immunoassay according to the manufacturer's instructions. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Apoptosis—An annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate kit (Oncogene) was used to detect the apoptosis. Briefly, non-adherent and adherent cells, harvested by trypsinization, were pooled, washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 4% bovine serum albumin). Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (0.5 μg/ml) and propidium iodide (0.6 μg/ml) were then added to a 250-μl aliquot (∼5 × 106 cells) of this cell suspension. After a 15-min incubation in the dark at room temperature, stained cells were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry (MoFlo®, Dako Cytomation, Fort Collins, CO). Statistical Analysis—All blots are representative of 3–4 experiments. Comparisons among treatment groups were performed with one-way analysis of variance and a post hoc Dunnett's or Student's Newman-Keuls comparison as appropriate. Statistical significance was accepted if the null hypothesis was rejected with p < 0.05. H2O2-induced p53 Phosphorylation in HUVECs Does Not Involve Non-receptor Protein Tyrosine Kinases, ERK, p38, or Phosphoinositide 3-kinase—We exposed HUVECs to H2O2 and observed time- and concentration-dependent p53 phosphorylation on Ser-15 (Fig. 1, A and B) without any phosphorylation on serine residues 9, 20, or 392 at any concentration of H2O2 (data not shown). H2O2 treatment was also associated with an increase in endothelial cell content of both p53 and its target, p21 Cip1 / WAF1 (Fig. 1C). Examination of mRNA levels for p53 and p21 Cip1 / WAF1 under the same conditions demonstrated no effect of H2O2 on p53 mRNA but a significant increase in p21 Cip1 / WAF1 mRNA (Fig. 1D). These data suggest that phosphorylation of p53 on serine 15 stabilizes the protein leading to transcription of target genes, such as p21 Cip1 / WAF1. Although some cellular responses to H2O2 involve activation of non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases such as Src (16Chen K. Vita J.A. Berk B.C. Keaney Jr., J.F. J. Biol.

H2O2-induced p53 Phosphorylation Involves the ATM Kinase—Phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-15 is regulated, in part, by DNA-dependent kinase, ATM kinase (8Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar, 20Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D.

Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). To probe the mechanism of H2O2-mediated p53 phosphorylation, we treated HUVECs with either wortmannin or caffeine, two structurally distinct inhibitors of ATM and ATR (22Ryan K.M. Phillips A.C. Vousden K.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 23Hall-Jackson C.A. Cross D.A. Morrice N. Smythe C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6707-6713Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We found that both inhibitors limited H2O2-mediated p53 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). To distinguish between the involvement of ATR or ATM, we utilized transient transfection experiments and found that expression of a kinase-dead ATM mutant in NIH/3T3 cells significantly attenuated H2O2-induced p53 phosphorylation, whereas analogous experiments with ATR transfection had no effect (Fig. 2B). Consistent with these results, Hs235.Sk cells (derived from a patient with ataxia telangiectasia) demonstrated impaired H2O2-mediated p53 phosphorylation that was corrected via transfection with wild-type ATM (Fig. 2C). Thus, H2O2-mediated p53 phosphorylation involves ATM, but not ATR. H2O2-induced p53 Phosphorylation Involves the PDGFβ Receptor—Although ATM kinase involvement in p53 phosphorylation is well known, the upstream signals involved in this process remain unknown. Since cellular stress induced by UV irradiation or osmotic shock involves growth factor receptor transactivation (24Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar), we probed PDGFβ receptor involvement with AG1433 and observed significant inhibition of H2O2-induced p53 phosphorylation that was not evident with AG1478, an inhibitor of ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases (Fig. 3A). In NIH/3T3 cells transfected with a truncated form of the PDGFβ receptor lacking the kinase domain, we also observed impaired p53 Ser-15 phosphorylation in response to H2O2, whereas control plasmid had no effect (Fig. 3B). We also found that H2O2-induced and ligand-induced activation of the PDGFβ receptor were distinct as the latter produced robust PDGFβ receptor tyrosine phosphorylation without phosphorylation of p53, whereas H2O2 produced only modest receptor tyrosine phosphorylation with profound p53 phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). Thus, H2O2-mediated p53 phosphorylation involves PDGFβ receptor transactivation that is distinct from ligand-induced receptor activation. H2O2-mediated Activation of ATM and p53 Involves PDGFβ Receptor Transactivation—HUVECs exposed to H2O2 exhibited rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβ receptor that was inhibited by AG1433, but not caffeine (Fig. 4A), suggesting that receptor transactivation does not involve ATM. H2O2-treated HUVECs demonstrated ATM kinase activation that was attenuated by either AG1433 or caffeine (Fig. 4B) indicating that ATM kinase activation involves PDGFβ receptor kinase activity. To confirm this contention, we utilized an siRNA plasmid to inhibit PDGFRβ expression in NIH/3T3 cells that resulted in reduced p53 phosphorylation and ATM kinase activity in response to H2O2 (Fig. 4C). This link between the PDGFβ receptor and H2O2-induced ATM kinase activation has implications for p53 function as the H2O2-induced increase in both cellular p53 and p21 Cip1 / WAF1 was completely abrogated by either AG1433 or caffeine (Fig. 4, D and E). DNA Damage-induced p53 Phosphorylation Is Partially Dependent upon the PDGFβ Receptor and ATM Kinase—To determine whether the PDGFβ receptor transactivation was generally a feature of DNA damage, we exposed HUVECs to solar UV light that is known to induce p53 phosphorylation through an ROS-dependent mechanism (25Vile G.F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) involving ATM (26Zhang Y. Ma W.Y. Kaji A. Bode A.M. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3124-3131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We observed phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 in response to UV irradiation that was significantly inhibited by catalase (Fig. 5, A and B), confirming that this process was partially ROS-dependent. We also found that UV-induced p53 phosphorylation also involved the PDGFβ receptor and ATM kinase as it was significantly attenuated by AG1433 and caffeine, respectively. Thus, PDGFβ receptor-mediated ATM kinase activation appears to be one response of cells to oxidative stress. Activation of the PDGFβ Receptor/p53 Pathway by H2O2 Involves Cell Growth Arrest and Apoptosis—The p53 protein is best known for its role in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress (27Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6673) Google Scholar). To investigate the functional consequences of H2O2-induced p53 activation, we examined cell proliferation by BrdUrd incorporation in H2O2-exposed NIH/3T3 cells and HUVECs. We found that cell proliferation was significantly inhibited by H2O2, and this effect was significantly attenuated by AG1433 in NIH/3T3 cells (Fig. 6A) and HUVECs (data not shown). To confirm these results, we suppressed NIH/3T3 cell PDGFβ receptor expression with siRNA and observed qualitatively similar protection against H2O2-induced initial growth arrest as with AG1433 (Fig. 6B). To investigate H2O2-induced apoptosis and necrosis, we used flow cytometric analysis of phosphatidylserine externalization (by fluorescence-labeled annexin V binding) and propidium iodide uptake and found that H2O2 treatment (100 μm) of HUVECs for 12 h increased the number of both early apoptotic and late apoptotic/necrotic cells, and this effect was significantly attenuated by AG1433 (Fig. 6, C and D). Similar results were observed in NIH/3T3 cells treated with 250 μm H2O2 (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that the PDGFβ receptor is involved in p53-dependent growth arrest and apoptosis induced by H2O2. The main aspect of the work reported here is that H2O2 activates p53 in endothelial cells through transactivation of the PDGFβ receptor and subsequent ATM kinase activation. We found that H2O2 produced rapid phosphorylation of p53 only on Ser-15, and this post-translational modification facilitated endothelial cell p53 accumulation, and that p53-dependent transcriptional activation manifests as increased p21 Cip1 / WAF1 mRNA and protein. We found no evidence for non-receptor tyrosine kinases, MAP kinases, or phosphoinositide 3-kinase in H2O2-induced endothelial cell p53 phosphorylation. Taken together, the data presented here implicate both the PDGFβ receptor and ATM kinase in the cellular response to oxidative stress. Mutation of the ATM kinase leads to ataxia telangiectasia, a multisystem genetic disorder with high incidence of cancer. Studies have also shown that ATM is a key regulator of multiple signaling cascades that respond to DNA damage (28Rotman G. Shiloh Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1555-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). However, the precise signals leading to ATM kinase activation remain poorly understood. The data presented here indicate the PDGFβ receptor is an important upstream signal for activation of the ATM kinase. We found that pharmacologic inhibition of the PDGFβ receptor (Fig. 3A) and lack of PDGFβ receptor kinase activity (Fig. 3, B and C) both limited H2O2-induced p53 phosphorylation mediated by the ATM kinase. Consistent with these findings, we also observed inhibition of solar UV-induced p53 phosphorylation (Fig. 5A), a process known to involve the ATM kinase (26Zhang Y. Ma W.Y. Kaji A. Bode A.M. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3124-3131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, the data presented here point to a previously unrecognized role of the PDGFβ receptor in control of ATM kinase activation. There is some precedent for participation of the PDGF receptor in redox-sensitive signal transduction. Treatment of mesangial cells (29Gonzalez-Rubio M. Voit S. Rodriguez-Puyol D. Weber M. Marx M. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 164-173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) or fibroblasts (30Min D.S. Kim E.G. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29986-29994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) with H2O2 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβ receptor. Moreover, stimulation of smooth muscle cells with angiotensin II results in PDGFβ receptor activation (31Linseman D.A. Benjamin C.W. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12563-12568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), and this process is inhibited by anti-oxidants (32Heeneman S. Haendeler J. Saito Y. Ishida M. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15926-15932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We observed that PDGFβ receptor transactivation by H2O2 is distinct from ligand-induced PDGFβ receptor signaling as authentic PDGF-BB failed to induce p53 Ser-15 phosphorylation (Fig. 3D). These data are consistent with a previous report by Heeneman et al. (32Heeneman S. Haendeler J. Saito Y. Ishida M. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15926-15932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) that angiotensin II-induced transactivation of the PDGFβ receptor differs significantly from receptor activation by PDGF-BB. That study demonstrated that ROS-mediated PDGFβ transactivation in response to angiotensin II was highly dependent upon receptor association with the p66 adaptor protein Shc. In particular, the population of Shc-PDGFβ receptor complexes transactivated by angiotensin II was in a cellular compartment distinct from the Shc-PDGFβ complexes activated by PDGF-BB (32Heeneman S. Haendeler J. Saito Y. Ishida M. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15926-15932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Transactivation of this Shc-associated PDGFβ receptor by angiotensin II did not involve Src family kinases (32Heeneman S. Haendeler J. Saito Y. Ishida M. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15926-15932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), consistent with the results reported here for H2O2-induced PDGFβ receptor transactivation (Fig. 1E). The notion that Shc-associated PDGFβ receptors are subject to redox-sensitive transactivation is supported by observations that p66 Shc -deficient cells exhibit impaired p53 and p21 Cip1 / WAF1 responses to oxidative stress (33Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolfi P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1999; 402: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). The precise nature of PDGFβ receptor transactivation by H2O2, a two-electron oxidant, is not clear. In biologic systems, H2O2 typically reacts with reduced thiols to produce the corresponding disulfide or sulfenic acid (34Pryor W.A. Frei B. Natural Antioxidants in Human Health and Disease. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 1-124Google Scholar), an activity that is particularly germane to activation of tyrosine kinases since H2O2 reversibly inactivates protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) both in vitro (35Denu J.M. Tanner K.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5633-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 36Caselli A. Marzocchini R. Camici G. Manao G. Moneti G. Pieraccini G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32554-32560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and in cells (37Lee S.R. Kwon K.S. Kim S.R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15366-15372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 38Meng T.C. Fukada T. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 387-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). In light of these data, many have speculated that H2O2 signaling is mediated through the inactivation of PTPs. Consistent with this notion, mitogenic signaling in response to PDGF in Rat-1 cells involves H2O2 generation and requires inhibition of the PTP, SHP-2 (38Meng T.C. Fukada T. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 387-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Whether the data reported here linking H2O2-induced ATM activation to PDGFβ receptor transactivation involve PTPs is not clear at the present time. The data presented here point to the ATM kinase as an important component of the cellular response to oxidative stress. Indeed, loss of ATM kinase function produces increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation (39Savitsky K. Bar-Shira A. Gilad S. Rotman G. Ziv Y. Vanagaite L. Tagle D.A. Smith S. Uziel T. Sfez S. Ashkenazi M. Pecker I. Frydman M. Harnik R. Sankhavaram R.P. Simmons A. Clines G.A. Sartiel A. Gatti R.A. Chessa L. Sanal O. Lavin M.F. Jaspers N.G.J. Taylor A.M.R. Arlett C.F. Miki T. Weissman S.M. Lovett M. Collins F.S. Shiloh Y. Science. 1995; 268: 1749-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (2345) Google Scholar), a known source of oxidative stress. As compared with normal cells, cultured ATM-deficient cells also exhibit sensitivity to other oxidants such as nitric oxide, H2O2, and superoxide, further supporting the notion that ATM kinase is a component of the cellular oxidative stress response (40Vuillaume M. Best-Belpomme M. Lafont R. Hubert M. Decroix Y. Sarasin A. Carcinogenesis. 1989; 10: 1375-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 41Green M.H. Marcovitch A.J. Harcourt S.A. Lowe J.E.

Mutagen. 1994; 24: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, p53 Ser-15 phosphorylation by ATM is a feature of reoxygenation after hypoxia that is mediated by ROS (43Hammond E.M. Dorie M.J. Giaccia A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12207-12213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Barlow et al. (44Barlow C. Dennery P.A. Shigenaga M.K. Smith M.A. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J. Wynshaw-Boris A. Levine R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9915-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) have extended such observations to mice lacking the ATM kinase that exhibit evidence for increased oxidative damage to proteins and lipids. Despite these data linking ATM kinase activation to the cellular adaptation to oxidative stress, the specific signal(s) for ATM kinase activation are not yet clear. In this regard, the data presented here add to this body of knowledge as we have implicated PDGFβ receptor transactivation as an upstream mediator of ATM kinase stimulation in response to both H2O2 (Fig. 4) and UV irradiation (Fig. 5). In addition, we found that PDGFβ receptor transactivation was involved in H2O2-mediated growth arrest (Fig. 6, A and B), apoptosis, and necrosis (Fig. 6, C and D), all downstream effects of p53 activation (27Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6673) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism whereby the PDGFβ receptor signals to ATM kinase is unknown but could involve intermediate(s) as we were unable to demonstrate any ATM kinase/PDGFβ receptor complex formation using immunoprecipitation (data not shown). In this study, one consequence of ATM kinase activation we observed was p53 phosphorylation only at Ser-15, a post-translational modification typically associated with DNA damage. In this regard, one common mechanism of ATM kinase activation involves DNA damage through diverse stimuli such as ionizing radiation (20Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1677-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1684) Google Scholar), UV irradiation (26Zhang Y. Ma W.Y. Kaji A. Bode A.M. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3124-3131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), or anthracycline treatment (45Lin W.C. Lin F.T. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1833-1844PubMed Google Scholar). Given that H2O2 is known to produce DNA damage and strand breaks (46Wang R.J. Ananthaswamy H.N. Nixon B.T. Hartman P.S. Eisenstark A. Radiat. Res. 1980; 82: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), it is plausible that H2O2-induced ATM kinase activation is mediated via DNA damage. Although the precise link between DNA damage and PDGFβ receptor transactivation is not clear at this time, it is interesting to note that the stimuli listed above have also been linked to the intracellular generation of ROS, lending plausibility to the notion that multiple stimuli for DNA damage are associated with ROS-mediated growth factor transactivation. In summary, the data presented here indicate that oxidative stress in the form of H2O2 leads to p53 phosphorylation on Ser-15, resulting in p53 stabilization and the transcription of the p53 target, p21 Cip1 / WAF1. Moreover, the phosphorylation of p53 was limited to Ser-15 and involved the activation of ATM kinase through a PDGFβ receptor-dependent pathway. These data suggest a new role for the PDGFβ receptor in the cellular response to stress. We thank Hui Xiao for technical assistance.

https://openalex.org/W2128129967,"The enzyme 5alpha-reductase (5alpha-R) is present in many mammalian tissues, including the brain. The physiological importance of 5alpha-R in the brain derives from its capability to convert testosterone (T) to a more potent androgen, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and to convert progesterone and deoxycorticosterone (DOC) to their respective 5alpha-reduced derivatives, precursors of allopregnanolone and tetrahydroDOC, potent allosteric modulators of the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABA(A)-R). 5alpha-R occurs as two isoforms, 5alpha-R type 1 (5alpha-R1) and 5alpha-R type 2 (5alpha-R2). We studied the effects of T and DHT on the mRNA levels of both 5alpha-R isozymes in the prefrontal cortex of the adult rat, using an accurate and precise method that combines the high specificity of one-step quantitative RT-PCR with the sensitivity of capillary electrophoresis. Our results demonstrate that both isozymes of 5alpha-R are expressed in the cerebral cortex of adult rats. The gene expression of 5alpha-R type 2 is under the positive control of T and DHT. The gene that codes for 5alpha-R type 1 is not constitutive, because its expression is negatively regulated by T and DHT. These results open up a new research line that may lead to a better understanding of the role of 5alpha-R isozymes in the physiology of the central nervous system."

Comparative sequence analysis suggests that centrins consist of two structural domains, each containing two putative Ca2+-binding EF-hand motifs. In humans, three centrin isoforms (HsCen1 to HsCen3) have been identified so far (3Errabolu R. Sanders M.A. Salisbury J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 9-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Lee V.D.

HsCen1 and HsCen2 are highly similar to each other (sequence identity 84%) and to the algae centrin (68 and 71%, respectively), whereas HsCen3, discovered lately (5Middendorp S. Paoletti A. Schiebel E. Bornens M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9141-9146Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), has a more distant sequence; it shows only 54% identity with both HsCen1 and HsCen2, and is slightly closer to Cdc31, the centrin equivalent in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (59% sequence identity). A large part of the sequence diversity among the centrins occurs within the first 20 residues of the N-terminal domain, that have no counterpart in the “standard” Ca2+-binding protein, CaM.The centrins are usually found in association with the microtubule organizing centers (centrosomes in animal cells, and spindle pole bodies in yeast) that are cytoplasmic organelles encountered in almost all eukaryotic cells, with an important role in microtubule structural and temporal organization (1Schiebel E. Bornens M. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 197-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 2Salisbury J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). HsCen2 is ubiquitously expressed but was first discovered in the distal lumen of centrioles, where its presence is required for normal centriole duplication during the cell cycle (6Salisbury J.L. Suino K.M. Busby R. Springett M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1287-1292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). A large fraction of the cellular centrin is not permanently associated with the centrosome (7Paoletti A. Moudjou M. Paintrand M. Salisbury J.L. Bornens M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 3089-3102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but fractionates with the cytoplasm and nuclei in human cells. The precise function of these pools is not well understood and constitutes a subject of intense investigation. For instance, the presence of HsCen2 in the nuclear fractions is thought to play a role in coordinating the nuclear and cytoplasm events during the division cycles. Recently, studies conducted in the Hanaoka group (8Araki M. Masutani C. Takemura M. Uchida A. Sugasawa K. Kondoh J. Ohkuma Y. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18665-18672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) shed a new light on the possible role of nuclear HsCen2 fraction in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) process. Nuclear excision repair is a major pathway for recognition and removal of bulky DNA lesions such as the UV photoproducts, or carcinogen adducts. Its dysfunction produces severe disorders in humans such as xeroderma pigmentosum, a hereditary disease characterized by a high photosensitivity and a large incidence of sunlight-induced cancer. One of the molecular component involved in several xeroderma pigmentosum forms is the XPC complex, a heterodimer composed of the XPC gene product (XPC) and HR23B, the human homologue of yeast Rad23 B. XPC complex plays a key role in the initial phase of NER and is involved in the recognition of the DNA damage. NER is of great importance for the maintenance of the genomic integrity, but the molecular mechanism of the NER pathway involving damage recognition, excision, gap-filling, and ligation steps has not been elucidated (9Benhamou S. Sarasin A. Mutat. Res. 2000; 462: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).According to the recent work of Araki et al. (8Araki M. Masutani C. Takemura M. Uchida A. Sugasawa K. Kondoh J. Ohkuma Y. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18665-18672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), the XPC complex may contain an additional component, HsCen2, which, together with HR23B, stabilizes in a cooperative manner XPC, and thus stimulates the NER activity in vitro. This observation opens a new field of investigation of the centrin cellular functions, with the possibility that centrin may fill the gap between the DNA nuclear repair process and the functions of the mitotic spindle apparatus.Recent biochemical and biophysical studies performed in our and other laboratories have provided a wealth of physicochemical data on the structure and Ca2+ binding properties of centrins of various origins. From this, in agreement with the sequence alignment analysis, it appears that the integral centrins are composed of two independent domains, each containing two putative EF-hand motifs (10Matei E.

The next step in this direction is the search for specific molecular targets and exploration of conformational, energetic, and functional aspects of the corresponding intermolecular interactions.In this work, we focused on a sequence-based identification of the XPC binding site to HsCen2 and on the thermodynamic and structural characterization of the intermolecular interactions. ITC experiments showed that one of the two predicted binding peptides derived from XPC binds with high affinity to HsCen2, the isolated HsCen2 C-terminal domain, and CaM. In all cases, the peptide binding is Ca2+-dependent, but stoichiometry and molecular mechanism seem to be different for centrin and CaM. CD and preliminary NMR experiments enabled us to characterize some structural aspects of the complex between one XPC peptide and the C-terminal domain of HsCen2.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—Recombinant proteins HsCen2 and SC-HsCen2 (Thr94-Tyr172) were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (10Matei E.

Cox J.A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For 15N-labeled samples, we used a culture medium (M9) containing 15NH4Cl (1.5 g/liter) as the sole source of nitrogen, and the induction step with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.1 mm) was prolonged to 18 h.Target Peptides—Two peptides from the human XPC protein, encompassing the sequences Asn847-Arg863 (P1-XPC) and Pro703-Ala720 (P2-XPC) were purchased from Biofidal (Vaulx en Velin, France). Purity was greater than 95%, as assessed by high pressure liquid chromatography analysis.CD Spectroscopy—CD experiments were performed on a Jasco 715 CD spectrometer equipped with a Peltier temperature control unit. Far-UV spectra were recorded between 195 and 250 nm at 20 °C using 1-mm quartz cells. Spectra were collected as an average of four scans, with a scan speed of 20 nm/min and a response time of 1 s. Samples (30 μm) were dissolved in Tris-HCl buffer (10 mm) containing 100 mm NaCl and 2 mm CaCl2. Temperature denaturation curves were obtained between 20 and 95 °C, with a temperature increasing rate of 1 °C/min.Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Thermodynamic parameters of molecular interactions between human centrin or calmodulin and the target peptides at 30 °C were investigated by ITC using a MicroCal MCS instrument (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA). The proteins and peptides were equilibrated in the same buffer containing 20 mm Tris (or BisTris), pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, and Ca2+ (2 mm) or EDTA (5 mm). In a standard experiment, the protein (7-20 μm) in the 1.337-ml calorimeter cell was titrated by the peptide (generally 10 times more concentrated) by ∼30 successive automatic injections of 7-10 μl each. The first injection of 2-3 μl was ignored in the final data analysis. Integration of the peaks corresponding to each injection and correction for the base line were done using Origin-based software provided by the manufacturer. Fitting of the data to various interaction models results in the stoichiometry (n), equilibrium binding constant (K a), and enthalpy of complex formation (ΔH). The reported thermodynamic parameters represent an average of at least two experiments. Usually, control experiments, consisting of injecting peptide solutions into the buffer, were performed to evaluate the heat of dilution.NMR Spectroscopy—NMR samples (0.7-1.2 mm) were obtained by dissolving the lyophilized protein in deuterated Tris-HCl buffer (20 mm, pH 6.5) containing 100 mm NaCl and 5 mm CaCl2. NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity 500 NMR spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance probe and a Z-field gradient, at 308 K. Homonuclear and heteronuclear [15N-1H]HSQC two-dimensional spectra in 1H2O were performed using standard pulse sequences (13Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids.

Spectra analysis was carried out using Felix software (Accelrys, San Diego, CA).RESULTSPrediction of the Centrin Binding Site of XPC Protein—The available structural and functional data consistently suggest that HsCen2 is a sensor protein, capable to translate a Ca2+ cellular signal into an activation/inhibition of a target molecule (10Matei E. Miron S. Blouquit Y. Duchambon P. Durussel I. Cox J.A. Craescu C.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1439-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). CaM, the prototype of the Ca2+ sensor proteins, has a large and diverse number of known target proteins, analysis of which revealed some molecular characteristics of the CaM-binding sites, including α-helix propensity and the basic amphiphilic character (15O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 16Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 17Yap K.L. Kim J. Truong K. Sherman M. Youan T. Ikura M. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2001; 1: 8-14Crossref Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Recently, a web-based data base containing the known CaM target sequences and their properties, as well as sequence analysis tools permitting to predict putative CaM binding sites within a given protein sequence, has been developed (17Yap K.L. Kim J. Truong K. Sherman M. Youan T. Ikura M. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2001; 1: 8-14Crossref Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Assuming that CaM and HsCen2 binding sites may share common molecular features, we proceeded to an analysis of the XPC sequence using these tools. Sequence comparison failed to find any region in the XPC protein sharing significant sequence homology with known CaM binding sites but did predict two sequences with a good probability as putative CaM binding sites. The two peptides (P1-XPC, Asn847-Arg863; and P2-XPC, Pro703-Ala720), situated in the last quarter of the XPC sequence (Fig. 1A), were associated with the moderate to excellent score of probability (9 and 6 for P1-XPC and P2-XPC, respectively). Sequence comparison with classical CaM binding motifs suggests that the peptides belong to the 1-14 class, including the recognition sites of myosin light chain kinase, CaM kinase IV, calcineurin A, and human death-associated kinase I. P1-XPC is predicted to be the best binding sequence with a pattern of bulky hydrophobic side chains at positions 1, 5, 8, and 14 and a good propensity to form an amphiphilic α-helix (Fig. 1A). It is worth noting that P1-XPC together with Cdc31 binding peptide Kar1 include negatively charged side chains, whereas the CaM-binding peptides are generally positively charged (16Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar).Binding to HsCen2 and Its C-terminal Domain—Binding of the P1-XPC and P2-XPC peptides was studied using the ITC method with the protein solution in the cell and the peptides in the syringe. As illustrated in the thermograms of Fig. 2, successive injections of the peptides are accompanied by exothermic heat pulses for which the integral decreases to a stable base line. In the presence of saturating Ca2+ concentrations, the data analysis indicates that the integral protein HsCen2 binds the P1-XPC peptide with a stoichiometry of 1:1 and a high affinity K a = 2.2 (±0.4) × 108m-1 (K d = 4.5 nm). The large reaction enthalpy of approximately -27 kcal/mol largely overcomes the entropic component to the free energy of interaction (Table I). The short C-terminal domain SC-HsCen2 binds the peptide with a similar stoichiometry, affinity, and binding enthalpy, strongly suggesting that it represents the major interacting domain. Indeed, the free energy of P1-XPC binding to SC-HsCen2 represents 97% of the binding energy of the intact protein. In the absence of Ca2+, both the integral protein and the SC-HsCen2 domain are still able to bind exothermally the peptide, but with a considerably decreased affinity (28 and 17 times, respectively) (Fig. 2 and Table I).Fig. 2Binding of P1-XPC to HsCen2 and SC-HsCen2. Figure shows typical ITC experiments in the presence (2 mm CaCl2) and in the absence of Ca2+ (5 mm EDTA). The upper part of each graphic shows the thermogram whereas the lower part shows the fitted binding isotherm. The protein at 10 μm concentration was placed into the temperature-controlled cell, and the peptide (100 μm) was placed into a syringe immersed into the cell.

Open table in a new tab In the case of P2-XPC, the heat rate is very small and remains roughly constant during the titration (Fig. 3), failing to show the typical transition phase observed for interacting systems. This observation indicates the absence of binding, or a very weak binding (K a < 103m-1), that cannot be detected in the present conditions. Therefore, in agreement with the knowledge-based prediction, HsCen2/Ca2+, mainly through its C-terminal domain, exhibits a strong binding to one of the two putative CaM binding sites situated in the C-terminal part of the XPC protein.Fig. 3Titration of CaM and HsCen2 by P2-XPC.

Note the difference in scale of the heat rate between the first panel and the next two panels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Analysis of the free energy components (Table I) shows that the decrease in binding energy in the absence of Ca2+ is the result of an increase of the unfavorable entropic contribution, only partially compensated by the increase in enthalpy. This trend is characteristic both for the intact protein and the short C-terminal construct, and it may be related to the fact that, in the absence of Ca2+, the C-terminal domain represents an ensemble of highly disordered conformations (10Matei E. Miron S. Blouquit Y. Duchambon P. Durussel I. Cox J.A. Craescu C.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1439-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), stabilization of which upon complex formation gives a negative entropic contribution.Measurement of the temperature dependence of the binding enthalpy allowed us to evaluate the heat capacity changes (ΔC p) caused by protein/peptide interactions. For the complexes of P1-XPC with HsCen2 and SC-HsCen2, the negative binding enthalpy increases significantly when the temperature varies between 20 and 34 °C. The heat capacity, calculated as the correlation coefficient between ΔH and temperature, has large negative values (-995 ± 78 and -366 ± 49 cal/K mol for HsCen2 and SC-HsCen2, respectively) that correspond to the upper range of values observed for CaM/target peptides (18Wintrode P.L. Privalov P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 1050-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 19Brokx R.D. Lopez M.M. Vogel H.J. Makhatadze G.I. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 14083-14091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) that, among the CaM binding peptides, the heat capacity changes were more negative for those exhibiting a primary interaction with the C-terminal protein domain and having a bulk aromatic side chain in the peptide N-side, as is the case for P1-XPC. Empirical observations in a number of cases pointed to the existence of a linear correlation between the interaction-induced heat capacity changes and the accompanying decrease in the water-accessible surface area (20Baker B.M. Murphy K.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 21Luque I. Todd M.J. Gomez J. Semo N. Ernesto F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5791-5797Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The corresponding dehydration results in a positive entropic contribution, essentially caused by the released water molecules. Therefore, the negative heat capacity changes observed in this work should be associated with a major contribution of aliphatic and aromatic side chains to the total decrease of the accessible surface area upon complex formation (22Makhatadze G.I. Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 307-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with the large hydrophobic surface exposed by the C-terminal domain of HsCen2 in the presence of Ca2+ ions (10Matei E. Miron S. Blouquit Y. Duchambon P. Durussel I. Cox J.A. Craescu C.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1439-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and is consistent with a largely apolar protein/peptide interface. An additional factor that may account for the large negative values of the heat capacity changes observed upon P1-XPC complex formation is the significant conformational changes of both partners, as was suggested for many protein/DNA interactions (23Spolar R.S. Record Jr., M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar).We also performed titration calorimetric experiments to measure the interaction between HsCen2 and melittin, a natural peptide extracted from the bee venom often used as a CaM-binding peptide. In the presence of Ca2+, the binding is weaker than for P1-XPC (K a = 1.6 × 107m-1) but is still driven by a negative enthalpy change (ΔH = -8 kcal/mol, at 30 °C).Binding to Calmodulin—The two XPC peptides used in the present work have been selected based on the CaM target consensus sequence, and the hypothesis that proteins from the EF-hand superfamily may share similar targets. On the other hand, CaM and centrins could be observed in the same cellular regions (24Li C.-J. Heim R. Lu P. Pu Y. Tsien R.Y. Chang D.C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1567-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Moser M.J. Flory M.R. Davis T.N. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1805-1812Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Moisoi N. Erent M. Whyte S. Martin S. Bayley P.M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2367-2379PubMed Google Scholar), where proteins possessing CaM-binding motifs (27Flory M.R. Moser M.J. Monnat Jr., R.J. Davis T.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5919-5923Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 28Matsumoto Y. Maller J.L. Science. 2002; 295: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) were identified. This raised the question of the possible promiscuity in recognition and binding of the molecular targets by the two EF-hand proteins, and motivated us to investigate the binding of P1-XPC and P2-XPC to CaM in the same physicochemical conditions.In the presence of Ca2+, the thermogram corresponding to the titration of CaM by P1-XPC shows a complex pattern, which could not be fitted using a single-site model (Fig. 4), suggesting that CaM exhibits two binding sites with distinct affinities. When the peptide to protein concentration ratio (R) is changed from 5.4 to 13.5, the thermogram becomes progressively dominated by the low affinity binding contribution, and the corresponding binding isotherm can be fitted confidently to a single-site model (Fig. 4). This allows us to obtain an estimation of the thermodynamic parameters characterizing the weak binding site: K a = 5.9 × 105m-1 and ΔH = -8.3 kcal/mol. Although the thermograms for lower peptide to protein ratios could not be modeled confidently, we assume that the affinity of the strong binding site is of the order of 108m-1. P1-XPC binding to CaM is also Ca2+-sensitive, because in the absence of the divalent cations, a single low affinity binding site (K a = 7 × 105m-1) was observed (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Titration of CaM by P1-XPC.

The thermogram and the interaction isotherm obtained in the absence of Ca2+ are also shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In contrast to HsCen2, the P2-XPC peptide also shows a significant binding to CaM. The binding isotherm could be fitted to a single-binding site model (Fig. 3), with a significant affinity (K a = 1.9 × 107m-1) largely accounted for by the enthalpy contribution (ΔH = -10.6 kcal/mol). In the absence of Ca2+, the binding of P2-XPC is undetectable in the present experimental conditions.Conformational Changes and Structural Stability Induced by the Complex Formation—CD and NMR spectroscopy were used as primary investigation tools to characterize the conformational properties of the HsCen/P1-XPC interaction.

https://openalex.org/W2063335280,"The HIP/PAP (=human Reg-2) C-type lectin encoding gene is activated in primary liver cancers. In normal liver, the protein is undetectable in normal mature hepatocytes and found only in some ductular cells, representing potential hepatic progenitor cells. The aim of this study was to examine the consequences of human HIP/PAP expression in the liver of transgenic mice. We demonstrated that HIP/PAP stimulated liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy. To further investigate the enhanced liver regeneration observed in vivo, primary cultures of hepatocytes were used to evaluate the mitogenic and anti-apoptotic properties of HIP/PAP. HIP/PAP increased hepatocyte DNA synthesis and protected hepatocytes against TNF-alpha plus actinomycin-D-induced apoptosis. HIP/PAP anti-apoptotic effects against TNF-alpha were clearly demonstrated when protein kinase A activity was specifically inhibited by KT5720, and HIP/PAP stimulated PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the proapoptotic Bad protein at Ser-112, suggesting that HIP/PAP may compete with cAMP to stimulate PKA activity. Overall, our results led us to propose a new role for a C-type lectin, HIP/PAP, as a hepatic cytokine that combines mitogenic and anti-apoptotic functions regarding hepatocytes, and consequently acts as a growth factor in vivo to enhance liver regeneration."

However, the cholesterol pool(s) and the cellular signaling processes utilized by the ABCA1-mediated pathway remain unclear. Sphingomyelin maintains a preferential interaction with cholesterol in membranes, and its catabolites, especially ceramide, are potent signaling molecules that could play a role in ABCA1 regulation or function. To study the potential role of ceramide in this process, we treated a variety of cell lines with 20 μm C2-ceramide and examined apolipoprotein-mediated cholesterol efflux to lipid-free apoA-I. We found that cell lines expressing ABCA1 displayed 2-3-fold increases in cholesterol efflux to apoA-I. Cell lines not expressing ABCA1 were unaffected by ceramide. We further characterized the cholesterol efflux effect in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Ceramide treatment did not cause significant cytotoxicity or apoptosis and did not affect cholesterol efflux to non-apolipoprotein acceptors. Raising endogenous ceramide levels increased cholesterol efflux to apoA-I. Using a cell surface biotinylation method, we found that the total cellular ABCA1 and that at the plasma membrane were increased with ceramide treatment.

Evidence exists that ABCA1 may utilize plasma membrane cholesterol from isolated lipid rafts (18Drobnik W. Borsukova H. Bottcher A. Pfeiffer A. Liebisch G. Schutz G.J. Schindler H. Schmitz G. Traffic. 2002; 3: 268-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) or caveolae (19Sviridov D. Fidge N. Beaumier-Gallon G. Fielding C. Biochem.

More recently, a study looking specifically at ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux showed that an endosomal/lysosomal pool is a preferred source (25Chen W. Sun Y. Welch C. Gorelik A. Leventhal A.R. Tabas I. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43564-43569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). A complete mechanism for the regulation and transport of cholesterol to ABCA1-accessible pools has not been established. Several signaling molecules have been implicated in apolipoprotein- or ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux including phospholipases C and D (26Haidar B. Mott S. Boucher B. Lee C.Y. Marcil M.

In the case of phospholipase C, phospholipase D, and protein kinase C, it is thought that these molecules control cholesterol transport to ABCA1. Another potential tactic the cell can utilize to regulate cholesterol availability to ABCA1 is with membrane sphingomyelin content. Evidence suggests that cholesterol maintains a preferential contact with sphingomyelin in cellular membranes (38Patton S. J. Theor. Biol. 1970; 29: 489-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 39Porn M.I. Ares M.P. Slotte J.P. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1385-1392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Ohvo H. Olsio C. Slotte J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1349: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). By modulating sphingomyelin content with sphingomyelinases, cholesterol could either be made available to or sequestered from ABCA1. The majority of sphingomyelin exists in the plasma membrane; however, roughly 25% of cellular sphingomyelin is contained in the lysosomes, endosomes, and Golgi combined (41Koval M. Pagano R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1082: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These cellular locations of sphingomyelin coincide with hypothesized sources of ABCA1-accessible cholesterol pools (18Drobnik W. Borsukova H. Bottcher A. Pfeiffer A. Liebisch G. Schutz G.J. Schindler H. Schmitz G. Traffic. 2002; 3: 268-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 19Sviridov D. Fidge N. Beaumier-Gallon G. Fielding C. Biochem.

The digestion of sphingomyelin with sphingomyelinases yields ceramide, a potent lipid signaling molecule shown to potentiate a variety of cellular events including cell growth, apoptosis, cell differentiation, and the stress response (42Kolesnick R.N. Prog. Lipid Res. 1991; 30: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 43Perry D.K. Hannun Y.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 2000; 1485: 63-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Therefore, as cholesterol is released from an interaction with sphingomyelin by sphingomyelinase activity, the released ceramide could be envisioned to activate a pathway that transports or makes available cholesterol to an ABCA1-accessible pool. The current study was designed to test the hypothesis that ceramide may play a role in ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux. To test this, we treated several cell types with C2-ceramide. It was found that ceramide treatment increased cholesterol efflux to apoA-I only in cells expressing ABCA1. This effect was further characterized in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The major findings were that ceramide treatment increases total and cell surface levels of ABCA1 protein, leading to increased apolipoprotein binding and cellular cholesterol efflux. Materials—Human aortic smooth muscle cells (aSMCs) and SmGM-2 Bullet Kit medium were from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). All other cell culture media and supplements were from Invitrogen. CHO, HeLa, and RAW 264.7 mouse macrophage cells were from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). C2-ceramide (d-erythro-N-acetylsphingosine), C2-dihydroceramide (d-erythro-N-acetyldihydrosphingosine), sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin, and fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) were from Calbiochem. MAPP ((1S,2R)-d-erythro-2-(N-myristoylamino)-1-phenyl-1-propanol) was from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Methylcyclodextrin, propidium iodide, RNase A, and 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) were from Sigma. Egg phosphatidylcholine was acquired from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Redi-gels) were from Bio-Rad. All other chemical reagents were of the highest grade from Fisher. Cell Culture—aSMCs were grown in smooth muscle basal medium (SmBM) with SmGM-2 Bullet Kit supplements and maintained according to the manufacturer's instructions. HeLa cells and RAW macrophages were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml gentamycin (DMEMg). CHO cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (HAMSg). GFP-ABCA1-expressing CHO cells were grown in HAMSg supplemented with 2 mg/ml G418. GFP-ABCA1-expressing HeLa cells were maintained as described previously (46Neufeld E.B. Remaley A.T. Demosky S.J. Stonik J.A. Cooney A.M. Comly M. Dwyer N.K. Zhang M. Blanchette-Mackie J. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27584-27590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere (cell culture incubator). Sphingolipids were added from stock ethanolic solutions with the final medium concentration of ethanol always less then 0.5%. Cholesterol Efflux Experiments—Cells were grown to 90% confluency in 12-well plates in their respective growth medium as described above. Monolayers were then labeled with 1 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol in the appropriate serum-free basal medium supplemented with 0.2% BSA (designated DMEMe, HAMSe, or SmBMe). After 24 h, the labeling medium was removed, and cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.2% BSA and once with appropriate basal medium containing 0.2% BSA. Cholesterol acceptors (in basal medium with 0.2% BSA) were added to yield the following final concentrations: 10 μg/ml human plasma apoA-I, 15 μg/ml phospholipid vesicles, and 0.5 mm methylcyclodextrin. Sphingolipid treatments were added as described in figure legends with untreated wells receiving equivalent volumes of ethanol vehicle. A 150-μl sample of efflux medium was obtained at the times designated and passed through a 0.45-μm filter to remove any floating cells. Monolayers were washed twice in PBS, and cellular lipids were extracted with isopropanol. Medium and cell-associated [3H]cholesterol was then measured by liquid scintillation counting. Percent efflux was calculated by the following equation: (total media counts/(total cellular counts + total media counts)) × 100. Cytotoxicity Tests—Cells were grown in microtiter plates and subjected to the experimental culture conditions and treatments as described for efflux experiments (without radiolabel). 0.5 mg/ml MTT was added to each well and incubated for 4 h in the cell culture incubator. Solubilization buffer (10% SDS in 0.01 m HCl) was added to each well and incubated in cell culture incubator overnight. Absorbance was measured at 550 nm on a microtiter plate reader. Percent MTT cleavage was determined as follows: ((treatment value - media with vehicle value)/(0.1% Triton X-100 value - media with vehicle value)) × 100. A lactate dehydrogenase release assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Hypodiploid Nuclei Determination—Hypodiploid nuclei determination was performed as described previously (47Hess K.L. Johnson J.D. Cook-Mills J.M. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2001; 70: 405-412PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cells were grown in T-75 culture flasks and subjected to the experimental culture conditions and treatments as described for efflux experiments (without radiolabel). Cells were trypsinized, washed in PBS, and then fixed with 70% ethanol at -20 °C overnight. After washing in PBS, cells were incubated with DNA staining reagent (0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05 mg/ml RNase A, 50 μg/ml propidium iodide) for 15 min. Stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Percentage of apoptotic cells were defined as the sub-G0/G1 cell cycle peak. Cellular ABCA1 Content and Cell Surface Biotinylation—Cellular ABCA1 content and cell surface biotinylation was performed as described previously (48Feng B. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43271-43280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. CHO cells were grown in T-75 flasks to confluency. Medium was replaced with HAMSe with or without 20 μm C2-ceramide and incubated for 16 h. Cells were put on ice and then washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Surface proteins were biotinylated with 1 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (in PBS) for 30 min at 4 °C on a platform rotator. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold quench buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl) and once with ice-cold PBS. Cells were scraped into PBS and then pelleted by centrifugation. Pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% NaN3, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Cellular debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C. Cleared supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, and aliquots were taken for protein concentration determination. 55 μg of cell protein was set aside to examine total cellular ABCA1 content. 200-250 μg of cell protein (final volume of 200 μl in lysis buffer) was added to 75 μl of UltraLink Plus immobilized streptavidin gel (Pierce) and incubated overnight on a platform mixer at 4 °C. The gel was pelleted and washed five times with lysis buffer. 55 μl of loading dye (60 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue) with 350 mm β-mercaptoethanol was added to the gel pellet and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. 30 μl was run on a 4-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and Western blotting was performed as described below. Western Blotting—Cell extracts (55 μg of total cell protein or 30 μl of purified biotinylated proteins) were loaded on 7.5% or 4-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and run for 1 h at 200 V. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and blocked for 2 h at 4 °C in TBS-T (20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Tween 20, pH 7.6) with 10% dried milk. Blots were incubated with 1:400 anti-ABCA1 (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Waltham, MA) overnight at 4 °C, washed, and then incubated with 1:5000 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. For total cell extracts, blots were subsequently stripped, blocked in TBS-T (20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.6) with 10% dried milk, and reprobed with 1:2000 anti-actin (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) for 2 h at room temperature and then with 1:3000 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were developed with an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Binding of Fluorescently Labeled ApoA-I (ALEXA488-ApoA-I) to CHO Cells—A cysteine mutant of apoA-I ([email protected]) was expressed, purified, and labeled with ALEXA-488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described previously (49Tricerri M.A. Behling Agree A.K. Sanchez S.A. Bronski J. Jonas A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5065-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). CHO cells expressing GFP-ABCA1 were grown to near confluency on slide well plates (no. 138121, Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) in the maintenance media described above. Cells were then pretreated with or without 20 μm C2-ceramide in CHOe for 16 h. After one quick wash with CHOe, fresh CHOe containing 10 μg/ml ALEXA488-apoA-I was added to the wells, and the slides were incubated on ice for 2 h. Cells were washed four times with ice-cold PBS and then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, 2% sucrose on ice for 30 min. Cells were again washed four times with ice-cold PBS. Slides were then coverslipped and immediately examined with a Leica TCS 4D confocal microscope (Heidelberg, Germany) using an Omnichrome krypton-argon laser (Chino, CA). Other Methods—The ABCA1-GFP construct (a gift from Dr. Richard Lawn) in the mammalian expression vector pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) was stably expressed in CHO cells using the LipofectAMINE Plus kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations were determined by the Markwell modification of the Lowry assay (50Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5347) Google Scholar). Phospholipid concentrations were determined by the method of Sokoloff et al. (51Sokoloff L. Rothblat G.H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1974; 146: 1166-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Student's t test was used to determine statistical differences. C 2 -ceramide Treatment Increases Cholesterol Efflux to ApoA-I in Cells Expressing ABCA1—As stated above, the intimate relationship between sphingomyelin and cholesterol led us to hypothesize that sphingomyelin breakdown products might play a role in the cellular regulation of cholesterol efflux. For our initial studies of ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux in vitro, we chose CHO cells and primary human aSMCs. Both cell lines contain relatively high levels of ABCA1 (52Bortnick A.E. Rothblat G.H. Stoudt G. Hoppe K.L. Royer L.J. McNeish J. Francone O.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28634-28640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and span the spectrum between easy to manipulate transformed cell models (CHO) and primary human cells that are relevant to the atherosclerotic disease process in the arterial wall (aSMC) (17Fielding P.E. Nagao K. Hakamata H. Chimini G. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14113-14120Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The presence of ABCA1 in these cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). For this study, we intentionally avoided the use of pharmacological induction of ABCA1 expression (such as cAMP induction of ABCA1 in RAW macrophages) that would undoubtedly confound any conclusions drawn about ABCA1 regulation. To examine the potential effect of ceramide on cholesterol efflux, we treated both cell types with C2-ceramide, a cell-permeant ceramide analog. Fig. 1 shows a clear dose-dependent increase in cholesterol efflux to lipid-free apolipoprotein A-I with ceramide treatment in both cell types. We also tested two other sphingomyelin metabolites, sphingosine and sphingosine phosphate, but no consistent effect on cholesterol efflux to apoA-I was observed with either compound (not shown). Since ceramide showed a clear and consistent effect in both cell types, we treated RAW 264 macrophages (without cAMP stimulation) and HeLa cells with 20 μm C2-ceramide. Both of these cell lines have been shown to lack detectable levels of ABCA1 (12Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. Garvin M.R. Wade D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34508-34511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 53Remaley A.T. Stonik J.A. Demosky S.J. Neufeld E.B. Bocharov A.V. Vishnyakova T.G. Eggerman T.L. Patterson A.P. Duverger N.J. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer Jr., H.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 818-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). These previous findings were confirmed by Western blotting (data not shown). For comparison, parallel experiments were done with WT CHO cells, CHO cells stably transfected with a human GFP-ABCA1 construct, and HeLa cells stably transfected with a human GFP-ABCA1 construct. As shown in Fig. 2, RAW 264 macrophages and WT HeLa cells failed to display the ceramide induction of cholesterol efflux to lipid-free apoA-I. In contrast, all ABCA1-expressing cell lines displayed ceramide-induced efflux with the ABCA1-transfected CHO and HeLa cells showing a significant increase over the respective WT controls. Thus, pre-existing ABCA1 expression is required for the ceramide induction of cholesterol efflux. Ceramide Treatment Does Not Cause Significant Apoptosis or Toxicity in CHO Cells under the Experimental Conditions Used—Because of their ease of use, we chose to further characterize the ceramide induction of cholesterol efflux using the CHO cells. Since ceramides are well known to act as stimulators of cellular apoptosis in some cell lines (42Kolesnick R.N. Prog. Lipid Res. 1991; 30: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 43Perry D.K. Hannun Y.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 44Kolesnick R.N.

Acta. 2000; 1485: 63-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), a possible explanation for the results in Fig. 1 is that ceramide caused cytotoxicity or induced apoptosis, and the cells released cholesterol during death. To address this possibility, we used three different approaches: the MTT test (54Denizot F. Lang R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 89: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (4357) Google Scholar) to measure overall metabolic activity of the cell, a lactate dehydrogenase release assay as an index of plasma membrane integrity, and hypodiploid nuclei analysis to assess apoptosis. Table I shows that none of the three tests revealed significant cytotoxicity (MTT and lactate dehydrogenase release) or apoptosis (hypodiploid) with ceramide treatment. These data are in agreement with previous studies showing that C2-ceramide does not cause significant cytotoxicity or apoptosis in CHO cells at ≤20 μm (55Ladenson R.C. Monsey J.D. Allin J.

https://openalex.org/W2040322459,"Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1), an immunoglobulin family vascular adhesion molecule, is involved in endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis (1, 2). We found that endothelial cells lacking PECAM-1 exhibit increased single cell motility and extension formation but poor wound healing migration, reminiscent of cells in which Rho activity has been suppressed by overexpressing a GTPase-activating protein (3). The ability of PECAM-1 to restore wound healing migration to PECAM-1-deficient cells was independent of its extracellular domain or signaling via its immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif. PECAM-1-deficient endothelial cells had a selective defect in RhoGTP loading, and inhibition of Rho activity mimicked the PECAM-1-deficient phenotype of increased chemokinetic single cell motility at the expense of coordinated wound healing migration. The wound healing advantage of PECAM-1-positive endothelial cells was not only Rho mediated but pertussis toxin inhibitable, characteristic of migration mediated by heterotrimeric G-protein-linked seven-transmembrane receptor signaling such as signaling in response to the serum sphingolipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) (4, 5). Indeed, we found that the wound healing defect of PECAM-1 null endothelial cells is minimized in sphingolipid-depleted media; moreover, PECAM-1 null endothelial cells fail to increase their migration in response to S1P. We have also found that PECAM-1 localizes to rafts and that in its absence heterotrimeric G-protein components are differentially recruited to rafts, providing a potential mechanism for PECAM-1-mediated coordination of S1P signaling. PECAM-1 may thus support the effective S1P/RhoGTP signaling required for wound healing endothelial migration by allowing for the spatially directed, coordinated activation of Galpha signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2074824035,"Autophagy is a process for the bulk degradation of cytosolic compartments by lysosomes/vacuoles. The formation of autophagosomes involves a dynamic rearrangement of the membrane for which two ubiquitin-like modifications (the conjugation of Apg12p and the modification of a soluble form of MAP-LC3 to a membrane-bound form) are essential. In yeast, Apg10p is an E2-like enzyme essential for Apg12p conjugation. The isolated mouse APG10 gene product interacts with mammalian Apg12p dependent on mammalian Apg7p (E1-like enzyme), and facilitates Apg12p conjugation. The interaction of Apg10p with Apg12p is dependent on the carboxyl-terminal glycine of Apg12p. Mutational analysis of the predicted active site cysteine (Cys161) within mouse Apg10p shows that mutant Apg10pC161S, which can form a stable intermediate with Apg12p, inhibits Apg12p conjugation even in the presence of Apg7p, while overexpression of Apg7p facilitates formation of an Apg12p-Apg5p conjugate. Furthermore, the coexpression of Apg10p with Apg7p facilitates the modification of a soluble form of MAP-LC3 to a membrane-bound form, a second modification essential for autophagy. Mouse Apg10p interacts with MAP-LC3 in HEK293 cells, while no mutant Apg10pC161S forms any intermediate with MAP-LC3. Direct interaction between Apg10p and MAP-LC3 is also demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid analysis. The inability of mutant Apg10pC161S to form any intermediate with MAP-LC3 has ruled out the possibility that MAP-LC3 interacts with Apg10p as a substrate.

The interaction of Apg10p with Apg12p is dependent on the carboxyl-terminal glycine of Apg12p. Mutational analysis of the predicted active site cysteine (Cys161) within mouse Apg10p shows that mutant Apg10pC161S, which can form a stable intermediate with Apg12p, inhibits Apg12p conjugation even in the presence of Apg7p, while overexpression of Apg7p facilitates formation of an Apg12p-Apg5p conjugate. Furthermore, the coexpression of Apg10p with Apg7p facilitates the modification of a soluble form of MAP-LC3 to a membrane-bound form, a second modification essential for autophagy. Mouse Apg10p interacts with MAP-LC3 in HEK293 cells, while no mutant Apg10pC161S forms any intermediate with MAP-LC3. Direct interaction between Apg10p and MAP-LC3 is also demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid analysis. The inability of mutant Apg10pC161S to form any intermediate with MAP-LC3 has ruled out the possibility that MAP-LC3 interacts with Apg10p as a substrate. Ubiquitylation and ubiquitylation-like protein conjugation mechanisms are essential to many cell-biological activities. Ubiquitin forms conjugates with target proteins via a three-step mechanism (1Pickeart C.M. Mol.

First, ubiquitin is activated at its carboxyl-terminal glycine by the ubiquitin-activating (E1) 1The abbreviations used are: E1, protein-activating enzyme; E2, protein-conjugating enzyme; EST, expressed sequence tagged; FLAGhApg12p, FLAG-tagged hApg12p; FLAGmApg10p, FLAG-tagged mouse Apg10p homologue; FLAGMAP-LC3, FLAG-tagged MAP-LC3; GABARAP, GABAA receptor-associated protein; GAD, GAL4 activating domain; GATE-16, Golgi-associated ATPase enhancer of 16 kDa; GBD, GAL4 DNA-binding domain; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GFPhApg12p, GFP-tagged hApg12p; MAP-LC3, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3; mychApg5p, Myc-tagged hApg5p; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; YFPmApg10p, YFP-tagged mApg10p; WB, Western blot; IP, immunoprecipitate. enzyme to form a conjugate through the active cysteine in the E1 enzyme via a thiol ester bond. Next, ubiquitin is transferred from the E1 enzyme to one of several ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzymes. In the last step, ubiquitin attaches to a lysine within a target protein via an isopeptide bond. This step is often catalyzed by a member of the ubiquitin protein ligase (E3 enzyme) family. With regard to other modifiers, Nedd8, SUMOs, Apg12p, and Apg8ps (Apg8p in yeast, and, MAP-LC3, GABARAP, and GATE-16 in mammals), each is modified by specific E1 and E2 enzymes, and conjugated with its target (4Yeh E.T.

Of these modifiers, Apg12p and MAP-LC3 (Apg8p in yeast) cooperatively play an essential role in the dynamic membrane formation of the autophagosome during autophagy. Autophagy is a process for the bulk degradation of cytoplasmic components by lysosomes/vacuoles (6Ohsumi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar, 11Kim J. Klionsky D.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 303-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 12Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Science. 2000; 290: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (2988) Google Scholar), and has a significant relationship with type II programmed cell death, several neurodegenerative disorders, and cardiomyopathies in addition to normal cell growth and differentiation (for reviews, see Refs. 6Ohsumi Y.

In the initial step of macroautophagy, a cup-shaped membrane sac surrounds cytosolic components to form an autophagosome. The outer membrane of the autophagosome fuses with the lysosome/vacuole. Thereafter, intralumenal components are degraded by lysosomal lytic enzymes. The process of autophagy is essentially the same in yeast, plant, and animal cells, and the genes, which encode components of the autophagic system in several organisms, seem to be highly conserved. In mammalian cells, autophagic vacuoles are found in hepatocytes under conditions of starvation (13Ohshita T. Kominami E. Ii K. Katsunuma N. J.

In the formation of autophagosomes, two ubiquitin-like modifications, Apg12p conjugation and Apg8p/Aut7p processing, are essential (6Ohsumi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar, 9Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. Noda T.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5468) Google Scholar). In yeast, Apg12p is covalently attached to Apg5p via its carboxyl-terminal glycine as in the case of ubiquitylation (7Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). In this conjugate reaction, Apg7p and Apg10p function as E1- and E2-like enzymes for Apg12p, respectively (21Tanida I. Mizushima N. Kiyooka M. Ohsumi M. Ueno T. Ohsumi Y. Kominami E. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). After the formation of the Apg12p-Apg5p conjugate, Apg16p attaches to Apg5p to form an Apg12p-Apg5p-Apg16p complex for autophagy (23Shintani T. Mizushima N. Ogawa Y. Matsuura A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y.

Thereafter, an Apg8p/Aut7p modification, a unique lipidation, plays an indispensable role in the formation of the autophagosome (9Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N.

Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). In this Apg8p lipidation, the same E1-like enzyme, Apg7p, and a second E2-like enzyme, Apg3p, mediate the reaction. In mammals, these two modifications seem to be conserved; the Apg12p-Apg5p conjugate associates with an autophagosomal precursor in embryonic stem cells (29Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). After the dissociation of the conjugate according to extension of the precursor, modified, or lipidated form of MAP-LC3 (a mammalian Apg8p/ Aut7p homologue) is localized to a cup-shaped preautophago-some and autophagosome (10Tanida I.

Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5468) Google Scholar). As the apparent mobility of the soluble form of MAP-LC3 is smaller than that of the membrane-bound form in SDS-PAGE, we have designated the soluble and membrane bound form as MAP-LC3-I and MAP-LC3-II, respectively, for simplicity (20Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5468) Google Scholar). We have characterized mammalian Apg7p as an E1-like enzyme essential to both mammalian Apg12p and three Apg8 homologues (MAP-LC3, GABARAP, and GATE-16), and mammalian Apg3p as an E2-like enzyme essential to three Apg8p homologues (10Tanida I.

However, there has been little progress in the biochemical characterization of mammalian Apg10p with regard to interacting proteins and cooperative function between Apg12p conjugation and MAP-LC3 modification. Mutational analysis showed that a mutant, Apg10pC161S, in which the active site cysteine was changed to serine, inhibits the conjugation of Apg12p even in the presence of Apg7p. Furthermore, we found that Apg10p facilitates the modification of MAP-LC3 (a second modification pathway), suggesting that the Apg12p conjugation mediated by Apg10p cooperates in the modification of a soluble form of MAP-LC3 to a membrane-bound form. Cloning of Mouse APG10 cDNA—Two oligonucleotides (mAPG10GSP1, 5′-GGCGATGGCTGGGAATGG-3′; mAPG10-GSP2, 5′-AGGCTGCTCCAGGGACCGTG-3′) were synthesized based on the DNA sequence of two EST clones (GenBank™ accession numbers, AI152249 and AI594591). Using these primers, the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed by high fidelity PCR using mouse brain Marathon-ready cDNA as a template according to the manufacturer's protocol (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Plasmid Construction and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Based on the obtained DNA sequence of the mouse APG10 homologue (GenBank™ accession number, AB079383), we amplified an open-reading frame of the mouse APG10 cDNA by PCR with high fidelity introducing a BglII site before the start codon, and a SalI site after the termination codon, cloned the fragment into pGEM-T, and designated the resultant plasmid the pGEMmAPG10 plasmid. To express YFPmApg10p under the control of the CMV promoter, a BglII-SalI fragment of the pGEMmAPG10 plasmid was introduced into a pEYFP-C1 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), and designated pYFP-mAPG10. To express FLAGmApg10p in HEK293 cells, a BglII-SalI fragment of the pGEMmApg10 plasmid was introduced into the BamHI-SalI site of a pCMVTag2B vector (Stratagene), and designated pCMV-tag2B-mApg10. Mammalian expression vectors for each of the EGFP modifier fusion proteins and FLAG-tagged proteins have been described previously (10Tanida I. Tanida-Miyake E. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol.

To express Myc-tagged hApg5p, the BamHI-SalI fragment of the pGEMhAPG5 plasmid was introduced into the BamHI-SalI site of a pCMVTag3B vector (Stratagene), and designated pCMV-tag3B-hApg5. Cys161 within Apg10p was replaced by Ser and mutagenized using the Gene-Editor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega) with an oligonucleotide (mAPG10CS; 5′-CAACCATTTTTTGTTCTACATCCCAGCAAGACAAATGAATTCATGACTGC-3′) according to the manufacturer's directions. Antibodies—A polyclonal antibody against a synthetic polypeptide corresponding to residues 550–571 of hApg7p has been described previously (10Tanida I. Tanida-Miyake E. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1701-1706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). For the preparation of anti-serum against mouse Apg10p, rabbits were immunized with a glutathione S-transferase-Apg10p fusion protein. The antibody to mouse Apg10p was purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione S-transferase-Apg10p fusion protein-immobilized Sepharose. Then, the obtained antibody was passed through a column of glutathione S-transferase-immobilized Sepharose. The resultant antibody (anti-mApg10p antibody) recognized a recombinant YFPmApg10p in HEK293 cells. The monoclonal anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibody was purchased from Clontech. The monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The co-immunoprecipitation of interacting proteins has been described previously (10Tanida I. Tanida-Miyake E. Ueno T.

Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were obtained from Health Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. HEK293 cells (5 × 105 cells) were transfected with the indicated constructs using LipofectAMINE 2000 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). After 48 h, cells were harvested for further analyses. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed with TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, and1mm EDTA) containing a Complete™ proteinase inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk and primed with the indicated antibodies. The membranes were washed and then incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies. Immunoreactivity was detected on x-ray film using Super Signal ULTRA chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were pre-absorbed with protein A-agarose at 4 °C for 1 h. The pre-absorbed lysates were incubated with the indicated antibodies at 4 °C for 18 h. After incubation, unbound proteins were removed and the protein A-agarose was washed five times with TNE buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by boiling with Laemmli's sample buffer. Animals—Male Wistar rats (250–300 g) were maintained in an environmentally controlled room (lights on 7:00 to 20:00) for at least 2 weeks before the experiments. All rats were fed a standard pelleted laboratory diet and tap water ad libitum during this period. Preparation of Cell Lysates from Rat Tissues—Apg10p in lysates of rat brain, liver, kidney, heart, skeletal muscle, and spleen was immunoprecipitated with anti-mApg10p antibody, and recognized by immunoblotting using the antibody. Two-hybrid Analyses—Two-hybrid analysis was performed as described previously (22Komatsu M. Tanida I. Ueno T. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9846-9854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Isolation and Identification of Mouse APG10 cDNA and Its Gene Product—To investigate the E2-like enzyme essential for the mammalian Apg12p conjugation system, we first isolated a cDNA to a mouse APG10 homologue. A BLAST search of the EST data base with the amino acid sequence of yeast Apg10p indicated a candidate mouse Apg10p homologue (GenBank™ accession numbers, AI152249 and AI594591). Based on the DNA sequences of two EST clones, a cDNA to mouse Apg10p was isolated by 5′-RACE using a mouse brain cDNA library as a template (GenBank™ accession number, AB079383). The predicted amino acid sequence of the isolated clone (calculated molecular mass, 24.3 kDa) shows 10.0% identity and 22.5% similarity to yeast Apg10p, and the region including the predicted active-site cysteine residue (Cys161) is significantly conserved between the isolated clones and yeast Apg10p (47.7% similarity) (Fig. 1). Apg10p Interacts with Apg12p via the Carboxyl-terminal Glycine within Apg12p Dependent on Apg7p—Yeast Apg10p interacts with yeast Apg12p, its substrate, depending on yeast Apg7p, an E1-like enzyme for yeast Apg12p (23Shintani T. Mizushima N. Ogawa Y. Matsuura A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5234-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). If the isolated clone encodes an authentic E2-like enzyme essential to mammalian Apg12p, its gene product will interact with mammalian Apg12p. We then investigated whether its gene product (Apg10p) interacts with human Apg12p by immunoprecipitation. We expressed YFPmApg10p (pYFP-mApg10) and FLAGhApg12p (pCMV-tag2B-hApg12) in the presence of human Apg7p in HEK293 cells. When FLAGhApg12p in the lysate of the transfectant was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, YFPmApg10p coprecipitated with FLAGhApg12p (Fig. 2A, lane 2, IP, anti-FLAG, WB, anti-FLAG and mApg10p). Apg12p also coprecipitated with Apg10p when the anti-mApg10p antibody was used (Fig. 2A, lane 2, IP, anti-mApg10p; WB, anti-FLAG). In the absence of Apg7p, little interaction occurred (Fig. 2A, lane 1). These results indicate that Apg10p interacts with Apg12p dependent on Apg7p. When mutant FLAGhApg12pΔG, which lacks the carboxyl-terminal glycine of wild-type FLAGhApg12p was expressed in HEK293 cells, little interaction of YFPmApg10p with FLAGhApg12pΔG was recognized even in the presence of Apg7p (Fig. 2A, lane 5 versus lane 4). These results indicate that the interaction of Apg10p with Apg12p in the presence of Apg7p is dependent on the carboxyl-terminal glycine of Apg12p that is essential for the conjugation reaction (Fig. 2A, lane 5). Yeast Apg10p also interacts with yeast Apg7p, an E1-like enzyme (23Shintani T. Mizushima N. Ogawa Y. Matsuura A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5234-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Considering that Apg10p interacts with Apg12p dependent on Apg7p (Fig. 2A), it is likely that mammalian Apg10p would also interact with Apg7p. We next studied whether mammalian Apg10p interacts with Apg7p in HEK293 cells. YFPmApg10p was expressed together with human Apg7p, and immunoprecipitated with anti-mApg10p antibody. When both YFPmApg10p and Apg7p were expressed, Apg7p coprecipitated with YFPmApg10p using the anti-mApg10p antibody (Fig. 2B, lane 1). When Apg7p alone was expressed, little Apg7p was immunoprecipitated with this antibody (Fig. 2B, lane 2). These results indicate that Apg10p interacts with Apg7p and Apg12p in mammals, as is the case in yeast. Mutant Apg10pC161S Forms a Stable Intermediate with Apg12p Dependent on Apg7p—As previously reported (31Tanida I. Tanida-Miyake E. Komatsu M. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13739-13744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 32Sullivan M.L. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 2958-2964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), when an active site cysteine within E2 (or E2-like) enzyme is changed to serine, a stable intermediate between substrate and enzyme is formed in the presence of the respective E1 (or E1-like) enzyme. Therefore, if the isolated mouse Apg10p is an authentic E2-like enzyme essential for Apg12p conjugation in cooperation with Apg7p, a mutant Apg10p (Apg10pC161S), in which the predicted active site cysteine positioned at 161 has been changed to serine by site directed mutagenesis, will form a stable intermediate with Apg12p in the presence of Apg7p. Then, we expressed both a mutant YFPmApg10pC161S and FLAGhApg12p in the absence or presence of Apg7p in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2). Apg7p, YPFmApg12pC161S, and FLAGhApg12p were expressed well in the cells (Fig. 3A, Apg7p, YFPmApg10pCS, and FLAGApg12p). When Apg7p was overexpressed, a stable intermediate was recognized by immunoblotting using anti-mApg10p and anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 3A, YFPmApg10pCS-FLAGhApg12p). When FLAGhApg12pΔG, which lacks the carboxyl-terminal glycine, was expressed instead of wild-type FLAGhApg12p together with Apg7p and YFPmApg10pC161S, no intermediate was recognized (Fig. 3A, lane 3). These results indicate that the cysteine positioned at 161 is an authentic active-site cysteine for the E2-like reaction of hApg12p via the carboxyl-terminal glycine within hApg12p. Mouse Apg10p Facilitates Apg12p-Apg5p Conjugate Formation—Considering the above results, the mammalian Apg10p would facilitate Apg12p-Apg5p conjugation. When FLAGhApg12p and mychApg5p were expressed in HEK293 cells, a small amount of the FLAGhApg12p-mychApg5p conjugate was recognized (Fig. 3B, lane 5). In the presence of human Apg7p, FLAGhApg12p conjugates to mychApg5p significantly as described previously (Fig. 3B, lane 3, Apg12p-Apg5p) (10Tanida I. Tanida-Miyake E. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol.

Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). When FLAGmApg10p was expressed in addition to human Apg7p, the formation of the FLAGhApg12p-mychApg5p conjugate was facilitated significantly (Fig. 3B, lane 1). Without overexpressed Apg7p, a significant reduction in the amount of conjugate occurred even in the presence of Apg10p (Fig. 3B, lane 2 versus lane 5). A mutant Apg12p (FLAGhApg12pΔG) hardly conjugated to mychApg5p even in the presence of Apg7p and Apg10p, because the carboxyl-terminal glycine of Apg12p is essential for the conjugation (Fig. 3B, lane 4, ΔG). These results indicate that Apg10p facilitates Apg12p-Apg5p conjugation dependent on human Apg7p. An Active-site Cysteine Mutant, Apg10pC161S, Inhibits the Effect of Overexpression of Apg7p on Apg12p Conjugation— Considering the reaction of the E2-like enzyme, it is probable that a mutant Apg10pC161S inhibits the Apg12p conjugation even in the presence of endogenous Apg10p in mammalian cells. To investigate whether Apg10pC161S inhibits the formation of the Apg12p-Apg5p conjugate, YFPmApg10pC161S was expressed together with FLAGhApg12p and mychApg5p, in the presence or absence of Apg7p. When YFPmApg10p was expressed with FLAGhApg12p and mychApg5p, FLAGhApg12pmychApg5p conjugate was formed (Fig. 4, lane 1, WB, anti-Myc, FLAGhApg12-mychApg5). When YFPmApg10pC161S was expressed instead of wild-type YFPmApg10p together with FLAGhApg12p, and mychApg5p, little conjugate was recognized (Fig. 4, lane 2). The overexpression of human Apg7p stimulated the Apg12p conjugation reaction, as shown above (10Tanida I. Tanida-Miyake E. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1701-1706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). However, when mutant Apg10pC161S was expressed instead of wild-type Apg10p, the formation of the Apg12p-Apg5p conjugate was almost completely inhibited even in the presence of Apg7p. Essentially the same result was obtained, when FLAGmApg10pC161S was expressed instead of wild-type FLAGmApg10p together with GFPhApg12p, mychApg5p, and Apg7p (Fig. 4B, lane 5 versus lane 6, WB, anti-Myc, GFPhApg12p-mychApg5p). These results indicate that the overexpression of mutant Apg10pC161S inhibits the formation of the Apg12p-Apg5p conjugate even in the presence of Apg7p. Overexpression of Mouse Apg10 Facilitates the Modification of a Soluble Form of MAP-LC3 to a Membrane-bound Form—A cytosolic MAP-LC3 (a soluble form of MAP-LC3, MAP-LC3-I) is modified to a membrane-bound form (MAP-LC3-II) to form autophagosomes after the Apg12p-Apg5p conjugate associates with autophagosomal precursors (20Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5468) Google Scholar). The modification of the soluble form of MAP-LC3 to the membrane-bound form following the Apg12p-Apg5p conjugation is essential for mammalian autophagy (29Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that Apg3p, an E2-like enzyme essential for the modification of MAP-LC3, facilitates the conjugation of Apg12p-Apg5p, suggesting functional crosstalk between Apg12p conjugation and MAP-LC3 modification (31Tanida I.

Therefore, it is possible that Apg10p influences the modification of MAP-LC3 in reverse. We then investigated whether the overexpression of mammalian Apg"

In bone they affect both bone-forming osteoblast and bone-resorbing osteoclast cell activity. The presence of nucleotides in the extracellular microenvironment is largely determined by their release from cells and metabolism by ecto-enzymes, both of which have scarcely been studied in bone. We have investigated adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) release from SaOS-2 osteoblastic cells and the activities of cell surface ecto-enzymes on ATP metabolism. ATP, but not LDH, was detected in SaOS-2 cell conditioned medium, suggesting these cells were actively releasing ATP. Introduction of ADP resulted in increased ATP concentrations in the medium, which was found not to be receptor mediated. Nucleotide inhibition and substrate specificity studies revealed an ecto-nucleoside diphosphokinase (ecto-NDPK) was responsible for the ADP-->ATP conversion; PCR and immunocytochemistry confirmed its presence. Analysis of ATP metabolism over time demonstrated overall ATP degradation was increased by inhibiting ecto-NDPK activity; confirming that the combined action of multiple osteoblast-expressed ecto-enzymes affected extracellular nucleotide concentration. The data establish the coexistence of ATP-consuming, and for the first time, ATP-generating activities on the osteoblast cell surface, the discovery of which has significant implications for studies involving P2 receptor subtypes in bone."

Many G protein-coupled receptors stimulate ERK following tyrosine phosphorylation of growth factor receptors; however, the mechanism(s) of transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases are not well defined. Here, we provide evidence for the involvement of phospholipase D (PLD) in LPA-mediated transactivation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGF-Rβ). In primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpCs), LPA stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGF-Rβ and threonine/tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK1/2. The LPA-mediated activation of ERK and tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGF-Rβ was attenuated by tyrphostin AG 1296, an inhibitor of PDGF-R kinase, suggesting transactivation of PDGF-R by LPA. Furthermore, LPA-, but not PDGF β-chain homodimer-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGF-Rβ was partially blocked by pertussis toxin, indicating coupling of LPA-R(s) to Gi. Exposure of HBEpCs to LPA activated PLD. Butan-1-ol, which acts as an acceptor of phosphatidate generated by the PLD pathway, blocked LPA-mediated transactivation of PDGF-Rβ. This effect was not seen with butan-3-ol, suggesting PLD involvement. The role of PLD1 and PLD2 in the PDGF-Rβ transactivation by LPA was investigated by infection of cells with adenoviral constructs of wild type and catalytically inactive mutants of PLD. LPA activated both PLD1 and PLD2 in HBEpCs; however, infection of cells with cDNA for wild type PLD2, but not PLD1, increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGF-Rβ in response to LPA. Also, the LPA-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGF-Rβ was attenuated by the catalytically inactive mutant mPLD2-K758R. Infection of HBEpCs with adenoviral constructs of wild type hPLD1, mPLD2, and the inactive mutants of hPLD1 and mPLD2 resulted in association of PLD2 wild type and inactive mutant proteins with the PDGF-Rβ compared with PLD1. These results show for the first time that transactivation of PDGF-Rβ by LPA in HBEpCs is regulated by PLD2.

In plasma, LPA is present at <0.2 μm, but activated platelets produce high amounts of LPA which can reach 1–10 μm, making it the most abundant mitogen/survival factor present in serum (6Eichholtz T. Jalink K. Fahrenfort I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells contain small quantities of intracellular LPA; however, many biological actions of LPA are mediated by specific G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), LPA-1, LPA-2, and LPA-3 (formerly called EDG-2, -4, and -7). LPA, akin to sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), binds with high affinity to its receptors that are coupled to multiple types of heterotrimeric G proteins (Gi, Gq, and G12/13). Ligation of LPA to LPA-Rs (LPA-Rs) leads to a myriad of signal transduction pathways including release of [Ca2+] i , activation of protein kinase C, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERK1 and ERK2), tyrosine kinases, and phospholipases (7Fukushima N. Chun J. Prostaglandins. 2001; 64: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).

The second messenger functions of PA are mediated directly or after its conversion to either diacylglycerol or LPA by the action of PA phosphohydrolase or phospholipase A1/A2, respectively. PA derived through PLD regulates protein tyrosine phosphatases, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase, phagocytic NADPH oxidase, actin polymerization, coatomer assembly, vesicle trafficking, and cytokine secretion (18English D.

However, the relationships between PLD1 and PLD2 activation and cellular responses have not been well studied.In contrast to LPARs, the protein growth factor receptors are receptor tyrosine kinases, and their activation stimulates signaling pathways, involving ERK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, protein kinase C, and phospholipases (1Cerutis D.R.

It is now becoming clearer that cross-talk among lipid mediators, cytokines, and growth factors regulates the amplitude and specificity of cellular responses such as secretion, proliferation, and differentiation. For instance, several agonists of GPCR, such as thrombin, angiotensin II, bradykinin, S1P, and LPA, not only induce tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular signaling proteins, but also transactivate the growth factor receptors, EGF and PDGF (27Daub H.

However, relatively little is known regarding the role and regulation of LPA-mediated transactivation of PDGF-Rs in mammalian cells.In the present study, we investigated potential signaling pathways activated by LPA which regulate the transactivation of PDGF-Rβ in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpCs). LPA-induced phosphorylation of PDGF-Rβ in HBEpCs was sensitive to PTx. LPA also stimulated both PLD1 and PLD2 in HBEpCs; however, PLD2 but not PLD1 activation regulated LPA-mediated transactivation of PDGF-Rβ. Furthermore, overexpression of wild type and catalytically inactive mutant of mPLD2 compared with hPLD1 preferentially formed a complex with PDGF-Rβ in HBEpCs. Our results show for the first time that generation of PA by PLD2 activation is involved in LPA-induced PDGF-Rβ transactivation and downstream signaling in HBEpCs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsLPA was obtained from BIOMOL Research Labs (Plymouth, PA). 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, bovine serum albumin (fraction V), butan-1-ol, butan-3-ol, and dimethyl sulfoxide were purchased from Sigma.

BEBM and supplement kit were purchased from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, Frederick, MD). Primary HBEpCs, passage 2, were procured from Clonetics (San Diego, CA).Cell CulturePrimary HBEpCs were cultured in BEBM serum-free medium containing all of the growth factors supplied by Clonetics (BEGM) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cells were grown in to ∼90% confluence in T-75-cm2 vented flasks and subsequently propagated in 35-mm dishes. Cells were grown for 48 h without changing the medium before stimulation with LPA or PDGF-BB in conditioned BEBM (medium collected from cells cultured for 48 h) containing 0.1% BSA. All experiments were carried out between passages 2 and 5.Transfection and Viral InfectionFor transient transfection, HBEpCs grown in 6-well plates (∼60 confluence), were transfected with PDGF-Rβ or PLD2 plasmids (1 μg of cDNA was mixed with 6 μl of FuGENE 6/well in 1 ml of BEGM) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After 5 h, the transfection medium was aspirated and 2 ml of regular BEGM was added, and cells were incubated for 24–48 h.

Cell lysates were sonicated (3 × 15 s) on ice, centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and protein concentrations were determined with BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Chemical Co.) using BSA as standard. Equal amounts of protein (300–500 μg) were precleared with 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose for 30 min at 4 °C, centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min, supernatants were incubated with 2 μg/ml anti-PDGF-Rβ antibody overnight at 4 °C followed by the addition of 40 μl of protein A/G-agarose and additional incubation for 2 h at 4 °C. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min, washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm orthovanadate, protein-agarose complexes were dissociated by boiling for 5 min in 2× Lammeli buffer, and samples were centrifuged in a microfuge at 5,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blocked with 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk in TBST (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h and incubated with primary antibodies against PDGF-Rβ or phospho-PDGF-Rβ (1:1,000 dilution) in TBST overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were washed three times with TBST at 30-min intervals and then incubated with either mouse or rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:3,000 dilution) for 2–4 h at room temperature. The membranes were developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system according to manufacturer's instruction, and blots were quantified by densitometry and image analysis with Molecular Analyst software. Changes in PDGF-Rβ phosphorylation were expressed as -fold change normalized to total cellular PDGF-Rβ protein.Measurement of Phospholipase D in Intact CellsHBEpCs in 35-mm dishes were labeled with 30 μCi/ml 32Pi BMGM for 18–24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% air incubator. Cells were pretreated with vehicle alone or specific agents for specified times prior to challenge with LPA. Cells were then challenged with LPA in vehicle containing 0.1% BSA or other agents and in the presence of 0.05% butan-1-ol. In some experiments, incubations were also carried out in the presence of 0.05% butan-3-ol that served as additional controls. Incubations were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of methanol:HCl (100:1 v/v), cells were scraped into glass tubes, and lipids were extracted by the addition of 1 ml of methanol:HCl (100:1 v/v), 2 ml of chloroform, and 0.8 ml of 1 m HCl (21Wang L. Cummings R. Usatyuk P. Morris A. Irani K. Natarajan V. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Formation of [32P]PBt, as a result of PLD activation and transphosphatidylation of [32P]PA, to butan-1-ol but not butan-3-ol, was separated from the total lipid extract by thin layer chromatography on 1% potassium oxalate plates with the upper phase of ethyl acetate:2,2,4-trimethyl pentane:glacial acetic acid: water (65:10:15:50 v/v) as the developing solvent system. Unlabeled PBt was added as carrier during separation of labeled lipids that were visualized by exposure to iodine vapor. Radioactivity associated with PBt was counted by liquid scintillation counting, and all values were normalized to 106 dpm in total lipid extract. [32P]PBt formed in control and agonist challenged samples was expressed as dpm/dish or percent control.Statistical AnalysisData are expressed as means of triplicates ± S.D. from at least three independent experiments. All results were subjected to statistical analysis using one-way analysis of variance.RESULTSExpression of LPA-Rs in HBEpCs—Recent cloning of GPCRs for LPA has identified three high affinity receptors, namely LPA-1, LPA-2, and LPA-3 in mammalian cells and tissues. In the lung and human airway smooth muscle cells, mRNA for all three LPA-Rs has been shown by RT-PCR (46Contos J.J. Ishii I. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1188-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). However, the relative expression and functional role of LPA-Rs in airway cells are unknown. Therefore, we determined the mRNA and protein expression of LPA-R subtypes in primary cultures of HBEpCs using RT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunocytochemistry. As shown in Fig. 1A, mRNA for all the three LPA-Rs was identified in HBEpCs. The presence of LPA-1 (50 kDa), LPA-2 (45 kDa), and LPA-3 (40 kDa) receptor proteins was also confirmed by Western blotting with specific antibodies to the three receptor proteins in HBEpCs (Fig. 1B) (provided by Glaxo Smith Kline, King of Prussia, PA). Furthermore, the Western blot results were complemented by immunocytochemical localization using LPA-R antibodies. All three LPA-Rs were also detected in HBEpCs by immunocytochemistry (Fig. 1C). LPA-3 was barely detectable compared with LPA-1 and LPA-2 by immunofluorescent microscopy. Both LPA-1 and LPA-2 were not only localized at the plasma membrane, but were also distributed in the cytoplasm of the cell. The distribution of LPA-1 appeared punctated and located in the perinuclear membrane. The staining of LPA-3 was more pronounced at the perinuclear membrane compared with the plasma membrane or cytoplasm distribution. These results indicate that LPA-Rs are not only present at the plasma membrane, but also distributed in the cytoplasm and perinuclear membranes.LPA-induced ERK1/2 Activation Is Sensitive to AG 1296 and PTx in HBEpCs—Previous studies have demonstrated stimulation of mitogenic signaling pathways for S1P, LPA, and growth factors in human airway smooth muscle and epithelial cells (1Cerutis D.R.

To examine ERK activation further, HBEpCs were challenged with 1 μm LPA or 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB, and phosphorylation of ERK was analyzed by Western blotting with phospho-specific antibodies against threonine/tyrosine residues. As shown in Fig. 2, LPA and PDGF stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation by 2.2- and 1.8-fold, respectively. Enhanced phosphorylation of ERK, normalized to total ERK, was detected as early as 2 min of exposure to either LPA or PDFG-BB, whereas maximum phosphorylation (∼ 3–4-fold) occurred at 15 min and declined thereafter (results not shown). As LPA and PDGF stimulated ERK, we next investigated the mechanisms of ERK activation. Treatment of cells with PD98059, a known inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase, blocked (> 95%) both LPA- and PDGF-BB-mediated phosphorylation (results not shown). These results suggest that LPA- and PDGF-BB-induced activation of ERK is coupled to mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase signaling in HBEpCs. Pretreatment of cells with the PDGF-R-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin AG 1296 completely blocked PDGF-BB-stimulated ERK phosphorylation, whereas LPA activation of ERK was only partially blocked. This suggests that PDGF-R kinase activity is required for part of the LPA activation of the ERK cascade (Fig. 2). Previous studies showed that in Beas-2B cells, S1P-induced activation of ERK was sensitive to PTx (21Wang L. Cummings R. Usatyuk P. Morris A. Irani K. Natarajan V. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), indicating the involvement of Gi-coupled S1P receptors. In HBEpCs pretreated with 100 ng/ml PTx for 3 h, the LPA-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation was attenuated by about 95% (Fig. 3). These results demonstrate that LPA-Rs are coupled to PTx-sensitive Gi in the ERK signaling cascade.Fig. 2Effect of tyrphostin AG 1296 on LPA- and PDGF-BB-mediated ERK phosphorylation. HBEpCs (passage 2, ∼ 90% confluence in 35-mm dishes) were pretreated with BEBM or BEBM plus 5 μm AG 1296 for 1 h and then stimulated with 1 μm LPA (A) or 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB (B) for 15 min. Cell lysates (30 μg of protein) from A and B were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with phospho-specific and pan-ERK antibodies.

Therefore, we assessed PDGF-Rβ phosphorylation in response to LPA. HBEpCs were challenged with LPA, and PDGF-Rβ phosphorylation was studied by Western blotting with phospho-specific PDGF-Rβ antibody (specific for tyrosine 716). As shown in Fig. 4, stimulation of HBEpCs with varying concentrations of LPA (0.1–5 μm) increased PDGF-Rβ tyrosine phosphorylation. Enhanced phosphorylation of PDGF-Rβ after 15 min of exposure to 0.1 μm LPA (∼4-fold increase over control) increased to ∼7-fold with 0.5 μm LPA (Fig. 4). Furthermore, LPA stimulated PDGF-Rβ phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 5). Enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGF-Rβ (∼2-fold) was detected within 2 min of challenge to LPA, whereas maximum phosphorylation (∼10-fold) was observed at 5 min and declined thereafter up to 30 min (Fig. 5). In addition to tyrosine 716, PDGF-Rβ is also tyrosine phosphorylated at other sites by PDGF. We therefore compared the Western blots of phospho-specific tyrosine 716 antibodies with immunoprecipitation of PDGF-Rβ and Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. HBEpCs were transfected with PDGF-Rβ wild type plasmid for 18 h, and cells were stimulated with 1 μm LPA for different times. Cells lysates (1.0 mg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with PDGF-Rβ antibody, and precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 5, overexpression of cells with wild type PDGF-Rβ plasmi"

In this study, we examined the cardiac response of AC8TG mice to beta-adrenergic and muscarinic agonists and IBMX, a cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor. Stimulation of LVSP and ICa,L by isoprenaline (ISO, 100 nM) was twofold smaller in AC8TG vs. NTG mice. In contrast, IBMX (100 microM) produced a twofold higher stimulation of ICa,L in AC8TG vs. NTG mice. IBMX (10 microM) increased LVSP by 40% in both types of mice, but contraction and relaxation were hastened in AC8TG mice only. Carbachol (10 microM) had no effect on basal contractility in NTG hearts but decreased LVSP by 50% in AC8TG mice. PDE assays demonstrated an increase in cAMP-PDE activity in AC8TG hearts, mainly due to an increase in the hydrolytic activity of PDE4 and PDE1 toward cAMP and a decrease in the activity of PDE1 and PDE2 toward cGMP. We conclude that cardiac expression of AC8 is accompanied by a rearrangement of PDE isoforms, leading to a strong compartmentation of the cAMP signal that shields L-type Ca2+ channels and protects the cardiomyocytes from Ca2+ overload."

NF-κB is kept inactive in the cytoplasm in unstimulated cells by virtue of the masking of its nuclear localization sequence by bound IκB protein. Cellular stimuli trigger the destruction of IκB proteins and the liberation of NF-κB to enter the nucleus and activate gene expression. A multisubunit IκB kinase complex (IKK) phosphorylates IκB proteins and mediates the activation of NF-κB by proinflammatory stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor α. Phosphorylation of IκB proteins triggers their polyubiquitination and their subsequent recognition and degradation by the proteasome. The IKK complex contains two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and a noncatalytic subunit, NF-κB essential modifier/IKKγ. IKK activation depends upon the phosphorylation of residues in the activation loop of IKKβ and the subsequent activation of IKKβ kinase activity. However, the events contributing to IKKβ phosphorylation are not well understood. Here, we present evidence that the activation of IKKβ depends on its ability to form homotypic interactions and to transautophosphorylate. We find that an intact leucine zipper in IKKβ is necessary for homotypic interactions, kinase activation, and phosphorylation on its activation loop. Enforced oligomerization of an IKKβ mutant defective in forming homotypic interactions restores kinase activation. Homotypic interactions allow IKKβ molecules to transautophosphorylate one another on their activation loops.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2321-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). The IKK complex contains three distinct subunits, namely IKKα, IKKβ, and NEMO (or IKKγ) (1Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3309) Google Scholar, 2Silverman N. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2321-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Subunit reconstitution experiments in yeast and mammalian cells suggest that IKK is composed of a NEMO homodimer bound together with either an IKKα/IKKβ heterodimer or an IKKβ homodimer (3Miller B.S. Zandi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36320-36326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have indicated that IKKα and IKKβ have distinct biochemical functions. Gene disruption experiments in mice have demonstrated that IKKβ plays an essential role in NF-κB activation in response to most stimuli, whereas IKKα seems to be largely dispensable (1Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3309) Google Scholar). Also, IKKβ and IKKα have been shown to have different substrate preferences in vitro. IKKβ has been shown to have a higher specific activity for phosphorylating IκBα, whereas IKKα has a preference for using the NF-κB2 (p100) precursor as a substrate (4Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krahn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.C. Karin M. Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). TNF-α and interleukin-1 stimulate the phosphorylation of IKKβ on two serine residues, Ser179 and Ser181, found in its activation loop. Phosphorylation on both of these sites is required for IKK activation (5Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). However, the regulatory mechanisms governing this phosphorylation event are not understood. It has been proposed that the activation of IKK depends upon its recruitment to the TNF-α receptor signaling complex upon ligand binding (6Zhang S.Q. Kovalenko A. Cantarella G. Wallach D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 7Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Although it seems that only a small fraction of total IKK is recruited to the membrane, activation of this fraction of IKK may be sufficient to stimulate the activation of other remaining inactive IKK complexes through transautophosphorylation events. One possible mechanism whereby IKK may initially be activated is through the activity of an IKKβ kinase. Although many candidate IKKβ kinases (based on overexpression transient transfection studies) have been proposed in the literature, only a few of these kinases have been shown genetically in cultured cells or animal models to be important for IKK activation. Two of these IKKβ kinases, MEKK3 and ζPKC, have been implicated (based upon gene disruption experiments) to be upstream regulators of IKK (8Yang J. Lin Y. Guo Z. Cheng J. Huang J. Deng L. Liao W. Chen Z. Liu Z. Su B. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 9Leitges M. Sanz L. Martin P. Duran A. Braun U. Garcia J.F. Camacho F. Diaz-Meco M.T. Rennert P.D. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 771-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). MEKK3 was shown to be required for IKK activation in response to TNF-α and interleukin-1 signaling in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (8Yang J. Lin Y. Guo Z. Cheng J. Huang J. Deng L. Liao W. Chen Z. Liu Z. Su B. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In contrast, ζPKC was found to be important in mice for IKK activation in response to TNF-α in the mouse lung but not in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (9Leitges M. Sanz L. Martin P. Duran A. Braun U. Garcia J.F. Camacho F. Diaz-Meco M.T. Rennert P.D. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 771-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Recently, TAK1 was found to be important for IKK activation in HeLa cells in experiments using small interfering RNAs (10Takaesu G. Surabhi R.M. Park K.J. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Gaynor R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). It seems likely that different cell types may rely on distinct IKKβ kinases to activate IKK. Another possible mechanism whereby the initial pool of IKK may be activated is through an induced proximity mechanism. In such a scenario, the oligomerization of an IKK activator and interactor such as receptor interacting protein may induce the proximity of IKK complexes and facilitate mutual transautophosphorylation (11Poyet J.L. Srinivasula S.M. Lin J.H. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Yamaoka S. Tsichlis P.N. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol.

Of note, we and others have shown that enforced oligomerization of IKK subunits including IKKβ by artificial chemical agents can lead to enhanced IKK and NF-κB activity (11Poyet J.L. Srinivasula S.M.

Although it has also been shown that the overexpression of active IKKβ leads to its autophosphorylation, the ability of IKKβ molecules to transautophosphorylate serines on its activation loop has not been yet demonstrated. Furthermore, the oligomerization of any IKK subunits in vivo in response to stimuli has also not been shown. In this report we provide evidence that IKKβ activation requires the ability of IKKβ molecules to oligomerize and to phosphorylate one another on their activation loops. An intact leucine zipper in IKKβ is required for homotypic interactions, kinase activation, and activation loop phosphorylation. Furthermore, enforced oligomerization of an IKKβ mutant defective in making homotypic interactions restores kinase activation. Homotypic interactions permit IKKβ molecules to transphosphorylate one another in vivo on their activation loops. Last of all, TNF-α stimulates the homotypic interactions between IKKβ proteins in cultured cells. Our results suggest a model whereby ligand-induced IKKβ homotypic interactions lead to IKKβ transautophosphorylation and consequently IKKβ activation.

Lysates were incubated with antibody and protein G-Sepharose, and immunoprecipitates were washed three times with IP lysis buffer. All immunoprecipitates were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with FLAG M2, phospho-IKKβ (Cell Signaling), or phospho-IκBα antibody (Cell Signaling). To minimize the detection of the IgG heavy chain, protein A conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was used as a secondary antibody for anti-NEMO immunoblots. For coimmunoprecipitation assays, cells were lysed in EBC150 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), and lysates were incubated with the appropriate antibody for 2 h at 4 °C and with protein GSepharose for an additional 1 h. All immunoprecipitates were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. Kinase Assays—To measure IKKβ activity, cells were lysed in kinase lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 30 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol) 24 h after transfection, and anti-NEMO immunoprecipitates were incubated in 20-μl reactions containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 15 μm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 μg of GST-IκBα-(1–54), and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN) at 30 °C for 20 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and exposed to x-ray film. GSTIκBα-(1–54) was purified from DH5α transformed with pGEX-IκBα-(1–54) (a gift of M. Karin). For oligomerization-inducing experiments, transfected 293T cells were treated with 100 nm AP1510 or vehicle (ethanol) for 30 min prior to cell lysis.

This activity has been attributed to phosphorylation of Ser179/Ser181 in the activation loop because a purified IKKβ mutant with alanine substitutions at Ser179/Ser181 is inactive when purified under the same conditions (5Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 13Zandi E. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1998; 281: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This result could be attributed to the endogenous activity of an IKKβ kinase, autoactivation by IKKβ molecules, or a combination of the two. To study the mechanism whereby IKKβ autoactivation may proceed, we first sought to construct a version of IKKβ that would not autoactivate. To achieve this goal, we chose to disrupt the leucine zipper motif in IKKβ. Previous reports have suggested that the leucine zipper of IKKα is important for homotypic interactions with itself and heterotypic interactions with IKKβ (15Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar). However, the leucine zipper of IKKβ has yet to be characterized functionally. To generate a mutant of IKKβ with a nonfunctional leucine zipper, we substituted the methionine residue at position 472 within the predicted leucine zipper motif of IKKβ with a serine residue (M472S). This mutation rendered IKKβ defective in binding to wild-type IKKβ but not NEMO in coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 1A and data not shown). Furthermore, this mutation significantly impaired the kinase activity of IKKβ. The M472S mutant demonstrated significantly reduced autophosphorylation activity and kinase activity toward recombinant IκBα (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that autoactivation by IKKβ in cells requires homotypic IKKβ interactions. To determine whether the M472S mutation affected the ability of IKKβ to be phosphorylated on its activation loop, we immunoprecipitated epitope-tagged wild-type and mutant IKKβ proteins from transfected cells and performed immunoblotting using an antibody that specifically recognizes Ser181 of IKKβ. We compared wild-type IKKβ with the M472S mutant and a mutant of IKKβ with both Ser179 and Ser181 mutated to Ala (S179A/S181A). We found that in contrast to wild-type IKKβ, both the M472S and S179A/S181A mutants were not detectably phosphorylated on Ser181 (Fig. 2). Thus oligomerization of IKKβ seems to be required for the phosphorylation of residues in its activation loop, thereby leading to kinase activation. If the impaired kinase activity of the M472S mutant was caused by impaired phosphorylation of the activation loop, mimicking the phosphorylation of these residues in this mutant should be able to restore kinase activity. To mimic phosphorylation of IKKβ, we mutated the two serines in the activation loop of the M472S mutant to glutamic acid residues (M472S/S179E/S181E). Similar glutamic acid substitutions alone have been shown to yield a constitutively active kinase (17Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1858) Google Scholar). We found that introduction of the glutamic acid substitutions restored the kinase activity of the M472S mutant, as assessed by in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 3A). We wanted to see whether similar results were also seen with IKKβ kinase activity in vivo as well. Expression of the M472S mutant was able to elicit IκBα phosphorylation in vivo only when glutamic acid substitutions were made in the activation loop (Fig. 3B). Thus, the M472S mutant is inactive because of its inability to stimulate phosphorylation in its activation loop.Fig. 3Replacement of Ser179/181 with phosphomimetic residues restores the kinase activity of the leucine zipper IKKβ mutant both in vitro and in vivo. A, 293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3 (–), FLAG-tagged wild-type IKKβ (WT), IKKβ(M472S) (M472S), IKKβ(S179E/S181E) (EE), or IKKβ(M472S/S179E/S181E) (M472S/EE), as indicated. Lysates were prepared, and anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates (IP) were treated as in Fig. 1B. B, 293T cells transfected with HA-IκBα and pcDNA3 (–), FLAG-tagged wild-type IKKβ, IKKβ(S179E/S181E), IKKβ(K44M/S179E/S181E) (K44M/EE), IKKβ(M472S), or IKKβ(M472S/S179E/S181E), as indicated. Anti-HA immunoprecipitates were probed with phospho-IκBα or HA antibody. Alternatively, lysates were probed with FLAG M2 antibody to detect levels of IKKβ proteins (bottom). IB, immunoblot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Given that the M472S mutant is impaired both in oligomerization and kinase activity, a likely possibility is that oligomerization contributes to kinase activation. If the inactivity of the M472S mutant was caused primarily by the inability to oligomerize, enforced oligomerization of the M472S mutant should lead to its activation. To test this idea, we fused the M472S mutant to three tandem repeated oligomerization domains of Fpk (Fpk3). This protein tag can be induced to oligomerize by the cell-permeable artificial ligand AP1510 (18MacCorkle R.A. Freeman K.W. Spencer D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3655-3660Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We compared the kinase activity of Fpk3 fusion protein in the presence of AP1510 or vehicle treatment. For comparison, we also fused versions of the M472S mutant containing activation loop substitutions to alanine or glutamic acid residues. In the presence of the oligomerizer AP1510, the kinase activity of the M472S mutant was restored with respect to both IκBα phosphorylation and autophosphorylation (Fig. 4). M472S mutants also containing activation loop substitutions to alanine or glutamic acid residues were inactive and constitutively active, respectively. Also, their activities were unaffected in the presence of oligomerizer, suggesting that the activating effect of AP1510 proceeded through phosphorylation of Ser179 and Ser181 (Fig. 4). Thus, IKKβ oligomerization can result in IKKβ phosphorylation and activation. One can imagine that the oligomerization of IKKβ might lead directly to IKKβ activation through transautophosphorylation or indirectly though an IKKβ-associated kinase. To examine whether transphosphorylation of IKKβ molecules contributed to phosphorylation of the activation loop, we cotransfected the dead kinase K44M mutant along with different amounts of a constitutively active IKKβ/S179E/S181E mutant. Of note, the K44M mutant is not phosphorylated on Ser181 and cannot autophosphorylate itself (Fig. 1B and data not shown). After transfections, we immunoprecipitated the K44M mutant from cells and performed immunoblot analysis with phospho-IKKβ antibody. We found that phosphorylation of Ser181 in the K44M mutant was induced by IKKβ/S179E/S181E. In contrast, a version of the K44M mutant carrying an M472S substitution as well could not be phosphorylated (Fig. 5). Thus, IKKβ transphosphorylation contributes to IKKβ activation loop phosphorylation. To examine whether oligomerization of IKKβ occurred in response to TNF-α, we cotransfected two IKKβ constructs with different epitope tags and performed coimmunoprecipitation assays after cell stimulation with TNF-α for various times. To perform this experiment, we had to use low levels of expression plasmids, as higher expression of IKKβ led to constitutive oligomerization and activation. We found that TNF-α stimulation of cells resulted in the coimmunoprecipitation of IKKβ proteins (Fig. 6). These data provide evidence that IKKβ oligomerization can be induced by a physiological stimulus in vivo. In this report, we provide evidence for a model of IKK activation whereby ligand-induced IKKβ homotypic interactions lead to transautophosphorylation and consequently IKK activation. Although our results indicate that enforced oligomerization of an IKKβ mutant defective in forming homotypic interactions is sufficient to restore activation, it is unclear from our experiments whether oligomerization of IKKβ alone is sufficient to activate IKKβ. A model in which IKKβ molecules autoactivate one another necessarily implies that an “initial pool” of active IKKβ exists. One could imagine that this pool of active IKKβ molecules might be derived from a preexisting fraction of IKKβ in unstimulated cells. Alternatively, this pool of IKKβ may be the product of the activity of an inducible kinase such as MEKK3, ζPKC, or TAK1 (8Yang J. Lin Y. Guo Z. Cheng J. Huang J. Deng L. Liao W. Chen Z. Liu Z. Su B.

The biochemical mechanism underlying the phosphorylation of IKKβ is likely to be complicated further by other events such as the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of NEMO (5Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 19Carter R.S. Pennington K.N. Ungurait B.J. Ballard D.W. J. Biol.

Another unresolved issue is whether oligomerization and phosphorylation of IKKβ are separable or interrelated events. For instance, in addition to amplifying the pool of active IKKβ molecules through transautophosphorylation, IKKβ oligomerization may conceivably facilitate the recognition of inactive IKKβ molecules by an IKKβ kinase. Current investigations are focused on clarifying these and other important issues regarding the mechanism of IKK activation.

We demonstrated that a servomechanism operates between progesterone and prolactin and their receptors in the regulation of uterine gene expression (1Chilton B.S. Mani S.K. Bullock D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 1169-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Prolactin receptor is regulated by progesterone, and prolactin augments the progesterone-dependent increase in uteroglobin mRNA. The search for factors responsible for this cross-talk at the promoter culminated in the cloning and characterization of RUSH-1α and -β (2Hayward-Lester A. Hewetson A. Beale E.G. Oefner P.J. Doris P.A. Chilton B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1335-1349PubMed Google Scholar). The RUSH acronym identified two alternatively spliced rabbit uteroglobin promoter-binding proteins as SWI/SNF-related helicases/ATPases. Coincidentally, the human (3Sheridan P.L. Schorpp M. Voz M.L.

Gene (Amst.). 1997; 202: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) orthologs for RUSH-1α were cloned and characterized. According to the newest nomenclature, SMARCA3, the symbol for the human gene, and Smarca3, the symbol for the mouse gene, refer to the common characteristics: SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a, member 3. These symbols supersede the original human (HIP116, HLTF, and Zbu1) and mouse (P113) designations. If the human nomenclature system is applied to all species other than mouse, then the rabbit ortholog is designated rabbit SMARCA3 with the retention of RUSH as the trivial name to be used interchangeably with rabbit RUSH/SMARCA3.SMARCA3 is highly conserved among eukaryotes. For example, the cDNA and amino acid sequences for RUSH-1α and SMARCA3 are 91% identical. A DNA binding domain, a nuclear localization signal, seven DNA-dependent ATPase domains and a C3HC4 RING finger motif (7Devine J.H. Hewetson A. Lee V.H. Chilton B.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) characterize both proteins. In contrast, RUSH-1β is truncated after the RING finger such that three of the seven DNA-dependent ATPase domains are deleted from its C terminus. The RING finger, a specialized type of zinc finger, is a putative scaffold for macromolecular assembly (8Kentis A. Gordon R.E. Borden K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15404-15409Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This motif in RUSH and its human counterpart are highly conserved (7Devine J.H. Hewetson A. Lee V.H. Chilton B.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), i.e. they differ by a single amino acid substitution, and the spacing between the metal-coordinating residues is identical. Although the exact role of the RING domain in RUSH remains unclear, this motif contains a protein interaction site that binds an inner nuclear envelope protein (9Mansharamani M. Hewetson A. Chilton B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3641-3649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Despite the highly conserved structure of RUSH and its SMARCA3 relatives, the character of the cognate binding sites is highly variable. Identified by three different research groups as a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, SMARCA3 binds to the B box of the plasminogen activator inhibitor gene (10Ding H. Benotmane A.M. Suske G.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19573-19580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the SPH repeats of the SV40 enhancer and the human immunodeficiency virus 1 promoter (3Sheridan P.L. Schorpp M. Voz M.L. Jones K.A. J. Biol.

Bogdanova N. Neville C. Nguyen T. Clark H. Khatib Z.A. Valentine M. Look A.T. Rosenthal N. Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 166-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). RUSH binds to a unique site (A/C)C(A/T)T(A/T/G)(G/T) (MCWTDK) in the uteroglobin promoter (11Hewetson A. Hendrix E.C. Mansharamani M. Lee V.H. Chilton B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2101-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This paradox, in which ubiquitous, highly conserved transcription factors bind degenerate target sequences, provides the opportunity for remarkable promiscuity in so-called gene-specific binding.Functional diversity is further emphasized by the fact that RUSH orthologs have been implicated in chromatin reorganization as well as transcriptional activation and repression. Strong DNA-dependent ATPase activity was demonstrated for human and mouse SMARCA3. Activation of the plasminogen activator inhibitor gene (PAI-1) in HeLa cells (4Ding H. Descheemaeker K. Marynen P. Nelles L. Carvalho T. Carmo-Fonseca M. Collen D. Belayew A. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and in 30A5 cells (6Zhang Q. Ekhterae D. Kim K.-H. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 202: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) provided direct evidence that these proteins are transcription factors. Additional actions of SMARCA3 include a link to facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (12Ding H. Beckers M.-C. Plaisance S. Marynen P. Collen D. Belayew A. Hum. Mol. Gen. 1998; 7: 1681-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), colon cancer suppression (13Moinova H.R. Chen W.-D. Shen L. Smiraglia D. Olechnowicz J. Ravi L. Kasturi L. Myeroff L. Plass C. Parsons R. Minna J. Willson J.K.V. Green S.B. Issa J.-P. Markowitz S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4562-4567Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and preferential activation of β-globin gene transcription (14Mahajan M.C. Weissman S.M. Blood. 2002; 99: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Clearly these DNA-binding proteins are associated with both gene activation and gene silencing. However, little is known about how they are regulated. Neither the human nor the mouse SMARCA3 promoters have been fully characterized. RUSH, on the other hand, is the prototypical, steroid-regulated, SMARCA3-related gene. Northern analysis showed that progesterone-treatment increased the uterine content of RUSH message. Competitive reverse transcription-PCR and high performance liquid chromatography analysis confirmed a steroid-dependent alternative splicing mechanism (2Hayward-Lester A. Hewetson A. Beale E.G. Oefner P.J. Doris P.A. Chilton B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1335-1349PubMed Google Scholar) in which RUSH-1α is the progesterone-dependent splice variant. The next step toward understanding the potential involvement of progesterone in regulating transcription required systematic analysis of the RUSH promoter.Cloning and characterizing the RUSH promoter and its contiguous 5′-upstream regulatory sequence showed that RUSH transcription is driven by an Inr/downstream promoter element (DPE) 1The abbreviations used are: DPE, downstream promoter element; UTR, untranslated region; TF, transcription factor; Sp, specific protein; NF-Y, nuclear factor Y; PRE, progesterone response element.1The abbreviations used are: DPE, downstream promoter element; UTR, untranslated region; TF, transcription factor; Sp, specific protein; NF-Y, nuclear factor Y; PRE, progesterone response element. combination that is highly conserved in the putative SMARCA3 promoter. RUSH is negatively regulated by two Sp1 sites, which are also highly conserved in the human counterpart. In contrast, the PRE half-site/overlapping Y-box elements with their opposing effects on progesterone-dependent transactivation appear unique to RUSH. Autorepression of the RUSH gene also indicates that negative feedback is involved in the control of this progesterone-induced gene. In fact, negative regulation of RUSH by Sp1, NF-Y, and RUSH indicates that suppression of transcription is the major mechanism that controls basal expression of a gene that is regulated by steroid-dependent posttranscriptional processing.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Tools—A rabbit genomic library in the EMBL3 SP6/T7 vector, TaqStart antibody, Tth Start antibody, Advantage Genomic PCR kit, and Advantage Tth polymerase mix were purchased from Clontech Laboratories, Inc.

Samples were rapidly cooled to 4 °C. Individual PCR products (1352, 802, and 252 bp) were cloned into pCRII-TOPO, excised with appropriate restriction enzymes, and directionally subcloned into the SacI-NheI sites of the pGL3-Basic vector. Insert orientation was confirmed by sequencing in both directions by the dideoxy chain termination method.Nine putative sites in the RUSH promoter were mutated individually or in combination with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit to produce a total of 34 constructs. For all reactions except the ones in which the putative RUSH site was tested, 50 ng of the 252-bp SacI/XbaI PCR fragment (-162/+90) of the rabbit RUSH gene in the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3-Basic was used as template. To test the putative RUSH site, 50 ng of the 802-bp SacI/XbaI PCR fragment (-712/+90) was used. Each 50-μl reaction mix contained buffer (1×), Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (2.5 units), dNTPs (0.2 mm each), and primers (125 ng each). Oligonucleotides that were used as primers for mutagenesis are shown in Table I. Cycle parameters were as follows: 30 s at 95 °C followed by 15 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 60 s, and 68 °C for 11 min. Samples were rapidly cooled to 4 °C. The parental (non-mutated) DNA template was digested for 2 h at 37 °C with 1 μl of DpnI (10 units/μl). The authenticity of the mutagenized site was confirmed by sequencing. Mutated DNA was used in standard transformation reactions.Transient Transfection Assays—Differential RUSH expression was evaluated in two different SV40-transformed rabbit uterine epithelial cell lines. HRE-H9 cells were derived from the endometrium of 3-month-old female rabbits treated with 10 international units of human chorionic gonadotropin for 3 days (15Li W.I. Chen C.L. Chou J.Y. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 2862-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). RBE-7 cells were derived from the endometrium of similarly aged rabbits treated with progesterone (1 mg/kg/day) for 3 consecutive days (16Mukherjee A.B. Murty L.C. Chou J.Y. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 94: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).Cells were grown in α-modified minimum essential medium plus 4% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 international units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), amphotericin B (250 ng/ml), andl-glutamine (20 mm) in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 at 33 °C. As verified by RIA, charcoal stripping reduced estradiol levels to <0.6 pg/ml. When the effects of progesterone were tested, cultures were treated with R5020 (10-8m) in dimethyl sulfoxide (0.1% v/v) for 20 h. Controls were treated with vehicle alone for the same amount of time. Cells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates and transfected at a ratio of 500:1 in the absence of serum at 50-60% confluency with 100 ng of pRUSH-LUC DNA and 200 pg of pRL-TK-LUC (transfection efficiency control) in 5 μl of PLUS reagent with 2 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent. After 3 h of incubation, the volume of medium was increased to normal (0.5 ml/well), and the final concentration of serum was restored to 4%. Transfections were performed in quadruplicate, and pRUSH-LUC activity was normalized to pRL-TK-LUC activity. Multiple ratio data were ranked (17Conover W.J. Iman R.L. Am. Stat. 1981; 35: 124-129Crossref Google Scholar), and the ranks between the groups were analyzed by analysis of variance, followed by Student-Newman-Keuls multiple range test (p < 0.05 significance level) using GraphPad InStat Version 3 for Macintosh (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Transfection assays with/without the mutagenized RUSH site were evaluated by an unpaired t test with a Welch correction (p < 0.05 significance level).Primer Extension and Sequence Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from the endometrium of a progesterone-treated rabbit by the cold precipitation method of Han et al. (18Han J.H. Stratowa C. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1617-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Poly(A+) RNA was isolated by chromatography on oligodeoxythmidylic acid-cellulose (19Avia H. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 1408-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (5177) Google Scholar). An end-labeled oligonucleotide (5′-CGC CGG GTC TAA TCA GAC GTC GTC GCC-3′; see Fig. 1) complementary to the 5′-most end of RUSH cDNA sequence was hybridized to 1.0 μg of poly(A+) RNA. This primer hybridized less than 100 bases downstream from the 5′-end of the RNA and did not self-anneal. The size of the single primer extension product was determined by resolution on denaturing 8% polyacrylamide gels (7 m urea) together with 32P-labeled øX174 HinfI DNA markers and products from positive (87 bp) and negative (no RNA) control reactions. The product from the primer extension reaction was also resolved against a sequencing reaction with the same primer.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation and PCR—All studies with New Zealand White rabbits were conducted according to the NIH Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. For chromatin immunoprecipitation one virgin, adult female rabbit received subcutaneous injections of ovine prolactin (2 mg/day) for 5 days followed by progesterone (3 mg/kg/day) for 5 days. Nuclei were isolated from the endometrium as described by Kleis-SanFrancisco et al. (20Kleis-SanFrancisco S. Hewetson A. Chilton B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 214-223PubMed Google Scholar).Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed according to Hewetson et al. (11Hewetson A. Hendrix E.C. Mansharamani M. Lee V.H. Chilton B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2101-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclei (1 × 108/experiment) were collected by centrifugation (1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C) and resuspended in buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) that contained the following protease inhibitors: leupeptin (1 μg/ml), antipain (2 μg/ml), benzamidine (10 μg/ml), chymostatin (10 μg/ml), pepstatin (10 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mm). Chromatin was digested in situ with 250 units/ml Sau3A1 for 30 min at 37 °C. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation (750 × g for 2 min at 4 °C), resuspended in 1 ml of buffer (12 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 3 mm EDTA plus the mixture of protease inhibitors described above), and mixed (tumbled) at 4 °C for 30-60 min. Nuclear debris was collected by centrifugation (750 × g for 2 min at 4 °C). The supernatant containing soluble chromatin was transferred to a new tube. Sodium chloride and bovine serum albumin were added to final concentrations of 100 mm and 1 mg/ml, respectively, and the tube was incubated for 5 min at 4 °C. Residual nuclear debris was collected by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C).The chromatin supernatant was preabsorbed with protein A/G PLUS-Sepharose beads for 60 min at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation (1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C). The supernatant was divided into two aliquots which were incubated plus 2 μg of the relevant antibodies, i.e. RUSH-1α(β), progesterone receptor, or NF-Y, with continuous mixing (tumbling) for 60 min at 4 °C. Protein A/G PLUS-Sepharose beads were added with continuous mixing (tumbling) for 60 min at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation (3000 × g for 30 s) and washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2. Beads were resuspended in buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% SDS, 100 mm NaCl) containing Pronase (1 mg/ml) and incubated for 1 h at 50 °C. The DNA was extracted with phenol:chloroform (1:1) and precipitated with ethanol. DNA (50 ng) aliquots were amplified in 50-μl PCR reactions containing LA PCR buffer (1×), TaKaRa ExTaq DNA polymerase (2.5 units/50 μl), TaqStart antibody (0.55 μg/50 μl), dNTPs (0.2 mm each), and primers (0.2 mm each).The forward (5′-GCA ACC GGG ACC CCC ACT G-3′) and reverse (5′-GAC CAG CGA CGC TCT GAC TG-3′) primers flank a 136-bp region (-98/+38) of the RUSH promoter that contains the putative PRE half-site/overlapping Y-box. A 5-step PCR reaction was performed with the following conditions: 30 s at 94 °C followed by 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 63 °C for 60 s, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 63.5 °C for 60 s, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 64 °C for 60 s, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 64.5 °C for 60 s, 15 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 65 °C for 60 s, and a final extension for 10 min at 68 °C. Samples were rapidly cooled to 4 °C. Reaction products were fractionated by electrophoresis on a 4% NuSieve GTG-agarose gel. The 136-bp amplicons were extracted from a single band with QIAEX II according to the manufacturer's instructions, ligated to pCRII-TOPO, and sequenced in both directions by the dideoxy chain termination method.The forward (5′-CCC GAG GCC ACA GGT CCA TCG TC-3′) and reverse (5′-GTC ATT TCT TAG CGC GGG AAG ACT GTG ACG-3′) primers flank a 168-bp region (-712/-545) of the RUSH promoter that contains the putative RUSH binding site. A 5-step PCR reaction was performed with the following conditions: 30 s at 94 °C followed by 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 70 °C for 120 s, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 69.5 °C for 120 s, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 69 °C for 120 s, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 68.5 °C for 120 s, 15 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 68 °C for 120 s, and a final extension for 10 min at 68 °C. Samples were rapidly cooled to 4 °C. Reaction products were fractionated by electrophoresis on a 4% NuSieve GTG-agarose gel. The 168-bp amplicons were extracted from a single band with QIAEX II according to the manufacturer's instructions, ligated to pCRII-TOPO, and sequenced in both directions by the dideoxy chain termination method.Nuclear Extracts and Gel Shift Assays—Nuclear extract proteins were prepared from the endometrium as described by Kleis-SanFrancisco et al. (20Kleis-SanFrancisco S. Hewetson A. Chilton B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 214-223PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extract proteins were isolated from HRE-H9 cells as follows. Cells in 100-mm culture dishes were washed with calcium- and magnesium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution and scraped into the same solution (3 ml/dish). Cells were collected by centrifugation (1875 × g) for 5 min at 4 °C, and the packed cell volume was estimated. Cells were resuspended (5× packed cell volume) in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm KCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol) that contained the protease inhibitors leupeptin (1 μg/ml), antipain (2 μg/ml), benzamidine (10 μg/ml), chymostatin (10 μg/ml), pepstatin (10 μg/ml), phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mm). Cells were again collected by centrifugation at 4 °C and resuspended in ice-cold hypotonic buffer containing 0.4% Nonidet P-40. An equal volume of ice-cold hypotonic buffer was added to dilute the detergent to 0.2%. The cell suspension was mixed, and cells were collected by centrifugation at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in ice-cold hypotonic buffer and homogenized (10 strokes) with a Dounce tissue homogenizer (pestle A). Isolated nuclei were resuspended in nuclear extract buffer (0.4 m KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) and placed on ice for 10 min. Nuclei were separated from extract by centrifugation (1500 × g) for 10 min at 4 °C. Extract was made 15% glycerol (V/V) and stored in 25-μl aliquots at -80 °C.TF-TF Interaction Arrays—One virgin adult female rabbit received subcutaneous injections of progesterone (3 mg/kg/day) for 5 days. Nuclear proteins were extracted from nuclei isolated from the endometrium according to Kleis-SanFrancisco et al. (20Kleis-SanFrancisco S. Hewetson A. Chilton B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 214-223PubMed Google Scholar). The TransSignal TF-TF Interaction array was processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 50 μg of nuclear extract protein was incubated with biotin-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probes, i.e. a library of cis elements. RUSH plus affiliated transcription factors were immunoprecipitated with a mixture (1 μg) of affinity-purified anti-RUSH-1α(β) (2Hayward-Lester A. Hewetson A. Beale E.G. Oefner P.J. Doris P.A. Chilton B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1335-1349PubMed Google Scholar) and anti-RUSH-1α (11Hewetson A. Hendrix E.C. Mansharamani M. Lee V.H. Chilton B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2101-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) antibodies and magnetic protein G beads. For the negative control, the antibodies were replaced with normal IgG. Free cis elements and nonspecific binding proteins were washed away. RUSH-affiliated biotin-labeled probes were eluted from the magnetic beads and hybridized to TranSignal Protein/"
https://openalex.org/W2028849672,"Opioid receptors are expressed in a cell type-specific manner. Here we show that the mouse δ-opioid receptor (mDOR) gene is regulated by promoter region CpG methylation. The mDOR promoter containing a putative CpG island is highly methylated in Neuro2A cells, correlating with the repression of this gene in these cells. This is in contrast with the unmethylated state of the mDOR promoter in NS20Y cells, which express a high level of mDOR. Repression of mDOR transcription in Neuro2A cells could be partially relieved by chemically induced demethylation with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine. In addition, in vitro methylation of the luciferase reporter gene driven by the mDOR promoter resulted in an inhibition of transcription in NS20Y cells. Methyl-CpG-binding protein complex 1 (MeCP1) has been implicated in methylation-mediated transcriptional repression of several genes. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that fully methylated, but not unmethylated, mDOR promoter fragment formed a MeCP1-like protein complex that contained methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) and Sp3. Furthermore, the expression level of Sp3 was decreased when Neuro2A cells were demethylated with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, and increasing Sp3 levels in Schneider's Drosophila line 2 cells led to the repression of mDOR promoter activity when the promoter was methylated. These results demonstrate that Sp3 and MBD2 are involved in the transcriptional repression of mDOR in Neuro2A cells through binding to the methylated CpG sites in the promoter region and may play a role in the cell type-specific expression of mDOR.

Opioids display strong analgesic effects as well as addictive properties through the activation of three major types of G-protein-coupled receptors referred to as μ-, δ-, and κ-opioid receptors (1Kieffer B.L. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 15: 615-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Whereas all three opioid receptors mediate opioid-induced analgesia, each receptor type exerts a distinct pharmacological profile as well as a unique cell type-specific expression pattern (2Goldstein A. Naidu A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 265-272PubMed Google Scholar, 3Mansour A. Khachaturian H. Lewis M.E. Akil H. Watson S.J. Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 308-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). The expression of the δ-opioid receptor (DOR) 1The abbreviations used are: DOR, δ-opioid receptor; mDOR, mouse δ-opioid receptor; AdC, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine; GAPDH, glyceralde-hyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MBD, methyl-CpG-binding domain protein; MeCP, methyl-CpG-binding protein; HDAC, histone deacetylase; RT, reverse transcriptase. is mainly confined to certain regions of the adult central nervous system, although it is found in the peripheral nervous system and some immune cells. It has been reported that the expression levels of DOR determine the activities of the DOR agonist, and the localization of DOR generally matches the pharmacological action sites of δ-opioids. Thus understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the cell type-specific expression of DOR will provide insights into the regulation of the pharmacological benefits of δ-opioids by manipulation of the DOR expression levels in certain cell types. We reported previously (4Augustin L.B. Felsheim R.F. Min B.H. Fuchs S.M. Fuchs J.A. Loh H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) the isolation of mouse genomic clones of DOR (mDOR), and we identified transcription upstream stimulatory factors Sp1/Sp3 and Ets-1 that functionally interact with the mDOR promoter and activate it in a mouse neuronal cell line NS20Y (5Liu H.C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 45462-45469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As yet, no data are available on the mechanisms involved in the cell type-specific expression of mDOR. Methylation of the cytosine residue in the 5′-CpG-3′ sequence is an epigenetic modification involved in the establishment and maintenance of cell type-specific gene expression (7Futscher B.W. Oshiro M.M. Wozniak R.J. Holtan N. Hanigan C.L. Duan H. Domann F.E. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Methylation patterns of tissue-specific genes are unequivocally different from tissue to tissue (7Futscher B.W. Oshiro M.M. Wozniak R.J. Holtan N. Hanigan C.L. Duan H. Domann F.E. Nat.

The mDOR gene core promoter has a G + C content of more than 80%, raising the possibility that the CpG methylation may play a role in the regulation of cell type-specific expression of mDOR. Here we report that the suppression of mDOR expression in Neuro2A cells is a result of promoter region CpG methylation and that Sp3 and MBD2 are involved in transcriptional repression of the mDOR promoter through binding of methylated CpGs and may play a role in mDOR cell type-specific expression. Cell Culture and 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine (AdC) Treatment of Cells— The mouse neuroblastoma NS20Y and Neuro2A cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 10% CO2. Schneider's Drosophila line 2 (SL2) cells were grown at 22–24 °C in Schneider's Drosophila medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (complete medium). For AdC treatment experiments, cells were split to low density (105 cells/well of a 6-well culture plate) 24 h before treatment. Cells were then treated with AdC (2 or 10 μm) or mock-treated with same volume of phosphate-buffered saline for 72 h changing the medium every 24 h. Cells were harvested on day 4 for RNA determinations and Western blots. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was prepared using the TRIreagent Kit (Molecular Research Center) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reverse transcription reaction was carried out using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase from Invitrogen following the recommendations of the manufacturer. The PCR settings were as follows: 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C for 30 cycles. The primer sequences for the amplification of mDOR and GAPDH fragments are shown in Table I (DOR and GAPDH, respectively). The products were resolved on a 1.2% agarose gel. The total density of the mDOR mRNA bands was calculated using Scion Image for Windows software from Scion Corp. and normalized to the density of the GAPDH bands.Table IList of primers used in this study Primers are shown in 5′—3′ orientation.

Complete methylation was determined by digesting the DNA constructs with methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme HpaII (New England Biolabs) and running the products on an agarose gel. Only the DNA that was completely methylated was used. Transient Transfection and Reporter Gene Assay—The construction of all luciferase fusion plasmids (pD262, pD1300, and pD262/141) and the Drosophila expression vectors (pPacSp1 and pPacSp3) used in this study has been described previously (5Liu H.C.

NS20Y and Neuro2A cells were plated 24 h prior to transfection at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well onto 6-well culture plates. Transfection was carried out using the SuperFect Transfection reagent or Effectene Transfection reagent (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer. Cells were washed and lysed with lysis buffer (Promega) 48 h after transfection. To correct for differences in transfection efficiency, one-fifth molar ratio of a pCH110 plasmid (Amersham Biosciences) containing β-galactosidase gene under the SV40 promoter was included in the transfection. The luciferase and galactosidase activities of each lysate were determined as described by the manufacturers (Promega and Tropix, respectively). Drosophila SL2 cells were transfected with Effectene reagent (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, the DNA, buffer, and Enhancer were incubated for 5 min before adding the Effectene Reagent and incubated for 15 min to allow transfection complex formation. During this time, the medium was removed from the cells, and the cells were washed with 2 ml of Schneider's Drosophila medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (complete medium), and then resuspended in 1.6 ml of complete medium. 600 μl of complete medium was mixed with the Effectene-DNA complexes, added to the cells, and left on the cells until evaluation (48 h). Reporter activity was normalized to protein concentration using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Preparation of Genomic DNA and Bisulfite Treatment of DNA— Genomic DNA from the NS20Y and Neuro2A cells was isolated using Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega) and linearized with the restriction enzyme EcoRI. Bisulfite treatment of DNA was carried out as described previously (12Grunau C. Clark S.J. Rosenthal A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: E65Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Briefly, digested DNA (10 μg) was denatured in 0.3 m NaOH for 30 min at 39 °C and precipitated. Denatured DNA was then incubated with 3.1 m sodium bisulfite, 0.5 mm hydroquinone, pH 5.0, at 55 °C for 4 h under mineral oil. Bisulfite Sequencing and Methylation-specific PCR—Bisulfite-modified DNA was amplified by PCR. The primer sequences for the amplification of mDOR (bisulfite sequencing primers) are listed in Table I. PCR conditions are as follows: 94 °C for 2 min, after which 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and finally 10 min at 72 °C. The PCR mixture contained 1× PCR Buffer with MgCl2 (100 mm Tris-HCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 500 mm KCl, pH 8.3) from Roche Applied Science, 10 pmol of each primer, and 0.2 mm dNTPs. After PCR amplification, the PCR products were purified using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing reactions were performed with Applied Biosystems model 377 DNA Sequencers by the Advanced Genetic Analysis Center at the University of Minnesota by using M13 reverse primer. After bisulfite treatment, DNA was also amplified by methylation-specific PCR (13Herman J.G. Graff J.R. Myohanen S. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9821-9826Crossref PubMed Scopus (5231) Google Scholar). Two pairs of PCR primers, as shown in Table I, were designed to amplify specifically methylated or unmethylated DNA using a web-based primer design program (14Li L.C. Dahiya R. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). The PCR mixture contained 1× PCR Buffer with MgCl2 (100 mm Tris-HCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 500 mm KCl, pH 8.3) from Roche Applied Science, 10 pmol of each primer, and 0.2 mm dNTPs. PCR was carried out as follows: 2 min at 94 °C for one cycle, then 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 65 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for 30 cycles. PCR products were visualized by running a 1.2% agarose gel. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared by using method the described previously (5Liu H.C. Shen J.T. Augustin L.B. Ko J.L. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23617-23626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The probes used were CG11 (15Meehan R.R. Lewis J.D. McKay S. Kleiner E.L. Bird A.P. Cell. 1989; 58: 499-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), a 1350-bp fragment containing 20 GCGC sites and 7 CCGG sites, and 262/141, a 122-bp fragment from -262 to -141 bp upstream of mDOR promoter region. Each probe was labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Assay conditions were as described previously (15Meehan R.R. Lewis J.D. McKay S. Kleiner E.L. Bird A.P. Cell. 1989; 58: 499-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), using 2 μg of Micrococcus lysodeikticus genomic DNA (Sigma) digested with Sau3A (Roche Applied Science) as a non-specific competitor. For oligonucleotide competition analysis, a 100-fold (or as indicated in figures) molar excess of competitor oligonucleotides was also added to the mixture. For antibody supershift/ablation assays, the following pre-immune sera or antibodies were added to the mixture: mouse monoclonal antibody to MBD2 (Imgenex) and Sp1 (sc-420X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat polyclonal antibody to Sp3 (sc-644X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and goat pre-immune IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) before the addition of probe to nuclear extracts. The DNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Western Blot Assay—Whole cell extracts were prepared by resuspending cells in lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science), and incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation of the lysates at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, supernatants (cell extracts) were resolved on denaturing polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were incubated with 5% milk in 0.1% TTBS (3.025 g/liter Tris, 8.76 g/liter NaCl, pH 7.6, 1 ml/liter Tween 20) overnight at 4 °C. After washing with 0.1% TTBS on a rocking platform, the membranes were incubated with anti-Sp3 antibody (SC-644, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted in 0.1% TTBS (anti-Sp3 at 1:1000) for 1.5 h and then washed with 0.1% TTBS. The antirabbit alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) diluted in TTBS (1:1000) was then incubated with membrane at room temperature with gentle agitation and washed in TTBS, and antigen-antibody complexes were detected using ECF Western blotting Detection Reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Expression of mDOR in NS20Y and Neuro2A Cells—NS20Y and Neuro2A are mouse neuronal cells with different mDOR expression levels. Northern blot analysis demonstrated the presence of an mDOR transcript in NS20Y cells but not in Neuro2A cells (16Smirnov D. Im H.J. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This expression profile was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1A). Although a high level of mDOR mRNA was detected in NS20Y cells, only a low expression level was seen in Neuro2A cells. The detection of an mDOR transcript in Neuro2A cells indicates that these cells have no defect in the basal transcription machinery that is required for the expression of the mDOR gene. This is further confirmed by the results using a transient transfection assay, where the mDOR promoter construct pD262 was introduced into Neuro2A and NS20Y cells (Fig. 1B). In contrast with the data obtained by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1A), Neuro2A and NS20Y cells showed almost the same level of luciferase activity of the core promoter construct pD262. Methylation Status of the mDOR Gene Promoter Region in NS20Y and Neuro2A Cells—Because we could not detect any obvious defect in the mDOR gene nor in the transcriptional machinery, we explored the possibility that expression of mDOR in Neuro2A cells is epigenetically regulated by CpG methylation. Sequence analysis revealed that the promoter region of mDOR is (G + C)-rich with a putative CpG island between -491 and -50, relative to the ATG start codon (Fig. 2A, gray area). This region fulfils the criteria of a CpG island on the basis of its size (>200 bp), GC content (>50%), and CpG dinucleotide frequency (observed/expected >0.6). CpG islands in several tissue-specific genes are often methylated in many human and mouse cell lines. Hypermethylation of normally unmethylated CpG islands correlates with transcriptional repression. To obtain information about the methylation status of the mDOR promoter region, bisulfite genomic sequencing was carried out (12Grunau C. Clark S.J. Rosenthal A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: E65Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA isolated from NS20Y and Neuro2A cells was treated with bisulfite under the conditions described under “Materials and Methods.” Fig. 2B shows the methylation pattern of the mDOR core promoter region of the indicated cell lines. In NS20Y cells where prominent mDOR expression was detected, the mDOR promoter was completely unmethylated, whereas this gene was partially methylated in Neuro2A cells that showed a low level of mDOR expression. The occurrence of methylated CpGs in Neuro2A cells was less frequent than that of unmethylated CpGs. We obtained results consistent with the above using methylation-specific PCR (13Herman J.G. Graff J.R. Myohanen S. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9821-9826Crossref PubMed Scopus (5231) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, the mDOR promoter was fully unmethylated in NS20Y cells, whereas both methylated and unmethylated alleles existed in Neuro2A cells. Most of the genomic DNA from Neuro2A was unmethylated as indicated by the amount of PCR product amplified. These data showed a strong negative correlation between the methylation status of the mDOR promoter and mDOR gene expression in NS20Y and Neuro2A cells. In Vitro Methylation of the Promoter Region Induces the Repression of the mDOR Promoter Activity—In order to determine whether the mDOR promoter activity is regulated by CpG methylation, reporter gene assays were performed. Luciferase fusion plasmids containing 1.3 kb (pD1300) or 262 bp (pD262) of upstream regulatory sequences of the mDOR gene (5Liu H.C. Shen J.T. Augustin L.B. Ko J.L. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23617-23626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) were methylated by either partial methylase HpaII or full methylase SssI in vitro and subsequently transfected into NS20Y cells. Partial methylation of the luciferase constructs induced about 60% reduction in promoter activity compared with the mock-methylated constructs, whereas full methylation of the constructs completely suppressed the promoter activity (Fig. 3), suggesting that methylation of the promoter can contribute to the repression of mDOR gene transcription in a methylation density-dependent manner. Increase of mDOR Expression after AdC Treatment in Neuro2A Cells—To test further the potential role of DNA methylation in the regulation of cell type-specific mDOR expression, demethylation was induced by treating cells with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, AdC. Neuro2A cells were grown for 72 h in the presence of 2 or 10 μm AdC. This treatment increased the transcription of mDOR as shown by RT-PCR (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting that the demethylation of the mDOR gene is critical for its expression. Methylated mDOR Core Promoter Region Sequences Bind to a Methyl-CpG-binding Protein Complexes 1 (MeCP1)-like Complex in Nuclear Extracts from Neuro2A Cells—Direct binding of specific methyl-CpG-binding proteins to methylated DNA appears to be a major mechanism of methylation-induced transcriptional repression (17Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether the transcriptional repression conferred by the methylated mDOR promoter correlates with its affinity for methyl-CpG-binding proteins. The known proteins and complexes that bind preferentially to methylated CpG dinucleotides include methyl-CpG-binding protein complexes 1 and 2 (MeCP1 and MeCP2) (17Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar). MeCP1 was the first one to be identified as a nuclear factor that could discriminate between methylated and unmethylated DNA (15Meehan R.R. Lewis J.D. McKay S. Kleiner E.L. Bird A.P. Cell. 1989; 58: 499-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) and bind in vitro to DNA containing at least 12 symmetrically methylated CpGs, whereas MeCP2 could bind to a single methylated CpG. Because the mDOR promoter sequence has multiple CpGs that were found to be completely methylated in genomic DNA from Neuro2A cells in which the gene is repressed, we turned our attention toward MeCP1 as a possible mediator of transcriptional repression. End-labeled methylated CG11 probe (Me-CG11), which is known to bind to MeCP1 in vitro (15Meehan R.R. Lewis J.D. McKay S. Kleiner E.L. Bird A.P. Cell. 1989; 58: 499-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), was incubated with nuclear extracts from Neuro2A cells and then subjected to EMSA. On autoradiography, an MeCP1 complex with doublet DNA-protein bands was observed with Me-CG11 (Fig. 5A), suggesting that nuclear extracts from Neuro2A contain MeCP1 complex. The formation of MeCP1 complex in Neuro2A nuclear extracts was competed more effectively by Me-CG11 itself than by methylated mDOR promoter fragment (Me-262/141) but was not competed by a 100-fold molar excess of cold, unmethylated CG11 or 200-fold molar excess of cold, unmethylated mDOR promoter fragment (262/141). These data suggest that the binding of the MeCP1 complex depends not only on the DNA sequence but also on the methylation status of that sequence. Because Me-262/141 effectively competed for MeCP1 complex binding by Me-CG11, it raises the possibility that it may directly form a complex with MeCP1. End-labeled Me-262/141 probes were used in an EMSA with Neuro2A nuclear extracts. A similar complex was observed with Me-262/141 (Fig. 5B), and this complex was competed effectively by cold Me-262/141 but not by unmethylated 262/141. In addition, this complex was effectively competed by Me-CG11, but not by unmethylated CG11. These results indicate that methylated mDOR promoter region DNA sequence Me-262/141 can form a protein complex that is similar, but not identical, to the MeCP1 formed by Me-CG11 after incubation with Neuro2A nuclear extracts. MeCP1 has been shown to contain MBD2 as a major DNA binding component to mediate the methylation-induced repression (18Ng H.H. Zhang Y. Hendrich B. Johnson C.A. Turner B.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). We further determined whether the complex formed by Me-262/141 also contains MBD2. As shown in Fig. 6A, incubation with an anti-MBD2 antibody blocked the complex formation. These data further suggest that protein complex formed by Me-262/141 is MeCP1-like. Involvement of Sp3 in the MeCP1-like Complex Formed by Me-262/141—Modification of DNA by methylation has been proposed to interfere with transcription directly by modifying the binding sites of transcription factors so that they can no longer bind their cognate sequences (19Watt F. Molloy P.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1136-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Several transcription factors have been shown to bind to the mDOR promoter region and play a critical role in the regulation of mDOR promoter activity (Fig. 2A) (5Liu H.C. Shen J.T. Augustin L.B. Ko J.L. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23617-23626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 6Sun P. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45462-45469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Among these transcription factors, Sp1/Sp3 accounts for about 70% of the promoter activity in a transient transfection assay (5Liu H.C. Shen J.T. Augustin L.B. Ko J.L. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23617-23626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To determine whether methylation can block Sp1/Sp3 binding to mDOR promoter region, we incubated the end-labeled Me-262/141 with antibodies against Sp1 and Sp3. To our surprise, we found that the anti-Sp3 antibody, but not anti-Sp1 antibody, could ablate the MeCP1-like complex formation (Fig. 6B), indicating that Sp3 can still bind to the methylated mDOR promoter and may be involved in MeCP1-like complex formation in Neuro2A cells. A Role for Sp3 in Transcriptional Repression of Methylated mDOR Gene Promoter Activity—The finding that Sp3 was involved in MeCP1-like complex formation in the gel shift experiments (Fig. 6B) prompted us to examine the Sp3 expression level in Neuro2A cells, with and without AdC treatment. We found all three isoforms of Sp3 were down-regulated after AdC treatment, and the levels of Sp3 proteins correlated with the levels of mDOR mRNA (Fig. 7A). Following these results, we hypothesized that Sp3 may act to repress mDOR transcription by competing with Sp1 binding to the methylated mDOR promoter. To examine this hypothesis, we transfected Sp3 and Sp1 cDNA with methylated promoter constructs into SL2 cells, a Drosophila cell line without endogenous Sp proteins. Transfections into SL2 cells have been used to analyze activation or repression properties of mammalian transcription factors (20Schneider I. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1972; 27: 353-365PubMed Google Scholar, 21Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). SL2 cells are particularly suited to this task because they are devoid of many ubiquitous mammalian transcription factor activities, and thus their transcriptional properties can be investigated in the absence of interference by endogenous factors. As shown in Fig. 7B, Sp1 alone could activate both the methylated and unmethylated pD262 luciferase constructs to a similar extent. Interestingly, increasing Sp3 levels inhibited the Sp1-mediated pD262 promoter activity when the pD262 luciferase construct was methylated, whereas the promoter activity increased when the pD262 luciferase construct was unmethylated. These results further suggest that Sp3 is involved in the methylation-mediated repression of mDOR promoter activity, while also confirming its role with Sp1 in the activation of the unmethylated promoter. The mDOR gene promoter resembles promoters for the socalled housekeeping genes, characterized by a (G + C)-rich region, multiple GC boxes, and a lack of TATA or CCAAT sequences. In view of this, the fact that the mDOR gene is expressed in a tissue- and cell type-specific manner is rather surprising, because the housekeeping genes are usually ubiquitously expressed. Previous studies demonstrated that the mDOR promoter region from -262 to -141 containing Sp1/ Sp3, upstream stimulatory factor, and Ets-1-binding sites is critical for its basal promoter activity (5Liu H.C. Shen J.T. Augustin L.B. Ko J.L. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23617-23626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 6Sun P. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45462-45469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Given that these transcriptional factors are also ubiquitously expressed, the mechanisms involved in the regulation of cell type-specific expression of mDOR are not clear. We undertook the present study to determine whether methylation provides a molecular mechanism by which the mDOR gene is silenced in certain cells. In general, hypermethylation of normally unmethylated CpG islands correlates with transcriptional repression, leading to inactivation of gene expression. Here we provide evidence that mDOR expression is repressed by promoter region DNA methylation in Neuro2A cells. An inverse correlation between promoter region methylation and mDOR gene expression levels was observed in two types of neuronal cell lines, NS20Y and Neuro2A. In vitro methylation of the CpGs in the core promoter region of mDOR gene reduced the promoter activity in a transient transfection assay (Fig. 3). Furthermore, demethylation with AdC increased the mDOR mRNA level in Neuro2A cells (Fig. 4). These results satisfy two well known criteria for a role for DNA methylation in cell type-specific gene repression: (i) the promoter of mDOR is densely methylated in low-expressing cells, and (ii) induced demethylation results in activation of mDOR. It is noticed that the elevated mDOR mRNA level in AdC-treated Neuro2A cells is not as high as that in the high expressing NS20Y cells. This would indicate that demethylation alone is not sufficient to release repression of mDOR in Neuro2A cells. Our subsequent observation of Sp3 being involved in the repression is consistent with this notion. We conclude that the transcriptional repression of mDOR gene is possibly mediated by multiple factors in Neuro2A cells, and promoter region CpG methylation is one of them. The connection between the methylation status of gene promoters and the transcriptional activity of the respective genes has been established (9Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms have been proposed for the methylation-induced gene repression. Among these, direct binding of methylation-specific repressors appears to be a major mechanism of transcriptional repression (22Ballestar E. Wolffe A.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). A conserved family of ubiquitously expressed proteins that selectively bind methylated CpGs has been identified (23Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). They bind methylated CpG sites with little apparent specificity for flanking nucleotide sequences. MeCP1 was the first one to be identified as a nuclear factor that could discriminate between methylated and unmethylated DNA (15Meehan R.R. Lewis J.D. McKay S. Kleiner E.L. Bird A.P. Cell. 1989; 58: 499-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) and repress transcription through preferential binding, remodeling, and deacetylating methylated nucleosomes (24Feng Q. Zhang Y. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 827-832PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that a similar methylated DNA binding complex forms efficiently with the methylated mDOR promoter sequence by using nuclear extracts from Neuro2A cells. Furthermore, blocking of MBD2 with anti-MBD2 antibody nearly abolished the formation of MeCP1-like complex (Fig. 6A). Our results confirm the previous report showing MBD2 as a component of the MeCP1 or related complexes, and support the notion that MBD2 is responsible for the methyl-CpG-binding activity of the MeCP1. Full characterization of these large protein complexes is needed to determine whether the complex formed between the methylated mDOR promoter and Neuro2A nuclear extracts is identical to MeCP1. In addition, whether this MeCP1-like complex blocks transcription in this system will require further investigation. Alternatively, it is possible that methylation of the mDOR gene promoter directly interferes with the binding of one or more specific transcriptional activating factors that have CpGs in their DNA recognition sites. Methylation of specific binding sites for certain transcription factors, e.g. c-Myc, can block their binding to these sites in vitro (19Watt F. Molloy P.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1136-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 25Tate P.H. Bird A.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1993; 3: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the general transcriptional factor Sp1 binds equally well to methylated and non-methylated sites (26Harrington M.A. Jones P.A. Imagawa M. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2066-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and stimulates transcription from both methylated and non-methylated templates (27Holler M. Westin G. Jiricny J. Schaffner W. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). These are consistent with our cotransfection study using Drosophila SL2 cells, which do not have endogenous Sp proteins. As shown in Fig. 7B, Sp1 alone could activate both the methylated and unmethylated mDOR luciferase constructs in a similar extent. However, when Sp1 cotransfected with Sp3, increasing Sp3 levels inhibited the Sp1-mediated promoter activity of methylated pD262 construct. Furthermore, our EMSA study also showed the CpG methylation blocked the binding of Sp1, but the binding of Sp3 to methylated promoter fragment was not affected (Fig. 6). This is surprising, because Sp1 and Sp3 share similar domain structures with three zinc fingers and bind specifically to the same GC-rich elements such as the GC box (GGGGCGGGG) (28Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). Our previous data also demonstrated that Sp1 and Sp3 could bind to the same nonmethylated DNA sequence from mDOR promoter region (5Liu H.C. Shen J.T. Augustin L.B. Ko J.L. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23617-23626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). One possible explanation is that Sp3 has a higher binding affinity to the methylated mDOR promoter than Sp1. Because Sp1 and Sp3 compete for the same binding site within mDOR promoter region, increased binding affinity of Sp3 to the methylated mDOR promoter could then hinder the binding of Sp1 to the same methylated DNA sequence. How Sp3 has a higher affinity to methylated mDOR sequence than Sp1 is not known. In our current study, because Sp3 and MBD2 coexisted in the same MeCP1-like complex, and blocking of either Sp3 or MBD2 with antibody nearly abolished the complex formation (Fig. 6), we speculate that Sp3 may interact with certain methylation-specific binding proteins like MBD2 to stabilize its binding to the methylated DNA sequence. The exact mechanism requires further investigation. Several members of the Sp family, including Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4, are generally known as activators of gene transcription, whereas Sp3 is also considered to be a repressor of gene transcription (28Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Sp3 represses gene expression via the titration of the Sp1/Sp3 ratio (29Kumar A.P. Butler A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2012-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 30Kennett S.B. Moorefield K.S. Horowitz J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9780-9789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 31Ghayor C. Chadjichristos C. Herrouin J.F. Ala-Kokko L. Suske G. Pujol J.P. Galera P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36881-36895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the present study, cotransfection of Sp3 with methylated mDOR promoter constructs could repress the Sp1-mediated promoter activation in SL2 cells (Fig. 7B). Our results support the idea that increased binding affinity of Sp3 to the methylated DNA sequences results in the change of Sp1/Sp3 ratio bound to the mDOR promoter region, leading to the repression of Sp1-mediated activation. On the contrary, cotransfection of Sp3 with unmethylated mDOR constructs increased the promoter activity. These suggest that methylation of DNA is required for repression by Sp3. Different functions of Sp3 on the methylated and unmethylated mDOR may also come from the interactions between Sp3 and some methylation-related transcription factors such as MBDs and HDACs. It has been shown that Sp3 can recruit HDAC (32Won J. Yim J. Kim T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38230-38238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), which can then modify the regional chromatin structure of a gene and repress gene expression. Whether the Sp1/Sp3 ratio or the interaction between Sp3 and MBD/HDAC is involved in the Sp3-mediated repression of mDOR remains to be determined. Because the known MBD proteins bind methylated DNA with little sequence specificity, the mechanisms involved in the recruitment of these proteins to particular regions in the genome are unknown (22Ballestar E. Wolffe A.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Our current study demonstrated the first time that the sequence-specific transcription factor Sp3 is involved in the formation of methylation-specific protein complex MeCP1 in Neuro2A cells. It may interact with the methyl-CpG-binding proteins and direct them to certain genes with sequence selectivity and methylation sensitivity. In summary, our experiments demonstrate that mDOR gene expression is repressed by CpG methylation in Neuro2A cells. Sp3/MBD2 binding to the mDOR promoter region might be involved in transcriptional repression of the methylated gene in Neuro2A cells and play a role in the regulation of cell type-specific expression of mDOR.

Since data also point to an effect of GM-CSF on the vascular ECM in general, the vascular collagenous matrix was studied in wild-type and GM-CSF-deficient mice. Histological examination revealed a disorganized vascular ECM in GM-CSF-deficient mice involving the collagenous matrix and elastic fiber system. As shown by electron microscopy, collagen bundles were disrupted and reduced. The diameter of fibrils varied widely. mRNA expression of collagens and related molecules was studied. Fibrillar collagens were markedly reduced, alpha1(I)procollagen to 16.5% of control levels alpha1(III)procollagen was abolished whereas the expression level of network-forming alpha1(VIII)procollagen was not altered. As shown by in situ hybridization, the number of collagen-expressing cells was reduced. Matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitor 1 were not affected by GM-CSF deficiency. Our studies demonstrate that GM-CSF plays a major role in the cytokine network regulating the metabolism of vascular collagens. GM-CSF deficiency leads to an altered composition of the vascular collagenous matrix, i.e., reduced amount of fibrillar collagen, altered ratio of fibrillar and network-forming collagen, and failures in the fibrillogenesis. We suggest that GM-CSF is a basic requirement for the maintenance of vessel wall integrity and resilience."
https://openalex.org/W2009649686,"The PIS1 gene is required for de novo synthesis of phosphatidylinositol (PI), an essential phospholipid in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. PIS1 gene expression is unusual because it is uncoupled from the other phospholipid biosynthetic genes, which are regulated in response to inositol and choline. Relatively little is known about regulation of transcription of the PIS1 gene. We reported previously that PIS1 transcription is sensitive to carbon source. To further our understanding of the regulation of PIS1 transcription, we carried out a promoter deletion analysis that identified three regions required for PIS1 gene expression (upstream activating sequence (UAS) elements 1-3). Deletion of either UAS1 or UAS2 resulted in an ∼45% reduction in expression, whereas removal of UAS3 yielded an 84% decrease in expression. A comparison of promoters among several Saccharomyces species shows that these sequences are highly conserved. Curiously, the UAS3 element region (-149 to -138) includes a Rox1p binding site. Rox1p is a repressor of hypoxic genes under aerobic growth conditions. Consistent with this, we have found that expression of a PIS1-cat reporter was repressed under aerobic conditions, and this repression was dependent on both Rox1p and its binding site. Furthermore, PI levels were elevated under anaerobic conditions. This is the first evidence that PI levels are affected by regulation of PIS1 transcription.

Furthermore, PI levels were elevated under anaerobic conditions. This is the first evidence that PI levels are affected by regulation of PIS1 transcription. Phospholipids are essential for cell structure, and their synthesis is a strongly conserved process in all eukaryotes (1Carman G.M. Zeimetz G.M. J. Biol.

In addition to its structural role, PI and its derivatives play major roles in a variety of cellular processes including glycolipid anchoring of proteins (8Shields D. Arvan P. Curr. Opin.

Cell. 2000; 100: 603-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Despite its importance, relatively little is known about how regulation of transcription affects PI synthesis. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the PIS1 gene encodes the membrane-associated PI synthase, which combines CDP-diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol to synthesize PI (7Nikawa J.-I. Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4876-4881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 304-311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The yeast PIS1 locus was originally defined by a mutant, pis, that required high levels of inositol (100 μm) for growth because of a decreased affinity of PI synthase for inositol (18Kumano Y. Nikawa J.-I. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 126: 81-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nikawa J.-I. Yamashita S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 125: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This mutant phenotype was utilized to clone the yeast PIS1 gene (19Nikawa J.-I. Yamashita S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 125: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), as well as the rat (20Tanaka S. Nikawa J.-I. Imai H. Yamashita S. Hosaka K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and Arabidopsis (21Xue H.W. Kosaka K. Plesch G. Mueller-Roeber B. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 42: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) homologues. The PIS1 gene has been identified in many organisms, including Toxoplasma gondii (22Seron K. Dzierszinski F. Tomavo S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6571-6579Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), rat (20Tanaka S. Nikawa J.-I. Imai H. Yamashita S. Hosaka K.

Chem. 1997; 272: 33402-33409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). PI synthase activity has also been characterized in Candida albicans (24Antonsson B.E. Klig L.S. Yeast. 1996; 12: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and several additional mammalian species (5Antonsson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Disruption of the yeast PIS1 gene is lethal (7Nikawa J.-I. Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4876-4881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrating that PI synthesis is an essential process. Yeast cells do not extensively regulate PIS1 expression or its product (25Anderson M.S. Lopes J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26596-26601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 26Fischl A.S. Homann M.J. Poole M.A. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3178-3183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, PIS1 gene expression is not co-regulated with the expression of other phospholipid biosynthetic genes in response to inositol and choline (1Carman G.M. Zeimetz G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13293-13296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 2Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Prog.

Chem. 1996; 271: 26596-26601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, PIS1 gene expression is regulated in response to different carbon sources where PIS1 expression is elevated in fermentable carbon sources (galactose and glucose) relative to nonfermentable carbon sources (glycerol) (25Anderson M.S. Lopes J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26596-26601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although PIS1 gene expression is uncoupled from the inositol choline response, PI synthase activity is affected by inositol levels. Increased levels of inositol have been shown to increase the rate of PI synthesis (27Kelley M.J. Bailis A.M. Henry S.A. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18078-18085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The K m of PI synthase for inositol (0.21 mm) is 9-fold greater than the intracellular concentration of inositol (24 μm). Additionally, inositol is a noncompetitive inhibitor of phosphatidylserine (PS) synthase (CHO1 gene product), the first enzyme in the phosphatidylcholine (PC) biosynthetic branch (Fig. 1). Therefore, when cells are supplemented with inositol, the amount of PI in cell membranes doubles at the expense of PC synthesis (27Kelley M.J. Bailis A.M. Henry S.A. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18078-18085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hypoxic regulation of gene expression has been studied extensively in many eukaryotes including yeast, Drosophila, and mammals (28Kastaniotis A.J. Zitomer R.S. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 475: 185-195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Lavista-Llanos S. Centanin L. Irisarri M. Russo D.M. Gleadle J.M. Bocca S.N. Muzzopappa M. Ratcliffe P.J. Wappner P. Mol. Cell.

In yeast, the mechanism for regulation has been shown to be predominantly controlled by Rox1p (28Kastaniotis A.J. Zitomer R.S. Adv. Exp. Med.

Biol. 2000; 20: 7088-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In aerobic environments, ROX1 transcription is induced by a Hap1p heme complex. Rox1p then recruits the Ssn6-Tup1 repression complex and represses transcription of anaerobic (hypoxic) genes such as ANB1 (36Zhang L. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2110-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In anaerobic environments, intracellular heme synthesis decreases and, as a result, Hap1p complexes with additional proteins to repress transcription of ROX1 (37Zhang L. Guarente L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 269: 14643-14647Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 38Fytlovich S. Gervais M. Agrimonti C. Guiard B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1209-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Rox1p levels decrease, and anaerobic (hypoxic) genes are derepressed. More recently, the MOT3 and MOX genes have been shown to be regulators of the hypoxic response (31Balasubramaniam B. Lowry C.V. Zitomer R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6071-6078Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 39Abramova N.E. Cohen B.D. Sertil O. Kapoor R. Davies K.J.A. Lowry C.V.

PIS1 expression is induced 2-fold under anaerobic conditions and in a rox1Δ mutant strain grown in chemostat or batch cultures (41Ter Linde J.J.M. Liang H. Davis R.W. De Steensma H.Y. Van Dijken J.P.

In this study, we identified three upstream activating sequence (UAS) elements in the PIS1 promoter and found that within the UAS3 element is a binding site of Rox1p. We also show that PIS1 gene expression is induced in anaerobic conditions through the Rox1p binding site. Anaerobic growth conditions were also found to influence phospholipid composition. Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions—The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study were BRS1001 (MAT a ade2-1 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 can1-100 ura3-1 trp1-1), FY23 (MAT a ura3-52 trp1Δ63 leu2Δ1) (44Winston F. Dollard C. Ricupero-Hovasse S.L. Yeast. 1995; 11: 53-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar), and FY23Δrox1 (MAT a ura3-52 trp1Δ63 leu2Δ1 rox1::LEU2) (45Lowry C.V. Zitomer R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4651-4658Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Yeast cultures were grown at 30 °C in synthetic medium (46Kelly B.L. Greenberg M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1046: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) containing 2% glucose (w/v), 75 μm inositol, and 1 mm choline. Where appropriate, glycerol (3% v/v) was substituted for glucose. Anaerobic cultures were grown at 30 °C in the glucose synthetic media containing 75 μm inositol and 1 mm choline using BBL Gas Paks and an anaerobic growth chamber, as described previously (47Lowry C.V. Zitomer R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6129-6133Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Plasmid Construction—A nested set of PIS1 promoter deletions fused to the cat reporter gene was created by PCR using appropriate oligonucleotides (Table I). The 5′-terminal deletion PCRs utilized the 3′ primer: PIS1-3′ -1 along with the 5′ primer series PIS1 -918 to -127 (Table I). The individual PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI). PIS1 promoter fragments were excised from pGEM-T by digestion with BamHI and BglII and inserted into pBM2015 (48Griggs D.W. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4999-5009Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Fragments from appropriate pGEM-T derivatives were combined into pBM2015 to create PIS1 promoter internal deletions. For each plasmid, the name indicates the deletion endpoints. A PIS1-cat derivative containing a mutant Rox1p binding site was created by site-directed mutagenesis of pPIS1 -325 (to create pPIS1 -325roxΔ) using a QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX) and primers PIS1sd -162 and -120. Specifically, the Rox1p binding site (PIS1 promoter sequences -149 to -132) was changed from 5′-GCCCCTCCTATTGTTTTT-3′ to 5′-GCCCCTCCTCGCGTTTTT-3′. The presence of the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. An ANB1 promoter cat reporter gene fusion was created by PCR using primers ANB1 -1000 and -1. Yeast strains containing the promoter-cat reporters stably integrated at the GAL4 locus were created by transformation, as described previously (49Ashburner B.P. Lopes J.M. Mol. Cell.

This pGEM-T derivative was constructed by cloning 150 bp of the ANB1 promoter -321 to -171 amplified by using primers ANB1 -321 and -171. Plasmid pPIS1-bend was generated for use in a circular permutation assay. This plasmid was constructed by cloning a tandem direct repeat of PIS1 promoter sequences from -247 to -39 using primers PIS1 -247 and -39. Plasmid pGEX-KG-ROX1 was created for the purpose of over-expressing and purifying Rox1p. The ROX1 ORF was amplified by PCR using the ROX1 ORF 5′ and 3′ primers. Plasmid pGEX-KG (Amersham Biosciences) was linearized with BamHI and EcoRI, and a 1101-bp ROX1 fragment was cloned in-frame with glutathione S-transferase (GST). CAT Assays—Five-milliliter cultures were grown to 60-80 Klett units in appropriate media. Assays were conducted as described previously (49Ashburner B.P. Lopes J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1709-1715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Units of CAT activity were defined as counts/min measured in the organic phase and expressed as a percentage of the total counts/min (percent conversion) divided by the amount of protein assayed (in micrograms) and the time of incubation (in hours). RNA Ligase-mediated Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RLM-RACE)—The 5′ end of the PIS1 transcript was mapped using the FirstChoice RLM-RACE kit (Ambion). RNA was isolated from yeast by a glass bead disruption and hot phenol extraction procedure (50Elion E.A. Warner J.R. Cell. 1984; 39: 663-673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Total RNA was treated with calf intestinal phosphatase to remove the 5′-phosphate from non-full-length uncapped RNA. The 5′ cap was removed from full-length mRNA by treatment with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP), leaving a 5′-monophosphate to which a 5′ RACE adapter oligonucleotide (5′-GCUGAUGGCGAUGAAUGAACACUGCGUUUGCUGGCUUUGAUGAA-3′) was ligated using T4 RNA ligase. Random-primed reverse transcription and nested PCR were then used to amplify the 5′ transcript. The outer PCR reaction used the 5′ RACE outer primers, whereas the inner PCR reaction used the 5′ RACE inner primers (Table I). The 5′ RACE inner PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T (Promega) and sequenced. EMSA—Full-length GST-Rox1p was induced from plasmid pGEXKG-ROX1 with 0.3 m isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 22 °C in BL21 (DE 3) pLysS cells. Cells were lysed by a freeze-thaw procedure, and GST-Rox1p was purified by using 50% glutathione-agarose beads (w/v) (Sigma). GST-Rox1 fusion protein was solubilized with 20% Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1%. A 1-ml bed volume of 50% glutathione-agarose per 100 ml of sonicate was incubated with cell lysate at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation, the supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline. GST-Rox1p was eluted from the beads with glutathione elution buffer (10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) at 22 °C, and protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). EMSA experiments were performed with BamHI-BglII restriction fragments excised from pANB1, pPIS1 -325, and pPIS1 -325roxΔ, as described previously (32Deckert J. Torres A.M.R. Simon J.T. Zitomer R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6109-6117Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Fragments for the circular permutation assay were excised from pPIS1-bend using the restriction enzymes listed in the legend to Fig. 7. Restriction fragments were end-labeled by means of an exchange reaction using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega), as described previously (51Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 10.6.6-10.6.7Google Scholar). Protein-DNA complexes were visualized by using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Lipid Analysis by One-dimensional Thin Layer Chromatography— Steady-state levels of phospholipids were quantified after growing BRS1001 and FY23 at 30 °C in either aerobic or anaerobic conditions with agitation (47Lowry C.V. Zitomer R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Spheroplasts were suspended in chloroform:methanol (2:1) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with agitation. Lipids were extracted after adding 0.2 volumes of H2O. Lipids were separated on a Whatman LK5D silica gel 150 å × 20- × 20-cm plate pre-treated with 2.3% boric acid (in ethanol). Phospholipids were separated in a single dimension using chloroform: ethanol:H2O:triethylamine (30:35:7:35), as described previously (53Leray C. Pelletier X. Hemmendinger S. Cazenave J.-P. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 420: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Phospholipids were visualized with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified using Imagequant software (Amersham Biosciences). Deletion Analysis of the PIS1 Promoter Identifies Three UAS Elements—UAS and upstream regulatory sequences are regulatory elements found within the promoters of yeast genes. A nested set of PIS1 promoter deletions fused to the cat reporter gene was used to delineate region(s) of the PIS1 promoter that are required for gene expression. This deletion analysis identified three UAS elements that are required for PIS1 promoter activity. Removal of sequences upstream of -225 did not affect expression of the cat reporter. However, removal of promoter sequences from -224 to -206 reduced CAT activity by 45% (compare pPIS1 -224 with -205 in Fig. 2). This suggests that a UAS element (designated UAS1) is present between sequences -224 to -205. An internal deletion removing sequences from -184 to -149 also reduced CAT activity by 44% (compare pPIS1 -325 to pPIS1 -325 to -185/-149 in Fig. 2). We have designated this as UAS2. This region has been shown previously to bind Mcm1p (54Kuo M.-H. Grayhack E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 348-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Removal of both UAS1 and UAS2 sequences resulted in a 94% reduction in CAT activity, suggesting that these elements function independently (compare pPIS1 -325 to -149 in Fig. 2). Another internal deletion that removed sequences -149 to -127 also reduced CAT activity by 84% (compare pPIS1 -325 to pPIS1 -325 to -149/-127 in Fig. 2), suggesting the presence of a third UAS element (designated UAS3). When all three UAS elements were deleted (pPIS1 -127 in Fig. 2), CAT activity was completely eliminated, suggesting that all three UAS elements are required for PIS1 gene expression. To aid in the interpretation of the PIS1 promoter deletion studies, the PIS1 transcription initiation site was mapped using 5′ RLM-RACE (Ambion). This technique was chosen over more traditional 5′ RACE protocols because it offers the advantage of specificity for full-length capped transcripts. Total RNA was treated with calf intestinal phosphatase to remove the 5′-phosphate from non-full-length uncapped RNA (degraded mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA). The 5′ cap was then removed from full-length mRNA by treatment with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP), leaving a 5′-monophosphate to which a 5′ RACE adapter oligonucleotide was ligated using T4 RNA ligase. As a control, a sample of RNA was not treated with TAP. The presence of the 5′ cap would prevent the ligation of the 5′ RACE adapter, thereby preventing amplification in subsequent steps. Random-primed reverse transcription was used to generate cDNA. A nested set of primers (outer and inner) specific to the 5′ adapter and an internal site on the PIS1 transcript were used to amplify sequentially the 5′ end of the transcript. Amplification with the outer primers typically does not yield a specific PCR product (Fig. 3, 1°PCR). However, secondary amplification with the inner primers generated a product in reactions treated with TAP. (Fig. 3, 2°PCR, lane E). As expected, the control reaction carried out on RNA not treated with TAP did not generate a PCR product (Fig. 3, 2°PCR, lane C). The PCR products from the 2°PCR reaction were ligated into pGEM-T. Sixteen subclones were obtained, and restriction digestion revealed three different sizes of inserts. All 16 subclones were sequenced and identified three start sites in the PIS1 promoter sequence at -38 (9 subclones), -34 (2 subclones), and -25 (5 subclones) (Fig. 3). To further elucidate the regulatory sequences defined by the PIS1-cat deletion analyses, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Promoter Database was used to search for potential protein binding sites present in the PIS1 regulatory elements. The UAS1 element (-224 to -205) contains potential Ste12p and Pho2p sites, the UAS2 element (-184 to -149) contains a potential Pho2p binding site in addition to two Mcm1p binding sites, and UAS3 (-149 to -127) contains potential Rox1p and Gcr1p sites. The PIS1 promoter sequence from S. cerevisiae was also compared with that of other closely related Saccharomyces species. 2P. Cliften, M. Johnston, and the Washington University Genome Sequencing Center, personal communication. The degree of sequence similarity between these species is in the following order: S. cerevisiae > Saccharomyces mikatae > Saccharomyces kudriavzevii > Saccharomyces bayanus > Saccharomyces castellii > Saccharomyces kluveryi (55Barnett J.A. Yeast. 1992; 8: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These comparisons revealed highly conserved regions in the UAS2 and UAS3 elements, particularly i"
https://openalex.org/W1967264484,"Transcriptional repression by nuclear receptor corepressors plays a critical role in T cell development. However, the role of these corepressors in T cell activation is poorly understood. We report that T cell activation silenced transcription driven by nuclear receptors retinoic acid receptor, retinoid X receptor, and thyroid hormone receptor and induced silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT)-receptor interaction. Whereas the expression of a dominant active mutant of protein kinase C theta(PKC theta) induced strong SMRT-receptor interaction in the absence of T cell activation, a dominant negative mutant of PKC theta decreased the interaction. Loss of PKC theta expression by induction of RNA interference resulted in the attenuation of basal and activation-induced SMRT-receptor interaction. We suggest that T cell activation silences nuclear receptor-dependent transactivation in part through PKC theta-dependent enhancement of SMRT-receptor interaction."
