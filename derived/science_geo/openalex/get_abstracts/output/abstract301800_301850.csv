https://openalex.org/W1981540621,Spectral measurements of ultraviolet-B radiation made at Toronto since 1989 indicate that the intensity of light at wavelengths near 300 nanometers has increased by 35 percent per year in winter and 7 percent per year in summer. The wavelength dependence of these trends indicates that the increase is caused by the downward trend in total ozone that was measured at Toronto during the same period. The trend at wavelengths between 320 and 325 nanometers is essentially zero.
https://openalex.org/W2016744378,Experimental evidence (obtained by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis) is presented which shows that finely divided carbon (soot) particles may play a major role in the catalytic oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfate in polluted atmospheres. The results obtained with sulfates produced in the laboratory by the oxidation of sulfur dioxide on graphite particles and combustion-produced soot particles are compared with the properties and behavior of ambient sulfates. The proposed sulfur dioxide oxidation mechanism is qualitatively consistent with field observations.
https://openalex.org/W2076086044,"The electrodynamic interaction between lo and the Jovian magnetosphere drives currents to and from the planet's ionosphere, where H(3)(+) emission is excited. Direct images of this phenomenon were obtained with the ProtoCAM infrared camera at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's 3-m Infrared Telescope Facility. The emissions are localized to the instantaneous foot of the lo flux tube, approximately 8 degrees equatorward of the more intense auroral H(3)(+) emission associated with higher magnetic latitudes. The foot of the lo flux tube leads that of (undisturbed) model magnetic field lines passing through lo by 15 degrees to 20 degrees in longitude and is less visible in the northern hemisphere at longitudes where the surface magnetic field strength is greatest. These data favor the unipolar inductor model of the lo interaction and provide insight into the source location and generation of Jovian decameter radio emission."

https://openalex.org/W1964311884,A method has been developed for performing fast time-resolved experiments with a scanning tunneling microscope. The method uses the intrinsic nonlinearity in the microscope's current versus voltage characteristics to resolve optically generated transient signals on picosecond time scales. The ability to combine the spatial resolution of tunneling microscopy with the time resolution of ultrafast optics yields a powerful tool for the investigation of dynamic phenomena on the atomic scale.
https://openalex.org/W2089109864,"The concentrations of ozone at nine measurements sites in New Jersey and New York during the period 1 May through 30 September 1973 have been examined. Daily fluctuations in the ozone concentrations at any two sites are highly correlated. The concentrations are lower with low levels of solar radiation and also with high wind speed. The average ozone concentration shows only minor differences between weekdays and weekends, despite markedly different traffic patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2030098111,"Alkanes at the air-sea interface were analyzed in 118 surface samples collected at five different intervals over a 12-month period from Timbalier Bay (Louisiana), ogfshore Louiisiana, and offshore Florida. The alkanes were characterized by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Unexpectedly, methyl branched alkanes ranging in chain length froin C(15) to C(35) and cycloalkanes were frequently the predominant components. This suggests that the alkanes are produced by natural biological sources as well as human activities."
https://openalex.org/W2121219063,Arecibo Observatory's giant spherical reflector antenna has undergone a massive upgrading over the past 3 years. The surface of the reflector has been replaced with aluminum panels to obtain an accuracy of 3.2 mm r.m.s. over the reflector surface. The superstructure has been stabilized and modified to permit operation at S-band frequencies. A high-power S-band radar transmitter has been added to the existing UHF system. These additions and improvements provide the observatory with new and promising research capabilities in the fields of radio and radar astronomy.

https://openalex.org/W2063619387,"Some of the early results reported by several investigators in the solar physics discipline are described, as well as a subjective response to long-term zero-gravity exposure in several areas related to medical studies. Many of the roles in which man has participated in research aboard Skylab will again be important in future space activities such as the Space Shuttle. Examples are pointing, alignment, transient identification and response, and assurance of data quality. These tasks can be extended to include a greater role in data management and interpretation, so that some selectivity or processing, or both, might be appropriate onboard the spacecraft, prior to transmission of data to the ground."

https://openalex.org/W2052013917,"At the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America in Boston during late October, Earth's crust came in for close scrutiny. One surprise was its age: Chemical and isotopic evidence suggested the crust formed soon after the planet did. Participants also discussed features of today's crust, including a horizontal slice beneath San Francisco and the possibility that a particular kind of crustal stretching, long envisioned, may not actually take place."
