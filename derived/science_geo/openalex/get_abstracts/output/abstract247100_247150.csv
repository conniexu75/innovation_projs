Although many candidate systems exist, only phosphatidylserine has been identified as a general recognition ligand on apoptotic cells. We demonstrate here that calreticulin acts as a second general recognition ligand by binding and activating LDL-receptor-related protein (LRP) on the engulfing cell. Since surface calreticulin is also found on viable cells, a mechanism preventing inadvertent uptake was sought. Disruption of interactions between CD47 (integrin-associated protein) on the target cell and SIRPalpha (SHPS-1), a heavily glycosylated transmembrane protein on the engulfing cell, permitted uptake of viable cells in a calreticulin/LRP-dependent manner. On apoptotic cells, CD47 was altered and/or lost and no longer activated SIRPalpha. These changes on the apoptotic cell create an environment where ""don't eat me"" signals are rendered inactive and ""eat me"" signals, including calreticulin and phosphatidylserine, congregate together and signal for removal."

Previously, we used live-cell imaging of six budding-yeast proteins to define a pathway for association of receptors, adaptors, and actin during endocytic internalization. Here, we analyzed the effects of 61 deletion mutants on the dynamics of this pathway, revealing functions for 15 proteins, and we analyzed the dynamics of 8 of these proteins. Our studies provide evidence for four protein modules that cooperate to drive coat formation, membrane invagination, actin-meshwork assembly, and vesicle scission during clathrin/actin-mediated endocytosis. We found that clathrin facilitates the initiation of endocytic-site assembly but is not needed for membrane invagination or vesicle formation. Finally, we present evidence that the actin-meshwork assembly that drives membrane invagination is nucleated proximally to the plasma membrane, opposite to the orientation observed for previously studied actin-assembly-driven motility processes."
https://openalex.org/W2122289183,"Multiple mechanisms have evolved to regulate the eukaryotic genome. We have identified CTN-RNA, a mouse tissue-specific approximately 8 kb nuclear-retained poly(A)+ RNA that regulates the level of its protein-coding partner. CTN-RNA is transcribed from the protein-coding mouse cationic amino acid transporter 2 (mCAT2) gene through alternative promoter and poly(A) site usage. CTN-RNA is diffusely distributed in nuclei and is also localized to paraspeckles. The 3'UTR of CTN-RNA contains elements for adenosine-to-inosine editing, involved in its nuclear retention. Interestingly, knockdown of CTN-RNA also downregulates mCAT2 mRNA. Under stress, CTN-RNA is posttranscriptionally cleaved to produce protein-coding mCAT2 mRNA. Our findings reveal a role of the cell nucleus in harboring RNA molecules that are not immediately needed to produce proteins but whose cytoplasmic presence is rapidly required upon physiologic stress. This mechanism of action highlights an important paradigm for the role of a nuclear-retained stable RNA transcript in regulating gene expression."

We show that H2A.Z nucleosomes are found at promoter regions of nearly all genes in euchromatin. They generally occur as two positioned nucleosomes that flank a nucleosome-free region (NFR) that contains the transcription start site. Astonishingly, enrichment at 5′ ends is observed not only at actively transcribed genes but also at inactive loci. Mutagenesis of a typical promoter revealed a 22 bp segment of DNA sufficient to program formation of a NFR flanked by two H2A.Z nucleosomes. This segment contains a binding site of the Myb-related protein Reb1 and an adjacent dT:dA tract. Efficient deposition of H2A.Z is further promoted by a specific pattern of histone H3 and H4 tail acetylation and the bromodomain protein Bdf1, a component of the Swr1 remodeling complex that deposits H2A.Z.

The association of eukaryotic DNA with histone octamers to form nucleosomes has profound implications for all aspects of DNA metabolism. Epigenetic control mediated through chromatin is now recognized as a major form of genetic regulation that functions during both normal development and pathogenic processes such as tumorigenesis. Therefore, a critical challenge faced by dividing eukaryotic cells is the faithful maintenance of both active and inactive epigenetic states of specific genomic regions. Three known biochemical mechanisms exist to control the states of chromatin: histone posttranslational modifications (on both the unstructured N-terminal tails and core regions), ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling by Swi2/Snf2 family members, and histone variant substitution. The current goal of the field is to link these mechanisms to epigenetic regulation. Substantial progress has been made in understanding how silent heterochromatin is generated and maintained. Compared to heterochromatin, less is understood about how euchromatin is generated, maintained, and inherited. Indeed, euchromatin has widely been viewed as a default state. More recently, however, several chromatin modifications have been identified that promote the euchromatic state by antagonizing silencing. These include the replacement of histone H2A by H2A.Z (Meneghini et al., 2003Meneghini M.D. Wu M. Madhani H.D.

Dot1p modulates silencing in yeast by methylation of the nucleosome core.Cell. 2002; 109: 745-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). In this paper, we focus on the deposition pattern of H2A.Z in euchromatin and its implications. In previous work, we demonstrated that in S. cerevisiae, the evolutionarily conserved histone variant H2A.Z functions in euchromatin to antagonize the spread of Sir-dependent silencing. Furthermore, we showed that at the right border of the HMRa silent mating-type cassette, H2A.Z functions in parallel with a well-characterized boundary element (Meneghini et al., 2003Meneghini M.D. Wu M. Madhani H.D. Conserved histone variant H2A.Z protects euchromatin from the ectopic spread of silent heterochromatin.Cell. 2003; 112: 725-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Thus, H2A.Z is a component of euchromatin that functions to antagonize the opposite chromatin state. One key question, therefore, is whether H2A.Z is randomly distributed through euchromatin and if not, how its deposition to specific sites is determined. We and others have also identified a 13 subunit ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex, the Swr1 complex, that is required for the deposition of H2A.Z in vivo (Kobor et al., 2004Kobor M.S. Venkatasubrahmanyam S. Meneghini M.D. Gin J.W. Jennings J. Link A.J. Madhani H.D. Rine J.

ATP-driven exchange of histone H2AZ variant catalyzed by SWR1 chromatin remodeling complex.Science. 2004; 303: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Where the Swr1 complex acts and how its specificity is determined is not known. A subunit of this complex is Bdf1, a protein containing two tandem bromodomains known to bind acetylated histone tails (Ladurner et al., 2003Ladurner A.G. Inouye C. Jain R. Tjian R.

Different sensitivities of bromodomain factors 1 and 2 to histone H4 acetylation.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 353-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This suggests recognition of histone acetylation as one potential mechanism for the targeting of H2A.Z deposition to euchromatin. Early chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments performed by Smith and coworkers suggested a relative enrichment of an epitope-tagged version of H2A.Z at the promoter regions of the highly inducible GAL1–10 and PHO5 genes in yeast (Santisteban et al., 2000Santisteban M.S. Kalashnikova T. Smith M.M. Histone H2A.Z regulates transcription and is partially redundant with nucleosome remodeling complexes.Cell. 2000; 103: 411-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Moreover, these experiments demonstrated enrichment under noninducing conditions for the linked genes, and this enrichment decreased upon gene induction. However, it is difficult to make general conclusions from these studies for three reasons. First, since only four intergenic regions were examined, their correlation with higher H2A.Z levels could have been coincidental. Second, since no intergenic regions lacking a promoter were examined, the correlation with H2A.Z levels could have reflected preferential H2A.Z deposition in intergenic regions rather than in promoters per se. Third, since nucleosome density was not examined in the gene induction experiments, whether H2A.Z was selectively removed upon gene activation relative to H3, for example, was not clear. Thus, the following issues remain unresolved: (1) where is H2A.Z deposited in general?, (2) what is the relationship between H2A.Z deposition to transcription?, and (3) what are the signals that induce its deposition? Previous studies have described a prominent role for H2A.Z at heterochromatin-proximal regions to antagonize the spread of silencing; however, we were curious to examine whether H2A.Z might play a broader role in the genome. Such additional roles could be elucidated through knowledge of the deposition profile of H2A.Z across chromosomes. We chose to examine the H2A.Z deposition profile in S. cerevisiae chromosome III because it contains the HMRa and HMLα silent mating-type cassettes and is well characterized with respect to the location of replication origins, cohesion sites, and transcription initiation sites. This analysis was conducted with a strain carrying an allele of H2A.Z with an amino-terminal influenza hemagglutinin epitope tag (HA3-HTZ1) that was integrated at the endogenous locus as the sole genomic copy. This allele is functional in that it can complement the synthetic lethality of htz1Δ with bre1Δ (Hwang et al., 2003Hwang W.W. Venkatasubrahmanyam S. Ianculescu A.G. Tong A. Boone C. Madhani H.D. A conserved RING finger protein required for histone H2B monoubiquitination and cell size control.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 261-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). ChIP and quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR) were used to determine H2A.Z enrichment at 300 bp segments whose 5′ ends were spaced at 1000 bp intervals across chromosome III. We observed a highly nonuniform and chromosome-wide distribution of H2A.Z (Figure 1A ; see Table S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Further analysis of our data indicated that the level of H2A.Z deposition at a given ChIP probe region was positively correlated with its proximity to the nearest 5′ end of a gene (Figure 1B). However, we observed no apparent correlation with proximity to 3′ ends of genes that are not near 5′ ends, the transcription rate of the nearest gene, cohesion sites, or origins of replication (M.Z.B., M.D.M., and H.D.M., unpublished data and see below). We next increased the resolution of our chromosome III analysis to a single intergenic region flanked by two nonconverging ORFs. The intergenic region upstream of SNT1 was chosen because it is significantly smaller relative to the SNT1 coding region. A 4.2 kb continuous region starting from 2 kb upstream of the SNT1 initiation codon to 2.2 kb downstream was assayed for H2A.Z enrichment by ChIP and QPCR using primer sets that tiled the region. This assay revealed a striking intergenic enrichment for H2A.Z with a sharp decline in the coding region of SNT1 and in the upstream gene BPH1 (Figure 1C). We then identified a larger region of chromosome III (the LEU2-YCL012W interval) containing a mixture of gene orientations: genes whose 5′ ends share an intergenic region (5′-5′); genes whose 5′ ends are adjacent to a 3′ end (5′ only); and genes whose 3′ ends converge (3′-3′). We assayed the H2A.Z deposition profile within this 11 kb region by ChIP and QPCR. This tiling analysis revealed that for every H2A.Z peak of enrichment, there was a corresponding 5′ end (Figure 1D). In most cases, the peak enrichment of H2A.Z was close to or directly upstream of the initiation codon. The only shared 5′ region in this data set (the DCC1-BUD3 intergenic region) had two distinct peaks of H2A.Z enrichment, one corresponding to the 5′ end of each gene. The observed H2A.Z peaks in these promoter regions were not due to increased crosslinkability or nucleosome density of these regions because additional ChIP analysis of histone H3 across the same region revealed slightly lower, not higher, ChIP signals in intergenic regions (Figure S1). Finally, the two regions with converging ORFs (3′-3′) had no observable peak of H2A.Z, supporting the notion that H2A.Z is indeed selectively enriched at 5′ regions of genes. Our initial analyses of H2A.Z deposition relied on a ChIP protocol that involved shearing DNA to an average size of 500 bp, which meant that QPCR analyses of immunoprecipitated material resolved multiple nucleosomes, thereby obscuring finer details of H2A.Z localization. In addition, the tiling methods we used to assay H2A.Z deposition at an appropriate resolution are not feasible for rapidly examining much larger regions such as whole chromosomes. To overcome these two limitations, we used a ChIP and microarray hybridization protocol to analyze the distribution of endogenous, untagged H2A.Z at the resolution of single nucleosomes; the data were normalized for nucleosome density (see Experimental Procedures). The microarrays tiled the majority of chromosome III and 223 additional regulatory regions at a resolution of 20 bp. These experiments yielded a nucleosome-resolution map of H2A.Z enrichment patterns across nearly half a megabase of the S. cerevisiae genome (Table S2). Analysis of the data recapitulated our initial conclusions about the specific deposition of H2A.Z at 5′ ends of genes (Figure 1) and extended these conclusions to a larger portion of the yeast genome. Figure 2A shows the microarray data for the regions analyzed by QPCR in Figures 1C and 1D. Consistent with the QPCR data, the region upstream of SNT1 contains H2A.Z, and this H2A.Z signal has now been resolved into a striking distribution pattern in which two consecutive nucleosomes contain H2A.Z. Two H2A.Z nucleosomes are also found upstream of the BPH1 gene, one upstream of the FEN1 gene and two in the RRP43-RBK1 intergenic region that is flanked by the 5′ ends of the respective genes. In contrast, no H2A.Z peak was observed in the FEN1-RRP43 intergenic region that is flanked by the 3′ ends of those two genes. Also shown in Figure 2A is a portion of the NFS1-YCL012C region analyzed in Figure 1D; LEU2 is missing because this gene is deleted in the strain profiled using the microarray method. The QPCR analysis of this region was precisely recapitulated by the microarray data: H2A.Z was found specifically in intergenic regions that contain at least one 5′ end of a gene. Indeed, analysis of the entirety of chromosome III revealed H2A.Z upstream of most euchromatic genes and not at intergenic regions flanked by two converging 3′ ends (Table S2). Genes on chromosome III that lacked detectable H2A.Z in their promoter regions correspond to genes in the HMLα silent cassette, genes near the telomeres of chromosome III, ORFs annotated as “dubious,” and seven apparently bona fide euchromatic genes (HIS4, POL4, ADY2, AGP1, RPS14A, PMP1, and YCR006C). While it is not obvious why these genes lack H2A.Z in their promoter regions, we note that YCR006C contains a tRNA gene in its upstream regions. tRNA genes have been shown to contain boundary activity (Donze et al., 1999Donze D. Adams C.R. Rine J. Kamakaka R.T. The boundaries of the silenced HMR domain in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 698-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and have been shown to inhibit expression of adjacent Pol II-transcribed genes (Bolton and Boeke, 2003Bolton E.C. Boeke J.D. Transcriptional interactions between yeast tRNA genes, flanking genes and Ty elements: a genomic point of view.Genome Res. 2003; 13: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Since genes lacking H2A.Z in their promoters represent a small minority, we conclude that H2A.Z generally marks the 5′ ends of genes in euchromatin. Recent work by Yuan and coworkers (2005) demonstrated that nucleosomes are generally uniformly distributed across yeast promoters and ORFs but nearly all yeast genes contain an ∼150 bp nucleosome-free region (NFR) centered ∼200 bp upstream of the initiation codon. cDNA hybridization studies demonstrated that these regions contain the initiation site for transcription of their associated genes (Yuan et al., 2005Yuan G.C. Liu Y.J. Dion M.F. Slack M.D. Wu L.F. Altschuler S.J. Rando O.J. Genome-scale identification of nucleosome positions in S. cerevisiae.Science. 2005; 309: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). The genes represented in the H2A.Z microarray data were aligned by the center of their NFRs to generate a cluster hierarchy shown in Figure 2B. Remarkably, for about 2/3 of the genes analyzed, the NFR is flanked by two nucleosomes that contain H2A.Z. The remainder of these genes appears either to have H2A.Z present only at one nucleosome or lack H2A.Z entirely for potential reasons explained above (Table S3). Thus, not only does H2A.Z mark the 5′ ends of genes, but two positioned H2A.Z nucleosomes typically flank the transcription initiation site. These data demonstrate that H2A.Z nucleosomes are placed in a highly stereotyped and organized manner at the 5′ ends of genes. The striking localization of H2A.Z at most gene promoters suggested that there could be a relationship between H2A.Z and gene transcription. To address this issue, we selected from the H2A.Z ChIP microarray data those genes that contain two H2A.Z nucleosomes flanking a NFR and compared the levels of H2A.Z enrichment at each of the two nucleosomes to two distinct measurements of transcriptional activity for the corresponding gene (Figure 3). We used genome-scale data from either an analysis of initiation rates (Fraser et al., 2004Fraser H.B. Hirsh A.E. Giaever G. Kumm J. Eisen M.B. Noise minimization in eukaryotic gene expression.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e137https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0020137Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar; Figures 3A and 3C) or RNA polymerase II occupancy (Kim et al., 2004Kim M. Krogan N.J. Vasiljeva L. Rando O.J. Nedea E. Greenblatt J.F. Buratowski S. The yeast Rat1 exonuclease promotes transcription termination by RNA polymerase II.Nature. 2004; 432: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar; Figures 3B and 3D). Comparison of H2A.Z enrichment at genes to either data set showed no correlation between H2A.Z enrichment and transcriptional activity. In other words, the transcription rate of a gene does not predict the levels of H2A.Z at a given promoter. To further assess whether H2A.Z requires active transcription for its selective enrichment at gene promoter regions, we examined several promoter regions under conditions known to produce their tight repression. We first chose to examine the sporulation/meiosis-specific genes DIT1, DIT2, HOP1, and SPO22 in a haploid strain grown in rich media. These genes are transcriptionally inactive in haploid cells and in nonmeiotic diploid cells (Chu et al., 1998Chu S. DeRisi J. Eisen M. Mulholland J. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Herskowitz I. The transcriptional program of sporulation in budding yeast.Science. 1998; 282: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar). Additionally, these four occur in two pairs in which their 5′ ends flank an intergenic promoter region. Strikingly, we observed peaks of H2A.Z enrichment at both of the shared promoter regions (Figures 4A and 4B ). These patterns were not explained by underlying nucleosome density since H3 is relatively evenly distributed across these intervals (Figure S2). To attempt to observe de novo deposition of H2A.Z at these loci, we constructed a galactose-inducible HA epitope-tagged allele of HTZ1 with which we could selectively induce or repress the transcription of H2A.Z. As expected, under the repressive glucose condition, virtually no H2A.Z is detectable by ChIP (Figure S3). However, after growth for several generations in galactose, peaks of H2A.Z enrichment were observed at the divergent promoters of both meiotic gene pairs (Figure S3). Thus, H2A.Z can be deposited at inactive genes. Another region we examined is the highly regulated mating-type specific gene AGA2. In yeast, a-specific genes (asgs) such as AGA2 have been well studied and are known to be active in MATa strains but extremely tightly repressed by the α2-Mcm1 complex in MATα and MATa/α strains (Galitski et al., 1999Galitski T. Saldanha A.J. Styles C.A. Lander E.S. Fink G.R. Ploidy regulation of gene expression.Science. 1999; 285: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). We utilized isogenic strains harboring the chromosomal HA3-HTZ1 allele and differing only in the allele present at the mating type locus (MATa or MATα). Using ChIP and QPCR, we observed a peak of H2A.Z signal at AGA2 in MATa and its continued presence in MATα strains (Figure 4C). Although well above those seen in the ORF of the BUD3 gene (Figure 4C), H2A.Z levels were approximately 2-fold lower at the repressed AGA2 locus compared to the active locus even though promoter histone H3 signals were similar in a versus α cells (Figures 4C and S2). Previous work showed that asg promoters display relative hypoacetylation on the histone H4 tails in MATα strains relative to MATa strains (Deckert and Struhl, 2001Deckert J. Struhl K. Histone acetylation at promoters is differentially affected by specific activators and repressors.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2726-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We performed ChIP using antibodies raised against a tetra-acetylated peptide derived from the N-terminal tail of histone H4 (Ac4H4), and confirmed this result—an approximately 2-fold reduction of acetylation was observed in the MATα strains (Figure 4D). Interestingly, both the positioning and relative level of acetylation in a versus α cells closely parallels those of HA3-HTZ1 at AGA2, suggesting potential interplay between acetylation and H2A.Z deposition. Finally, we identified two genes involved in mating in the microarray data that have been shown not to be expressed under vegetative conditions: FIG2 and PRM1. Previous work has shown that expression of these genes only occurs in response to mating pheromone (Erdman et al., 1998Erdman S. Lin L. Malczynski M. Snyder M. Pheromone-regulated genes required for yeast mating differentiation.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 461-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, Heiman and Walter, 2000Heiman M.G. Walter P. Prm1p, a pheromone-regulated multispanning membrane protein, facilitates plasma membrane fusion during yeast mating.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 719-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Analysis of H2A.Z enrichment at these loci revealed peaks in their promoter regions (Figure S4). Our analysis revealed no correlation between H2A.Z levels normalized for nucleosome density and transcription rates or RNA polymerase II occupancies, suggesting no general relationship between transcription and H2A.Z levels. As described in the Introduction, previous studies of H2A.Z levels at GAL1 and PHO5 promoters revealed that it decreased upon gene induction, although whether this represented exchange of H2A.Z for H2A or general nucleosome depletion was not determined. In contrast, we observed that while the inactive AGA2 promoter contains H2A.Z, its levels are higher when the gene is active. To extend these results, we examined H2A.Z and H3 levels at a gene that is highly inducible by mating pheromone, FIG1 (Erdman et al., 1998Erdman S. Lin L. Malczynski M. Snyder M. Pheromone-regulated genes required for yeast mating differentiation.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 461-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure S5, FIG1 expression is dependent on mating pheromone—treatment of cells with mating pheromone strongly induced mRNA accumulation over a 1 hr time course as determined by quantitative RT-PCR. ChIP analysis revealed that H2A.Z is depleted during gene induction. However, H3 was also depleted from the FIG1 promoter during the time course such at the 5, 15, and 30 min time points, the ratio of H2A.Z to H3 was constant (Figure S5). At the 60 min time point, an apparent depletion of H2A.Z relative to H3 was observed; however, it seems likely that the promoter H3 signal at this time point was elevated as an artifact of signal from flanking nucleosomes that were not separated by sonication from the promoter nucleosomes prior to ChIP (Figure S5). The H2A.Z signal would not be subject to this problem since H2A.Z nucleosomes are distributed in a punctate pattern whereas H3-containing nucleosomes are distributed homogenously. Thus, with the possible exception of this late time point, activation of FIG1 results in nucleosome loss rather than the specific replacement of H2A.Z with H2A. We performed a reporter-based genome-wide screen of the S. cerevisiae knockout collection to identify genes that antagonize the spread of silencing from the HMRa silent mating type cassette (R.M.R. and H.D.M., unpublished data). This screen identified Eaf1, a nonessential component of the essential NuA4 HAT complex and the bromodomain-containing proteins, Bdf1 and Bdf2. Bdf1 is a component of the Swr1 complex responsible for H2A.Z deposition, and both Bdf1 and Bdf2 bind to acetylated histone tails (Ladurner et al., 2003Ladurner A.G. Inouye C. Jain R. Tjian R.

Different sensitivities of bromodomain factors 1 and 2 to histone H4 acetylation.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 353-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To test whether histone acetylation is important for H2A.Z deposition, we generated strains bearing the HA3-HTZ1 allele containing deletions of the genes encoding the H4-specific histone acetyltransferase (HAT) Eaf1 or the H3- and H4-specific HAT Elp3. In addition, we created a strain lacking both HATs. ChIP analysis revealed a dependence upon histone tail acetylation for robust H2A.Z enrichment (Figure 5A ). At a majority of loci examined, deletion of EAF1 resulted in a reproducible defect in H2A.Z levels. The defects varied from approximately 1.5- to 3-fold in magnitude. Likewise, deletion of ELP3 also led to a defect at most loci, albeit more quantitatively modest than those of the eaf1Δ mutant. The severity of the defects in the eaf1Δ elp3Δ double mutant is not significantly greater than either of the single deletions (Figure 5A), suggesting Eaf1 and Elp3 may act in the same pathway to mediate H2A.Z deposition. To further test the role of histone acetylation in H2A.Z deposition, we utilized a series of histone H3 and H4 mutants in which specific target lysine residues have been mutated to arginine which prevents acetylation. We observed a consistent quantitative defect in H2A.Z enrichment values at most of the 10 loci examined (Figures 5B and 5C). In general, the strongest defects were observed in cells harboring the H3-K9R mutant or the H4-K5R,K12R mutant. For the H4-K5R,K12R mutant, we performed ChIP using antibodies against H3 as well and found no differences in nucleosome density at the loci examined in Figure 5C, indicating that the defect in H2A.Z deposition was not caused by general nucleosome loss (Figure S6). Surprisingly, a deletion mutant in the H4 tail displayed a less-severe defect than the H4-K5R,K12R mutant (Figure 5C). The H4-K8R,K16R mutant displayed no defect, indicating that not all mutants in acetylatable tail lysines produce a defect in H2A.Z deposition (Figure 5C). Having established a role for histone tail acetylation for complete H2A.Z deposition, we hypothesized that acetylation could be acting to recruit targeting of the Swr1 complex via binding of its subunit Bdf1 to acetylated tails. This is an attractive model because in addition to being important for antisilencing, Bdf1 is known to bind preferentially to acetylated forms of histone H4 and is enriched in intergenic regions throughout the genome (Kurdistani et al., 2004Kurdistani S.K. Tavazoie S. Grunstein M. Mapping global histone acetylation patterns to gene expression.Cell. 2004; 117: 721-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). However, ChIP analysis using polyclonal Htz1 antibody raised against the C-terminal tail region showed that a bdf1Δ strain has little or no defect in H2A.Z enrichment at euchromatic loci (Figure 5E). We reasoned that this could be due to compensatory activity by the redundant gene BDF2, which when deleted yielded no detectable defect in H2A.Z enrichment (data not shown). Unfortunately, bdf1Δ bdf2Δ strains are inviable, precluding a test of this hypothesis using null alleles. Therefore, we elected to generate a “knockdown” allele of BDF2 by replacing its 3′UTR region with a MX6 marker cassette. This maneuver has been found to consistently cause destabilization of the cognate mRNA (Schuldiner et al., 2005Schuldiner, M., Collins, S.R., Thompson, N.J., Denic, V., Bhamidipati, A., Punna, T., Ihmels, J., Andrews, B., Boone, C., Greenblatt, J.F., et al.

https://openalex.org/W2154218976,"The Mixed-Lineage Leukemia (MLL) protein is a histone methyltransferase that is mutated in clinically and biologically distinctive subsets of acute leukemia. MLL normally associates with a cohort of highly conserved cofactors to form a macromolecular complex that includes menin, a product of the MEN1 tumor suppressor gene, which is mutated in heritable and sporadic endocrine tumors. We demonstrate here that oncogenic MLL fusion proteins retain an ability to stably associate with menin through a high-affinity, amino-terminal, conserved binding motif and that this interaction is required for the initiation of MLL-mediated leukemogenesis. Furthermore, menin is essential for maintenance of MLL-associated but not other oncogene induced myeloid transformation. Acute genetic ablation of menin reverses aberrant Hox gene expression mediated by MLL-menin promoter-associated complexes, and specifically abrogates the differentiation arrest and oncogenic properties of MLL-transformed leukemic blasts. These results demonstrate that a human oncoprotein is critically dependent on direct physical interaction with a tumor suppressor protein for its oncogenic activity, validate a potential target for molecular therapy, and suggest central roles for menin in altered epigenetic functions underlying the pathogenesis of hematopoietic cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2128542570,"Histone variants help specialize chromatin regions; however, their impact on transcriptional regulation is largely unknown. Here, we determined the genome-wide localization and dynamics of Htz1, the yeast histone H2A variant. Htz1 localizes to hundreds of repressed/basal Pol II promoters and prefers TATA-less promoters. Specific Htz1 deposition requires the SWR1 complex, which largely colocalizes with Htz1. Htz1 occupancy correlates with particular histone modifications, and Htz1 deposition is partially reliant on Gcn5 (a histone acetyltransferase) and Bdf1, an SWR1 complex member that binds acetylated histones. Changes in growth conditions cause a striking redistribution of Htz1 from activated to repressed/basal promoters. Furthermore, Htz1 promotes full gene activation but does not generally impact repression. Importantly, Htz1 releases from purified chromatin in vitro under conditions where H2A and H3 remain associated. We suggest that Htz1-bearing nucleosomes are deposited at repressed/basal promoters but facilitate activation through their susceptibility to loss, thereby helping to expose promoter DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1991505198,"Illumination changes elicit modifications of thylakoid proteins and reorganization of the photosynthetic machinery. This involves, in the short term, phosphorylation of photosystem II (PSII) and light-harvesting (LHCII) proteins. PSII phosphorylation is thought to be relevant for PSII turnover1,2, whereas LHCII phosphorylation is associated with the relocation of LHCII and the redistribution of excitation energy (state transitions) between photosystems3,4. In the long term, imbalances in energy distribution between photosystems are counteracted by adjusting photosystem stoichiometry5,6. In the green alga Chlamydomonas and the plant Arabidopsis, state transitions require the orthologous protein kinases STT7 and STN7, respectively7,8. Here we show that in Arabidopsis a second protein kinase, STN8, is required for the quantitative phosphorylation of PSII core proteins. However, PSII activity under high-intensity light is affected only slightly in stn8 mutants, and D1 turnover is indistinguishable from the wild type, implying that reversible protein phosphorylation is not essential for PSII repair. Acclimation to changes in light quality is defective in stn7 but not in stn8 mutants, indicating that short-term and long-term photosynthetic adaptations are coupled. Therefore the phosphorylation of LHCII, or of an unknown substrate of STN7, is also crucial for the control of photosynthetic gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2020120461,"The C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is an essential component of transcriptional regulation and RNA processing of protein-coding genes. A large body of data also implicates the CTD in the transcription and processing of RNAPII-mediated small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). However, the identity of the complex (or complexes) that associates with the CTD and mediates the processing of snRNAs has remained elusive. Here, we describe an RNA polymerase II complex that contains at least 12 novel subunits, termed the Integrator, in addition to core RNAPII subunits. Two of the Integrator subunits display similarities to the subunits of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex. We show that Integrator is recruited to the U1 and U2 snRNA genes and mediates the snRNAs' 3' end processing. The Integrator complex is evolutionarily conserved in metazoans and directly interacts with the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase II largest subunit."
https://openalex.org/W2028337591,"The Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their ephrin ligands are mediators of cell-cell communication. Cleavage of ephrin-A2 by the ADAM10 membrane metalloprotease enables contact repulsion between Eph- and ephrin-expressing cells. How ADAM10 interacts with ephrins in a regulated manner to cleave only Eph bound ephrin molecules remains unclear. The structure of ADAM10 disintegrin and cysteine-rich domains and the functional studies presented here define an essential substrate-recognition module for functional interaction of ADAM10 with the ephrin-A5/EphA3 complex. While ADAM10 constitutively associates with EphA3, the formation of a functional EphA3/ephrin-A5 complex creates a new molecular recognition motif for the ADAM10 cysteine-rich domain that positions the proteinase domain for effective ephrin-A5 cleavage. Surprisingly, the cleavage occurs in trans, with ADAM10 and its substrate being on the membranes of opposing cells. Our data suggest a simple mechanism for regulating ADAM10-mediated ephrin proteolysis, which ensures that only Eph bound ephrins are recognized and cleaved."

Phagocytosis, the uptake and digestion of particulate materials by cells, is an ancient, evolutionarily conserved process (Metchnikoff, 1908Metchnikoff, I.I. (1908).

In mammals, specialized blood cells, macrophages and neutrophils, remove senescent and apoptotic cells and are essential for the clearance and killing of infectious microbes. These professional phagocytes play a central role in both innate and adaptive immunity, but their analysis is hampered by their receptor diversity and by the complexity of the signaling and cellular processes underlying phagocytosis (Greenberg and Grinstein, 2002Greenberg S.

Interesting insights into phagocytosis may be gained therefore by using simpler model systems such as the worm Caenorhabditis elegans (Reddien and Horvitz, 2004Reddien P.W. Horvitz H.R.

Phylogenetic perspectives in innate immunity.Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2069) Google Scholar). Drosophila melanogaster has a primitive yet highly effective immune system that relies exclusively on innate effector mechanisms, including epithelial and systemic responses generating antimicrobial peptides, a phenoloxidase reaction leading to melanin deposition, and a cellular response resulting in the encapsulation or phagocytosis of intruding pathogens (Hoffmann, 2003Hoffmann J.A.

Fruit flies have three terminally differentiated blood cell types (so-called hemocytes) which can be distinguished morphologically (Rizki and Rizki, 1984Rizki T.M. Rizki R.M.

Plasmatocytes resemble the professional phagocytes of mammals. They constitute the main class of Drosophila hemocytes (>95%), comprise sessile and circulating subsets, and efficiently phagocytose apoptotic cells (Tepass et al., 1994Tepass U. Fessler L.I. Aziz A.

It has been suggested that phagocytosis enhances Drosophila host defenses since blocking phagocytosis by latex bead preinjection (Elrod-Erickson et al., 2000Elrod-Erickson M. Mishra S. Schneider D.

USA. 1998; 95: 14337-14342Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) leads to sensitization to infection. However, Drosophila mutants viable beyond the larval stage and specifically devoid of phagocytes or with impaired phagocyte function have not been described. In recent years, much progress has been made in elucidating the molecules that Drosophila uses to sense infectious organisms. Members of two protein families, peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) and β-glucan recognition proteins (GNBPs), bind to microbial surfaces and are required to trigger the molecular cascades that lead to the induction of antimicrobial peptide responses via two NF-κB-like pathways, Toll and IMD, which share conserved modules between insects and man (Ferrandon et al., 2004Ferrandon D. Imler J.L. Hoffmann J.A. Sensing infection in Drosophila: Toll and beyond.Semin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). By contrast, the receptors for the phagocytic uptake of microbes by Drosophila phagocytes are less well characterized. We have previously described two phagocytic receptors that mediate cell surface binding and uptake of bacteria in a phagocytic Drosophila cell line (S2 cells): SR-CI, a scavenger receptor similar to mammalian class A scavenger receptors (Rämet et al., 2001Rämet M. Pearson A. Manfruelli P. Li X. Koziel H. Gobel V. Chung E. Krieger M. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Drosophila scavenger receptor CI is a pattern recognition receptor for bacteria.Immunity. 2001; 15: 1027-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and PGRP-LC, a member of the PGRP family (Rämet et al., 2002Rämet M. Manfruelli P. Pearson A. Mathey-Prevot B. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Functional genomic analysis of phagocytosis and identification of a Drosophila receptor for E. coli.Nature. 2002; 416: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). However, quantitative analysis indicates that SR-CI and PGRP-LC account for only a fraction of the total bacterial phagocytosis activity in S2 cells, suggesting that additional unknown bacterial phagocytosis receptors must exist in Drosophila (Rämet et al., 2001Rämet M. Pearson A. Manfruelli P. Li X. Koziel H. Gobel V. Chung E. Krieger M. Ezekowitz R.A.B.

Functional genomic analysis of phagocytosis and identification of a Drosophila receptor for E. coli.Nature. 2002; 416: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the identification of a predicted transmembrane protein with prominent EGF-like repeats which we called Eater. We have addressed the role of this molecule in bacterial cell surface binding and phagocytosis, as well as in host defense to bacterial infection in vivo. We recently identified the GATA transcription factor Serpent in a high-throughput RNA interference screen as a regulator of bacterial cell surface binding and phagocytosis (Rämet et al., 2002Rämet M. Manfruelli P. Pearson A. Mathey-Prevot B. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Functional genomic analysis of phagocytosis and identification of a Drosophila receptor for E. coli.Nature. 2002; 416: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Serpent is involved in hematopoiesis in Drosophila (reviewed in Evans et al., 2003Evans C.J. Hartenstein V. Banerjee U. Thicker than blood: Conserved mechanisms in Drosophila and vertebrate hematopoiesis.Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 673-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and remains expressed in differentiating (Evans et al., 2003Evans C.J. Hartenstein V. Banerjee U. Thicker than blood: Conserved mechanisms in Drosophila and vertebrate hematopoiesis.Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 673-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and mature plasmatocytes (M.M., unpublished data). Therefore, we reasoned that Serpent might control the expression of cell surface proteins responsible for microbial binding and uptake. In order to identify such molecules, we performed a microarray analysis of S2 cells in which Serpent had been knocked down by RNA interference (RNAi) (M.R. and R.A.B.E., unpublished data). Comparison of the transcriptional profiles from Serpent RNAi-treated cells to control cells identified 46 genes that were downregulated by 2-fold or more and had a signal sequence or transmembrane regions, or both (see Table S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Among these genes was SR-CI, a previously identified phagocytic receptor (Rämet et al., 2001Rämet M. Pearson A. Manfruelli P. Li X. Koziel H. Gobel V. Chung E. Krieger M. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Drosophila scavenger receptor CI is a pattern recognition receptor for bacteria.Immunity. 2001; 15: 1027-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). We assessed the role of the 45 other genes by RNAi knockdown using a previously established, flow cytometry-based, bacterial phagocytosis assay (Rämet et al., 2002Rämet M. Manfruelli P. Pearson A. Mathey-Prevot B. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Functional genomic analysis of phagocytosis and identification of a Drosophila receptor for E. coli.Nature. 2002; 416: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar; see Figure 1A ). As shown in Table S1, most treatments had no or only minor effects on phagocytosis. However, one particular gene, CG6124, encoding a predicted cell-surface receptor, showed strong reduction in phagocytosis of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. We named this gene eater. Figures 1A–1C depict the flow cytometry-based phagocytosis analysis of S2 cells in which eater was knocked down. The phagocytosis defect observed after eater knockdown can be attributed largely to decreased bacterial binding to the surface of S2 cells (Figure 1D). Effective knockdown of eater message was confirmed by semiquantitative RT-PCR (Figure 1E). The Drosophila genome contains two predicted EGF-like repeat-containing cell-surface receptors related to eater (CG8942 and CG18146; amino acid homology in both cases about 40% identity/54% similarity). RNAi knockdown of CG8942 and CG18146 did not affect the phagocytosis (Figures 1B and 1C) nor the cell-surface binding of bacteria (Figure 1D). eater knockdown had no effect on the activation of two targets of the IMD and Toll pathways, the Attacin and Drosomycin promoters (Figure S1A). Furthermore, eater knockdown did not affect cell viability (108 ± SD 20% of β-galactosidase reporter gene activity relative to the mean of 20 different control treatments [n = 16]) and had only a mild effect on the endocytosis of acetylated low-density lipoprotein (eater RNAi 82 ± SD 5.5% of GFP control; untreated 87 ± SD 7.6% of GFP control; n ≥ 13). Combined RNAi experiments were used to address the role of eater in phagocytosis of S. aureus and E. coli relative to the two previously described S2 cell phagocytic receptors, SR-CI and PGRP-LC (Figure S2). Transcriptional silencing of eater abolished the major part of the phagocytic activity in S2 cells. Additional silencing of SR-CI and PGRP-LC further decreased phagocytosis and cell-surface binding, indicating that multiple receptors cooperate in the recognition and internalization of microbes in flies, as has been documented in mammals (Stuart and Ezekowitz, 2005Stuart L.M. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Phagocytosis: Elegant complexity.Immunity. 2005; 22: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Taken together, our RNA interference analysis in S2 cells suggests that eater encodes a predominant protein involved in the recognition, cell-surface binding, and phagocytosis of bacteria in Drosophila macrophages. In order to characterize the eater gene product, we in vitro transcribed and translated an eater cDNA derived from S2 cells (clone SD22390), as well as the open reading frame of eater fused to a C-terminal histidine tag. In both cases, we obtained a single specific translation product in the 120 kDa range (Figures 2A and 2B ). Truncation of the cDNAs with PvuII resulted in a size shift of the translation product (predicted to correspond to 358 amino acids or 38 kDa) which unambigously identified the larger, full-length translation products (Figure 2A). Thus, it appears likely that the cDNA clone SD22390 encodes a protein of 1206 amino acids that corresponds to a single membrane-spanning receptor with an N-terminal signal sequence and a C-terminal membrane anchor followed by an intracellular domain of 28 amino acids containing a potential tyrosine phosphorylation motif (Figures 2C and 2D). The extracellular domain of the Eater protein is predicted to comprise 32 typical, noncalcium binding EGF-like repeats (Figures 2C–2E). EGF-like repeats are abundant protein domains playing a role in extracellular protein-protein interactions such as adhesion, coagulation, and receptor-ligand interactions. They contain about 40 amino acids comprising six disulfide-bonded cysteines and several additional conserved residues at defined positions (Campbell and Bork, 1993Campbell I.D. Bork P. Epidermal growth factor-like modules.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 385-392Crossref Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Database searches indicate that molecules with a single EGF-like repeat with exactly the same cysteine array as displayed by Eater (C-X3-C-X3-C-X4-C-X5-C-X-C) are found in a large variety of organisms including mammals, whereas proteins with multiple repeats are found in insects only (data not shown). One of these was p120, a suggested scavenger receptor in the flesh fly (40% overall amino acid identity; Hori et al., 2000Hori S. Kobayashi A. Natori S. A novel hemocyte-specific membrane protein of Sarcophaga (flesh fly).Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5397-5403Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Searches with a more relaxed consensus sequence identified the C. elegans molecule CED-1, a putative engulfment receptor for apoptotic cells (25% overall amino acid identity; Zhou et al., 2001Zhou Z. Hartwieg E. Horvitz H.R.

Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. Expression cloning of a novel scavenger receptor from human endothelial cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31217-31220Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, CED-1/SREC has atypical EGF-like repeats with eight cysteines (Figure 1E). In addition, Eater had low-level homologies (30% overall amino acid identity or lower) to EGF repeat-containing proteins of the Notch family and extracellular matrix proteins such as tenascins and fibrillins (Campbell and Bork, 1993Campbell I.D. Bork P. Epidermal growth factor-like modules.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 385-392Crossref Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The first four EGF-like repeats in Eater show a higher level of diversity with respect to amino acid variation, overall repeat length, and predicted N-glycosylation sites (Figure 2D), suggesting that the N-terminal part of Eater could be functionally important in ligand binding, while the more repetitive EGF modules might serve as a stalk. We engineered an expression plasmid, which comprised the predicted signal sequence and two complete N-terminal tandem EGF repeats (Eater 1–199 His) and stably transfected this construct into S2 cells. The protein was secreted and purified via a C-terminal histidine tag from S2 cell supernatant. N-terminal amino acid sequencing indicated that the first five amino acids of the mature secreted Eater protein correspond to Gln-Ile-Cys-Thr-Val, consistent with the prediction of an 18 amino acid signal sequence (Figure 2D). The purified protein migrated on SDS gels as multiple bands (Figure 3A ). Deglycosylation with Peptide:N-Glycosidase F, an enzyme that cleaves almost all N-glycan chains, yielded a single band of the predicted size (22 kDa; Figure 3A), indicating that at least some of the predicted glycosylation sites are used. In order to address whether Eater is involved in the direct recognition of bacteria, we incubated heat-killed gram-negative bacteria (Serratia marcescens) with biotinylated N-terminal Eater 1–199 His protein. Figures 3B–3E show strong, specific binding of Eater 1–199 His protein to S. marcescens. Binding was conformation dependent (Figure 3C), concentration dependent (data not shown), and could be competed with a 10-fold excess of unlabeled Eater 1–199 His protein (Figures 3B and 3D), while excess GST-His control protein had no effect (Figure 3D). Moreover, typical scavenger receptor ligands such as oxidized and acetylated low-density lipoprotein (LDL; see Greaves and Gordon, 2005Greaves D.R. Gordon S. Thematic review series: the immune system and atherogenesis. Recent insights into the biology of macrophage scavenger receptors.J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) efficiently inhibited Eater 1–199 His binding to bacteria, while unmodified native LDL did not. Strong Eater 1–199 His binding was also observed with gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus) and yeast (C. silvativa) (Figure S3), indicating that similar to mammalian scavenger receptors, the N-terminal part of Eater is capable of recognizing multiple ligands. These data strongly support the prediction that Eater is a scavenger receptor-like type I transmembrane protein which can function on the cell surface as a microbial receptor or as part of a receptor complex, and whose N-terminal 199 amino acids participate directly in microbial binding. In order to gain insight into the role that Eater plays in Drosophila in vivo, we characterized eater expression patterns. eater mRNA appeared as a single transcript (Figures 4A and 4B ) of about 4.5 kb in length, roughly in agreement with the size of the S2 cell-derived cDNA clone SD22390 (3.8 kb). This transcript was detected in S2 and mbn-2 cells (both cell lines derived from Drosophila blood cells), as well as in wandering larvae and adult flies. Transcript levels were low and showed only minor changes following immune challenge with bacteria (Figure 4A). mRNA was undetectable during most of the prepupal and pupal stages but appeared at the end of metamorphosis (Figure 4B). eater mRNA was not detected in nonhematopoietic larval tissues such as fat body, brain, and ring gland (Figure 4C) or larval and adult guts (Figure S4). In contrast to this, we detected eater expression in plasmatocytes/macrophages (Figures 4C, 4F, and 4G) and in all lobes of the larval hematopoietic organ (lymph glands), indicating that eater is expressed throughout larval hemocyte development (Figure 4D). eater expression appeared restricted to the plasmatocyte lineage, as we detected no hybridization signal in crystal cells and lamellocytes while sessile and circulating plasmatocytes were strongly positive (Figures 4F and 4G). These results were in good agreement with a genome-wide microarray analysis of Drosophila blood cells (Irving et al., 2005Irving P. Ubeda J.M. Doucet D. Troxler L. Lagueux M. Zachary D. Hoffmann J.A. Hetru C. Meister M. New insights into Drosophila larval haemocyte functions through genome-wide analysis.Cell. Microbiol. 2005; 7: 335-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). eater signals were specific, since no hybridization signal was seen in transheterozygous animals carrying an overlapping deletion of 16 kb which removes the eater gene (Figure 4E; see also below). Interestingly, eater was not expressed in embryonic macrophages (Figure 4H; data for later embryonic stages not shown), in contrast to croquemort (Figure 4I), an established marker for these cells (Franc et al., 1999Franc N.C. Heitzler P. Ezekowitz R.A. White K. Requirement for croquemort in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in Drosophila.Science. 1999; 284: 1991-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, Waltzer et al., 2002Waltzer L. Bataille L.

Two isoforms of Serpent containing either one or two GATA zinc fingers have different roles in Drosophila haematopoiesis.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5477-5486Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Our expression analysis suggested that the eater gene is expressed in a blood cell-restricted fashion, in undifferentiated larval prohemocytes as well as in fully differentiated macrophages. To address whether Eater plays a role in phagocytosis in vivo, we generated eater null flies. We identified two deficiencies with breakpoints closely upstream (Df(3R)Tl-I) or downstream (Df(3R)D605) of the eater gene and used them to generate transheterozygous flies. Df(3R)D605/Df(3R)Tl-I flies carry an overlapping deletion of 16 kb which includes the eater gene (see Figure S5A). These eater null flies were adult viable and fertile, thus permitting functional analysis of their blood cells. We used hemocytes from late wandering third instar larvae and a previously established microscopic phagocytosis assay (Pearson et al., 2003Pearson A.M. Baksa K. Rämet M. Protas M. McKee M. Brown D. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Identification of cytoskeletal regulatory proteins required for efficient phagocytosis in Drosophila.Microbes Infect. 2003; 5: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) to assess phagocytosis in primary eater null cells. eater null hemocytes were strongly impaired for phagocytosis of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (Figures 5A and 5B ; data not shown for E. coli). The percentage of phagocytosing cells was strongly reduced in all cases, suggesting that eater null hemocytes have a reduced ability to bind bacteria. In contrast to this, we found that eater null cells could efficiently clear a phagocytic challenge of india ink carbon particles from the hemolymph of third instar larvae and displayed the typical morphology of actively phagocytosing cells (Figure 5C). Although 5- to 10-fold elevated hemocyte numbers could be obtained from eater null animals and eater null hemocytes seemed to adhere less tightly to the larval cuticle in vivo (Figure 5C), ex vivo these cells had—under the conditions tested—no detectable spreading or adherence defects and appeared similar to wild-type controls with respect to their endocytic activity (Figures S6A and S6B). Taken together, these results indicate that the loss of eater expression in hemocytes does not impair basic hemocyte functions such as endocytosis, adherence, spreading, and the phagocytosis of india ink particles, while it strongly affects the efficiency of bacterial phagocytosis. This conclusion was confirmed by measuring phagocytosis in adult flies in vivo (Elrod-Erickson et al., 2000Elrod-Erickson M. Mishra S. Schneider D.

Biol. 2000; 10: 781-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, Moita et al., 2005Moita L.F. Wang-Sattler R. Michel K. Zimmermann T. Blandin S. Levashina E.A. Kafatos F.C.

The phagocytosis signal arising from a population of sessile hemocytes around the dorsal vessel (the heart equivalent of flies; Figure 6A ) was quantified by digital imaging (Figure 6C). In vivo phagocytosis of bacteria was temperature dependent and could be blocked by prior injection of latex beads, a treatment which ablates phagocyte function (Elrod-Erickson et al., 2000Elrod-Erickson M. Mishra S. Schneider D. Interactions between the cellular and humoral immune responses in Drosophila.Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 781-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In eater null flies, in vivo phagocytosis of gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus) was strongly impaired when compared to wild-type or heterozygous controls (Figure 6C). A similar, albeit somewhat less-pronounced effect was observed with gram-negative bacteria (E. coli; Figure 6C). (S. marcescens could not be analyzed in this assay showing a different signal distribution which was not temperature dependent.) Phagocytic cells were present in high numbers around the dorsal vessel of eater null flies as shown by injection of phagocyte-specific, fluorescent PKH26-PCL dye aggregates (Horan et al., 1990Horan P.K. Melnicoff M.J. Jensen B.D. Slezak S.E. Fluorescent cell labeling for in vivo and in vitro cell tracking.Methods Cell Biol. 1990; 33: 469-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar; Figure 6B and data not shown; quantification showed a 3-fold increase in signal compared to wild-type [p = 0.03]) or by injection of india ink into eater null flies that had been crossed to the yellow background (data not shown). In vivo phagocytosis could be rescued in eater null flies by the expression of an eater transgene under the control of a hemocyte driver (hml-Gal4; Figure S7), indicating that solely the lack of the eater gene is responsible for the observed phagocytosis defect. This conclusion was supported by RNAi knockdown in S2 cells of the other genes in the overlapping deficiency which failed to show any effect on phagocytosis and when combined with eater RNAi did not further decrease phagocytosis (Figure S5B). The finding that phagocytosis is impaired in adult eater null animals in vivo suggested that eater null flies can be used to address the role of phagocytosis during infection. A systemic humoral immune response, as monitored by Drosomycin and Diptericin antibacterial peptide gene expression, was induced normally in eater null mutants, indicating that Eater plays no role in humoral immunity and is not required for signaling in the Toll or IMD pathways (Figure S1B). In order to address the role of Eater"

Inactivation of AAA proteases causes pleiotropic phenotypes in various organisms, including respiratory deficiencies, mitochondrial morphology defects, and axonal degeneration in hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). The molecular basis of these defects, however, remained unclear. Here, we describe a regulatory role of an AAA protease for mitochondrial protein synthesis in yeast. The mitochondrial ribosomal protein MrpL32 is processed by the m-AAA protease, allowing its association with preassembled ribosomal particles and completion of ribosome assembly in close proximity to the inner membrane. Maturation of MrpL32 and mitochondrial protein synthesis are also impaired in a HSP mouse model lacking the m-AAA protease subunit paraplegin, demonstrating functional conservation. Our findings therefore rationalize mitochondrial defects associated with m-AAA protease mutants in yeast and shed new light on the mechanism of axonal degeneration in HSP."

https://openalex.org/W2064019043,"The coordinated regulation of gene expression is required for homeostasis, growth and development in all organisms. Such coordination may be partly achieved at the level of messenger RNA stability1, in which the targeted destruction of subsets of transcripts generates the potential for cross-regulating metabolic pathways. In Escherichia coli, the balance and composition of the transcript population is affected by RNase E, an essential endoribonuclease that not only turns over RNA but also processes certain key RNA precursors2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. RNase E cleaves RNA internally, but its catalytic power is determined by the 5′ terminus of the substrate, even if this lies at a distance from the cutting site11,12,13,14. Here we report crystal structures of the catalytic domain of RNase E as trapped allosteric intermediates with RNA substrates. Four subunits of RNase E catalytic domain associate into an interwoven quaternary structure, explaining why the subunit organization is required for catalytic activity. The subdomain encompassing the active site is structurally congruent to a deoxyribonuclease, making an unexpected link in the evolutionary history of RNA and DNA nucleases. The structure explains how the recognition of the 5′ terminus of the substrate may trigger catalysis and also sheds light on the question of how RNase E might selectively process, rather than destroy, specific RNA precursors."
https://openalex.org/W2033522367,"Rhythmic cardiac contractions depend on the organized propagation of depolarizing and repolarizing wavefronts. Repolarization is spatially heterogeneous and depends largely on gradients of potassium currents. Gradient disruption in heart disease may underlie susceptibility to fatal arrhythmias, but it is not known how this gradient is established. We show that, in mice lacking the homeodomain transcription factor Irx5, the cardiac repolarization gradient is abolished due to increased Kv4.2 potassium-channel expression in endocardial myocardium, resulting in a selective increase of the major cardiac repolarization current, I(to,f), and increased susceptibility to arrhythmias. Myocardial Irx5 is expressed in a gradient opposite that of Kv4.2, and Irx5 represses Kv4.2 expression by recruiting mBop, a cardiac transcriptional repressor. Thus, an Irx5 repressor gradient negatively regulates potassium-channel-gene expression in the heart, forming an inverse I(to,f) gradient that ensures coordinated cardiac repolarization while also preventing arrhythmias."

We have now compared the patterns of vulnerability and rescue of Caenorhabditis elegans with genetic modifications of three different genetic factors implicated in Parkinson disease (PD). We observed that expressing α-synuclein, deleting parkin (K08E3.7), or knocking down DJ-1 (B0432.2) or parkin produces similar patterns of pharmacological vulnerability and rescue. C. elegans lines with these genetic changes were more vulnerable than nontransgenic nematodes to mitochondrial complex I inhibitors, including rotenone, fenperoximate, pyridaben, or stigmatellin. In contrast, the genetic manipulations did not increase sensitivity to paraquat, sodium azide, divalent metal ions (Fe(II) or Cu(II)), or etoposide compared with the nontransgenic nematodes. Each of the PD-related lines was also partially rescued by the antioxidant probucol, the mitochondrial complex II activator, d-β-hydroxybutyrate, or the anti-apoptotic bile acid tauroursodeoxycholic acid. Complete protection in all lines was achieved by combining d-β-hydroxybutyrate with tauroursodeoxycholic acid but not with probucol.

The varied functions of these proteins obscures any potential convergent pathways that might underlie the pathophysiology of Parkinson disease. In this study, we demonstrate that genetic modulation of α-synuclein, parkin, and DJ-1 all disrupt mitochondrial function in C. elegans. We also describe pharmacologic treatments that protect the mutant C. elegans strains against toxicity caused by the genetic mutations that support the mitochondrial convergence of the genetic pathways. These results point to disruption of mitochondrial function as a general cause of most, if not all, cases of PD. Generation of the α-Synuclein Transgenic Lines—Human wild type α-synuclein cDNA was inserted into the vector pPD95.75 downstream of a synaptobrevin promoter and expressed in Bristol N2 non-tg lines by co-injecting with a pDPSU006-GFP vector to produce extrachromosomal arrays. The pDPSU006-GFP vector was used as a marker for gene transmission. The A53T α-synuclein expression is driven by an unc-119 neuronal promoter. GFP driven by the dopamine transporter promoter was used as a marker to identify those nematodes expressing the extrachromosomal array. Expression of β-synuclein expression was also driven by an unc-119 neuronal promoter. Transgenes were integrated by exposing animals to 1,800 rads of γ-irradiation, and animals were out-crossed five times. Detection of the Wild Type and A53T α-Synuclein Transgene—PCR was performed to detect the transgene by using the following primers to detect the transgene: sense primer 5′-ATTAATTCATAGCC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CTGGGAGCAAAGATA-3′ (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA).

PCR with the primers listed below was used to verify a K08E3.7 deletion within the mutagenized animals. Animals verified as K08E3.7 knockouts were outcrossed five times to the wild type strain to produce a clean genetic background. The K08E3.7 knockout is a deletion of 1132 bp whose limits are GGACATTTCAAACTTTGAAT... AAAATAACTTCAGGAGTGGT. The following primers were used to detect the deletion: sense primer 5′-ATACAAGATAGAAAAACAGGTC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-GCAAAACGAAAAAAAACA-3′ (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA).

Three NGM plates (2.5 g of bactopeptone (BD Biosciences), 3 g of NaCl, 20 g of agar, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 5 mg of cholesterol, 25 mm KH2PO4 (Sigma), 1 liter of double distilled H2O) seeded with OP50-1 Escherichia coli) were seeded with 40 nematodes each and were monitored throughout the life cycle for each strain. Culturing of Nematodes and Isolation of Nematode Lysates—The Bristol N2 non-tg strain was used as the wild type strain. Growth and culture of nematodes were performed using standard techniques (34Wood W.B. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar, 35Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously described methods were used for isolation. Mixed stage nematode lysates were prepared as described previously, except that the isolated pellet of nematodes was further washed with 5 ml of cold 1× PBS + protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), spun down, and sonicated for lysis (36Slice L.W. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 256-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis—Protein concentration of nematode lysates was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). 30 μg of protein were used for immunoblot assays. 2× dithiothreitol protein loading buffer was added to each sample. The samples were then heated for 5 min at 90 °C and run on 8–16% SDS gradient polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Whittaker, Walkersville, MD). Proteins on the polyacrylamide gels were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Bio-Rad) overnight at 4 °C at 0.1 A/gel in transfer buffer. The immunoblot was blocked in 5% milk in 100 mm Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and shaken for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in primary antibody at the appropriate concentration in 5% bovine serum albumin in TBST. The blots were washed three times, 10 min each, and incubated for 3 h in secondary antibody (1:5000) (The Jackson Laboratory, West Grove, PA) in 5% milk in TBST at room temperature. Blots were washed three times and developed using a chemiluminescent reaction (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The primary antibodies used were monoclonal anti-α-synuclein antibody (1:1000) (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and monoclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody (1:1000) (Zymed Laboratories Inc.); secondary antibody was donkey anti-mouse (1:5000) (The Jackson Laboratory). Resulting bands were analyzed using Image J (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). Oxyblot Analysis—Protein lysates (20 μg) were derivatized with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine at room temperature (25 °C) for 20 min, neutralized, and then immunoblotted as described above. Peroxidase coupled anti-2,4-dinitrophenol antibody diluted 1:150 was used for immunoblotting as per the manufacturer's directions (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Chemical Treatments—For chemical treatments, 35-mm plates were poured with the indicated concentrations of chemicals, as described under “Results” diluted in NGM agar. The plates were seeded with bacteria medium containing rotenone, paraquat etoposide, or metal. 40 synchronized L4 nematodes of the appropriate strain were placed on each plate. Three plates were analyzed for each point; each experiment was repeated 3–6 times. Every other day the surviving nematodes were transferred onto a new plate with the same concentrations of rotenone, paraquat, etoposide, or metal. The number of surviving nematodes was counted on days 2 and 4. The number of live nematodes was determined by counting nematodes that were either moving or those that responded to light touch with a platinum wire. Toxicity was measured as a function of percent survival of the nematodes following treatment. Treatment with Small Interfering RNA; Generation of the B0432.2 Knockdown—E. coli containing a B0432.2 genomic fragment cloned into L4440 was used to generate the C. elegans knockdown (37Fraser A.G. Kamath R.S. Zipperlen P. Martinez-Campos M. Sohrmann M. Ahringer J. Nature. 2000; 408: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). The bacteria was grown for 12 h in LB + 50 μg/ml ampicillin (Sigma). This culture was seeded onto NGM plates containing 25 μg/ml carbenicillin (Sigma) and 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Research Products International Corp., Mt. Prospect, IL). B0432.2 RNAi was induced overnight at room temperature. The L3-L4 hermaphrodites were transferred onto the NGM plates. These nematodes were grown for 72 h at 15 °C for the RNAi to take effect. Single adults were then plated onto new individual NGM plates with additives and RNAi containing bacteria. The progeny of these adults was used in subsequent assays. Quantification of Knockdown—N2 worms were grown from hatching on HT115(DE3) bacteria containing L4440 B0432.2 (DJ-1) plasmid for knockout; worms were grown on freshly prepared bacterial plates containing 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thio-galactopyranoside for induction of B0432.2. For quantification of B0432.2 (DJ-1) RNA, adult worms (6 days old) were transferred to micro-tubes with 30 ml of PBS. Single worms were placed in tubes and dissolved in 300 ml of TRIzol (Invitrogen), and 12 mg of linear polyacrylamide (GenElute LPA, Sigma) was added to it as a carrier for RNA extraction. Aqueous phase with RNA was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol and washed once with 70% ethanol. The RNA pellet was dried at room temperature and dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. The extracted RNA was immediately reverse-transcribed with a 3′ DJ-1 primer (TGC CAC TGA CAA CAA CACGA) for 1 h at 50°C. The reverse-transcribed products were PCR-analyzed with a Bio-Rad real time PCR. A 5′ primer (CAA GTC ATC CAA GTG TTA AGG AGA AA) and a Taqman probe (TCG AGA AAG GAG GCT ACA AGT ACT CGG AGG) were added to the PCR mixture to monitor the threshold cycles for DJ-1 amplifications. PCR products were analyzed with a 3% agarose gel electrophoresis. Band intensities were measured by Labworks software (UVP Inc.) DNA sequencing was also performed to confirm the identity of the amplified band. Thioflavine S Histochemistry—Worms were treated with 25 μm rotenone for 2 days, harvested with M9 media, and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C. After being washed three times with PBS buffer, the worms were incubated in a shaker at 37 °C with TMT solution (1% Triton X-100, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 125 mm Tris, pH 7.6) for 3 h. The worms were then washed two times with a solution containing 100 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm CaCl2 and were incubated in the same solution with 2 mg/ml collagenase for another 3 h at 37 °C with vigorous agitation. After washing three times with PBS buffer, animals were put on a poly-d-lysine-coated slide in a 30-μl volume and covered with a coverslip. The slides were kept at –80 °C overnight. Coverslips were removed quickly at –80 °C, and the slides were gradually hydrated with graded frozen methanol (100–70%) followed by a 10-min wash with water. The slides were then incubated with 0.015% thioflavine S for 10 min and washed three times in 80% ethanol for 5 min. The slides were washed once with double distilled H2O. After 10 min of drying at room temperature, the slides were mounted with glass coverslips with thin layer of Fluoromount-G (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA). Dot Blot Analysis—The non-tg and A53T α-synuclein strains treated with rotenone were analyzed via dot blot for α-synuclein aggregation. Samples were vacuumed through a dot blot apparatus onto cellulose acetate membrane. Recombinant aggregated α-synuclein was used as a positive control. The cellulose acetate membrane was blocked and probed with the Syn303 antibody (1:500) (38Giasson B.I. Duda J.E. Murray I.V. Chen Q. Souza J.M. Hurtig H.I. Ischiropoulos H. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Science. 2000; 290: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar) as described previously under “Immunoblot Analysis.” Oxygen Consumption—5000 stage-synchronized adult worms were grown on large plates, collected in S-basal buffer, and washed free of bacteria. Changes in oxygen concentration of the worms was performed in 1 ml of S-basal buffer containing heat-killed E. coli in a closed chamber cuvette mixed with a mini-stirring bar, maintained at 22 °C, and using a Clark-type electrode (Hansatech Instruments Ltd., Norfolk, UK). The worms were incubated in the chamber 5 min before measurement, and then oxygen consumption was measured for usually 1–3 min. The slope of the straight portion of the plot was used to derive the oxygen consumption rate. After the measurement, the worms were collected for protein quantification. Oxygen consumption rate for each population was normalized to its protein content. Preparation of Mitochondria—The methods used were those described by Kayser et al. (39Kayser E.B. Morgan P.G. Sedensky M.M. Anesthesiology. 2004; 101: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Two grams of worms cleaned of E. coli were suspended in MSM-E buffer (220 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mm MOPS, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). The worms were ruptured with a Polytron, and then proteinase type XXVII (5 mg/g worms, Sigma) was added and incubated for 10 min. Next the slurry was homogenized in a Dounce. The slurry was mixed in 1 volume of MSM-E buffer containing 0.4% bovine serum albumin, and the homogenate was centrifuged (300 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in MSM-E and washed twice by centrifugation (7000 × g, 10 min, 4°C). The final pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of MSM-E, and total protein was determined by BCA assay. NADH-CoQ Reductase Assay—The assay was performed as described by Kramer et al. (40Kramer K.A. Oglesbee D. Hartman S.J. Huey J. Anderson B. Magera M.J. Matern D. Rinaldo P. Robinson B.H. Cameron J.M. Hahn S.H. Clin. Chem. 2005; 51: 2110-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were mixed in freshly prepared assay buffer (0.25 mm potassium EDTA, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm KCN, 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 100 μm NADH at 30 °C). After 3 min of preincubation, 0.02 mm decylubiquinone was added for the measurement of complex I–III. All assays contained potassium cyanide to inhibit complex IV (1.0 mm final concentration). Upon addition of substrate, samples were placed in a spectrophotometer (Beckman), and oxidation of NADH was measured at 340 nm for 15 min at 30 °C. Rates of oxidation were calculated according to Equation 1,(ΔA/min)(dilutionfactor)(1/ϵ)(1/1cm)·(1000μg/mg)/(μg/μLprotein)=enzymeactivity/mgprotein(Eq. 1) where ΔA/min is the change in absorbance; 1 cm is the cuvette path length, and ϵ = 6.81 is the extinction coefficient (in mm/liter cm). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis on the raw numbers was done using an unpaired t test or analysis of variance followed by a Newman Keuls post-hoc analysis (Statview), when necessary. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Characterization of the Wild Type and A53T α-Synuclein Nematodes—The presence of wild type or A53T α-synuclein in the C. elegans transgenic lines was demonstrated by PCR and immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1, A–C). PCR of the transgenic C. elegans genomes yielded 450-bp bands that corresponded to full-length wild type and A53T α-synuclein cDNA (Fig. 1A, 1st and 2nd lanes). The plasmid used to generate the wild type α-synuclein transgenic lines was used as a control to verify the size of α-synuclein (Fig. 1A, 4th lane). No α-synuclein was detected through PCR analysis in the Bristol N2 nontransgenic (non-tg) strain, which is consistent with the absence of a homologue for α-synuclein in the C. elegans genome (Fig. 1A, 3rd lane). The presence of α-synuclein was validated by immunoprecipitating α-synuclein from the A53T α-synuclein transgenic or Bristol N2 non-tg lines. A 14-kDa band, characteristic of α-synuclein, was evident only in the A53T lines; no such band was present in the N2 line or in A53T α-synuclein lysates precipitated with preimmune serum (Fig. 1B). Characterization of the K08E3.7 Knockout—Human parkin shows high homology to the KO8E3.7 gene in C. elegans (Fig. 1D). Based on this homology, we searched for a strain of nematodes lacking KO8E3.7. Generation of the K08E3.7 knock-out nematodes (K08E3.7 KO) was demonstrated by PCR based on the expected region deleted (Fig. 1, C and E). An 1131-bp region, including exons 1–4 of the K08E3.7 gene, was deleted to yield a nonfunctional form of K08E3.7 (Fig. 1C). The non-tg nematodes yield a 1.37-kb band that corresponds to full-length K08E3.7 (Fig. 1C, 1 lane). Knockout of K08E3.7 yields a 0.26-kb band (Fig. 1C, lane 2). The life spans of the C. elegans strains were examined as a simple test to determine whether expression of α-synuclein or lack of K08E3.7 affects the metabolism of the nematodes, as is seen for loss of the parkin homologue in Drosophila (58Greene J.C. Whitworth A.J. Kuo I. Andrews L.A. Feany M.B. Pallanck L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4078-4083Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). The mean life span was similar among the non-tg, wild type, and A53T α-synuclein-expressing strains; however, the K08E3.7 KO strain had a 15.4% shorter life span that the non-tg strain (Fig. 2A). The mean survival for the non-tg strain was 18.5 ± 0.169 days, whereas that for the K08E3.7 KO strains was 15.65 ± 0.211 days, p < 0.01 (Fig. 2A). The transgenic and nontransgenic C. elegans strains were also examined visually at multiple life stages from larval development through adulthood. No defects were observed in any transgenic strains through development and into adulthood. KO8E3.7/Parkin KO Reduces Ubiquitination in C. elegans—The K08E3.7 KO and non-tg nematodes were examined to explore the function of K08E3.7 in the nematode. The results show that the K08E3.7 KO strain exhibits reduced levels of basal ubiquitination (Fig. 2, B–D). Basal ubiquitination in the K08E3.7 KO strain was 55 ± 6.5% (p < 0.01) than of the non-tg strain (Fig. 2D); in comparison, basal ubiquitination was unchanged in the A53T α-synuclein line (data not shown). The reduction in high molecular weight ubiquitinated proteins in the K08E3.7 KO worm strain contrasts with results reported for parkin knock-out mice (41G"

EphA2 is expressed in various cancer tissues and cell lines. Although the mechanism of action of EphA2 is unknown, its expression correlates with progression of the malignant phenotype of cancerous tissues. Here, we have shown that EphA2 modulates the localization and function of claudin-4, a constituent of tight junctions. EphA2 associates with claudin-4 via their extracellular domains. This association, in turn, leads to phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of claudin-4 at Tyr-208. The tyrosine phosphorylation of claudin-4 attenuates association of claudin-4 with ZO-1, decreasing integration of claudin-4 into sites of cell-cell contact and enhancing paracellular permeability. These results indicate that EphA2 moderates the function of tight junctions via phosphorylation of claudin-4.

The members of the Eph receptor family can be classified into two groups based on their sequence similarity and their preferential binding to ligands tethered to the cell surface by a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol anchor (ephrin-A) or by a transmembrane domain (ephrin-B) (1Blits-Huizinga C.

In epithelial cells, cell-cell adhesion appears to be closely connected with the function of Eph receptors. For example, E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is required for EphA2 localization at cell contacts, and the loss of E-cadherin decreases the phosphotyrosine content of EphA2 (16Orsulic S.

Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 629-638PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, disrupting signaling through some of the Eph receptors and ephrins leads to impaired cell-cell adhesion in early stage Xenopus embryos (18Jones T.L. Chong L.D. Kim J. Xu R.H. Kung H.F.

Tight junctions locate at the most apical part of lateral membranes and serve as a paracellular barrier to restrict the movement of molecules, including ions and proteins, across cell boundaries. Claudins, a family of tetraspan transmembrane proteins containing more than 20 members, are a major constituent of tight junctions (20Morita K. Furuse M. Fujimoto K. Tsukita S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

During the screening of cross-talk between Eph-ephrin family molecules and intercellular adhesion molecules, we found that EphA2 makes a complex with claudin-4, which led us to investigate whether claudin-4 is a biochemical target of EphA2. In this study, we have described the biological interaction of EphA2 with claudin-4. Upon cell-cell contact, a tyrosine residue located in the carboxyl-terminal region of claudin-4 was phosphorylated by activated EphA2. This phosphorylation event lead to reduced association of claudin-4 with ZO-1 and decreased integration of claudin-4 into sites of cell-cell contact. Analysis of paracellular flux indicated that activation of EphA2 delayed assembly of tight junctions in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) 2The abbreviations used are: MDCKMadin-Darby canine kidneyGSTglutathione S-transferaseECDextracellular domainGFPgreen fluorescent proteinFITCfluorescein isothiocyanate.2The abbreviations used are: MDCKMadin-Darby canine kidneyGSTglutathione S-transferaseECDextracellular domainGFPgreen fluorescent proteinFITCfluorescein isothiocyanate. cells, and this depended on EphA2 kinase activity. These results show that, by regulating the localization and function of claudin-4, EphA2 moderates tight junction permeability.

Plasmids and Antibodies—Plasmids encoding full-length human EphA2 and a mutant EphA2K646M were previously described (28Wang Y. Ota S. Kataoka H. Kanamori M. Li Z. Band H. Tanaka M. Sugimura H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The Fc fusion protein expression constructs EphA2, ephrin-A1, EphB2, and ephrin-B1 were constructed using PCR-generated amplicons of the entire extracellular domain of each protein as previously described (28Wang Y.

Shinmura K. Kamo T. Sakai R. Sugimura H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1075-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Mutants of EphA2, lacking either the cytoplasmic domain (EphA2-(1-563)) or the extracellular domain (EphA2-(541-977)) were constructed by tagging PCR-generated amplicons with GFP at the carboxyl or amino terminus, respectively. The plasmids encoding claudin-4 and N-ZO-1 (amino acids 1-862) were donated by S. Tsukita. Mutants of claudin-4 (Y193F, Y197F, Y208F, Y193/197F, and Y193/197/208F) and EphA2 (I94N) were generated using the Altered Sites mutagenesis system (Promega). The truncated mutants of claudin-4 shown in Fig. 2a were constructed by cloning PCR-generated amplicons into pEBB with the addition of the FLAG epitope tag at the carboxyl terminus. The antibodies for the FLAG (M2) and hemagglutinin (Y-11) tags were obtained from Sigma and Santa Cruz, respectively. The monoclonal antibodies for EphA2 and phosphotyrosine (4G10) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. The antibodies for claudin-4 and ZO-1 were purchased from ZyMed. Anti-GFP was from NacalaiTesque. Alexa Fluor-labeled secondary antibodies of anti-goat IgG, anti-rabbit IgG, and anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Molecular Probes. Fusion proteins of Eph and ephrin with the Fc region of immunoglobulin were purified by passing the culture medium of COS1 cells transfected with plasmids encoding the Fc fusion proteins through a protein A-Sepharose column as previously described (29Tanaka M. Ohashi R. Nakamura R. Shinmura K. Kamo T. Sakai R. Sugimura H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1075-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—HT29 colon carcinoma cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. MDCK cells and COS1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. For transient expression assays, COS1 cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). Generation of Adenoviruses and Adenoviral Infection—To generate recombinant adenoviruses, cDNAs encoding wild type, the K646M mutant of EphA2, or EphA2-(1-563)-GFP were subcloned into the vector pShuttle-CMV (Stratagene). They were transformed into an Escherichia coli strain containing the Ad5-based adenovirus vector pADEasy-1 (Stratagene). Transposition of the EphA2 cDNAs from the pShuttle-CMV into pADEasy-1 created the adenoviral vectors pAD-EphA2 (wild type, K646M, and EphA2-(1-563)-GFP) where the transgenes were under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Recombinant adenoviral DNA was transfected into 293 human embryonic kidney cells to allow production of adenoviral particles. The titer of adenovirus stocks was determined by Adeno-X rapid titer kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Confluent MDCK cells grown on Transwell filters or glass coverslips were infected with adenoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 5 in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After incubation for 12 h the virus-containing medium was removed and fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added. The infected cells were used for permeability assays or immunostaining 48 h after the infection. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Transfected cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and cell lysates were prepared with protease inhibitors in PLC buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1% Triton X-100). The lysates were precleared by incubation with protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 4°C. To purify target proteins, 1 μg of monoclonal or affinity-purified polyclonal antibody was incubated with 500 μg of precleared cell lysate for 2 h at 4°C and then precipitated with protein G-agarose for 1 h at 4°C. Immunoprecipitates were extensively washed with PLC buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to immunoblotting. After blocking, blots were incubated with appropriate primary antibodies. Blots were then washed four times with TBST (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), and 0.05% Tween20), incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit whole IgG antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min, washed, and visualized by autoradiography using chemiluminescence reagent (Western Lighting; PerkinElmer). Cell Staining—Cells were fixed for 5 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized for 10 min with 0.2% Triton X-100. The cells were preincubated in 2% bovine serum albumin with 5% normal serum for 0.5 h and incubated with specific primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, cells were incubated with Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) for 0.5 h at room temperature. In some experiments, membrane-bound Fc fusion proteins were stained with Alexa488-conjugated anti-mouse IgGFc for 0.5 h. Photos were taken with a Radiance 2100 confocal microscope (Bio-Rad). In Vitro Binding Assay—The recombinant GST-tagged claudin-4 containing the second cytoplasmic domain was prepared in TKX1-competent cells (Stratagene) by transformation with pGEX4T claudin-4. Tyrosine-phosphorylated GST-claudin-4 was prepared by induction of a nonspecific tyrosine kinase in TKX1 cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST-tagged proteins (2.5 μg) were purified using glutathione-agarose. Each GST-tagged protein (2.5 μg) was incubated with lysate prepared from COS1 cells transfected with N-ZO-1 in PLC buffer for 4 h at 4°C. The beads were washed four times with the same buffer, and bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Precipitated N-ZO-1 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-ZO-1 antibody. Paracellular Permeability Assay—MDCK cells were seeded into the upper well of transwell chambers (0.4-μm pore size; Becton Dickinson Labware). After the cells reached confluence and established tight junctions, the medium of both the upper and lower wells was replaced with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 2 mm EGTA. The extent of cell-cell contact after treatment with EGTA was confirmed by microscopic observation. The medium was replaced from calcium-free to normal growth medium with 0.5% fetal bovine serum (calcium switch), and monolayers were allowed to recover for the indicated period. FITC-dextran (Mr 3,000 or 2,000) was added to the upper well at a concentration of 10 μg/ml and incubated for 30 min. Samples were then taken from the lower compartment of the transwell chamber. The amount of FITC-dextran in the lower wells was determined using Beacon 2000 (Takara) with an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and detection of emissions at 530 nm. Claudin Interacts with the Extracellular Domain of EphA2—Physical association between EphA2 and claudin-4 was first detected in COS1 cells transiently expressing both EphA2 and claudin-4. In these cells, EphA2 coprecipitated with claudin-4 immunoprecipitated with claudin-4-specific antibodies (Fig. 1a, left panel). Formation of an EphA2-claudin-4 complex was confirmed by immunoprecipitation using EphA2-specific antibodies (Fig. 1a, right panel). Endogenous EphA2 also coprecipitated with endogenous claudin-4 in extracts of the HT29 colon cancer cell line (Fig. 1b). Thus, endogenous EphA2 and claudin-4 physically interact in HT29 colon cancer cells. Stimulation of EphA2 with ephrin-A1-Fc induces formation of membrane patches through the clustering of receptors (30Palmer A. Zimmer M. Erdmann K.S. Eulenburg V. Porthin A. Heumann R. Deutsch U. Klein R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 725-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 31Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M.

Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 339-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We examined changes in the localization of claudin-4 after stimulation of EphA2 with ephrin-A1-Fc. For efficient binding of the Fc fusion protein to the receptors, cells were plated at low density. In unstimulated HT29 cells, claudin-4 is diffusely expressed both on the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1c, left row). Several minutes after exposure to ephrin-A1-Fc, claudin-4 redistributed as fine patches in the membrane that overlapped EphA2/ephrin-A1-Fc complexes (Fig. 1c, middle row). At 1 h after stimulation, partial colocalization of claudin-4 with EphA2/ephrin-A1-Fc was clearly observed as patchy complexes in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1c, right row). The dynamic colocalization of EphA2 and claudin-4 further indicates physiological association of these two molecules. Next, a series of mutants of claudin-4 were generated to determine the region required for interaction with EphA2 (Fig. 2a). Among the mutants of claudin-4, the one containing the amino-terminal region including the first extracellular domain (ECD) tightly bound to EphA2 (Fig. 2a). Next, several mutants of EphA2 were utilized to determine the region involved in the interaction with claudin-4 (Fig. 2b). The extracellular domain, but not the cytoplasmic domain of EphA2, associates with claudin-4 (Fig. 2b, left panel). The amino-terminal region of EphA2 (amino acids 28-206) binds to its ligand, ephrin-A1 (33Himanen J.P. Rajashankar K.R. Lackmann M. Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nikolov D.B. Nature. 2001; 414: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Claudin-4 binds to EphA2-(Δ207-540), which contains the core region necessary for the interaction with its cognate ligand, ephrin-A1 (Fig. 2b, right panel). On the other hand, a specific EphA2 mutation, I94N, which was incidentally found to impair binding with ephrin-A1 3M. Tanaka and R. Sakai, unpublished data. (Fig. 2c, left panel), did not significantly affect EphA2 binding to claudin-4 (Fig. 2c, right panel). These data demonstrated that ephrin-A1 and claudin-4 both bind to the amino-terminal region of EphA2 (amino acids 1-206), but in different manners. Claudin-4 Is Phosphorylated in the Cytoplasmic Tail upon Interaction with EphA2—EphA2 is known to exhibit ligand-independent activation by homophilic dimer formation when overexpressed in COS1 cells. Claudin-4 was clearly phosphorylated on tyrosine residue when coexpressed with wild type EphA2, but not when coexpressed with EphA2K646M, a kinase-inactive EphA2 mutant (Fig. 3a). Moreover, EphA2K646M blocked tyrosine phosphorylation of claudin-4 induced by wild type EphA2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3b). It was also observed that the claudin-4 mutant that lacks the EphA2-binding site (amino acids 81-209, claudin-4 ΔECD1) was not phosphorylated (Fig. 3c). These results indicate that association of EphA2 with claudin-4 and EphA2 kinase activity is required for phosphorylation of claudin-4. Claudin-4 has three tyrosine residues in the second (carboxyl-terminal) cytoplasmic domain, but there is no tyrosine in the first (amino-terminal) cytoplasmic domain. Among the three tyrosine residues in the second cytoplasmic domain, the one located at the carboxyl terminus is well conserved in most claudin families (22Itoh M. Furuse M. Morita K. Kubota K. Saitou M. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1351-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). EphA2-induced phosphorylation of claudin-4 was completely abolished when the tyrosine at the carboxyl terminus was replaced by phenylalanine (claudin-4Y208F), whereas substitution of other tyrosine residues did not affect the phosphorylation level of claudin-4 (Fig. 3d). It was next determined whether cell-cell contact stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of claudin-4 by physiological activation of EphA2. HT29 cells were used because they express the ephrin-A1 ligand, which can activate EphA2 upon cell-cell adhesion (34Potla L. Boghaert E.R. Armellino D. Frost P. Damle N.K. Cancer Lett. 2002; 175: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In HT29 cells, both EphA2 and claudin-4 were highly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues when the cells were plated at high density, whereas their phosphorylation level was very low when cell-cell interaction was disrupted by depletion of calcium in the medium (Fig. 4a). Treatment with nifedipine, a blocker of calcium channels, had no effect on the status of tyrosine phosphorylation of claudin-4 and EphA2 (data not shown), excluding the possibility that a decrease of intracellular calcium by EGTA affected the phosphorylation level of claudin. Treatment of HT29 cells with ephrin-A1-Fc enhanced phosphorylation of endogenous claudin-4 (Fig. 4b). Tyrosine phosphorylation of claudin-4 in HT29 cells was blocked by expression of EphA2-(1-563)-GFP, which does not contain the cytoplasmic region of EphA2 (Fig. 4c). These results suggest that claudin-4 is phosphorylated in HT29 cells when EphA2 is activated upon cell-cell interaction. EphA2, however, remained associated with claudin-4 after disruption of cell-cell adhesion (Fig. 4a), even after the cells were dispersed as a single cell suspension through prolonged incubation with the calcium-chelating agent (data not shown). Therefore, the majority of association between EphA2 and claudin-4 occurred on the cell membrane of the same cells in cis, rather than on two different cells in trans. Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Claudin-4 Attenuates Association with ZO-1—The carboxyl-terminal YV sequence of claudin associates with the PDZ domain of ZO-1 (22Itoh M. Furuse M. Morita K. Kubota K. Saitou M. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1351-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). We examined whether tyrosine phosphorylation of claudin-4 at the cytoplasmic tail affects interaction between claudin-4 and ZO-1. Non-phosphorylated and tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of recombinant GST-tagged claudin-4-(188-209), which contains the cytoplasmic tail, were purified using the TKX1 E. coli expression system (see “Experimental Procedures”). Non-phosphorylated claudin-4-(188-209) could effectively pull down the amino-terminal region of ZO-1 (N-ZO-1) expressed in COS1 cells. On the other hand, phosphorylated claudin-4 precipitated significantly lower amounts of N-ZO-1 (Fig. 5a, lanes 1 and 2). Because claudin-4-(188-209) contains three tyrosine residues (Fig. 3d), we also generated recombinant GST-claudin-4-(188-209)Y193/197F, in which two residual tyrosines were mutated, to confirm that phosphorylation of Tyr-208 of claudin-4 is responsible for attenuation of its binding ability with ZO-1. Non-phosphorylated wild type and the Y193/197F mutant of claudin-4-(188-209) equally coprecipitated ZO-1 (Fig. 5a, lanes 1 and 3), whereas phosphorylated claudin-4-(188-209)Y193/197F, in which only Tyr-208 was phosphorylated, did not effectively bind to ZO-1 (Fig. 5a, lane 4). Furthermore, neither claudin-4 lacking the carboxyl-terminal YV sequence nor GST alone bound to ZO-1 (Fig. 5a, lanes 5 and 6). Next, experiments were conducted to determine whether EphA2 activation leads to reduction of association between claudin-4 and ZO-1. The amount of claudin-4 coimmunoprecipitated with ZO-1 was reduced in EphA2-overexpressing COS1 cells (Fig. 5b). Association between claudin-4 and ZO-1 was also attenuated in MDCK cells expressing EphA2, and this association was further decreased by stimulation with ephrin-A1-Fc (Fig. 5c). From these results we conclude that EphA2 activation can reduce association of claudin-4 with ZO-1 by inducing phosphorylation of Tyr-208 of claudin-4 in vivo. To examine the biological significance of EphA2-mediated attenuation of the binding affinity between claudin-4 and ZO-1, the change in localization of claudin-4 was monitored during the dynamic process of reestablishment of cell-cell adhesion. Wild type or the kinase-inactive mutant of EphA2 was expressed at high levels by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer in MDCK cells, which express endogenous claudin-4. When the cells were initially treated with calcium-chelating agent, ZO-1 and claudin-4 localization to cell-cell contact sites was completely abolished (data not shown). 30 min after replacing the calcium-free medium with normal growth medium (calcium switch), ZO-1 was found to relocalize to the cell-cell contact sites regardless of the presence of kinase-active or kinase-inactive EphA2 (Fig. 5d). On the other hand, in cells expressing kinase-dead EphA2, claudin-4 also relocalizes to cell-cell contact sites 30 min after calcium switch, but in cells expressing kinase-active EphA2, claudin-4 did not relocalize to these sites (Fig. 5d). However, 3 h after calcium switch claudin-4 had relocalized to cell-cell contact sites in cells expressing kinase-active EphA2 (Fig. 5d). These results suggest that EphA2 causes a delay in reassembly of claudin-4 to tight junctions but has no effect on ZO-1. EphA2 Affects Paracellular Permeability of Normal Epithelial Cells Depending on Its Kinase Activity—To examine the biological effect of the interaction of EphA2 with claudin-4 on tight junctions, paracellular permeability was measured using low molecular size dextran in MDCK epithelial cells. The amount of the dextran flux through a monolayer of confluent MDCK cells was almost undetectable even when EphA2 was overexpressed (data not shown). Therefore, we decided to examine the effect of EphA2 on reestablishment of the paracellular barrier after calcium switch. Overexpression of EphA2 effectively inhibited the prompt decrease of paracellular permeability through an MDCK monolayer after calcium switch, and this delay was further enhanced when cells were stimulated by ephrin-A1-Fc (Fig. 6a). On the other hand, kinase-inactive EphA2 did not affect paracellular permeability (Fig. 6a), indicating that the kinase activity of EphA2 affects permeability. In this experiment, the phosphorylation level of claudin-4 3 h after calcium switch had decreased to approximately the same level as in the confluent untreated cells (Fig. 6b, compare lanes 2 and 4). The paracellular flux of large molecular sized dextran (Mr 2,000) was below detectable levels at all time points shown in Fig. 6a (data not shown), indicating no massive destruction of junctional complexes had occurred in our experiment. This is the first report showing tyrosine phosphorylation of claudin in relationship with its biological function. EphA2 induced the specific phosphorylation of Tyr-208 in the cytoplasmic tail of claudin-4 in COS1 cells, and endogenous claudin-4 was phosphorylated in response to EphA2 activation in HT29 cells. Both the kinase activity of EphA2 and association between EphA2 and claudin-4 are required for phosphorylation of claudin-4. Considering that EphA2 and claudin-4 associate on the same cell surface in cis, claudin-4 is most probably a direct substrate of EphA2. Our results indicate that activation of EphA2 by its ligand decreases integration of claudin-4 into tight junctions and enhances paracellular permeability. Tyrosine phosphorylation of claudin-4 in its carboxyl-terminal tail inhibits binding to ZO-1. It is also reported that phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal tail of occludin by c-Src also attenuated its association with ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3 in vitro (36Kale G. Naren A. Sheth P. Rao R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation within the PDZ domain-binding site is able to regulate protein-protein interaction. Our results suggest that activation of EphA2 affects integration of claudin-4 into the sites of cell-cell contacts after calcium switch, thereby attenuating the barrier function of tight junctions. Although the mechanism of assembly of claudins and ZO-1 into tight junctions is not fully understood, ZO-1, which is primarily localized to tight junctions (35Rothen-Rutishauser B. Riesen F.K. Braun A. Gunthert M. Wunderli-Allenspach H. J. Membr. Biol. 2002; 188: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), presumably fails to recruit phosphorylated claudin-4 due to loss of physical association. This conclusion is consistent with the finding that claudin-4, but not ZO-1, localization to cell contacts is decreased after activation of EphA2 (Fig. 5d). The EphA2-dependent increase of paracellular permeability was evident only during the dynamic process of tight junction reorganization triggered by calcium switch. On the other hand, expression of EphA2 did not effectively disrupt tight junctions, and junctional permeability and claudin-4 localization to cellular contacts were ultimately restored after calcium switch in MDCK cells even when claudin-4 was phosphorylated (Fig. 6b). These results suggest that phosphorylation of claudin-4 may affect the reassembly of tight junctions but not the maintenance of established tight junctions. One possibility is that the phosphorylation level of claudin-4 in confluent MDCK cells was relatively low and can be functionally compensated for by other members of the claudin family or by some other molecule. We are currently screening cell lines in which claudin-4 is highly phosphorylated at tight junctions to test this hypothesis. Because of limitations in the availability of specific antibodies, the specificity of association between each member of the Eph family and the claudin family is still uncertain. At least one other Eph family member, EphA4, is likely to be involved in this cross-talk, as claudin-4 was also tyrosine phosphorylated by coexpression with EphA4 in COS1 cells (data not shown). Also, the tyrosine residue located at the carboxyl terminus is conserved among at least 8 claudin family members, claudin-1-8. Therefore, other claudins also have the potential to be phosphorylated by Eph receptors. We are currently testing this hypothesis. In tumors overexpressing EphA2, assembly of tight junctions may be negatively regulated via phosphorylation of claudin. This has the potential to affect the malignant phenotype of the carcinoma, such as loss of cell polarity. Moreover, in tumors overexpressing both EphA2 and claudin-4, like HT29 colon cancer cells, phosphorylation of claudin-4 might transduce signals distinct from tight junction function. We are currently attempting to identify other downstream targets of signaling through tyrosine phosphorylation of claudin-4 and determine their roles in the regulation of epithelial cells and cancer cells.

G2A is also expressed in macrophages within atherosclerotic lesions, suggesting G2A involvement in atherosclerosis. Recently, G2A was discovered to possess proton-sensing ability. In this paper, we report another function of G2A, that is, as a receptor for 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (9-HODE) and other oxidized free fatty acids.

Furthermore, G2A was activated by various oxidized derivatives of linoleic and arachidonic acids, but it was weakly activated by cholesteryl-9-HODE. Oxidized phosphatidylcholine (1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl) when hydrolyzed with phospholipase A2 also evoked intracellular calcium mobilization in G2A-expressing cells. These results indicate that G2A is activated by oxidized free fatty acids produced by oxidation and subsequent hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine or cholesteryl linoleate.

By using G2A-expressing cells, they demonstrated that radiolabeled LPC and SPC specifically bound to cell membranes, and that LPC and SPC induced intracellular signaling such as a transient [Ca2+]i increase and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) activation. Furthermore, in their subsequent papers, they showed T cell (5Radu C.G. Yang L.V. Riedinger M. Au M. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, Radu et al. (16Radu C.G. Nijagal A. McLaughlin J. Wang L. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1632-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) reported more recently that G2A is less sensitive to pH fluctuations than the other three receptors in terms of IP and cAMP accumulation. By using receptor-deficient mice, they showed that TDAG8, but not G2A, is required for acidic pH-induced cAMP accumulation in splenocytes, although both the receptors are coexpressed in the cells (16Radu C.G. Nijagal A. McLaughlin J. Wang L. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1632-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Thus, G2A might have another function in immune cells that has not yet been identified. During the course of a de-orphaning project of some orphan GPCRs, we found that G2A expressed in mammalian cells responded to some oxidized free fatty acids, such as 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE). 9-HODE is an oxidized derivative of linoleic acid and one of the major lipid components of oxidized low-density lipoproteins (LDLs). In this report, we demonstrate that 9-HODE causes G2A activation resulting in intracellular calcium mobilization, [35S]GTPγS binding, inhibition of cAMP formation, and MAP kinase activation. 9-HODE in its free fatty acid form, but not in the form incorporated in phosphatidylcholine (PC) or cholesteryl ester, is effective in activating G2A. Based on the expression of G2A in lymphocytes, macrophages, and atherosclerotic plaques, our results suggest the newly identified aspects of G2A that might be involved in atherosclerosis and other oxidative pathological conditions. Materials—Various HODE, hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (HPODE), and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) species, and cholesteryl-9-HODE were purchased from Cayman Chemical. Linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, LPC (1-palmitoyl), and PC (1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl) were from Sigma. Pertussis toxin (PTX) was from Calbiochem. [35S]GTPγS was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Synthesis of 9(S)-HODE—Potato 5-lipoxygenase that functions as 9-lipoxygenase of linoleic acid was purified from potato tubers according to the method described by Shimizu et al. (17Shimizu T. Radmark O. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Linoleic acid was incubated with potato 5-lipoxygenase in a reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid), followed by reduction with NaBH4. The reaction products were separated from nonreacted substrates by silica column chromatography and analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The purified reaction products mainly consisted of 9-HODE (purity >95%) and trace amounts of 13-HODE (data not shown). Plasmid Constructions—An additional sequence of the FLAG epitope tag was inserted between the amino-terminal initiator methionine and the second amino acid of human G2A (NCBI accession number AF083955) by PCR using Pyrobest (Takara) and oligonucleotides (sense primer containing BamHI and FLAG tag sequences, 5′-CGGGATCCACCATGGATTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGTGCCCAATGCTACTGAAAAAC-3′; antisense primer containing EcoRI sequence, 5′-GGAATTCTCAGCAGGACTCCTCAATC-3′), and then subcloned into mammalian expression vector pCXN2.1, which is a slightly modified version of pCXN2 (18Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4597) Google Scholar) with multiple cloning sites. This construct was designated as pCXN2.1-G2A. A DNA sequence containing the entire open reading frame of Gαqi was subcloned into a pcDNA3.1/Zeo vector (Invitrogen). Gαqi protein is a chimeric protein in which 9 carboxyl-terminal peptides of murine Gαq protein (NCBI accession number M55412) were replaced with corresponding residues of murine Gαi protein (NCBI accession number M13963). The sequence of each construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing using a LIC-4200L DNA sequencing system (Aloka). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Flow Cytometry—Chinese hamster ovary K1 (CHO-K1) and human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium (Sigma) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma), respectively, containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with plasmid DNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To observe the expression of FLAG-tagged G2A proteins on cell surfaces, cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml M5 anti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) without cell permeabilization, followed by staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for 30 min at room temperature and analysis using an EPICS XL flow cytometer system (Beckman Coulter). Stable Expression of G2A and/or Gαqi Protein in CHO-K1 Cells— CHO-K1 cells were transfected with pCXN2.1-G2A using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. Stably transfected clones resistant to 1 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) were selected, and the expression levels of G2A were confirmed by reverse transcriptase-PCR and flow cytometric analysis. Some clones that highly expressed G2A (designated as CHO-G2A cells) were further transfected with pcDNA3.1/Zeo-Gqi, and the stably transfected clones were selected in the presence of 1 mg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen) and reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis (CHO-G2A-Gqi cells). CHO-K1 cells stably expressing Gαqi protein were also cloned (CHO-Gqi cells). Measurement of Intracellular Calcium Concentration—CHO cells were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2 AM (Dojindo) in HEPES/Tyrode's/BSA buffer (25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 12 mm NaHCO3, 5.6 mm d-glucose, 0.37 mm NaH2PO4, 0.49 mm MgCl2, and 0.01% fatty acid-free BSA) containing 1.25 mm probenecid and 0.02% Pluronic F127 for 1 h at 37°C. The cells were washed with HEPES/Tyrode's/BSA buffer, and changes in intracellular calcium concentrations upon ligand stimulation were monitored with a FLEX-station scanning fluorometer system (Molecular Devices) in 96-well microtiter plates or with a RF5300PC spectrofluorometer (Shimadzu) in glass tubes. Measurement of Intracellular cAMP Concentration—CHO cells seeded onto the 96-well plates were washed with HEPES/Tyrode's/BSA buffer and pretreated with 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (phosphodiesterase inhibitor) for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were costimulated with various concentrations of 9(S)-HODE and 3 μm forskolin for 30 min at 37 °C, and the accumulated cAMP concentrations were measured using a cAMP-Screen System (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In some cases, the cells were pretreated with 50 ng/ml PTX for 16 h before stimulation. GTPγS Binding Assay—CHO-G2A or HEK293 cells transfected with pCXN2.1-G2A were disrupted by sonication in a homogenizing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche)). The homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g, and the resulting supernatants were further centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 × g. The precipitates (membrane fractions) were resuspended in the homogenizing buffer, and the protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) using BSA as a standard. The membrane fractions (20 μg of proteins) were incubated with 0.5 nm [35S]GTPγS and various concentrations of 9(S)-HODE in 200 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm GDP, and 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA) for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence or absence of unlabeled 20 μm GTPγS. The reactions were terminated by rapid filtration through GF/C glass fiber filters (Whatman). The filters were intensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline, dried at 50 °C, and then immersed in the Aquasol II scintillation mixture (Packard). The radioactivity of the filters was measured with a LS6500 scintillation system (Beckman). Analysis of MAP Kinase Activation—CHO cells were disrupted by sonication after various stimulations, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. An aliquot of protein (15 μg) was separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences), blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 20% Applie Duo blocking solution (Seikagaku Corp.) at 4 °C overnight, and then incubated with primary antibodies in Tris-buffered saline containing 2% Applie Duo blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibodies to detect total and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, p38, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) were supplied as a part of the MAP Kinase Activation Sampler Kit (BD Bioscience), and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, the signals were visualized using an ECL plus Western blotting Detection System (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Peroxidation and PLA2 Treatment of PC—In vitro peroxidation of 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl PC by a radical initiator, 2,2′-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile) (AMVN), was performed according to the method described by Yoshida et al. (19Yoshida Y. Ito N. Shimakawa S. Niki E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In brief, PC (2 mg) was dissolved in acetonitrile/tert-butyl alcohol (4:1 in volume) at a final concentration of 5 mm, and peroxidation was induced by 2 mm AMVN for 3 h at 37 °C with mild agitation. The reaction was terminated by adding excess ethanol, and the solvent was evaporated under nitrogen gas. For the hydrolysis by phospholipase A2 (PLA2), the lipids were redissolved in diethyl ether, and mixed with the same volume of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and CaCl2 was added at a final concentration of 2.5 mm. Hydrolysis was induced by adding 20 units of PLA2 from Naja mossambica mossambica (Sigma) followed by incubation for 2 h at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by adding EDTA (2.5 mm), and the lipids were extracted by the Bligh and Dyer method (20Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42865) Google Scholar). After evaporation of the solvent under nitrogen gas, the lipids were dissolved in HEPES/Tyrode's/BSA buffer for the FLEXstation assay. Measurement of Proton-sensing Activity—As described by Ludwig et al. (12Ludwig M.G. Vanek M. Guerini D. Gasser J.A. Jones C.E. Junker U. Hofstetter H. Wolf R.M. Seuwen K. Nature. 2003; 425: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), Ham's F-12 medium containing 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA and HEPES/EPPS/MES (7.5 mm each) was prepared to achieve a wide range of pH (referred as F12-HEM). EPPS was from Wako. The pH of the buffer was adjusted under the experimental conditions using a carefully calibrated pH meter (Beckman). IP accumulation assay was performed as described by Murakami et al. (13Murakami N. Yokomizo T. Okuno T. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42484-42491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In brief, CHO cells seeded onto 12-well plates were labeled with 1 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol (Amersham Biosciences) for 18 h in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were washed twice and exposed to F12-HEM containing 20 mm LiCl with or without 10 μm 9(S)-HODE for 45 min at 37 °C. Accumulated IPs were isolated by anion-exchange chromatography (AG 1-X8 resin, Bio-Rad), and the radioactivity was measured with a LS6500 scintillation system. Intracellular Calcium Mobilization Evoked by 9(S)-HODE in CHO Cells Expressing G2A—While determining ligands for orphan GPCRs by a calcium mobilization assay using a FLEXstation system, we found that G2A, which was stably expressed in CHO-K1 cells (CHO-G2A), responded to 9(S)-HODE. As shown in Fig. 1A, 9(S)-HODE evoked intracellular calcium mobilization in CHO-G2A cells in a dose-dependent manner. The concentration of 9(S)-HODE required to induce half-maximal activation was ∼2 μm. On the other hand, parental CHO-K1 cells did not respond to 9(S)-HODE at all. To facilitate the detection of calcium signals, we utilized Gαqi chimeric protein in which 9 COOH-terminal peptides of Gαq protein were replaced with the corresponding residues of the Gαi protein. The COOH-terminal region of the Gα protein plays an important role in specifying receptor interactions, and this chimeric protein can mediate stimulation of phospholipase C by receptors otherwise coupled exclusively to Gαi (21Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 1A, cells that stably expressed both G2A and Gαqi (CHO-G2A-Gqi) showed largely enhanced responses to 9(S)-HODE. In these cells, the concentration of 9(S)-HODE required to induce half-maximal activation was reduced to submicromolar levels. On the contrary, CHO cells that stably expressed only Gαqi (CHO-Gqi) did not respond to 9(S)-HODE. To eliminate the possibility of specific stable clones responding to 9(S)-HODE because of some unexpected changes during the selection processes, we performed the calcium mobilization assay in multiple stable clones and obtained essentially the same results (data not shown). We also analyzed the calcium response of G2A to 9(S)-HODE in a transient expression system. CHO-Gqi cells were transfected with pCXN2.1-G2A or the empty vector (pCXN2.1), and the calcium response to 9(S)-HODE was examined after 24 h. Only after the pCXN2.1-G2A was transfected, did the CHO-Gqi cells respond to 9(S)-HODE (Fig. 1B). These results show that G2A responds to 9(S)-HODE and mediates intracellular calcium mobilization, which is greatly enhanced by coexpression of Gαqi protein. Ligand Specificity of G2A—To elucidate the ligand specificity of G2A, various oxidized derivatives of linoleic and arachidonic acid, 1 μm each, were assessed in the calcium mobilization assay. We chose a series of oxidized free fatty acids, as they could be produced in vivo by the enzymatic reactions of lipoxygenases and cytochrome P450 enzymes (22Funk C.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (3048) Google Scholar, 23Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Harris R.C. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 163-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Wang H. Zhao Y. Bradbury J.A. Graves J.P. Foley J. Blaisdell J.A. Goldstein J.A. Zeldin D.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1148-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), or by nonenzymatic radical reactions (19Yoshida Y. Ito N. Shimakawa S. Niki E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Among them, 9(S)-HODE and 11-HETE showed the strongest ability to mobilize intracellular calcium in CHO-G2A-Gqi cells (Fig. 2A; the molecular structures of these two lipids are shown in the inset). In this respect, the ability of 9(S)-HPODE was comparable with that of 9(S)-HODE, but that of 13(S)-HODE and 13(S)-HPODE were much weaker. 9-HODE in its cholesteryl ester form showed little activity. We also examined the effects of LPC (1-palmitoyl) and SPC in the range from 10 nm to 10 μm on calcium mobilization, but neither showed any significant response under these assay conditions. The results with 10 μm LPC are shown in Fig. 2A. Next, we investigated the chiral specificity of the ligands. The concentrations of 9(S)- and 9(R)-HODE (Cayman Chemical) were adjusted by quantification using a spectrophotometer just prior to use. As shown in Fig. 2B, 9(S)-HODE showed little but significantly higher ability to mobilize intracellular calcium in CHO-G2A-Gqi cells than 9(R)-HODE in concentrations above 0.3 μm. However, the chiral selectivity of G2A was not highly specific. These results indicate that the common structure from the hydroxy or hydroperoxy group to the ω end (2Z,4E-decadien-1-hydro(pero)xide) of 9-H(P)ODE and 11-HETE is important for ligand recognition of G2A. 9(S)-HODE-induced GTPγS Binding—Next, we examined whether 9(S)-HODE stimulated the GDP/GTP exchange on Gα protein using membrane preparations from G2A-expressing cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, the membrane of CHO-G2A cells exhibited 9(S)-HODE-evoked [35S]GTPγS binding in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas the membrane of CHO-K1 cells did not evoke such a binding. To confirm the involvement of G2A in 9(S)-HODE-evoked [35S]GTPγS binding, we performed another analysis in the transient expression system using HEK293 cells. Membranes were prepared from HEK293 cells 24 h after transfection of plasmid DNAs. Although 9(S)-HODE-evoked [35S]GTPγS binding was not observed in the membranes transfected with G2A alone (data not shown), the specific binding became apparent in the membranes after cotransfection of Gαi with G2A (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, transfection of Gαi with the empty vector did not show the 9(S)-HODE-evoked [35S]GTPγS binding. These results indicate that 9(S)-HODE can stimulate the activation of Gα protein via G2A. Involvement of Gαi Protein in G2A-mediated Signal—As the intracellular calcium mobilization evoked by 9(S)-HODE was largely potentiated by Gαqi (Fig. 1A), and the GTPγS binding was observed by coexpression of G2A with Gαi in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3B), it was inferred that Gαi protein is involved in G2A-mediated signaling. To examine this possibility, CHO-G2A cells were pretreated with 50 ng/ml PTX for 16 h, and analyzed in a calcium mobilization assay. PTX pretreatment partially suppressed intracellular calcium mobilization evoked by 9(S)-HODE, although PTX did not affect the calcium mobilization induced by 100 μm ATP (Fig. 4A). This result indicates that G2A induces intracellular calcium mobilization through both Gαi and Gαq pathways. Next, we examined the effects of 9(S)-HODE on adenylyl cyclase activity by measuring cAMP accumulation. When CHO-K1 or CHO-G2A cells were stimulated with 9(S)-HODE, no increase in cAMP concentration was observed (data not shown). On the other hand, in the presence of 3 μm forskolin (adenylyl cyclase activator), 9(S)-HODE inhibited cAMP accumulation in a dose-dependent manner, and this inhibition was abolished almost completely by PTX pretreatment (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that G2A couples with Gαi and inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity. JNK Activation by 9(S)-HODE—The family of serine/threonine kinases referred to as MAP kinases is activated after cell stimulation by various stimuli and plays pivotal roles in multiple signal transduction pathways. Three important kinases, namely, ERK1/2, p38, and JNK, belong to this family. We examined whether 9(S)-HODE activated these MAP kinases. CHO-K1 and CHO-G2A cells were treated with 9(S)-HODE for 0-30 min, and whole cell lysates were prepared by sonication. Activation of MAP kinases was assessed by Western blotting using phospho-specific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5A, JNK was activated by 9(S)-HODE in CHO-G2A cells, but not in CHO-K1 cells. The activation of JNK was maximal at ∼10 min with 1 μm 9(S)-HODE stimulation, and it was diminished after 30 min. As shown in Fig. 5B, 9(S)-HODE activated JNK in a dose-dependent manner in CHO-G2A cells. On the other hand, activation of neither ERK1/2 nor p38 was observed with 9(S)-HODE both in CHO-K1 and CHO-G2A cells (Fig. 5A). Oxidation and Hydrolysis of Phosphatidylcholine—Linoleic acid esters are the most abundant polyunsaturated fatty acid esters both in human plasma and membrane lipids, and are continuously exposed to oxidative stresses to yield hydroxy and hydroperoxy esters. To mimic the production of oxidized free fatty acids in vitro, 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl PC was oxidized by AMVN and then followed by hydrolysis of the ester bond of phospholipids at the sn-2 position by PLA2. AMVN, used as a radical initiator, was reported to hydroperoxidize 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl PC to generate 9- and 13-HPODE esters (19Yoshida Y. Ito N. Shimakawa S. Niki E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). PLA2 from N. mossambica mossambica hydrolyzed almost all PC to produce free fatty acids and LPC in our assay conditions, as judged from thin layer chromatography analysis (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 6, neith"
https://openalex.org/W2146239050,"The majority of polycythemia vera (PV) patients harbor a unique somatic mutation (V617F) in the pseudokinase domain of JAK2, which leads to constitutive signaling. Here we show that the homologous mutations in JAK1 (V658F) and in Tyk2 (V678F) lead to constitutive activation of these kinases. Their expression induces autonomous growth of cytokine-dependent cells and constitutive activation of STAT5, STAT3, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and Akt signaling in Ba/F3 cells. The mutant JAKs exhibit constitutive signaling also when expressed in fibrosarcoma cells deficient in JAK proteins.

Upon selection of Ba/F3 cells for autonomous growth induced by the JAK2 V617F mutant, cells respond to IGF1 by activating STAT5, STAT3, Erk1/2, and Akt on top of the constitutive activation characteristic of autonomous cells. The synergic effect on proliferation and STAT activation appears specific to the JAK2 V617F mutant. Our results show that the homologous V617F mutation induces activation of JAK1 and Tyk2, suggesting a common mechanism of activation for the JAK1, JAK2, and Tyk2 mutants. JAK3 is not activated by the homologous mutation M592F, despite the presence of the conserved GVC preceding sequence.

Approximately 25–30% of patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) and 50% of patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF) had this mutation also, while healthy people or patients with secondary erythrocytosis did not.

There are four Janus kinases (JAKs) in mammals, JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and Tyk2 that transduce signals for over 25 cytokines, which regulate blood formation and the immune response (8Yamaoka K. Saharinen P. Pesu M. Holt 3rd, V.E. Silvennoinen O. O'Shea J.J. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: 253Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). JAKs share an architecture that contains a kinase (JAK homology 1, JH1) domain at the carboxyl terminus, preceded by a pseudokinase, JAK homology 2 (JH2) domain, and an amino terminus comprising a FERM domain (protein 4.1, ezrin, moezin, radixin homologous) and an SH2 domain (8Yamaoka K.

Exactly how JH2 regulates the activity of JAKs is not clear, although JAKs require intact JH2 domains for activation via ligand-activated cytokine receptors. Work on Drosophila JAK identified a point mutant E695K in the JH2 pseudokinase domain, which constitutively activates the enzyme and leads to lympho-hemato-proliferation (9Luo H. Rose P. Barber D. Hanratty W.P. Lee S. Roberts T.M. D'Andrea A.D. Dearolf C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1562-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The homologous E665K mutation in JAK2 also leads to constitutive activation of the enzyme (9Luo H. Rose P. Barber D. Hanratty W.P. Lee S. Roberts T.M. D'Andrea A.D. Dearolf C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1562-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), while it had no effect in JAK3 (10Chen M. Cheng A. Candotti F. Zhou Y.J. Hymel A. Fasth A. Notarangelo L.D. O'Shea J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that the kinase activity of JH1 is inhibited when appended to JH2 (11Saharinen P. Takaluoma K. Silvennoinen O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3387-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that one role of the JH2 domain, at least in JAK2, is to keep the kinase domain inactive in the absence of cytokines. Furthermore, upon phosphorylation, Tyr570 in the JH2 domain of JAK2 negatively regulates activity (12Feener E.P. Rosario F. Dunn S.L. Stancheva Z. Myers Jr., M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4968-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 13Argetsinger L.S. Kouadio J.L. Steen H. Stensballe A. Jensen O.N. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4955-4967Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to other phosphorylation sites, such as the positively acting Tyr221 (13Argetsinger L.S. Kouadio J.L. Steen H. Stensballe A. Jensen O.N. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4955-4967Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), Tyr813 (14Kurzer J.H. Argetsinger L.S. Zhou Y.J. Kouadio J.L. O'Shea J.J. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4557-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and, of course, the activation loop Tyr1007, which is required for activation (15Feng J. Witthuhn B.A. Matsuda T. Kohlhuber F. Kerr I.M. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2497-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). But JH2 domains were shown to be structurally required for the activity of JAK3 (10Chen M. Cheng A. Candotti F. Zhou Y.J. Hymel A. Fasth A. Notarangelo L.D. O'Shea J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and especially of Tyk2 (16Velazquez L. Mogensen K.E. Barbieri G. Fellous M. Uze G. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3327-3334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 17Yeh T.C. Dondi E. Uze G. Pellegrini S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8991-8996Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Taken together, all available evidence supports a crucial role for JH2 domains in the structure and function of JAK proteins, both before and after cytokine receptor activation. Strikingly, the valine residue at position 617 is conserved in JAK1 and Tyk2, while in JAK3 it is replaced by a methionine. We asked the question of whether a homologous V → F mutation would result in activation of JAK1 and Tyk2 and whether a M → F mutation would activate JAK3. Here we show that the homologous mutations V658F for JAK1 and V678F for Tyk2 lead to strong constitutive activation of these kinases. The homologous M592F mutation in JAK3 does not lead to activation of JAK3, further showing that JAK3 is different from the other three JAKs. We also show that the mutant JAK2 specifically synergizes with IGF1 to induce proliferation of Ba/F3 cells and IGF1-dependent activation of STAT5 and STAT3 on top of the constitutive levels induced by the JAK2 mutant. Since hypersensitivity to IGF1 is one characteristic of PV erythroid progenitors (18Correa P.N. Eskinazi D. Axelrad A.A. Blood. 1994; 83: 99-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Mirza A.M.

Ba/F3 cells were then infected and GFP- or CD4-positive cells were sorted 72 h after infection. Ba/F3 cells were normally cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and cytokines (IL3). After retroviral infection and sorting, cells were washed in RPMI medium and cultured in the absence of cytokines for assaying cytokine-independent growth or cultured in the presence of IGF1. Cell numbers were recorded using a Coulter cell counter. IL9 was a kind gift of Drs. Jean-Christophe Renauld and Jacques Van Snick, Ludwig Institute, Brussels, while murine Tpo, IL3, and IGF1 were purchased from R&D Systems. Dual Luciferase Assays—Transcriptional activity of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins was assessed by measuring luciferase expression in cells transfected with the following luciferase constructs: pGRR5-Luc, a reporter that responds to STAT5, STAT3, and STAT1 (27Dumoutier L. Van Roost E. Colau D. Renauld J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10144-10149Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar); pGL3bPpr2-Luc construct, a luciferase reporter that responds to STAT3 (28Eyckerman S. Waelput W. Verhee A. Broekaert D. Vandekerckhove J. Tavernier J. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1999; 10: 549-556PubMed Google Scholar) or the pLHRE-Luc reporter, which preferentially responds to STAT5 (29Sotiropoulos A. Moutoussamy S. Binart N. Kelly P.A. Finidori J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), as described (23Seubert N. Royer Y. Staerk J. Kubatzky K.F. Moucadel V. Krishnakumar S. Smith S.O. Constantinescu S.N. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1239-1250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activity induced by STAT3 upon JAK1 activation was measured in JAK1-deficient U4C cells that were transfected with the pGL3bPpr2-Luc construct, along with cDNAs coding for JAK proteins to be tested and components of the IL9 receptor complex. Transcriptional activity induced by STAT3 upon Tyk2 activation was measured in Tyk2-deficient 11,1 cells that were transfected with the cDNA coding for pGL3bPpr2-Luc construct, along with the STAT3 cDNA, the cDNAs coding for the JAK proteins to be tested and for the TpoR. Experiments were performed as described previously (1James C. Ugo V. Le Couedic J.P. Staerk J. Delhommeau F. Lacout C. Garcon L. Raslova H. Berger R. Bennaceur-Griscelli A. Villeval J.L. Constantinescu S.N. Casadevall N. Vainchenker W. Nature. 2005; 434: 1144-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activity of STAT5 and STAT3 in Ba/F3 cells expressing various mutant JAK proteins was assessed by using the general STAT reporter pGRR5-Luc. Western Blotting—Ba/F3 cells were washed three times in RPMI to remove residual IL3 and fetal bovine serum and then starved for 6 h in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in RPMI. The cells were counted and diluted to 2.5 million cells per ml of medium. Four cell lines were analyzed for each JAK protein, namely the Ba/F3 parental cells, Ba/F3 cells sorted for wild type JAK (wt), or mutant JAK expression and cells selected for cytokine-independent growth due to the expression of the mutant JAK. Cells were divided in aliquots of 1 ml and stimulated with either IGF1 or IL3 for 5, 15, or 30 min or left untreated. After stimulation, the cells were centrifuged and the pellets lysed in 250 μl of Laemmli buffer using a 20-gauge syringe. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 8% gels by loading the equivalent of ∼250,000 cells per well and were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking the membranes in 5% milk/TBS-Tween, immunoblotting was performed by overnight incubations in the cold with primary antibodies in 0.1% TBS-Tween, using the dilution recommended by the manufacturer. After 3 × 5 min of washing in 0.1% TBS-Tween, the membranes were incubated with secondary anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase antibodies from Cell Signaling, diluted 1:5,000 in 0.1% phosphate-buffered saline-Tween. After 3 × 5 min of washing, ECL was performed using Santa Cruz Western blotting Luminol Reagent and exposed on Kodak Biomax Light Film. Phosphorylation of signaling proteins was investigated by using Western blots and probing with the following phospho-specific antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology: anti-pY1007/1008 JAK2, anti-pY1022/1023 JAK1, anti-pY1054/1055 Tyk2, anti-pY694 STAT5, anti-pY727 STAT3, anti-pS473 Akt, anti-pYpT Erk1/2, and anti-pY1131 IGF1R/pY1146. Antibodies to detect protein levels of STAT5, STAT3, Akt, and IGF1Rα were also from Cell Signaling Technology. For the detection of Erk1/2 levels an anti Erk1/2 rabbit anti-EETARFQPGYRS antiserum was used. To detect protein levels of JAK2 and Tyk2, we used the anti-JAK2 (C-20) and the anti-Tyk2 (C-20) antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, for JAK1 we used the anti-JAK1 from Upstate Biotechnology, and for JAK3 we used anti-JAK3 (C-21) antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Conservation of JAK2 Val617 and Surrounding Sequence—In mammals there are four known JAKs, JAK1, JAK2, Tyk2, and JAK3 (8Yamaoka K. Saharinen P. Pesu M. Holt 3rd, V.E. Silvennoinen O. O'Shea J.J. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: 253Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). We aligned the protein sequences coding for the Janus kinases and noted that the JAK2 Val617 is conserved in JAK1 (Val658) and Tyk2 (Val678) and is replaced by methionine in JAK3 (Met592) (Fig. 1A). The preceding sequence, GVC, is stringently conserved in all four Janus kinases. Based on the x-ray crystal structure of the fibroblast growth factor receptor kinase domain (30Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), these residues are predicted to be part of a short β-strand, while Val617 is predicted to be part of a loop (30Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 31Lindauer K. Loerting T. Liedl K.R. Kroemer R.T. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). As we suggested previously (1James C. Ugo V. Le Couedic J.P. Staerk J. Delhommeau F. Lacout C. Garcon L. Raslova H. Berger R. Bennaceur-Griscelli A. Villeval J.L. Constantinescu S.N. Casadevall N. Vainchenker W. Nature. 2005; 434: 1144-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar, 6Vainchenker W. Constantinescu S.N. Hematology (Am. Soc. Hematol. Educ. Program). 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), the V617F mutation may disrupt the inhibitory activity of the pseudokinase JH2 domain on the kinase JH1 domain, possibly by stabilizing an activated conformation of the activation loop. Constitutive Activation of JAK1 V658F and Tyk2 V678F Mutants in Ba/F3 Cells—To test whether the introduction of a phenylalanine residue at the homologous position of JAK2 Val617 affects the activity of other JAKs, we constructed mutants JAK1 V658F, Tyk2 V678F, and JAK3 M592F and cloned them in bicistronic retroviruses, as described (23Seubert N. Royer Y. Staerk J. Kubatzky K.F. Moucadel V. Krishnakumar S. Smith S.O. Constantinescu S.N. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1239-1250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows that the mutant JAK1 V658F is constitutively active as shown by its ability to render Ba/F3 cells autonomous for growth. On the same graph, the acquisition of cytokine-independent growth by Ba/F3 cells expressing the JAK2 V617F or the Tyk2 V678F mutants is shown. It is clear that all three mutant JAKs are constitutively active. It is difficult to compare the activities, since each is detected in Western blots by different antibodies, but nevertheless, for each type of JAK protein, levels of sorted wild type and mutant proteins were similar, as shown by Western blotting with antibodies directed to each JAK protein (Figs. 3B, 4B, and 5B, compare sorted Ba/F3 cells for expression of wild type and mutant). Thus, JAK1 V658F and Tyk2 V678F are constitutively active and trigger ligand-independent cell proliferation in Ba/F3 cells.FIGURE 4Cross-talk between the IGF1R and the JAK1 V658F mutant. A, Ba/F3 cells sorted for the expression of the murine wild type JAK1 (JAK1wt) or JAK1 V658F mutant at equal levels were grown in the absence of any cytokines or stimulated with either 100 ng/ml IGF or 5 ng/ml IL-3 as indicated. Shown are cell numbers (average of triplicates + S.D.) counted 72 h after treatment with IGF1.

Activation of signaling was detected by Western blotting with the indicated phospho-specific antibodies, while protein levels were assessed using antibodies directed against the signaling proteins themselves.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5Synergy and cross-talk between the IGF1R and the Tyk2 V678F mutant.

Activation of signaling was detected by Western blotting with the indicated phospho-specific antibodies, while protein levels were assessed using the indicated antibodies directed against the signaling proteins themselves. exog and endog refer to the transduced tagged Tyk2 versus the endogenous murine Tyk2 in Ba/F3 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 1B also shows that the JAK3 M592F mutant is not constitutively active, although this mutant is well expressed and can mediate IL9 signaling like the wild type JAK3 (data not shown). Thus, both JAK1 and Tyk2 are activated by the homologous V617F mutation, while JAK3 is not. Similar negative results were reported for another JH2 mutation (E695K in Drosophila JAK and E665K in JAK2), which had no effect in JAK3 (9Luo H. Rose P. Barber D. Hanratty W.P. Lee S. Roberts T.M. D'Andrea A.D. Dearolf C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1562-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Constitutive and Ligand-induced Activation of STAT Proteins by the Mutant JAK1 and Tyk2—Furthermore, we explored the transcriptional activity induced by the mutant JAKs via STATs. For the JAK1 V658F mutant we used JAK1-deficient U4C cells (24Muller M. Briscoe J. Laxton C. Guschin D. Ziemiecki A. Silvennoinen O. Harpur A.G. Barbieri G. Witthuhn B.A. Schindler C. Pellegrini S. Wilks A.F. Ihle J.N. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Nature. 1993; 366: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 32Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar), where the STAT3 reporter construct pGL3bPpr2-Luc (28Eyckerman S. Waelput W. Verhee A. Broekaert D. Vandekerckhove J. Tavernier J. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1999; 10: 549-556PubMed Google Scholar) was co-transfected with STAT3 cDNA. Cells were transfected either with the cDNA coding for wild type or mutant JAK1 alone or together with the cDNAs coding for the components of the IL9 receptor (IL9R), namely the IL9 receptor α (IL9Rα), the common γ chain, and JAK3, which are all required to reconstitute IL9 signaling in these cells. Fig. 2A shows that expression of JAK1 V658F leads to constitutive STAT3 activation. When the components of the IL9R complex were co-transfected, addition of IL9 increased the activity of STAT3 in cells transfected with the wild type JAK1, while no significant increase was seen for the mutant JAK1, presumably because the system was saturated by the other receptor components, i.e. γ chain and/or JAK3. We also examined the activation of STAT5 and STAT3 transcriptional activity by the Tyk2 V678F mutant. We used Ba/F3 cells either sorted for expression of the mutant Tyk2 or cells that were subsequently selected for autonomous growth. As shown in Fig. 2B, strong activation of STAT signaling could be demonstrated in both the sorted and the selected cells when the pGRR5-Luc, a reporter that responds to STAT5, STAT3, and STAT1 (27Dumoutier L. Van Roost E. Colau D. Renauld J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10144-10149Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) was used. Similar results were obtained when the pHLRE-luciferase construct was employed, which preferentially responds to STAT5 (29Sotiropoulos A. Moutoussamy S. Binart N. Kelly P.A. Finidori J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (data not shown). We also explored signaling by the mutant Tyk2 in cells deficient in Tyk2, the 11,1 fibrosarcoma cells (25Pellegrini S. John J. Shearer M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4605-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 26Velazquez L. Fellous M. Stark G.R. Pellegrini S. Cell. 1992; 70: 313-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). For signaling the activated TpoR requires mainly JAK2, but Tyk2 can also transduce the signal in the absence of JAK2. In 11,1 cells there is not enough JAK2 activity to support TpoR signaling (data not shown). When activation of STAT3 was examined using the pGL3bPpr2 luciferase reporter, which preferentially responds to STAT3 (28Eyckerman S. Waelput W. Verhee A. Broekaert D. Vandekerckhove J. Tavernier J. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1999; 10: 549-556PubMed Google Scholar), we could note again that the Tyk2 V678F mutant is constitutively active in 11,1 cells and that addition of Tpo further augments this activity (Fig. 2C). This result shows that the mutant Tyk2 can replace the wild type Tyk2 and be appended to the TpoR cytosolic domain, as the 11,1 cells are deficient for Tyk2. Cross-talk with IGF1—Previous reports have described a hypersensitivity of PV progenitors to IGF1 (18Correa P.N. Eskinazi D. Axelrad A.A. Blood. 1994; 83: 99-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Mirza A.M. Correa P.N. Axelrad A.A. Blood. 1995; 86: 877-882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Mirza A.M. Ezzat S. Axelrad A.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 1862-1869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such hypersensitivity to growth factors became one of the hallmarks of PV, along with the Epo-independent or hypersensitive erythroid colony formation and down-modulation of the cell-surface TpoR (c-Mpl) in megakaryocytes and platelets (33Moliterno A.R. Hankins W.D. Spivak J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 572-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 34Moliterno A.R. Spivak J.L. Blood. 1999; 94: 2555-2561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our hypothesis is that the JAK2 V617F mutant is responsible for both hallmarks of PV (6Vainchenker W. Constantinescu S.N. Hematology (Am. Soc. Hematol. Educ. Program). 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 7Zhao Z.J. Krantz S.B. Vainchenker W. Casadevall N. Constantinescu S.N. Semin. Hematol. 2005; 42: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We compared the response of parental Ba/F3 cells and of Ba/F3 cells sorted for expression of wt JAK2 and the mutant JAK2 V617F. As shown in Fig. 3B, these sorted Ba/F3 cells expressed levels of JAK2 that were ∼2-fold higher than the endogenous levels (Fig. 3B). These cells were maintained in IL3 and were not subjected to selection for autonomous, cytokine-independent growth, which normally takes 5–6 days of culture in the absence of IL3. In Fig. 3A we show that when cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml IGF1, only the JAK2 V617F cells responded with a major increase in cell proliferation. Cells overexpressing wild type JAK2 showed a very weak response at concentrations of and above 300 ng/ml; parental Ba/F3 cells showed a marginal response at 300 ng/ml. The"
https://openalex.org/W2031045201,"Many essential functions of living cells are performed by nanoscale protein motors. The best characterized of these is FoF1-ATP synthase, the smallest rotary motor. This rotary motor catalyzes the synthesis of ATP with high efficiency under conditions where the reactants (ADP, H2PO4−) and the product (ATP) are present in the cell at similar concentrations. We present a detailed structure-based kinetic model for the mechanism of action of F1-ATPase and demonstrate the role of different protein conformations for substrate binding during ATP synthesis and ATP hydrolysis. The model shows that the pathway for ATP hydrolysis is not simply the pathway for ATP synthesis in reverse.

It does so under cellular conditions that favor the hydrolysis reaction by a factor of 2 × 105. In fact, as a result of the activity of the FoF1-ATP synthase, the concentration ratio (ATP:ADP/Pi) is close to unity in mitochondria (Karplus and Gao, 2004Karplus M. Gao Y.Q.

This remarkable property is based on the essential difference between an ordinary enzyme, which increases the rate of reaction without shifting the equilibrium, and a catalytic motor (Alberts, 1998Alberts B. The cell as a collection of protein machines: preparing the next generation of molecular biologists.Cell. 1998; 92: 291-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar) like FoF1-ATP synthase, which can drive a reaction away from equilibrium by harnessing an external force. Given that a sedentary adult synthesizes and uses about 40 kg of ATP per day (Voet and Voet, 1995Voet, D., and Voet, J.G. (1995). Biochemistry, Second Edition (New York: John Wiley), p. 433.Google Scholar), an understanding of the detailed mechanism of FoF1-ATP synthase is essential for a molecular explanation of the biology of living cells. FoF1-ATP synthase is composed of two domains (Figure 1): a transmembrane portion (Fo), the rotation of which is induced by a proton gradient, and a globular catalytic moiety (F1) that synthesizes and hydrolyzes ATP. In this article, we focus on the F1-ATPase moiety, for which high-resolution structures are available (Abrahams et al., 1994Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E.

F1-ATPase can synthesize, as well as hydrolyze, ATP. ATP synthesis has been demonstrated recently by applying an external torque to the γ subunit, causing it to rotate in the reverse direction from that observed during ATP hydrolysis (Itoh et al., 2004Itoh H. Takahashi A. Adachi K. Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Mechanically driven ATP synthesis by F1-ATPase.Nature. 2004; 427: 465-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Thus, the primary function of the proton-motive force acting on FoF1-ATP synthase is to provide the torque required to rotate the γ subunit in the direction for ATP synthesis. F1-ATPase has three α and three β subunits arranged in alternation around the γ subunit, which has a globular base and an extended coiled-coil domain (Abrahams et al., 1994Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Structure at 2.8 resolution of F1-ATPase from bovine heart mitochondria.Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2635) Google Scholar) (Figure 1). All of the α and β subunits bind nucleotides, but only the three β subunits are catalytically active. The crystal structures of F1-ATPase provide views of distinct conformational states of the catalytic β subunits (Abrahams et al., 1994Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E.

The centrally located and asymmetric γ subunit forms a shaft, and it has been proposed that its orientation determines the conformations of the β subunits. The original crystal structure (Abrahams et al., 1994Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Structure at 2.8 resolution of F1-ATPase from bovine heart mitochondria.Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2635) Google Scholar) of F1-ATPase from bovine heart mitochondria led to the identification of three conformations of the β subunit: βE (empty), βTP (ATP analog bound), and βDP (ADP bound). In a more recent high-resolution crystal structure (Menz et al., 2001Menz R.I. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G.W. Structure of bovine mitochondrial F(1)-ATPase with nucleotide bound to all three catalytic sites: implications for the mechanism of rotary catalysis.Cell. 2001; 106: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), the βTP and βDP subunits contain an ATP analog (ADP plus AlF4−) and the third catalytic subunit has a half-closed conformation, called βHC, containing ADP plus SO4− (an analog of Pi). The open βE and half-closed βHC conformations of the third β subunit are both very different from those of the βTP and βDP subunits, which are both closed and very similar to each other in all structures. Specifically, the βHC conformation is between the “open” βE conformation, in which the interaction between β strands 3 and 7 is disrupted, and the “closed” βTP and βDP conformations (Figure 2), in which the nucleotide binding domain and α-helical domain have rotated toward each other by 30° with respect to their positions in βE (Abrahams et al., 1994Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Structure at 2.8 resolution of F1-ATPase from bovine heart mitochondria.Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2635) Google Scholar). From his insightful analysis of kinetic data, in advance of detailed structural information, Paul Boyer proposed a “binding change mechanism” by which rotary catalysis could operate (Boyer, 1993Boyer P.D. The binding change mechanism for ATP synthase—some probabilities and possibilities.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). In a modern interpretation of the mechanism, which differs in detail from Boyer’s original proposal, ATP synthesis proceeds by the cyclical conversion of each of the β subunits from an “open” state that binds to nucleotide only weakly to a “tight” state that has highest affinity for ATP and finally to a “loose” state, which has a lower affinity for ATP and from which ATP can be released. The first crystal structure (Abrahams et al., 1994Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Structure at 2.8 resolution of F1-ATPase from bovine heart mitochondria.Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2635) Google Scholar) clearly supported the general features of the binding change mechanism, as did single-molecule experiments (Noji et al., 1997Noji H.

Resolution of distinct rotational substeps by submillisecond kinetic analysis of F1-ATPase.Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Researchers were reluctant to accept the rotary mechanism until its explicit visualization (Noji et al., 1997Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita K. Itoh H. Direct observation of the rotation of F1-ATPase.Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar), but it is now generally accepted and forms the conceptual basis of the quantitative model we present here. Given the remarkable properties of F1-ATPase, this rotary-motor enzyme has been the subject of many experimental studies. Nevertheless, a detailed understanding of the mechanism by which it carries out its functions is not available. Several pictorial models of the mechanism of F1-ATPase hydrolysis have been proposed (Boyer, 1997Boyer P.D. The ATP synthase—a splendid molecular machine.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar, Menz et al., 2001Menz R.I. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G.W.

F1-ATPase: A molecular motor that hydrolyzes ATP with sequential opening and closing of catalytic sites coupled to rotation of its γ-subunit.Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 819-826Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), but none of them provide a consistent and comprehensive picture of how the F1-ATPase operates during both ATP hydrolysis and ATP synthesis. This is due mostly to the lack of a quantitative description of how the thermodynamics and kinetics of the enzyme are related to the structural data. Essential elements for developing such a mechanism have been missing. However, recent molecular dynamics simulations have supplied the “missing link” between the high-resolution crystal structure of F1-ATPase and the measurements in solution and of single molecules. On the basis of these results, we can now formulate a consistent structure-based model for both ATP synthesis and hydrolysis by F1-ATPase. In developing this model, we have sought to answer a number of essential questions, which are listed below. We focus here on the primary function of the F1-ATPase motor—that is, ATP synthesis—although a corresponding model for hydrolysis is also given in the paper. For each question, we indicate in general terms how it is resolved by our analysis. More complete explanations are provided in the Results and Discussion. 1. How Does Rotation of the γ Shaft Induced Either by the Proton-Motive Force (Boyer, 1997Boyer P.D. The ATP synthase—a splendid molecular machine.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar) or an External Force (Itoh et al., 2004Itoh H. Takahashi A. Adachi K. Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Mechanically driven ATP synthesis by F1-ATPase.Nature. 2004; 427: 465-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) Alter the Conformations of the Catalytic Subunits? The mechanism involved has been elucidated by molecular dynamics simulations (Ma et al., 2002Ma J. Flynn T.C. Cui Q. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Karplus M.

Dinner A.R. Oster G. Elastic energy storage in beta-sheets with application to F1-ATPase.Eur. Biophys. J. 2003; 32: 676-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). 2. What Is the Binding Affinity of Each Structurally Defined Binding Site? Specifically, what is the relationship between the measured solution affinities for ATP and ADP, Pi, and the binding sites in the different conformations of the catalytic subunits observed in the X-ray structures? Answering this question is critical to generating a consistent model for the function of F1-ATPase. The answer determines the role of the different protein conformations in the synthesis and hydrolysis of ATP. Because these sites exist in a single structure, measurement of their individual binding affinities has not been possible. This is in contrast to most other motor proteins, such as myosin, in which separate structures with different affinities exist in solution and in crystals. Moreover, the βTP and βDP sites, which are bound with ligands in all structures, have very similar conformations. Recently, the missing link between the experimental solution measurement and X-ray structures has been obtained by the use of free-energy simulations (Yang et al., 2003Yang W. Gao Y.Q. Cui Q. Ma J. Karplus M. The missing link between thermodynamics and structure in F1-ATPase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 874-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The results described in this paper provide the thermodynamic basis for the structure-based model for the synthesis and hydrolysis of ATP by F1-ATPase. 3. What Is the Mechanism by which F1-ATPase Synthesizes ATP from ADP and Pi against a Strong Thermodynamic Driving Force Biased toward Hydrolysis? Although the essential concept is contained in the binding change mechanism of Boyer, an unresolved issue has been how the rotation of the γ subunit is coupled to the different conformations and binding affinities of the catalytic β subunits. This is now understood, given the answers to questions 1 and 2, and is described in detail here. 4. How Does the Enzyme Avoid Being Inhibited by ATP during ATP Synthesis When Its Concentration Is Essentially Equal to that of ADP and Pi, as It Is in the Mitochondria? How Is the Enzyme Optimized for Both ATP Synthesis and Hydrolysis as the Only Bidirectional Protein Machine in the Cell? The thermodynamic understanding of F1-ATPase allows us to construct a kinetic model, which answers these questions. The important realization for explaining the bidirectional functionality of F1-ATPase is that synthesis is not the exact inverse of hydrolysis, in accord with a prescient suggestion of Senior et al., 2002Senior A.E. Nadanaciva S. Weber J. The molecular mechanism of ATP synthesis by F1F0-ATP synthase.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 188-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar. Different catalytic subunits are involved in substrate binding and release in synthesis and hydrolysis. This is codified in the structure-based kinetic model, which has the E1E2 mechanism (DeMeis and Vianna, 1979DeMeis L. Vianna A.L. Energy interconversion by the Ca2+-dependent ATPase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 275-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) as one of its essential elements. In the current realization of the E1E2 mechanism, two major protein conformations are involved, one for reactant binding and the other for product release. ADP/Pi binding in synthesis and release during hydrolysis involves primarily the “half-closed” βHC site in the E2 conformation; ATP release during synthesis and binding during hydrolysis involves primarily the open βE site in the E1 conformation. The resulting kinetic model not only provides an interpretation of the available kinetic data but predicts new results. It also indicates how the activity of F1-ATPase is regulated in the cell as a function of the physiological concentrations of ATP, ADP, and Pi. 5. What Is the Chemical Occupancy of Each Structurally Defined Binding Site during ATP Synthesis and Hydrolysis? The answer resolves whether synthesis and hydrolysis operate through a bisite or trisite mechanism, a question that continues to be debated. By a bisite mechanism (Boyer, 1993Boyer P.D. The binding change mechanism for ATP synthase—some probabilities and possibilities.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar), we mean that, at any stage of ATP hydrolysis or synthesis, the occupation of only two catalytic sites but not the third is required, whereas a trisite mechanism (Senior et al., 2002Senior A.E. Nadanaciva S. Weber J. The molecular mechanism of ATP synthesis by F1F0-ATP synthase.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 188-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) requires all three sites to be occupied for the maximal rate of enzyme function. The analysis demonstrates that a trisite mechanism is operative when F1-ATPase is working optimally and elucidates how the cooperativity among the catalytic subunits is achieved. The negative cooperativity of ATP and ADP binding to the catalytic sites plays an essential role in generating the driving force for the rotation of the γ subunit during ATP hydrolysis. In turn, the rotation of the γ subunit leads to positive cooperativity during catalysis. We note that rotary catalysis leads to an increase in the observed hydrolysis rate by a factor of up to 5 × 105 relative to unisite catalysis (Boyer, 1993Boyer P.D. The binding change mechanism for ATP synthase—some probabilities and possibilities.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, Boyer, 1997Boyer P.D. The ATP synthase—a splendid molecular machine.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar, Gao et al., 2003Gao Y. Yang W. Marcus R.A. Karplus M. A model for the cooperative free energy transduction and kinetics of ATP hydrolysis by F1-ATPase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 11339-11344Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). 6. How Are the Chemical Reactions (ATP Synthesis and Hydrolysis) Modulated by the Essential Residues in the Binding Pocket? Specifically, how is hydrolysis of ATP prevented when the affinity of the enzyme for ATP is reduced after its synthesis, permitting release of ATP? From molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the positions of the catalytic residues change during the reaction cycle and that they are no longer in a position to accelerate the reaction when ATP is released. Two molecular dynamics simulations (Ma et al., 2002Ma J. Flynn T.C. Cui Q. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Karplus M. A dynamic analysis of the rotation mechanism for conformational change in F(1)-ATPase.Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 921-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, Böckmann and Grubmüller, 2002Böckmann R.A. Grubmüller H. Nanoseconds molecular dynamics simulation of primary mechanical energy transfer steps in F1-ATP synthase.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 198-202PubMed Google Scholar) have provided important insights into the mechanism of F1-ATPase action. Both calculations were performed with rotation of the γ subunit enforced in the direction predicted for synthesis (see Itoh et al., 2004Itoh H. Takahashi A. Adachi K. Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Mechanically driven ATP synthesis by F1-ATPase.Nature. 2004; 427: 465-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar and Diez et al., 2004Diez M. Zimmermann B. Borsch M. Konig M. Schweinberger E. Steigmiller S. Reuter R. Felekyan S. Kudryavtsev V. Seidel C.A.M. Graber P. Proton-powered subunit rotation in single membrane-bound F0F1-ATP synthase.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2004; 11: 135-141Crossref Scopus (334) Google Scholar for an experimental confirmation of this assumption). The timescale for one rotation of the γ shaft is in the microsecond-to-millisecond range (Kinosita et al., 2004Kinosita Jr., K. Adachi K. Itoh H. Rotation of F1-ATPase: how an ATP-driven molecular machine may work.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2004; 33: 245-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and is therefore not directly accessible to the nanosecond timescales probed by standard molecular dynamics simulations. To overcome this problem, the conformational transitions in F1-ATPase were obtained by molecular dynamics simulations in the presence of biasing forces, which were applied to either the γ subunit alone or the entire structure in a procedure that drives the system from one state to the other without explicitly constraining the nature of the transition path. The implicit assumption in such studies is that meaningful information concerning the mechanism can be obtained even though the time scale of the forced rotational transition of the γ subunit is several orders of magnitude faster than the actual rotation rate. The simulation results demonstrate how the rotation of the γ subunit induces the structural changes in the catalytic β subunits and explain why there is much less movement in the catalytically inactive α subunits that are bound to ligand. Both van der Waals (steric) and electrostatic interactions contribute to the coupling between the β and the γ subunits. The dominant electrostatic interactions occur between positive residues of both the coiled-coil portion and the globular region of the γ subunit (the “ionic track”) and the negatively charged residues of the β subunits (see Figures 4 and 5 of Ma et al., 2002Ma J. Flynn T.C. Cui Q. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Karplus M. A dynamic analysis of the rotation mechanism for conformational change in F(1)-ATPase.Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 921-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This ionic track leads to a smooth rotation pathway without large jumps in the coupling energy and is likely to contribute to the high efficiency of the chemomechanical energy transduction. The importance of some of the residues involved has been explored by mutation experiments (for a recent study, which reviews some of the earlier data, see Greene and Frasch, 2003Greene M.D. Frasch W.D. Interactions among gamma R268, gamma Q269, and the beta subunit catch loop of Escherichia coli F1-ATPase are important for catalytic activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51594-51598Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The simulations show how the rotation of the γ subunit induces the opening motion of the β subunits. In contrast, the closing motion of the β subunits appears to be spontaneous, once ligand is bound to the active site and there are no steric interactions caused by the γ subunit. This has been confirmed recently for an isolated β subunit in solution by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Yagi et al., 2004Yagi H. Tsujimoto T. Yamazaki T. Yoshida M. Akutsu H. Conformational change of H+-ATPase beta monomer revealed on segmental isotope labeling NMR spectroscopy.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 16632-16638Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the conformational changes observed in the β subunits have been shown to correspond to their lowest frequency normal modes (Cui et al., 2004Cui Q. Li G. Ma J. Karplus M. A normal mode analysis of structural plasticity in the biomolecular motor F(1)-ATPase.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 345-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This implies that the structure of the protein is designed by evolution such that the motions required for its function can take place with a low energy cost. An essential element of the mechanism of F1-ATPase action is the standard free-energy difference between ATP, H2O, and ADP/Pi at the catalytic sites associated with the different β subunit conformations. Four different binding constants for ATP have been measured for F1-ATPase in solution. The values for the E. coli enzyme are 0.2 nM, 2 μM, 25 μM, and 5 mM, respectively (Gao et al., 2003Gao Y. Yang W. Marcus R.A. Karplus M. A model for the cooperative free energy transduction and kinetics of ATP hydrolysis by F1-ATPase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 11339-11344Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is generally agreed that the open (βE) and half-closed (βHC) subunits have the two weakest binding sites and that the two other subunits (βTP and βDP) contain the tightest site and the second highest affinity site. To determine the role played by each of the β subunit conformations in the rotary-catalysis mechanism of F1-ATPase, it was essential to resolve the uncertainties concerning their binding affinities—that is, to make a connection (the missing link) between the microscopic (structural) and macroscopic (solution) data. This has been achieved recently (Yang et al., 2003Yang W. Gao Y.Q. Cui Q. Ma J. Karplus M. The missing link between thermodynamics and structure in F1-ATPase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 874-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, Gao et al., 2003Gao Y. Yang W. Marcus R.A. Karplus M. A model for the cooperative free energy transduction and kinetics of ATP hydrolysis by F1-ATPase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 11339-11344Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) by combining free-energy difference simulations with experimental data. The free-energy simulations were used to calculate the standard free-energy change (ΔG0) of the hydrolysis reaction in the various β subunit sites of the crystal structure. Free-energy simulation techniques have been developed to the stage where they can be used for answering quantitative questions in biomolecular systems (Simonson et al., 2002Simonson T. Archontis G. Karplus M. Free energy simulations come of age: protein-ligand recognition.Acc. Chem. Res. 2002; 35: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In the application of these techniques to F1-ATPase, statistical errors had to be carefully controlled to obtain reliable results (Yang et al., 2004Yang W. Bitetti-Putzer R. Karplus M. Free energy simulations: use of reverse cumulative averaging to determine the equilibrated region and the time required for convergence.J. Chem. Phys. 2004; 120: 2618-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The bound ATP/H2O was calculated as having a free energy similar to that of ADP/Pi in the βTP site (1.5 kcal/mol), whereas the free energy in the βDP site favors ADP/Pi relative to ATP/H2O by 9 kcal/mol. Experiments have shown that under unisite hydrolysis conditions (that is, at ATP concentrations so low that only one ATP is bound to the enzyme), the free energies of ATP/H2O and ADP/ Pi in the occupied site are nearly the same"

In animal models of acute and chronic inflammation, induction of HO-1 has anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties. Since inflammation is an important trigger of osteoclastogenesis, we hypothesized that HO-1 might influence osteoclastogenesis. We investigated the effects of induction of HO-1 on osteoclast formation in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we addressed the role of HO-1 in inflammatory bone loss in humans. When HO-1 was induced by hemin in vitro, a significant dose-dependent inhibition of osteoclastogenesis was observed. Up-regulation of HO-1 was mediated by activation of MAPK and primarily prevented differentiation of osteoclast precursors to osteoclasts, whereas it did not affect mature osteoclasts. Anti-osteoclastogenic properties of hemin were based on a down-regulation of c-fms, RANK, TRAF-6, and c-fos. In addition, induction of HO-1 inhibited TNF-triggered osteoclast differentiation in vitro as well as LPS-driven inflammatory bone loss in vivo. Furthermore, HO-1 induction suppressed osteoclastogenesis and bone destruction in a TNF-mediated arthritis. In line, assessment of synovial tissue from rheumatoid arthritis patients revealed that osteoclasts are usually HO-1 negative. Moreover, serum levels of bilirubin, a metabolite of HO-1, were elevated in rheumatoid arthritis patients without bone damage, suggesting HO-1 affects bone loss in humans. In summary, these data indicate that HO-1 negatively regulates osteoclastogenesis, leading to a positive net balance of bone."
https://openalex.org/W1985788058,"Keeping islands free of rats may be harder with isolated invaders as these evade conventional trapping. A single Norway rat released on to a rat-free island was not caught for more than four months, despite intensive efforts to trap it. The rat first explored the 9.5-hectare island and then swam 400 metres across open water to another rat-free island, evading capture for 18 weeks until an aggressive combination of detection and trapping methods were deployed simultaneously. The exceptional difficulty of this capture indicates that methods normally used to eradicate rats in dense populations are unlikely to be effective on small numbers, a finding that could have global implications for conservation on protected islands."
https://openalex.org/W2031740592,"The cellular prion protein (PrPc) is physiologically cleaved in the middle of its 106–126 amino acid neurotoxic region at the 110/111↓112 peptidyl bond, yielding an N-terminal fragment referred to as N1. We recently demonstrated that two disintegrins, namely ADAM10 and ADAM17 (TACE, tumor necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme) participated in both constitutive and protein kinase C-regulated generation of N1, respectively. These proteolytic events were strikingly reminiscent of those involved in the so-called “α-secretase pathway” that leads to the production of secreted sAPPα from βAPP. We show here, by transient and stable transfection analyses, that ADAM9 also participates in the constitutive secretion of N1 in HEK293 cells, TSM1 neurons, and mouse fibroblasts. Decreasing endogenous ADAM9 expression by an antisense approach drastically reduces both N1 and sAPPα recoveries. However, we establish that ADAM9 was unable to increase N1 and sAPPα productions after transient transfection in fibroblasts depleted of ADAM10. Accordingly, ADAM9 is unable to cleave a fluorimetric substrate of membrane-bound α-secretase activity in ADAM10-/- fibroblasts. However, we establish that co-expression of ADAM9 and ADAM10 in ADAM10-deficient fibroblasts leads to enhanced membrane-bound and released fluorimetric substrate hydrolyzing activity when compared with that observed after ADAM10 cDNA transfection alone in ADAM10-/- cells. Interestingly, we demonstrate that shedded ADAM10 displays the ability to cleave endogenous PrPc in fibroblasts. Altogether, these data provide evidence that ADAM9 is an important regulator of the physiological processing of PrPc and βAPP but that this enzyme acts indirectly, likely by contributing to the shedding of ADAM10. ADAM9 could therefore represent, besides ADAM10, another potential therapeutic target to enhance the breakdown of the 106–126 and Aβ toxic domains of the prion and βAPP proteins.

Human prion diseases include, among others, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, familial transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, as well as a few cases of iatrogenic transmission (3Glatzel M.

PrPsc corresponds to the abnormal conformation of an ubiquitous glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein called cellular prion (PrPc) that is mainly synthesized in the central nervous system (6Martins V.R. Brentani R.R. Neurochem. Int. 2002; 1223: 1-3Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7Weissmann C. Enari M. Klöhn P.-C. Rossi D. Flechsig E. Acta Neurobiol. Exp. 2002; 62: 153-166PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which PrPc is converted into PrPsc are not fully understood. However, it appears clearly that inoculation of PrPsc triggers pathology and ultimately cell death in mice only when PrPc is present in the host animal. Thus, PrPc null mice resist infection and toxicity exhibited by scrapie-enriched inoculates (8Büeler H. Aguzzi A. Sailer A. Greiner R. Autenried P. Aguet M. Weissmann C.

Classical means to regulate endogenous concentrations of proteins are either clearance/uptake or proteolytic catabolism. PrPc apparently undergoes distinct proteolytic events in normal and Creutzfeldt-Jakob-affected brains. In normal conditions, PrPc is endoproteolyzed mainly at the 110/111↓112 peptide bond (13Chen S.G. Teplow D.B. Parchi P. Teller J.K. Gambetti P. Autilio-Gambetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19173-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), leading to a secreted product referred to as N1. This cleavage is likely of importance because it occurs within the 106–126 domain of PrPc that is thought to convey intrinsic toxicity (14Forloni G. Angeretti N. Chiesa R. Monzani E. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Nature. 1993; 362: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 15Brown D.R. J.

Therefore, this cleavage could be seen as a physiological means to deplete cells of endogenous PrPc and its 106–126 associated toxicity. Interestingly, in the pathology, an additional major breakdown occurs upstream, at the 90↓91 peptidyl bond (13Chen S.G. Teplow D.B. Parchi P. Teller J.K. Gambetti P. Autilio-Gambetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19173-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Such “pathological” cleavage preserves the toxic potential of 106–126 that remains intact. We recently established that N1, the physiological cleavage product of PrPc, could be generated in cells upon constitutive and protein kinase C-mediated pathways (17Vincent B. Paitel E. Frobert Y. Lehmann S. Grassi J. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35612-35616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We identified ADAM10 and ADAM17, two members of the disintegrin and metalloprotease family (18Duffy M.J. Lynn D.J. Lloyd A.T. O'Shea C.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 89: 622-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), as the main enzymes responsible for constitutive and regulated production of N1, respectively (19Vincent B. Paitel E. Saftig P. Frobert Y. Hartmann D. de Strooper B. Grassi J. Lopez-Perez E. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37743-37746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The nature of the disintegrins involved in N1 formation together with the PKC regulation of this cleavage were strikingly reminiscent of those taking place on βAPP that ultimately leads to sAPPα secretion (20Suh Y.-H. Checler F. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 469-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Among the wide family of ADAM proteases, ADAM9 appeared as a likely candidate, particularly because this protease was suggested to contribute to sAPPα formation (21Koike H. Tomioka S. Sorimachi H. Saido T.C. Maruyama K. Okuyama A. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Ohno S. Suzuki K. Ishiura S. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 22Hotoda N. Koike H. Sasagawa N. Ishiura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, the close parallel between the α-secretases-generating sAPPα and N1 led us to postulate that ADAM9 could also contribute to N1 formation. Here we show that overexpression of ADAM9 in various cell systems including HEK293 cells, TSM neurons, and fibroblasts, all led to increased N1 production. Conversely, down-regulation of ADAM9 by an antisense approach drastically reduces N1 recovery. We also show that ADAM9-associated increase of N1 was abolished by ADAM10 deficiency and that ADAM9 contributed to the shedding of a catalytically active form of ADAM10. Altogether, our study indicates that ADAM9 indirectly contributes to the N1 production by acting upstream to ADAM10, likely by enhancing its shedding. Antibodies and Pharmacological Agents—SAF32 is a monoclonal antibody raised against the 79–92 residues of PrPc and has been characterized previously (23Demart S. Fournier J.G. Cremignon C. Frobert Y.

The construct was confirmed by sequence analysis. Stable Transfections—HEK293 cells overexpressing mouse ADAM9 or mouse ADAM9-antisense were obtained after transfection of 2 μgof the corresponding cDNAs with DAC30 reagent (Eurogentec).

Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed with the Prism software (Graphpad software, San Diego, CA) using the unpaired t test for pairwise comparisons. Transient and Stable Transfections of ADAM9 cDNA Increases N1 and sAPPα Recoveries in HEK293 Cells—We previously established that ADAM10 and ADAM17 contributed to the production of a 11/12-Da PrPc-related fragment referred to as N1 in HEK293 cells (19Vincent B. Paitel E. Saftig P. Frobert Y. Hartmann D. de Strooper B. Grassi J. Lopez-Perez E. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37743-37746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We examined whether transient transfection of murine ADAM9 cDNA could influence the recovery of N1. Western blot analysis of ADAM9 expression revealed two immunoreactive bands at 110 and 84 kDa (Fig. 1A) in agreement with a previous study (28Roghani M. Becherer J.D. Moss M.L. Atherton R.E. Erdjument-Bromage H. Arribas J. Blackburn K. Weskamp G. Tempst P. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3531-3540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) indicating that ADAM9 is first synthesized as a precursor, which is later processed (removal of inhibitory prodomain) by a proprotein convertase in the secretory pathway to yield the 84-kDa active form. Transfection of murine ADAM9 cDNA increases N1 recovery (Fig. 1, A and C) without significantly affecting PrPc-like immunoreactivity (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, ADAM9 transient transfection also drastically increases sAPPα recovery in βAPP-expressing HEK293 cells (Fig. 1, B and D), thereby confirming that in HEK293 cells, ADAM9 could participate to the α-secretase-mediated cleavage of βAPP as it did in COS cells and human glioblastoma A172 cells (21Koike H. Tomioka S. Sorimachi H. Saido T.C. Maruyama K. Okuyama A. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Ohno S. Suzuki K. Ishiura S. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 29Asai M. Hattori C. Szabo B. Sasagawa N. Maruyama K. Tanuma S.-i. Ishiura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). To confirm this finding, we stably transfected ADAM9 cDNA in HEK293 cells. A series of positive clones exhibited the expected expression pattern, i.e. the high molecular weight precursor of ADAM9 and mature ADAM9 (Fig. 2A). Clone #8 was selected for further experiments. Stably transfected cells secrete drastically higher amounts of N1 than mock-transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 2, B and C), while PrPc-like immunoreactivity was not affected (Fig. 2, B and D). N1 production in stably transfected ADAM9-expressing cells was significantly inhibited by the zinc-metalloprotease inhibitor o-phenanthroline, while AEBSF (a serine-protease inhibitor) and pepstatin (acidic protease inhibitor) were unable to affect N1 recovery (Fig. 3). Further analysis of the effect of disintegrin inhibitors indicated that BB3103 and, to a lesser extent, TAPI both reduced significantly ADAM9-induced increase in N1 production (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, in the presence of BB3103, ADAM9-associated increase of N1 production was fully abolished and N1 recovery returned to control secretion obtained with mock-transfected cells (Fig. 3, A and B). The rather selective pharmacological inhibitory spectrum of BB3103 toward disintegrins together with the extent of inhibition of N1 production triggered by this inhibitor suggest that PrPc undergoes little if any proteolysis at the 110–111↓112 site by proteases other than disintegrins. N1 and sAPPα Secretion Are Reduced by ADAM9 Antisense Strategy— To establish the contribution of endogenous ADAM9 to N1 formation, we have established HEK293 cells stably overexpressing ADAM9 antisense cDNA. Among the various clones displaying reduced ADAM9 expression, the one selected shows a 54% reduction in mature ADAM9-like immunoreactivity (Fig. 4A). Lowering ADAM9 expression led to a statistically significant reduction of N1 (Fig. 4, B and C) and sAPPα (Fig. 4, D and E) recoveries without altering endogenous PrPc (B)- and βAPP (D)-like immunoreactivities. Altogether, these data indicate that, as documented above for overexpressed ADAM9, endogenous ADAM9 contributed to N1 formation and to the α-secretase pathway yielding sAPPα in HEK293 cells. Transient Transfection of ADAM9 cDNA Increases N1 and sAPPα Recoveries in TSM1 Neurons and Fibroblasts—We examined whether the control of N1 production by ADAM9 was cell-specific. TSM1 is a neuronal cell line of neocortical origin (30Chun J. Jaenisch R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 304-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) in which N1 production had been documented (17Vincent B. Paitel E. Frobert Y. Lehmann S. Grassi J. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35612-35616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As expected, N1 was readily detectable in mock-transfected TSM1 neurons, the production of which was enhanced by ADAM9 transient expression (Fig. 5A). Similar experiments carried out with immortalized fibroblasts led to similar N1 increased recovery (Fig. 5B) indicating that ADAM9-associated increase of N1 was not cell-specific. It should be noted that in both cell types, ADAM9 transfection led to increased expressions of both pro-ADAM9 and ADAM9, indicating that in neurons and fibroblasts, ADAM9 was properly processed and, according to increased N1 production, fully catalytically functional. Transient Transfection of ADAM9 cDNA Increases N1 and sAPPα Productions in Wild-type but Not in ADAM10-/- Fibroblasts—Previous works demonstrated that the disintegrin metalloprotease ADAM10 had an α-secretase activity responsible for processing the amyloid precursor protein (31Lammich S.

Our study now clearly shows that ADAM9 contributes to the proteolytic processing of PrPc besides that of βAPP suggested previously (21Koike H. Tomioka S. Sorimachi H. Saido T.C. Maruyama K. Okuyama A. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Ohno S. Suzuki K. Ishiura S. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). However, our data did not establish whether catalysis triggered by ADAM9 was direct or indirect and one could not preclude a possible functional cross talk between disintegrins for PrPc and βAPP proteolysis. Thus, ADAM9 and ADAM10 could independently participate in both PrPc or βAPP processing or, alternatively, one of these enzymes could be rate-limiting for full functionality of the other. To answer this question, we took advantage of recently established ADAM10-/- fibroblasts cell line (26Hartmann D. De Strooper B. Serneels L. Craessaerts K. Herreman A. Annaert W. Umans L. Lübke U. Illert A.L. von Figura K. Saftig P. Hum. Mol. Gen. 2002; 11: 2615-2624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to assess whether the deletion of this enzyme could impair ADAM9-associated N1 and sAPPα productions. In wild-type fibroblasts, transient transfection of ADAM9 cDNA led to increased recoveries of released (but not intracellular) N1 (Fig. 6, A and B) and sAPPα (Fig. 7A) and full expression and maturation of ADAM9 (Fig. 6, C and D). In ADAM10-deficient fibroblasts, N1 (Fig. 6, A and"

In this study, a Chlamydomonas mutant, ida9, lacking inner arm dynein c was isolated and shown to carry a mutation in the DHC9 dynein heavy chain gene. The cDNA sequence of DHC9 was determined, and its information was used to show that >80% of it is lost in the mutant. Electron microscopy and image analysis showed that the ida9 axoneme lacked electron density near the base of the S2 radial spoke, indicating that dynein c localizes to this site. The mutant ida9 swam only slightly slower than the wild type in normal media. However, swimming velocity was greatly reduced when medium viscosity was modestly increased. Thus, dynein c in wild type axonemes must produce a significant force when flagella are beating in viscous media. Because motility analyses in vitro have shown that dynein c is the fastest among all the inner arm dyneins, we can regard this dynein as a fast yet powerful motor.

Cilia and flagella are cell organelles for motility and are conserved in a variety of eukaryotic organisms. In mammalian cells, ciliary and flagellar movements are particularly important in respiratory and reproductive processes and in the mechanism that determines left-right asymmetry in embryos (1Afzelius B.A. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 19: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 2Nonaka S. Tanaka Y. Okada Y. Takeda S. Harada A. Kanai Y. Kido M. Hirokawa N. Cell. 1998; 95: 829-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). The beating of cilia and flagella is driven by inner arm and outer arm dyneins, the molecular motors that produce sliding forces between outer doublet microtubules. Elucidation of the functional properties of dyneins should be the key to understanding the mechanism that produces axonemal beating. Structure and function of axonemal dyneins have been extensively studied with the green alga Chlamydomonas. Previous studies have shown that the inner arm and outer arm dyneins strikingly differ with regard to molecular composition and arrangement on the outer doublet microtubules (3Huang B. Piperno G. Luck D.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3091-3099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Goodenough U.W. Heuser J.E. J.

The outer arm dynein comprises a single kind of assembly composed of three dynein heavy chains (DHCs) 3The abbreviations used are: DHCdynein heavy chainAAAATPase with any other activity.3The abbreviations used are: DHCdynein heavy chainAAAATPase with any other activity. (Mr >500,000) and several smaller proteins. On the other hand, there are seven structurally different forms (subspecies) of inner arm dynein assemblies (7Kagami O. Kamiya R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 653-664Crossref Google Scholar). These are designated a-g. Subspecies a-e, and g each contain a single unique DHC and a few smaller proteins. In contrast, subspecies f, which is also known as I1, contains two distinct DHCs and several smaller proteins (for review see Refs. 8Witman G.B. Wilkerson C. King S.M. Hyams J.S. Lloyd C.W.

Rev. Cytol. 2002; 219: 115-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Thus, biochemical analyses of axonemes have identified eight DHCs altogether. However, analyses of the Chlamydomonas genome have identified 11 DHC genes, DHC1-DHC11, that can be assigned to inner arm dyneins (24Porter M.E. Knott J.A. Myster S.H. Farlow S.J. Genetics. 1996; 144: 569-585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Perrone C.A. Myster S.H. Bower R. O'Toole E.T. Porter M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2297-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, three more DHCs may be present in the axoneme as the heavy chains of yet unidentified inner arm dynein subspecies. In accordance with multiple subspecies, the inner arms are arranged in a complex manner within a repeating unit of 96 nm along the outer doublet microtubules (see Fig. 5i). This arrangement radically differs from the outer arms, which are linearly arranged at a regular interval of 24 nm (4Goodenough U.W. Heuser J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 2008-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 6Mastronarde D.N. O'Toole E.T. McDonald K.L. McIntosh J.R. J.

Different axonemal dyneins appear to differ in function also (12Kamiya R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 219: 115-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 15Brokaw C.J. Cell Motil.

Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 32: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For example, waveform analyses on dynein-deficient mutants suggest that the inner arm is important for producing a proper waveform, whereas the outer arm is important for beating at high frequency (18Brokaw C.J. Kamiya R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1987; 8: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Also, in vitro motility assays show that different dyneins translocate microtubules at significantly different velocities (7Kagami O. Kamiya R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 653-664Crossref Google Scholar, 19Kurimoto E. Kamiya R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1991; 19: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 20Smith E.F. Sale W.S. Cell Motil.

The presence of functionally different dyneins must be important for axonemal beating because mutant axonemes lacking certain combinations of dyneins, such as those simultaneously lacking outer arm dynein and some inner arm dyneins, completely lack motility. The question then arises as to how each kind of dynein specifically functions within the mechanism of axonemal beating. To achieve a better understanding of the function of each dynein species, we have been seeking to obtain Chlamydomonas mutants lacking specific dyneins. Various mutants deficient in outer arm dynein or inner arm dynein have already been isolated (TABLE ONE), and the findings with these mutants helped us to infer the specific function of particular dynein subspecies. However, except for mutants lacking subspecies e or f, mutants that lack a single species of inner arm dynein have yet to be isolated. We isolated a mutant (ida9) that lacks only subspecies c, a dynein that has been extensively used in recent biophysical studies (22Sakakibara H. Kojima H. Sakai Y. Katayama E. Oiwa K. Nature. 1999; 400: 586-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 23Burgess S.A. Walker M.L. Sakakibara H. Knight P.J Oiwa K. Nature. 2003; 421: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that ida9 carries a mutation in the DHC9 gene and determined the cDNA sequence of DHC9 and the localization of dynein c within the axoneme. This dynein appears to be particularly important for flagella to work against a viscous load.TABLE ONEMutants deficient in inner arm dynein Mutants known to have clear defects in inner arm dynein are shown.StrainMissing subspecies (complete, abcdefg)Mutated protein (gene)Referenceida1/pf9f1α (DHC1)5Kamiya R.

This strain was provided by Dr. Pete Lefebvre (University of Minnesota). ida9 was originally isolated as a mutant that swims slightly more slowly than the original A54-e18, as described below. We found that A54-e18 displayed somewhat poor motility compared with the standard 137c strain under the same cultural conditions. This made it difficult to identify the mutant phenotype of ida9 in progenies between ida9 and another strain derived from 137c. We therefore extensively removed A54-e18 background from ida9 by crossing it with the 137c strain five times. The resultant strain was used as ida9. Mating of this strain to 137c always produced a clear 1:1 segregation. Double mutants of ida9 with oda1 (25Kamiya R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2253-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), ida1, and ida4 (5Kamiya R. Kurimoto E. Muto E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) were produced using standard procedures (26Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Source Book. 1989; (pp., Academic Press, San Diego., CA): 1-780Google Scholar). Other strains used for genetic analyses were obtained from Dr. E. Harris of the Chlamydomonas Genetics Center (Department of Botany, Duke University, Durham, NC). Mutant Production—A Nit- strain, A54-e18, was mutagenized by insertional mutagenesis according to the method of Tam and Lefebvre (27Tam L. Lefebvre P.A. Genetics. 1993; 135: 375-384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A linearized plasmid DNA, pMN56, composed of the pUC119 vector sequence and the NIT1 gene, was used for transformation (28Fernandez E. Schnell R. Ranum L. Hussey S. Silflow C. Lefebvre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6449-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Each clone of Nit+ transformant was cultured in 96-well plates and observed with an inverted microscope. Colonies that displayed poor motility were saved. The mutant ida9 was selected from those colonies. Genetic Analysis—The genetic locus of ida9 was determined by tetrad analyses using standard procedures (26Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Source Book. 1989; (pp., Academic Press, San Diego., CA): 1-780Google Scholar). Southern Blot Analysis—DNA was isolated from wild type and ida9 using the method of Weeks et al. (29Weeks D.P. Beerman N. Griffith O.M. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 376-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The DNA was then digested with restriction enzymes, loaded on a 0.8% agarose gel, transferred to a BIO-DYNE B membrane (PALL), and hybridized with DHC probes. For detection of the DHC9 gene, its intron sequence was used as a specific probe. Sense primer 5′-GTGGTGTTCAACTGCTC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-GTTGAACGTCTTCACCT-3′ were designed after a partial cDNA sequence (219 bp) of DHC9 registered in GenBank™ (24Porter M.E. Knott J.A. Myster S.H. Farlow S.J. Genetics. 1996; 144: 569-585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence is located slightly downstream of the first P-loop motif conserved in all known DHCs. PCR using wild type genomic DNA and the above primers resulted in amplification of two different DHC genes, including one that contained an intron sequence of DHC9. A DHC9-specific probe was obtained during a second round of PCR using the product from the first round of PCR as a template along with sense primer 5′-CGTCTTCACCTTGAGCGCCT-3′, and antisense primer 5′-CGTCTTCACCTTGAGCGCCT-3′ (see Fig. 2a, fragment A). Determination of the cDNA Sequence of DHC9—When this study was being carried out, the Chlamydomonas genome data base contained the full-length genomic sequences for almost all inner arm DHC genes but only a partial sequence for the DHC9 gene. The short genomic sequence from an intron of the DHC9 gene (probe A; see “Results”) was contained in scaffold 1357 of the genome data base version 1. This scaffold contained a partial sequence of DHC9 up to the fourth AAA motif (AAA4; supplemental Fig. S2). Four cDNA fragments (see Fig. 2a, fragments E-H) were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR using primers designed from the predicted exon sequences in this scaffold. Sense and antisense primers for each fragment are as follows: fragment E, 5′-CGGAGGTGCTGGACAATTTCGCGCG-3′ and 5′-TGATGAGCGGCAGGTGCTC-3′; fragment F, 5′-GAGCACCTGCCGCTCATCA-3′ and 5′-GCAGAGTGCCCGCAACCCTT-3′; Fragment G, 5′-GAGCACCTGCCGCTCATCA-3′ and 5′-GTTGAACGTCTTCACCT-3′; and Fragment H, 5′-GTTACGAGTACCTAGGCAACA-3′ and 5′-GCGGAACAGCACCAGGTTCA-3′. A fragment containing the 5′-terminal sequence (see Fig. 2a, fragment D) was amplified by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (30Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2001; (pp., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 54-60Google Scholar). The 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends antisense primer was 5′-GAAGAGCGATCGGTCGTTCAGCAC-3′. The cDNA used had been synthesized using Superscript III (Stratagene) from poly(A)+ RNA trapped on the poly T-anchored magnet beads (DYNABEADS oligo(dT)25, DYNAL Biotech.). Total RNA of wild type used for isolation of poly(A)+ RNA was prepared by acid guanidium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction (31Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62898) Google Scholar). To determine the sequence downstream of the AAA4 domain, we took advantage of a consensus sequence for inner arm dynein genes (DHC2-8 and DHC11) present in the AAA6 domain (see supplemental Fig. S2). Reverse transcription-PCR performed using a DHC9-specific forward primer (5′-CACGAGGTGCTCCGAGTCTTC-3′) and the consensus reverse primer (5′-GCCAGGTGGCAGTCTGCAG-3′) amplified a sequence (fragment I), part of which was contained in scaffold 919 of the genome data base version 2 (see Fig. 2a). Finally, the sequence of the 3′-terminal part of DHC9 cDNA was determined using the information of scaffold 919 (see Fig. 2a, fragments J and K). Fragment J was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR with forward and reverse primers of 5′-AACATCCGGAGGACGAGAG-3′ and 5′-TACTACCCGCAAACCTGAACCCA-3′ and fragment K with 5′-GCGGGGATAGATGGAAGC-3′ and 5′-TACTACCCGCAAACCTGAACCCA-3′. The presence and absence of different parts of the DHC9 sequence in the ida9 genome was examined by Southern blot using fragments A, B, C, F, and K as probes (indicated in Fig. 2a). Analysis of Deduced Amino Acid Sequence of DHC9—Multiple alignment analysis was performed using the Clustal W program (www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/search/clustalw-e.html). The amino acid sequences used as cytoplasmic dynein 1α DHC and inner arm DHCs other than DHC1, DHC9, and DHC10 were those predicted from their genomic sequences on the Chlamydomonas genome data bases (version 1, genome.jgi-psf.org/chlre1/chlre1.home.html, and version 2, genome.jgi-psf.org/chlre2/chlre2.home.html). Amino acid sequence comparison between DHC9 and other DHCs were performed using the DOTMATCHER program (bioweb.pasteur.fr/seqanal/interfaces/dotmatcher.html) with a window size set at 50 and a threshold at 18. Prediction of coiled-coil motifs in the deduced amino acid sequence was performed using the COILS program (www.ch.embnet.org/software/COILS_form.html). Isolation of Axonemes and Fractionation of Dynein—The culture of cells, isolation of flagella, preparation of crude dynein extracts, and fractionation of dynein subspecies by high pressure liquid chromatography on a Mono Q column were carried out as described previously (7Kagami O. Kamiya R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 653-664Crossref Google Scholar). Electrophoresis—The composition of dynein heavy chains was analyzed by SDS-PAGE with a 3-5% polyacrylamide gradient and a 3-8 m urea gradient (7Kagami O. Kamiya R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 653-664Crossref Google Scholar). For analysis of the intermediate chains and low molecular weight chains, a 5-20% acrylamide gradient was also used. All of the gels were stained with silver (32Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3722) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—Axoneme samples were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in the presence of 2% tannic acid, post-fixed with 1% OsO4, dehydrated through a series of ethanol solutions, and embedded in Epon 812. Gray/silver sections ∼50-nm-thick were cut, double-stained with uranylacetate and lead citrate, and then observed with a JEM100C microscope (Jeol Co., Tokyo, Japan) at a magnification of ×25,000. To ensure that the longitudinal section of the axoneme under observation contained an entire set of inner arm dyneins, we photographed axonemal images that clearly showed both outer arm dyneins and the central pair microtubules (6Mastronarde D.N. O'Toole E.T. McDonald K.L. McIntosh J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1145-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). For image analysis, the negatives were first digitized with a LeafScan 2.2 scanner at a resolution of 5 μm (corresponding to 0.2 nm). The images were selected according to the clarity of the outer arms, central pairs, and radial spokes present in pairs per every repeat length. Appropriate axonemal images were separated into overlapping segments containing six outer arm images on one side, i.e. segments about 144 nm in length corresponding to 1.5 times the 96-nm repeat length of the axoneme. The segments were classified into two mirror image-related groups based on the shape of the outer arms. Next, to objectively select representative images, pair-wise correlations were made between all of the segments in each group; the images were classified into two or three groups by clustering analysis using the inverse of the cross-correlation coefficient as the “distance” between the two images (33Yoshida T.

Average images were produced from images that form the largest cluster in one group, together with the reversed images of those forming the largest cluster in the mirror image related group. In this way, the initial average images were obtained from 145 wild type images (selected from a total of 174 images), 98 ida9 images (selected from 134 images), and 58 ida4 images (selected from 64 images). For refinement, correlation was calculated between each of the original images and the averaged images. The images that showed high correlation coefficients (with >0.65 cross-correlation coefficients with the average) were selected and used to produce the final averaged image. After this refinement procedure was repeated three times, the final averaged images for wild type, ida9, and ida4 axonemes were obtained from 90, 75, and 40 images, respectively. The statistical significance between these averaged images was assessed by t test. All of the calculations were carried out using Eos software (34Yasunaga T. Wakabayashi T. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Motility Assessment—A dark field microscope at a total magnification of ×100, a video recording system, and a personal computer were used to measure the swimming velocities of the mutant and wild type cells. A red filter with a cut-off wavelength of 630 nm was placed under the condenser lens to facilitate measurement by suppressing cellular response to light. Fifty samples, in fresh TAP medium, were measured to obtain the average velocity of a given sample. For the measurement of propulsive force at different viscosities, the medium viscosity was varied by dissolving 0-16% (w/v) Ficoll (Type 400, Sigma; Mr = 400,000) (35Minoura I. Kamiya R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 31: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Final viscosity was measured with an Ostwald viscometer. Propulsive force was estimated using Stokes' formula F = 6πηav, where η is the medium viscosity, a is the cell body radius as approximated by a sphere, and v is the swimming velocity of the cell. Flagellar beat frequencies in swimming cells were measured as described (36Kamiya R. Methods. 2000; 22: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In brief, microscope images of swimming cells were projected onto a graded filter, and the intensity fluctuation of the light transmitted through the filter was analyzed with a photo detector and a fast Fourier transform analyzer. This method yields an approximate average of the beat frequencies in a large population of cells. Isolation and Genetic Analyses of ida9—From about 7500 clones of Nit+ transformants, we isolated 53 clones of cells that swam more slowly than the parent strain (A54-e18). Axonemes were prepared from all clones and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. About half of the axonemes showed defects in either outer arm or inner arm DHC bands. The mutant ida9 axoneme showed a difference in the pattern of inner arm DHC bands (data not shown). Genetic crosses with its parent strain resulted in a 1:1 segregation of the slowly swimming phenotypes in 31 dissected tetrads. All slowly swimming daughter cells were found to be Nit+, i.e. able to grow on medium containing NO3− as the sole nitrogen source. These observations were indicative of a mutation produced by insertion of the plasmid containing the NIT1 gene. Southern blot analysis indicated that this mutant carried a single insertion of the plasmid, which was slightly shortened from the original length after incorporation (data not shown). Our attempts to recover the plasmid sequence from the ida9 genome were unsuccessful. Through genetic crosses with various mutants, the ida9 mutation was mapped to linkage group XVI/XVII, 2.2 centimorgan to the left of the centromere (parental ditype: nonparental ditype:tetra type = 43:0:2 for ida9 × y1a and 48:0:9 for ida9 × ac46). Composition of Inner Arm DHC—To examine the dynein composition, we analyzed a high salt extract of the ida9 axoneme using ion exchange chromatography with a Mono Q column, an efficient procedure for separating different species of dynein (7Kagami O. Kamiya R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 653-664Crossref Google Scholar, 37Goodenough U.W. Gebhart B. Mermall V. Mitchell D.R. Heuser J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194: 481-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1a, the elution pattern from the ida9 extract showed a significant reduction in peak c. A similar reduction was observed in the axonemal extract of double mutant ida9oda1 when compared with the extract from the oda1 axoneme. The reduction in peak c was confirmed using two different samples each of ida9 and ida9oda1 axonemes. Previous biochemical analyses indicated that dynein subspecies c is composed of a single heavy chain associated with actin and a 28-kDa protein (p28) (7Kagami O. Kamiya R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 653-664Crossref Google Scholar, 38LeDizet M. Piperno G. Mol. Boil. Cell. 1995; 6: 697-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 39Yanagisawa H.A. Kamiya R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) that may function in targeting of dynein to specific sites on the outer doublet microtubules (39Yanagisawa H.A. Kamiya R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE of the separated fractions showed that fraction c had only faint DHC bands with mobilities identical to those of the DHCs present in adjacent fractions (Fig. 1b). In two samples of ida9 axonemes, the intensity of the DHC band corresponding to subspecies c was always less than 10% of the band intensity in wild type, as estimated by densitometry (data not shown). It is likely that the faint DHC band appearing in fraction c was derived from the DHC of subspecies b predominantly contained in the adjacent peak. In accordance with the absence of an inner arm dynein subspecies, actin and p28 were also greatly reduced in this fraction (Fig. 1c); these faint actin and p28 bands were probably also derived from those contained in the adjacent peaks. From these observations, we suspected that the ida9 axoneme lacks inner arm dynein subspecies c. The small peak in the fraction c appearing in the elution patterns of the ida9 and ida9oda1 extracts was probably due to an unknown, non-dynein component. SDS-PAGE patterns indicated that other inner arm dynein subspecies were present in apparently normal amounts (Fig. 1, b and c). ida9 Has a Mutation in the DHC9 Gene—A dynein heavy chain gene, DHC9, has been mapped to linkage group XVI/XVII (24Porter M.E. Knott J.A. Myster S.H. Farlow S.J. Genetics. 1996; 144: 569-585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the linkage group to which IDA9 was mapped. Therefore, we speculated that ida9 might carry a mutation in this gene. To test this possibility by Southern blotting, we first isolated a genomic fragment to be used as a probe for the DHC9 gene. PCR using genomic DNA and primers designed after the registered sequence of DHC9 cDNA (24Porter M.E. Knott J.A. Myster S.H. Farlow S.J. Genetics. 1996; 144: 569-585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”) resulted in amplification of two products of different sizes. Sequence analysis of the products indicated that the smaller one (∼300 bp) was derived from DHC2 genomic sequence, and the larger one (∼600 bp) contained a registered DHC9 cDNA sequence and an inserted sequence (219 bp) other than the DHC9 sequence. Recently released data from the Chlamydomonas genome project (genome.jgi-psf.org/chlre2/chlre2.home.html) indicated that the inserted sequence was an intron in the DHC9 gene. We used this intron sequence as a specific probe for DHC9 (Fig. 2a, probe A). Southern blot with the specific probe clearly indicated hybridization with bands in wild type DNA, whereas the same band was missing in ida9 DNA (Fig. 2b, probe A). The state of the DHC9 gene in ida9 was further examined using probes for different parts of this gene. For this purpose, the entire cDNA sequence of DHC9 was determined using the information from Chlamydomonas genome project (“Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 2a shows the relationship between the determined cDNA and the genomic sequence (contained in two scaffolds). Southern blot with probes for the C-terminal 80% of the molecule (fragments A, B, C, and K) showed hybridizing bands in wild type DNA but not in ida9 DNA (Fig. 2b). In contrast, Southern blot with a probe for the N-terminal sequence (fragment F) detected bands in the ida9 genome with mobilities different from those in wild type (Fig. 2b). B"

Genetic and biochemical studies have identified four membrane proteins as components of γ-secretase: heterodimeric presenilin composed of its N- and C-terminal fragments, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2. Here we demonstrated that certain compounds, including protein kinase inhibitors and their derivatives, act directly on purified γ-secretase to selectively block cleavage of APP- but not Notch-based substrates. Moreover, ATP activated the generation of the APP intracellular domain and Aβ, but not the generation of the Notch intracellular domain by the purified protease complex, and was a direct competitor of the APP-selective inhibitors, as were other nucleotides. In accord, purified γ-secretase bound specifically to an ATP-linked resin. Finally, a photoactivable ATP analog specifically labeled presenilin 1-C-terminal fragments in purified γ-secretase preparations; the labeling was blocked by ATP itself and APP-selective γ-secretase inhibitors. We concluded that a nucleotide-binding site exists within γ-secretase, and certain compounds that bind to this site can specifically modulate the generation of Aβ while sparing Notch. Drugs targeting the γ-secretase nucleotide-binding site represent an attractive strategy for safely treating Alzheimer disease. γ-Secretase is an unusual protease with an intramembrane catalytic site that cleaves many type I membrane proteins, including the amyloid β-protein (Aβ) precursor (APP) and the Notch receptor.

Ilagan M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). We recently reported a specific and reproducible procedure for the high grade purification of active human γ-secretase and characterized various factors that affect its activity in vitro (6Fraering P.C.

In further investigating the properties of the purified enzyme, we have observed that ATP can activate purified γ-secretase in vitro by up to 2-fold. This observation is in agreement with the recent report of Netzer et al. (7Netzer W.J. Dou F. Cai D. Veach D. Jean S. Li Y. Bornmann W.G. Clarkson B. Xu H. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Inhibitors—Powder containing Gleevec (Novartis) was dissolved from capsules or tablets in a mixture composed of ethyl acetate and aqueous saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. The organic layer was washed several times with brine, dried on sodium sulfate, and evaporated under vacuum.

For the photoaffinity labeling of the purified γ-secretase, the enzyme was diluted 10-fold from stock (6Fraering P.C. Ye W. Strub J.M. Dolios G. LaVoie M.J. Ostaszewski B.L. Van Dorsselaer A. Wang R.

The samples were exposed to UV light for 5 min (hand-held UV lamp at 254 nm; UVP model UVGL-25) on ice, and the reaction was quenched with 1 mm dithiothreitol. The proteins were diluted in 0.5% CHAPSO/HEPES buffer and incubated overnight for affinity precipitation with GSH resin as described previously (6Fraering P.C. Ye W. Strub J.M. Dolios G. LaVoie M.J.

The unbound nucleotides were removed by washing the resin three times and then the washed proteins were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. For the photoaffinity labeling of the purified γ-secretase followed by the BN-PAGE analysis, the enzyme was diluted in 0.1% digitonin/TBS, exposed to UV light for 5 min, and directly loaded onto a 5–13.5% BN-polyacrylamide gel. For the photoaffinity labeling of endogenous γ-secretase, HeLa S3 membranes (the equivalent of 3.0 × 108 cells) were incubated with 22.5 μm 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi per reaction), 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm CaCl2 in a total volume of 60 μl for 10 min at 37 °C. The resuspended membranes were exposed to UV light as described above. The unbound nucleotides were removed by washing the membranes three times and then the washed membranes were resuspended for 1 h in 0.5 ml of 1% CHAPSO/HEPES, pH 7.4. The solubilized proteins were diluted 1:2 in HEPES buffer (final CHAPSO concentration = 0.5%) and incubated overnight with X81 antibody for immunoprecipitation, as described previously (6Fraering P.C.

Samples were electrophoresed on 4–20% Tris-glycine gels and autoradiographed (BioMax MS films used with BioMax Transcreen HE (Eastman Kodak Co.)). ATPase Assays—[α-32P]ATP (11.9 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Affinity Labeling Technology (Lexington, KY). The purified γ-secretase was prepared as described for the photoaffinity labeling experiments; 5 μCi of [α-32P]ATP was added; the reactions were incubated at 37 °C, and at the indicated time points aliquots were removed and reactions stopped by addition of 10% SDS. A total of 2 μl of each stopped reaction was analyzed by TLC on polyethyleneimine cellulose plastic sheets (Baker-Flex, Germany) with 0.75 m KH2PO4, pH 3.5, as the running buffer to separate ATP from ADP. To identify hydrolysis products, a reaction of [α-32P]ATP incubated in the presence of 0.005 units of canine kidney phosphatase (Sigma) was loaded. Samples were autoradiographed as described above. Nonhydrolyzed ATP Can Activate the Generation of AICD and Aβ but Not the Generation of NICD by Purified γ-Secretase—We took advantage of our highly purified γ-secretase complexes to investigate factors that might affect the cleavage of APP, using a C100FLAG substrate consisting of the β-CTF (C99) portion of APP (amino acids 596–695) plus a Met at the N terminus and a FLAG tag at the C terminus (4Esler W.P. Kimberly W.T. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Diehl T.S. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2720-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 24Li Y.M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6138-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). We observed that increased concentrations of ATP promoted a dose-dependent rise in the production of both AICD-FLAG (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 2–6 with lane 1) and Aβ (both Aβ40 and Aβ42), reaching an ∼1.75-fold increase at 1–5 mm as estimated by Aβ ELISA (Fig. 1B). Densitometry of the AICD-FLAG bands (Fig. 1A) showed that the fold increases were similar to those seen for Aβ by ELISA in Fig. 1B. These findings are in good agreement with the reported data of Netzer et al. (7Netzer W.J. Dou F. Cai D. Veach D. Jean S. Li Y. Bornmann W.G. Clarkson B. Xu H. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12444-12449Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), which showed that the addition of 1–3 mm ATP in a cell-free membrane preparation (derived from mouse N2a cells expressing human APP-695) results in an ∼2-fold increase in Aβ production. Next, we addressed whether ATP can stimulate the cleavage of a Notch-based substrate (N100FLAG) in a similar manner and under the same conditions as for C100FLAG. N100FLAG is an analogous Notch-based substrate corresponding to residues Val-1711 to Glu-1809 from the mouse Notch-1 receptor (plus a Met and a FLAG tag at the N and C termini, respectively, just like C100) (21Kimberly W.T. Esler W.P. Ye W. Ostaszewski B.L. Gao J. Diehl T. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We found that increased concentrations of ATP did not alter the generation of NICD-FLAG (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 2–6 with lane 1), and this was confirmed by densitometry. ATP stores energy in the form of a chemical bond and releases it in the process of hydrolysis, providing a readily available energy supply for many enzymatic reactions. Thus, we intended to determine whether the peptidase activity of γ-secretase is associated with ATP hydrolysis. As shown in Fig. 1C, the purified γ-secretase incubated in the presence (lanes 21–25) or absence (lanes 6–10) of C100FLAG substrate did not increase the hydrolysis of [α-32P]ATP into [α-32P]ADP when compared with the hydrolysis occurring in the reaction buffer alone (lanes 11–15). This result indicates that ATP hydrolysis is not required for the peptidase activity of γ-secretase. We further found that 1 mm levels of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, ATPγS, also resulted in an ∼1.35 increase in the generation of Aβ40 and Aβ42 from C100FLAG substrate by purified γ-secretase (data not shown), supporting our observation that ATP hydrolysis is not required for the effect. Gleevec Itself Is Not a Direct γ-Secretase Inhibitor; However, a Gleevec Extract Inhibits the Generation of Aβ by Purified γ-Secretase Without Affecting the Cleavage of a Notch-based Recombinant Substrate—Because ATP activated the purified γ-secretase complex (Fig. 1, A and B), we used this preparation to examine the effects of a Gleevec extract (prepared from capsules and characterized as described in detail under “Materials and Methods”) on the cleavage efficiency of C100FLAG substrate. We first confirmed that III-31C (4Esler W.P. Kimberly W.T. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Diehl T.S. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurochem. 2001; 76: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), two well characterized inhibitors of γ-secretase, inhibited both C100FLAG and N100FLAG cleavage by our purified γ-secretase with similar potencies (III-31C, IC50 of ∼50 nm for cleavage of C100FLAG, as estimated by ELISA and densitometry, and ∼100 nm for cleavage of N100FLAG, as estimated by densitometry; DAPT, IC50 of ∼100 nm for cleavage of C100FLAG, as estimated by ELISA and densitometry, and ∼100 nm for cleavage of N100FLAG, as estimated by densitometry) (Fig. 2A, and ELISA data not shown). We then probed the effects of our Gleevec extract (extracted from capsules and isolated by HPLC as described under “Materials and Methods”) on Aβ production by the purified γ-secretase. The cleavage products, Met-Aβ40 and Met-Aβ42, (which we designate Aβ40 and Aβ42 for simplicity) were quantified by ELISA (Fig. 2B) and also detected by blotting with the 6E10 anti-Aβ antibody (Fig. 2C). The other proteolytic product, FLAG-tagged AICD, was detected with anti-FLAG M2 antibodies (Fig. 2C). Our Gleevec extract inhibited the generation of Aβ40, Aβ42, and AICD in a concentration-dependent fashion and with a similar potency, yielding an approximate IC50 value (estimated by Aβ ELISA) of ∼75 μm (Fig. 2, B and C). Next, we examined the effects of our Gleevec extract on the cleavage of N100FLAG by the purified protease. The Gleevec extract did not inhibit the generation of NICD-FLAG, even at concentrations >10-fold the IC50 value for the generation of Aβ40 and Aβ42 from C100FLAG substrate (i.e. at 1 mm) (Fig. 2C, lane 7). Similarly, the Gleevec extract was found to inhibit the generation of Aβ by endogenous γ-secretase solubilized from HeLa cell membranes without affecting the cleavage of N100FLAG substrate (Fig. 2D). Because pH is an important factor modulating the activity of the purified γ-secretase (6Fraering P.C. Ye W. Strub J.M. Dolios G. LaVoie M.J. Ostaszewski B.L. Van Dorsselaer A. Wang R. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9774-9789Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), the pH of all the above reactions was checked and found to be consistently at pH 7.4, even at high concentrations (1 mm) of the Gleevec extract. Because several other compounds (impurities or degradation products probably generated during the extraction and purification procedures, m/z of 200.1, 247.6, 268.2, 277.1, 286.6, 308.9, 332.9, 350.0, 380.1, 395.1, and 516.2) were detected in the Gleevec preparation (Fig. 2E, left panel and data not shown), we decided to examine the effect on the purified γ-secretase of two additional Gleevec samples prepared from two different sources as follows: Gleevec extracted from tablets as described in detail under “Materials and Methods” and purified Gleevec (Sequoia Research Products, UK). Final purity of the two Gleevec samples described above was addressed by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy (Fig. 2E, middle and right panels, respectively). We found that these two Gleevec samples did not inhibit the generation of AICD, Aβ40, and Aβ42 by the purified γ-secretase (Fig. 2E, middle and right panels, respectively, and ELISA data not shown). Because Gleevec (m/z of (M + H)+ = 494) was found in the three different Gleevec samples, our data strongly suggest that Gleevec is not the active compound found in the Gleevec preparation extracted from capsules. Most interestingly, the analyses by mass spectroscopy of the three Gleevec samples revealed several compounds (m/z of 200.1, 308.9, 332.9, 350.0, and 516.2) that were only present in the active Gleevec preparation (Fig. 2E, the compounds identified specifically in the active Gleevec preparation are labeled with arrowheads), leaving open the possibility that one or more of those compounds are active toward γ-secretase. Also, a very minor peak at 286.6 in the inactive extract is a major peak in the active extract (Fig. 2E, asterisk). Although purification and characterization of each of the compounds found in our active Gleevec extract will now be necessary for the identificatio"

There, it is internalized into vesicular carriers undergoing fast retrograde transport to the spinal cord. Despite the importance of this axonal transport pathway in health and disease, its molecular and biophysical characterization is presently lacking. We sought to fill this gap by determining the pH regulation of this compartment in living motor neurons using a chimera of the tetanus toxin binding fragment (TeNT HC) and a pH-sensitive variant of the green fluorescent protein (ratiometric pHluorin). We have demonstrated that moving retrograde carriers display a narrow range of neutral pH values, which is kept constant during transport.

This distinct pH regulation is due to a differential targeting of the vacuolar (H+) ATPase, which is not present on moving TeNT HC compartments. Accordingly, inhibition of the vacuolar (H+) ATPase under conditions that completely abolish the intracellular accumulation of acidotrophic dyes does not affect axonal retrograde transport of TeNT HC.However, a functional vacuolar (H+) ATPase is required for early steps of TeNT HC trafficking following endocytosis, and it is localized to axonal vesicles containing TeNT HC. Altogether, these findings indicate that the vacuolar (H+) ATPase plays a specific role in early sorting events directing TeNT HC to axonal carriers but not in their subsequent progression along the retrograde transport route, which escapes acidification and targeting to degradative organelles.

They all share an identical structural organization, comprising a 100-kDa heavy (H) chain and a 50-kDa light (L) chain linked via a disulfide bond and other noncovalent interactions (1Schiavo G.

Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 427-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1a). The carboxyl-terminal part of the heavy chain (HC, 50 kDa) is responsible for membrane binding and internalization, whereas the amino-terminal domain (HN, 50 kDa) mediates membrane translocation of the L chain into the cytosol (1Schiavo G. Matteoli M. Montecucco C. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 717-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar, 3Herreros J. Lalli G. Montecucco C. Schiavo G. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1941-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The L chain is a highly specific zinc endoprotease, which is responsible for the cleavage of synaptic SNARE proteins necessary for neurotransmitter release (2Humeau Y. Doussau F. Grant N.J. Poulain B. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 427-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). TeNT binds to motor neurons (MNs) at the neuromuscular junction. Upon internalization, TeNT is retrogradely transported toward the MN cell body, where it is released into the extracellular medium and enters adjacent inhibitory interneurons (4Stöckel K. Schwab M. Thoenen H. Brain Res. 1975; 99: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In these cells, TeNT blocks the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters by cleaving VAMP/synaptobrevin, a member of the SNARE superfamily (1Schiavo G. Matteoli M. Montecucco C. Physiol.

TeNT HC shares this compartment with the nerve growth factor and the low affinity neurotrophin receptor p75NTR (5Lalli G. Schiavo G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These findings validate TeNT HC as an ideal tool for dissecting the molecular machinery controlling axonal retrograde transport and the trafficking of neurotrophin receptors and their ligands in living MNs. To date, the precise characterization of the intraluminal pH of this axonal retrograde pathway and its relevance in the regulation of transport in MNs remain unclear. These features are particularly important, because acidic pH triggers a conformational change in TeNT and other CNTs, allowing the active subunit to translocate through the endosomal membrane into the cytosol (9Montecucco C. Papini E. Schiavo G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 10Williamson L.C. Neale E.A. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 2342-2345Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Moreover, acidic pH is known to drive the dissociations of ligands, including growth factors, from their receptors and influence their signaling and intracellular targeting (11Tycko B. Keith C.H. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1762-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 12Balbis A. Baquiran G. Dumas V. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12777-12785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We sought to address these important questions by preparing chimeras of TeNT HC and ratiometric pHluorin, a pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein mutant (13Miesenbock G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1998; 394: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). Several pH-sensitive variants of green fluorescent protein have been developed by independent mutagenesis approaches and used as pH reporters to follow vesicular transport dynamics (14Yuste R. Miller R.B. Holthoff K. Zhang S. Miesenbock G. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 522-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15Ashby M.C. Ibaraki K. Henley J.M. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 257-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Whereas the wild-type green fluorescent protein has a largely unaltered spectrum between pH 5.5 and 10, the excitation spectrum of the ratiometric pHluorin shows two main peaks at 395 and 475 nm, the intensity of which reciprocally varies as a function of pH because of the protonation of its chromophore (13Miesenbock G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1998; 394: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that moving axonal retrograde TeNT HC carriers display a neutral pH, which is kept constant during transport. In contrast, stationary TeNT HC organelles located in axons and in somas exhibit a wide range of pH values. The distinct pH regulation of these compartments is due to a differential targeting of the vacuolar (H+) ATPase (vATPase), which activity is required for early events in the formation and/or sorting of axonal TeNT HC vesicles but not for their subsequent axonal transport.

This vector and the insert encoding ratiometric pHluorin, obtained by treating the pGEX-2T-AF058694 construct (13Miesenbock G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E.

The resulting pGEX-4T-3-VSV-G-Kin-pHluorin-TeNT HC construct was shown to correspond to the published TeNT HC and pHluorin sequences, except for the absence of the mutation L220F in the latter (13Miesenbock G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1998; 394: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). After transformation into FB810-competent bacteria, GST-VSV-G-Kin-pHluorin-TeNT HC and GST-pHluorin were expressed and purified as previously described (16Lalli G. Herreros J. Osborne S.L. Montecucco C. Rossetto R. Schiavo G. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2715-2724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cysteine-tagged TeNT HC was expressed using pGEX-4T3-Cys-TeNT HC and labeled with AlexaFluor-488-maleimide (Molecular Probes) as previously described (5Lalli G. Schiavo G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Fluorescent probes contained on average 1.8 mol of dye/mol of TeNT HC. Immunofluorescence and Western Blot Analysis—Primary MNs were isolated from Sprague-Dawley (embryonic day 14) rat embryos and cultured following previously described protocols (17Arce V.

Embryo-tested bovine serum albumin was dialyzed at 4 °C against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 24 h and then for a further 48 h against Leibovitz L-15 medium (Invitrogen), pH 7.3, using Spectra/Por membranes with a 25-kDa cutoff (Pierce). All experiments were performed using MNs differentiated for 5-8 days in vitro. For immunofluorescence (IF) experiments, MNs were incubated with either 15 μm DAMP (Oxford Biomedical Research; stock solution 3 mm) and/or 15 nm TeNT HC-AlexaFluor-488 for 2 or 45 min at 37 °C. The cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 20% sucrose in PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked with 2% embryo-tested bovine serum albumin, 0.25% porcine skin gelatin, 0.2% glycine, and 15% goat serum in PBS. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution and incubated with the fixed cells for 45 min at room temperature. DAMP was detected using monoclonal α-2,4-dinitrophenol or 2,4-dinitrophenyl for 45 min at room temperature (Oxford Biomedical Research). After rinsing, AlexaFluor goat α-mouse, α-rabbit, or α-chicken IgG (Molecular Probes) were diluted 1:300 in blocking solution and incubated for 30 min. After extensive washing, the coverslips were mounted with Mowiol 4-88 (Harco). Fluorescent images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope equipped with a Zeiss ×63, 1.40 numerical aperture, difference interference contrast Plan-Apochromat, oil immersion objective. A region of interest was chosen and simultaneously excited using the 488- and 543-nm lines of a krypton-argon and a helium-neon laser, respectively. Images were collected by averaging eight times at a single focal plane. The polyclonal rabbit α 31-kDa vATPase (a kind gift from Prof. S. Breton, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA) was used 1:300 for IF and 1:4,000 for Western blot (WB). The monoclonal α 60-kDa vATPase antibody (2E7; a kind gift from Prof. H. Sze, University of Maryland, College Park, MD) (18Ward J.M. Reinders A. Hsu H. Sze H. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) was diluted 1:10 for IF and 1:100 for WB. The chicken α 75-kDa vATPase (ATP6E; GenWay, San Diego, CA) was used 1:100 for IF and 1:1000 for WB. Polyclonal rabbit α 116-kDa vATPase (Synaptic Systems, Goettingen, Germany) was used 1:300 for IF and 1:3000 for WB. Rat brain extracts (100 μg/lane) were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with loading buffer, separated on a 12.5% SDS gel, and transferred onto nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell). After blocking for 1 h in PBS containing 5% skimmed milk, the membranes were incubated with primary antibody for 1 h in the same buffer, washed with PBS, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Immunoreactivity was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Endocytosis Assays—MNs were treated with 0.5 nm BafA1 for 15 min at 37 °C and then incubated for 30 min with VSV-G-Kin-TeNT HC (20 nm) or TeNT HC labeled with disulfide-linked biotin 3K. Deinhardt and G. Schiavo, unpublished results. (30 nm). After VSV-G-Kin-TeNT HC incubation, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and blocked with 2% embryo-tested bovine serum albumin, 0.25% porcine skin gelatin, 0.2% glycine, and 15% goat serum in PBS. The rabbit α-VSV-G tag antibody (BioGenes, Berlin, Germany) diluted 1:80 in blocking solution was incubated with the fixed cells for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed twice with PBS and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in blocking solution and blocked for a further 30 min. MNs were incubated with a primary mouse α-VSV-G (Cancer Research UK, London, UK) for 30 min, washed twice in PBS, incubated for 30 min with AlexaFluor goat α-mouse and α-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes), and diluted 1:300 in blocking solution. After extensive washing with PBS, coverslips were mounted with Mowiol 4-88. Alternatively, MNs incubated with TeNT HC-biotin were cooled on ice and then treated three times with ice-cold 20 mm sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate in neurobasal medium (Invitrogen), pH 8.3, for 15 min to cleave the biotin moiety from surface-bound TeNT HC. The cells were washed three times in neurobasal medium, pH 8.3, once in PBS fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and then blocked in blocking solution. TeNT HC-biotin was revealed using streptavidin-AlexaFluor-488 1:500 in blocking solution. The MNs were extensively washed in PBS and mounted in Mowiol 4-88. Fluorescence Excitation Spectra of pHluorin-TeNT HC in Vitro and in Vivo—Samples containing 0.5 μm pHluorin-TeNT HC or GST-pHluorin in 50 mm sodium cacodylate, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2 were adjusted to the indicated pH values with NaOH or HCl. Excitation spectrums (350-500 nm) were acquired using a 710 Photo-multiplier detection system (Photon Technology International) at a fixed emission of 508 nm. As expected, the fluorescence excitation spectrum of GST-pHluorin was identical to that of pHluorin-TeNT HC. MNs were incubated with 40 nm pHluorin-TeNT HC in neurobasal medium for 30 min at 37 °C and 7.5% CO2. The medium was then replaced with a buffer containing 120 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 20 mm HEPES, adjusted to a pH between 5.0 and 8.0 with NaOH or HCl. 20 min before imaging, the ionophores monensin and nigericin (both 10 μg/ml; Calbiochem), were added to equilibrate the intracellular pH to that of the external buffer (19Awaji T. Hirasawa A. Shirakawa H. Tsujimoto G. Miyazaki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The emission intensities of pHluorin-TeNT HC compartments in axons and soma were measured for each pH at 508 nm upon excitation at 405 and 488 nm. The background was then subtracted, and the corrected emission values for the 405 nm excitation were divided by the corresponding emission intensities obtained by exciting at 488 nm (R405/488). Microscopy and Data Quantification—To monitor fluid phase uptake, MNs were incubated with 6 μm GST-pHluorin in neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 37 °C and 7.5% CO2, washed with nonfluorescent Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (without phenol red), riboflavin, folic acid, penicillin/streptomycin, and supplemented with 30 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.3 (DMEM-), and immediately imaged by low light time lapse microscopy. Alternatively, MNs were transferred to neurobasal medium, incubated for a further 30 min, washed, and then imaged. MNs were incubated with 40 nm pHluorin-TeNT HC or 40 nm TeNT HC-AlexaFluor-488 in complete medium for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by three washes with DMEM-. The cells were placed in a humidified chamber maintained at 37 °C and after 20 min, imaged every 5 s. In selected samples, where axonal transport of TeNT HC-AlexaFluor-488 was observed, concanamycin A (ConA) (Alexis Biochemicals) or bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) (Alexis Biochemicals) were added at a final concentration of 10 and 0.5 nm, respectively, and the same cell was imaged after 5, 15, and 30 min of incubation. The ConA analysis shown in Fig. 4 is representative of five independent experiments using MNs from two different preparations, whereas the BafA1 effects have been evaluated in three independent experiments using MNs isolated from the same preparation. The functionality of the proton pump inhibitors was tested by applying 50 nm Lysotracker Red DND-99 (Molecular Probes) for 15 min on untreated MNs or MNs pre-incubated with either 10 nm ConA for 15 min or 0.5 nm BafA1 for 10 min and then imaged by confocal microscopy. For quantification purposes, the colocalization macro of the LSM510 software (Zeiss) has been used following the manufacturer's instructions. For pHluorin-TeNT HC, images were taken every 5 s with a Nikon Diaphot 300 inverted microscope equipped with a Nikon ×100, 1.3 numerical aperture Plan Fluor oil immersion objective. Specimens were sequentially excited at 488 and then at 405 nm for 333 ms using the excitation filters 485DF15, 4000DF10, the dichroic filter 490-575DBDR, and the emission filter 528-633DBDR (Omega Optical). Images were acquired with a Hamamatsu C4742-95 Orcal cooled charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu Photonic Systems) controlled by the Kinetic Acquisition Manager 2000 software (Kinetic Imaging). Two channel series were processed with Lucida, version 4.0 (Kinetic Imaging). For time lapse low light microscopy of TeNT HC-AlexaFluor-488-treated cells, images were acquired every 5 s with a Nikon Diaphot 200 inverted microscope equipped with Nikon ×100, 1.25 numerical aperture, difference interference contrast, oil immersion objective, using a standard Nikon B-2A filter and exposure times between 111 and 222 ms. The motion analysis software (Kinetic Imaging) was used for carrier tracking. Only moving carriers that could be tracked for at least four time points were analyzed. Single movements of TeNT HC carriers, which are described by their progress between two consecutive frames, were used to determine the speed of the carriers. Statistical analysis and curve fitting were performed using Microsoft Excel®. Single frame images were processed for presentation in Adobe® Photoshop®, version 5.5. Kymographs were generated using MetaMorph (Universal Imaging Corporation™) after rotation of the image stack to align the neuronal process vertically. Vertical single line scans through the center of each process were plotted sequentially for every frame in the time series. Axonal TeNT HC carriers have recently been shown to avoid accumulating the acidotrophic probe Lysotracker Red DND-99 in their lumen, suggesting that these organelles escape acidification (5Lalli G. Schiavo G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, no conclusions could be drawn from previous work about the pH dynamics of the retrograde transport compartment or its regulation in the axon and soma. To address this issue, we chose a strategy based on bacterially expressed ratiometric pHluorin fused with TeNT HC. First of all, we tested whether pHluorin still retains its described optical properties (13Miesenbock G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1998; 394: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar) once tagged to TeNT HC by diluting it with buffers ranging from pH 5.0 to 8.0 and monitoring its excitation spectrum at an emission wavelength of 508 nm (Fig. 1b). As expected, the fluorescence spectrum of pHluorin-TeNT HC shows two peaks at 395 and 475 nm. The 395-nm peak was more intense at a neutral pH and decreased at acidic pH values, whereas the 475-nm peak showed an opposite behavior. To establish a pH calibration curve in this system, MNs were pretreated with 40 nm pHluorin-TeNT HC at 37 °C for 30 min, washed, and then incubated with buffers at different pH values containing monensin and nigericin. Following treatment with these ionophores, all cellular compartments have been observed to re-equilibrate to the pH of the external medium (19Awaji T. Hirasawa A. Shirakawa H. Tsujimoto G. Miyazaki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Ratiometric images were taken, and the 405/488 ratios for each pH, averaged from randomly chosen pHluorin-TeNT HC-positive organelles in axons and somas (n = 24 to 52), were used to build a cellular calibration curve for pHluorin-TeNT HC (Fig. 1c). To test the ability of pHluorin to monitor pH in living cells, we incubated MNs with an excess of GST-pHluorin (6 μm) under conditions allowing the labeling of all endocytic compartments by fluid phase uptake. Following incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, MNs were washed and imaged immediately or after a 30-min chase. In the absence of chase, the labeled organelles (n = 119) showed a broad pH spectrum, ranging from acidic to neutral (Fig. 1d), which was in agreement with the pH heterogeneity observed experimentally in the endosomal pathway (20Weisz O.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2003; 226: 259-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This distribution drastically changed after a 30-min chase, when mainly acidic structures were observed (n = 96). Approximately 70% of the organelles had a luminal pH below 5.5 (Fig. 1d), which reflects the accumulation of GST-pHluorin in late endosomes and lysosomes (20Weisz O.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2003; 226: 259-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These combined results indicate that pHluorin can be used as a functional pH reporter to assess the pH of axonal retrograde carriers in our cellular system. To this end, we incubated rat MNs with 40 nm pHluorin-TeNT HC at 37 °C for 30 min. Binding experiments confirmed that pHluorin-TeNT HC binds specifically to the MN surface (data not shown), as reported for untagged TeNT HC (21Herreros J. Lalli G. Schiavo G. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The cells were then washed, and after 20 min, low light time lapse imaging started in the 488-nm channel, followed by the 405-nm channel. Ratiometric images (R405/488) were obtained from these two time series (Fig. 2a) (see also supplemental Video 1, a-c). The movement of a retrograde pHluorin-TeNT HC carrier is indicated by arrowheads, whereas a stationary compartment is labeled with asterisks (Fig. 2a). TeNT and TeNT HC have been shown to undergo axonal retrograde transport with a similar speed range both in vivo (0.8-3.6 μm/s) (4Stöckel K. Schwab M. Thoenen H. Brain Res. 1975; 99: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and in vitro (0.2-3.6 μm/s) (5Lalli G. Schiavo G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 6Lalli G. Gschmeissner S. Schiavo G. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4639-4650Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To investigate whether pHluorin-TeNT HC carriers are transported at the same rate as the TeNT compartments, we determined their speed distribution profile. Both the average speed and the overall curve shape observed for pHluorin-TeNT HC carriers fit well with the previously reported data (5Lalli G. Schiavo G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 6Lalli G. Gschmeissner S. Schiavo G. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4639-4650Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In particular, the average speed observed for round vesicles (n = 33, 402 movements) was 0.82 ± 0.25 μm/s, whereas tubules (n = 34, 334 movements) had an average speed of 1.18 ± 0.29 μm/s (supplemental Fig. S1). The pH dynamics of axonal retrograde carriers were then followed by monitoring the 405/488 emission ratio of TeNT HC compartments during transport. As shown in Fig. 2b, the pH of both types of carriers remained relatively constant during transport. Based on this finding, we then measured the pH of these organelles by ratiometric imaging only in the first frame of the videos, thus avoiding possible artifacts because of phototoxicity and photobleaching. To unravel a possible correlation between intraluminal pH and the average speed of axonal pHluorin-TeNT HC compartments, the velocity of the single movements (n = 735; 67 carriers) was plotted against their corresponding pH (Fig. 2c). The large majority of moving organelles was neutral, their pH falling in the 7.0-7.5 (42% of the total) or 7.5-8.0 range (26% of the total). This neutral population of axonal carriers included both round vesicles and tubules and presented a speed distribution profile overlapping with that observed previously (compare Fig. 2c with supplemental Fig. S1) (5Lalli G. Schiavo G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 6Lalli G. Gschmeissner S. Schiavo G. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4639-4650Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Only a few pHluorin-TeNT HC-positive compartments displayed a pH below 7.0 (14% of the total), whereas no moving carriers having an acidic pH (≤6.0) were detected. In sharp contrast, stationary pHluorin-TeNT HC-positive organelles in somas and axons displayed a wide range of pH values, from acidic to neutral (Fig. 2d). This result was confirmed by the partial co-localization of these stationary compartments in the soma with Lysotracker Red DND-99 using time lapse confocal microscopy (supplemental Fig. S2). Organelle acidification in the cell body has also been observed in real time, although with extremely low frequency (data not shown). What is the cause of the different pH distribution in moving and stationary pHluorin-TeNT HC-positive organelles? At least three formal explanations might account for this phenomenon: (i) the acidification machinery is excluded from or not acquired by transported organelles, (ii) its activity is specifically inhibited, or (iii) the axonal retrograde carriers containing TeNT HC rapidly dissipate the pH gradient due to a high permeability to protons. A major cellular complex involved in organelle acidification is the vATPase. vATPases are found on a variety of intracellular compartments, including clathrin-coated vesicles, synaptic vesicles, and secretory granules (22Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) and are responsible for the ac"

We have shown that it can grow on an H2/S° medium and produce H2S from sulfur in the later exponential phase. The complex carrying the sulfur reducing activity (electron transport from H2 to S°) has been purified and characterized. It is a membrane-bound multiprotein complex containing a [NiFe] hydrogenase and a sulfur reductase connected via quinones. The sulfur reductase is encoded by an operon annotated dms (dimethyl sulfoxide reductase) that we have renamed sre and is composed of three subunits. Sequence analysis showed that it belongs to the Me2SO reductase molybdoenzyme family and is similar to the sulfur/polysulfide/thiosulfate/tetrathionate reductases. The study of catalytic properties clearly demonstrated that it can reduce tetrathionate, sulfur, and polysulfide, but cannot reduce Me2SO and thiosulfate, and that NADPH increases the sulfur reducing activity. To date, this is the first characterization of a supercomplex from a bacterium that couples hydrogen oxidation and sulfur reduction. The distinctive feature in A. aeolicus is the cytoplasmic localization of the sulfur reduction, which is in accordance with the presence of sulfur globules in the cytoplasm. Association of this sulfur-reducing complex with a hydrogen-oxygen pathway complex (hydrogenase I, bc1 complex) in the membrane suggests that subcomplexes involved in respiratory chains in this bacterium are part of supramolecular organization.

The production of biomass in extreme light-independent environments is energized by chemolithoautotrophic oxidation and reduction of inorganic compounds like elemental sulfur (S°), 2The abbreviations used are: S°elemental sulfurACAaminocaproic acidMe2SOdimethyl sulfoxideTMAOtrimethylamine N-oxideMVmethyl viologenMSmass spectrometryEDXSenergy dispersive x-ray spectroscopySTEMscanning transmission electron microscopyHAADFhigh angle annular dark fieldSRsulfur reductaseICP-MSinductively coupled plasma mass spectrometryMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight.2The abbreviations used are: S°elemental sulfurACAaminocaproic acidMe2SOdimethyl sulfoxideTMAOtrimethylamine N-oxideMVmethyl viologenMSmass spectrometryEDXSenergy dispersive x-ray spectroscopySTEMscanning transmission electron microscopyHAADFhigh angle annular dark fieldSRsulfur reductaseICP-MSinductively coupled plasma mass spectrometryMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. hydrogen, and nitrate (1Amend J.P.

Sulfur and sulfur compounds are the most abundant sources of both electron acceptors and electron donors in extremophilic environments (like volcanic environments) and are used by many microorganisms to support growth (3Blöchl E.

Reduction and oxidation of sulfur compounds (sulfate, sulfite, thiosulfate, organic sulfoxide, elemental sulfur, polysulfides, and organic disulfide) are vital processes for many bacteria and essential steps in the global sulfur cycle. Because of the multiple oxidation states of sulfur, the biochemistry and chemistry of this cycle are complex and still not completely understood (7Suzuki I. Can. J. Microbiol. 1999; 45: 97-105Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 8Hedderich R. Klimmek O. Kröger A. Dirmeier R. Keller M. Stetter K.-O. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 22: 353-381Crossref Google Scholar). This problem is exacerbated by the reactivities of the sulfur species at various oxidation states toward each other (7Suzuki I. Can. J. Microbiol. 1999; 45: 97-105Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The ability to reduce elemental sulfur is mostly found among hyperthermophilic micro-organisms (Archaea and Bacteria) (8Hedderich R. Klimmek O. Kröger A. Dirmeier R. Keller M. Stetter K.-O. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 22: 353-381Crossref Google Scholar), the majority of which depend on S° reduction for optimal growth. They use either molecular hydrogen or organic compounds as electron donors. It has been suggested that S° respiration is one of the earliest mechanisms for energy conservation, because the hyperthermophiles are the forms of life evolving the most slowly (9Schauder R.

The processes by which micro-organisms reduce S° to H2S are still unclear for most of them, and only few of the enzymes involved have been purified. The respiratory systems described so far differ significantly in the properties of their terminal reductases. In some organisms, the activity of sulfur reduction has been found to be associated with soluble proteins (10Fauque G. Herve D. LeGall J. Arch.

In other organisms, the S° or polysulfide reduction activity has been shown to be membrane-associated (15Zöphel A. Kennedy M.C. Beinert H. Kroneck P.M.H Eur. J.

Microbiology. 2003; 149: 2357-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). So far, the best understood membrane electron transport chain to sulfur is in the mesophilic bacterium Wolinella succinogenes, which grows with H2 or formate as electron donors, and S° or polysulfide as electron acceptors (8Hedderich R. Klimmek O. Kröger A. Dirmeier R. Keller M. Stetter K.-O. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 22: 353-381Crossref Google Scholar, 16Dietrich W. Klimmek O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1086-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Supercomplexes involved in hydrogen-sulfur respiration have until now been detected only in hyperthermophilic Archaea. From the chemolithoautotrophic and hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrodictium abyssi, an extremely thermostable membrane-bound sulfur-reducing enzyme complex, composed of nine different subunits, has been detected. It appears to contain the entire electron transport chain required for the reduction of S° with H2 to H2S, including a hydrogenase, a sulfur reductase, and an electron-transferring component (17Dirmeier R. Keller M. Frey G. Huber H. Stetter K.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). More recently, a complex containing a sulfur reductase and a hydrogenase has been purified from the membrane fraction of the hyperthermophilic and acidophilic archaeon Acidianus ambivalens (18Laska S. Lottspeich F. Kletzin A. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 2357-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and an electron transfer from hydrogenase to sulfur reductase, mediated by quinones, has been suggested. The most hyperthermophilic bacteria known to date are members of the genus Aquifex and grow at optimal temperatures of 85 °C (19Huber R. Wilharm T. Huber D. Trincone A. Burggraf S. König H. Rachel R. Rockinger I. Fricke H. Stetter K.O. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1992; 15: 340-351Crossref Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analyses based on 16 S rRNA sequence comparisons showed that Aquifex represents the earliest branching order in the bacterial domain (20Olsen G.J. Woese C.R. Overbeek R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Aquifex is a hyperthermophilic, hydrogen-oxidizing, microaerophilic, and obligate chemolithoautotrophic bacterium capable of growing under an H2/O2/CO2 atmosphere in a medium containing only inorganic compounds. It gains energy for growth from hydrogen and oxygen and uses the reductive trichloroacetic acid cycle for fixing CO2. Because of the outstanding phylogenetic position and physiological properties of the Aquificales, we have focused our interest on the energetic metabolism of Aquifex aeolicus, whose genome has been completely sequenced (21Deckert G.

We have recently characterized two of the three membrane-bound and soluble hydrogenases from this organism, and we proposed a model for the metabolic roles of the three [NiFe] hydrogenases present in the cell (22Brugna-Guiral M.

Several other components of the electron transfer chain in A. aeolicus have been studied as follows: two very similar membranous and soluble cytochromes c555 (23Baymann F. Tron P. Schoepp-Cothenet B.

More recently, we have reported the biochemical and biophysical properties and the implication of the cytochrome bc1 complex in the energy-conserving electron transport chain (28Schütz M. Schoepp-Cothenet B. Lojou E. Woodstra M. Lexa D. Tron P. Dolla A. Durand M.-C. Stetter K.O. Baymann F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10800-10808Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Aquifex pyrophilus can use S° and thiosulfate (S2O3) as electron donors, and in some growth conditions, H2S is formed from S° and H2, suggesting a role for S° as an electron acceptor (19Huber R. Wilharm T. Huber D. Trincone A. Burggraf S. König H. Rachel R. Rockinger I. Fricke H. Stetter K.O. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1992; 15: 340-351Crossref Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The sulfur metabolism of A. aeolicus has not been studied, and no data are available in the literature. Here we describe the membrane-bound supercomplexes involved in energy metabolism and the purification and biochemical characterization of a membrane-bound multienzyme complex transferring electrons from H2 to S°. Its possible metabolic roles in the A. aeolicus bioenergetic pathways are also discussed. Organism and Growth Conditions—A. aeolicus was grown at 85 °C in 2-liter bottles under 1.4 bars of H2/CO2 (80:20) in SME medium, modified according to Ref. 23Baymann F. Tron P. Schoepp-Cothenet B. Aubert C. Bianco P. Stetter K.O. Nitschke W. Schütz M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13681-13689Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, at pH 6.8 in the presence of thiosulfate (1 g/liter) or S° (7.5 g/liter) and harvested in the late exponential growth phase. Typical yields were about 400 mg of cell material per liter of culture. The amount of dissolved oxygen in the medium was estimated by using the Henry equation to be in the range 0.5–0.8%. As controls, A. aeolicus was also cultivated first without sulfur or thiosulfate and second in the presence of sulfur, without O2. Replacement of H2 by N2 was also tested. During growth, sulfide was detected photometrically on colloidal CuS by the method of Cord-Ruwish (29Cord-Ruwish R. J. Microbiol. Methods. 1985; 4: 33-36Crossref Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Preparation and Solubilization of the Membrane Fraction—Cells (30 g) in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml DNase I, 5% glycerol (saturated with argon), and protease inhibitors mixtures (Roche Applied Science) were broken at 18,000–20,000 p.s.i. in a French press cell. Unbroken cells and debris were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. Membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 43,000 rpm (rotor 45 Ti, Beckman) for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended and solubilized in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 5% glycerol, 0.5% aminocaproic acid (ACA), and 1% deoxycholic acid sodium salt (buffer A) and stirred for 1 h at 25°C under argon. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 43,000 rpm (rotor 45 Ti, Beckman) for 1 h. At this point the supernatant contained the majority of both H2S forming activity and hydrogenase activity. Purification of the Hydrogenase-Sulfur-reducing Complex—The supernatant was applied to a DEAE-52 column (4 × 20 cm; Whatman) equilibrated with buffer B (identical to buffer A except for 0.2% deoxycholic acid sodium salt). Proteins were eluted with a 50 mm step gradient of 0–350 mm NaCl. The 50–100 mm NaCl fraction contained the hydrogenase and the sulfur reductase activities. This fraction was then loaded onto a hydroxylapatite column (2 × 12 cm, Bio-Gel; Bio-Rad) equilibrated in buffer A containing NaCl at a concentration of 75 mm. The column was washed with the same buffer, and proteins were then eluted with a 50 mm step gradient of 0–300 mm potassium phosphate. The 250 mm phosphate fraction was dialyzed overnight and loaded on MonoQ column (FPLC; Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were eluted by a gradient of NaCl from 0 to 500 mm. Active fractions were concentrated, stored anaerobically, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. All steps were performed at room temperature under argon. N-terminal Sequence Determination—The N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined from the enzymatic complex preparation after separation of the subunits by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gel under denaturing conditions, proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for 45 min at a current intensity of 0.8 mA/cm2 using a semi-dry electrophoretic transfer unit. Sequence determinations were carried out with an Applied Biosystems Procise 494 microsequencer. Quantitative determination of phenylthiohydantoin derivatives was done by high pressure liquid chromatography (Waters) monitored by a data and chromatography control station (Waters). Enzyme Activities—The sulfur reductase (SR) activity was followed by the evolution of the H2S formed by the reduction of elemental sulfur with H2. The reaction mixture contained 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, and 5% sulfur flower, 40 μm 2-OH-1,4-naphthoquinone, and 20 μm NADPH. Assays were performed in 5-ml vials sealed with rubber stoppers under argon atmosphere. After 10 min of incubation under H2, the enzyme was injected, and the vials were incubated at 85 °C under H2 for 20 min. H2S concentration was then determined by the following method: first, 100 μl of 30 mm FeCl3 in 1.2 m HCl were added to the vial to stop the reaction, second, 50 μl of 20 mm N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride in 7.2 m HCl were added to generate the methylene blue. After mixing, the test tube was incubated 20 min at room temperature in the dark. Samples were centrifuged to remove solid sulfur, and spectrophotometric measurements of the methylene blue formed were done at 670 nm. A calibration curve had been made previously using Na2S (30Trueper H.G. Schlegel H.G. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1964; 30: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). As this method does not take account the loss of sulfide through reactions with sulfur, the activities determined are underestimated. One unit of SR activity corresponds to the uptake of 1 μmol of H2S/min The standard assay mixture without sulfur was also used to assay for reduction of alternative electron acceptors: TMAO, Me2SO, S2O3, S4O6, and polysulfide. NADPH and NADH were used also as electron donors. The following extinction coefficients (mm–1 liter–1) were used: methyl viologen (MV), 13.6 at 604 nm; NADH and NADPH, 6.2 at 340 nm. Hydrogenase activity was determined at 80 °C by the hydrogen consumption and production assays as previously described (22Brugna-Guiral M. Tron P. Nitschke W. Stetter K.O. Burlat B. Guigliarelli B. Bruschi M. Giudici-Orticoni M.-T. Extremophiles. 2003; 7: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). One unit of hydrogenase activity corresponds to the uptake of 1 μmolofH2/min. Analytical Procedures—ICP-MS-Analyses of metals (molybdenum, iron, sulfur, and nickel) were performed using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) on purified complex hydrogenase/SR. Molybdenum Cofactor Analysis—Purified complex hydrogenase/SR was denatured with 1% SDS followed by boiling for 45 min. The SDS was precipitated with KCl (0.25 m final concentration). The cofactor was separated from the protein utilizing microcon Amicon (3000 molecular weight cut-off). The presence of cofactor was determined by fluorescence spectroscopy using a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer. Excitation spectra were obtained using an emission wavelength of 460 nm, and emission spectra were obtained using an excitation wavelength of 370 nm with a slit of 5 mm. Similar experiments were done with TMAO reductase from Escherichia coli purified as described previously (31Ilbert M. Mejean V. Giudici-Orticoni M.T. Samama J.P. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28787-28792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and used as a control. Low Temperature Spectra—Low temperature spectra were recorded in the range of 350–700 nm at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) using a dual wavelength 2000 SLM-Amicon spectrophotometer with a slit of 0.2–0.4 nm. The experiments were performed with 0.4 mg/ml proteins in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6. Reduction of the samples was achieved by addition of sodium ascorbate and sodium dithionite. Native Gel—The purified complex was loaded on a native 4% polyacrylamide stacking, 10% running gel (Mini-Protean II; Bio-Rad). After migration, hydrogenase activity was revealed on the gel as described previously (22Brugna-Guiral M. Tron P. Nitschke W. Stetter K.O. Burlat B. Guigliarelli B. Bruschi M. Giudici-Orticoni M.-T. Extremophiles. 2003; 7: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Denaturing Gel Electrophoresis—100 μg of purified complex was loaded on a 4% polyacrylamide stacking, 10% running SDS gel (Protean II XL cell; Bio-Rad). After migration, the gel was silver-stained as described previously (32Mortz E. Krogh T.N. Vorum H. Gorg A. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 1359-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) with the Vorum protocol slightly modified. Ten bands were excised from the gel and stored at –20 °C before mass spectrometry analysis. Immunoblotting—Western blotting was performed using standard procedures. Anti-DmsA antibodies against the Me2SO reductase chain A from E. coli (33Sambasivarao D. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5935-5943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and anti-hydrogenase antibodies against the hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio fructosovorans (34Aubert C. Brugna M. Dolla A. Bruschi M. Giudici-Orticoni M.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1476: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) were used. The detection reaction was performed using goat peroxidase-conjugate anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) and the ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Tryptic Digestion, Mass Spectrometry, and Data Base Search—Digestion of excised gel plugs was performed as described previously (22Brugna-Guiral M. Tron P. Nitschke W. Stetter K.O. Burlat B. Guigliarelli B. Bruschi M. Giudici-Orticoni M.-T. Extremophiles. 2003; 7: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Protein identification was performed by peptide mass fingerprinting on a MALDI-TOF-MS mass spectrometer DE-RP (Applied Biosystems) exploiting the nonredundant data base NCBInr (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda) using MASCOT search. Transmission Electron Microscopy Analysis—Aquifex cultures (800 ml) were centrifuged (15,000 × g for 10 min), and cells were rinsed once with fresh media and centrifuged again. The yellow sulfur powder was almost totally removed from the sulfur sample. Then they were fixed for 1 h in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and for 1 h in 2% OsO4 in phosphate-buffered saline (35Bernadac A. Gavioli M. Lazzaroni J.C. Raina S. Lloubes R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4872-4878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pellets were dehydrated in alcohol and embedded in Epon (Embed 812). Ultrathin sections, obtained with microtome Leica EM FC/UC6, were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and further observed by using a Zeiss EM109 electron microscope. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), including high angle annular dark field (HAADF) and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDXS), has been done on an unstained ultrathin section using a Jeol 3010F equipped with a Noran spectrometer. Acceleration voltage of 300 keV and electron probes sized down to 1 nm have been used to image the ultrathin section. Sequence Alignment—Multiple sequence alignments were done using ClustalW (36Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar) at pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/. Growth of A. aeolicus with Elemental Sulfur or Thiosulfate—In this work, we show that A. aeolicus can grow in an H2/CO2/O2 atmosphere with S° with a high final cell concentration (A600 = 1.2 on S° against A600 = 0.8 on S2O3) (Fig. 1). Moreover, in A. aeolicus culture containing elemental sulfur, we have detected H2S at the end of the exponential phase in the medium (data not shown) suggesting a possible sulfur respiration in this bacterium. Aquifex thus contains a terminal sulfur reductase (SR). H2S was not detected when bacteria grew with thiosulfate instead of sulfur. As a control, we have cultivated A. aeolicus in presence of sulfur and O2 (0.5–0.8%) under N2/CO2 (80:20) atmosphere. No growth was obtained in this condition. This result confirms a link between the hydrogen and S° consumption in the A. aeolicus metabolism. No significant growth was detected under a strict anaerobic condition. This result is in line with the microaerophilic properties of most of the Aquificales. Typical growth patterns of A. aeolicus in SME medium with either thiosulfate or elemental sulfur are shown in Fig. 1. The doubling time is 108 min with S° and 84 min with S2O3. Sterile controls indicated no significant chemical reduction of elemental sulfur during incubation. In cultures containing sulfur, some of the cells may have attached and grown on the insoluble sulfur particles surface. We may thus have underestimated the cell number to some extent, because only suspended cells were measured in this culture. This could explain the lag phase observed when the bacterium grows on sulfur. During the stationary phase, the cell concentration is constant on S° unlike growth on S2O3, where the absorbance drops rapidly at the end of the exponential phase. Microscopic observations showed that the bacteria tend to aggregate during the stationary phase when grown on S2O3. With 5 or 10 times more S2O3 in the medium (5 and 10 g/liter), the same final cell concentration (A600 = 0.8) is reached, suggesting that thiosulfate is not the limiting substrate in these conditions (data not shown). Microscopy and X-ray Analyses—A. aeolicus cells cultured with thiosulfate or elemental sulfur (harvested at the end of exponential phase) were subjected to optical and transmission electron microscopic observations. Micrographs show clearly the presence of black and white shiny refractive round particles associated with the cells grown with S° only (Fig. 2, A and B). The same particles are also present when the cells grow with S° and thiosulfate at the same time (data not shown). These particles look very similar to the “sulfur globules” already described and easily detectable by microscopy in many organisms (37Schulz H.N. Brinkhoff T. Ferdelman T.G. Hernández Mariné M. Teske A. Jørgensen B.B. Science. 1999; 284: 493-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 38Rees G.N. Harfoot C.G. Janssen P.H. Schoenborn L. Kuever J. Lünsdorf H. Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 2002; 52: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Transmission electron microscopy on section preparations also revealed inclusions in the cytoplasm of cells coming from S° cultures (Fig. 2, C–F). The thiosulfate samples lacked these inclusions. These observations indicate a different metabolism between the cells grown on the two media (S° and S2O3). To determine the granule composition, x-ray microanalysis (EDXS) was performed on unstained ultrathin sections from sulfur-grown cells, in different areas of the cell corresponding to inclusions (Fig. 3, granular zone 1) and to the rest of the cell (Fig. 3, nongranular zone 2, including cytoplasm and periplasm). It is clear that EDXS spectra from zones 1 and 2 are the same except for the presence of a peak for sulfur in the spectrum from the inclusions. The carbon, oxygen, chlorine, and silicon peaks arise primary from the embedding Epon. A small copper peak is because of the TEM grid (we used a beryllium sample holder to limit the copper contribution). The osmium was associated with cell fixation and is more strongly detected in connection with the globules. Spectra indicated that the globules are composed of sulfur. The amount of sulfur detected is very low (after absorption correction, an overall sulfur/carbon ratio of around 5.10–4 was found), and no reliable estimation of the sulfur/carbon and sulfur/oxygen ratios in the granules could be obtained. Attempts to image the sulfur using energy-"
https://openalex.org/W2036674039,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated signaling is implicated in early ischemic preconditioning (PC). A NOX-2-containing NADPH oxidase is a recognized major source of ROS in cardiac myocytes, whose activity is augmented by preconditioning mimetics, such as angiotensin II. We hypothesized that this oxidase is an essential source of ROS in PC. Hearts from wild-type (WT) and NOX-2 knockout (KO) mice were Langendorff perfused and subjected to 35 min ischemia/reperfusion with or without preceding PC or drug treatment. Infarct size was measured by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining, and NADPH oxidase activity by lucigenin chemiluminescence. PC significantly attenuated infarct size in WT (26+/-2% vs. control, 38+/-2%, P<0.05) yet was ineffective in KO hearts (33+/-3% vs. control, 34+/-3%). Concomitantly, PC significantly increased NADPH oxidase activity in WT (+41+/-13%; P<0.05), but not in KO (-5+/-18%, P=NS). The ROS scavenger MPG (N-2-mercaptopropionyl glycine, 300 micromol/L) abrogated PC in WT (39+/-2% vs. control, 33+/-1%). CCPA (2-chloro N6 cyclopentyl adenosine, 200 nmol/L), a putative ROS-independent PC trigger, significantly attenuated infarct size in WT, MPG-treated WT and KO hearts (24+/-2, 23+/-1, and 20+/-3%, respectively, P<0.05). Furthermore, CCPA did not augment NADPH oxidase activity over control (+22+/-11%, P=NS). Inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) with chelerythrine (CHE, 2 micromol/L) completely abrogated both PC (38+/-2% vs. CHE alone, 35+/-2%) and associated increases in oxidase activity (+3+/-10%, P=NS). PKC-dependent activation of a NOX-2-containing NADPH oxidase is pivotally involved in early ischemic PC. However, adenosine receptor activation can trigger a ROS and NOX-2 independent PC pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1969708030,"A non-natural 16-residue “degron” peptide has been reported to convey proteasome-dependent degradation when fused to proteins expressed in yeast (Gilon, T., Chomsky, O., and Kulka, R. (2000) Mol. Cell. Biol. 20, 7214-7219) or when fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) and expressed in mammalian cells (Bence, N. F., Sampat, R. M., and Kopito, R. R. (2001) Science 292, 1552-1555). We find that expression of the GFP::degron in Caenorhabditis elegans muscle or neurons results in the formation of stable perinuclear deposits. Similar perinuclear deposition of GFP::degron was also observed upon transfection of primary rat hippocampal neurons or mouse Neuro2A cells. The generality of this observation was supported by transfection of HEK 293 cells with both GFP::degron and DsRed(monomer)::degron constructs. GFP::degron expressed in C. elegans is less soluble than unmodified GFP and induces the small chaperone protein HSP-16, which co-localizes and co-immunoprecipitates with GFP::degron deposits. Induction of GFP::degron in C. elegans muscle leads to rapid paralysis, demonstrating the in vivo toxicity of this aggregating variant. This paralysis is suppressed by co-expression of HSP-16, which dramatically alters the subcellular distribution of GFP::degron. Our results suggest that in C. elegans, and perhaps in mammalian cells, the degron peptide is not a specific proteasome-targeting signal but acts instead by altering GFP secondary or tertiary structure, resulting in an aggregation-prone form recognized by the chaperone system. This altered form of GFP can form toxic aggregates if its expression level exceeds the capacity of chaperone-based degradation pathways. GFP::degron may serve as an instructive “generic” aggregating control protein for studies of disease-associated aggregating proteins, such as huntingtin, α-synuclein, and the β-amyloid peptide.

The apparent toxicity of these protein aggregates has been demonstrated in cell culture and in many transgenic mouse and invertebrate models (reviewed in Refs. 2Taylor J.P. Hardy J. Fischbeck K.H.

One unanswered question for the C. elegans (as well as Drosophila and mammalian) disease models is the specificity of the observed toxicity, i.e. would any aggregating protein have the same effect? In theory, this question could be addressed by control experiments in which transgenic animals are constructed in parallel that express a nondisease-associated, “generic” aggregating protein. We show here that GFP can be converted into such a control aggregating protein and that expression of this aggregating GFP variant results in in vivo toxicity grossly similar to that observed for disease-associated aggregating proteins. β-amyloid peptide green fluorescent protein enhanced GFP 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole unstable GFP 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid cytomegalovirus differential interference microscopy. In a search for random peptides that would confer instability on proteins expressed in yeast, Gilon et al. (11Gilon T. Chomsky O. Kulka R.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2759-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) identified a non-natural 16-residue peptide (CL1) that conferred apparent ubiquitin-dependent degradation on the Ura3 protein. This short C-terminal “degron” peptide was subsequently used by Bence et al. (12Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar) to engineer an unstable GFP variant (GFP-u) that underwent proteasome-dependent degradation in HEK 293 cells. When we attempted to engineer a similar construct to monitor proteasome function in C. elegans, we unexpectedly found that GFP::degron fusion protein aggressively formed persistent, perinuclear aggregates. We have therefore taken advantage of this unexpected result, and we used this novel, aggregating derivative of GFP to examine the generic response to protein aggregation in a C. elegans model. DNA Constructions—The initial GFP::degron fusion was generated using C. elegans expression vector pPD118.20 (gift of A. Fire), which expresses a Ser-65 → Cys GFP variant under the control of the C. elegans myo-3 promoter. A synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding the 16-residue CL1 degron peptide (cGCATGCAAGAACTGGTTCTCTAGCCTGTCCCACTTCGTCATCCATCTGTAGg), bracketed by EcoRI- and NheI-compatible single-stranded extensions, was ligated to EcoRI/NheI-cleaved pPD118.20, resulting in the myo-3/GFP::degron vector pAT2. Blunt-end ligation was used to generate a control plasmid (pAT1) that contained a 7-nucleotide insert upstream of the degron sequence, resulting in an out-of-frame degron peptide. To generate a myo-3/GFP::PEST expression construct, the mouse ornithine decarboxylase 1 PEST region was recovered by PCR and inserted into the EcoRI/NheI sites of pPD118.20 as described above. To generate a GFP::degron construct with pan-neuronal expression, the myo-3 promoter region of pAT2 was replaced with a PstI/XbaI fragment from pCL35 (containing the snb-1 promoter and a synthetic 3′-untranslated intron), resulting in construct pCL54. Temperature-inducible expression of the GFP::degron was engineered by replacing a KpnI/NheI fragment of smg-1-dependent myo-3 vector pPD118.60 (encoding unmodified GFP) with a KpnI/NheI fragment of pAT2 containing the GFP::degron fusion, resulting in pCL60. To express the GFP::degron fusion protein in mammalian cells, an EcoRI/BstEI restriction fragment encoding the degron peptide was recovered from pCL54 and inserted into the downstream EcoRI/XmaI sites of vector pEGFP-C2 (Clontech). The resulting construct, pCL85, expresses an EGFP::degron protein under control of the CMV promoter. To engineer mammalian DsRed::degron expression, an AgeI/EcoRI fragment from the pDsRed monomer (Clontech) encoding the DsRed monomer protein was swapped for the EGFP in pCL85. The DsRed stop codon was then removed by in vitro mutagenesis (Quick-Change kit, Stratagene), fusing the degron peptide in-frame with the DsRed monomer protein. The terminal peptide sequences of all expression constructs used in this study are shown in Table 1. For clarity, we will refer to the CMV-driven EGFP constructs as “GFP” in the text of this work, with the understanding that these constructs express the sequence-modified EGFP.TABLE 1End sequences of control and fusion proteins used in this study Shown are the predicted end amino acid sequences of wild type GFP, expression vector GFP derivatives (pPD118.20 and EGFP-C2), GFP::degron fusions (pAT2, pCL85, and EGFP-u), DsRed(monomer), and DsRed(monomer)::degron fusion.

All constructions were checked by DNA sequencing. Construction of Transgenic C. elegans Strains—Transgenic lines were generated by microinjection of the constructs described above. Plasmid pRF4, encoding dominant rol-6(su250) mutant collagen, was co-injected as a selectable morphological marker for all microinjections, with one exception; pCL137 (myo-3/hsp-16.2) was co-injected with a GFP marker plasmid (pCL26 (mtl-2/GFP)) that produces strong intestinal GFP expression. Lines with chromosomally integrated transgenes were generated by γ-irradiation as described previously (5Link C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9368-9372Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). DNA Transfection of Mouse N2A Cells and Primary Rat Hippocampal Neurons—Neuro2a (N2A) cells were seeded on polylysine-coated coverslips at 1.25 × 105 cells/cm2 in minimum Eagle's medium-α + 10% fetal bovine serum (without antibiotics) and transfected a day later with either pEGFP-C2 vector (Clontech) or pCL85 (pEGFP-C2::degron (pAT2)) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Primary cultures of dissociated neurons from E18 embryonic rat hippocampi were prepared essentially as described (13Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. 2nd Ed. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998: 339-370Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B-27 and Glutamax. After 7 days in vitro, cells were transfected with 2.0 μg of plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000, as per the manufacturer's instruction. Cells were maintained in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 12 or 24 h to allow for protein expression. Transfection of HEK 293 Cells and Analysis of GFP and DsRed Aggregates—Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293-H, Invitrogen) were seeded on collagen-coated Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium coverslips at 2.5 × 105 cells/cm2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + non-essential amino acids + 10% fetal bovine serum (without antibiotics). One day later, they were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 and a total of 2-4 μg of plasmid DNA using various combinations of the following plasmids: pEGFP-C2, pCL85 (EGFP::degron), pDsRed(monomer), pCL169 (DsRed(monomer)::degron), and pGFP-u (a gift from R. Kopito (12Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar)). Expression of each construct was examined singly and in combination with a control for the transfection efficiency, i.e. the GFP-degron DNAs (pCL85 and pGFP-u) and plain GFP (pEGFP-C2) were co-transfected with plain DsRed(monomer) as a control for transfection efficiency, and conversely, DsRed(monomer)::degron (pCL169) was cotransfected with plain GFP (pEGFP-C2). After 17 h, the cells were fixed with 10% paraformaldehyde for 20-30 min at room temperature, permeabilized, and stained with DAPI. The coverslips were examined by epifluorescence, and images of the EGFP, DsRed(monomer) and DAPI fluorescence were obtained as described below. These images were scored experiment-blind for the number of cells containing aggregated EGFP and the number containing aggregated DsRed. These values were normalized to the relative number of transfected cells by using the masking function of SlideBook software to determine the area in μm2 occupied by the fluor serving as the control for transfection efficiency. As a further check on the results obtained by scoring the images blind, we devised a simple algorithm to detect aggregates objectively. We determined the mean intensity of both GFP and DsRed(monomer) in the area masked by the control fluor, we then set the threshold for visualization of each fluor at four times its mean intensity. The small points of fluorescence that exceeded that “4× threshold” generally corresponded to aggregates identified by eye, but the following two issues made it less accurate than the human eye. First, cells with intense fluorescence exceeded the 4× threshold regardless of whether they contained any aggregates (false positives). Some of these false positives were eliminated by specifying that true aggregates do not lie over the nuclei nor extend over more than half the cell. Second, some cells with weak overall fluorescence contained clear aggregates that did not exceed the 4× threshold, which was based on the mean intensity of the population as a whole (false negatives). Despite the limitations of the algorithm-based approach, these objective measurements of aggregates paralleled the experiment-blind human scoring, validating our scoring methods. Immunofluorescence and Light Microscopy—Nematode populations were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized using a 2-mercaptoethanol/collagenase treatment as described previously (5Link C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9368-9372Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Permeabilized worms were probed with polyclonal rabbit HSP-16 antibody (14Hockertz M.K. Clark-Lewis I. Candido E.P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) at 1:500 dilution and Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody (1:100, Molecular Probes). Nematode (and live N2A cell) images were acquired with a Zeiss Axioskop epifluorescence microscope equipped with 40× air (NA 0.75) and 100× (NA1.3) oil Plan Neofluor objectives and a digital deconvolution retrofit (Intelligent Imaging Innovations). For comparison of GFP fluorescence distribution in transfected primary neurons, three cultures were analyzed for both GFP and GFP::degron transfections. Exposure times were adjusted so that cell body fluorescence was within the linear range of the camera, and that cell body fluorescence was comparable between GFP and GFP::degron-transfected neurons. Fluorescence in all control GFP-transfected neurons was readily detectable in the distal axons and dendrites (12 of 12 cells, fluorescence at least 4× higher than background), whereas fluorescence in GFP::degron-transfected cells was not detectable in these neurites above background (14 cells analyzed). Hippocampal cells were fixed in a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline and then blocked in 0.5% fish skin gelatin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 37 °C. After blocking, coverslips were incubated with a polyclonal MAP2 (1:500, Chemicon AB5622) antibody overnight at 4 °C (to identify neurons), which was followed by incubation in Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:500, The Jackson Laboratory) for 1 h at 37 °C. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides in Elvanol containing 0.5 mg/ml DAPI. Images of GFP-expressing cells were acquired using a SPOT RT-SE (Diagnostics Instruments) cooled CCD camera controlled by Metamorph software (Universal Imaging) with a -60, 1.4 N.A. Plan Apo objective (Nikon). Electron Microscopy—Synchronously hatched cultures of transgenic nematodes were propagated at 16 °C for 36 h and then up-shifted as third larval stage animals to 25 °C for 24 h to induce transgene expression, as described previously (15Link C.D. Taft A. Kapulkin V. Duke K. Kim S. Fei Q. Wood D.E. Sahagan B.G. Neurobiol. Aging. 2003; 24: 397-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Aliquots of induced fourth larval stage animals were frozen in a Balzers HPM 010 high pressure freezing apparatus as described previously (16Dahl R. Staehelin L.A. J. Electron Microsc. Technol. 1989; 13: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Samples were freeze-substituted in 2% osmium tetroxide and 0.05% uranyl acetate in acetone at -80 °C for 5 days, gradually warmed to room temperature, infiltrated with Araldite/Embed-812 (Electron Microscopy Sciences), and polymerized. Thin sections were stained with 2% uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead citrate and imaged at 80 kV in a JEOL 100C or Phillips CM10 electron microscope. Sequential Extraction of Nematode Homogenates—Homogenates were prepared as described previously for immunoprecipitation experiments (17Fonte V. Kapulkin V. Taft A. Fluet A. Friedman D. Link C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9439-9444Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) from equivalent size populations of transgenic worms and then extracted in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.6, 10% glycerol for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence of protease inhibitors. Insoluble material was pelleted (25,000 × g for 15 min) and then re-extracted in 1% SDS for 1 h at 4°C. The remaining insoluble material was pelleted (25,000 × g for 15 min) and solubilized in 70% formic acid. Extracts were concentrated and desalted using Microcon centrifugal filter tubes (Millipore), fractionated on a NOVEX 4-12% BisTris gel using MES SDS running buffer (Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose, stained with Ponceau S to confirm that loading and transfer had been equivalent for all of the extracts, and immunoblotted with anti-GFP antibody (Qbiogene) (see supplemental Fig. S1). Filter Trap Assays—Worm lysates were prepared using a Tris/Triton X-100 immunoprecipitation buffer as described previously (17Fonte V. Kapulkin V. Taft A. Fluet A. Friedman D. Link C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9439-9444Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Lysates were centrifuged at 2,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge (325 relative centrifugal force) for 5 min to remove large insoluble material (cuticle fragments, etc.), and the supernatant was saved as the lysate supernatant. Gel fractionation of the lysate supernatants and subsequent Ponceau S staining were used to equalize levels of total protein between lysates. 30-μl aliquots of lysate supernatant were run through a cellulose acetate membrane (0.2 μm) pre-soaked in Tris/Triton X-100 immunoprecipitation buffer using vacuum pressure. The membranes were allowed to dry, and then the individual sample dots were placed into separate wells of a 96-well microtiter plate (clear, flat bottom wells). Total GFP fluorescence trapped on the membrane was quantified using a Tecan GENios microplate reader (485 nm excitation and 535 nm emission filters). Immunoprecipitation Studies—Magnetic μbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) were cross-linked to anti-GFP 3E6 antibody (Qbiogene) and purified using a magnetized column (Miltenyi Biotec). Purified μbeads were mixed with 0.5 ml of worm lysate prepared as described previously (17Fonte V. Kapulkin V. Taft A. Fluet A. Friedman D. Link C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9439-9444Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). After incubation, the lysate/μbead mixture was run through a magnetized column to purify the immunoprecipitate. This protocol involves no centrifugation or sedimentation, thereby avoiding nonspecific recovery of particulate material (e.g. protein aggregates). The μMAC immunoprecipitate was washed four times with lysis buffer (1% Triton), once with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and then eluted using a small volume of 95 °C Laemmli Sample Buffer (4% SDS). The μMAC immunoprecipitation eluate was run on a 12% BisTris gel using MES running buffer (Invitrogen) and immunoblotted with anti-GFP and anti-HSP-16 antibodies. Scoring of Transgenic Worm Paralysis—Populations of transgenic worms were staged by a 2-h synchronous egg lay on 5-cm nematode growth media plates spotted with RW2 strain Escherichia coli. Worms were propagated at 16 °C for 48 h after the end of the egg lay and then shifted to 25 °C to induce transgene expression. Scoring for paralysis was initiated 20 h after temperature upshift. Animals were scored as paralyzed if they were associated with “halos” of cleared E. coli lawn around their heads (indicative of an insufficient body movement to access food) or if the animals did not move in response to prodding with a tapered platinum wire. Paralyzed animals were removed from the E. coli lawn at every time point to facilitate accurate counts of paralyzed animals. GFP::Degron Aggregates in C. elegans Muscle—We fused the 16-residue CL1 peptide identified by Gilon et al. (11Gilon T. Chomsky O. Kulka R.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2759-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) to the C terminus of GFP and independently expressed either this fusion protein or control GFP in C. elegans body wall muscle using the promoter of the myo-3 gene. Unlike unmodified GFP, which is observed throughout the muscle cytoplasm (Fig. 1A), expression of GFP::degron results in perinuclear aggregates, with little detectable diffuse cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 1, B and F). To determine the specificity of this effect, transgenic lines were generated expressing GFP fused to an out-of-frame degron peptide (Fig. 1C) or to the well characterized PEST domain of mouse ornithine decarboxylase (Fig. 1D). These control fusions displayed a cytoplasmic distribution like unmodified GFP. To investigate whether the aggregation of GFP::degron might be an artifact of exceptionally high level expression, total (formic acid-extractable) GFP levels were measured by quantitative immunoblot. As shown in Fig. 1E, the transgenic strain expressing unmodified GFP (lanes 1 and 3) has at least three times as much transgenic protein as does the strain expressing GFP::degron (lanes 2 and 4). Thus, the aggregates observed in the GFP::degron strain are because of some qualitative difference between the GFP::degron fusion protein and GFP. To examine these GFP::degron aggregates at the ultrastructural level, the GFP::degron strain was analyzed by high pressure freeze electron microscopy. As shown in Fig. 1G, we observed electron-dense, perinuclear deposits specifically in the muscle cells expressing GFP::degron. These cytoplasmic deposits are not membrane-bound and resemble aggresomes (18Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar). To determine whether the formation of visible GFP::degron aggregates coincided with the production of less-soluble forms of GFP, homogenates of transgenic worms expressing GFP or GFP::degron were subjected to sequential extraction using Tris/glycerol, 1% SDS, and formic acid buffers. As shown in Fig. 2A, only a small fraction of GFP::degron is extractable in the Tris/glycerol buffer (compare lanes 1 and 2), and only GFP::degron expression results in the formation of a pool of SDS-insoluble, formic acid-extractable material (compare lanes 5 and 6). Detergent-resistant GFP::degron aggregates were also observed in filter-trap assays using 0.2-μm pore cellulose acetate filters (Fig. 2B). Quantification of retained fluorescence in replicate samples demonstrated that ∼8-fold more GFP::degron was retained on the filters relative to unmodified GFP (16,289 ± 635 S.E. for GFP::degron versus 1890 ± 254 S.E. for GFP, relative fluorescence units). GFP::Degron Aggregation Occurs in Neurons and Mammalian Cells—Given the unexpected aggregation of GFP::degron in C. elegans muscle, we first investigated whether this fusion protein would also aggregate in C. elegans neurons. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), GFP that is expressed in ventral cord neurons is observed throughout the cell body and axons, whereas GFP::degron forms intense perinuclear deposits in the same neurons. We then asked whether GFP::degron would also aggregate in mammalian cells. The degron peptide was fused to EGFP in a CMV promoter-driven expression vector, and the resulting construct was used to transiently transfect undifferentiated mouse N2A cells and primary fetal rat hippocampal neurons. In both instances, transient GFP::degron expression resulted in perinuclear fluorescence different from the diffuse cytoplasmic fluorescence typically observed in cells transformed with control GFP (compare Fig. 3, C and E with D and F). Transfection of HEK 293 Cells with Degron Fusion Constructs—The results described above differ from the reported fate of GFP::degron fusion protein GFP-u in HEK 293 cells (12Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar). To determine whether this might be because of either cell type differences or subtle differences in the fusion protein sequences (see Table 1 for a comparison of GFP::degron and GFP-u terminal sequences), we transfected HEK 293 cells in parallel with GFP, GFP::degron, and GFP-u. The fraction of transfected cells containing visible aggregates was then scored 17 h after transfection. Cells transfected with either our GFP::degron construct or the previously described GFP-u construct had significantly more transfected cells with visible aggregates than cells transfected with GFP (Fig. 4, A, C, and E, quantified in I). However, GFP itself was seen to occasionally form aggregates in transiently transfected cells (Fig. 4E), suggesting that GFP has a native capacity to aggregate when expressed at high levels in HEK 293 cells. This background aggregation of GFP complicates interpretation of the increased rates of GFP::degron and GFP-u aggregation. We therefore fused the degron peptide to DsRed(monomer) (19Campbell R.E. Tour O. Palmer A.E. Steinbach P.A. Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7877-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar), which in our hands is much less aggregation-prone than GFP in HEK 293 cells. As shown in Fig. 4 (G and H, quantified in I), addition of the degron peptide to the DsRed(monomer) results in a dramatic increase (∼10-fold) in the fraction of transfected cells with aggregates, strongly supporting the view that fusion of proteins to the degron peptide predisposes them to aggregate. Interaction of GFP::Degron with Chaperone Protein HSP-16—We have shown previously (20Fay D.S. Fluet A. Johnson C.J. Link C.D. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1616-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) that expression of the aggregation-prone human Aβ peptide in C. elegans muscle results in the formation of immunoreactive deposits, often with a perinuclear distribution similar to that of GFP::degron. Aβ expression also results in the induction and co-localization of the small heat shock protein HSP-16, a chaperone protein homologous to αB-crystallin. To determine whether GFP::degron expression has a similar effect on HSP-16 expression and localization, a population of CL2292 (myo-3/GFP::degron) animals was probed with anti-HSP-16 antibody"
https://openalex.org/W2123627658,"Expression of the transcription factor Ets-1 is increasingly associated with the progression of several human cancers. A tumor-derived factor is expected to be involved in the inappropriate up-regulation of ets-1 in tumor and surrounding cells. A link between hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and increased Ets-1 expression has also been suggested, leading to the proposal that this reactive oxygen species (ROS) may be an important factor in directly regulating the expression of ets-1 in tumor cells. Ets-1 expression in response to H2O2 was examined in an ovarian carcinoma cell model, and the genes promoter region was analyzed in order to identify putative elements involved in redox responsiveness. The up-regulation of Ets-1 by H2O2 was confirmed in the cells tested. Luciferase assays using constructs generated to test the contribution of specific promoter elements indicated that an antioxidant response element (ARE) is primarily involved in the H2O2-mediated induction. Gel shift analysis confirmed the increased binding of an Nrf2 containing protein complex to the ets-1 ARE after H2O2 treatment. This study has delineated a key element involved in the transcriptional regulation of ets-1 under basal and induced conditions. Ets-1 has obvious deleterious effects in many cancer cells, and thus, the identification of this regulatory pathway has provided possible targets for manipulating its expression."

Increasing the Mg2+ concentration derepresses the ATPase activity and concomitantly stimulates the unfolding activity of VAT. Similarly, the VATΔN complex, a mutant of VAT deleted for the N domain, displays up to 24-fold enhanced ATP hydrolysis and 250-fold enhanced GFP unfolding activity when compared with wild-type VAT. To determine the individual contribution of the two AAA domains to ATP hydrolysis and GFP unfolding we performed extensive site-directed mutagenesis of the Walker A, Walker B, sensor-1, and pore residues in both AAA domains. Analysis of the VAT mutant proteins, where ATP hydrolysis was confined to a single AAA domain, revealed that the first domain (D1) is sufficient to exert GFP unfolding indistinguishable from wild-type VAT, while the second AAA domain (D2), although active, is significantly less efficient than wild-type VAT. A single conserved aromatic residue in the D1 section of the pore was found to be essential for GFP unfolding.

Steven A.C. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 1-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). A common feature is their assembly into oligomeric complexes, which function in energy-dependent remodeling of proteins or nucleic acids (2Maurizi M.R. Li C.C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 980-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). AAA proteins form a subfamily of the AAA+ superfamily and group according to the number of AAA domains into type I (one AAA domain) and type II (two AAA domains) proteins. The eukaryotic p97/ VCP proteins belong to the latter family and thus are built of two adjacent AAA domains and were originally suggested to function in membrane fusion (3Patel S. Latterich M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 65-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, however, it became evident that p97/VCP is primarily involved in extraction and degradation of membrane proteins (4Brunger A.T. DeLaBarre B.

The cellular importance of p97/VCP function is highlighted by the fact that mutations in p97/VCP were found to cause an ultimately lethal disease, called inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (12Watts G.D.J Wymer J.

The eukaryotic NSF protein belongs also to the type II AAA family and is essential for vesicular transport and membrane fusion through its interaction with the SNARE proteins (13Whiteheart S.W.

Peters J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1049-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In addition, these experiments suggested, although indirectly, that VAT has an unfolding activity at high Mg2+ concentrations. To study VAT-mediated unfolding in more detail, we employed GFP and GFP11, a fusion of the 11-residue peptide ssrA to the C terminus of GFP (15Weber-Ban E.U. Reid B.G. Miranker A.D. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), as substrates in conjunction with VAT and its deletion variant VATΔN. The latter lacks the structurally conserved N domain, suggested earlier to be the substrate-binding domain (16Coles M. Diercks T. Liermann J. Gröger A. Rockel B. Baumeister W. Koretke K.K. Lupas A. Peters J. Kessler H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1158-1168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), but still assembles into a hexameric complex (17Rockel B. Walz J. Hegerl R. Peters J. Typke D. Baumeister W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The N domains of VAT, p97, and NSF are structurally conserved and in case of the latter two mediate the interaction with adaptor proteins; adaptor proteins of VAT are not known. The cofactor p47 inhibits the ATPase activity of p97/VCP through its binding to the N domain (18Meyer H.H. Kondo H. Warren G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Similarly, it was shown that binding of α-SNAP to the N domain of the related eukaryotic NSF protein stimulates the ATPase activity (19Matveeva E.A. May A.P. He P. Whiteheart S.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 530-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The NSF-α-SNAP complex mediates membrane fusion through disassembly of SNARE complexes (13Whiteheart S.W. Matveeva E.A. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Electron tomography and cryo-electron microscopy of single particles revealed a central pore in the hexameric Thermoplasma VAT complex (17Rockel B. Walz J. Hegerl R. Peters J. Typke D. Baumeister W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Rockel B. Jakana J. Chiu W. Baumeister W. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Processing of substrates by AAA+ proteins was proposed to be achieved by threading through the central pore, which is lined with hydrophobic residues (21Wang J. Song J.J. Franklin M.C. Kamtekar C.S.

This was recently confirmed by electron microscopy and mutational analysis for Escherichia coli proteins of the Clp family and FtsH, as well as for yeast Hsp104 (22Ishikawa T. Beuron F. Kessel M.

However, no unfolding or threading activity has been described for p97/VCP, although it has been shown to suppress polyglutamine-induced protein aggregation in analogy to ClpB (30Yamanaka K. Okubo Y. Suzaki T. Ogura T. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 242-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 31Higashiyama H. Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Inoue Y.H. Fujikake N. Matsukage A. Kakizuka A. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In contrast, based on the crystal structure of mouse p97 it was suggested that threading through the pore is not possible, since the channel in D1 was blocked by a zinc ion (32DeLaBarre B. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 856-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 33DeLaBarre B. Brunger A.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 437-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Experiments with p97/VCP revealed that the main ATP hydrolysis is carried out by its D2 domain (34Song C.C. Wang Q. Li C.C.H J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3648-3655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 35Ye Y.H. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). In contrast the NSF-D2 domain is catalytically inactive and functions only in hexamerization of the protein, whereby the D1 domain exerts nucleotide hydrolysis (13Whiteheart S.W. Matveeva E.A. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). NSF was shown to disassemble SNARE complexes to recycle the monomers, but protein threading or unfolding has not been demonstrated (13Whiteheart S.W. Matveeva E.A. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this study we show that the aromatic residues in the D1 and D2 section of the central pore in VAT are involved in unfolding of GFP11. Additionally, we present the mutational analysis of residues in both domains of VAT necessary for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, i.e. Walker A, Walker B, and sensor-1. Site-directed Mutagenesis—To generate the mutant variants of VAT, codons for Lys237 and/or Lys514 (Walker A), Glu291 and/or Glu568 (Walker B), Asn334 and/or Asn612 (sensor-1), Tyr264 and/or Trp541, and/or Val542 (pore residues) in plasmid pET-28-VAT-His6 containing the codon optimized vat gene (14Golbik R. Lupas A.N. Koretke K.K. Baumeister W. Peters J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1049-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) were changed to encode alanine. The plasmid pET-28-VAT-His6 was used to obtain VATΔN, a VAT variant deleted for the N-terminal 183 residues, similarly as described for the non-optimized vat gene (17Rockel B. Walz J. Hegerl R. Peters J. Typke D. Baumeister W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Purification of Proteins—After transformation of BL21 (DE3) RIL cells with pET-28 constructs of VAT, its mutants, or VATΔN, recombinant clones were grown in LB medium containing 25 mg/liter kanamycin and 34 mg/liter chloramphenicol until an optical density (600 nm) of 1 was reached. Protein production was induced by adding isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm and the cells were harvested after 4 h and frozen at –20 °C. For the purification of VAT and its mutants (except K237/514A), thawed cells were suspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, lysed using a cell disrupter (Avestin) and applied to centrifugation (1 h, 100,000 × g, 25 °C). 3 m NaCl was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 400 mm, since VAT and its mutants, except for K237/514A, precipitate reversibly in the cold at high salt. The solution was incubated for 3 h at 4°C, and the precipitated VAT protein was harvested by centrifugation. The protein was resuspended in 20 mm HEPES at 60 °C and precipitated again as described above. This procedure was repeated in total three times. The final protein solution was purified on a Superose-6 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. Thawed cells containing VAT-K237/514A were suspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole and processed as described above. The supernatant was applied to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen), and the protein was eluted using a continuous gradient from 20–500 mm imidazole in the suspension buffer. The eluent was purified on a Superose-6 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. VATΔN cells were suspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1mm dithiothreitol, and processed as described above. The supernatant was incubated at 60 °C for 22 min and centrifuged (20 min, 20,000 × g, 4 °C) to remove precipitated E. coli proteins. In the following the protein solution was diluted 1:3 in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and applied to a HiTrap Q column (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was eluted by a discontinuous gradient of 50–400 mm NaCl in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 5 mm MgCl2. The fractions containing the VATΔN protein were pooled, loaded onto nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen), washed with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm imidazole, and eluted with 500 mm imidazole in the same buffer. The eluent was applied to a Superose-6 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2. All mutant VAT proteins were shown to assemble in an ATP-independent manner into hexameric complexes indistinguishable from wild-type VAT complexes, as analyzed by size exclusion chromatography, native gel electrophoresis, and electron microscopy. Wild-type proteasomes, Δα-(2–12) 20 S proteasomes, and GFP/GFP11 were purified as described (15Weber-Ban E.U. Reid B.G. Miranker A.D. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 36Seemüller E. Lupas A. Stock D. Löwe J. Huber R. Baumeister W. Science. 1995; 268: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Measurement of the ATPase Activity—The ATPase activity of VAT and VATΔN was determined by the malachite green assay (37Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). The total reaction volume was 50 μl of HM (50mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 120 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) or LM (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) buffers were used, as indicated. The reaction was stopped by addition of 800 μl of malachite green solution followed by 100 μl of citric acid (34%(w/v)). After 30-min incubation at room temperature, absorption at 640 nm was determined in a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Lambda 40, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For kinetic analysis the reactions were carried out at different ATP concentrations (60 μm to 3.5 mm), and the data points were fitted according to Michaelis-Menten kinetics using Origin 5.0. Fluorescence Assays of GFP/GFP11 Unfolding—GFP/GFP11 fluorescence was monitored continuously in a fluorescence plate reader (Fluostar Optima, BMG Technologies) using filters of 480 nm for excitation and 520 nm for emission. GFP or GFP11 were diluted, as indicated, and the reactions were started by addition of ATP. The total reaction volume was 200 μl. For the kinetic reactions different amounts of GFP11 from 0 to 2 μm in 0.25 μm steps were incubated in HM or LM buffer, including 50 nm VAT or VATΔN and a 28 nm concentration of Δα-(2–12) 20 S proteasomes. After starting the reactions with 5 mm ATP the initial slopes were recorded and the values fitted according to Michaelis-Menten kinetics using Origin 5.0. The curves were corrected by a control reaction without ATP. Western Blot Analysis—The Western blot analysis of GFP11 degradation by proteasomes was performed with anti-enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (a mutant of GFP) antibodies. VAT Shows Mg2+-stimulated Unfolding of GFP11—In search for an assay to demonstrate unfolding activity of VAT directly, we employed GFP11, a C-terminal fusion of the globular green fluorescent protein with the 11-residue peptide ssrA (15Weber-Ban E.U. Reid B.G. Miranker A.D. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In eubacteria, the ssrA tag is added to the C terminus of incompletely translated proteins stalled at the ribosome, thus marking them for degradation (38Karzai A.W. Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The tagged protein gives the same fluorescence quantum yield and emission spectrum as non-tagged GFP, and its unfolding can be directly observed by loss of fluorescence (15Weber-Ban E.U. Reid B.G. Miranker A.D. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). An ssrA-tagging system has not been identified in archaea, but we have shown before that the archaeal PAN ATPase unfolds GFP11 (39Benaroudj N. Zwickl P. Seemüller E. Baumeister W. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 69-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). We measured the unfolding activity of VAT in the presence of 20 mm Mg2+ at 60 °C, the optimal growth temperature of Thermoplasma. Since the unfolding activity was extremely low we searched for a stimulating factor. In a previous study it was shown that elevated Mg2+ concentrations stimulated the ATPase activity of VAT (14Golbik R. Lupas A.N. Koretke K.K. Baumeister W. Peters J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1049-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Mg2+ induces more flexibility to the rigid structure of VAT and may therefore enhance ATP hydrolysis (see supplemental Fig. S1). As monitored by CD spectroscopy Mg2+ does, however, not influence secondary structure elements of VAT (data not shown). We found here that increasing the Mg2+ concentration to 120 mm stimulated GFP11 unfolding and turned VAT into an unfoldase (Fig. 1A). The assays were carried out in the presence of the Thermoplasma Δα-(2–12) 20 S proteasome, which is lacking residues 2–12 of the α subunits. This deletion opens the entrance channel into the proteasome and results in enhanced protein degradation activity (39Benaroudj N. Zwickl P. Seemüller E. Baumeister W. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 69-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The mutant proteasomes degraded unfolded GFP11 (Fig. 1A) and thus prevented its competition with the folded GFP11 in binding to VAT, as can be noticed in a slower unfolding reaction in the absence of proteasomes (see supplemental Figs. S2 and S3). In the absence of VAT, proteasomes did not degrade folded GFP11, but as shown before they can degrade unfolded or acid-denatured GFP11 (39Benaroudj N. Zwickl P. Seemüller E. Baumeister W. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 69-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The unfolding of GFP11 occurred only in the presence of a hydrolyzable nucleotide, like ATP or CTP and, albeit with lower efficiency, in the presence of GTP or UTP. Unfolding was not detected during incubation with ADP nor the non-hydrolyzable analogues AMP-PNP, AMP-PCP, or ATPγS. Subsequent addition of ADP or ATPγS to a GFP11 unfolding reaction started with ATP caused an immediate inhibition of unfolding (data not shown). Neither an elevated temperature of 60 °C nor an increased Mg2+ concentration of 120 mm did induce spontaneous unfolding of GFP11 (data not shown). Thus, unfolding of the stable globular protein GFP11 by VAT is dependent on nucleotide hydrolysis. VATΔN Is a More Efficient Unfoldase than VAT—Next, we tested VATΔN, a mutant of VAT deleted for the putative substrate-binding N domain (16Coles M. Diercks T. Liermann J. Gröger A. Rockel B. Baumeister W. Koretke K.K. Lupas A. Peters J. Kessler H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1158-1168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 17Rockel B. Walz J. Hegerl R. Peters J. Typke D. Baumeister W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), for GFP11 unfolding activity. Unexpectedly, VATΔN showed strongly enhanced unfolding of GFP11 in comparison with wild-type VAT. Moreover, VATΔN displayed this strong unfolding activity at a Mg2+ concentration as low as 20 mm and was not stimulated further by increasing it to 120 mm (Fig. 1A). Mg2+ Increases the ATP Hydrolysis of VAT but Not of VATΔN—To clarify the differences in unfolding of GFP11 between VAT and VATΔN, we performed kinetic studies of the ATP hydrolyzing activity of both proteins at Mg2+ concentrations of 20 and 120 mm, respectively (Fig. 1B). To this end, we measured the release of inorganic phosphate of both proteins at different ATP concentrations and fitted the data points according to Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Additionally, we analyzed the kinetics of GFP11 unfolding in the same way, using different GFP11 concentrations (TABLE ONE). As described above for the GFP11 unfolding activity, VAT showed strongly enhanced ATP hydrolysis at high Mg 2+ conditions. In contrast, the ATPase activity of VATΔN was optimal at low Mg2+ and slightly inhibited at high Mg2+. Importantly, the turnover (kcat) of ATP by VATΔN at low Mg2+ was almost 2- or 20-fold higher as compared with the activity of VAT at high Mg2+ or low Mg2+, respectively (Fig. 1B). Moreover, VAT showed a lower apparent affinity for the nucleotide than VATΔN at both conditions, resulting in higher Km values (see TABLE ONE).TABLE ONEComparison of kinetic constants of ATP hydrolysis and GFP11 unfoldingVAT (20 mm Mg2+)VAT (120 mm Mg2+)VATΔN (20 mm Mg2+)VATΔN (120 mm Mg2+)ATP hydrolysis Vmax0.27 ± 0.012.59 ± 0.056.49 ± 0.075.27 ± 0.07 Km0.22 ± 0.010.35 ± 0.020.13 ± 0.010.10 ± 0.01 kcat2224133GFP11 unfolding Vmax0.18 ± 0.07 (×10-3)6.08 ± 1.39 (×10-3)46.29 ± 6.85 (×10-3)47.15 ± 5.05 (×10-3) Km0.92 ± 0.843.56 ± 1.152.83 ± 0.632.52 ± 0.42 kcat2 × 10-350 × 10-3292 × 10-3296 × 10-3ATP/GFP11aMolecules ATP hydrolyzed per molecules of GFP11 unfolded.1511426140112a Molecules ATP hydrolyzed per molecules of GFP11 unfolded. Open table in a new tab From both kinetic data we calculated the amount of ATP molecules required to unfold one GFP11 molecule. In the case of VATΔN, the number of ATP molecules was similar for both Mg2+ concentrations (140 for low and 112 for high Mg2+), but the consumption of ATP by VAT to unfold one GFP11 molecule was much higher and strongly dependent on the Mg2+ concentration (1511 for low and 426 for high Mg2+). At a concentration of 20 mm Mg2+ VAT worked very inefficiently and consumed nearly four times the amount of ATP molecules than at 120 mm to unfold one GFP11 molecule. The substrate did not account for the increase of the ATP hydrolysis by VAT, since neither the ATPase activity of VAT nor VATΔN was stimulated by GFP11. These findings imply that the N domain either regulates and/or inhibits the ATPase activity of VAT and that the deletion of the N domain of VAT has a similar stimulatory effect as high Mg2+ ion concentration. This function of VAT-N could only be exerted in cis, since addition of the isolated N domain in trans did not influence the activity of the VATΔN complex (data not shown). Unfolding of Non-tagged GFP—Surprisingly, we detected unfolding of non-tagged, i.e native GFP by VAT and VATΔN, but with lower efficiency as compared with GFP11 unfolding. The rate of unfolding by VATΔN was again higher than that of VAT, and VAT showed unfolding only at high Mg2+ (Fig. 1C). This is a novel finding, because hitherto none of the studied AAA+ ATPases has been shown to be able to unfold native GFP, i.e. without ssrA tag. The crystal structure and mutational analysis of GFP revealed that the C-terminal 9 residues are unstructured and dispensable for fluorescence (40Li X.Q. Zhang G.H. Ngo N. Zhao X.N. Kain S.R. Huang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28545-28549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Our results show that the unstructured 9 amino acid residue tail of native GFP is sufficient for recognition and unfolding by VAT and implies that conformational properties like the absence of structure, rather than a specific sequence, are critical for VAT-induced unfolding. This assumption is supported by the observation that both VAT and VATΔN unfolded a GFP mutant protein, where the unstructured 9-amino acid residue tail was deleted and replaced by the ssrA-tag (data not shown). Substrate Interaction through D1—Residues of the central channel are conserved in many AAA+ proteins (Fig. 2C), they line the pore of the hexameric complexes (Fig. 2D) and were shown to be involved in substrate binding (41Horwich A.L. Cell. 2004; 119: 579-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The binding of substrates to VATΔN, lacking the N domain, must occur either via the D1 or the D2 domain. To identify the domain responsible for substrate binding and unfolding, we mutated conserved aromatic or rather hydrophobic residues in the pore sections of D1 or/and D2 of VAT and measured the unfolding activity of the isolated mutant VAT proteins (Fig. 2A). We show here that the pore residue tyrosine 264 of VAT-D1 is an essential residue for substrate binding (Fig. 3). Mutation of tyrosine 264 to alanine led to complete loss of VAT mediated GFP11 unfolding as monitored in the fluorescence assay (Fig. 2A). In contrast, mutation of the VAT-D2 pore residue tryptophane 541 to alanine had a small, but not negligible, inhibitory effect on GFP11 unfolding and the mutation of the adjacent pore residue valine 542 did not affect the unfolding activity at all. Strikingly, simultaneous mutation of the adjacent aromatic and hydrophobic pore residues in VAT-D2 blocked GFP11 unfolding nearly completely, which was most likely a consequence of perturbed substrate interaction with the D2 pore (Fig. 3). Thus unfolding in the D1 section of the pore is critically dependent on a single aromatic residue, whereas in the D2 section of the pore two adjacent residues seem to function independently but are crucial as a pair. To ensure that the changed unfolding activity of the VAT pore mutants was not attributable to decreased nucleotide hydrolysis, we measured the ATPase activity of these proteins. Interestingly, the ATPase activity of all VAT pore mutants, with the exception of the valine 542 mutant in VAT-D2, was enhanced when compared with wild-type VAT (Fig. 2B). The whole set of VAT pore mutants and all other subsequently described mutant VAT proteins assemble in an ATP-independent manner into hexameric complexes indistinguishable from wild-type VAT complexes, as revealed by electron microscopy, native gel electrophoresis, and size exclusion chromatography (data not shown). As analyzed by CD spectroscopy the mutations did not have effects on the secondary structure of the proteins (data not shown). VAT-D1 Is Sufficient for Substrate Unfolding—To analyze which domain of VAT is responsible for substrate unfolding, we changed the catalytic glutamate residues in the Walker B box of D1 or/and D2 to alanine and measured GFP11 unfolding and ATP hydrolysis.

Among three isoforms of calponin, h2-calponin is found in both smooth muscle and non-muscle cells. The present study demonstrates that epidermal keratinocytes and fibroblast cells express significant amounts of h2-calponin. The expression of h2-calponin is cell anchorage-dependent. The levels of h2-calponin decrease when cells are rounded up and remain low when cells are prevented from adherence to a culture dish. h2-calponin expression resumes after the floating cells are allowed to form a monolayer in plastic dish. Cell cultures on polyacrylamide gels of different stiffness demonstrated that h2-calponin expression is affected by the mechanical properties of the culture matrix. When cells are cultured on soft gel that applies less traction force to the cell and, therefore, lower mechanical tension in the cytoskeleton, the level of h2-calponin is significantly lower than that in cells cultured on hard gel or rigid plastic dish. Force-expression of h2-calponin enhanced the resistance of the actin filaments to cytochalasin B treatment. Keratinocyte differentiation is accompanied by a mechanical tension-related up-regulation of h2-calponin. Lowering the tension of actin cytoskeleton by inhibiting non-muscle myosin II ATPase decreased h2-calponin expression. In contrast to the mechanical tension regulation of endogenous h2-calponin, the expression of h2-calponin using a cytomegalovirus promotor was independent of the stiffness of culture matrix. The results suggest that h2-calponin represents a novel manifestation of mechanical tension responsive gene regulation that may modify cytoskeleton function.

Commun. 1986; 141: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Three calponin isoforms (h1-, h2-, and acidic calponins) are encoded by three homologous genes. h1-calponin (2Takahashi K. Nadal-Ginard B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13284-13288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Strasser P. Gimona M. Moessler H. Herzog M. Small J.V. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) is specifically expressed in differentiated smooth muscle cells and has been extensively studied for its role in the regulation of smooth muscle contractility (for review, see Refs. 4Winder S.J.

The acidic calponin is found in nervous tissues and implicates in neuronal regeneration and growth (7Ferhat L. Charton G. Represa A. Ben-Ari Y. der Terossian E. Khrestchatski M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1501-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 8Ferhat L. Rami G. Medina I. Ben-Ari Y. Represa A. J.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) is found in both smooth muscle and non-muscle cells such as human epidermal keratinocytes (9Fukui Y. Masuda H. Takagi M. Takahashi K. Kiyokane K. J. Dermatol. Sci. 1997; 14: 29-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). h2-calponin mRNA has been also detected in endothelial cells (10Sakihara C. Nishimura J. Kobayashi S. Takahashi S. Kanaide H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and fibroblasts (11Masuda H. Tanaka K. Takagi M. Ohgami K. Sakamaki T. Shibata N. Takahashi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The gene regulation and function of h2-calponin are largely unknown. Previous studies suggested that h2-calponin may play a role in the organization of actin cytoskeleton (12Danninger C. Gimona M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3725-3736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in cytokinesis (13Hossain M.M. Hwang D.-Y. Huang Q.-Q. Sasaki Y. Jin J.-P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: c156-c167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by the observation that h2-calponin is expressed at significant levels in growing and remodeling tissues (13Hossain M.M. Hwang D.-Y. Huang Q.-Q. Sasaki Y. Jin J.-P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: c156-c167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Forced expression of h2-calponin in cells lacking endogenous calponin results in an association with the actin stress fibers and a decrease in the rate of cell proliferation (13Hossain M.M. Hwang D.-Y. Huang Q.-Q. Sasaki Y. Jin J.-P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: c156-c167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These results suggest a microfilament-associated activity of h2-calponin, which may regulate the function of actin cytoskeleton. The actin cytoskeleton has essential functions in many cellular activities, such as cell division (14Han E.K.H Guadagno T.M. Dalton S.L. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), migration (15Ponti A. Machacek M. Gupton S.L. Waterman-Storer C.M. Danuser G. Science. 2004; 305: 1782-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), and contraction (16Filipe J.A. Nunes J.P. Auton. Autacoid Pharmacol. 2002; 22: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A major component of the actin filaments in higher eukaryotes is tropomyosin. Tropomyosin is known to participate in the regulation of striated muscle contraction (17Smillie L.B. Barany M. Biochemistry of Smooth Muscle Contraction. Academic Press, Inc., New York1996: 63-75Crossref Google Scholar) and to stabilize actin filaments in non-muscle (18Broschat K.O. Weber A. Burgess D.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8501-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) as well as muscle cells (19Broschat K.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21323-21329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calponin binds actin and tropomyosin and is proposed to be an analog of striated muscle troponin (1Takahashi K. Hiwada K. Kokubu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 20Nakamura F. Mino T. Yamamoto J. Naka M. Tanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6194-6201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and, therefore, may regulate the actin-myosin II-based cytoskeleton function. Previous studies have shown that living cells respond to mechanical forces exerted through surrounding fluid, adhered beads, or cultural matrix (21Wang N. Butler J.P. Ingber D.E. Science. 1993; 260: 1124-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2470) Google Scholar, 22Ingber D.E. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 613-627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Girard P.R. Nerem R.M. J. Cell.

Sheetz M.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 39-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). Physical properties of the adhesion substrate can profoundly affect cell locomotion, growth, and differentiation (26Harris A. Exp. Cell Res. 1973; 77: 285-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 27Folkman J. Moscona A. Nature. 1978; 273: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar, 28Ingber D.E. Folkman J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). The stiffness of the cultural matrix has effects on cell motility (29Lo C.M. Wang H.B. Dembo M. Wang Y.L. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 144-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2570) Google Scholar, 30Pelham R.J. Wang Y.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 849-856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and differentiation (32Cukierman E. Pankov R. Stevens D.R. Yamada K.M. Science. 2001; 294: 1708-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (2464) Google Scholar, 33Deroanne C.F. Lapiere C.M. Nusgens B.V. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 49: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Varying stiffness of the cultural matrix applies different traction force to the cell and, therefore, different mechanical tension to the cytoskeleton (34Engler A. Bacakova L. Newman C. Hategan A. Griffn M. Discher D. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 617-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 35Yeung T. Georges P.C. Flanagan L.A. Marg B. Ortiz M. Funaki M. Zahir N. Ming W. Weaver V. Janmey P.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2005; 60: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (1835) Google Scholar). The regulation and function of actin cytoskeleton in the cellular responses to mechanical tension represents an important but little known subject of signal transduction. In the present study we investigated the regulation of h2-calponin by mechanical tension. We demonstrated that epidermal keratinocytes and fibroblast cells express significant amounts of h2-calponin, which decrease when cells are rounded up and remain low when cells are prevented from anchorage on the culture dish. h2-calponin expression resumes after the floating cells are allowed to attach to the plastic dish. When cells are cultured on soft gel matrix that applies lower mechanical tension to the cytoskeleton, the level of h2-calponin is significantly lower than that in cells cultured on hard gel or rigid plastic dish. Keratinocyte differentiation is accompanied by a mechanical tension-related up-regulation of h2-calponin. Force-expression of h2-calponin increased actin filaments resistance to cytochalasin B treatment. Lowering the tension of actin cytoskeleton by inhibiting non-muscle myosin II ATPase decreased h2-calponin expression. In contrast to the mechanical tension regulation of endogenous h2-calponin, the expression of h2-calponin using a cytomegalovirus (CMV) 2The abbreviations used are: CMVcytomegalovirusPBSphosphate-buffered salineD-PBSDulbecco's PBSmAbmonoclonal antibodyTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanateTmtropomyosin. promotor was independent of the stiffness of culture matrix. The results suggest that h2-calponin represents a novel manifestation of mechanical tension-responsive gene regulation that may modify cytoskeleton function. cytomegalovirus phosphate-buffered saline Dulbecco's PBS monoclonal antibody tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate tropomyosin. Specific Antibodies—A rabbit polyclonal antiserum (RAH2) raised against mouse h2-calponin with a weak cross-reaction to h1-calponin has been described previously (36Nigam R. Triggle C.R. Jin J.-P. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody (mAb) 1D2 against human h2-calponin was developed as described previously for the production of anti-mouse h2-calponin mAbs (13Hossain M.M. Hwang D.-Y. Huang Q.-Q. Sasaki Y. Jin J.-P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: c156-c167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, human h2-calponin cDNA was cloned using reverse transcription-coupled polymerase chain reaction as described previously (36Nigam R. Triggle C.R. Jin J.-P. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and expressed in Escherichia coli for protein preparation (37Jin J.-P. Wu D. Gao J. Nigam R. Kwong S. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 31: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Purified human h2-calponin was used to immunize 8-week-old female Balb/c mice in a short-term immunization protocol (38Wang J. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14519-14528Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Spleen cells were harvested from the immunized mouse for fusion with SP2/0-Ag14 mouse myeloma cells. Hybridoma colonies were screened by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay and subcloned three times to establish a stable cell line. The mAbs were produced in the forms of hybridoma cultural supernatant and mouse ascites fluids. Enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay immunoglobulin isotyping (Invitrogen) determined its subclass as IgG2bκ. Its specificity was determined by Western blotting on purified h1- and h2-calponins (37Jin J.-P. Wu D. Gao J. Nigam R. Kwong S. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 31: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Mouse anti-h1-calponin mAb CP1 was prepared and characterized previously (39Jin J.-P. Walsh M.P. Resek M.E. McMartin G.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mouse anti-tropomyosin isoform mAbs, CG1 against hTM1, CGβ6 against hTM2 and hTM3, LC24 against hTM4, and CG3 against hTM5 were described previously (40Lin J.J. Hegmann T.E. Lin J.L. J.

A rabbit anti-human involucrin antibody was produced as previously described (44Robinson N.A. LaCelle P.T. Eckert R.L. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 101-107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 45LaCelle P.T. Lambert A. Ekambaram M.C. Robinson N.A. Eckert R.L. Skin Pharmacol. Appl. Skin Physiol. 1998; 11: 214-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—PAGE and Western blotting were carried out as described previously (38Wang J. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14519-14528Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) to examine the expression of calponin in mouse skin tissues and human keratinocyte and fibroblast cultures. The samples were homogenized in SDS gel electrophoresis sample buffer containing 2% SDS and analyzed on 12% gel with an acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio of 29:1 in the Laemmli buffer system. After electrophoresis, the gels were fixed and stained with Coomassie Blue R250 to confirm sample integrity and protein contents. Protein bands in unfixed duplicate gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting with the anti-calponin, anti-tropomyosin, or anti-involucrin antibodies. The specific protein bands recognized by the first antibodies were revealed by using alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG second antibody (Sigma) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium chromogenic substrate reaction. Purified h2- and h1-calponins (37Jin J.-P. Wu D. Gao J. Nigam R. Kwong S. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 31: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was used as control. Immunohistochemistry—To examine the in vivo expression of h2-calponin in epidermal keratinocytes, paraffin sections of epidermal scar (anonymously provided by the Skin Disease Research Center at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine) were stained with anti-h2 calponin mAb 1D2 that had no cross-reaction to h1-calponin followed by horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG second antibody (Sigma) and H2O2/3,3′-diamino-benzidine substrate reaction using standard immunohistochemical methods (46Jin J.-P. Brotto M.A. Hossain M.M. Huang Q.-Q. Brotto L.S. Nosek T.M. Morton D.H. Crawford T.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26159-26165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To avoid background staining of tissue sections by immunosera and mouse ascites fluid (data not shown), 1D2 hybridoma culture supernatant was used. The morphology of tissue sections was outlined by counterstaining of the slides with 0.6% hematoxylin for 20 s. Cell Cultures—Primary keratinocytes were isolated from human foreskin samples (47Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Richard L. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and cultured in serum-free keratinocyte media (Invitrogen) with supplements (50 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract, 5 ng/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor; Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Culture media were replaced every 3 days. The monolayer cells around 70% confluence were passed at 1:5 ratio, and cells at second or third passages were used for experiments. The methods for culturing human epidermal keratinocytes were described in detail previously (48Efimova T. LaCelle P. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24387-24395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 49Efimova T. Broome A.M. Eckert R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8167-8183Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Human Fibroblast Cell Line KD (American Type Culture Collection, CRL 1295) was cultured in Dulbecco's-modified Eagle medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 IU/ml) and streptomycin (50 IU/ml) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. SM3 is an immortalized cell line derived from rabbit aortic smooth muscle (50Sasaki Y. Uchida T. Sasaki Y. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 1009-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and has ceased endogenous calponin expression (13Hossain M.M. Hwang D.-Y. Huang Q.-Q. Sasaki Y. Jin J.-P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: c156-c167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Stable transfected SM3 cells force-expressing h2-calponin driven by the CMV promoter in pcDNA3.1 vector (13Hossain M.M. Hwang D.-Y. Huang Q.-Q. Sasaki Y. Jin J.-P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: c156-c167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) were used in the present study to investigate h2-calponin regulation and functional effect. The sense cDNA construct expresses non-fusion full-length mouse h2-calponin protein for authentic functional characterization, and antisense cDNA-transfected cell lines were used as negative control. The transfected SM3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (50 IU/ml), and G418 (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Precleaned glass coverslips were coated with 0.1% gelatin and dried under UV radiation for 3 h before being placed in the culture dish. Keratinocytes and KD cells were seeded to grow a monolayer on the coverslips. After 3 days of culture, the cells grown on coverslips were washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS; 136.89 mm NaCl, 2.68 mm KCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2). The cells were then fixed with cold acetone for 20 min. Immunofluorescence microscopy was carried out as described previously (13Hossain M.M. Hwang D.-Y. Huang Q.-Q. Sasaki Y. Jin J.-P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: c156-c167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) to examine the cellular localization of h2-calponin and tropomyosin using anti-calponin and anti-tropomyosin antibodies. TRITC- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG second antibodies (both from Sigma) were used to distinguish the rabbit and mouse first antibody staining representing the localization of calponin and tropomyosin, respectively, using a Zeiss Axiovert 100H phase contrast-epifluorescence microscope with two sets of filters (CZ915 and CZ909). Actin stress fibers in the cell were examined by rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (Sigma) staining. The co-localization of h2-calponin and tropomyosin in KD cells were also examined by confocal microscopy at the Neurobiology Core Facility at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. Examination of Cell Plating Time Dependence of h2-calponin Expression—To investigate the expression of h2-calponin during the time course of monolayer cell culture, preconfluent keratinocytes were trypsinized and seeded at high and low densities (initial density = 9 × 105 cells and 3 × 105 cells/60-mm dish, respectively). The cells were suspended from the culture dishes after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 days using the Versene solution (0.537 mm EDTA, 136.8 mm NaCl, 2.68 mm KCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2) and washed 3 times with D-PBS. Omitting trypsin digestion during the cell harvest avoids artificial degradation of cellular proteins. SDS gel sample buffer containing 2% SDS was used to lyse the cells, and total cellular protein was extracted by vortexing. Levels of h2-calponin in high and low density keratinocyte cultures at the post-plating time points were examined by Western blot analysis using anti-h2-calponin antibody RAH2. KD fibroblasts and stable transfected SM3 cells were examined similarly for the plating time effect on the levels of h2-calponin. Examination of Matrix Adhesion-dependent Expression of h2-calponin—To examine the effects of matrix attachment on the expression of h2-calponin in cultured cells, continuous vibration was applied to keratinocytes, KD fibroblasts, and SM3 cells to prevent cell attachment to tissue culture dishes (51Furukawa K.S. Ushida T. Sakai Y. Suzuki M. Tanaka J. Tateishi T. Cell Transplant. 2001; 10: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Incubated on a humidified CO2 incubator at 37 °C, the cultural dishes were placed on an orbital shaker (Bel-Art Products, Pequannock, NJ) driven by a magnetic stirrer at 80 rpm. The cells were harvested after 3 days of culture in vibration to examine the levels of h2-calponin. After washed with PBS, the cells were lysed in SDS-gel sample buffer and examined by Western blotting analysis as described above. The viability of the floating cell aggregates was confirmed by growing into monolayers after re-seeding on tissue culture dishes and incubated without vibration. The expression of h2-calponin in the cells after re-seeding was examined as described above. Examination of Culture Matrix Stiffness-dependent Expression of h2-calponin—To compare with the rigid plastic cultural dish, a thin layer of polyacrylamide gel was prepared on glass coverslips to provide a soft matrix for cell culture as described previously (30Pelham R.J. Wang Y.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13661-13665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2473) Google Scholar, 35Yeung T. Georges P.C. Flanagan L.A. Marg B. Ortiz M. Funaki M. Zahir N. Ming W. Weaver V. Janmey P.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2005; 60: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (1835) Google Scholar, 52Pelham R.J. Wang Y.-L. Biol. Bull. 1998; 194: 348-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The coverslips were passed briefly through the inner flame of a Bunsen burner. A drop of 0.1 n NaOH was smeared across the surface of the coverslip and air-dried. Thereafter, the coverslips were treated with 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane and then with 0.5% glutaraldehyde. Polyacrylamide gels of different stiffness (very hard, 10% gel with an acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio of 40:1; hard, 3% gel with an acrylamide: bisacrylamide ratio of 14:1; soft, 3% gel with an acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio of 74:1) were polymerized in between the treated coverslip at the bottom and an untreated coverslip on the top. After polymerization, the untreated coverslip was removed to expose the ∼100-μm thin layer of gel to be used as cell culture matrix. Previous studies have shown that the stiffness of the polyacrylamide gel matrix is directly proportional to the concentration of bisacrylamide cross-linker (30Pelham R.J. Wang Y.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13661-13665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2473) Google Scholar, 34Engler A. Bacakova L. Newman C. Hategan A. Griffn M. Discher D. Biophys.

After treating the gel with a bifunctional cross-linker (1 mm sulfo-SANPAH, Pierce) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.5 (30Pelham R.J. Wang Y.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13661-13665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2473) Google Scholar), Type I collagen was applied to the gel surface followed by gently shaking overnight at 4 °C for cross-linking to the gel. Gels were then washed with D-PBS and sterilized with UV irradiation for 3 h. The gel was soaked in culture media at 37 °C for 1 h before plating cells. To examine the effect of the tension that the culture matrix applied to the cell through traction force on the expression of h2-calponin, keratinocytes were seeded on a plastic culture dish or polyacrylamide gels of different stiffness. The cells were harvested after 3 days of culture by directly lysis in SDS gel sample buffer after D-PBS washes. The level of h2-calponin was examined by Western blot analysis with the anti-h2-calponin antibody RAH2 as described. Measurement of Cell Spreading Area—Monolayer keratinocytes cultured on plastic dish or polyacrylamide gels of different stiffness were photographed at 4, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h of culture. The NIH Image program Version 1.61 was used to measure the two-dimensional spreading area of randomly selected non-overlapping cells. Ca2+ Induction of Keratinocyte Differentiation—To examine the expression of h2-calponin during keratinocyte differentiation in vitro, cells were plated on plastic culture dishes or soft polyacrylamide gel (3% with an acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio of 74:1). One day after plating, the concentration of CaCl2 in culture media was increased to 0.3 mm. The cells were harvested after 48 h in the high Ca2+ media for Western blotting examination of h2-calponin as described above. The expression of involucrin, an established cell differentiation marker, in epidermal keratinocytes was examined by Western blot to monitor the induction of differentiation (53Rice R.H. Green H.

Cytochalasin B Treatment—To investigate the effect of h2-calponin on actin cytoskeleton, stable transfected SM3 cells expressing h2-calponin were plated on gelatin-coated coverslips. After 3 days of culture, the cells were treated with 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 μg/ml cytochalasin B (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min. h2-calponin-negative SM3 cells were examined as the control. The cytochalasin B stock was prepared in Me2SO, so a 0.2% Me2SO-treated control group of cells was also examined. The cells were washed with PBS and fixed with cold acetone. The structure of stress fibers stained with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin was examined as above and evaluated for the resistance to cytochalasin B treatment. Blebbistatin Treatment—To examine the effect of reducing cytoskeleton tension, which is mainly built up by myosin II motor activity on the expression of h2-calponin in cells, NIH 3T3 cells were cultured on plastic dish and gelatin-coated coverslips (3 × 104 cells/35-mm dish). After 3 days of monolayer culture, the cells were treated with 100 μm blebbistatin (Sigma), a myosin II ATPase inhibitor (56Straight A.F. Cheung A. Limouze J. Chen I. Westwood N.J. Sellers J.R. Mitchison T.J. Science. 2003; 299: 1743-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar), for 3 days. Parallel cultures in normal media or containing 0.2% Me2SO (solvent for making the blebbistatin stock) were examined as controls. The cells in culture dish were harvested by lysis in SDS-PAGE sample buffer after PBS washes, and the levels of h2-calponin were determined by Western blot analysis as above. The cells on the coverslips were fixed with cold acetone, and the actin stress fibers were stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin. The fluorescence and phase contrast images were viewed under a Zeiss Axiovert 100H fluorescence microscope. Data Analysis—Densitometry analysis of SDS-gel and Western blots"
https://openalex.org/W1988785321,"The homeobox gene CHX10 is required for retinal progenitor cell proliferation early in retinogenesis and subsequently for bipolar neuron differentiation. To clarify the molecular mechanisms employed by CHX10 we sought to identify its target genes. In a yeast one-hybrid assay Chx10 interacted with the Ret1 site of the photoreceptor-specific gene Rhodopsin. Gel shift assays using in vitro translated protein confirmed that CHX10 binds to Ret1, but not to the similar Rhodopsin sites Ret4 and BAT-1. Using retinal nuclear lysates, we observed interactions between Chx10 and additional photoreceptor-specific elements including the PCE-1 (Rod arrestin/S-antigen) and the Cone opsin locus control region (Red/green cone opsin). However, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that in vivo, Chx10 bound sites upstream of the Rod arrestin and Interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein genes but not Rhodopsin or Cone opsin. Thus, in a chromatin context, Chx10 associates with a specific subset of elements that it binds with comparable apparent affinity in vitro. Our data suggest that CHX10 may target these motifs to inhibit rod photoreceptor gene expression in bipolar cells.

The outer nuclear layer houses the cell bodies of photoreceptors (rods and cones), whereas those of horizontal, bipolar, and amacrine interneurons and Müller glia reside in the inner nuclear layer. The innermost layer is the ganglion cell layer, which consists of a mixture of ganglion and amacrine neurons. These three cellular areas are separated by outer and inner plexiform layers that house synaptic connections. This intricate laminated structure develops through the amplification of multipotent progenitor cells, generation of more restricted post-mitotic transition cells, and maturation of these cells into terminally differentiated neurons and glia (1Dyer M.A. Bremner R. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In rodents, ganglion, horizontal, cone, and amacrine transition cells are born in the prenatal period, bipolar and Müller cells are born post-natally, and rods are born throughout retinal development (2Young R.W. Anat. Rec. 1985; 212: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). Transcription factors play critical roles in each of the stages of retinal development, but many gaps remain in our understanding of the specific target genes involved. Here, we focus on one of these factors, the homeobox gene CHX10, and its role in sculpting the characteristics of bipolar interneurons.

Previous molecular analysis linked a naturally occurring mutation in the homeobox of Chx10 to the ocular retardation phenotype in mice (orJ) (5Burmeister M. Novak J. Liang M.Y. Basu S. Ploder L. Hawes N.L. Vidgen D. Hoover F. Goldman D. Kalnins V.I. Roderick T.H. Taylor B.A. Hankin M.H. McInnes R.R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 376-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). These mice display a dramatic decrease in retinal progenitor cell (RPC) proliferation and lack bipolar cells, phenotypes that reflect the expression of Chx10 in both of these cell types 5I.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 377-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Molecular and genetic studies have begun to reveal some aspects of the mechanism by which Chx10 regulates retinal development. The proliferation defect in the orJ mouse is partially alleviated by crossing this allele with a Mus musculus castaneous strain, thought to be because of as yet uncharacterized modifier genes (7Bone-Larson C. Basu S. Radel J.D. Liang M. Perozek T. Kapousta-Bruneau N. Green D.G. Burmeister M. Hankin M.H. J. Neurobiol. 2000; 42: 232-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). RPC proliferation is also partially rescued when the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 is deleted on an orJ background (8Green E.S. Stubbs J.L. Levine E.M. Development. 2002; 130: 539-552Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Increased p27Kip1 levels are linked to a decrease in Cyclin D1 although the detailed mechanism is not yet known (8Green E.S. Stubbs J.L. Levine E.M. Development. 2002; 130: 539-552Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Gene expression changes have been noted in the orJ retina including aberrant induction of Microphthalmia transcription factor (Mitf) (9Horsford D.J. Nguyen M.T. Sellar G.C. Kothary R. Arnheiter H. McInnes R.R. Development. 2005; 132: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), loss of the nuclear receptor retinoid-like orphan receptor β (10Chow L. Levine E.M. Reh T.A. Mech. Dev. 1998; 77: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and up- or down-regulation of many other factors (11Rowan S. Chen C.M. Young T.L. Fisher D.E. Cepko C.L. Development. 2004; 131: 5139-5152Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Mitf drives the formation of retinal pigment epithelium over the neural retina and retinoid-like orphan receptor β promotes RPC division (9Horsford D.J. Nguyen M.T. Sellar G.C. Kothary R. Arnheiter H. McInnes R.R. Development. 2005; 132: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 10Chow L. Levine E.M. Reh T.A. Mech. Dev. 1998; 77: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), so both of these changes may be linked to the perturbation of Cyclin D1 and p27Kip1 levels. The requirement for Chx10 to facilitate RPC proliferation is transient because overexpression and knockdown assays reveal that Chx10 does not alter the cell cycle in the post-natal retina. 5I.

The mechanism by which CHX10 facilitates bipolar cell differentiation is also not clear. Indeed, until recently it was not certain that CHX10 even had a direct role in bipolar cell differentiation. These neurons are late born cell types, so their absence in the orJ retina could be explained by the severe negative effect on RPC proliferation. Indeed, RPC division drops to almost negligible levels in the post-natal mouse orJ retina. 5I. Livne-bar, M. Pacal, M. Cheung, M. Hankin, J. Trogadis, C. Chen, K. M. Dorval, and R. Bremner, submitted for publication. This issue was resolved by the finding that acute Chx10 knockdown in the post-natal retina blocks bipolar cell differentiation without affecting RPC proliferation. 5I. Livne-bar, M. Pacal, M. Cheung, M. Hankin, J. Trogadis, C. Chen, K. M. Dorval, and R. Bremner, submitted for publication. The decrease in bipolar neurons is accompanied by a corresponding increase in rod photoreceptors. 5I. Livne-bar, M. Pacal, M. Cheung, M. Hankin, J. Trogadis, C. Chen, K. M. Dorval, and R. Bremner, submitted for publication. These data complement overexpression studies showing that CHX10 promotes bipolar cell genesis at the expense of rods (12Hatakeyama J. Tomita K. Inoue T. Kageyama R. Development. 2001; 128: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).5 CHX10 can repress transcription (13Dorval K.M. Bobechko B.P. Ahmad K.F. Bremner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10100-10108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) raising the possibility that it may facilitate bipolar cell differentiation by inhibiting photoreceptor gene expression. Indeed, rod and bipolar cells express many of the same genes (14Blackshaw S. Fraioli R.E. Furukawa T. Cepko C.L. Cell. 2001; 107: 579-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), so CHX10 could be one of the factors that defines the unique characteristics of bipolar neurons. Gene targets of retinal HD proteins are largely unknown. Microarray analysis comparing mRNA from orJ versus wild type retinas identified several potential Chx10-regulated targets (11Rowan S. Chen C.M. Young T.L. Fisher D.E. Cepko C.L. Development. 2004; 131: 5139-5152Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), but whether Chx10 binds directly to these genes in vivo is not clear. In vitro, Chx10 can bind to elements found in the Cone opsin locus control region (LCR) and a Nestin regulatory element (15Hayashi T. Huang J. Deeb S.S. Genomics. 2000; 67: 128-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 16Rowan S. Cepko C.L. Dev. Biol. 2005; 281: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), but again, it is unclear whether these associations are recapitulated in vivo. Here, we show that CHX10 binds directly to a variety of photoreceptor gene regulatory elements in vitro, but that only a specific subset are targeted in vivo. We also show that CHX10 represses the rod arrestin promoter in a DNA binding-dependent fashion, providing experimental support for the idea that CHX10 facilitates bipolar cell characteristics in part by silencing expression of select photoreceptor genes. Yeast One-hybrid Screen—A yeast one-hybrid screen, using a bovine retina cDNA/GAL4AD library kindly provided by Dr. Ching-Hwa Sung (Cornell University School of Medicine), was carried out as previously described (17Chen S. Wang Q.L. Nie Z. Sun H. Lennon G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Zack D.J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1017-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The bait sequence used was a tetramer of the bovine rhodopsin promoter sequence from –148 to –126 bp. Approximately 2 × 106 transformants were screened. Seventy-two colonies that grew on the His– medium were selected for further analysis. Cell Culture—NG108 cells (generated by fusion of mouse neuroblastoma and rat glioma cells) (18Daniels M.P. Hamprecht B. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 63: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and primary chicken retinal cells (E8) were maintained in culture as previously described (13Dorval K.M. Bobechko B.P. Ahmad K.F. Bremner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10100-10108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). E8 cells were isolated according to the protocol described by Adler et al. (19Adler R. Methods Neurosci. 1990; 2: 134-149Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and were maintained in culture for a resticted time period (∼3–4 days) to prevent the overgrowth of any one cell type. Luciferase Assays—Transient transfection assays were performed as previously described (13Dorval K.M. Bobechko B.P. Ahmad K.F. Bremner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10100-10108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, NG108 or freshly dissected primary chick retinal cells were plated at 70% confluency 1 day prior to transfection by the calcium phosphate method. As a control for transfection efficiency, 0.3 μg of cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase was included in each transfection and β-galactosidase activity was determined. For luciferase assays, 20 μl of lysate was added to 50 or 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent (10 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 33.3 mm dithiothreitol, 270 μm coenzyme A, 470 μm luciferin, 530 μm ATP in Gly-Gly buffer, pH 7.8) and read immediately in a luminometer (Zylux). 100% luciferase activity is taken as that obtained in the presence of control effector plasmid. Luciferase -fold activation is relative to that obtained in the presence of control effector plasmid. Luciferase activity was corrected for transfection efficiency using a β-galactosidase internal control. Individual experiments were performed in duplicate and error bars represent the standard deviation of three independent assays unless otherwise noted. Plasmids—pBSKS-CHX10 (human, full-length), pECEHA-Chx10 (mouse, full-length), Chx-ABCD (human full-length), Chx-N51A (HD mutant of human CHX10), and LexCHX10 (human full-length CHX10 fused to LexA) have all been previously described (13Dorval K.M. Bobechko B.P. Ahmad K.F. Bremner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10100-10108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). CHX10-VP16 (SVChxV) is a fusion protein of full-length human CHX10, the activation domain of VP16 (amino acids 410–490), and a COOH-terminal single FLAG tag driven by the SV40 enhancer/promoter. This plasmid was built through 4-way ligation of the following fragments: full-length human CHX10 excised from Chx-ABCD by digestion with HindIII and NheI; PCR amplified VP16 (amino acids 410–490) from GAL4-VP16 digested to yield 5′ NheI and 3′ BglII sticky ends; synthetic FLAG + TAA olignucleotide 5′ BglII and 3′ EcoRI sticky overhangs; SV-Nmyc (20Bremner R.

GAL4-VP16 encodes the GAL4-DNA-binding domain fused to the activation domain of VP16 (amino acids 410–490) (gift of Dr. Robert Kingston). The following plasmids have been described (17Chen S.

Deletion constructs –316Arr, –202Arr, and –107Arr were generated by PCR from the human ROD ARRESTIN reporter (DJZ) and subcloned into pGL2Basic at the 5′ MluI and 3′ BglII sites. RSV-Luc contains Luc under control of the RSV long terminal repeat (–489 to +40; gift of H. P. Elsholtz). CHX10 Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies were raised by injecting sheep with GST fusion proteins containing the human CHX10 amino terminus (1–131) or carboxyl terminus (264–361) (Exalpha Biologicals, Boston, MA). These antibodies specifically recognized a protein of the correct size (∼46 kDa) in Western blots of retina lysates from mouse, rat, chicken, and cow, and immunostained bipolar cells in the mature rodent retina.5 Mouse anti-CHX10 antibodies (M1) were a gift of R. McInnes. Isolation of Mouse Retinal Nuclear Lysate—Nuclear lysate was prepared from P6 CD-1 mouse retinas for use in gel shifts according to Ref. 21DesJardin L.E. Hauswirth W.W. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 154-165PubMed Google Scholar. Dissections and subsequent steps were carried out on ice. Retinas were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and then buffer A (15 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 110 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm dithiothreitol). Retinas were homogenized in buffer B (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 0.25 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and the degree of lysis was monitored by nuclear staining with trypan blue over 5–10 strokes. Nuclei were spun down at 7,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Sorval GSA rotor. The nuclear pellet was then washed in buffer A before nuclear lysis in buffer C (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 400 mm KCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol). In 0.4 ml of buffer C nuclei were lysed with 1× 2-s sonication burst prior to spinning down of nuclear debris for 60 min at 4 °C at 13,000 rpm. Total protein was measured by Bradford assay before and after dialysis in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm KCl. Typical yield from 18 retinas is ∼0.4 μg of total protein, which decreased with dialysis by ∼3/4. Lysates were aliquoted and stored at –70 °C. Gel Shifts—Oligonucleotides used as probes and primers used to amplify promoter fragments for gel shift assays are shown in Table 1. Gel shifts were performed as previously described (13Dorval K.M. Bobechko B.P. Ahmad K.F. Bremner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10100-10108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). CHX10 or Crx plasmids were in vitro translated in the presence of 35S-labeled methionine and protein levels were adjusted for methionine content using densitometry. Gels were dried and exposed on film at room temperature. Gel shifts including 50 μg of mouse P6 retinal nuclear lysate were allowed to incubate for 30 min at 30 °C. Where applicable, 1 μl of antibody was preincubated for 15 min with GST or GST-CHX10.TABLE 1Oligonucleotide probesProbeTechniqueSequenceBovine Ret1Gel shift5′-GGCCCCACCTGGAAGCCAATTAAGCC GGTGGACCTTCGGTTAATTCGG-5′Bovine BAT-1Gel shift5′-GCAGCAGTGAGGATTAATATGATTAATAACGCCCCC CGTCGTCACTCCTAATTATACTAATTATTGCGGGG-5′Mouse LCRGel shift5′-GACTTGATCTTCTGTTAGCCCTAATCATCAATTAGCA CTGAACTAGAAGACAATCGGGATTAGTAGTTAATCGT-5′Mouse PCE-1Gel shift5′-CAAAAGCTTTCAATTAGCTATTCC GTTTTCGAAAGTTAATCGATAAGG-5′Human ROD ARRESTIN (-202 to +112)PCR and gel shift5′-GCCACGCGTAGTTCCAGAGACACTGA 5′-GCGAGATCTTTCGTGCTGACAGAGTGAMouse Rod arrestin promoterChIP5′-TGATGGTGAAGAGCGAAAGGA 5′-CTGGGCAAGGTGCAAAGAGAMouse Rod arrestin 3′-untranslated regionChIP5′-TTGTAGTTCCGGGTGCCTTG 5′-AATGCTCATGCTTTGATATCTAGCAMouse IrbpChIP5′-CGTCAGATAATGGCTTCCAGAAA 5′-CTCTGTGAGCTGGAAACCTACAAGMouse Irbp promoterChIP5′-AGAGTCCAGCTCATGTGCTTGA 5′-CAGCTCTGCTAAGCCTTTAATCCTMouse Irbp 3′-untranslated regionChIP5′-CATACTGTCTCCAAGAGCAATTCTG 5′-TCACGTGTGCCTTACTTTACATCCMouse Rhodopsin promoterChIP5′-GCCTCCACCCGATGTCAC5′-TCATACTAACGCTAATCCCACTGCTMouse Red/green cone opsin LCRChIP5′-TTGAGTTCTAAGTCTTGGAGTTCCTG 5′-GGTAGTAATCCGCTTTAAGCTAAATCAβ-GlobinChIP5′-TTACTTGAGAGATCCTGACTCAACAATAA 5′-TCAATAACTGCCTTCAGAGAATCG Open table in a new tab Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—The ChIP protocol used here was based on the protocol described by Pattenden and colleagues (22Pattenden S.G. Klose R. Karaskov E. Bremner R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1978-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). P6 CD-1 mice (Charles River, Canada) were decapitated and retinas dissected, frozen on dry ice, and kept at –80 °C until use. Retina was cross-linked with ice-cold 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, and sonicated in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) plus protease inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) to an average DNA size of 1 kb (Vibra Cell, Sonics and Materials Inc., Danbury, CT). The sonicated sample was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was aliquoted to 100 μl (equivalent to 1 whole retina) and diluted to 1 ml with dilution buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8). Each diluted sample was incubated for 1 h with 5 μl of anti-CHX10 antibody, N5, C4, or M1. Samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant mixed with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Sigma), 200 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA (Invitrogen), and 2 mg of yeast tRNA (Invitrogen), and incubated for an additional 1 h. Precipitates were washed sequentially for 10 min in 1× TSEI (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl), 4× TSEII (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl), 1× buffer III (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8), and 3× TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA). Samples were then eluted and cross-links reversed by overnight incubation at 65 °C in 100 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3) and DNA fragments were purified by GFX PCR DNA and the Gel band purification kit (Amersham Biosciences) with a final elution product of 100 μl. Real time PCR (ABI PRISM 7900HT) was used to amplify 2 μl of the final ChIP product, and the copy number was quantified by comparison to a standard curve for each primer set generated with known amounts of sonicated DNA from cross-linked mouse retina. The PCR contained 2 μl each of ChIP sample or serially diluted genomic DNA, 1× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and 500 nm of each primer (Table 1) in a final volume of 10 μl. Amplification involved a two-step PCR with denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s and annealing and extension at 60 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles. Error bars represent the standard deviation of three independent experiments. CHX10 Binds Photoreceptor-specific Elements in Vitro—Because CHX10 is essential in bipolar cell development, it may accomplish this function by repressing genes required for the differentiation of other cell types. The HD proteins Crx and Rx activate photoreceptor-specific gene expression (17Chen S. Wang Q.L. Nie Z. Sun H. Lennon G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Zack D.J.

Ret1 is a highly conserved photoreceptor gene element originally identified in the rat opsin promoter by footprinting assays with retinal nuclear extracts (26Morabito M.A. Yu X. Barnstable C.J. J.

Four copies of this element placed upstream of a lacZ reporter gene have been reported to be sufficient to drive photoreceptor-specific gene expression (26Morabito M.A. Yu X. Barnstable C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9667-9672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Yu X. Leconte L. Martinez J.A. Barnstable C.J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2494-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In a one-hybrid assay using four copies of the bovine Ret1 site (–148 to –126) as bait, 58% of the identified clones encoded Chx10 (Fig. 1A). This data raised the possibility that this sequence or others like it may facilitate repression of photoreceptor genes in non-photoreceptor cell types. To confirm the ability of CHX10 to bind the bovine rhodopsin promoter, we performed a gel shift assay using in vitro translated CHX10 and an end-labeled Ret1 probe (Fig. 1B). CHX10 bound Ret1 and was competed by excess unlabeled Ret1 probe (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3). Excess unlabeled mutated probe did not disrupt the CHX10·Ret1 complex, and CHX10 did not bind the labeled mutated Ret1 site (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 7). In vitro translated luciferase did not bind either probe (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 8). Therefore, CHX10 specifically interacted with the Ret1 site in vitro. Two other developmentally important P3-like elements in the rhodopsin proximal promoter are the Ret4 and BAT-1 sites (21DesJardin L.E. Hauswirth W.W. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 154-165PubMed Google Scholar, 28Chen S. Zack D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28549-28557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The HD protein Crx interacts with both of these elements in vitro (17Chen S. Wang Q.L. Nie Z. Sun H. Lennon G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Zack D.J.

Wang Q.L. Chen S. Muskat B.L. Wiles C.D. Sheffield V.C. Jacobson S.G. McInnes R.R. Zack D.J. Stone E.M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 311-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 30Swain P.K. Chen S.

In previous studies, a GST-tagged version of the Crx HD bound the BAT-1 and Ret1 sites, and a His-tagged form bound Ret4 in gel shift assays (17Chen S. Wang Q.L. Nie Z. Sun H. Lennon G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Zack D.J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1017-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). As well, in vitro footprinting experiments showed that GST-Crx HD could protect the BAT-1, Ret1, and Ret4 sites (17Chen S. Wang Q.L. Nie Z. Sun H. Lennon G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A.

The Crx HD has a lysine at position 50 (Lys50) and is predicted to prefer the core TAATc binding site seen in the BAT-1 and Ret4 motifs as opposed to the TAATt present in the Ret1 motif. In contrast, CHX10 has a Gln50 HD (6Liu I.S. Chen J. Ploder L. Vidgen D. van der Kooy D. Kalnins V.I. McInnes R.R. Neuron. 1994; 13: 377-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), which is predicted to bind to TAATt but not TAATc motifs (31Hanes S.D. Brent R.

Thus, we reexamined the relative affinity of Crx for the three HD binding sites in the Rhodopsin promoter using low amounts of in vitro translated rather than GST- or His-tagged proteins, and compared the results with those for CHX10. In vitro translated CHX10 and Crx proteins were [35S]methionine-labeled and normalized using densitometry (data not shown). As before, CHX10 interacted with the Ret1 probe (Fig. 1C, lane 2), but at this protein level, Crx failed to bind the Ret1 site (Fig. 1C, lane 4). However, Crx did bind the BAT-1 and Ret4 sequences (Fig. 1C, lanes 8, and data not shown), whereas CHX10 did not (Fig. 1C, lane 7, and data not shown). These data illustrate the distinct binding specificities of CHX10 and Crx for TAATT and TAATC motifs, respectively. Interaction of CHX10 with Other Photoreceptor Gene Motifs—Our next goal was to examine whether CHX10 would interact with other elements found in photoreceptor genes. For instance, the PCE-1 site of the ROD ARRESTIN gene (35Kikuchi T. Raju K. Breitman M.L. Shinohara T. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W1993457391,"We have previously shown that the Ste20-like kinase SLK is a microtubule-associated protein that can regulate actin reorganization during cell adhesion and spreading (Wagner, S., Flood, T. A., O'Reilly, P., Hume, K., and Sabourin, L. A. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 37685-37692). Because of its association with the microtubule network, we investigated whether SLK plays a role in cell cycle progression, a process that requires microtubule dynamics during mitosis. Consistent with microtubule association in exponentially growing cells, our results showed that SLK co-localizes with the mitotic spindle in cells undergoing mitosis. Expression of a kinase-inactive mutant or SLK small interfering RNAs inhibited cell proliferation and resulted in an accumulation of quiescent cells stimulated to re-enter the cell cycle in the G2 phase. Cultures expressing the mutant SLK displayed a normal pattern of cyclin D, E, and B expression but failed to down-regulate cyclin A levels, suggesting that they cannot proceed through M phase. In addition, these cultures displayed low levels of both phospho-H3 and active p34/cdc2 kinase. Overexpression of active SLK resulted in ectopic spindle assembly and the induction of cell cycle re-entry of Xenopus oocytes, suggesting that SLK is required for progression through G2 upstream of H1 kinase activation. We have previously shown that the Ste20-like kinase SLK is a microtubule-associated protein that can regulate actin reorganization during cell adhesion and spreading (Wagner, S., Flood, T.

Overexpression of active SLK resulted in ectopic spindle assembly and the induction of cell cycle re-entry of Xenopus oocytes, suggesting that SLK is required for progression through G2 upstream of H1 kinase activation. Cell cycle progression is monitored through kinase-mediated signal transduction and the binding of various cyclin proteins to their respective cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks (2Evans T. Rosenthal E.T. Youngblom J. Distel D. Hunt T. Cell. 1983; 33: 389-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 3Pines J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 697-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar)). The activity of a cyclin/Cdk complex is regulated by cycles of expression and destruction of the cyclin subunit (reviewed in Ref. 4Smits V.A. Medema R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1519: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). G1 progression is regulated, in part, by cyclins D and E and their respective cyclin-dependent kinases in a complex pathway that results in the retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation, and consequently, the production of cyclin A, leading to S phase entry (reviewed in Ref. 5Sherr C.J.

During interphase, cytosolic MPF is kept inactive by inhibitory phosphorylation of cdc2 on Thr-14 and Tyr-15 by Myt1 and Wee1, respectively (9Liu F. Stanton J.J. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 10Booher R.N. Holman P.S. Fattaey A. J. Biol.

Activation of this complex is triggered by the Cdc25C phosphatase through cdc2 dephosphorylation of Thr-14 and Tyr-15 (12Dunphy W.G. Kumagai A.

Following dephosphorylation of these residues, MPF is believed to phosphorylate and further activate Cdc25C, resulting in full activation of MPF through an autocatalytic feedback loop (15Hoffmann I.

Cell. 1993; 4: 1337-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). This results in the translocation of MPF from the cytoplasm to the nucleus at the beginning of mitosis (17Pines J. Hunter T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), where it phosphorylates histone H1 (18Roth S.Y. Collini M.P. Draetta G. Beach D. Allis C.D.

In Xenopus, polo-like kinase (Plx1) has been shown to phosphorylate and activate Cdc25 (21Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1996; 273: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), and polo-like kinase kinase (xPlkk1) has been shown to be a direct activator of Plx1 (22Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1701-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, this may be an organism-specific phenomenon since depletion of mammalian polo-like kinase (Plk1) results in elevated activity of Cdc2 (23Liu X. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8672-8676Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for Plk in mitotic progression rather than mitotic entry. To date, a bona fide upstream activator of mammalian Cdc25C has not been identified. Chromosome condensation is accompanied by the hyperphosphorylation of histone H1 (24Bradbury E.M. Inglis R.J. Matthews H.R. Sarner N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 33: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and phosphorylation of H3 on Ser-10 (25Allis C.D.

Chromosoma (Berl.). 1997; 106: 348-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar). Microtubules then organize into a bipolar spindle and attach to the kinetochores of each sister chromosome. Chromosome attachment prior to segregation is monitored by the spindle checkpoint protein MAD2 (mitotic arrest-deficient), which binds kinetochores lacking microtubule attachment generating a “wait-anaphase” signal (reviewed in Ref. 27Shah J.V. Cleveland D.W. Cell. 2000; 103: 997-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Following the attachment of the last unattached kinetochore, the wait-anaphase signal is silenced, and the anaphase-promoting complex, in association with Cdc20, initiates chromosome segregation (reviewed in Ref. 28Peters J.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 931-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar) and culminates into cytokinesis (reviewed in Ref. 29Scholey J.M. Brust-Mascher I. Mogilner A. Nature. 2003; 422: 746-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The murine Ste20-like kinase (SLK) is a 220-kDa serine/threonine kinase that was first demonstrated to induce actin remodeling and apoptosis in a wide range of cell lines (30Sabourin L.A. Rudnicki M.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7566-7575Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 31Sabourin L.A. Tamai K. Seale P. Wagner J. Rudnicki M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 684-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal kinase domain of SLK is closely related to that of lymphocyte-oriented kinase (LOK) and xPlkk1. In addition, SLK bears a central microtubule and nuclear-associated protein domain and a carboxyl AT1-46 homology (termed ATH for AT1-46 homology) domain that is also found in LOK and xPlkk1 (30Sabourin L.A. Rudnicki M.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7566-7575Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 31Sabourin L.A. Tamai K. Seale P. Wagner J. Rudnicki M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 684-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The function of both the nuclear-associated protein and the AT1-46 domains has yet to be elucidated. SLK is expressed early in development, preferentially in neuronal and myogenic lineages and ubiquitously in adult tissue (32Zhang Y.H. Hume K. Cadonic R. Thompson C. Hakim A. Staines W. Sabourin L.A. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2002; 139: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It has been shown to co-localize with adhesion markers during cell spreading and is intimately linked to the microtubule network (1Wagner S. Flood T.A. O'Reilly P. Hume K. Sabourin L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37685-37692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The observation that SLK is associated with the microtubule network (1Wagner S. Flood T.A. O'Reilly P. Hume K. Sabourin L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37685-37692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and that it was shown to phosphorylate and activate Plk (33Ellinger-Ziegelbauer H. Karasuyama H. Yamada E. Tsujikawa K. Todokoro K. Nishida E. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) prompted us to investigate the role of SLK in cell cycle progression. Consistent with microtubule association in exponentially growing cells, our results showed that SLK co-localizes with the mitotic spindle in cells undergoing mitosis. Down-regulation of SLK protein levels by siRNA knockdown or expression of a kinase-inactive mutant (KΔC) inhibited cell proliferation and resulted in a G2/M accumulation of quiescent cells induced to re-enter the cell cycle by serum stimulation. Cultures expressing the mutant SLK displayed a normal pattern of cyclin D, E, and B expression but failed to down-regulate cyclin A levels, suggesting that they cannot proceed through M phase. Supporting this, cells expressing the inactive SLK mutant failed to induce histone H3 phosphorylation and to fully activate p34/Cdc2. Finally, overexpression of an activated kinase resulted in ectopic spindle formation and activation Plx1 in Xenopus extracts, suggesting that activated SLK induces cell cycle re-entry. Overall, our results suggested that SLK is required for progression through G2 upstream of Cdc2. Cell Lines, Culture, and Adenovirus Infection—The mouse fibroblast lines MEF-3T3 (MEF Tet-Off, C3018, Clontech) and C3H10T1/2 (ATCC number CCL-226) were used in all experiments. Similar results were obtained for both cell lines. The GFP-tubulin-expressing cells (LLCKP-1) were a kind gift from Patricia Wadsworth (34Rusan N.M. Fagerstrom C.J. Yvon A.-M. C. Wadsworth P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Cell lines were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. For cell cycle experiments, fibroblasts were arrested by 48-h incubations in 0.25% FBS-DMEM and released from quiescence by the addition of 20% FBS-DMEM. The epitope-tagged kinase-dead or activated versions of SLK used in these studies (HA-KΔC or HA-YΔC) have been described previously (1Wagner S. Flood T.A. O'Reilly P. Hume K. Sabourin L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37685-37692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and consist of a carboxyl-terminal truncation (amino acids 1-373) with or without an ATP-binding site (Lys-63 → Arg) mutation. To monitor the effect of kinase-deficient SLK on cell cycle kinetics, adenoviral vectors expressing HA-KΔC or a β-galactosidase (LacZ) control were used to infect quiescent cultures. Cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 100 by the addition of the adenovirus directly to cells in 0.25% FBS-DMEM 16 h before the addition of 20% FBS-DMEM and analysis. To isolate fibroblast populations synchronized at M phase, the cultures were treated overnight with nocodazole (40 ng/ml, Sigma) and shaken off into PBS by aggressive tapping against a solid surface. Detached cells floating in PBS were then collected by centrifugation. For mitotic spindle induction experiments, LLCKP-1 cells expressing GFP-tubulin were microinjected with HA-YΔC expression plasmid as described previously (1Wagner S. Flood T.A. O'Reilly P. Hume K. Sabourin L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37685-37692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Xenopus oocytes were prepared and injected with cRNA as described (35Vicogne J. Cailliau K. Tulasne D. Browaeys E. Yan Y.T. Fafeur V. Vilain J.P. Legrand D. Trolet J. Dissous C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37407-37414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) was determined from at least 20 oocytes pooled from two animals 15 h following SLK injection or progesterone treatment. Western blot analysis for Myc-SLK was performed 15 h after injection. Western Blotting, Immunoprecipitations, and in Vitro Kinase Assays—For protein analysis, the cells were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation buffer as described previously (1Wagner S. Flood T.A. O'Reilly P. Hume K. Sabourin L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37685-37692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), which were then probed with the following antibodies: anti-Cdc2 and anti-cyclins D, E, A, and B (Upstate Biotechnology). The SLK antibody was as described previously (30Sabourin L.A. Rudnicki M.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7566-7575Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were detected using either a goat anti-rabbit IgG or a goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) and visualized using Western Lightning chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposure to x-ray film. SLK immunoprecipitations and kinase assays were carried out essentially as described previously (31Sabourin L.A. Tamai K. Seale P. Wagner J. Rudnicki M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 684-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts of lysate were immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4 °C using 1 μg of SLK antibody and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitates were then washed three times with NETN (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and once with kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 15 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm orthovanadate). Kinase reactions (20 μl) were then initiated by the addition of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. These reactions were terminated by the addition of 4× SDS loading buffer and then resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and exposed to x-ray film. Membranes were then probed for SLK to assess immunoprecipitation efficiency. SLK autophosphorylation was used as an indicator of kinase activity. Immunofluorescence and Flow Cytometry—Immunofluorescence studies were carried out by fixation of cells growing on glass coverslips in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h. The primary antibodies used in immunofluorescence studies were as follows: anti-α-tubulin (clone DM1, Sigma), anti-phospho-H3 (Ser-10) (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-β-galactosidase (Promega), anti-HA (12CA5 or sc-805, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), and anti-SLK (30Sabourin L.A. Rudnicki M.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7566-7575Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Antibodies were detected with either anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to either fluorescein isothiocyanate or TRITC (Sigma). 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 0.25 μg/ml) was used to stain DNA, and the samples were visualized with a Zeiss Axioscope100 epifluorescence microscope equipped with the appropriate filters and photographed with a digital camera (Sony Corp. HB050) using the Northern Eclipse software package. Quantitative analysis for phospho-H3 (pH3) immunostaining was performed by visually scoring stained cells for both HA (or LacZ) and pH3. The data were graphed as double positive (HA or LacZ + pH3) cells for each time point analyzed. At least 200 HA or LacZ-positive cells were scored for each time point. Cells analyzed by flow cytometry were trypsinized and washed once in 10% FBS-DMEM. Cells were then washed twice in PBS supplemented with 1 mm EDTA (PBSE) and then fixed in 1 ml of PBSE by the dropwise addition of 2 ml of 80% ethanol prechilled to -20 °C. The samples were then stored at -20 °C for a minimum of 2 h, washed once in PBSE, resuspended in DNA content staining buffer (1.1% citrate buffer, 10 μg/ml propidium iodide, 1 mg/ml RNase), and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C before being analyzed on a Beckman Coulter flow cytometer using the Expo 32 software package. BrdUrd pulse labeling was performed using a BrdUrd flow kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 16 h before labeling, cultures were infected with either HA-KΔC or LacZ adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 100 for 90 min in unsupplemented DMEM and then grown in 10% FBS-DMEM. The cultures were then labeled with BrdUrd for 1 h and collected at various times. The DNA content of BrdUrd positive cells was then analyzed flow cytometrically. Cell Counts, Cloning, and Transfections—To monitor cell proliferation, the cells were counted after infection on day 0 at a multiplicity of infection of 100 as described above. Cell populations were trypsinized and scored by trypan blue exclusion over time. Cell counts were performed in triplicates in three independent experiments. For antisense SLK expression, a 5′ 300-bp SLK fragment was cloned into the pEMSV-puro expression vector in the reverse orientation. The antisense SLK plasmid and the puromycin control were then transfected into MEF-3T3 cells using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol and selected in puromycin (100 μg/ml) over a 2-week period. Following selection, stable transfectants were visualized using CYTO-QUIK staining (Fisher Health Care) followed by several PBS washes. SLK Smart Pools siRNAs were obtained from Dharmacon against the following murine SLK target sequences: 5′-GGTTGAGATTGACATATTA-3′, in addition to a scrambled siRNA (5′-GATAATTTATGGATGTGAC-3′). Control siRNA consisted of the siCONTROL (Dharmacon; 5′-UAGCGACUAAACACAUCAAUU-3′), having no perfect match to known human or mouse sequences. All siRNAs were transfected using the Transit-TKO reagent (Mirrus Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SLK Co-localizes with the Mitotic Spindle and Is Regulated during the Cell Cycle—We have previously shown that a proportion of SLK is associated with the microtubule network of exponentially growing fibroblasts (1Wagner S. Flood T.A. O'Reilly P. Hume K. Sabourin L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37685-37692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). During immunofluorescence studies involving the co-localization of SLK to the microtubule network in asynchronous cultures, we observed rare patterns of SLK and α-tubulin co-localization that resembled the mitotic spindle. To further investigate the possibility that SLK might co-localize with the mitotic spindle, we performed confocal microscopy. Although some SLK was found outside of the mitotic spindle, confocal analysis of DAPI-stained cells, in combination with anti-SLK and anti-α-tubulin, shows that most of the SLK staining co-localized with tubulin during metaphase (Fig. 1, A and B). The observation that SLK is associated with α-tubulin, a central component of the mitotic machinery, suggests a role for SLK during mitosis. Alternatively, SLK may be required for spindle assembly. To further investigate the potential role of SLK in cell cycle progression, its activity was monitored throughout the different phases of the cell cycle using synchronized cell populations. Serum-starved cultures were released from G0 by the addition of serum, collected at various times, and monitored for SLK activity and DNA content by kinase assays and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, respectively. Fig. 2A displays the cell cycle phase as determined by flow cytometric measurements of DNA content in these synchronized populations following serum stimulation. After 24 h of serum stimulation, a marked and consistent 3-4-fold increase in SLK kinase activity (Fig. 2B) was observed when ∼60-70% of the cells entered the G2/M compartment, as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Similarly, an increase in SLK activity during G2 has been reported previously, albeit to a much lesser extent (∼1.3-fold) (33Ellinger-Ziegelbauer H. Karasuyama H. Yamada E. Tsujikawa K. Todokoro K. Nishida E. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Interestingly, as the cells exited M phase and re-entered G1, a marked reduction in kinase activity was observed. The total levels of SLK protein were found to be unaffected throughout the time course. These results suggested that SLK kinase activity is up-regulated at a time point at which the vast majority of the cells display a 4N DNA content. Kinase-deficient SLK Inhibits Proliferation—To investigate the potential role of SLK in proliferation, an expression vector bearing an antisense SLK fragment was transfected into MEF-3T3 fibroblasts and subjected to puromycin selection. Stable clones were visualized after 14 days using Cyto-Quick stain (Fisher). As shown in Fig. 2C, antisense SLK-transfected cultures reproducibly displayed a marked reduction in colony numbers when compared with the pEMSV-puro control vector. Furthermore, expansion and Western blot analysis of the resulting antisense SLK clones showed that they did not down-regulate SLK, suggesting that the antisense RNA was not expressed in those clones (not shown). As for antisense SLK expression, infection of MEF-3T3 cells with an adenoviral vector carrying a kinase-dead truncation of SLK (SLK1-373K63R, termed HA-KΔC) suppressed cell proliferation as determined by dye exclusion cell counts (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these results indicate that SLK activity is required for cell proliferation and that our truncated kinase-dead version, HA-KΔC, is able to interfere with SLK-dependent pathways. SLK Is Required for Progression through G2—To further investigate the mechanism by which KΔC inhibits proliferation, quiescent MEF-3T3 cultures were infected with a KΔC-expressing adenovirus or control LacZ virus, serum-stimulated, and subjected to DNA content analysis over time. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, cultures expressing LacZ proceeded through the cell cycle and exited the G2/M compartment by 32 h following serum stimulation. In contrast, KΔC-expressing cultures displayed a marked increase in the proportion of cells in the G2/M compartment, suggesting that KΔC expression delays progression through the G2 or M phase by inducing a specific block, or alternatively, a failure to exit M phase. Supporting these data, flow tracking of BrdUrd-pulsed exponentially growing KΔC-infected cultures showed that they proceed through the G2/M compartment with delayed kinetics when compared with LacZ-infected cells. Taken together, these results suggested that SLK is required for normal progression through the G2 or M phase. The levels of the various cyclins have been demonstrated to fluctuate during the cell cycle (reviewed in Ref. 5Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5072) Google Scholar). Cyclin D has been observed to be induced prior to S phase and to remain elevated in proliferating cells. Cyclin E is transiently up-regulated at the G1/S boundary, whereas cyclins A and B are induced at the S/G2 boundary and down-regulated at the onset and the end of M phase, respectively. Therefore, to better define the cell cycle block induced by kinase-deficient SLK, control and KΔC-infected cultures were surveyed for cyclin expression over time following release from Go. The infection efficiency was found to be typically between 70 and 80% for both viruses, and the HA-KΔC protein was observed to be expressed at levels that were similar to endogenous SLK (data not shown). Our results show that, relative to actin, cyclin D was slightly up-regulated following serum stimulation in both the control and the KΔC-infected cultures, suggesting that they re-entered the cell cycle (Fig. 4A). Similarly, cyclin E levels were up-regulated 16 h following stimulation, when a significant proportion of the cells entered S phase (Fig. 2A), and down-regulated thereafter, suggesting that both cultures entered and exited S phase with similar kinetics. In addition, both cultures induced cyclin B expression at ∼8-16 h. Similarly, both cultures induced cyclin A at the G1/S transition. However, only control-infected cultures showed a marked and reproducible down-regulation at 32 h, suggesting that KΔC-expressing cells fail to down-regulate cyclin A. Cyclin A degradation has been shown to occur during prometaphase, at the onset of mitosis (36Geley S. Kramer E. Gieffers C. Gannon J. Peters J.M. Hunt T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 37den Elzen N. Pines J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Therefore, our observations suggested that the KΔC-induced cell cycle block occurs in G2, prior to M phase. One possibility is that the cell cycle block induced by KΔC fails to activate specific signals required for cyclin A degradation (36Geley S. Kramer E. Gieffers C. Gannon J. Peters J.M. Hunt T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 37den Elzen N. Pines J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Alternatively, SLK may be required for the direct activation of these checkpoints or proteolysis of cyclin A. During interphase, cytosolic MPF is kept inactive by inhibitory phosphorylation of cdc2 on Thr-14 and Tyr-15 by Myt1 and Wee1, respectively (9Liu F. Stanton J.J. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 10Booher R.N. Holman P.S. Fattaey A. J. Biol.

Science. 1992; 257: 1955-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Activation of this complex is triggered by the Cdc25C phosphatase through cdc2 dephosphorylation of Thr-14 and Tyr-15 (12Dunphy W.G. Kumagai A. Cell. 1991; 67: 189-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 13Millar J.B. McGowan C.H. Lenaers G. Jones R. Russell P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4301-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 14Lee M.S. Ogg S. Xu M. Parker L.L. Donoghue D.J. Maller J.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In agreement with elevated cyclin A levels, KΔC-infected cultures did not significantly up-regulate Cdc2 activity as evidenced by the high levels of Cdc2 tyrosine 15 phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). These results strongly suggest that KΔC induces a cell cycle block prior to mitotic entry, in G2. Supporting this, KΔC-positive cells were not found to assemble mitotic spindles 24 h after stimulation, at which point 60% of the cells displayed 4N DNA content (data not shown). Chromosome condensation initiated in early G2 (38Pines J. Rieder C.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E3-E6Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) is accompanied by the hyperphosphorylation of histone H1 (24Bradbury E.M. Inglis R.J. Matthews H.R. Sarner N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 33: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and phosphorylation of H3 (25Allis C.D. Gorovsky M.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3828-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) on Ser-10 (26Hendzel M.J. Wei Y. Mancini M.A. Van Hooser A. Ranalli T. Brinkley B.R. Bazett-Jones D.P. Allis C.D. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1997; 106: 348-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar). To further refine the cell cycle block induced by KΔC expression, adenovirus-infected cultures were stained for both KΔC expression and phospho-H3. Double immunostaining of serum-stimulated fibroblast cultures at 24 h (Fig. 5, A-F) shows that H3 phosphorylation was markedly reduced in KΔC-expressing cells in comparison with control infected cultures. Although the proportion of HA- and phospho-H3-positive cells slightly increased at 28 and 32 h after stimulation, their number was significantly lower than control cells, suggesting that KΔC-expressing cells are delayed in early G2. SLK Expression Induces Spindle Formation and Mitotic Entry—Our results showed that expression of a kinase-inactive SLK is sufficient to induce an early G2 cell cycle block in cycling fibroblasts, suggesting that an SLK-dependent pathway is required during G2 for progression into mitosis. To determine whether SLK plays a central role in G2 and to rule out potential nonspecific effects by KΔC overexpression, exponentially growing fibroblasts were transfected with an SLK siRNA pool and subjected to DNA content analysis. Transfection of SLK siRNAs down-regulated SLK protein levels by 80-90% within 48 h (Fig. 6A). No effect was observed in the siRNA control samples. DNA content analysis 48 h following siRNA transfection showed that SLK knockdown resulted in a marked G2/M accumulation (92% 4N DNA content; Fig. 6B), an inhibition of proliferation, and increased cyclin A levels (data not shown). These data further support a role for SLK in cell cycle progression and rule out potential nonspecific effects by KΔC overexpression. Supporting these results, microinjection of activated SLK (SLK1-373) in GFP-tubulin labeled cells induced ectopic mitotic spindles in the injected cells within 3-6 h, ultimately resulting in cell death (Fig. 6C) (1Wagner S. Flood T.A. O'Reilly P. Hume K. Sabourin L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37685-37692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Similarly, injection of the activated SLK, but not kinase-dead, mRNA in Xenopus oocytes resulted in the hyperphosphorylation of Plx1 and GVBD without progesterone induction, suggesting that the injected eggs re-entered the cell cycle as for progesterone-treated oocytes (Fig. 6D). Interestingly, expression of a kinase-dead version followed by progesterone treatment did not inhibit cell cycle re-entry and GVBD (not shown), suggesting that alternative pathways, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, may be sufficient to promote maturation (39Schmitt A. Nebreda A.R. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2457-2459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) Cell cycle progression is regulated by complex signaling networks involving post-translational modification, gene expression, and cytoskeletal reorganization. Progress through the various phases involves the activation of key factors and is monitored by various checkpoint proteins. We have previously isolated an Ste20-like kinase termed SLK that is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization (1Wagner S. Flood T.A. O'Reilly P. Hume K. Sabourin L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37685-37692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 30Sabourin L.A.

Biol. 2000; 20: 684-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a fraction of SLK protein is also observed to associate with the microtubule network in spreading and exponentially growing cells (1Wagner S. Flood T.A. O'Reilly P. Hume K. Sabourin L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37685-37692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that SLK also associates with the microtubule network at mitosis, suggesting that it plays a role in cell cycle progression. To investigate this, the activity and expression of SLK was evaluated throughout the cell cycle, and the effect of a kinase-defective SLK on cell cycle progression was assessed. Our results showed that SLK co-localizes with the mitotic spindle during M phase and that its kinase activity is up-regulated as synchronized fibroblast cultures enter the G2/M compartment. Expression of an antisense SLK construct or a kinase-deficient mutant inhibited cell proliferation. Flow cytometric analysis of these populations showed that SLK is required for progression through the G2/M compartment and that cells expressing a kinase-inactive SLK fail to down-regulate cyclin A. Furthermore, we have observed that cultures expressing an inactive SLK show reduced histone H3 phosphorylation and p34Cdc2 activation. Supporting this, overexpression of activated SLK induced spindle formation and cell cycle re-entry in Xenopus oocytes. Overall, our data suggested that SLK is required upstream of Cdc2 and that interfering with SLK-dependent pathways leads to cell cycle arrest early in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. An interpretation of the data presented here indicated that SLK is required during G2, at a point after cyclin A expression and before Cdc2 activation, for progression into mitosis. A Xenopus LOK/Stx10 homolog, xPolo-like kinase kinase (xPlkk1), has been demonstrated to activate Plx1 (22Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1701-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Interestingly, SLK has been demonstrated to phosphorylate and activate Plk in a mammalian system (33Ellinger-Ziegelbauer H. Karasuyama H. Yamada E. Tsujikawa K. Todokoro K. Nishida E. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, we and others 4P. Stambrook, personal communication. have not observed phosphorylation and activation of mammalian Plk1 by SLK in in vitro kinase assays or transient transfections (not shown). An evolutionary conserved relationship appears to exist between mammalian and amphibian Ste20-like kinases, the polo-like kinase family, and the Cdc25C phosphatase. The human homolog of the Ste20-like kinase LOK, Stx10, has been shown to associate with and phosphorylate Plk1 (40Walter S.A. Cutler Jr., R.E. Martinez R. Gishizky M. Hill R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18221-18228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and Plk3 has been shown to initiate the nuclear translocation of Cdc25C by phosphorylating Cdc25C on serine 191 (41Bahassi M. Hennigan R.F. Myer D.L. Stambrook P.J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2658-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In Xenopus, the polo-like kinase, Plx1, has been shown to activate Cdc25C (21Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1996; 273: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), an event that has not been unarguably proven in a mammalian system and may be species-specific. If Plk requires a signal from SLK to activate Cdc25C in a mammalian system, one would predict a G2/M arrest, similar to the findings presented here. This would result in a Cdc25C protein that is deficient in all of the post-translational modifications required to initiate mitosis. However, the questionable validity and specificity of phospho-specific Cdc25C antibodies has made the identification of the various forms of the phospho-Cdc25C difficult and inconclusive (not shown). We have previously shown that SLK can induce actin depolymerization and cell death in various cell lines (1Wagner S. Flood T.A. O'Reilly P. Hume K. Sabourin L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37685-37692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Sabourin L.A. Tamai K. Seale P. Wagner J. Rudnicki M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 684-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). One possibility is that SLK overexpression in cycling cells induces a deregulated mitotic entry, bypassing cell cycle controls, resulting in actin breakdown and death. Alternatively, SLK-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization may be required for, or trigger, checkpoint activation, G2 progression, and mitotic entry. Overall, we have shown that SLK is a component of the mitotic spindle and that its activity is required in G2, upstream of Cdc2, for efficient progression into mitosis. The characterization of the molecular components of SLK-dependent signaling pathways now awaits the identification of its substrates and binding proteins. We are grateful to Patricia Wadsworth for providing the LLCKP-1 cells expressing GFP-tubulin."
https://openalex.org/W2017318922,"In all vertebrates, thyroid hormones (TH) affect postembryonic development. The role of the TH receptor (TR) in mediating the TH signal is complex as evidenced by divergent phenotypes in mice lacking TH compared with TR knock-out mice. We have proposed a dual function model for TR during development based on studies of frog metamorphosis. Here we examined an important assumption of this dual function model by using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, namely constitutive TR binding to promoters in vivo. We examined two target genes with TH-response elements (TRE) in their promoters, TRβ itself and TH/bZIP (TH-responsive basic leucine zipper transcription factor). By using an antibody that recognizes both TRα and TRβ, we found that TR binding to the TRβ promoter is indeed constitutive. Most surprisingly, TR binding to the TH/bZIP promoter increases dramatically after TH treatment of premetamorphic tadpoles and during metamorphosis. By using an antibody specific to TRβ,TRβ binding increases at both promoters in response to TH. In vitro biochemical studies showed that TRs bind TH/bZIP TRE with 4-fold lower affinity than to TRβ TRE. Our data show that only high affinity TRβ TRE is occupied by limiting levels of TR during premetamorphosis and that lower affinity TH/bZIP TRE becomes occupied only when overall the TR expression is higher during metamorphosis. These data provide the first in vivo evidence to suggest that one mechanism for tissue- and gene-specific regulation of TR target gene expression is through tissue and developmental stage-dependent regulation of TR levels, likely a critical mechanism for coordinating development in different organs during postembryonic development.

The above knowledge based on in vitro studies complements extensive studies on the developmental role of TRs in frogs and TR knock-out mice. TR is important for postembryonic development of many organs (12Yen P.M. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1097-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar). The destruction of larval organs and the formation of adult organs during frog metamorphosis is totally dependent upon TH (13Dodd M.H.I. Dodd J.M. Physiology of Amphibia. 1976; 3: 467-599Crossref Google Scholar, 14Shi Y.-B. Amphibian Metamorphosis: From Morphology to Molecular Biology. 1999; Google Scholar). Transgenic overexpression of mutant TRs and cofactors showed gene activation by TR is necessary and sufficient to initiate TH-dependent developmental transitions in frogs (15Buchholz D.R. Hsia S.-C.V. Fu L. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6750-6758Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 16Buchholz D.R. Tomita A. Fu L. Paul B.D. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9026-9037Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In knock-out mice lacking TRs, developmental defects are evident in brain, heart, and intestine, among other organs (17Flamant F. Samarut J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 14: 85-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Similar observations on the importance of TR in development have been noted in all vertebrates studied, including humans (18Dussault J.H. Ruel J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1987; 49: 321-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), fish (19Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13011-13016Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), and chickens (20Forrest D. Sjoberg M. Vennstrom B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1519-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, the phenotype of TR knock-out mice is dramatically different from mice lacking TH (17Flamant F. Samarut J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 14: 85-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Therefore, the study of the molecular mechanisms of TR in gene regulation in vivo is important for understanding the developmental actions of TR. To bridge the gap between our knowledge of the developmental roles in vivo and the molecular mechanisms of TR action in vitro, we developed the dual function model for the role of TR during development (21Sachs L.M. Damjanovski S. Jones P.L. Li Q. Amano T. Ueda S. Shi Y.-B. IshizuyaOka A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 2000; 126: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 22Buchholz D.R. Paul B.D. Fu L. Shi Y.-B. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 2006; PubMed Google Scholar). Frog metamorphosis is a valuable model for studying hormonal control of postembryonic development because premetamorphic tadpoles naturally lack TH, and the large size of tadpoles allows direct study of the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation during development in vivo. In frogs, TRα is expressed throughout larval development, well before TH is synthesized and secreted into the blood, and both TRα and TRβ are expressed during metamorphic climax, characterized by extensive organ remodeling and high levels of TH (14Shi Y.-B. Amphibian Metamorphosis: From Morphology to Molecular Biology. 1999; Google Scholar). In the dual function model, during premetamorphosis TRα binds corepressors to deacetylate histones and down-regulate TH-response genes, while during metamorphic climax, TRα and TRβ activate those same genes by acetylating histones via binding coactivators in the presence of TH. In vivo support for this model comes from chromatin immunoprecipitation studies on TH-responsive promoters. Corepressor binding has been detected at TREs in premetamorphic tadpoles, and this binding is associated with low levels of acetylated histones (23Sachs L.M. Shi Y.-B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 13138-13143Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 24Sachs L.M. Jones P.L. Havis E. Rouse N. Demeneix B.A. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8527-8538Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 25Tomita A. Buchholz D.R. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3337-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Conversely, coactivator binding with high levels of acetylated histones has been found during metamorphic climax (4Paul B.D. Fu L. Buchholz D.R. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5712-5724Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26Paul B.D. Buchholz D.R. Fu L. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol.

Demeneix B.A. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 883-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A critical parameter for the dual function model is TR binding to TH-inducible genes in vivo. Even though ChIP assays suggest that TRs bind during both premetamorphosis and climax when TH is absent and present, respectively, developmental changes in TR expression hinted that levels of TR binding to TH-response promoters might vary dramatically during development. Here we used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to quantify TR binding to two different promoters during development, and we identified a contributing factor to differences we observed for TR binding between the promoters. These results expand our understanding of tissue- and gene-dependent roles of TR during development. Animals and Antibodies—Xenopus laevis tadpoles and adults were reared in the laboratory or purchased from Xenopus I, Inc. Tadpoles at the indicated developmental stages (28Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis (Daudin). 1994; Google Scholar) or premetamorphic tadpoles (stages 52–54) treated with 10 nm triiodothyronine (T3) for 1–3 days at 18 °C with daily water changes without feeding were used for chromatin immunoprecipitation. We used the following two rabbit antisera against TR: 1) anti-TR(PB) made by injecting full-length TRα but recognizes both TRα and TRβ (29Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18479-18483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and 2) anti-TRβ made by coinjecting two synthetic peptides, REKRRKDEIQKSLVQKPEPT (amino acids 104–123 of TRβ synthesized on 8-MAP) and DRPGLASVERIEK (amino acids 290–302 of TRβ conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin). Anti-ID14 antiserum made in rabbits immunized against the peptide ETKCRCNMDGDVE conjugated to 8-MAP (Invitrogen) was used as a negative control. ID14 is a novel extracellular protein expressed by intestinal epithelial cells (30Buchholz D.R. Ishizuya-Oka A. Shi Y.-B. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2004; 4: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin was isolated from tadpole tails or intestines flushed with 0.6× phosphate-buffered saline. Organs were placed in 1 ml of nuclei extraction buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mm CaCl2, 0.25 m sucrose, with protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science, Complete, Mini, EDTA-free), 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) in Dounce homogenizers on ice and crushed with 10–15 strokes using pestle A (Kontes). The homogenate was fixed in 1% formaldehyde with rotation at room temperature for 20 min, and the fixation was stopped with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.5. The homogenate was centrifuged at 2000 × g at 4 °C for 2 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of nuclei extraction buffer and re-homogenized in Dounce with 5–10 strokes using pestle A for tails and pestle B for intestines. Then the homogenate was filtered through a Falcon 100-μm cell strainer and centrifuged at 2000 × g at 4 °C for 2 min. The pellet was resuspended in 200–300 μl of SDS lysis buffer (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions) on ice, sonicated to an average length of 800 bp, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The chromatin in the supernatant was quantitated and frozen in aliquots at -80 °C. For immunoprecipitation as reported previously (25Tomita A. Buchholz D.R. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3337-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the DNA concentration of the chromatin was adjusted to 100 ng/μl using the SDS lysis buffer, and then diluted to 10 ng/μl with ChIP dilution buffer (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions). After preclearing with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions), input samples were taken, and 500 μl of each chromatin sample was added to tubes with anti-TR(PB), anti-TRβ, or anti-ID14 antibodies and salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose beads and incubated with rotation from 4 h to overnight at 4 °C. After incubation, the beads were washed with 1 ml of ChIP Buffer I (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), Buffer II (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl), Buffer III (0.25 m LiCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) in succession. After the last wash, 100 μl of elution buffer (0.5% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3 (Sigma), 25 μg/ml proteinase K (Roche Applied Science)) was added to the samples and input controls and rotated at 65 °C for 6 h to overnight. The ChIP DNA was purified using the QIA-quick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and eluted with 40 μl of EB buffer (Qiagen, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5). Analysis of ChIP DNA was done as described previously for radioactive PCR followed by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (25Tomita A. Buchholz D.R. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3337-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and quantitative PCR (16Buchholz D.R. Tomita A. Fu L. Paul B.D. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9026-9037Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Analysis of variance and post hoc tests of quantitative PCR results were carried out using Statview statistical software (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). Gel Mobility Shift Assay—Receptor mRNA was made for TRαA, TRβAII, or RXRα contained in pSP64(poly(A)) (29Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18479-18483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 31Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using mMessage mMachine (Ambion). Large batches of oocyte extracts for TRα, TRβ, and RXRα were prepared by injecting 30–50 oocytes with 23 nl of 330 ng/μl receptor mRNA. After overnight incubation, surviving oocytes were homogenized in 20 μl of binding buffer per oocyte (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Homogenate was centrifuged in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at top speed at 4 °C for 10 min. Supernatant was collected and recentrifuged to remove lipids and debris. Aliquots were frozen at -80 °C. To ensure similar amounts of TRα and TRβ in the extracts, a preliminary experiment was done by injecting TRα and TRβ mRNA and metabolically labeling the proteins with [35S]methionine. Oocyte extracts were then run on a gel and exposed to film to determine the amount of mRNA needed to produce equal amounts of TRα and TRβ by taking into account the number of methionines in each receptor. Probes for the gel mobility shift assay spanned the single TRE in TRβ (31Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the two TREs in TH/bZIP (32Furlow J.D. Kanamori A. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3295-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and had 4-bp overhangs on both 5′ and 3′ ends. The sequences were 5′-CGTCCTCCCTAGGCAGGTCATTTCAGGACAGCCCAGCGCCC and 5′-ACCAGGGCGCTGGGCTGTCCTGAAATGACCTGCCTAGGGAG for TRβ and 5′-ACTAGGGTTAAGTAAGGTGAATGCTCAGCCTCATTTGAACT and 5′-ACAGAGTTCAAATGAGGCTGAGCATTCACCTTACTTAACCC for TH/bZIP. Probes were annealed by adding 5 μl of 5 pmol/μl of each strand to Buffer III (New England Biolabs) in a 1.7-ml Eppendorf tube, putting the tubes in a beaker of boiling water, and allowing them to cool to room temperature. After ethanol precipitation, the pellet was dissolved in 12 μl of TE buffer, and the probe was labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase in the forward reaction buffer in a 25-μl reaction (Invitrogen). After stopping the reaction and increasing the volume to 50 μl, unincorporated nucleotides were removed using a G-50 column (Amersham Biosciences) so that the final probe concentration was 0.1 pmol/μl. Gel mobility shift assays were done based on procedures described previously (29Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18479-18483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 31Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oocyte extracts (1–2 μl) from oocytes injected with RXRα and oocytes injected with either TRα or TRβ were mixed and incubated on ice for 10 min. The binding buffer (enough for a final reaction volume of 15 μl) and 1 μl of 2 μg/μl of sonicated poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences) in binding buffer was then added and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. 1 μl of 0.1 pmol/μl labeled probe and, as indicated, 3–15× unlabeled probe was then added and incubated for another 20 min. Gel mobility shift samples were run on a 6% PAGE in 0.5× TBE buffer (Invitrogen) at 250 V for 15 min. Gels were dried and exposed to film 15 min to overnight. Scatchard plot analysis was done using the public domain NIH Image program (developed at National Institutes of Health and available on the internet at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image) to determine the total counts bound and total counts free and then graphing bound versus bound/free in Statview (Abacus Concepts) to calculate the slope. In Vitro Transcription and Western Blotting—The pSP64(poly(A)) vector (Promega) containing TRαA or TRβAII (29Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18479-18483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) was linearized with EcoRI and in vitro transcribed and translated following the manufacturer's protocol (TnT Quick Coupled transcription/translation system, Promega). Standard protocols for SDS-PAGE and protein transfer were performed, followed by Western blotting using anti-TR(PB) and anti-TRβ (38Eliceiri B.P. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24459-24465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) antibodies and ECL-plus chemiluminescent detection (Amersham Biosciences). TR Binding to TREs in Vivo Is Gene-specific and TH-dependent—Because TR function is critical for metamorphosis and vertebrate development in general, molecular mechanisms for regulating specific TH-response genes in vivo are of considerable interest. Based on in vitro studies, TR binds TREs constitutively, i.e. TRs bind TREs in the absence and presence of ligand (1Zhang J. Lazar M.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 439-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, in our studies on TR binding to TREs in vivo during metamorphosis by ChIP, we often observed variable amounts of TR binding to TRE of the TH-inducible TH/bZIP promoter, depending on the presence of ligand (15Buchholz D.R. Hsia S.-C.V. Fu L. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6750-6758Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 25Tomita A. Buchholz D.R. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3337-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To investigate the TH-dependent phenomenon, we treated premetamorphic tadpoles with or without 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine (T3), a potent form of TH, and analyzed TR binding to two TH-inducible promoters, TRβ and TH/bZIP, in the intestine and tail with anti-TR(PB) antibody (Fig. 1). TR binding remained constant at the TRβ promoter in the presence or absence of T3 in both the intestine and tail (Fig. 1, top panels), and this constitutive binding was found at the TH/bZIP promoter in the intestine as well (Fig. 1, lower panels). However, an increase in TR binding was detected in the presence of T3 in the tail (Fig. 1, lower panels). To quantitate any potential differences in TR binding, we carried out qPCR. We increased the scope of the analysis by examining multiple time points of T3-induced metamorphosis and at different stages during natural metamorphosis. For these qPCR experiments, we included a control antibody, anti-ID14, and a primer/probe set for a control DNA region, the TRβ exon 5. The control DNA region, exon 5 of the TRβ gene, does not contain a TRE and is at least 20 kb away from the promoter where the TRE is located (33Shi Y.-B. Yaoita Y. Brown D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 733-788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This controls for sufficient sonication of the chromatin in the assay. Thus, the very low amounts of precipitated exon 5 DNA, expressed as % input, for both antibodies, anti-TR(PB) and anti-ID14, indicate that the chromatin was sonicated sufficiently to avoid chromatin fragments containing both the TRE and exon 5. We suggest that this level of % input at exon 5 represents the background for the assay. We also found background levels of % input at the TH/bZIP and TRβ TREs with the anti-ID14 antibody, indicating the washing steps after immunoprecipitation effectively removed nonspecific interactions. Consistent with the above analysis, TR binding to the TH/bZIP TRE was dramatically and statistically significantly increased in the presence T3 in both the tail (F3,10 = 7.9, p < 0.005 (This F-statistic has 3 and 10 degrees of freedom reflecting treatment levels and sample sizes.)) and intestine (F3,10 = 9.1, p < 0.003), where the maximal levels of increase after T3 treatment were about 10- and 7-fold, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). Scheffe's post hoc tests revealed no differences in the immunoprecipitated TRE region as % input among T3-treated samples. These same ChIP DNA samples were used to quantitate TRβ TRE immunoprecipitation, where less dramatic increases were observed, i.e. the immunoprecipitated TRE region as % input changed less than 2-fold in the tail and 2–4-fold in the intestine (Fig. 2, A and B) (TABLE ONE). This smaller change at the TRβ TRE was not detectable using conventional PCR analysis, and indeed, because of the differences in values when using chromatin isolated from multiple animals with different days of T3 treatment, the changes caused by T3 treatment in the tail were not statistically significant (F3,10 = 3.3, p < 0.068), although the increase in the intestine was significant (F3,10 = 16.3, p < 0.0004).TABLE ONEIncreases in TR binding to TRβ and TH/bZIP TREs in the tail and intestine during T3-induced and natural metamorphosis Values represent the maximum fold increase in immunoprecipitated TRE as % input between tadpoles treated with or without T3 and between premetamorphic (stage 54) and metamorphic tadpoles. Antibodies used were anti-TR(PB) (for both TRα and TRβ) and anti-TR (for TRβ). Calculations used the data for Fig. 2 and Fig. 7.T3-induced metamorphosisNatural metamorphosisTRβ TRETH/bZIP TRETRβ TRETH/bZIP TREPBβ-specificPBβ-specificPBβ-specificPBβ-specificTail<2×3×10×10×<2×5×8×20×Intestine3×3×7×10×<2×2×5×10× Open table in a new tab The results of TR binding during natural metamorphosis are by and large similar to TR binding results from T3-induced metamorphosis (Fig. 2, C and D). We examined stages from beginning (stage 54) to climax of metamorphosis (stage 62), when maximal levels of T3 are detectable (34Leloup J. Buscaglia M. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1977; 284: 2261-2263Google Scholar) and two stages in-between (stage 58 and 60). Stage 58 is forelimb emergence and onset of intestinal remodeling; stage 60 is when the highest number of apoptotic epithelial cells is observed in the remodeling intestine (28Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis (Daudin). 1994; Google Scholar, 35Shi Y.-B. Ishizuya-Oka A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 65: 53-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the TH/bZIP TRE, there was a gradual and significant increase in TR binding across development (F3,22 = 10.3, p < 0.0002 for tail and F3,14 = 112.5, p < 0.003 for intestine), up to 8-fold in the tail and 5-fold in the intestine (Fig. 2, C and D) (TABLE ONE). These increases became significant by stage 60 in both organs based on Scheffe's post hoc tests. At the TRβ TRE, no significant differences in TR binding across development were observed in the tail (F3,22 = 1.5, p < 0.23) or the intestine (post hoc tests showed no pairwise significant difference, although TR binding differences were significant overall, F3,14 = 4.1, p < 0.028). TRα and TRβ Have a Higher Affinity for TRβ TRE Compared with the TH/bZIP TRE—A generality based on the above data is that the level of TR binding to the TH/bZIP TRE in tails and intestines of untreated, premetamorphic tadpoles was at or marginally above background levels, based on signal from exon 5 and control antibody. In addition, the TR binding at the TRβ TRE in premetamorphosis was much higher above background compared with the TH/bZIP TRE, especially in the tail. In the presence of T3, an increase in TR binding was greater at the TH/bZIP TRE than at the TRβ TRE. These differences between TRβ and TH/bZIP TREs motivated experiments to determine the underlying basis for the differences between promoters. By using gel mobility shift assays, we tested several possibilities that may explain the differences as follows. 1) The T3-induced conformational change in TR per se may increase its affinity for the TH/bZIP promoter. 2) TRα, which is the predominant TR before T3 treatment, may have a lower affinity than TRβ for the TH/bZIP TRE. 3) TRs may have different affinities for TRβ versus TH/bZIP TREs. For the gel mobility shift assays, we isolated frog oocyte cytoplasm containing TRα,TRβ, or RXR after injection of corresponding mRNAs. We adjusted mRNA concentration for production of the oocyte cytoplasm based on [35S]methionine incorporation into the TRs after a pilot mRNA injection so that the isolated cytoplasms had equal amounts of the two TRs (data not shown), and we confirmed this result by Western blot using the same antibody as in the above ChIP experiments, anti-TR(PB), that recognizes both TRα and TRβ (Fig. 3A). Next, we showed this cytoplasm was competent in the gel mobility shift assays, where a shift was seen when TR, either α or β, and RXR were coincubated in the binding reaction and not when only one receptor or no receptors were included (Fig. 3B). To address the simple possibility that there is some difference in the ability to bind the TH/bZIP TRE versus TRβ TRE in the presence or absence of T3, we carried out a gel mobility shift assay that included T3 (Fig. 3C). The results showed equal binding by both TRs to both TREs in the presence or absence of T3. The slight difference in migration in the presence of T3 is likely due to a conformational change in the TRs induced by T3, causing different migration on the nondenaturing gels (36Yen P.M. Sugawara A. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23248-23252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The other potential explanations for the low binding in TH/bZIP in the absence of T3 may relate to binding affinity differences between the two TR isoforms or between TREs. First, we performed a TRE competition experiment where TR binding to radiolabeled TREs was competed with unlabeled TREs (Fig. 4). By using radiolabeled TRβ TRE, we incubated mixtures of TRα and RXR or TRβ and RXR with increasing amounts of cold TRβ TRE or TH/bZIP TRE (Fig. 4A). For both TRα and TRβ, cold TRβ TRE was a better competitor than cold TH/bZIP TRE for TR binding as shown by the greater reduction of bound radiolabeled TRβ TRE in the presence of cold TRβ TRE (Fig."

E2F6 associates with polycomb group (Pc-G) multiprotein complexes that contain histone H3 methyltransferases, suggesting that E2F6 represses genes by covalent histone modification. However, genes that are repressed by E2F6 via a mechanism that involves histone H3 methylation have not been identified. Using cDNA microarray experiments comparing wild-type and E2f6-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we now found that E2F6 is required to silence the meiosis-specific genes SMC1β and STAG3 in somatic cells. Re-expression of E2F6 in E2f6-/- cells was sufficient to restore their repression. E2F6 binds in vivo to the promoters of these genes through a conserved binding site.

E2F proteins are transcription factors that regulate genes with key roles in cell cycle progression, synthesis of nucleotides, DNA replication, DNA repair, and apoptosis (for a review, see Ref. 1Dimova D.K. Dyson N.J. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2810-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). E2F is a family of eight proteins (E2F1 through E2F8) that can be divided into three major subgroups. E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3a are potent transcriptional activators. Their major role is to activate genes that are involved in proliferation and apoptosis. In contrast, E2F3b, E2F4, and E2F5 function primarily as active transcriptional repressors through binding to the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein and related pocket proteins. E2F6, E2F7, and E2F8 lack transactivation domains and are pocket protein-independent repressors (2Cartwright P. Muller H. Wagener C. Holm K. Helin K.

A mechanism for transcriptional repression by E2F6 was suggested by the observation that E2F6 associates with polycomb proteins and histone methyltransferases (11Attwooll C. Oddi S. Cartwright P.

A contribution of E2F6 to the biological function of polycomb proteins in vivo is supported by the phenotype of mice with a targeted deletion of E2f6, which present with homeotic transformations of the axial skeleton that are very similar to those identified in polycomb-deficient mice (14Storre J. Elsasser H.P. Fuchs M. Ullmann D. Livingston D.M. Gaubatz S. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, evidence that E2F6 represses genes in vivo through covalent histone modification is still missing. Indeed, in a recent study it was found that E2F6 represses a set of genes, including the BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene, by competing for activating E2Fs (15Oberley M.J. Inman D.R. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42466-42476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). No evidence for a role of histone H3 methylation in repression of these genes was found on these promoters. Here we report a novel function of E2F6 to stably repress certain meiotic genes in somatic cells through multiple mechanisms including methylation of histone H3 on lysine 9 and lysine 27.

Oligonucleotide sequences are available upon request. Competition experiments were performed with unlabeled, double-stranded oligonucleotides. Immunoblotting—Primary mouse tissues (testis and thymus) or MEFs (wild-type or E2f6-/-) were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (Sigma)). Equal amounts of protein (100 μg) were separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore) membranes. STAG3 was detected with polyclonal antiserum D-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog number sc-20341). We have previously generated mice with a targeted deletion of E2F6 and reported normal cell cycle progression of fibroblasts isolated from E2f6-/- embryos (14Storre J. Elsasser H.P. Fuchs M. Ullmann D. Livingston D.M. Gaubatz S. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that E2F6 is not required for the regulation of typical E2F-regulated cell cycle genes. To identify genes that depend on E2F6, we performed cDNA microarray experiments with mRNA from E2f6+/+ and E2f6-/- MEFs. A relatively small number of genes was up-regulated in E2f6-/- cells when compared with wild-type control cells (data not shown). Activation of genes in E2f6-/- cells is consistent with the proposed role for E2F6 in transcriptional repression. In this study we focused on two genes that were strongly up-regulated in E2F6-deficient cells and that encode for STAG3 and SMC1β, meiotic specific subunits of the cohesin complex (19Prieto I. Suja J.A. Pezzi N. Kremer L. Martinez A.C. Rufas J.S. Barbero J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 20Pezzi N. Prieto I. Kremer L. Jurado Perez Valero L.A.

Biol. 2001; 21: 6984-6998Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Both proteins are required for proper segregation of chromosomes during meiotic division. Expression of a third gene, XM_196054, was also increased in E2f6-/- cells. This cDNA encodes for a novel protein with an unknown function. To validate the array data we analyzed the expression of these genes in different MEF preparations by RT-PCR. STAG3, SMC1β, and XM_196054 were undetectable in wild-type fibroblasts and strongly elevated in E2f6-/- MEFs, confirming the microarray data (Fig. 1A). Re-introduction of E2F6 into E2f6-/- cells significantly reduced expression of all three genes (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the expression of these genes in E2f6-/- cells is directly caused by the lack of E2F6 and is not due to secondary changes. We used immunoblotting with a STAG3-specific polyclonal antiserum and with lysates from E2f6-/- MEFs to test whether STAG3 is also increased on the protein level (Fig. 1C). A band of the expected size for STAG3 of 135-kDa was detected in E2f6-/- cells, but not in wild-type cells. The band detected in E2f6-/- cells co-migrates with STAG3 in testis lysates. We concluded that STAG3 is also induced on the protein level in cells that lack E2F6 (Fig. 1C). To analyze the normal expression pattern of XM_196054, we prepared RNA from a panel of different organs from an adult mouse and performed RT-PCRs. XM_196054 expression was undetectable in most organs but was highly expressed in testis (Fig. 1E). Thus, it is possible that XM_196054 also has a function in meiosis. We conclude that the loss of E2F6 results in the abnormal expression of testis-specific genes in mitotic cells and that E2F6 is normally required to repress these genes in somatic cells. It was reported previously (15Oberley M.J. Inman D.R. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42466-42476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) that E2F6 represses a set of genes, including BRCA1 and HP1α, in human tumor cell lines. Surprisingly, expression levels of these genes were equal in E2f6-/- and wild-type MEFs (Fig. 1A). Overexpression of E2F6 in MEFs had no effect on the expression of these genes (Fig. 1B) either. Thus, in primary mouse fibroblasts, E2F6 does not appear to regulate the same set of target genes as in human tumor cell lines. In addition, our microarray experiments do not support a role for E2F6 in the regulation of cell cycle genes in MEFs, because we did not find any of the typical E2F-regulated cell cycle genes among the E2F6-regulated genes (data not shown). These findings are consistent with our previous report of normal cell cycle progression of E2f6-/- MEFs (14Storre J. Elsasser H.P. Fuchs M. Ullmann D. Livingston D.M. Gaubatz S. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Taken together, our data suggest that E2F6 is specifically required for tissue-specific silencing of a subset of meiotic genes in non-meiotic tissues. Surprisingly, expression of STAG3 and SMC1β in E2f6-/- cells does not cause any obvious problems for the proliferation of these cells, perhaps because these proteins are unable to function as cohesins in mitotic cells. To begin to analyze the mechanism of repression of meiotic genes by E2F6 we first performed reporter assays with the promoter of the SMC1β gene (Fig. 2A). A SMC1β promoter fragment of 941 nucleotides had higher activity in wild-type MEFs than the empty reporter plasmid. Thus, unlike the endogenous gene, the transiently expressed promoter is not completely silenced in wild-type cells. Nevertheless, the activity of the promoter was severalfold higher in E2f6-/- MEFs than in E2f6+/+ MEFs, indicating that it contains the elements required for negative regulation by E2F6. To identify the promoter region involved in repression by E2F6, we created a series of promoter deletion mutants and compared their activity in wild-type and E2f6-/- cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Promoter constructs that contained at least 129 nucleotides upstream of the start site had higher activity in E2f6-/- cells than in E2f6+/+ cells. Repression of these SMC1β promoter constructs by E2F6 was confirmed by inhibition of reporter gene expression by overexpressed E2F6 (Fig. 2C). A point mutant of E2F6 defective in DNA binding (E68) (6Gaubatz S. Wood J.G. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9190-9195Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) had no effect on reporter gene expression, demonstrating that repression of SMC1β by E2F6 depends on sequence-specific DNA-binding. The -26 promoter had equal activity in wild-type and E2f6-/- cells and was not repressed by the coexpression of E2F6. This finding suggests that an E2F6-responsive site is located between nucleotides -26 and -129 of the SMC1β promoter. Examination of this part of the promoter sequence showed that it contains a potential E2F binding site (see Fig. 2D). To test whether this E2F site is required for repression of the SMC1β promoter by E2F6, we mutated the E2F element and analyzed the activity of the mutated reporter construct in E2f6+/+ and E2f6-/- cells (Fig. 2E). The mutated reporter gene had equal activity in E2f6+/+ and E2f6-/- cells, demonstrating that the E2F site is required for repression by E2F6. Consistent with this notion, overexpression of E2F6 repressed the wild-type but not the mutated reporter construct (Fig. 2F). We conclude that the E2F site of the SMC1β promoter is required for transcriptional repression by E2F6. Interestingly, identical elements are present in the human SMC1β promoter and in the murine and human STAG3 promoters (Fig. 2D). In addition, sequences flanking the E2F site are also highly conserved in the human and murine promoters. In particular, in each case the E2F-core binding site is followed by a poly(T) stretch (Fig. 2D). Whether the XM_196054 gene contains a similar binding site remains to be shown. Its promoter could not be analyzed, because the structure of the gene is unknown and the promoter could not be identified in the nucleotide data base. Next, we wanted to test whether E2F6 binds directly to the predicted E2F-binding sites of the SMC1β and STAG3 promoters. To address this question we performed gel retardation experiments with in vitro translated E2F6 and DP2 and radiolabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the E2F sites of the SMC1β and STAG3 promoters. Binding of E2F6 to these elements was compared with binding to the E2F-site of the DHFR promoter, a bona fide E2F-binding sequence (22Wells J.M. Illenye S. Magae J. Wu C.L. Heintz N.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4483-4492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, binding of E2F6 to the SMC1β site was readily detected, whereas under the same conditions E2F6 did not significantly bind to the DHFR sequence (compare lane 1 and lane 7 in Fig. 3A). Preferential binding of E2F6 to the SMC1β sites was confirmed by competition with unlabeled oligonucleotides. The SMC1β, but not the DHFR oligonucleotide, efficiently competed for the binding of E2F6 to the E2F element (Fig. 3A, lanes 2–4). We concluded that E2F6 binds with higher affinity to the SMC1β promoter than to the classical E2F binding site in the DHFR promoter. In contrast, endogenous E2F proteins present in the reticulocyte lysate preferentially associated with the DHFR element (Fig. 3A, lane 7, indicated by an asterisk). Consistent with these data, in vitro translated E2F1/DP2 bound only weakly to the SMC1β E2F-site when compared with E2F-site of the DHFR promoter (Fig. 3B, compares lane 1 and 4). As described above, the STAG3 promoter contains an E2F site that is identical to the one in the SMC1β promoter (Fig. 2D), and in vitro translated E2F6 readily bound to the STAG3 element (Fig. 3C). Specific binding to the STAG3 E2F site was demonstrated by competition with unlabeled wild-type oligonucleotides (Fig. 3C, lanes 2 and 3), but not by oligonucleotides with an mutation in the E2F-binding site (lanes 4 and 5) or by DHFR oligonucleotides (lanes 6 and 7). Together, these observations show that the STAG3 and SMC1β promoters contain E2F sites that are highly specific for E2F6. To determine whether E2F6 associates with the STAG3 promoter in vivo, we used ChIP experiments. Chromatin prepared from wild-type and E2f6-/- MEFs was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody directed against mouse E2F6. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by PCR with primers specific for the STAG3 promoter. Binding of E2F6 to the STAG3 promoter could readily be detected in E2f6-/- MEFs that were infected with a recombinant retrovirus directing the expression of E2F6 (Fig. 4A, lane 2). Importantly, no signal was detected in control infected E2f6-/- cells (Fig. 4A, lane 1). In addition, no binding of E2F6 to a control region 4 kb downstream of the STAG3 promoter was evident. Endogenous E2F6 associated with the STAG3 promoter in wild-type MEFs (Fig. 4A, lane 3), although, as expected, its binding was weaker than the binding of the overexpressed protein. Specific association of E2F6 with the STAG3 promoter was confirmed by quantitative real time PCR with independent primer sets (Fig. 4, B and C). Although it was more difficult to PCR amplify the GC-rich SMC1β promoter, binding of E2F6 to this promoter could also be detected by ChIP (Fig. 4D). We concluded that E2F6 associates with the STAG3 and SMC1β promoters in vivo. These observations are consistent with the gel retardation experiments that demonstrated high affinity E2F6-binding sites in the STAG3 and SMC1β promoters. It has been shown that can E2F6 represses a set of target genes in human cancer cell lines by competing for activating E2Fs (15Oberley M.J. Inman D.R. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42466-42476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Consequently, RNA interference-mediated depletion of E2F6 results in the association of E2F1 with these E2F6-regulated promoters (15Oberley M.J. Inman D.R. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42466-42476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To begin to analyze whether meiotic genes are repressed by a similar mechanism, we next analyzed whether activating E2Fs associate with the STAG3 promoter in E2f6-/- cells. As a positive control, we analyzed the p107 promoter. Binding of E2F proteins to this promoter has previously been demonstrated (23Takahashi Y. Rayman J.B. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 804-816PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, we detected E2Fs at the p107 promoter, and, importantly, their binding was equal in wild-type and E2f6-/- cells. In contrast, E2F1 and E2F2 did not significantly bind to the STAG3 promoter in wild-type cells (Fig. 4E and data not shown). In addition, we did not observe any significant enrichment of these activating E2Fs on the STAG3 promoter in E2f6-/- cells. E2F3 associated with the STAG3 promoter in wild-type MEFs. However, binding of E2F3 was not increased in E2f6-/- cells. Because E2F4 and E2F6 regulate an overlapping set of certain cell cycle-regulated genes (24Giangrande P.H. Zhu W. Schlisio S. Sun X. Mori S. Gaubatz S. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2941-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we also analyzed whether E2F4 associates with the STAG3 promoter. We could not, however, detect E2F4 at the STAG3 promoter in wild-type or E2f6-/- cells (Fig. 4D). In conclusion, of the E2Fs analyzed only E2F6 and E2F3 are able to associate with the STAG3 promoter in vivo. Because binding of E2F3 to the STAG3 promoter was similar in E2f6-/- and wild-type cells, it is unlikely that E2F6 represses the STAG3 promoter solely by competing for E2F3. In light of these findings, we hypothesized that histone modifications contribute to transcriptional silencing of STAG3 and SMC1β by E2F6 in mitotic cells. E2F6 was previously found in different multiprotein complexes that contain histone methyltransferases with specificity for histone H3, lysine 9, and lysine 27 (H3-Lys9 and H3-Lys27, respectively) (12Ogawa H. Ishiguro K. Gaubatz S. Livingston D.M. Nakatani Y. Science. 2002; 296: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 13Trimarchi J.M. Fairchild B. Wen J. Lees J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1519-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 14Storre J. Elsasser H.P. Fuchs M. Ullmann D. Livingston D.M. Gaubatz S. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Methylation of histone H3-Lys9 and H3-Lys27 has been linked to gene repression (reviewed in Ref. 25Lachner M. O'Sullivan R.J. Jenuwein T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2117-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). ChIP assays with modification-specific antibodies showed that histone H3 is dimethylated and trimethylated at Lys9 and/or Lys27 on the STAG3 and SMC1β promoters in wild-type cells (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, ChIP assays with chromatin isolated from E2f6-/- MEFs indicate that both modifications depend on E2F6. (Fig. 5A). We concluded that E2F6 is required for methylation of H3-Lys9/H3-Lys27 at the STAG3 and SMC1β promoters. Because the antibodies we used in these initial ChIP experiments cannot discriminate between methylated Lys9 or Lys27 of histone H3, we next used a set of more specific antibodies developed in the Jenuwein laboratory that can distinguish between these modifications (18Peters A.H. Kubicek S. Mechtler K. O'Sullivan R.J. Derijck A.A. Perez-Burgos L. Kohlmaier A. Opravil S. Tachibana M. Shinkai Y. Martens J.H. Jenuwein T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1577-1589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). ChIP assays with these antibodies demonstrated that E2F6 is required for histone H3-Lys9 dimethylation and H3-Lys27 trimethylation on the STAG3 promoter (Fig. 5B). Importantly, loss of these modifications in E2f6-/- MEFs correlates with expression of STAG3 in these cells. In addition to histone methylation, histone deacetylation has also been implicated in transcriptional repression. To investigate whether this modification plays a role in E2F6-mediated repression of STAG3 and SMC1β, we used ChIP assays with antibodies directed against acetylated histone H3 and H4. As shown in Fig. 6A, histone H3 acetylation on the STAG3 and SMC1β promoters is significantly increased in E2f6-/- cells. Equal histone H3 acetylation was found 4 kb downstream of the STAG3 promoter. Increased histone H3 acetylation correlates with increased expression of STAG3 and SMC1β in E2f6-/- cells. In contrast, acetylation of histone H4 was relatively unchanged in E2f6-/- cells. To obtain additional evidence that histone deacetylation is involved in E2F6-mediated repression, we treated wild-type MEFs with trichostatin A (TSA), a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylases, and then analyzed expression of STAG3 and SMC1β by RT-PCR (Fig. 6B). Treatment of MEFs with TSA was sufficient to activate STAG3 in these cells. In contrast, TSA treatment had no significant effect on SMC1β expression. We concluded that inhibition of histone deacetylation is sufficient to reactivate STAG3 expression, but not for the expression of SMC1β. Transcriptional silencing by histone deacetylation has recently been linked to DNA methylation (26Wade P.A. Gegonne A. Jones P.L. Ballestar E. Aubry F. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent study identified DNA methylation as a mechanism for the silencing of α-tubulin 3 by E2F6 (27Pohlers M. Truss M. Frede U. Scholz A. Strehle M. Kuban R.J. Hoffmann B. Morkel M. Birchmeier C. Hagemeier C. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1051-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this regard, the STAG3 and SMC1β promoters both contain CpG islands that may be subjected to methylation in vivo (not shown). Therefore, we next explored the possibility that cytosine methylation plays a role in the repression of SMC1β and STAG3 by E2F6. To test this possibility, cells were treated with the DNA demethylating agent 5′-aza-deoxycytidine (DAC), either alone or in combination with TSA. DAC alone had little effect on the expression of STAG3 and SMC1β. In contrast, sequential treatment with DAC and TSA resulted in reactivation of SMC1β. The combined use of DAC and TSA also resulted in a slightly stronger activation of STAG3 compared with the treatment with TSA alone. Together, these results confirm that histone deacetylation is involved in the repression of STAG3 and SMC1β in somatic cells. In addition, our data illustrate that DNA-methylation is required to maintain repression of SMC1β. However because TSA treatment alone was sufficient to activate STAG3, DNA methylation may not play a major role in the transcriptional silencing of this gene in non-meiotic cells. In this study we describe a novel function for E2F6 in the transcriptional repression of tissue-specific genes. We demonstrate that E2F6 is required to repress the genes encoding for the meiotic cohesins STAG3 and SMC1β and for a third meiotic protein with unknown function. These genes normally show a highly restricted, testis-specific, expression pattern. In the absence of E2F6, however, they are de-repressed in non-meiotic cells. Thus, silencing of these genes in somatic cells is critically dependent on E2F6. This finding is consistent with a recent study be Pohlers et al. (27Pohlers M. Truss M. Frede U. Scholz A. Strehle M. Kuban R.J. Hoffmann B. Morkel M. Birchmeier C. Hagemeier C. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1051-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), who identified a role for E2F6 in the repression of testis-specific α-tubulin 3 and α-tubulin 7 genes. We could not identify these α-tubulin genes in our study because they were not represented on our cDNA microarray. We identified multiple histone modifications that correlate with the inactive state of the STAG3 and SMC1β promoters in E2f6+/+ cells. These modifications include histone H3-Lys9/H3-Lys27 methylation (Fig. 5) and histone H3 deacetylation (Fig. 6). In addition, our data suggest that DNA methylation is involved in the silencing of SMC1β, similar to what was described before for the E2F6-regulated α-tubulin 3 gene (27Pohlers M. Truss M. Frede U. Scholz A. Strehle M. Kuban R.J. Hoffmann B. Morkel M. Birchmeier C. Hagemeier C. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1051-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Significantly, however, our data also suggest that DNA-methylation may not be a general mechanism for the silencing of E2F6 regulated genes. First, whereas the DNA demethylating agent DAC was sufficient to activate SMC1β, it did not reactivate STAG3 in somatic cells. Thus, cytosine methylation may only play a minor role in repression of STAG3 (Fig. 6B). Second, we found that E2F6 associates with the silenced STAG3 and SMC1β promoters in wild-type cells (Fig. 4). This finding implies that the silenced STAG3 and SMC1β promoters are accessible and does not support a model in which E2F6-mediated DNA methylation prevents the binding of transcription factors. Consistent with this notion, activating E2Fs were not enriched on the STAG3 promoter in E2f6-/- cells. Thus, although DNA methylation seems to be involved in silencing of a subset of E2F6-regulated meiotic genes, our data do not support a general mechanism of an E2F6-directed DNA methylation that blocks access of activating E2F transcription factors. Instead, DNA methylation may be an indirect consequence of long-term silencing of a subset of E2F6-regulated meiotic promoters. In light of these observations, we propose that E2F6 primarily acts as a sequence-specific DNA-binding subunit to recruit a complex with histone methyltransferase/deacetylase activity to the promoters of selected meiotic genes. E2F6 has been found previously in a complex with the histone methyltransferases G9a and Eu-HMTase1 (12Ogawa H. Ishiguro K. Gaubatz S. Livingston D.M. Nakatani Y. Science. 2002; 296: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Although we failed to detect G9a and HMTase1 in ChIP assays at the STAG3 and SMC1β promoters (data not shown), it is possible that these methyltransferases act at an earlier time point during embryonic development and that they are not necessary to maintain repression of the STAG3 and SMC1β genes in fibroblasts. EZH2, the catalytic subunit of the PRC2 polycomb complex, is another histone methyltransferase that has been found in association with E2F6 (Ref. 11Attwooll C. Oddi S. Cartwright P. Prosperini E. Agger K. Steensgaard P. Wagener C. Sardet C. Moroni M.C. Helin K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1199-1208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). 3J. Storre and S. Gaubatz, unpublished observation. Because this enzyme is specific for histone H3-Lys27, it could be responsible for E2F6-dependent H3-Lys27 trimethylation of the STAG3 and SMC1β promoters. Because of the lack of functional ChIP antibodies for EZH2, we were not able to analyze the recruitment of this protein to E2F6-regulated promoters. We speculate that silencing of the STAG3 and SMC1β promoters is maintained by proteins that recognize the methylated histone H3-Lys9 and H3-Lys27 residues. Candidates include the chromodomain proteins HP1 and M33/Cbx2. Further work will be necessary to identify the proteins that maintain stable repression of E2F6-regulated genes. Interestingly, recent results from Drosophila demonstrate cell cycle-dependent regulation of some dE2F-regulated genes and, for other target genes, stable repression that is completely resistant to cell cycle progression (28Dimova D.K. Stevaux O. Frolov M.V. Dyson N.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2308-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, repression of both types of genes is mediated by retinoblastoma-related proteins. It is possible that in the mammalian system E2F6 has evolved to silence tissue-specific genes independently from pocket proteins and to completely separate their regulation from the cell cycle-dependent repression and activation of the typical E2F-regulated genes.

We developed an assay system to identify molecules regulating the RANKL shedding. Using this system, we found that a splice variant of Ca2+-promoted Ras inactivator (CAPRI), ΔCAPRI, which is expressed in primary osteoblasts, promoted the RANKL shedding. The wild type CAPRI is a member of the Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) family and suppresses Ca2+-dependent Ras activation, whereas ΔCAPRI, which lacks one exon in the GAP-related domain, activated the Ras pathway. Overexpression of ΔCAPRI or a constitutive active form of Ras up-regulated the expression level of matrix-metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14), which directly cleaves the ectodomain of RANKL, whereas Erk activation by expressing the constitutive active Mek1 did not affect the MMP14 expression or RANKL shedding. These results suggest that ΔCAPRI is a possible regulator of RANKL shedding by modulating MMP14 expression through Ras signaling cascades other than the Erk pathway.

Some transmembrane proteins are extracellularly cleaved and released into the surrounding environment. RANKL is also made as a membrane-bound protein, cleaved by some proteinases, and converted to the soluble RANKL (11Lum L. Wong B.R. Josien R. Becherer J.D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Schlondorff J.

This process, known as ectodomain shedding, has a diverse effect on a wide variety of membrane-bound proteins. For example, when TNF-α is cleaved by the TNF-α converting enzyme and released into the circulatory system, it exhibits strong systemic effects (13Kriegler M. Perez C. DeFay K. Albert I. Lu S.D.

In contrast, the Fas ligand is a strong apoptosis inducer in its membrane-bound form, but the soluble Fas ligand has fewer effects on apoptosis induction (15Schneider P. Holler N. Bodmer J.L. Hahne M. Frei K. Fontana A. Tschopp J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1205-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Although some proteinases have been demonstrated to have the RANKL shedding activity, no definite RANKL sheddase(s) have yet been identified. TNF-α converting enzyme was reported to be a candidate of RANKL sheddase (11Lum L. Wong B.R. Josien R. Becherer J.D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Schlondorff J. Tempst P. Choi Y. Blobel C.P. J. Biol.

Lum L. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14665-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain family (ADAM)19 has also been reported to exhibit RANKL shedding activity (17Chesneau V. Becherer J.D. Zheng Y. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22331-22340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), but embryonic fibroblasts from ADAM19 knock-out mice showed almost the same RANKL shedding activity as the cells from the wild type animals (16Schlondorff J. Lum L. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14665-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14, also called the membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase, MT1-MMP) can also cleave RANKL, although its cleavage site differs from that previously reported (16Schlondorff J. Lum L. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14665-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These results suggest that there are other molecules implicated in RANKL shedding. To identify molecules involved in the regulation of RANKL shedding, we developed a novel screening system, in which expression plasmids encoding secreted placental alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) fused with mouse C-terminally truncated RANKL (tRANKL-SEAP) were co-transfected with cDNA library pools of ST2 cells. Utilizing this screening system, we found that an alternatively spliced variant of Ca2+-promoted Ras inactivator (CAPRI), ΔCAPRI led to an increase in the RANKL shedding. Reagents—p-Nitrophenyl phosphate was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. DNA polymerase, Pyrobest (for subcloning), was purchased from Takara biochemicals (Shiga, Japan), KOD plus (for reverse transcription-PCR) was from Toyobo (Osaka, Japan), and ionomycin was from Merck. Antibodies were purchased as follows: for the His tag, Erk, phosphorylated Erk, integrin-β and HSP-90 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), for the V5 tag from Invitrogen, for actin from Sigma-Aldrich, and for RANKL from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA). Division of ST2 cDNA Library and Plasmid Purification—Procedures for the construction of the ST2 cDNA library were previously described (3Yasuda H. Shima N. Nakagawa N. Yamaguchi K. Kinosaki M. Mochizuki S. Tomoyasu A. Yano K. Goto M. Murakami A. Tsuda E. Morinaga T. Higashio K. Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Suda T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3597-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (3544) Google Scholar). Competent high DH5α (Toyobo) Escherichia coli cells were transformed by heat shock with DNA solution of the ST2 cDNA library, and the library was divided into 1000 subpools, each of which contained ∼100 clones. After the first screening was completed, every positive pool was divided into 48 subpools each of which contained ∼10 clones and was subjected to a second screening, and the resulting positive pools were divided into 48 single clones. The plasmids were purified from E. coli using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Constructs—The expression vectors for the mutants of Ras, pcDNA3-RasV12 (a constitutively active mutant) and pcDNA3-RasN17 (a dominant negative mutant), were generous gifts from Dr. C. Kitanaka (Yamagata University). An expression vector for a constitutively active form of Mek1, pcDNA3.1(+)-MekCA, was constructed by insertion of the cDNA fragments digested from pGEM-MekCA (generous gift from K. Arai, Research Institute, National Rehabilitation Center for Persons with Disabilities) to NotI restriction site of pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). The tRANKL-SEAP expression vector was constructed as follows. The cDNA encoding for SEAP was subcloned from pSEAP2-Control (Clontech) by PCR using a set of primers, 5′-CGCTCGAGAATCATCCCAGTTGAGGAGGAGAACC-3′ and 5′-GCGTCTAGAGTAACCCGGGTGCGCGG-3′, and the cDNA fragment of the cytoplasmic region, transmembrane domain, and stalk region of the mouse RANKL (corresponding to amino acids 4-157) were subcloned from ST2 cDNA library by PCR using a set of the following primers: 5′-AAGCTTGCCACCATGGCCAGCCGAGACTACGGCAA-3′ and 5′-GCGGCCGCCGCCTCGCTGGGCCACATCCA-3′. The PCR fragments were ligated into pCR-blunt II TOPO (Invitrogen) using protocols recommended by the manufacturer. The SEAP fragment and the RANKL fragment were digested from TOPO vectors with XhoI/XbaI and HindIII/NotI, respectively, and inserted into the corresponding restriction sites of pcDNA3.1-V5HisA (Invitrogen). The full-length RANKL was cloned from the cDNA of primary osteoblasts by PCR and inserted into the HindIII/NotI sites of pcDNA3.1-V5HisB (Invitrogen). The wild type CAPRI was cloned from the cDNA of primary osteoblasts, and ΔCAPRI was subcloned from pcDL-ΔCAPRI by PCR (for pcDL-SRα vector, see Ref. 18Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and inserted into the EcoRI/NotI sites of pEF1-HisC (Invitrogen) and the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1-V5HisA (Invitrogen). The cDNA for full-length MMP14 was digested from pcDL-MMP14 at SalI sites and inserted into XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1(+). The cDNA for MMP13 was cloned from the cDNA of primary osteoblasts by PCR, and inserted into the HindIII/XbaI sites of pcDNA3.1-V5HisA. Small interfering RNA plasmids for MMP14 were constructed using piGENE U6 vector (iGENE Therapeutics Inc., Ibaraki, Japan) according to manufacturer's protocol. The target sites were 5′-GGGCTGAGATCAAGGCCAATG-3′ and 5′-GCGGGTGAGGAATAACCAAGT-3′. Cell Culture and Transfection—The human kidney cell line 293T, human osteosarcoma cell line SaOS2, and mouse fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 were cultured with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (Sigma) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The plasmids were transfected into the cells using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alkaline Phosphatase Assay of Culture Medium—293T cells were seeded in 96-well cell culture plates at a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml. 24 h later, 625 pg of pcDNA3.1-tRANKL-SEAP and 49.375 ng of a subpool of the ST2 cDNA library or other constructs were co-transfected to 293T using FuGENE 6. 72 h after the transfection, 50 μl of the culture medium was collected from each well and subjected to an alkaline phosphatase assay. In brief, the culture medium was incubated with 125 μl of dH2O, 100 mm NaHCO3, 100 mm Na2CO3, 1 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate at 65 °C for 90 min, and then the absorbance of the solution at a wavelength of 405 nm was measured using the MTP-300 microplate reader (CORONA Electric, Ibaraki, Japan). DNA Sequencing of Positive Clones—DNA sequences of the positive clones were determined by the cycle sequencing method. In brief, samples were prepared using the BigDye terminator Ver 1.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and DyeEx 2.0 spin kit (Qiagen) and then analyzed using the ABI PRISM® 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Reverse Transcription-PCR—The procedures for preparation of the primary osteoblasts from the calvaria of newborn C57/BL6 mice and for formation of osteoclasts were previously described (19Suda T. Jimi E. Nakamura I. Takahashi N. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 282: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 20Yamamoto A. Miyazaki T. Kadono Y. Takayanagi H. Miura T. Nishina H. Katada T. Wakabayashi K. Oda H. Nakamura K. Tanaka S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The total RNA was purified from primary osteoblasts and osteoclasts using ISO-GEN (Nippon Gene Co. Ltd., Toyama, Japan) according to the method recommended by the manufacturer. The cDNA was synthesized from purified RNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The primers used for the PCR analysis of ΔCAPRI were 5′-GGCTGGCCAAGGACTTTCTG-3′ and 5′-CTATGTTCTGGACCGCCTGG-3′. Western Blotting—The procedure for Western blotting was described previously (20Yamamoto A. Miyazaki T. Kadono Y. Takayanagi H. Miura T. Nishina H. Katada T. Wakabayashi K. Oda H. Nakamura K. Tanaka S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To detect the soluble RANKL released into the supernatants, 3 ml of the culture medium were incubated with 6 μl of recombinant protein G-agarose (Invitrogen) and 1 μg of recombinant osteoprotegerin-Fc chimeric protein (R&D Biosystems) for 16 h at 4 °C, then recovered by brief centrifugation. The pellets were suspended in TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Membrane fraction was gained using Mem-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce Chemical Co.). Immunocytochemistry—NIH3T3 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-ΔCAPRI-V5HisA or -wtCAPRI and, 24 h later, were unstimulated or stimulated with 5 μg/ml ionomycin for 2 min. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X, and immunostained with anti-V5 antibody and Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular probes, Eugene, OR). Real Time PCR—The reaction mixture for the real time PCR was prepared using qPCR QuickGoldStar Mastermix Plus for SYBR® Green I (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) and was analyzed using the Mx3000P™ QPCR System (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The set of primers used were 5′-GCTCACCCCAGTCACTCTCA-3′ and 5′-CTCATGGCCTTCATGGTGTC-3′ for MMP14 and 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTCA-3′ and 5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′ for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Statistical Analysis—A statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test for alkaline phosphatase assay and the unpaired Student's t test for real time PCR. Development of a Screening System for Molecules with RANKL Shedding Activity—To identify molecules potentially involved in the regulation of RANKL shedding, we developed a new library screening system. We constructed an expression vector encoding the fusion protein of SEAP with the C-terminally truncated form of RANKL, which contains the stalk region, transmembrane domain, and intracellular domain of RANKL (tRANKL-SEAP) (Fig. 1A). Clear up-regulation of the alkaline phosphatase activity was detected in the culture medium when this plasmid was co-transfected with the MMP14 expression vector into 293T cells (data not shown), indicating that this assay system is suitable for screening molecules with the RANKL shedding activity. Using this assay system, we screened the cDNA library of the mouse bone marrow-derived stromal cell line, ST2 cells for molecules with RANKL shedding activity. From 1 × 106 clones, 12 positive clones were isolated. Nucleotide sequences of these cDNA fragments revealed that one of the positive clones encoded a full-length cDNA for a novel splice variant of CAPRI, which lacks one exon (138 bp) in the RasGAP domain of the wild type CAPRI (ΔCAPRI) (Fig. 1, B and C). The other clones included full-length MMP14 (Fig. 1B), which was already reported to increase the RANKL shedding (16Schlondorff J. Lum L. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14665-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that ΔCAPRI is expressed in mouse primary osteoblasts and osteoclasts (Fig. 1D). ΔCAPRI Expression Increases RANKL Shedding—We next examined the effect of ΔCAPRI and wtCAPRI on the RANKL shedding. Either the ΔCAPRI or the wtCAPRI expression plasmid was transfected to the 293T cells with the tRANKL-SEAP construct, and the alkaline phosphatase activity in culture media was measured using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate. The 293T cells co-transfected with the tRANKL-SEAP expression plasmid and empty vector exhibited a very low level of alkaline phosphatase activity in the supernatant. Similarly, a low alkaline phosphatase activity was detected in the conditioned medium of the cells expressing wtCAPRI. In contrast, the co-expression of ΔCAPRI significantly increased the amount of tRANKL-SEAP released into the supernatant, suggesting that the ΔCAPRI expression induces the cleavage of membrane-anchored RANKL in transfected 293T cells (Fig. 2A). In addition, the co-transfection of ΔCAPRI and the full-length RANKL expression plasmids markedly promoted the release of RANKL as detected by Western blotting with the anti-RANKL antibody (Fig. 2B). We next examined the effect of ΔCAPRI on the RANKL shedding in osteoblastic cells. Overexpression of ΔCAPRI also promoted the RANKL shedding in the osteoblastic cell line SaOS2 cells (Fig. 2C). ΔCAPRI Activates Ras Signaling Pathways—Lockyer et al. (21Lockyer P.J. Kupzig S. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 15: 981-986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (93) Google Scholar) reported that the elevation of the intracellular Ca2+ causes a rapid C2 domain-dependent translocation of wtCAPRI to the plasma membrane, resulting in the activation of the RasGAP activity and the inactivation of the Ras/Mek/Erk pathways. Therefore, we investigated the translocation of wt and ΔCAPRI after the Ca2+ influx by the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin treatment and found that both the wt and ΔCAPRI moved to the plasma membrane of NIH3T3 and 293T cells 2 min after the ionomycin stimulation as shown in Fig. 3A by immunocytochemistry and Fig. 3B by cell fractionation analysis. To investigate whether ΔCAPRI modulates the Ras/Erk signaling pathway, we examined the Erk activity in the ΔCAPRI- or wtCAPRI-overexpressing 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 3C, the overexpression of ΔCAPRI enhanced the ionomycin-induced Erk phosphorylation, whereas the wtCAPRI expression reduced the Erk activation, indicating that ΔCAPRI works in a dominant negative fashion. In fact, wtCAPRI suppressed RANKL shedding promoted by ΔCAPRI (Fig. 3D). Ras Activation, but Not Mek/Erk Pathway, Is Involved in RANKL Shedding—Because CAPRI is a Ca2+-sensitive RasGAP, we next tested whether the Ras activity is involved in the RANKL shedding. As shown in Fig. 3E, the expression of the constitutively active Ras strongly promoted the RANKL shedding in the 293T cells. RANKL shedding induced by the ΔCAPRI overexpression was significantly suppressed by the co-expression of a dominant negative mutant of Ras (RasN17). These results indicate that the Ras activity plays an important role in the regulation of the RANKL shedding induced by ΔCAPRI. Interestingly, however, the up-regulation of Erk activity in the 293T cells with the constitutively active Mek1 expression (MekCA) did not increase the alkaline phosphatase activity released into the supernatant (Fig. 3E). Ras Activity Regulates the Expression Level of MMP14—ST2 cDNA library screening for the RANKL shedding confirmed that MMP14 could be a candidate for the RANKL sheddase, and in fact, the co-transfection of MMP14 expression vector with pcDNA3.1-tRANKL-SEAP significantly increased the amount of tRANKL-SEAP released into the supernatant (Fig. 1B). We next examined whether or not the Ras activation downstream of ΔCAPRI is involved in the expression level of MMP14. In the real time PCR analysis from mRNA of the 293T cells, ΔCAPRI up-regulated MMP14, which was significantly suppressed by the co-expression of RasDN. RasCA induced the up-regulation of MMP14, whereas MekCA did not affect the expression level of MMP14 (Fig. 4A). This result suggested that ΔCAPRI would promote the RANKL shedding through up-regulation of MMP14. To confirm this, we constructed siRNA vectors for MMP14. As shown in Fig. 4B, siMMP14-1 and -2 suppressed expression of endogenous MMP14 in SaOS2 cells (upper panel), and the RANKL shedding promoted by ΔCAPRI (lower panel). MMP14 Has Much Stronger RANKL Shedding Activity than MMP13—Inada et al. (22Inada M. Wang Y. Byrne M.H. Rahman M.U. Miyaura C. Lopez-Otin C. Krane S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17192-17197Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) recently reported that MMP13-deficient mice had skeletal abnormalities such as increased trabecular bone mass. To examine the relevance of this proteinase in RANKL shedding, we transfected the MMP13 expression vector and tRANKL-SEAP to 293T cells. Overexpression of MMP13 exhibited little effect on the up-regulation of the alkaline phosphatase activity in the supernatant, indicating that MMP13 had much weaker RANKL shedding activity compared with MMP14 (Fig. 5). Ectodomain shedding is a highly regulated process that affects a number of transmembrane proteins, and is considered to play an important role in regulating various pathophysiological events. The role of ectodomain shedding varies between substrate proteins. For example, shedding allows some local growth factors, such as TNF-α and epidermal growth factor, to be released from the local environments and participate in the paracrine and endocrine signalings (13Kriegler M. Perez C. DeFay K. Albert I. Lu S.D. Cell. 1988; 53: 45-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 14Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S. Nelson N. Boiani N. Schooley K.A. Gerhart M. Davis R. Fitzner J.N. Johnson R.S. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Cerretti D.P.

Interestingly, proteolytic processing via shedding is important even for the local effects of the growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (24Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). RANKL is a key molecule for the osteoclastogenesis and bone-resorbing activity of mature osteoclasts. RANKL is produced as a membrane-bound cytokine and released into the paracrine and the endocrine milieu via ectodomain shedding, although the biological significance of RANKL shedding is still unknown. The soluble form of RANKL induces in vitro osteoclastogenesis from bone marrow cells, and several studies have revealed an increase in the intraarticular level of soluble RANKL under pathological conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (25Kotake S. Udagawa N. Hakoda M. Mogi M. Yano K. Tsuda E. Takahashi K. Furuya T. Ishiyama S. Kim K.J. Saito S. Nishikawa T. Takahashi N. Togari A. Tomatsu T. Suda T. Kamatani N. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Recently, Mizuno et al. (26Mizuno A. Kanno T. Hoshi M. Shibata O. Yano K. Fujise N. Kinosaki M. Yamaguchi K. Tsuda E. Murakami A. Yasuda H. Higashio K. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 2002; 20: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) generated transgenic animals overexpressing soluble RANKL in the liver after birth that exhibited a marked decrease in bone mineral density with aging, indicating that the excessive production of soluble RANKL can promote in vivo osteoclastogenesis. On the other hand, it was reported that the membrane-bound RANKL is more potent in stimulating osteoclast differentiation than its soluble form (12Nakashima T. Kobayashi Y. Yamasaki S. Kawakami A. Eguchi K. Sasaki H. Sakai H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). To reveal the biological and pathological relevance of RANKL shedding, elucidating the molecular mechanism underlying RANKL shedding is indispensable. It is difficult to detect soluble RANKL in the culture medium by the usual Western blot analysis because the expression level of RANKL is relatively low. Nakashima et al. (12Nakashima T. Kobayashi Y. Yamasaki S. Kawakami A. Eguchi K. Sasaki H. Sakai H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) developed a ligand-receptor precipitation Western blot analysis using osteoprotegerin, which specifically binds to RANKL, but this system is not suitable for systematic screening of a large number of molecules. Blobel and coworkers (27Zheng Y. Schlondorff J. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42463-42470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) reported a simple and quantitative assay for TNF-α shedding using alkaline phosphatase-tagged TNF-α. This method allows the rapid and reproducible quantitation of the TNF-α shedding. We first constructed an expression vector that encodes a fusion protein of mouse full-length RANKL and SEAP (full RANKL-SEAP) and transfected it into 293T cells. Although we could find the expression of the full RANKL-SEAP by Western blotting, we failed to detect alkaline phosphatase activity in the supernatants even when the vector was co-transfected with a putative RANKL sheddase, MMP14, the reason of which remains unclear (data not shown). For several type II transmembrane proteins including TNF-α, the juxtamembrane sequence surrounding the cleavage site has been shown to be sufficient to target the protein for regulated shedding (16Schlondorff J. Lum L. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14665-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next constructed an expression vector encoding a fusion protein of SEAP with the C-terminally truncated RANKL, which contained the stalk region but lacked the TNF-like domain of RANKL (pcDNA3.1-tRANKL-SEAP), and transfected it together with the ST2 cell-derived cDNA library. Using this assay system, we could isolate 12 independent positive clones, which showed alkaline phosphatase activity in the supernatant when transfected with pcDNA3.1-tRANKL-SEAP. They could also increase the amount of soluble RANKL when transfected into the 293T cells with the full-length RANKL, confirming the relevance of this screening system. One of the positive clones was a spliced variant of CAPRI. The protease activity inducing ectodomain shedding of the transmembrane proteins has been reported to be modulated by protein kinase signaling such as the Ras/Mek/Erk pathway (28Fan H. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6962-6972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CAPRI was originally identified as a member of the RasGAP, negative regulators of Ras signaling pathways (21Lockyer P.J. Kupzig S. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 15: 981-986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 29Bivona T.G. Perez De Castro I. Ahearn I.M. Grana T.M. Chiu V.K. Lockyer P.J. Cullen P.J. Pellicer A. Cox A.D. Philips M.R. Nature. 2003; 424: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), and the R473S mutation decreased the RasGAP activity of CAPRI and enhanced ATP- or ionomycin-induced Erk phosphorylation (21Lockyer P.J. Kupzig S. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 15: 981-986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (93) Google Scholar). ΔCAPRI lacks the Arg-473-containing exon in the RasGAP domain in which the FLR motif stabilizes the catalytic arginine-finger loop (30Ahmadian M.R. Stege P. Scheffzek K. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 686-68931Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), suggesting that it can work in a dominant negative fashion like the R473S mutant, and in fact, the ΔCAPRI expression increased the ionomycin-induced Erk activation, and co-expression of wtCAPRI diminished the RANKL shedding promoted by ΔCAPRI. The expression of a dominant negative mutant of Ras (RasN17) suppressed the RANKL shedding induced by ΔCAPRI, and a constitutively active mutant of Ras (RasV12) expression stimulated the RANKL shedding, indicating that ΔCAPRI induces RANKL shedding via activating Ras pathways. The only protease we could isolate in this screening system was MMP14 (MT1-MMP), which was previously reported as a candidate of the RANKL sheddases (16Schlondorff J. Lum L. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14665-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It should be noticed that MMP14 knock out mice showed an increase in osteoclast number and developed severe osteopenia (31Holmbeck K. Bianco P. Caterina J. Yamada S. Kromer M. Kuznetsov S.A. Mankani M. Robey P.G. Poole A.R. Pidoux I. Ward J.M. Birkedal-Hansen H. Cell. 1999; 99: 81-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). This suggests that MMP14 negatively regulates the local osteoclastogenesis by reducing membrane-bound RANKL through ectodomain shedding, although it may increase the amount of soluble RANKL. The serum concentration of soluble RANKL in the physiological condition is reportedly less than 1 ng/ml, which is not high enough to induce general osteopenia (32Nakamura M. Udagawa N. Matsuura S. Mogi M. Nakamura H. Horiuchi H. Saito N. Hiraoka B.Y. Kobayashi Y. Takaoka K. Ozawa H. Miyazawa H. Takahashi N. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 5441-5449Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Our data do not exclude the possibility that other proteases than MMP14 are involved in this process. Recent studies have demonstrated the role of MMP13 in regulating bone integrity; however, RANKL shedding activity of MMP13 was much weaker than that of MMP14. The overexpression of ΔCAPRI or RasCA increased the expression of MMP14, and MMP14 knockdown suppressed RANKL shedding promoted by ΔCAPRI, indicating that the ΔCAPRI/Ras pathways stimulate the RANKL shedding by regulating the expression of MMP14. Interestingly, the constitutively active Mek expression failed to up-regulate the amount of the cleaved RANKL or MMP14 expression, although the Erk activity was strongly up-regulated (data not shown). These results suggest that the downstream cascades of Ras other than the Mek/Erk pathway are implicated in the RANKL shedding. A further investigation is required to clarify the signal transduction pathway(s) downstream of Ras that regulates the RANKL shedding. In conclusion, we established a novel library screening system for identifying the molecules involved in the RANKL shedding and identified a splice variant of CAPRI, ΔCAPRI, as a possible candidate. ΔCAPRI activates the Ras pathways, which increase the expression of MMP14 in a Mek/Erk-independent manner and lead to the RANKL shedding. These data suggest that the ΔCAPRI-Ras-MMP14 axis plays an important role in the RANKL shedding. We thank R.

Earlier work in cardiac myocytes expressing nonphosphorylatable slow skeletal troponin I provided evidence that protein kinase C-mediated cardiac troponin I phosphorylation accelerates relaxation. However, replacement with the slow skeletal isoform also alters the myofilament pH response and the Ca2+ transient, which could influence endothelin-mediated relaxation. Here, differences in the Ca2+ transient could not explain the divergent relaxation response to endothelin in myocytes expressing cardiac versus slow skeletal troponin I nor could activation of Na+/H+ exchange. Three separate clusters within cardiac troponin I are phosphorylated by protein kinase C, and we set out to determine the contribution of the Thr144 and Ser23/Ser24 clusters to the endothelin-mediated contractile response. Myocyte replacement with a cardiac troponin I containing a Thr144 substituted with the Pro residue found in slow skeletal troponin I resulted in prolonged relaxation in response to acute endothelin compared with control myocytes. Ser23/Ser24 also is a target for protein kinase C phosphorylation of purified cardiac troponin I, and although this cluster was not acutely phosphorylated in intact myocytes, significant phosphorylation developed within 1 h after adding endothelin. Replacement of Ser23/Ser24 with Ala indicated that this cluster contributes significantly to relaxation during more prolonged endothelin stimulation.

The contribution of each end target to the contractile response to PKC is not well understood. Our laboratory is interested in understanding the role of cTnI in the PKC-mediated contractile function response. Increased PKC expression is observed in failing human hearts (15Bodor G.S.

Earlier work demonstrated that cTnI phosphorylation is correlated with the positive inotropic response to ET (4Westfall M.V. Borton A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33694-33700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 8Damron D.S. Darvish A. Murphy L. Sweet W. Moravec C.S. Bond M. Circ.

Accelerated relaxation also is observed in response to PKC activation by ET in myocytes expressing cTnI (4Westfall M.V. Borton A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33694-33700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). PKC phosphorylation of purified cTnI decreases myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity in reconstituted myofilaments (11Noland T.A. Raynor R.L. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264 (Jr.): 20778-20785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this desensitization is expected to contribute to the accelerated relaxation. In contrast, peak shortening is diminished and relaxation is delayed rather than accelerated in response to ET when endogenous cTnI is replaced with nonphosphorylatable slow skeletal troponin I (ssTnI) in adult myocytes. These results are consistent with the idea that cTnI phosphorylation enhances peak myocyte shortening and accelerates relaxation rate in response to PKC activation by ET. However, ssTnI expression in adult myocytes also increases myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity and slows the Ca2+ transient (19Westfall M.V. Rust E.M. Metzger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 20Fentzke R.C. Buck S.H. Patel J.R. Lin H. Wolska B.M. Stojanovic M.O. Martin A.F. Solaro R.J. Moss R.L. Leiden J.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 517: 143-157Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Thus, the differential response to ET observed in myocytes expressing cTnI versus ssTnI may result from the direct actions of cTnI phosphorylation on shortening and relaxation or from alterations in the Ca2+ transient induced by ssTnI expression. One goal of the present study is to establish whether PKC-mediated cTnI phosphorylation acts directly to accelerate relaxation or is explained by parallel alterations in cellular Ca2+. Calcium and shortening responses are measured simultaneously during the ET response for these experiments. Stimulation frequency also alters the Ca2+ transient, with accelerated sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ uptake observed at higher pacing frequencies (21DeSantiago J. Maier L.S. Bers D.M. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2002; 34: 975-984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The relative contribution of phosphorylated cTnI to the ET-induced relaxation response may decrease as pacing frequency increases in the event that alterations in cellular Ca2+ are primarily responsible for this relaxation response. Thus, the contribution of cTnI phosphorylation to the ET-induced relaxation response is examined over a range of frequencies. A second goal of our study was to differentiate between cTnI phosphorylation-induced and alkalosis-induced changes in the ET-mediated contractile performance response. Previous investigators showed that ET increases Na+/H+ exchange via PKC (22Kramer B.K. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 23Goldberg A.T.

The ensuing alkalosis increases myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity (24Mayoux E. Coutry N. Lechene P. Marotte F. Hoffmann C. Ventura-Clapier R. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266 (-H2060): H2051PubMed Google Scholar), and ET-induced alkalosis has been shown to contribute to the enhanced peak shortening and increased rate of contraction (22Kramer B.K. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 23Goldberg A.T. Bond B.R. Mukherjee R. New R.B. Zellner J.L. Crawford F.A. Spinale F.G. Ann. Thorac.

Borton A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33694-33700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) also could result from the enhanced basal myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity and diminished pH sensitivity relative to cTnI-expressing myocytes (19Westfall M.V. Rust E.M. Metzger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the present study, the influence of ET-induced alkalosis on peak contraction was tested by inhibiting Na+/H+ exchange in myocytes expressing cTnI and ssTnI. The final aim of the present work was to determine the contribution of individual phosphorylation sites within cTnI to the PKC-mediated changes in intact adult myocyte relaxation rate in response to ET. Detailed work on purified cTnI indicates that PKC phosphorylates three separate clusters of residues, including Ser23/Ser24, Ser43/Ser45, and Thr144 within cTnI (11Noland T.A. Raynor R.L. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264 (Jr.): 20778-20785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Noland T.A. Guo X. Raynor R.L. Jideama N.M. Averyhart-Fullard V. Solaro R.J. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (Jr.): 25445-25454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, the myocardial response to phosphorylation of individual sites within the intact myocyte has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Studies here are focused on investigating the influence of the rat cTnI Ser23/Ser24 and Thr144 sites on contractile function in response to ET. For studies of cTnIThr144, the goal is to determine whether Thr144 influences the peak contraction and relaxation response to PKC activated by ET, by substitution with the nonphosphorylatable Pro residue. The Ser23/Ser24 cluster also is a target for PKC in purified cTnI and is a major myofilament target for protein kinase A (PKA) (26Robertson S.P. Johnson J.D. Holroyde M.J. Kranias E.G. Potter J.D. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 260-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of this cluster by PKA significantly decreases myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity (27Westfall M.V. Turner I.I. Albayya F. Metzger J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280 (-C332): C324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and accelerates relaxation during β-adrenergic activation (28Kentish J.C. McCloskey D.T. Layland J. Palmer S. Leiden J.M. Martin A.F. Solaro R.J. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). A similar increase in relaxation is expected if this Ser cluster is phosphorylated by PKC in intact adult myocytes. For these studies, the Ser23/Ser24 residues were substituted with Ala to investigate whether this cluster influences the ability of cTnI to maintain relaxation in response to ET activation of PKC. Mutagenesis Strategy—Wild-type rat cTnI cDNA (kind gift of A. Murphy) was used to construct the cTnIT144P and cTnIS23A/S24A mutants. Primers used for mutagenesis of cTnIT144P were 5′-gcaagtttaagcggccgcctctccgaagagtg-3′ (sense) and 5′-cactcttcggagaggcggccgcttaaacttgc-3′ (antisense), and for cTnIS23A/S24A the primers were 5′-ccgacgtcgcgccgcggccaactaccg-3′ (sense) and 5′-cggtagttggccgcggcgcgacgtcgg-3′ (antisense) using a pGEM-3Z vector and the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (29Westfall M.V. Borton A.R. Albayya F.P. Metzger J.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The presence of each mutant was verified by DNA sequencing. Generation of Adenoviral Vectors—Recombinant adenovirus vectors were constructed by cotransfection of pCA4cTnI cDNA with pJM17 by calcium phosphate into a HEK 293 cell line. Replication-deficient, recombinant adenovirus containing wild-type rat cTnI, wild-type ssTnI, or mutant ssTnI cDNAs, a cytomegalovirus promoter, and an SV40 polyadenylation signal were obtained following homologous recombination (19Westfall M.V.

Albayya F.P. Metzger J.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). After 1 h, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with pen/strep (2 ml) was added, with regular replacement of media over 4 days in culture. Analysis of Protein Expression—Control and virus-treated adult rat cardiac myocytes were scraped from coverslips into sample buffer 4 days after gene transfer (31Westfall M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 219: 159-166Google Scholar). In some experiments, myocytes were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 min to evaluate incorporation of TnI protein into the myofilament after gene transfer. In earlier work, expression in intact and permeabilized myocytes was comparable when myofilament proteins were incorporated into the myofilament (29Westfall M.V. Borton A.R. Albayya F.P. Metzger J.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 32Westfall M.V. Albayya F.P. Metzger J.M. J. Biol.

Proteins were then separated by gel electrophoresis and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for 2000 V-h with immunodetection carried out as described earlier (30Westfall M.V. Rust E.M. Albayya F. Metzger J.M. Methods Cell Biol. 1997; 52: 307-322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a 1:1000 dilution of MAB 1691 (Chemicon Inc., Temecula, CA), a monoclonal antibody that recognizes all TnI isoforms. A phospho-Ser23/Ser24-specific polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) and a paired horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody were used to detect Ser23/Ser24 phosphorylation. Myocytes collected for detection of phosphorylation were incubated at 37 °C with calyculin A (10 nm) alone or with the selected PKA and PKC agonist and/or inhibitor for time intervals ranging from 2.5 min up to 1 h. Measurement of Sarcomere Shortening in Single Cardiac Myocytes— Myocytes to be used for shortening assays were transferred to a Plexiglas stimulation chamber consisting of 8 wells containing platinum electrodes. Myocytes were stimulated electrically (2.5-ms pulse, 0.2 Hz) in medium 199 supplemented with pen/strep (M199), 10 mm HEPES, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm glutathione (M199+), and the media was replaced every 12 h for days 2-4 post-gene transfer (33Coutu P. Metzger J.M. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2565-2579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The voltage was set so that ∼20% of the myocytes were stimulated on each coverslip. Four days after gene transfer, individual coverslips were transferred to a temperature-controlled (37 °C) chamber mounted on a Nikon microscope stage. A video-based detection system (Ionoptix, Milton, MA) was used to detect sarcomere shortening in intact myocytes. For frequency-response studies, myocytes were stimulated at each frequency (0.2, 0.5, 0.75, 1, and 2 Hz) until a steady state contraction was reached. Sarcomere shortening also was recorded at 0.2 Hz before and after the increases in stimulation frequency to ensure there were no changes in the rate of contraction, peak contraction, and rate of relaxation after testing at all frequencies. Experiments were recorded using SarcLen software, and an average of 10 twitches/myocyte was collected under basal conditions. Signal-averaged data were analyzed to determine resting sarcomere length (SLR), percent change in peak sarcomere shortening above base line (Sb), time to peak shortening (TTP), time to 25, 50, and 75% relaxation (TTR25, TTR50, and TTR75, respectively), and maximum normalized shortening and relaxation velocities (+dl/dtmax, -dl/dtmax, respectively). Media containing ET (10 nm), 5-N(ethyl-N-iospropyl)amiloride (EIPA, 500 nm) or both reagents were perfused via separate individual perfusion tubing to eliminate introduction of residual agonists/inhibitors. Experiments for Ca2+ transient and sarcomere shortening measurements were carried out on myocytes loaded with Fura-2 AM, as described previously (34Coutu P. Metzger J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288 (-H612): H601Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, myocytes were loaded for 5 min with 5 μm Fura-2 AM (final Me2SO = 0.6%) at 37 °C followed by a 5-min wash-out for de-esterification. Myocytes were then stimulated at 0.2 Hz at 37 °C, and the base-line sarcomere length and Ca2+ transient were recorded from a single cell. Recordings were then made 5, 10, and 15 min after the addition of ET (10 nm), with the cell maintained in the dark between sampling times. Optimal cTnI phosphorylation was observed in response to 10-100 nm ET in an earlier study (4Westfall M.V. Borton A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33694-33700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Ten twitches/myocyte were collected for each sample. In addition to sarcomere shortening measurements, the resting and peak ratios, maximum Ca2+ transient rate (+dCa/dtmax), maximum Ca2+ decay rate (-dCa/dtmax), and time to 50 and 75% decay (TTD50, TTD75, respectively) in the Ca2+ transient were measured. The Ca2+ transient and shortening measurements were maintained over this same time interval in myocytes maintained under basal conditions. Statistical Analysis—Values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Grouped comparisons are analyzed using a Student's t test or analysis of variance testing (ANOVA). Statistical differences detected by ANOVA are compared with a Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test with p < 0.05 considered significantly different. Relationship between Ca2+ Transient and Contractile Response to Endothelin—Sarcomere shortening and Ca2+ transients were measured before and after ET in Fura-2-loaded myocytes expressing cTnI or ssTnI 4 days after gene transfer (Fig. 1, TABLE ONE). The increased peak shortening and enhanced relaxation rate observed in response to 10 nm ET in earlier work on myocytes expressing cTnI (4Westfall M.V. Borton A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33694-33700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), was similarly observed in myocytes loaded with Fura-2 (Fig. 1A). In myocytes expressing nonphosphorylatable ssTnI, the delayed relaxation and loss of the enhanced peak shortening observed in response to ET (4Westfall M.V. Borton A.R. J. Biol.

Ca2+ measurements shown include percent changes in resting Ca2+ fluorescence, maximum normalized Ca+ rise (dCa/dtmax), peak Ca2+ normalized for resting Ca2+ (peak Ca2+), maximum normalized Ca2+ decay (-dCa/dtmax), and time to 50 and 75% decay from peak (TTD50, TTD75).

Peak Ca2+ and the TTP remained unchanged in the ssTnI-expressing myocytes compared with values observed in controls at 0.2 Hz. The Ca2+ transient change observed in response to ET was then analyzed in myocytes expressing cTnI and ssTnI (TABLE ONE). The percent change in peak Ca2+ amplitude and maximum rate of Ca2+ decay (-dCa/dtmax) in response to ET was not significantly changed in myocytes expressing either cTnI or ssTnI (Fig. 1, A and B; TABLE ONE). However, significant delays were observed in the time to 75% Ca2+ decay in both groups of myocytes. The similar Ca2+ transient responses to ET coupled with the divergent shortening response of cTnI-versus ssTnI-expressing myocytes indicates that cTnI contributes significantly to the enhanced peak shortening and accelerated relaxation rate observed in response to PKC activation by ET compared with myocytes expressing ssTnI.TABLE TWOComparison of base-line sarcomere shortening and Ca2+ transient in adult rat cardiac myocytes expressing cTnI (control), ssTnI, or cTnIT144P Results are expressed as mean ± S.E., with p < 0.05 (see Footnote a) considered significantly different from control myocytes when compared by ANOVA and post-hoc Newman-Keuls tests.MeasurementscTnI (n = 35)ssTnI (n = 25)T144P (n = 25)Basal shortening SLR (μm)1.821 ± 0.0061.777 ± 0.0191.818 ± 0.010 TTP (s)0.070 ± 0.0030.075 ± 0.0060.070 ± 0.004 Peak height (μm)0.182 ± 0.0100.186 ± 0.0170.179 ± 0.015 TTR50 (s)0.035 ± 0.0020.125 ± 0.012ap < 0.050.029 ± 0.002Basal Ca2+ transient TTP (s)0.044 ± 0.0030.047 ± 0.0040.045 ± 0.004 Peak Ca2+ (AU)9.60 ± 1.036.70 ± 1.37.46 ± 1.89 TTD50 (s)0.148 ± 0.0070.189 ± 0.009ap < 0.050.149 ± 0.006a p < 0.05 Open table in a new tab Additional studies were performed to investigate whether the contribution of phosphorylated TnI to the ET-mediated change in contractile function is diminished with higher frequencies.

The percent decrease in peak shortening, +dl/dtmax and -dl/dtmax in response to increased frequency was similar before and after ET.

https://openalex.org/W1988125694,"The enzymes essential for bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis are attractive targets for antimicrobial drug development. One of these is MurB, which contains FAD as a cofactor and catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAcEP) to UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid. This study examined the roles of the conserved amino acid residues of Staphylococcus aureus MurB, which are located near the active site in x-ray crystal structures. Seven of 11 site-directed mutated murB genes lost the ability to complement a temperature-sensitive S. aureus murB mutant. Biochemical characterization of the seven mutated MurB proteins revealed that they cannot carry out the reduction of UDP-GlcNAcEP, although they can all catalyze the intramolecular reduction of FAD via NADPH. Spectrometric analyses of the oxidized form of the mutated proteins in the presence and absence of NADP+ or UDP-GlcNAcEP revealed that these essential amino acid residues play four distinct roles in substrate interactions: Arg213 is essential for maintenance of the electronic state of FAD; Arg176 is required for interaction with UDP-GlcNAcEP; His259 is required for interaction with both UDP-GlcNAcEP and NADP+; and Asn71, Tyr175, Ser226, and Glu296 are not apparently required for interaction with either ligand.

The results presented here identify for the first time the amino acid residues of MurB that are required for the interaction with UDP-Glc-NAcEP and NADP+. The expansion of infectious diseases caused by multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and other pathogenic bacteria has become an increasing global problem. Thus, the development of antibacterial drugs that have novel mechanisms of action or targets is needed. Peptidoglycan is a component of the bacterial cell wall and prevents cell lysis caused by high intracellular pressure. Because the enzymes responsible for peptidoglycan biosynthesis are ubiquitous in bacteria but are not found in humans, they are expected to be good targets for antibacterial drug development. Peptidoglycan consists of a saccharide backbone that is formed by alternating N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid residues with tetra- or pentapeptides that branch from N-acetylmuramic acid (1van Heijenoort J.

In S. aureus, l-lysine of one of the tetrapeptides is cross-linked to d-alanine of the other by a pentaglycine chain. The initial step of peptidoglycan biosynthesis is the conversion of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and phosphoenolpyruvate to UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAcEP) 3The abbreviations used are: UDP-GlcNAcEPUDP-N-acetylenolpyruvylglucosamineHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. by MurA. Subsequently, UDP-GlcNAcEP is reduced to UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid by MurB. Next, five amino acid residues (l-Ala, d-Glu, l-Lys, and d-Ala-d-Ala) are sequentially added onto the d-lactyl group of UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid by MurC, MurD, MurE, and MurF enzymes in a ribosome-independent manner.

However, it has not yet been determined whether MurB-targeting drugs are clinically effective. MurB is a flavoprotein that belongs to the FAD-binding protein superfamily, which shares a characteristic FAD binding fold (11Murzin A.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 386-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The MurB family is divided into at least two groups by amino acid sequence alignment: type I, which includes Escherichia coli MurB; and type II, which includes S. aureus MurB. This latter type lacks both a loop structure containing Tyr190 and a single split βαββ fold, which are found in the substrate binding domain of type I E. coli MurB (12Benson T.E. Harris M.S. Choi G.H. Cialdella J.I. Herberg J.T. Martin Jr., J.P. Baldwin E.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2340-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). X-ray structural analyses indicated that the E. coli type I and S. aureus type II MurB proteins have similar overall folds, although there are differences between the substrate binding regions due to amino acid deletions (12Benson T.E.

The enzyme reaction catalyzed by MurB is performed by Ping Pong Bi Bi mechanism, alternatively Ping Pong Tetra Uni in the Cleland system of nomenclature; the first step is the reduction of FAD, which consumes one equivalent of NADPH, and the second is an electron transfer from FADH2 to UDP-GlcNAcEP (14Dhalla A.M.

In this mechanism, both NADPH and UDP-GlcNAcEP bind to the same subdomain (15Farmer II, B.T. Constantine K.L. Goldfarb V. Friedrichs M.S. Wittekind M. Yanchunas Jr., J. Robertson J.G. Mueller L. Nat.

Experimental evidence for essential amino acid residues and their roles in the enzyme activity as well as protein structural information is critical for developing enzyme-specific antibacterial drugs. Amino acid residues located in or close to substrate binding sites, which are revealed by x-ray or NMR structural analysis, are not always essential for the enzyme activity. In this study, we examined whether the amino acid residues of S. aureus MurB, which are well conserved among various bacterial MurB proteins and are located close to the catalytic site, are essential for catalytic activity. Site-specifically mutated S. aureus murB genes were constructed and tested for the ability to complement a temperature-sensitive murB mutant of S. aureus (6Matsuo M. Kurokawa K. Nishida S. Li Y.

Seven residues, including Asn71, Tyr175, Arg176, Arg213, Ser226, His259, and Glu296, were found to be essential for activity. Purification and biochemical analyses of these mutated proteins revealed that each could carry out the NADPH-dependent reduction of FAD but that they could not complete the subsequent reduction of UDP-GlcNAcEP. Furthermore, the roles of each essential residue in the interaction of MurB with NADP+and UDP-GlcNAcEP were examined by differential spectral analyses of intramolecular FAD. This allowed classification of the essential residues into four functional groups. Reagents—All reagents were of analytical grade. Glucose oxidase, catalase, NADP+, NADPH, and protein molecular weight markers were purchased from Sigma. DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B and monoQ HR5/5 columns were from Amersham Biosciences. UDP-GlcNAcEP was synthesized in vitro from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and phosphoenolpyruvate using purified S. aureus MurA1 and isolated by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The UDP-GlcNAcEP was calculated according to the UV absorbance at 262 nm as described previously (6Matsuo M. Kurokawa K. Nishida S. Li Y. Takimura H. Kaito C. Fukuhara N. Maki H. Miura K. Murakami K.

Protein determination was performed by the Bradford method using the Bio-Rad protein assay and bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as a standard. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of the S. aureus murB gene was performed by the overlap extension method (19Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 13.36-13.39Google Scholar). Shown in Table 1 are the oligonucleotide sequences used, which were complementary internal primers that had 20-bp overlaps with the mutation site. The first round PCRs (15 cycles) were carried out using the upper primer of each construction in Table 1 paired with the murB3 primer, 5′-CCGGAATTCATAATGGCGACAGCGTGTTT-3′, corresponding to the 3′-end of the murB gene containing the EcoRI site (in boldface type) and the lower primer paired with the murB5 primer, 5′-TCAACTAATGATGATATTGCTTTGC-3′, corresponding to the upstream sequence of the MurB open reading frame. Each group of two primary PCR products was purified, mixed, and used for the second round of PCR (15 cycles) using the murB5 and murB3 primers, and products were digested with EcoRI and cloned into the pND50 shuttle vector at the EcoRI and SmaI sites. Site-specific mutations on cloned fragments were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The resulting plasmids were designated pNDmurBG67A, pNDmurBG69A, pNDmurBS70A, pNDmurBN71A, pNDmurBY175F, pNDmurBR176A, pNDmurBR213A, pNDmurBS226A, pNDmurBR230A, pNDmurBH259A, and pNDmurBE-296A, respectively.TABLE 1Primers used for site-directed mutagenesis of MurBMutationPrimer DNA sequenceaThe underlined bases indicate the nucleotide positions that were changedG67A5′-GTTACATATTTAGCAAATGGCTCAAAT-3′5′-ATTTGAGCCATTTGCTAAATATGTAAC-3′G69A5′-ATTTAGGAAATGCCTCAAATATTATT-3′5′-AATAATATTTGAGGCATTTCCTAAAT-3′S70A5′-TTAGGAAATGGCGCAAATATTATT-3′5′-AATAATATTTGCGCCATTTCCTAA-3′N71A5′-AGGAAATGGCTCAGCTATTATTATCCGTG-3′5′-CACGGATAATAATAGCTGAGCCATTTCCT-3′Y175F5′-TAGAGTTAGATTTTCGTAATAGCATT-3′5′-AATGCTATTACGAAAATCTAACTCTA-3′R176A5′-AGAGTTAGATTATGCTAATAGCATTATTC-3′5′-GAATAATGCTATTAGCATAATCTAACTCT-3′R213A5′-TTAACAGAACGTGCAGAATCTAAACA-3′5′-TGTTTAGATTCTGCACGTTCTGTTAA-3′S226A5′-CCTTCATGTGGTGCTGTATTCCAAAG-3′5′-CTTTGGAATACAGCACCACATGAAGG-3′R230A5′-AGTGTATTCCAAGCACCGCCTGGTC-3′5′-GACCAGGCGGTGCTTGGAATACACT-3′H259A5′-GAAGTTTCAACCAAAGCCGCTGGTTTTATGGT-3′5′-ACCATAAAACCAGCGGCTTTGGTTGAAACTTC-3′E296A5′-GAATTAAATCGTGCAGTTCGCATT-3′5′-AATGCGAACTGCACGATTTAATTC-3′a The underlined bases indicate the nucleotide positions that were changed Open table in a new tab Complementation Assay—Complementation assays were performed as described previously (6Matsuo M. Kurokawa K. Nishida S. Li Y. Takimura H. Kaito C. Fukuhara N. Maki H. Miura K. Murakami K. Sekimizu K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 222: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The S. aureus murB temperature-sensitive mutant TS2901 was transformed with 100 ng of plasmids described above, pNDmurBs, and its vector pND50 by electroporation in a 0.2-cm cuvette (Gene Pulser II; Bio-Rad). Transformants were grown on NaCl-free LB agar plates containing 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 30 or 43 °C. The numbers of transformants were counted after 24 h. Plasmids for Overexpression of MurB—To construct plasmid series of pETSXmurB for overexpression of S. aureus MurB in E. coli, the MurB open reading frame was amplified with PCR using the primers for murB3 described above and a primer for murB5N, 5′-GAAAGGATGTACTCCATGGTGATAAATAAA-3′, that incorporated the NcoI site (in boldface type) with the initiation codon and using pSmurB, a plasmid harboring the wild-type S. aureus murB gene (6Matsuo M. Kurokawa K. Nishida S. Li Y. Takimura H. Kaito C. Fukuhara N. Maki H. Miura K. Murakami K. Sekimizu K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 222: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), as a template. The product was digested with NcoI and EcoRI and then ligated into the NcoI and EcoRI sites of pET21d (Novagen), resulting in the plasmid pETmurB. The HindIII site in its multicloning site was removed by digestion with SalI and XhoI and self-ligated. This resulting plasmid was designated pETSXmurB. With regard to the seven mutant murB genes that eliminated the ability to complement the temperature-sensitive S. aureus murB mutant in vivo, each DNA fragment harboring the mutation site was cut off by digestion with HindIII and EcoRI from the respective pND50-based plasmid and exchanged with the corresponding region of pETSXmurB at the HindIII and EcoRI sites. The resulting plasmids were designated pETSXmurBN71A, pETSXmurBY175F, pETSXmurBR176A, pETSXmurBR213A, pETSXmurBS226A, pETSXmurBH259A, and pETSXmurBE296A, respectively. Purification of S. aureus MurB—BL21 (DE3)/pLysS (Novagen) were transformed with plasmids of the pETSXmurB series. Each strain was grown in 1 liter of LB medium at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.5, after which the culture was adjusted to 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After a 2-h induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with 30 ml of 0.9% NaCl, and frozen in liquid N2. The frozen cell paste (∼3 g) was resuspended and lysed in 6 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25 m KCl, 0.3 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma), and 20 mm spermidine (Sigma)) on ice for 20 min. Samples were again frozen and thawed and then sonicated four times for 30 s using a Branson Sonifier 450. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 145,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and cleared lysates (Fraction I) were adjusted to 0.3 g/ml ammonium sulfate and stirred for 20 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 20 min, ammonium sulfate was added again to the supernatant to a final concentration of 0.5 g/ml. The precipitate was collected, and the deep yellow pellet was dissolved in buffer C′ (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 20% (v/v) glycerol) and dialyzed against the same buffer (Fraction II). Fraction II was loaded at a flow rate of 1 ml/min onto a DEAE-Sepharose CL6-B column (1.5 × 10 cm) preequilibrated with buffer C′ and then eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.8 m NaCl in buffer C′. Active wild-type MurB was identified in the 0.2 m NaCl eluate. Pooled MurB (Fraction III) was dialyzed against buffer C′, loaded onto a monoQ HR5/5 column at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min, and eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 m NaCl in buffer C′. Active wild-type MurB again eluted at 0.2 m NaCl and was pooled (Fraction IV). The various mutated forms of MurB were prepared in a similar way, and MurB was followed using the absorbance of FAD at 460 nm. The purity of each Fraction IV exceeded 80% on SDS-PAGE. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Proteins were stored at -80 °C. Enzymatic Assays—A typical aerobic MurB assay was performed as described previously (20Anwar R.A. Vlaovic M. Can. J. Biochem. 1979; 57: 188-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) in a reaction mixture (0.1 ml) of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm UDP-GlcNAcEP, and 0.15 mm NADPH in an open cuvette. Anaerobic reactions were performed as described previously (14Dhalla A.M. Yanchunas Jr., J. Ho H.T. Falk P.J. Villafranca J.J. Robertson J.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5390-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Reactions (0.4 ml) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm UDP-GlcNAcEP, 0.15 mm NADPH, 10 mm d-glucose, 20 units/ml glucose oxidase, and 26 units/ml catalase. The reaction mixtures were added to semimicrocuvettes with Teflon caps (GL Sciences) and flushed with nitrogen gas. After maintaining the mixture at room temperature for 5 min, reactions were started by adding enzyme followed by both flushing with nitrogen gas and capping under a nitrogen atmosphere. Under these conditions, oxygen was scavenged immediately (21Englander S.W. Calhoun D.B. Englander J.J. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In each assay, the initial velocity of NADPH oxidation at room temperature was determined by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm every 30 or 60 s for 5 min using a UV-160A or a UV-2200 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) and with 3-30 pmol of MurB. To determine specific activities, an extinction coefficient of 6220 m-1 cm-1 at 340 nm was used for NADPH. It was confirmed that the absorbance was linear up to 0.27 mm. Km values for NADPH and UDP-GlcNAcEP were determined as described previously (22Axley M.J. Fairman R. Yanchunas Jr., J. Villafranca J.J. Robertson J.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 812-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Determination of FAD Content of MurB—Determination of the FAD content was performed as described previously (23Benson T.E. Marquardt J.L. Marquardt A.C. Etzkorn F.A. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2024-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). FAD was released from MurB (Fraction IV; 3 μg) by boiling for 5 min followed by the addition of 70% ethanol. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g at room temperature for 5 min to remove denatured proteins, flavin was recovered in the supernatant. The flavin was analyzed by HPLC using a TOSOH analytical C-18 column (TSK-gel ODS-80Ts QA; 4.6 × 250 mm) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a solvent of 35% (v/v) methanol, 100 mm formic acid, 100 mm ammonium formate (pH 3.5) using a Hitachi L-7480 fluorescence detector (excitation, 470 nm; emission, 530 nm) and with FAD (Yamasa) as a standard. Determination of Kd Values of MurB for UDP-GlcNAcEP or NADP+—Determinations of Kd values of wild-type and mutated MurB for either UDP-GlcNAcEP or NADP+ were carried out using difference spectrum analyses as described previously (22Axley M.J. Fairman R. Yanchunas Jr., J. Villafranca J.J. Robertson J.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 812-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Absorption spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-2200 spectrophotometer at a scan rate of 50 nm/min. MurB at a final concentration of 15-20 nm was assayed in buffer C′ at room temperature. Difference spectra, which can improve both the sensitivity and selectivity to detect the spectral perturbation elicited by ligand binding, were computed from the spectra in the presence and absence of ligand and were corrected for dilution. The absorbance changes at 510 nm as a function of ligand concentration were fitted to the following theoretical equation for a 1:1 binding stoichiometry by nonlinear regression using the Kaleida Graph program (Synergy Software Ltd.), where A represents the measured absorption, A0 is the starting absorbance, ΔA is the total measured change in absorbance, [E0] is the enzyme concentration, Kd is the ligand dissociation constant, and [S0] is the concentration of ligand added to the enzyme. A=A0+(ΔA/E0)((Kd+[E0]+[S0])-((Kd+[E0]+[S0])2-4[E0][S0])1/2)/2(Eq. 1) Molecular Modeling of Active Site Residues—The S. aureus MurB·UDP-GlcNAcEP complex was drawn using Swiss-PdbViewer 3.7, which automatically fitted UDP-GlcNAcEP from the E. coli MurB·UDP-GlcNAcEP complex (13Benson T.E. Filman D.J. Walsh C.T. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 644-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 2mbr) into the S. aureus MurB structure (12Benson T.E. Harris M.S. Choi G.H. Cialdella J.I. Herberg J.T. Martin Jr., J.P. Baldwin E.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2340-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1hsk) using a three-dimensional match procedure. The graphic was rendered using POV-Ray 3.6. Selection of Amino Acid Residues of MurB for Mutational Analyses—Fig. 2 shows the amino acid sequences for several regions of MurB from a number of bacteria, with boxes enclosing highly conserved residues. X-ray crystal structure analyses of the E. coli MurB·UDP-GlcNAcEP complex and S. aureus MurB revealed that most of these conserved residues are located close to the cofactor FAD or substrate UDP-GlcNAcEP binding sites (12Benson T.E.

Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 644-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In this study, we selected 11 amino acid residues (Fig. 2) that are highly conserved among both type I and II enzymes and are located near the active sites as residues that may be essential for enzyme activity. We examined this by constructing mutants in which the targeted amino acid was replaced with alanine or, in the case of tyrosine residues, with phenylalanine. Gly67, Gly69, Ser70, Asn71, and Arg213 are located close to the FAD biding site, whereas Tyr175, Arg176, Ser226, Arg230, His259, and Glu296 are located close to the UDP-GlcNAcEP binding site. Both Asn71 and Arg213 are near the enolpyruvyl group of UDP-GlcNAcEP. Ser226 corresponds to Ser229 of E. coli MurB, which was reported previously as a catalytic residue whose hydroxyl group is thought to transfer a proton for the reduction of UDP-GlcNAcEP (18Benson T.E. Walsh C.T. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 796-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In Vivo Complementation Test of the Mutated murB Genes with a Temperature-sensitive murB Mutant—We next examined the abilities of the mutated murB genes to complement the temperature-sensitive S. aureus murB strain TS2901. The TS2901 strain was electroporated with plasmids harboring the murB genes, and the transformants were counted (6Matsuo M. Kurokawa K. Nishida S. Li Y. Takimura H. Kaito C. Fukuhara N. Maki H. Miura K. Murakami K. Sekimizu K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 222: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Wild-type murB gene formed a similar number of transformants at 30 and 43 °C, whereas the empty vector plasmid could not form transformants at 43 °C (Table 2). The number of transformants at 43 °C was less than 1% of that at 30 °C for the N71A, Y175F, R176A, R213A, S226A, H259A, and E296A mutated murB genes. On the other hand, similar numbers of transformants were formed at 30 and 43 °C by the G67A, G69A, S70A, and R230A mutants. Thus, it appears that the N71A, Y175F, R176A, R213A, S226A, H259A, and E296A mutants lose MurB activity, whereas G67A, G69A, S70A, and R230A retain the activity.TABLE 2Activity of mutated forms of MurB in vivo The temperature-sensitive mutant TS2901 of S. aureus murB was transformed by electroporation with 100 ng of pND50 vector or pND50-derived plasmid harboring the wild-type or mutated murB gene. The numbers of transformants were counted after 24 h at 30 or 43 °C.murB alleleE. coli residueaThe corresponding residues for the E. coli enzyme are shownEfficiency of transformation43 °C/30 °C ratio30 °C43 °C× 104/μg DNAG67AGly473.43.81.1G69AGly494.11.90.94S70ASer500.960.951.0N71AAsn514.8<0.001<0.0002Y175FTyr1582.00.0180.009R176AArg1593.80.0010.0002S226ASer2293.9<0.001<0.0002R213AArg2143.0<0.001<0.0003R230AAsn2334.03.90.97H259AGln2884.9<0.001<0.0002E296AGlu3250.65<0.001<0.001Wild-type3.95.21.3- (vector)4.8<0.001<0.0002a The corresponding residues for the E. coli enzyme are shown Open table in a new tab Gly67 and Gly69 comprise a Gly-X-Gly motif, which is a conserved sequence in the FAD-binding domain of FAD-binding proteins. X-ray structural analysis of S. aureus MurB indicates that Gly67 and Gly69 interact with the α-phosphoryl moiety of FAD by the main-chain nitrogen, and the following residue, Ser70, interacts with the β-phosphoryl moiety of FAD via both its main-chain nitrogen and its side-chain hydroxyl group (12Benson T.E.

Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 644-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The fact that both G67A and G69A can complement the temperature-sensitive mutant suggests that the glycine residues of the GXG motif can be replaced with an alanine residue. This result is consistent with the finding that several FAD binding proteins have alanine at glycine positions in the GXG motif (24Fraaije M.W. Van Berkel W.J. Benen J.A. Visser J. Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 206-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and that the main-chain nitrogen of the glycine residues is responsible for the interaction with FAD (12Benson T.E.

Purification of Mutated MurB Proteins—To determine the roles of the essential residues of the S. aureus MurB protein, each mutated MurB that was inactive for in vivo complementation was expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. To follow the purification of wild-type MurB, we measured the specific activity for UDP-GlcNAcEP reductase under aerobic conditions (Table 3). On the last step of column chromatography (monoQ), the MurB proteins eluted with peaks of both A460 and A280. The final fraction (Fractio"

This concept is also illustrated by the co-crystal structures of three bacterial enzymes related to CAD, the Vibrio vulnificus nuclease (Vvn) and the Escherichia coli nuclease colicins E7 (ColE7) and E9 (ColE9) (14Hsia K.C.

Vvn nuclease and ColE7/E9 are a periplasmic nuclease and bacterial toxins engaged in host defense and cell killing, respectively. These nonspecific nucleases mainly bind DNA in the minor groove, with their ββα-Me-finger motifs forming contacts to the phosphodiester backbone of one strand of the substrate and establishing only minor contacts to the DNA major groove (21Hsia K.C.

In contrast, the sequence-specific members of the H-N-H or ββα-Me-finger nucleases, such as the homing endonucleases I-PpoI or I-HmuI, also use their ββα-Me-finger motifs to contact the cleavage site via the DNA minor groove. In addition, they use more structural elements to form specific contacts to the phosphodiester backbone and the bases via the minor and major grooves of their DNA substrates (24Shen B.W.

With the aim of identifying the structural basis for the unusual capacity of CAD to form stable DNA complexes as a nonspecific nuclease, we performed a mutational analysis of putative DNA binding residues in combination with computational modeling of CAD·DNA complexes on the basis of DNA co-crystal structures of the above mentioned related nonspecific nucleases (21Hsia K.C.

Our results suggest that CAD forms stable DNA complexes via a DNA binding region that comprises residues close to or directly from helix α4 distal to the active site. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant DFF was produced by co-expressing GST-tagged CAD variants together with human ICAD-L (DFF45) in E. coli BL21Gold(DE3) cells harboring the two compatible expression vectors pGEX-2T-CAD and pACET-DFF45. For each DFF variant, recombinant protein from 2 liters of culture was purified via glutathione affinity chromatography. GST-tagged DFF was bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4-B beads in buffer A (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Triton X-100) supplemented with 2.5 mm MgCl2, treated with DNase I (20 units) to digest contaminating DNA, and subsequently washed intensively with buffer A containing 750 mm NaCl. Purified complex was eluted from the glutathione-Sepharose 4-B beads using buffer A supplemented with reduced glutathione to 20 mm. Initially, protein was purified via GST affinity chromatography without DNase I and high salt treatment; it was further purified by anion-exchange chromatography over a Mono-Q HR5/5 column by applying a linear gradient in 15 ml of 100-400 mm NaCl in buffer A at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Eluted DFF was concentrated using Centriplus-30 ultrafiltration units. Caspase-3 was expressed and purified as described previously (27Meiss G. Scholz S.R. Korn C. Gimadutdinow O. Pingoud A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3901-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Generation of Arginine and Phenylalanine Mutants—Arginine mutants of CAD were prepared as described previously (28Kirsch R.D. Joly E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1848-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The following primers were used to introduce the desired mutations: R151A (AGGTTTGGAGTCGGCATTTCGAAATAAGTCGGGCTA), R166A (ACAGCTGTGAGAGTGCAATCCGCGGTTACCTAAGAGA), R168A (TGAGAGTCGGATCGCCGGCTACCTAAGAGAGGT), R212A (CAGCTATTTCGACGCAGGCGCCGAGGCCAGCAG), R250A (CCCTATGGCAACGCAGAGTCGCGAATCCTCTTCAGTAC), R269A (TATAATAGAGAAGAAGGCAACCGTTGTACCCACGCTG), F152A (AAGGTTTGGAGTCGAGAGCGCGCAATAAGTCGGGCTA). The codon for alanine is shown in bold type, and restriction sites co-introduced as markers are underlined. Enzyme Activity Assays—To measure enzymatic activity of CAD variants, DFF was treated with recombinant caspase-3 and the free nuclease incubated at 37 °C with plasmid DNA as substrate in a buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.01% CHAPS, and 5 mm MgCl2. After certain time points, aliquots were taken from the reaction mixture and DNA cleavage analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. To quantitate enzymatic activity the intensity of the band representing supercoiled plasmid DNA normalized to the linear and open circular forms was measured with a BioDocAnalyze gel analysis system (Biometra) using the implemented software. The disappearance of supercoiled plasmid DNA over time was used to determine relative cleavage activities from plots of band intensity versus time. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—EMSA with plasmid DNA and recombinant DFF was carried out as described previously (17Korn C. Scholz S.R. Gimadutdinow O. Lurz R. Pingoud A. Meiss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6005-6015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). EMSA with PCR-derived DNA was performed by incubating a 273-bp PCR product at a concentration of 139 nm for 10 min with indicated amounts (Fig. 6) of DFF variants at 23 °C in shift buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.01% CHAPS). Bound complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis on 4% native polyacrylamide gels followed by ethidium bromide staining and visualization. Poly(ADP-ribose) Binding Assay—To analyze the influence of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) on the DNA binding properties of CAD, we performed EMSA in the presence of PAR with a 44-bp double-stranded DNA fragment 32P end labeled on one strand. DFF or caspase-3-activated DFF at a concentration of 1 μm was incubated in shift buffer with the indicated amount (Fig. 2) of PAR for 10 min prior to adding DNA to a final concentration of 10 nm (∼30,000 cpm). Aliquots of the binding reactions were separated by electrophoresis on 4% native polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by autoradiography. Conserved Arginine Residues Contribute to DNA Cleavage by CAD— Arginine residues are frequently involved in substrate binding by proteins interacting with nucleic acids (29Jones S. Daley D.T. Luscombe N.M. Berman H.M. Thornton J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 30Nadassy K. Wodak S.J. Janin J.

Primary sequence analysis of CAD proteins from diverse species suggests the presence of six conarginine served residues (Arg151, Arg166, Arg168, Arg212, Arg250, and Arg269) in the C-terminal catalytic domain of CAD (Fig. 1A). To investigate the contribution of these residues to DNA binding and cleavage by CAD, we produced CAD variants with substitution for alanine of these conserved residues, expanding previously performed mutational analyses of amino acid residues critical for activity of the enzyme (11Scholz S.R. Korn C. Bujnicki J.M. Gimadutdinow O. Pingoud A. Meiss G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9288-9294Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 27Meiss G. Scholz S.R. Korn C. Gimadutdinow O. Pingoud A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1325-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Activity assays with a plasmid DNA substrate and recombinant proteins purified from E. coli by glutathione affinity chromatography revealed that all arginine variants of CAD tested here exhibit reduced cleavage activities, albeit to different extents, and thus contribute directly or indirectly to DNA binding and/or cleavage by this enzyme (Fig. 1, B and C). One of these conserved arginine residues (Arg269) is located at the ββα-Me-finger active site motif of CAD, two residues (Arg250 and Arg212) are involved in homodimerization of CAD or located in spatial proximity to the N-terminal end of helix α4 (residues Ser156-Ser179), respectively, and three of these residues (Arg151, Arg166, and Arg) belong to either a loop region preceding helix α4 or helix α4 itself (Fig. 1A), suggesting that this structural element plays an important role in DNA binding and/or cleavage by CAD (10Woo E.J. Kim Y.G. Kim M.S. Han W.D. Shin S. Robinson H. Park S.Y. Oh B.H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 531-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 17Korn C. Scholz S.R. Gimadutdinow O. Lurz R. Pingoud A. Meiss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6005-6015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). PAR Interferes with DNA Binding by CAD and the CAD·ICAD Complex—We have shown previously that DFF (CAD·ICAD) binds to DNA, though in the heterodimeric DFF complex the nuclease is inactivated by the inhibitory subunit (17Korn C. Scholz S.R. Gimadutdinow O. Lurz R. Pingoud A. Meiss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6005-6015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Given that a single amino acid substitution in the nuclease subunit (Lys155 → Gln) abolishes DNA binding by DFF and the free nuclease itself, we proposed that the nuclease subunit alone is responsible for DNA binding by DFF (17Korn C. Scholz S.R. Gimadutdinow O. Lurz R. Pingoud A. Meiss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6005-6015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition to the catalytic center of CAD, which consists of a ββα-Me-finger motif and very likely contacts DNA via the minor groove, a structural analysis of the active CAD homodimer suggested that helix α4 is in a favored position to bind DNA via the major groove (10Woo E.J. Kim Y.G. Kim M.S. Han W.D. Shin S. Robinson H. Park S.Y. Oh B.H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 531-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). As shown recently, this helix α4 overlaps with a conserved poly(ADP-ribose) binding motif (residues Arg151-Arg172 in CAD) that allows modulation of CAD activity by non-covalent interaction with PAR (Fig. 2A) (33West J.D. Ji C. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15141-15147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). PAR is known to bind to specific domains in DNA damage checkpoint proteins (34Malanga M. Pleschke J.M. Kleczkowska H.E. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11839-11843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 35Althaus F.R. Kleczkowska H.E. Malanga M. Muntener C.R. Pleschke J.M. Ebner M. Auer B. Mol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 40974-40980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). We have used this interaction of CAD with PAR to determine whether the DNA binding ability of not only the free nuclease, as shown earlier, but also DFF (CAD·ICAD) can be modulated by PAR. As a result, competition assays in which DFF and caspase-3-treated DFF were incubated with PAR prior to DNA binding revealed that PAR interferes with the ability of free CAD and CAD in the DFF complex to induce a mobility shift in the DNA (Fig. 2B). To interfere with DNA binding by DFF as compared with the free nuclease a higher concentration of PAR was needed, indicating that CAD in complex with the inhibitory subunit ICAD-L (DFF45) probably binds PAR more weakly than free CAD. These results suggest that helix α4 is indeed part of a DNA binding site accessible in free CAD as well as CAD bound to its inhibitor in the DFF complex. Models of CAD·DNA Complexes—To gain insight into the structural basis for stable DNA complex formation by CAD, we modeled CAD·DNA complexes by superimposing the active site motifs of ColE7 and Vvn nuclease from DNA co-crystal structures with the active site of CAD (Fig. 3). The structural analysis yielded two models of CAD binding to DNA, with differences arising from dissimilar conformational changes induced in the DNA by the two bacterial nucleases. Although ColE7 does not produce major distortions in the DNA, Vvn nuclease widens the minor groove and bends the DNA toward the major groove at an angle of ∼20° (21Hsia K.C. Chak K.F. Liang P.H. Cheng Y.S. Ku W.Y. Yuan H.S. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Li C.L. Hor L.I. Chang Z.F. Tsai L.C. Yang W.Z. Yuan H.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4014-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We also modeled the CAD·DNA complex with DNA from the ColE9·DNA·Mg2+ ternary complex (23Mate M.J. Kleanthous C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34763-34769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Given the high similarity between ColE7 and E9 this yielded a model that, as expected, is highly similar to the one obtained with DNA from the ColE7·DNA complex (data not shown). The electrostatic potential distribution on the DNA binding surface of CAD suggests that DNA might indeed be bent toward the major groove, as seen in the Vvn·DNA complex (data not shown). As expected, in both models the active site motif of CAD faces the DNA minor groove, and helix-α4 nicely aligns with the DNA major groove. Selection, Purification, and Stability of CAD Variants—To support our predicted model for CAD·DNA complexes and to analyze the CAD-DNA interaction in more detail we purified from E. coli an assortment of CAD variants with substitution of the conserved arginine residues described above and of selected variants (K155Q, K310Q, and H313N) described previously (11Scholz S.R. Korn C. Bujnicki J.M. Gimadutdinow O. Pingoud A. Meiss G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9288-9294Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 32Korn C. Scholz S.R. Gimadutdinow O. Pingoud A. Meiss G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1325-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition we exchanged Phe152 of CAD to alanine, because we suspected this highly conserved amino acid residue forms contacts to the DNA together with its neighboring residue Arg151 from a loop region preceding helix α4 (Fig. 4A). Together, these variants carry amino acid substitutions at conserved residues that are either part of the ββα-Me-finger active site motif of CAD or located distal from the active site in the region around helix α4 that largely overlaps with the PAR binding region (compare Figs. 2A and 4A). Because some of the DFF complexes with certain CAD variants when purified by ion-exchange chromatography over a Mono-Q column as described previously turned out to be unstable, we established a different protocol for DFF purification: DFF bound to glutathione-4B-beads was treated with DNase I and then extensively washed with high salt buffer to get rid of contaminating DNA that would otherwise interfere with the gel retardation analysis (17Korn C. Scholz S.R. Gimadutdinow O. Lurz R. Pingoud A. Meiss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6005-6015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Using this protocol the majority of desired DFF complexes could be produced, with the exception of the DFFN-F152A variant (carrying the nuclease subunit with Phe152 exchanged to Ala), which could not be obtained as a DNA-free complex irrespective of the purification protocol applied (Fig. 4B). Intriguingly, most CAD variants that turned out to be proficient in forming stable DNA complexes (see below) could be readily purified by ion-exchange chromatography over a Mono-Q column, whereas those variants that turned out to be deficient in stable DNA complex formation caused dissociation of the DFF complex on the Mono-Q column, suggesting a correlation between the stability of the variant DFF complexes during the purification procedure and their ability to form stable DNA complexes. All of the nuclease variants produced showed little if any plasmid cleavage activity, with the notable exception of the R250A variant (Fig. 4C). Variants of CAD in Complex with ICAD (DFF) and as the Free Enzyme Behave Similarly in the EMSA—To test the DNA binding ability of the selected CAD variants in complex with ICAD and as the free enzyme, we first carried out EMSA with DFF (CAD·ICAD) and with the free nuclease released from DFF by caspase-3 treatment. To this end, DFF with mutated nuclease subunits at a final concentration of 5 μm was incubated with plasmid DNA and the binding reactions analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5A, upper panel). In parallel, DFF complexes with mutated nuclease subunits were treated with recombinant caspase-3 to release the nuclease, and DNA binding reactions were analyzed as above (Fig. 5A, lower panel). Generally, in the assay DFF complex and the free nuclease behave similarly with only slight differences in the appearance of the protein·DNA complexes, suggesting that ICAD does not interfere with the function of residues involved in stable DNA complex formation by CAD. As seen from Fig. 5A, only one of the selected variants (H313N) displays wild type-like DNA binding activity in the EMSA with plasmid DNA, whereas all other mutants exhibit a reduced ability to induce a mobility shift in the DNA, albeit to different extents. Although the variants R166A, K310Q, and R269A are still able to shift plasmid DNA in the assay, the variants R151A, K155Q, R168A, and R212A do not induce a detectable mobility shift in the DNA under the conditions applied, with the exception of R250A, which leads to a slight mobility shift in the DNA. As shown above (Figs. 1C and 4C), most of the nuclease variants, as expected, show little if any plasmid cleavage activity, with the exception of the R250A variant. This variant cleaves plasmid DNA with reasonable activity, even at nanomolar enzyme concentration. Because the R250A variant is the only variant tested so far that readily cleaves DNA but fails to induce a strong mobility shift at the concentrations used above, we prepared larger amounts of this variant and tested its DNA binding activity at concentrations exceeding 5 μm. In these experiments the variant R250A induces a moderate mobility shift in plasmid DNA at relatively high concentrations compared with the wild type enzyme (Fig. 5B). Relative DNA Binding Activities of CAD Variants in Complex with ICAD—All the nuclease variants analyzed so far show diminished DNA cleavage activity, and some also lost the ability to induce a mobility shift in a plasmid DNA substrate. To gain information on the relative binding activities of the CAD variants, we used an assay that allowed us to obtain more quantitative data on DNA complex formation by CAD. We carried out EMSA with DFF variants and a 273-bp PCR-derived double-stranded DNA substrate (Fig. 6A). Analysis of the DNA binding data in conjunction with the localization of the amino acid residues exchanged revealed that the variants fall into three groups. The first group comprises variants that are deficient in DNA cleavage yet proficient in inducing a mobility shift in the DNA (variants with amino acid substitution of Arg166, Arg296, Lys310, and His313). This behavior can be considered typical for variants mainly affected in catalysis. The second group consists of variants that are deficient in DNA binding as well as DNA cleavage (variants with amino acid substitution of Arg151 and Arg168), which can be considered typical for mutants mainly affected in substrate binding. Phe152 most likely also contacts DNA directly; however, exchanging this residue in CAD leads to a highly unstable variant that cannot be analyzed by EMSA. The third group comprises variants with substitution of residues probably contributing to the stability of CAD, thus most likely indirectly influencing its DNA binding and cleavage abilities (Lys155, Arg212, and Arg250) (Fig. 6B). Together these residues form a bipartite DNA binding surface and a structurally important region responsible for stable DNA complex formation as well as DNA cleavage by CAD (Fig. 7). In the present study we have reported the modeling of CAD·DNA complexes accompanied by a mutational and biochemical analysis of the DNA binding activities of selected CAD variants. On the basis of their DNA binding properties and available structural data, the variants investigated here can be sorted into three groups, those with substitution of active site residues having no influence on stable DNA binding and those with substitution of residues close to or directly from helix α4, being directly or indirectly important for stable DNA complex formation, respectively. Indeed, these different categories of amino acid residues reflect distinct functional regions of a bipartite DNA binding surface important for stable DNA complex formation and DNA cleavage by CAD as well as a structurally important region that contributes indirectly to stable DNA complex formation and DNA cleavage by the enzyme. One part of the bipartite DNA binding surface encompasses the active site of CAD with a ββα-Me-finger motif that faces the DNA minor groove (Figs. 3 and 7). In contrast to other ββα-Me-finger nucleases, CAD aligns a loop rather than an α-helix with the DNA minor groove. This loop contains the active site residues His308, His313, and Lys310 involved in cofactor binding and substrate positioning (10Woo E.J. Kim Y.G. Kim M.S. Han W.D. Shin S. Robinson H. Park S.Y. Oh B.H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 531-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 11Scholz S.R. Korn C. Bujnicki J.M. Gimadutdinow O. Pingoud A. Meiss G.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1325-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Also included in this part of the bipartite DNA binding surface is residue Arg269, conserved in all CAD proteins (Fig. 1A). Variants with substitution of amino acid residues from this region, K310Q, H313N, and R269A (and also H263N characterized previously, Ref. 17Korn C. Scholz S.R. Gimadutdinow O. Lurz R. Pingoud A. Meiss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6005-6015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), retain the ability to form stable DNA complexes yet show little DNA cleavage activity, suggesting that these surface-exposed residues from the active site are not required for stable DNA complex formation by CAD. However, different from ColE7 and Vvn nuclease, CAD has established pronounced interactions with the DNA major groove via a second DNA binding region. This region, which locates distal to the active site, represents the second part of the bipartite DNA binding surface and largely overlaps with the previously identified PAR binding site (Figs. 2A and 7B) (33West J.D. Ji C. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15141-15147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It includes residues nearby or directly from helix α4 of CAD that nicely align with the DNA major groove (Figs. 3 and 7). Conserved arginine residues from helix α4 (Arg166 and Arg168) span the major groove, with the side chain of Arg166 being very close to the active site and contacting the phosphodiester backbone with the scissile bond and the side chain of Arg168 pointing away from the active site, contacting the phosphodiester backbone of the opposite strand (Fig. 7A). Upon amino acid substitution of Arg166 or Arg168, CAD variants display drastically reduced DNA cleavage activities. However, variant R166A, in contrast to variant R168A, retains the ability to form stable DNA complexes, suggesting that Arg166 falls into the class of an active site residue, whereas Arg168 is indeed required for stable DNA complex formation. Two other conserved surface-exposed amino acid residues (Arg151 and Phe152), located farthest away from the active site in a loop and a short β-strand directly preceding helix α4, are also part of this second DNA binding region and thus critical for stable DNA complex formation by CAD. Unfortunately, the likely role of Phe152 in DNA binding could not be analyzed because the F152A variant was unstable. Considering the correlation we observed between the stability of CAD variants during the purification procedure and their ability to form stable DNA complexes, it seems very likely that Phe152 together with its neighboring residue Arg151 directly contacts the DNA. Finally, the residues Lys155, Arg212, and Arg250 represent a group of residues that define a structurally important region in CAD. Whereas Lys155 is buried in the protein and located at the N-terminal end of helix α4, Arg212 and Arg250 are surface-exposed residues but no part of the DNA binding surface of CAD. These residues are most likely indirectly involved in DNA binding and seem to play an important structural role in stabilizing helix α4 (Lys155 and Arg212) as well as supporting homodimerization of CAD (Arg250) (Fig. 7) (10Woo E.J. Kim Y.G. Kim M.S. Han W.D. Shin S. Robinson H. Park S.Y. Oh B.H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 531-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Interestingly, exchange of Arg250 that is located at the dimerization interface of CAD influences the DNA binding and cleavage activity of CAD. The effect seen upon substitution of this conserved arginine residue is likely to be indirect because it is too far away from the DNA substrate. It could arise from structural perturbation of the DNA binding surface and/or the dimerization interface of CAD. Provided that disturbing the homodimerization of the enzyme is responsible for the drop in DNA binding and cleavage by CAD, our finding would support the hypothesis that preventing homodimerization of CAD by ICAD is the principle mechanism of inhibition of this nuclease (10Woo E.J. Kim Y.G. Kim M.S. Han W.D. Shin S. Robinson H. Park S.Y. Oh B.H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 531-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It would also mean that dimerization of CAD already occurs at pico- to nanomolar concentrations because recombinant CAD is reasonably active at these concentrations. With its dimeric structure and its ability to form stable DNA complexes, CAD on the one hand significantly differs from other nonspecific nucleases and instead displays similarities to sequence-specific nucleases such as restriction enzymes or homing endonucleases (16Galburt E.A. Stoddard B.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13851-13860Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 17Korn C. Scholz S.R. Gimadutdinow O. Lurz R. Pingoud A. Meiss G. J. Biol.

Whereas the latter mostly act as dimers or pseudo-dimers and exhibit complex protein·DNA interfaces, the nonspecific nucleases typically act as monomers or dimers with independent active sites. They usually form only a minimum of contacts sufficient to bring about DNA cleavage, at the same time avoiding specific DNA complex formation (14Hsia K.C. Li C.L. Yuan H.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 126-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 19Suck D. J. Mol. Recognit. 1994; 7: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 38Franke I. Meiss G. Pingoud A. J. Biol.

On the other hand, different from restriction enzymes or homing endonucleases, the stable DNA complexes formed by CAD are nonspecific and thus enable the enzyme to degrade DNA, still without selectivity, a prerequisite for the physiological function of the enzyme, which is to cut any accessible linker DNA it engages. Because CAD forms stable DNA complexes in the presence of its inhibitor ICAD, it is tempting to speculate that the biological function of stable DNA complex formation by the CAD·ICAD complex is to bind the DNA in apoptotic cells prior to nuclease activation by caspase-3 in order to transform the proximity to its substrate into highly efficient DNA fragmentation (17Korn C. Scholz S.R. Gimadutdinow O. Lurz R. Pingoud A. Meiss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6005-6015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It could well be that in non-apoptotic cells the CAD·ICAD complex forms transient interactions with chromatin, employing direct contacts to the DNA as well as indirect contacts to its substrate mediated by chromatin-associated proteins such as histone H1 and HMGB1 and 2, which have been shown to interact with CAD and stimulate its activity (18Widlak P.

Interaction of CAD with these proteins might be important for the enzyme to gain access to the linker DNA between nucleosomes. In summary, our results demonstrate that CAD possesses, in addition to the active site, a second DNA binding region responsible for stable DNA complex formation by the free enzyme and the DFF (CAD·ICAD) complex. This binding site is formed by conserved surface-exposed amino acid residues close to and directly from helix α4, which is distal to the ββα-Me-finger active site motif of this nuclease and binds in the DNA major groove. In addition, we identified a region important for stabilization of helix α4 that comprises amino acid residues in spatial proximity to the N-terminal end of this helix. The bipartite protein DNA interaction is found once in the CAD·ICAD heterodimer and is repeated twice in the active CAD homodimer (Fig. 7B). Our model explains the unusual capacity of CAD to form stable DNA complexes as a nonspecific nuclease on the structural level. We thank U. Konradi for expert technical assistance and G. H.
