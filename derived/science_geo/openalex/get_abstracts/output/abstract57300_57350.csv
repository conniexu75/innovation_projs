https://openalex.org/W1986161955,"THE action of growth hormone (GH) on skeletal tissue was proposed to be mediated through a secondary substance, described by the operational term “sulphation factor”1. The observations underlying this hypothesis have been amply confirmed and extended. A GH-dependent plasma factor stimulates in cartilage not only the incorporation of sulphate into chondroitin sulphate, but also the incorporation of thymidine into DNA2, proline into the hydroxyproline of collagen3 and uridine into RNA4. GH has substantially no in vitro effect on cartilage metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W1577561851,"A bacterial protein (host factor I) required for the replication of bacteriophage Qβ RNA in vitro has been purified from uninfected Escherichia coli to apparent homogeneity. When analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate the purified protein migrates as a single band with an apparent molecular weight of 12,500. The molecular weight of the active protein is approximately 75,000, suggesting a subunit structure composed of six polypeptide chains. RNA synthesis catalyzed by the Qβ RNA polymerase with Qβ RNA as template is completely dependent upon the presence of the purified protein. The concentration of factor required for the maximum rate of synthesis varies according to the amount of Qβ RNA added, but is independent of enzyme concentration. The stoichiometry of the reaction suggests that 1 molecule of factor is required per molecule of RNA. Binding of factor to several different types of single stranded RNA was demonstrated by zonal centrifugation; binding was not detected with double stranded reovirus RNA or with double or single stranded DNA. Studies on the role of factor in the reaction suggest that this host protein acts as a positive control element required at some step prior to the initiation of synthesis with Qβ RNA template."
https://openalex.org/W1560189124,"Abstract The shape of an Arrhenius plot of glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase activity of an unsaturated fatty acid auxotroph of Escherichia coli is identical in membranes containing cis-vaccenic, oleic, linoleic, or linolenic acid as sole unsaturated fatty acid. The curve is linear at low temperatures with a continuous decrease in slope above 15°. In membranes containing trans-unsaturated fatty acids as the sole unsaturated fatty acid, the decrease in slope occurs at 20°. Membranes from cells grown in the presence of oleic acid and then grown for one generation in the absence of unsaturated fatty acids contained 79% saturated fatty acids and 21% oleic acid. Temperature dependence of the enzyme activity in these membranes was intermediate between that observed in membranes containing trans-unsaturated fatty acids and those containing normal amounts of cis-unsaturated fatty acids. 1-Acylglycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase activity exhibited a linear Arrhenius plot identical in slope in membranes containing cis-unsaturated fatty acids of varying degrees of unsaturation. Membranes from cells deprived of unsaturated fatty acids for one generation or those containing trans-unsaturated fatty acids exhibited a steeper slope. Membranous glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity appeared to be independent of membrane fatty acid composition. Linear Arrhenius plots of identical slope were observed in all membrane preparations described above. The difference in the dependence of the temperature characteristics of various membranous enzymes on membrane fatty acid composition suggests a heterogeneity in the relationship between membranous enzymes and membrane phospholipids."

https://openalex.org/W1574118979,"Abstract The galactose-binding protein, a necessary component of a bacterical transport system, is shown by three independent methods to undergo a conformational change upon binding of substrate. 1. A Lineweaver-Burk plot of the binding data obtained by equilibrium dialysis at a protein concentration of 0.4 mg per ml shows heterogenous behavior. Extrapolation of the data at low galactose concentrations (10-8 to 3·10-7 m) yields an apparent Kdiss of 10-7 m and at higher galactose concentrations (3·10-7 to 10-5 m) an apparent Kdiss of 10-5 m. A Scatchard plot of the binding data extrapolated to high galactose concentrations indicates two binding sites per 36,000 molecular weight. 2. The presence of 10-4 m galactose during analytical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 8.4 results in a changed electrophoretic mobility of the binding protein. This change is also observed in the presence of 10-4 m glucose and 10-4 m (d-glyceryl)-1-β-d-galactopyranoside substrates of the transport system. Methyl-1-O-β-d-galactopyranoside, methyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at concentrations of 10-4 m do not cause the altered electrophoretic mobility. 3. The fluorescence of the protein is increased up to 13.5% in the presence of substrate between 310 to 350 nm when excited at 290 nm. The increase of fluorescence observed with galactose, glucose, and (d-glyceryl)-1-β-d-galactopyranoside occurs at half-maximal total sugar concentrations of 10-6, 10-6, and 10-5 m, respectively. The substrate-induced conformational change does not result in a change of the molecular weight of the protein as measured by high speed equilibrium centrifugation and sieve chromatography through Bio-Gel P-150. The conformational change of the protein cannot be observed by optical rotatory dispersion, circular dichroism, and infrared spectroscopy. These latter spectroscopic methods show, however, that the galactose-binding protein exists to a large extent in β conformation. Purified binding protein from a transport-negative mutant does not undergo the substrate-induced conformational changes measured by binding, electrophoretic mobility, and fluorescence."
https://openalex.org/W1627527341,"Abstract (Z)- and (E)-[3-3H]P-enolpyruvate were prepared from [1-3H]glucose and [1-3H]mannose with the glycolytic enzymes and were converted into shikimates tritiated at C-6 with non-labeled erythrose-4-P and cell-free extract of Escherichia coli mutant 83-24. Degradation to malate and analysis by the fumarase reaction showed that (Z)-[3-3H]P-enolpyruvate had produced [6-3H]shikimate of predominantly 6R configuration and the E isomer had given predominantly (6S)-[6-3H]shikimate. The DAHP synthetase reaction therefore is stereospecific with respect of C-3 of P-enolpyruvate, involving si attack at this center. As a consequence, the transient formation of a methyl group at C-3 of P-enolpyruvate as part of the reaction, as proposed by DeLeo and Sprinson ((1968) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 32, 873), is unlikely. Further conversion of (6R)- and (6S)-[6-3H]shikimate into chorismate showed that the pro-6R hydrogen is eliminated in this process. Thus, the 1,4-conjugate elimination of phosphoric acid in the chorismate synthetase reaction is anti, rendering a concerted (E2') mechanism unlikely."

When these are suspended in hypotonic buffer, the myelin swells and strips away from the axon. Axons are then separated from the myelin by centrifugation. The resulting preparation consists of a variable population of processes with lengths up to 200 micrometers and diameters between 0.3 and 5.0 micrometers. The axons contain neurofilaments and mitochondria, although no axolemma or neurotubules are evident. The preparation contains cerebroside and sulfatide, yet is essentially free of myelin."

At concentrations 100 times those used for experiments in vivo, cytochalasin B did not cause the breakdown of F-actin, did not inhibit the transformation of G-actin to F-actin, did not inhibit the binding of heavy meromyosin to F-actin, and did not inhibit the adenosine triphosphate-induced release of heavy meromyosin from F-actin."

https://openalex.org/W1535193651,"The synthesis of inducible catabolic enzyme systems was studied in Salmonella typhimurium strains defective in Enzyme I of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system. Sugar substrates of the phosphotransferase system repressed the synthesis of the enzyme systems required for the catabolism of melibiose, maltose, and glycerol (but not of several other sugars) and inhibited the corresponding permease systems. Kinetic experiments provided evidence for an interaction between the phosphotransferase system and the permease systems listed above. Inducer exclusion appears to be one of the factors involved in the repression of enzyme synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1589610172,"An improved procedure for the purification of T4 endonuclease IV from T4+-infected Escherichia coli cells is described. The enzyme preparations are highly concentrated, free of exonuclease contamination, and display about 200-fold greater activity toward single stranded DNA than toward duplex DNA. The limit product obtained by exhaustive digestion of single stranded DNA with endonuclease IV is 25% acid-soluble and consists of oligonucleotides with an average chain length of about 50 nucleotides. The enzyme may be useful in sequencing DNA. A second endonuclease which exhibits a preference for denatured DNA was also purified from T4+-infected E. coli cells and was named T4 endonuclease III. This enzyme is clearly distinguishable from T4 endonuclease IV on the basis of its chromatographic behavior. Furthermore, endonuclease III is able to act on denatured T4 DNA, whereas endonuclease IV does not; endonuclease III does not produce appreciable acid-soluble material from polydeoxycytidylate, whereas endonuclease IV does; and endonuclease III produces oligonucleotides whose 5′-terminal mononucleotides are not specific, whereas the oligonucleotides produced by endonuclease IV end exclusively in 5′-dCMP."

https://openalex.org/W1534923971,"Abstract The structural requirements for recognition between Tu-GTP and aminoacyl-tRNA have been studied with Escherichia coli Tu factor and purified E. coli valine tRNA. Cleavage of tRNAval at the anticodon into 2 half-molecules, followed by recombination and charging with valine, yielded a functional complex, showing that an intact anticodon is not necessary for Tu-GTP recognition. Testing of valyl-tRNA(3'), that is, valine esterified to only the 3' half of the molecule, showed that this structure was insufficient for reactivity, leading to the conclusion that recognition requires more structure than is provided by an aminoacylated 3' half-molecule. Cross-linking of the dihydrouridine-containing and amino acid acceptor arms by the covalent joining of 4-thiouridine and cytidine did not affect Tu-GTP recognition, showing that this constraint on conformation freedom also is not important."
https://openalex.org/W1524182795,"Abstract The template requirements of DNA polymerase II and the nature of the product formed in the polymerization reaction have been investigated. Native DNA or fully single stranded DNA support deoxynucleotide incorporation poorly. This activity is not improved by sonication or treatment of native DNA with micrococcal nuclease, Neurospora endonuclease, or low levels of deoxyribonuclease I. An excellent DNA template is produced by treatment of native DNA with exonuclease III or large amounts of DNase I. Neurospora endonuclease (an enzyme specific for single stranded DNA) converts these excellent templates into poor templates. These results indicate that DNA polymerase II requires a duplex structure with a single stranded region and a 3'-hydroxyl-terminated primer strand. Unlike DNA polymerase I, DNA polymerase II cannot utilize native DNA containing single stranded scissions as template. The product of DNA polymerase II action is double stranded DNA. Short single stranded regions, whether internal or terminal, are completely repaired. In contrast to this, longer single stranded regions are incompletely repaired while extensive single stranded regions are repaired poorly, if at all. The product of DNA polymerase II action is covalently attached to the primer DNA and no new strands are initiated. DNA polymerase II is capable of acting successively on more than one template molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1541632951,"Abstract The regulation of serine hydroxymethyltransferase has been investigated in Escherichia coli 113-3 (ATCC 11105). It was found that extracts from bacteria grown in the presence of low levels of methionine (or cyanocobalamin) showed a 2- to 18-fold increase in specific activity over extracts of organisms grown at high concentrations of these compounds. The addition of methionine or S-adenosylmethionine to the serine hydroxymethyltransferase assay mixture had no effect on the specific activity. This provides evidence against regulation via feedback inhibition. It appears that the biosynthesis of this enzyme is controlled by the level of methionine in the growth medium. Dihydrofolate reductase, thymidylate synthetase, and N5,N10-methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase were not affected by the methionine or cyanocobalamin level. Serine hydroxymethyltransferase was purified 49- to 70-fold from E. coli 113-3 grown in medium containing either low or high levels of methionine. The pH optimum, kinetic constants, and molecular weights were identical for the enzymes from both preparations. The molecular weight of serine hydroxymethyltransferase was found to be 170,000 which differs from that of the enzyme purified from rabbit liver."
https://openalex.org/W1606945924,"Abstract Deazanebularin, a cytotoxic nucleoside, is fluorescent at ambient temperature and at neutral pH. Some of its fluorescence properties and those of its phosphorylated derivatives are reported here. Deazanebularin nucleotides are substrates for Escherichia coli polynucleotide phosphorylase and RNA polymerase. With RNA polymerase deazanebularin triphosphate acts as an ambiguous substrate in that it functions, with almost equal efficiency, as an analogue of either ATP or GTP. The relevance of this observation to the mechanism of base selection by RNA polymerase is discussed. The synthesis, characterization, and properties of polymers containing deazanebularin are also described. Some of these polymers form unique ordered structures with base pairs possessing only a single hydrogen bond; these permit an assessment of the contribution of hydrogen bonding to helix stability. These polymers also exhibit some unusual fluorescence properties, including excited state energy transfer."

Of these tetraornithine, pentaornithine, diornithyllysine, ornithyllysylornithine, and alanyltriornithine have also been found to be inhibitory. Further studies with triornithine have shown the peptide to be bactericidal. The compound inhibits protein synthesis but does not affect nucleic acid synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1551470598,"Abstract Growth rate shifts have been induced in Escherichia coli (K12 Leu-, rel+) cells by a transition between glucose and succinate as carbon sources; by a transition between ammonium and glutamate as nitrogen sources; and by the metabolic inhibitors azide, cyanide, and dinitrophenol. Changes in nucleoside triphosphate levels during these shifts were analyzed, and in all instances were found to be inadequate to account fully for the observed preferential inhibition of stable RNA accumulation. This inadequacy was reinforced when the labeling kinetics of RNA and nucleoside triphosphates by either [33P]orthophosphate or [3H]uridine was found to be largely parallel, and therefore to rule against any significant compartmentation of nucleoside triphosphates in the cells. The inhibition of RNA accumulation also appeared not to be accompanied by changes in RNA polymerase activity."

Dermis from the sole of the foot or palm of the hand induces chick chorionic epithelium to form an epidermis that resembles chick rather than human epidermis. Chick epithelium, though it has the capacity to respond to a human dermal stimulus, is limited to forming chick-type tissue. The human dermis was modified in its turn by culture in combination with chick epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W1496850851,"Abstract The molecular weight of the T2r+ bacteriophage-induced deoxycytidylate deaminase was determined by sedimentation equilibrium to be 124,000 ± 1,800. Sedimentation of the enzyme in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride containing 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol yielded a homogeneous species with a molecular weight of 20,200 ± 100. Additional evidence that the enzyme is composed of six subunits, possibly identical, was obtained from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis studies before and after dimethyl suberimidate treatment and also by Sephadex G-200 chromatography. The molecular weight of the deaminase obtained by the latter procedure varied directly with the protein concentration; the lowest molecular weight approximated that of the monomer and the highest that of the hexamer. Intermediate values were considered weight average quantities resulting from the rapid equilibrium of monomer and hexamer. When deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate was included in the elution buffers, the concentration dependence of molecular weight was eliminated and only the hexamer was evident. Most of the data suggest that the hexamer is the active form of deoxycytidylate deaminase, but that conformation is also important as evidenced by the finding that 0.5 m guanidine hydrochloride can reduce the enzyme activity by 50% with little apparent change in the s20,w. Guanidine hydrochloride at concentrations of 1 m, however, effects an almost complete loss in activity accompanied by disaggregation of the enzyme protein to a form with an s20,w of 3.0. Studies on the rate and extent of deaminase reactivation following denaturation by 6 m guanidine hydrochloride reveal that the renaturation process is a complex function of many parameters."

https://openalex.org/W1598227607,"Abstract A continuous and unique variation of stable RNA accumulation with pool levels of nucleoside triphosphates was observed when Escherichia coli (K12 Leu-, rel+) cells were entering into phosphate starvation or recovering spontaneously from inhibition by dinitrophenol. Since the rate of RNA accumulation in these experimental systems surpassed all other known systems exhibiting the same pool levels of nucleoside triphosphates, it is suggested that stable RNA synthesis in these systems was subjected to kinetic regulation by substrate concentrations. This kinetic relationship in vivo between RNA synthesis and nucleoside triphosphate substrates was sigmoidal in character and exhibited a higher half-saturation constant than the similar relationship obtained with RNA polymerase in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1483617143,"Abstract The coding properties of triplets and polynucleotides containing 7-deazanebularin, a purine nucleoside analogue, have been studied in cell-free ribosomal systems. Polymers containing 7-deazanebularin stimulate ribosomal binding of aminoacyl-tRNA and polypeptide synthesis. The analogue residues show coding ambiguity in the binding tests, since they function as analogues of both adenine and guanine; however, they have so far been found to replace only adenine in directing amino acid incorporation. 7-Deazanebularin substitutes for adenine in all codon positions, showing that the formation of a total of three hydrogen bonds per codon suffices for incorporation of a single amino acid. Triplets containing 7-deazanebularin also stimulate aminoacyl-tRNA binding to ribosomes; in this test system 7-deazanebularin acts best, and perhaps exclusively as an analogue of adenine."
https://openalex.org/W2021225766,"Kanawati and McLaren have proposed that the ratio of midarm circumference to head circumference is a measure of marginal malnutrition1. Midarm circumference can indeed be used as a rapid and cheap indicator of severe protein–calorie malnutrition (PCM)2,3 if measurements can be compared with standards for children of the same age. But in many areas parents do not know the precise age of their children. In such cases, arm muscles mass, which reflects body protein status, may have to be appraised in community studies by comparison with body tissues which reflect age but which are less affected by PCM. These ratios are less precise than arm circumference related to age because the normal growth rates of the indirect parameters differ from that of arm circumference. They are also affected by nutritional status to some extent."
