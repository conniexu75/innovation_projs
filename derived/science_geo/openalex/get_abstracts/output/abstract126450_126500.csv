Antimicrobial peptides are emerging as participants in the defense system of epithelial barriers in general. Originally we isolated the human antimicrobial peptide LL-37 from granulocytes. The gene (CAMP or cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide) coding for this peptide belongs to the cathelicidin family, whose members contain a conserved pro-part of the cathelin type. The human genome seems to have only one gene of this family, whereas some mammalian species have several cathelicidin genes. In the present work we demonstrate up-regulation of this human cathelicidin gene in inflammatory skin disorders, whereas in normal skin no induction was found. By in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry the transcript and the peptide were located in keratinocytes throughout the epidermis of the inflammatory regions. In addition, the peptide was detected in partially pure fractions derived from psoriatic scales by immunoblotting. These fractions also exhibited antibacterial activity. We propose a protective role for LL-37, when the integrity of the skin barrier is damaged, participating in the first line of defense, and preventing local infection and systemic invasion of microbes."

VEGF caused a striking and transient increase in mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity and stimulated phospholipase C-γ tyrosine phosphorylation, but it had no effect on phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase activity. VEGF caused a marked increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of p125 focal adhesion kinase (p125FAK), which was both rapid and concentration-dependent. VEGF produced similar effects on p125FAK in the endothelial cell line ECV.304. VEGF stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the 68-kDa focal adhesion-associated component, paxillin, with similar kinetics and concentration dependence to that for p125FAK. Thrombin and the phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, also increased p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation in HUVECs. The effect of VEGF on p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation was completely inhibited by the actin filament-disrupting agent cytochalasin D and was partially inhibited by the protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X. Inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway using a specific inhibitor of MAP kinase kinase had no effect on p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. VEGF stimulated migration and actin stress fiber formation in confluent HUVEC, and VEGF-induced p125FAK/paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation was accompanied by increased immunofluorescent staining of p125FAK, paxillin, and phosphotyrosine in focal adhesions in confluent cultures of HUVECs. These findings identify p125FAK and paxillin as components in a VEGF-stimulated signaling pathway and suggest a novel mechanism for VEGF regulation of endothelial cell functions.

The endothelium lining the lumen of all blood vessels plays essential roles in the development and the function of the vasculature. It is central to angiogenesis, the maintenance of vascular tone and of vascular permeability, and is also involved in several disease states, particularly atherosclerosis and other vasculoproliferative disorders (1Karnovsky M.J.

Administration of VEGF protein and VEGF gene transfer inhibit intimal thickening following balloon angioplasty and improve blood flow in ischemic limbs, effects mediated through stimulation of endothelial cell regrowth and angiogenesis, respectively (18Asahara T.

Cardiovascular Res. 1994; 28: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that VEGF may play a role in neovascularization of the advanced atherosclerotic plaque (10Shweiki D.

VEGF exhibits high affinity binding to two distinct protein tyrosine kinase receptors, the fms-like tyrosine kinase Flt-1 and KDR, the human homologue of Flk-1. Both receptors possess insert sequences within their catalytic domains and seven immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular regions and are related to the PDGF family of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases (24de Vries C.

Although expression of both VEGF receptor types occurs in adult endothelial cells including HUVECs, recent findings suggest that KDR and not Flt-1 is able to mediate the mitogenic and chemotactic effects of VEGF in endothelial cells (28Millauer B.

The key targets for either VEGF receptor that mediate VEGF's diverse biological functions in endothelial cells remain incompletely understood, and to date studies of the downstream effectors and targets for the VEGF receptor have yielded varying results (29Waltenberger J.

Oncogene. 1995; 10: 135-147PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, VEGF has been reported to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ, of p120GAP, and of the Src homology 2 domain protein Nck in bovine aortic endothelial cells (30Guo D. Jia Q. Song H-Y. Warren R.S. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6729-6733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), while in porcine aortic endothelial cells transfected with KDR and Flt-1, VEGF had no effect on PLC-γ tyrosine phosphorylation or PI 3-kinase activity and only a weak effect on p120GAP tyrosine phosphorylation (29Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its mitogenic effects in endothelial cells, VEGF also promotes the migration of endothelial cells, and it is increasingly recognized that endothelial cell migration plays an essential role in angiogenesis and vascular modeling (29Waltenberger J.

It has recently been demonstrated that p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation is regulated by growth factor ligands for receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, including PDGF-BB, a potent chemoattractant for vascular smooth muscle cells (45Rankin S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 31807-31813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). P125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation is also stimulated by other chemoattractants including hyaluronan and the T-lymphocyte chemokine, RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell-expressed) (48Hall C.L. Wang C. Lange L.A. Turley E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 575-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 49Bacon K.B. Szabo M.C. Yssel H. Bolen J.B. Schall T.J. J. Exp.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK is associated in several cell types with that of paxillin, a 68-kDa protein that co-localizes to focal adhesions (45Rankin S. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 704-710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,49Bacon K.B. Szabo M.C. Yssel H. Bolen J.B. Schall T.J. J. Exp.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 333-342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Paxillin has been reported to associate with p125FAK and is a putative substrate for p125FAK(53Tachibana K. Sato T. D'Avirro N. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1089-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 54Turner C.E. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 637-645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further evidence for the role of p125FAK in cell migration has come from studies in knockout mice and from overexpression. Murine p125FAK knockout embryos displayed disorganized mesenchymal tissue architecture, and embryonic mesodermal fibroblasts deficient in p125FAK exhibited a decreased rate of cell movement compared with wild-type cells (55Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Aizawa S. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). Overexpression of p125FAK in Chinese hamster ovary cells was found to be associated with increased cell migration (56Cary L.A. Chang J.F. Guan J-L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of p125FAK in endothelial cell signal transduction pathways stimulated by VEGF is unknown. In the present paper, we investigated the tyrosine phosphorylation events stimulated by VEGF in human endothelial cells including p125FAK and paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation. We report here that tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK and paxillin are rapid events in the signal transduction pathways stimulated by VEGF, which may play a role in the migratory cell response to this factor. HUVECs were obtained from Clonetics and were routinely cultured in the manufacturer's own medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum. For experimental purposes, primary cultures of HUVECs were dispersed by treatment with 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA for 5 min at 37 °C and then replated in either 90- or 35-mm plastic dishes. Cultures were maintained in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% C02 and 90% air at 37 °C. For experimental purposes, cells were plated either in 33-mm Nunc Petri dishes at 105 cells/dish, or in 90-mm dishes at 2.5 × 105 cells/dish and used after 6–8 days or when the cells had formed a confluent monolayer. In some experiments, cells were rendered quiescent by incubation with M199 medium containing 1% FCS and without other supplements for 24 h. The human endothelial cell line ECV.304 (57Takahashi K. Sawasaki Y. Hata J-I. Mukai K. Goto T. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1990; 25: 265-274Crossref Scopus (417) Google Scholar) was maintained and propagated in M199 medium supplemented with 10% FCS. For some experiments, aortic medial VSMC were cultured from rabbit aortas by the tissue explant method as described (46Abedi H. Dawes K.E. Zachary I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11367-11376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). VSMC were grown to confluence in DMEM containing 20% FCS and were rendered quiescent by incubation for 40 h in DMEM containing 0.5% FCS. Cell migration was measured in a modified Boyden chemotaxis chamber (NeuroProbe Inc., Cabin John, MD) essentially as described (46Abedi H. Dawes K.E. Zachary I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11367-11376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Test chemoattractants were diluted in DMEM supplemented with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and placed in the bottom wells of the chamber. Polycarbonate filters with 8-μm pores (Polyfiltronics) were preincubated in a 0.1% solution of collagen type I (Sigma) and placed between the chemoattractants and the upper chambers. Cells were trypsinized and washed twice in M199 and resuspended in M199 containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin to give a final cell concentration of 3 × 105/ml. 15,000 cells were placed into each well in the upper chamber, and the chemotaxis chambers were routinely incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. After the incubation, unmigrated cells were removed from the upper side of the filters, and migrated cells were stained with Pro-Diff (Braidwood Laboratories, Beckenham, Kent, UK). Filters were mounted onto microscope slides, and stained cells were counted at × 200 magnification in four fields/well. In each individual experiment, chemotaxis was performed in four separate wells for each concentration of a given test substance under a specified condition. Eachn value in the figure legends refers to the number of individual experiments. Quiescent cultures of cells (approximately 106/immunoprecipitation) were washed twice with M199 medium, treated with peptide factors in 1 ml of this medium as indicated, and lysed at 4 °C in 1 ml of a solution containing 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1% Triton X-100 (lysis buffer). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min and precleared by incubation with albumin-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. After removal of albumin-agarose by brief (10-s) centrifugation, the supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitations were routinely performed by incubating lysates with 1 μg/ml antibody as indicated for 3 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were collected either by incubating lysates with protein A-agarose beads for a further 1 h or by incubating with 5 μg/lysate anti-mouse IgG for 1 h followed by a 1-h incubation with protein A-agarose beads. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, and proteins were extracted with 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Phosphotyrosyl proteins were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Tyr(P) mAb Py20. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and further analyzed by Western blotting. Treatments of quiescent cultures of cells with factors, cell lysis, and immunoprecipitations were performed as described above. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore Corp.). Membranes were blocked using 5% nonfat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, and incubated for 3–5 h in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween-20 containing either anti-Tyr(P) or protein-specific antibodies (1 μg/ml of each) as indicated. Immunoreactive bands were visualized either by chemiluminescence using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG and ECL™ reagent or using125I-labeled sheep anti-mouse IgG or protein A as indicated. PI 3-kinase was determined by measuring phosphatidylinositol phosphorylation in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates as described (58Zachary I. Gil J. Lehmann W. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E.

Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, once in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and once in PI 3-kinase assay buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA). Immunoprecipitates were preincubated in 25 μl of PI 3-kinase assay buffer and 10 μl of phosphatidylinositol for 20 min at 4 °C. In some experiments, inhibitors of PI 3-kinase were also added to immunoprecipitates for this preincubation period. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 15 μl of assay mixture containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 100 μmATP, and 10 mm MgCl2, and incubations were routinely performed for 10 min at room temperature. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 1 n HCl followed by the addition of 200 μl of a 1:1 mix of CHCl3 and methanol. Samples were vortexed for 20 s, and the phases were separated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 2 min. The lower CHCl3 phase was collected and washed with 80 μl of a 1:1 mix of 1 n HCl and methanol, and the phases were separated by centrifugation as before. The lower phase was collected and applied to LK6D6 silica gel TLC plates (Whatman), which had been presprayed with 1% potassium oxalate and allowed to dry prior to sample application. TLC plates were routinely developed for 45 min using a 29.2:180:10.8:140 mixture of H2O, CHCl3, NH4OH, and methanol, respectively. Developed TLC plates were dried and exposed to x-ray film for 1–3 days. Cells were treated with factors as indicated, washed rapidly twice with ice-cold PBS, and immediately extracted by the addition of 100 μl of boiling 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Cell extracts were collected by scraping, heated to 95 °C for 10 min, and run on 12.5% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gels. Following transfer to Immobilon membranes, proteins were immunoblotted with an antibody that specifically recognizes p42 and p44 MAP kinases (extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2) activated by phosphorylation at Tyr204 (60Payne D.M. Rossomondo A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K. Her J.H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). HUVECs were cultured on glass coverslips and allowed to grow to confluence. Following treatments, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and then fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and then washed three times in PBS. Fixed and permeabilized cells were incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times in PBS, and then incubated for 45 min at room temperature with a secondary antibody conjugated to FITC. Cells were finally washed three times (5 min each wash) in PBS. Coverslips were mounted onto microscope slides using Vectashield mounting medium. Filamentous actin was stained with FITC-phalloidin in PBS (1 μg/ml) for 20 min at room temperature. Immunofluorescent staining was observed and photographed using a Zeiss Axiophot epifluorescence microscope fitted with a × 63 (numerical aperture 1.4, oil) objective lens. Recombinant VEGF was obtained either from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. or from R & D Systems. Cytochalasin D was from Sigma. Wortmannin was obtained either from Cambridge Bioscience or from Sigma, and PD98059 was obtained from Calbiochem. The BC3 polyclonal antibody to p125FAK was a gift of Professor Thomas Parsons (University of Virginia). Py20 anti-Tyr(P) mAb and mAbs to p125FAK, paxillin, Pyk2, p85α, and PLC-γ were from Transduction Laboratories, Inc. 4G10 anti-Tyr(P) mAb was from TCS biologicals Ltd. Antibody to the activated phosphorylated form of p42/p44 MAP kinase was purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. The U13 antibody to p85α was a gift of Mike Waterfield (Ludwig Institute of Cancer Research, London). PDGF-BB, Protein A-agarose, goat anti-rabbit IgG, and goat anti-mouse IgG were from Oncogene Science, Inc. ECL™ reagents and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were from Amersham, UK. All other reagents used were of the purest grade available. Treatment of cultured HUVECs stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple protein bands as detected by anti-Tyr(P) blots of anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitation. The major bands phosphorylated were of M r 205,000, 185,000, 145,000, 125,000, 100,000, and 68,000 (Fig. 1). The predicted molecular mass of both KDR and Flt-1 VEGF receptors is approximately 150 kDa, but due to glycosylation of the extracellular domain, these proteins characteristically migrate in SDS-PAGE gels as bands of M r 205,000. The effects of VEGF on PI 3-kinase activity, MAP kinase activation, and PLC-γ tyrosine phosphorylation were subsequently investigated. VEGF induced neither tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85α PI 3-kinase subunit as judged by immunoblot of anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitates with a specific p85α mAb (results not shown) nor an increase in PI 3-kinase activity measured in parallel anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitates (Fig.2 A). VEGF also failed to increase PI 3-kinase activity measured in immunoprecipitates prepared with a specific anti-p85α antibody (results not shown). It was verified in parallel assays that PDGF-BB induced PI 3-kinase activity in VSMC as measured either in anti-Tyr(P) or anti-p85α immunoprecipitates (Fig.2 A and results not shown). We also examined whether VEGF activated the MAP kinase cascade, a convergent pathway in the action of many growth factors.

In this model, RNA extension is carried out by a mobile catalytic center that, at certain DNA sites, advances within stationary RNA polymerase. This idea emerged from the observation that footprints of individual elongation complexes, haltedin vitro at consecutive DNA positions, can remain fixed on the template for several contiguous nucleotide additions. Here, we examine in detail the structural transitions that occur immediately after the enzyme stops at sites where discontinuous advancement of RNA polymerase is observed. We demonstrate that halting at such special sites does not “freeze” RNA polymerase at one location but induces it to leave its initial position and to slide backward along the DNA and the RNA without degrading the transcript. The resulting loss of contact between the RNA 3′-hydroxyl and the enzyme's catalytic center leads to temporary loss of the catalytic activity. This process is equilibrated with enzyme return to the original location, so that RNA polymerase is envisaged as an oscillating object switching between catalytically active and inactive states. The retreated isoform constitutes a principal intermediate in factor-induced endonucleolytic RNA cleavage. These oscillations of RNA polymerase can explain its apparent discontinuous advancement, which had been interpreted as indicating flexibility within the enzyme.

Ternary elongation complexes consisting of RNA polymerase (RNAP), 1The abbreviations used are: RNAP, RNA polymerase; EC, elongation complex; ExoIII, exonuclease III; RNase T1, ribonuclease T1; nt, nucleotide(s); NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. DNA, and nascent RNA are the essential structures for transcription regulation in both pro- and eukaryotes. Distinct properties of these complexes determine the response of RNAP to pausing and termination signals and to the action of regulatory factors (1Spencer C.A. Groudine M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 777-785PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kerpolla T. Kane C.M. FASEB J. 1992; 5: 2833-2842Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 3Chan C.L. Landick R. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Transcription: Mechanisms and Regulation. Raven Press, New York1994: 297-321Google Scholar). The traditional view of the process of transcription has been based on thermodynamic analysis and structural studies of diverse populations of elongation complexes. The entire RNAP molecule was considered to translocate along the template monotonously as each new nucleotide was added to the RNA (4Yager T.D. von Hippel P. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 1241-1275Google Scholar). However, DNA footprinting studies of ternary complexes stopped at one point along the sequence revealed that at certain short sequence intervals, RNAP appeared to remain fixed on the template while the RNA chain increased a few nucleotides in length, leading to a relative contraction of the distance in nucleotides between the 3′ RNA terminus and the front end footprint of RNAP on the DNA (5Krummel B.

A. 1995; 92: 1739-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These special sites where contraction occurs are associated with an increased sensitivity of the RNA near the 3′ end to endonucleolytic cleavage by factor GreB (SII in eukaryotes) and with a predisposition for collapse of the ternary complex into a nonproductive or “arrested” state from which polymerase neither transcribes RNA nor dissociates (7Chamberlin M.J. Harvey Lect. 1995; 88: 1-21Google Scholar, 8Nudler E. Goldfarb A. Kashlev M. Science. 1994; 265: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 9Nudler E. Kashlev M. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1995; 81: 351-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Re-establishment of the catalytic competence of the arrested complexes requires cleavage of the RNA by Gre factors (5Krummel B. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol.

Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12874-12885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This unusual capability of RNAP to synthesize RNA within the stationary enzyme was recently shown to participate in transcription pausing and termination (9Nudler E. Kashlev M. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1995; 81: 351-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 10Wang D. Meier T. Chan C.L. Feng G. Lee D.N. Landick R. Cell. 1995; 81: 341-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To account for the perplexing way elongation and discontinuous movement of RNAP are coupled, an “inchworming” model based on the idea of structural transitions in enzyme consisting of flexibly connected parts was developed (3Chan C.L. Landick R. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Transcription: Mechanisms and Regulation. Raven Press, New York1994: 297-321Google Scholar, 6Krummel B. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol.

Cell. 1993; 72: 459-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In this model, at specific DNA sites RNA chain elongation, carried out by a mobile catalytic center advancing within the fixed enzyme, alternates with threading of the transcript through the RNAP in concert with the forward translocation of the enzyme on the DNA. If the translocation goes awry, the catalytic center is supposed to become disengaged from the RNA 3′ terminus and to slide backward within the fixed enzyme, thus causing arrest of elongation. Cleavage of the transcript is thought to return the complex to the active state by producing an appropriate 3′-OH group near the new position of the catalytic center. Thus, the inchworming model was the first insight into detailed structure of elongation complexes, which was shown to depend on a particular sequence which RNAP transcribes. However, the inchworming model is based solely on data obtained when RNAP is stalled, raising the possibility that such ternary complexes are not necessarily related to the structure of true intermediates in RNA chain extension (6Krummel B. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 7Chamberlin M.J. Harvey Lect. 1995; 88: 1-21Google Scholar, 15Kashlev M. Nudler E. Goldfarb A. Wight T. Kutter E. Cell. 1993; 75: 147-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Indeed, some approaches do reveal differences between stopped and moving RNAP. Transiently halted RNAP is distinguished by bacteriophage T4 factor Alc, since the factor to loses its capacity to terminate host transcription in the presence of low concentration of NTPs (15Kashlev M. Nudler E. Goldfarb A. Wight T. Kutter E. Cell. 1993; 75: 147-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, kinetic studies of nucleotide misincorporation by Escherichia coli RNAP suggest that a reduced rate of transcription elongation causes a switching between active and inactive conformations at each DNA position (16Erie D. Hajiseyedjavadi O. Young M. von Hippel P. Science. 1993; 262: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Similar conformational changes were proposed for eukaryotic elongation; mathematical modeling of RNA chain growth desynchronization implied that yeast RNAP III may flip between a “fast-step” state and a “slow-step” state at each nucleotide of the template (17Matsuzaki H. Kassavetis G. Geiduschek E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1173-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The most apparent consequence of halting of transcription is the aforementioned arrest of RNAP in sites where unimpeded elongation would proceed normally (5Krummel B. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 8Nudler E. Goldfarb A. Kashlev M. Science. 1994; 265: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 9Nudler E. Kashlev M.

Biol. 1990; 213: 79-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Using a combination of DNA and RNA footprinting technique, we recently demonstrated that the loss of catalytic activity during arrest is accompanied by an isomerization of the ternary complex; the RNAP disengages from the 3′ end of the transcript and moves backward along the DNA, while the intact RNA threads through the enzyme leaving its 3′ end free (32Komissarova N. Kashlev M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1755-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that RNAP may adopt multiple conformations, only one of which needs to be capable of forming a phosphodiester bond. The goal of the present study was to examine in detail the structural transitions that occur immediately after the enzyme stops at sites where discontinuous advancement of RNAP is observed. A combination of approaches, including DNA and RNA footprinting with fast-acting chemical and enzymatic agents and time-resolved correlation of catalytic function and structural parameters, were used. It was revealed that at these sites RNAP repeatedly switches between inactive and active states as it moves back and forth using the DNA and RNA as tracks. The observations give rise to a new interpretation of the discontinuous phase of elongation. The standard template for transcription was the purified on PAGE polymerase chain reaction-amplified 386-base pair DNA fragment carrying the T7A1 promoter.

A, EC56 gradually loses catalytic activity, which depends on the strength of the RNA/DNA pairing near the 3′ end of the transcript. EC54 prepared by walking with RNAP was chased to position 56 with 30 μm GTP (lanes 1–7) or with 300 μm ITP (lanes 9 and 10), for the indicated time periods. The fraction of EC56 unable to continue elongation was then visualized by adding 5 μm ATP and UTP for 5 s. The probe oflane 8 was then washed with cold transcription buffer (indicated by asterisk). All these and further procedures were performed at 16 °C, unless otherwise indicated. B, the loss of catalytic activity is specific for halted EC56. EC58 (lane 2) and EC60 (lane 3) were obtained from RNA labeled EC54 and EC58, respectively, by incubating with 5 μmsubsets of NTPs for 5 s. C, restoration of the catalytic function in EC56. The fraction of RNA labeled EC56 unable to resume elongation after 10 min of halting was purified by chasing with 500 μm each of all four NTPs for 2 min (lane 1). After washing off the NTPs, 5 μm ATP and UTP were added for indicated periods of time in either regular transcription buffer or in transcription buffer containing 300 mm KCl. All procedures were performed at 25 °C. D, potassium permanganate DNA footprinting of EC56 and of the neighboring complexes. Top panel, EC54, obtained on the DNA labeled at 5′ end of the nontemplate strand, was incubated with 100 μm GTP or 300 μm ITP (56(I)) for indicated periods of time before adding potassium permanganate. After 2 s the reaction was stopped with β-mercaptoethanol and the DNA was cleaved with piperidine at 90 °C. EC50, EC54, and EC57 were footprinted after 10 min of halting.

Martin E. Polyakov A. Severinov K. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1993; 130: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Stable ternary complexes stalled at position 11 were obtained by preincubating 2 pmol of the template with 2 pmol of the immobilized enzyme in transcription buffer (TB; 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 40 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 5 min at 37 °C and subsequently adding 5 μm tetraribonucleotide primer CpApUpC and 25 μm both ATP and GTP for 5 min at 25 °C. The complex was then walked to a desired position by repeated alterations of washing (five cycles of centrifugation and resuspension of the resin pellet in 1 ml of fresh TB) and chain extension (incubation with a subset of NTPs (5 μm each) for 3 min at 25 °C in 100 μl of TB). The transcripts were labeled by incorporation of [α-32P]NTP (DuPont NEN, 40 μCi of the labeled NTP (3000 Ci/mmol), 5 min at 25 °C). For the experiments of Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 5, all ternary complexes were labeled by incorporating [α-32P]CTP into position 12, followed by “walking” of the enzyme to the desired site.Figure 5The effect of oligonucleotides on the position of the front edge of RNAP on the template and on GreB-induced cleavage in EC80 and EC27.

In this and further experiments, reactions were stopped with the gel loading buffer (50 mm EDTA, 10 m urea) and the products were separated on 6% denaturing PAGE, unless specified otherwise. The DNA template for KMnO4 and ExoIII footprinting was labeled in 10 μl of immobilized EC20 with 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and 50 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (7000 Ci/mmol; ICN Biomedicals, Inc.) in an exchange reaction for 10 min at 25 °C, and the complex was used as starting material for the walking reaction. The labeled complexes were treated with 10 mmKMnO4 at 16 °C. The reaction was stopped after 2 s by adding 1 μl of β-mercaptoethanol. The complexes were eluted from Ni-NTA-agarose with 50 mm EDTA; the DNA in the supernatants was precipitated in the presence of 4 μg of the carrier plasmid DNA, cleaved with 10% piperidine for 15 min at 90 °C, reprecipitated, lyophilized, dissolved in gel loading buffer, and separated on 6% denaturing PAGE. 10 μl of the immobilized labeled complex was incubated with either 1 unit of the ExoIII (New England Biolabs) for 10 min at 25 °C or with 100 units of the nuclease for 5 min at 16 °C (as specified in figure legends). 10 μl of immobilized EC52–58 labeled by incorporating [α-32P]ATP in position 51 of the transcripts, and then “walked” to the desired position, were incubated for 10 min with 10 units of RNase T1 (Sigma) at 25 °C. The cleavage was stopped by adding 3 μl of phenol, the products were dissolved in the gel loading buffer and separated on 20% denaturing PAGE. GreB protein was purified as described (14Borukhov S. Sagitov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1993; 72: 459-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The cleavage reaction was performed in 10 μl of TB under conditions specified in the figure legends. The 56-nt transcript subjected to the treatment with GreB was labeled in both 12C and 54U positions, which allowed visualization of both 5′ and 3′ products of cleavage. The immobilized EC halted at positions 27, 56, or 80 were obtained from EC26, EC54, and EC75, respectively, as described above in the presence or absence of 200 μmspecific oligonucleotide at 16 °C for 10 min. The nonhybridized oligonucleotides were then removed by washing five times with 1 ml of ice-cold TB. 10 μl of each sample were then treated with ExoIII, GreB, or NTPs as described above or specified in figure legends. To melt the oligonucleotides off the RNA, the samples were incubated 5 min at 37 °C, washed once with warm (37 °C) and four times with cold TB and then the assays were performed as described above. In this work a solid-phase transcription system exploiting hexahistidine-tagged RNAP from E. coli immobilized on Ni-NTA-agarose beads was employed. The method allows one to obtain elongation complexes stalled at any site of the DNA by alternating limited RNA extension with washing of the beads (8Nudler E. Goldfarb A. Kashlev M. Science. 1994; 265: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 9Nudler E. Kashlev M. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A.

Gene ( Amst. ). 1993; 130: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We focused our study on the complex halted in position 56 of a template containing the T7A1 promoter (EC56). EC56 represents the discontinuous phase of elongation (8Nudler E. Goldfarb A. Kashlev M. Science. 1994; 265: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A fraction of EC56complexes fails to resume transcription after the addition of the missing NTP (in this case ATP), which in our previous study was interpreted as arrested state formation (8Nudler E. Goldfarb A. Kashlev M. Science. 1994; 265: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Indeed, the fraction of EC56 not responding to 5 s incubation with 5 μm ATP and UTP retains the RNA after washing of the beads, which rules out the dissociation of the complex (Fig.1 A, lanes 7 and 8; see also Ref. 8Nudler E. Goldfarb A. Kashlev M. Science. 1994; 265: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The unimpeded elongation through position 56 as well as the halting of transcription in the neighboring positions 54, 58, and 60 do not reveal any inactivation of RNAP in the same test (Fig.1 B). Lanes 1–7 of Fig. 1 A disclose a distinctive feature of EC56 inactivation; within the first 2 min of the halted state, the complex loses its catalytic competence gradually, but then the inactive fraction maintains a constant value. It is important to notice that the incorporation of ITP instead of GTP in two 3′-terminal positions of the RNA, which weakened the Watson-Crick pairing of the transcript terminus with the template, dramatically increased the rate of catalytic inactivation of EC56 (Fig. 1 A, lanes 9 and10). Unexpectedly, the inactive EC56 turned out to be able to re-enter elongation directly upon incubation with NTPs, bypassing internal cleavage of the transcript. In the experiment shown in Fig. 1 C, the fraction of EC56 capable of RNA extension was removed by a 2-min chase with 500 μm each of all four NTPs. After removal of the substrates, the rest of the complex (lane 1) was incubated with 5 μm each of ATP and UTP. As can be seen from lanes 2–4, the remaining EC56 slowly resumes transcription. The rate of NTP addition substantially increased in high salt (lane 5), but it is still far below that in the unimpeded elongation. However, prolonged incubation with the NTPs ultimately leads to complete reactivation of the complex. The omission of GTP from the added NTPs rules out participation of internal RNA cleavage in the activation, since the 3′-terminal nucleotide in EC56 is guanine. Here and in all further experiments involving halted EC56 and all other ternary complexes, the 3′-terminal labeling of the transcripts was used to exclude the possibility that shortening of the RNA was responsible for all observed effects of halting (data not shown). Below, the inactivated form of EC56 is defined as temporarily arrested on account of the remarkable reversibility of the inactivation, to distinguish it from irreversible arrest described elsewhere (20Markovtsov V. Mustaev A. Goldfarb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3221-3226Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 32Komissarova N. Kashlev M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1755-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Thus, the fact that after 2 min of halting no further net change in the system occurs reflects an equilibrium between the active and inactive forms. After removal of the active fraction by incubating with NTPs, the equilibrium soon restores at the level typical for halted EC56 (compare lane 7 in Fig.1 A with lane 2 in Fig. 1 C). Because of the extremely brief appearance of the fully active form of EC56(Fig. 1 A), a fast acting footprinting agent was employed to examine the structural difference between the active and the temporarily arrested isoforms. GTP was added to EC54 to synthesize EC56 which completed in 2 s. After different periods of time following the addition of GTP (ranging from 2 s to 5 min), the complex was exposed for 2 s to potassium permanganate, which allowed visualization of the transcriptional bubble by modifying single-stranded pyrimidine residues of the nontemplate DNA strand. Lanes 3 and 4 of Fig. 1 D show that within the first 10 s after the halting, the leading edge of the bubble in EC56 occupies a position 1–3 nucleotides downstream of the 3′ tip of the RNA, corresponding to the normal location for the bubble in the majority of the complexes tested so far (11Zaychikov E. Denissova L. Heumann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1739-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, while the halted state is maintained, the bubble steadily shifts backward to a position similar to that in EC50 (lanes 1 and 5–9). In the control experiment, RNA in EC56 was labeled at the 3′ end by incorporating [α-32P]GTP to positions 55 and 56 of the transcript. This labeled fraction maintained a constant value during 10 min of incubation of the complex at room temperature, which excluded the possibility that backward shift of the bubble was caused by shortening of the RNA in the complex (data not shown). Remarkably, the translocation of the bubble in EC56 coincides in time with the RNAP inactivation both ceasing at about 2 min after the halting. The substitution of two 3′-terminal guanosines with inosines in the RNA increased the rate of bubble isomerization (lane 10) in accord with the much higher rate of inactivation of inosine-substituted EC56 (Fig. 1 A, lane 9). The transcriptional bubbles in EC50 and EC57, which we took as representative of the monotonous mode of transcription, have the normal locations relative to the 3′ ends of their transcripts (lanes 1 and 11). The irreversible arrest of E. coli RNAP is associated with a similar retreat of the transcriptional bubble, which involves backward sliding of the whole enzyme along the DNA (32Komissarova N. Kashlev M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1755-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). We suggested that an analogous retreat of RNAP accompanies the appearance of the temporarily arrested form. But, in our previous report (8Nudler E. Goldfarb A. Kashlev M. Science. 1994; 265: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), the mapping of protection of the nontemplate DNA strand using 3′ to 5′ degradation with ExoIII did not discriminate between the active and inactive isoforms of EC56 and detected only a single position of the enzyme front edge coinciding with that in EC50. Nevertheless, the recently reported ability of the processive exonuclease to push RNAP upstream may have eliminated the footprint of the active form (9Nudler E. Kashlev M. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1995; 81: 351-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 10Wang D. Meier T. Chan C.L. Feng G. Lee D.N. Landick R. Cell. 1995; 81: 341-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Our own preliminary results also showed that prolonged incubation of some ECs with ExoIII led to the catalytic inactivation of RNAP without dissociating it from template. These observations, taken together, suggested that ExoIII may affect both structure of ternary complex and catalytic activity of RNAP. 3N. Komissarova and M. Kashlev, unpublished results. To weaken these side effects of ExoIII, in the present study we carried out the footprinting at a lower temperature, which was shown to decrease ExoIII processivity and was believed to eliminate “pushing” activity of the exonuclease (21Roger S. Weiss B. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). At 16 °C ExoIII does reveal an additional front end footprint in EC56, located 6 nucleotides downstream from the position observed previously at room temperature (lane 3 of Fig.2, top panel). We designate this new downstream boundary “regular” to highlight that in EC56it is located at the same distance from the 3′ tip of the RNA as in the majority of the complexes, which advance monotonously along the template, and we term the previously identified boundary “retarded” to underline that it does not move with the growth of the transcript from 50 to 56 nucleotides. However, it cannot be completely excluded that RNAP itself acquires slightly different conformation at different temperatures, which may affect front end footprint of EC56in a similar way. The following experiment proves that the appearance of the regular boundary is explained by the presence of a distinct catalytically competent isoform of EC56 rather than by the partial protection of the DNA by RNAP. EC56 was incubated for different periods of time with the subset of NTPs all"
https://openalex.org/W1993695011,"A novel subunit of the γ-aminobutyrate, type A (GABAA) receptor family has been identified in human and rat tissues. The subunit displays 30–40% amino acid identity with known family members and represents a distinct subunit class (termed π). Transcripts of the π subunit were detected in several human tissues and were particularly abundant in the uterus. The π subunit protein can assemble with known GABAA receptor subunits and confer unique ligand binding properties to the recombinant receptors in which it combines. Most notably, the presence of the π subunit alters the sensitivity of recombinant receptors to the endogenous steroid, pregnanolone.

In mammalian brain, synaptic inhibition of neuronal activity is mediated mainly by γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) 1The abbreviations used are: GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; GABAA, γ-aminobutyric acid, type A; EST, expressed sequence tag.1The abbreviations used are: GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; GABAA, γ-aminobutyric acid, type A; EST, expressed sequence tag. at GABAA receptors. In mammals, the 14 known subtypes of GABAA receptor subunits have been categorized within five structural classes (α1–6, β1–3, γ1–3, δ, ε). These subunits are thought to assemble in different pentameric complexes, with most functional receptors containing α/β/(γ, δ, or ε) subunit combinations (1Macdonald R.L. Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 569-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar, 2Whiting P.J. McKernan R.M. Wafford K.A. Int. Rev.

A sixth class of subunit (ρ) form homomeric GABA receptors that do not appear to coexist with GABAA receptor subunits and correspond pharmacologically to a related (GABAC) receptor subtype (4Cutting G.R. Lu L. O'Hara B.F. Kasch L.M. Montrose-Rafizadeh C. Donovan D.M. Shimada S. Antonarakis S.E. Guggino W.B. Uhl G.R. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition to their location on central neurons and astroglia, functional GABAA receptors have been detected on peripheral neurons and non-neuronal cells. The non-neuronal cells include endocrine cells of the pituitary pars intermedia, adrenal medulla, islets of Langerhans, and placenta (6Demeneix B.A. Taleb O. Loeffler J.P. Feltz P. Neuroscience. 1986; 17: 1275-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 7Bormann J. Clapham D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The receptors have also been located on smooth muscle cells of the urinary bladder and uterus (10Erdo S.L. Mione M.C. Amenta F. Wolff J.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 96: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar,11Amenta F. Cavallotti C. Ferrante F. Erdo S.L. Pharmacol. Res. Commun. 1988; 20: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The precise function of GABAA receptors in non-neuronal cells is presently ill-defined. Clearly, their location on endocrine cells suggests a role in the regulation of hormone secretion. However, their function in the uterus appears to be related directly to tissue contractility. Within the uterus, GABA, and its metabolic enzymes are found at high concentrations (12Erdo S.L. Villanyi P. Laszlo A. Life Sci. 1989; 44: 2009-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The GABAA receptors of this tissue have been proposed to regulate uterine motility by inhibiting contractions (13Majewska M.D. Vaupel D.B. J. Endocrinol. 1991; 131: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). They may also mediate the relaxing effects of 5α,3α-pregnanolone, an endogenous steroid that is capable of activating GABAA receptors directly (13Majewska M.D. Vaupel D.B. J. Endocrinol. 1991; 131: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,14Putnam C.D. Brann D.W. Kolbeck R.C. Mahesh V.B. Biol. Reprod. 1991; 45: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Here, we describe a novel class of GABAA receptor subunit that is expressed at relatively high levels in several peripheral tissues, including the uterus. This subunit can combine with known GABAA receptor subunits and alter the sensitivity of recombinant receptors to modulatory agents such as pregnanolone. [35S]tert-Butyl bicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS), [3H] muscimol, [3H]Ro15–1788, and [3H]flunitrazepam were purchased from DuPont. Pentobarbital and 5α-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one were from Sigma. The HEK-293 cell line (ATCC CRL 1573) was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The PANC cell line was provided by Dr. E. Jaffe (Johns Hopkins University). Human placenta and uterus were obtained from National Disease Research Interchange. Samples of poly(A)+ RNA from other tissues were purchased fromClontech. A consensus sequence of amino acid residues that are conserved between all known vertebrate GABAA receptor subunits (3Davies P.A. Hanna M.C. Hales T.G. Kirkness E.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 820-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) was searched against the human cDNA data base (15Kirkness E.F. Kerlavage A.R. Cowell I.G. Austin C.A. cDNA Library Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1996: 261-268Google Scholar), using the TBLASTN algorithm (16Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar). The search uncovered an expressed sequence tag (EST) that encodes part of a subunit homologue that has not been described previously. This EST was derived from a partial cDNA clone of a pancreatic carcinoma mRNA (nucleotides 859–3300; Fig. 1). Flanking 5′ sequence (nucleotides 1–984; Fig. 1) was obtained by anchored PCR (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (CD-ROM). John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar), using a pancreatic carcinoma cDNA library as template. A fragment of the amplified cDNA (nucleotides 2–230; Fig. 1) was then used to screen approximately 5 × 105 plaques of the cDNA library, using standard procedures (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (CD-ROM). John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar). Two independent clones that contained full-length inserts of 3.3 kb were isolated. A fragment of one insert (nucleotides 76–1503; Fig. 1) was transferred to the pCDM8 vector (Invitrogen) and re-sequenced over its entire length prior to expression studies. Initially, two fragments of the rat π subunit gene were amplified by PCR from total genomic DNA using degenerate primers that were derived from the human π subunit protein sequence. For fragment 1, the primers were 5′-GGWAATGATGTKGARTTYACYTGG-3′ and 5′-CGATCTKGTKACTAAKGTRAARTA-3′ (nucleotides 709–732 and 799–822; Fig. 1). For fragment 2, they were 5′-CACTAGRTTRGTYTTRCARTTTGA-3′ and 5′-GCAGGTTCTTGCAGGGACTGAATC-3′ (nucleotides 843–866 and 961–984; Fig. 1). Amplification at 95 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 60 s, 72 °C for 2 min was performed for 30 cycles using the GenAmp system (Perkin-Elmer). Sequences of the cloned fragments were then used to design primers for amplification of two overlapping fragments of the rat π subunit cDNA. Total RNA (5 μg) was isolated from rat uterus (18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar), and reverse-transcribed using 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 42 °C for 60 min. The primer was a 15-mer poly(dT) oligonucleotide. Samples (5%) of the reaction products were then subjected to 35 cycles of PCR as described above. For the 5′-region of the cDNA, the primers were 5′-gcggaattcCAGAGCCTCAACAACTACCTG-3′ (nucleotides 94–114; Fig. 1) and 5′-gcggaattcCCAAAAGGAGACCCAGGATAA-3′ (nucleotides 820–840 of GenBank™ accession number U95368). For the 3′-region, the primers were 5′-gcggaattcGATTCGGTACGTGGACTCGAA-3′ (nucleotides 635–654 of U95368) and 5′-gcggaattcGTTGAAGACCTATGGCATGCA-3′ (nucleotides 1497–1516; Fig.1). The two amplified cDNA fragments (858 and 772 base pairs) were purified and sequenced directly. The protein-coding region of the cDNA sequence was then amplified from total uterus cDNA using the XL-PCR system (Perkin-Elmer). The primers were 5′-ccggccactaGTGAATCAGCTCCTTCAATATGAGCTACA-3′ (nucleotides 27–55 of GenBank™ number U95368) and 5′-ccggccactagTCAAAAATACATGTAGTATGCCCAGTAA-3′ (nucleotides 1341–1368 of GenBank™ number U95368). The reaction products were ligated into the pCDM8 vector, and individual clones were sequenced over their entire lengths to ensure that no mutations had been introduced. Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from placenta, uterus, and PANC cells using the Oligotex system (Qiagen). Approximately 2-μg samples of poly(A)+RNA were electrophoresed on 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized with a32P-labeled fragment of the 3′-untranslated π subunit cDNA (nucleotides 1501–2340; Fig. 1). The blots were washed at 60 °C in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS prior to exposure. The blots were stripped of probe by boiling in 0.5% SDS, and re-hybridized with a 32P-labeled fragment of the cDNA that encodes human glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (nucleotides 789–1140; Ref.19Tokunaga K. Nakamura Y. Sakata K. Fujimori K. Ohkubo M. Sawada K. Sakiyama S. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 5616-5619PubMed Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with calf serum (10%), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). Cells were plated at ∼20% confluence, 24 h prior to transfection. Transfection of subunit cDNAs was performed with a calcium phosphate-DNA precipitate in HEPES buffer (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (CD-ROM). John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar). Following incubation with the precipitate for 24 h, the cells were washed and cultured for a further 48 h before harvesting. All subunit cDNAs were derived from rat and were cloned in pCDM8. Transfection efficiencies were standardized by cotransfecting a β-galactosidase cDNA, as described previously (20Kirkness E.F. Fraser C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4420-4428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A crude membrane fraction was prepared from transfected cells as described previously (3Davies P.A. Hanna M.C. Hales T.G. Kirkness E.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 820-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The [35S]TBPS binding activity of membranes (50–100 ng of protein) was assayed by incubation for 120 min at 25 °C in 100 μl of a solution containing Tris-HCl (20 mm), NaCl (1m), pH 7.5. Assays included [35S]TBPS at 1–40 nm (for Scatchard analysis) or 5 nm (all other experiments). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of picrotoxin (100 μm) and was equal to the binding of mock-transfected cell membranes (<0.03 pmol/mg of protein). Following incubation, 5 ml of ice-cold assay buffer was added, and the membranes filtered through Whatman GF/C filters under vacuum. The filters were washed twice with 5 ml of the same buffer prior to scintillation counting. The binding of [3H]muscimol (20 nm) was assayed by incubation of membranes for 60 min at 0 °C in 100 μl of TEN (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, ph 7.5). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of GABA (1 mm). The binding of [3H]Ro15–1788 and [3H]flunitrazepam was assayed by incubation of membranes for 60 min at 0 °C in 100 μl of TEN, NaCl (0.1 m). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of flunitrazepam (10 μm). Assays included [3H]Ro15–1788 at 0.5–6 nm (for Scatchard analysis) or 2 nm (all other experiments). Bound ligand was detected by filtration as described above. All binding data are mean values ± S.D. of three experiments, using membranes from at least two independent transfections. A novel class of GABAA receptor subunit was identified by searching a data base of ESTs with a peptide consensus sequence of known family members. The sequence of this EST was used to isolate a 3.3-kb cDNA from a pancreatic carcinoma cDNA library. The cDNA contains a large open reading frame that is flanked by stop codons and encodes a polypeptide of 440-amino acid residues (Fig.1). The polypeptide, termed the π subunit, has all of the hallmarks of a ligand-gated anion channel subunit. The N-terminal half of the protein exhibits five sites for potentialN-linked glycosylation, and two cysteine residues separated by 13 amino acids (residues 160 and 174). The C-terminal half of the protein contains four hydrophobic regions that are potential transmembrane domains. The first of these contains a conserved proline residue, while the second contains an octamer sequence (residues 280–287) that is similar, but not identical, to that found in most GABAA and glycine receptor subunits. Within this octamer, the π subunit contains a serine residue at position 284, where threonine is found in all other GABAA receptor subunits. This minor difference in protein sequence may explain why the π subunit cDNA has not been uncovered previously by the cross-hybridization approaches that have relied almost exclusively on conservation of this motif. The amino acid sequence of the π subunit is most closely related to GABAA receptor β subunits (37% amino acid identity), followed by the δ subunit (35%) and ρ subunits (33%). It displays less similarity to other GABA and glycine receptor subunits. The maximum levels of sequence identity are similar to those found between the different classes of GABAA receptor subunits (20–40%; Refs. 1Macdonald R.L. Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 569-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar and 2Whiting P.J. McKernan R.M. Wafford K.A. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1995; 38: 95-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and justifies its categorization within a distinct subunit class. Of the 78 amino acid residues that are conserved between all known GABAA receptor subunits (3Davies P.A. Hanna M.C. Hales T.G. Kirkness E.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 820-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), only six are substituted in the π subunit sequence (Fig. 1). A rat cDNA that encodes a homologue of the human π subunit was also isolated. The rat and human π subunits display a high degree of sequence conservation (93% amino acid identity; Fig. 1). This conservation includes the six amino acid residues that vary from all other known GABAA receptor subunits. Expression of π subunit mRNA in human tissues was first assessed by searching EST data bases for additional examples of π subunit cDNA fragments. The dbEST data base (21; release 32897) contains eight entries 2GenBank™ accession numbers H43243, U54596,U54597, U54599, AA101225, AA102670, AA120821, and AA120822. that were derived from six partial human π subunit cDNA clones. In common with the cDNA described here, four of these clones were derived from two independent pancreatic carcinomas. The remainder were isolated from a neuroepithelial cell line (NT2) and breast tissue. A more systematic examination of expression patterns employed a collection cDNA libraries that were derived from most major human tissues (22Adams M.D. Kerlavage A.R. Fleischmann R.D. Fuldner R.A. Bult C.J. Lee N.H. Kirkness E.F. Weinstock K.G. Gocayne J.D. et al.Nature. 1995; 377: 3-174PubMed Google Scholar). After 35 cycles of PCR, using approximately 1 × 106 phage, a detectable π subunit cDNA fragment was amplified from the cDNA libraries of uterus, prostate, ovaries, placenta, gall bladder, lung, small intestine, and two brain regions (hippocampus and temporal cortex; data not shown). When available, these tissues were examined by Northern analysis to obtain a more quantitative estimation of subunit mRNA expression levels. A hybridizing transcript of the predicted size (3.3 kb) could be detected in several tissues (Fig. 2). Although this transcript was barely detectable in small intestine, ovaries, and placenta, it was relatively enriched in lung, thymus, and prostate and was particularly abundant in the uterus. The π subunit transcript was also enriched in a cell line (PANC) that was derived from a human pancreatic adenocarcinoma. 3E. Jaffe, personal communication. Notably, no hybridizing transcripts were detected in samples of whole brain or pancreas. It appears that the π subunit is expressed in only a minor subpopulation of cells in these tissues. Future in situ hybridization studies should help to identify these cell types. The pharmacological properties that are conferred to GABAAreceptors by the π subunit were examined after transient expression in HEK-293 cells. Cells that were transfected with only the π subunit cDNA did not express binding sites for the GABAAreceptor ligands, [3H]muscimol or [35S]TBPS (Table I). These cells also failed to elicit chloride currents in response to GABA or glycine (each 100 μm). 4T. G. Hales, personal communication. The π subunit is therefore unlike the ρ class of GABA receptor subunits (2Whiting P.J. McKernan R.M. Wafford K.A. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1995; 38: 95-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) or the α class of glycine receptor subunits (23Schmieden V. Kuhse J. Betz H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2025-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), which can each assemble homomeric chloride channels that are gated by these ligands. When cells were cotransfected with cDNAs encoding the π subunit, and either an α1 subunit or a β1 subunit, there was also a failure to detect expression of any ligand binding activities. The π subunit therefore does not behave like a typical GABAA receptor α or β subunit (2Whiting P.J. McKernan R.M. Wafford K.A. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1995; 38: 95-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). As expected, transfection of cells with a combination of α, β, and π subunits resulted in the expression of both [3H]muscimol and [35S]TBPS binding sites (Table I). However, the transfected cell membranes did not bind either [3H]Ro15–1788 or [3H]flunitrazepam. Therefore, the π subunit is also unlike the γ class of subunits, which confers a sensitivity to benzodiazepines when expressed with α and β subunits (2Whiting P.J. McKernan R.M. Wafford K.A. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1995; 38: 95-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).Table IBinding of radioligands to cell membranes after transient expression of GABAA receptor subunit combinationsSubunit combinationRadioligand binding1-aCell membranes displayed specific binding activities of either 0.20-3.00 pmol/mg protein (+) or 0.00–0.03 pmol/mg of protein (−).[35S]-TBPS (5 nm)[3H]Muscimol (20 nm)[3H]Ro15-1788 (2 nm)α1 −−− β1−−− β3+−− γ2−−− π−−−α1 β1++−α1 β3++−α1 γ2−−−α1 π−−− β1−−− β3+−− β1−−− β3+−− γ2 π−−−α1 β1 γ2+++α1 β3 γ2+++α1 β1 π++−α1 β3 π++− β1 γ2 π−−− β3 γ2 π+−−α1 β1 γ2 π+++α1 β3 γ2 π+++1-a Cell membranes displayed specific binding activities of either 0.20-3.00 pmol/mg protein (+) or 0.00–0.03 pmol/mg of protein (−). Open table in a new tab In common with the δ and ε subunit classes, the absence or presence of binding sites for [35S]TBPS, [3H]muscimol, and [3H]Ro15–1788 failed to demonstrate that the π subunit can assemble with known GABAA receptor subunits. However, such an ability could be inferred from the observation that inclusion of the π subunit with α/β/γ subunit combinations caused a significant reduction of [3H]Ro15–1788 binding to transfected cell membranes. This was demonstrated clearly by transfecting different ratios of the subunit cDNAs (Table II). When the π subunit cDNA was transfected with an α/β/γ subunit combination in an equimolar ratio, the density of [3H]Ro15–1788 binding sites was reduced by 45%. A 5-fold increase in the molar ratio of transfected π subunit cDNA caused a much larger reduction (90%) of the B max value for [3H]Ro15–1788 binding. In contrast, a 5-fold increase in the molar ratio of transfected γ2 subunit cDNA, blocked the reduction caused by the presence of the π subunit, and returned theB max value to 84% of that obtained with α/β/γ subunits alone. Notably, these variable subunit combinations had little effect on the binding of [35S]TBPS and [3H]muscimol (Table II). It was concluded that expression of the π subunit with the α/β/γ subunit combination results in expression of α/β/γ/π receptors that lack [3H]Ro15–1788 binding sites and/or a mixed population of α/β/γ and α/β/π receptors.Table IIBinding of radioligands to cell membranes after transient expression of α1, β1, γ2, and π subunit combinationsMolar ratio of transfected subunit cDNAsRadioligand binding2-aSpecific binding activities are expressed in units of fmol/unit β-galactosidase and represent mean values (S.D.) of three independent experiments.

Open table in a new tab Clearly, transfection of cells with a combination of α, β, γ, and π subunit cDNAs can give rise to multiple receptor types, composed of different subunit combinations and stoichiometries. For this reason, a less complex system was chosen to perform an initial characterization of the pharmacological properties that are conferred to GABAA receptors by the π subunit. This system utilized the β3 subunit, which assembles homomeric chloride channels that bind [35S]TBPS with high affinity (24Davies P.A. Kirkness E.F. Hales T.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 25Slany A. Zezula J. Tretter V. Sieghart W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 385-391PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with either the β3 cDNA alone or a combination of β3 and π cDNAs. The presence of the π subunit had no significant effects on the K d andB max values for [35S]TBPS binding to transfected cell membranes. Also, displacement of [35S]TBPS binding by pentobarbital, yielded similarK i values for the two membrane preparations (9 and 10 μm, respectively; Fig. 3). However, displacement of binding by pregnanolone demonstrated a significant difference between the recombinant receptors. The concentration of steroid that displaced binding from the β3 homomeric receptor by 50% (3.5 μm) had no significant effect on binding to membranes of β3/π transfected cells (Fig. 3). TheK i values for the two membrane preparations were 2 and 18 μm, respectively. The same effect was observed with human β3 and π subunit cDNAs, expressed in either HeLa or HEK-293 cells (data not shown). The physiological significance of this reduced sensitivity to pregnanolone is unknown at present. To address this question, it will be necessary to identify the subunits with which the π subunit combines in vivo and re-examine the properties of relevant subunit combinations in recombinant systems. However, this effect of the π subunit provides further evidence that it can assemble with known GABAA receptor subunits and alter the sensitivity of receptors to modulatory agents. The actions of pregnanolone at GABAA receptors have been proposed to regulate uterine motility by inhibiting contractions (13Majewska M.D. Vaupel D.B. J. Endocrinol. 1991; 131: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Putnam C.D. Brann D.W. Kolbeck R.C. Mahesh V.B. Biol. Reprod. 1991; 45: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A quiescence of uterine motility is essential for embryonic implantation and maintenance of pregnancy (26Csapo A.I. Resch B.A. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1979; 134: 823-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The identification of a novel subunit class in the uterus is therefore likely to provide new insights to the role of GABAA receptors in this important process."

However, the mechanisms controlling the expression of these genes have not been well elucidated. Here, we report that the expression of ratmdr1b gene in cultured H-4-II-E hepatoma cells can be induced by insulin. Transient transfection assays using reporter gene constructs containing various 5′ mdr1b sequences showed that the sequence located between base pairs −243 and −163 is important for insulin's induction of mdr1b promoter activity. Further analyses revealed that a NF-κB-binding site (located between base pairs −167 and −158) is required for insulin-induced promoter activity. Gel mobility shift assay demonstrated that insulin stimulates the binding of nuclear p50/p65 subunits to the mdr1b NF-κB sequence. Cotransfection of plasmids expressing either the p50/p65 NF-κB subunits or Raf-1 kinase or both resulted in increased expression of the gene containing wild-type but not NF-κB site-mutated mdr1b promoter. Finally, expression of either the antisense p65 subunit of NF-κB or dominant negative Raf-1 kinase blocked insulin's induction of themdr1b promoter activity. Taken together, our results suggest that the insulin-induced mdr1b expression is mediated by transcription factor NF-κB via the Raf-1 kinase signaling pathway.

Previous studies with primary hepatocytes have shown the mRNA level of the rat mdr1b gene to be spontaneously up-regulated due to the increased transcription (30Fardel O. Ratanasavanh D. Loyer P. Ketterer B. Guillouzo A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Further studies have indicated that the expression of the rat mdr1b in primary hepatocyte cultures can be modulated by dexamethasone (14Fardel O. Lecureur V. Guillouzo A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), extracellular matrix (31Schuetz J.D. Schuetz E.G.

Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), suggesting that factors or stress in culture may contribute to the induction of rat mdr1b expression in primary hepatocytes. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms involved in the induced expression of rat mdr1b by these factors are still largely unclear. Although the 5′-flanking sequences of rat mdr1bhave been isolated (26Zhou G. Song R. Kuo M.T. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 1369-1381PubMed Google Scholar, 32Silverman J.A. Hill B.A. Mol. Carcinogen. 1995; 13: 50-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and a cis-acting element important for its promoter function has been identified (26Zhou G. Song R. Kuo M.T. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 1369-1381PubMed Google Scholar), until now little has been known about the cis- andtrans-acting factors responsible for the inducible expression of the rat mdr1b gene by extracellular stimuli. In the present report, we show that expression of the ratmdr1b gene in rat H-4-II-E hepatoma cells can be induced by insulin. Using transient transfection assays, we confirmed that both an NF-κB-binding site located at bp −167 to −158 (5′-GGGGAATTCC-3′) and a previously identified palindromic sequence (5′-AGACATGTCT-3′) located at bp −189 to −180 from the transcription start site (26Zhou G. Song R. Kuo M.T. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 1369-1381PubMed Google Scholar) are involved in basal transcriptional regulation as well as insulin induction of the promoter function of the rat mdr1b gene. In addition, we demonstrated that Raf-1 kinase is also implicated in the increased NF-κB-mediated expression of the rat mdr1b gene by insulin. Because a number of agents known to induce mdrexpression are also known to modulate NF-κB activities, our present findings have a broad implication in the regulation of mdrexpression under various conditions.

The rat mdr1b-CAT reporter constructs (−1288 RMICAT, −1288 RMICAT-Fm1, −243 RMICAT, −163 RMICAT) were constructed as described previously (26Zhou G. Song R. Kuo M.T. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 1369-1381PubMed Google Scholar). The site-directed mutant constructs were generated by a two-step PCR strategy (33Higuchi R.Z. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J.

Then, after digestion with XbaI, the PCR products were used to replace the XbaI insert of −243 RMICAT. This generated −243 RMICAT-Fm1 and −243 RMICAT-κm, respectively. A similar approach was used to generate −1288 RMICAT-κm except that two interior primers (5′-TCTGTGTTAATGTCTGCTCAATTCCAGCTCCCTT-3′ and its complementary sequence) were used for PCR amplification. The sequences of all the mutant versions were confirmed by sequencing. −243 RMICAT, −243 RMICAT-Fm1, and −243 RMICAT-κm were used as templates for PCR amplification to construct 3x-243 RMICAT, 3x-243 RMICAT-Fm1, and 3x-243 RMICAT-κm, respectively. To do this, the following paired primer sets were used: pair 1, 5′-AGGGATGGTACCGTGCACTAT-3′ (forward primer, withAsp718 site created underlined) and 5′-TGGGATCCAGGCTTCTCTGA-3′ (backward primer, withBamHI site created underlined); pair 2, 5′-CAGGGATCCAACCGTGCAC-3′ (forward primer, withBamHI site created underlined) and 5′-TGGGTACCAGGCTTCTCTGA-3′ (backward primer, with theAsp718 site created underlined). The PCR products of pair 1 and 2 primers were then cleaved with BamHI and ligated. After being purified from 3% agarose gel, the ligated products were cleaved at their Asp718 site and inserted into theAsp718 site of −243 RMICAT, −243 RMICAT-Fm1, and −243 RMICAT-κm, respectively, to generate the 3x-243 RMICAT, 3x-243 RMICAT-Fm1, 3x-243 RMICAT-κm.

Prior to stimulation of insulin, cells at 70–80% confluence were grown in 0.3% FCS-containing medium for 48 h. Cells were then treated with insulin (10−7m) for various periods and then harvested for use in preparing nuclear extracts and RNA. The calcium phosphate precipitation method (38Gorman C.M. Padmanabhan R. Howard B.H. Science. 1983; 221: 551-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) was used to transfect cells with DNA. Two hours before transfection, cells in exponential growth phase (approximately 70–80% confluence) were plated in Corning six-well plates. DNA-CaPO4 precipitate was added to the medium with 10% serum and incubated for 5–6 h. After being shocked with 15% glycerol for 30 s and washed with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.3% FCS (low serum medium). When expression vectors of NF-κB p50/p65 subunits, antisense p65, Raf-1 kinase, and its dominant negative mutant were used to transfect cells, cells were harvested approximately 60 h after culture in the low serum medium. For insulin stimulation, 10−7m insulin was added directly to the spent low serum medium 48 h after incubation. After 12 h of insulin treatment, cells were harvested. activities in the cell extracts were measured by a method previously described (39Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell.

Supernatants were removed after centrifugation, and 2 packed cell volumes of buffer A was added. Cells were then lysed by 10–15 strokes in a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer. Then, 110 volume of 68% RNase-free sucrose was mixed with the cell lysates and centrifuged at 16,000 ×g for 30 s at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was washed with buffer A and resuspended in 23 packed cell volumes of buffer B (20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.9, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mmEDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin). After constant agitation for 30 min at 4 °C, nuclear debris was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 6 min, and supernatants (nuclear extracts) were stored at −80 °C until analysis by EMSA. GMSAs were performed with approximately 5 μg of nuclear proteins in a total volume of 20 μl of binding mixture (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 3 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC)) and radiolabeled DNA probe at room temperature for 20 min. If antibodies were added, the mixtures were preincubated for 10 min before the addition of the radiolabeled probe. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad kit according to the manufacturer's instruction. DNA probe was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Boehringer Mannheim). For competition assays, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was added to the reaction. The consensus sequences of AP-1 (41Xanthopoulos K.G. Prezioso V.R. Chen W.S. Sladek F.M. Cortese R.

The final reaction mixture was analyzed on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel with 0.25 × Tris borate-EDTA electrophoresis buffer. A 162-nucleotide (−37 to +125) antisense RNA probe was synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase as described previously (26Zhou G. Song R. Kuo M.T. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 1369-1381PubMed Google Scholar). Either 20 μg (for the mdr1bprobe) or 1 μg (for the 18 S rRNA probe) of total RNA from serum-treated, insulin-treated, or untreated H-4-II-E cells was hybridized with 32P-labeled antisense RNA probes (2 × 105 cpm) and subjected to the RNase protection assays as described previously (26Zhou G.

The protected RNA products were analyzed on a 7% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and quantitated using a Personal Densitometer SI (Molecular Dynamics). To investigate whether the expression of the rat mdr1b gene expression is regulated by insulin, we treated serum-starved rat hepatoma H-4-II-E cells (0.3% serum, 48 h) with insulin. At various time intervals, cells were harvested and mdr1bmRNA levels were measured by RNase protection assay. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the steady-state ratmdr1b mRNA levels elevated rapidly in the first hour after the addition of insulin, reaching to about 3.5-fold by 12 h (Fig. 1 B). Similarly, when serum-starved H-4-II-E cells were treated with serum (20%) for 12 h, a 3–4-fold increase of themdr1b mRNA level was also observed (data not shown).Figure 1Insulin-induced expression of the ratmdr1b gene.

Biochem. 1992; 205: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), treating these cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) also induced rat mdr1b expression (Fig. 1 A, lane 7). This suggests that rat mdr1b expression may be regulated by an inhibitor that can be repressed by protein synthesis inhibition (see below). To investigate the possible involvement of transcriptional regulation in the induction of the rat mdr1b gene expression by insulin and to identify DNA sequences involved in the insulin induction ofmdr1b expression, we generated a set of 5′ deletion mutant CAT constructs (Fig. 2 C) and transfected them into H-4-II-E cells in the presence or absence of insulin stimulation (Fig. 2 A). When −1288 RMICAT and −243 RMICAT containing 1288 and 243 bp of the rat mdr1b upstream sequences, respectively, plus 125 bp downstream from the transcription start site, were transfected into H-4-II-E cells followed by insulin treatment, CAT activities increased an approximately 2-fold in comparison with the untreated controls (p < 0.05) (compare Fig.2 A, lanes 2 and 1 and lanes 4 and 3). However, when −163RMICAT, which contains additional deletion to −163 bp was transfected, basal transcriptional activities were reduced more than 80% (compare lanes 5 and3), consistent with our previous findings that sequences between −243 and −163 are important for the basal transcription ofmdr1b (26Zhou G. Song R. Kuo M.T. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 1369-1381PubMed Google Scholar). More importantly, the deletion also resulted in the loss of insulin inducibility (lane 6). Together, these results indicated that the rat mdr1b promoter can respond to insulin stimulation and that the sequence from −243 to −163 bp is essential for the promoter's insulin responsiveness. In examining the −243/−163 sequence of the ratmdr1b promoter, we found that a sequence between bp −167 and −158 (5′-GGGGAATTCC-3′) (Fig. 3 A) was strikingly similar to the transcription factor NF-κB-binding consensus sequence (5′-GGGRNNYYCC-3′) (46Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Antwerp D.V. Miyamoto S. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar). A comparison of the putative mdr1b NF-κB-binding site with several known NF-κB-binding sequences, including the interferon-β gene's PRDII site (INFβ PRDII) (43Thanos D. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 152-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and the immunoglobulin gene's κB site (IgκB) (42Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar) is shown in Fig. 3 A. Since insulin can reportedly activate NF-κB activity in CHO-R cells that overexpress insulin receptor (47Bertrand F. Philippe C. Antoine P.J. Baud L. Groyer A. Capeau J. Cherqui G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24435-24441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we speculated that this putative NF-κB-binding site in the rat mdr1b promoter may be involved in the observed insulin's induction of the promoter function. We therefore designed experiments to test this possibility. First, we determined whether the sequence located between bp −167 and −158 is indeed an NF-κB-binding site. To this end, we carried out GMSA using a double-stranded oligonucleotide spanning bp −169 to −153 as the probe (designated the mdr-κB fragment in Fig. 3 A) and various unlabeled oligonucleotides as competitors. As shown in Fig.3 B, a DNA-protein complex was formed in nuclear extracts prepared from mouse hepatoma BprC1 cells (lane 1). More importantly, formation of this complex was efficiently competed only by the unlabeled probe (lane 2) and NF-κB sequences derived from IgκB (lane 8) and PRDII (lane 9), and not by the mutated sequence of IgκB (IgκBm, lane 10) or other unrelated consensus sequences, i.e. HNF-1, HNF-3, HNF-4, AP-1, or C/EBP (lanes 3–7). NF-κB is an inducible transcription factor, and its nuclear DNA binding activity could be induced by mitogens such as the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (48Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1988; 53: 211-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). To further substantiate the aforementioned results, we treated BprC1 cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (50 ng/ml) and prepared nuclear extracts from the treated cells. GMSA using the mdr-κB probe showed that the protein binding activity was rapidly induced in nuclear extracts from cells treated for 30 min and that the increase lasted at least 1 h (Fig. 3 C, lanes 1–3). Furthermore, the formation of protein-DNA complex could be blocked by antiserum raised against the p65 subunit of NF-κB (Fig.3 C, lanes 5, 7, and 9), whereas the preimmune serum did not inhibit the formation of DNA-protein complexes (lanes 4, 6, and8). Thus, taken together, these results strongly suggest that the rat mdr1b promoter sequence located between bp −167 and −158 (5′-GGGGAATTCC-3′) is an authentic NF-κB-binding site. To determine whether the mdr-κB site is functionally involved inmdr1b promoter activity, we first generated site-directed mutations in the NF-κB sequence of the wild-type −1288 RMICAT recombinant (designated −1288 RMICAT-κm, Fig.4 B) and then transiently transfected them into rat H-4-II-E cells. In the absence of insulin, basal expression of CAT activity was reduced about 65% in cells transfected with mutant −1288 RMICAT-κm co"

MAPKs are classified into at least three groups, including ERK, JNK/SAPK, and p38/Mpk2, and each group phosphorylates a different set of substrates, including other protein kinases and transcription factors (1Nishida E.

JNKs/SAPKs were first identified as c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) or stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), both of which are activated in response to UV irradiation, osmotic shock, heat shock, and treatment with tumor necrosis factor-α or antibiotics known to be inhibitors of eukaryotic protein synthesis (4Hibi M.

The activity of JNKs/SAPKs depends greatly on the phosphorylation of specific threonine and tyrosine residues located in kinase subdomain VIII catalyzed by upstream activators or MAPKK class protein kinases (5Dérijard B.

One such activator, known as SEK1/MKK4/JNKK, has been cloned, and its activity has been shown to be greatly dependent on the phosphorylation of specific serine and threonine residues located between kinase subdomains VII and VIII, as reported for MEKs, activators of ERKs (8Sánchez I.

In fact, increasing numbers of protein kinases are now identified as MAPKKKs acting on SEK1/MKK4/JNKK, including MEKK2 and MEKK3 (12Blank J.L. Gerwins P. Elliott E.M. Sather S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism that regulates these MAPKKKs remains mostly unknown. In addition to SEK1/MKK4/JNKK, at least two other stress-induced JNK/SAPK activators have been identified in column fractions of cell extracts, suggesting the presence of multiple pathways for JNK/SAPK activation (14Moriguchi T.

Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 796-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that a protein kinase, MUK, activates the JNK/SAPK pathway when overexpressed in cultured cells (16Hirai S.-i. Izawa M. Osada S.-i. Spyrou G. Ohno S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 641-650PubMed Google Scholar). MUK is a rat homologue of mouse DLK (17Holzman L.B. Merritt S.E. Fan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30808-30817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human ZPK (18Reddy U.R. Pleasure D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), whose kinase domain shows structural features of both the tyrosine-specific and serine/threonine-specific protein kinase classes. In addition to a unique kinase domain, MUK/DLK/ZPK contains two leucine zipper-like structures located proximal to the C-terminal end of the catalytic domain. These features are common to members of the mixed lineage kinase (MLK) family, including MLK1 (19Dorow D.S. Devereux L. Dietzsch E. De Kretser T. Eur. J.

Therefore, MUK/DLK/ZPK has been identified as the fourth member of the MLK family (16Hirai S.-i. Izawa M. Osada S.-i. Spyrou G. Ohno S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 641-650PubMed Google Scholar, 17Holzman L.B. Merritt S.E. Fan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30808-30817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Reddy U.R. Pleasure D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The finding that MUK/DLK/ZPK activates the JNK/SAPK pathway raises the intriguing possibility that other members of the MLK family also activate the JNK/SAPK pathway or other MAPK pathways. More recently, we have shown that SPRK/PTK1/MLK3 also activates the JNK/SAPK pathway preferentially through SEK1/MKK4/JNKK (25Rana A. Gallo K. Godowski P. Hirai S.-i. Ohno S. Zon L. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19025-19028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, the ability to activate SEK1/MKK4/JNKK directly has not been demonstrated for either SPRK/PTK1/MLK3 or MUK/DLK/ZPK, leaving the possibility that another direct activator of SEK1/MKK4/JNKK may be involved. In this report, we show that MST/MLK2, like MUK/DLK/ZPK, activates JNK/SAPK and SEK1/MKK4/JNKK in COS-1 cells. Furthermore, we show that recombinant MST/MLK2 directly phosphorylates and activates a recombinant SEK1/MKK4/JNKK in vitro. These results show that MST/MLK2 and probably other members of the MLK family also are MAPKKKs that act preferentially on the JNK/SAPK pathway. The mammalian expression vectors for MUK (16Hirai S.-i.

The expression vector for MST was constructed with the mammalian expression vector SRα and human MST cDNA (20Katoh M. Hirai M. Sugimura T. Terada M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1447-1451PubMed Google Scholar). T7-tagged MST was constructed with SRα, a DNA fragment encoding a His tag/T7 epitope derived from pBlueBac (Invitrogen), and MST cDNA. The first nine amino acid residues of the MST protein produced from this expression vector were replaced by a His tag/T7 epitope consisting of 40 amino acid residues. A kinase-defective mutant of MST, MST/KN, was constructed with the T7-tagged MST expression vector by in-frame deletion of residues 140–185, corresponding to kinase subdomains III–V. COS-1 cells were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected by an electroporation method using 16 μg of DNA for 5 × 106 cells seeded in four 10-cm dishes after the transfection. Cells were further cultured for 48 h before harvest. When required, 100 ng/ml 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or 0.7 mNaCl was added 10 or 40 min before harvest. For UV irradiation, cells were exposed to 100 J of UV light/m2 40 min before harvest. Cells grown in 10-cm dishes were lysed in 250 μl of lysis buffer consisting of 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Deoxycholate and SDS were omitted when antibody against the hemagglutinin tag was used for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged enzymes was carried out at 4 °C for 1 h using 1 μg of mouse monoclonal antibody against either the T7 epitope (Invitrogen) or the HA tag (Boehringer Mannheim) pre-fixed on 5 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The Sepharose resin was washed five times with lysis buffer and finally washed with detergent-free lysis buffer, and aliquots were collected in two tubes: one was used for the solid-phase kinase assay, and the other was extracted with SDS sample buffer for Western blot analysis. For the solid-phase kinase assay, the epitope-tagged enzymes fixed on 2 μl of protein G-Sepharose were suspended in 20 μl of assay mixture containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 15 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 1 μg of recombinant c-Jun, recombinant CREBP-1/ATF2, or bovine brain myelin basic protein (MBP) (Sigma M1891). The kinase reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 20 min and stopped by adding 25 μl of SDS sample buffer. The phosphorylation of each substrate was detected by SDS-PAGE, and the amount of 32P incorporated was quantified with a Fuji BAS2000 image analyzer. Expression vectors for GST-SEK1, GST-JNK1, and GST-ERK1 were constructed with the bacteria expression vector pGEX-2T or pGEX-3X (Pharmacia) and cDNA encoding SEK1, the SEK1(K/R) mutant (9Dérijard B.

Spyrou G. Ohno S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 641-650PubMed Google Scholar). To construct the MalE-MST expression vector, a cDNA fragment encoding MST amino acids 10–757 was cloned into the pMAL-c2 vector (New England Biolabs Inc.). The expression vector for c-Jun was described elsewhere (16Hirai S.-i. Izawa M. Osada S.-i. Spyrou G. Ohno S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 641-650PubMed Google Scholar). The expression vector for GST-CREBP-1 was the kind gift of Drs. T. Maekawa and S. Ishii (38Maekawa T. Sakura H. Kanei-Ishii C. Sudo T. Yoshimura T. Fujisawa J.-i. Yoshida M. Ishii S. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2023-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The production of GST and MalE fusion proteins in bacteria (Escherichia coli DH1) was started by adding 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and continued for 18 h at 25 °C. The fusion proteins were purified according to the standard protocol using glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia) or amylose resin (New England Biolabs Inc.). Routinely, 1∼5 mg of fusion proteins were recovered from 500 ml of bacteria culture. COS-1 cells grown in 10-cm dishes were lysed in 250 μl of G buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. GST-SEK1 was recovered using 5 μl of glutathione-Sepharose. The resin was washed five times with G buffer and then washed one time with detergent-free G buffer. GST-SEK1 was eluted from the resin with 100 μl of 5 mm glutathione in detergent-free G buffer. For the in vitro kinase assay, 5 μl of the GST-SEK1 solution were first incubated with 50 ng of GST-JNK1 in 20 μl of the assay mixture described above containing 50 μm ATP at 30 °C for 15 min. Then, 2 μl of substrate mixture containing 1 μg of c-Jun, 2.5 mm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP were added, and the mixture was further incubated for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 25 μl of SDS sample buffer, and the phosphorylation of c-Jun was quantified as described above. The in vitro phosphorylation of GST-SEK1(K/R) or GST-MEK1(K/R) by MalE-MST-(10–757) was carried out at 30 °C for 45 min in 20 μl of assay mixture containing 1 μg of GST-SEK1(K/R) or 2 μg of GST-MEK1(K/R) and 1 or 4 μg of MalE-MST-(10–757), adjusting the total amount of protein to 6 μg by adding MalE protein. The reaction was stopped by adding 25 μl of SDS sample buffer, and the proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and autoradiography. The activation of GST-SEK1 or GST-MEK1 by MalE-MST-(10–757) was tested by a two-step kinase reaction. The first step was carried out at 30 °C for 45 min in 20 μl of assay mixture containing 25 μm unlabeled ATP, 50 ng of GST-JNK1 or GST-ERK1, 200 ng of GST-SEK1 or GST-MEK1, and 1 or 4 μg of MalE-MST-(10–757), adjusting the total amount of protein to 5.25 μg by adding MalE protein. The second reaction was started by adding 2 μl of substrate mixture containing 1 μg of c-Jun or myelin basic protein, 2.5 mm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubating the reaction mixture for a further 15 min. The phosphorylation of c-Jun or myelin basic protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. To test the ATP dependence of the activation of GST-SEK1 by MalE-MST-(10–757), 10 μg of MalE-MST-(10–757) and 2 μg of GST-SEK1 were incubated in 200 μl of assay mixture in the presence or absence of 50 μm ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. GST-SEK1 was then affinity-purified and assayed for JNK1 activation activity as described for the in vitro assay of GST-SEK1 expressed in COS-1 cells. The ability of MST to activate three different MAPK-related protein kinase pathways (JNK/SAPK, p38/Mpk2, and ERK/MAPK) was tested in cotransfection experiments using COS-1 cells with immunoprecipitation of the epitope-tagged enzymes and solid-phase kinase assay using appropriate substrates as indicated in Fig. 1 (A–C). The overexpression of MUK and MST, like UV irradiation, caused a >10-fold induction of tagged JNK1 activity (Fig. 1 A). The activity of tagged p38 was induced modestly (1.2∼1.5-fold) by MUK or MST under conditions where osmotic shock with 0.7 m NaCl caused a >5-fold induction (Fig. 1 B). The activity of tagged ERK2 was not induced by MUK at all (Ref. 16Hirai S.-i. Izawa M. Osada S.-i. Spyrou G. Ohno S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 641-650PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 1 C), whereas it was induced modestly (2∼3-fold) by MST, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate stimulation caused a >10-fold induction (Fig. 1 C). The immunoprecipitated enzymes were also analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using anti-tag antibodies (Fig. 1 D). Note that the amounts of enzymes used for the solid-phase kinase assay were roughly the same for each assay and that the activation of tagged JNK1 and tagged ERK2 could also be detected as a mobility delay by SDS-PAGE. Taken together, these data show that MST, like MUK, preferentially activates the JNK/SAPK pathway with a somewhat loose downstream specificity. The activity of JNK/SAPK depends greatly on the phosphorylation of specific threonine and tyrosine residues catalyzed by upstream MAPKK class protein kinases such as SEK1 (7Galcheva-Gargova Z. Dérijard B. Wu I.-H. Davis R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ability of MUK and MST to activate SEK1 was tested in cotransfection experiments using COS-1 cells. GST-SEK1 was coexpressed with tagged MUK or tagged MST in COS-1 cells, and the activity of GST-SEK1 was measured in vitro after its recovery from the cells with a GST affinity resin. Two recombinant proteins, GST-JNK1 (a substrate for SEK1) and c-Jun (a substrate for JNK1), were produced in bacteria and used for the in vitroassay of GST-SEK1 activity; activity was finally detected as the incorporation of radiolabeled phosphate into c-Jun (Fig.2 A). The overexpression of tagged MUK or tagged MST in COS-1 cells caused a 10∼30-fold activation of coexpressed GST-SEK1. On the other hand, no such activation of GST-SEK1 was observed when the tagged MST or tagged MUK mutant lacking a part of the kinase domain (tag-MST/KN and tag-MUK/KN) was overexpressed, although the expression of these mutants was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-tag antibody (Fig. 2 B,upper panel). The incorporation of radiolabeled phosphate into c-Jun depended greatly on the presence of GST-JNK1, and very little activity was recovered from cells not transfected with the expression vector for GST-SEK1. Furthermore, roughly the same amount of GST-SEK1 was recovered from different sets of cells coexpressing different proteins (Fig. 2 B, lower panel). Taken together, these results demonstrate the ability of MUK and MST to induce SEK1 activation in COS-1 cells. The kinase domains of MLKs show considerable amino acid sequence homology to those of MAPKKK class protein kinases such as c-Raf and TAK. The MST kinase domain shares 35 and 40% amino acid identity with c-Raf and TAK, respectively. Furthermore, the activation of SEK1 in vitro by overexpressed SPRK immunoprecipitated from COS cells has been reported (25Rana A. Gallo K. Godowski P. Hirai S.-i. Ohno S. Zon L. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19025-19028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that members of the MLK family are direct activators of SEK1, but do not rule out the possibility that they act farther upstream as activators of certain MAPKKKs. We then produced recombinant MST in bacteria as a fusion protein with maltose-binding protein (MalE) to test its ability to activate SEK1 in vitro. The MalE-MST-(10–757) fusion protein affinity-purified on amylose resin appeared as several bands ranging between 80 and ∼140 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig.3 A). The uppermost band corresponds to the expected molecular size of MalE-MST-(10–757), whereas the other bands may represent partially degraded protein since these as well as the 140-kDa band react with anti-MalE antibody (data not shown). The ability of MalE-MST-(10–757) to phosphorylate recombinant GST-SEK1 or GST-MEK1 was first tested. To limit the autophosphorylation of GST-SEK1 or GST-MEK1, an invariant lysine residue located in kinase subdomain II of these kinases was mutated to arginine. MalE-MST-(10–757) could phosphorylate GST-SEK1(K/R) as well as MalE-MST-(10–757) itself (Fig.3 B). However, the phosphorylation of GST-MEK1(K/R) was hardly detected. In addition, neither MalE nor GST was phosphorylated. Therefore, SEK1 is a rather specific substrate for MST in vitro. It has been reported that the activity of SEK1 is greatly dependent on the phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues at positions 219 and 223 of SEK1 (11Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). To test whether the threonine residue is phosphorylated by MalE-MST-(10–757), GST-SEK1(K/R) phosphorylated by MalE-MST-(10–757) was analyzed by Western blotting using a Thr(P)-223-specific SEK1 antibody (New England Biolabs Inc.). As shown in Fig. 3 C, the reactivity of the antibody toward GST-SEK1(K/R) increased significantly after phosphorylation by MalE-MST-(10–757). Therefore, MalE-MST-(10–757) induces the phosphorylation of the threonine residue responsible for the activation of GST-SEK1. We next tested whether MalE-MST-(10–757) activates GST-SEK1 in vitro. The activity of GST-SEK1 was estimated by its ability to activate GST-JNK1, whose activity in turn was estimated by its ability to phosphorylate c-Jun. When GST-JNK1 was preincubated with GST-SEK1 and MalE-MST-(10–757) in the presence of ATP, it phosphorylated c-Jun quite efficiently, whereas only limited phosphorylation was observed when MalE was used instead of MalE-MST-(10–757) (Fig.4 A, first three lanes). Notably, the enhancement of c-Jun phosphorylation induced by MalE-MST-(10–757) was totally dependent on the presence of GST-SEK1, and neither the direct activation of GST-JNK1 nor the direct phosphorylation of c-Jun by MalE-MST-(10–757) was observed (Fig. 4 A, last three lanes). The basal incorporation of phosphate into c-Jun observed in the absence of GST-SEK1 depends on the intrinsic activity of GST-JNK1 since very little phosphorylation of c-Jun was observed in the absence of GST-JNK1 (data not shown). We also tested whether MalE-MST-(10–757) activates GST-MEK1 in vitro. The activity of GST-MEK1 was estimated by its ability to activate GST-ERK1, whose activity in turn was estimated by its ability to phosphorylate MBP. When GST-ERK1 was preincubated with GST-MEK1 and MalE-MST-(10–757) in the presence of ATP, the phosphorylation of MBP was slightly enhanced (Fig. 4 B, first three lanes). However, a slight enhancement of MBP phosphorylation was also observed in the absence of GST-MEK1 (Fig. 4 B, last three lanes), and MalE-MST-(10–757) itself can weakly phosphorylate MBP (data not shown). Therefore, the activation of GST-MEK1 by MalE-MST-(10–757) must be little if anything, as suggested by the very weak activity of MalE-MST-(10–757) in phosphorylating GST-MEK1(K/R) (Fig.3 B). To test whether the activation of GST-SEK1 depends on phosphorylation by MST, GST-SEK1 was preincubated with MalE-MST-(10–757) in the presence or absence of ATP and assayed for JNK1 activation activity. As shown in Fig. 4 C, incubation with MalE-MST-(10–757) in the absence of ATP did not cause the activation of GST-SEK1, whereas a significant activation of GST-SEK1 was caused by incubation in the presence of ATP. Therefore, MalE-MST-(10–757) acts like a MAPKKK and directly phosphorylates and activates GST-SEK1in vitro. We show here that a member of the MLK family, MST/MLK2, activates MAPK pathways. We have already reported that other members of the MLK family, MUK/DLK/ZPK and SPRK/PTK1/MLK3, also activate MAPK pathways (16Hirai S.-i. Izawa M. Osada S.-i. Spyrou G. Ohno S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 641-650PubMed Google Scholar, 25Rana A. Gallo K. Godowski P. Hirai S.-i. Ohno S. Zon L. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19025-19028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). All these kinases activate the JNK/SAPK and p38/Mpk2 pathways when overexpressed in COS cells, while the activation of p38/Mpk2 is rather modest. However, only MST/MLK2 slightly activates the ERK pathway. We also show that recombinant MST/MLK2 produced in bacteria directly phosphorylates and activates SEK1 in vitro. Therefore, MST/MLK2 is a novel MAPKKK, and together with MST/MLK2, all members of the MLK family may be classified into the MAPKKK class of protein kinases that act preferentially on the JNK/SAPK pathway. All members of the MLK family share a well conserved kinase domain, especially MLK1, SPRK/PTK1/MLK3, and MST/MLK2, showing 75–77% amino acid identity. An additional member of the MLK family, MUK/DLK/ZPK, has a somewhat divergent kinase domain, sharing 46∼48% amino acid identity with the others. Among protein kinases outside the MLK family, all show the highest amino acid identity (34∼40%) to the kinase domains of TAK and c-Raf, which are known to act like MAPKKKs (26Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar, 27Daum G. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Fries H.-W. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 474-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). This agrees with our conclusion that MLKs act like MAPKKKs. However, the kinase domains of MLK family members share rather limited numbers of amino acids (29∼34%) with MEKKs, MEKK1, MEKK2, and MEKK3, which also act like MAPKKKs (12Blank J.L. Gerwins P. Elliott E.M. Sather S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5361-5368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 28Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). In addition, the amino acid sequence identity with MEKKs is comparable to that with protein kinases situated farther upstream such as PAK1 (29Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar) and GCK (30Pombo C. Kehrl J.H. Sánchez I. Katz P. Avruch J. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Force T. Kyriakis J.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) (28–33%). The amino acid sequence identity is also low between the kinase domains of MEKKs and c-Raf or TAK, ranging from 26 to ∼31%. Therefore, MEKKs are rather distantly related to other MAPKKKs, including Raf, TAK, and MLKs. Instead, a relatively high number of amino acid residues (31∼34%) are shared between the kinase domains of MEKKs and Tpl-2/Cot, a recently identified MAPKKK that activates the ERK and JNK/SAPK pathways (13Salmerón A. Ahmad T.B. Carlile G.W. Pappin D. Narsimhan R.P. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), suggesting the presence of at least two groups of MAPKKKs carrying structurally distinguishable kinase domains. These two groups are also characterized by their sequence similarity to tyrosine kinases such as c-Abl and c-Met; the kinase domains of Raf, TAK, and MLKs share 29∼37% amino acid sequence identity with these tyrosine kinases, whereas the kinase domains of MEKKs and Tpl-2/Cot share rather limited amino acid sequence identity, ranging from 24 to ∼27%. In contrast to the considerably diverged features of MAPKKK class protein kinases, MAPKK class protein kinases carry highly conserved kinase domains, showing at least 40% amino acid sequence identity among them (9Dérijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.-H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). Therefore, MAPKKKs may have evolved from two or more different ancestral protein kinases, whereas all MAPKKs may have originated from a single ancestor. The selective activation of target MAPK pathways by MAPKKK depends on the substrate specificity of each MAPKKK. The substrate specificity might be determined not only by the direct interaction of a MAPKKK and its substrate(s), MAPKK(s), but also by an additional factor, such as STE5 protein of budding yeast, that acts as an adapter molecule for a certain set of protein kinases (31Choi K.-Y. Satterberg B. Lyons D.M. Elion E.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 499-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The rather weak activity of MST/MLK2 in phosphorylating SEK1/MKK4/JNKKin vitro could be explained by the lack of such an additional factor as well as by the structural abnormality of MST/MLK2 produced in bacteria. In any case, the ability of MST/MLK2 to activate SEK1/MKK4/JNKK indicates that the activation of JNK/SAPK by MST/MLK2in vivo is mediated by SEK1/MKK4/JNKK. In addition, some other MAPKKs that have not been cloned yet (14Moriguchi T. Kawasaki H. Matsuda S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12969-12972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 15Meier R. Rouse J. Cuenda A. Nebreda A.R. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 796-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) could also be involved in the activation of JNK/SAPK by MST/MLK2 in vivo. The specific response of each MAPK pathway to several different extracellular stimuli may depend on which MAPKKK(s) is activated by the stimulation. Furthermore, it may also depend on which MAPKKKs and MAPKKs are expressed in the cell. Both MST/MLK2 and SEK1/MKK4/JNKK are highly expressed in skeletal muscle and brain among the human tissues tested, implying that they play an important role in the activation of JNK/SAPK in these tissues (20Katoh M. Hirai M. Sugimura T. Terada M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1447-1451PubMed Google Scholar, 21Dorow D.S. Devereux L. Tu G.F. Price G. Nicholl J.K. Sutherland G.R. Simpson R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, several tumor cell lines show high levels of MST expression, implying some function of MST/MLK2 in cellular transformation (20Katoh M. Hirai M. Sugimura T. Terada M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1447-1451PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, MST/MLK2 can partly activate the ERK pathway, which plays an important role in cellular transformation (32Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar, 33Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar, 34Sun H. Tonks N.K. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1994; 266: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, the question of whether the constitutive activation of MST causes cellular transformation remains to be answered. The mechanisms by which MST/MLK2 or other members of the MLK family are activated remain unclear. Overexpressed MST is active by itself, and stimulation of cells by serum, UV light, or osmotic shock does not produce any synergistic effect with overexpressed MST. 2S.-i. Hirai, unpublished data. Furthermore, the overexpression of other members of the MLK family, MUK/DLK/ZPK and SPRK/PTK1/MLK3, as well as other MAPKKKs such as MEKKs and Tpl-2/Cot also causes a potent activation of JNK/SAPK without any extracellular stimuli (12Blank J.L. Gerwins P. Elliott E.M. Sather S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5361-5368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 13Salmerón A. Ahmad T.B. Carlile G.W. Pappin D.

Chem. 1996; 271: 19025-19028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Therefore, the activity of these protein kinases may be regulated by a mechanism that does not function well with overexpressed enzymes. The control of mRNA or protein synthesis is a candidate for such a mechanism. In addition, the activity could be regulated by a limited amount of enzymatic or nonenzymatic inhibitor. MST/MLK2, as well as other members of the MLK family, contains two leucine zipper-like motifs proximal to the C-terminal end of the kinase domain and a Rac/Cdc42-binding motif (35Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) proximal to the C-terminal end of the leucine zipper-like motifs. In addition, MST/MLK2 and SPRK/PTK1/MLK3 have SH3 domains proximal to the N-terminal end of the kinase domain. These motifs may contribute to the interaction, if any, with other proteins. Recently, it was reported that an upstream protein kinase, HPK1, interacts with SPRK/PTK1/MLK3 through the SH3 domain (36Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). However, the functional significance of these motifs remains to be clarified. We thank Drs. Toshio Maekawa and Shunsuke Ishii for the gift of the GST-CREBP-1 expression vector. We also thank Kumi Noda for excellent technical support."
https://openalex.org/W1983229991,"The binding properties of the newly described tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-4 (TIMP-4) to progelatinase A and to the COOH-terminal hemopexin-like domain (C domain) of the enzyme were examined. We present evidence for the first time of a specific, high affinity interaction between TIMP-4 and the C domain of human gelatinase A and show that TIMP-4 binds both progelatinase A and the C domain in a similar manner to that of TIMP-2. Saturable binding of recombinant C domain to TIMP-4 and to TIMP-2 but not to TIMP-1 was demonstrated using a microwell protein binding assay. The recombinant collagen binding domain of gelatinase A, comprised of the three fibronectin type II-like repeats, did not bind to TIMP-4, indicating that binding is mediated selectively by the C domain. Binding to TIMP-4 was of high affinity with an apparent K d of 1.7 × 10−7m but slightly weaker than that to TIMP-2 (apparent K d of 0.66 × 10−7m). Affinity chromatography confirmed the TIMP-4-C domain interaction and also showed that the complex could not be disrupted by 1 m NaCl or 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, thereby further demonstrating the tight binding. To verify the biological significance of this interaction, binding of full-length progelatinase A to TIMP-4 was investigated. TIMP-4 and TIMP-2 but not TIMP-1 bound specifically to purified TIMP-2-free human recombinant full-length progelatinase A and to full-length rat proenzyme from the conditioned culture medium of ROS 17/2.8 cells. Preincubation of the C domain with TIMP-2 was found to reduce subsequent binding to TIMP-4 in a concentration-dependent manner. Competition between TIMP-2 and TIMP-4 for a common or overlapping binding sites on the gelatinase A C domain may occur; alternatively TIMP-2 may prevent the binding of TIMP-4 by steric hindrance or induction of a conformational change in the C domain. We propose that the binding of progelatinase A to TIMP-4 represents a third TIMP-progelatinase interaction in addition to that of progelatinase A with TIMP-2 and progelatinase B with TIMP-1 described previously. This new phenomenon may be of important physiological significance in modulating the cell surface activation of progelatinase A. The binding properties of the newly described tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-4 (TIMP-4) to progelatinase A and to the COOH-terminal hemopexin-like domain (C domain) of the enzyme were examined.

The recombinant collagen binding domain of gelatinase A, comprised of the three fibronectin type II-like repeats, did not bind to TIMP-4, indicating that binding is mediated selectively by the C domain. Binding to TIMP-4 was of high affinity with an apparent K d of 1.7 × 10−7m but slightly weaker than that to TIMP-2 (apparent K d of 0.66 × 10−7m). Affinity chromatography confirmed the TIMP-4-C domain interaction and also showed that the complex could not be disrupted by 1 m NaCl or 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, thereby further demonstrating the tight binding. To verify the biological significance of this interaction, binding of full-length progelatinase A to TIMP-4 was investigated. TIMP-4 and TIMP-2 but not TIMP-1 bound specifically to purified TIMP-2-free human recombinant full-length progelatinase A and to full-length rat proenzyme from the conditioned culture medium of ROS 17/2.8 cells. Preincubation of the C domain with TIMP-2 was found to reduce subsequent binding to TIMP-4 in a concentration-dependent manner. Competition between TIMP-2 and TIMP-4 for a common or overlapping binding sites on the gelatinase A C domain may occur; alternatively TIMP-2 may prevent the binding of TIMP-4 by steric hindrance or induction of a conformational change in the C domain. We propose that the binding of progelatinase A to TIMP-4 represents a third TIMP-progelatinase interaction in addition to that of progelatinase A with TIMP-2 and progelatinase B with TIMP-1 described previously. This new phenomenon may be of important physiological significance in modulating the cell surface activation of progelatinase A. Gelatinase A (72-kDa gelatinase, MMP-2, EC 3.4.24.24) belongs to the family of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; N domain, NH2-terminal domain; CBD, collagen-binding domain; C domain, COOH-terminal domain; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases; MT, membrane type; rC domain, recombinant C domain; rCBD, recombinant collagen-binding domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. a group of zinc-dependent enzymes, which together can degrade all components of the extracellular matrix (1Overall C.M.

The remainder of the NH2-terminal domain (N domain) of gelatinase A contains a catalytic zinc-binding site that is common to all MMPs and also a fibronectin type II-like module triple repeat (12Collier E.E.

Overall, manuscript in preparation. Matrix metalloproteinase activity in the extracellular matrix is regulated by a family of specific inhibitors known as TIMPs (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases). Until recently, three members of this family had been characterized: TIMP-1 (20Cawston T.E. Galloway A. Mercer E. Murphy G. Reynolds J.J. Biochem.

The N domains of these proteins share structural similarities (26Carmichael D.F. Sommer A. Thompson R.C. Anderson D.C. Smith C.G. Welgus H.G. Stricklin G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gelatinase A is unique among the MMPs in that the latent enzyme binds TIMP-2 to form a tightly bound 1:1 molar stoichiometric complex (22Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Krutzsch H.C. Liotta L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17374-17378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Goldberg G.I. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Eisen A.Z. Wilhelm S. He C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Reynolds J.J. Murphy G. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), whereas only the active forms of the other MMPs can bind this inhibitor. Binding of TIMP-2 to progelatinase A occurs via the C domains of the enzyme (17Murphy G. Willenbrock F. Ward R.V. Cockett M.I. Eaton D. Docherty A.J.P. Biochem.

Fuerst T.R. Bird R.E. Hoyhtya M. Oelkuct M. Kraus S. Komarek D. Liotta L.A. Berman M.L. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J. Biol.

A further binding site for the N domain of TIMP-2 is also found on the C domain of gelatinase A (39Overall, C. M., Wallon, U. M., Steffensen, B., DeClerck, Y., Tschesche, H., and Abbey, R. S. (1997) in Inhibitors of Metalloproteinases in Development and Disease (Edwards, D., Hawkes, S., and Kokha, R., eds), in press.Google Scholar), although the biological significance of this interaction is not yet clear. The binding of TIMP-2 to the C domain of progelatinase A is involved in the activation mechanism of the enzyme. Unlike the other MMPs, progelatinase A fails to activate after treatment with proteinases such as plasmin, plasma kallikrein, neutrophil elastase, or cathepsin G (5Nagase H. Ogata Y. Suzuki K. Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 8Okada Y. Morodomi T. Enghild J.J. Suzuki K. Yasui A. Nakanishi I. Salvesen G. Nagase H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Instead, a cell membrane-mediated activation process takes place (36Strongin A.Y. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I.

Docherty A.J.P. Reynolds J.J. Murphy G. Biochim. Biophys.

Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar). Activated MT-MMP can act as a cell surface receptor for TIMP-2, which in turn acts as a receptor for progelatinase A, the latter binding via its C domain (43Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). The interaction of progelatinase A with TIMP-2 appears to be specific in so far as a similar interaction does not take place between the latent enzyme and TIMP-1 as it does for gelatinase B (13Wilhelm S.M. Collier I.E. Marmer B.L. Eisen A.Z. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17213-17221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Goldberg G.I. Strongin A. Collier I.E. Genrich L.T. Marmer B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4583-4591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the binding properties of TIMP-3 and TIMP-4 to progelatinase A have not yet been ascertained. We have therefore investigated the binding of gelatinase A to the newly identified TIMP-4 protein and identified the site of interaction utilizing recombinant domains of the human enzyme. These investigations have demonstrated specific binding of TIMP-4 to both full-length progelatinase A and to the C domain, which is closely similar to that of the TIMP-2-progelatinase A interaction. Expression and purification of recombinant C domain (rC domain) and recombinant CBD (rCBD) was carried out essentially as described previously (14Steffensen B. Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11555-11566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 19Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7473-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, the recombinant protein encoding the C domain and linker (Gly417–Cys631, exons 9–13) and the CBD (Val191–Gln364, exons 5–7) of human gelatinase A were both expressed with a short NH2-terminal fusion tag that included an initiation methionine and a (His)6 tag, using the expression vector pGYMX (14Steffensen B. Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11555-11566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Inclusion bodies from LE392 Escherichia coli expressing the recombinant proteins were solubilized in 6 m guanidine HCl, and recombinant protein was refolded in 0.1 mNa2B4O7, pH 10, followed by dialysis into either 20 mm or 100 mmNa2HPO4·7H20, NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl. rC domain and rCBD were purified using Zn2+-charged chelating Sepharose 6B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) affinity chromatography essentially as described previously (14Steffensen B. Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11555-11566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 19Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7473-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). rCBD eluted from the Zn2+-chelate column was additionally applied to gelatin Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) to select functionally folded CBD from the Zn2+-chelating Sepharose elute (14Steffensen B. Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11555-11566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Protein yields were determined by the BCA assay (Pierce) and by spectroscopy after extinction coefficient determination (see below). Expression and purification of recombinant TIMP-4 protein was carried out according to Liu et al. 3Y. E. Liu, M. Wang, J. Greene, J. Su, S. Ullrich, H. Li, S. Sheng, P. Alexander, Q. A. Sang, and Y. E. Shi, submitted for publication. Briefly, the DNA sequence encoding TIMP-4 was ligated into the pA2-GP vector derived from pVL94 (46Luckow V.A. Summers M.D. Virology. 1989; 170: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and the vector was transfected into HB101 cells to produce recombinant baculovirus, which was then used to infect Sf9 insect cells. TIMP-4 was purified from the clarified cell supernatant by cation exchange, hydrophobic, and size exclusion chromatography columns. A soluble gelatin degradation assay (47Shi Y.E. Torri J. Yieh L. Wellstein A. Lippman M.E. Dickson R.B. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1409-1415PubMed Google Scholar) was used to assay for anti-MMP activity of the recombinant TIMP-4 during purification. 200 μg of purified TIMP-4 was obtained for analysis. Heat denatured protein samples were separated under reducing (65 mm dithiothreitol) or nonreducing conditions by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (48Laemmli U.U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) using 15% polyacrylamide gels. Protein bands were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Samples analyzed by enzymography were electrophoresed nonreduced on 10% polyacrylamide gels copolymerized with 40 μg/ml gelatin (49Overall C.M. Limeback H. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The mass of the rC domain was measured by electrospray mass spectrometry using a PESCIEX API 300 after sample injection on a C18 high pressure liquid chromatography column at 50 μl/min. 10 μl of rC domain in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (0.14 m NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4·7H20, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4) was subjected to amino acid analysis (amino acid analyzer from Applied Biosystems) using norleucine as an internal standard. The extinction coefficient was then determined from measurement of the pmol content of the protein sample. Binding of the rC domain to TIMP-4, TIMP-2, and TIMP-1 was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent type assay (14Steffensen B. Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11555-11566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a negative control. Purified recombinant TIMP-2 and purified natural TIMP-1 were kindly supplied by Dr. Y. DeClerck (Children's Hospital, Los Angeles, CA) and Dr. I. Clark (Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK), respectively. Each protein at 0.5 μg/well in 15 mmNa2CO3, 35 mm NaHCO3, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3, pH 9.6, was coated on 96-well microtiter plates for 18 h at 4 °C. Wells were blocked with 2.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.1% (w/v) NaN3 in PBS for 1 h at 21 °C. Serially diluted rC domain (7.1 × 10−10m to 1.15 × 10−5m) was added in 100 μl of PBS for 1 h at 21 °C followed by washing with PBS, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 to remove unbound protein. Bound rC domain was quantitated using affinity purified anti-peptide αHis6 antibody (19Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7473-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase conjugated secondary antibody (H & L chains, Bio-Rad Laboratories) and p-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium (Sigma) as substrate. Absorbance measurements (405 nm) were made in a microplate reader (Thermomax, Molecular Devices). Specificity was confirmed by comparing binding of the rC domain with that of the rCBD because both proteins contain the same fusion tag and were expressed in the same E. colistrain. Human recombinant full-length gelatinase A uncomplexed with TIMP-2 and predominantly in the latent form (M r = 72,000) (kindly supplied by Dr. R. Fridman, Department of Pathology, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI) was applied at approximately 2 μg in 100 μl of PBS to microwell plates coated with TIMP-4, TIMP-2, or TIMP-1 with gelatin as a positive control and myoglobin as a negative control (0.5 μg/well). Gelatin was prepared from purified acid-soluble rat tail tendon type I collagen by heat denaturation at 56 °C for 30 min. Rat progelatinase A complexed with TIMP-2 in 100 μl of conditioned culture medium from ROS 17/2.8 cells (see below) was also applied to identically coated plates. Microwell plates were incubated at 21 °C for 2 h followed by collection of unbound material for enzymogram analysis. Any remaining unbound and nonspecifically bound enzyme was removed by washing plates with PBS, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. Bound gelatinase A was solubilized in 50 μl of 2 m urea, 2% (w/v) SDS, 0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and analyzed by gelatin enzymography. Unbound enzyme was also prepared and analyzed using the same buffer. Binding and elution properties of the rC domain to TIMP-4 were also determined by affinity chromatography. A Zn2+-charged chelating Sepharose 6B minicolumn (V t = 75 μl) was equilibrated in PBS, and 50 μg of rC domain was applied. Saturation of the binding sites on the affinity matrix occurred resulting in a small amount of excess protein being recovered in the unbound material. 20 μg of purified TIMP-4 was applied, and elution was attempted with 1m NaCl in 20 mmNa2HPO4·7H20, NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3followed by 10% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide in PBS and finally with 50 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. Chromatography fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. ROS 17/2.8 cells were cultured in 75-cm2 flasks (Becton Dickinson Labware) in α-minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) newborn calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Confluent cells were washed twice in PBS, pH 7.4, and then cultured in serum-free medium with and without 20 μg/ml concanavalin A (Sigma). Conditioned culture medium was collected after an 18-h incubation to obtain active (41Overall C.M. Sodek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21141-21151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and latent secreted gelatinase A complexed with TIMP-2. In agreement with our previous studies (19Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7473-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), purified rC domain electrophoresed as a single band on 15% SDS-PAGE gels with an apparent M rof 26,500 under reducing condtions (Fig. 1 B). Western blot analysis using two anti-peptide antibodies (19Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7473-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) verified the identity of the purified protein (not shown). The presence of an intact disulfide bond (Cys440 and Cys631) was indicated by a downshift in apparent M r of 0.8 under nonreducing conditions (not shown). The absence of intermolecular disulfide-linked multimeric forms of the protein was shown by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting under nonreducing conditions. Electrospray mass spectrometry measured the precise mass of the protein to be 25,924 (within 1 Da of the predicted M r of 25,924.9 for the NH2-terminal methionine processed form), thereby confirming the fidelity of correct expression. The molar extinction coefficient determined from amino acid analysis of the purified protein was 5.10 × 104m−1cm−1. Saturable binding of the rC domain to TIMP-4 in PBS was found with an apparentK d of 1.7 × 10−7musing the microwell protein binding assay; bovine serum albumin was used as a negative control (Fig. 1 A). To confirm the TIMP-4-rC domain interaction, the binding of rC domain to TIMP-4 was investigated further by affinity chromatography. Fig. 1 Bshows that TIMP-4 was not detected in either the unbound fraction or in fractions eluted with 1 m NaCl or 10% dimethyl sulfoxide after application to a Zn2+-chelating Sepharose minicolumn saturated with rC domain. TIMP-4 was recovered from the column by elution with 50 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, together with the bound rC domain (Fig. 1 B). The binding of rC domain to TIMP-4 was compared with that to TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 using the microwell protein binding assay. Saturable binding to both TIMP-4 and TIMP-2 was observed (Fig. 2 A) with the apparent K d for the interaction with TIMP-2 being 0.66 × 10−7m (c.f. 1.7 × 10−7m for TIMP-4). These data indicate that both TIMP-4 and TIMP-2 bind the rC domain with similar high affinities but that the interaction with TIMP-2 was slightly stronger. No significant binding to TIMP-1 occurred (Fig. 2 A), demonstrating that interaction of the rC domain with TIMP-4 and TIMP-2 was specific. Moreover, because the rCBD from gelatinase A did not bind TIMP-4 (Fig. 2 B), this demonstrated that binding to TIMP-4 is mediated selectively by the C domain of gelatinase A. To investigate whether TIMP-4 and TIMP-2 bind at a common site on the gelatinase A C domain, 10 pmol of rC domain was incubated for 1 h at 21 °C in the presence of TIMP-2 (100, 40, 20, 10, 4, and 0 pmol). The reaction mix was then applied to microwell plates coated with TIMP-4 (0.5 μg, 20 pmol/well) for 1 h. Binding to TIMP-4 was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner by preincubation of the rC domain with increasing amounts of TIMP-2, and maximal inhibition was reached at a 2:1 molar ratio of TIMP-2 to rC domain (Fig. 3). Recombinant full-length progelatinase A uncomplexed with TIMP-2 was observed to bind TIMP-4 using the microwell protein binding assay (Fig.4 A), thereby confirming the biological relevance of the interaction found with the isolated rC domain. Binding to TIMP-2 and gelatin was also demonstrated (positive controls) but not to TIMP-1 and myoglobin (negative controls) (Fig. 4 A). Of note, the small amount of active enzyme present (M r = 59,000) was bound by gelatin but not by TIMP-4 or TIMP-2, indicating that the interaction observed for the proenzyme was not through the catalytic site. Proenzyme from concanavalin A treated and untreated ROS 17/2.8 cells also showed binding to TIMP-4, TIMP-2, and gelatin but no binding to TIMP-1 or myoglobin (Fig. 4 B). However, the quantity ofrecombinant progelatinase A activity binding to microwell plates was much greater than the enzyme activity bound from ROS 17/2.8 cell conditioned medium. Although not quantitative, this was indicated by the marked difference in enzymogram digestion times required to obtain visible lysis bands of bound enzyme: 18 h for conditioned medium and 1 h for recombinant enzyme. Indeed, the majority of progelatinase A from conditioned culture medium did not bind to the microwells as shown by enzymogram analysis of the enzyme before application (digestion time of 3.3 h) (Fig. 4 B). This indicates that most progelatinase A produced by ROS 17/2.8 cells is unavailable for binding to TIMPs, probably due to prior formation of a complex with TIMP-2. All members of the TIMP family are characterized by their ability to inhibit MMP activity by forming essentially irreversible 1:1 molar stoichiometric complexes with the active enzymes (20Cawston T.E.

Chem. 1991; 266: 3893-3899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the association of TIMPs with the proforms of the MMPs is more specific, and so far only two such interactions have been described: that of TIMP-2 with the proform of gelatinase A (22Stetler-Stevenson W.G.

In this report, we present evidence for the first time of a third TIMP-progelatinase interaction, that is, of the newly cloned TIMP-4 with progelatinase A. Binding of TIMP-2 to progelatinase A has been shown to occur via the C domain of the enzyme (17Murphy G. Willenbrock F. Ward R.V. Cockett M.I. Eaton D. Docherty A.J.P. Biochem.

(1997) in Inhibitors of Metalloproteinases in Development and Disease (Edwards, D., Hawkes, S., and Kokha, R., eds), in press.Google Scholar). Similarly, we have shown that both progelatinase A and the rC domain alone can bind TIMP-4, indicating that the binding site in the full-length proenzyme resides mainly or entirely within the C domain. The lack of binding of the rCBD to TIMP-4 demonstrates that this domain is unlikely to be involved in complex formation. However, the contribution of N domain binding sites elsewhere in the catalytic domain cannot be precluded, because for TIMP-2, the existence of such a site or sites on the proenzyme has been shown (50Fujimoto N. Ward R.V. Shinya T. Iwata K. Yamashita K. Hayakawa T. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 827-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the binding mechanism of TIMP-4 to the C domain of gelatinase A may be closely similar to that of TIMP-2. First, the K d equilibrium values for the binding of rC domain to immobilized TIMP-2 and TIMP-4 on microwell plates were comparable, although binding to TIMP-2 was slightly stronger. Secondly, the elution profile of TIMP-4 following application to rC domain immobilized on an affinity column was identical to that of TIMP-2 under the same experimental conditions (39Overall, C. M., Wallon, U. M., Steffensen, B., DeClerck, Y., Tschesche, H., and Abbey, R. S. (1997) in Inhibitors of Metalloproteinases in Development and Disease (Edwards, D., Hawkes, S., and Kokha, R., eds), in press.Google Scholar). In addition, preincubation of the rC domain with TIMP-2 (which would be expected to result in the formation of an rC domain-TIMP-2 complex) prevented subsequent binding to TIMP-4. This demonstrates that both inhibitors cannot bind simultaneously, suggesting the presence of a common or overlapping binding sites on the rC domain. Latent gelatinase A from ROS 17/2.8 cell conditioned culture medium is present mainly as an enzyme-TIMP-2 complex (22Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Krutzsch H.C. Liotta L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17374-17378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Goldberg G.I. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Eisen A.Z. Wilhelm S. He C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8207-8211Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The reduced binding of this enzyme to exogenous TIMP-4 and TIMP-2 therefore further indicates competition for a common or overlapping binding sites. However, the existence of separate sites in which binding of TIMP-2 blocks TIMP-4 binding, either by steric hinderance or by inducing a conformational change in the rC domain, cannot be precluded by our data. The apparent dissociation constant for binding of the rC domain to TIMP-2 (0.66 × 10−7m) is somewhat higher than that previously reported for the full-length enzyme or for the binding of the C domain to cells via TIMP-2 (34Howard E.W. Banda M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17972-17977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). This may be because additional interactions of TIMP-2 with other sites on the N domain outside of the active site and the CBD occur to increase the affinity of binding (50Fujimoto N. Ward R.V. Shinya T. Iwata K. Yamashita K. Hayakawa T. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 827-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Alternatively, in our experiments, TIMP-2 and TIMP-4 are bound to microwell plates, possibly via sites that are involved in binding to the rC domain, resulting in a weaker interaction. The location of the rC domain binding site on the TIMP-4 molecule requires further investigation; in the case of TIMP-2, a highly charged sequence QEFLDIEDP located at the COOH terminus of the inhibitor is proposed to occur as an exposed “tail” and to mediate binding to progelatinase A (37Willenbrock F. Crabbe T. Slocombe P.M. Sutton C.W. Docherty A.J.P. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M. Brocklehurst K. Phillips I.R. Murphy G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4330-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The homologous sequence in TIMP-4 (KEF V DIVQP) (31Greene J. Wang M. Liu Y.E. Raymond L.A. Rosen C. Shi Y.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30375-30380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) shares four conserved residues (bold type) and an additional two conservative substitutions (underlined), none of which are found in TIMP-1 or TIMP-3, suggesting that this sequence may be important in forming the binding site. The remaining nonconserved residues reduce the net negative charge of the peptide from −4 in TIMP-2 to −1 in TIMP-4, which may cause the binding of TIMP-4 to be weaker than that of TIMP-2. The location of binding sites for TIMP-2 and TIMP-4 on the rC domain are currently under investigation in our laboratory and appear to involve several positively charged clusters unique to gelatinase A on hemopexin-like modules III and IV. The findings of this study raise the important question of the physiological role of TIMP-4 binding to progelatinase A. TIMP-4 appears to mimic TIMP-2 in this capacity, thereby implying functional redundancy between the two inhibitors. However, the expression of TIMP-4 has been shown to be highly tissue-specific (31Greene J. Wang M. Liu Y.E. Raymond L.A. Rosen C. Shi Y.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30375-30380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 32Leco K.J. Apte S.S. Taniguchi G.T. Hawkes S.P. Khokha R. Schultz G.A. Edwards D.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) in contrast to TIMP-2, which is widely and constitutively expressed. This implies that TIMP-4 has a unique role that is distinct to that of TIMP-2. Binding of the C domain of progelatinase to TIMP-2 is required to mediate activation of the enzyme; this is believed to occur through the formation of a trimolecular complex of MT1-MMP, TIMP-2, and proenzyme on the cell membrane (43Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). We speculate that binding of progelatinase A to TIMP-4 could be involved in the formation of an alternative trimolecular complex, perhaps preferentially with one of the other MT-MMPs, giving rise to an alternative activation pathway which is functional only in tissues which express TIMP-4. Formation of the MT-MMP-TIMP-2-progelatinase A trimolecular complex appears to be sequential, such that preformed TIMP-2-progelatinase A complex will not bind (43Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar) and is therefore resistant to activation (36Strongin A.Y. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14033-14039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Ward R.V. Atkinson S.J. Slocombe P.M. Docherty A.J.P. Reynolds J.J. Murphy G.

Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). Hence, an alternative possibility is that complex formation between progelatinase A and TIMP-4 prevents the enzyme from association with membrane bound TIMP-2 and therefore blocks activation. Interestingly, the highest level of TIMP-4 expression is in the heart (31Greene J. Wang M. Liu Y.E. Raymond L.A. Rosen C. Shi Y.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30375-30380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), in which cancer metastasis rarely occurs, a process that is believed to involve the expression and activation of gelatinase A. Perhaps this is because the presence of excess TIMP-4 prevents gelatinase A activation via complex formation with the proenzyme. In summary, we have demonstrated specific, high affinity binding of the newly described inhibitor TIMP-4 to progelatinase A. Binding appears to occur mainly via the C domain of the enzyme and to resemble that of TIMP-2. Future work will address the sites of interaction of TIMP-4 on the C-domain of gelatinase A and the physiological significance of this phenomenon."

FPS is considered to play a key role in isoprenoid biosynthesis. We have reported previously that Arabidopsis thaliana contains two differentially expressed genes, FPS1 and FPS2, encoding two highly similar FPS isoforms, FPS1 and FPS2, (Cunillera, N., Arró, M., Delourme, D., Karst, F., Boronat, A., and Ferrer, A. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 7774–7780). In this paper we report the characterization of a novel ArabidopsisFPS mRNA (FPS1L mRNA) derived from the FPS1 gene. A cDNA corresponding to the FPS1L mRNA was cloned using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction strategy. Northern blot analysis showed that the two FPS1-derived mRNAs are differentially expressed. The FPS1L mRNA accumulates preferentially in inflorescences, whereas the previously reported FPS1 mRNA (FPS1S mRNA) is predominantly expressed in roots and inflorescences. FPS1L mRNA contains an in-frame AUG start codon located 123 nucleotides upstream of the AUG codon used in the translation of the FPS1S isoform. Translation of the FPS1L mRNA from the upstream AUG codon generates a novel FPS1 isoform (FPS1L) with an NH2-terminal extension of 41 amino acid residues, which has all the characteristics of a mitochondrial transit peptide.

The enzyme farnesyl-diphosphate synthase (FPS 1The abbreviations used are: FPS, farnesyl-diphosphate synthase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s).1The abbreviations used are: FPS, farnesyl-diphosphate synthase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s).; EC 2.5.1.1/EC 2.5.1.10) catalyzes the sequential 1′–4 condensation of two molecules of isopentenyl diphosphate with both dimethylallyl diphosphate and the resultant 10-carbon compound geranyl diphosphate to produce the 15-carbon compound farnesyl diphosphate (1Poulter C.D. Rilling H.C. Porter J.W. Spurgeon S.L. Biosynthesis of Isoprenoid Compounds. John Wiley and Sons, New York1981: 161-282Google Scholar). Because of the central branch point location of farnesyl diphosphate in the isoprenoid pathway, FPS is considered to play a key role in isoprenoid biosynthesis. It has been shown that in mammals FPS is a highly regulated enzyme involved in the control of the sterol biosynthetic pathway (2Clarke C.F. Tanaka R.D. Svenson K. Wamsley M. Fogelman A.M.

In plants, farnesyl diphosphate is the starting point of different branches of the isoprenoid pathway leading to the synthesis of key end products that are required for normal growth and development, such as phytosterols, dolichols, ubiquinone, plastoquinone, sesquiterpenoid phytoalexins, and prenylated proteins. Therefore, changes in FPS activity could alter the flux of isoprenoid compounds down the different branches of the pathway in competition for the available farnesyl diphosphate and, hence, play a central role in the regulation of a number of essential functions in plant cells (6Gray J.C. Adv. Bot. Res. 1987; 14: 25-91Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, more experimental data are still required before obtaining a clear picture of the regulatory significance of FPS in the overall control of isoprenoid biosynthesis in plants.Genomic and cDNA sequences encoding FPS have been isolated and characterized from a variety of organisms, ranging from bacteria to higher eukaryotes (7Chen A.

Although the complexity of the FPS gene families has been studied in a limited number of plants, it seems that plant FPS is encoded by multigene families like other key enzymes of the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway, such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (16Caelles C.

The pattern of expression of individual genes encoding FPS has been reported only in Arabidopsis, where it has been shown that the two currently characterized FPS genes (FPS1 and FPS2) are expressed differentially at both quantitative and qualitative levels (10Cunillera C. Arró M. Delourme D. Karst F. Boronat A. Ferrer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7774-7780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). At present, the biological significance of the occurrence of highly similar FPS isoforms in plants is still unclear, although the differential pattern of expression of the two FPS Arabidopsis genes suggests that each FPS isoform might have a specialized function in directing the flux of pathway intermediates into specific classes of isoprenoid end products.FPS has long been considered to be a cytoplasmic enzyme. However, it has recently been demonstrated that in mammals FPS is mainly localized within the peroxisomes (20Krisans S.K. Ericsson J. Edwards P.A. Keller G.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14165-14169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although significant levels of FPS activity have also been detected in rat liver mitochondria (21Runquist M. Ericsson J. Thelin A. Chojnacki T. Dallner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5804-5809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In plants, the only cell compartment where plant FPS has been detected is the cytosol (6Gray J.C. Adv. Bot. Res. 1987; 14: 25-91Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 22Hugueney P. Camara B. FEBS Lett. 1990; 273: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 23Kleinig H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 40: 39-59Crossref Google Scholar), although it is widely accepted that the enzymes utilizing isopentenyl diphosphate are distributed in three subcellular compartments, namely cytosol, mitochondria, and plastids. All of the FPS reported to date show high amino acid sequence similarity, and all contain several conserved domains, including the two aspartate-rich domains involved in substrate binding and enzyme catalysis (24Marrero P.F. Poulter C.D. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21873-21878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Joly A. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26983-26989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, none of the FPS characterized so far from a number of eukaryotic organisms (including fungi, plants, and animals) contains NH2-terminal sequences that could represent transit peptides for targeting into plastids or mitochondria. In this paper we report that the expression of the Arabidopsis FPS1gene generates a novel mRNA that encodes a mitochondrial FPS isoform.DISCUSSIONThe great complexity of the plant isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway has led to the suggestion that its regulation requires the coordinated activity of several key enzymes (6Gray J.C. Adv. Bot. Res. 1987; 14: 25-91Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 42McGarvey D.J. Croteau R. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 43Chappell J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 521-547Crossref Scopus (444) Google Scholar). FPS, a prenyltransferase that catalyzes the synthesis of farnesyl diphosphate from isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate, is considered to play a central role in the overall control of the plant isoprenoid pathway. This assumption has been primarily made on the basis that farnesyl diphosphate is the starting point of different branches of the plant isoprenoid pathway leading to the synthesis of essential end products (6Gray J.C. Adv. Bot. Res. 1987; 14: 25-91Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 42McGarvey D.J. Croteau R. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 43Chappell J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 521-547Crossref Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The proposed regulatory role of plant FPS is further supported by the observation that in mammals FPS is a highly regulated enzyme that plays a relevant role in the control of sterol biosynthesis (2Clarke C.F. Tanaka R.D. Svenson K. Wamsley M. Fogelman A.M. Edwards P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3138-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 3Rosser D.S.E. Ashby M.N. Ellis J.L. Edwards P.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 14462-14469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently shown that Arabidopsis contains a small FPS gene family consisting of at least two genes, FPS1and FPS2. These genes are differentially expressed and encode two highly similar FPS isoforms (10Cunillera C. Arró M. Delourme D. Karst F. Boronat A. Ferrer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7774-7780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). At least two FPS isoforms have also been reported to occur in other plant species (11Attucci S. Aitken S.M. Gulick P.J. Ibrahim R.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15Pan Z. Herickhoff L. Backhaus R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, the occurrence of FPS isoforms is a general feature of higher plants, although the specific role of each individual FPS isoform in the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway is currently unknown.In this paper we report that the expression of the Arabidopsis FPS1 gene generates a previously undetected mRNA that encodes a novel FPS1 isoform (FPS1L) with an NH2-terminal extension of 41 amino acids with respect to the FPS1 isoform (FPS1S) previously characterized (9Delourme D. Lacroute F. Karst F. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 1867-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 10Cunillera C. Arró M. Delourme D. Karst F. Boronat A. Ferrer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7774-7780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The occurrence of the FPS1L mRNA was demonstrated by the cloning of its corresponding cDNA. RNA blot analysis using a FPS1L mRNA-specific probe and anFPS1-derived probe that recognizes both FPS1S and FPS1L mRNAs simultaneously showed that FPS1S and FPS1L mRNAs are present in all tissues analyzed, although FPS1L mRNA accumulates preferentially in inflorescences, and FPS1S mRNA is mainly expressed in roots and inflorescences. The fact that theFPS1 gene generates two mRNAs that are also differentially expressed suggests that the two transcripts are under the control of alternative promoters. The results obtained in the RNase protection analysis show that FPS1S and FPS1L mRNAs have heterogeneous 5′-ends, which correlates with the lack of consensus TATA box located at appropriate distances from the corresponding transcription start sites.At the protein level, the novel Arabidopsis FPS1L isoform is identical in sequence to FPS1S but is extended at its NH2terminus by an additional sequence of 41 amino acids. This NH2-terminal extension has no counterpart among the FPS characterized so far from a number of eukaryotic organisms (7Chen A. Kroon P.A Poulter C.D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 600-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 8Homann V. Mende K. Arnts C. Ilardi V. Macino G. Morelli G. Böse G. Tudzynsky B. Curr.

Herickhoff L. Backhaus R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This observation raised the question about its possible function as a transit peptide for targeting the enzyme into subcellular organelles. The accumulation of sequence data on organellar transit peptides has revealed that these targeting sequences share a very low level of sequence conservation, although they have a number of common features in terms of amino acid composition, positional amino acid preferences, and secondary structure (35von Heijne G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar, 36von Heijne G. Genet. Eng. 1992; 14: 1-11Crossref Google Scholar). Interestingly, the FPS1L NH2-terminal extension nicely fits all known requirements to be a mitochondrial transit peptide. First, there is a lack of acidic amino acid residues and an enrichment in hydroxylated and hydrophobic residues. Second, the sequence motif RIQS, which fits the consensus mitochondrial targeting peptide cleavage motif RXXS (whereX represents any amino acid), is found just two residues upstream of the NH2-terminal methionine residue of FPS1S isoform. This motif is preceded by two arginine residues located at positions −2 and −12 from the putative cleavage site (RI/QS). It has been proposed that arginine residues located around positions −2 and −10 from the processing site play a role in defining the precise cleavage site of targeting peptides by mitochondrial matrix proteases (35von Heijne G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Third, secondary structure analysis indicates that a sequence of 10 amino acid residues located at the NH2-terminal part of the FPS1L NH2-terminal extension can potentially fold into a positively charged amphiphilic α-helix. Taken together, all these observations strongly suggested that the FPS1L NH2-terminal extension was a mitochondrial transit peptide.To analyze whether the FPS1L NH2-terminal extension could function as a mitochondrial transit peptide we first studied its ability to direct a passenger protein into yeast mitochondria in vivo. To this end, a construct expressing a chimeric protein containing the 41 NH2-terminal amino acid residues of FPS1L fused to the CoxIV subunit of yeast cytochrome c oxidase lacking its own mitochondrial transit peptide (plasmid pFPS1Ltp-ΔCOXIV) was assayed for its ability to complement the mutant yeast strain WSR. This strain is unable to grow in a medium containing glycerol as energy source because of a disruption of theCOXIV gene, which encodes the CoxIV subunit of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase. Plasmid pFPS1Ltp-ΔCOXIV completely restored the respiratory activity of strain WSR, thus indicating that the yeast CoxIV subunit was properly targeted into mitochondria. Since the interchangeability of mitochondrial transit peptides between plants and yeast is well documented (31Mireau H. Lancelin D. Small I. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1027-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 38Schmitz U.K. Lonsdale D.M. Plant Cell. 1989; 1: 783-791PubMed Google Scholar, 39Bowler C. Alliotte T. Van den Bulcke M.

Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 1249-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the observation that the NH2-terminal extension of the Arabidopsis FPS1L isoform acts as a mitochondrial transit peptide in yeast indicates thatArabidopsis FPS1L is the precursor of a mitochondrial FPS isoform. This fact was confirmed further by in vitro import studies of the Arabidopsis FPS1L into plant mitochondria.In vitro translated FPS1L protein was imported into purified potato mitochondria and processed to a mature mitochondrial FPS1 isoform of 40 kDa by cleavage of a transit peptide of approximately 4 kDa. From this result and assuming that FPS1L is processed by mitochondrial matrix proteases at the predicted processing site (see above), the mature mitochondrial FPS1 isoform would contain four additional amino acid residues at its NH2 terminus (QSSS) with respect to the FPS1S isoform.Our results indicate that Arabidopsis FPS1 is a bifunctional gene encoding cytosolic and mitochondrial FPS isoforms. Consequently,FPS1 belongs to the increasing group of eukaryotic genes encoding isozymes that perform analogous functions at different intracellular locations (44Danpure C.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 238Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These genes usually have more than one ATG start codon in their 5′-region and, depending on the translation start codon used to initiate translation of the corresponding mRNAs, have the potential to encode enzymes differing only at their NH2 terminus. These isozymes can be targeted to different intracellular compartments. Genes of this type have recently been reported in plants. For example, the Arabidopsis alanyl-tRNA synthetase gene encodes both mitochondrial and cytosolic forms of the enzyme (31Mireau H. Lancelin D. Small I. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1027-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and the Arabidopsis glutathione reductase gene encodes both mitochondrial and chloroplastic isoforms and possibly also a cytosolic isoform (45Creissen G. Reynolds H. Xue Y. Mullineaux P. Plant J. 1995; 8: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In the case of the Arabidopsis FPS1 gene, the strategy used to generate the cytosolic and the mitochondrial FPS1 isoforms is the use of alternative transcription start sites, resulting in the synthesis of mRNAs that differ in the presence or absence in the 5′-region of the sequence encoding the mitochondrial transit peptide. However, the in vitrotranslation results showed that FPS1L mRNA can give rise not only to the FPS1L isoform but also to significant levels of the FPS1S isoform. It is thus possible that the choice of cytosolic or mitochondrial location of FPS might involve not only the use of alternative transcription start sites but also a mechanism of AUG selection during the translation initiation process. It is remarkable that a similar situation has been reported to occur in theArabidopsis HMG1 gene, which encodes another key regulatory enzyme of the isoprenoid pathway (46Lumbreras V. Campos N. Boronat A. Plant J. 1995; 8: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This gene contains two alternative promoters that direct the expression of different mRNAs encoding two 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase isoforms (HMGR1L and HMGR1S), which differ only in the presence or absence of an NH2-terminal extension of 50 amino acids. In this case both 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase isoforms are targeted primarily to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, although it has been proposed that the different NH2-terminal sequences might direct each 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase isoform to specific subdomains of the endoplasmic reticulum (46Lumbreras V. Campos N. Boronat A. Plant J. 1995; 8: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 47Campos N. Boronat A. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 2163-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These observations give further support to the view that the regulation of plant isoprenoid biosynthesis is under the control of complex regulatory mechanisms operating at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional level.A general feature of the enzymes involved in plant isoprenoid biosynthesis is their occurrence in multiple isoforms (10Cunillera C.

Scolnick P.A. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Although the biological significance of this fact has not yet been fully evaluated, it is likely that the multiplicity of isoforms reflects the great complexity of plant isoprenoid biosynthesis, concerning not only the regulation of the overall pathway but also its subcellular compartmentalization. In contrast to the controversy surrounding the subcellular location of the enzymes involved in the synthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate in plants, it is widely accepted that the enzymes utilizing isopentenyl diphosphate are distributed in at least three cellular compartments: the cytosol, mitochondria, and plastids. However, the cytosol is the only cell compartment in which plant FPS has been detected (6Gray J.C. Adv. Bot. Res. 1987; 14: 25-91Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 22Hugueney P. Camara B. FEBS Lett. 1990; 273: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 23Kleinig H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 40: 39-59Crossref Google Scholar). It is worth noting that a significant level of FPS activity (approximately 13% of the total cellular FPS activity) has been detected in rat liver mitochondria (21Runquist M. Ericsson J. Thelin A. Chojnacki T. Dallner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5804-5809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, none of the previously reported FPS from a number of eukaryotic organisms (including fungi, plants, and animals) (7Chen A. Kroon P.A Poulter C.D.

TheArabidopsis FPS1L isoform described here represents the first reported eukaryotic FPS that contains a mitochondrial transit peptide. This finding reinforces the view that plant mitochondria can use isopentenyl diphosphate as a precursor for the synthesis of farnesyl diphosphate, which in turn could be utilized for the production of mitochondrial isoprenoid compounds such as ubiquinone, heme a, tRNA species, and prenylated proteins. On the basis of these observations, it is reasonable to speculate that FPS isoforms with mitochondrial targeting peptides might be found not only in other plant species but also in eukaryotic organisms other than plants. We are currently applying different molecular and cellular approaches to assess the possible regulatory role of FPS1L in the synthesis of mitochondrial isoprenoid compounds in plants. The enzyme farnesyl-diphosphate synthase (FPS 1The abbreviations used are: FPS, farnesyl-diphosphate synthase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s).1The abbreviations used are: FPS, farnesyl-diphosphate synthase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s).; EC 2.5.1.1/EC 2.5.1.10) catalyzes the sequential 1′–4 condensation of two molecules of isopentenyl diphosphate with both dimethylallyl diphosphate and the resultant 10-carbon compound geranyl diphosphate to produce the 15-carbon compound farnesyl diphosphate (1Poulter C.D.

We have developed a novel transfection method using cationic amphiphilic α-helical oligopeptides with repeated sequences. Oligopeptide has the advantages of being easily designed and modified because of its simple structure. In this study, we synthesized five kinds of peptides of which the total chain length and the width of the hydrophobic region were changed. The binding of the peptides to plasmid DNA was evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis. It was found that the long and/or hydrophobic peptides can strongly bind to the DNA. The formation of large aggregates with a 0.5–5-μm diameter, which consisted of the long peptides and the DNA, was observed by electron microscopy. The transfection abilities of the peptides were determined by the expression of luciferase from its cDNA in COS-7 cells. The long peptides showed high transfection abilities. As a result, it could be said that the transfection ability of these peptides was parallel to their ability to form aggregates with DNA. Furthermore, the transfection ability was increased by the addition of chloroquine in the transfection procedure. This result indicated that the internalization of the peptide-DNA aggregates would be mediated by the endocytosis pathway.

Gene transfer techniques have caused an important advance in the treatment of both inherited and acquired diseases. Most ongoing gene therapy protocols rely on recombinant retrovirus, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, etc., which have a number of advantages for gene transfer because of their general efficiency and wide range of cell targets (1Samulski R.J.

However, there were some problems with these protocols, i.e. difficulty in insertion of large size DNA fragments into the gene, the possible production of replication-competent viruses by recombination, generation of several types of immune response, and oncogenic effects by random insertion into the host genome (5Cornetta K.

To avoid such problems, the development of nonviral gene transfer techniques has been also encouraged, particularly the use of cationic lipid and polycation such as polylysine. Many gene transfer techniques using cationic lipids bearing essentially a single tertiary or quaternary ammonium head group have been tested in vitro (7Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R.

In these works, the gene transferred into cells was found to be extensively degraded in the acidic lysosomal compartment. Recently, effective gene transfer has been achieved using a hemisynthetic virus that was prepared by coupling polylysine-asialoorosomucoid with adenovirus (21Wu G.Y. Zhan P. Sze L.L. Rosenberg A.R. Wu C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11542-11546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and using a complex of DNA, polylysine-transferrin, and fusogenic peptide (22Plank C. Oberhauser B. Mechtler K. Koch C. Wagner E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12918-12924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As synthetic vectors for nonviral gene transfer techniques, various complexes have been used. These were usually made by a combination of several functional groups or compounds that were able to transfer genes into the targeted cell and to perturb the lysosomal membrane to avoid degradation of the gene in the lysosome. However, the design of the synthetic vectors is generally complicated due to the introduction of several functional compounds such as glycoprotein and the fusogenic peptide. For the purpose of further study of the gene transfer system based on polycationic reagent, here we investigated gene transfer into cells using simple molecules, i.e. cationic oligopeptides that have the potential to take an α-helical structure. Previously, we studied perturbation and fusion of phospholipid membrane by cationic amphiphilic α-helical model peptides and elucidated the relationship between their structure and function (23Suenaga M.

Acta. 1993; 1151: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined the correlation between DNA binding ability of the peptides or morphology in the peptide-DNA aggregation and their transfection ability. The results indicated that the cationic amphiphilic α-helical peptides were highly efficient in transferring genes into cultured cells and that their transfection ability increased with their ability to cause aggregation. Reagents used for the synthesis and analysis were of reagent grade. Amino acid derivatives were purchased from Watanabe Chemical (Hiroshima, Japan). Poly-l-lysine (15–30 kDa) was purchased from Sigma, and plasmid DNA that contained a luciferase gene and SV40 promoter (PicaGene control vector, PGV-C) 1The abbreviations used are: PGV-C, PicaGene control vector; MTT, 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide. was from Toyo Ink (Tokyo, Japan). Closed circular plasmid DNA was purified by ultracentrifugation in CsCl gradients. Lipofectin was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The peptides were prepared by solid phase synthesis using oxime resin (26Degrado W.F. Kaiser E.T. J. Org. Chem. 1980; 45: 1295-1300Crossref Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 27Kaiser E.T. Mihara H.

Perkin Trans. I. 1995; 2: 1133-1140Crossref Google Scholar). The synthesized peptides were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography with reversed-phase column (YMC-Pack ODS A-323 or YMC-Pack C4A-823, 10 × 250 mm). Elution was carried out with a linear gradient established between 50 and 100% acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid for 30 min monitored at 220 nm. The final products were identified by elemental analysis, amino acid analysis, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry using a Shimadzu Kratos Kompact MALDI III apparatus. The tests were performed by mixing 0.5 μg of the plasmid DNA (PGV-C) with the peptides, in which the positive (peptide):negative (DNA) charge ratios were 0, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0, respectively, in 45 μl of HBS (21 mm Hepes-NaOH buffer containing 135 mm NaCl, 5.0 mm KCl, and 0.76 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.4). After 30 min at room temperature, 5 μl of a solution of 10 mmMgCl2 and 10 mm CaCl2 was added, followed by 5 μl of 0.5 μg/ml DNase I (Worthington, DPPF grade) in water. After 30 min at 42 °C, 50 μl of a stop solution consisting of 4 m ammonium acetate, 20 mm EDTA, and 2 mg/ml glycogen was added, and the reaction mixture was placed on ice. To dissociate the plasmid DNA from the peptide, 15 μl of 1% SDS was added prior to extraction with TE-saturated phenol/chloroform, followed by ethanol precipitation. The final pellet was resuspended in 25 μl of dye mixture (TBE, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 5% glycerol). TBE consists of 90 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. The aliquot of 5.0 μl was applied to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. CD spectra were recorded on a JASCO J-720W spectropolarimeter using a quartz cell of 1.0-mm path length. The peptides were dissolved at a concentration of 10 μmin HBS. Measurements were performed in the presence of the plasmid DNA at a peptide:DNA charge ratio of 1.0 and in the absence of the plasmid DNA. Samples were prepared by mixing 63 μm of peptide (per cationic charge concentration) and 10 μg/ml plasmid DNA in HBS at final concentrations. These were then left standing for 30 min at room temperature. Peptide-DNA complexes were processed for transmission electron microscopy using a negative stain technique. Fifteen-μl drops of freshly prepared samples were placed on glow-discharged carbon-coated 200-mesh copper grids for 3 min. Solution was wicked off with filter paper and replaced with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate for 30 s. After removal of the solution, grids were rinsed in distilled water and allowed to dry. Grids were imaged in a JEOL JEM-100CX transmission electron microscope. COS-7 cells, a simian kidney cell line transformed with simian virus 40 (SV40), were grown to just before confluence in 16-mm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C, and washed twice with 1 ml of HBS. Plasmid DNA in 125 μl of HBS and peptide in 125 μl of HBS were mixed and allowed to stand for 15 min at room temperature. The mixture was poured gently onto the cells. After incubation for 3 h at 37 °C, 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum was added. The medium was replaced with 1 ml of a fresh medium after 12 h, and the cells were incubated for 48 h from the first addition of the medium. Treatment of the cells with chloroquine was performed at 100 μm during transfection procedure. Harvesting of cells and luciferase assays were performed 48 h after transfection as described in the protocol of PicaGene luminescence kit (Toyo Ink; Tokyo, Japan). The light units were analyzed by luminometer (Maltibiolumat LB9505, Berthold, Germany). The light unit values shown in the figures represent the specific luciferase activity (cpm/mg of protein) which is standardized for total protein content of the cell lysate. The measurement of gene transfer efficiency was performed in triplicate. As shown in Fig. 1, peptides 43 and 46, which were previously synthesized, take an amphiphilic α-helical structure. These consist of 12 and 24 residues, respectively, with a repeat of tetrapeptide units (23Suenaga M. Lee S. Park N.G. Aoyagi H. Kato T. Umeda A. Amako K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 981: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 24Agawa Y. Lee S. Ono S. Aoyagi H. Ohno M. Taniguchi T. Anzai K. Kirino Y. J. Biol.

Acta. 1993; 1151: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Peptides 43S and 46S were designed on the basis of 43 and 46 sequences so as to reduce the hydrophobicity of 43 and 46 by introducing 3 and 6 hydrophilic Ser residues, respectively, instead of hydrophobic Leu and Ala residues. As a consequence, the hydrophilic region of the helix was increased from ¼ in 43 and 46 to ½ in 43S and 46S. Peptide 46P contains the Pro8-Pro9sequence, which can disrupt α-helical structure, instead for Leu8-Leu9 of 46 in the middle of the peptide chain. The 43 and 46 series peptides have 3 and 6 residues of cationic amino acid (Arg), respectively, in the molecules. The peptide-DNA complex formation was examined by the electrophoretic mobility of the complex on an agarose gel (1%, w/v) stained with ethidium bromide at the various ratio of peptides to a double-stranded DNA. The tests were performed by mixing 0.1 μg of the plasmid DNA (PGV-C) with the peptides, in which the positive (peptide)/negative (DNA) charge ratios were 0, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 8.0, respectively (Fig.2 A). In the case of 43, no migration of the plasmid DNA band occurred at charge ratio of 2.0. This lack of migration was due to neutralization of nucleic acid by cationic peptide and/or formation of a large complex between the peptide and the DNA. Peptide 43S gave no effect on migration of the DNA. The long peptides, 46, 46S, and 46P, suppressed the migration of the DNA at charge ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.0, respectively. These results indicated that peptides with long length and large hydrophobic region strongly bound to the plasmid DNA. Introduction of proline residues, which breaks the α-helical structure, at the center of 46 slightly reduced the binding ability. When peptides bind to the plasmid DNA, it is expected that digestion of the DNA by DNase I will be inhibited. The DNA binding abilities of the peptides were evaluated by the nuclease-inhibitory activities. After adding the peptides to the plasmid DNA at various charge ratios, the mixtures were incubated with DNase I. After undigested DNA was extracted, the DNA was analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2 B). In the cases of 43, 46, 46S, and 46P, the bands of the DNA were remarkably detected at a charge ratio of 2.0, 0.25, 1.0, and 0.25, respectively. In each case, the band upper to the position of supercoiled plasmid DNA appeared. It was considered that the upper bands corresponded to the position of the nicked or linearized DNA digested by the nuclease at one site. However, 43S offered no resistance to digestion of the DNA by the nuclease. In the case of 46, the upper band was scarcely detected at a charge ratio of 4.0. These findings indicated that 46 had the strongest binding ability to the plasmid DNA and were consistent with the results from the agarose gel shift assay described above. To analyze the structural features of these peptides that bound to the plasmid DNA, CD spectra of the peptides were measured. In these measurements, it was hard to analyze spectra under 205 nm due to large absorbance. As shown in Fig.3 A, 46 showed a typical α-helix CD pattern with double minima at 208 and 222 nm in the HBS. The ellipticity at 222 nm indicated that the peptide took an almost complete α-helical structure (>95%). The helical content of 46S and 46P was lower than that of 46. An increase in the hydrophilic region or the introduction of proline residues into peptides, which disrupts α-helical structure, actually reduced the α-helicity of the peptides. Peptides 43 and 43S took mainly a random coil structure in the HBS. In the presence of the plasmid DNA at charge ratio of 1.0, 43S took a slightly α-helical structure (<20%) (Fig.3 B), while the helical content of 43 was remarkably increased by the addition of the DNA. This result means that 43 binds to the plasmid DNA with a stable α-helical structure. Peptides 46, 46S, and 46P showed a large valley at 222 nm, and another valley at 208 nm became shallower. This spectrum would mean aggregation of peptide with DNA as described by Yoshimura et al. (29Yoshimura T. Goto Y. Aimoto S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6119-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Peptide 46P also showed a large valley at 222 nm, but its depth was shallower than that of 46 and 46S. It is possible that two proline residues in the center of 46P effectively broke the α-helical structure in binding to the DNA. To assess the structure of the peptide-DNA complexes, we used transmission electron microscopy with negative staining. Fig. 4 A shows the free plasmid DNA without peptide, and Fig. 4, B and C, shows complexes of 46 and the plasmid DNA at a charge ratio of 2.0. Interestingly, aggregates with a diameter of 0.5–5 μm were found. Although there were several shapes in aggregates, twisted fiber-like structures were common. The peptides 46S, 46P, and 43 except for 43S caused aggregation analogous with that of 46 (Fig. 4,D–F). Although 43 generated similar aggregations as 46, 46S, and 46P, the population of the aggregates was lower. The results indicated that most of the complex of 43 and the plasmid DNA was dissolved in HBS without forming large aggregates, because 43indicated the typical α-helical CD pattern in the presence of DNA despite no strong aggregation with DNA. Furthermore, in the case of 46, the aggregates were found at a peptide:DNA charge ratio of 0.50, while no aggregate was found at a charge ratio of 0.10. These results were consistent with those from the agarose gel shift assay and DNase I protection assay. We furthermore found that the formation of aggregates was inhibited by reduction of sodium chloride concentration in buffer solution (data not shown). This result indicates that not only electrostatic interaction but also hydrophobic interaction between peptide and DNA is necessary for the formation of complex and aggregate. The mechanism of formation of large aggregates by peptide and DNA would be explained as follows. 1) Positive charges of the arginine residues in the peptides stand in line by taking an α-helical structure and electrostatically interact with the negative charge of phosphate in DNA. 2) Formation of a hydrophobic face on the opposite side of the DNA-binding face in an α-helix peptide causes hydrophobic interaction between peptide-DNA complexes, and the interaction results in aggregation. The efficiency of these peptides in the transfection of COS-7 cells was tested with the plasmid DNA that contains a reporter gene encoding firefly luciferase. The efficiencies of the peptides in the expression of luciferase were determined at 48 h after transfection by measurements of the total enzyme activity in the cell extracts of the cultured cells using a luminometer. In Fig. 5, the cross-hatched barshows the transfection efficiency of the peptides when the peptides were mixed with 2.5 μg of the plasmid DNA at a charge ratio of 2.0 without chloroquine treatment. In these cases, 125 μl of 126 μm (cationic charge concentration) peptides and 125 μl of 20 μg/ml plasmid DNA were mixed, and the mixture was added to the COS-7 cells in a 16-mm dish. Peptides 43 and 43S were found to exhibit no transfection ability, while the long peptides 46, 46S, and 46P had remarkable abilities; in particular, 46 had 11- and 6-fold higher abilities compared with those of 46S and 46P, respectively. To examine the efficiency of other DNA carrier molecule, we used poly-l-lysine as a cationic polypeptide. The poly-l-lysine was found to exhibit the same transfection ability as that of 46S. However, the efficiencies of methods using calcium phosphate and cationic liposome (Lipofectin) were 3- and 5-fold higher, respectively, than that of 46. Cytotoxic activities of the peptides and the complex of the peptides and the plasmid DNA were also evaluated by the MTT assay (30Hansen M.B. Nielsen S.E. Berg K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 119: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar). Cell viabilities in the presence of 43, 46, and 46P at a concentration of 65 μm (cationic charge) decreased to about 40, 50, and 40%, respectively. On the other hand, the peptide-plasmid DNA complexes at a charge ratio of 2 had high cell viability of about 80% at the same peptide concentration (Fig.6). It was clear that the binding of the plasmid DNA to the peptides reduced the cytotoxity of the peptides. As shown in Fig. 5 (open bar), concurrent treatment of the cells with chloroquine, which may inhibit the degradation of the DNA by lysosomal hydrolases, made the efficiencies of all peptides increase remarkably. The gene transfer efficiencies of the long peptides (46, 46S) were 30–200-fold higher than those of the short peptides (43, 43S). Surprisingly, the treatment with chloroquine increased the efficiency of 46P by about 400-fold. In this condition, cell viabilities were reduced by 5–25% compared with in the absence of chloroquine treatment (Fig. 6). Since the increase in transfection efficiencies by the addition of the chloroquine was considerably higher than that in the cytotoxity, it could be said that the increase in the transfection efficiency, which is standardized for total protein content of the cell lysate, is not due to a decrease in living cells. These findings indicated that internalization of the peptide-DNA aggregates was mediated by endocytosis pathway. That 46 has the highest transfection efficiency in the absence of chloroquine treatment can be explained by the fact that 46 can bind more strongly to the plasmid DNA and more efficiently inhibits degradation of the DNA by DNase I compared with 46S and 46P. As a consequence, a large amount of the DNA could survive in the lysosomal vesicles. On the other hand, 43 had little transfection ability, although this peptide could bind to DNA. It could be considered that most of aggregates were degraded in the lysosomal vesicles because 43 could not protect the DNA from DNase digestion adequately, although the aggregates of 43 and DNA might be incorporated into cells. It is clear that 43S lacked transfection ability because it could not bind to DNA. In the presence of chloroquine, degradation of incorporated DNA was restrained. Therefore, transfection efficiency of any peptide was increased. The efficiencies of 46 and 46S were similar, suggesting that both peptides caused similar aggregations and that the aggregates were incorporated with the same efficiency. On the other hand, 46P, which had a similar aggregation pattern to that of 46 and 46S, showed remarkably stronger transfection efficiency. Since 46P had stronger membrane perturbation activity compared with 46 and 46S, 2T. Niidome, N. Ohmori, A. Ichinose, A. Wada, H. Mihara, T. Hirayama, and H. Aoyagi, unpublished data. it is likely that a large amount of DNA could be transferred from endosomal vesicles to cytosol without remarkable degradation of the plasmid DNA. These results indicated that transfer of the peptide-DNA complex from the endosomal compartment to the cytosol is an important step for efficient expression of the gene in the presence of chloroquine. Therefore, it is possible that transfection efficiency depends on endosomal or lysosomal membrane perturbation activity of the peptide. Further investigation will be necessary for pursuing the localization of incorporated DNA in the cell. The effect of the amount of 46 and the plasmid DNA on the transfection efficiency is shown in Fig. 7. The most effective transfection occurred when 2.5 μg of the plasmid DNA and 2.6 nmol of 46 were mixed. Furthermore, in any amount of the DNA, the peptide:DNA mixing ratio was optimum at 2.0. When the peptide:DNA charge ratio was smaller than 2.0, the efficiencies were low. It is probable that transfection-competent aggregates of peptide and DNA were hardly formed. Reduction of the efficiency at the higher amounts of both peptide and DNA than those at optimum conditions suggests that aggregates too large for endocytosis were formed because of the high concentration of both peptide and DNA. When the peptide:DNA charge ratio was higher than 2.0, the transfection efficiencies were also reduced. This was due to the cytotoxic activities of the excess free peptides that remained in the solution. In this study, we examined some abilities of amphiphilic α-helical oligopeptides containing cationic amino acid as a gene carrier molecule. These peptides transferred plasmid DNA into cells and demonstrated high expression of protein encoded in the plasmid DNA. In particular, the peptides having a continuous large hydrophobic region, i.e. 46, could form stable aggregation with the plasmid DNA and also efficiently transfer the DNA into cells. Furthermore, this study indicated that membrane perturbation activity of the peptide also was important for the efficient transfection."

S-AKAP84, one of three RII-binding proteins encoded by a single-copy murine gene, was studied as a prototypic organelle-associated AKAP. When S-AKAP84 was expressed in HEK293 cells, the anchor protein was targeted to mitochondria and excluded from other cell compartments. The RII tethering site is located in the cytoplasm adjacent to the mitochondrial surface. Endogenous RII subunits are not associated with mitochondria isolated from control cells. Expression of S-AKAP84 in transfected HEK293 cells triggered a redistribution of 15% of total RII to mitochondria. Thus, the tethering region of the organelle-inserted anchor protein is properly oriented and avidly binds RII (PKAII) isoforms in intact cells. Two critical domains in S-AKAP84 were mapped. Residues 1 to 30 govern insertion of the polypeptide into the outer mitochondrial membrane; amino acids 306–325 constitute the RII-binding site.

Therefore, anchored PKAII is placed in proximity with a signal generator (hormone/neurotransmitter-activated adenylate cyclase) and multiple PKA substrate/effector proteins (e.g. myosin light chain kinase, microtubule-associated protein-2, ion channels, serpentine receptors that couple with the GTP-binding protein Gs).

Otherwise, sequences of non-neuronal AKAPs diverge among themselves and differ from the sequence of AKAP75.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9460-9465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, an experimental demonstration that an anchor protein governs accumulation of RII subunits at a specific location within intact cells has been accomplished only for neuronal AKAP75 (9Li Y. Ndubuka C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16862-16869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar,12Ndubuka C. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7621-7624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AKAP75 targets RII to sites in cytoskeleton. We lack knowledge of the (a) abilities of non-neuronal AKAPs to sequester RII subunits from cytoplasmic (or other) pools in situ and (b) efficiency and selectivity with which AKAP·RII complexes are anchored at organelles (rather than cytoskeleton) in intact cells. S-AKAP84 is a novel, organelle-associated RII-binding protein that is expressed in male germ cells (10Lin R.-Y. Moss S.B. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27804-27811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). S-AKAP84 has an RII tethering site, a leucine-zipper segment, and a predicted, N-terminal targeting/anchoring domain (10Lin R.-Y. Moss S.B. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27804-27811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Biogenesis of S-AKAP84 is coordinated with the appearance of RIIα subunits (PKAIIα) during a late stage of spermiogenesis (10Lin R.-Y. Moss S.B. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27804-27811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 13Lonnerberg P. Parvinen M. Jahnsen T. Hansson V. Persson H. Biol.

Fertil. 1993; 99: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Moreover, RII subunits are co-localized with S-AKAP84 as round spermatids differentiate into condensing spermatids, which contain a distinct flagellum. Newly-synthesized S-AKAP84 is incorporated into pre-existing mitochondria, which migrate to a location at which the flagellar cytoskeleton is assembled (15Clermont Y. Oko R. Hermo L. Desjardins C. Ewing L.L. Cell and Molecular Biology of the Testis. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 332-376Google Scholar). A plausible model suggests that S-AKAP84 binds cytoplasmic PKAIIα and anchors the kinase via insertion of its N-terminal targeting domain into the outer membrane of mitochondria (10Lin R.-Y. Moss S.B. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27804-27811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Anchored PKAIIα is optimally positioned to phosphorylate proteins on the mitochondrial surface and components of microtubule motor systems, thereby regulating mitochondrial translocation to the site of cytoskeleton assembly. Insertion of S-AKAP84·RIIα into the outer mitochondrial membrane ensures delivery of PKAIIα to the midpiece of the flagellum (16Lieberman S.J. Wasco W. MacLeod J. Satir P. Orr G.A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1809-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), where catalytic subunits will be juxtaposed with substrate/effector proteins in the cytoskeleton. Cyclic AMP-stimulated phosphorylation of target proteins presumably promotes sperm motility by eliciting sliding of an external cytoskeletal structure (fibrous sheath) over an internal microtubular structure (16Lieberman S.J. Wasco W. MacLeod J. Satir P. Orr G.A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1809-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 17Tash J.S. Means A.R. Biol.

Res. 1993; 208: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The preceding model remains tentative because predicted properties of S-AKAP84 have not been established in the context of intact cells. Critical questions are: does S-AKAP84 alone contain sufficient information to undergo selective targeting to mitochondria? Alternatively, are additional spermatid proteins required to promote association of S-AKAP84 with mitochondria? Is S-AKAP84 inserted via its predicted N-terminal targeting domain, leaving the remainder of the protein (including the RII tethering site) accessible to cytoplasm? Does S-AKAP84 bind RII subunits with sufficient affinity in situ to effect a redistribution of PKAII isoforms to mitochondria? Is S-AKAP84 targeted to mitochondria or dispersed in multiple cell compartments? Does the putative leucine-zipper domain of S-AKAP84 facilitate anchoring of PKAII isoforms? Finally, detection of a discrete RII-binding protein that is antigenically related to S-AKAP84 in spermatozoa (10Lin R.-Y. Moss S.B. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27804-27811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) raises the following queries: Are there multiple isoforms of S-AKAP84 proteins? If so, what is the molecular basis for their origin? We now describe experiments that address and resolve questions posed above. The results define structure-function relationships for S-AKAP84in situ and support the S-AKAP84 functional model. In addition, insights were gained regarding the ability of a non-neuronal AKAP to selectively bind and target PKAII isoforms to an organelle in the context of the internal milieu of intact cells. Complementary DNA encoding human S-AKAP84 (10Lin R.-Y. Moss S.B. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27804-27811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) was digested with NdeI and the resulting 1.8-kilobase pair fragment was used as a template to generate a random-primed,32P-labeled probe. This probe was used to screen a mouse testis cDNA library in bacteriophage λgt11 (CLONTECH) as indicated previously (20Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hu E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Positive recombinant phage clones were plaque purified and cDNAs (0.9–2.9 kilobase pair) were subcloned in plasmids pGEM7Z (Promega) and pBluescript (Stratagene) and sequenced. Partial cDNA sequences were identical with portions of the largest cDNA. Overall, the complete sequence for each DNA strand was determined twice. cDNAs were sequenced by a dideoxynucleotide chain termination procedure (22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52668) Google Scholar) using T7, SP6, and custom oligonucleotide primers. Taq Dye Deoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kits (Applied Biosystems) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA products were separated and analyzed in a model 377 automated DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems) at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine DNA Analysis Facility. Analysis of sequence data, sequence comparisons, and data base searches were performed using PCGENE-IntelliGenetics software (IntelliGenetics, Mountainview, CA) and the BLAST and FASTA programs (23Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad, Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9381) Google Scholar, 24Altschul S.R. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70715) Google Scholar) provided by the NCBI server at the National Library of Medicine/National Institutes of Health. Complementary DNAs corresponding to 5′-terminal regions of mouse S-AKAP84 and AKAP121 mRNAs were synthesized, amplified, cloned, and sequenced as detailed in Land et al. (20Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14820-14827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two rounds of amplification, via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), were used to obtain cDNAs. The 5′ primer (5′-ATTAGCGGC2CGCT17-3′) contained a NotI restriction site and a poly(dT) tail that hybridizes with dA residues appended to the antisense cDNA strand via terminal transferase (20Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The initial 3′ primer (5′-GCTGCTCTTCCCTTCCAGG AGGCTGTG-3′) corresponds to the inverse complement of nucleotides 406 to 432 in S-AKAP84 cDNA (Fig. 1 A). The second 3′ primer (5′-GTACGAGCTCGGGGGCCACACAGAAC-3′) contained the inverse complement of nucleotides 381 to 399 in S-AKAP84 cDNA. Nucleotides 5–10 of the second 3′ primer constitute a SacI recognition sequence. After digestion with NotI and SacI, amplified cDNAs were cloned into plasmid pGEM7Z and sequenced. A cDNA fragment (nucleotides 1744–2225, Fig. 1 A) was generated by digestion withSacI and NcoI and was cloned in pGEM5Z. Recombinant plasmid was linearized by digestion with NcoI and 32P-labeled antisense RNA was synthesized by bacteriophage SP6 RNA polymerase as described previously (25Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14820-14827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antisense RNA contains overlapping sequences of 397, 345, and 260 nucleotides, that are complementary to corresponding regions in S-AKAP84, AKAP100, and AKAP121 mRNAs, respectively. RNase protection analysis was performed as described previously (20Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14820-14827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 20 μg of total RNA from mouse germ cells (10Lin R.-Y. Moss S.B. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27804-27811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 26Carrera A. Gerton G.L. Moss S.B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 272-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). A 741-bp fragment of S-AKAP84 cDNA (nucleotides 810–1550, Fig.1 A) was amplified by PCR, using primers that appended a 5′NdeI site and a 3′ BamHI site. Amplified cDNA was digested with NdeI and BamHI and cloned into the pET14b expression plasmid (Novagen), which was cleaved by the same enzymes. This placed cDNA encoding amino acids 205–451 of S-AKAP84 downstream from the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and 20 codons that direct the synthesis of an N-terminal fusion peptide. The peptide contains a stretch of six consecutive His residues, which form a nickel-binding domain. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) was transformed with the expression plasmid and induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h at 37 °C. The bacterium contains a chromosomal copy of the phage T7 RNA polymerase gene under the control of the lacpromoter. Bacteria were harvested, disrupted, and separated into soluble and particulate fractions as described previously (20Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Soluble S-AKAP84 fusion protein was purified to near-homogeneity by nickel-chelate chromatography (27Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1935-1944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Approximately 2 mg of purified S-AKAP84 fusion protein was obtained from a 500-ml culture of E. coli. S-AKAP84 fusion protein was injected into rabbits (0.35 mg initial injection; 0.2 mg for each of three booster injections) at Hazelton Corning Laboratories (Vienna, VA) to generate antisera. Serum was collected at 3-week intervals. A 2.8-kb cDNA containing an uninterrupted coding region for AKAP121 was excised from pGEM7Z by digestion with HindIII andXhoI. The insert was cloned into the expression plasmid pCEP4 (Invitrogen), which was cleaved with the same restriction enzymes. This placed the cDNA downstream from a constitutive cytomegalovirus promoter and upstream from a polyadenylation signal. pCEP4 also contains a bacterial hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene under the regulation of a strong, viral thymidine kinase promoter. The AKAP121 coding region (2571 bp, 857 amino acids) in the cDNA insert was flanked by a 145-bp 5′-untranslated region and the 3′-untranslated region shown in Fig. 1 A. A 1.9-kb cDNA that directs the synthesis of S-AKAP84 was also cloned in pCEP4. S-AKAP84 cDNA contains an internal, alternative exon (nucleotides 1774–1880, Fig.1 A) that introduces a proximal stop codon. It encodes a protein composed of 547 residues. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293 cells) were grown and transfected as described previously (9Li Y. Ndubuka C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16862-16869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 12Ndubuka C. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol.

Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7621-7624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytosolic and particulate fractions of HEK293 cells were isolated as indicated previously (28Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with one modification. Triton X-100 was omitted from cell lysis buffer. Highly purified mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation and sedimentation through a Percoll gradient as described by Hoviaset al. (29Hovias R. Lambrechts H. Nicolay K. de Kruiff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1021: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c oxidase activity was determined spectrophotometrically by following the decrease in cytochrome c absorbance at 550 nm (30Wharton D.C. Tzagoloff A. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 245-250Crossref Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). Samples of proteins (20–50 μg) from cell fractions were denatured in gel loading buffer and subjected to electrophoresis in a 9% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS as described previously (31Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase (M r = 116,000), phosphorylase (97,000), transferrin (77,000), albumin (67,000), ovalbumin (43,000), and carbonic anhydrase (29,000) were used as standards for estimation of M r values. Western blots of the size-fractionated proteins were blocked, incubated with antiserum directed against epitopes included in both S-AKAP84 and AKAP121 (1:2000), and washed as described previously (12Ndubuka C. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7621-7624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anchor proteins were visualized and quantified by an indirect chemiluminescence procedure as previously reported (12Ndubuka C. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7621-7624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were fixed, washed, and incubated sequentially with antibodies against S-AKAP84, and then fluorescein isothiocyanate-tagged goat IgGs directed against rabbit immunoglobulins, as described by Li et al. (9Li Y. Ndubuka C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16862-16869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Prior to fixation, cells were incubated for 30 min with 0.2 μmMitotracker Red (Molecular Probes, Eugene OR), a rosamine dye that is selectively incorporated into mitochondria. A chloromethyl group in the dye covalently couples with mitochondrial proteins, thereby ensuring its retention in the organelle upon subsequent fixation and washing. Covalently-coupled Mitotracker Red emits intense red fluorescence with λmax = 599 nm (absorption maximum is at 578 nm), which makes it suitable for co-staining with complexes of antigen, antibodies, and fluorescein-tagged secondary antibodies (λmax, emission = 520 nm). Fluorescence signals were collected with a Bio-Rad MRC 600 laser scanning confocal microscope (Image Analysis Facility, Albert Einstein College of Medicine) as described in previous publications (9Li Y. Ndubuka C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16862-16869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 20Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27804-27811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Amplified cDNAs were cloned in pET14b and truncated proteins were expressed in E. coli as described previously (27Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol.

Table I gives the nomenclature for the truncated proteins and indicates the segment of mouse S-AKAP84 that was expressed in bacteria. One deletion mutant, which encodes amino acids 31–547 of S-AKAP84, was generated as described by Glantz et al. (7Glantz S.B. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and expressed in transiently transfected HEK293 cells.Figure 1Sequence of murine S-AKAP84 cDNA.

Complementary DNAs encoding proteins homologous with human S-AKAP84 were retrieved from a mouse testis cDNA library in bacteriophage λgt11 and characterized. Three related, but distinct mRNAs encode S-AKAP84 homologs in mouse testis. The longest cDNA (Fig. 1 A) encodes the shortest polypeptide, which is named S-AKAP84 (apparentM r = 84,000 in denaturing electrophoresis). Inserts obtained from the testis cDNA library contained nucleotides 53–2990 in Fig. 1 A. Extreme 5′ regions of mouse anchor protein cDNAs were characterized by a coupled reverse transcriptase-anchored PCR procedure known as RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends, see “Experimental Procedures”). Male germ cell mRNA served as a template for cDNA synthesis. Sequences of six independent cDNAs created in this manner were identical (Fig.1 B). Each had 347 bp of previously established downstream sequence (nucleotides 53–399 in Fig. 1 A) linked to a novel upstream segment.

In this study, calmodulin-binding proteins were isolated from normal (Hs578Bst) and malignant (MCF-7) human breast cell lines with calmodulin-Sepharose and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A protein that migrated at approximately 190 kDa bound to calmodulin in the presence of Ca2+ and was the only calmodulin-binding protein detected in the absence of Ca2+. This 190-kDa protein was identified as IQGAP1 by nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry and collision-induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry. IQGAP1 coimmunoprecipitated with calmodulin from lysates of MCF-7 cells. Moreover, overlay with125I-calmodulin confirmed that IQGAP1 binds directly to calmodulin. Analysis of the functional effects of the interaction revealed that Ca2+/calmodulin disrupted the binding of purified IQGAP1 to the Ras-related protein Cdc42 in a concentration-dependent manner. These data clearly identify IQGAP1 as the predominant calmodulin-binding protein in Ca2+-free breast cell lysates and reveal that calmodulin modulates the interaction between IQGAP1 and Cdc42.

Calmodulin is an acidic effector protein that regulates multiple processes in eukaryotic cells (1Cohen P. Klee C.B. Calmodulin. Elsevier Science Publishing Co. Inc., New York1988Google Scholar).

Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2573-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), exposing hydrophobic residues that mediate its interaction with amphiphilic α-helical regions of target proteins (1Cohen P. Klee C.B. Calmodulin. Elsevier Science Publishing Co. Inc., New York1988Google Scholar). Removal of Ca2+ reverses binding (1Cohen P. Klee C.B. Calmodulin. Elsevier Science Publishing Co. Inc., New York1988Google Scholar). By this mechanism, Ca2+/calmodulin modulates the activity of several proteins, thereby regulating cellular metabolism including protein phosphorylation, cell cycle progression, DNA synthesis, transcription, and cytoskeletal organization (1Cohen P. Klee C.B. Calmodulin. Elsevier Science Publishing Co. Inc., New York1988Google Scholar). More recently, a novel interaction of calmodulin with a variety of unconventional myosins (3Wolenski J.S.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15883-15889Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was identified. Each of these proteins contains one or more IQ motifs, a sequence of approximately 23 amino acid residues with a consensus IQXXXRGXXXR (8Cheney R.E. Mooseker M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The presence of the distal arginine in the IQ consensus motif dictates the Ca2+ requirement for binding calmodulin (9Houdusse A. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10644-10647Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). When the arginine residue is present, the IQ motif is said to be complete and Ca2+ is not necessary for calmodulin binding. An incomplete IQ motif does not contain the distal arginine residue, and calmodulin requires Ca2+ to bind the motif (9Houdusse A. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10644-10647Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The gene encoding an IQ motif-containing protein was recently cloned from human osteosarcoma tissue by RNA polymerase chain reaction (10Weissbach L. Settleman J. Kalady M.F. Snijders A.J. Murthy A.F.

Designated IQGAP1, the predicted protein has a calculated molecular mass of approximately 189 kDa, and contains four complete IQ motifs as well as a region with considerable sequence similarity to the catalytic domain of Ras-GAP 1The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; m/z, mass/charge; CID, collision-induced dissociation; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); ECL, enhanced chemiluminescence.1The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; m/z, mass/charge; CID, collision-induced dissociation; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); ECL, enhanced chemiluminescence.

Since the original submission of this manuscript, three studies have been published that focus on the interaction between IQGAP1 and the Ras-like proteins, Cdc42 and Rac (11Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 12McCallum S.J. Wu W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23363-23367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). However, when isolated as a Cdc42-binding protein from rabbit liver (12McCallum S.J. Wu W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21732-21737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), the amino acid sequence of an internal peptide of the 180-kDa protein was not identical to the previously published sequence of IQGAP1 (10Weissbach L. Settleman J. Kalady M.F. Snijders A.J. Murthy A.F. Yan Y.-X. Bernards A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20517-20521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, an antibody to IQGAP1 failed to recognize this putative IQGAP1 from rabbit liver, and the authors proposed that the 180-kDa protein may represent an IQGAP1 homologue (12McCallum S.J. Wu W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21732-21737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the published studies used recombinant IQGAP1 to examine its effect on Ras activity, which produced somewhat conflicting data (10Weissbach L. Settleman J. Kalady M.F. Snijders A.J. Murthy A.F. Yan Y.-X. Bernards A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20517-20521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23363-23367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). It is possible that endogenous IQGAP1 undergoes post-translational modification(s) that are not present in the recombinant protein. Therefore experimentation with purified endogenous IQGAP1 is necessary to resolve these discrepancies. The presence of IQ motifs in IQGAP1 suggests that it binds to calmodulin. In support of this, it was shown very recently that calmodulin associates with the N-terminal region of IQGAP1, which contains the IQ motifs (11Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 13Kuroda A. Fukata M. Kobayashi K. Nakafuku M. Nomura N. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23363-23367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). However, the interaction of calmodulin and IQGAP1 has not been characterized and no analysis of the potential functional sequelae has been performed. Here we use calmodulin affinity chromatography to purify sufficient full-length endogenous IQGAP1 from mammalian cells to perform functional analysis. We demonstrate by nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry that calmodulin binds to IQGAP1 in human breast cell lines both in the presence and absence of Ca2+, and we document that calmodulin modulates the interaction between IQGAP1 and Cdc42. The antibodies to calmodulin (14Sacks D.B. Porter S.E. Ladenson J.H. McDonald J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and IQGAP1 (11Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) were described previously. Production of the glutathioneS-transferase-Cdc42 fusion protein has been described (11Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells were a gift from Dr. A. Dutta (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA). Hs578Bst cells were from the American Type Culture Collection. Calmodulin-Sepharose was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Affi-Gel was from Bio-Rad. Tissue culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal bovine serum was from Biowhitaker. All other reagents were of standard analytical grade. MCF-7 and Hs578Bst cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in a 37 °C humidified incubator. Cells were washed three times in serum-free medium and lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100) with either 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA, and quick-frozen in methanol at −70 °C. Cell lysates were thawed and immediately subjected to centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. Forty microliters of a 1:1 slurry of calmodulin-Sepharose in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, was added to equal amounts of protein lysate and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C while rotating. The calmodulin-Sepharose was washed four times in buffer A with either 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA and resuspended in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and either visualized by Coomassie Blue staining or transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF). The procedure for digestion of proteins in polyacrylamide gels was modified from Rosenfeld et al. (16Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 190-kDa band was excised from the gel, equilibrated in 100 mm NH4HCO3, reduced, and alkylated with dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide. The gel slice was then washed in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, 100 mmNH4HCO3, cut into small pieces, and lyophilized. Modified trypsin in 50 mmNH4HCO3 was added, and the sample was incubated overnight at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted twice with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 60% (v/v) acetonitrile using sonication, lyophilized, and reconstituted in 5% (v/v) formic acid. The digest was desalted and concentrated on Poros RII resin (40–60-μm particles, Perseptive Biosystems), which had been packed into an Eppendorf Geloader pipette tip (Brinkman Instruments, Westbury, NY), eluted with 1.5 μl of 5% (v/v) formic acid in 70% (v/v) methanol, and loaded into the back of the nanospray needle. Electrospray mass spectra were acquired on a modified Perkin-Elmer Sciex API-III triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer (Thornhill, Ontario, Canada). This instrument is equipped with a high pressure collision cell (PE-Sciex) and an articulated nanospray interface developed by Wilm and Mann (17Wilm M. Mann M. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. Ion Process. 1994; 136: 167-180Crossref Scopus (857) Google Scholar), and was built at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg, Germany. The operation of the API-III in the nanospray mode has been described in detail elsewhere (18Carr S.A. Huddleston M.E. Annan R.S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 180-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 19Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). The molecular weights and precursor ion masses for the tryptic peptides in the unfractionated digest were determined by scanning the first quadrupole (Q1) from m/z 400–1500 in 0.1-Da steps using a dwell time of 8 ms/mass step. The resolution was adjusted to determine the isotopes of a triply charged ion up to m/z 1000. This allowed singly, doubly, and triply charged ions to be distinguished from one another. Selected precursor ions were caused to undergo collision-induced dissociation (CID) in the second quadrupole (Q2). The resulting CID product ions were mass analyzed by scanning the third quadrupole (Q3) using a mass step of 1 Da and a mass defect of 50 millimass units/100 Da. The mass spectrometer was scanned over the desired mass range using a dwell of 20 ms/mass step. This approach produces analytically useful tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data rapidly, allowing many product ion spectra to be acquired with a single loading of sample. Product ion spectra were interpreted manually. Mass spectrometric based sequence tags (20Mann M. Wilm M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 4390-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar) were searched against a nonredundant protein data base maintained by SmithKline Beecham, using the Peptide Search Program written by Mann and Wilm (20Mann M. Wilm M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 4390-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). Peptide fragment ion nomenclature is based on Roepstorff as modified by Biemann (21Biemann K. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 886-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). IQGAP1 was isolated from MCF-7 cells by calmodulin-Sepharose chromatography in buffer A containing 1 mm EGTA as described above. The calmodulin-Sepharose was washed four times in buffer A containing 1 mm EGTA. The IQGAP1 was eluted, dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, and concentrated in Centricon concentrators (Amicon). MCF-7 cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-calmodulin monoclonal antibody linked to Affi-Gel in buffer A containing 1 mm CaCl2as described (15Joyal J.L. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30039-30048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were washed five times in lysis buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF, and immunoblots were probed with anti-IQGAP1 antibody. Complexes were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). After protein transfer, the PVDF membrane was blocked in buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20), supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA containing 5% nonfat dry milk. After washing in buffer B, 4 μCi of125I-calmodulin was added and the blot was incubated for 2 h at 22 °C. The membrane was washed five times in buffer B, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. As a positive control, 0.5 μg of purified calcineurin was processed in parallel. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) linked to Cdc42 (GST-Cdc42) was treated with 1 mmEDTA for 10 min to remove bound guanine nucleotides, and then incubated with 75 μm GDP or GTPγS in 5 mmMgCl2 for 30 min to reload. Purified IQGAP1 was incubated with 1 μg of GST-GTPγS, GST-Cdc42-GDP, or GST-Cdc42-GTPγS in buffer A containing different concentrations of CaCl2 as indicated in the figure legends for 30 min at 22 °C. Where indicated, calmodulin was included in the assay. Complexes were isolated with glutathione-Sepharose for 30 min at 22 °C while rotating, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membrane. Blots were cut in half and the appropriate pieces were probed with anti-calmodulin or anti-IQGAP1 antibodies. Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody developed by ECL. Protein determinations of the cells lysates were performed using the DC Protein Assay from Bio-Rad. Densitometry of the protein bands on the gels, the ECL signals, and autoradiographs was performed with NIH Image. Calmodulin-binding proteins were isolated from a normal human breast cell line, Hs578Bst, and a malignant human breast cell line, MCF-7, with calmodulin-Sepharose in the presence and absence of Ca2+, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Blue. Each lane on the polyacrylamide gel represents the calmodulin-binding proteins isolated from cell lysate prepared from a single 100-mm tissue culture dish (approximately 2 × 106 cells). The vast majority of the proteins bound to calmodulin-Sepharose in a Ca2+-dependent manner and were dissociated from calmodulin when EGTA was added to the lysate (Fig. 1). However, one protein with a molecular mass of approximately 190 kDa bound calmodulin both in the presence and absence of Ca2+. In both cell lines the amount of the 190-kDa protein detected in the presence of Ca2+ was 2-fold more than in the absence of Ca2+. The 190-kDa band was not dissociated from calmodulin-Sepharose by buffer containing 1m NaCl and 1% Triton X-100 (data not shown), indicating high affinity binding. Compared with normal cells, the majority of calmodulin-binding proteins were present at higher levels in tumor cells (Fig. 1). By contrast, half as much of the 190-kDa protein from malignant cells bound to calmodulin. Three unidentified bands of approximately 47, 55, and 65 kDa were present in all lanes, even when lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose, suggesting that they bind nonspecifically to the Sepharose beads (Fig. 1). To identify the 190-kDa protein, the Coomassie Blue-stained band from one lane (MCF-7, −Ca2+) was digested in situwith trypsin and analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry using a nanoliter flow interface (17Wilm M. Mann M. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. Ion Process. 1994; 136: 167-180Crossref Scopus (857) Google Scholar). The nanospray source introduces samples into the mass spectrometer at flow rates on the order of 25–40 nl/min, thus allowing up to 40 min of data collection time for a single 1-μl loading of sample. These long sampling periods allow ample time for multiple experiments in which analysis parameters are optimized, and spectra can be accumulated to obtain useful data even from very weak signals. However, all electrospray methods are sensitive to the type and concentration of salts and buffers present in the sample. In addition, because signal response in an electrospray ion source is concentration-dependent, it is beneficial to have the sample in the smallest possible volume. For nanospray, this is ideally 1–2 μl. Therefore, to desalt and concentrate unfractionated in-gel protein digests, we have developed a simple method that uses gel loading pipette tips packed with a 3–4-mm height bed of reverse phase chromatographic material (22Annan R.S. McNulty D.E. Huddleston M.E. Carr S.A. Proceedings of the 44th ASMS Conference on Mass Spectrometry and Allied Topics, Portland, OR. 1996; : 702Google Scholar). After washing away the salts and buffers, the peptides can be eluted with 1.5 μl of solvent. This preparation step is critical to the success of the nanospray experiment. Typically, the entire sample is loaded into the nanospray needle. A similar sample preparation approach has been described by Wilm and co-workers (23Wilm M. Schevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L Fotis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar). The identity of a protein present in a proteolyzed gel slice can be determined using the sequence tag approach of Mann and Wilm (20Mann M. Wilm M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 4390-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). Briefly, an electrospray ionization mass spectrum of the entire mixture is recorded and, based on these data, peptide precursor ions are chosen to be sequenced by CID MS/MS in the triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Partial sequences as short as 2–3 amino acids can then be used to identify proteins in a data base by the inclusion in the search of the peptide molecular weight and the masses of the portions of the peptide that precede and follow the determined partial sequence. The mass spectrum of the unfractionated digest of the 190-kDa band exhibited a broad distribution of peptide molecular ions with charge states varying from 1+ to 4+ (Fig.2 A). Initially, a doubly charged ion atm/z 617.3 was selected for CID MS/MS. The product ion spectrum of this peptide is shown in Fig. 2 B. From these data, the partial sequence, PDA, was derived. Using the approach outlined above, together with the enzyme specificity of trypsin as a limiter, a search was made of an in-house nonredundant protein data base modified for the program Peptide Search (20Mann M. Wilm M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 4390-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). A single peptide sequence, FPDAGEDELLK (M r = 1232.6), from IQGAP1 (10Weissbach L. Settleman J. Kalady M.F. Snijders A.J. Murthy A.F. Yan Y.-X. Bernards A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20517-20521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was matched (Table I). Other major ions in the CID spectrum could now be assigned as b n andy n fragments that are predicted to be formed based on the indicated sequence. In this manner, confidence is gained that the correct sequence has been identified. During the analysis of the CID spectrum from m/z 617.3 precursor, a second IQGAP1 sequence was discovered, which could be assigned to the peptide, YQELINDIAR (M r 1233.6). The doubly charged ion for this peptide [M + 2H]2+ = 617.8 would overlap the13C peak of the first peptide, and so be included in the precursor ion selection window (which has a width of approximately 3 Da). Ions belonging to this second sequence are indicated by • in Fig. 2, but are not otherwise labeled for the sake of clarity. Two additional doubly charged precursors from the unfractionated digest were sequenced by CID MS/MS and sequence tags from their spectra also matched tryptic peptides from IQGAP1 (Table I). Moreover, 18 other peptide ions matched tryptic peptides from IQGAP1 based on molecular weight alone (Table I). These data establish that the 190-kDa calmodulin-binding protein is IQGAP1.Table IAmino acid sequence matches for IQGAP1m/zChargeM rdeterminedSequence1-aDetermined from CID MS/MS.M rcalculatedAmino acid residues1-bNumbers correspond to the amino acids in the sequence of IQGAP1 (10).617.32+1232.6FPDAGEDEX 1-cX is either leucine or isoleucine.

Open table in a new tab The mass spectrometry-based analytical approaches used in the present study for identifying proteins from gels are both sensitive and fast. After enzymatic digestion and desalting of the peptides, identification of the 190-kDa protein as IQGAP1 using data base searching of mass spectrometrically derived partial amino acid sequences took approximately 20 min. Forty percent of the sample was used to record the molecular weights of the tryptic peptides and sequence the three precursor ions. The remaining 60% of the digest was stored frozen in the nanospray needle in the event further characterization (such as characterizing suspected post-translational modifications) was necessary. Additional verification that the 190-kDa band was IQGAP1 was obtained by transferring to PVDF proteins that bound to calmodulin-Sepharose and probing the membrane with anti-IQGAP1 antibody. A single band migrating at 190 kDa was detected (Fig. 3 A), confirming its identity as IQGAP1. Analogous to the results obtained in the Coomassie Blue-stained gels (see Fig. 1), 2-fold more IQGAP1 bound calmodulin when Ca2+ was included in the incubation buffer (Fig. 3 A). Previous studies with immunoprecipitation of lysates from 3T3 cells with anti-IQGAP1 antibody revealed calmodulin, demonstrating that IQGAP1 and calmodulin form a complex in vivo (11Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). We performed the reverse experiment. Endogenous calmodulin was isolated with anti-calmodulin antibody, and immunoblots were probed with anti-IQGAP1 antibody. A single band migrating at 190 kDa was detected (Fig. 3 B), indicating that the interaction occurs in MCF-7 cells. It is possible that IQGAP1 binds in a complex and does not associate directly with calmodulin. To resolve this issue,125I-calmodulin overlay was performed after proteins were isolated from MCF-7 cells by calmodulin-Sepharose and transferred to PVDF. 125I-calmodulin binding was evaluated both in the presence and absence of Ca2+. When the overlay was performed in the presence of Ca2+, at least seven proteins were identified that bound to Ca2+/calmodulin-Sepharose (Fig. 4 A, lane 1). In contrast, only two 125I-calmodulin-binding proteins associated with Ca2+-free-calmodulin-Sepharose (Fig. 4 A,lane 2). As predicted from the Coomassie Blue-stained gel in Fig. 1, IQGAP1 was detected by 125I-calmodulin in samples incubated with Ca2+-containing or Ca2+-free calmodulin-Sepharose (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1 and2). In addition, an unidentified protein that migrated on SDS-PAGE slightly further than IQGAP1 bound 125I-calmodulin only when lysates were incubated with Ca2+-free calmodulin-Sepharose (Fig. 4 A, lane 2). It is possible that this band is IQGAP2, which migrates at 175 kDa on SDS-PAGE (12McCallum S.J. Wu W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21732-21737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Purified calcineurin, a well characterized Ca2+-dependent calmodulin-binding protein (24Klee C.B. Draetta G.F. Hubbard M.J. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 149-200PubMed Google Scholar), was used as a positive control. 125I-Calmodulin bound to calcineurin when the overlay was performed in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 4 A, lane 3), but not in its absence (Fig. 4 B, lane 3). Although IQGAP1 bound to calmodulin-Sepharose both in the presence and absence of Ca2+, 125I-calmodulin did not bind IQGAP1 appreciably when the overlay buffer contained EGTA (Fig. 4 B,lanes 1 and 2). Although not visible in Fig.4 B, a longer exposure of the autoradiograph revealed IQGAP1 when the overlay buffer lacked Ca2+ (data not shown). While the IQ motifs of some proteins bind calmodulin in the presence of Ca2+, others have higher affinity when Ca2+ is absent (3Wolenski J.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 310-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). For example, rat myr 4 has two IQ motifs; one binds Ca2+/calmodulin, and the other binds Ca2+-free calmodulin (25Bähler M. Kroschewski R. Stoffler H Behrmann T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 375-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). IQGAP1 has four IQ motifs (10Weissbach L. Settleman J. Kalady M.F. Snijders A.J. Murthy A.F. Yan Y.-X. Bernards A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20517-20521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the Ca2+ dependence for calmodulin binding to individual IQ motifs is unknown. Therefore, it is possible that some of the IQ motifs in IQGAP1 are unable to bind calmodulin in the overlay procedure. This result is not surprising, since approximately 50% of calmodulin-binding proteins are not detected by the overlay method (26Carr D.W. Scott J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 246-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Note also that none of the other proteins that bound to Ca2+-free calmodulin-Sepharose (Fig. 4 A,lane 2) was detected by 125I-calmodulin in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 4 B). After the original submission of this manuscript, it was shown that IQGAP1 in cell lysates and in vitro translated IQGAP1 associate with the activated form of GST-Cdc42 (11Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 12McCallum S.J. Wu W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21732-21737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 13Kuroda A. Fukata M. Kobayashi K. Nakafuku M. Nomura N. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23363-23367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Similarly, we isolated IQGAP1 from MCF-7 cell lysates with GST-Cdc42 but not with GST alone (data not shown). To extend these findings, we examined the effect of calmodulin on the interaction between IQGAP1 and Cdc42. Full-length purified human IQGAP1 was incubated with either GST preloaded with GTPγS (GST-GTPγS), or GST-Cdc42 loaded with GDP (GST-Cdc42-GDP) or GTPγS (GST-Cdc42-GTPγS), and complexes were isolated with glutathione-Sepharose. IQGAP1 was present only in samples containing GST-Cdc42-GTPγS (Fig. 5 A), confirming previous observations that purified IQGAP1 bound to the activated form of GST-Cdc42 (11Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 13Kuroda A. Fukata M. Kobayashi K. Nakafuku M. Nomura N. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23363-23367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Binding was specific as minimal IQGAP1 was detected in the samples incubated with GST-GTPγS. Preincubation of IQGAP1 with calmodulin prior to the addition of Cdc42 to the assay disrupted the interaction between IQGAP1 and Cdc42 (Fig.5, A and B). In contrast, calmodulin was unable to displace IQGAP1 that was already bound to Cdc42 (Fig.5 B). The inhibition of the binding of IQGAP1 to Cdc42 by calmodulin was characterized. The extent of disruption of the IQGAP1·GST-Cdc42 complex was proportional to the concentration of calmodulin added. With approximately 4 nm IQGAP1 in the assay, calmodulin concentrations of 10 nm or greater completely prevented binding, while 2 nm calmodulin had no effect (Fig.6 A). Furthermore, the calmodulin-dependent modulation of IQGAP1 binding to Cdc42 was regulated by Ca2+. In the absence of added Ca2+, calmodulin did not interfere with the association of IQGAP1 with Cdc42 (Fig. 6 B). In the presence of calmodulin, Ca2+ produced a dose-dependent inhibition of binding of IQGAP1 to Cdc42 (Fig. 6 B). The effect of Ca2+ was mediated via calmodulin as addition of Ca2+ alone (without calmodulin) did not impair the binding of IQGAP1 to Cdc42 (Fig. 6 B). These data indicate that Ca2+/calmodulin prevents the binding of IQGAP1 to Cdc42, while Ca2+-free calmodulin does not. In all cases, minimal IQGAP1 bound to GST alone (data not shown). No calmodulin was detected on the blots (data not shown), confirming that, as observed previously (11Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), calmodulin does not associate directly with Cdc42. Cdc42 binds to the Ras-GAP-related domain in the C-terminal region of IQGAP1 (residues 915–1657) (11Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), while calmodulin binds to the N terminus (11Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), which contains the IQ motifs. Therefore, the effect of calmodulin on the interaction between Cdc42 and IQGAP1 is probably not direct competition for binding, but is more likely due to a Ca2+/calmodulin-induced alteration in the conformation of IQGAP1. The binding of calmodulin to IQ motifs results in diverse effects on the target proteins. For example, Ca2+/calmodulin promotes the binding of Ras-GRF to Ras thereby activating GTPase activity (6Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). In contrast, while binding of calmodulin typically activates target proteins, the interaction of calmodulin with the IQ motif of p68 RNA helicase decreases enzyme activity (27Buelt M.K. Glidden B.J. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29367-29370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We observed a novel effect, where the binding of Ca2+/calmodulin, but not Ca2+-free calmodulin, prevented the association of IQGAP1 with Cdc42. Since IQGAP1 alters the GTPase activity of Cdc42 (11Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), our data suggest that Ca2+/calmodulin regulates Cdc42 by modulating its interaction with IQGAP1. This may occur in intact cells as the effects were observed at physiological concentrations of Ca2+ and calmodulin. In support of this hypothesis, it has been shown that sustained elevation of intracellular Ca2+dissociates Cdc42 from the cytoskeleton of activated platelets (28Dash D. Aepfelbacker M. Siess W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The authors also demonstrated that chelation of Ca2+ with BAPTA-AM preserved the interaction of Cdc42 with the cytoskeleton, but the role of calmodulin was not evaluated (28Dash D. Aepfelbacker M. Siess W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). IQGAP1 contains four putative IQ motifs (10Weissbach L. Settleman J. Kalady M.F. Snijders A.J. Murthy A.F. Yan Y.-X. Bernards A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20517-20521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the Ca2+requirement for calmodulin binding to individual IQ motifs is not known. It has been reported recently that calmodulin binding to some IQ motifs requires Ca2+, while binding to other IQ motifs occurs in the absence of Ca2+ (29Houdusse A. Silver M. Cohen C. Curr. Biol. 1996; 4: 1475-1490Google Scholar). The Ca2+dependence of the interaction of calmodulin with individual IQ motifs depends on the amino acid sequence of the motif, the number of molecules of calmodulin bound to the protein if multiple IQ motifs are present, and the sequence in which IQ motifs become occupied with calmodulin molecules (29Houdusse A. Silver M. Cohen C. Curr. Biol. 1996; 4: 1475-1490Google Scholar). Calmodulin binds to IQGAP1 both in the presence and absence of Ca2+, but inhibits the association between IQGAP1 and Cdc42 only in the presence of Ca2+(Figs. 5 and 6). These data are consistent with the model of Houdusseet al. (29Houdusse A. Silver M. Cohen C. Curr. Biol. 1996; 4: 1475-1490Google Scholar) and suggest that occupation of all the calmodulin binding sites in IQGAP1 is not necessary to disrupt its interaction with Cdc42. Mutagenesis studies are in progress to identify the critical region(s) required to mediate this inhibitory effect. Based on its sequence similarity to GAP (10Weissbach L. Settleman J. Kalady M.F. Snijders A.J. Murthy A.F. Yan Y.-X. Bernards A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20517-20521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), IQGAP1 was predicted to act as a Ras-GAP. Recently, however, it was shown that recombinant IQGAP1 does not bind Ras, but binds Cdc42, and maintains it in the GTP-bound state (11Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Since GTP hydrolysis is necessary to deactivate Ras family proteins (30Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar), IQGAP1 has been hypothesized to function in cell transformation induced by Ras-like proteins (10Weissbach L. Settleman J. Kalady M.F. Snijders A.J. Murthy A.F. Yan Y.-X. Bernards A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20517-20521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cdc42 participates in cell cycle progression (31Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar) and, with other Ras-related proteins (including Rac and Rho), influences cytoskeletal assembly (32Symons M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 178-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Both cell cycle progression (33Reddy G.P. Reed W.C. Sheehan E.L. Sacks D.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10426-10430Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and cytoskeletal assembly (34Gratzer W.B. Baines A.J. Cohen P. Klee C.B. Calmodulin. Elsevier Science Publishing Co. Inc., New York1988: 329-340Google Scholar) are also modulated by calmodulin. Furthermore, overexpression of calmodulin shortened the cell cycle and altered cell morphology (35Rasmussen C.D. Means A.R. Cell. Motil. Cytoskel. 1992; 21: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A recent study illustrated that Cdc42 is localized primarily in the Golgi apparatus in mammalian cells, where it may play a role in vesicular transport (36Erikson J.W. Zhang C. Kahn R.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26850-26854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Similarly, calmodulin has been linked to vesicular transport and calmodulin antagonists interfere with Golgi function (37West D.W. Clegg R.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1981; 9: 77Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Despite these overlapping functions, the role of calmodulin in signaling pathways involving Cdc42 has not been investigated. Calmodulin levels are significantly increased in malignant cells (38Van Eldik L.J. Burgess W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4539-4547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including breast cancer (39Singer A.L. Sherwin R.P. Dunn A.S. Appleman M.M. Cancer Res. 1976; 36: 60-66PubMed Google Scholar). In concordance with these observations, we observed that calmodulin levels were increased by 2-fold in MCF-7 cells as compared with normal breast cells. 2J. L. Joyal and D. B. Sacks, unpublished observations. It is not known whether the increased calmodulin contributes to neoplastic transformation or is a consequence of the altered cellular homeostasis that occurs during malignancy. Since calmodulin regulates the interaction of IQGAP1 with Cdc42, and Cdc42 participates in cell proliferation, differentiation, and morphology, it is possible that increased levels of calmodulin contribute to breast carcinogenesis by modulating the activity of Cdc42. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which normal cells become malignant could potentially contribute to improved methods of prevention, detection and treatment of cancer. Therefore, future studies should be directed toward examining the interactions among calmodulin, IQGAP1, and Cdc42 in malignant transformation.

https://openalex.org/W2015667498,"A stringent structure-activity relationship among polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) possessing two or moreortho-chlorine substituents is observed for activation of ryanodine receptors in mammalian brain, revealing an arylhydrocarbon receptor-independent mechanism through which non-coplanar PCBs disrupt neuronal Ca2+ signaling. Of the congeners assayed, non-coplanar PCB 95 exhibits the highest potency (EC50 = 12–24 μm) toward activating high affinity [3H]ryanodine-binding in rat hippocampus, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex. Coplanar PCB 66 and PCB 126 have no ryanodine receptor activity in all brain regions examined. PCB 95 enhances [3H]ryanodine-binding affinity and capacity by significantly altering modulation by Ca2+ and Mg2+, thereby stabilizing a high affinity conformation of the ryanodine receptor. Ca2+ transport measurements using cortical microsomes reveal that PCB 95 discriminates between inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate- and ryanodine-sensitive stores. PCB 95 selectively mobilizes Ca2+ from ryanodine-sensitive stores in a dose-dependent manner (EC50 = 3.5 μm) and is completely inhibited by ryanodine receptor blockers, whereas coplanar PCBs are inactive. These data demonstrate that ortho-substituted PCBs disrupt Ca2+transport in central neurons by direct interaction with ryanodine receptors, showing high selectivity and specificity.

Mobilization of ER Ca2+ is essential for determining the amplitude, spatial and temporal fluctuation of intracellular Ca2+, thereby providing important signaling information to the cell (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6134) Google Scholar). In consonance with their fundamental role in cellular Ca2+ signaling, skeletal (Ry1R) and brain (Ry3R) isoforms of RyRs possess a cytoskeletal binding motif which could confer a structural and functional association with l-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ entry channels in skeletal muscle (2Lu X.

Nature. 1996; 380: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Data supporting direct coupling of neuronall-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ entry and RyRs has been recently provided (6Chavis P. Fagni L. Lansman J.B. Bockaert J. Nature. 1996; 382: 719-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Most significant is the finding that expression of Ry1R cDNA in dyspedic muscle cells, which lack constitutive expression of Ry1R, restores not only excitation-contraction coupling but also restoresl-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ entry (5Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Thus mechanical coupling between RyRs and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels within the surface membrane appears to confer reciprocal regulation, a finding that may have broad significance in neuronal cell functions. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans are commonly known as halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (HAHs), a family of persistent and widely dispersed environmental contaminants. The unique chemical properties and low cost of producing PCBs have contributed to their extensive industrial use (7Mullin M.D. Pochini C.M. McCrindle S. Romkes M. Safe S.H. Safe L.M. Environ. Sci. Technol. 1984; 18: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 8De Voogt P. Brinkman U.A.T. Kimbrough R.D. Jensen A.A. Halogenated Biphenyls, Terphenyls, Naphthalenes, Dibenzodioxins, and Related Products. 2nd Ed. Elsevier-North Holland, Amersterdam1989: 3-47Crossref Google Scholar). The high lipophilicity and chemical stability of PCBs have further resulted in widespread environmental contamination, and there is significant evidence of PCBs accumulation in biota (9Safe S. Safe L. Mullin M. Safe S. Hutsinger O. Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs): Mammalian and Environmental Toxicology. Springer-Verlag, New York1987: 1-13Google Scholar). PCBs are found in extracts of virtually all environmental samples as well as in human tissue and breast milk (10Safe S. Environ. Health Perspect. 1993; 100: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar,11Koopman-Esseboom C. Huisman M. Weisglas-Kuperus N. Boersma E.R. de Ridder M.A. Van der Paauw C.G. Tuinstra L.G. Sauer P.J. Chemosphere. 1994; 29: 2327-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Among the HAHs various congeners differentially confer ability to bind to a cytosolic receptor, the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR). 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) binds to the receptor with the highest affinity and confers the highest potency to induce certain toxic responses, such as wasting syndrome, immunosuppression, and teratogenicity. PCB congeners withoutortho-chlorine substitutions are able to confer the coplanar structure similar to TCDD and elicit similar toxicity. PCB congeners with single ortho-chlorine slightly favor the non-coplanarity and behave as weak AhR agonists. PCB congeners with two or more ortho-chlorines highly favor the non-coplanar conformation; thus, this group of congeners do not bind to the AhR and exhibit different toxicity. There is emerging evidence indicating that certain ortho-substituted PCB congeners are responsible for the neurotoxic effects of PCBs, including decreased in catecholamine levels in certain brain regions in mammals (12Seegal R.F. Bush B. Brosch K.O. Neurotoxicology. 1991; 12: 55-65PubMed Google Scholar, 13Seegal R.F. Bush B. Brosch K.O. Toxicology. 1991; 66: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 14Seegal R.F.

Seegal R. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1991; 111: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Perinatal exposure of monkeys and rodents to PCBs resulted in behavioral abnormalities including delayed reflex development, altered activity patterns, learning deficits, and impaired memory (16Schantz S.L. Behavioral Toxicology and Addiction: Food Drugs and Environment.in: Niesink R. Jasper R. Open University of Netherlands, Utrecht1997Google Scholar). Rats perinatally exposed to certain ortho-substituted PCB congeners were impaired in learning a delayed spatial alternation task similar to that employed in the behavioral test of the PCB-exposed monkeys (17Schantz S.L. Moshtaghian J. Ness D.K. Fundam Appl. Toxicol. 1995; 26: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Epidemiological studies reveal that children exposed either perinatally or prenatally to PCBs and other HAHs developed long-lasting cognitive function deficits (18Jacobson J.L. Jacobson S.W. Humphrey H.E. J. Pediatr. 1990; 116: 38-45Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 19Chen Y.J. Hsu C.C. Dev. Med.

Although the compounds that are responsible for these deficits are unknown, results from animal studies have revealed that ortho-substituted PCBs are probably responsible for the neurotoxicity observed. In addition to the subtle neurotoxic effects induced by PCBs, the 209 possible congeners in the PCB family that constitute various industrial PCB mixtures has greatly obstructed progress in understanding the cellular and subcellular mechanisms of PCBs action. Studies have demonstrated that certain ortho-substituted PCB congeners are responsible for the neurotoxic action of PCBs, suggesting a non-AhR-mediated pathway. Shain and co-workers performed an extensive structure-activity relationship study on more than 50 PCB congeners (15Shain W. Bush B. Seegal R. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1991; 111: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). ortho-Substituted, non-coplanar PCB congeners were found to be the most active structures in decreasing dopamine level in PC12 cells, whereas coplanar PCBs were found to be inert. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which ortho-substituted PCBs induced neurotoxicity are unknown. We have provided evidence of the direct interaction between certain ortho-substituted PCB congeners and the ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ channel complex (RyRs) localized on sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER) (22Wong P.W. Pessah I.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 740-751PubMed Google Scholar). The studies reported suggest a selective molecular target by which certain ortho-substituted PCB congeners disrupt Ca2+ homeostasis in muscle and within neurons in certain regions of the brain, as RyRs are differentially expressed in the central nervous system. The present paper demonstrates for the first time a stringent structure-activity relationship among PCBs possessing two or more chlorine substitutions in the ortho positions for activation of RyRs of the mammalian central nervous system, revealing an AhR-independent mechanism through which PCBs disrupt neuronal Ca2+ signaling. The most potent congener at the receptor yet identified, PCB 95 (2,2′,3,5′,6-pentachlorobiphenyl), is found to alter Ca2+ transport across neuronal microsomal membrane vesicles by a RyR-mediated pathway without affecting the IP3R-mediated pathway. These actions of PCB 95 at RyRs may underlie its ability to alter neuronal excitability in rat hippocampal slices in vitro (23Wong, P. W., Joy, R. M., Albertson, T. E., Schantz, S. L., and Pessah, I. N. (1997) Neurotoxicology, in press.Google Scholar), as well as both locomotor activity and spatial learning in an in vivo rat model (24Schantz, S. L., Seo, B. W., Wong, P. W., and Pessah, I. N. (1997)Neurotoxicology, in press.Google Scholar). Taken together, these results demonstrate a RyR-mediated mechanism by which certain ortho-substituted PCBs alter neuronal Ca2+ signaling, through which they may alter neurodevelopment and neurobehavioral function in mammals. Aroclor 1254 and PCB congeners (>99% pure) were purchased from Ultra Scientific (North Kensington, RI). [3H]Ryanodine (60–90 Ci/mmol; > 99%) and [3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (15–30 Ci/mmol; > 95%) were purchased from DuPont NEN. Fluo-3 (pentammonium salt, ≥90% pure) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other reagents were of the highest purity commercially available. Membrane fractions from cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus of rat were prepared as described previously (25Zimanyi I. Pessah I.N. Brain Res. 1991; 561: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, tissue from each brain region was homogenized with 10-fold (w/v) ice-cold homogenization buffer consisting of 320 mmsucrose, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The homogenate from each brain region was centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 1 h. The whole particulate fractions were obtained by suspending the pellets in a buffer consisting of 320 mm sucrose, 5 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, at a protein concentration of 8–12 mg/ml (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein preparations were then rapidly frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C until needed. The homogenate from each brain region was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min. The membrane pellets were collected, suspended in homogenization buffer with a glass Dounce homogenizer, and re-centrifuged at 1,000 × g. The two supernatant fractions were combined and centrifuged at 8,000 ×g for 10 min. The resulting supernatants were then centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 1 h. Finally, the crude microsomal pellets were suspended and stored as described above. To examine the protein dependence of [3H]ryanodine binding in the presence or absence of selected PCB congeners, the binding capacity of the whole particulate fraction isolated from rat cerebellum was determined as a function of protein concentration. Specific binding of 10 nm [3H]ryanodine to cerebellar whole particulate fraction (50–250 μg) was measured in an assay buffer consisting of 140 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 20 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 100 μm PMSF, 10% sucrose, 10 μm CaCl2, in the presence or absence of either 40 μm PCB 95 or 40 μm PCB 126, in a final volume of 250 μl, as described previously (25Zimanyi I. Pessah I.N. Brain Res. 1991; 561: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). All samples were equilibrated at 37 °C for 3 h with constant shaking. Nonspecific binding was determined by addition of a thousandfold excess of cold ryanodine and averaged 70% of the total binding. Each experiment was performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times with different membrane preparations. Dose-response relationship for PCB-activated [3H]ryanodine binding to cerebellar microsomes was determined for selected PCB congeners and Aroclor 1254. Specific binding of 2 nm [3H]ryanodine was measured in the presence or absence of 400 nm to 400 μmPCB with 180 μg of crude cerebellar microsomal protein, in an assay buffer consisting of 140 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 20 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 100 μm PMSF, 10 μm CaCl2, in a final volume of 250 μl (25Zimanyi I. Pessah I.N. Brain Res. 1991; 561: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was determined by addition of a thousandfold excess of cold ryanodine and averaged 35% of the total binding. The potency (EC50 and Hill coefficient) of each PCB toward RyRs was determined by linear regression analysis of logit-log transformation of the data obtained between 10 and 90% of maximal binding. The mechanism by which PCB 95 enhanced occupancy of [3H]ryanodine to cerebellum was measured by saturation binding experiments (22Wong P.W. Pessah I.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 740-751PubMed Google Scholar). Specific binding of 0.5–20 nm[3H]ryanodine was determined in the presence of 50 μm PCB 95 in an assay buffer (Low Salt Buffer) consisting of 180 μg of cerebellar whole particulate protein, 140 mmKCl, 15 mm NaCl, 20 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 10% sucrose, 100 μm PMSF, 10 μmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, in a final volume of 250 μl. Control experiments were performed in the absence of PCB by measuring specific binding of 0.5–70 nm[3H]ryanodine in an assay buffer (High Salt Buffer) consisting of 180 μg of cerebellar whole particulate protein, 200 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 20 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 10% sucrose, 100 μm PMSF, 10 μmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, in a final volume of 250 μl. Binding constants (K D andB max) of high affinity [3H]ryanodine-binding sites were obtained from linear regression analysis of the Scatchard plots using ENZFITTER (Elsevier Biosoft, London, United Kingdom) computer software. The ability of PCB 95 to alter Ca2+modulation of RyRs was performed by measuring the specific binding of 2 nm [3H]ryanodine to 200 μg of cerebellar microsomal protein in the presence of 50 μm PCB 95 in Low Salt Buffer and 12 nm to 200 mm free Ca2+, in a final volume of 250 μl. Free Ca2+concentrations below 200 μm in the assay were adjusted by adding calculated amount of EGTA based on the SPECS computer software and published stability constants (27Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). Control experiments were performed in High Salt Buffer containing 200 μm to 200 mm CaCl2. The ability of PCB 95 to alter Mg2+ inhibition of RyRs was determined in the presence of 2 nm[3H]ryanodine, 200 μg of cerebellar microsomes, and 2 mm to 1 m Mg2+ in Low Salt Buffer containing 100 μm CaCl2, in a final volume of 250 μl. Control experiments were performed in High Salt Buffer containing 100 μm CaCl2. Values for EC50 of Ca2+ and IC50 of Ca2+ and Mg2+ were calculated from the linear regression analysis of logit-log transformation of the data obtained between 10 and 90% of maximal binding. The possible influence of PCB 95 on the binding of [3H]IP3 to cerebellum was determined by incubating 0–100 μm PCB 95 or 100 μm PCB 126, in the presence of 0.5 nm[3H]IP3, 200 μg of cerebellar microsomal protein, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na-EGTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 25 mmNa2HPO4, pH 8.3, in a final volume of 1 ml (25Zimanyi I. Pessah I.N. Brain Res. 1991; 561: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was obtained by adding a thousandfold excess of cold IP3. The samples were permitted to equilibrate either in an ice bath (4 °C) for 30 min or at 25 °C for 15 min with constant shaking. Binding data were analyzed with two-tailed Student's t test, α = 0.05. Net Ca2+ flux across brain microsomal vesicles was measured with the long-wavelength Ca2+ indicator fluo-3 using a luminescence spectrometer (Amino Bowman series 2, SLM Aminco, Rochester, NY). Two hundred μg of the rat cortical membrane microsome was added into an assay buffer consisting of 40 mm KCl, 62.5 mm KH2PO4, 1 mmNaN3, 10 μm K-EGTA, 8 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.5 μm fluo-3, 1 mm Mg-ATP, 20 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 5 mm phosphocreatine, in a final volume of 1.2 ml (28Palade P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6135-6141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29White A.M. Watson S.P. Galione A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The transport assays were performed in temperature-controlled cuvettes at 37 °C with constant stirring. The net Ca2+ flux across the vesicles was recorded by measuring the extravesicular free Ca2+ level as fluorescence intensity with excitation and emission wavelengths of 500 and 530 nm, respectively. The free Ca2+ concentration was calculated from fluorescence intensity using the following equation (30Minta A. Kao J.P.Y. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8171-8178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).[Ca2+] free=KD×[F−Fmin]/[[Fmax−F]Equation 1 F is the fluorescence intensity of the response,F max is the fluorescence intensity at saturating Ca2+, and F min is the fluorescence intensity in the absence of free Ca2+. The equilibrium dissociation constant, K D, of the Ca2+·fluo-3 complex was 320 nm (30Minta A. Kao J.P.Y. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8171-8178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).F min and F max values for the assay were determined from the fluorescence intensities in the presence of 4-bromo A-23187 (1 μg) with the addition of 10 mm EGTA and 1 mm Ca2+ (saturating Ca2+ level), respectively. The initial rates of Ca2+ release induced by 1–10 μm PCB 95 were obtained by linear regression analysis of the first 20–50 s of data that followed the addition of PCB 95. Values of EC50 and Hill coefficient of initial rate of PCB 95-induced Ca2+release were calculated from the linear regression analysis of logit-log transformation of the data obtained between 10 and 90% of maximal rate. Aroclor 1254 and selected PCB congeners were examined for their ability to modulate the high affinity binding of [3H]ryanodine to microsomes isolated from rat cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus in the presence of physiologically relevant concentrations of intracellular K+ and Na+. Fig. 1 demonstrated that binding of [3H]ryanodine (10 nm) increased linearly as a function of cerebellar protein concentration and that non-coplanar PCB 95 significantly enhanced occupancy to ≥50 μg of protein/assay. In contrast, coplanar PCB 126 did not increase occupancy above control values at any concentrations of protein examined (Fig. 1). Similar enhancement in the occupancy of nanomolar [3H]ryanodine was observed with cortical and hippocampal membrane preparations (data not shown). The influence ofortho-chloro substitutions on the ability of PCB congeners to activate the high affinity binding of [3H]ryanodine was examined with complete dose-response relationships for selected PCB congeners. Coplanar PCB 66 and PCB 126 had no activity toward RyRs in microsomes isolated from rat cerebellum, cerebral cortex, or hippocampus at concentrations up to their solubility limits (200 μm) (Fig. 2, Table I). In marked contrast, non-coplanar PCB 95 enhanced binding of [3H]ryanodine, in a dose-dependent manner, to microsomes isolated from all the brain regions examined. PCB 95 gave EC50 values (in μm) of 17, 12, and 25 with microsomes isolated from rat cerebellum, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex, respectively (Fig. 2, Table I).Figure 1PCB 95, but not PCB 126, enhances the specific binding of [3H]ryanodine in rat cerebellum.Equilibrium binding of 10 nm [3H]ryanodine to whole particulate fractions (50–200 μg) from cerebellum was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” PCB 95 (2,2′,3,5′,6-pentachlorobiphenyl; •) enhanced ryanodine binding in cerebellum, whereas PCB 126 (3,3′,4,4′,5-pentachlorobiphenyl; ♦) had no effect.

Data represented the mean ± S.E. of n determinations. An extended structure-activity relationship was performed with cerebellar microsomes. Compared with PCB 95, PCB 4 (2,2′-dichlorobiphenyl) and PCB 52 (2,2′5,5′-tetrachlorobiphenyl) were 2- and 3-fold less potent, respectively. The position of the chlorine substituents about the biphenyl ring structure appeared to be as important as the degree of chlorination for RyR activity, since 2,2′,4,5′,6- and 2,2′,3,4,6-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 103 and PCB 88, respectively) were 3- and 5-fold less potent than PCB 95. The stringent structural requirement for receptor activity was further demonstrated by the finding that 2,2′,4,4′,5,5′-hexachlorobiphenyl, 2,2′,4,6,6′-pentachlorobiphenyl, and 2,3′,4′,5-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB 153, PCB 104, and PCB 70, respectively) were approximately 10-fold less potent than PCB 95, whereas 2,3′,4,4′-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB 66) was inactive in all of the brain regions tested (Table I). Interestingly, the PCB mixture Aroclor 1254 showed appreciable activity toward RyR (EC50 = 35 μm in cerebellum). The values of EC50, maximal occupancy, and Hill coefficient for selected PCB congeners and Aroclor 1254 are summarized in Table I. Net Ca2+ transport across rat cortical microsomal membrane vesicles was measured with the fluorometric dye fluo-3 under conditions of active Ca2+ loading. In Fig.3 A, a typical trace of the Ca2+loading phase is shown, and was invariant for each of the experiments shown below. Ca2+ loading was initiated by addition of ATP followed by serial addition of two 2.4-nmol additions of Ca2+.

Exposure of Balb/c 3T3 cells to okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, increased the phosphorylation of p53 without changing p53 levels. Okadaic acid treatment enhanced the binding of p53 to a consensus DNA target sequence and caused a 5–8-fold increase in p53 transcriptional activity. Transient expression of SV40 small tumor antigen, a specific inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A, caused a 4-fold increase in p53 transcriptional activity. Incubation of Balb/c 3T3 cells with okadaic acid also induced programmed cell death in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Decreases in viability, morphological changes, and the appearance of DNA fragmentation were dependent on p53 since cells lacking functional p53 were resistant to okadaic acid-induced apoptosis. The p53-dependent apoptosis induced by okadaic acid was rapid and did not require p53 transcriptional activity. The fact that SV40 small tumor antigen did not induce apoptosis provides additional evidence that p53 transcriptional activity is not sufficient for p53-mediated apoptosis. These results indicate that signaling pathways involving protein phosphorylation play critical roles in controlling the apoptotic activity of p53. Furthermore, a basal level of protein phosphatase 1 or 2A activity is necessary to prevent p53-dependent apoptosis.

The tumor suppressor p53 is a nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a pivotal role in suppressing cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. The p53 gene is frequently lost or rearranged in a large variety of human cancers (1Levine A.J. Chang A. Dittmer D. Notterman D.A. Silver A. Thorn K. Welsh D. Wu M. Eur. J.

Many of these genes are involved in regulating the cell cycle or apoptosis, suggesting that at least some actions of p53 are mediated by its transcriptional activity. However, transcriptional activation is not always sufficient since, under some conditions, p53 can induce programmed cell death in the absence of transcription (18Caelles C. Helmberg A. Karin M.

Three phosphorylated serine residues in the N-terminal transactivation domain (serines 6, 15, and 34 in mouse p53) are important for transcriptional activity (39Mayr G.A. Reed M. Wang P. Wang Y. Schweds J.F. Tegtmeyer P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2410-2417PubMed Google Scholar). Except for the protein kinase C site, all of these sites have been shown to be phosphorylated in vivo (40Meek D.W. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 203-210PubMed Google Scholar). p53 is also dephosphorylated by multiple protein-serine/threonine phosphatases. In vitro, p53 can be dephosphorylated by both PP1 1The abbreviations used are: PP1 and PP2A, protein-serine/threonine phosphatases 1 and 2A, respectively; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. and PP2A (33Takenaka I.

Treatment of cells with PP1- and PP2A-specific inhibitors, including okadaic acid, results in the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated p53 (42Yatsunami J. Komori A. Ohta T. Suganuma M. Fujiki H.

Okadaic acid-induced phosphorylation of ectopically expressed p53 has been correlated with increases in DNA binding activity and decreased transcriptional activity (43Zhang W. McClain C. Gau J.P.

Okadaic acid also induces programmed cell death in many cell types (45Boe R. Gjertsen B.T. Vintermyr O.K. Houge G. Lanotte M. Doskeland S.O. Exp.

Acta. 1995; 1269: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), suggesting that PP1 and PP2A are components of signaling pathways that regulate apoptosis. Since p53 is an inducer of apoptosis, the effects of phosphatase inhibitors suggest a potential link between increased p53 phosphorylation and apoptosis. However, an involvement of p53 in the apoptotic response to phosphatase inhibitors has not been demonstrated. Neither the effects of okadaic acid on endogenous p53 activity nor the relationship between okadaic acid-induced apoptosis and p53 phosphorylation has been examined. We used okadaic acid and SV40 small t antigen to determine the associations among p53 phosphorylation, transcriptional activity, and apoptosis in cells expressing endogenous levels of p53. Okadaic acid-induced hyperphosphorylation of p53 correlated with increased DNA binding activity. Both okadaic acid and small t antigen caused an increase in p53 transcriptional activity. The data also show that okadaic acid induces p53-dependent apoptosis that is not dependent on p53 transcriptional activity.

Williams, personal communication. The p53CON-Luc reporter plasmid was generated by inserting an oligonucleotide containing a p53 consensus binding site upstream of the basal promoter of pGuP.PA.8 (5Funk W.D. Pak D.T. Karas R.H.

The pCMV-lacZ plasmid contains the bacterial β-galactosidase gene driven by the early promoter of human cytomegalovirus. pCMV-SV40-t and pCMV-SV40-Δt are plasmids that express full-length SV40 small t antigen or a truncated small tumor antigen lacking the C terminus (amino acids 111–174). The SV40-Δt protein is incapable of interacting with PP2A (50Sontag E. Fedorov S. Kamibayashi C. Robbins D. Cobb M. Mumby M. Cell. 1993; 75: 887-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). pCMV5 is the empty vector that was used for the construction of pCMV-SV40-t and pCMV-SV40-Δt. Log-phase cells (1 × 106 cells/100-mm dish) were cotransfected with 8 μg of p53CON-Luc or pGuP.PA.8 and 4 μg of pCMV-lacZ mixed with 50 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following transfection, cells were incubated for 18 h prior to the addition of fresh medium containing okadaic acid (LC Services Corp., Woburn, MA) dissolved in Me2SO. Control incubations included the same amounts of Me2SO (final concentration of 0.05%) lacking okadaic acid. After treatment, cells were collected, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and solubilized using the lysis reagent provided with the luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase and β-galactosidase (51Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) activities were measured 48 h following transfections. Luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency using the activity of β-galactosidase. For experiments with SV40 small tumor antigen, transfections were performed as described above except that 8 μg of pCMV-SV40-t, pCMV-SV40-Δt, or the empty pCMV vector were used in combination with 2 μg of either p53CON-Luc or pGuP.PA.8. Cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/well and grown for 16 h. Okadaic acid was added, and cells were incubated for the times indicated on the figures. Cell viability was determined using trypan blue exclusion. When cycloheximide and actinomycin D were used, they were added 1 h before the addition of okadaic acid. Log-phase cells were treated with combinations of okadaic acid and actinomycin D, and poly(A)+ RNA was isolated by oligo(dT) affinity chromatography using the mRNA isolation system (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Three μg of poly(A)+ RNA were separated by electrophoresis on a 7% formaldehyde, 1.0% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane. The membranes were hybridized with a32P-labeled p21 probe. The membrane was stripped and rehybridized with a 32P-labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA fragment to confirm equal loading of the RNA samples. Cells were treated with 500 nm okadaic acid for the times indicated, and low molecular weight DNA was prepared using a modification of a method described previously (52Miller S.A. Dykes D.D. Polesky H.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (17972) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed at 1 × 107 cells/3 ml of cell lysis buffer (10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8), and the lysates were treated overnight at 37 °C with 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K. The next day, NaCl was added to a final concentration of 1.5 m, and the samples were centrifuged at 1300 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were transferred to a new tube, and an equal volume of ethanol was added to precipitate the DNA. The DNA pellets were washed three times with 70% ethanol; air-dried; dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA; and quantitated. Prior to loading on gels, the DNA samples were treated with DNase-free RNase A (0.2 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. Ten μg of DNA were analyzed on a 1.3% agarose gel. All antibodies were mouse monoclonal antibodies. PAb419 is specific for the amino terminus of SV40 tumor antigens (53Harlow E. Crawford L.V. Pim D.C. Williamson N.M. J. Virol. 1981; 39: 861-869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PAb421 (Oncogene Science Inc., Manhasset, NY) recognizes the carboxyl terminus of p53 from a number of species (53Harlow E. Crawford L.V. Pim D.C. Williamson N.M. J. Virol. 1981; 39: 861-869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PAb240 (Oncogene Science Inc.) recognizes a common conformational epitope of p53 exposed by denaturation (54Gannon J.V. Greaves R. Iggo R. Lane D.P.

For [35S]methionine labeling, cells were cultured in 100-mm dishes at 80% confluence, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and starved for 1 h in methionine-free DMEM containing 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Cells were labeled for 9 h in methionine-free DMEM containing 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 3.7 MBq/ml [35S]methionine. Okadaic acid (500 nm) was added at different times during the labeling period. Cells were collected by scraping, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at −80 °C prior to analysis. Cell lysates were prepared by incubating the thawed cells at 4 °C for 1 h in 3 ml of a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholic acid, 150 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and precleared by incubation with 5 μg of normal mouse IgG (Sigma) and 30 μl of protein A-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation. One-third of the precleared lysates, containing equal amounts of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable35S, were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 1 μg of PAb421 or 1 μg of control PAb419 antibody. Twenty μl of protein A-agarose were added, and the mixtures were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with rocking. The agarose beads were recovered by centrifugation and washed five times with 1 ml of ice-cold cell lysis buffer. The material on the beads was released in 50 μl of Laemmli SDS sample buffer (56Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) by boiling for 2 min. The beads were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants were loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the gels were fixed, soaked in ENHANCE (DuPont NEN), and exposed to x-ray film. For analysis of p53 phosphorylation, cells were labeled with32Pi, and lysates were immunoprecipitated using the procedure described above with the following exceptions. 1) Prior to labeling, the cells were washed and starved for 1 h in phosphate-free DMEM containing 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum; 2) cells were labeled for 9 h in phosphate-free DMEM containing 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 7.4 MBq/ml32Pi; and 3) the protein concentration of precleared cell lysates was determined using the BCA assay kit (Pierce) with the addition of iodoacetamide to avoid dithiothreitol-generated artifacts (57Hill H.D. Straka J.G. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein from precleared lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation. The 32P-labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography after SDS gel electrophoresis. The amounts of p53 and SV40 small t antigen in cell lysates were quantitated by immunoblotting. The cells were lysed as described above, and protein was quantitated by the modified BCA assay (57Hill H.D. Straka J.G. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Fifty μg of protein in SDS sample buffer were boiled for 5 min, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. 10% polyacrylamide gels were used for p53, and 15% gels were used for SV40 small t antigen. Membranes were incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer (5% nonfat milk, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.6) and then overnight at 4 °C with the relevant antibody at 1 μg/ml in the same buffer. Membranes were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) diluted 1:2000 in blocking buffer. The blots were washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.6. Bound antibodies were visualized using the ECL reagent (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) as described by the manufacturer. Nuclear extracts were prepared using a modified version of a protocol previously described (58Li Y.C. Ross J. Scheppler J.A. Franza Jr., B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1883-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cells (1 × 107) were treated with 500 nmokadaic acid. Cells were collected, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 200 μl of ice-cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysis was aided by gently passing the cell suspension through a 28-gauge needle while maintaining the sample on ice. Nuclei were collected at 4 °C by centrifugation for 5 s in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge set at maximum speed. The pellet, containing crude nuclei, was resuspended in 200 μl of ice-cold buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin), and KCl was added to a final concentration of 500 mm. The nuclei were extracted at 4 °C for 60 min with gentle shaking. An equal volume of ice-cold buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin) was added, and the mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge set at maximum speed. The supernatant was collected, aliquoted, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Protein was quantitated using the modified BCA assay described above. Prior to assay, each nuclear extract was diluted with buffer C to a final KCl concentration of 100 mm. Binding reactions included 1 ng of 32P-end-labeled double-stranded p53CON, 20 μg of nuclear extract, 2 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA, and 100 ng of the anti-p53 mouse monoclonal antibody PAb421 to enhance DNA binding activity as described previously (5Funk W.D.

Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and then loaded onto a 4% polyacrylamide gel containing Tris borate/EDTA buffer. Electrophoresis was carried out at 4 °C and 200 V. Both the stability and activities of p53 are altered in response to a number of stimuli. To determine if okadaic acid caused covalent modification or stabilization of endogenous p53, the effects of the inhibitor on steady-state levels and phosphorylation were determined. Incubation with 500 nm okadaic acid for 6 h had no effect on the amount of p53 immunoprecipitated from [35S]methionine-labeled Balb/c 3T3 cells with monoclonal antibody PAb421. Immunoblotting cell extracts with PAb421 also showed that okadaic acid did not affect the level of p53. Phosphorylation of serine 370 by protein kinase C in vitro reduces the reactivity of PAb421 with p53 (33Takenaka I. Morin F. Seizinger B.R. Kley N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5405-5411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and could affect the estimate of p53 levels. Therefore, the same cell lysates were also immunoblotted with a second antibody (PAb240) that is independent of phosphorylation (54Gannon J.V. Greaves R. Iggo R. Lane D.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1595-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar,55Stephen C.W. Lane D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The levels of p53 detected with PAb240 in control and okadaic acid-treated cells were identical to those observed with PAb421, confirming that there was no detectable effect on p53 levels (data not shown). The fact that there was no change in PAb421 immunoreactivity under conditions where p53 becomes highly phosphorylated (see below) indicates that serine 370 is not a major site phosphorylated in response to okadaic acid. The effects of okadaic acid on p53 phosphorylation were determined by immunoprecipitation of extracts from cells labeled with32P-labeled inorganic phosphate. Incubation of Balb/c 3T3 cells with okadaic acid caused a dramatic increase in the phosphorylation of p53 (Fig. 1, upper panel). The 32P-labeled protein of M r = 53,000 was not present in immunoprecipitates from p53−/−cells or in immunoprecipitates derived from the control PAb419 antibody, confirming that this band was p53. TheM r = 76,000 protein was unrelated to p53 since it was also present in p53−/− cells. Okadaic acid-induced increases in p53 phosphorylation were detectable after 1 h, were nearly maximal after 4 h, and persisted for at least 6 h (Fig. 1, lower panel). These data show that okadaic acid causes phosphorylation of endogenous p53 without changing its steady-state levels. The role of phosphorylation in regulating p53 transcriptional activity has been studied using ectopically expressed p53. To determine the role of phosphorylation in controlling endogenous p53, we determined the effects of okadaic acid on transcription of a p53 reporter gene containing a p53 consensus binding site. Balb/c 3T3, p53−/−, or 175.1 cells were cotransfected with the p53CON-Luc reporter plasmid and the pCMV-lacZ plasmid. Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were treated with okadaic acid, and lysates were assayed for luciferase activity. Luciferase activity in Balb/c 3T3 cells was increased up to 8-fold by incubation with okadaic acid (Fig. 2 A). Okadaic acid had no effect on the very low luciferase activity derived from p53−/− and 175.1 cells, consistent with the absence of functional p53 in these cell lines. The time course of transcriptional activation by okadaic acid was delayed relative to p53 phosphorylation (compare Fig. 2 B with Fig. 1). Only a low level of luciferase activity was obtained with the pGuP.PA.8 reporter, which lacks the p53-binding element, and the activity was not affected by okadaic acid. Previous studies have indicated that phosphorylation of p53 enhances DNA binding activity (33Takenaka I. Morin F. Seizinger B.R. Kley N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5405-5411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 44Fuchs B. Hecker D. Scheidtmann K.H. Eur. J.

https://openalex.org/W2010229446,"Serine proteinase inhibitors (serpins) are classically regulators of extracellular proteolysis, however, recent evidence suggests that some function intracellularly. Such “ovalbumin” serpins include the human proteinase inhibitors 6 (PI-6), 8 (PI-8), and 9 (PI-9), plasminogen activator inhibitor 2, and the monocyte/neutrophil elastase inhibitor. PI-9 is a potent granzyme B (graB) inhibitor that has an unusual P1 Glu and is present primarily in lymphocytes. In a search for the murine equivalent of PI-9 we screened cDNA libraries, and performed reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on RNA isolated from leukocyte cell lines and from lymph nodes and spleens of allo-immunized mice. We identified 10 new ovalbumin serpin sequences: two resemble PI-8, two resemble PI-9, and the remaining six have no obvious human counterparts. By RNA analysis only one of the two sequences resembling PI-9 (designated SPI6) is present in mouse lymphocytes while the other (a partial clone designated mBM2A) is predominantly in testis. SPI6 comprises a 1.8-kilobase cDNA encoding a 374-amino acid polypeptide that is 68% identical to PI-9. mBM2A is 65% identical to PI-9 and over 80% identical to SPI6. Although the reactive loops of SPI6 and mBM2A differ from PI-9, both contain a Glu in a region likely to contain the P1-P1′ bond. SPI6 produced in vitro using a coupled transcription/translation system formed an SDS-stable complex with human graB and did not interact with trypsin, chymotrypsin, leukocyte elastase, pancreatic elastase, thrombin, or cathepsin G. Recombinant SPI6 produced in a yeast expression system was used to examine the interaction with human graB in more detail. The second-order rate constant for the interaction was estimated as 8 × 104m−1 s−1, and inhibition depended on the Glu in the SPI6 reactive center. The SPI6 gene was mapped to the same region on mouse chromosome 13 asSpi3, which encodes the murine homolog of PI-6. We conclude that even though their reactive centers are not highly conserved, SPI6 is a functional homolog of PI-9, and that the regulation of graB in the mouse may involve a second serpin encoded by mBM2A. Our identification of multiple sequence homologs of PI-8 and PI-9, and six new ovalbumin serpins, is consonant with the idea that the larger set of granule and other proteinases known to exist in the mouse (compared with human) is balanced by a larger array of serpins.

Chem. 1994; 269: 15957-15960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Serpins generally contain an exposed C-terminal loop in which the reactive center P1-P1′ residues define the inhibitory specificity of the molecule. Inhibition of proteolysis is achieved by the formation of essentially irreversible 1:1 stoichiometric complexes between serpins and cognate proteinases (2Potempa J. Korzus E. Travis J. J. Biol.

Comparisons of gene localization and organization suggest that the ovalbumin serpins can be subdivided into two groups exemplified by PI-6 and PAI-2. The PAI-2, SCCA-1, SCCA-2, and maspin genes are on human chromosome 18 (8Schneider S.S. Schick C. Fish K.E. Miller E. Pena J.C. Treter S.D. Hui S.M. Silverman G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3147-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), whereas the PI-6, PI-9, and MNEI genes are on human chromosome 6 (16Coughlin P. Nicholl J. Sun J. Salem H. Bird P. Sutherland G. Genomics. 1995; 26: 431-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 17Ooms L. Nicholl J. Bird P. Sutherland G.R. Chromosome Res. 1995; 3: 447Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 18Evans E.

Genomics. 1996; 37: 406-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This pattern extends to the mouse where the PAI-2 gene is on chromosome 1 (20Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Eppig J.T. Maltais L.J. Miller J.C. Dietrich W.F. Weaver A. Lincoln S.E. Steen R.G. Stein L.D. Nadeau J.H. Lander E.S. Science. 1993; 262: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) and the gene encoding the PI-6 homolog, SPI3, is on chromosome 13 (21Sun J. Rose J.B. Bird P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16089-16096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although otherwise identical in structure, the PI-6 gene lacks an intron present in PAI-2, SCCA-1, and SCCA-2 (8Schneider S.S. Schick C. Fish K.E. Miller E. Pena J.C. Treter S.D. Hui S.M.

Schleef R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26754-26757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The physiological roles of most ovalbumin serpins are unknown but MNEI, maspin, PAI-2, and SCCA may function in tumorigenesis and inflammation. MNEI has been postulated to control serine proteinases found at inflammatory sites to prevent damage to surrounding tissue (22Sugimori T. Cooley J. Hoidal J.R. Remold-O'Donnell E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 13: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and maspin is a candidate tumor suppressor (9Zou Z. Anisowicz A. Hendrix M.J.C. Thor A. Neveu M. Sheng S. Rafidi K. Seftor E. Sager R. Science. 1994; 263: 526-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Increases in SCCA levels and release are associated with squamous cell carcinoma (7Suminami Y. Kishi F. Sekiguchi K. Kato H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), while PAI-2 expression is increased in monocytes during inflammation (23Belin D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 144-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that PI-9 is a potent inhibitor of the cytotoxic lymphocyte granule serine proteinase, granzyme B (graB), and have suggested that PI-9 is produced by cytotoxic lymphocytes and other immune cells to counter misdirected graB released during target cell destruction (14Sun J. Bird C.H. Sutton V. McDonald L. Coughlin P.B. De Jong T.A. Trapani J.A. Bird P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27802-27809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). To investigate the physiological role of PI-9 we have decided to study it in the mouse, which has obvious advantages for studies involving the immune system. Here we report the identification of 10 new serpin sequences from the mouse arising from a search for a PI-9 homolog. Among these are two that are probably PI-8 homologs and two that closely resemble human PI-9. The remainder represent ovalbumin serpins that have the hallmarks of functional proteinase inhibitors but have no known human counterparts. Eight of these new serpin sequences (including one of the two PI-9 homologs, designated SPI6) were found in activated lymphocytes. SPI6 was characterized further and shown to be a graB inhibitor. These results indicate that rodents have a much larger array of ovalbumin serpins than humans, which probably serves to balance a larger set of proteinases. General recombinant DNA methods were performed according to Ref. 24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989Google Scholar. cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dATP (DuPont NEN) using the random hexamer method (Prime-A-Gene System, Promega). The mouse cytotoxic T cell line R8 has been described (25Palladino M.A. Obata Y. Stockert E. Oettgen H.F. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 572-576PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse allo-immunizations, isolation of spleen and lymph nodes, and culture of isolated spleen and lymph node cells in interleukin-2 containing media were as described (26Sutton, V. R., Vaux, D. L., and Trapani, J. A. (1997) J. Immunol., in press.Google Scholar). Degenerate primers PB117 and PB118 designed to conserved sequences flanking the PI-6 and ovalbumin serpin reactive centers were used as described (14Sun J. Bird C.H. Sutton V. McDonald L. Coughlin P.B. De Jong T.A. Trapani J.A. Bird P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27802-27809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from cells and tissues as described (27Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63143) Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized from the RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989Google Scholar), and amplification and cloning of products as described (14Sun J.

Candidate serpin sequences were identified by the presence of the hinge region motif (Gly-Thr-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala(Thr/Ser)) (2Potempa J. Korzus E. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15957-15960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a conserved Phe-Cys-Ala-Asp sequence not encoded by the primers. The SPI6 cDNA clone was isolated from a mouse day 15 embryo library in λgt10 (CLONTECH). The mBM2A and mBM17 clones were isolated from a mouse bone marrow library in λgt11 (CLONTECH). Approximately 4 × 105plaques were screened in each case at low stringency using a partial cDNA clone of human PI-9 (14Sun J. Bird C.H. Sutton V. McDonald L. Coughlin P.B. De Jong T.A. Trapani J.A. Bird P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27802-27809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Membranes were hybridized at 32 °C in 50% formamide, 5 × SSPE, 0.5% SDS, and 5 × Denhardt's, then washed in 2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 45 °C. Positive plaques were purified and the EcoRI inserts were subcloned into the EcoRI site of pUC118 or pBluescript II KS− (Stratagene). Both strands of each cDNA were sequenced using the Sequenase II system (Amersham) either on overlapping clones generated by directed exonuclease III deletion (Erase-a-Base system, Promega), or by an oligonucleotide walk strategy. Sequences were assembled and analyzed using the DNASIS programs (Hitachi). The SPI6 cDNA was subcloned into theEcoRI site of pSVTf (28Madison E.L. Bird P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 121: 179-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) so that the 5′ end of the clone was closest to the T7 promoter. Purified plasmid DNA was linearized withSalI prior to transcription/translation. For control production of human PI-6, pSVPTI/P (11Coughlin P. Sun J. Cerruti L. Salem H.H. Bird P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9417-9421Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was linearized withSalI. Labeled protein was produced in a coupled TNTTM Wheat Germ Extract system (Promega) using T7 polymerase and incorporating [35S]methionine (DuPont NEN). Translation products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206971) Google Scholar) or native PAGE (30Hames B.D. Gel Electrophoresis of Proteins: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1981: 1-86Google Scholar) followed by fluorography (AmplifyTM, Amersham). For analysis of complex formation, 2 μl of the translation products were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with 2 ng of the appropriate proteinase. Purification of active graB was as described (31Trapani J.A. Browne K.A. Dawson M.J. Smyth M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thrombin was purified as described (32Thompson E.A. Salem H.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1988; 59: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), chymotrypsin, trypsin, leukocyte elastase, pancreatic elastase, and cathepsin G were purchased from Sigma. The SPI6 cDNA was modified by PCR to incorporate a hexa-histidine tag immediately after the initiating methionine. The 1.8-kilobase SPI6 cDNA in λgt10 was used as a template in a PCR primed by 5′-TCTGCCATCATGCATCATCATCATCATCATAATACTCTGTCTGAAGGAAATGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTATGGAGATGAGAACCTGCCACA-3′ (antisense). Amplification, cloning, verification, and expression of the modified SPI6 cDNA inPichia pastoris was as described previously for PI-6 and PI-9 (14Sun J. Bird C.H. Sutton V. McDonald L. Coughlin P.B.

Acta. 1995; 1252: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For stoichiometric determinations, 10 pmol of graB was incubated with different concentrations of SPI6 at 37 °C in 20 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% (w/v) Nonidet-P40 (34Quan L.T. Caputo A. Bleackley R.C. Pickup D.J. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10377-10379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Residual enzyme activity was determined after 15 min by a two-stage assay using Boc-Ala-Ala-Asp-S-benzyl and 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) (35Poe M. Blake J.T. Boulton D.A. Gammon M. Sigal N.H. Wu J.K. Zweerink H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 98-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of inhibition of graB by SPI6 was determined by incubating equimolar enzyme and inhibitor at 37 °C, and determining residual activity periodically (33Sun J. Coughlin P. Salem H. Bird P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1252: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 36Beatty K. Bieth J. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3931-3934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second-order rate constant was calculated as described (33Sun J. Coughlin P. Salem H. Bird P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1252: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The SPI6 cDNA cloned in theP. pastoris expression vector pHILD2 was mutated using the TransformerTM kit (CLONTECH). The selection primer 5′-CGGTGAGCATGCAGACCTTCAAC-3′ removes a uniqueXbaI in pHILD2. The mutagenic primer 5′-GCCATCATAGCATTTTGCTGTGCC-3′ substitutes 337Glu in the SPI6 sequence with Ala. Following verification by DNA sequencing, the mutated SPI6 cDNA was subcloned from pHILD2 to pSVTf for use in the coupled transcription/translation system. Mouse multiple tissue Northern blots containing 2-μg samples of mRNA from various mouse tissues (CLONTECH) were probed with a cDNA comprising the 3′-untranslated region of the SPI6 cDNA (nucleotides 1035–1819). Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C in 5 × SSPE, 10 × Denhardt's, 0.1% SDS, and 50% formamide. Membranes were then washed in 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C and exposed to x-ray film. The membrane was subsequently stripped and re-probed under the same conditions with the mBM2A cDNA. The chromosomal localization of Spi6 was mapped by analysis of the Jackson Laboratory (C57BL/B6JEi × SPRET/Ei)F1 × SPRET/Ei backcross DNA panel (BSS) (37Rowe L.B. Nadeau J.H. Turner R. Frankel W.N. Letts V.A. Epping J.T. Ko M.S.H. Thurston S.J. Birkenmeier E.H. Mamm. Genome. 1994; 5: 253-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). A partial SPI6 cDNA clone (nucleotides 798–1819) generated by the Erase-a-Base system was used in Southern hybridizations to identify a PvuII polymorphism in genomic DNA between Mus musculus (C57BL/B6JEi) and Mus spretus (SPRET/Ei). This was then used to probe a membrane containing approximately 2 μg of PvuII-digested genomic DNA from each of the 94 animals in the BSS panel (21Sun J. Rose J.B. Bird P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16089-16096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Hybridization was in 6 × SSC at 68 °C followed by washing in 1 × SSC at 68 °C. Each DNA sample was scored for the presence or absence of the M. musculus fragment and the results were analyzed by L. Rowe at the Jackson Laboratory using the Map Manager program (38Manly K.F. Mamm. Genome. 1993; 4: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that PI-9 is an inhibitor of graB, and that it is predominantly expressed in immune cells (14Sun J. Bird C.H. Sutton V. McDonald L. Coughlin P.B. De Jong T.A. Trapani J.A. Bird P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27802-27809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). To assess whether a comparable inhibitor exists in mouse cells, we incubated a cytosolic extract from R8 cells with purified human graB. R8 cells are an interleukin-2-dependent mouse cytotoxic lymphocyte line that produce granules and are reminiscent of natural killer cells (25Palladino M.A. Obata Y. Stockert E. Oettgen H.F. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 572-576PubMed Google Scholar). In many respects they resemble the human YT line which we have shown produces large quantities of graB and PI-9 (14Sun J. Bird C.H. Sutton V. McDonald L. Coughlin P.B. De Jong T.A. Trapani J.A. Bird P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27802-27809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, incubation of R8 extracts with graB led to the formation of a 67-kDa complex detected by SDS-PAGE and immunblotting with an anti-graB monoclonal antibody. This resembled the SDS-stable complex formed between graB and PI-9, which is characteristic of serine proteinase-serpin interactions (2Potempa J. Korzus E. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15957-15960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, immunblotting with anti-PI-9 antibodies weakly detected a 42-kDa protein in R8 extracts (data not shown). From these experiments we concluded that a mouse graB inhibitor and homolog of PI-9 is present in R8 cells.Figure 1Identification of a graB binding activity in mouse cells. Cytosolic extracts were prepared from R8 cells and incubated in the absence or presence of 10 ng of purified human graB. Samples were boiled and reduced prior to electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, then immunoblotted with a graB monoclonal antibody. The arrow shows the position of the SDS-resistant complex containing graB.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In a parallel approach we used RT-PCR to identify ovalbumin serpin sequences present in mouse immune tissue. Given its presence in activated lymphocytes (14Sun J. Bird C.H. Sutton V. McDonald L. Coughlin P.B. De Jong T.A. Trapani J.A. Bird P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27802-27809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that PI-9 or its homologs are primarily produced during an immune response. To allow for this, we took cells from the popliteal lymph nodes and spleens of allo-immunized mice. Some of these lymph node and spleen cells were then cultured for 1–2 weeks in the presence of interleukin-2, which selectively activates and promotes the proliferation of cytotoxic lymphocytes (in vitro stimulated). R8 cells and a long-term (>6 months) culture of mouse spleen cells passaged in high levels of interleukin-2 were also examined. The latter cells (designated NK) exhibit natural killer-like, non-MHC restricted cytotoxic function. 2J. Trapani, unpublished results. RNA was prepared from each of these sources and used as a template for cDNA production and PCR. The PCR primers were degenerate oligonucleotides designed to ovalbumin serpin sequences that have been previously used to identify PI-9 (14Sun J. Bird C.H. Sutton V. McDonald L. Coughlin P.B. De Jong T.A. Trapani J.A. Bird P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27802-27809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). These amplify the serpin reactive center loop and candidate sequences are identified by conserved residues inside the primer-binding sites. In our hands this primer pair has amplified PAI-2, MNEI, PI-6, PI-8, PI-9, and heparin cofactor II from various human tissues. 3J. Sun and P. Bird, unpublished results. As shown in Fig. 2, RT-PCR of the mouse cells and tissue identified nine serpin sequences (SPI3, SPI6, mNK10, mAT2, mR86, mNK9, mNK13, mNK21, and mNK26). One of these (SPI3) is the previously described mouse homolog of PI-6 (21Sun J. Rose J.B. Bird P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16089-16096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The relative frequency that these new sequences appeared is indicated in Table I. All but one (mNK26) appeared more than once, in independent clones arising from different samples. All of the new sequences possessed the serpin proximal hinge motif Gly-Thr-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala(Thr/Ser) (39Hopkins P.C.R. Whisstock J. Science. 1994; 265: 1893-1894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) inside the upstream-primer site, indicating that they are functional proteinase inhibitors. In addition, most possessed a Phe-Cys-Ala-Asp motif adjacent to the downstream primer site. The latter motif is found in the ovalbumin serpin subgroup that comprises PI-6, PI-8, PI-9, and MNEI (see Fig. 2).Table IFrequency of new serpin sequences in mouse tissue observed by RT-PCRSequenceSource of RNAR8 cellsNK cellsSpleenPoplitealSpleen in vitroPoplitealin vitroSPI326 /4523 /3549 /6915 /354 /2332 /36SPI616 /454 /353 /692 /353 /232 /36mBM2A0 /450 /350 /690 /350 /230 /36mBM170 /450 /350 /690 /350 /230 /36mNK100 /451 /353 /6910 /353 /230 /36mAT20 /450 /350 /690 /352 /230 /36mR863 /450 /352 /694 /351 /231 /36mNK90 /452 /351 /692 /352 /230 /36mNK130 /452 /3511 /691 /355 /231 /36mNK210 /452 /350 /691 /353 /230 /36mNK260 /451 /350 /690 /350 /230 /36RT-PCR products were cloned and analyzed by DNA sequencing and/or hybridization to specific oligonucleotides. Sequences are shown in Fig.2.

Open table in a new tab RT-PCR products were cloned and analyzed by DNA sequencing and/or hybridization to specific oligonucleotides. Sequences are shown in Fig.2. Spleen and popliteal in vitro samples indicate cells taken from allo-immunized mice and cultured for 3–5 days in the presence of interleukin-2 prior to preparation of RNA. Comparison and alignment of the mouse sequences with the human serpin sequences indicated that only one of the novel sequences (mNK10) has a clear human counterpart. This is probably a homolog of PI-8 since it shows 73% identity in the variable region between the proximal hinge and the Phe-Cys-Ala-Asp motif, and it has an identical P1Arg residue. Surprisingly, sequence comparisons alone revealed no obvious homolog of PI-9. However, the second most frequent sequence arising from R8 cells after SPI3 was SPI6, and this sequence was identified in all the other samples. Although there is only 39% identity between the SPI6 and PI-9 variable regions, inspection and alignment of the SPI6 reactive center with the other serpins suggested that a Glu would be at, or close to, the P1-P1′ bond. Since (i) a Glu at this position is a unique feature of PI-9"
https://openalex.org/W1991662199,"Identification of a new family of proteins (RGS proteins) that function as negative regulators ofG protein signaling has sparked new understanding of desensitization of this signaling process. Recent studies with several mammalian RGS proteins has delineated their ability to interact with and function as GTPase-activating proteins specifically for G proteins in the Gi family. Here, we investigated the functional activity of RGS3 and a truncated form of RGS3 on G protein-coupled receptor-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase, phosphoinositide phospholipase C, and mitogen-activated protein kinase in intact cells. Polymerase chain reaction and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends analyses revealed the tissue-specific expression of a short form of the RGS3 transcript that encodes the approximate carboxyl-terminal half of RGS3. This truncated form of RGS3 (RGS3T) was shown recently to function as a negative regulator of pheromone signaling in yeast (Druey, K. M., Blumer, K. J., Kang, V. R., and Kehrl, J. H. (1996) Nature 379, 742–746). Baby hamster kidney cells transiently transfected with RGS3T cDNA exhibited a pronounced impairment in platelet-activating factor receptor-stimulated inositol phosphate production, a pertussis toxin-insensitive response. Similarly, calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor-stimulated increases in intracellular cAMP and pituitary adenylate-cyclase activating polypeptide receptor-stimulated increases in both cAMP and inositol phosphates were reduced significantly in RGS3T transfectants compared with vector-transfected control cells. In contrast, baby hamster kidney cells transfected with the full-length RGS3 cDNA showed no impairment in cAMP and inositol phosphate production mediated by these G protein-coupled receptors. However, lysophosphatidic acid receptor-stimulated phosphorylation of endogenous ERK1 and ERK2 was impaired markedly in both RGS3 and RGS3T transfectants, demonstrating the functional ability of both RGS forms to modulate Gi-mediated signaling. These results provide the first evidence for regulatory effects of an RGS protein on Gs- and Gq-mediated signaling in intact cells and document that the carboxyl-terminal region of RGS3 comprises the structural domain for this activity.

A myriad of hormones, neurotransmitters, olfactory and taste molecules, and light produce their cellular effects by interacting with seven transmembrane-spanning receptors. In addition to their heptahelical structure, this superfamily of receptors shares a common mode of signal transduction involving interaction with and activation of various heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins). 1The abbreviations used are: G protein, guanine nucleotide-binding protein; bp, base pair(s); CGRP, calcitonin gene-related peptide; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Gα, α subunit of G protein; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; IP, inositol phosphate; kb, kilobase(s); LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; PACAP, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide; PACAPR, PACAP receptor; rPACAPR, rat PACAPR; PAF, platelet-activating factor; PAFR, PAF receptor; rPAFR, rat PAFR; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PI-PLC, phosphoinositide phospholipase C; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RGS3T, truncated form of RGS3; BHK, baby hamster kidney; IL, interleukin.1The abbreviations used are: G protein, guanine nucleotide-binding protein; bp, base pair(s); CGRP, calcitonin gene-related peptide; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Gα, α subunit of G protein; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; IP, inositol phosphate; kb, kilobase(s); LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; PACAP, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide; PACAPR, PACAP receptor; rPACAPR, rat PACAPR; PAF, platelet-activating factor; PAFR, PAF receptor; rPAFR, rat PAFR; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PI-PLC, phosphoinositide phospholipase C; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RGS3T, truncated form of RGS3; BHK, baby hamster kidney; IL, interleukin. Ligand binding to these receptors produces activation of G proteins by stimulating exchange of GTP for GDP on the α subunit of the inactive heterotrimer to promote dissociation into α-GTP and βγ subunits, both of which function as signal transducing molecules by regulating the activities of various cellular effector systems including enzymes and ion channels (1Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Nature. 1993; 365: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Termination of G protein signaling is mediated by the intrinsic GTPase activity of the α subunits resulting in their reassembly with βγ subunits to form the inactive α-GDPβγ heterotrimer.Recent genetic studies have documented the existence of a new gene family encoding proteins that have been named RGS proteins based upon their ability to function as regulators of Gprotein signaling. Initial studies in yeast showed that mutations in the sst2 gene (encoding Sst2p) produced supersensitive pheromone signaling, a response mediated by a G protein-signaling pathway. Dominant gain of function mutations in Sst2p inhibited this G protein signaling pathway showing that Sst2p functioned as a pheromone desensitization factor in yeast (2Dohlman H.G. Apaniesk D. Chen Y. Song J. Nusskern D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 3635-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Similar genetic analysis of the Caenorhabditis elegans Sst2p homolog EGL-10, a protein involved in egg laying and certain periodic behaviors, suggested that it functioned to negatively regulate signaling mediated by the C. elegans G protein GOA-1 (3Koelle M.R. Horvitz R.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Based upon a semiconserved region of approximately 120 amino acids (the “RGS domain”) of Sst2p, EGL-10, and two previously unidentified human gene products, Koelle and Horvitz (3Koelle M.R. Horvitz R.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) used PCR to identify a family of mammalian genes encoding RGS proteins. Southern analysis predicted the existence of at least 15 human RGS genes, all of which share the conserved RGS domain. The functional ability of several RGS proteins to reverse the supersensitive phenotype of yeastsst2Δ mutants and to impair mitogen-activated protein kinase activation by the G protein-coupled IL-8 and PAF receptors recently was demonstrated by Druey et al. (4Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.R. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar).The negative regulatory effects of these novel proteins on G protein signaling appears to result from direct interactions with G protein α subunits resulting in an enhancement in their GTPase activity (5De Vries L.

Thus, RGS proteins are thought to function as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for α subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins in a manner analogous to the action of RasGAP of Ras. Interestingly, the specificity of this GAP activity of the RGS proteins (RGS1, RGS4, RGS10, and GAIP or “Gα interacting protein”) examined in these biochemical studies was limited to G proteins in the Gi family, a finding consistent with evidence demonstrating their selectivity of interaction with these G protein α subunits (6Hunt T.W. Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Peralta E.G. Nature. 1996; 383: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 7Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27209-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). These observations have led to the belief that RGS proteins function as GAPs for proteins in the Gi family of G proteins. This raises an interesting dilemma regarding the physiological significance of such a large gene family for a particular subfamily of G proteins. Surprisingly, no studies have evaluated the ability of any RGS protein to regulate activation of adenylyl cyclase and PI-PLC by G protein-coupled receptors in intact cells. Moreover, the study by Druey et al. (4Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.R. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) represents the only study in which RGS protein regulation of mammalian G protein signaling has been studied in cells.The present study was initiated to investigate the functional activity of RGS3, an RGS protein whose G protein specificity has not been studied, on G protein-coupled receptor-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase and PI-PLC in intact cells. Preliminary examination of the tissue-specific expression of RGS3 transcripts revealed the existence of a transcript encoding a truncated form of RGS3 (RGS3T) encoding the approximate carboxyl-terminal half of RGS3. Cells transfected with RGS3T cDNA demonstrated a pronounced impairment in G protein-coupled receptor stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and PI-PLC, an effect not observed in RGS3 transfectants. However, LPA receptor-stimulated phosphorylation of endogenous ERK1 and ERK2 was markedly impaired in both RGS3 and RGS3T transfectants, demonstrating the functional ability of both RGS forms to modulate Gi-mediated signaling. These findings are the first to document regulatory influences of an RGS protein on Gs in any experimental system and on Gq in intact cells. The finding that this functional activity is encoded by the carboxyl-terminal half of RGS3 indicates that this region comprises a domain of RGS3 that is capable of negatively regulating Gs- and Gq-mediated signaling.RESULTSKoelle and Horvitz (3Koelle M.R. Horvitz R.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) recently identified RGS3 as a member of the mammalian family of RGS proteins by amplifying its partial sequence from rat brain cDNA using degenerate primers to the conserved RGS domains of EGL-10 and two human genes (RGS1 andRGS2) whose function was unknown. At about the same time, Druey et al. (4Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.R. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) reported isolation of a human RGS3 cDNA encoding a 519-amino acid RGS3 protein. Northern analysis revealed a rather wide distribution of RGS3 mRNAs in human tissues and, in addition, the existence of multiple hybridizing bands in many tissues. Because the identity of these hybridizing transcripts is unknown, it is unclear whether the multiple hybridizing bands represent multiple forms of RGS3 mRNA or cross-reactivity of the full-length RGS3 probe with other RGS family members due to the conservation of sequence encoding the RGS domain in this family of proteins.Therefore, we initiated our studies of human RGS3 by examining the tissue expression of its transcript(s) by PCR using primers specific for RGS3 and by sequencing the amplified products to determine their identity(s). Fig. 1 shows the results of amplification using primer pairs encompassing the entire coding sequence of RGS3 and using human tissue cDNA or cDNA libraries as template (Fig. 1,A and B). As shown, the expected 1.6-kb PCR product was amplified from glioma, heart, smooth muscle, and lung but not from brain, liver, or kidney. Sequencing of each of the 1.6-kb products confirmed their identity as cDNAs encoding RGS3. Although PCR is a sensitive technique to detect even a rare transcript, we persistently failed to amplify the 1.6-kb RGS3 cDNA in brain, liver, or kidney using two different cDNA libraries. Although our analysis supports the Northern blotting data of Druey et al.(4Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.R. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) showing the presence of strong hybridization signals in heart, lung, and muscle with low or no detectable signals in brain, our inability to amplify RGS3 cDNAs from liver and kidney is quite at odds with the presence of strong hybridization signals in those tissues in that study. Although Druey et al. (4Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.R. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) found that many tissues expressed either a predominant transcript of 3 kb or comparable levels of the 3-kb transcript and a smaller (∼2 kb) transcript, both kidney and liver expressed high levels of the small transcript and little or none of the 3.0-kb transcript. Thus, our inability to amplify RGS3 cDNAs from kidney, liver, and perhaps brain could result from expression in these tissues of an RGS3 transcript that has a deletion or truncation in either of the regions targeted by our PCR primers.To consider this possibility, we performed PCR using primers to a variety of RGS3 cDNA sequences in an attempt to detect RGS3 transcripts in brain, kidney, and liver. Fig. 1 C shows a typical result from such an experiment. As shown, PCR products of the expected size were amplified from brain, kidney, and liver using primer pairs encompassing nucleotides 937–1590 of RGS3 but not with primers encompassing the entire coding sequence of RGS3. In contrast, both primer pairs readily amplified the expected sized products from heart, lung, smooth muscle, and glioma. Sequencing of the 650–700-bp products amplified from brain, liver, and kidney showed that they were identical to the RGS3 cDNA sequence over this region. These results suggest either that RGS3 transcripts in brain, liver, and kidney are truncated in the 5′ region or that the truncated cDNAs detected in this study arise artifactually from failure of reverse transcriptase to synthesize a complete cDNA copy of the mRNA. It is difficult to understand how this latter possibility could be tissue-specific as would be required to explain the present results. This possibility seems unlikely also due to our inability to amplify a full-length RGS3 cDNA using two different human cDNA libraries as well as a preparation of human brain cDNA.To examine further the possibility that transcripts encoding RGS3 may be truncated at the 5′ end in some tissues, we performed 5′-RACE to identify the 5′ cDNA end of RGS3 in human brain. The results shown in Fig. 1 B suggested that the 5′ end of RGS3 transcripts in human brain extended at least to nucleotide 937. Therefore, we performed seminested PCR with the final round employing the forward anchor primer and a reverse primer to nucleotides 747–773 of RGS3 (Fig. 2, A and B). As shown, a single product of 300 bp was amplified using this strategy, indicating that the 5′ end of the RGS3 transcript in human brain is approximately 521 nucleotides downstream of the translation start site of the full-length transcript (i.e. accounting for the size of the anchor primer). Sequencing of the 300-bp PCR product confirmed that the 5′-RACE product corresponded to nucleotides 527–773 of the RGS3 transcript. These results suggest the existence of a truncated form (RGS3T) of the human RGS3 transcript whose 5′ end is located 527 nucleotides downstream of the translation start site identified for the RGS3 cDNA cloned from human B cells. Such a transcript could arise by alternative splicing; however, there are no introns at appropriate locations to account for such a transcript within a 14.7-kb segment encoding the entire coding sequence of human RGS3 that we isolated recently. 2T. K. Chatterjee, A. Eapen, and R. A. Fisher, unpublished observations. Alternatively, the truncated form could arise from incomplete gene duplication or by use of an alternate promoter site within the RGS3 gene. Examination of the sequence of the truncated form of RGS3 revealed the existence of three in-frame translation start sites located at nucleotides 715–717, 889–891, and 940–942, respectively, that could encode proteins of 281, 223, and 206 amino acids each. These three potential start sites encode RGS proteins whose amino termini are located 151, 93, and 76 amino acids from the start of the conserved RGS domain of RGS3.In view of the present findings, it is of particular interest that Druey et al. (4Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.R. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) reported that expression of a truncated human RGS3 cDNA in yeast cell sst2Δ mutants (i.e. lacking the yeast RGS protein Sstp2) partially complemented the pheromone-supersensitive phenotype of the mutants. The truncated RGS3 cDNA used by these investigators was identical to the 206-amino acid form described above. It is unclear how this clone was obtained and/or why this particular truncation was tested. Nonetheless, Druey et al. (4Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.R. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) found that its ability to reverse the supersensitive phenotype of sst2Δ mutants was 3–10-fold greater than that of RGS3 itself. Although effects of RGS3T(206) were not evaluated on mammalian cell signaling, RGS3 was shown to attenuate IL-8 receptor-mediated activation of MAP kinase (4Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.R. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Because IL-8 receptors couple specifically to Gi2 in human embryonic kidney cells, IL-8 receptor activation of MAP kinase is likely mediated by Gi2 (13Damaj B.B. McColl S.R. Mahana W. Crouch M.F. Naccache P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12783-12789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with evidence demonstrating the specificity of RGS proteins for G proteins in the Gi family (5De Vries L. Mousli M. Wurmser A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11916-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 6Hunt T.W. Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Peralta E.G. Nature. 1996; 383: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 7Watson N.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27209-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). However, the functional evaluation of RGS3 on mammalian cell signaling has not been investigated beyond this study.Therefore, we examined whether RGS3 had any effects on signaling by G proteins other than Gi and whether RGS3T had functional activities on G protein-coupled receptor signaling in mammalian cells. The yeast complementation study by Druey et al. (4Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.R. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) prompted us to select the 206-amino acid form of RGS3T for this study. First, we examined PAFR-mediated activation of PI-PLC in BHK cells cotransfected with pCR3.1 containing cDNAs encoding the rat PAFR and RGS3 or RGS3T. BHK cells transfected with empty pCR3.1 in place of pCR3.1 containing RGS3 and RGS3T cDNAs served as a vector control in these studies. PAF-stimulated IP accumulation in PAFR transfectants was unaffected by overnight treatment with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml), demonstrating that pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins mediate activation of PI-PLC by the PAFR. As shown in Fig.3 A, PAFR-mediated IP accumulation in response to a maximally effective concentration of PAF (100 nm) was reduced significantly in cells transfected with RGS3T cDNA but not in cells transfected with RGS3 cDNA. PAFR activity was reduced to approximately 30% of control values in RGS3T transfectants. Dose-response studies demonstrated that PAF stimulated IP accumulation with the same EC50 value in cells transfected with vector, RGS3, or RGS3T, although the maximal response was reduced significantly in RGS3T transfectants (Fig. 3 B). These results show that the efficacy but not the potency of PAF for stimulation of IP production is reduced in RGS3T transfectants.Figure 3Effects of RGS3 and RGS3T on rPAFR-mediated IP production. A, RGS3T impairs PAF (100 nm)-stimulated IP production. BHK cells were transiently cotransfected with rPAFR cDNA and RGS3 or RGS3T cDNAs in pCR3.1. Cells cotransfected with rPAFR cDNA and empty pCR3.1 vector served as vector control transfectants. Transfected cells were challenged with vehicle or PAF (100 nm), and accumulation of IPs was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.”B, dose-response of PAF-stimulated IP accumulation in cells cotransfected with rPAFR cDNA and empty pCR3.1 or pCR3.1 containing RGS3 or RGS3T cDNAs. *, p < 0.05 compared with response in vector transfectants.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To show further the unique ability of RGS3T to negatively regulate signaling pathways other than those mediated by members of the Gi family of G proteins, we examined the ability of RGS3 and RGS3T to influence CGRP-stimulated cAMP production in BHK cells. CGRP receptors couple to Gs and are expressed endogenously in BHK cells. Therefore, CGRP-stimulated cAMP increases were determined in BHK cells transfected with pCR3.1 containing cDNAs encoding RGS3 or RGS3T as well as with empty vector. Fig.4 A shows that CGRP-stimulated cAMP production was reduced significantly in cells transfected with RGS3T cDNA but not in cells transfected with RGS3 cDNA. CGRP receptor-mediated cAMP production was routinely reduced to 50% or less of control values in RGS3T transfectants with no change in EC50 value for CGRP (Fig. 4 B).Figure 4Effects of RGS3 and RGS3T on CGRP-mediated IP production.

The PACAPR is a member of the multifunctional group III family of G protein-coupled receptors, receptors that stimulate both adenylyl cyclase and PI-PLC. It is presently unclear whether this dual signaling results from receptor coupling to Gs (adenylyl cyclase) and a Gq (PI-PLC) G protein or by receptor coupling to other G proteins that stimulate adenylyl cyclase (requires concomitant Gs activation) and PI-PLC β by their dissociated βγ subunits (14Tang W.-J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1991; 254: 1500-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 15Katz A. Wu D. Simon M.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Fig.5 A shows that PACAPR-mediated IP accumulation was reduced by more than 60% (p < 0.05) in cells transfected with RGS3T but not in cells transfected with RGS3. PACAP-stimulated cAMP accumulation was also significantly reduced in cells transfected with RGS3T but not in cells transfected with RGS3 (Fig. 5 B). Dose-response experiments (not shown) showed that the maximal response but not the EC50 value for stimulation of IP and cAMP accumulation by PACAP was reduced in RGS3T transfectants compared with vector controls.Figure 5Effects of RGS3 and RGS3T on rPACAPR-mediated IP and cAMP production.

LPA receptors activate MAP kinase by coupling to Gi (16Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Allen L.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12706-12710Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) and are expressed endogenously in BHK cells. Therefore, LPA-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous ERK1 and ERK2, required for their activation (17Anderson N.G. Maller J.L. Tonks N.K. Sturgill T.W. Nature. 1990; 343: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar), was examined in BHK cells transfected with pCR3.1 containing cDNAs encoding RGS3 or RGS3T as well as with empty vector. Fig. 6 A shows that LPA stimulated a dramatic increase in phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2, which was reduced significantly in RGS3 and RGS3T transfectants compared with the vector control (Fig. 6, A and B). The finding that LPA receptor-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 was reduced nearly 50% in RGS3 and RGS3T transfectants suggests that RGS3 and RGS3T are extremely effective at inhibiting this response, because all cells express endogenous LPA receptors, ERK1 and ERK2, whereas the efficiency of transfecting RGS3 and RGS3T is probably far less than 100%. These results show that RGS3 and RGS3T are functionally active in attenuating Gi-mediated phosphorylation of MAP kinase in BHK cells and support the findings of Druey et al. (4Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.R. Kehrl J.H.

Here, we show that G protein-coupled receptor activation of adenylyl cyclase and PI-PLC can be inhibited substantially by expression of a truncated form of RGS3, an effect not reproduce"
https://openalex.org/W2131502197,"Cloning a cDNA for human IgGFc binding protein (FcγBP) from human colonic epithelial cells reveals an mRNA and coding region of 17 and 16.2 kilobases, respectively. The predicted amino acid sequence contains 12 occurrences of a 400-amino acid cysteine-rich unit resembling that found in mucin. A motif (CGLCGN) in FcγBP is conserved in MUC2 and prepro-von Willebrand factor. The N-terminal 450-amino acid sequences are necessary and sufficient to confer IgG Fc binding activity. FcγBP mRNA is expressed only in placenta and colonic epithelial cells. These results suggest that FcγBP may play an important role in immune protection and inflammation in the intestines of primates.

For example, immunoglobulin G (IgG) complexes evoke numerous functions. They are phagocytosed by macrophages, activate the lytic potential of cytotoxic lymphocytes and monocytes, and regulate B lymphocyte activation via different receptors for IgGFc (FcγR) expressed on different cells (3Unkeless J.C.

Immunol. 1991; 9: 457-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). Soluble forms of FcR, called immunoglobulin-binding factors, may also be involved in regulatory functions (5Neauport-Sautes C. Dupuis D. Fridman W.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1975; 5: 849-854Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Other types of immunoglobulin-binding proteins are involved in transport of immunoglobulins. For example, poly-immunoglobulin (Ig) receptors have been implicated in the transcytosis and secretion of polymeric IgA and IgM in mucosal epithelial cells (6Mostov K.E. Friedlander M. Blobel G.

Further, neonatal FcR (FcRn) expressed on the apical cell surface binds IgG in milk for endocytosis and subsequent transcytosis to the basolateral cell surface (8Mostov K.E. Simister N.E.

Recently, binding sites specific to the Fc portion of IgG molecules have been reported in human intestinal goblet cells (13Kobayashi K. Blaser M.J. Brown W.R. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 2567-2574PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kobayashi K. Hamada Y. Blaser M.J. Brown W.R. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 68-74PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies K9 and K17, which block the binding to the Fc portion of IgG, react with antigens >200 kDa in immunoblot analysis using non-reduced colonocyte lysates. Under reducing conditions, K17 monoclonal antibody also reacts with proteins around 70–80 kDa. The binding site is immunologically distinct from the known FcγR on leukocytes, is present in mucous granules, and appears to be secreted with mucus into the intestinal lumen (14Kobayashi K. Hamada Y. Blaser M.J. Brown W.R. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 68-74PubMed Google Scholar). In active ulcerative colitis, a marked increase of IgGFc-binding sites in the endoplasmic reticulum and a decrease in mucous granules are observed, apparently reflecting increased synthesis and secretion. 2K. Kobayashi, Y. Hamada, M. J. Blaser, and W. R. Brown, unpublished data. Using monoclonal antibodies K9 and K17, we have cloned a full-length cDNA of about 17 kb, which encodes an IgG Fc binding protein (FcγBP). Expression of an FcγBP cDNA fragment (about 8 kb) confers IgG Fc-binding activity in both COS and CHO cells. Our studies reveal that FcγBP shares some structural features with mucin proteins. So far, the complete primary sequences of mucins MUC1 (15Gendler S.J. Lancaster C.A. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Duhig T. Peat N. Burchell J. Pemberton L. Lalani E.-N. Wilson D. J. Biol.

Notably, the mucin-like protein we characterize here has the biological activity of IgG binding, suggesting that it has an important role in mucosal immune system and inflammation. Human colonic or ileal epithelial cells were isolated as described previously (13Kobayashi K. Blaser M.J. Brown W.R. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 2567-2574PubMed Google Scholar). The epithelial cells were pelleted and resuspended in PBS(−) and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min. Total RNA was prepared with the method of Chomczynski and Sacci (20Chomczynski P. Sacci N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162 (2nd Ed.): 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63290) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA for the cDNA library construction was prepared by affinity purification with oligo(dT)-latex beads (oligotex-dT30, Takara Shuzo Co.). cDNAs were synthesized from the poly(A)+ RNA using random primers and oligo(dT)12–18 primer by Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, as described by the manufacturer (cDNA kit, Amersham Life Science, Inc.). Then,EcoRI-NotI-BamHI linkers (Takara Shuzo Co.) were ligated with the cDNAs. A random primed cDNA library for screening with monoclonal antibodies was fractionated in size greater than 500 bp, with an average of about 1.5 kb, and constructed into the EcoRI site of λgt11 vector (Stratagene). The cDNA library was screened by standard procedures (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with monoclonal antibody K9 or K17 directed against colonic FcγBP. Restriction endonuclease fragments (q and a/b as shown in Fig.1 B) from the isolated cDNA clones were used as probes to isolate longer cDNA clones from the λgt10 library constructed as follows. Poly(A)+ RNA prepared from human colonic epithelial cells was used for synthesis of random primed or oligo(dT)-primed cDNA as described above. Then the cDNA was size-selected on agarose gels (>3 kb) and used to construct λgt10 libraries for the screening with DNA probes. Subsequent screening was carried out with the unamplified library. 2 × 104phage clones were plated on Luria-Bertani agar dish (10 × 13 cm), and the plaques were transferred onto Biodyne A nylon filter (Nippon Genetics Co.). The filters were hybridized with probe q and probe a/b in a solution of 50% formamide, 5 × SSCP, 1 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 42 °C overnight. Filters were washed three times with 0.2 × SSC containing 0.2% SDS at 65 °C for 40 min and exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C overnight. For DNA sequencing, a nest of insert unidirectionally deleted from each end was generated by exonuclease III and mung bean nuclease digestions (Kilo sequence deletion kit, Takara Shuzo Co.) as described in the manufacturer protocol. DNA sequencing of double-stranded plasmid DNAs and single-stranded DNAs rescued with VCSM13 helper phage was performed with standard dye primer-labeled cycle-sequencing techniques using an Applied Biosytems 373A DNA sequencer, and, in some experiments, internal sequencing primers were synthesized with a DNA synthesizer Model 394 (Applied Biosystems) for sequencing. Gene Works 2.3 (IntelliGenetics, Inc.) Macintosh software was used for the DNA sequencing analysis.Figure 1Cloning strategy of full-length cDNA for human FcγBP.

The blots were prehybridized in the same solution as described in the screening method. Hybridization was performed with probe a, q, or y in the same solution at 42 °C overnight. The blots were washed 3 times with 0.2 × SSC and 0.2% SDS at 65 °C and exposed to x-ray film. High-molecular-weight DNA was isolated from human colon epithelial cells by the methods of Nelson and Krawetz (22Nelson J.E. Krawetz S.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 207: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Animal genomic DNAs were purchased fromCLONTECH. Each DNA (5 μg) was digested with restriction enzyme EcoRI, electrophoresed in 0.7% agarose gel, and transferred to nylon membrane under alkali conditions. The filter was hybridized with a 32P-labeled 700-bp fragment of probe a. EMBL3 SP6/T7 human leukocyte genomic library (CLONTECH) was screened by plaque hybridization using a 32P-dCTP random primer-labeled 908-bpBamHI fragment of clone NZ4 and a 32P-5′ end-labeled synthetic 33-mer nucleotide RPS1 (GCTCCAGCCCAGAGTATCCACCAGCTCCATAGG, which is complementary to nucleotide sequences at the position of +17 to +49 of the NZ4 cDNA) as a hybridization probe. Hybridization was performed at 42 °C in a hybridization solution containing 5 × SSPE, 50 (for pNZ4 probe) or 20% (for RPS1 probe) formamide, 2.5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml heat-denatured salmon testis DNA. Filters were washed five times for 15 min in 0.2 × SSC with 0.2% SDS at 65 °C (for NZ4 probe) or 0.5 × SSC with 0.1% SDS at 55 °C (for RPS1 probe). Phages yielding positive signals on duplicate filters were purified, and the fragments digested with restriction enzymes, including XhoI and SacI, were subcloned into pBluescriptSK(+). Antisence 50-mer (5′-GCTGATAGTTCTGCAGGAAGGCTGTGAGGAATTCC TCTCTGGCCAGTGTTC) and 33-mer (5′-GCTCCAGCCCAGAGTATCCACCAGCTCCATAGG-3′) oligonucleotides, respectively complementary to nucleotides +95 to +144 and +17 to +49, were synthesized and purified by using an OPC cartridge (Applied Biosystems) followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 50-mer oligonucleotide primer was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara Shuzo Co.) and was used for the extension of cDNA from 2.5 mg of poly(A)+ RNA, which was isolated from either N2 cells or human colon epithelium cells using Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Toyobo Co.). The extension products were analyzed on a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel. A universal primer was used to prime a sequencing ladder from single strand M13mp18 template as size markers. For preparation of S1 probe, the end-labeled 33-mer oligonucleotide was annealed to single-stranded DNA that was derived from XhoI/EcoRI fragment of GHFc and contained the 5′-flanking region of FcγBP gene, extended with BcaBest polymerase (Takara Shuzo Co.) at 60 °C for 10 min, and digested withBamHI. The resultant double-stranded S1 probe was purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 50,000 cpm of the S1 probe was hybridized at 45 °C with 50 μg of total RNA isolated from colon epithelium cells, and the mixture was subjected to S1 nuclease digestion. PolymorphicSmaI restriction site of the FcγBP gene was analyzed in four cases of normal part of the colon epithelium from patients harboring colon cancer and in 6 cases of normal blood lymphocytes. The PCR reaction mixture contained 0.5–1 μg of DNA, 200 mmeach dNTP, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.4, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 units Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Cetus), and 20 pmol of each primer set in a total volume of 50 ml. The following oligonucleotide primers for PCR were synthesized: BC1 (forward 5′-ACCACTCCTTCGATGGCC-), GS4R (reverse 5′-TGGTGCCGAGGGCAGCCACG-3′), GS1 (forward 5′-ACCTGTAACTATGTGCTGGC-3′), and GS3R (reverse 5′-ACAGCAGGGTTGCCCCGG-3′). Reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was also carried out. Total RNA (0.6 μg) from N2 cells was used as starting material. The first strand synthesis was performed at 60 °C for 30 min using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase with primer GS3R or GS4R followed by inactivation of the enzyme at 95 °C for 5 min, and then each forward primer was added to the mixture. The thermal cycle profile for both PCR and RT-PCR was as follows: 95 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1.5 min, 72 °C for 2.5 min for 30 cycles. Each 7 ml of the amplification product was digested with 50 units ofSmaI in a total volume of 10 ml at 30 °C for at least 12 h. The digested-amplification products were electrophoretically separated on 2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining under UV-light. Quantitative determination of products was carried out using scan analysis software with photographs of the gels. pcDL-SRα296 vector (23Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J.-I. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K.-I.

Nolan C.M. Oshima A. Sly W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16230-16235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contains metallothionein promoter for foreign cDNA expression and dhfr gene for selection of clones and gene amplifying. Plasmids to express about half of full-length cDNA were constructed as follows. Five cDNA fragments (see Fig. 1) were used for construction of expression cDNA. The fragment of nucleotide 1 (5′ end) to nucleotide 313 (BglII) was derived from clone NZ4, nucleotide 314 (BglII) to nucleotide 1244 (BstXI) was from C72, nucleotide 1245 (BstXI) to nucleotide 1664 (HincII) was from Y11, nucleotide 1665 (HincII) to nucleotide 4442 (BamHI) was from X1, and nucleotide 4443 (BamHI) to nucleotide 7784 (3′ end of the clone) was from V11. The fragments were ligated to each other, and the ligated 7.9-kb cDNA fragment was inserted at the cloning site of pcDL-SRα296, which was under control of the SV40 promoter, to yield pSR-NV11. The deletion constructs were prepared as follows. (i) The 5′ end-BglII fragment of NZ4 clone was ligated to theBglII site of C72 clone to produce NZ. (ii) NZC was ligated to the ∼420-bp fragment of Y11 clone at the BstXI site to yield NZCY. (iii) The XhoI (cloning site on a vector)-BstXI fragment from NZC was ligated to theBstXI-HincII fragment from Y11, and the resultant 1.7-kb fragment was inserted in the HincII-digested X1 clone to produce NX. (iv) NV11 was recovered from the plasmid by digestion with NotI and inserted in pUC119, of which theHincII site changed to NotI site to generate pUC-NV11. pUC-NV11 was digested with HincII,BssHII, Tth111I, or SplI andSpeI, respectively, and each digest containing vector sequences was self-ligated to produce ▵Hinc, ▵BssH, ▵Tth, or ▵Spl, respectively. (v) ▵Tth, NX, and ▵Hinc were digested with BssHII, and then each digest containing vector sequences was self-ligated, respectively, to generate ▵BssH/Tth, NX, ▵BssH, and ▵Hinc/BssH. (vi) NotI-digested insert of V11 was blunted by Klenow fragment and was inserted into the blunted SpeI site of NZC to produce NZCV11. For expression, the original initiation site of each construct was alive except for X1. To express clone X1, an oligonucleotide adapter containing the initiation site sequences originated from FcγBP cDNA (or NV11), intervened between HindIII- andEcoRI-site sequences, was designed as follows (5′-AAGCTTCTGCAGCCATGGGGGATCC-3′). The oligonucleotide was inserted into HindIII-EcoRI site of pBLS-STOP to make transcription start followed by cDNA sequences. The insertion sequences of clone X1 digested with EcoRI were ligated intoEcoRI site of pBLS-STOP to produce X1. Stop codon sequences were also designed as follows. The two adapter sequences were synthesized (upper strand 5′-CTAGTTAGTTAGTTAGGGTACCGC-3′ and lower strand 5′-GGCCGCGGTACCCTAACTAACTAA-3′). This double strand provided stop codon in all frames. It was inserted between SpeI andNotI site of pBluescript II SK(+), followed by modification of cloning site of XhoI to XbaI site to yield pBLS-STOP vector. All constructs encoding FcγBP derivatives were cloned into pBLS-STOP, and the insertion sequence containing stop codons was subcloned into pcDL-SRα296 for protein expression. The expression vectors containing these deletion constructs were transfected transiently in COS7 cells, and produced proteins were stained with Fc fragment of human IgG or monoclonal antibodies K9 and K17. For transient expression, COS7 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10,000 IU/liter penicillin, and 100 mg/l streptomycin. COS7 cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells/35-mm tissue culture dish a day before transfection. Then the cells were transfected with pSRNV11 by lipofection procedure using 10 μg of DNA and 5 μl of Transfectam (Promega) per 500 μl of RPMI 1640 medium. After 6 h, medium was changed and cultured for a further 48 h. For permanent expression, CHO cells were transfected with a pMSXND vector bearing FcγBP cDNA fragment, NV11, or the deleted cDNA by lipofection. Cells were passaged the day before transfections, and the subconfluent 2 × 105 cells were treated with CsCl-purified plasmids in the same way as COS cells. The cell medium was replaced with F-12 medium supplemented with nucleotides and 10% FBS and incubated at 37 °C for 2 days. Then the cells were selected in α-minimum Eagle's medium without nucleotides containing 1 mg/ml G418, 10% FBS, and antibiotics. After culturing under these conditions for 14 days, the clonal cell lines were obtained by limiting dilution and were examined for FcγBP expression by immunostaining. Then the clonal cell lines were propagated with increasing concentrations of methotrexate, starting with 0.02–6.4 μm. The gene-amplified cells were confirmed by a higher amount of expression of FcγBP, and clonal cells were obtained by limiting dilution. Random primed cDNA libraries (>600 bp) were constructed from human colonic epithelial cells using λgt11 as a vector. The λgt11 human epithelial cell library was first screened with two independent monoclonal antibodies against FcγBP, K9, and K17 that block the binding of IgG Fc fragment (14Kobayashi K. Hamada Y. Blaser M.J. Brown W.R. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 68-74PubMed Google Scholar). The screening of 1 × 106 recombinants with monoclonal antibody K9 led to the isolation of a cDNA clone 618 bp long (Fig.1 B) in the region defined by nucleotide position 13788–14405 (probe q). Furthermore, the screening of 6 × 105 recombinants with monoclonal antibody K17 led to the isolation of 7 clones, one of which was about 1300 bp long and could be digested with BamHI into 2 fragments (a and b). These adjacent fragment probes (a/b) were corresponding to nucleotide positions 7368–8045/8046–8697 or 10970–11649/11650–12300, respectively. The nucleotide sequences of probes q and a/b revealed that they are independent cDNA clones. However, both probes hydridize to a single band of >16 kb on a Northern blot (described below). These results suggest that the two clones are derived from the same mRNA for FcγBP. Three probes, q, a, and b, were used to determine the full-length cDNA sequence. Out of more than 70 clones isolated, 10 clones (T5, A43, A8, A31, A40, A53, V11, X1, Y1, and C72) were shown to cover most of full-length cDNA for FcγBP except for 5′-terminal sequence (Fig. 1 C). Sequence analysis of these clones showed that the FcγBP cDNA is composed of three homologous units that are tandemly repeated (see Fig.1 B). Probe q hybridizes with 3 regions, as does probe a/b. Each unit shares more than 95% homology with one another. Although a cDNA clone representing the 3′-terminal region, T5, was isolated from oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library, no 5′-terminal clones (i.e. extending from C72) were isolated from human colonic libraries. Thus, we constructed a cDNA library of human N2 cell line, which can differentiate into goblet cells and express FcγBP (25Phillips T.E. Huet C. Bilbo P.R. Podolsky D.K. Louvard D. Neutra M.R. Gastroenterology. 1988; 94: 1390-1403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 26Kobayashi K. Brown W.R. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1994; 3: 526-533Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Using a 5′-terminal probe derived from the C72 clone, we obtained a clone, NZ4, containing the 5′-terminal ATG. Sequences flanking the first ATG (GCC(A/G)CCATGG) in NZ4 clone are consistent with those described by Kozak (27Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4181) Google Scholar) for an initiation codon. The complete nucleotide sequence data has been submitted to the DDBJ, EBI, and GenBankTM Data Banks; a map of the major restriction enzyme sites is shown in Fig. 1 A. A full-length sequence of the predicted amino acids is shown in Fig. 2 A. A dot matrix plot of the entire predicted amino acid sequence against itself revealed 12 repeated domains flanked by unique N-terminal (450 amino acids) and C-terminal (160 amino acids) domains (data not shown). These 12 repeated domains (r1-r12 in Fig. 2 B) were classified into 5 types that shared 30–40% homology. The R1 unit (r3-r5) corresponds to the first 5′-terminal A-B-C-Q region in Fig. 1. The repeated domains r1-r12 are each composed of about 400 amino acids. As some mucin-related proteins have been reported, the predicted amino acid sequence of human FcγBP was compared with those amino acid sequences, and a broader search for similarities to other protein sequences was carried out using Gene Works (IntelliGenetics, Inc.) loading GenBankTM Release 8.7. These analyses demonstrate that the FcγBP sequence has significant similarity to portions of MUC2 and prepro-von Willebrand factor (vWF) but that it does not have homology to either Fc receptors or IgG-like domain. A close examination reveals that each repeated domain of FcγBP was homologous with four MUC2 D domains and to four prepro-vWF D2 domains (about 30% homology). Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 3, FcγBP, vWF, and MUC2 all have the conserved amino acid motif CGLCGN. These sequences are also characteristic of thioredoxin (28Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and protein disulfide isomerase (29Edman J.C. Ellis L. Blacher R.W. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Nature. 1985; 317: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Another feature of this protein is that it is high in cysteine content. As shown in Fig. 2 B, 8.1% of the amino acid residues are cysteines (cf. 5.7% for human serum albumin (hSA)). A total content of the predicted serine/threonine residues for O-linked glycosylation is 12.3% (Fig.2 B, cf. 9.3% for hSA). Further, the content of hydrophobic and neutral amino acids is 78.6% (cf. 63.8% for hSA). Northern blot analysis was carried out to detect the expressed mRNA for FcγBP from colonic epithelial cells. Probes q, a, or y (an 800-bp probe derived from the 5′-terminal region of clone Y1) were used. A single band of larger than 15 kb with a smeared front was detected with each probe, as shown in Fig.4 A. Probe y gave the same Northern blot pattern as with probes q and a, indicating that these three probes hybridize to the same mRNA. The same result was obtained using a part of clone NZ4 as a probe (data not shown). As described above, however, mRNA size is critical for determining the number of 4.5-kb units (A-B-C-Q). To determine more precisely the size of the FcγBP mRNA, we compared it with mRNAs for ryanodine receptor (15.2 kb) and for dystrophin (14 kb), which are among the longest mRNAs reported. We prepared the respective probe for them by PCR method, using poly(A)+ RNA from human cytoskeletal muscle. Since FcγBP has been shown to be present in human N2 cells by immunohistochemical staining with monoclonal antibodies K9 and K17 (26Kobayashi K. Brown W.R. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1994; 3: 526-533Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), we carefully prepared the mRNA from the N2 cells. As shown in Fig. 4 B, Northern analysis using probe a showed that the size of our mRNA was estimated to be 17 kb by relative mobility of two standard mRNAs. These results confirmed the fact that a 4.5-kb-long unit was repeated 3 times, in addition to 5′-terminal and 3′-terminal unique sequences. To confirm that the 5′-terminal cDNA sequence of human FcγBP is identical to genomic DNA, approximately 2 × 106 recombinant phages from a human leukocyte genomic library were screened using the 5′-terminal fragment of clone NZ4 as a probe. One independent clone, GHFc1, and two overlapping clones, GHFc2 and GHFc3, were identified. A 1908-bpSacI/EcoRI fragment at the 5′-flanking region from GHFc1 as well as the exon 2/intron boundary regions from GHFc2 and GHFc3 were subcloned into pBluescript and sequenced using exonuclease III-generated deletion templates. Fig. 5 shows the sequence of the first and second exons of genomic DNA, which completely coincides with the corresponding region of cDNA. The exon/intron splice sites were confirmed to be GT-AG border element consensus sequences. The first exon contains the putative ATG initiation codon suitable for Kozak's rule (27Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4181) Google Scholar), as described above. Examination of the 5′ untranslated region reveals a TGA in-frame stop codon at −78 position of the gene. However, no TATA, CAAT, or other promoter/enhancer motifs were detected within 2 kb further upstream (data not shown). To identify the transcription start sites, primer extension and S1 mapping were also performed. Primer extension analysis using an oligonucleotide complementary to the sequence double-underlined in Fig.5 reveals multiple start sites (see Fig. 6 A). Three major bands are located at +27, +28, and +30 nucleotides downstream. The upper broad band is located at −5 to +25 in a boundary region of 5′ terminus for cDNA clone NZ4. Similar results are observed using human colon epithelial cells, except for additional faint bands. Clusters of multiple start sites are common for genes lacking a TATA box (30Harrison L. Ascione A.G. Wilson III, D.M. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5556-5564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6 B, the end-labeled 205-bp fragment hybridizes with total RNA from human colon epithelial cells protected from S1 nuclease digestion, and several hybrids are detected. These products also reveal multiple start sites, and the longest digestion showed the predominant start site to be an adenosine residue that is only 9-bp upstream from the deduced ATG translation initiation site. Thus, the same transcription start sites are suggested by the broad extension band seen in primer extension analysis. To detect sequence variants and to st"

To study the role of protein phosphatases in the signal transduction leading to IL-8 production, a subline of HL-60 (C-15) was treated with okadaic acid (OA) and sodium orthovanadate (VA), inhibitors of phosphoserine/phosphothreonine phosphatase and phosphotyrosine phosphatase, respectively. Both OA and VA dramatically increased IL-8 secretion up to 200-fold in the HL-60 cells. OA and VA stimulation was accompanied by a marked increase in IL-8 mRNA expression and also by activation of a transcription factor, NF-κB. In addition, an essential role of the NF-κB site in the IL-8 gene activation was confirmed by the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay. IL-8 production by OA or VA was inhibited by protein kinase inhibitors, including staurosporine, H-7, K252a, herbimycin A, and genistein.Both OA and VA induced significant tyrosine phosphorylation of p44, which was presumed to be Erk1, a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, with concomitant activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase activity.

The phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of cellular proteins appears to be a major regulatory mechanism for cytokine production. In fact, inhibitors of protein phosphatases including okadaic acid (OA) or calyculin A (CA) are known to be good stimulators for IL-1 or TNF-α (18Sung S.J. Walters J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5802-5809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Xia H-Z Kannapell C.C. Fu S.M. Sung S.J. Blood. 1993; 82: 2806-2812Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore attempted to investigate the role of protein phosphorylation and/or dephosphorylation in IL-8 induction in a human promyelocytic cell line HL-60 subline, using OA and sodium orthovanadate (VA), specific inhibitors of phosphoserine/phosphothreonine phosphatase and tyrosine phosphatase, respectively. Our finding demonstrated that both OA and VA induced high levels of IL-8 production and its mRNA expression. Further, we analyzed the molecular mechanism of IL-8 gene activation by OA or VA in the HL-60 (C-15) cell line. We observed that mutation of the NF-κB binding site abolished the induction of CAT activity upon stimulation with OA or VA, indicating the essential role of NF-κB site also for the phosphatase inhibitor-induced IL-8 gene activation. In addition, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed that OA or VA induced the formation of the NF-κB complexes. We also investigated the relationship of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and IκB-α degradation during the IL-8 gene activation. OA, staurosporine, and genistein were obtained from Research Biochemicals International. VA was obtained from Sigma. Herbimycin A, H-7, H-8, KN62, and KN252a were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Inc. (Osaka, Japan). [γ-32P]ATP, enhanced chemiluminescence reagents, and a p42/p44 MAPK enzyme assay system were obtained from Amersham (Tokyo, Japan).

The HL-60 cell line was maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 2 mm l-glutamine. Immunoreactive IL-8 was quantitated using an ELISA method as described elsewhere (22Ko Y.C. Mukaida N. Panyutich A. Voitenok N.N. Matsushima K. Kawai T. Kasahara T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 149: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This ELISA method detected at least 30 pg/ml of IL-8 and did not cross-react with other known members of the CXC and CC chemokine families. Total RNA was extracted from the cultured cells by 4 m guanidine thiocyanate. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (23Kasahara T. Yagisawa H. Yamashita K. Yamaguchi Y. Akiyama Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 167: 1242-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cells (106) were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.5% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 4 mm EDTA, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mmsodium molybdate, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by stirring for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation for 20 min at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C, protein concentration was determined, and the samples were stored at −80 °C. For the immunoprecipitation, 5 × 106cells were suspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer, and the lysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 rpm. Twenty μl of a slurry of pansorbin (Calbiochem) and 3 μg of anti-IκB-α Ab (kindly provided by Dr. Nancy Rice, NCI-Frederick Research and Development Center, Frederick, MD) were added to the supernatant and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The precipitates spun down were washed three times with lysis buffer and were then boiled for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer. The sample was electrophoresed in 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a membrane filter followed by the Western blot using anti-IκB-α Ab and peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG, as described elsewhere (16Ishikawa Y.

An equal volume of 2 × Laemmli sample buffer was added to the cell lysate prepared as described above. Samples were boiled for 10 min, and equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h and then incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-MAPK or anti-phospho-MAPK Abs for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation with secondary Ab coupled to horseradish peroxidase, detection was made using the enhanced chemiluminescence system. Molecular sizes were determined by the relative mobilities of prestained molecular weight markers. MAPK activity was measured using the p42/44 MAPK enzyme assay system according to the manufacturer's instruction (Amersham). Cell lysates (15 μl) prepared as described above were incubated with a substrate peptide (human EGF receptor) in 10 μl of kinase buffer. The reaction was initiated of 5 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (6 nmol, 37 kBq). The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by transferring the reaction mixture onto p81 filter paper. The filters were washed three times in 75 mm phosphoric acid to remove nonreacted [γ-32P] ATP, and air-dried. Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. CAT expression vectors harboring the 5′-flanking region of the IL-8 gene spanning the −133 region and C/EBP, AP-1, and NF-κB mutants were constructed as described previously (9Mukaida N. Mahe Y.

For transient expression studies, 2 × 106 HL-60 (C-15) cells were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA by the DEAE-dextran (200 μg/ml) method. After 5 h, cells were incubated with or without stimulants for 2 days. The CAT activity in cell extract was determined as described elsewhere (9Mukaida N. Mahe Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol.

Transfection and CAT assay were performed at least three times with each CAT expression vector, and representative results are shown here. We performed CAT assays using several different concentrations of proteins so that the assay is within linear range. 108cells were stimulated with OA or VA for 30 min, and nuclear extracts were prepared. Protein concentration of nuclear extracts was determined and assayed for NF-κB activity or stored at −80 °C until further use. EMSA was performed essentially as described elsewhere (9Mukaida N.

The sequences of NF-κB oligonucleotide and mutated NF-κB used in this EMSA were 5′-CGTGGAATTTCCTCTG-3′ and 5′-CGTTAACTTTCCTCTG-3′, respectively. A kinase assay was performed using immunoprecipitates of anti-Erk1 mAb. The immune complex was washed twice with kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol). The assays were initiated by the addition of 1 μg of substrate protein and 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (220TBq/mmol) in a final volume of 25 μl. Reactions were terminated after 30 min at 30 °C by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. The phosphorylation of the substrate protein was examined after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography. GST-IκB-α fusion protein was prepared as described elsewhere (16Ishikawa Y. Mukaida N. Kuno K. Rice N. Okamoto S-I. Matsushima K. J. Biol.

When HL-60 was stimulated with OA or VA, a significant amount of IL-8 was produced in the culture supernatants. HL-60 cultured without any exogenous stimuli released a marginal level of IL-8 (<0.5 ng/ml). It should be noted that both OA and VA were effective at a narrow range of concentration with maximal activation at 100 nm and 80 μm, respectively (Fig. 1). The effect of OA and VA was limited by their toxicity, which became apparent at concentrations greater than 100 nm (OA) and 200 μm (VA). Since induction of IL-8 was greatest at 100 nm (OA) or 80 μm (VA), these concentrations were used in further experiments to study the effect of these stimulants. As determined by kinetic analysis, IL-8 production induced by OA or VA was detectable at 3–6 h with maximal levels at 12–24 h (data not shown). OA increased IL-8 both in the supernatants and in cell lysate, with each 200- and 100-fold increase above unstimulated control. The effect of VA on IL-8 production was similar to that of OA, although the magnitude of IL-8 production was lower than that of OA. IL-8 production induced by OA or VA was still much higher than the levels induced by TNF-α (Fig.2). These results indicated that both OA and VA by themselves are effective stimulants for IL-8 production. When the simultaneous addition of OA and VA was tested, no significant synergism, only an additive effect, was observed (data not shown).Figure 1Dose-dependent effect of OA and VA on IL-8 production from the HL-60 (C-15) cell line. HL-60 (C-15) cells (5 × 105 cells/ml) were stimulated with various concentrations of OA (□, nm) or VA (○, μm) for 24 h. IL-8 content in the culture supernatants was determined by an ELISA.

Therefore, we examined whether phosphatase inhibitors modulate TNF-α-induced IL-8 production. As shown in Fig. 2, additive or weak synergistic effects were observed between TNF-α (20 ng/ml) and lower doses of OA (20 nm) and VA (10 μm), suggesting that phosphatase inhibitor did not interfere with TNF-α- induced IL-8 production, but rather acted cooperatively. We also examined the effect of OA and VA on the normal human blood monocytes. As shown in Table I, both OA and VA increased IL-8 production only marginally, with a 1.3–1.7-fold increase above control, in which unstimulated monocytes spontaneously produced high levels of IL-8. Rather, higher doses of OA (50–100 nm), which were optimal for IL-8 production by HL-60 cells, inhibited IL-8 production, suggesting the differential effects of phosphatase inhibitors on the primary monocytes and leukemic cell line.Table IInduction of IL-8 in human blood monocytes treated with OA or VA with or without LPS stimulationOAIL-8 productionVAIL-8 productionNo LPS1 μg/ml LPSNo LPS1 μg/ml LPSnMng/mlμMng/ml050 ± 2.555 ± 1.0051 ± 2.155 ± 2.1585 ± 4.21-ap < 0.005 compared with the value without OA or VA.72 ± 2.51-bp < 0.01 compared with the value without OA or VA.1055 ± 5.766 ± 3.01-ap < 0.005 compared with the value without OA or VA.1064 ± 3.61-ap < 0.005 compared with the value without OA or VA.91 ± 2.11-ap < 0.005 compared with the value without OA or VA.5058 ± 2.51-bp < 0.01 compared with the value without OA or VA.70 ± 3.61-ap < 0.005 compared with the value without OA or VA.2060 ± 4.21-cp < 0.05 compared with the value without OA or VA.56 ± 4.510068 ± 4.61-bp < 0.01 compared with the value without OA or VA.76 ± 4.61-bp < 0.01 compared with the value without OA or VA.5030 ± 5.61-bp < 0.01 compared with the value without OA or VA.29 ± 2.11-ap < 0.005 compared with the value without OA or VA.20055 ± 5.182 ± 4.71-ap < 0.005 compared with the value without OA or VA.10024 ± 4.51-ap < 0.005 compared with the value without OA or VA.22 ± 2.61-ap < 0.005 compared with the value without OA or VA.Monocytes were separated from normal individuals by adherence onto plastic dishes. 1 × 105 cells/well of monocytes were stimulated with varying doses of OA or VA in the presence or absence of LPS.

Values are the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. To confirm whether the increase of IL-8 was accompanied by the transcription of the IL-8 gene, we examined the expression of IL-8 mRNA. Northern blot analysis showed that IL-8 mRNA was detected as early as 1 h, and OA elicited a dramatic induction of IL-8 mRNA at 6–12 h (Fig. 3). The increase of IL-8 mRNA peaked at 12 h of OA treatment and declined at 24 h. Similarly, VA elicited a moderate but significant induction of IL-8 mRNA without a significant decline of IL-8 mRNA at 24 h. To determine if OA and VA contributes to IL-8 mRNA stabilization, we measured the half-life of IL-8 mRNA, by incubating the cells with OA or VA for 3 h, followed by the treatment with actinomycin D. The half-life (t½) of IL-8 mRNA from unstimulated cells was approximately 5 h, while those of OA- or VA-treated cells were prolonged more than 10 h (data not shown). These results unambiguously indicated that both OA and VA increased stability of IL-8 mRNA markedly, thus contributing to the sustained expression of IL-8 mRNA. To investigate which type of protein kinase(s) was involved in the stimulation with OA or VA, HL-60 cells were treated with staurosporine, a nonspecific protein kinase inhibitor. Staurosporine at 100 nm completely blocked the increase of IL-8 by OA or VA (Fig. 4), suggesting that a basal level of protein phosphorylation is necessary for the action of OA or VA. Protein kinase C inhibitors, H-7 and K252a, markedly blocked IL-8 production induced by OA or VA with an IC50 of H-7 and K252a at 10 and 20 μm, respectively (Fig. 4). HA1004, an analog of H-7, a weak protein kinase C inhibitor, was inactive even at 100 μm (data not shown). In addition, the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, genistein and herbimycin A, significantly inhibited the increase of IL-8 production by OA or VA, with the IC50 of genistein at 6–10 μm and that of herbimycin A at 1 μm, indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation is essential for the IL-8 induction by OA or VA. On the other hand, treatment with KN-62, a calmodulin-dependent kinase inhibitor, had no effect. Similarly, H-8, PKA, and cGMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitors showed only marginal inhibitory effects on OA and VA stimulation. These results suggested that protein kinase C as well as tyrosine kinase are involved in the stimulation of IL-8 production by OA or VA. However, no direct evidence was obtained on the involvement of the cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases and calmodulin-dependent kinases. To delineate the target proteins involved in protein phosphorylation, lysates of OA- or VA-stimulated cells were prepared, electrophoresed, and immunoblotted with an anti-phosphotyrosine Ab (clone 4G10). Stimulation with OA or VA for 1 h induced increased tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, particularly a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 44 kDa (p44) (Fig. 5). It should be of note that no significant tyrosine phosphorylation of p44 was detected in lysates of unstimulated cells. Assuming that p44 might be a member of the MAPK family, which plays a crucial role in signal transduction from receptor tyrosine kinases (24Pelech S.L. Sanghera J.S. Trends Biol. Sci. 1992; 17: 233-238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-MAPK or phospho-MAPK Abs. When lysates of OA or VA-stimulated cells were electrophoresed and immunoblotted with rabbit anti-MAPK (rat Erk1/2) Ab, 44-kDa (Erk1) and 42-kDa (Erk2) bands were consistently detected 0.5, 1, and 3 h after the stimulation with OA or VA (Fig.6 A). Immunoblotting using anti-phospho-MAPK Ab, which recognizes phosphorylated MAPK (phosphorylated Erk1 and -2), revealed that a phosphorylated 44-kDa protein was detected 30 min after stimulation with OA or VA and increased gradually until 3 h (Fig.6 B), indicating that tyrosine-phosphorylated p44 is likely to be an Erk1 of the MAPK family. In accordance with the above finding, we investigated whether MAPK activity was induced by OA and VA treatment, i.e. lysates from OA- or VA-stimulated cells were prepared and assayed for MAPK activity. Time kinetics of the MAPK activity by 100 nm OA or 80 μm VA stimulation were shown in Fig. 7. After a 30-min stimulation with OA or VA, MAPK activity rapidly increased, reaching a maximal level at 1 h, which was maintained thereafter. Thus, a good correlation was observed between OA- or VA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and MAPK activity. It should be noted that herbimycin A (5 μg/ml), an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, inhibited MAPK activity almost completely (data not shown). Since it has been demonstrated that both TNF-α- and IL-1-induced IL-8 gene activation requires the NF-κB site in the 5′-flanking region of the IL-8 gene (9Mukaida N. Mahe Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21128-21133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Yasumoto K. Okamoto S. Mukaida N. Murakami S. Mai M. Matsushima K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 13289-13295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we determined whether the NF-κB site as well as AP-1 and C/EBP sites are prerequisite as well for the OA- or VA-induced IL-8 gene activation. Since CAT activity transfected with −133-CAT expression vectors was normally induced by OA or VA (Fig. 8 B), the mutants of the AP-1, C/EBP, or NF-κB sites were constructed as shown in Fig.8 A. Mutation of AP-1 or C/EBP/NF-IL-6 had little effect on the induction of CAT activity upon stimulation with OA or VA, indicating that these sites were not essential for gene regulation by these agents. On the other hand, mutation of the NF-κB site completely abolished the induction of CAT activity upon stimulation with OA or VA (Fig. 8 B), indicating the essential role of the NF-κB site for IL-8 gene activation by these phosphatase inhibitors, as was the case in IL-1-induced IL-8 production in the glioblastoma cell line T98G (11Mukaida N. Morita M. Ishikawa Y. Rice N. Okamoto S. Kasahara T. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13289-13295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To delineate the role of a nuclear factor, NF-κB, in the OA- and VA-induced IL-8 mRNA transcription, we performed an EMSA using nuclear extracts from the OA- or VA-stimulated HL-60 cells. Nuclear extracts from OA-treated HL-60 cells contained NF-κB complex as indicated, utilizing an authentic NF-κB oligo probe (Fig.9, lane 2), whereas no specific NF-κB·DNA complex formation was observed in extracts from unstimulated cells (lane 1). The specificity of the complex was confirmed by competition experiments using an unlabeled NF-κB probe or an unlabeled mutated NF-κB probe. The band disappeared in the presence of an excess amount of an unlabeled NF-κB probe (lane 4), whereas the band did not disappear in the presence of an excess amount of unlabeled mutated NF-κB probe (lane 3). Moreover, a labeled mutated NF-κB probe failed to form a NF-κB complex (lane 5). VA-stimulated nuclear extracts gave results similar to those of OA. These results indicated that a specific NF-κB complex occurred following OA or VA stimulation. Finally, we investigated the fate of IκB-α after the treatment of cells with OA or VA. Anti-IκB-α Ab detected a 38-kDa band (IκB-α) on Western blots in extracts from unstimulated HL-60 cells (Fig. 10), while no corresponding band was seen with the control antibody (data not shown). Within 10–20 min after OA stimulation, the IκB-α band almost disappeared, indicating degradation of this component. In contrast, the decrease of IκB-α following treatment of VA was slower and not complete as compared with OA-treatment. In addition, we examined whether IκB-α could serve as a substrate of Erk1.

As few attempts have been made to distinguish free 5′ ends of true replicate from those of abortive ones, we examined the 5′ ends of true replicate of human mitochondrial DNA at one nucleotide resolution in vivo by making use of ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction. The distribution and relative amounts of origins of the true replicate are exactly the same as those of total newly synthesized heavy strands, which means that the abortion of replication is independent of 5′ ends. Treatment of DNA with RNase H frees 5′ ends on both heavy and light strands. This is the first in vivo evidence for covalently attached primer RNA to nascent strand in human mitochondrial DNA.

Treatment of DNA with RNase H frees 5′ ends on both heavy and light strands. This is the first in vivo evidence for covalently attached primer RNA to nascent strand in human mitochondrial DNA. Replication of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) begins with synthesis of the heavy strand (H strand) 1The abbreviations used are: H strand, heavy strand; L strand, light strand; LSP, light strand promoter; LMPCR, ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction; CSB, conserved sequence block; D-loop, displacement loop.1The abbreviations used are: H strand, heavy strand; L strand, light strand; LSP, light strand promoter; LMPCR, ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction; CSB, conserved sequence block; D-loop, displacement loop. from the replication origin OH, following transcription of the light strand (L strand). Transcription of the L strand is regulated by the L strand promoter (LSP) sequence. When synthesis of the H strand has proceeded about two-thirds, synthesis of the L strand begins from replication origin OL. Thus, the total replication rate of mtDNA is determined by H strand synthesis (for reviews, see Refs.1Clayton D.A. Cell. 1982; 28: 693-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 2Wallace D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1175-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar, 3Clayton D.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 453-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The multiple replication origins of human mitochondrial H and L strands have been determined as free 5′ ends of mtDNA extracted from prepared mitochondria. The molecular mechanism and physiological significance of these events are poorly understood. A large part of the synthesis of H strand is aborted, leaving a displacement loop ((D-loop) or 7 S DNA). For example, over 95% of the newly synthesized H strand is a D-loop in the case of mouse L cells (4Bogenhagen D. Clayton D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 119: 49-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This makes it difficult to precisely determine origins of the true replication form (nascent H strand) (5Tapper D.P. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5109-5115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Few investigators have distinguished the free 5′ end of the true replicate form from that of the D-loop even though selective detection of the free 5′ end of the true replicate form is critical to determine replication origin. Although the 5′ ends of the nascent H strand are suggested to be the same as those of D-loop in human mitochondria (5Tapper D.P. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5109-5115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is uncertain whether the distribution and relative amount of the 5′ ends of nascent H strand are exactly the same as those of the D-loop. In addition, the free 5′ ends of human mtDNA are not set at one nucleotide resolution (6Chang D.D. Clayton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). To precisely determine the replication origin but not the simple free 5′ end, it is required to selectively detect the replication origin at a higher resolution. We made use of the ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LMPCR) to detect free 5′ ends (7Pfeifer G.P. Steigerwald S.D. Mueller P.R. Wold B. Riggs A.D. Science. 1989; 246: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 8Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar), an approach which makes feasible use of total DNA extracted directly from whole cells. By selective amplification of nascent H (not D-loop), we determined precise and comprehensive replication origins of the H strand in vivo.Here, we describe sites of free 5′ ends and the transition sites of RNA to DNA for both H and L strands at one nucleotide resolution. BamHI, RNase inhibitor, and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Takara (Seta, Japan). RNase A and diethylpyrocarbonate were from Sigma. Proteinase K was from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany). Long Ranger® was from FMC® BioProducts (Rockland, ME). Vent DNA polymerase was from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Other reagents were of analytical grade. HeLa MRV11 and Jurkat (human T cell leukemia line) cells were cultured as described (9Kang D. Nishida J. Iyama A. Nakabeppu Y. Furuichi M. Fujiwara T. Sekiguchi M. Takeshige K. J. Biol.

The cells (about 106 cells) were centrifuged, and the pellets were rapidly denatured and solubilized in 100 μl of denaturing buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K at 50 °C for 1 h. Total DNA was isolated by two extractions with phenol/chloroform (1/1), and then DNA was ethanol precipitated. The pellets were dried, solubilized in 100 μl of distilled water, and treated with RNase A (0.1 μg/μl) and BamHI (0.1 unit/μl). DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform (1/1), ethanol precipitated, and solubilized in water. The amount of the total DNA was determined by measuring A 260. In some cases, the initially extracted DNA was solubilized in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water containing RNase inhibitor (0.7 units/μl) and digested withBamHI alone. After extracting DNA with phenol/chloroform (1/1), precipitating with ethanol, and solubilization in water, DNA was treated with either RNase A (0.1 μg/μl) alone or RNase A plus RNase H (6 units/μl) before LMPCR. Mitochondria of HeLa cells were prepared by differential centrifugation (9Kang D. Nishida J. Iyama A. Nakabeppu Y. Furuichi M. Fujiwara T. Sekiguchi M. Takeshige K. J. Biol.

Briefly, the cells suspended in buffer (TES) containing 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.1 mm EDTA were homogenized with a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer and centrifuged at 600 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 7,000 ×g for 10 min. The pellets were washed three times with TES. The mitochondrial fraction was allowed to proceed in in vitro replication at 37 °C for 1 h, as described by Koikeet al. (10Koike K. Kobayashi M. Biochim. Biophys.

A unidirectional linker was prepared by hybridizing LMPR1 (5′-gcggtgacccgggagatctgtattc-3′) and LMPR2 (5′-gaatacagatc-3′).

Open table in a new tab Primer 1 was extended in 30 μl of the first strand synthesis reaction mixture consisting of 40 mmNaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.9, 5 mmMgSO4, 0.01% gelatin, 0.3 pmol primer 1, 0.2 mm of each dNTP, 0.5 units of Vent DNA polymerase, and DNA (0.2 μg for sequence ladder and 0.4 μg for detection of 5′ ends). DNA was denatured at 95 °C for 5 min, and the primer was annealed at 54–60 °C for 30 min, after which polymerase reaction was performed at 76 °C for 10 min. After cooling on ice, 45 μl of ice-cold ligation mix was added, and the ligation reaction was performed at 16 °C for more than 6 h. The ligation mix consisted of 77 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 13.3 mm MgCl2, 33.3 mm dithiothreitol, 8.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1.7 mm ATP, 100 pmol of unidirectional linker, and 3 Weiss units of T4 DNA ligase. DNA was precipitated with 9.4 μl of ice-cold precipitation mix (2.7 m sodium acetate, pH 7.0, and 1 mg of tRNA) and 220 μl of ice-cold ethanol, and then the entire mixture was kept at −20 °C for 2 h. DNA pellets were solubilized in 66.5 μl of water, and then 33.5 μl of amplification mix (123 mmNaCl, 61.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.9, 15 mmMgSO4, 0.03% gelatin, 0.3% Triton X-100, 10 pmol LMPR1, 20 pmol primer 2, 0.67 mm of each dNTP, and 1 unit of Vent DNA polymerase) was added to the DNA solution. DNA was denatured initially at 95 °C for 3 min, and then the reaction underwent 20 PCR cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 60–65 °C for 2 min, and 76 °C for 3 min plus an extra 5 s for each cycle. Final extension was allowed to proceed at 76 °C for 10 min. Usually, the 5′ end of primer 2 was fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled, and this step was followed by the DNA extraction and analysis as described below. To distinguish the nascent H strand from the total newly synthesized H strand, a three-primers system was adopted. H1 and H2 were used as primers 1 and 2, respectively, for the nascent H strand. For the total newly synthesized H strand, D1 and D2 were used as primers 1 and 2, respectively. Fifty μl of end-labeling mix (40 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.9, 5 mm MgSO4, 0.01% gelatin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 pmol LMPR1, 20 pmol FD6 as primer 3, 0.2 mm of each dNTP, and 0.5 units of Vent DNA polymerase) was added to a 50-μl aliquot of each PCR mixture after amplification for end labeling. After initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, 2 cycles of reaction were run at 95 °C for 1 min, at 65 °C for 2 min, and at 76 °C for 3 min, followed by a final extension of 76 °C for 5 min. DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform (1/1), ethanol precipitated, dried, and finally solubilized in 10 μl of loading buffer (80% formamide, 45 mm Tris base, 45 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA). After heat denaturation, 3 μl of sample was electrophoresed through a 5% Long Ranger® 7 m urea gel. The products were scanned with FluorImager SI (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and quantified with ImageQuantTM (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) software. The D-loop region was amplified by using primers D6 and RL665D9 (5′-gctaggaccaaacctatttg-3′). The PCR product was resolved on a 1% agarose gel and then extracted. The sequence was determined on a 5% Long Ranger® 7 murea gel using an ABI PRISMTM 377 DNA sequencer by the dye terminator cycle sequencing (Perkin Elmer) method. Primer L77 (5′-acgcgatagcattgcgagac-3′) was used for the L strand or RL665D9 for the H strand. Free 5′ ends of the H strand were determined at one nucleotide resolution. A signal at a particular site indicates that a free 5′ end is located at the 3′ side of the signal by one base (e.g. a signal at nucleotide 192 indicates that nucleotide 191 is a 5′ end on the H strand). The free 5′ ends were clustered from nucleotides 100 to 200 (Fig.1). Although the signal at nucleotide 152 was weaker in Jurkat cells than in HeLa cells, distribution of the signals was essentially the same between the two cell lines (Fig. 1). The sequence at nucleotide 150 on the H strand is G in HeLa MRV11 cells and A in Jurkat cells. This difference might affect usage frequency of a replication origin at nucleotide 151. The major signals were grouped into 4 regions around nucleotides 110, 150, 170, and 190. The locations were essentially the same as those reported by Chang and Clayton (6Chang D.D. Clayton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). These same authors (6Chang D.D. Clayton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) have reported two bands of 5′ ends (around nucleotides 220 and 310) that almost correspond to the 3′ ends of possible primer RNAs and another relative strong band at nucleotide 440. We did not detect the three bands by using primer sets D-7 and D-8 (results not shown). As a large part of the synthesis of H strand is aborted as D-loop, there is the possibility that the 5′ ends described above do not reflect origins of the true replicate (nascent H strand). The 3′ termini of the human D-loop have been mapped to nucleotides 16104–16106 (14Doda J.N. Wright C.T. Clayton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6116-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). This indicates that the newly synthesized H strand exceeding this region is the nascent H strand. Hence, we amplified the nascent H strand using primers set outside of the D-loop. We designed the other primers on the inside of the D-loop to amplify the total newly synthesized H strand (i.e. D-loop and nascent H strand). Intensity of the signals for the nascent H strand was about 40% of that for the total newly synthesized H strand (results not shown). When the conditions were selected to match the apparent signal intensity between the nascent H strand and total newly synthesized H strand, the distribution and relative amounts of signals for the nascent H strand were much the same as those of the total newly synthesized H strand (Fig.2). It is considered that replication of the H strand is initiated by cleavage of the L strand transcript by RNase H-like activity. In human cells, RNA covalently attached to the newly synthesized H strand is not detectable in vivo (5Tapper D.P. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5109-5115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wong T.W. Clayton D.A. Cell. 1985; 42: 951-958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) although such RNA is noted in mouse cells (16Chang D.D. Hauswirth W.W. Clayton D.A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1559-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We did not detect the 5′ ends at areas where the 3′ ends of free RNA are mapped (6Chang D.D. Clayton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Considering the possibility that RNA is not cleaved at the sitesin vivo, we treated DNA with RNase H and then performed LMPCR. This treatment led to new free 5′ ends at nucleotides 297 and 302–309 (Fig. 3, A and B) but not around nucleotide 220, corresponding to conserved sequence block (CSB) I (Fig. 3 A). The appearance of new 5′ ends after treatment with RNase H indicates the covalent attachment of RNA to DNA. This is apparently the first demonstration of the covalent attachment of RNA to a newly synthesized H strand in human cells. The free 5′ ends on the L strand were also detected at nucleotides 5772, 5775, 5776, 5778, 5779, 5780, and 5762 by LMPCR (Fig.3 C). Although covalent attachment of RNA to the L strand is noted in an in vitro system (15Wong T.W. Clayton D.A. Cell. 1985; 42: 951-958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), such has not been demonstrated in vivo. We obtained new free 5′ ends at nucleotide 5770 and to a lesser extent at 5768, 5769, and 5774 after treatment with RNase H (Fig. 3 C). These new 5′ ends are located at the base of the stem portion in the proposed stem-loop structure near OL (15Wong T.W. Clayton D.A. Cell. 1985; 42: 951-958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This is the first example of the existence of covalently attached RNA to a human nascent L strandin vivo. Chang and Clayton (6Chang D.D. Clayton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) have detected free 5′ ends in the area of nucleotide 310, without using RNase H, whereas we detected 5′ ends only after RNase H treatment. Because they extracted DNA from mitochondria, it may be that their free 5′ ends around nucleotide 310 are the result of activation of an endogenous RNase H-like processing enzyme during mitochondria preparations. We carried out LMPCR using DNA extracted from mitochondria and detected free 5′ ends around nucleotide 310 without using RNase H treatment (Fig. 4), suggesting that the primer RNA attached to DNA can be processed at these sites by an endogenous RNase H-like activity. We selectively detected free 5′ ends of the true nascent H strand by LMPCR. We found no difference in the distribution and relative amounts of 5′ ends between the nascent H strand and the total newly synthesized H strand. The same distribution pattern of 5′ ends of nascent H strand as that of D-loop suggests that the abortion of replication is not affected by the origin. A transcript must form a persistent RNA-DNA hybrid to prime replication. We observed new free 5′ ends only near the CSB II region after RNase H treatment of DNA (Fig. 3). This suggests that the primer RNAs extend to CSB II and covalently attach to the nascent H strand. Chang and Clayton (6Chang D.D. Clayton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) have reported that the 3′ termini of free RNA are mapped to three CSB regions (CSBs I-III). Our observations suggest that the RNA-DNA hybrid at CSB II is more stable than those at the other CSBs in vivo. Consistent with this, a persistent RNA-DNA hybrid is reported to be formed under an in vitro system containing the GC-rich CSB II region downstream of a promoter (17Xu B. Clayton D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 580-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 18Xu B. Clayton D.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3135-3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although we noted a small amount of covalently attached RNA to nascent H strand near the CSB II region, almost all free 5′ ends were confined downstream of the CSB I or the region between nucleotides 100 and 200. These 5′ ends were free of RNA. Because the 5′ ends in the region of nucleotides 100 to 200 should have been primed with RNA, the RNA-DNA hybrid should extend to nucleotides 100–200 from the LSP region (around nucleotide 400) and be processed at the region. A large part of free RNA should have free 3′ ends at nucleotides 100 to 200, while most of 3′ ends of free RNA are clustered in three CSBs (6Chang D.D. Clayton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The reason for the discrepancy remains to be explained. We extensively determined the 5′ ends of the true replicate of H strand by LMPCR (Fig. 5). This approach is sensitive, rapid, facilitated, and precise. Detection of a free 5′ end equals to detection of the strand with a free 5′ end (i.e. nascent strand), therefore, the signal intensity reflects the amount of nascent strand. Hence, it is possible to estimate the steady-state level of replication in cells using LMPCR (19Miyako, K., Kai, K., Irie, T., Takeshige, K., and Kang, D. (1997)J. Biol. Chem., 9605–9608.Google Scholar). We extend special thanks to Drs. H. Sumimoto and Y. Nakabeppu, Prof. N. Hamasaki (Kyushu University), and Prof. S.

https://openalex.org/W2005013263,"Two nervous tissue-specific chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, neurocan and phosphacan (the extracellular domain of protein-tyrosine phosphatase-ζ/β), are high-affinity ligands of tenascin-C. Using portions of tenascin-C expressed as recombinant proteins in human fibrosarcoma cells, we have demonstrated both by direct radioligand binding assays and inhibition studies that phosphacan binding is retained in all deletion variants except those lacking the fibrinogen-like globe and that phosphacan binds to this single domain with nearly the same affinity (<i>K</i> <sub>d</sub> ∼12 nm) as to native or recombinant tenascin-C. However, maximum binding of neurocan requires both the fibrinogen globe and some of the adjacent fibronectin type III repeats. Binding of phosphacan and neurocan to intact tenascin-C, and of phosphacan to the fibrinogen globe, is significantly increased in the presence of calcium. Chondroitinase treatment of the proteoglycans did not affect their binding to either native tenascin-C or to any of the recombinant proteins, demonstrating that these interactions are mediated by the proteoglycan core proteins rather than through the glycosaminoglycan chains. These results are also consistent with rotary shadowing electron micrographs that show phosphacan as a rod terminated at one end by a globular domain that is frequently seen apposed to the fibrinogen globe in mixtures of phosphacan and tenascin-C. C6 glioma cells adhere to and spread on deletion variants of tenascin-C containing only the epidermal growth factor-like domains or the fibronectin type III repeats and the fibrinogen globe. In both cases cell adhesion was inhibited by similar concentrations of phosphacan, demonstrating that the fibrinogen globe is not necessary for this effect, which is apparently mediated by a direct action of phosphacan on the cells rather than by its interaction with the proteoglycan binding site on tenascin-C."
https://openalex.org/W2070641117,"Avian cells express three HSF genes encoding a unique factor, HSF3, as well as homologues of mammalian HSF1 and HSF2. HSF1 is the major factor that mediates the heat shock signal in mammalian cells. We reported previously that cHSF3, as well as cHSF1, is activated by heat shock in chicken cells. In this study, we examined the functional differences between cHSF1 and cHSF3. Comparison of the heat-inducible DNA binding activity of cHSF1 with cHSF3 at various temperatures revealed that the latter was activated at higher temperatures than the former. At a mild heat shock, such as 41 °C, only cHSF1 was activated, whereas both cHSF1 and cHSF3 were activated following a severe heat shock at 45 °C. Heat-inducible nuclear translocation and trimerization were accompanied by DNA binding activity. We also observed that cHSF3 was activated by treating cells with higher concentrations of sodium arsenite compared to cHSF1. The DNA binding activity of cHSF3 by severe heat shock lasted for a longer period than that of cHSF1. Interestingly, the total amount of cHSF3 increased only upon severe heat shock, whereas that of HSF1 decreased. Substantial amounts of cHSF3 remained in the soluble fraction under severe heat shock, whereas cHSF1 rapidly moved to the insoluble fractions in that conditions. Comparison of transcriptional activity of the activation domains of cHSF1 and cHSF3 revealed that the activity of cHSF3 was as strong as that of cHSF1. These findings indicate that there are different thresholds for cHSF1 and cHSF3 and that cHSF3 is involved in the persistent and burst activation of stress genes upon severe stress in chicken cells. Pretreatment of cycloheximide elevated the threshold concentrations of arsenite of both factors. This suggests that denaturation of nascent polypeptides could be the first trigger for the activation of both factors, and the pathways for activation of cHSF1 and cHSF3 may be identical, or at least share some common mechanisms.

When cells are exposed to elevated temperature and to certain chemical and physiological stresses, the synthesis of a set of proteins called heat shock proteins (HSPs) 1The abbreviations used are: HSP, heat shock protein; HSE, heat shock element; HSF, heat shock factor; CEF, chicken embryo fibroblast(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.1The abbreviations used are: HSP, heat shock protein; HSE, heat shock element; HSF, heat shock factor; CEF, chicken embryo fibroblast(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. or stress proteins is rapidly induced. These polypeptides are well conserved between bacteria and mammals and function as molecular chaperones to prevent and repair the protein damage caused by various stresses (1Craig E.A. Weissman J.S.

Heat shock factor (HSF) is a sequence-specific DNA binding protein that binds tightly to multiple copies of a highly conserved sequence motif (nGAAn) in the promoter regions of heat shock genes, termed the heat shock element (HSE). Heat-inducible activation of pre-existing HSF causes a rapid and transient increase of heat shock gene transcription (5Lis J. Wu C.

In the budding yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae andKluyveromyces lactis, HSF constitutively binds to HSE as a trimer and stimulates transcription upon heat shock (7Giardina C. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell.

In contrast, HSF2 is activated in human K562 cells during hemin-induced erythroid differentiation (25Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1992; 12: 4104-4111Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). During this differentiation, the amount of HSF2 increased post-transcriptionally. This signaling pathway, which leads to the activation of HSF1 or HSF2, is not yet clear, although it is speculated that HSP70 is a sensor for heat stress (27Craig E.A. Gross C.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 135-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 28Morimoto R.I. Science. 1993; 259: 1409-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). cHSF3 was originally cloned from a chicken erythrocyte cDNA library (18Nakai A. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1983-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). We reported recently that both cHSF1 and cHSF3 are activated by heat shock and sodium arsenite in chicken cells (29Nakai A. Kawazoe Y. Tanabe M. Nagata K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5268-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Activation of cHSF3 after heat shock is accompanied by nuclear translocation, acquisition of DNA binding activity, and conversion from an inert dimeric form to a DNA-binding trimeric form. The kinetics of stress-induced DNA binding and nuclear translocation of cHSF1 and cHSF3 are different. cHSF1 responds to stress rapidly, whereas cHSF3 is converted to a trimer and moves to the nucleus slowly. However, the functional differences between cHSF1 and cHSF3 are still unclear. Here we report that the threshold temperatures required to activate cHSF1 and cHSF3 are different. cHSF3 was activated by heat shock at a higher temperature than was cHSF1. Upon severe heat shock, the total amount of cHSF3 increased whereas that of cHSF1 decreased. Whereas cHSF1 rapidly moved to insoluble fraction, much of cHSF3 remained in the soluble fraction. The ability of cHSF3 to activate transcription was as strong as that of cHSF1. These results suggest that cHSF3 has a role in persistent and burst activation of stress genes under conditions of severe stress in chicken cells. Chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 2% chicken serum, and 2% tryptose phosphate broth. The avian leukosis virus-induced chicken B cell line DT40 (30Buerstedde J.M. Reynaud C.A. Humphries E.H. Olson W. Ewert D.L. Weill J.C.

Takeda (Kyoto University) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1% chicken serum, 0.01 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Cells were incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. To prepare whole cell extracts, cells were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and suspended in buffer C containing 20 mm HEPES (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N′-2-ethanesulfonic acid, pH 7.9), 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A. The lysates were kept on ice for 5 min and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. The pellet fractions were suspend in Laemmli's sample buffer and sonicated. Subcellular fractionation was performed as described previously (31Dignam J.D. Levobitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA). The antibody supershift experiments were performed by incubating 2.0 μl of 1:10 diluted antiserum in PBS with 1–2 μl of cell lysates in a total volume of 10 μl. After incubation on ice for 20 min, a nucleotide probe mixture containing 0.1 ng of 32P-labeled self-complementary ideal HSE oligonucleotides (20Sarge K.D. Zimarino V. Holm K. Wu C. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1902-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) and 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, NJ) in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) and 1 mm EDTA was added to a final volume of 25 μl. The binding reactions were incubated on ice for 20 min, mixed with 2 μl of a dye solution (0.2% bromphenol blue, 0.2% xylene cyanol, and 50% glycerol) and then separated on 4% native polyacrylamide gels. Gels were run in 0.5 × TBE buffer at room temperature for 1.7 h at 140 V, dried, and exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C with intensifying screens. Whole cell extracts (200 μl containing 300–500 μg of protein) were applied to a Superdex 200HR column attached to a fast protein liquid chromatography apparatus (Pharmacia). The samples were eluted at 0.3 ml/min with a buffer containing 1% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 200 mm KCl, and 1.5 mm MgCl2. Each fraction (0.5 ml) was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (final concentration, 10%), washed with acetone, dried, suspended in gel sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. The peak positions of HSFs were determined as described previously (29Nakai A. Kawazoe Y. Tanabe M. Nagata K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5268-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). CEF were cultured on glass coverslips for 16 h, fixed with 50% ethanol-50% acetone at −20 °C for 20 min, and washed with PBS. After blocking with 10% normal goat serum in PBS, cells were incubated with 1:200-diluted αHSF1 and αHSF3 serum in 2% normal goat serum in PBS and then with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G antibody (1:200 dilution) (Cappel). The coverslips were washed and mounted in 80% glycerol in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) on a coverglass. Immunostained cells were observed by fluorescence microscopy (Nicon, Tokyo, Japan). Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. The filters were blocked with 5% dry milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with a 1:500 dilution of rabbit antiserum against each HSF in PBS with 2% dry milk. After washing with PBS, the filters were incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Cappel) for 30 min at room temperature and washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS. Signals were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Corp.). Total RNA was isolated by the acid guanidium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (32Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63149) Google Scholar). 10 μg of RNA was fractionated on 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and capillary transferred onto GeneScreen Plus membrane (DuPont NEN). The filter was baked at 80 °C for 2 h and hybridized in a solution containing 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 6% PPBF (2% polyvinyl pyrrolidone, 2% bovine serum albumin, 2% ficoll 400), 1% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 42 °C for 6 h. The filters were then incubated with radiolabeled chicken HSP70 cDNA (0.5 kbHindIII-SmaI fragment of pC1.8, a gift from Dr. R. I. Morimoto, Northwestern University) (33Morimoto R.I. Hunt C.

Co-transfection and luciferase assay were performed described previously (17Nakai A. Tanabe M. Kawazoe Y. Inazawa J. Morimoto R.I. Nagata K. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1995; 15: 5268-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We previously reported that the DNA binding activities of both cHSF1 and cHSF3 were induced by incubating chicken HD6 erythroblastic cells at 45 °C and that the induction of cHSF3 DNA binding activity was delayed compared with that of cHSF1 (29Nakai A. Kawazoe Y. Tanabe M. Nagata K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5268-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). CEF cultured at 37 °C were heat shocked for up to 120 min at a series of temperatures from 39 to 46 °C, and then whole cell extracts were prepared for gel shift assay. Very weak but distinct heat-inducible HSE binding activity was observed when cells were incubated at 39 °C, and this heat-inducible DNA binding activity became clearer with the elevation of the heat shock temperature (Fig.1, left). Supershift experiments using specific antisera against cHSF1 or cHSF3, which recognized the carboxyl regions of the respective HSF, showed that only anti-cHSF1 serum supershifted the DNA binding activity at mild heat shock temperatures, such as 39, 40, and 41 °C, whereas anti-cHSF3 did not at these temperatures (Fig. 1, A–C). At higher temperatures, such as 44, 45, and 46 °C, anti-cHSF3 clearly supershifted a part of the DNA binding activity (Fig. 1, F-H, arrows). The DNA binding activity of cHSF1, which was not supershifted by the addition of anti-cHSF3 serum, gradually decreased at 44 °C and rapidly disappeared at 46 °C. These results suggest that the DNA binding activity of cHSF1 and cHSF3 were both induced in CEF by heat shock, but the threshold temperatures for their activation are different. DNA binding activity of cHSF3 is induced by treatment of cells at higher temperatures compared with cHSF1. We next examined the heat shock-induced changes in the oligomeric form of each HSF. Whole cell extracts from control and heat-shocked cells were fractionated on a Superdex 200HR column, and the fractions containing cHSF1 and cHSF3 were analyzed by immunoblot analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 2). The inert monomeric form of HSF1 is reported to be converted to a DNA-binding trimeric form after heat shock (15Westwood J.T. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3481-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 29Nakai A. Kawazoe Y. Tanabe M. Nagata K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5268-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the control CEFs, cHSF1 was eluted as a major peak of 160 kDa and a minor peak of 360 kDa (Fig. 2 A). After cells were incubated at 45 °C for 30 min, all of the cHSF1 was eluted at a peak of approximately 600 kDa (Fig. 2 C). Even when cells were mildly heat shocked at 41 °C for 30 min, most of the monomeric cHSF1 was converted to the trimeric form (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, the dimeric form of cHSF3, which was eluted at a major peak of 390 kDa, was not converted to the trimer after a mild heat shock at 41 °C for 30 min (Fig. 2, D and E). Most of the cHSF3 was converted to the trimeric form when cells were exposed to severe heat shock at 45 °C for 30 min (Fig. 2 F). These observations were consistent with the DNA binding activities of cHSF1 and cHSF3, shown in Fig. 1 after treatment of the cells at various temperatures. The heat shock response is also induced by chemical stresses. Previously, we reported that both cHSF1 and cHSF3 are activated when cells are exposed to sodium arsenite (29Nakai A. Kawazoe Y. Tanabe M. Nagata K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5268-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To examine whether there are different thresholds for activation of cHSF1 and cHSF3 by chemical stress, whole cell extracts from CEF exposed to various concentrations of sodium arsenite were prepared and HSE binding activity was examined by gel shift assay (Fig. 3). When cells were treated with a low concentration of sodium arsenite (3 μm), HSE binding activity was induced and increased up to 3 h (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1–6). Supershift experiments showed that the induced activity was due solely to cHSF1 (lanes 7–12); no activity of cHSF3 was induced (lanes 13–18). When cells were treated with a high concentration of sodium arsenite (50 μm), a burst of HSE binding activity was induced even at 30 min (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–7). Supershift experiments using specific antisera revealed that these HSE binding activities were composed of both cHSF1 and cHSF3 (Fig. 3 B, lanes 8–18). These results indicate that a high concentration of sodium arsenite is needed for activation of cHSF3. Again, the DNA binding activity of cHSF1, which was not supershifted with anti-cHSF3 serum, clearly decreased (Fig. 3 B, lanes 14–18).Figure 1DNA binding activities of cHSF1 and cHSF3 induced at various temperatures. CEF were heat shocked at 39–46 °C for the indicated times, and whole cell extracts were prepared.

Voellmy R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In contrast, cells exposed to severe stress showed induction of stress proteins even when they were pretreated with cycloheximide (37Beckmann R.P. Lovett M. Welch W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1137-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been considered that the first cellular target of mild stress might be newly synthesized polypeptides. We examined the effect of a protein synthesis inhibitor upon activation of cHSF1 and cHSF3. CEF were exposed to various concentrations of sodium arsenite in the presence or absence of cycloheximide, and the whole cell extracts were subjected to gel shift assay (Fig.3 C). In the absence of cycloheximide, treatment with sodium arsenite for 2 h induced HSE binding activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 C, upper panel, lanes 1–5). Supershift experiments showed that cHSF1 was activated at 3 μm sodium arsenite, whereas cHSF3 was not (lanes 7 and 12). Activation of cHSF3 was detected at concentrations of 50 μm or higher (Fig. 3 C, lanes 13–15), which is consistent with the results shown in Fig.3 B. However, when cells were pretreated with cycloheximide for 1 h, the relative induction of HSE binding activity was significantly reduced at concentrations of 3–100 μm of arsenite (Fig. 3 C, compare upper and lower panels, lanes 2–5). In the presence of cycloheximide, cHSF1 and cHSF3 activation were observed at arsenite concentrations as low as 50 μm and 100 μm respectively (Fig. 3 C, lower panel, lanes 8 and 14). These concentrations were higher than those in cells exposed to arsenite without cycloheximide treatment. We further analyzed the oligomeric state of cHSF3. After treatment of the cells with 50 μm sodium arsenite, cHSF3 was mainly eluted corresponding to the position of trimeric form. In contrast, no trimeric form of cHSF3 was detected following treatment with sodium arsenite at a concentration of 50 μm in the presence of cycloheximide (data not shown). These results indicate that activation of cHSF3, as well as that of cHSF1, was affected by cycloheximide treatment, suggesting that the first trigger for activation of these factors might be the denaturation of nascent polypeptides. We further studied the subcellular localizations of cHSF1 and cHSF3, both before and after mild and severe heat shock, by biochemical fractionation followed by Western blot analysis (Fig.4 A). Most cHSF1 and cHSF3 existed in the cytoplasmic fraction in control cells (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1 and11), and all of both molecules was translocated to the nuclear fraction after cells were incubated at 45 °C for 60 min (Fig. 4 A, lanes 8 and 18). When cells were stressed with a mild heat shock at 41 °C, about one-half of the cHSF1 was observed in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 4 A, lanes 3–6), whereas none of the cHSF3 moved to the nuclear fraction even after heat treatment for 60 min (Fig. 4 A, lanes 13–16). The decrease in the amount of cHSF1 after heat shock at 45 °C for 2 h was due to its insolubilization (Fig. 4 A, lane 10; see Fig. 7). The difference in subcellular localization between cHSF1 and cHSF3 was also examined by indirect immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 4 B). cHSF1 staining was observed mainly in the cytoplasm, and very weak staining was observed in the nucleus in control cells (Fig. 4 B, a). Upon heat shock at 41 °C, the intensity of nuclear staining increased and cHSF1 was detected mainly in the nucleus at 45 °C (Fig. 4 B, b and c). In contrast to cHSF1 staining, diffuse cytoplasmic staining of cHSF3 was observed in cells heat shocked at 41 °C as well as in control cells (Fig. 4 B, d ande). Severe heat shock at 45 °C caused a punctate nuclear staining of cHSF3 (Fig. 4 B, f). The results obtained by indirect immunofluorescence analysis are consistent with those obtained by biochemical cell fractionation.Figure 7The levels of soluble and insoluble cHSF1 and cHSF3 at various temperatures. A, DT40 cells maintained at 37 °C were heat shocked at the indicated temperatures for 1 h. Whole cell extracts (soluble fractions) were prepared by a standard procedure. Pellet fractions were suspended in Laemmli's sample buffer by sonication (insoluble). Aliquots extracted from an equal number of cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described in the legend to Fig. 2. B, DT40 cells were heat shocked at 41 or 45 °C for the indicated times. The protein levels of cHSF1 and cHSF3 in soluble and insoluble fractions were analyzed as described above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Taken together, these results strongly suggest that there are different threshold temperatures for activation of each HSF; a higher temperature was needed for cHSF3 to acquire DNA binding activity, to form a trimer, and to move to the nucleus than for cHSF1. The results described above led us to an idea that cHSF3 may be involved in the induction of stress proteins in response to severe heat shock. To determine whether there are any differences in the responses to mild and severe heat shock, we performed Northern analysis using cDNA probes for various heat shock genes. In both CEF and chicken B lymphocyte DT40 cells, induction of HSP70 and HSP90 mRNA was observed following heat shock even at 41 °C (Fig.5, lanes 2, 3, 7, and 8). The levels of HSP70 mRNA were markedly increased when cells were continuously exposed to a temperature of 45 °C (Fig. 5, lanes 4, 5, 9, and 10), whereas the HSP90 mRNA level after 45 °C heat shock was similar to that observed at 41 °C (Fig. 5, HSP90α). The expression of HSP90 may be differentially regulated post-transcriptionally (39Jacqui"

There is a significant similarity with AO from mammals and xanthine dehydrogenases from various sources. The maize AO polypeptide contains consensus sequences for iron-sulfur centers and a putative molybdopterin cofactor-binding domain. In addition, another cDNA (zmAO-2), highly homologous to zmAO-1 at both the nucleotide and amino acid sequence levels, was cloned. zmAO-2 would encode a protein of 1349 amino acid residues of M r 145,173 and has molecular characteristics similar to those of zmAO-1. zmAO-1 was expressed at a high level in roots, which was closely correlated with immunoblotting results using antiserum raised against the purified maize AO protein, whereas zmAO-2 was expressed at a higher level in coleoptiles than in roots.

They catalyze the oxidation of a variety of aldehydes and N2-containing heterocyclic compounds in the presence of O2 or certain redox dyes (1Rajagopalan K.V. Handler P.

AOs belong to the family of molybdenum-containing protein like xanthine oxidoreductase (xanthine:NAD+oxidoreductase; EC 1.1.1.204; XD) and sulfite oxidase (4Hille R. Massey V. Spiro T.G. Molybdenum Enzymes. Wiley Interscience, New York1985: 443-518Google Scholar), and they possess a short oxidoreductive chain characterized by four oxidation centers, such as two iron-sulfur clusters, a flavin cofactor, and a molybdopterin cofactor (5Barber M.J. Coughlan M.P. Rajagopalan K.V. Siegel L.M. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3561-3568Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). AOs are known to be a homodimer, consisting of two 148-kDa subunits (see Ref. 6Yoshihara S. Tatsumi K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 242: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar and references therein).Recently, an AO was purified from bovine liver and the corresponding cDNA was cloned (7Li Calzi M. Raviolo C. Ghibaudi E. De Gioia L. Salmona M. Cazzaniga G. Kurosaki M. Terao M. Garattini E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31037-31045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Consensus sequences for iron-sulfur centers and a molybdopterin-binding site in the deduced polypeptide were identified. The deduced amino acid sequence shows significant similarity with that of XD from various sources. Bovine AO is expressed at high levels in the liver and lung and has been implicated in the detoxification of certain types of environmental pollutants and xenobiotic. The animal AO may also play a role in retinoic acid synthesis (7Li Calzi M. Raviolo C. Ghibaudi E. De Gioia L. Salmona M. Cazzaniga G. Kurosaki M. Terao M. Garattini E. J. Biol.

In addition, a human liver cDNA that had been thought to encode XD is now thought to encode an AO (10Wright R.M. Vaitaitis G.M. Wilson C.M. Repine T.B. Terada L.S. Repine J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10690-10694Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).In plants, only a limited amount of information has been published concerning AO, being focused on its possible involvement in plant hormone biosynthesis, such as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) (11Rajagopal R.

Plant Physiol. 1989; 90: 728-733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Leydecker M.-T. Moureaux T. Kraepiel Y. Schnorr K. Caboche M. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The last step in their biosynthetic pathways has been thought to be the oxidation of corresponding aldehyde: indole-3-acetaldehyde (IAAld) for IAA and abscisic aldehyde (ABAld) for ABA. However, there have been almost no detailed analyses of the molecular properties of plant AO, and no sequence data of either protein or DNA have been reported. Therefore, the actual function of the plant AO(s) is still obscure. In a previous paper, we described the purification of an AO that could oxidize IAAld to IAA from coleoptiles of maize (Zea mays L.) seedlings (17Koshiba T. Saito E. Ono N. Yamamoto N. Sato M. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The maize AO has an apparent molecular mass of about 300 kDa as estimated by gel filtration and was composed of two 150-kDa subunits. It contains flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), iron, and molybdenum as prosthetic groups. This was the first report showing the presence of these cofactors in a plant AO.In the present paper, we describe the sequencing of peptides obtained by proteolytic cleavage of the purified maize AO and the molecular cloning of the respective cDNA. In addition, another cDNA showing significant similarity with cDNA of the AO was cloned. The structures of both deduced polypeptides were analyzed and compared with mammalian AOs and various XDs. These cDNA probes and a monospecific antiserum raised against the purified enzyme were used to study the tissue distribution of maize AO mRNA and protein.DISCUSSIONWe cloned two cDNAs for plant AO. The molecular mass values of predicted proteins for these cDNAs are coincident with that of the purified protein, and one of them (zmAO-1) contains the sequence of four peptides obtained by API cleavage of the purified AO protein. The pattern of tissue-specific expression of zmAO-1 (Fig. 6) is similar to that of the protein as determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 5). In addition, maize AO activity was immunoprecipitated with a combination of the antiserum raised against purified AO and protein A-Sepharose (17Koshiba T. Saito E. Ono N. Yamamoto N. Sato M. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We conclude that zmAO-1 encodes maize AO that had been purified previously. In the case of human AO, the predicted amino acid sequence shows a relatively lower level of homology to their XD (49.3%) than to bovine AO (85.7%). Since the deduced amino acid sequence for the other cDNA (zmAO-2) shows high similarity to zmAO-1 (83.6%), we considered that both encode maize AOs that may have related functions.As shown in Fig. 3, predicted proteins for zmAOs have a significant level of similarity to those animal AOs and XDs and can be aligned along the whole length of the proteins. zmAOs exhibit unusual clustering of cysteines in the amino-terminal 200 amino acid residues. Nine of these 12 cysteines are conserved in both animal and plant AOs, and eight of them are conserved in both AOs and XDs. Many of them must contribute to the structure of the two Fe-S centers. Li Calzi et al. (7Li Calzi M. Raviolo C. Ghibaudi E. De Gioia L. Salmona M. Cazzaniga G. Kurosaki M. Terao M. Garattini E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31037-31045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) suggested that one (or both) of the two cysteines, amino acids 149 and 151 for bovine AO located in a strictly conserved stretch of amino acids, were involved in iron ligation in AO and XDs. These cysteines and the conserved region are found in both zmAOs (amino acids 165–176 for zmAO-1), supporting this possibility. In addition, zmAOs also contain sequences that conform to the consensus for the molybdopterin cofactor binding site (amino acids 760–853 for zmAO-1). These results are helpful for confirmation of the previous report concerning the biochemical characters of purified maize AO (17Koshiba T. Saito E. Ono N. Yamamoto N. Sato M. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, there are some additional regions conserved to some extent among plant AOs, mammalian AOs, and XDs (amino acids 597–608, 814–822, 1053–1064, and 1173–1230 for zmAO-1). Thus, plant AOs are similar to related enzymes from phylogenically different organisms, indicating they evolved from a common ancestral gene. The most primitive animal species in which AO activity has been found is the coelenterate Segartia luciae (29Krenitsky T.A. Tuttle J.V. Cattau E.L. Wang P. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1974; 49B: 687-703Google Scholar).Two consensus sequences for NAD binding are found in both zmAOs; however, AO does not require the cofactor for its catalytic activity and in fact purified maize AO is devoid of dehydrogenase activity. It is thus unlikely that these structural elements have functional significance. This is also the case for bovine AO (7Li Calzi M. Raviolo C. Ghibaudi E. De Gioia L. Salmona M. Cazzaniga G. Kurosaki M. Terao M. Garattini E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31037-31045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).Glatigny and Scazzocchio (25Glatigny A. Scazzocchio C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3534-3550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) suggested that the ERXXXH motif (amino acid residues 910–915 of A. nidulans XD) is involved in determining substrate specificity. These regions are not conserved in animal AO proteins and plant AOs. In addition, no significant similarities are observed in those corresponding regions among animal AO proteins and zmAO-1 and zmAO-2 proteins. This may reflect the different substrate specificities of plant and animal AOs, since the former have affinity for aromatic aldehydes while the latter do not. To analyze the substrate specificity of the two zmAOs, we tried to produce recombinant proteins, but they were almost completely degraded when the cDNA were expressed in Escherichia coli. This problem also occurs with another molybdopterin cofactor-containing protein, nitrate reductase. 2M. Caboche, personal communication. Further research will be required for elucidation of the different substrate specificities of the zmAOs.In plants, AOs are thought to be involved in plant hormone biosynthesis. Molybdopterin cofactor-deficient mutants of barley and tobacco are deficient in AO and XD activities and have impaired ABA production (15Walker-Simmons M. Kudrna D.A. Warner R.L. Plant Physiol. 1989; 90: 728-733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Leydecker M.-T. Moureaux T. Kraepiel Y. Schnorr K. Caboche M. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This indicates that ABAld oxidase is a molybdenum-containing enzyme which is indispensable for ABA biosynthesis. The ABAld oxidase oxidizes ABAld to ABA, but such an enzyme has not been purified. In the case of IAA biosynthesis, the pathway has been extensively investigated (18Koshiba T. Kamiya Y. Iino M.

IAAld oxidase could catalyze the final step in the pathway where IAA is produced from tryptophan (11Rajagopal R. Physiol. Plant. 1971; 24: 272-281Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 14Koshiba T.

Recently, a surmutant that forms an abnormal number of roots has been isolated fromArabidopsis thaliana (33Boerjan W. Cervera M. Delarue M. Beeckman T. Dewitte W. Bellini C. Caboche M. Van Onckelen H. Van Montagu M. Inzé D. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1405-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). It was thought that the phenotype was caused by overproduction of IAA, and, in fact, IAA levels are much higher in seedlings of the mutant. We have checked AO activity in the wild-type and mutant seedlings after native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, revealing that at least three AO activity bands. One band, showing a substrate preference for indole-3-aldehyde, is much more intense in the mutant seedlings. Three independent cDNA clones have also been isolated from A. thaliana using degenerate primers, and one of these is highly expressed in the surmutant. 3M. Seo, H. Sekimoto, Y. Kamiya, M. Delarue, C.

In the present paper, we describe the sequencing of peptides obtained by proteolytic cleavage of the purified maize AO and the molecular cloning of the respective cDNA. In addition, another cDNA showing significant similarity with cDNA of the AO was cloned. The structures of both deduced polypeptides were analyzed and compared with mammalian AOs and various XDs. These cDNA probes and a monospecific antiserum raised against the purified enzyme were used to study the tissue distribution of maize AO mRNA and protein. DISCUSSIONWe cloned two cDNAs for plant AO. The molecular mass values of predicted proteins for these cDNAs are coincident with that of the purified protein, and one of them (zmAO-1) contains the sequence of four peptides obtained by API cleavage of the purified AO protein. The pattern of tissue-specific expression of zmAO-1 (Fig. 6) is similar to that of the protein as determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 5). In addition, maize AO activity was immunoprecipitated with a combination of the antiserum raised against purified AO and protein A-Sepharose (17Koshiba T. Saito E. Ono N. Yamamoto N. Sato M. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We conclude that zmAO-1 encodes maize AO that had been purified previously. In the case of human AO, the predicted amino acid sequence shows a relatively lower level of homology to their XD (49.3%) than to bovine AO (85.7%). Since the deduced amino acid sequence for the other cDNA (zmAO-2) shows high similarity to zmAO-1 (83.6%), we considered that both encode maize AOs that may have related functions.As shown in Fig. 3, predicted proteins for zmAOs have a significant level of similarity to those animal AOs and XDs and can be aligned along the whole length of the proteins. zmAOs exhibit unusual clustering of cysteines in the amino-terminal 200 amino acid residues. Nine of these 12 cysteines are conserved in both animal and plant AOs, and eight of them are conserved in both AOs and XDs. Many of them must contribute to the structure of the two Fe-S centers. Li Calzi et al. (7Li Calzi M. Raviolo C. Ghibaudi E. De Gioia L. Salmona M. Cazzaniga G. Kurosaki M. Terao M. Garattini E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31037-31045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) suggested that one (or both) of the two cysteines, amino acids 149 and 151 for bovine AO located in a strictly conserved stretch of amino acids, were involved in iron ligation in AO and XDs. These cysteines and the conserved region are found in both zmAOs (amino acids 165–176 for zmAO-1), supporting this possibility. In addition, zmAOs also contain sequences that conform to the consensus for the molybdopterin cofactor binding site (amino acids 760–853 for zmAO-1). These results are helpful for confirmation of the previous report concerning the biochemical characters of purified maize AO (17Koshiba T. Saito E. Ono N. Yamamoto N. Sato M. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, there are some additional regions conserved to some extent among plant AOs, mammalian AOs, and XDs (amino acids 597–608, 814–822, 1053–1064, and 1173–1230 for zmAO-1). Thus, plant AOs are similar to related enzymes from phylogenically different organisms, indicating they evolved from a common ancestral gene. The most primitive animal species in which AO activity has been found is the coelenterate Segartia luciae (29Krenitsky T.A. Tuttle J.V. Cattau E.L. Wang P. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1974; 49B: 687-703Google Scholar).Two consensus sequences for NAD binding are found in both zmAOs; however, AO does not require the cofactor for its catalytic activity and in fact purified maize AO is devoid of dehydrogenase activity. It is thus unlikely that these structural elements have functional significance. This is also the case for bovine AO (7Li Calzi M. Raviolo C. Ghibaudi E. De Gioia L. Salmona M. Cazzaniga G.

These regions are not conserved in animal AO proteins and plant AOs. In addition, no significant similarities are observed in those corresponding regions among animal AO proteins and zmAO-1 and zmAO-2 proteins. This may reflect the different substrate specificities of plant and animal AOs, since the former have affinity for aromatic aldehydes while the latter do not. To analyze the substrate specificity of the two zmAOs, we tried to produce recombinant proteins, but they were almost completely degraded when the cDNA were expressed in Escherichia coli. This problem also occurs with another molybdopterin cofactor-containing protein, nitrate reductase. 2M. Caboche, personal communication. Further research will be required for elucidation of the different substrate specificities of the zmAOs.In plants, AOs are thought to be involved in plant hormone biosynthesis. Molybdopterin cofactor-deficient mutants of barley and tobacco are deficient in AO and XD activities and have impaired ABA production (15Walker-Simmons M. Kudrna D.A. Warner R.L.

The ABAld oxidase oxidizes ABAld to ABA, but such an enzyme has not been purified. In the case of IAA biosynthesis, the pathway has been extensively investigated (18Koshiba T. Kamiya Y. Iino M.

Recently, a surmutant that forms an abnormal number of roots has been isolated fromArabidopsis thaliana (33Boerjan W. Cervera M. Delarue M. Beeckman T. Dewitte W. Bellini C. Caboche M.

It was thought that the phenotype was caused by overproduction of IAA, and, in fact, IAA levels are much higher in seedlings of the mutant. We have checked AO activity in the wild-type and mutant seedlings after native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, revealing that at least three AO activity bands. One band, showing a substrate preference for indole-3-aldehyde, is much more intense in the mutant seedlings. Three independent cDNA clones have also been isolated from A. thaliana using degenerate primers, and one of these is highly expressed in the surmutant. 3M. Seo, H. Sekimoto, Y. Kamiya, M. Delarue, C.

https://openalex.org/W1976771232,"Production of the placental hormone, chorionic gonadotropin (CG), increases dramatically as cytotrophoblasts fuse to form syncytiotrophoblasts. The CG α- and β-promoters are both responsive to cAMP, although the kinetics of cAMP stimulation are different. In an effort to understand the mechanisms of coordinate induction of these genes, AP-2 binding sites were identified in the promoter regions of the α and CGβ genes. AP-2 bound to the upstream regulatory element (−186 to −156 base pairs (bp)) in the α-promoter and to several different regions of the CGβ promoter, including footprints 2 and 4B (FP2, −311 to −279 bp; FP4B, 221 to −200 bp). AP-2 antibodies induced supershifts of these complexes, confirming the identity of the protein-DNA complex. In JEG-3 cells, which contain abundant AP-2, mutations in these CGβ AP-2 sites reduced basal activity and decreased cAMP stimulation. In AP-2-deficient Hep-G2 cells, co-transfection of AP-2 stimulated expression of the CGβ promoter 10–20-fold, and the α-promoter was induced by 3–6-fold. Mutations that eliminate AP-2 binding to CGβ FP4B reduced AP-2 stimulation by more than 80%, whereas mutations in FP2 reduced AP-2 stimulation by less than 50%. Analyses of AP-2 mutants revealed a requirement for the DNA binding/dimerization domain and the amino-terminal proline-rich and acid-rich transactivation domains for stimulation of the CGβ promoter. Primary cultures of placental cytotrophoblasts were differentiated into syncytiotrophoblasts in vitro to examine AP-2 expression by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. AP-2 mRNA levels increased by day 2 and continued to rise in parallel with a marked increase in α and CGβ gene expression. We conclude that both the α and CGβ promoters contain binding sites for AP-2 and suggest that this transcription factor provides a mechanism for coordinating the induction of these genes during placental cell differentiation.

It is a member of a family of hormones that are expressed in the pituitary (luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone, and thyroid-stimulating hormone) and the placenta (CG). The α-subunit is common to these hormones, and it is expressed in both pituitary and placenta. The CGβ gene is expressed almost exclusively in the placenta (3Nagaya T. Jameson J.L. Imura H. The Pituitary Gland. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 63-89Google Scholar). The function of CG is to stimulate the corpus luteum in the ovary to produce progesterone during the early stages of pregnancy. The dramatic exponential increase in CG expression in early pregnancy correlates with the formation of differentiated placental cells (4Hoshina M. Boothby M. Boime I. J. Cell.

The cytotrophoblasts fuse to form nonmitotic syncytiotrophoblast cells. The production of CG is greatly enhanced upon the formation of syncytiotrophoblasts, which also produce a variety of other hormones including placental lactogen (5Kliman H.J. Nestler J.E. Sermasi E.

The cAMP-responsive region in the CGβ promoter encompasses several protein binding domains between −311 and −200 bp (23Albanese C. Kay T.W.H. Troccoli N.M. Jameson J.L. Mol.

Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1579-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), suggesting distinct pathways for cAMP control of the two genes. Another B-Zip protein, c-Jun, negatively regulates both promoters, and it binds to the α-CRE and to the CGβ gene promoter between −245 and −220 bp (16Pestell R.G. Jameson J.L. Weintraub B. Molecular Endocrinology: Basic Concepts and Clinical Correlations. Raven Press, New York1994: 59-76Google Scholar). However, based upon antibody-mediated supershift studies, c-Jun does not appear to represent the major protein that binds to this region of the CGβ gene (16Pestell R.G. Jameson J.L. Weintraub B. Molecular Endocrinology: Basic Concepts and Clinical Correlations. Raven Press, New York1994: 59-76Google Scholar). Distinct sequences within the cAMP-responsive region of the CGβ promoter may share common binding proteins, since they cross-compete for protein interactions (24Steger D.J. Buscher M. Hecht J.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1579-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition, the TSE region from the α-promoter also competes for these proteins, suggesting that the same transcription factors might be involved in the coordinate regulation of the two promoters (24Steger D.J. Buscher M. Hecht J.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1579-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).

AP-2 is a 52-kDa protein that binds to DNA as a homodimer (37Moser M. Imhof A. Pscherer A. Bauer R. Amselgruber W. Sinowatz F. Hofstadter F. Schule R. Buettner R.

In this report, we examine a potential role of AP-2 in the regulation of the α and CGβ genes. We find that AP-2 binds to regulatory elements in both promoters and regulates the expression of these genes. AP-2 is also induced during placental cell differentiation. Nuclear extracts were prepared by the Shapiro method (40Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W.W. Keller M.J. DNA. 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) modified by the addition of protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml p-aminobenzamide (Sigma) to the final dialysis buffer. Nuclear extracts (5–10 μg) were added to a 20-μl reaction containing: 2 μl of 10 × buffer (200 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, and 1% Nonidet P-40), 500 ng of dI-dC, and 1 μg of AP-2 or Sp-1 antibodies as indicated. Reactions were preincubated on ice for 30 min before the addition of 30 fmol of radiolabeled probe with or without unlabeled competitor DNA. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min before electrophoresis (180 V, 3 h) through nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA). Oligonucleotides for electrophoretic mobility shift assays are listed in Table I. Hybridized oligonucleotides were labeled by Klenow end filling. Klenow reactions included 5 pmol of annealed oligonucleotides, 1 μl of 10 × Klenow buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), 4 μl of 25 mm deoxynucleoside triphosphates (without dATP), 3 μl of [α-32P]dATP (3000 μCi/ml, DuPont NEN), and 1 μl of Klenow fragment (Promega). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min before the addition of 5 μl of 25 mm dNTPs and incubation for an additional 10 min. After stopping the reactions, the solution was passed through Centricep columns (Adelphia, NJ) to remove unincorporated nucleotides.Figure 1Identification of AP-2 binding sites in the α and CGβ genes.

Underlined bases represent probable AP-2 binding sites. The α and CGβ luciferase constructs in the pA3LUC plasmid have been described previously (23Albanese C. Kay T.W.H. Troccoli N.M. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Pestell R.G. Hollenberg A.N. Albanese C. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31090-31096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using sequences that correspond to the mutant oligonucleotides used in gel mobility shift assays (Table I). Polymerase chain reactions were used to incorporate the mutations within the α and CGβ promoters (25Pestell R.G. Hollenberg A.N. Albanese C. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31090-31096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All site-directed mutations were sequenced to verify the mutation as well as the correct native promoter sequence. Expression vectors containing wild type AP-2 and AP-2 mutants were driven by the Rous sarcoma virus promoter (41Williams T. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 670-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Transient transfections were performed using either the CaPO4 (42Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar) or lipid-mediated (43Rose J.K. Buonocore L. Whitt M.A. Biotechniques. 1991; 10: 520-525PubMed Google Scholar) methods. CaPO4 reactions consisted of 4.5 μg of reporter plasmid, 250 μl of HEPES-buffered saline (137 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mmNa2PO4, 6 mm dextrose, 21 mm HEPES, pH 7.05) and 10 μl of 2 mCaCl2. Expression vectors (300–600 ng) were used as indicated, and equal amounts of empty vector were added to keep the total amount of expression vector constant in different reactions. Lipid transfections were performed usingl-α-phosphatidylethanolamine, dioleoyl (Sigma) and dimethyldioctadecyl-ammonium bromide (Sigma) lipids prepared by the ethanol injection method (44Campbell M.J. Biotechniques. 1995; 18: 1027-1032PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested for luciferase assays 18–24 h after transfection (45deWet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts are described above (40Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W.W. Keller M.J. DNA. 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Whole cell placental extracts were kindly provided by Dr. T. Woodruff (Northwestern University). Primary antibodies included 1:1000 AP-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and 1:1000 Sp-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and were added to nitrocellulose membranes for 60 min in solution containing albumin (5 mg/ml). After washing three times in 0.1% Tween phosphate-buffered saline, membranes were incubated with 1:10,000 secondary anti-rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 3% milk phosphate-buffered saline. After washing, membranes were subjected to enzyme-linked chemiluminescence as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Corp.). Cytotrophoblast cells were isolated from human term placenta and cultured under conditions that allow fusion into syncytiotrophoblast cells (46Richards R.G. Hartman S.M. Handwerger S. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from placental cells every 2 days over a 12-day period of culture (46Richards R.G. Hartman S.M. Handwerger S. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed (37 °C, 2 h) by the addition of 15 units of reverse transcriptase (Promega) in the presence of 10 pmol of random hexamer primers, 25 mm deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) in 1 × MI buffer (67 mm Tris, pH 8.8, 6.7 mm MgCl2, 16 mm(NH4)2SO4, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) in a total volume of 20 μl. PCR reactions included specific primers for the α and CGβ genes, AP-2, and internal controls, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and ribosomal protein 19 (RPL19). The final PCR reaction (100 μl) included a 1-μl aliquot of the RT reaction product, 50 pmol of sense and antisense primers for AP-2, α, and CGβ, along with one of the controls, GAPDH or hRPL19, in 1 × MI buffer (25 μmdNTPs, 10 μl of Me2SO, 0.5 μl of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega), and 0.1 μl of [32P]dATP (DuPont NEN). Cycle conditions were 96 °C for 30 s, 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. An aliquot (20 μl) of each reaction was subjected to polyacrylamide (6%) gel electrophoresis, and the specific products were quantitated using a Fujix 2000 phosphoimager (Fuji Medical Systems, Stamford, CT). Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance using Dunnett's test. Primers (Life Technologies, Inc.) were designed to span exon-intron boundaries to avoid amplification of genomic DNA. The primers include the following: α sense, 5′-CCAGAATGCACGCTACAG-3′, α antisense, 5′CGCCGTGTGGTTCTCCAG3′, product 222 bp; hCGβ sense, 5′-GTGGAGAAGGAGGGCTGC-3′, hCGβ antisense, 5′-GGCGGCAGAGTGCACATT-3′, product 232 bp; AP-2 sense, 5′-CTGCCAACGTTACCCTGC-3′, AP-2 antisense 5′-TAGTTCTGCAGGGCCGTG-3′, product 339 bp; GAPDH sense, 5′-GAGCCACATCGCTCAGAC-3′, GAPDH antisense, 5′-CTTCTCATGGTTCACACCC-3′, product 430 bp. The α and CGβ regulatory elements that have been shown to bind proteins in JEG-3 nuclear extracts are depicted in Fig.1 A (12Delegeane A.M. Ferland L.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3994-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 13Jameson J.L. Albanese C. Habener J.F. J. Biol.

Previous studies have shown cross-competition by a subset of these elements, including the αURE/TSE and several of the CGβ footprinted elements, suggesting that these sequences may share common transcription factors (24Steger D.J. Buscher M. Hecht J.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1579-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 47Albanese C. Colin I.M. Crowley W.F. Ito M. Pestell R.G. Weiss J. Jameson J.L. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 23-61PubMed Google Scholar). The size of the URE/TSE binding protein (24Steger D.J. Buscher M. Hecht J.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1579-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and the GC-rich nature of the DNA sequences shared by these elements raised the possibility that AP-2 might interact at these sites. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using JEG-3 nuclear extracts to assess whether a consensus AP-2 sequence competed for binding to the α and CGβ elements (Fig. 1 B). Excess (100-fold) unlabeled AP-2 oligonucleotide inhibited binding to the αURE and CGβ FP4B. The lower part of the complex that binds to CGβ FP2 was also reduced by the AP-2 competitor. As a positive control, the AP-2 competitor was shown to compete well for protein binding to the homologous AP-2 sequence derived from the human metallothionein IIA (hMTIIA) promoter (−185 to −167) (26Imagawa M. Chiu R. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 51: 251-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar, 48Mitchell P.J. Wang C. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 50: 847-861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). However, excess unlabeled AP-2 oligonucleotide did not compete with complexes that bind to the Sp-1 binding site or to CGβ FP4A, indicating that the competition is specific. These results suggest that AP-2 binds to sequences within both the α and CGβ promoters. AP-2 antibody was used in supershift assays to confirm whether AP-2 was present in the protein complexes that bind to the α and the CGβ promoter elements (Fig. 2 A). The AP-2 antibody supershifted the major complex binding to the αURE and to CGβ FP4B as well as proteins that bind to the control AP-2 element, hMTIIA. In contrast, the AP-2 antibody had no effect on protein binding to an Sp-1 element. The Sp-1 antibody had no effect on protein binding to the putative AP-2 sites, whereas it caused a supershift of the Sp-1 complex. Protein interactions with different domains within CGβ FP2 are illustrated in Fig. 2 B. When the full-length FP2 fragment was used, multiple protein complexes were observed. The addition of either AP-2 or Sp-1 antibody, but not preimmune AP-2 sera, appeared to shift part of the major protein complex, suggesting that both proteins might bind to FP2. The FP2 fragment was divided into overlapping segments FP2A, FP2B, and FP2C. AP-2 competitor DNA inhibited protein binding to the FP2A and FP2C fragments, and these complexes were also supershifted by AP-2 antibody. On the other hand, Sp-1 competitor inhibited protein binding to FP2B, and Sp-1 antibody supershifted this complex. Additional experiments confirmed that these interactions were specific, since the Sp-1 antibody did not alter binding to FP2A and FP2C and the AP-2 antibody had no effect on the FP2B complex (data not shown). These experiments indicate that AP-2 binds to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the FP2, whereas Sp-1 binds to the central region (−306 to −285 bp). The interaction of AP-2 with the FP2 region was resolved further by performing combinations of oligonucleotide competitions and antibody supershift experiments (Fig. 2 C). In the presence of Sp-1 competitor oligonucleotide, several FP2 protein complexes were diminished, and the amount of the putative AP-2 complex was increased.

Secretory vesicles and a vacuole enriched fraction purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiaealso exhibit ATP-dependent bile acid transport. ATP-dependent transport of bile acids by the vacuolar fraction was independent of the vacuolar proton ATPase, responded to changes in the osmotically sensitive intravesicular space, and was saturable, exhibiting a K m of 63 μmfor taurocholate. The BAT1 (bileacid transporter) gene was isolated from yeast DNA by polymerase chain reaction amplification using degenerate oligonucleotides hybridizing to conserved regions of ABC-type proteins. ATP-dependent bile acid transport was abolished when theBAT1 coding region was deleted from the genome and restored upon reintroduction of the gene. The deduced amino acid sequence predicts that Bat1p is an ABC-type protein 1661 amino acids in length, similar to mammalian cMOAT/cMRP1 and MRP1 transporters, yeast Ycf1p, and two yeast proteins of unknown function.

These amphipathic organic detergents are synthesized in the liver and excreted in bile into the intestine, where they are required for lipid emulsification prior to absorption. Over 90% of BA in the intestine undergoes an efficient and regulated process of enterohepatic circulation, in which BAs are taken up from the portal circulation and ultimately secreted into the canaliculus. Transport across the canalicular membrane is rate-limiting in transfer of BA from blood to bile (1Meier P.J. Meier-Abt A.S. Boyer J.L. Biochem.

U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6590-6594Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and is sensitive to vanadate (9Lin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14403-14407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas ecto-ATPase activity is vanadate-insensitive, and BA transport is unaffected in mutants lacking ATPase activity (10Sippel C.J. McCollum M.J. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2820-2826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, ecto-ATPase-free CMV exhibit ATP-dependent taurocholate uptake (11Kast C. Stieger B. Winterhalter K.H. Meier P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5179-5186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATP-dependent transport activity in the canalicular membrane is essential for translocation of many bile components from the hepatocyte into the canaliculus. Molecular characterization has indicated that ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-type proteins are responsible for these activities. ABC-type proteins are a large family of integral membrane proteins that effect ATP-dependent membrane translocation of an enormous variety of substrates and are present in organisms ranging from bacteria to man (12Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3386) Google Scholar). Members of this superfamily typically contain one or two highly conserved nucleotide binding domains (NBD), which are paired with hydrophobic regions capable of spanning the membrane multiple times. ABC-type proteins that have been identified in the canalicular membrane include MDR1, which transports hydrophobic drugs into bile (13Kaminoto Y. Gatmaitan Z. Hsu J. Arias I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11693-11698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); MDR3, a phospholipid flippase (14Smit J.J. Schinkel A.H. Oude-Elferink R.P.J. Groen A.K. Wagenar E. van Deemter L.

These transporters are not abundant in liver, and the genes encoding these proteins were initially identified in other tissues, or because of their similarity with other ABC-type proteins. MDR1 is highly expressed in multidrug-resistant cell lines, and MDR2 was first identified due to its high degree of homology with MDR1. Similarly, cMOAT/cMRP1 was isolated because it is similar in function and sequence to MRP1 (20Cole S.P.C. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurtz E.U. Duncan A.M.V. Deeley R.G. Science. 1992; 258: 1650-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (3022) Google Scholar), another ABC-type protein involved in multiple drug resistance. However, a mammalian homolog of the gene or genes that encode the ATP-dependent BA transporter has not been identified. Heterologous expression of MDR1 (21Ruetz S. Gros P. J. Biol.

Secretory vesicles purified from transgenic sec1–1 mutant yeast provide an abundant source of right-side-out membrane vesicles that are ideal for biochemical characterization of transport activity. These vesicles also contain ATP-dependent transport activities for BA and glutathione conjugates, which are similar to activities present in the bile canaliculus (23St. Pierre M.V. Ruetz S.

ATP-dependent transport of glutathione conjugates is mediated by Ycf1p (24Li Z.-S. Szczypka M. Lu Y.-P. Thiele D.J. Rea P.A. J. Biol.

Arias, submitted for publication. an ABC-type protein that exhibits considerable amino acid sequence similarity with the mammalian glutathione conjugate transporters MRP1 and cMOAT/cMRP1. Ycf1p is sorted predominantly to the yeast vacuole, which is an acidic compartment, rich in catabolic enzymes similar to mammalian lysosomes, that plays an important role in storage and homeostasis of calcium, phosphate, and amino acids (26Klionski D.J. Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 266-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that a vacuole-enriched fraction from yeast also contains an ATP-dependent BA transport activity and report the cloning and characterization of theBAT1 gene (bile acidtransporter), which encodes an ABC-type protein mediating ATP-dependent BA transport in yeast. [3H]Glutathione, [14C]chenodeoxycholic acid, [3H]cholic acid, [14C]glycocholic acid, [3H]taurocholic acid, and [3H]tauroursodeoxycholic acid were obtained from DuPont NEN; Zymolyase 100T was from Seikagaku; bafilomycin A1 was from Wako Chemicals; and Difco yeast media were from VWR. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. [3H]2,4-Dinitrophenyl glutathione (DNPSG) was synthesized and purified as described (27Awasti Y.C. Garg H.S. Dao D.D. Partridge C.A. Srivastava S.K. Blood. 1981; 58: 733-742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synthetic growth and YEPD media were prepared by standard techniques.

QL1 was derived from SF838–5Atfp1-Δ8 (MATα, leu2–3,-112, ura3–52, ade6, tfp1-Δ8::LEU2, ura3::vma1). DOY2J (ura3–52, leu2–3, 112, trp1-Δ901, ycf1Δ2::HIS3, yhd5Δ::URA3) was the progeny of mating of JWY53 and DOY2 (MATa, ura3Δ::HIS3, leu2–3, 112, his3-Δ200, yhd5Δ::URA3). DOY2, DOY10 (MATa, ura3Δ::HIS3, leu2–3, 112, his3-Δ200, bat1Δ1::URA3) and DOY11 (MATa, ura3Δ::HIS3, leu2–3, 112, his3-Δ200, bat1Δ2::URA3) were derived from RSY12. DOY12 (MATa, ura3–52, sec1–1, bat1Δ3::URA3) was derived from NY3. Secretory vesicles were prepared from temperature-sensitive sec1–1strains as described previously (23St. Pierre M.V. Ruetz S. Epstein L.F. Gros P. Arias I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9476-9479Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Vacuoles were prepared as described (32Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Buffers A, B, and C were supplemented with the protease inhibitors as follows: pepstatin A (2 μg/ml), leupeptin (2 μg/ml), aprotinin (2 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm). Glycerol was added to vacuoles in buffer C to a final concentration of 5% (v/v) before freezing at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (33Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on trichloroacetic acid-precipitated samples. Enzyme assays for marker enzymes were carried out as described (32Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). As has been reported (14Smit J.J. Schinkel A.H. Oude-Elferink R.P.J. Groen A.K. Wagenar E. van Deemter L. Mol C.A.A.M. Ottenhoff R. van der Lugt N.M.T. van Roon M.A. van der Valk M.A. Offerhaus G.J.A. Berns A.J.M. Borst P. Cell. 1993; 75: 451-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar, 16Nies A.T.

Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), vacuoles prepared by the Ficoll flotation procedure are highly enriched in vacuolar markers α-mannosidase and alkaline phosphatase (20- and 15-fold increase in specific activity relative to total homogenate, respectively). There is little or no contamination (less than 5% of the specific activity observed with the total homogenate) with enzyme markers for mitochondria (succinate dehydrogenase), endoplasmic reticulum (cytochrome c-reductase), or cytoplasm (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase). Total membranes were prepared from yeast grown in SG. Yeast cells were disrupted by bead beating in five volumes of 20 mm MES/Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μm pepstatin A, and 2 μm leupeptin. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 250 × g for 10 min. Total membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g, resuspended in disruption buffer, and frozen at 80 °C. ATP-dependent transport of [3H]DNPSG and BA was measured by the standard vesicle filtration assay. Transport by secretory vesicles was determined as described previously (23St. Pierre M.V. Ruetz S. Epstein L.F. Gros P. Arias I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9476-9479Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Vacuolar transport was measured as follows; radiolabeled substrate was added to 50 μl of 2 × reaction buffer (20 mm MES/Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm ATP, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 10 μg/ml creatine kinase) and mixed with 50 μl of vacuolar vesicles (20–30 μg of protein) prewarmed to 30 °C. At the specified time points, 15–25-μl aliquots of the reaction mix were diluted to 1 ml with ice-cold wash buffer (10 mm MES/Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl) and filtered under mild vacuum through glass fiber filters (25-mm GF/C, Whatman). The filter disks were washed with 5 ml of wash buffer, dried, and the retained counts determined by liquid scintillation. Disruption constructs were generated by PCR using chimeric oligonucleotide primer pairs (30Manivasakam P. Weber S.C. McElver J. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2799-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), which consisted of 12–15 nucleotides homologous to sequences flanking theURA3 gene insert in the Yep24 plasmid (34Botstein D. Falco S.C. Stewart S.E. Brennan M. Scherer S. Stinchcomb D.T. Struhl K. Davis R.W. Gene ( Amst. ). 1979; 8: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) on the 3′ end linked with 40–45 nucleotides homologous to yeast genomic sequences flanking the gene of interest. PCR amplification of a Yep24 template using these primers generated DNA fragments consisting of theURA3 gene flanked by short stretches of homology to the gene of interest. Transformation of the RSY12 strain with these PCR products resulted in replacement of chromosomal DNA between the regions of microhomology with the URA3 gene. DNA was prepared from URA+ transformants and deletion of the chromosomal copy of the gene confirmed by Southern analysis. PCR conditions used were 3 times at 95 °C, 45 °C, and 72 °C; and 30 times at 95 °C, 60 °C, and 72 °C (all steps 1 min).

Degenerate oligonucleotide primers used to isolate novel ABC-type genes were designed by reverse translation of the consensus aa sequences TGAGKS (forward: GTCGAATTC(A/T)CIGGIGCIGGIAA(A/G)TC) and DEATA (reverse: GTCGAATTCG(A/C)IG(A/C)IGTIGCT(T/C)TC(A/G)TC). PCR parameters were 3 × 95 °C, 40 °C, 72 °C; and 30 × 95 °C, 55 °C, 72 °C (all steps for 1 min). PCR products of 400–450 bp were gel-purified and ligated with the pCRII vector (Invitrogen). Plasmid inserts were classified into groups by restriction mapping and sequenced. Yeast total RNA for PCR analysis was purified as described (35Ortiz D.F. Kreppel L. Speiser D. Scheel G. MacDonald G. Ow D.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3491-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) and genomic DNA was prepared from spheroplasted cells (36Philippsen P. Stotz A. Scherf C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to synthesize first strand cDNA from 5 μg of RNA that had been treated with RNase-free DNase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR parameters used with cDNA and genomic DNA template were 30 × 95 °C, 55 °C, and 72 °C (1 min each step). Primer pairs used were as follows: PCR product 1, forward (F)-AAAGTATTATAATCTCTGAG (−133 bp upstream of ATG) and reverse (R)-AGTCTTGTTGGTGGAAATC (+1332 bp downstream from ATG; product 2, F-AAAGGAAGCGTATTTTTTCAC (+1018 bp) and R-AGAGTTAGTGGTTCCATTCG (+2294 bp); product 3, F-CAACATTTTATACAATAGTCC (+2372 bp) and R-CACGAATGG TGGTAACAC (+3754 bp); product 4, F-GTGATGAAGGGAGGTTTATGC (+3772 bp) and R-TATCCTTTAGCATCGAAACAG (+4986 bp, 3 bp downstream translational stop); product 5, F-GATCTTTGAAGCTTTGAAACG (+4457 bp) and R-TAGCATACCCAGATCTAGAC (879 bp downstream translational stop). One tenth of the PCR reaction was run on a 1% agarose/TAE gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed. Three clones hybridizing to the gene “C” PCR fragment were isolated from aSaccharomyces cerevisiae genomic DNA library in λ YES-R bacteriophage (ATCC 7256) (37Elledge S.J. Mulligan J.T. Ramer S.W. Spottswood M. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1730-1736Crossref Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Transfection of the Escherichia coli strain BNN132 with purified phage resulted in CRE-LOX excision of yeast shuttle vector pSE396 containing yeast DNA inserts 4–6 kb in length. Inserts from two plasmids were sequenced and combined using a unique SphI site residing 2429 bp downstream of ATG to generate an 8-kb insert containing the 5-kb open reading frame flanked by 1.5 kb of upstream and downstream sequence, respectively. In pAA17 the NruI-SmaI fragment containing the URA3 gene in pSE936 was replaced with aHindIII fragment containing the LEU2 gene. pAA43 was generated by insertion of the 8-kb BAT1 genomic fragment in pAA17. A 318-bp PCR fragment encoding aa 900–1006 of Bat1p was subcloned into the pQE70 expression vector (QIAGEN), which ligates it in frame with an ATG codon on the 5′ end and a six-histidine coding region on the 3′ terminus. Induction of E. coli containing this plasmid with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside led to overexpression of a 12.5-kDa peptide, which was purified by affinity chromatography on a nickel-agarose column (QIAGEN) and used to immunize two rabbits. Antisera from both rabbits reacted strongly on immunoblots with the 12.5-kDa peptide expressed in E. coli and with a 125–190-kDa protein in extracts derived from RSY12, or yeast strains harboring the pAA43 plasmid containing the BAT1 gene. Little or no cross-reactivity could be detected with extracts prepared fromE. coli lacking the expression plasmid, or DOY11bat1Δ2 yeast containing the pAA17 empty vector. IgG was purified from rabbit antisera on a protein A-Sephadex (Sigma) column (38Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 450-470Google Scholar). Two milligrams of purified histidine-tagged Bat1p (see above) antigen were bound to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) matrix according to the manufacturer's instructions and used for affinity purification of Bat1p specific antibodies (38Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 450-470Google Scholar). For SDS-PAGE analysis an equal volume of sample loading buffer (5% SDS, 5% dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol) was added to total membrane and vacuolar fractions and heated at 75 °C for 8 min. Equal amounts of protein were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels overlaid with a 4% stacking gel. Polyacrylamide gels were prepared from National Diagnostics reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoblots were done essentially as described (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.60-18.75Google Scholar) using affinity-purified IgG (40 ng/ml) and goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase as secondary antibody. Immunoblots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (DuPont). Membrane samples were delipidated by ethanol-acetone extraction or ether extraction of trichloroacetic acid-precipitated samples as described (40Parry R.V. Turner J.C. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20025-20032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of Bat1p was done essentially as described (38Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 450-470Google Scholar). Vacuolar membranes (200 μg of protein) were solubilized with RIPA buffer containing pepstatin A (2 μg/ml), leupeptin (2 μg/ml), aprotinin (2 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) and incubated overnight with 20 μg of affinity-purified IgG. IgG-Bat1p complexes were bound to Protein A-Sephadex beads for 1 h (Sigma), washed three times with RIPA buffer, and dissolved in sample loading buffer by heating at 75 °C before running of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were electroblotted unto PVDF-Immobilon (Millipore) in 100 mm CAPS-piperidine, pH 9.5. The bound proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue, and the Bat1p-containing membrane fragment was submitted for aa sequence determination using an Applied Biosystems Inc. model 477 protein sequencer. Yeast secretory vesicles exhibited ATP-dependent transport of various BAs (see Table I and Ref. 23St. Pierre M.V. Ruetz S. Epstein L.F. Gros P. Arias I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9476-9479Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Conjugated BAs were transported more efficiently than unconjugated BAs. A subcellular fraction enriched in vacuolar enzyme markers also exhibited ATP-dependent transport of [3H]taurocholate (Fig. 1 A). The rate of BA transport in the vacuolar fraction was dependent on substrate concentration and was saturable. ATP-dependent transport as a function of taurocholate concentration can be fitted assuming Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a predicted K m of 63 μmand V max of 14.9 nmol/mg/min (Fig.1 B). Because the specific activity and substrate affinity of ATP-dependent BA transport was higher in the vacuolar fraction than in purified secretory vesicles, and because preparation of the vacuolar fraction does not require temperature-sensitive strains, subsequent experiments were performed with the vacuolar fraction.Table IATP-dependent transport of bile acids by yeast secretory vesiclesBile acidInitial transport velocitypmol/min/mgTaurocholate51 ± 6.6Tauroursodeoxycholate66.7 ± 1.6Glycocholate45.7 ± 10.3Chenodeoxycholate4.6 ± 4.0Cholate<1.0Initial velocity of transport for radiolabeled BA was measured in secretory vesicles isolated from NY3 yeast.

Reactions were carried out in the presence of 5 μm BA and 5 mm ATP as described (23St. Pierre M.V. Ruetz S. Epstein L.F. Gros P. Arias I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Transport of BAs into membrane-bound vesicles should be sensitive to changes in the intravesicular space. Increasing the osmolarity of the reaction mix inhibited ATP-dependent transport of taurocholate in vacuolar vesicles (Fig. 1 C). When the rate of BA transport was plotted against the inverse of the sucrose concentration in the reaction mix, a straight line with an origin of approximately zero was obtained, indicating that taurocholate was translocated into the vesicle rather than merely binding to the membrane. BA transport by the vacuolar fraction was virtually non-existent at 4 °C, in the absence of ATP, or when ATP was replaced by the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, AMP-PNP. Vacuolar ATP-dependent BA transport was not inhibited by azide, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial proton ATPase, bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of the vacuolar proton pump, or ionophores that dissipate membrane potential and ΔpH (Table II). NH4Cl reduces uptake of taurocholate by 31%; however, the same degree of inhibition is observed when vacuoles lacking V-ATPase activity are used (see below), suggesting that the effect represents direct inhibition of the BA transporter rather than quenching of the ΔpH. ATP-dependent BA transport in the vacuolar fraction did not depend on activity of the V-ATPase. SF838–5Atfp1-Δ8 yeast lack the vma1 gene (31Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Wolczyk D.F. Neff N. Goebl M. Stevens T.H. Science. 1990; 250: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), which codes for the catalytic subunit of the V-ATPase, and consequently do not acidify the vacuolar space. Vacuoles purified from this strain exhibit no significant difference with regard to BA transport when compared with the vacuolar fraction prepared from an isogenic strain expressing VMA1 (Fig. 2). 100 μm sodium orthovanadate inhibits ATP-dependent BA transport by 56%. The plasma membrane proton ATPase Pma1p is also inhibited by vanadate with a K i of 1 μm (41Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7949Abstract Fu"
https://openalex.org/W1972789870,"ParA is an essential P1 plasmid partition protein. It represses transcription of the par genes (parA and parB) and is also required for a second, as yet undefined step in partition. ParA is a ParB-stimulated ATPase that binds to a specific DNA site in the parpromoter region. ATP binding and hydrolysis by ParA affect ParA activities in vitro. ATP and ADP binding stimulate ParA DNA binding and dimerization; however, ATP hydrolysis has a negative effect on DNA binding. Our current experiments reveal that ATP binding and hydrolysis affect ParA conformation and ParA sensitivity to ParB. Nucleotide binding assays show that ParA binds ATP better than ADP (K d values of 33 and 50 μm, respectively). Interaction with these nucleotides as well as ATP hydrolysis by ParA alter ParA conformation as established by CD and ParA sensitivity to heat denaturation. Finally, we show that ParB stimulates ParA DNA binding. This stimulation requires ATP hydrolysisin vitro, suggesting that one role for ATP hydrolysisin vivo is to make ParA repressor sensitive to ParB. Our observations lead to the suggestion that ATP binding and hydrolysis have separable roles in ParA repressor function and perhaps in ParA partition functions as well.

Our observations lead to the suggestion that ATP binding and hydrolysis have separable roles in ParA repressor function and perhaps in ParA partition functions as well. ParA is an essential component of the P1 plasmid partition system (1Abeles A.L. Friedman S.A. Austin S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The prophage of bacteriophage P1 exists as an autonomously replicating plasmid, and its copy number is about the same as that of the bacterial chromosome (2Ikeda H. Tomizawa J.-I. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1968; 33: 791-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The P1 partition system, Par, directs proper segregation and thus stable maintenance of the plasmid. The mechanism of partition is unknown, but can be thought of as a positioning process that via interaction with the Escherichia coli host ensures proper distribution of the plasmid. Par encodes two essential trans-acting proteins, ParA and ParB, and contains a cis-acting DNA site called parS (1Abeles A.L. Friedman S.A. Austin S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In addition, the E. coli integration host factor, IHF, 1The abbreviations used are: IHF, integration host factor; parOP, the P1 par operon operator/promoter sequences; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); AMPPNP, 5′-adenylyl β,γ-imidodiphosphate; DTT, 1,4-dithiothreitol. also participates, although it is not absolutely required (3Funnell B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6657-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). ParB and IHF bind to parS to form the partition complex (3Funnell B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6657-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 4Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14328-14337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Davis M.A. Austin S.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1881-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Assembly of this complex is assumed to be an early step in the partition pathway. Formation of this complex does not require the action of ParA (3Funnell B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6657-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 4Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14328-14337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Davis M.A. Austin S.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1881-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and we infer that ParA acts during a later step in the partition process. ParA has at least two roles in partition. First, ParA represses transcription of its own gene and parB from a promoter upstream of parA (6Friedman S.A. Austin S.J. Plasmid. 1988; 19: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). ParA repressor activity is stimulated by ParB; however, ParB has no effect on par gene expression on its own. A second role for ParA in partition is inferred from genetic data that show a requirement for ParA in partition even when its regulatory role is bypassed (6Friedman S.A. Austin S.J. Plasmid. 1988; 19: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 7Davis M.A. Radnedge L. Martin K.A. Hayes F. Youngren B. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1029-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore, we consider ParA's repressor activity its “regulatory” function, and this second, as yet undefined role as ParA's “partition” function because we think it reflects a direct role for ParA in the positioning reaction. The latter function requires that ParA interact, directly or indirectly, with the ParB-IHF-parS partition complex. ParA is an ATPase and a site-specific DNA-binding protein (8Davis M.A. Martin K.A. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1141-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The ATPase is stimulated by ParB and nonspecific DNA (8Davis M.A. Martin K.A. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1141-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). ParA is one of the better characterized proteins in a superfamily of ATPases defined by a modified Walker type A motif in the protein sequence (9Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar, 10Motallebi-Veshareh M. Rouch D.A. Thomas C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 11Koonin E. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). This superfamily includes other plasmid partition proteins such as F SopA, as well as plasmid and chromosomally encoded proteins from various bacteria species whose functions have not yet been determined (10Motallebi-Veshareh M. Rouch D.A. Thomas C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 11Koonin E. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 12Funnell B.E. The Role of the Bacterial Membrane in Chromosome Replication and Partition. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1996: 123-148Google Scholar). Many of the plasmids and bacterial chromosomes also encode a ParB homolog adjacent to the ParA homolog. The similarities of these ParA-like proteins with P1 ParA and F SopA have led to the suggestion that these homologs are also involved in plasmid or chromosome segregation (10Motallebi-Veshareh M. Rouch D.A. Thomas C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 11Koonin E. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). ParA binds to the par promoter region calledparOP (8Davis M.A. Martin K.A. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1141-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and this binding is thought to mediate ParA repressor activity in vivo. The recognition site for ParA is likely a large inverted repeat in the par promoter region, since (i) several mutations in this repeat reduce or eliminate ParA repression in vivo (13Hayes F. Radnedge L. Davis M.A. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and (ii) in DNase I footprinting experiments, protection centers over the inverted repeat, especially at low ParA concentrations (8Davis M.A. Martin K.A. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1141-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 14Davey M.J. Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29908-29913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ParA DNA binding activity is strongly stimulated by ATP (8Davis M.A. Martin K.A. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1141-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 14Davey M.J. Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29908-29913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis is not required for this stimulation; in fact, it appears to be inhibitory since ATPγS, AMPPNP, and ADP stimulate ParA DNA binding about 5-fold better than ATP (14Davey M.J. Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29908-29913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, ATP and ADP promote ParA dimerization (14Davey M.J. Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29908-29913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that ParA prefers to bind DNA as a dimer. We are interested in how ParA performs both its regulatory and partition roles. Mutation of the ParA nucleotide binding motif A interferes with both ParA repressor and partition functions in vivo (7Davis M.A. Radnedge L. Martin K.A. Hayes F. Youngren B. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1029-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, the steps at which ATP binding and hydrolysis modulate ParA function are not understood. We have further probed ParA interaction with ATP, ADP, and ParB, by examining their effects on ParA structure and function in vitro, to address these questions. We show that ATP binding and hydrolysis alter ParA conformation and that these conformational changes can be correlated to changes in ParA activity. In addition, we demonstrate that ParB stimulates ParA site-specific DNA binding activity in vitro, consistent with ParB's role as a corepressor in vivo. ParB modulation of ParA DNA binding activity requires ATP hydrolysis. We conclude that ATP binding and hydrolysis have different roles in repression and perhaps partition, presumably mediated by their effects on ParA conformation.

Restriction enzymes andE. coli DNA polymerase I large fragment were purchased from New England Biolabs. Buffer A contained 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 30 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2. Buffer B was 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 mmNa2EDTA, and 20% glycerol. Dilution buffer was 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. ParA was prepared as described (14Davey M.J. Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29908-29913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that the glycerol concentration of FrIV was adjusted to 50% (v/v) and the protein was stored at −20 °C. We consistently maintain ParA in buffers containing 10 mm DTT (14Davey M.J. Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29908-29913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), because we have observed that at lower DTT concentrations ParA oxidizes and forms disulfide cross-linked multimers, particularly after long term storage (data not shown). ParB (FrIV) was prepared as described (3Funnell B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6657-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 4Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14328-14337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that ParB FrIII was concentrated using a 1-ml Mono S column prior to gel filtration. ParB FrIII was diluted to 50 mm KCl in buffer B containing 2 mm DTT and then loaded on a Mono S column equilibrated in the same buffer. ParB was eluted in one step with 600 mmKCl in buffer B containing 2 mm DTT. Fractions containing ParB were then purified by gel filtration (4Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14328-14337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ParB (FrIV) occasionally contained a contaminating ATPase activity that could potentially interfere with the ParA assays. This ATPase activity was removed by chromatography through a heparin-agarose column. ParB (FrIV) in buffer B containing 50 mm KCl and 2 mm DTT was applied to a 5-ml column equilibrated in the same buffer and eluted with a 100-ml, 50 mm to 1m KCl gradient in buffer B. ParB (FrV) was stored at −80 °C. For DNA binding assays, ParB and/or ParA were equilibrated in dilution buffer by gel filtration through either 1-ml Sephadex G-25M or Bio-Gel P-6 columns. Hummell and Dreyer equilibrium gel filtration experiments were used to measure ATP and ADP binding by ParA (15Hummell J.P. Dreyer W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 63: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 16Myles G.M. Hearst J.E. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3824-3834Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Binding was determined as the amount of ATP and/or ADP that co-eluted with ParA through a gel filtration column. The column was equilibrated in the same buffer and [32P]ATP and/or [3H]ADP concentration as the ParA sample. A 5-ml Bio-Gel P-6 column was equilibrated in buffer A containing [γ-32P]ATP (10–20 μCi/μmol) and/or [2,8-3H]ADP (10 μCi/μmol). Two hundred microliters of ParA in the same buffer with the same concentration of nucleotide was applied to the column. Four drop fractions were collected (150–180 μl), and the radioactivity in 100 μl of each fraction was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The amount of ParA in the peak fractions was determined by Bradford assay, using a ParA standard whose concentration was determined by amino acid analysis (see “Protein Concentration Determination”). The amount of ATP bound by ParA was determined as the concentration of ATP in the peak fractions minus the background concentration of ATP (in the buffer). Experiments were performed with buffers containing 0.5, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, or 50 μm ATP using either 31 μm or 62 μm ParA in the sample loaded on the column. At least two experiments were performed at each concentration of ATP. Concentrations used in the ADP binding assays are in Table I.Table IRelative binding of ATP and ADP by ParA as measured using equilibrium gel filtrationNucleotide concentration1-aThese assays measured binding of [32P]ATP and [3H]ADP (alone or together) to ParA as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Nucleotide per ParA monomerATPADPATP:ParAADP:ParAμmpmol/pmol20200.26 ± 0.010.16 ± 0.0215230.16 ± 0.040.17 ± 0.0420—0.34 ± 0.03—ParA concentration was 60 μm.1-a These assays measured binding of [32P]ATP and [3H]ADP (alone or together) to ParA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab ParA concentration was 60 μm. Protein concentration was routinely measured by Bradford assay (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72 (2nd Ed.): 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar). The accuracy of this assay for ParA was determined by comparing the measurement of protein concentration by amino acid analysis to the measurement by Bradford assay. For amino acid analysis, ParA was equilibrated to 20 mm NH4HCO3 by gel filtration through a 1-ml Bio-Gel P-6 column. ParA hydrolysis and amino acid analysis were performed at the HSC Biotech Service Center (University of Toronto). ParA molar concentration is expressed as a monomer and ParB as a dimer. ParA DNA binding toparOP was measured using DNase I protection assays (14Davey M.J. Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29908-29913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The substrate was the 388-base pairHindIII-XhoI fragment from pMD6 (14Davey M.J. Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29908-29913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was labeled at HindIII on the 3′ end with [α-32P]dATP using DNA polymerase I large fragment (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A typical binding assay contained between 0.1 and 30 pmol of ParA (monomer), 10 fmol of pMD6 HindIII-XhoI fragment, 50 nmol of CaCl2, and 1 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA in 15 μl of buffer A. Nucleotide, when added, was present at 1 mm. The mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C, 1.25 μg of bovine pancreatic DNase I was then added, and the mixtures were incubated for an additional 60 s at 30 °C. DNase I digestion was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of “stop” solution (98% formamide, 10 mm Na2EDTA, pH 8, 0.025% xylene cyanol, 0.025% bromphenol blue (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar)). The samples were heated to 90 °C for 3 min and loaded on a 6% acrylamide urea gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried on Whatman DE81 paper and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics) and/or to Kodak XRP film. DNase I protection assays were quantified using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). We defined binding as protection from DNase I digestion of the inverted repeat in parOP by ParA. To quantify this binding in each lane, we drew a box in the area that corresponded to the inverted repeat sequences and another box around a set of bands outside of the protected region but in the same lane. The volume (“counts”) of the box corresponding to the inverted repeat was divided by the volume of the box outside of the footprint to yield the relative DNase I sensitivity of the inverted repeat. The sensitivity values obtained were normalized so that the assays that did not contain ParA had a DNase I sensitivity of 1. As the sensitivity to DNase I decreases, the protection or binding by ParA increases. Since ATP affects ParA activity, we decided to directly measure ATP binding by ParA. We used equilibrium gel filtration (15Hummell J.P. Dreyer W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 63: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 16Myles G.M. Hearst J.E. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3824-3834Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which measures ATP binding as the amount of ATP that co-elutes with protein over a gel filtration column. Since this is an equilibrium technique, one can deduce ATP stoichiometry as well as binding affinity. ParA was loaded on a Bio-Gel P-6 column that had been equilibrated in the same [32P]ATP concentration as the ParA sample. ATP that bound to ParA co-eluted with the ParA peak, and there was a corresponding trough of ATP concentration after ParA eluted (Fig. 1 A) (15Hummell J.P. Dreyer W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 63: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). ParA concentration was determined by amino acid analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”). A typical gel filtration experiment is shown in Fig. 1 A. The experiment was repeated multiple times, varying ATP concentration from 0.5 to 50 μm and using two different concentrations of ParA (31 or 62 μm). The ratio of ATP bound per monomer of ParA was calculated for each experiment, and each experiment represents one point on a binding curve (Fig. 1 B) or a Scatchard curve (Fig. 1 C) (19Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17805) Google Scholar). We were unable to measure ATP binding by ParA to saturation (i.e. at higher nucleotide and protein concentrations) because of limitations of ParA solubility at high concentration. Regression analysis on the Scatchard curve results in aK d of 33 μm ATP and 0.8 ATP binding sites (n) in a ParA monomer. This K d is close to the K m for ParA ATPase (50 μm; Ref. 8Davis M.A. Martin K.A. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1141-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Mixing experiments indicate that ParA has a slightly lower affinity for ADP than for ATP. When [γ-32P]ATP and [2,8-3H]ADP were present at equal concentrations in an equilibrium gel filtration experiment, ParA bound approximately 1.5 times less ADP than ATP (Table I), suggesting that the ParA affinity for ADP is about 1.5 times weaker than ParA affinity for ATP. When the ADP concentration was 1.5 times that of ATP, approximately equal amounts of each nucleotide were bound by ParA (Table I). In the presence of ADP, less ATP was bound by ParA than when the same concentration of ATP alone was used, suggesting that ATP and ADP are binding to the same site. We estimated a K d of 50 μm for ADP, approximately 1.5 times lower than theK d for ATP (33 μm). The different affinities of ParA for ATP and ADP indicate that ParA can distinguish between adenine nucleoside diphosphates and triphosphates. Adenine nucleoside di- and triphosphates strongly stimulate ParA DNA binding (8Davis M.A. Martin K.A. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1141-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 14Davey M.J. Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29908-29913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, ADP and ATPγS are better cofactors than ATP (14Davey M.J. Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29908-29913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether the ability of adenine nucleotides to modulate ParA activity was a consequence of their effects on ParA conformation, we examined ParA stability with and without nucleotide. We found that although ParA was quite stable at 0 °C (for at least 4 days), it was rapidly inactivated by short heat treatments at 52 °C (Fig.2), and we used this treatment to detect nucleotide-dependent changes in ParA conformation. ParA stability at 52 °C was measured in the presence of various nucleotides (Fig. 2). When ParA was heated to 52 °C for 3 min in buffer containing 1 mm ATP or ATPγS, the protein retained significantly more DNA binding activity than when it was heated in buffer with 1 mm GTP (Fig. 2, A andB). ADP (1 mm) also stabilized ParA, although not to the same extent as ATP and ATPγS stabilized ParA (Fig. 2,A and B). After this heat treatment, ParA with GTP was essentially inactivated (Fig. 2, A andB). After a shorter heat treatment (1 min), ParA with GTP retained the same activity as ParA that was heated without any nucleotide (Fig. 2 C), consistent with other assays that indicate that ParA does not bind GTP (8Davis M.A. Martin K.A. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1141-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 14Davey M.J. Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29908-29913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, ATP, ADP, and ATPγS stabilize ParA, suggesting that ParA interaction with these nucleotides alters ParA conformation. However, ADP is less effective than ATP or ATPγS. In these experiments, ParA was heated with different nucleotides and then assayed for DNA binding activity in 1 mm ATP. Although different adenine nucleotides stimulate ParA DNA binding to different extents (14Davey M.J. Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29908-29913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the differences in DNA binding activity observed here were not due to carryover of nucleotide from the heating step into the DNA binding step for the following reasons. First, the nucleotide specificity for stability (Fig. 2) differed from the nucleotide specificity for DNA binding (14Davey M.J. Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29908-29913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, when ParA was incubated at 0 °C rather than 52 °C in buffer containing 1 mm ATP, ADP, or ATPγS and then assayed for DNA binding activity in 1 mm ATP, there was no difference in activity compared with each other or to untreated ParA (data not shown). Finally, when ATP was added to ParA after, rather than before, incubation at 52 °C, there was no increase in DNA binding activity compared with no nucleotide. Therefore, we have measured the effect of nucleotide on protein stability, not on DNA binding activity, in these assays (Fig. 2). ATPγS and ATP stabilized ParA to the same extent in this assay, suggesting that ATP hydrolysis was not required for maximum ParA stability under these conditions. Because some ATPases can hydrolyze ATPγS, we tested whether ParA hydrolyzes ATPγS at 52 °C. We did not detect any ParA-dependent hydrolysis of ATPγS at 52 °C under conditions where we could detect 1% or more hydrolysis (data not shown). Under the same conditions, 2–5% of ATP (at 1 mm) was hydrolyzed, which is approximately 2–5 fold more than the rate of hydrolysis at 30 °C (data not shown). The similarity between ATP and ATPγS was also not due to ATP contamination of ATPγS. By Mono Q chromatography, no ATP was detected in the ATPγS sample (as little as 1% could be detected; data not shown). These experiments show that adenine nucleotides stabilize ParA; however, the triphosphate-bound forms are more stable than the diphosphate-bound form. This difference may reflect the difference in affinity for adenine nucleoside diphosphates and triphosphates, but may also reflect a difference in conformation. These observations suggest that ParA interaction with adenine nucleotides alter ParA conformation, resulting in increased stability. We tested the conclusion that adenine nucleotides alter ParA conformation using circular dichroism (CD). Addition of 1 mm ATP elicited a decrease in ParA molar ellipticity (θ) indicating that ATP alters ParA conformation (Fig. 3). ADP or ATPγS (1 mm) each had a smaller, but measurable effect in this assay (Fig. 3). AMP, which does not stimulate ParA DNA binding activity (14Davey M.J. Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29908-29913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), had no effect on ParA conformation (Fig. 3). The high absorbance of light in the samples containing nucleotide prevented accurate measurement of ellipticity below 219 nm. In this assay we used AMP rather than GTP as a negative control so that the absorption spectra of all nucleotides in the buffers were identical. The decrease in molar ellipticity at 222 nm indicated an increase in helicity upon ParA interaction with nucleotides (20Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1907) Google Scholar) (Table II). This increase in helicity corresponded to approximately 16 peptide bonds changing conformation in a ParA monomer (398 amino acids) with ATP and approximately 8 peptide bonds changing conformation with ADP or ATPγS. ParA, therefore, assumes three different conformations as detected by CD: ParA without nucleotide, ParA bound to nonhydrolyzable nucleotide (ADP or ATPγS), and ParA bound to hydrolyzable nucleotide (ATP). We conclude therefore that ParA interaction with nucleotide alters ParA structure and that hydrolysis further alters that structure.Table IIEffects of adenine nucleotides on ParA helicity, measured by CDNucleotideHelicity2-aCalculated from molar ellipticity at 222 nm as described by Chen et al.

Open table in a new tab We also used circular dichroism to examine the effects of adenine nucleotides on ParA stability and confirmed our initial results (Fig.2). We measured temperature-dependent changes in ParA conformation by monitoring ParA molar ellipticity at 220 nm between 25 °C and 65 °C (Fig. 4). Since ParA precipitated when it was heated, denaturation was not reversible and we cannot make any conclusions about the thermodynamics of ParA conformation in response to heat, such as the free energy change. However, we can estimate the temperatures at which ParA denatured with and without nucleotide (Table III). As in the initial stability assay, adenine nucleotides increased ParA stability (Fig. 4, TableIII). However, in this assay ATPγS did not stabilize ParA as well as ATP stabilized ParA (Table III). This result suggests that ATP hydrolysis modifies ParA conformation, as was also suggested by the ATP hydrolysis-dependent increase of ParA helical content (Fig.3). However, the ADP-bound form of ParA was still less stable than both adenine nucleoside triphosphate-bound forms.Table IIIEffect of adenine nucleotides on heat denaturation of ParANucleotide3-aConcentration of nucleotide, when present, was 1 mm.Denaturation temperature3-bTemperature at which signal at 220 nm had changed by 50% of total change.

PC1 is synthesized as a zymogen and cleaves not only its own profragment in the endoplasmic reticulum, but a subset of protein substrates in the Golgi apparatus and in the Golgi-distal compartments of the regulated secretory pathway. Likewise, mouse PC1 (mPC1) has previously been shown to cleave human prorenin in GH4 cells (that contain secretory granules) while being unable to cleave prorenin in cells, such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) or BSC-40, which are devoid of secretory granules. In the current study, we show that removal of a C-terminal tail of mPC1 allows the efficient cleavage of prorenin in the constitutive secretory pathway of CHO cells. The C-terminal tail thus appears to act as an inhibitor of PC1 activity against certain substrates in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, and its removal, which occurs naturally in secretory granules, may explain the observed granule-specific processing of certain proproteins. These results also demonstrate that PC1 is present in a partially active state prior to the secretory granules where it is processed to a maximally active state.

They are differently distributed in tissues and show maximal activity in different cellular compartments. For instance, furin, PACE4, PC5-B, and PC7 are active in the constitutive secretory pathway, whereas PC1 (also named SPC3), PC2, and PC5-A are preferentially expressed in endocrine and neuroendocrine tissues where they are thought to process prohormones in the secretory granules of the regulated secretory pathway (1Seidah N.G.

Chem. 1994; 269: 17440-17447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This 87-kDa form is targeted to the regulated secretory pathway where it is further shortened by removal of 135 amino acids of its C-terminal tail leading to a 66-kDa form (11Benjannet S. Rondeau N.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21509-21516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), but its exact role on PC1 activity is still poorly understood.Prorenin is an inactive precursor that is sorted to secretory granules where it is converted to active renin by a unique proteolytic cleavage at a specific pair of basic amino acids (Lys-Arg42,43), resulting in the removal of a 43-amino acid profragment (18Fritz L.C. Haidar M.A. Arfsten A.E. Schilling J.W. Carilli C. Shine J. Baxter J.D. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12409-12412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Chu W.N. Mercure C.

Cotransfection of expression vectors for mouse PC1 (mPC1) and human prorenin in cells that contain secretory granules (GH4 cells) leads to the secretion of active renin in the medium (21Benjannet S. Reudelhuber T. Mercure C. Rondeau N. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11417-11423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, co-expression of prorenin and mPC1 in cells that are devoid of secretory granules (CHO or BSC-40 cells) does not lead to active renin secretion, suggesting that the environment of the secretory granules is essential for prorenin processing by mPC1 (21Benjannet S. Reudelhuber T. Mercure C. Rondeau N. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11417-11423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous results have shown that the kinetics of the N-terminal prosegment cleavage of mPC1 are similar in the two cell types (21Benjannet S. Reudelhuber T. Mercure C. Rondeau N. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11417-11423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the granule dependance of prorenin processing is due to additional granule-induced modifications on prorenin and/or mPC1.Because of its unique PC1 cleavage site and its granule-dependance for activation, we have used human prorenin as a model to understand how PC1 discriminates between substrates to be cleaved in the early (TGN) and late (secretory granules) compartments of the secretory pathway. Our results suggest that the C-terminal tail of mPC1 has an inhibitory effect on PC1 activity in the constitutive secretory pathway and that the removal of this C-terminal tail in secretory granules is necessary for efficient prorenin processing.RESULTSAs shown previously (21Benjannet S. Reudelhuber T. Mercure C. Rondeau N. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11417-11423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cotransfection of GH4 cells with an expression vector for human prorenin and a control plasmid led to the secretion of inactive prorenin into the medium (see Fig. 2,proren + control), indicating that GH4 cells do not express an endogenous prorenin processing enzyme. In contrast, cotransfection of GH4 cells with expression vectors for both prorenin and mPC1 led to the secretion of about 20% of active renin (see Fig.2, proren + mPC1) (21Benjannet S. Reudelhuber T. Mercure C. Rondeau N. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11417-11423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the dependance of prorenin processing on the secretory granule environment and the role of the C-terminally truncated form of mPC1 in active renin generation, we constructed an expression vector for mPC1 containing a deletion of its C-terminal tail starting at the Arg-Arg617,618 cleavage site (Fig. 1,mPC1-ΔC). This construct should lead exclusively to the synthesis of the 66-kDa form. Cotransfection of GH4 cells with both proren and mPC1-ΔC led to a dramatic increase in the secretion of active renin (62.6 ± 2.9% of active renin), suggesting that the absence of the C-terminal tail enhances PC1 activity in prorenin processing. Although mutation of the Arg-Arg617,618cleavage site into the noncleavable Lys-Ala site in the full-length mPC1 (Fig. 1, mPC1-KA 618) would have been expected to prevent PC1 activity, transfection of this mutant with prorenin did not significantly decrease prorenin processing activity compared with native mPC1 possibly due to cleavage of the C-terminal tail at alternative dibasic sites (Fig. 4,mPC1-KA 618). When mPC1-ΔC was co-expressed with human prorenin mutated at the native profragment cleavage site, no active renin was secreted (Fig. 2,proren-K/A +42 + mPC1-ΔC), indicating that mPC1-ΔC retained its specificity for the previously reported unique cleavage site at Lys-Arg42,43.Figure 4Expression of mPC1 proteins in GH4 cells. GH4 cells were transfected with the expression vectors mPC1, mPC1-ΔC, mPC1-KA618, and mPC1-Cterm. Forty h later, cells were labeled for 2 h with [35S]methionine. Culture supernatants were then immunoprecipitated with an mPC1 antibody directed against the N-terminal part of the protein (formPC1, mPC1-ΔC, andmPC1-KA 618) or the C-terminal part (formPC1-Cterm), and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (7.5% acrylamide for mPC1 or related proteins and 12% acrylamide for mPC1-Cterm). PC1 (87 kDa) and PC1-ΔC (66 kDa) represent the predicted size of the two proteins based on co-electrophoresis of molecular weight markers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further investigate the effects of mPC1 and mPC1-ΔC on prorenin processing, pulse-chase experiments were performed on GH4 cells cotransfected with the expression vectors for prorenin and either mPC1 or mPC1-ΔC. Following a 2-h pulse-labeling period with radioactive methionine, the cells were chased by incubation in complete medium for 15, 30, or 60 min. Cell supernatants were immunoprecipitated with an anti-renin antibody and submitted to SDS-PAGE (24Brechler V. Chu W.N. Baxter J.D. Thibault G. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20636-20640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3, while co-expression of mPC1 and prorenin leads to the production of active renin whose relative abundance gradually accumulates over the chase period, the relative amount of active renin generated by mPC1-ΔC has already reached a maximum by the first time point (2 h + 15 min). Thus, removal of the C-terminal tail of mPC1 accelerates the generation and secretion of active renin from transfected GH4 cells.Figure 3mPC1-ΔC accelerates the secretion of active renin from GH4 cells. GH4 cells were cotransfected with expression vectors for prorenin and either mPC1 or mPC1-ΔC. Sixty h later, cells were labeled for 2 h with [35S]methionine and chased in complete medium for 15, 30, or 60 min. Chase media were then immunoprecipitated with an anti-renin antibody, and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide gel). Renin (43 kDa) and Prorenin (47 kDa) represent the predicted size of the two proteins based on co-electrophoresis of molecular weight markers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To exclude the possibility that the differences observed in the efficiency of prorenin processing resulted from differential expression of the various mPC1 proteins (mPC1, mPC1-ΔC, and mPC1-KA618), GH4 cells were transfected with the expression vectors for the mPC1 proteins and were pulse-labeled for 2 h with radioactive methionine. Media were immunoprecipitated with an anti-mPC1 antibody directed against the N-terminal part of the protein (11Benjannet S. Rondeau N. Paquet L. Boudreault A. Lazure C. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. As expected, pro-mPC1 was cleaved to the 87-kDa form (mPC1) and to the 66-kDa C-terminally truncated form that were both secreted in the medium (Fig.4, mPC1). In contrast, transfection of GH4 cells with mPC1-ΔC resulted in the secretion of the 66-kDa form only. Mutation of the dibasic Arg-Arg617,618 site prevented the formation of the 66-kDa form, indicating that the double point mutation was effective in inhibiting the cleavage of the C-terminal tail. However, two minor bands were also detected, probably resulting from alternative cleavages at the Lys-Arg629,630 and Arg-Arg654,655 dibasic sites (Fig. 4,mPC1-KA 618). Thus, C-terminal processing at these alternative sites results in active mPC1 since mPC1-KA618 was able to cleave prorenin in GH4 cells (Fig.2, proren + mPC1-KA 618).To investigate the role of the C-terminal tail on PC1 activity in the constitutive secretory pathway, transfection experiments were performed in CHO cells that are devoid of secretory granules and a regulated secretory pathway. The 87-kDa form of mPC1 has been shown to be the predominant form present in constitutive cells, whereas the 66-kDa form is not detected (25Zhou Y. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5615-5623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As described previously (21Benjannet S. Reudelhuber T. Mercure C. Rondeau N. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11417-11423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PC1 was virtually unable to process prorenin in these cells (Fig. 5,proren + mPC1), confirming that prorenin processing by PC1 does not occur in cells lacking secretory granules. Interestingly, secretion of about 25% of active renin was observed when CHO cells were cotransfected with expression vectors for both prorenin and mPC1-ΔC (Fig. 5), indicating that the C-terminally truncated PC1 is active in the constitutive secretory pathway. Similar to the results obtained in GH4 cells, mPC1-ΔC specifically cleaved the prorenin processing site (Fig. 5,proren-K/A +42 + mPC1-ΔC). These results demonstrate that PC1 deleted of its C-terminal tail can cleave prorenin in the constitutive secretory pathway.Figure 5The C-terminally truncated form of mPC1 processes prorenin in the constitutive secretory pathway. CHO cells were cotransfected with expression vectors for the indicated proteins. Overnight supernatants were collected 40 h after transfection and assayed for active renin.

The design of this construct assured targeting of the protein to the secretory pathway. Transfection of GH4 cells with the mPC1-Cterm expression vector led to the secretion of a protein having the expected molecular mass of 20 kDa (Fig. 4,mPC1-Cterm). Fig. 6 A shows that transfection of GH4 cells with mPC1-Cterm caused a 2.5-fold decrease in the level of active renin generated by mPC1-ΔC, resulting in a level of active renin similar to the one observed with native PC1 (from 56.3 ± 6 to 22.3 ± 2.9% of active renin). Likewise, the C-terminal tail of mPC1 was able to inhibit processing of human prorenin in the constitutive secretory pathway of CHO cells (Fig.6 B). The same inhibitory effect was obtained using an expression vector coding for the C-terminal tail of human PC1 (hPC1) (not shown). These results provide the evidence that the C-terminal tail of PC1 has an inhibitory effect on PC1 activity in the constitutive secretory pathway.Figure 6The C-terminal tail of mPC1 directly inhibits PC1 activity.

Reudelhuber T. Mercure C. Rondeau N. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11417-11423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following the cleavage of its profragment in the endoplasmic reticulum, mPC1 undergoes an additional cleavage in the secretory granules that results in the removal of its C-terminal tail (11Benjannet S. Rondeau N. Paquet L. Boudreault A. Lazure C. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 12Zhou A. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17440-17447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Vindrola O. Lindberg I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1088-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the role of the C-terminal tail of mPC1 on prorenin processing. We show that truncation of the C-terminal tail of mPC1 (mPC1-ΔC) greatly augments the cleavage of prorenin in GH4 cells and allows PC1 to cleave prorenin in CHO cells, which are devoid of secretory granules. Moreover, pulse-chase experiments in GH4 cells indicate that processed renin is secreted more rapidly when mPC1-ΔC is coexpressed compared with native mPC1, consistent with processing in the rapidly secreting constitutive secretory compartment. These results suggest that the environment of the secretory granules is not essential for the activity of mPC1-ΔC. However, in CHO cells, mPC1-ΔC generates less active renin than in GH4 cells (24.6 ± 1.2versus 62.6 ± 2.9%) although the mPC1-ΔC protein is as efficiently expressed (not shown). This observation suggests that the environment of the TGN or of the immature granules is more favorable for the activity of mPC1-ΔC in GH4 cells. It is also possible that a portion of mPC1-ΔC is sorted to the secretory granules of GH4 cells; however, pulse-chase experiments show that the bulk of mPC1-ΔC is secreted constitutively and thus never reaches the mature secretory granules (not shown).The current study demonstrates that the C-terminal tail of mPC1 can inhibit PC1 activity in the constitutive secretory pathway by an intermolecular mechanism. Our results do not allow us to determine whether in the natural state the C-terminal tail inhibits PC1 activity via an intra- or intermolecular mechanism or, in fact, if this inhibition is directly on PC1 or on a necessary cofactor for its action. However, these results and the proposed implication of the C-terminal tail of mPC1 in the sorting of the 87-kDa form to the regulated secretory pathway (17Zhou A. Paquet L. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21509-21516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) raise the possibility that the C-terminal tail contributes significantly to targeting the maximal activity of PC1 to the secretory granules.Using AtT-20 cells transfected with human prorenin, we have previously shown that the processing site for a granule-specific endoprotease between the profragment and the renin molecule seems necessary for appropriate prorenin sorting to the regulated secretory pathway (24Brechler V. Chu W.N. Baxter J.D. Thibault G. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20636-20640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This result suggests that prorenin can be driven in the regulated secretory pathway by binding to the active site of the processing enzyme prior to sorting. As prorenin activation occurs only in the secretory granules, it is possible that prorenin binds mPC1 in the TGN but is not immediately processed due to the inhibition of mPC1 by its C-terminal tail. The complex could then be targeted to the regulated secretory pathway where the environment of the secretory granules might favor the cleavage and dissociation of the C-terminal tail rendering mPC1 capable of processing prorenin.The mechanism by which the C-terminal tail inhibits PC1 activity could involve the entire tail or a more specific region. The region between amino acids 625–660 shows an important divergence between species; for instance, only 48.8% identity is found between mPC1 and hPC1 compared with 92.7% identity in the total amino acid sequence (Fig.7). Nevertheless, the C-terminal tail of human PC1 was effective in inhibiting the activity of mPC1-ΔC (not shown). A possible inhibitory mechanism could involve binding of the C-terminal tail to the active site of mPC1 by one of the several dibasic residues present in the C-terminal region. However, site-directed mutagenesis of the conserved dibasic Arg-Arg site at position 654–655 did not prevent the inhibitory effect of mPC1-Cterm on mPC1-ΔC (not shown), making it unlikely that such a mechanism accounts for the inhibition of PC1 by its C-terminal tail. Another possible mechanism could involve induction of a conformational change around the active site by binding of the C-terminal tail elsewhere on the mPC1 protein. Future studies will be necessary to test this and other possible mechanisms.Figure 7Alignment of porcine, human, rat, and mouse PC1 sequences. Consensus amino acids between porcine, human, rat, and mouse PC1 sequences (pPC1, hPC1,rPC1, and mPC1, respectively) are shown.

Potential alternative dibasic cleavage sites (bold) are also shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The functional importance of the 66-kDa C-terminally truncated form of mPC1 has been investigated in various systems. In vitrostudies have shown that the 66-kDa form of mPC1 was more active against fluorogenic peptide substrates but less stable than the nontruncated mature form (15Zhou Y. Rovere C. Kitabgi P. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24702-24706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, the C-terminally truncated form of mPC1 requires calcium concentrations above 20 mm and pH values between 5.0 and 5.5 for maximal enzymatic activity, conditions compatible with an optimal activity in mature secretory granules. Zhouet al. (15Zhou Y. Rovere C. Kitabgi P. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24702-24706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) have reported that the 66-kDa form of PC1 was more active than the 87-kDa form in generating certain products of proneurotensin in secretory granule-containing PC12 cells. Moreover, expression of a C-terminally truncated form of mPC1 in AtT-20 cells that endogenously express POMC and mPC1 greatly accelerated POMC conversion to its smaller products (17Zhou A. Paquet L. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21509-21516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, it is important to note that POMC processing is not strictly restricted to the secretory granules since processing at the junction between the 23-kDa fragment and β-LPH begins in the TGN (8Schmidt W.K. Moore H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1271-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This suggests that, in the context of the TGN, the 87-kDa form of PC1 may have a high enough affinity for certain substrates such as POMC to overcome the inhibition by its C-terminal tail. In contrast, processing of other substrates such as prorenin and proinsulin by mPC1 apparently requires the removal of the C-terminal tail within the granules, thereby limiting the activity of the processing protease to this compartment.Two other prohormone convertases, PC2 and PC5-A, are also preferentially active in the regulated secretory pathway (1Seidah N.G.

In contrast to PC1, pro-PC2 slowly exits the endoplasmic reticulum and is processed to PC2 only in the TGN where its activity is regulated by the binding protein 7B2. It has been suggested that binding of PC2 to 7B2 may prevent premature activation of PC2 in the regulated secretory pathway (26Braks J.A. Martens G.J.

To identify the residues of this cytidylyltransferase family that function in catalysis, the conserved hydrophilic amino acid residues plus a conserved tryptophan of the GCT were mutated to alanine. The most dramatic losses in activity occurred with H14A and H17A; these histidine residues are part of an HXGH sequence similar to that found in class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. The k cat values for H14A and H17A were decreased by factors of 5 × 10−5and 4 × 10−4, respectively, with no significant change in K m values. Asp-11, which is found near the HXGH sequence in the cytidylyltransferases but not aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, was also important for activity, with the D11A mutation decreasing activity by a factor of 2 × 10−3. Several residues found in the sequence RTEGISTT, a signature sequence for this cytidylyltransferase family, as well as other isolated residues were also shown to be important for activity, with k cat values decreasing by factors of 0.14–4 × 10−4. The K m values of three mutant enzymes, D38A, W74A, and D94A, for both CTP and glycerol-3-phosphate were 6–130-fold higher than that of the wild-type enzyme. Mutant enzymes were analyzed by two-dimensional NMR to determine if the overall structures of the enzymes were intact. One of the mutant enzymes, D66A, was defective in overall structure, but several of the others, including H14A and H17A, were not. These results indicate that His-14 and His-17 play a role in catalysis and suggest that their role is similar to the role of the His residues in the HXGH sequence in class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases,i.e. to stabilize a pentacoordinate transition state.

https://openalex.org/W2048938985,"The human N-formylpeptide receptor (FPR) represents one of the most thoroughly studied leukocyte chemoattractant receptors. Despite this, little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in the activation and desensitization of this receptor. To assess the role of phosphorylation in receptor function, U937 promonocytic cells were stably transfected to express the recombinant human FPR. Three mutant forms of the FPR lacking specific serine and threonine residues in the receptor C terminus were studied with respect to activation and desensitization. Replacement of all 11 serine and threonine residues within the C terminus by alanine and glycine residues (ΔST) resulted in a receptor capable of ligand binding and G protein activation similar to the wild-type receptor. However, whereas the wild-type FPR was phosphorylated on both serine and threonine residues upon exposure to agonist and displayed a significantly reduced ability to stimulate G protein-mediated GTP hydrolysis upon subsequent exposure to agonist, ΔST demonstrated a complete lack of phosphorylation and displayed little alteration in its ability to stimulate G protein-mediated GTP hydrolysis upon a subsequent exposure to agonist. In addition to desensitization of G protein-mediated GTP hydrolysis, calcium mobilization was assayed to test whether desensitization occurred at a site distal to G protein activation. However, as observed with G protein activation, ΔST underwent no desensitization of the calcium mobilization response upon a second exposure to agonist. To define more precisely the role of specific serine and threonine residues, two additional mutants were analyzed. Replacement either of Ser328, Thr329, Thr331, and Ser332 (mutant A) or of Thr334, Thr336, Ser338, and Thr339 (mutant B) resulted in functional receptors that exhibited ∼50% the level of phosphorylation following stimulation. Whereas mutant A, like ΔST, could not be significantly desensitized by exposure to agonist, mutant B exhibited partial desensitization. These results indicate that phosphorylation of the FPR is a necessary and sufficient step in cellular desensitization, that multiple phosphorylation sites are involved, and that redundant desensitization does not occur downstream of G protein activation in the signaling cascade.

Receptor activation results in the stimulation of phospholipases, the mobilization of intracellular calcium, and the activation of a multitude of protein kinases culminating in functions such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis, superoxide production, and degranulation. Following an initial exposure to ligand, resulting in transient cell activation, neutrophils rapidly become unresponsive to continued or subsequent stimulation. This process of cellular acquiescence in the presence of agonist is termed desensitization and has been characterized for many hormonal (2Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G.

Although the complex mechanisms involved in this process are poorly characterized, one of the early events has been suggested to involve receptor phosphorylation (4Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). G protein-coupled receptor kinases are a family of protein kinases that rapidly phosphorylate seven transmembrane receptors in a ligand-dependent manner (5Benovic J.L. Mayor Jr., F. Staniszewski C.

Following phosphorylation and the possible association with accessory proteins, such as arrestin, receptors are no longer capable of effectively activating G proteins, a process termed homologous desensitization (8Zhao X. Palczewski K. Ohguro H. Biophys. Chem. 1995; 56: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). G protein-coupled receptor kinases are implicated in the light-stimulated phosphorylation of rhodopsin (9Pullen N. Akhtar M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14536-14542Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and the agonist-dependent phosphorylation of the β2-adrenergic receptor (5Benovic J.L. Mayor Jr., F. Staniszewski C. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9026-9032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the FPR as well as additional chemoattractant receptors, such as the C5a and IL-8 receptors, have been shown to become rapidly phosphorylated in a ligand dose-dependent manner (10Tardif, M., Mery, L., Brouchon, L., and Boulay, F. (1993) J. Immunol. 3534-3545.Google Scholar, 11Richardson R.M. DuBose R.A. Ali H. Tomhave E.D. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14193-14201Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the FPR was demonstrated in the human cell line HL-60 (10Tardif, M., Mery, L., Brouchon, L., and Boulay, F. (1993) J. Immunol. 3534-3545.Google Scholar), which expresses endogenous FPR after terminal differentiation with agents such as dibutyryl cAMP, as well as in an FPR-transfected rat basophilic cell line, RBL-2H3 (12Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pretreatment of the cells with staurosporine, a protein kinase C inhibitor, failed to prevent the ligand-stimulated phosphorylation of the FPR (10Tardif, M., Mery, L., Brouchon, L., and Boulay, F. (1993) J. Immunol. 3534-3545.Google Scholar), but resulted in partial inhibition of the phosphorylation of other chemoattractant receptors (12Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This indicated that a kinase other than protein kinase C was responsible for the phosphorylation of the FPR. Using a fusion protein containing the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the FPR, it was demonstrated that this region of the FPR is specifically phosphorylated by a neutrophil cytosolic kinase with properties similar to those of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase GRK2 (13Prossnitz E.R. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1130-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Purified GRK2 and, to a lesser extent, GRK3 were shown to phosphorylate the FPR carboxyl terminus, whereas GRK5 and GRK6 had no activity. Site-directed mutagenesis of numerous regions of the FPR carboxyl terminus suggested a hierarchical mechanism in which phosphorylation of amino-terminal Ser and Thr residues appeared to be required for the subsequent phosphorylation of carboxyl-terminal residues (13Prossnitz E.R. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1130-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition to the homologous desensitization of chemoattractant receptors, where a ligand desensitizes only its own receptor, heterologous desensitization, where an activated receptor desensitizes one or more other inactive receptors, has also been demonstrated to occur between chemoattractant receptors (14Tomhave E.D. Richardson R.M. Didsbury J.R. Menard L. Snyderman R. Ali H. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3267-3275PubMed Google Scholar, 15Didsbury J.R. Uhing R.J. Tomhave E. Gerard C. Gerard N. Snyderman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11564-11568Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This latter form of desensitization is at least in part mediated by second messenger-activated kinases, such as protein kinase C (11Richardson R.M. DuBose R.A. Ali H. Tomhave E.D. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14193-14201Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The existence of a novel intermediate form of desensitization has been suggested by observations of the desensitization of FPR-mediated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate generation and calcium mobilization by C5a and IL-8 in the absence of FPR phosphorylation (16Richardson R.M. Ali H. Tomhave E.D. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27829-27833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). C5a and IL-8 treatment, however, did not result in desensitization of GTPγS binding, a measure of receptor-G protein coupling. This suggested that the C5a- or IL-8-mediated desensitization of FPR-mediated signaling occurred at the level of either G protein effector coupling or phospholipase C activation. In addition, since fMLF, C5a, and IL-8 all appear to utilize similar signal transduction pathways, stimulation by any one of these three ligands should engage the described downstream desensitization mechanism(s) (16Richardson R.M. Ali H. Tomhave E.D. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27829-27833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, it was predicted that fMLF stimulation would result in FPR desensitization independent of receptor phosphorylation. To investigate the mechanisms of cellular desensitization in response to fMLF, mutant forms of the FPR were generated lacking some or all of the potential phosphorylation sites contained within the carboxyl terminus and expressed in human myeloid U937 cells (17Kew R.R. Peng T. DiMartino S.J. Madhaven D. Weinman S.J. Cheng D. Prossnitz E.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The results presented here demonstrate that phosphorylation at multiple sites within the carboxyl terminus of the FPR is a necessary step in the desensitization of the receptor and that without it cells remain completely responsive to subsequent challenges with ligand. Thus, the FPR appears not to activate desensitization of a downstream component(s) activated in response to fMLF. The cDNA encoding the FPR was obtained from a human HL-60 granulocyte library as described previously (18Prossnitz E.R. Quehenberger O. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). fMLF was purchased from Sigma.N-Formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-fluorescein and indo-1/AM were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. Carrier- and acid-free [32P]orthophosphate was from Amersham Corp. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. RPMI 1640 medium was from Whittaker Bioproducts; fetal bovine serum was from Hyclone Laboratories. The FPR gene was subcloned into the EcoRI site in the polylinker of M13mp18 and mutagenized as described (19Prossnitz E.R. Quehenberger O. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). U937 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. For transfection, ∼4 × 106 cells were harvested and resuspended in 400 μl of RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mm glucose and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol (20Prossnitz E.R. Quehenberger O. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5704-5715PubMed Google Scholar). Linearized DNA (10 μg in a volume of 10 μl) was added to the cells and preincubated for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were then subjected to a 240-V pulse from a 960-microfarad capacitor (resulting in a pulse time constant of ∼30 ms) and immediately returned to 5–10 ml of culture medium. The following day, G418 was added to a final active concentration of 1 mg/ml. As the selection proceeded, the cells were centrifuged and resuspended in fresh medium (containing G418) at 4–6-day intervals. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 6% CO2 and 94% air. U937 cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended at 106 cells/ml in phosphate-buffered saline. Binding was carried out in 0.5 ml withN-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-fluorescein at 10 nm (21Prossnitz E.R. Schreiber R.E. Bokoch G.M. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10686-10694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Following incubation for at least 15 min on ice, the cells were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) for fluorescent intensity. Debris and dead cells were excluded with a gate on forward and side scatter. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm fMLF. Ligand binding assays were performed on membranes prepared by nitrogen cavitation in a final volume of 0.2 ml of binding buffer. Membranes (30 μg of protein) were suspended in binding buffer (pH 7.4) consisting of 140 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm KH2PO4, 5 mmNa2HPO4, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 0.3 mm MgSO4, 1 mmMgCl2, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Binding was initiated by the addition of various amounts of [3H]fMLF. Equilibrium binding was carried out at 23 °C for 45 min and terminated by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/C filters followed by three washes with 0.75 ml of ice-cold binding buffer. Specific binding was calculated as total binding minus nonspecific binding, determined in the presence of 50 μm unlabeled fMLF. Each determination was done in duplicate. The amount of bound ligand was estimated by scintillation counting, and the binding data were analyzed by fitting to a double rectangular hyperbola with the nonlinear curve fitting program SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific). In the presence of GTPγS, only one binding affinity was observed, corresponding to the low affinity state of the receptor. In the absence of GTPγS, two binding affinities were observed, representing the high and low affinity binding states, corresponding to the G protein-coupled and uncoupled forms of the receptor, respectively. G protein activation was determined directly by measuring the ligand-induced hydrolysis of GTP by G proteins. Membranes (20 μg of protein) prepared by nitrogen cavitation were incubated with [γ-32P]GTP in the following buffer: 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmATP, 0.5 mm AMP-PNP, 0.25 mm ouabain, 1 mm creatine phosphate, 5 units/ml phosphocreatine kinase, and 1 μm GTP (containing 2–4 μCi of [γ-32P]GTP). The incubation was carried out for 5–10 min at room temperature in the presence or absence of ligand. The assay was stopped with a 9-fold excess of ice-cold 5% (w/v) Norit A charcoal (J. T. Baker Inc.) in an aqueous solution containing 57 mmphosphoric acid. The charcoal and bound guanine nucleotides were sedimented by centrifugation, and the liberated [32P]phosphate in the supernatant was determined by scintillation counting. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml in Hanks' buffered saline solution. The cells were incubated with 5 μm indo-1/AM for 25 min at 37 °C, washed once with Hanks' buffered saline solution, and resuspended at ∼106cells/ml in Hanks' buffered saline solution containing 1.5 mm EGTA (pH 8.0). The elevation of intracellular Ca2+ by various amounts of fMLF was monitored by continuous fluorescent measurement using an SLM 8000 photon-counting spectrofluorometer (SLM-AMINCO) detecting at 400 and 490 nm, as described (18Prossnitz E.R. Quehenberger O. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The concentration of intracellular Ca2+ was calculated as described (22Cobbold P.H. Rink T.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 313-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). FPR-transfected U937 cells were grown to a density of 1.0–1.5 × 106 cells/ml and washed three times with 150 mm NaCl and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) to remove traces of phosphate. Cells were resuspended in phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) to a density of 107 cells/ml in a volume of ∼0.5 ml to which was added 1 mCi of carrier- and acid-free [32P]orthophosphate (10 mCi/ml). Cells were loaded for 3 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 6% CO2and 94% air. Following loading, cells were stimulated with fMLF as indicated and immediately lysed by the addition of 0.33 volume of 4 × radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (40 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 600 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 0.4% SDS, 2% deoxycholate, 4% Triton X-100, 4 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 40 mm sodium phosphate, 40 mm NaF, 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 400 ng/ml aprotinin, and 200 μg/ml pepstatin A). Following lysis and extraction for 10 min while rotating at 4 °C, samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble debris. The supernatant was added to 10 mg of protein A-Sepharose that had been precoated with 15 μl of a rabbit antiserum directed against the C-terminal 12 amino acids of the FPR. The use of this antibody for immunoprecipitating the photoaffinity-labeled FPR has been previously described (23Schreiber R.E. Prossnitz E.R. Ye R.D. Cochrane C.G. Jesaitis A.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 53: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Following binding for 1 h while rotating at 4 °C, the beads were washed as follows: once with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.2% SDS (pH 8.0); once with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS (pH 8.0); once with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl and 500 mm NaCl (pH 8.0); and finally with phosphate-buffered saline. Laemmli sample buffer (2-fold concentrated, 40 μl) was added, and the samples were heated at 37 °C for 10 min, followed by electrophoresis on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were dried, and relative determinations of32P content were performed with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Phosphoamino acid content was determined as described (24Cooper J.A. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Briefly, following transfer of the SDS gel to an Immobilon P membrane (Millipore Corp.), the immunoprecipitated band was excised and hydrolyzed in 100–200 μl of 6 m HCl for 1 h at 100–110 °C. The sample was dried in a SpeedVac concentrator; resuspended with 0.5 μg each of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine in a volume of 3–5 μl; and spotted onto a cellulose thin-layer plate (100 μm; EM Laboratories). Phosphoamino acids were separated by chromatography in 5:3 isobutyric acid/ammonium hydroxide (0.5 m). Unlabeled phosphoamino acid standards were visualized with ninhydrin, whereas32P-labeled phosphoamino acids were visualized with a PhosphorImager. For desensitization of GTPase activity, cells were harvested, resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) to a density of 107 cells/ml, divided into two equal parts, and stimulated with either 1 μm fMLF or buffer for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then added to ice-cold buffer, harvested, and processed for membranes by nitrogen cavitation. Membranes from fMLF-treated and untreated cells were then assayed for GTPase activity as described above. For desensitization of the calcium mobilization response, cells (5 × 106) were loaded with indo-1/AM as described above for calcium determinations and divided into two parts. One was stimulated with 1 μm fMLF for 10 min, whereas the other was treated with only buffer. The cells were then washed three times with Hanks' buffered saline solution at room temperature to remove surface-bound fMLF and resuspended for assay of calcium mobilization as described above. To examine the role of receptor phosphorylation in cellular desensitization in response to fMLF, a novel model system employing a human myeloid cell line was used. In addition to expressing the recombinant wild-type FPR, three mutant forms of the receptor were also expressed (Fig. 1). The first mutant, ΔST, had alanine or glycine substituted for each of the 11 serine and threonine residues of the carboxyl terminus. The high number of glycine residues used was due to the fact that 9 of 12 amino acids between Ser328 and Thr339 would have been alanine in the final receptor sequence. Given the helix-forming propensity of such an alanine-rich sequence, numerous serine and threonine residues were converted to glycine with the intent of eliminating any possible structural aberrations. In addition to ΔST, two mutants were generated changing only four Ser and Thr residues at a time (mutants A and B) (Fig. 1). These mutants, previously expressed as glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins containing the carboxyl-terminal 47 amino acids of the FPR, have been shown to represent potential sites of phosphorylation by GRK2 in vitro (13Prossnitz E.R. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1130-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Their role in desensitization was to be elucidated here. Mutant forms of the FPR cDNA were generated by site-directed mutagenesis, subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pSFFV.neo, and introduced into the human myeloid cell line U937 by electroporation. Transfected cells were selected in the presence of G418 and analyzed for cell-surface expression of ligand binding by flow cytometry (Fig. 2). All three mutants demonstrated binding of the fluorescent ligandN-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-fluorescein at levels comparable to those of the wild-type receptor. Expression of the wild-type FPR in U937 cells has previously been shown to yield binding affinities for [3H]fMLF similar to those of the FPR from dibutyryl cAMP-differentiated U937 cells and neutrophils (17Kew R.R. Peng T. DiMartino S.J. Madhaven D. Weinman S.J. Cheng D. Prossnitz E.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Detailed ligand binding studies performed here using [3H]fMLF demonstrated that the mutant forms of the FPR exhibited both high and low affinity binding sites similar to those of the wild-type FPR (TableI). In the presence of GTPγS, which irreversibly activates and dissociates G proteins, only one low affinity binding site was observed. These result are consistent with a fraction of the wild-type and mutant receptors being coupled to G proteins in the absence of GTPγS, suggesting that the mutant receptors might be capable of G protein activation.Table ILigand binding parameters of the wild-type and mutant forms of the FPRReceptorWild-typeΔSTMutant AMutant BHigh affinity1-aHigh and low affinity binding were determined in the absence of GTPγS.Kd = 2.5 ± 1.2 nmKd = 1.8 ± 0.7 nmKd = 1.4 ± 0.5 nmKd = 1.7 ± 0.8 nmB max = 330 ± 147 fmol/mgB max = 548 ± 193 fmol/mgB max = 457 ± 156 fmol/mgB max = 301 ± 189 fmol/mgLow affinity1-aHigh and low affinity binding were determined in the absence of GTPγS.Kd = 72 ± 38 nmKd = 46 ± 22 nmKd = 55 ± 24 nmKd = 62 ± 27 nmB max = 1345 ± 560 fmol/mgB max = 1427 ± 711 fmol/mgB max = 1570 ± 503 fmol/mgB max = 1830 ± 791 fmol/mg+GTPγSKd = 89 ± 32 nmKd = 78 ± 37 nmKd = 97 ± 44 nmKd = 128 ± 57 nmB max = 502 ± 247 fmol/mgB max = 875 ± 423 fmol/mgB max = 1412 ± 642 fmol/mgB max = 1773 ± 797 fmol/mgLigand binding assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” either in the presence or absence of 2 μmGTPγS as indicated.

Open table in a new tab Ligand binding assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” either in the presence or absence of 2 μmGTPγS as indicated. The data were analyzed using a two-site model. In the presence of GTYγS, where one of the sites represented <1% of the total number of sites, it was taken to indicate that only a single site existed. To examine the functional coupling of the wild-type FPR as well as the mutant forms of the FPR, monitoring of intracellular calcium fluxes was performed with indo-1. Stimulation of each transfected cell line with 1 μm fMLF resulted in a rapid rise in intracellular calcium (Fig. 3). Stimulation of untransfected or vector-transfected cells yielded no such response, indicating that undifferentiated U937 cells do not express any FPR (data not shown). The rise in intracellular calcium was transient, returning to base line within ∼60 s. Taken together, these results indicate that the Ser and Thr residues of the carboxyl terminus of the FPR do not play a direct role in G protein activation or affect receptor function in such a way as to preclude ligand binding or signal transduction. Previous data have suggested that the carboxyl terminus of the FPR is capable of being phosphorylated by a neutrophil kinase with properties similar to those of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase GRK2 as well as by purified GRK2 itself (13Prossnitz E.R. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1130-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To examine this reaction in vivo, transfected U937 cells were loaded with32P-labeled inorganic phosphate, stimulated with fMLF, and extracted with detergent for immunoprecipitation of the FPR. Compared with unstimulated FPR-transfected U937 cells (Fig.4 A, lane 1), fMLF-stimulated cells showed a diffuse band with a molecular mass of 50–70 kDa (lane 2). This diffuse band has previously been shown to represent the glycosylated form of the FPR. Immunoprecipitation of the phosphorylated FPR was blocked by preincubation of the anti-FPR antiserum with the C-terminal peptide used as antigen (Fig. 4 A, lane 3), but not by a peptide from the third intracellular loop (lane 4). The phosphorylated FPR was also not immunoprecipitated from FPR-transfected cells by preimmune serum (Fig.4 A, lane 5) or from vector-transfected U937 cells by the anti-FPR antiserum (Fig. 4 B, lane 2), again confirming the absence of the FPR in the latter cells. To determine the identity of the phosphorylated amino acids, acid hydrolysis was performed on the isolated phosphorylated FPR. Chromatographic separation of the phosphoamino acids revealed that both serine and threonine residues were phosphorylated, with no phosphotyrosine detected. Approximately equal amounts of the two phosphoamino acids were detected (55% phosphothreonine and 45% phosphoserine), similar to what was demonstrated for GRK2-mediatedin vitro phosphorylation of the isolated FPR carboxyl terminus. Phosphorylation of the wild-type FPR in response to fMLF occurred in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5 A). The EC50 for phosphorylation was similar to the EC50 for calcium mobilization, ∼2 × 10−8m"
https://openalex.org/W2047765304,"The triose phosphate 3-phosphoglycerate phosphate translocator (TPT) is a chloroplast envelope inner membrane protein whose transit peptide has structural properties typical of a mitochondrial presequence. To study the TPT transit peptide in more detail, we constructed two chimeric genes encompassing the TPT transit peptide and either 5 or 23 amino-terminal residues of the mature TPT, both linked to the reporter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene.

Extension of the TPT transit peptide to 23 residues of the mature TPT allowed specific import and processing of CAT into chloroplasts. These results indicate that, despite its unusual structure, the TPT transit peptide is able to target a passenger protein specifically into chloroplasts, provided that NH2-terminal residues of the mature TPT are still present.

Mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own genetic information. However, these endosymbionte-derived genomes have a limited coding capacity, as most of their genes were transferred to the nucleus during evolution. The majority of the organellar proteins are thus nuclear-encoded and synthesized in the cytosol as larger precursor forms. The latter usually have an amino-terminal targeting sequence (called presequence for the mitochondria and transit peptide for the chloroplast), which is responsible for directing transport of the precursors to their respective organelles (1Archer E.K. Keegstra K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 789-810PubMed Google Scholar, 2de Boer A.D. Weisbeek P.J. Biochim. Biophys.

The mitochondrial and chloroplast targeting signals have some intriguing structural similarities. Both are rich in basic and hydroxylated amino acids and usually lack acid and apolar amino acid residues (4von Heinje G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar, 5Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). However, their predicted secondary structures differ. Whereas mitochondrial presequences are predicted to form an amphiphilic α-helix, chloroplast transit peptides display a random coil structure (6Schmidt G.W. Devillers-Thiery A. Desrusseaux H. Blobel G.F. Chua N.-H. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 83: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 7von Heinje G. Nishikawa K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 278: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). As a consequence, the in vivo import process is assumed to be specific to each organelle. This has been observed experimentally (2de Boer A.D. Weisbeek P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 221-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 8Boutry M. Nagy F. Poulsen C. Aoyagi K. Chua N.H.

Biol. 1990; 14: 977-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), indicating that protein import into mitochondria and chloroplasts follows different routes. An unusual situation is observed with the chloroplast triose phosphate 3-phosphoglycerate-phosphate translocator (TPT), 1The abbreviations used are: TPT, triose phosphate 3-phosphoglycerate-phosphate translocator; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; Rubisco, ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. a protein of the chloroplast envelope inner membrane. This transporter is encoded in the nucleus and synthesized as a higher molecular weight precursor in the cytosol. It bears an NH2-terminal transit peptide, which is assumed to direct transport across the envelope membrane (11Flügge U.-I. Fisher K. Gross A. Sebald W. Lottspeich F. Eckerskorn C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Recently it was shown by in vitro import studies that the transit sequence contains only stromal targeting information and that a hydrophobic region of the NH2-terminal of the mature TPT might be responsible for directing the protein to the inner envelope membrane (12Knight J.S. Gray J.C. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1421-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13Brink S. Fischer K. Klösgen R.-B. Flügge U.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20808-20815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Several phosphate translocator genes have been isolated from various species. Analysis of the structures predicted for the various transit peptides reveals, in the majority of cases, the presence of a positively charged amphiphilic α-helix in the NH2-terminal region (14Knight J.S. Gray J.C. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 586-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15Fischer K. Arbinger B. Kammarer B. Bush C. Brink S. Wallmeier H. Sauer N. Eckerskorn C. Flügge U.-I. Plant J. 1994; 5: 215-226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, this feature is typical of mitochondrial presequences. Consistent with this observation is the report that the phosphate translocator is imported and processed in mitochondria isolated from yeast and broad bean (16Brink S. Flügge U.-I. Chaumont F. Boutry M. Emmermann M. Schmitz U. Becker K. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 (2nd Ed.): 16478-16485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, these data did not prove that the TPT transit peptide was sufficient for in vitro mitochondrial uptake. Moreover, the hydrophobic nature of TPT made its analysis more difficult as, inin vitro uptake assays, the mitochondrial outer membrane is the only hydrophobic environment offered to the TPT precursor. The paradox is thus that the TPT is imported in vitro both in chloroplasts and in mitochondria, but that, in vivo, the TPT localization is the chloroplast only. This suggests that in vivo either TPT is only targeted to chloroplasts or that it is targeted to both organelles and destroyed in mitochondria. To resolve this conflict, we prepared two chimeric genes linking the TPT translocator transit peptide and either 5 or 23 residues of the NH2-terminal mature protein, to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), a soluble reporter protein. We show here that the TPT transit peptide can direct transport of CAT into both isolated chloroplasts and mitochondria. However, when the same constructs were tested in transgenic plants, CAT was found mainly in the cytosol or in the chloroplast depending on whether the TPT transit peptide was followed by 5 or 23 residues of the mature TPT. These results question the in vitro approach to studying specificity of targeting. They also indicate that the TPT transit peptide requires residues of the amino part of the mature TPT for specific in vivotargeting to the chloroplast. Standard procedures were used for DNA manipulations (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The constructs assembling the TPT transit peptide and CAT were made as follows. The pSP72 plasmid carries a cDNA fragment corresponding to the 5′-noncoding region, the entire transit peptide, and 42 amino acids from the mature spinach phosphate translocator (11Flügge U.-I. Fisher K. Gross A. Sebald W. Lottspeich F. Eckerskorn C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). This fragment was released by HindIII andBglII digestion. Two 3′-shortened fragments were obtained by polymerase chain reaction. The first fragment (TPT5) corresponds to the entire TPT transit peptide and 5 amino acids from mature TPT; the second (TPT23) comprises the whole TPT transit peptide and 23 amino acids from mature TPT. Synthetic primers provided with flankingHindIII sites were as follows. The TPT5 and TPT23 upstream primer was 5′- CCCCCAACTTCTTCCGACAATGGAG. The TPT5 downstream primer was 5′-CCCCCAAGCTTCCAGAGCCACTAGCGGC. The TPT23 downstream primer was 5′-CCCCCAAGCTTCCGCCAGTGACAAGAGC. After polymerase chain reaction amplification, the fragments were digested with HindIII and cloned into the HindIII site of the polylinker region of SK(+) Bluescript (Stratagene), resulting in the TPT5 and TPT23 plasmids, respectively. Both constructs were sequenced. The CAT encoding sequence was isolated by HindIII andBamHI digestion of plasmid pBin35ScatE9′ (18Chaumont F. Silva-Filho M.de C. Thomas D. Leterme S. Boutry M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and inserted into the corresponding sites of SK(+) Bluescript, resulting in the CAT plasmid. The HindIII site previously used for inserting targeting sequences (8Boutry M. Nagy F. Poulsen C. Aoyagi K. Chua N.H. Nature. 1987; 328: 340-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 18Chaumont F. Silva-Filho M.de C. Thomas D. Leterme S. Boutry M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) is localized 75 nucleotides upstream of the CAT translation initiation codon. When translated, this region encodes a cryptic mitochondrial cleavage site (18Chaumont F. Silva-Filho M.de C. Thomas D. Leterme S. Boutry M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Using polymerase chain reaction, therefore, we engineered a new CAT gene provided with aHindIII site 10 nucleotides upstream of the CAT translation initiation codon. Primers were as follows. The upstream primer was 5′-CCCCCAAGCTTGGAAGCTAAAATGGAG. The downstream primer was 5′-CCATACGGAATTCCGG. This new construct was checked by sequencing. To prepare the TPT-CAT constructs, the TPT5 and TPT23 fragments were obtained by HindIII digestion and cloned at theHindIII site of the modified CAT plasmid digested previously with HindIII, resulting in TPT5-CAT and TPT23-CAT. TPT-CAT constructs for tobacco transformation were prepared as follows. The TPT5-CAT and TPT23-CAT plasmids were digested with BamHI and partial HindIII, releasing the fragments TPT5-CAT and TPT23-CAT. These fragments were inserted into the corresponding sites of Bin35ScatE9′ (18Chaumont F. Silva-Filho M.de C. Thomas D. Leterme S. Boutry M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), digested previously with HindIII andBamHI, producing the plant transformation vectors Bin35S-TPT5-CAT and Bin35S-TPT23-CAT, respectively. The plasmids TPT5-CAT and TPT23-CAT were linearized with BamHI. Transcription was carried out in the presence of 7mGpppG using T7 RNA polymerase (19Chaumont F. O'Riordan V. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16856-16862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Translation was performed in a reticulocyte lysate system (Boehringer Mannhein) in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham). In vitro import reactions were performed with broad bean mitochondria isolated from dark-grown hypocotyls as described previously (19Chaumont F. O'Riordan V. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16856-16862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that 1% bovine serum albumin was added to the import medium. In vitro import in spinach chloroplasts was performed as described by Bartlett et al. (20Bartlett S.G. Grossman A.R. Chua N.-H. Edelman M. Hallick R. Chua N.-H. Methods in Chloroplast Molecular Biology. Elsevier, Amsterdam1982: 1081-1091Google Scholar). Plant expression vectors were mobilized in the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA 4404 by triparental mating. Helper plasmid pRK 2013 (21Bevan M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 8711-8721Crossref PubMed Scopus (1813) Google Scholar) was used. Leaf discs of Nicotiana tabacum cv SR1 were infected, and transgenic plants were raised as described (22Horsch R.B. Fraley R.T. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 627-640Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar). All the experiments reported here were carried out on F1 plants obtained after self-crossing. Subcellular fractions were obtained from 10 g of leaves as described previously (18Chaumont F. Silva-Filho M.de C. Thomas D. Leterme S. Boutry M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), except that homogenization was performed in 50 ml of homogenization buffer and that 0.2% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone was added to the buffer. Purification of chloroplasts and thykaloids on a continuous Percoll gradient was performed as described (23Bruce, B. D., Perry, S., Froehlich, J., and Keegstra, M. (1994) inPlant Molecular Biology Manual (Gelvin, S. B., and Schilperoort, R. A., eds) 2nd Ed., Section J1, pp. 1–15, Kluwer Academic Publishers, London.Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the enhanced alkaline copper assay (24Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. After sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and immunodetected with antibodies raised against purified CAT (1/1,000), lipoamide dehydrogenase (1/8,000), ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (1/20,000) followed by125I-protein A (see Fig. 4, A and Cand Fig. 5) or chemiluminescence (see Fig. 4 B) detection. Signals were quantitated using an Image Master densitometer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.).Figure 5Subcellular fractionation of CAT from a TPT23-CAT plant.

Fisher K. Gross A. Sebald W. Lottspeich F. Eckerskorn C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We replaced the mature TPT by the CAT reporter protein for a double purpose. First, it exchanged a hydrophobic protein for a soluble passenger protein and therefore avoided the problem of unspecific binding of the precursor to the outer chloroplast or mitochondrial membrane through hydrophobic interactions. Second, it enabled us to test directly the ability of the transit peptide on its own to target a protein to either chloroplasts or mitochondria. CAT was chosen because it had previously been shown to be targeted to either organelle according to the targeting sequence (8Boutry M. Nagy F. Poulsen C. Aoyagi K. Chua N.H. Nature. 1987; 328: 340-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Two constructs were prepared (Fig. 1). One, TPT5-CAT, retained 5 residues of the mature TPT to still allow cleavage of the transit peptide which might have required surrounding residues. The second construct, TPT23-CAT, included 23 residues of the mature TPT, in case the amino-terminal part of the mature TPT was also involved in targeting, as this had already been shown for the chlorophylla/b-binding protein (25Kavanagh T.A. Jefferson R.A. Bevan M.W. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1988; 215: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26Silva-Filho M.de C. Chaumont F. Leterme S. Boutry M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 769-780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both chimeric genes were placed on an Escherichia coliplasmid, under the control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. RNA transcribed in vitro was translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine. The precursors (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 6) were imported into spinach chloroplasts and processed to a mature protein (lanes 2 and 7), whose size, compared with that of CAT without a transit sequence (lane 5), was compatible with the extra 11 (TPT5-CAT) or 29 (TPT23-CAT) residues remaining upstream of the CAT initiation codon (Fig. 1). The mature CAT was inside the chloroplast, as a brief sonication released it into the soluble fraction (lanes 3 and 8). We therefore concluded that the TPT transit peptide with 5 or 23 residues of the mature protein was sufficient to target a foreign protein in vitro into chloroplasts. No further analysis was performed with chloroplast import as our results were in agreement with the data showing that the TPT transit peptide is a signal for in vitro stromal targeting (12Knight J.S. Gray J.C. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1421-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13Brink S. Fischer K. Klösgen R.-B. Flügge U.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20808-20815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The spinach TPT precursor has been shown to be imported in vitro into plant or yeast mitochondria (16Brink S. Flügge U.-I. Chaumont F. Boutry M. Emmermann M. Schmitz U. Becker K. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 (2nd Ed.): 16478-16485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In vitro mitochondrial uptake of the TPT-CAT precursors was therefore performed with mitochondria isolated from etiolated seedlings of broad bean. This material, which circumvents the problem of contaminating chloroplasts, was shown previously to allow the uptake of mitochondrial, and not chloroplast, precursors (19Chaumont F. O'Riordan V. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16856-16862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of the labeled precursors (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2 and 6) with purified mitochondria produced a cleaved mature form (lanes 3 and 7), whose size, compared with that of CAT without the additional sequence (lanes 1and 5), suggests that cleavage occurred between the transit peptide and the sequence kept from the mature TPT (Fig. 1). The mature proteins were protected against externally added proteinase K, indicating that they were effectively imported into the organelle (Fig.3 A, lanes 4 and 8). Contrary to the import experiment performed with chloroplasts (Fig. 2), a significant amount of unprocessed precursor was found bound to the mitochondria but was degraded upon proteinase K digestion. A similar observation has been reported for a truly mitochondrial precursor (19Chaumont F. O'Riordan V. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16856-16862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As 5TPT-CAT and 23TPT-CAT behaved similarly, the next experiments were performed using the shortest construct only. To show the dependence of TPT5-CAT mitochondrial uptake on import machinery, we performedin vitro uptake experiments in the presence of valinomycin, a potassium ionophore and an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B). Mitochondrial import of TPT5-CAT was prevented (lanes 4 and 5), indicating that uptake depends on an electrochemical potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Import was also prevented when oligomycin, a specific inhibitor of the mitochondrial ATP synthase, was added to the import medium (Fig. 3 B, lanes 6 and 7). Import thus requires internal ATP. Other import parameters were found to be typical of mitochondrial import: requirement of external ATP, absence of import at 0 °C or with trypsin-treated mitochondria (data not shown). In conclusion, properties of the in vitro import of TPT-CAT precursors into mitochondria are similar to those of the import of a truly mitochondrial protein. The results reported so far support the conclusion that the TPT transit peptide is capable of addressing a passenger protein in vitro into both isolated chloroplast and mitochondria. Moreover, this import displays the expected properties of a process that depends on a functional translocation machinery. Since TPT has never been foundin vivo in plant mitochondria, it could be hypothesized that sequences within the mature TPT and absent in the chimeric proteins analyzed here are involved in specifically directing the protein to chloroplasts. An alternative explanation would be to consider thatin vitro uptake does not reflect what occurs in vivo, possibly due to a lack of the cytosolic factors involved in targeting specificity. Finally, we also have to consider the possibility that in vivo TPT is also targeted to mitochondria but rapidly degraded. To evaluate these hypotheses, we equipped the TPT5-CAT and TPT23-CAT constructs with the 35S transcription promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus and the 3′-noncoding region of a pea Rubisco small subunit gene. The chimeric genes were introduced into tobacco, using an A. tumefaciens Ti plasmid-derived vector. Transgenic plants were selfed, and several independent F1 plants were characterized for both constructs. Subcellular fractionation of the plant material was performed by centrifugation to obtain a crude cytosolic supernatant and a crude organellar pellet. Chloroplast- and mitochondria-enriched fractions were also obtained by differential centrifugation and subsequent purification of the organelles on Percoll gradients. To evaluate organelle enrichment, we immunodetected in the various fractions the large subunit of Rubisco, a soluble marker of the chloroplastic stroma, and the lipoamide dehydrogenase, a soluble mitochondrial marker found in several mitochondrial matrix enzymes (27Turner S.R. Ireland R. Rawsthorne S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7745-7750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Distribution of these markers among the various fractions was analyzed by Western blot (an example is shown in Fig. 4 A) and quantitated by image analysis (Fig. 4 C). The majority of the Rubisco was released into the supernatant, confirming the high sensitivity of tobacco chloroplasts to mechanical grinding (26Silva-Filho M.de C. Chaumont F. Leterme S. Boutry M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 769-780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Enrichment in the chloroplast fraction was low, but this has to be expected since chloroplast proteins of mesophyll cells represent up to 50% of total proteins and the highest enrichment can therefore be only 2-fold. In contrast, the majority of the mitochondrial marker was found in the crude organellar pellet and was enriched about 10-fold in the mitochondrial fraction. A certain amount of Rubisco was found in the mitochondria-enriched fraction. As discussed previously (26Silva-Filho M.de C. Chaumont F. Leterme S. Boutry M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 769-780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is not clear whether this stems from the presence of intact chloroplasts in the mitochondria-enriched fraction or from the binding to mitochondria of Rubisco released during grinding. Western blot (or enzyme activity, not shown) analysis of CAT in a TPT23-CAT plant shows that the reporter protein was addressed to chloroplasts since CAT and Rubisco enrichment in the chloroplast fraction was similar (Fig. 4 A). There was no enrichment in the mitochondrial fraction. As expected, the size of the mature CAT observed for TPT23-CAT in the chloroplast fraction (Fig. 4 B) was larger than that of a control cytosolic CAT without any targeting sequence. This difference accounts for the 23 residues of mature TPT and 6 residues from the linker region. Quantification of Western blot data from independent TPT23-CAT transgenic plants confirmed the presence of CAT within the chloroplast (Fig. 4 C). However, we observed that CAT enrichment in the crude organellar fraction was higher than enrichment of Rubisco in the same fraction, suggesting that the processed TPT23-CAT somehow binds to chloroplast membranes in vivo or after homogenization. To analyze this point, we centrifuged a chloroplast fraction on a self-generated Percoll gradient. As expected, two main green bands were obtained, corresponding to the intact chloroplasts (heavier band) and thykaloids (lighter band). This was confirmed by gel electrophoresis analysis (Fig. 5), showing in fraction 3, the heaviest green peak, the bands corresponding to the large subunit of Rubisco and the chlorophyll a/b-binding protein, the two major soluble and membrane chloroplast proteins, respectively. Fraction 7, the other green peak, still contains the chlorophylla/b-binding protein but not Rubisco, confirming that it corresponds to thykaloids. CAT was found to peak with intact chloroplasts (fraction 3), thykaloids (fraction 8), and a top fraction (11Flügge U.-I. Fisher K. Gross A. Sebald W. Lottspeich F. Eckerskorn C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) where bovine serum albumin (67 kDa) could be detected, thus corresponding to the soluble fraction. These observations therefore suggest that part of the CAT within the TPT23-CAT plant is in the chloroplast stroma, and part binds to the thykaloids. This was confirmed by showing the sensitivity of CAT to thermolysin in the thykaloid and soluble fractions but not in the intact chloroplast fraction (data not shown). For the TPT5-CAT plant, however, CAT remained essentially in the supernatant (Fig. 4, A and C). Little, if any, activity was found in the chloroplast or mitochondrial fractions. We therefore conclude that in vivo the TPT transit peptide together with 5 residues of the mature TPT is not sufficient to address CAT into chloroplasts. The size of CAT within the TPT5-CAT plant was found to be similar to that of control cytosolic CAT (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that TPT5-CAT was nevertheless processed in the cell by some kind of cytosolic proteolytic activity or, after homogenization, by a protease released from an organelle. Homogenization of the plant material in the presence of phenol gave similar results (data not shown), suggesting that processing probably occurs in vivo. To exclude any DNA rearrangement during A. tumefaciens or plant transformation which could have removed the TPT transit peptide initiation codon, we used polymerase chain reaction to retrieve a DNA fragment encompassing the NH2-terminal region of TPT5-CAT from a TPT5-CAT-transformed plant. We then checked by sequencing that the sequence was not modified. TPT is a chloroplast protein and has never been detected in mitochondria. Consistent with this is the observation that the TPT precursor is addressed to, and processed in, isolated chloroplasts (11Flügge U.-I. Fisher K. Gross A. Sebald W. Lottspeich F. Eckerskorn C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Recent reports (12Knight J.S. Gray J.C. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1421-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13Brink S. Fischer K. Klösgen R.-B. Flügge U.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20808-20815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) showed that the TPT transit peptide serves in vitro as a targeting signal to the chloroplast stroma. Here we showed that the TPT transit peptide is able to address a foreign protein to chloroplasts. The TPT precursor, however, is also imported in vitro into mitochondria isolated from yeast and plants, and this process has shown the typical features of specific protein import such as energy requirement and protease-sensitive binding of the precursor to the yeast MOM19 receptor (16Brink S. Flügge U.-I. Chaumont F. Boutry M. Emmermann M. Schmitz U. Becker K. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 (2nd Ed.): 16478-16485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data reported here with two precursors retaining the transit peptide and 5 or 23 residues of mature TPT delimit the sequence involved in in vitro mitochondrial targeting within a region spanning the 80 residues of the transit peptide and the 5 NH2-terminal residues of the mature TPT. This transport requires a membrane potential and external ATP. These observations strongly suggest that the mitochondrial import of the TPT-CAT precursors occurs via a normal import route. Examination of the primary structure of the TPT transit peptide from various sources suggests the presence of a putative positively charged amphiphilic α-helix (14Knight J.S. Gray J.C. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 586-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15Fischer K. Arbinger B. Kammarer B. Bush C. Brink S. Wallmeier H. Sauer N. Eckerskorn C. Flügge U.-I. Plant J. 1994; 5: 215-226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This feature has been shown to be important for membrane insertion and for the translocation of imported mitochondrial precursors (4von Heinje G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar) and could account for the TPT-CAT mitochondrial import. In both in vitro chloroplast and mitochondrial import, the apparent size of the mature TPT5-CAT and TPT23-CAT is compatible with processing of the precursors at the expected cleavage site. As suggested previously (16Brink S. Flügge U.-I. Chaumont F. Boutry M. Emmermann M. Schmitz U. Becker K. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 (2nd Ed.): 16478-16485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Silva-Filho M.de C. Chaumont F. Leterme S. Boutry M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 769-780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this implies that proteases recognizing the same target are present in both mitochondria and chloroplasts. A major conclusion of the data reported here is that the TPT transit peptide behaves differently in vitro and in vivo. In the latter case, indeed, the shortest construct (TPT5-CAT) remained in the cytosol. It could be argued that the targeting peptide of TPT5-CAT is degraded rapidly by a cytosolic protease, therefore preventing chloroplast import. This is, however, unlikely since it would imply that the additional 18 internal residues of TPT23-CAT confer protease resistance in the cytosol but not in the chloroplast. Another hypothesis would be that the NH2-terminal region of TPT5-CAT is engaged in the chloroplast import machinery, processed within the stroma, and, because of a failure of complete translocation, released back into the cytosol. This hypothesis, however, is not in agreement with the observation thatin vivo cleavage of TPT5-CAT does not occur at the expected site as observed after in vitro targeting (see Fig. 2) but probably at, or very close to, the CAT initiation codon (see Fig.4 B). Moreover, interfering sequences within the CAT reporter are unlikely to be present since this protein has been used previously as a passenger for either mitochondrial or chloroplast import (8Boutry M. Nagy F. Poulsen C. Aoyagi K. Chua N.H. Nature. 1987; 328: 340-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 26Silva-Filho M.de C. Chaumont F. Leterme S. Boutry M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 769-780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A more likely hypothesis would be that structural features required forin vivo mitochondrial or chloroplast uptake are missing in the TPT transit peptide. Failure of import could occur due to lack of interaction of the precursor either with specific chaperones involved in organellar targeting (28Komiya T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) or with receptors at the organelle outer membrane. The precursor would then be processed by a cytosolic protease. Cleavage of a chloroplast or mitochondrial targeting peptide of a chimeric protein which was not imported either has been observed before (26Silva-Filho M.de C. Chaumont F. Leterme S. Boutry M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 769-780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Zhou J. Bai Y. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16689-16693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). When the TPT transit peptide was followed by 23 residues of mature TPT, CAT was efficiently targeted in vivo to chloroplasts but not to mitochondria. Since CAT stably accumulates in mitochondria when linked to a truly mitochondrial presequence (8Boutry M. Nagy F. Poulsen C. Aoyagi K. Chua N.H. Nature. 1987; 328: 340-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), we can conclude thatin vivo the TPT transit peptide together with 23 residues of the mature protein does not constitute an in vivomitochondrial targeting sequence. This weakens the hypothesis that TPT would also be addressed in vivo to mitochondria and then destroyed rapidly. The requirement of sequences within the mature TPT for import is not unexpected in itself. Similarly, the transit peptide of the chlorophyll a/b-binding protein was unable to direct either CAT or the β-glucuronidase reporter protein into chloroplasts unless sequences of the mature protein (25Kavanagh T.A. Jefferson R.A. Bevan M.W. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1988; 215: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) or surrogate sequences (26Silva-Filho M.de C. Chaumont F. Leterme S. Boutry M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 769-780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were present. The similarity between TPT and the chlorophyll a/b-binding protein goes no further since the latter has a classical transit peptide and has been shown previously to be addressed under the same experimental conditionsin vitro to chloroplasts and not to mitochondria (19Chaumont F. O'Riordan V. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16856-16862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nature of the additional residues required for in vivochloroplast import is not clear. The amino-terminal part of the mature TPT is not well conserved in various species. We could thus hypothesize that secondary, instead of primary, structures might be involved. A last conclusion from this work is that, as far as sorting is concerned, caution is necessary when analyzing in vitroimport data. For instance, we found similar rates of in vitro mitochondrial import for TPT5-CAT or TPT23-CAT as for a construct linking CAT to a truly mitochondrial presequence, that of the mitochondrial ATPase β subunit, and yet in vivo the latter construct was imported efficiently into mitochondria (18Chaumont F. Silva-Filho M.de C. Thomas D. Leterme S. Boutry M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). What could the explanation be for the different observations in vivo and in vitro? Since in the latter case, the precursors are radioactively labeled, the number of precursor molecules that are targeted to mitochondria is probably small compared with the number of mitochondria present in the assay. On a quantitative basis, the process is probably not very efficient. In vivo, the targeting machinery is expected to be very efficient (to avoid the accumulation of precursors into the cytosol) and specific (to avoid mistargeting). Concerning this last point, it could be argued that thein vitro uptake experiments are not very stringent since there is no competition for various subcellular compartments. Performing in vitro import in the presence of both mitochondria and chloroplasts would address this point but would mean first finding conditions that are appropriate for both types of import.In vivo specificity might be achieved by the affinity of the various precursors for their respective receptors localized at the outer face of organelles. However, specificity might occur at an earlier step, since precursors may bind to cytosolic or membrane chaperones after, or even during, their translation (28Komiya T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 30Lithgow T. Hoj P.B. Hoogenraad N.J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 31Hachiya N. Mihara K. Suda K. Horst M. Schatz G. Lithgow T. Nature. 1995; 376: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In the framework of this hypothesis, our data suggest that in vivo binding to chaperones and/or to chloroplast receptors requires, in addition to the transit peptide, residues of the mature TPT protein.

https://openalex.org/W2074133165,"Many cytokines, hormones, and growth factors activate Janus kinases to tyrosine phosphorylate select members of the Stat transcription factors. For full transcriptional activation, Stat1 and Stat3 also require phosphorylation of a conserved serine residue within a mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation consensus site. On the other hand, two recently identified and highly homologous Stat5a and Stat5b proteins lack this putative mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation site. The present study set out to establish whether Stat5a and Stat5b are under the control of an interleukin-2 (IL2)-activated Stat5 serine kinase. We now report that IL2 stimulated marked phosphorylation of serine and tyrosine residues of both Stat5a and Stat5b in human T lymphocytes and in several IL2-responsive lymphocytic cell lines. No Stat5a/b phosphothreonine was detected. Phosphoamino acid analysis also revealed that Stat5a/b phosphotyrosine levels were maximized within 1–5 min of IL2 stimulation, whereas serine phosphorylation kinetics were slower. Interestingly, IL2-induced serine phosphorylation of Stat5a differed quantitatively and temporally from that of Stat5b with Stat5a serine phosphorylation leveling off after 10 min and the more pronounced Stat5b response continuing to rise for at least 60 min of IL2 stimulation. Furthermore, we identified two discrete domains of IL2 receptor β (IL2Rβ) that could independently restore the ability of a truncated IL2Rβ mutant to mediate Stat5a/b phosphorylation and DNA binding to the γ-activated site of the β-casein gene promoter. These observations demonstrated that there is no strict requirement for one particular IL2Rβ region for Stat5 phosphorylation. Finally, we established that the IL2-activated Stat5a/b serine kinase is insensitive to several selective inhibitors of known IL2-stimulated kinases including MEK1/MEK2 (PD98059), mTOR (rapamycin), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (wortmannin) as determined by phosphoamino acid and DNA binding analysis, thus suggesting that a yet-to-be-identified serine kinase mediates Stat5a/b activation.

Phosphoamino acid analysis also revealed that Stat5a/b phosphotyrosine levels were maximized within 1–5 min of IL2 stimulation, whereas serine phosphorylation kinetics were slower. Interestingly, IL2-induced serine phosphorylation of Stat5a differed quantitatively and temporally from that of Stat5b with Stat5a serine phosphorylation leveling off after 10 min and the more pronounced Stat5b response continuing to rise for at least 60 min of IL2 stimulation. Furthermore, we identified two discrete domains of IL2 receptor β (IL2Rβ) that could independently restore the ability of a truncated IL2Rβ mutant to mediate Stat5a/b phosphorylation and DNA binding to the γ-activated site of the β-casein gene promoter. These observations demonstrated that there is no strict requirement for one particular IL2Rβ region for Stat5 phosphorylation. Finally, we established that the IL2-activated Stat5a/b serine kinase is insensitive to several selective inhibitors of known IL2-stimulated kinases including MEK1/MEK2 (PD98059), mTOR (rapamycin), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (wortmannin) as determined by phosphoamino acid and DNA binding analysis, thus suggesting that a yet-to-be-identified serine kinase mediates Stat5a/b activation.

IL2-induced effects are mediated by heterodimerization of two related transmembrane proteins of the hematopoietin receptor family that are designated IL2 receptor β- and γ-chains (IL2Rβ and ILR2γ) (2Kondo M.

In addition to this pair of essential receptor subunits, a third non-conforming protein with a short cytoplasmic domain (TAC or IL2Rα) represents an accessory receptor subunit that can serve as a positive affinity modulator through its regulated expression (5Nikaido T.

IL2-induced dimerization of IL2Rβ and IL2Rγ results in stimulation of the receptor-associated Janus kinases (JAK) JAK1 and/or JAK3 through intermolecular transphosphorylation (8Russell S.M.

Cytokine. 1995; 7: 689-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Activation of JAKs initiates intracellular signaling cascades that include Src tyrosine kinases, phosphatases, serine-threonine kinases, and a family of transcription factors known as signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stats). Stats act in concert with other transcription factors to control cell growth and differentiation (10Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar,11Taniguchi T. Science. 1995; 268: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). At present, seven members of the Stat transcription factor family have been identified (10Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar, 12Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). Stat proteins are characterized by a central DNA-binding motif, a COOH-terminal transactivation domain, a Src homology (SH) domain 2, and an SH3-like domain (12Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). Current models hold that newly phosphorylated tyrosine residues within activated receptor complexes direct the recruitment of Stats from the cytoplasm via their SH2 domains (13Fu X.Y. Cell. 1992; 70: 323-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Subsequently, JAK enzymes catalyze Stat tyrosine phosphorylation, which facilitates dimerization and disengagement of Stats from the receptor complex. Serine phosphorylation of Stat1α and Stat3 was also recently reported to be critical for interferon-induced nuclear translocalization and maximal transcriptional activation (14Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). Serine-threonine kinases of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family were suggested to perform this function (14Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar, 15Zhang X. Belnis J. Li H.C. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). In support of this proposal, mutation of the serine residue of a conserved MAPK consensus phosphorylation site (X-Pro-X-Ser-Pro) (corresponding to Ser727 of human Stat1α) to alanine abolished interferon-γ- and interferon-α-induced serine phosphorylation of Stat1α and Stat3, respectively (15Zhang X. Belnis J. Li H.C. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Moreover, the MAPK ERK2 reportedly binds to the α-chain of the interferon-α/β receptor and coprecipitates with Stat1α in an interferon-β-inducible manner (16David M. Petricoin III, E. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). However, the involvement and significance of MAPKs as general Stat serine kinases are still controversial (17Ihle J.N. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast to Stat1 and Stat3, two more recently identified and highly homologous Stat5 proteins do not contain this conserved putative MAPK phosphorylation site (18Azam M. Erdjument-Bromage H.

Harada N. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1166-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Stat5 was originally identified as a prolactin-responsive mammary gland factor (20Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) but has since been found to be regulated by a variety of cytokines including IL2–5, IL7, IL9, IL13, IL15, thrombopoietin, erythropoietin, growth hormone, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (12Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar, 23Rolling C. Trenton D. Pelligrini S. Galanaud P. Richard Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Many of these factors also activate the Ras/MAPK pathway to regulate a number of cellular events including cell growth and differentiation as well as other physiological responses. However, the Ras/MAPK pathway does not appear to be crucial for IL2-induced cell proliferation or Stat5 activation (24Minami Y. Kono T. Yamada T. Kobayashi N. Kawahara A. Perlmutter R.M. Taniguchi T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 25Beadling C. Ng J. Babbage J.W. Cantrell D.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1902-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that Stat5a and Stat5b activities are regulated differently from other Stats and may not be inducibly phosphorylated on serine residues. Using IL2 (a potent activator of Stat5), the present study specifically set out to establish whether Stat5a and Stat5b are under the control of an IL2-activated Stat5 serine kinase. We now report that IL2 markedly induced phosphorylation of both Stat5a and Stat5b on serine and tyrosine but not on threonine residues in several target cell lines tested including normal human T lymphocytes. Moreover, we suggest that these phosphorylation events are mediated independently from several known IL2-activated signaling pathways. Polyclonal rabbit antisera were raised against peptides derived from the unique COOH termini of Stat5a and Stat5b as described previously (21Liu X.L. Robinson G.W. Hennighausen L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 10: 1496-1506Google Scholar) or from R & D Systems (catalog no. PA-ST5A or PA-ST5B). These antibodies recognized mouse, rat, and human forms of Stat5a or Stat5b and were used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. The rat T cell lymphoma cell line Nb2-11C or human T lymphocytes obtained from normal donors (26Wahl L.M. Katon I.M. Wilder R.L. Winter C. Haraoui B. Sher I. Wahl S.M. Cell. Immunol. 1984; 85: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma, catalog no. F 2442), 2 mm l-glutamine, 5 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.3, and penicillin/streptomycin (50 IU/ml and 50 μg/ml, respectively). The T lymphocytes were activated for 72 h with phytohemagglutinin (1 μg/ml) and were subsequently made quiescent by washing and incubating for 24 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing 1% fetal calf serum before exposure to cytokines. Nb2 cells were quieted for 24 h in the above medium except that 10% gelded horse serum was substituted for fetal calf serum. The IL3-dependent murine Ba/F3 cell clones expressing various IL2Rβ mutants were generated and cultured as described previously (27Howard O.M.Z. Kirken R.A. Garcia G.G. Hackett R.H. Farrar W.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 1,300 units/ml hygromycin B (Sigma, catalog no. H 3274) and 2% WEHI-3B supernatant as a source of IL3. Cells were stimulated with 100 nm recombinant human IL2 (Hoffmann-La Roche) at 37 °C as indicated in the corresponding figure legends. Cell pellets were frozen at −70 °C. Frozen cells were thawed on ice and solubilized in lysis buffer (108 cells/ml) containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 200 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin. Cell lysates were rotated end over end at 4 °C for 60 min, and insoluble material was pelleted at 12,000 × gfor 20 min. Depending on the experiment, supernatants were incubated by rotating end over end for 2 h at 4 °C with either Stat5a or Stat5b antibodies (5 μl/ml). Antibodies were captured by incubation for 30 min with protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Precipitated material was eluted by boiling in SDS-sample buffer for 4 min and was subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon, Millipore, catalog no. 1PVH 00010) as described previously (28Kirken R.A. Rui H. Malabarba M.G. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19136-19141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nb2-11C, phytohemagglutinin-activated human T lymphocytes, or Ba/F3 cells were metabolically labeled with 0.75 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (DuPont NEN) for 2 h at 37 °C and stimulated with 100 nm IL2 for up to 60 min. Cells used for kinase inhibitor experiments were pre-incubated for 1 h with either Me2SO as a mock control, 100 μmPD98059 (New England Biolabs, Inc., catalog no. 9900L), 10 nm rapamycin (Calbiochem, catalog no. 553210-Q), or 100 nm wortmannin (Calbiochem, catalog no. 681675-Q). After treatment with IL2 (see figure legends for times), cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated as described above. Proteins were eluted from protein A-Sepharose beads, separated on SDS-PAGE (7.5% polyacrylamide), and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography and analyzed by phosphoamino acid analysis as described previously (29Rui H. Kirken R.A. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5364-5368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Labeled Stat5a and Stat5b proteins were excised from polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and exposed to limited hydrolysis in 6n HCl at 110 °C for 90 min. Samples were then dried, resuspended in water with phosphoamino acid standards, and spotted onto a thin layer cellulose acetate gel. One-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis was performed at 1500 V for 40 min in buffer containing pyridine:acetic acid:water at a 10:100:1890 ratio. Standards were visualized with ninhydrin, and samples were analyzed by autoradiography. Densitometric quantitation of individual phosphoamino acids were performed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager:SF. Counts/min volumes were normalized against the background and plotted as arbitrary units. Ba/F3 cell clones expressing various IL2Rβ mutants and treated as described were pelleted by centrifugation and immediately solubilized in EMSA lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm orthovanadate, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin. Lysates were incubated on ice for 20 min and clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. For the EMSA (30Wilson K.C. Finbloom D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11964-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), 1 μg of32P-labeled oligonucleotide corresponding to the β-casein gene sequence (5′-AGATTTCTAGGAATTCAATCC-3′) were generated by end labeling and incubated with 10 μg of protein from cellular lysates in 30 μl of binding mixture (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 25 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50% glycerol) at room temperature for 20 min, and samples were pre-incubated with 1 μl of either normal rabbit serum or antisera specific to Stat5a or Stat5b transcription factors as indicated. Polyacrylamide gels (5%) containing 5% glycerol and 0.25 × Tris borate/EDTA were pre-run in 0.25 × Tris borate/EDTA buffer at 4–10 °C for 1.5 h at 270 V. After loading of samples, the gels were run at room temperature for approximately 3 h at 250 V. Gels were dried by heating under vacuum conditions and exposed to x-ray film (X-Omat, Kodak). To establish whether Stat5a and Stat5b are under control of an IL2-activated serine kinase, the phosphorylation status of Stat5a and Stat5b was first analyzed in activated human T lymphocytes and the rat Nb2 lymphoma cell line. Cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and incubated with or without IL2 for 10 min (Fig. 1). Stat5a and Stat5b were individually immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, lower panel). This was followed by phosphoamino acid analysis after acid hydrolysis of the isolated Stat5a and Stat5b proteins (Fig. 1, upper panel). As seen in Fig. 1, IL2 stimulated incorporation of phosphate into Stat5a and Stat5b in either cell type, and the accompanying phosphoamino acid analysis specifically established that both Stat5a and Stat5b were inducibly phosphorylated on serine and tyrosine but not on threonine residues (Fig. 1, upper panel). This was also the case in the human natural killer cell line YT (data not shown) and the mouse pro-B cell line Ba/F3 that had been stably transfected with human IL2Rβ (see Fig. 3). We therefore conclude that Stat5a and Stat5b are under the control of an IL2-activated serine kinase. Furthermore, similar results were obtained when the same cells (Nb2 and T lymphocytes) were stimulated with either IL7 or IL9 (data not shown) thus suggesting that combined tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of Stat5a and Stat5b represents a general mechanism of cytokine regulation.Figure 1IL2-induced serine and tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5a and Stat5b in human T lymphocytes and in the rat Nb2-11C cell line. Phytohemagglutinin-activated human T lymphocytes or Nb2-11C cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and stimulated with (+) or without (−) 100 nm IL2 for 10 min.

The full-length (FL) receptor was not modified, the AD mutant had an internal deletion corresponding to amino acids Gln315-Pro384, and the BD mutant was truncated at the amino acid position Leu385. The inactive mutant SD, which is truncated at Gln314 (27Howard O.M.Z. Kirken R.A. Garcia G.G. Hackett R.H. Farrar W.L. Biochem.

Cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and were then stimulated with IL2 for up to 60 min. Cell pellets were lysed and immunoprecipitated with antibodies to either Stat5a or Stat5b. SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 2 A, lower panel) showed that IL2 stimulated general phosphorylation of Stat5a (lanes a–f) and Stat5b (lanes g–l) within 1 min. Whereas incorporation of phosphate into Stat5a reached maximal levels within 10 min, Stat5b continued to incorporate phosphate during the entire 60-min period (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). This difference in IL2-induced phosphorylation of Stat5a and Stat5b could be resolved further by phosphoamino acid analysis. The corresponding analysis of individual phosphoamino acids is shown in the upper panel of Fig. 2 A. First, the results demonstrated that IL2 induced rapid serine and tyrosine phosphorylation of both proteins. In contrast, no threonine phosphorylation of Stat5a or Stat5b was detected over the entire time course. The isotope incorporated into serine and tyrosine residues was quantitated by PhosphorImager:SF analysis, and the results are plotted as line diagrams in Fig. 2 B. The incorporation of phosphate into tyrosine residues of Stat5a and Stat5b was rapid and reached maximal levels within 1–5 min. In contrast, incorporation of phosphate into serine residues was more protracted and differed kinetically between Stat5a and Stat5b. Whereas serine phosphorylation of Stat5a reached a plateau after 10 min, Stat5b phosphoserine continued to accumulate over the entire 60-min period. The continued increase in total Stat5b phosphate content beyond 10 min (Fig. 2 A, lower panel) could be ascribed to increasing levels of phosphoserine (Fig. 2, A and B). The data shown in Fig. 2 are also representative of a series of experiments that suggest that the extent of IL2-induced incorporation of phosphate into Stat5b is higher than that of Stat5a in activated human T lymphocytes. Parallel immunoblot analysis showed that the levels of Stat5a and Stat5b proteins in activated human T lymphocytes were comparable (not shown). A similar preferential induction of phosphorylation of Stat5b by IL2 was seen in Nb2 pre-T lymphoma cells (Fig. 1, lanes e–h), the human natural killer cell line YT (not shown), and the mouse pro-B cell line Ba/F3 (Fig.3 B). Further studies are needed to determine if this differential phosphorylation of Stat5a and Stat5b by IL2 is due to preferential selectivity of IL2 receptor complexes for Stat5b or whether Stat5b contains more phosphorylated serine residues. JAK3 and JAK1 are presumed to be the IL2-activated Stat5 tyrosine kinases. The temporal relationship between IL2-induced phosphorylation of Stat5a and Stat5b on tyrosine versus serine residues with rapid tyrosine phosphorylation and more protracted serine phosphorylation kinetics is consistent with an activation of JAK3/JAK1 before activation of the Stat5 serine kinase. However, serine and tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5 molecules may occur independently. Since we previously had established that the COOH-terminal region of IL2Rβ was not required for JAK3 activation, we next investigated whether this domain was required for activation of the Stat5a/b serine kinase. We stably introduced a series of IL2Rβ variants into the murine IL3-dependent lymphoblastoma line Ba/F3 (27Howard O.M.Z. Kirken R.A. Garcia G.G. Hackett R.H. Farrar W.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The structures of wild-type (FL) IL2Rβ and mutants AD and BD are reviewed in Fig. 3 A. Previous analysis had shown that Ba/F3 cells expressing wild-type (FL) receptors or mutant receptor forms devoid of either the acid-rich region (AD) or the COOH terminus (BD) were capable of mediating IL2-induced proliferation and Jak3 activation (9Kirken R.A.

Farrar W.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Stable cell clones expressing these forms of IL2Rβ were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and incubated with or without IL2 for 10 min. The cells were then lysed, and Stat5a or Stat5b were immunoprecipitated with appropriate antibodies. Analysis of immunoprecipitated Stat5 proteins by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3 B,lower panel) showed that IL2-induced Stat5a/b phosphorylation was mediated by FL (lanes a–d), AD (lanes e–h), and BD (lanes i–l) forms of IL2Rβ. On the other hand, a mutant of IL2Rβ (designated SD) that lacks both the acid-rich region and the COOH terminus failed to mediate inducible phosphorylation of Stat5a or Stat5b (not shown). We have previously demonstrated that the SD mutant does not mediate JAK1/JAK3 activation or proliferative signals (9Kirken R.A. Rui H. Malabarba M.G. Howard O.M.Z. Kawamura M. O'Shea J.J. Farrar W.L. Cytokine. 1995; 7: 689-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 27Howard O.M.Z. Kirken R.A. Garcia G.G. Hackett R.H. Farrar W.L. Biochem.

Specific phosphoamino acid analysis of inducibly phosphorylated Stat5a and Stat5b proteins from IL2-stimulated Ba/F3 cells expressing either FL, AD, or BD receptors revealed that each of these biologically active receptor variants were correspondingly competent to mediate IL2-induced serine and tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B, upper panel). The present observation that BD is capable of mediating Stat5a/b phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B, lanes i–l) is consistent with the previously proposed roles of Tyr392 and Tyr510 of IL2Rβ as essential Stat5 docking sites (9Kirken R.A.

To define the specificity of the signal transduction by the LIF/OSM receptor (a heterodimer of gp130 and LIF receptor (LIFR)) and the OSM-specific receptor (a heterodimer of gp130 and OSM receptor (OSMR)), we reconstituted the receptor function by transfection into receptor-negative Hep3B hepatoma cells. Both receptors activate DNA binding activity of STAT1, -3, and -5B and induce gene transcription through IL-6-responsive elements. The signaling-competent cytoplasmic domain regions of OSMR and LIFR were defined by the analysis of progressive carboxyl-terminal deletion constructs. The 36 residue carboxyl-terminal region containing the distal box 3 sequence motif of OSMR is required for signal transduction by the OSM-specific receptor. In contrast, signaling by LIFR did not display the same requirement for receptor domains and was not strictly dependent on the box 3 elements. The signaling by endogenous LIF and OSM receptors differed from that by IL-6R by the prominent activation of STAT5 as shown in the mouse hepatoma cell line, Hepa-1. The data suggest that the signaling specificity of the receptors for the three cytokines is determined by the composition of the cytoplasmic domains associated in the signal-competent receptor complex and that the signaling is not identical among these cytokine receptors. Oncostatin M (OSM), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) induce expression of a similar set of acute phase plasma protein genes in hepatic cells.

The data suggest that the signaling specificity of the receptors for the three cytokines is determined by the composition of the cytoplasmic domains associated in the signal-competent receptor complex and that the signaling is not identical among these cytokine receptors. Members of the hematopoietin receptor gene family are categorized based on similarities in their receptor-protein structure, ability to bind the same cytokines, and use of common subunits for assembly into a signal-competent receptor complex (1Cosman D.

Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The current model of receptor action proposes that signal initiation requires minimally a dimerization of signal transducing cytoplasmic domains. IL-6 initiates formation of a signaling receptor complex by binding to a low affinity, ligand binding subunit (IL-6R). A signaling complex is then formed by recruitment and homodimerization of two gp130 molecules, resulting in a proposed hexameric structure that consists of two molecules each of IL-6, IL-6R, and gp130 (4Ward L.D.

While IL-11 bound to the ligand-specific IL-11 receptor is proposed to also initiate homodimerization of gp130, other members of the IL-6-type cytokines initiate heterodimerization between gp130 and other signaling-competent receptor subunits. LIF, OSM, CNTF, and CT-1 all transduce signaling events through heterodimerization of gp130 and LIFR (first characterized as the low affinity LIF receptor; Ref. 6Gearing D.P. Comeau M.R. Friend D.J. Gimpel S.D. Thut C.J. McGourty J. Brasher K.K. King J.A. Gillis S. Mosley B. Ziegler S.F. Cosman D. Science. 1992; 255: 1434-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). While CNTF and possibly CT-1 (7Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Stahl N. Pan L. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Ip N.Y. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1993; 260: 1805-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 8Stahl N.

This complex has been described as the LIF/OSM receptor or the type I OSM receptor (6Gearing D.P. Comeau M.R. Friend D.J. Gimpel S.D. Thut C.J. McGourty J. Brasher K.K. King J.A. Gillis S. Mosley B.

Chem. 1994; 269: 6215-6222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally a second OSM-specific receptor complex has been identified, consisting of gp130 heterodimerized with an OSM-specific second subunit, OSMR (or OSMRβ), which form the type II OSM receptor (9Thoma B. Bird T.A. Friend D.J. Gearing D.P. Dower S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6215-6222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Mosley B. De Imus C. Friend D. Boiani N. Thoma B. Park L.S. Cosman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32635-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The essential role of gp130 for signaling by these receptors is demonstrated by the fact that antibodies to gp130 are capable of neutralizing the cell responses to all IL-6-type cytokines (11Liu J. Modrell B. Aruffo A. Marken J.S. Taga T. Yasukawa K. Murakami M. Kishimoto T. Shoyab M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16763-16766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The characterization of a battery of anti-gp130 monoclonal antibodies has also revealed that the various ligand binding (or α-) subunits do not interact at identical sites on gp130 (12Chevalier S. Fourcin M. Robledo O. Wijdenes J. Pouplard-Barthelaix A. Gascan H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14764-14772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The signal transduction by IL-6-type cytokine receptors involves activation of the JAK/STAT pathway and, depending upon the cell type, pathways linked to Src- and Btk-related kinases (3Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hirano T. Matsuda T. Nakajima K. Stem Cells. 1994; 12: 262-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The hallmark of gp130-dependent signaling is the activation of STAT3 and STAT1 through recruitment by binding to box 3 sequences in the cytoplasmic domain of gp130 (14Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 15Gerhartz C. Heesel B. Sasse J. Hemmann U. Landgraf C. Schneider-Mergener J. Horn F. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12991-12998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In reconstitution experiments that utilize G-CSFR·gp130 chimeric constructs, the capability of gp130 to activate STAT5 is also detected (16Lai C.-F. Ripperger J. Morella K.K. Wang Y. Gearing D.P. Horseman N.D. Campos S.P. Fey G.H. Baumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23254-23257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The similarity of IL-6, LIF, and OSM action extends beyond the activation of DNA binding activity of STATs and has been recognized by the transcriptional induction of similar sets of genes in particular cell types. The induction of type 2 acute phase plasma proteins in hepatic cells describes best the redundancy of action of IL-6-type cytokines (17Baumann H. Prowse K.R. Marinkovic S. Won K.-A. Jahreis G.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 557: 280-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Despite the high degree of similarity in regulation, quantitative differences in the response to LIF, OSM, and IL-6 have been noted (18Baumann H. Marinkovic-Pajovic S. Won K.-A. Jones V.E. Campos S.P. Jahreis G.P. Morella K.K. Ciba Found. Symp. 1992; 167: 100-124PubMed Google Scholar,19Richards C.D. Brown T.J. Shoyab M. Baumann H. Gauldie J. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1731-1736PubMed Google Scholar). The seemingly equivalent action of IL-6-type cytokines has led to the generally accepted notion that the gp130-dependent receptors execute essentially the same signaling functions (3Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess whether this similarity in action also includes the signaling by the recently cloned type II OSM-specific receptor, OSMR, we evaluated its ability to activate STAT proteins and APP gene elements by reconstitution. We compared this signaling with that mediated by LIF and IL-6. Analysis of functional domains within the cytoplasmic regions of OSMR and LIFR was facilitated by the use of G-CSF receptor chimeric molecules. G-CSF, a related cytokine, has been predicted to form a signaling receptor complex by homodimerization of two G-CSFR molecules (20Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Nagata S. Cell. 1993; 74: 1079-1087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Utilizing chimeric molecules with the G-CSFR extracellular domain and OSMR or LIFR transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions allows signal transduction events initiated following G-CSF-mediated receptor homodimerization (21Ziegler S.F. Bird T.A. Morella K.K. Mosley B. Gearing D.P. Baumann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2384-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 22Baumann H. Symes A.J. Comeau M.R. Morella K.K. Wang Y. Friend D. Ziegler S.F. Fink J.S. Gearing D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 138-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we describe that OSMR does signal like LIFR, although the functional elements within the cytoplasmic domain of OSMR differ substantially from those of LIFR and gp130. Moreover, we show that the mechanism of signaling of OSMR and LIFR differs when signaling is carried out by heteromeric or homomeric cytoplasmic receptor domains. One distinguishing feature in the signaling of OSM and LIF from that of IL-6 is the more prominent activation of STAT5. COS-1, human Hep3B, and HepG2 cells (23Knowles B.B. Howe C.C. Aden D.P. Science. 1980; 209: 497-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar) were maintained in minimal essential medium. Rat H-35 cells (clone T-7-18; Ref. 17Baumann H. Prowse K.R. Marinkovic S.

Biol. 1973; 35: 83-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The media contained 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Cytokine treatments were carried out in serum-free minimal medium that included 100 ng/ml purified human IL-6 (Genetics Institute), LIF, OSM, or G-CSF (Immunex Corp.). For optimal activation of CAT reporter and endogenous APP genes, 1 μmdexamethasone was also added to the medium. To identify the role of gp130 in OSM signaling, cells were incubated in serum-free medium with the following monoclonal antibodies to human gp130 (10 μg/ml): K5 and S1, which inhibit only OSMR activity, and 144, which blocks the action of all IL-6-type cytokines (Ref. 12Chevalier S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14764-14772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar; antibodies generously provided by H. Gascan, Angers, France). After 30 min, the cytokines were added and treatments continued for 24 h. Expression vectors for full-length and progressive carboxyl-terminal truncations of human OSMR, LIFR, and the G-CSFR·OSMR and G-CSFR·LIFR chimeras are illustrated in Fig. 1. The expression vector containing OSMR sequences (Fig. 1 A) was pDC409 (26Giri J.G. Kumaki S. Ahdieh M. Friend D.J. Loomis A. Shanebeck K. DuBose R. Cosman D. Park L.S. Anderson D.M.

A series of truncated cytoplasmic domains was generated using PCR with 3′-oligonucleotides designed to incorporate in-frame termination codons followed by the recognition sequence for NotI. The G-CSFR·OSMR chimera expression vector was generated from the previously described expression vector pDC302 containing the extracellular domain of G-CSFR (residues 1–601) (21Ziegler S.F. Bird T.A.

Similarly, a series of chimeric receptors encoding truncated cytoplasmic OSMR domains was generated using PCR with the same 3′-oligonucleotides as used above for truncated OSMR. All sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression vectors for the human gp130 and series of LIFR and G-CSFR·LIFR as shown in Fig. 1B in pDC302 (6Gearing D.P. Comeau M.R. Friend D.J.

Biol. 1988; 8: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) have been described. Hep3B, COS-1, and H-35 cells were transfected with DEAE-dextran (31Lopata M.A. Cleveland D.W. Sollner-Webb H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5707-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) using a final concentration of 5 μg/ml plasmid (Hep3B and COS-1 cells) or 10 μg/ml (H-35 cells). To determine STAT activation by receptors, Hep3B and COS-1 cells were transfected with expression vectors for the receptors (2 μg/ml), and STAT isoforms (3 μg/ml), or empty vector yielding final DNA concentrations of 5 μg/ml. The transfected cells were cultured for 36 h, then maintained for an additional 16 h in serum-free medium before a 15-min cytokine treatment. One fifth of the washed and collected cells was solubilized by boiling in SDS buffer and used for Western analysis. The remainder of the cells was used to prepare whole cell extracts for electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) (32Sadowski H . B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1993; 261: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). For determining CAT gene regulation, Hep3B cells were transfected with CAT reporter constructs (3.5 μg/ml), receptor expression vector (0.5 μg/ml), and pIE-MUP (1 μg/ml), whereas H-35 cells received the same combinations but at double concentrations. HepG2 cells were transfected with calcium phosphate (33Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar) using a total concentration of 20 μg/ml DNA. The mixture contained 15 μg/ml CAT reporter construct, 1 μg/ml receptor expression vector, and 2 μg/ml pIE-MUP. The transfected cultures were subdivided and after a 24-h recovery period were treated for 24 h with cytokines. CAT activity was determined in serially diluted cell extracts to ensure measurement in the linear range of the assay. The values were normalized to major urinary proteins produced by the co-transfected marker plasmid pIE-MUP and calculated relative to the control culture in each experimental series (defined as 1.0). The results of individual experimental series are reproduced in the figures and are representative examples of at least three independently performed experiments. Whole cell extracts containing 5 μg of proteins were applied to EMSA as described (32Sadowski H . B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z.

Mol. Biol. Med. 1991; 8: 267-285PubMed Google Scholar) as substrate for STAT5 and as low affinity substrate for homodimer STAT1 and STAT1·STAT3 heterodimers (6Gearing D.P. Comeau M.R. Friend D.J.

The contribution of STAT3 and STAT5 to the gel patterns was identified by supershift using polyclonal rabbit anti-STAT5B (C17; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) that reacts with both STAT5A and STAT5B, anti-STAT5A (C20; Santa Cruz Technology) that reacts specifically to STAT5A isoform, and mouse anti-STAT3 (C20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Aliquots of cell lysate (30 μg of protein) were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon P membrane (Millipore) and reacted with rabbit serum raised against the hematopoietin domain of human OSMR (Ref. 10Mosley B. De Imus C. Friend D. Boiani N.

The immune complex was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (Amersham). Human OSM and human G-CSF were labeled with 125I-IODOGEN (Pierce) to a specific activity of 67.7 and 54.4 μCi/μg, respectively. To determine surface expression of OSMR, Hep3B cells were transfected with the expression vector (2.5 μg/ml) for human gp130 (10Mosley B. De Imus C. Friend D. Boiani N. Thoma B. Park L.S. Cosman D.

The cultures were subdivided into six-well cluster plates. After 24 h of recovery, the cells were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in binding medium (minimal essential medium containing 25 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, and 1% bovine serum albumin) and increasing concentrations of 125I-OSM. The cells were washed four times with binding buffer and twice with phosphate-buffered saline. After solubilization of the cells with 0.1% SDS in 0.1% NaOH, the cell-associated radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. G-CSF binding to transiently transfected cell cultures was determined by a single point binding assay using 0.5 nm125I-G-CSF alone or in the presence of 100-fold excess of cold G-CSF (Amgen, Inc.). The amount of competitive G-CSF binding (expressed in fmol bound/1 × 106 cells) was used as a measure for cell surface G-CSFR activity. Mock-transfected cells served as control, for which no specific G-CSF binding was detected. OSMR at the cell surface were quantitated by probing with anti-OSMR. Hep3B cells were transfected with OSMR expression vectors or empty expression vectors (= control). After 36 h of recovery, the cells in six-well cluster plates were blocked by incubation with binding medium containing non-immune goat IgG (100 μg/ml) for 2 h at 4 °C. The cells were then reacted with rabbit anti-OSMR (1:100 dilution) for 1 h at 4 °C. After exhaustive washing with binding medium, the cells were treated for 1 h at 4 °C with 0.1 μg/ml 125I-goat anti-rabbit IgG (16.1 μCi/μg; ICN). The radioactivity associated with the washed cells was measured by scintillation counting. To recover surface-exposed OSMR, transfected Hep3B cells, in 6-cm diameter dishes, were treated with rabbit anti-OSMR serum. The washed cells were lysed in 1 ml of 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate on ice for 10 min. The lysates was cleared by centrifugation and reacted with 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose. The bound proteins were eluted with SDS buffer, separated on SDS mini-gels, and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-OSMR. To identify whether the cloned full-length OSMR could initiate signaling, we selected Hep3B cells as an experimental system for receptor reconstitution. Hep3B cells, unlike any other hepatoma cell line, do not respond to LIF or OSM, yet have retained normal IL-6 responsiveness (Fig. 2 A), indicating a lack of LIFR and OSMR while maintaining a functional gp130 and productive signal transduction mechanism (10Mosley B.

Hep3B cells do not produce OSM; thus, we expected that introduction of OSMR should not encounter any autocrine effect as observed with LIFR (22Baumann H. Symes A.J. Comeau M.R. Morella K.K. Wang Y.

Transfection of the full-length OSMR into Hep3B cells and treatment with OSM did not yield detectable activation of endogenous STATs (Fig.2 A). Considering that the transfection protocol yielded approximately 2–5% of transfected cells in the culture, as judged from expression of the co-transfected lacZ gene (data not shown), we assumed that the amount of STAT proteins available for activation by OSMR in these cells was below the detection of the EMSA. Therefore, we determined the signaling capability of OSMR by providing, through co-transfection, excess amounts of the individual STAT proteins known to be activated by gp130. Under these conditions, full-length OSMR mediated a ligand-dependent activation of the DNA binding activity of STAT1, -3, and -5B (Fig. 2 B,OSMR(218)). To determine the functional relevance of the cytoplasmic domain elements box 1, 2, and 3, we introduced OSMR with progressive carboxyl-terminal truncation as shown in Fig.1 A. Removal of two box 3 sequences in OSMR(142) drastically reduced all STAT activation and with truncation beyond 105, STAT activation was no longer detectable. Western blot analysis indicated that the lower signaling activity was not due to reduced expression of the truncated OSMR (Fig. 3 A,left panel). In fact, full-length OSMR was expressed at a much lower level than any of the truncated forms, suggesting a high specific signaling activity of the full-length OSMR. The surface display of OSMR was verified by two measurements. In the first measurement, 125I-OSM binding to transfected Hep3B cells was determined (Fig. 3 B). Since OSMR does not function as a ligand binding subunit, but serves as an affinity converter for the low affinity OSM binding to gp130 (10Mosley B. De Imus C. Friend D. Boiani N. Thoma B. Park L.S. Cosman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32635-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), the reconstitution of OSMR function by the transient transfection approach is only recognizable qualitatively by the recovery of high affinity OSM binding. OSMR(218), OSMR(142), and OSMR(6), although not expressed at equal amounts on the cell surface as determined by antibody tagging and Western blotting (Fig. 3 B, inset), contributed to a comparable fraction of high affinity OSM binding activity that was not observed in the vector control cultures. This result suggested that each of the transfected OSMR forms functionally interacted with gp130. The second measurement quantitated OSMR on the cell surface by antibody binding (Fig. 3 C). The values obtained by this approach were in good agreement with the relative levels of expression detected by Western blotting of whole cell lysates (Fig. 3 A, left panel). Since the OSMR signaling observed in Fig. 2 B was attributed, in part, to the action of gp130, we determined whether the OSMR cytoplasmic domain could signal independently of gp130. To test this, we prepared chimeric receptors consisting of the extracellular domain of human G-CSFR linked to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of OSMR (Fig. 1 A). Transfection of Hep3B cells with G-CSFR·OSMR(218) carrying the full-length cytoplasmic OSMR domain mediated an activation of STAT1, -3, and -5B essentially the same as seen with OSMR(218) (Fig. 2 B, center panel). Progressive truncation of cytoplasmic domains, however, did not yield the same abrupt loss of signaling capacity as with the OSMR. The cytoplasmic domain with 60 residues was sufficient for maintaining substantial STAT activation. The Western blot analysis revealed that the various chimeric receptor forms were expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 3 A, right panel), and125I-G-CSF binding demonstrated proportional surface display of G-CSFR activities (Fig. 3 D). From these results, we concluded that OSMR is a signal-transducing subunit with a STAT specificity similar to gp130. However, since the OSMR cytoplasmic region between 60 and 142 is capable of activating STATs in a G-CSFR-directed homodimeric form but is much less efficient in a heterodimer form with gp130, the mechanism by which OSMR transduced the intracellular signal appears dependent on the specific combination of cytoplasmic domains. Since LIFR showed highest sequence similarity with OSMR (1"

In the case of the α-tropomyosin (α-TM) gene, exon 2a rather than exon 2b is specifically spliced in α-TM-SM mRNA, which is one of the major tropomyosin isoforms in smooth muscle cells. Here we demonstrate that expressions of α-tropomyosin and caldesmon isoforms are coordinately regulated in association with phenotypic modulation of smooth muscle cells. Molecular cloning and Western and Northern blottings have revealed that in addition to the down-regulation of β-TM-SM, α-TM-SM converted to α-TM-F1 and α-TM-F2 by a selectional change from exon 2a to exon 2b during dedifferentiation of smooth muscle cells in culture. Simultaneously, a change of caldesmon isoforms from high M r type to low M r type was also observed by alternative selection between exons 3b and 4 in the caldesmon gene during this process. In contrast, cultured smooth muscle cells maintaining a differentiated phenotype continued to express α-TM-SM, β-TM-SM, and high M r caldesmon. In situhybridization revealed specific coexpression of α-TM-SM and highM r caldesmon in smooth muscle in developing embryos. These results suggest a common splicing mechanism for phenotype-dependent expression of tropomyosin and caldesmon isoforms in both visceral and vascular smooth muscle cells.

The SMCs are derived from mesodermal precursors, but the intracellular and extracellular factors determining the SMC lineage and its phenotype remain unclear.

Tropomyosin (TM) is a predominant helical protein that binds to actin groves. Recent evidence suggests that Ca2+-dependent actin-myosin interaction in smooth and nonmuscle cells is controlled by myosin- and actin-linked dual regulation. In this regulation, the TM and CaD are involved as actin-linked regulators (23Sobue K. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12115-12118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Huber P.A.

Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Also, it has been proposed that both proteins are essential for the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton mediated by stabilization of microfilaments (26Ishikawa R. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7490-7497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Warren K.S. Lin J.L. McDermott J.P. Lin J.J. J.

Therefore, TM, in addition to CaD, plays a vital role in motile events. One- and two-dimensional gel electrophoreses revealed multiple TM isoforms associated with morphological changes and tumorigenic transformation (29Matsumura F. Lin J.C. Yamashiro-Matsumura S.

Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 692-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). cDNA and genomic DNA analyses have also shown a diversity of TM mRNAs generating from the limited TM genes by a combination of differential promoter usage and alternative splicing (reviewed in Ref. 32Lees Miller J.P. Helfman D.M. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Of these, some of the TM isoforms accumulate in a tissue-specific manner. It has been demonstrated that the chicken and rat β-TM genes generate multiple transcripts. A pair of internal exons (exons 6a and 6b) are spliced in a mutually exclusive manner, and their utilization is regulated during differentiation of skeletal muscle cells; exons 6a and 6b are used in myoblasts and myotubes, respectively (33Helfman D.M. Cheley S. Kuismanen E. Finn L.A. Yamawaki Kataoka Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 1986; 6: 3582-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 34Libri D. Lemonnier M. Meinnel T. Fiszman M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2935-2944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of the α-TM genes, exon 2b rather than exon 2a (termed exons 3 and 2, respectively, in Ref. 35Wieczorek D.F. Smith C.W. Nadal-Ginard B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 679-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) is spliced in the high M r α-TM mRNAs in all cell types except for SMCs (35Wieczorek D.F. Smith C.W. Nadal-Ginard B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 679-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 36Lemonnier M. Balvay L. Mouly V. Libri D. Fiszman M.Y. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 107: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); exon 2a is specifically selected in SMCs. The selection of exon 2a is therefore considered to be an SMC-specific event. The splicing mechanism of the α-TM genes has been also studied (37Mullen M.P. Smith C.W. Patton J.G. Nadal-Ginard B. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 642-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 38Gooding C. Roberts G.C. Moreau G. Nadal-Ginard B. Smith C.W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3861-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar); however, there are no reports regarding isoform interconversion of TM in association with phenotypic modulation of SMCs. Here we have been the first to demonstrate expressional change of TM isoforms depending upon SMC phenotype. During dedifferentiation of SMCs in primary culture, the SMC-type α-TM (α-TM-SM) converted to fibroblast-type 1 and 2 α-TM isoforms (α-TM-F1 and α-TM-F2) by a selectional change from exon 2a to exon 2b, while expression of SMC-type β-TM (β-TM-SM) was down-regulated. Under culture conditions in which differentiated SMCs were caused to dedifferentiate by serum or platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), expressional change of CaD from high M r (h-CaD) to lowM r form (l-CaD) was coincident with that of TM. In contrast, expression of α-TM-SM and h-CaD was maintained in differentiated SMCs cultured on laminin-coated dishes without serum.In situ hybridization revealed coexpression of α-TM-SM and h-CaD mRNAs in smooth muscle in developing embryos. The present results, therefore, suggest that the α-TM and CaD genes are coordinately regulated in a SMC phenotype-dependent manner. We further discuss the molecular mechanism of such gene expressions including transcription and splicing during phenotypic modulation of SMCs. We prepared SMCs from 15-day-old chick embryo gizzards. Briefly, gizzard muscles were carefully separated from serosa and tunica mucosa, minced with scissors, and incubated at 30 °C for 60 min in 1 mg/ml collagenase (type V, Sigma) solution containing 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 4 mmNaHCO3, 2 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm d-glucose, 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.5, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma) with gently shaking. Finally, the dispersed cells were plated onto culture dishes (see below) in a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/cm2 and were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 atmosphere. To promote dedifferentiation of SMCs, isolated SMCs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) on plastic culture dishes. We used SMCs cultured under these conditions for more than 1 week as dedifferentiated SMCs. To maintain the differentiated phenotype, SMCs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 5 μg/ml insulin on laminin-coated dishes. We prepared vascular SMCs from chicken aortae by explant methods (30Hendricks M. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1823-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To isolate explant-derived SMCs, the aortic media was minced into 1–2-mm segments and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS. The cells were routinely passaged at a 1:3 ratio. We used three-passaged cells as dedifferentiated vascular SMCs. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed according to the previously described method (39O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 9.5 m urea, 2% Triton X-100, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol by sonication. The concentration of ampholyte (pH 4.0–6.0) was adjusted to 2%, and then the samples were separated by isoelectric focusing. First dimensional gel was composed of 9.2 m urea, 4% acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 2% Triton X-100 and 2% ampholyte (pH 4.0–6.0). Isoelectric focusing was first conducted at 500 V for 10 min, followed by at 750 V for 3.5 h and then at 1000 V for 2 h. The second dimension was SDS-PAGE with 17.5% acrylamide. Separated proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and were detected by the ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Corp.) using specific antibodies. TM311, anti-chicken gizzard TM monoclonal antibody (mAb), was purchased from Sigma. Anti-CaD polyclonal antibodies were prepared as described elsewhere (3Ueki N. Sobue K. Kanda K. Hada T. Higashino K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 9049-9053Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We also used polyclonal TM antibodies against chicken gizzard TMs (40Tanaka J. Watanabe T. Nakamura N. Sobue K. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 595-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in this study. The SMCs were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 μg/ml leupeptin and 0.1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate. The cells were pelleted by brief centrifugation and then sonicated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 10 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. The lysates were boiled for 5 min, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants thus obtained were subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation between 28 and 36%. The pellets were suspended in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT and dialyzed against the same buffer whose pH was lowered to 4.7 by the addition of HCl. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min, the pellets were resuspended in and dialyzed against 20 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mmEGTA. The dialysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 30 min. All manipulations described above were carried out at 4 °C. The clarified dialysates (crude TM fractions) were used for actin-binding assays. The crude TM fractions were incubated with rabbit skeletal muscle actin at 37 °C for 30 min. The buffer conditions were as follows: 20 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 5 mm MgCl2. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, the sedimented actin and its associated proteins were dissolved in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis buffer and subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. cDNA libraries of SMCs and of dedifferentiated SMCs were constructed in λgt11. The libraries were screened using TM311 mAb. Alternatively, we amplified partial cDNA fragments carrying α-TM exons 3, 4, and 5 or β-TM exons 3, 4, and 5 by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. These cDNA fragments were also used as probes for screening of the cDNA libraries. Cloned cDNAs were sequenced. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) and truncated TM fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli and purified by glutathione-Sepharose using the GST Gene Fusion System (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Each of the truncated cDNAs carrying exon 1a of α-TM, exons 2b to 9d (containing the 3′-noncoding region) of α-TM, exon 1a of β-TM, exons 2 to 9d (containing the 3′-noncoding region) of β-TM, or exons 1b to 6b of α-TM, was fused to the GST gene in the pGEX-3X vector. Immunological reactivities of TM311 mAb against fusion proteins were examined by Western blotting. We constructed expression vectors carrying each of the cDNAs for TM isoforms downstream of the chicken β-actin promoter (pAct-vector). Expression vectors were transfected into dedifferentiated SMCs as described elsewhere (12Yano H. Hayashi K. Momiyama T. Saga H. Haruna M. Sobue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23661-23666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and the cell lysates were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and Western blotting with TM311 mAb as described above. Expression of α-SM actin in differentiated and dedifferentiated SMCs and chick embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) was examined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy as described previously (40Tanaka J. Watanabe T. Nakamura N. Sobue K. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 595-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, fixed and permeabilized cells were incubated with anti-α-SM actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and then were double-stained with both fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody and rhodamine-phalloidin. Total cellular RNAs were isolated from SMCs using the ISOGEN (Nippongene). Ten μg of total RNAs at the indicated culture days were separated on 1.0% agarose-formaldehyde gels and then transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond-N+, Amersham). The membranes were hybridized with respective TM and CaD isoform-specific DNA probes under the conditions listed in TableI. After removal of the hybridized probes, the membranes were reused. To visualize 28 S rRNAs, membranes were stained with 0.02% methylene blue.Table IConditions of Northern blottingProbesNucleotide positions (GenBank™ accession No.)LabelingHybridization buffer/temperatureWashing buffer/temperatureα-TM/E2a128–147 of α-TM-SM (D87893)[γ-32P]ATP1-aAntisense oligo-DNA was phosphorylated by [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara).HB-A1-bcDNA fragment was amplified by PCR, and antisense strand DNA was labeled by [α-32P]dCTP using BcaBEST DNA polymerase (Takara)./48 °CWB-A1-cHB-A consists of 6 × SSC (20 × SSC consists of 100 mm NaCl and 100 mm trisodium citrate dihydrate), 0.5% SDS, 1 mg/ml polyvinylpyrrolidone, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 100 μg/ml herring sperm DNA./52 °Cα-TM/E2b264–283 of α-TM-F1 (D87891)[γ-32P]ATPHB-A/52 °CWB-A/52 °Cβ-TM/E1a-E228–263 of β-TM-SM (K02446)[α-32P]dCTP1-dHB-B consists of HB-A plus 50% formamide.HB-B1-eWB-A consists of 6 × SSC and 0.1% SDS./42 °CWB-B1-fWB-B consists of 2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS./42 °CCaD/E3b811–932 of h-CaD (M28417)[α-32P]dCTPHB-B/42 °CWB-B/42 °CCaD/E3a-E5757–776 of l-CaD (M59762)[γ-32P]ATPHB-A/52 °CWB-A/52 °C1-a Antisense oligo-DNA was phosphorylated by [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara).1-b cDNA fragment was amplified by PCR, and antisense strand DNA was labeled by [α-32P]dCTP using BcaBEST DNA polymerase (Takara).1-c HB-A consists of 6 × SSC (20 × SSC consists of 100 mm NaCl and 100 mm trisodium citrate dihydrate), 0.5% SDS, 1 mg/ml polyvinylpyrrolidone, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 100 μg/ml herring sperm DNA.1-d HB-B consists of HB-A plus 50% formamide.1-e WB-A consists of 6 × SSC and 0.1% SDS.1-f WB-B consists of 2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS.

Cycle numbers are given in Table II. PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gels and were stained with SYBR Green I (FMC). Intensity of stained bands were relatively quantified by a FluorImager (Molecular Dynamics). To eliminate changes of transcriptional activities of α-TM and CaD promoters and differences in efficiency of amplification of each PCR product, the relative contents of each mRNA were estimated by multiregression analysis based on the equation, [common] =c A·[exon A] +c B·[exon B] + error. [common], [exon A], and [exon B] represent the intensity of each PCR product of α-TM-common (or CaD-common), α-TM-exon2a (or h-CaD), and α-TM-exon2b (or l-CaD) that was amplified using total RNAs from the indicated culture of SMCs. c A andc B represent regression coefficients for each TM (or CaD) isoform. Regression coefficients were calculated using the computer program StatView 4.0 (Abacus Concepts). Finally, the relative content of each mRNA, [exon A]′ or [exon B]′, was calculated as follows: [exon A]′ = cA·[exon A]/(cA·[exon A] + cB·[exon B]); [exon B]′ = cB·[exon B]/(cA·[exon A] + cB·[exon B]).Table IIPCR primer setsPrimer sets5′-Primer2-aNucleotide positions and GenBank™ accession numbers (in parentheses) are shown below each primer.3′-Primer2-aNucleotide positions and GenBank™ accession numbers (in parentheses) are shown below each primer.Cycle numberα-TM-exon 2a5′-TTCCCTGCTCTGATTTCGGC-3′5′-GAAGAGGAGGCTGTCCTCAG-3′24 24 –43 of α-TM-F1 (D87891) 202 –221 of α-TM-SM (D87893)α-TM-exon 2b5′-TTCCCTGCTCTGATTTCGGC-3′5′-GTGCATCTTTAAGGGACTCG-3′24 24 –43 of α-TM-F1 (D87891) 264 –283 of α-TM-F1 (D87891)α-TM-common5′-GTAGCTTCCCTGAACAGACG-3′5′-GATAGTTCAGCACGCTCCTC-3′24 334 –353 of α-TM-F1 (D87891) 619 –638 of α-TM-F1 (D87891)h-CaD5′-TTGTTGGAGAGACTGGCAAGACGG-3′5′-CTTTAGCCTCTTTGTCTTCC-3′24 478 –501 of h-CaD (M28417) 1473 –1492 of h-CaD (M28417)l-CaD5′-TTGTTGGAGAGACTGGCAAGACGG-3′5′-TGTCTTTTACCTGATTTTCC-3′27 434 –457 of l-CaD (M59762) 757 –776 of l-CaD (M59762)CaD-common5′-TTGTTGGAGAGACTGGCAAGACGG-3′5′-CTGATTTTCCTCTGTGGGTA-3′22 478 –501 of h-CaD (M28417) 791 –810 of h-CaD (M28417)2-a Nucleotide positions and GenBank™ accession numbers (in parentheses) are shown below each primer.

The sections were mounted on polylysine-coated glass slides and stored at −20 °C.

Open table in a new tab It is well known that primary cultured SMCs under serum-stimulated conditions convert from a differentiated to dedifferentiated state. We examined the isoform changes of TM in primary cultured gizzard SMCs. Western blotting of precultured SMCs on two-dimensional gels with an anti-chicken gizzard TM monoclonal antibody, TM311 mAb, revealed two major spots (spots a andc in Fig. 1 I, A). In 3-day cultured cells under serum-stimulated conditions, new spots (spots 1 and 2) were detected with a more acidic isoelectoric point and faster migration than spots a andc, whereas the latter became faint (Fig. 1 I,B). The relative staining intensities of spots 1and 2 gradually increased in 7-day cultured cells in accordance with the decreases in spots a and c(Fig. 1 I, C). During this process, the intensity of spot a reduced faster than that of spot c. In two passaged cells, spots 1 and 2 were the only TM isoforms detected by TM311 mAb (Fig. 1 I,D). In this study, we used TM311 mAb as one of anti-TM antibodies. Although the epitope of TM311 mAb has not been characterized, several reports have suggested it to be the antibody cross-reacting with high-M r TM isoforms (40Tanaka J. Watanabe T. Nakamura N.

To identify the epitope, we constructed bacterial expression plasmids carrying fusion proteins between GST and truncated α- or β-TM isoforms; exon 1a of α-TM; exons 2b, 3, 4, 5, 6b, 7, 8, and 9d of α-TM; exon 1a of β-TM; exons 2, 3, 4, 5, 6a, 7, 8, and 9d of β-TM; and exons 1b, 3, 4, 5, and 6b of α-TM.

https://openalex.org/W2079286074,"Eps15 is a member of an emerging family of proteins containing a novel protein/protein interaction domain, the EH domain, of as yet unknown function. Recent findings of Eps15 association with clathrin adaptor complex AP-2 and its localization in clathrin-coated pits have implicated Eps15 in the regulation of vesicle trafficking. Here we show that Eps15 exists in several multimeric states in vivo. When purified recombinant Eps15 or lysates of NIH 3T3 cells were treated with cross-linking reagents, covalent dimers of Eps15 and larger covalent multimers were detected in high yield. Large Eps15 oligomers co-immunoprecipitated with AP-2 at an efficiency higher than that of Eps15 dimers. Furthermore, cross-linking of the membrane-bound fraction of Eps15 in mildly permeabilized cells was as efficient as that of the cytosolic fraction. Size-exclusion column chromatography of recombinantly produced Eps15 and of total cell lysates was performed to examine the equilibrium ratio of the monomersversus the aggregated forms of Eps15. These experiments showed that essentially all the Eps15 was aggregated, whereas monomers of Eps15 could be obtained only under strong denaturing conditions. To map the region of Eps15 responsible for dimerization, fusion proteins corresponding to the three structural domains of Eps15 were prepared. Cross-linking analysis revealed that the central portion of Eps15, which possesses a coiled-coil region (residues 321–520), serves as the interacting interface. The possibility that hetero-oligomeric complexes of Eps15 dimers and AP-2 function during the recruitment of proteins into coated pits is discussed.

The possibility that hetero-oligomeric complexes of Eps15 dimers and AP-2 function during the recruitment of proteins into coated pits is discussed. The Eps15 protein was originally discovered as a phosphorylation substrate of the epidermal growth factor receptor kinase (1Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5814-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies revealed that Eps15 is constitutively associated with the plasma membrane clathrin adaptor protein complex AP-2 (2Benmerah A. Gagnon J. Begue B. Megarbane B. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Immunomorphological analysis demonstrated that membrane-bound Eps15 is mainly associated with the plasma membrane clathrin-coated pits and vesicles (3Tebar F. Sorkina T. Sorkin A. Ericsson M. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28727-28730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Moreover, Eps15 is distributed asymmetrically within the coat, mostly at the rim of the pits and at the neck of the budding vesicles. All these findings suggested that Eps15 might play a role in clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Further evidence suggesting a role for Eps15 in protein trafficking comes from the analysis of the primary structure of Eps15 and its homology to other proteins. The predicted amino acid sequence of Eps15 identifies at least three structural domains (1Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5814-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 4Wong W.T. Schumacher C. Salcini A.E. Romano A. Castagnino P. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9530-9534Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal region is composed of three relatively conserved repeats of ∼70 amino acids referred to as EH domains (for Eps15homology). The central domain of Eps15 presents the characteristic heptad repeats of coiled-coil proteins. The carboxyl-terminal domain displays several Asp-Pro-Phe (DPF) 1The abbreviations used are: DPF, Asp-Pro-Phe; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CMF-PBS, Ca2+,Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline. repeats, proline-rich sequences capable of interacting with SH3 domains (5Schumacher C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15341-15347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and the binding site for the α-subunit of AP-2 (6Benmerah A. Begue B. Dautry-Varsat A.

Carpenter G. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Keen J.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 240-245PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, an EH domain is found in End3p, a protein required for endocytosis of α-factor pheromone in yeast cells (8Benedetti H.S. Paths F. Crausaz F. Riesman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1023-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent report demonstrated that another EH domain-containing protein, PAN-1, is essential for endocytosis in yeast (9Wendland B. McCaffery J.M. Xiao Q. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1485-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Finally, a partial sequence has been recently obtained for a mammalian EH domain-containing protein that is associated with the γ-subunit of the Golgi clathrin adaptor complex AP-1 and is located in the trans-Golgi network (10Robinson M.S. Page L.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7 (abstr.): 977Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, EH domains might serve a general role in the functioning of the coats operating along different pathways of protein trafficking. The major components of the clathrin coat, clathrin and AP complexes, are hetero-oligomers (reviewed in Refs. 11Keen J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar and 12Schmid S.L. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the multimeric state of Eps15, a novel component of clathrin-coated pits. Using chemical cross-linking and size-fractionation techniques, we show that Eps15 is constitutively oligomerized and that the central domain of this protein, containing a coiled-coil region, is involved in intermolecular homotypical interactions. The polyclonal antibodies to Eps15 (Ab577) and to β-subunits of AP-2 (Ab32) have been described elsewhere (1Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5814-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 13Sorkin A. McKinsey T. Shih W. Kirchhausen T. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 619-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The water-soluble cross-linking reagent bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) was purchased from Pierce. All other chemicals were from Sigma, Fisher, or Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Eps15 protein was produced as follows.Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS bacteria cultures expressing pGEX2T-GST-Eps15 cDNA containing the entire open reading frame of Eps15 (residues 2–897) (1Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5814-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) were grown in the presence of 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranosidase for 2 h at 30 °C. Bacteria were lysed by freeze-thaw in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 25% sucrose, pH 8, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Tween 20, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 554 μm iodoacetamide, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The GST-Eps15 fusion protein was immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and eluted by cleavage with thrombin as described previously (1Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5814-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). However, the efficiency of Eps15 binding to the beads was low. Therefore, to obtain large amounts of Eps15, the GST-Eps15 fusion protein was partially purified by gel filtration on a Superose 6HR FPLC column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl. Because GST-Eps15 elutes as a molecule with a very high molecular mass (see “Results”), fractions between the 8th and 11th ml from loading the sample (immediately following the void volume) were collected. GST-Eps15 was the major protein in these fractions as assayed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Coomassie Blue gel staining. Mouse NIH 3T3 cells expressing ∼4 × 105 human wild-type epidermal growth factor receptors/cell were derived by single-cell cloning of pCO11 cells (14Velu T.J. Beguinot L. Vass W.C. Zhang K. Pastan I. Lowy D.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 39: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% newborn calf serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Cells were grown in 100-mm dishes (Costar Corp.) and used for experiments when confluent. The GST-Eps15 fusion protein was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in Ca2+,Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (CMF-PBS) before or after cleavage of the GST domain with thrombin. Thrombin digestion of Eps15 purified by gel filtration was carried out by incubating 50 μg of fusion protein with 0.9 μg of thrombin (660 units/mg) in 100 μl of CMF-PBS containing 2.5 mm CaCl2 for 90 min at room temperature and was terminated by adding 25 mm EDTA. 5-μg aliquots of dialyzed Eps15 protein (final protein concentration of 50 μg/ml) were incubated with 1.0–17.5 mm freshly dissolved BS3 for 30 min at 4 °C. To stop the cross-linking reaction, 250 mm glycine (final concentration) was added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 10 min. In control experiments, the unrelated proteins β-amylase, bovine serum albumin, and alcohol dehydrogenase (gel-filtration molecular mass markers, Sigma; final concentration of 50 μg/ml) were incubated with 4.6 mm BS3 for 45 min at 4 °C; quenched with glycine; and processed for SDS-PAGE. The proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue gel staining. For cross-linking of cellular Eps15, NIH 3T3 cells were washed three times with ice-cold CMF-PBS and solubilized in TGH buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 544 μm iodoacetamide, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) by scraping the cells from the dish with a rubber policeman followed by gentle rotation for 10 min at 4 °C. This procedure allows solubilization of ∼90% of the total cellular Eps15 and AP-2. Lysates were then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with BS3(3 mm), followed by quenching with 250 mmglycine for 10 min at 4 °C. Samples of cell lysates or recombinant Eps15 obtained before or after the cross-linking procedure were separated by SDS-PAGE on 3–10 or 3–7% linear gradient gels. In some experiments, cross-linked lysates of NIH 3T3 cells were incubated with antibodies specific to Eps15 (Ab577) or to β-subunits of AP complexes (Ab32) to immunoprecipitate Eps15 or AP complexes, respectively, as described previously (3Tebar F. Sorkina T. Sorkin A. Ericsson M. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28727-28730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). After transfer of proteins from the gel to nitrocellulose membrane, Eps15 was immunodetected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) using a polyclonal serum to Eps15 (Ab577) and protein A (Zymed Laboratories, Inc.) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The α- and β-subunits of AP-2 were probed with AC1-M11 (15Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and Ab31 and Ab32 (13Sorkin A. McKinsey T. Shih W. Kirchhausen T. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 619-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To perform cross-linking of membrane-bound and cytosolic fractions of Eps15, NIH 3T3 cells were mildly permeabilized by incubation in CMF-PBS containing 0.02% saponin, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors for 30 min at 4 °C. The saponin extract, containing most of the cytosolic components, was collected, and the permeabilized cells were washed with CMF-PBS to remove residual cytosol. To cross-link membrane proteins, permeabilized cells were scraped away from the dish with a rubber policeman in CMF-PBS containing 1 mmBS3, followed by gentle rotation for 30 min at 4 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of glycine (250 mm), and the permeabilized cells were centrifuged at 16,000 ×g and solubilized in TGH buffer. In parallel, the saponin extract (cytosolic fraction) was incubated with the cross-linker at the same concentration and under the same conditions. The TGH lysates and the saponin fractions were centrifuged at 16,000 × gfor 10 min, and the supernatants were electrophoresed as described above for experiments with whole lysates. Eps15 was detected by Western blotting with Ab577. 300 μl of NIH 3T3 cell lysates (∼1 mg of protein) or partially purified GST-Eps15 fusion protein cleaved with thrombin (∼0.2 mg of protein) were cross-linked with BS3or mock-treated as described above. Samples were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and applied to a Superose 6 column connected to an FPLC system (Pharmacia). Duplicate samples were denatured in 8 m urea, 1% SDS, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol at 95 °C for 5 min prior to gel filtration. Native and denatured samples were run under identical conditions. The column was equilibrated with 1% Triton X-100 and 50 mmHepes, pH 7.4, and run at 4 °C with a 0.2- or 0.1-ml/min flow rate, and fractions (0.4 or 0.2 ml, correspondingly) were collected every 2 min. The fractions were electrophoresed, and Eps15 was detected by Western blotting (see above). The amount of Eps15 protein was quantitated by densitometry. Molecular mass markers for gel filtration were from Sigma or Pharmacia. The GST-Eps15 fusion proteins were obtained by recombinant polymerase chain reaction of the appropriate fragments from the Eps15 cDNA, followed by cloning in the pGEX2T expression vector in frame with the GST moiety. GST-EH, GST-COIL, and GST-DPF were engineered to contain the three structural domains of Eps15 encompassing amino acid residues 2–330, 321–520, and 501–874, respectively. 2Sequences of the primers utilized for the constructions are available upon request. Purification of the fusion proteins on glutathione-agarose beads and thrombin cleavage of agarose-immobilized GST fusion polypeptides have been previously described (1Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5814-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). BS3 cross-linking experiments were performed on GST fusion proteins (either before or after thrombin cleavage) in CMF-PBS using 5 μg of fusion proteins (final concentration of 0.1 μg/μl) and BS3 (1 mm) for 10 min at room temperature, followed by quenching with 50 mm glycine for 15 min at room temperature. The samples were electrophoresed, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize cross-linking products. To test the oligomeric state of Eps15, chemical cross-linking analysis of the bacterially expressed GST-Eps15 fusion protein and of detergent lysates of NIH 3T3 cells was performed. Prior to analysis, the fusion protein was cleaved with thrombin to remove the GST moiety, which is capable of homodimerization (16Partridge C.A. Singh S.V. Hong T.D. Theodore C. Dao D.D. Awasthi Y.C. Int. J. Biochem. 1985; 17: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Full-length recombinant Eps15 was then incubated with the water-soluble heterobifunctional cross-linker BS3. As seen in Fig.1, immunodetection of Eps15 after cross-linking and electrophoresis revealed a strong band of high molecular mass (∼300 kDa), presumably Eps15 dimers, whereas the monomeric form (145 kDa) was undetectable. With increased concentration of BS3 (Fig.1 A) or with prolonged reaction times (data not shown), larger covalent aggregates were formed. Under similar conditions, cross-linking of unrelated proteins (β-amylase (Fig. 1 B) and bovine serum albumin and alcohol dehydrogenase (data not shown)) did not yield covalent oligomers (Fig. 1 B), illustrating the selectivity of Eps15 cross-linking.Figure 1Chemical cross-linking of recombinantly produced Eps15. A, GST-Eps15 (50 μg/ml) was cleaved (+) or not (−) with thrombin and incubated or mock-treated with 0.3–10.0 mg/ml BS3. Monomeric and oligomeric forms of Eps15 were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 3–10% gradient gel and detected by immunoblotting. Arrows show the positions of monomeric (M), dimeric (D), and, presumably, tetrameric (T) forms of Eps15. B, β-amylase (final concentration of 50 μg/ml) was incubated or mock-treated with 2.5 mg/ml BS3 for 45 min at 4 °C and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue gel staining. Note that cross-linking leads to a change in the mobility of β-amylase, but does not yield any oligomeric products.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cross-linked Eps15 migrated on SDS-PAGE as a smear, probably due to intramolecular cross-linking. Because no reliable high molecular mass marker is available, it was difficult to determine the precise molecular mass of the large Eps15 oligomers that could represent trimers or tetramers of Eps15. However, in the course of the reaction, all monomers were first trapped in dimerized forms (Fig. 1). Therefore, it is likely that the high molecular mass band (indicated withT in Fig. 1) corresponds to the secondary product of cross-linking of two dimers, i.e. tetramers. We will henceforth refer to the large cross-linked species of Eps15 as tetramers to simplify the description of the results. The treatment of whole lysates of NIH 3T3 cells with BS3resulted in the redistribution of all immunoreactive Eps15 from the monomeric to the high molecular mass forms (Fig. 2). From this analysis, it is impossible to establish whether the anti-Eps15 immunoreactive high molecular mass forms represent homodimers/oligomers (i.e. containing only Eps15) or heterocomplexes with other cellular proteins. However, the two major bands (indicated with D and T in cross-linked lysates) comigrated with the cross-linked dimers and tetramers of bacterially expressed Eps15 (Fig. 2), thus suggesting that they are composed of homodimers/oligomers, at least in part. In addition, a cross-linking product of ∼260 kDa, and thus smaller than the dimer of recombinant Eps15, was detected in cell lysates. The identity of this anti-Eps15 immunoreative product is not clear, although it is possible that this band represents a dimer of a 130-kDa species of unclear origin (1Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5814-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) that is specifically recognized by the anti-Eps15 antibody (Fig. 2 A). Neither epidermal growth factor, which is capable of triggering the tyrosine phosphorylation of Eps15 in vivo(1Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5814-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), nor Ca2+ ions, which possibly bind to the EH domain (4Wong W.T. Schumacher C. Salcini A.E. Romano A. Castagnino P. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9530-9534Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), were able to alter the efficiency of dimerization as assessed by the formation of cross-linking products (data not shown). Previous studies showed that a sizable pool of Eps15 is co-immunoprecipitated with AP-2 (2Benmerah A. Gagnon J. Begue B. Megarbane B. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 3Tebar F. Sorkina T. Sorkin A. Ericsson M. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28727-28730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and that direct interaction occurs between Eps15 and the α-chain of AP-2 (6Benmerah A. Begue B. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12111-12116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 7Iannolo G. Salcini A.E. Gaidarov I. Goodman Jr., O.B. Baulida J. Carpenter G. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Keen J.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 240-245PubMed Google Scholar). However, immunoblotting with AC1-M11 or Ab31 antibodies, specific to the amino- or carboxyl-terminal domains of α-subunits, respectively, could not detect any of Eps15-containing products (data not shown). This observation suggests that the cross-linked products of Eps15 do not contain clathrin adaptors. Apparently, there are no free amino groups accessible for intermolecular Eps15/AP-2 cross-linking with BS3 within the interaction domains of the carboxyl termini of Eps15 and the α-subunit. On the other hand, tightly associated subunits of AP-2 are readily intercross-linkable (Ref. 17Virshup D.M. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar and data not shown). Under the conditions of our cross-linking experiments, the bulk of AP-2 complexes form large covalent aggregates that do not enter 3% gels. Because the amount of Eps15 immunoreactivity detected by Western blotting in the BS3-treated and untreated lysates was comparable, it is unlikely that any significant amount of Eps15 was covalently bound to these large AP-2 aggregates. Furthermore, the efficiency of Eps15 cross-linking was not affected by the presence of 1m NaCl, a condition known to disrupt Eps15/AP-2 interaction (data not shown). Therefore, oligomerization of Eps15 does not depend on the association of Eps15 with AP-2. When cross-linked lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody specific to AP-2 (Ab32), Eps15 was detected in immunoprecipitates (Fig.2 A). This result suggested that cross-linking did not destruct the interaction of Eps15 and the α-subunit of AP-2. Interestingly, more Eps15-reactive tetramers than dimers (ratio of immunoreactivity of ∼3:1) were coprecipitated. Analysis of immunoprecipitated supernatants showed that all tetramers of Eps15 were coprecipitated with AP-2, whereas a pool of dimers remained in the supernatants (data not shown). In contrast, the tetramer/dimer ratio was similar (∼1:1.5 in Fig. 2 A) in cross-linked cell lysates and Eps15 immunoprecipitates. It is therefore possible that very large complexes containing two Eps15 dimers and up to four AP-2 complexes exist in the cell. In addition, these complexes might include clathrin, which can be also detected in Eps15 immunoprecipitates (6Benmerah A. Begue B. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12111-12116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Clathrin does not, however, directly bind to Eps15 and apparently coprecipitates with Eps15 via AP-2 (7Iannolo G. Salcini A.E. Gaidarov I. Goodman Jr., O.B. Baulida J. Carpenter G. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Keen J.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 240-245PubMed Google Scholar). The localization of Eps15 in coated pits and vesicles and its putative role in endocytosis prompted the question of whether Eps15 is dimerized in coated pits and can be efficiently cross-linked in a membrane-bound state. To test this, cross-linking was performed in cells that were mildly permeabilized with saponin. This permeabilization removes the cytosol while preserving the clathrin coats (3Tebar F. Sorkina T. Sorkin A. Ericsson M. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28727-28730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and allowing the BS3 access to membrane-bound Eps15. Incubation of the permeabilized cells (membrane fraction of Eps15) and the saponin extracts (cytosolic fraction of Eps15) with BS3 produced covalent dimers and tetramers of Eps15 (Fig. 2 B), thus establishing the involvement of Eps15 in the homotypical intermolecular interactions in coated pits and in the cytosol. Effective cross-linking of Eps15 is an indicator of its oligomerization. However, such a technique does not allow for estimation of the equilibrium ratio of the monomeric and oligomeric forms of Eps15. Therefore, gel-filtration chromatography of recombinant and cellular Eps15 was performed. When recombinant Eps15 was run through a Superose 6 column, the peak of immunoreactivity eluted at the volume corresponding to the globular proteins with a molecular mass of ∼1–2 × 103 kDa, with a maximum at 1.3–1.4 × 103 kDa (Fig.3 A). The large hydrodynamic radius of Eps15 in solution is indicative of a substantial aggregation of the protein. A similar elution volume was observed for the peak of Eps15 when total lysates of NIH 3T3 cells were fractionated under the same conditions (Fig. 3 B). This peak may contain either homo-oligomers of Eps15 or its heteroaggregates with other proteins, for instance, AP-2. The similarities in the elution profiles of recombinant Eps15 and Eps15 from cell lysates argue that most of Eps15 in cell lysates is present as stable homo-oligomers, whereas Eps15·AP-2 complexes are not stable under conditions of high pressure gel filtration on Superose 6. The presence of a pool of these complexes in the fractions containing Eps15 cannot, however, be ruled out because AP-2 immunoreactivity is detectable in these fractions (data not shown). The main peak of AP-2 eluted in the void volume, which is consistent with significant aggregation of AP-2 in the TGH lysates. To determine the apparent elution volume of monomeric Eps15, recombinant Eps15 or cell lysates were denatured to disrupt protein/protein interactions by heating in the presence of SDS and urea as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The denatured samples were then gel-filtrated under conditions identical to those employed for the native samples. Both recombinant and cellular Eps15, under denaturing condition, eluted as peaks with maximum immunoreactivity at ∼670 kDa (Fig. 3, A and B). The relative positions of the peaks of native and denatured Eps15 did not change in the presence of 1 m NaCl and 0.2% SDS or in the absence of detergent (data not shown). Thus, the data of gel-filtration experiments are consistent with the stable aggregation of the entire pool of Eps15 under native conditions. An ∼2-fold difference in the elution volumes of the monomers and the aggregated forms of Eps15 suggests that most of the aggregates represent dimers of Eps15. However, it is technically difficult to determine the Stokes radius of proteins with an apparent size of >1 × 106 Da under these conditions because the resolution of the gel-filtration column within this range is poor. As seen in Fig. 3, the left shoulder of the peak of native Eps15 was not as sharp as would be expected for the elution profile of a homogeneous protein. This could be due to the presence of homo- and heteroaggregates of Eps15 larger than Eps15 dimers. We verified the elution position of Eps15 dimers and tetramers by size fractionation of cross-linked Eps15. Samples of the lysates of NIH 3T3 cells containing cross-linked Eps15 (dimers and tetramers) and non-cross-linked Eps15 (monomers) were denatured to produce a mixture of these three forms. Fig. 4 shows that the maximum of the peak of covalent tetramers eluted two fractions earlier than that of dimers. Essentially similar elution patterns were observed when cross-linked recombinant Eps15 was subjected to gel filtration after denaturation (data not shown). Peaks of cross-linked dimers and tetramers (Fig. 4) overlapped with the peak of non-cross-linked Eps15 (Fig. 3), suggesting that Eps15 exists as dimers and tetramers in cell lysates. To determine the region of Eps15 responsible for intermolecular interactions, several GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli. The first polypeptide corresponded to the region of Eps15 encompassing the three EH domains (EH; Fig. 5); the second fusion protein (COIL) contained the central part of the molecule, which has heptad repeats with predicted coiled-coil structure; and the third polypeptide (DPF) encompassed the carboxyl-terminal region, which bears DPF motifs and the AP-2-binding domain (4Wong W.T. Schumacher C. Salcini A.E. Romano A. Castagnino P. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9530-9534Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 6Benmerah A. Begue B. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12111-12116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In addition, a GST fusion protein encompassing the entire Eps15 open reading frame (full-length) was used. In an initial set of experiments, we attempted to show interaction of native Eps15, present in cell lysates, with agarose-immobilized GST fusion polypeptides. No specific interactions could be detected, even when full-length Eps15 was used (data not shown), and the reaction was brought to a theoretical saturation, as for example, by performingin vitro binding for 24 h at 4 °C. This result contrasted the readily detectable dimerization/oligomerization of native Eps15 (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4) and raised the possibility that lack of in vitro interaction could be due to the pre-existing dimerized/oligomerized state of Eps15 in vivo. To circumvent this problem, we immunoprecipitated Eps15 from cell lysates and performed far-Western blotting on the specific immunoprecipitates with the various GST fusion fragments of Eps15. Under these conditions, one would expect Eps15 to be present as monomer in a denatured state. Again, no specific interaction of Eps15 fragments with full-length Eps15 immobilized on the nitrocellulose membrane could be detected (data not shown). We reasoned that if a domain of Eps15 is involved in dimerization/oligomerization of the full-length protein, this domain might well be present already as a dimer/oligomer when expressed by itself in bacteria. Detection of such a dimeric/oligomeric state could therefore provide indirect proof of the role of that domain in determining dimerization/oligomerization of full-length Eps15in vivo. To test this possibility, the purified EH, COIL, and DPF domains were subjected to in vitro cross-linking. We performed cross-linking of the domains either in their GST-fused configuration (as a control) or after purification following cleavage from the GST moiety with thrombin. Fig. 5 shows that all fusion proteins could be cross-linked into dimerized forms if the GST domain was present, due to dimerization of the GST moiety. However, cross-linking of the EH and DPF domains after GST cleavage did not change their migration position on SDS-PAGE, indicating the absence of dimerization. In contrast, the COIL polypeptide was effectively trapped into dimerized forms by the cross-linker in the absence of the GST domain. These results suggest that the COIL domain is responsible for stable association of Eps15 monomers and may serve as an interacting interface for the formation of homodimers in the Eps15 molecules. We have employed two different approaches to demonstrate the constitutive oligomerization of Eps15 in vivo and in vitro. Cross-linking analysis showed that Eps15 monomers were barely detectable following a short incubation of purified Eps15, cell lysates, or permeabilized cells with relatively low concentrations of BS3. This is an indication of an effective cross-linking reaction. It is to be noted that the rate-limiting step in this type of reaction is the interaction of the BS3-linked monomer with another monomer (18Staros J.V. Acc. Chem. Res. 1988; 21: 435-441Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The rate of the reaction is thus directly proportional to the proximity of two monomers and is very slow when determined by random encounters (18Staros J.V. Acc. Chem. Res. 1988; 21: 435-441Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Given the very low concentrations of Eps15 in cell lysates, in permeabilized cells (<10−7m), and in the in vitro cross-linking (<10−6m), our experiments strongly argue for the presence of pre-existing dimers. This notion is supported by the data from gel-filtration analysis. The apparent size of native Eps15 was two times bigger than that of the denatured protein, indicative of the absence of monomeric forms and of the constitutive multimeric status of Eps15 in solution. The observation that denatured Eps15 elutes as a molecule with an abnormally high molecular mass, compared with globular proteins of similar molecular mass, suggests that Eps15 is an asymmetric protein. The central domain of Eps15, which serves as a dimerization interface for Eps15 dimerization, displays sequence homology to the rod region of myosin heavy chain, suggesting that Eps15 may be a rod-like protein. Interestingly, Eps15 displays an abnormal mobility on SDS-PAGE as it migrates slower (145–150 kDa) than would be expected from its molecular mass (∼100 kDa) (1Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5814-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Thus, our data demonstrate that Eps15, a novel component of clathrin-coated pits and vesicles, displays similarity in organization to the principal proteins of the clathrin coat, such as the clathrin triskelion and AP-2, which are hetero-oligomers. Although the importance of Eps15 dimerization and oligomerization as well as the function of Eps15 are unknown, several possibilities can be discussed. Data from co-immunoprecipitation analysis suggest that AP-2 is present in excess to Eps15 in the cell (3Tebar F. Sorkina T. Sorkin A. Ericsson M. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28727-28730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). This notion is supported by the data of electron microscopy demonstrating that a limited pool of AP-2 located at the periphery of the coat is associated with Eps15 (3Tebar F. Sorkina T. Sorkin A. Ericsson M. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28727-28730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Given the very stable aggregation of Eps15, it is possible to predict that four AP-2 complexes, which might be associated with two Eps15 dimers, will be in close proximity to each other. This, in turn, may affect the function of AP-2 located at the periphery of the coat. It may, for instance, interfere with the polymerization of clathrin at the edge of the coat and limit the growing clathrin lattice, or it may result in an increased curvature of the coat. Another possibility is that dimerization of Eps15 is necessary to increase the affinity of EH domains for interactions with putative EH domain-binding proteins. More important, other EH domain-containing proteins (Eps15R, PAN-1, and YBL047c) also contain extensive coiled-coil regions (4Wong W.T. Schumacher C. Salcini A.E. Romano A. Castagnino P. Pelicci P.G.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1485-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) that might be involved in dimerization. Therefore, homo- and heterodimerization of EH domain-containing proteins may be a general feature important for the functional activity of this novel family of proteins.

Following synthesis, these proteins are sequestered into the endoplasmic reticulum and assemble into extremely large elastic polymers, linked by noncovalent and intermolecular disulfide bonds. To study the structural requirements for the assembly of HMW-GS, we have expressed in transgenic wheat a recombinant protein between two cognate x- and y-type subunits. In contrast to the natural polymerized x- and y-type HMW-GS, a significant amount of the recombinant subunit remained monomeric. Nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, coupled with limited proteolysis, showed that the monomeric form of the recombinant subunit contained an unusual intramolecular disulfide bond, linking an N-terminal cysteine to the single C-terminal cysteine residue. In addition, sucrose gradient analysis revealed that this intramolecular disulfide bond impeded the ability of the recombinant subunit to assemble into polymers. Despite of its altered assembly, a notable amount of the overexpressed recombinant subunit was also present in glutenin polymers.

Our results show that it is possible to modify gluten assembly and properties by expressing recombinant HMW-GS in transgenic wheat, and have a major implication for the improvement of wheat bread-making quality. Wheat is considered a staple crop because of its unique superiority for making leavened bread. This is due to the viscoelastic properties of its storage protein-rich gluten polymer, which is obtained following hydration of the wheat flour (1Kasarda D.D. Pomeranz Y. Wheat Is Unique. American Association of Cereal Chemists, St. Paul, MN1989: 277-302Google Scholar). Although all wheat seed storage proteins are part of the gluten, the glutenin polymers are considered as the most important determinants of its viscoelastic property. These proteins belong to a special class of oligomeric secretory proteins, like viral glycoproteins, which upon sequestration into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HMW-GS, high molecular weight glutenin subunit(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; β-ME, β-mercaptoethanol; DTT, dithiothreitol.assemble by noncovalent interactions and intermolecular disulfide bonds. In fact, the glutenins form the largest protein polymers known to occur in nature, reaching sizes as large as 11 million daltons (see Ref. 2Wrigley C.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 738-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, and references therein). These polymers possess a highly elastic structure, similar to elastin and titin (2Wrigley C.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 738-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 3Shewry P.R. Halford N.G. Tatham A.S. Miflin B.J. Oxford Surveys of Plant Molecular and Cell Biology. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 163-219Google Scholar). By convention, the glutenins are divided into two groups: high molecular weight subunits (HMW-GS) of about 80–100 kDa and low molecular weight subunits of about 30–40 kDa. The HMW-GS are considered the most important determinants of the structure of these polymers (4Payne P.I. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1987; 38: 141-153Crossref Google Scholar). In hexaploid bread wheat (genome AABBDD), six multiallelic HMW-GS genes have been identified, two at each of the homoeologous Glu-1loci located on group 1 chromosomes (4Payne P.I. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1987; 38: 141-153Crossref Google Scholar). The HMW-GS genes at eachGlu-1 locus encode two closely related subunit types, termed x and y on the basis of their mobility in SDS-PAGE (4Payne P.I. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1987; 38: 141-153Crossref Google Scholar). The x- and y-type genes appear to have been formed by a duplication of a single ancestral gene early during wheat evolution (4Payne P.I. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1987; 38: 141-153Crossref Google Scholar). They have been maintained separately as two distinct genes in each HMW-GS locus, rendering x- or y-types of different wheat genomes more homologous to each other than to x- and y-types encoded by the same genome (3Shewry P.R. Halford N.G. Tatham A.S. Miflin B.J. Oxford Surveys of Plant Molecular and Cell Biology. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 163-219Google Scholar). This is in contrast to other groups of wheat storage proteins, which comprise multigene families and apparently evolved by unequal crossing over (5Kreis M. Shewry P.R. Ford B.G. Ford J. Miflin B.J. Miflin B.J. Oxford Surveys of Plant Molecular and Cell Biology. Oxford University Press, New York1985: 253-317Google Scholar, 6Shewry P.R. Kigel H. Galili G. Seed Development and Germination. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 45-72Google Scholar). The x- and y-type HMW-GS share a very similar structure (about 80% amino acid sequence similarity): a large central domain composed of repeating amino acid sequences rich in glutamine and proline, flanked by N- and C-terminal domains made up of nonrepetitive sequences that contain highly conserved cysteine residues (Fig. 1 A) (3Shewry P.R. Halford N.G. Tatham A.S. Miflin B.J. Oxford Surveys of Plant Molecular and Cell Biology. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 163-219Google Scholar, 7Greene F.C. Anderson O.D. Yip R.E. Halford N.G.

Nevertheless, x- and y-type subunits differ in several important features. x-types usually have three cysteines in the N-terminal domain, while y-types have five; both types have one cysteine in the C-terminal domain, but y-types have an additional cysteine within the repeat region in close proximity to the C-terminal domain. In addition, there are some differences between the two types in the composition and order of repeats within the central domain (3Shewry P.R. Halford N.G. Tatham A.S. Miflin B.J. Oxford Surveys of Plant Molecular and Cell Biology. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 163-219Google Scholar). Both x- and y-type HMW-GS exhibit retarded mobility in SDS-PAGE, suggesting that they possess a specific structural conformation that is not entirely denatured in SDS. Physical studies (3Shewry P.R.

Pomeranz Y. Wheat Is Unique. American Association of Cereal Chemists, St. Paul, MN1989: 277-302Google Scholar, and references therein), the role of HMW-GS structure in polymer assembly within the ER is largely not understood. As x- and y-types have been maintained separately in evolution, we hypothesized that the differences between them may play an important role in their ability to interact. We previously produced several recombinant constructs between x- and y-types and expressed them in bacteria (14Shani N. Steffen-Campbell J.D. Anderson O.D. Greene F.C. Galili G. Plant Physiol. 1992; 98: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The recombinant subunits showed unexpected SDS-PAGE mobilities, suggesting that despite the close sequence similarity between x- and y-types, they may have substantial conformational differences, particularly in their N-terminal domains (14Shani N. Steffen-Campbell J.D. Anderson O.D. Greene F.C. Galili G. Plant Physiol. 1992; 98: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the present report, we have analyzed the assembly of one of these recombinant HMW-GS and its incorporation into polymers in the native environment of wheat endosperm. The recombinant subunit was found to possess a modified assembly pattern, and its expression also altered glutenin polymer formation in the transgenic plants. Grains were obtained from hexaploid bread wheat cultivar Bobwhite, transgenic lines 1 and 4, expressing relatively low and high levels of the recombinant subunit, respectively, and from a line stably transformed only with the selectable marker plasmid, as a control (15Blechl A.E. Anderson O.D. Nature BioTechnol. 1996; 14: 875-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Grains were ground with a mortar and pestle in a buffer containing 0.1m NaCl, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA and then centrifuged at room temperature for 15 min at 13,000 × g. The resulting supernatant, containing the salt-soluble proteins, was kept for further analysis and the pellet resuspended in a buffer containing 2% SDS, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA. Following extraction for 2 h at room temperature with agitation, the suspension was centrifuged as described above and the supernatant, termed “SDS-soluble,” kept. The pellet was then re-extracted as above, with the inclusion of 1% β-ME. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and termed “SDS-insoluble.” For partial reduction, the salt-soluble or SDS-soluble supernatant was treated with various concentrations of DTT for 30 min at room temperature. For quantitation of the proportion of monomeric recombinant HMW-GS, seeds from the “high expressing” transgenic line were homogenized directly in the 2% SDS-containing buffer (see above) and the resulting homogenate was divided into two equal parts. One half was reduced with 100 mm DTT, and both halves were centrifuged to obtain either SDS-soluble or total (reduced) HMW-GS. 800 μl of the salt-soluble, SDS-soluble, or total (reduced) HMW-GS supernatants (see above) were layered onto 5.2-ml linear 5–20% sucrose density gradients, prepared with the same buffer. The gradients were centrifuged for 18 h at 45,000 rpm and 4 °C in a Beckman SW 55Ti rotor. Fractions were collected from the top, trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, washed with ice-cold acetone and 0.1 nNaOH, and resuspended in sample buffer containing β-ME. To estimate the molecular mass distribution of proteins along the gradient, the following protein markers were used: cytochrome c (12 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), aldolase trimer (150 kDa), and catalase tetramer (232 kDa). Protein samples were dissolved in SDS sample buffer either lacking or containing 5% β-ME as described in the text and fractionated by SDS-PAGE (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). The separation gels contained 10% (w/v) acrylamide and 0.05% (w/v) bisacrylamide. Proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue as described previously (17Galili G. Feldman M. Theor. Appl. Genet. 1983; 64: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In some cases, the stained protein bands were quantitated using an image analysis software system (MacBAS). For immunological detection, the proteins were transferred from the gels to a nitrocellulose membrane and reacted with a mixture of anti-x- and anti-y-type HMW-GS sera (at a dilution of 1:3000 each), kindly provided by P. R. Shewry (University of Bristol, Long Ashton, United Kingdom) and R. Rubin (Rehovot, Israel). Immunoreacting bands were detected using ECL detection reagents (Amersham). SDS-soluble supernatants were partially reduced with 1 mm DTT, dissolved in sample buffer lacking β-ME and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The designated lane was excised from the slab gel, equilibrated in upper Tris buffer (0.125m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 0.1% SDS) containing 5% β-ME for 15 min at room temperature, laid on top of a second dimensional gel, and subjected to electrophoresis. Salt-soluble supernatants were alkylated at room temperature with 100 mm N-ethylmalemide for 15 min either with or without a previous reduction with 10 mmDTT for 30 min. After fractionation on SDS-PAGE, the gels were briefly stained with Coomassie Blue and the reduced and oxidized forms of the recombinant subunit excised. The resulting gel slices were then equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.6) and loaded on a second gel. “In-gel” proteolysis with endoproteinase Lys-C was performed during electrophoresis (18Cleveland D.W. Fisher S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by adding 2 μg of protease (prepared in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.6), 20% glycerol, 1% bromphenol blue) onto the gel slice in the sample well. When the dye was about halfway down the stacking gel, the power was switched off for 30 min to allow digestion to occur. Electrophoresis was then continued as usual. Following electrophoresis, sample lanes were subjected to a second dimensional separation on reducing SDS-PAGE as described above. For N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, in-gel digested samples were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and stained with Coomassie Blue (19Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two major digestion products of ∼60 and ∼50 kDa were excised and subjected to protein sequence analysis in an Applied Biosystems sequencer (model 477A). To unravel the role of x- and y-type HMW-GS in polymer assembly, we have transformed wheat with a gene encoding a recombinant D-genome x-type subunit (Dx5), in which the N-terminal domain was substituted with the homologous domain from the y-type subunit of the same genome (Dy10) (Fig. 1 A). The N-terminal domains of these subunit types possess 80% amino acid sequence similarity (Fig. 1 B). The transformation and expression of the recombinant subunit in endosperm tissue of transgenic wheat has been previously described in detail (15Blechl A.E. Anderson O.D. Nature BioTechnol. 1996; 14: 875-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Wheat HMW-GS form aqueous buffer-insoluble polymers of various sizes. The smaller ones are soluble in SDS, while the larger ones are insoluble unless intermolecular disulfide bonds are first broken by reducing agents (20Graveland A. Bosveld P. Lichtendonk W.J. Marseille J.P. Moonen J.H.E. J. Cereal Sci. 1985; 3: 1-16Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Mature grains from transgenic lines 1 and 4, expressing relatively low and high levels of the recombinant Dy10-Dx5 subunit, respectively, and from a control line, stably transformed only with the selectable marker plasmid (15Blechl A.E. Anderson O.D. Nature BioTechnol. 1996; 14: 875-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), were sequentially extracted with aqueous buffers to obtain salt-soluble, SDS-soluble, and SDS-insoluble fractions. As shown in Fig. 2 (A andB, lanes a–c), wild type HMW-GS subunits Ax2*, Dx5, Bx7, By9, and Dy10 (15Blechl A.E. Anderson O.D. Nature BioTechnol. 1996; 14: 875-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) of the control wheat were all present in complexes that partitioned between the SDS-soluble and SDS-insoluble fractions. In the two transgenic genotypes, the recombinant subunit, which migrates faster than the endogenous Dx5 subunit (Fig. 2,A and B, lanes e, f,h, and i; see arrow on theright), was also present in SDS-soluble and SDS-insoluble polymers. However, a significant amount was also present in the salt-soluble fraction in both transgenic genotypes (Fig. 2,A and B, lanes d and g). Notably, in the high expressing transgenic line, a larger proportion of the endogenous subunits was present as SDS-soluble, smaller polymers compared with nontransformed control plants (Fig. 2, A andB, cf. lanes b and c versus lanes hand i). This phenomenon was much less pronounced in the “low expressing” transgenic line. As shown in Fig. 3 A (lane a), in the absence of a reducing agent, the salt-soluble recombinant subunit migrated in SDS-PAGE as two bands within the range of ∼80–110 kDa, one with the expected size of a reduced monomer, and the second migrating slightly faster. No glutenin oligomers were detected in this lane. Glutenin subunits containing intramolecular disulfide bonds generally migrate in nonreducing SDS-PAGE slightly faster than the reduced ones (14Shani N. Steffen-Campbell J.D. Anderson O.D. Greene F.C. Galili G. Plant Physiol. 1992; 98: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21Werner W.E. Adalsteins A.E. Kasarda D.D. Cereal Chem. 1992; 69: 535-541Google Scholar). Thus, to test whether the rapidly migrating band corresponded to a monomeric form of the recombinant subunit that contained an intramolecular disulfide bond, the salt-soluble fraction was treated with increasing concentrations of DTT before SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 3 A (lanes b–e), upon addition of this reducing agent, the rapidly migrating band was gradually converted into a form that migrates at the position of the regularly migrating reduced monomer. Although the salt-soluble recombinant subunit was not linked to other polypeptides by intermolecular disulfide bonds, it could still be present in complexes linked by noncovalent interactions that were dissociated in the SDS gel. To test this possibility, the salt-soluble fraction was separated on a 5–20% sucrose gradient in the absence of any denaturing agent. As this gradient separates proteins up to around 150 kDa in size, monomeric HMW-GS of around 90 kDa are expected to migrate to the middle of the gradient, while dimers and oligomers are expected to sediment to the bottom. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the salt-soluble recombinant subunit sedimented to the middle of the gradient, between the 67- and 150-kDa markers, corresponding to the expected size of a monomer. As HMW-GS assemble by both intermolecular disulfide bonds and noncovalent interactions, we wished to test whether the intramolecular disulfide bond within the recombinant subunit affected the latter's ability to interact noncovalently. To address this, the salt-soluble extract from the transgenic plant was divided into two parts. One was fractionated on a 5–20% sucrose gradient in the absence of reducing agents, while the other was reduced and fractionated on a similar gradient supplemented with 100 mm DTT. As shown in Fig. 4, while the oxidized form of the recombinant subunit mostly sedimented as a monomer (Fig. 4, panel A), the reduced subunit was partially assembled into homo-oligomers that sedimented to the bottom of the gradient (Fig. 4, panel B). These oligomers were apparently associated by noncovalent interactions. Although HMW-GS contain several lysine residues, a previous study showed that only one, located in the central repetitive region, is exposed to cleavage by endoproteinase Lys-C (22Tao H.P. Adalsteins A.E. Kasarda D.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1159: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (see Fig.1). Thus, treatment of x- or y-type HMW-GS with this endoproteinase results in the cleavage of the intact subunits into two relatively large fragments, containing either the N- or C-terminal regions (22Tao H.P. Adalsteins A.E. Kasarda D.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1159: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We therefore used limited Lys-C proteolysis to test whether the intramolecular disulfide bond in the recombinant subunit was formed between two cysteines in the N-terminal region or between an N-terminal and the single C-terminal cysteine. To address this, the salt-soluble extract was fractionated either in the absence or presence of reducing agents to generate the rapidly migrating oxidized monomer and slowly migrating reduced monomer, respectively. These two bands were excised separately and subjected to limited, in-gel proteolysis with Lys-C, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig.5 A (lanes a and b), upon limited proteolysis of the reduced monomeric form of the recombinant subunit from the salt-soluble fraction with Lys-C, the intact subunit (migrating in the SDS gel with a molecular mass of ∼110 kDa) was partially cleaved into two fragments of ∼60 and ∼50 kDa. Based on the unique position of the lysine residue in the central part of this subunit (Fig. 1 A, Dy10-Dx5), the ∼60- and ∼50-kDa polypeptides apparently correspond to the N- and C-terminal regions of the recombinant subunit, respectively. This was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing of the first 6 amino acids of the two resulting peptides. The ∼60-kDa band yielded Glu-Gly-Glu-Ala-Ser-Arg, and the ∼50-kDa band yielded Gly-Gln-Gln-Pro-Gly-Gln. These sequences revealed a complete match to the N-terminal sequence of the mature Dy10 and the internal sequence starting after the central lysine at position 461 of Dx5, respectively (23Anderson O.D. Greene F.C. Yip R.E. Halford N.G. Shewry P.R. Malpica-Romero J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 461-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) (cf. Fig. 1). When the oxidized band of the recombinant subunit was treated with Lys-C and refractionated in SDS-PAGE in the absence of reducing agents, a significant proportion of the rapidly migrating band (corresponding to the normal location of the oxidized form) was converted into a slower migrating form that migrated near the reduced monomeric form (Fig. 5 A, lane d). Such a significant conversion was not observed in a control that was not treated with Lys-C (Fig.5 A, lane c). We thus hypothesized that the newly formed, slower migrating oxidized monomeric band of the recombinant subunit (Fig. 5 A, lane d, upper band), which was produced upon Lys-C treatment, represented the fraction of the oxidized recombinant subunit that was actually cleaved at the centrally located Lys-C sensitive site, but that the two fragments were still held together by a disulfide bond naturally formed between the N-and C-terminal regions. This digestion has apparently altered the conformation of the oxidized protein into a more extended, slower migrating form. To test this possibility, both the rapidly and slowly migrating monomeric bands from lane d of Fig. 5 Awere excised from the gel, and the proteins were then eluted from the bands and refractionated on reducing SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig.5 A (lanes e and f), the slower migrating band was separated into the two expected ∼50- and ∼60-kDa polypeptides, while the rapidly migrating band was not, supporting our hypothesis. Our hypothesis that the oxidized monomeric form of the recombinant monomeric subunit contained an intramolecular disulfide bond between the N- and C-terminal region was also confirmed by an additional experiment. Similar lanes to those shown in Fig.5 A (lanes c and d), were separated in a second dimensional reducing gel (Fig. 5, panels B andC). The band exhibiting the slower migration (double-headed arrow on top of Fig.5 C) was separated into the ∼60- and ∼50-kDa polypeptides in the Lys-C-treated sample (indicated by arrows on theleft of the two spots in Fig. 5 C). No such polypeptides were detected at this location (arrow ontop of Fig. 5 B) in the untreated sample. Although a significant portion of the recombinant subunit was present as monomer, the fact that it was also present in SDS-soluble and SDS-insoluble fractions indicated that it was also partially capable of interacting with itself or with other endogenous HMW-GS. To address this point, we first analyzed the nature of the recombinant subunit in the SDS-soluble fraction by SDS-PAGE separation in the absence of reducing agent. In control seeds, HMW-GS from this fraction were exclusively present in polymers that were stacked at the top of the gel (Fig. 6, lane a, arrow). However, in transformed seeds, a significant amount of the SDS-soluble recombinant subunit appeared as reduced and oxidized monomers (Fig. 6, lane b). To test whether some recombinant subunit from this fraction was also present in oligomers or polymers, together with the natural HMW-GS, the top part of lane b was excised, treated with excess β-ME, and refractionated in a second SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. As shown in Fig. 6(lane c), this treatment liberated a substantial amount of recombinant subunit, as well as the natural subunits, implying that they were all linked by disulfide bonds into polymers. Next, we wished to identify the specific intermolecular interactions of the recombinant subunit. The SDS-soluble fraction was partially reduced with 1 mm DTT (which generally liberates HMW-GS monomers as well as oligomers linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds; Ref. 21Werner W.E. Adalsteins A.E. Kasarda D.D. Cereal Chem. 1992; 69: 535-541Google Scholar), and subjected to two-dimensional SDS-PAGE, the first dimension in the absence of β-ME and the second in an excess of β-ME. As shown in the top horizontal first dimensional gel in Fig.7 A, treatment of the SDS-soluble fraction from control seeds with 1 mm DTT liberated several bands: HMW-GS monomers (M), two major bands of HMW-GS dimers (D), and two additional faint bands that apparently represented HMW-GS trimers (T). Upon fractionation on the second dimension reducing SDS-PAGE, the HMW-GS monomers migrated in an expected diagonal, while the oligomers were dissociated into monomers that appeared to the left of the diagonal. The pattern of appearance of the spots on the left of the diagonal suggested that they were liberated from various x-x and x-y type homodimers and heterodimers (21Werner W.E. Adalsteins A.E. Kasarda D.D. Cereal Chem. 1992; 69: 535-541Google Scholar). HMW-GS dimers of y-y types were not detected, in agreement with previous reports in which y-y dimers were not found upon partial reduction of HMW-GS (21Werner W.E. Adalsteins A.E. Kasarda D.D. Cereal Chem. 1992; 69: 535-541Google Scholar, 24Shani N. Rosenberg N. Kasarda D.D. Galili G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8924-8930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of 1 mm DTT to the SDS-soluble fraction from the transgenic seeds liberated four dimer and four trimer HMW-GS bands (Fig. 7 B, top horizontal first dimensional gel). Each of these groups of dimers and trimers included the two dimer and trimer bands present in nontransformed seeds (compare with Fig.7 A), as well as two additional, more slowly migrating bands (additional dimers are shown by upward pointing arrows), which apparently represent new oligomers containing the recombinant subunit. To analyze this further, the first dimensional gel at top of Fig. 7 B was separated on a second dimensional SDS-PAGE in the presence of excess β-ME. This fractionation revealed two major spots to the left of the diagonal (single-headed arrows), which were not present in the gel from the control plant (Fig. 7, compare A and B). According to their migration, these two major spots were apparently liberated from homodimers and homotrimers of the recombinant subunit. A closer look at the second dimensional panel of Fig. 7 B revealed several new spots, which, according to their migration, were apparently liberated from various heterodimers containing the recombinant subunit and other endogenous x- and y-type subunits. One of these spots of the B-genome x-type subunit Bx7 is indicated by an arrowhead. This subunit was apparently liberated from a heterodimer also containing the recombinant subunit. A major spot that deviated to the right of the diagonal appeared only in transgenic seeds (Fig. 7 B,double-headed arrow) and apparently represented the oxidized monomeric form of the recombinant subunit. The pattern of assembly of the recombinant subunit into large polymers was also studied by analyzing the pattern by which individual subunits from the SDS-insoluble fraction were rendered SDS-soluble upon addition of increasing concentrations of DTT. As shown in Fig. 8, the pattern of liberation of subunits into the SDS-soluble fraction was similar when comparing complexes from transgenic and control plants, and both the wild type and recombinant subunits exhibited a similar release pattern. Notwithstanding, in the transgenic seeds, the largest glutenin complexes (that were dissociated only by the highest concentration of a reducing agent) still contained appreciable amounts of the overexpressed recombinant subunit (Fig. 8, lane h). This suggests that the portion of recombinant subunit that was incorporated into polymers, assembled in a manner similar to the endogenous subunits. The proportion of the recombinant subunit present as monomers in the high expressing transgenic line was determined in the following experiment. Seeds were homogenized in an aqueous buffer containing 2% SDS (see “Experimental Procedures”), and the homogenate was divided into two. One half was supplemented with 100 mm DTT. The homogenates were then centrifuged to obtain either SDS-soluble (monomers and oligomers) or total HMW-GS (in their reduced monomeric form) supernatants. The two supernatants were then fractionated on 5–20% sucrose gradients. As shown in Fig.9 A, the SDS-soluble recombinant subunit partitioned between monomers that sedimented in the middle of the gradient (fractions 6–8), and a small proportion of oligomers that sedimented to the bottom of the gradient together with the endogenous HMW-GS (fraction P). The total reduced recombinant subunit also sedimented as expected to the middle of the gradient together with the endogenous HMW-GS (Fig. 9 B,fractions 6–8). Fractions 6–8 from each of the gradients shown in panels A and B were pooled and subjected to four equal sequential 2-fold dilutions. Equal volumes from each dilution were then fractionated on reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig.9 C), and the bands corresponding to the recombinant subunit (labeled by an arrow on the right) were densitometrically quantitated (see “Experimental Procedures”). This analysis revealed that the monomeric form (M) of the recombinant subunit amounted to about 50–60% of the total (T) recombinant subunit (Fig. 9 C, cf. lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7 with lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8, respectively). To unravel the mechanism of HMW-GS assembly, we have expressed in the endosperm tissue of transgenic wheat, a recombinant protein containing the N-terminal region of a y-type subunit, and the central repetitive plus the C-terminal regions of an x-type subunit. Assembly of the recombinant subunit was studied by several different approaches: (i) partition between salt-soluble, SDS-soluble, and SDS-insoluble fractions; (ii) fractionation of HMW-GS on sucrose gradients; and (iii) identification of HMW-GS oligomers released from larger polymers upon treatments with low concentrations of a reducing agent (25Lawrence G.J. Payne P.I. J. Exp. Bot. 1983; 34: 254-267Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Two lines of evidence have suggested that assembly of the recombinant subunit into polymers was altered. (i) In contrast to the wild type subunits, which were entirely present in SDS-soluble and SDS-insoluble polymers, a significant portion of the recombinant subunit was present in the salt-soluble fraction; and (ii) sucrose gradients and SDS-PAGE in the absence of reducing agents directly showed that, unlike wild type subunits, which were present entirely in polymers, a significant amount (∼50–60% in the high expressing line) of the recombinant subunit was monomeric. The altered assembly of the recombinant subunit into polymers may be explained by two major hypotheses. (i) Assembly of the HMW-GS may require specific molar ratios of x- and y-type HMW-GS and perhaps also of low molecular weight glutenin subunits rendering excess amounts (due to massive overexpression) of the recombinant subunit, assembly-incompetent; and (ii) assembly of the recombinant subunit may have been changed due to its specific structural conformation. Although we cannot entirely rule out the first possibility, several lines of evidence support the second hypothesis. First, a significant amount of salt-soluble monomeric form of the recombinant subunit was also obtained in the transgenic line expressing relatively low levels of this subunit. Second, if inefficient assembly was due to excess amounts, it would be expected that the recombinant subunit would compete with the wild type subunits for assembly into polymers, rendering them monomeric as well. This was not observed. Third, reduction of the salt-soluble extract before fractionation on a sucrose gradient (Fig. 4) suggested that the intramolecular disulfide bond also interfered with the noncovalent interactions between the recombinant and other subunits. Finally, the two-dimensional SDS-PAGE showed that the recombinant subunit could interact with itself to form homo-oligomers. Thus, if its inefficient assembly with other subunits was due solely to its excess molar ratio, the entire excess would have expected to be found as homo-oligomers. A large proportion of the monomeric Dy10-Dx5 subunit migrated in SDS-PAGE more rapidly than the expected migration of the reduced monomer, suggesting that it contained an intramolecular disulfide bond. This was confirmed by the disappearance of this rapidly migrating band upon addition of DTT. Furthermore, limited proteolysis with endoproteinase Lys-C, in the presence or absence of reducing agents, followed by N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the proteolytic fragments, showed that the intramolecular disulfide bond was formed between the single C-terminal cysteine of this recombinant subunit and one of the N-terminal cysteines. Association of N- and C-terminal cysteines by an intramolecular disulfide bond is not in accord with the suggested rodlike structure of HMW-GS (3Shewry P.R. Halford N.G. Tatham A.S. Miflin B.J. Oxford Surveys of Plant Molecular and Cell Biology. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 163-219Google Scholar, 6Shewry P.R. Kigel H. Galili G. Seed Development and Germination.

Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 945-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar), in which these cysteines would be too distant from each other to interact. Whether the apparent proximity of the N- and C-terminal regions shown here represents an altered structural conformation of the recombinant subunit or reflects an unexplored feature of the general structure of HMW-GS is an exciting area of research for future studies. Previous studies showed that intermolecular disulfide bonds between N-terminal cysteines of y-type subunits and the C-terminal cysteine of x-type subunits are rather abundant in glutenin polymers (20Graveland A. Bosveld P. Lichtendonk W.J. Marseille J.P. Moonen J.H.E. J. Cereal Sci. 1985; 3: 1-16Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 22Tao H.P. Adalsteins A.E. Kasarda D.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1159: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This suggests that the N- and C-terminal domains of x- and y-type HMW-GS possess particular structural conformations that encourage the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds between x- and y-type subunits. The special conformation of N-terminal domains of x- and y-type subunits was also previously inferred from expression of complementary recombinant x-y and y-x subunits in bacteria (14Shani N. Steffen-Campbell J.D. Anderson O.D. Greene F.C. Galili G. Plant Physiol. 1992; 98: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, based on our previous and present observations, we suggest that the intramolecular disulfide bond formed within the recombinant subunit is due to the installation, on the same polypeptide, of a y-type N-terminal domain and a x-type C-terminal domain, which naturally form intermolecular disulfide bonds between them. While over half the recombinant subunit was monomeric, the remainder was assembled into polymers of both small and large sizes, which partitioned between the SDS-soluble and SDS-insoluble fractions. Moreover, the gradual liberation of HMW-GS from the SDS-insoluble fraction upon progressive reduction also implied that upon assembly, the recombinant subunit was highly competent for incorporation into even very large polymers. This incorporation rendered the overexpressed recombinant subunit the most abundant subunit in these large polymers (Fig. 8) and measurably altered their structure and composition. At the same time, overproduction of the recombinant subunit reduced the extent of incorporation of wild type subunit into large (SDS-insoluble) polymers (Fig. 2). The molecular basis for this observation has still to be elucidated. Our results suggest that during folding of the HMW-GS within the ER, the cysteines in their N- and C-terminal domains are accessible for two different maturation steps that compete with each other: (i) formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds with cysteines from other subunits and incorporation into glutenin polymers and (ii) formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds that may interfere with their polymerization. However, the natural HMW-GS have evolved in such a way to significantly favor the formation of inter- versusintramolecular disulfide bonds. This preference may have been reversed by the cysteine configuration in the recombinant subunit. The structural requirements for favoring the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds between HMW-GS are not understood. However, based on our results, a possible explanation is that this phenomenon is related to some evolutionary-derived conformational differences between the N- and C-terminal domains of x- and y-type subunits. Indeed, the N-terminal domain of Dy10 contains an insertion of 18 amino acids, including two adjacent cysteines not present in Dx5, while the C-terminal regions of the two subunit types possess some critical changes in a few amino acids, e.g. three scattered proline residues in Dy10 versus one serine and two leucine residues in Dx5 (23Anderson O.D.

Further modifications of these residues are required to dissect their significance in HMW-GS assembly. Our results show unequivocally that it is possible to change the composition of the glutenin polymer by expression of modified HMW-GS in transgenic wheat. Moreover, we have shown that modification of the polymers may not only be achieved by altering the nature of a recombinant protein, but also by controlling the level of its expression. Our laboratories continue to use this approach to both understand the mechanism of glutenin assembly and improve wheat bread-making quality. We are grateful to Drs. M. Edelman and A. A. Levy for critical reading of the manuscript and helpful comments. We also thank Dr. P. R. Shewry and R. Rubin for the anti-HMW-GS serum."

In yeast, two phenotypes, [URE3] and [PSI+], have been attributed to non-Mendelian genetic elements that have similarities to both infectious and genetic properties of the TSEs (5Wickner R.B.

However, little is known about the molecular details concerning the propagation of the TSE agents and related yeast phenotypes. The unusual nature of the agent causing the TSEs has led to the proposal that these agents are devoid of a nucleic acid genome and consist solely of protein (7Griffith J.S.

This protein, called the scrapie prion protein (PrPSc) or protease-resistant PrP (PrP-res) (8Prusiner S.B.

Although PrPC is soluble, monomeric, and readily degraded by proteases, PrP-res has a high β-sheet content characteristic of an amyloidogenic protein polymer (12Caughey B.W. Dong A. Bhat K.S.

The TSEs are similar to other amyloidogenic diseases in that they can have either a sporadic etiology or be inherited diseases that are linked to mutations in the open reading frame of the host amyloid precursor gene, in this case the prion protein gene. However, the TSEs are also infectious diseases, and there is strong experimental data suggesting that PrP-res is the main component of the TSE agent, although this has not been conclusively demonstrated. The mechanism of PrP-res formation has been investigated in a cell-free conversion reaction in which [35S]methionine-labeled PrPC (35S-PrPC) is converted into proteinase K (PK)-resistant 35S-PrP (35S-PrP-res) in the presence of TSE brain-derived PrP-res (19Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Both the brain-derived PrP-res and nascent35S-PrP-res are reduced in molecular mass by 6–7 kDa after PK digestion, whereas any unconverted 35S-PrPCis completely degraded. The formation of 35S-PrP-res cell-free conversion products requires the presence of PrP-res aggregates (20Caughey B. Kocisko D.A. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 807-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Irreversible denaturation of PrP-res structure results in the coincident loss of conversion activity, resistance to PK, and a decrease in TSE infectivity (21Caughey B. Raymond G.J. Kocisko D.A. Lansbury P.T. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4701-4710Crossref Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cell-free conversion reaction exhibits both TSE strain and species specificity (22Bessen R.A. Kocisko D.A.

In this study we investigated PrP-res formation in TSE-infected brain tissue by using intact brain slices instead of purified PrP-res in the cell-free conversion reaction. This in situ PrP conversion assay provides a powerful tool to model PrP-res formation in vivo. Brain tissue was collected from clinically ill Syrian golden hamsters (outbred LVK/LAK) inoculated with the HY strain of TME as described previously (25Bessen R.A. Marsh R.F. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 72: 329-334Crossref Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The cell-free conversion reaction was performed by incubating ∼1.6 μg of brain-derived PrP-res (prepared as described previously (26Bessen R.A. Marsh R.F. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7859-7868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except the proteinase K digestion step was omitted) with 35S-PrPC(20,000 cpm, ∼3 ng) lacking its glycophosphatidylinositol C-terminal anchor that was purified from murine fibroblast cells transfected with the Syrian hamster PrP gene as described previously (19Kocisko D.A.

Nature. 1995; 375: 698-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The mixture (total volume of 16 μl) was incubated for various lengths of time (0–24 h), digested with PK at 100 μg/ml for 1 h at 37 °C, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. In some experiments the reaction mixture was separated into a pellet and supernatant fraction by microcentrifugation (12,000 ×g) for 20 min prior to PK digestion of each fraction. In situ cell-free conversion reactions were performed by air drying unfixed frozen hamster brain slices (10 μm thick) onto glass microscope slides and preincubating with reaction buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumen) for 30 min at 37 °C. 35S-PrPC(20–50,000 cpm/reaction) from either mouse or hamster was then layered over the tissue and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. The supernatants were removed, and tissue sections were briefly rinsed and then treated with PK (0 to 200 μg/ml) in reaction buffer lacking BSA, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. Tissue sections were washed in reaction buffer containing 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 15 min. Conversion products were detected by solubilizing the tissue in SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer and analyzing for PK-resistant 35S-PrP by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Alternatively, tissue sections were left on the slide and exposed directly to X-Omat AR film for autoradiography or dipped in NTB-2 liquid emulsion (Eastman Kodak Co.) and developed according to manufacturer's directions. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting for PrP were performed as described previously (26Bessen R.A. Marsh R.F. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7859-7868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, polyvinylidene difluoride membrane bound proteins were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk (in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20) and incubated with monoclonal antibody 3F4 (27Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Tonnademasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J.

Immunopositive signal was detected using ECL (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PrP immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (26Bessen R.A. Marsh R.F. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7859-7868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded hamster brain using a hydrolytic autoclaving technique (28Kitamoto T. Shin R.W. Dohura K. Tomokane N. Miyazono M. Muramoto T. Tateishi J. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 140: 1285-1294PubMed Google Scholar) combined with monoclonal 3F4 (1:2,000) immunostaining for PrP-res that does not detect PrPC. To investigate if the PrP conversion reaction could occur in vivo, we tested whether brain slices from hamsters infected with the HY strain of TME (25Bessen R.A. Marsh R.F. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 72: 329-334Crossref Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 26Bessen R.A. Marsh R.F. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7859-7868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a TSE of mink, could induce PrP conversion. Fig. 1 illustrates that a brain slice from a TME-infected hamster, but not from an uninfected host, can induce formation of 35S-PrP-res that after PK digestion was 6–7 kDa smaller than the 35S-PrPC precursor. The conversion reaction solution incubating on top of the TME-infected brain slice contained 35S-PrPC that was degraded by PK and did not contain 35S-PrP-res (data not shown). These results indicate that TSE infected slices can induce35S-PrP conversion and that one step in the conversion is the binding of the 35S-PrP to the TME-infected brain tissue without subsequent release of 35S-PrP-res into the bathing medium. To determine whether 35S-PrPC binds directly to PrP-res in the brain slice, the cell-free conversion reaction was performed using purified PrP-res instead of brain slices and analyzed prior to and after conversion. Immediately after35S-PrPC was mixed with PrP-res, the35S-PrPC was PK-sensitive (Fig.2, lane 1, middle panel); this was expected because conversion to PrP-res was previously demonstrated to be time-dependent (19Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). After centrifugation of the initial reaction mixture, PK-sensitive 35S-PrPC was found only in the supernatant (Fig. 2, lane 3,top and middle panels), whereas the nonradioactive aggregated PrP-res was detected in the pellet fraction (Fig. 2, lane 2, bottom panel) by immunoblot analysis. When the conversion reaction was allowed to proceed for 24 h, most of the 35S-PrP was associated with pellet (Fig. 2, lane 5, top panel), and ∼15% of the pelleted 35S-PrP was PK-resistant (Fig. 2, lane 5, top and middle panels). The35S-PrP-res co-sedimented with the brain-derived PrP-res (Fig.2, lane 5, bottom panel). The soluble35S-PrP that remained in the supernatant fraction was degraded by PK (Fig. 2, lane 6, top andmiddle panels). These findings indicate that during the PrP conversion reaction, soluble 35S-PrPC binds directly to PrP-res. Furthermore, a portion of the35S-PrPC was converted into a PK-resistant and insoluble PrP molecule similar to the original PrP-res aggregate. These results suggest that these properties of the conversion products are due to the incorporation of 35S-PrP into the pre-existing PrP-res polymer, but not all aggregation or binding of 35S-PrP to PrP-res results in conversion to 35S-PrP-res. Based on these observations, we developed an in situ PrP conversion assay to determine the spatial localization of converting activity in intact TME-infected brain slices. The conversion reaction was performed as described in Fig. 1, except the brain slices were left on the slide and analyzed by film and liquid emulsion autoradiography. Fig. 3 B illustrates conversion of35S-PrPC to 35S-PrP-res in specific anatomical structures in the TME-infected hamster brain but not in the uninfected brain (Fig. 3 A). Brain regions containing the most intense in situ PrP conversion include the thalamus, hippocampus, and the middle cerebral cortical layers (Fig.3 B). Prominent brain structures where there was a minimal amount or absence of PrP conversion activity were the major white matter tracts such as the corpus callosum and the internal capsule. The conversion reaction was not only specific for hamster brain that contained PrP-res deposits but also for the hamster35S-PrPC precursor because no in situ PrP conversion was observed after incubation with murine35S-PrPC (Fig. 3 C). The absence of PrP conversion in the latter case is consistent with the inability of hamster-adapted scrapie to cause experimental disease in mice (29Kimberlin R.H. Walker C.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1978; 39: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 30Kimberlin R.H. Cole S. Walker C.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1987; 68: 1875-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and also the inability of purified hamster PrP-res to convert murine35S-PrPC to a PK-resistant form in the cell-free conversion reaction (23Kocisko D.A. Priola S.A. Raymond G.J. Chesebro B. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3923-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The in situ conversion assay, in which the brain cytoarchitecture is maintained, demonstrates that PrP conversion occurs in specific anatomical structures just as PrP-res deposits are distributed in a distinct pattern in vivo (31Bruce M.E. McBride P.A. Farquhar C.F. Neurosci. Lett. 1989; 102: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). When the distribution of endogenous PrP-res was compared with in situ PrP conversion activity, an excellent correlation was found. Fig. 4 A illustrates a similar distribution of endogenous PrP-res, detected by immunocytochemistry, and35S-PrP conversion activity in the thalamus, hippocampus, and middle cerebral cortical layers. In brain regions that lack PrP-res (e.g. corpus callosum and the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus), no conversion activity was observed, indicating that in situ formation of 35S-PrP-res was PrP-res-dependent and did not redistribute to areas lacking PrP-res deposits. In the reticular thalamic nucleus and ventral posterolateral thalamic nucleus the co-distribution of endogenous PrP-res and PrP conversion activity appeared to be confined to the gray matter and not the white matter tracts traversing these nuclei (Fig.4 B). This co-distribution pattern also appeared to be quantitative because the intensity of immunostaining for pre-existing PrP-res correlated with the relative intensity of in situconversion activity. In Fig. 4 B, the reticular thalamic nucleus contained the highest levels of PrP-converting activity and immunostaining, whereas the internal capsule was limited to a sparse, unicentric distribution. These data indicate that the distribution and amount of PrP-res deposits, and not PrP-independent host factors, were the major determinants for the location and intensity of in situ PrP conversion activity. At the microscopic level, there was also a good correlation between the nature of the PrP-res deposit and the 35S-PrP-res conversion product. PrP-res accumulates into amyloid plaques in specific brain regions in TSE-infected hamsters. One prominent region is the subependymal cell layer adjacent to the lateral ventricles (17DeArmond S.J. McKinley M.P. Barry R.A. Braunfeld M.B. McColloch J.R. Prusiner S.B. Cell. 1985; 41: 221-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). When conversion activity was detected by liquid emulsion autoradiography, the converted 35S-PrP-res products had a punctate pattern in this location (Fig. 4 C), suggesting thatin situ growth of PrP-res plaques had occurred. In brain areas with a diffuse pattern of PrP-res deposition in which there is no defined PrP ultrastructure (32Jeffrey M. Goodsir C.M. Bruce M.E. McBride P.A. Scott J.R. Halliday W.G. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 147: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 33Jeffrey M. Goodsir C.M. Bruce M.E. McBride P.A. Fowler N. Scott J.R. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 174: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the 35S-PrP-res conversion products had a more dispersed pattern (Fig. 4 D). These patterns of in situ conversion precisely mimic endogenous PrP-res deposits regardless of whether the PrP-res had a distinguishable ultrastructure and provide evidence for the incorporation of 35S-PrP directly into endogenous PrP-res. We have used the cell-free and in situ PrP conversion reactions to understand the mechanism involved in the conversion of35S-PrPC into 35S-PrP-res. Thesein vitro models mimic important biochemical and biological aspects of TSE diseases. For one, the cell-free conversion PrP products, like brain-derived PrP-res, are insoluble and truncated by 6–7 kDa compared with the soluble PrPC precursor (Ref. 19Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholarand this study); this provides evidence that the in vitroand in vivo derived PrP-res aggregates have the same conformation. Both the cell-free and in situ PrP conversion reactions exhibit species specificity that is similar to interspecies transmission of scrapie between hamster and mice (Ref. 23Kocisko D.A. Priola S.A.

Virol. 1987; 68: 1875-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and this could be explained at the molecular level by the failure of hamster PrP-res to convert murine 35S-PrPC to a protease-resistant form in both the cell-free (23Kocisko D.A. Priola S.A. Raymond G.J. Chesebro B. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3923-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and in situ PrP conversion reactions. Additional experiments have demonstrated that the susceptibility of sheep to natural scrapie, which is largely influenced by PrP gene polymorphisms, correlates with the effect of PrPC sequence variability in the cell-free conversion reaction (24Bossers A. Belt P.B.G.M. Raymond G.J. Caughey B. de Vries R. Smits M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4931-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). 35S-PrPC derived from two PrP genotypes associated with high susceptibility to scrapie were converted to 35S-PrP-res in the cell-free conversion reaction with much greater efficiency than PrPC from a scrapie-resistant PrP genotype, indicating that this in vitro assay closely parallels important aspects of TSE pathogenesis. Another biological characteristic of TSE diseases that has been modelled using the cell-free conversion reaction is TSE strain diversity (22Bessen R.A. Kocisko D.A. Raymond G.J. Nandan S. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1995; 375: 698-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The protein-only model predicts that inheritance of TSE strain phenotypes is mediated by stable propagation of different PrP-res conformations. The HY and DY TME strains have different size PrP-res fragments and additional strain-specific biochemical properties that indicate the PrP-res from the two strains have distinct three-dimensional conformations (26Bessen R.A. Marsh R.F. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7859-7868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When HY and DY PrP-res are used in the cell-free conversion reaction, they can convert the same35S-PrPC into differently structured PrP-res molecules, indicating that this reaction leads to conformation-specific PrP conversion that is determined by the strain of PrP-res (22Bessen R.A. Kocisko D.A. Raymond G.J. Nandan S. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1995; 375: 698-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). These studies strongly suggest that the molecular basis of TSE strain diversity lies within the conformation of PrP-res. The distinct conformers of PrP-res can self-propagate by a nongenetic mechanism and, because they are linked to the infectious TME agent (26Bessen R.A. Marsh R.F. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7859-7868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), may themselves induce different clinicopathological diseases. These studies demonstrate that the cell-free and in situ PrP conversion reactions are useful models for reconstructing both biochemical and biological aspects of TSE diseases. The in situ PrP conversion assay uses intact brain slices to maintain tissue cytoarchitecture and therefore likely resembles thein vivo process of PrP-res formation. Unlike our previous studies where the purified PrP-res was typically partially unfolded in guanidine hydrochloride prior to the cell-free conversion reaction (19Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A.

Biochem. 1996; 35: 13434-13442Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), PrP-res was not denatured in the in situ PrP conversion, suggesting that native PrP-res structure is capable of inducing conversion in vivo. In situ PrP conversion was PrP-res-dependent, involved binding of35S-PrPC to PrP-res, and resulted in the conversion of soluble, PK-sensitive 35S-PrPCinto an insoluble and PK-resistant PrP molecule. Furthermore, this study directly demonstrated in situ formation of35S-PrP-res at the sites of endogenous PrP-res deposits. The 35S-PrP conversion products were associated with both PrP amyloid plaques, which often consist of radial arrays of PrP-res fibrils and diffuse PrP-res deposits which can consist of individual PrP-res fibrils or have no distinguishable ultrastructural morphology (32Jeffrey M. Goodsir C.M. Bruce M.E. McBride P.A. Scott J.R. Halliday W.G. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 147: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 33Jeffrey M. Goodsir C.M. Bruce M.E. McBride P.A. Fowler N. Scott J.R. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 174: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the mechanism for in situPrP conversion is the same for both types of PrP-res deposits. Our findings strongly suggest that the soluble PrPC precursor is incorporated as a subunit of the PrP-res deposit and results in additional polymerization of the pre-existing PrP-res aggregate. A similar finding has been demonstrated upon incubation of synthetic β-amyloid peptide with brain slices from Alzheimer's disease (35Maggio J.E. Stimson E.R. Ghilardi J.R. Allen C.J. Dahl C.E. Whitcomb D.C. Vigna S.R. Vinters H.V. Labenski M.E. Mantyh P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5462-5466Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar,36Esler W.P. Stimson E.R. Ghilardi J.R.

Several models for PrP-res formation have been proposed, including chaperone-mediated mechanisms (37Liautard J.P.

Nature. 1967; 215: 1043-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 44Prusiner S.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1515-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). The cell-free conversion reaction provides valuable information that can be used to evaluate these models. Based on our studies we think it is unlikely that chaperones are required in the conversion of PrPC to PrP-res because only purified PrP molecules are needed in the cell-free conversion reaction. Treatment of PrP-res with PK prior to the cell-free conversion reaction eliminates most if not all proteins copurifying with PrP-res but does not disrupt conversion activity (20Caughey B. Kocisko D.A. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 807-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 22Bessen R.A. Kocisko D.A. Raymond G.J. Nandan S. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1995; 375: 698-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), suggesting that potential cofactors must also be PK-resistant. However, in the case of yeast prions, the formation of the TSE-like [PSI+] phenotype is dependent on the functional state of the heat shock protein (Hsp)104 chaperone (38Chernoff Y.O. Lindquist S.L. Ono B. Ingevechtomov S.G. Liebman S.W. Science. 1995; 268: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 39Patino M.M. Liu J.J. Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Science. 1996; 273: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) and led to the proposal that Hsp104 acts directly at the step(s) involved in the conversion from the normal [psi−] to the [PSI+] phenotype by partially unfolding the sup35 protein before it aggregates to the [PSI+] phenotype (38Chernoff Y.O. Lindquist S.L. Ono B. Ingevechtomov S.G. Liebman S.W. Science. 1995; 268: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 39Patino M.M. Liu J.J. Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Science. 1996; 273: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). In our cell-free conversion reactions 35S-PrPC is likely denatured by acetic acid during purification but presumably refolds during the conversion reaction. Therefore, prior unfolding of PrPC may mimic the action of Hsp104-like chaperones, raising the possibility that in vivo conversion to PrP-res requires chaperone-assisted unfolding of PrPC. Alternatively, chaperones may mediate proper folding of PrPC (45Edenhofer F. Rieger R. Famulok M. Wendler W. Weiss S. Winnacker E.L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4724-4728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which may be prerequisite for conversion to PrP-res. The cell-free conversion reaction studies indicate that PrP conversion activity is associated with a PrP-res aggregate; monomers or small oligomers of PrP derived from a PrP-res aggregate do not convert35S-PrPC to PrP-res (20Caughey B. Kocisko D.A. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 807-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). PrP-res aggregates containing PrP converting activity are associated with high levels of TSE infectivity. In concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride that result in a reduction of PrP conversion activity there is a coincident loss of TSE infectivity (21Caughey B. Raymond G.J. Kocisko D.A. Lansbury P.T. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4701-4710Crossref Google Scholar). These findings and our present observations that 35S-PrP becomes bound to endogenous PrP-res deposits during in situ PrP conversion are consistent with PrP-res formation based on nucleation-dependent protein polymerization. This is a two-step process that involves nucleus formation and polymerization or growth of the aggregate (41Jarret J.T. Lansbury P.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1055-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar, 42Come J.H. Fraser P.E. Lansbury P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5959-5963Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 46Caspar D.L.D. Biophys. J. 1980; 32: 101-135Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Nucleus formation is rate-limiting under normal physiological conditions due to the kinetic unlikelihood for PrPCmonomers to randomly associate into a small, stable multimers. However, in the presence of a PrP-res aggregate, as in the case of experimental TSE inoculation, the addition of monomeric PrPC to the PrP-res nucleus is stabilized by intermolecular interactions between PrPC and multiple PrP-res molecules at the nucleation site. This can lead to a conformational change of PrPC to PrP-res, growth of the PrP-res polymer and, over time, amyloid fibril formation. In our cell-free conversion reaction we are likely providing the PrP-res aggregate or nucleus that can seed the growth of the PrP polymer by the addition of monomeric PrPC. This model predicts that the location of newly formed 35S-PrP should be at the site of pre-existing PrP-res. In our in situ PrP conversion reaction, the 35S-PrP remained bound to the brain slice in a distribution analogous to that found for endogenous PrP-res. This is consistent with temporal studies in TSE-infected hosts where following initial PrP-res deposition there is additional accumulation of PrP-res in these brain regions (31Bruce M.E. McBride P.A. Farquhar C.F. Neurosci. Lett. 1989; 102: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 47Hecker R. Taraboulos A. Scott M. Pan K.M. Yang S.L. Torchia M. Jendroska K. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1213-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Based on these results we find no evidence to support the heterodimer model (7Griffith J.S. Nature. 1967; 215: 1043-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 44Prusiner S.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1515-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar) for PrP-res assembly. This model predicts that a single PrP-res molecule forms a dimer with monomeric PrPC and induces a conformational change to produce a PrP-res homodimer that then dissociates. In the heterodimer model PrP-res conversion activity would be associated with monomeric PrP-res but in the in situ PrP conversion reaction we do not detect soluble35S-PrP-res. The newly formed 35S-PrP-res co-sediments with the brain-derived PrP-res after centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min, and the soluble35S-PrP remaining in the supernatant fraction was PK-sensitive. Our conclusions are supported by the findings that both PrP-res and TSE infectivity are tightly associated with membrane fractions from TSE-infected brain extracts and not with soluble tissue extracts (48Meyer R.K. McKinley M.P. Bowman K.A. Braunfeld M.B. Barry R.A. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2310-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Furthermore, purified PrP-res is extensively aggregated, insoluble in nondenaturing detergents, and associated with high levels of TSE infectivity (10Diringer H. Gelderblom H. Hilmert H. Ozel M. Edelbluth C. Kimberlin R.H. Nature. 1983; 306: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). These data suggest that if the TSE agent is demonstrated to consist solely of PrP-res, then a PrP-res aggregate or nucleus, but not a monomer, is the infectious form. It is possible that a putative monomeric PrP-res molecule could bind to other macromolecules, such as proteoglycans (49Snow A.D. Kisilevsky R. Willmer J. Prusiner S.B. Dearmond S.J. Acta Neuropathol. 1989; 77: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 50Caughey B. Raymond G.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 643-650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), that may copurify with PrP-res. This could give it the size characteristics of a PrP-res multimer, however, PK treatment of PrP-res preparations prior to the cell-free conversion reaction does not dissociate converting activity from the PrP-res aggregate, so such potential cofactors would have to be PK-resistant (20Caughey B. Kocisko D.A. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 807-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that the self-assembly of amyloidogenic proteins in general proceeds via the heterodimer mechanism, but there is support for nucleation-dependent polymerization (35Maggio J.E.

ICAM-1 functions as an adhesive ligand for leukocytic β2integrins and mediates leukocyte extravasation across vascular endothelial barriers.

ICAM-1 has five extracellular Ig-like domains and numerousN-glycosylations contributing to a molecular mass of 95 kDa. The first two Ig-like domains are critical for binding to αLβ2 (LFA-1) (5Marlin S.D. Springer T.A.

Both Fg and fibrin are able to bind to a variety of plasma and matrix proteins (10Doolittle R.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 195-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Fg and Fg degradation products have been localized in early and late stages of formation of atherosclerotic lesions (11Bini A. Fenoglio Jr., J.J. Mesa-Tejada R. Kudryk B. Kaplan K.L.

Fg is a homodimer of molecular mass 340 kDa, made up of two sets of α, β, and γ polypeptide chains linked through N-terminal regions by interchain disulfide bonds. Upon the proteolytic action of plasmin, Fg is cleaved first to a 260-kDa form of Fg termed fragment X and subsequently to smaller C-terminal Fg fragments D (100 kDa) and a central Fg fragment E (50 kDa) (10Doolittle R.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 195-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). A direct interaction between ICAM-1 and a discrete region of the Fg γ chain has been demonstrated (13Altieri D.C.

A recent report has described a Fg-mediated vasorelaxation of saphenous vein endothelium that was abrogated by treatment of the tissue with antibodies directed against ICAM-1 (15Hicks R.C.J. Golledge J. Mir-Hasseine R. Powell J.T. Nature. 1996; 379: 818-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which suggests that Fg association with ICAM-1 is able to effect a direct physiological response. Fg and fragments of Fg are demonstrated to induce mitogenic activity in T and B lymphocyte cell lines (16Lévesque J.-P. Hatzfeld A. Hatzfeld J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Blood. 1993; 82: 800-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, the mechanism through which Fg mediates this cellular response remains unclear. This report provides evidence that ICAM-1 is a mitogenic Fg receptor on B lymphocytes, and that the observed mitogenic response can be attributed at least in part to discrete amino acid sequences within the Fg γ chain and the first Ig-like domain of ICAM-1.

Anti-ICAM-1 polyclonal antibodies R686 and R803 were prepared and purified in our laboratory from the serum of rabbits injected with Escherichia coli-expressed ICAM-1. The anti-ICAM-1 mAb 84H10 was from AMAC International (Westbrook, ME). This antibody has been reported to block αLβ2/ICAM-1-mediated lymphocyte interactions (20Simmons D. Makgoba M.W. Seed B.

Cheresh (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). mAb1980, mAb1969, and mAb1965 mAbs directed against the integrin subunits αv, α5, and β1, respectively, were obtained from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). MAb KB90 directed against integrin subunit αX (CD11c, P150,95) and MHM23 against β2 integrin subunit were obtained from Dako Corp. (Carpinteria, CA). Antibodies TS1/18 and TS1/22 against β2 and αL subunits, respectively, were from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). ICAM-1-expressing lymphoblastoid Raji cells and 293 cells of human kidney fibroblast origin were obtained from ATCC. Raji were grown in RPMI 1640 (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) containing 7.5% FCS and 1.0 mm glutamine. 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (BioWhittaker) containing 10% FCS and 1.0 mm glutamine. For transfection, 293 cells were washed and plated on 60-mm plastic Petri dishes in medium without FCS. Cells were stably transfected using the calcium-phosphate method with 10–20 μg of purified plasmid DNA isolated from E. coli transfected with pCDM8 containing ICAM-1 cDNA (25Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18211-18216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cells expressing ICAM-1 were detected by incubation with mAb QE2 and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and isolated in a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). Levels of ICAM-1 expression were routinely monitored by FACS analysis. Control and ICAM-1-expressing 293 cells were isolated from culture flasks by brief trypsin treatment. Raji were isolated from culture medium by centrifugation. Each cell type was washed twice in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and once in Hanks' balanced salt solution without divalent cations then resuspended in a staining medium of Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 2.0 mm CaCl2, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were counted and resuspended at 106 cells/ml, and 0.1-ml aliquots were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with 5.0 μg/ml control mouse IgG, anti-αM mAb OKM1, anti-αVβ3 mAbs LM 609 or mAb1980, anti-αX mAb KB90, anti-α5 mAb mAb1969, or anti-ICAM-1 mAbs QE2 or 84H10. Cells were centrifuged through a cushion of FCS and resuspended in staining medium containing 50 μg/ml FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Zymed Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA). Cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged and resuspended in 0.5 ml of staining medium. Cell-bound antibodies were detected using a FACScan, and analysis was performed using the LYSIS II program (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Fg was purified from fresh human plasma by cryoethanol precipitation (26Budzynski A.Z. Marder V.J. Shainoff J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2294-2302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,27Doolittle R.F. Schubert D. Schwartz S.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1967; 118: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Using electrophoretic conditions that allow the separation of fibrin from fibrinogen monomer and subsequent visualization using Coomassie violet R-250 (18Shainoff J.R. Smejkal G.B. DiBello P.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24129-24137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the isolated material was estimated to comprise greater than 95% fibrinogen. Preparations of Fg were also analyzed for the presence of free fibrinopeptides A and B by elution on a Sep-Pak C18 high pressure liquid chromatography column using standard preparations of each of the fibrinopeptides (Sigma). At protein concentrations of at least 50-fold greater than those used in these experiments, amounts of fibrinopeptides A and B were below detectable levels. Fg was radiolabeled with 125I-Na using IODO-BEADS (Pierce) (28Marguerie G.A. Edgington T.S. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 154-161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29D'Souza S.E.

Radiolabeled Fg was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until use. For the preparation of plasmin-digested Fg fragments (26Budzynski A.Z. Marder V.J. Shainoff J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2294-2302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), purified Fg (5.0 mg/ml) was incubated at 37 °C with 8.3 μg/ml plasmin for 1 h (fragment X) and 0.1 mg/ml plasmin for 2 h (fragment D100). Each fragment was purified by ion-exchange chromatography on a column of DEAE-cellulose (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) using an elution buffer of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.4 m NaCl and dialyzed extensively against phosphate-buffered saline. Fg fragment E was isolated as a by-product of fragment D preparations by subjecting these preparations to size exclusion chromatography on a column of Sephacryl S200 (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated with a solution of 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl. Fractions containing Fg fragment E were dialyzed extensively against distilled water and lyophilized. The molecular weights of plasmin digestion products of Fg were verified by electrophoresis on SDS gels. Protein concentrations were adjusted to 1 mg/ml using Iscove's modified Dulbecco's Eagle's medium containing penicillin, streptomycin, 1.0 mm glutamine, and 5 μg/ml transferrin (IMDM) (Life Technologies, Inc.), and stored at −20 °C. The full-length five-domain form of ICAM-1 was ligated into the viral vector PVL1392 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and allowed to recombine with baculoviral genomic DNA (14D'Souza S.E. Byers-Ward V.J.

Truncated ICAM-1 cDNA was generated by polymerase chain reaction using specific primers which annealed to the extreme 5′ region of the cDNA and a region 3′ to cDNA encoding the second IgG-like domain. The 3′ reverse primer contained appropriate sequences for a stop codon and a NotI restriction enzyme site which was unique for cDNA encoding the first two Ig domains of ICAM-1. The nucleotide sequence of the polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA was confirmed, and the DNA was ligated into the baculovirus vector pBlueBacIII using XbaI and NotI restriction sites. Recombinant virus containing vector DNA was purified by repeated plaque purification and used for infection of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells. Sf9 cells were grown in Grace's insect cell media (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 4 days, then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and lysed in 1% (w/v) octyl glucoside in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Expression of intact ICAM-1 or the two domain form of ICAM-1 (D1D2ICAM-1) was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting using ICAM-1-specific antibodies as described previously (14D'Souza S.E. Byers-Ward V.J. Gardiner E.E. Wang H. Sung S.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24270-24277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Full-length ICAM-1 and D1D2 ICAM-1 were purified from Sf9 cell lysates on a Rotofor preparative isoelectric focusing apparatus (Bio-Rad) using a pH gradient of 6–8. Portions of SDS gels containing similar, unstained material were excised, and ICAM-1 proteins were extracted in a buffer of 0.2 mTris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 2% (w/v) SDS and precipitated with 80% (v/v) acetone. The purity of D1D2 ICAM-1 was greater than 90%, as judged by silver staining of SDS gels, and portions of purified D1D2 ICAM-1 were resuspended in IMDM in 1 μm aliquots and stored at −20 °C. In adhesion assays, this protein preparation was able to support the adhesion of 51Cr-labeled peripheral blood lymphocytes and adhesion could be blocked by the anti-β2antibody MHM23. Raji or 293 cells were maintained in appropriate medium without FCS for 24 h prior to commencement of an experiment, to achieve cellular quiescence. Cells were washed twice in IMDM and counted with a hemocytometer. Some cells were preincubated for 30 min with control antibodies or antibodies directed against ICAM-1. Aliquots of 0.2 ml of cells (4 × 105cells/ml) were mixed with 0.2-ml protein solutions diluted with IMDM and 4 μl of [3H]thymidine (1.0 μCi/μl). Cell suspensions (0.1 ml) were aliquoted into four replicate wells of a 96-well flat-bottomed plate (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ), and plates were stored at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 4–24 h. To measure uptake of [3H]thymidine, the contents of each well were transferred to a 96-well plate with v-shaped wells. Cells were isolated from incubation medium by centrifugation (200 ×g/10 min) and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. [3H]Thymidine that had been incorporated into cellular DNA was precipitated by addition of 0.1 ml of 20% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid for 2 h at 4 °C. Trichloroacetic acid pellets were rinsed once and resolubilized in 2% (w/v) SDS solution and assayed for radioactivity in a β-counter. Raji were centrifuged and resuspended three times in Hanks' balanced salt solution and finally in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The number of cells isolated was ascertained using a hemocytometer, and some cell suspensions were preincubated with 25 μg/ml TS1/18 anti-β2 integrin antibody or an anti-ICAM-1 antibody 84H10 for 30 min. Increasing amounts of 125I-labeled Fg were mixed with 0.1 ml of Raji (5 × 106 cells/ml) in a final volume of 0.2 ml. Some cell mixtures also containing a 10–50-fold excess of either unlabeled Fg or transferrin. All cell suspensions were incubated for 30 min at 22 °C. Following incubation, free radioactivity was separated from radioactivity bound to the cell surface by centrifugation at 11,300 × g for 2.5 min through an upper phase of 8% sucrose (0.2 ml) and a lower phase (0.1 ml) containing dibutyl phthalate and dimethyl phthalate (Aldrich) mixed at a proportion of 10:1.05 (33Levesque J.-P. Hatzfeld A. Hatzfeld J. Exp. Cell Res. 1985; 156: 558-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Radioactivity associated with the cell pellet was assayed using a γ-counter. Peptides with amino acid sequences corresponding to regions of ICAM-1 and fibrinogen were synthesized by the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) method on an Applied Biosystems ABI-66 instrument.

Peptides were cleaved from the resin and deprotected using crystalline phenol and thioanisole as described in the instruction manual. Peptides were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. These studies were carried out using the Raji B lymphocyte cell line as these cells demonstrate a constitutive and stable expression of ICAM-1, and are readily grown in suspension culture. FACS analysis of Raji using the anti-ICAM-1 mAb QE2 revealed a constitutive and stable expression of ICAM-1 (Fig. 1 A, panel a) which represented approximately 75% of the levels of ICAM-1 found on endothelial cells upon treatment with tumor necrosis factor-α using mAb QE2 (14D'Souza S.E. Byers-Ward V.J. Gardiner E.E. Wang H. Sung S.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24270-24277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Raji also demonstrated a constitutive expression of αL (panel d); however, binding of Raji by antibodies directed against the α subunits of integrins reported to bind Fg including αV (panel b), α5 (panel c), αM (panel e), and αX (panel f) could not be detected, suggesting negligible levels of the integrin heterodimers αMβ2, αXβ2, αVβ3, or α5β1on Raji.

Fg binding to Raji has been previously reported by others (16Lévesque J.-P. Hatzfeld A. Hatzfeld J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6494-6498Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and we have recently demonstrated that Raji adhesion to Fg was ICAM-1-dependent (14D'Souza S.E. Byers-Ward V.J. Gardiner E.E. Wang H. Sung S.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24270-24277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This finding was confirmed using a soluble Fg binding assay. A specific and saturable binding of 125I-labeled Fg to Raji was observed (Fig. 1 B). 125I-Labeled Fg associated with Raji with a K d of 3 × 10−7m and this association could be competitively blocked by an excess of unlabeled Fg but not an equivalent amount of transferrin. This K d value is comparable to other K d values reported for ICAM-1/Fg interactions (3Languino L.R. Plescia J. Duperray A. Brian A.A. Plow E.F. Geltosky J.E. Altieri D.C. Cell. 1993; 73: 1423-1434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and Fg interactions with Raji cells (16Lévesque J.-P. Hatzfeld A. Hatzfeld J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6494-6498Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Analysis of the 125I-labeled Fg binding data suggested a single class of binding sites on Raji which bound a total of approximately 40,000 molecules/cell. Inclusion of 25 μg/ml anti-ICAM-1 antibody 84H10 completely abrogated specific 125I-labeled Fg binding to Raji, while β2 integrin mAb TS1/18 failed to block125I-labeled Fg binding to Raji. Experiments were designed to investigate consequences of soluble Fg binding to Raji. When purified human Fg was included in the culture medium of serum-depleted Raji, DNA synthesis was stimulated in a time- and dose-dependent manner as measured by incorporation of [3H]thymidine into macromolecules (Fig. 2,A and B). This effect was specific to Fg as inclusion of equivalent amounts of purified fibronectin or transferrin did not induce any proliferative response in Raji (Fig. 2 B). Medium containing 200 nm Fg consistently induced a 2–3-fold increase in DNA synthesis of Raji after 8 h as compared with control Raji cultures incubated in [3H]thymidine-containing medium alone (n= 15). This stimulation represented approximately 120% of the maximal stimulation achieved by incubation of Raji in medium containing 10% FCS after 8 h. After 24 h the Fg-mediated stimulation of Raji was approximately 80% of that observed in cultures of Raji grown in medium containing 10% FCS. A 2-fold increase in Raji cell numbers after 8 h in culture with medium containing Fg was verified by direct cell counting and by measurement of levels of intracellular enzymes (data not shown), confirming that Fg had induced a cellular proliferation. Similar amounts of fibrin-free Fg induced a response in Raji identical to results presented in Fig. 2, A andB, confirming that Fg was the mitogenic component. A putative mitogenic Fg receptor of approximately 92 kDa was isolated from Raji but not conclusively identified (38Levesque J.-P. Hatzfeld J. Hatzfeld A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 328-333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As fibrinogen and ICAM-1 are known to interact, and ICAM-1 is present on Raji cell surfaces, we investigated whether the mitogenic Fg receptor on Raji was ICAM-1. Fig. 2 C shows that preincubation of Raji with 20 μg/ml anti-ICAM-1 mAb 84H10 before the addition of 200 nmFg resulted in a 91% inhibition of Fg-induced incorporation of [3H]thymidine by these cells. The mAb 84H10 has been reported to block αLβ2-dependent binding (20Simmons D. Makgoba M.W. Seed B. Nature. 1988; 331: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar,21Makgoba M.W. Sanders M.E.

It does this by synthesizing a number of polypeptides that it transports into the red cell cytoplasm and to the red cell membrane. One of these transported proteins, MESA (mature parasite-infected erythrocyte surfaceantigen), is anchored to the red cell membrane by noncovalent interaction with erythrocyte protein 4.1. We have utilized a combination of in vitro transcription and translation and a membrane binding assay to identify the protein sequence involved in anchoring MESA to the membrane. Labeled fragments of different regions of the MESA protein were evaluated for their ability to bind to inside-out vesicle membrane preparations of human red cells. Binding was dependent on the presence of red cell membrane proteins and was abolished either by trypsin treatment or by selective depletion of membrane proteins. Binding was specific and could be inhibited by the addition of competing protein, with an IC50 of (6.3 ± 1.2) × 10−7m, indicative of a moderate affinity interaction. Fractionation studies demonstrated that binding fragments interacted most efficiently with membrane protein fractions that had been enriched in protein 4.1. Binding inhibition experiments using synthetic peptides identified the binding domain of MESA for protein 4.1 as a 19-residue sequence near the amino terminus of MESA, a region capable of forming an amphipathic helix.

The ordered arrangement of spectrin tetramers, their interconnection at the ternary complex (with actin and protein 4.1), and the linkages to the overlying cell membrane via band 3 and glycophorin C provide the basis for the cell's ability to deform during passage through the microcirculation (4Gardner K. Bennett G.V. Agre P. Parker J.C. Red Blood Cell Membranes. Marcel Dekker, New York1989: 1-29Google Scholar, 5Bennett V. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The stability of the spectrin network is influenced by factors such as the primary sequence of the component proteins and levels of protein phosphorylation (6Ling E. Danilov Y.N. Cohen C.M. J. Biol.

This understanding of the relationship of the protein network to properties of the whole cell has been advanced by the study of pathological states of red cells in which specific protein interactions have been altered. These include inherited disorders of red cells such as hemoglobinopathies, hereditary spherocytosis, elliptocytosis, and ovalocytosis. We now recognize that the maturation of the intracellular malaria parasite also results in a series of dramatic and extensive changes in the structural and functional properties of the red cell (reviewed in Refs. 8Sherman I.W.

These changes include loss of the normal discoid shape as the infected cell becomes spherocytic and its surface is punctuated by 5,000–10,000 localized, electron-dense elevations of the red cell membrane called knobs (16Aikawa M. Hsieh C.L. Miller L.H. J. Parasitol. 1977; 63: 152-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 17Aikawa M. Miller L.H. CIBA Found. Symp. 1983; 94: 45-63PubMed Google Scholar, 18Gruenberg J. Allred D. Sherman I. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 795-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). There is increased permeability of the infected red cell to a wide variety of substrates including essential amino acids, phospholipid precursors (19Ancelin M.L. Parant M. Thuet M.J. Philippot J.R.

Haematol. 1984; 58: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). There are changes in the membrane mechanical properties of the cell with a marked increase in rigidity in red cells infected with mature parasites, and the state of phosphorylation of membrane skeletal proteins is also changed. Strikingly, the infected cells become adhesive for a number of other cells including endothelial cells, normal red cells, and lymphocytes. These changes are important for the survival of the parasite, and in their absence, the parasite dies, or parasitized red cells are rapidly eliminated (11Howard R.J. Prog. Allergy. 1988; 41: 98-147PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hommel M. David P.H. Oligino L.D. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 157: 1137-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 25David P.H. Hommel M. Miller L.H. Udeinya I.J. Oligino L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5075-5079Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Crucial to these changes are the export of a group of proteins of parasite origin into the red cell cytoplasm and to the red cell membrane. This latter group of parasite proteins associates with the red cell membrane skeleton either by deposition on the inner aspect of the membrane or by transient or more permanent insertion into the membrane. One such exported protein is MESA (mature parasite-infected erythrocyte surfaceantigen), a 250–300-kDa phosphoprotein produced early in the trophozoite stage and found in association with the red cell membrane skeleton (26Coppel R.L. Culvenor J.G. Bianco A.E. Crewther P.E. Stahl H.D. Brown G.V. Anders R.F. Kemp D.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 20: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 27Howard R.F. Stanley H.A.

Parasitol. 1988; 27: 207-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). MESA interacts with the internal aspect of the host erythrocyte membrane and is not exposed on the external surface, although in late stage schizonts, it becomes accessible to external surface-labeling agents such as lactoperoxidase (28Howard R.J. Barnwell J.W. Rock E.P. Neequaye J. Ofori A.D. Maloy W.L. Lyon J.A. Saul A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 27: 207-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 29Coppel R.L. Lustigman S. Murray L. Anders R.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 31: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of MESA has been reported, and MESA is composed of sets of extensive repeat regions interspersed with nonrepetitive sequences. Lustigman et al. (30Lustigman S. Anders R.F. Brown G.V. Coppel R.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 38: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) showed that MESA was coprecipitated with the functionally important erythrocyte skeletal component protein 4.1, suggesting that it was anchored in the membrane skeleton by noncovalent linkage to protein 4.1. Further evidence for this association was provided by studies of malaria infection in mutant red cells with complete deficiency of protein 4.1. In such cells, the distribution of MESA was altered in that it was no longer membrane-bound, but was randomly distributed throughout the red cell cytoplasm (31Magowan C. Coppel R.L. Lau A. Moronne M.M. Tchernia G. Mohandas N. Blood. 1995; 86: 3196-3204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein 4.1 plays a critical role in maintaining the mechanical integrity of the red cell membrane through its interaction with spectrin and actin (32Bennett V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 273-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Marchesi V.T. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 531-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 34Conboy J.G. Semin. Haematol. 1993; 30: 58-73PubMed Google Scholar). Protein 4.1 also plays a role in attachment of the skeleton to the membrane by anchoring the spectrin network to the integral protein glycophorin C (35Chasis J.A. Mohandas N. Blood. 1992; 80: 1869-1879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of the MESA-protein 4.1 interaction in parasite biology has not been clearly delineated, although it appears to be essential for the survival of the parasite in that malaria parasites cannot survive if MESA is unable to bind protein 4.1 and remains free in the red cell cytoplasm (31Magowan C. Coppel R.L. Lau A. Moronne M.M. Tchernia G. Mohandas N. Blood. 1995; 86: 3196-3204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further our understanding of the interaction between protein 4.1 and MESA, we set out to determine the precise molecular domains involved in this interaction. In this paper, we describe the identification of a sequence in MESA that interacts strongly with the red cell membrane skeleton. We mapped the binding domain of MESA to a 19-residue sequence near the amino terminus of the protein, which appears to form an amphipathic α-helix. Protein fractionation studies demonstrate that this sequence binds most strongly to red cell membrane proteins enriched in protein 4.1. P. falciparum asexual stage parasites were grown in vitroas described by Trager and Jensen (36Trager W. Jensen J. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6185) Google Scholar). P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes were grown in a 2–5% hematocrit to a maximum parasitemia of 20%. Cultured parasites were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, harvested, and immunoprecipitated as described (30Lustigman S. Anders R.F. Brown G.V. Coppel R.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 38: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Rabbit antibodies against the hexapeptide amino-terminal repeat of the MESA sequence were generated as described (26Coppel R.L. Culvenor J.G. Bianco A.E. Crewther P.E. Stahl H.D. Brown G.V. Anders R.F. Kemp D.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 20: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Erythrocyte cell pellets were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with a 10-pellet volume of TNET (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (10 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml chymostatin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin). Triton X-100-insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was kept as the Triton X-100-soluble material. The Triton X-100-insoluble pellet was solubilized in 50 μl of 2% SDS in PBS 1The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; IOV, inside-out vesicle; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Afterward, 50 μl of 2% Triton X-100 and 400 μl of TNET were added (final concentrations of 0.2% SDS and 0.7% Triton X-100). Immunoprecipitations were performed as described (30Lustigman S. Anders R.F. Brown G.V. Coppel R.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 38: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To ∼1 ml of fresh washed red blood cells, 25 ml of ice-cold 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, was added and mixed by inversion. The cells were spun in a Sorvall centrifuge at 8,000 × g for 10 min. This procedure was repeated until the supernatant was free of hemoglobin (two to three times). The cell pellet, composed of red cell ghosts, was resuspended in 1.5 ml of incubation buffer (138 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 6.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm NaH2PO4, and 5 mm glucose). To make inside-out vesicles, 20 ml of 0.5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, was mixed with the cell ghosts, incubated on ice for 30 min, and pelleted by centrifugation at 8,000 × g. 500 μl of 0.5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, was added to the pellet, and the suspension was passed through a 26-gauge needle seven times. The vesicles were resuspended in 10 ml of 0.5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, and the mixture was centrifuged in a Sorvall centrifuge at 8,000 × g. The vesicles were resuspended in 1.5 ml of incubation buffer and stored at 4 °C until used. The binding assay involved coating the wells of a polyvinyl chloride tray with IOVs by loading the IOV preparation into individual wells and incubating the tray at 4 °C overnight, followed by a 2-h incubation with 1% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. An aliquot of TnT 35S-labeled MESA fragment in 50 μl of incubation buffer supplemented with 10 mm l-methionine was added to each well and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The wells were then washed three times with incubation buffer, and the bound MESA fragments were removed using heated (>70 °C) SDS sample buffer. MESA DNA fragments were amplified by PCR amplification methods and directly cloned in frame into the PvuII site of the pRSET vectors. Conditions were used to maximize fidelity of amplification, including low numbers of cycles and a low concentration of enzyme and deoxyoligonucleotides. The oligonucleotide primers used in each reaction are listed in Table I. Orientation of the clone was determined by PCR DNA amplification and restriction enzyme digestion of DNA and was confirmed by automated double-stranded DNA sequencing. pRSET/MESA constructs were sequenced using the PRISM Ready Reaction Dye Deoxy Terminator Cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA) and the ABI Model 373A DNA sequencing system (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing studies on the recombinant clones did not reveal any PCR-generated changes in nucleotide sequence. Positive recombinants were purified by alkaline lysis and CsCl2 gradient centrifugation.Table IOligonucleotide primers used to construct fragments of the mesa geneFragmentPrimersBoundaries of fragment, nucleotides (residues)F1M5, ATGGATATCTATACGAATTGTGAA502 –1399M9, CTGTTATCTTCAGGTTTTTCTG(51 –349)F2M10, CCAAAAAATTAACAGAACAA1574 –1837M11, CATTTTTTTCAGTATTAGC(408 –495)F3M5, ATGGATATCTATACGAATTGTGAA502 –1837M11, CATTTTTTTCAGTATTAGC(51 –495)F3.3M7, GGGGTTCGGTTGTTACAG707 –1399M9, CTGTTATCTTCAGGTTTTTCTG(119 –349)F3.4M8, GAATCCGATGTAGAAAAGGCA880 –1399M9, CTGTTATCTTCAGGTTTTTCTG(176 –349)F3.5M7, GGGGTTCGGTTGTTACAG707 –1837M11, CATTTTTTTCAGTATTAGC(119 –495)F3.7M5, ATGGATATCTATACGAATTGTGAA502 –781M6, TTTCGGATTCTTGCATTT(51 –143)F4M12, ATGGCTAATACTGAAAAAAATGAT1819 –2937M13, TACTTTTTCCTGTTTTGTCAC(490 –862)F5M14, ATGGTGACAAAACAGGAAAAAGTA2917 –4465M15, GTACCAAACCTGATGTAT(856 –1371)F6M16, ATACATCAGGTTTGGTAC4448 –4995M17, CAGTTGAAATCAAATAA(1366 –1526)MESA fragment boundaries are defined by nucleotide and residue positions using the numbering given by Coppel (38Coppel R.L.

In vitro transcription and translation were performed in a TnT rabbit reticulocyte lysate expression system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocols. A typical reaction mixture included 25 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate, 2 μl of TnT reaction buffer, 1 μl of T7 RNA polymerase, 1 μl of amino acid mixture minus methionine, 4 μl of Tran35S-label (1,000 mCi/mmol at 10 mCi/ml; ICN Amersham, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom), 1 μl of RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor (40 units/μl), and 0.2–2 μg of DNA template, to a final volume of 50 μl in nuclease-free water. The mixture was incubated for 120 min at 30 °C, and the translation products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Overnight cultures (60 ml) of Escherichia coli (JM109) transformed with recombinant pGEX plasmids were diluted 1:10 in fresh Luria broth containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin and grown for 1 h at 37 °C. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 1 mm, and the culture was grown for a further 3–4 h. After centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended in PBS, lysed by sonication, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then passed through a column containing 2 ml of preswollen glutathione-agarose beads equilibrated with PBS. The column was washed with 100 ml of PBS. Fusion protein was eluted by competition with 5 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Overnight cultures (60 ml) of E. coli (JM109DE3) transformed with the recombinant pRSET construct were diluted 1:10 in fresh Luria broth containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin and grown at 37 °C toA 560 nm = 0.6–0.8. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm and further incubated with shaking for 3–8 h at 37 °C. After centrifugation, the cell culture was pelleted, snap-frozen in dry ice, and stored at −70 °C until purification. The pellet was thawed at room temperature, resuspended in 20 ml of guanidine lysis buffer (6 m guanidine HCl and 0.1m KPO4, pH 7.4), and mixed by rotation for 1–2 h at room temperature. The lysate was sonicated and transferred to a 30-ml Corex tube and pelleted (8,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was carefully transferred to a small 40-ml tube and repelleted (12,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was transferred to a 50-ml tube and stored at −70 °C or used immediately for affinity purification of the recombinant peptides. A 2-ml bed volume column of Ni2+/nitrilotriacetic acid absorbent was prepared and equilibrated with guanidine lysis buffer. A 20-ml supernatant sample was diluted to 100 ml with guanidine lysis buffer and passed twice over the column. Four washes followed: 50 ml of guanidine lysis buffer; 50 ml of 1 m guanidine HCl, 1m NaCl, and 50 mm KPO4, pH 7.4; 50 ml of 1 m NaCl and 50 mm KPO4, pH 7.4; and 100 ml of low salt buffer (30 mm NaCl and 50 mm KPO4, pH 7.4). The column was washed with additional low salt buffer until the A 280 nm of the wash was <0.005. To elute the bound recombinant protein from the column, 5 ml of 100 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, was added; 1-ml fractions were collected; and the A 280 nmreading was measured. The Ni2+ was removed by extensive dialysis against PBS. The proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Fresh blood (50 ml) was used to make IOVs as described above, and equal amounts of IOVs were treated with high ionic strength buffer (5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, and 1m KCl) to elute the peripheral proteins from the vesicle membrane. The eluate was dialyzed to 20 mm KCl and 5 mm phosphate buffer and passed over a DEAE-Sephadex column (Pharmacia, Uppsala). Increasingly higher ionic strength KCl solutions (50, 80, and 165 mm KCl) in 5 mm phosphate buffer were used to elute bound protein fractions from the column. Each of the fractions was dialyzed against PBS over 2 days and stored at −70 °C. Samples were separated by denaturing SDS-PAGE, and the gels were stained with silver nitrate (37Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar). Overlapping synthetic peptides of the MESA F3.7 region were purchased from Chiron Mimotopes (Clayton, Australia). Peptides were >95% pure and of the correct sequence as measured by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and ion-spray mass spectroscopy. Peptides were solubilized prior to use in the binding assays. Previous work demonstrated that rabbit antibodies raised against the repeat region of MESA were capable of immunoprecipitating two proteins from infected red cells that had been biosynthetically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (30Lustigman S. Anders R.F. Brown G.V. Coppel R.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 38: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The two coprecipitated proteins were identified as MESA and the red cell membrane skeletal protein protein 4.1 on the basis of molecular mass determination and characteristic peptide mapping profiles (30Lustigman S. Anders R.F. Brown G.V. Coppel R.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 38: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We set out to determine whether MESA would be coprecipitated from labeled lysates of infected cells by an antiserum to protein 4.1. P. falciparum lines D6-1, D6--3, and D10 and uninfected red blood cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. Both D6-3 and D10 express MESA; however, D6-1 is a laboratory-derived, mutant parasite line that has undergone a spontaneous deletion of a region of chromosome 5 that encompasses the MESA-coding sequence and consequently does not express MESA. Parasite lysates were successively solubilized in Triton X-100 and SDS to yield fractions of Triton X-100-soluble and Triton X-100-insoluble proteins. These fractions were then immunoprecipitated with various antisera, including a polyclonal rabbit anti-MESA antiserum, a polyclonal rabbit anti-protein 4.1 antiserum, and normal rabbit serum. The MESA antiserum was raised against the hexapeptide sequence GESKET, a highly conserved repeating unit found in the most NH2-terminal repeat domain of MESA (38Coppel R.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 50: 335-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). MESA in isolates D10 and D6-3 was found predominantly in the Triton X-100-insoluble phase, due to its association with the erythrocyte membrane (Fig.1 A). No phosphorylated proteins in uninfected red blood cells or D6-1 were immunoprecipitable with the polyclonal rabbit anti-GESKET antiserum. Phosphorylated protein 4.1 was coprecipitated with MESA in D10 and, to a lesser extent, in D6-3, but not in D6-1 (Fig. 1 A). In parallel experiments, lysates of32P-labeled D6-1 (−MESA) and D6-3 (+MESA) cultures were solubilized in Triton X-100 and immunoprecipitated with anti-protein 4.1 antibodies. A number of proteins of varying molecular mass were coprecipitated. These included the red cell proteins spectrin (240 and 220 kDa), actin (43 kDa), and protein 4.1 (80 kDa). In addition, there was a phosphoprotein of >250 kDa precipitated in D6-3 (+MESA) parasites, but not in D6-1 (−MESA) parasites, that comigrated with MESA (Fig. 1 B). We conclude that there is an association between MESA and protein 4.1 in infected red cells that results in coprecipitation of the two proteins by antiserum to either MESA or protein 4.1. We set out to identify sequences in MESA responsible for its association with the red cell membrane skeleton. The pRSET expression system (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) was chosen because it offered several advantages including easy purification of the fusion protein under native or denaturing conditions and in vitro labeling and expression of the very same construct. The coupled transcription/translation TnT rabbit reticulocyte lysate system from Promega was used to express MESA constructs termed IVTT (i n vitro transcription and translation). This system provided us with a simple and reliable cell-free transcription and translation system for the expression of MESA polypeptides. Certain experimental approaches were not available to us due to peculiarities of the MESA protein. It was not feasible to purify native MESA from infected red cells due to the relatively low amounts of this protein in infected cells. Furthermore, the insolubility of membrane-bound MESA in non-ionic detergents precluded the use of lysates of infected cells in direct binding assays. The full-length mesa gene is extremely unstable in prokaryotic cloning vectors, and we were therefore unable to undertake studies in which the full-length protein could be used in binding studies. Accordingly, we adopted an approach in which stable fragments of the MESA protein were cloned into the RNA transcription vector pRSET. RNA produced in this manner was translated in an in vitrotranslation system in the presence of [35S]methionine, and the labeled protein was used for binding assays. Although there was some variability in the yield of any particular MESA fragment, all fragments gave readily detectable amounts of radiolabeled product (data not shown). Variation in strength of labeling between fragments appears to be due both to differences in the number of methionine residues in particular sequences and to intrinsic differences in the efficiency of transcription and translation of individual constructs. Translation products consisted of the full-length product and, in some constructs, a series of bands of lower molecular mass (data not shown), which we interpret to be fragments that resulted from premature termination, internal initiation, or perhaps proteolytic degradation. All translated fragments exhibited a lower mobility than expected for their molecular mass, presumably reflecting their highly charged sequences, a finding that is very common for malaria proteins as a group (39Anders R.F. Coppel R.L. Brown G.V. Kemp D.J. Prog. Allergy. 1988; 41: 148-172PubMed Google Scholar). For the binding assay, we chose to vary the amount of added translation products so that approximately equal amounts of labeled material (as judged from autoradiographs of gels of electrophoretically separated translation products) were added to each aliquot of red cell membrane preparation (data not shown). We elected to study the binding of MESA to the red cell membrane skeleton by examining the interaction of labeled fragments with IOVs prepared from uninfected red cells. We chose IOVs as they provide a convenient and accessible preparation of erythrocyte membrane and skeletal proteins that are present in combinations that approximate those found in vivo. Thus, there may be particular constraints on the conformation or accessibility of regions of the skeletal proteins that are better approximated in IOV preparations than in isolated proteins, and these would provide a more suitable binding target for our initial studies. To assess which part of the MESA protein contained a binding domain for IOVs, six pRSET/MESA polypeptide constructs encompassing the whole second exon of the mesa gene sequence were radiolabeled by IVTT and added to aliquots of IOVs. The first exon, which encodes 50 residues, is believed to contain a signal sequence that is removed from the mature MESA polypeptide (38Coppel R.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 50: 335-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Bound fragments (F1–F6) from parallel reactions were eluted, pooled, and subjected to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). Autoradiographs of the recovered products revealed that MESA F3 (residues 51–496) and its subfragment F1 showed specific affinity for IOVs (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and3). This suggested that the MESA F1 polypeptide contained a domain that mediates the interaction of MESA with the erythrocyte membrane or skeleton. No MESA fragments that lacked MESA F1 sequence (i.e. MESA F2 and F4–F6) showed detectable binding, suggesting that at least by this assay, the only membra"
https://openalex.org/W1997577244,"Endopeptidase 24.16 or mitochondrial oligopeptidase, abbreviated here as EP 24.16 (MOP), is a thiol- and metal-dependent oligopeptidase that is found in multiple intracellular compartments in mammalian cells. From an analysis of the corresponding gene, we found that the distribution of the enzyme to appropriate subcellular locations is achieved by the use of alternative sites for the initiation of transcription. The pig EP 24.16 (MOP) gene spans over 100 kilobases and is organized into 16 exons. The core protein sequence is encoded by exons 5–16 which match perfectly with exons 2–13 of the gene for endopeptidase 24.15, another member of the thimet oligopeptidase family. These two sets of 11 exons share the same splice sites, suggesting a common ancestor. Multiple species of mRNA for EP 24.16 (MOP) were detected by the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends and they were shown to have been generated from a single gene by alternative choices of sites for the initiation of transcription and splicing. Two types of transcript were prepared, corresponding to transcription from distal and proximal sites. Their expression in vitro in COS-1 cells indicated that they encoded two isoforms (long and short) which differed only at their amino termini: the long form contained a cleavable mitochondrial targeting sequence and was directed to mitochondria; the short form, lacking such a signal sequence, remained in the cytosol. The complex structure of the EP 24.16 (MOP) gene thus allows, by alternative promoter usage, a fine transcriptional regulation of coordinate expression, in the different subcellular compartments, of the two isoforms arising from a single gene. Endopeptidase 24.16 or mitochondrial oligopeptidase, abbreviated here as EP 24.16 (MOP), is a thiol- and metal-dependent oligopeptidase that is found in multiple intracellular compartments in mammalian cells. From an analysis of the corresponding gene, we found that the distribution of the enzyme to appropriate subcellular locations is achieved by the use of alternative sites for the initiation of transcription. The pig EP 24.16 (MOP) gene spans over 100 kilobases and is organized into 16 exons. The core protein sequence is encoded by exons 5–16 which match perfectly with exons 2–13 of the gene for endopeptidase 24.15, another member of the thimet oligopeptidase family.

Metalloendopeptidases form a large family of peptidases that have a His-Glu-X-X-His (HEXXH) zinc-binding motif and preferentially cleave short substrates. For example, endopeptidase 24.15 (EP1 24.15), a member of this family, acts on peptides of 6–18 amino acid residues and exhibits no or only very weak proteolytic activity against proteins (1Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. Int. J. Biochem. 1985; 17: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 2Tisljar U. Biol. Chem.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 529-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Among the members of this family, thimet oligopeptidase (TOP or EP 24.15) 1The abbreviations used are: TOP, thimet oligopeptidase; EP, endopeptidase; MOP, oligopeptidase M; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; bp, base pair(s); SINE(s), short interspersed repetitive element(s); RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; nt, nucleotide(s). and oligopeptidase M (MOP or EP 24.16) are unique in their sensitivities to thiol reagents and they constitute a subfamily, the thimet (thiol- andmetal-dependent) oligopeptidase subfamily. Recent molecular cloning revealed the presence of a cysteine residue unique to members of this subfamily near position 483. This residue is absent from the other members that exhibit no thiol dependence (4Pierotti A. Dong K.W. Glucksman M.J. Orlowski M. Roberts J.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10323-10329Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 5Orlowski M. Reznik S. Ayala J. Pierotti A.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 951-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition to the members of this family of mammalian origin, certain oligopeptidases of microbial origin that belong to this family have also been identified, including oligopeptidase A (OpdA) and dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase (Dcp) of Escherichia coli andSalmonella typhimurium (6Conlin C.A. Miller C.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), peptidase F of Lactococcus lactis (7Monnet V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 579-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), mitochondrial intermediate peptidase of rat and yeast (8Isaya G. Kalousek F. Rosenberg L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8317-8321Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 9Isaya G. Miklos D. Rollins R.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 5603-5616Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and saccharolysin (YCL57w or proteinase yscD) of yeast (10Buchler M. Tisljar U. Wolf D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This report deals with the two best characterized mammalian enzymes, namely, EP 24.15 (TOP) and EP 24.16 (MOP), which are members of the thimet oligopeptidase family. This family has also been called the M3 family of metalloendopeptidases in the classification of Rawlings and Barrett (11Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 12Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). EP 24.15 (TOP) was first identified as a collagenase-like peptidase or Pz-peptidase in experiments with the Pz-peptide that was originally designed by Wünsch and Heidrich (13Wünsch E. Heidrich H.-G. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1963; 333: 149-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) as a substrate for collagenase. Although the Pz-peptide was a good substrate for clostridial collagenase, it turned out not to be a substrate for avian and mammalian collagenases (14Harper E. Gross J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 198: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The Pz-peptide hydrolyzing activities found in avian and mammalian tissues have, therefore, been designated collagenase-like peptidases or simply Pz-peptidases. Independent studies on the metabolism of brain peptides led to the discovery of two enzymes: one was described by Camargo et al. (15Camargo A.C. Ramalho-Pinto F.J. Greene L.J. J. Neurochem. 1972; 19: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) in 1972 and was named neutral endopeptidase and, later, endo-oligopeptidase A; and the other, first described by Orlowski et al. (16Orlowski M. Michaud C. Chu T.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 135: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) in 1983, was initially named soluble metalloendopeptidase and subsequently endopeptidase 24.15. All these enzymes turned out to be the same and are now known as thimet oligopeptidase (17Barrett A.J. Brown M.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this report we use the abbreviated designation EP 24.15 (TOP). cDNA sequences for the mammalian enzyme are now available for the rat (4Pierotti A. Dong K.W. Glucksman M.J. Orlowski M. Roberts J.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10323-10329Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 18McKie N. Dando P.M. Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 19Pierotti A. Dong K.W. Glucksman M.J. Orlowski M. Roberts J.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 622Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), pig (20Kato A. Sugiura N. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and human (21Thompson A. Huber G. Malherbe P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). EP 24.16 (MOP) was also discovered independently in several different laboratories. 1) Heidrich et al. (22Heidrich H.-G. Prokopova D. Hanning K. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1969; 350: 1430-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) demonstrated a Pz-peptide hydrolyzing activity in a mitochondrial fraction of rat liver, which was later shown to be distinct from EP 24.15 (TOP) by both biochemical characterization (23Tisljar U. Barrett A.J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 264: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and partial amino acid sequencing of the purified enzyme; it was named oligopeptidase M (24Serizawa A. Dando P.M. Barrett A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2092-2098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). 2) We (25Hagiwara H. Sugiura N. Wakita K. Hirose S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and Kiron and Soffer (26Kiron M.A.R. Soffer R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) identified a soluble angiotensin-binding protein in pig and rabbit liver during the course of studies aimed at identifying hepatic receptors for angiotensin II. After our publication of the cDNA sequence of the binding protein from pig (27Sugiura N. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18067-18072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), McKieet al. (18McKie N. Dando P.M. Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) pointed out the strong similarity between our sequence and that of rat EP 24.15 (TOP) which had been determined by Pierotti et al. (4Pierotti A. Dong K.W. Glucksman M.J. Orlowski M. Roberts J.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10323-10329Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 19Pierotti A. Dong K.W. Glucksman M.J. Orlowski M. Roberts J.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 622Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We then obtained a second cDNA clone which was very similar to but clearly different from that of the cDNA for the binding protein, and we showed that the second clone represented the pig homolog of rat EP 24.15 (TOP) (20Kato A. Sugiura N. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The angiotensin-binding protein, although originally identified as a binding protein, did indeed have thiol- and metal-dependent oligopeptidase activity (20Kato A. Sugiura N. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). At that time, therefore, the binding protein appeared to represent a new member of the thimet oligopeptidase family since the amino acid sequence of oligopeptidase M or EP 24.16 (MOP) from no mammalian species had yet been determined. 3) Kawabataet al. (28Kawabata S. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10331-10336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kawabata S. Nakagawa K. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12498-12503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) isolated an endopeptidase and the corresponding cDNA clone as a candidate for an enzyme responsible for the post-transcriptional processing of γ-carboxyglutamic acid-containing blood coagulation factors. They failed to notice the strong similarity to our binding protein, which was later pointed out by McKie et al. (18McKie N. Dando P.M. Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 4) Checler et al. (20Kato A. Sugiura N. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 31Checler F. Emson P.C. Vincent J.P. Kitabgi P. J. Neurochem. 1984; 43: 1295-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) demonstrated the presence of a novel proteolytic activity capable of inactivating neurotensin. They purified the peptidase from rat brain synaptic membranes and characterized it (32Checler F. Vincent J.-P. Kitabgi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11274-11281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme, termed neurolysin or endopeptidase 24.16, was shown to be distinct from EP 24.15 (TOP) and neprilysin (also known as enkephalinase or endopeptidase 3.4.24.11) and to have a relatively broad substrate-specificity and tissue distribution. Recent determination of its amino acid sequence by cDNA cloning clearly indicated that neurolysin is identical to the three enzymes mentioned above (33Dauch P. Vincent J.-P. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27266-27271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, four separate lines of research have converged in the discovery of a single new member of the thimet oligopeptidase family. In this report we use the abbreviation EP 24.16 (MOP) for this protein, whose identity has been only recently established. EP 24.15 (TOP) and EP 24.16 (MOP) are very similar in terms of size and enzymatic properties: both are intracellular proteins of 78–80 kDa, consisting of about 680–700 amino acids, and their sequences are 65% homologous (20Kato A. Sugiura N. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). They are, however, clearly distinguishable in several respects. For example, they have different specificities for inhibitors, different immunoreactivity, and different cleavage-site specificities. EP 24.15 (TOP) hydrolyzes neurotensin exclusively at the Arg-Arg bond whereas EP 24.16 (MOP) cleaves it at the Pro-Tyr bond (16Orlowski M. Michaud C. Chu T.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 135: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar,24Serizawa A. Dando P.M. Barrett A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2092-2098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 32Checler F. Vincent J.-P. Kitabgi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11274-11281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another difference is found in the subcellular localizations of these enzymes. EP 24.15 (TOP) is found in the cytosol while EP 24.16 (MOP) is found in both the cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments. How can the product of a single gene be localized to more than one intracellular compartment? To answer this question and to characterize evolutionary relationships among the members of the thimet oligopeptidase family, we investigated the structural organization of the pig genes for EP 24.15 (TOP) and EP 24.16 (MOP) and of their 5′-proximal flanking regions. We discovered six species of mRNA for EP 24.16 (MOP) that are generated from one single gene as a result of the utilization of alternative sites for the initiation of transcription. The six species of mRNA can be classified into two categories: those containing an additional sequence that encodes a mitochondrial targeting sequence and those that lack such a sequence. The use of different promoters for the eventual targeting of proteins to appropriate subcellular compartments appears to be a useful mechanism for adjustment of local concentrations of proteins that function at different intracellular sites in response to the physiological requirements of the cell. The 5′-ends of cDNAs for EP 24.16 (MOP) were cloned with the 5′-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) system (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Two μg of poly(A)+ RNA, isolated from pig liver (27Sugiura N. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18067-18072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were reverse-transcribed with a specific primer for the cDNA for pig EP 24.16 (MOP), 5RA-1 (5′-GTCTAGCATGGTTCGTTCC-3′), and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. The first-strand cDNA was ligated at the 3′-end with an anchor (5′-CACGAATTCACTATCGATTCTGGAACCTTCAGAGG-3′) by T4 RNA ligase. A nested specific primer for the cDNA for EP 24.16 (MOP), 5RA-2 (5′-CCGTCTACACCTTCACTTC-3′), was used with an anchor primer (5′-CTGGTTCGGCCCACCTCTGAAGGTTCCAGAATCGATAG-3′) for amplification of the 5′-ends of the cDNAs by polymerase chain reaction. The products of polymerase chain reaction were fractionated on a 3% agarose gel, and fragments of 300–650 bp were isolated and cloned into pBluescript II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Positive clones were identified by colony hybridization, with the 32P-labeledEcoRI-EcoRV 592-bp fragment of PAB-L1 (27Sugiura N. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18067-18072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as probe, and sequenced. DNA was sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method of Sanger et al. (34Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar) with double-stranded plasmids as templates. Termination reactions were performed with SequiTherm DNA polymerase (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI) and IRD41-labeled M13 universal or reverse primer (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). The products were analyzed with a DNA sequencer (model 4000; LI-COR). Sequences were organized and analyzed with GENETYX-MAC program (Software Development, Tokyo, Japan). A pig liver genomic library constructed in λEMBL3 SP6/T7 (CLONTECH) was screened with the 2.7-kilobaseEcoRI-EcoRI fragment of a cDNA for EP 24.16 (MOP) clone (PAB-L1) (27Sugiura N. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18067-18072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or with the 2.5-kilobase pairEcoRI-EcoRI fragment of a cDNA clone for EP 24.15 (TOP) (PABH-L7); (20Kato A. Sugiura N. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), both of which had been labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK) with a random priming kit (Takara, Kyoto, Japan). Phage clones (2 × 106) were plated at a density of 30,000 plaque-forming units per 135 × 95-mm plate on E. coliNM538, from which duplicate replications were made on cellulose-nitrate filters (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) and allowed to hybridize with the 32P-labeled probe in a solution of 6 × SSPE (1 × SSPE is 0.15 m NaCl, 15 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA), 50% formamide, 0.1% SDS, and 5× Denhardt's solution at 42 °C for 16 h. The filters were rinsed twice at room temperature in 2 × SSC (1 × SSC is 0.15 mNaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0) that contained 0.1% SDS and washed twice at 60 °C in 1 × SSC that contained 0.1% SDS for 1 h. Positive plaques were identified by autoradiography and purified by the additional rounds of screening. Positions of theEcoRI, SacI, and XbaI restriction sites in genomic clones were determined by complete or partial digestion with restriction enzymes and subsequent Southern blot analysis. UV irradiation and formation of pyrimidine dimers were used for preparation of incompletely digested genomic clones. λEMBL3 SP6/T7 contains two unique SfiI or SalI sites and bacteriophage promoters (SP6 and T7) that flank the insert. Arms were separated with SfiI or SalI from the inserts, which still contained promoter sequences at the both ends. DNA samples were UV-irradiated for 0 or 20 min with UV Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene) in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. UV-irradiated samples (500 ng) were digested incompletely with EcoRI,SacI, or XbaI (10 units) for 1 h at 37 °C, fractionated on a 0.7% agarose gel, and transferred to nylon membranes (Magnagraph; MSI, Westboro, MA). A set of filters was prepared and allowed to hybridize with end-labeled oligoprobes for T7 or SP6 promoter sequence, for 14 h at 37 °C in 6 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml herring sperm DNA. The filters were washed twice in 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C for 30 min, exposed to imaging plates, and analyzed with a Bioimage Analyzer (model BAS 2000; Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Three primers, namely, 108L (CAAGCCTTGCGGCGGCCTAGCAAAGGAGGCAACAG) for exon 1; 107L (GGTGTCCCTCGGGGTAGACCATGTGGGCTGTAGAA) for exon 2; and 106b (GTCTCTCCATGAGAATGCTCCT) for exon 3, were designed for the synthesis of single-stranded antisense DNA probes that would protect pig 5′-ends of mRNAs for EP 24.16 (MOP). Ten pmol of each primer were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham) by polynucleotide kinase (Takara) and used for the synthesis of probes. End-labeled primers were annealed with 5 μg of plasmid DNA that contained genomic fragments of the pig gene for EP 24.16 (MOP) (ApaI-XhoI 837-bp fragment of λPAB-G33 for exons 1 and 2;BglII-EcoRI 923-bp fragment of λPAB-G32 for exon 3); and antisense probes were synthesized with T7 DNA polymerase (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). The 3′-ends of the probes were digested with restriction enzymes (SmaI for exon 1, BssHII for exon 2, and BglII for exon 3), fractionated by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel that contained 7m urea and exposed to x-ray film. Probes were detected as bands of the expected mobility and extracted in 0.5 mammonium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mmEDTA, 0.1% SDS, and 10 μg/ml yeast tRNA at 37 °C for 12 h. Extracted probes were precipitated in ethanol, and probes (1 × 105 cpm each) were annealed with 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from pig liver or with 10 μg of yeast tRNA, as a control, for 12 h at 30 °C in 80% formamide, 40 mm PIPES, pH 6.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 400 mm NaCl. Non-annealed nucleic acids were digested with S1 nuclease (Boehringer Mannheim, Mennheim, Germany) at a final concentration of 1,000 units/ml in 0.28 m NaCl, 0.05m sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 4.5 mmZnSO4, and 20 μg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA. The protected fragments were purified by extraction with phenol/chloroform and precipitation with ethanol, and electrophoresed in 5% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea. Gels were dried and exposed to imaging plates for 48 h. Images were analyzed with the Bioimage Analyzer. Rabbits were injected subcutaneously with 75 μg of purified pig EP 24.16 (MOP) (formerly referred to as soluble angiotensin-binding protein, sABP (27Sugiura N. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18067-18072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) in complete Freund's adjuvant. Booster injections with 75 μg of purified protein in incomplete Freund's adjuvant were given 2, 4, and 6 weeks after the initial injection. Rabbits were bled 10 days after the fourth injection. Six plasmids, pcDNA3-MOP1 (exon 1-[5–16]); -MOP1′ (exon 1–4-[5–16]); -MOP2 (exon 2-[5–16]); -MOP2′ (exon 2–4-[5–16]); -MOP3 (exon 3-[5–16]); and -MOP3′ (exon 3–4-[5–16]), were constructed for expression analysis. For pcDNA-MOP1, a 2732-bp EcoRI-EcoRI fragment of PAB-L1 (27Sugiura N. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18067-18072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which contained the entire open reading frame of type 1 cDNA for EP 24.16 (MOP), was subcloned to pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). For the other plasmids, PAB-R5, -R302, -R305, -R8, and -R1 (Fig. 1), which encoded only the 5′-ends of type 1′, 2, 2′, 3, and 3′ cDNAs, respectively, were digested with AlwNI at their 3′ termini, ligated with the 2291-bpAlwNI-EcoRI fragment of PAB-L1 and subcloned into pcDNA3. COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) that contained 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin, in a controlled atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. Approximately 6 × 106 cells were electroporated with 20 μg of each plasmid at 220 V at a capacitance setting of 960 microfarads in a Gene Pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad) and harvested 48 h after electroporation. All steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were washed by centrifugation in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (2.7 mm KCl, 138 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, and 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) at 700 rpm for 2 min. Approximately 2 × 107 cells were suspended in 1 ml of 2.5 m sucrose and homogenized for 2 min. Nuclear fractions were removed by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm (700 × g) for 10 min, and supernatants were centrifuged at 9,200 rpm (7,000 × g) for 10 min to recover mitochondrial fractions as pellets. Mitochondrial fractions were washed twice by centrifugation at 25,000 rpm (24,000 ×g) for 10 min. The post-mitochondrial supernatants were centrifuged at 50,000 rpm (105,000 × g) for 100 min, and the pellets (microsomes) and supernatants (cytosol) were recovered. The concentration of protein in each fraction was determined with the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Five μg of each protein sample were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide) in standard glycine running buffer (192 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris, and 0.1% SDS) or high-resolution running buffer (492 mmglycine, 75 mm Tris, and 0.1% SDS). The separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan) and probed with 2,000-fold diluted rabbit antiserum against pig EP 24.16 (MOP). Bound antibodies were detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated second antibodies, with 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (NBT/BCIP) as chromogen. To delineate the complete structure of the gene for EP 24.16 (MOP), we determined the 5′-end of the corresponding mRNA by rapid amplification of 5′-ends of cDNA (5′-RACE) using preparations of poly(A)+ RNA from pig liver. More than five prominent bands of fragments of 340–630 nucleotides were obtained. DNA sequencing of these fragments revealed the presence of several mRNAs whose sequences were completely different from others starting 28 nt upstream from the ATG initiation codon (Fig.1; M3). These results suggested that usage of alternative promoters and exons might be involved in the generation of the observed mRNA diversity. To determine the precise molecular mechanism responsible for generation of such heterologous mRNAs, we isolated and characterized the pig gene for EP 24.16 (MOP), which had previously been shown to be present as only a single copy (27Sugiura N. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18067-18072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To isolate the pig gene for EP 24.16 (MOP), we screened approximately 2 × 106 independent plaques of a pig genomic library in λEMBL3 (CLONTECH) using the PAB-L1 cDNA clone (27Sugiura N. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18067-18072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as the probe. We isolated and mapped more than 50 clones, and then we subcloned and sequenced the phage fragments for the identification of exons. The exon-intron organization of the pig gene for EP 24.16 (MOP) was deduced from an analysis of 11 independent clones, each of which contained part of the gene (Fig.2). The gene extends over 100 kilobases and contains 16 exons and 15 introns of various sizes (Figs. 2 B and4 B). All the introns have typical splice donor and acceptor boundaries (Fig. 4 D) (35Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar).Figure 2Structure of the cDNA for pig EP 24.16 (MOP) in relation to the structure of the gene (A), exon-intron organization of the gene (B), restriction maps for EcoRI, SacI, and XbaI (C), and the relative locations of genomic clones used for the analysis (D). The structure of cDNA for pig EP 24.16 (MOP) is described elsewhere (27Sugiura N. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2094914141,"To identify domains conferring ligand binding specificity to prostanoid receptors, we constructed a series of chimeric receptors by successively replacing the regions from the carboxyl-terminal tail of mouse prostacyclin (prostaglandin I (PGI)) receptor (mIP) with the corresponding regions of the mouse PGD receptor (mDP). The mIP receptor expressed in COS 7 cells bound [3H]iloprost, a PGI2 analog, and [3H]PGE1 with K d values of 13 and 27 nm, respectively. This receptor did not bind [3H]PGD2, [3H]PGE2, and [3H]PGF2α. The mDP receptor bound only [3H]PGD2 with a K d value of 43 nm. The chimeric IPN-VII/DPCreceptor with replacement of the carboxyl tail of the mIP receptor with that of the mDP receptor showed 12–16-fold higher affinities for [3H]iloprost and [3H]PGE1 than the mIP receptor. The region extending from the sixth transmembrane domain to the carboxyl terminus of the mIP receptor was next replaced with the corresponding region of the mDP receptor. This chimeric IPN-V/DPVI-C receptor acquired the ability to bind [3H]PGD2 and [3H]PGE2 without decreasing the affinities of the mIP receptor to [3H]iloprost and [3H]PGE1. These binding characteristics did not change when the fourth and fifth transmembrane domains of the mIP receptor were further replaced with the corresponding regions of the mDP receptor. However, when the first extracellular to second intracellular loop of the mIP receptor containing the third transmembrane domain was further replaced with those of the mDP receptor, the affinities for [3H]PGE1, [3H]PGE2, and [3H]iloprost were markedly decreased, whereas that for [3H]PGD2was increased by about 2-fold. [3H]PGF2αshowed no affinity for the mIP, mDP, and all the chimeric receptors. These results suggest that the sixth to seventh transmembrane domain of the mIP receptor confers the specificity of this receptor to bind selectively to PGE1 and not to PGE2 and that the third transmembrane domain of the mDP receptor confers the selective binding of PGD2 to this receptor. To identify domains conferring ligand binding specificity to prostanoid receptors, we constructed a series of chimeric receptors by successively replacing the regions from the carboxyl-terminal tail of mouse prostacyclin (prostaglandin I (PGI)) receptor (mIP) with the corresponding regions of the mouse PGD receptor (mDP).

Prostaglandins (PGs) 1The abbreviations used are: PG(s), prostaglandin(s); G protein, heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. contain prostanoic acid as a central structural element. PGs have two structural features in the prostanoic acid framework. First, they have functional groups on the cyclopentane ring, which classifies them into four types, D, E, F, and I. Second, they are classified into three series, 1, 2, and 3, by the number of double bonds in the side chains. Additionally, another cyclooxygenase product, thromboxane A2 has an oxane ring instead of the cyclopentane ring. These prostanoids act on eight types and subtypes of the receptors. They are the PGD receptor (DP), the EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 subtypes of the PGE receptor, the PGF receptor (FP), the PGI receptor (IP), and the thromboxane A2 receptor (TP) (1Coleman R.A. Kennedy I.

The binding affinities of these receptors to prostanoid molecules are determined primarily by the cyclopentane ring structures of ligands. For example, the DP receptor shows the highest affinities to PGD2 and PGD1, but affinities to other prostanoids are at least 2 orders of magnitude less. One exception is the IP receptor, which shows the affinity to PGE1 almost comparable to PGI analogs such as iloprost. This receptor, however, can bind PGE2 with much lower affinity, suggesting that the IP receptor can discriminate a difference in the side chains. We have cloned cDNAs for all of these types and subtypes of the mouse prostanoid receptors (5Hirata M. Hayashi Y. Ushikubi F. Yokota Y. Kageyama R. Nakanishi S. Narumiya S.

They have several regions conserved specifically among them. These conserved regions may participate in the construction of binding domains for structures common to prostanoid molecules, whereas the other regions may confer specificity for ligand binding. For example, the arginine in the seventh transmembrane domain, which is conserved in all of the prostanoid receptors, was proposed to be the binding site for the carboxyl group of prostanoid molecules (5Hirata M. Hayashi Y. Ushikubi F. Yokota Y. Kageyama R. Nakanishi S. Narumiya S. Nature. 1991; 349: 617-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 14Ushikubi F. Hirata M. Narumiya S. J.

Lipid Mediators. 1993; 6: 155-161PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, Funk et al. (16Funk C.D. Furci L. Moran N. Fitzgerald G.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 934-939PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that a point mutation at this arginine residue in the human TP receptor results in loss of ligand binding activity. However, structural domains of the prostanoid receptors conferring specificity for ligand binding are as yet unknown. Chimeric receptors have been used to determine the regions involved in various functions of the receptors. For example, this approach was used to determine the regions involved in selective agonist and antagonist binding in adrenergic receptors (17Kobilka B.K. Kobilka T.S. Daniel K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1988; 240: 1310-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 18Frielle T. Daniel K.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 18968-18976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results show that this approach has been useful in locating functional domains of various receptors. To identify the domains conferring the ligand binding specificity to the prostanoid receptors, we have constructed chimeric receptors from the mIP and mDP receptors in this study. This strategy is based on the high homology of their amino acid sequences as well as common signal transduction. The prostanoid receptors can be functionally grouped into three categories: the relaxant receptors, the contractile receptors, and the inhibitory receptor (14Ushikubi F. Hirata M. Narumiya S. J. Lipid Mediators. 1995; 12: 343-359Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The relaxant receptors, consisting of the IP, DP, EP2, and EP4 receptors, mediate increases in cAMP and induce smooth muscle relaxation. The contractile receptors, consisting of the TP, FP, and EP1 receptors, mediate calcium mobilization and induce smooth muscle contraction. The EP3 receptor is an inhibitory receptor that mediates decreases in cAMP and inhibits several biological processes such as neurotransmission, gastric acid secretion, and water reabsorption. Sequence homology among these functionally related receptors is higher than that among the three separate groups (25Toh H. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of the mIP and mDP receptors, which belong to the same relaxant receptor group, show 58% identity in the transmembrane domains (Fig. 1), and both couple to the same G protein, Gs. Chimeric mIP/DP receptors were expressed in the COS 7 cells, and their ligand binding properties were examined. PGD2, PGE1, PGE2, and PGF2α were generous gifts from Ono Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). PGD1 was obtained from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). [5,6,8,9,12,14,15-3H]PGD2 (115 Ci/mmol), [5,6-3H]PGE1 (52 Ci/mmol), [5, 6,8,11,12,14,15-3H]PGE2 (171 Ci/mmol), and [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]PGF2α (179 Ci/mmol) were obtained from DuPont NEN. Iloprost and [3H]iloprost (15.3 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham International plc, United Kingdom. The mIP and mDP cDNAs were first subcloned into pCMX expression vector (26Umesono K.

Six types of mIP/DP chimeric receptors were then constructed (Fig. 2 A). Six restriction sites of the mIP receptor cDNA (Asp718, PstI,PvuII, SphI, BspHI,BamHI), four restriction sites of the mDP receptor cDNA (BspHI, BspEI, PstI,BamHI), and newly introduced restriction sites (BamHI, SpeI, HaeII) were used to construct these chimeric receptor cDNAs so that they have no insertion or deletion in the amino acid sequences (Fig. 2 B). The new restriction sites were introduced by PCR using oligonucleotides designed for each site (Table I). pCMX-mIP or -mDP (5 ng) was used as a template for amplification by PCR in a reaction mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, 0.25 mm dNTPs, 1 unit ofPfu polymerase (Stratagene), and 20 pmol of each primer in a total volume of 20 μl. After a denaturation step at 94 °C for 3 min, 20 cycles of amplification step (94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 3 min) were carried out and followed by a final elongation step of 3 min at 72 °C. PCR products were electrophoresed, excised, purified using DEAE membrane (Whatman International Ltd., Maidstone, U.

Open table in a new tab BspHI sites at equivalent positions in the mIP and mDP receptor cDNAs (Fig. 2 B) were utilized to construct this chimeric receptor. Fragment D-2 was excised from pCMX-mDP by digesting with BspHI and BamHI, and fragment I-2 was excised from pCMX-mDP by digesting withSphI and BspHI. Both excised fragments were ligated into the SphI and BamHI sites of pCMX-mIP. Fragments I-1 and D-1 were amplified by PCR with the primer pairs shown in Table I to have a BamHI site (Fig.2 B). Fragment I-1 was digested with SphI andBamHI, and fragment D-1 was digested with BamHI and BspEI. Both digested fragments were ligated into theSphI and BspEI sites of pCMX-IPN-V/DPVI-C. Fragments I-3 and D-3 were amplified by PCR with primer pairs shown in Table I to have an SpeI site (Fig. 2 B). Fragment I-3 was digested with SphI and SpeI, and fragment D-3 was digested with SpeI and BspEI. Both digested fragments were ligated into the SphI and BspEI sites of pCMX-IPN-V/DPVI-C. Fragments I-4 and D-4 were amplified by PCR with the primer pairs shown in Table I. In the D-4 fragment, thePvuII site was introduced (Fig. 2 B). Fragment I-4 was digested with PstI and PvuII, and fragment D-4 was digested with PvuII and PstI. Both digested fragments were ligated into the PstI sites of pCMX-IPN-V/DPVI-C.

Fragment D-5 was digested withPstI and ligated into the PstI sites of pCMX-IPN-V/DPVI-C. Fragments I-6 and D-6 were amplified by PCR with the primer pairs shown in Table I to have HaeII (Fig.2 B). Fragment I-6 was digested with Asp718 andHaeII, and fragment D-6 was digested withHaeII and BspEI. Both digested fragments were ligated into the Asp718 and BspEI sites of pCMX-IPN-V/DPVI-C. For transient expression of each prostanoid receptor, COS 7 cells cultured in 15-cm dishes were transfected with 20 μg of plasmid DNA by the lipofection method (27Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. Danielsen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7413-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (4369) Google Scholar). After culture for 60 h, the cells were harvested, and crude membranes were prepared as described (11Namba T. Oida H. Sugimoto Y. Kakizuka A. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9986-9992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, harvested COS 7 cells were homogenized using a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer in a solution containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × gfor 1 min. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was suspended in 20 mm MES (pH 6.0) containing 10 mmMgCl2 and 1 mm EDTA (the suspension buffer), and used as crude membranes. Binding assays were performed essentially as described previously (11Namba T. Oida H. Sugimoto Y. Kakizuka A. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9986-9992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For Scatchard analysis, 50 μg of crude membranes was incubated in the suspension buffer with various concentrations of [3H]iloprost, [3H]PGE1, [3H]PGE2, [3H]PGD2, or [3H]PGF2α in a total volume of 200 μl at 4 °C for 2 h. In competition experiments, the crude membranes were incubated with 20 nm[3H]PGE1 or 60 nm[3H]PGD2 in the presence of various concentrations of PGD1 or PGD2. The incubation was terminated by the addition of 2 ml of the ice-cold suspension buffer, and the mixture was rapidly filtered through GF/C filters (Whatman). The filter was then washed with 5 ml of the ice-cold suspension buffer three times. The radioactivity on the filter was measured in 5 ml of Clear-Sol scintillation mixture (Nakalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 1,000-fold excess of unlabeled ligands in the incubation mixture.K i values were calculated from IC50values of radioligand binding as described previously (20Gether U. Yokota Y. Emonds A.X. Breliere J.C. Lowe J.A. Snider R.M. Nakanishi S. Schwartz T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6194-6198Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The mIP, mDP, and six chimeric receptors were expressed in COS 7 cells, and crude membranes were prepared for binding studies. Crude membranes were incubated with various concentrations of each of [3H]iloprost, [3H]PGE1, [3H]PGE2, [3H]PGD2, and [3H]PGF2α (Fig. 3). Saturation kinetics of these binding was obtained and subjected to Scatchard analysis. Representative analyses are shown in Fig.4, and the results of several analyses are summarized in Table II. As shown in Fig. 4, A anda, the mIP receptor showed saturation binding to [3H]iloprost and [3H]PGE1, and Scatchard analysis revealed respective K d values of 13 ± 2 and 27 ± 5 nm (Table II). Binding was observed also with [3H]PGD2 and [3H]PGE2, but their affinities were too low to be analyzed by the Scatchard analysis. This ligand binding specificity of the mIP receptor is consistent with previous reports on the cloned mIP receptor (11Namba T. Oida H. Sugimoto Y. Kakizuka A. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9986-9992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and on native IP receptor in various cells (28Tsai A. Hsu M.-J. Vijjeswarapu H. Wu K.K. J. Biol.

On the other hand, the mDP receptor showed a high affinity binding only to [3H]PGD2 with aK d value of 43 ± 6 nm (Fig. 4,H and h, and Table II). This is also consistent with previous reports on the cloned mouse and human DP receptors (12Hirata M. Kakizuka A. Aizawa M. Ushikubi F. Narumiya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Prostaglandins. 1983; 25: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We then examined the binding properties of the chimeric receptors. The carboxyl tail of the mIP receptor was first replaced with that of the mDP receptor. This chimeric IPN-VII/DPC receptor showed a 12–16-fold increase in binding affinity to [3H]iloprost and [3H]PGE1 without an appreciable increase in the binding of [3H]PGE2 and [3H]PGD2 (Fig. 4, B andb, and Table II). The sixth to seventh transmembrane domain was then further replaced. The resultant chimeric IPN-V/DPVI-C receptor acquired the ability to bind [3H]PGD2 and [3H]PGE2 with K d values of 69 ± 16 and 40 ± 6 nm, respectively. They bound [3H]iloprost and [3H]PGE1 with affinities comparable to those of the mIP receptor withK d values of 11 ± 1 and 17 ± 8 nm, respectively (Fig. 4, C and c, and Table II). Similar ligand binding properties were shown by the chimeric IPN-IV/DPV-C and IPN-III/DPIV-C receptors, which have further substitution of the fifth and fourth transmembrane domains (Fig. 4,D and d, E and e, and TableII); they bound both [3H]PGE2 and [3H]PGD2 in addition to [3H]iloprost and [3H]PGE1 with affinities similar to those of the chimeric IPN-V/DPVI-C receptor. In contrast, the binding of [3H]iloprost, [3H]PGE1, and [3H]PGE2 was almost abolished when the first extracellular to second intracellular loop of the mIP receptor was replaced with that of the mDP receptor (Fig. 4, F andf). This chimeric IPN-II/DPIII-Creceptor, on the other hand, showed about a 2-fold increase in the binding affinity for [3H]PGD2. TheK d value of 35 ± 3 nm was close to the value of the mDP receptor (Table II). Similar ligand binding specificity was exhibited by the chimeric IPN-I/DPII-C receptor (Fig. 4, G andg, and Table II).Figure 4Saturation binding and Scatchard analyses of the mIP, mDP, and chimeric mIP/DP receptors.

Open table in a new tab The above results indicate that the mIP receptor may accommodate the cyclopentane ring structure of PGD and that it exerts its ligand binding specificity mainly by discriminating the structural difference in the α-side chain. To examine this hypothesis, PGD1binding was analyzed by competition binding studies on the mIP, mDP, and chimeric IPN-V/DPVI-C receptors using [3H]PGE1 or [3H]PGD2 as a radioligand (Fig.5). PGD1 effectively displaced [3H]PGD2 binding to the mDP receptor with aK i value of 990 nm. PGD1also displaced [3H]PGE1 binding to the chimeric IPN-V/DPVI-C receptor with theK i values of 2.5 μm. On the other hand, PGD1 as well as PGD2 could not displace [3H]PGE1 binding to the mIP receptor at up to a 10 μm concentration. The present study used chimeric receptors and examined domains of the prostanoid receptors conferring the ligand binding specificity of each receptor. The receptors we used are the mIP, mDP, and chimeric mIP/DP receptors. As shown under “Results,” the mIP receptor shows high affinity binding only to [3H]iloprost and [3H]PGE1, and the binding of [3H]PGD2, [3H]PGE2, and [3H]PGF2α is negligible. These binding properties indicate that the mIP receptor exerts its ligand binding specificity in two ways. One is the recognition of the configuration of the side chains. PGI has a unique configuration of the α-side chain because of the presence of an additional ring attached to the cyclopentane ring. It is believed that PGE1 without a double bond in the α-side chain can mimic this configuration of the PGI molecule and bind to the IP receptor, but this is not achieved by PGE2. The other is the recognition of the cyclopentane ring structure. It appears that this receptor can accommodate the cyclopentane rings of I and E types of PG, but not D and F. However, the specificity of this receptor for the cyclopentane ring structure appears less strict than those of other prostanoid receptors including the mDP receptor. As shown, the mDP receptor can bind only [3H]PGD2 with high affinity, and the binding affinities for E, F, and I types of PG are much lower. This indicates that the mDP receptor has strict recognition of the cyclopentane ring structure. Therefore, questions addressed in this study were which region(s) of the IP receptor discriminate PGE1 and PGE2, which region(s) of the IP receptor and how strictly they accommodate the cyclopentane ring, and which region(s) of the DP receptor determines the specific recognition of the cyclopentane ring of D type. We examined these questions by successively replacing the regions of the mIP receptor with those of the mDP receptor from the carboxyl terminus. Replacement of the region extending from the sixth transmembrane to the carboxyl terminus of the mIP receptor resulted in loss of ligand binding specificity of the mIP receptor mentioned above. This chimeric IPN-V/DPVI-C receptor bound [3H]PGD2 and [3H]PGE2 as well as [3H]iloprost and [3H]PGE1. The fact that this chimera binds PGE2, whereas neither mIP nor mDP binds this prostanoid, suggests that the domains recognizing the ring structure and the side chain configuration of prostanoid molecules are located in different regions of the prostanoid receptors. Because such a change was not observed in the chimeric IPN-VII/DPC receptor, these results suggest that the sixth to seventh transmembrane domain is responsible for recognition of the side chain configuration; this region of mDP appears to accommodate both 1 and 2 series of the prostanoid molecules, whereas that of mIP appears more strict, discriminating a structural difference in the α-side chain between PGE1 and PGE2. A more detailed analysis is required to locate an exact domain conferring this selectivity. The above results also suggest that the binding pocket of the mIP receptor for the cyclopentane ring of prostanoid molecules is localized in another region and can accommodate the cyclopentane rings of not only I and E but also D type, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the sixth to seventh transmembrane domain of the mDP receptor has contributed to accommodate the cyclopentane ring of D type in this chimeric receptor. Interestingly, the affinities for [3H]PGE1 and [3H]iloprost were not changed by further replacement of the fourth and fifth transmembrane domains, suggesting that the binding domain of the cyclopentane ring in the mIP receptor localizes in a region containing the first to third transmembrane domain. We have examined if the binding specificity of the mIP receptor is determined solely by recognition of the side chain structure by analyzing the binding of PGD1 to the mIP. As shown in Fig. 5, no appreciable binding of PGD1 was observed in the mIP receptor, suggesting that if the mIP receptor can accommodate the cyclopentane ring of D type, the relative configuration between the cyclopentane ring and the side chains is also important in determining the ligand binding affinity. On the other hand, PGD1 bound to the chimeric IPN-V/DPVI-C receptor, suggesting that the sixth to seventh transmembrane domain of the mIP receptor is also responsible for determining this binding specificity. Moreover, the facts that the affinity of PGD1 for the chimeric IPN-V/DPVI-C receptor was 1 order of magnitude lower than that of PGD2 and that this rank of binding is identical to that observed in the mDP receptor may indicate that the sixth to seventh transmembrane domain of the mDP receptor is responsible for determining these affinities. A region determining the specificity of the mDP receptor was suggested by further replacement of the first extracellular to second intracellular loop of the mIP receptor with the corresponding region of the mDP receptor. This replacement resulted in loss of the binding of iloprost and E type of PGs but increased the binding affinity for PGD2. These observations indicate first that this region of the mIP receptor is indispensable for iloprost, PGE1, and PGE2 binding, and second and more importantly that this region of mDP receptor may be responsible for the ligand binding selectivity of this receptor. Then, which domain in this region is responsible for this selectivity? The ligand binding pocket in most rhodopsin-type receptors for small molecules is formed by transmembrane domains. If this is also the case for the prostanoid receptors, we can assume that the third transmembrane domain is responsible for the above selectivity. Surprisingly, the third transmembrane domain has only four amino acids different between the mIP and mDP receptors (Fig. 1). If this domain is responsible, it would be intriguing to examine if any of these four amino acids has an important influence on the recognition of the cyclopentane ring. The functional groups at the 9- and 11-positions of the cyclopentane ring of PG molecules are either oxo or hydroxy groups. One hypothesis is that these groups are involved in formation of hydrogen bonds to some amino acids of the prostanoid receptors. The vicinal hydroxyl groups of the catechol ring are shown to be involved in formation of hydrogen bonds to Ser204 and Ser207 of the β2-adrenergic receptor (32Strader C.D. Candelore M.R. Hill W.S.

This investigation has also revealed that the affinities for iloprost and PGE1 of the mIP receptor are increased 12- and 16-fold by replacement of its carboxyl tail with that of the mDP receptor. There have been several reports concerning the effects of carboxyl tails of the rhodopsin-type receptors. We observed that alternative splicing of the EP3 and TP receptor in the carboxyl tail affects the specificity and efficacy of G-protein coupling (35Namba T. Sugimoto Y. Negishi M. Irie A. Ito S. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. Nature. 1993; 365: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 36Sugimoto Y. Negishi M. Hayashi Y. Watabe A. Hirata M. Namba T. Honda A. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. J.

J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9517-9521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, none of them showed a change in ligand binding properties. Whether a difference in the carboxyl tail increases the ligand binding affinity remains to be tested because our IPN-VII/DPC receptor also contains the replacement of several residues of the seventh transmembrane domain (Fig. 1). In summary, the present study has identified the domains of the mIP and mDP receptors which confer ligand binding specificities to each receptor. Continued application of molecular biology including introduction of a point mutation to the identified regions will provide a more detailed understanding of the molecular basis of ligand recognition by the prostanoid receptors and will help design more specific therapeutic agents.

Previous studies revealed that HSF2 consists of two alternatively spliced isoforms, HSF2-α and HSF2-β, whose relative abundance is developmentally regulated and varies between different tissues. To investigate whether the molar ratio of HSF2-α and HSF2-β isoforms is crucial for the activation of HSF2 and whether the HSF2 isoforms play functionally distinct roles during the hemin-mediated erythroid differentiation, we generated cell clones expressing different levels of HSF2-α and HSF2-β. We show that in parental K562 cells, the HSF2-α isoform is predominantly expressed and HSF2 can be activated upon hemin treatment. In contrast, when HSF2-β is expressed at levels exceeding those of endogenous HSF2-α, the hemin-induced DNA binding activity and transcription of heat shock genes are repressed, whereas overexpression of HSF2-α results in an enhanced hemin response. Furthermore, the hemin-induced accumulation of globin, known as a marker of erythroid differentiation, is decreased in cells overexpressing HSF2-β. We suggest that HSF2-β acts as a negative regulator of HSF2 activity during hemin-mediated erythroid differentiation of K562 cells.

Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). To date, three mammalian HSF proteins, HSF1, HSF2, and HSF4, have been identified (2Rabindran S.K. Giorgi G.

Biol. 1997; 17: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). HSFs have a common core structure consisting of the well conserved DNA binding and oligomerization domains. The DNA binding domain located in the amino-terminal part of the protein mediates binding to a highly conserved heat shock response element (HSE) found in multiple copies in the promoter of heat shock genes. The oligomerization domain adjacent to the DNA binding domain consists of the hydrophobic heptad repeats A/B (HR-A/B) (also termed the leucine zipper repeats 1–3). This domain is responsible for trimerization, which is essential for the high affinity binding of HSFs to the HSE. The carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic heptad repeat HR-C (leucine zipper repeat 4) is also well conserved and has been implicated in maintaining HSFs in the inactive non-DNA binding form (6Rabindran S.K. Haroun R.I. Clos J. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 7Zuo J. Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7557-7568Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). External to DNA binding and oligomerization domains, however, the homology between HSF1 and HSF2 is limited (<40%). A fundamental difference between HSF1 and HSF2 is that they respond to distinct signals. HSF1 is the functional homologue of the general HSF that is activated by diverse forms of stress, such as elevated temperatures, heavy metals, and amino acid analogs (8Sorger P.K. Lewis M.J.

Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Upon activation, HSF1 is rapidly converted from a monomer to a trimer, hyperphosphorylated, and translocated into the nucleus (6Rabindran S.K. Haroun R.I. Clos J. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 11Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2486-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 12Sarge K.D.

Nature. 1991; 353: 822-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Unlike HSF1, HSF2 is not activated by acute stress but is constitutively active in mouse embryonal carcinoma cells, at the blastocyst stage during mouse embryogenesis, and during spermatogenesis (14Mezger V. Rallu M. Morimoto R.I. Morange M. Renard J-P. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15Murphy S.P. Gorzowski J.J. Sarge K.D. Phillips B. Mol. Cell.

Reprod. 1994; 50: 1334-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that HSF2 functions as a regulator of heat shock gene expression during development and differentiation. The functional significance of HSF2 DNA binding activity in these biological processes is, however, unclear. The inducible binding of HSF2 to the hsp70 promoter, which closely correlates with the transcriptional induction of the hsp70 gene during the hemin-mediated erythroid differentiation of K562 cells, provides a well studied example of HSF2 acting as a signal-responsive transcription factor (17Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Phillips B. Abravaya K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4104-4111Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 18Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2087-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Unlike HSF1, the non-DNA binding form of HSF2 is a dimer, but similar to HSF1, HSF2 trimerizes upon activation. Other significant differences between HSF1 and HSF2 are that HSF2 is activated by slower kinetics, is not constitutively or inducibly phosphorylated, recognizes HSEs slightly differently, and is a less potent activator of heat shock gene expression than HSF1 (12Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 17Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Phillips B. Abravaya K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell.

In most cell types, HSF2 is present in a latent non-DNA binding form. However, in cells in which HSF2 is constitutively active such as embryonal carcinoma cells, mouse blastocysts, and mouse testis, the expression levels of HSF2 are markedly elevated when compared with other cell types (14Mezger V. Rallu M. Morimoto R.I. Morange M. Renard J-P. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15Murphy S.P. Gorzowski J.J. Sarge K.D. Phillips B. Mol. Cell.

Reprod. 1994; 50: 1334-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Similarly, the acquisition of HSF2 DNA binding activity correlates with the increased levels of HSF2 in hemin-treated K562 cells (18Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2087-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The existence of two distinct isoforms, HSF2-α and HSF2-β, provides another level of regulation that adds further complexity to the function of HSF2 (20Fiorenza M.T. Farkas T. Dissing M. Kolding D. Zimarino V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 21Goodson M.L. Park-Sarge O.-K. Sarge K.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5288-5293Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The smaller isoform, HSF2-β, is generated from the nascent transcript by an additional splice, resulting in the deletion of an 18-amino acid sequence present in the larger HSF2-α isoform (21Goodson M.L. Park-Sarge O.-K. Sarge K.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5288-5293Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The deletion is located adjacent to the HR-C and may cause modulation of the transcriptional activity of HSF2 since the HSF2-α isoform has been shown to be a more potent transcriptional activator than HSF2-β in NIH 3T3 cells (21Goodson M.L. Park-Sarge O.-K. Sarge K.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5288-5293Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ratio of HSF2-α and HSF2-β isoforms varies significantly between different mouse tissues such as brain, heart, and testis (21Goodson M.L. Park-Sarge O.-K. Sarge K.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5288-5293Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that the hemin-mediated induction of hsp70 transcription is negatively regulated in K562 cells overexpressing HSF2-β. Our results also suggest that the molar ratio of HSF2-α and HSF2-β is likely to be of central relevance in the regulation of HSF2 activity. Finally, we propose that HSF2 activation is essential for the hemin-mediated erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. Human K562 erythroleukemia cells were cultured in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were heat-shocked at 42 °C or treated with 30 μm hemin as described earlier (22Theodorakis N.G. Zand D.J. Kotzbauer P.T. Williams G.T. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell.

Host cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and electroporated (Gene PulserTM, Bio-Rad) in phosphate-buffered saline with 25 microfarad capacitance and 1.35 kV. Transfected cells were allowed to recover for 2 days, and neomycin-resistant cells were selected in medium containing G418 (500 μg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.) for 2 weeks. Drug-resistant cells were diluted and selected for single cell clones for another 2 weeks. Cell clones that stably express HSF2-α and HSF2-β were routinely maintained in medium containing G418 (500 μg/ml). Mock-transfected cells were used as a control. Before exposure to heat shock or hemin treatment, cells were plated in medium without G418. Whole cell extracts were prepared as described (10Mosser D.D. Theodorakis N.G. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4736-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Protein samples (10–20 μg) were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter using a semi-dry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). Western blotting was performed using immunoserum against mouse HSF1 and HSF2 as described (12Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). The inducible form of Hsp70 was detected by monoclonal antibody 4g4 (Affinity Bioreagents, Inc.). Hsp90 was detected by monoclonal antibody SPA-835 (StressGen Biotechnologies Corp.) and Hsc70 by monoclonal antibody SPA-815 (StressGen). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Promega and Amersham Life Science, Inc. The blots were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham). Globin content was detected by Coomassie staining. Quantitation was performed using a computerized image analysis (Microcomputer Imaging Device version M4, Imaging Research Inc.). A gel mobility shift analysis of protein·DNA complexes was performed as described previously (10Mosser D.D. Theodorakis N.G. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4736-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole cell extracts were incubated with a32P-labeled oligonucleotide representing the proximal HSE of the human hsp70 promoter. Protein·DNA complexes were resolved on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Transcription run-on analysis was performed with equal numbers of isolated nuclei in the presence of 100 μCi of [α-32P]dUTP as described previously (24Banerji S.S. Theodorakis N.G. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2437-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled RNA was isolated and hybridized to nitrocellulose-immobilized plasmids specific for hsp70 (25Wu B. Hunt C. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 330-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar),hsp90 (26Hickey E. Brandon S.E. Smale G. Lloyd D. Weber L.A. Mol. Cell.

Sarge K.D. Phillips B. Abravaya K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4104-4111Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Quantitation was performed using phosphoimaging (Bio-Rad). Total RNA was extracted from hemin-treated cells using a single-step method (28Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). 10 μg of RNA was separated on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham). The membranes were hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probes specific forhsp70 (25Wu B. Hunt C. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 330-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) and β-actin (27Gunning P. Ponte P. Okayama H. Engel J. Blau H. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To examine the molar ratio of the HSF2-α and HSF2-β isoforms and the effect of hemin treatment on the expression of HSF2, K562 cells were exposed to hemin for various time periods and analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 1 A). In untreated cells, the levels of HSF2-α were approximately 2-fold higher as compared with those of HSF2-β (Fig. 1 C). Hemin treatment increased the abundance of both HSF2-α and HSF2-β isoforms, and the increased amounts of HSF2 isoforms were observed within 6 h, in close correlation with the appearance of HSF2 DNA binding activity (Fig. 1 B). The amounts of HSF1 as well as Hsp70 and Hsp90 were analyzed in comparison with HSF2 in the same samples (Fig. 1 A). Hemin treatment of K562 cells did not affect the accumulation of HSF1. The heat shock response was shown to be typical (Fig. 1 A), as characterized by the retarded mobility on SDS-PAGE due to the inducibly phosphorylated state of HSF1 (12Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 29Cotto J.J. Kline M. Morimoto R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3355-3358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and the kinetics of DNA binding activation (Fig. 1 B). Accumulation of Hsp70 protein in cells exposed to either heat shock or hemin treatment correlated well with previous results showing transcriptional induction of hsp70upon heat shock and hemin treatments (Refs. 17Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Phillips B. Abravaya K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4104-4111Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar and 18Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell.

Equal numbers of nuclei from the control (C), heat shocked (HS) and hemin-treated (HE) K562 cells, mock-transfectants, and cells overexpressing HSF2 isoforms (see Table I for details of cell clones) were used to isolate labeled transcripts that were hybridized to the immobilized probes.

For this purpose, we generated cell clones that stably express mouse HSF2-α and HSF2-β under the control of the human β-actin promoter (30Gunning P. Leavitt J. Muscat G. Ng S.Y. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4831-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). K562 cells were used as recipients for the expression plasmids (12Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 21Goodson M.L. Park-Sarge O.-K. Sarge K.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5288-5293Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). More than 15 single cell clones for each transfection were isolated, and the expression of the distinct HSF2 isoforms was determined by Western blotting. TableI summarizes the characteristics of the cell clones that were chosen for further analysis. As the mouse HSF2 protein shows extensive homology with the human HSF2 (>95%), it is likely to function also in human cells. However, different mobilities of mouse and human HSF2 on SDS-PAGE (12Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar) allowed us to estimate the relative expression levels of the exogenous HSF2 isoforms. Among several single cell clones transfected with β-actin-HSF2-α, the 2α-F4 and 2α-C7 cells expressed the highest levels of HSF2-α and were chosen for further studies. Quantitation revealed that the ratio of total HSF2-α to HSF2-β was increased 2–2.5-fold in 2α-F4 cells and 2α-C7 cells, respectively, as compared with the parental K562 cells and the mock-transfected cells (vector). The representative HSF2-β clones (2β-C8, 2β-D5, 2β-E7) expressed 3–5-fold higher levels of HSF2-β than the control cells.Table ICharacteristics of the transfected cell linesCell typeCell cloneHSF2-α/HSF2-β1-aThe ratio of HSF2-α to HSF2-β was quantitated from the Western blot using computerized image analysis.Hemin response1-bDNA binding activities and transcription of hsp70were quantitated by phosphoimaging and scored as follows: −, no induction or only a weak induction; +, moderate induction; ++, strong induction.Heat shock response1-bDNA binding activities and transcription of hsp70were quantitated by phosphoimaging and scored as follows: −, no induction or only a weak induction; +, moderate induction; ++, strong induction.HSE bindinghsp70 transcriptionHSE bindinghsp70 transcriptionParental cellsK5622.1++++++Mock-transfected cellsvector2.0++++++HSF2-α-transfected cells2α-C74.9++++++++2α-F43.9++++++HSF2-β-transfected cells2β-C80.6−−++++2β-D50.4−−++++2β-E70.5−−++++1-a The ratio of HSF2-α to HSF2-β was quantitated from the Western blot using computerized image analysis.1-b DNA binding activities and transcription of hsp70were quantitated by phosphoimaging and scored as follows: −, no induction or only a weak induction; +, moderate induction; ++, strong induction. Open table in a new tab To examine the effect of the exogenously expressed HSF2-α and HSF2-β on the hemin-mediated increase in HSF2 levels, the transfectants were treated with hemin and analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 2). Similar to the parental K562 cells (Fig. 1), hemin treatment resulted in increased accumulation of the HSF2 isoforms in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 2, vector). In 2α-C7 cells expressing exogenous HSF2-α, both endogenous and exogenous HSF2 levels were elevated. Surprisingly, the hemin-mediated increase in the endogenous HSF2 was repressed in HSF2-β-overexpressing cells (2β-D5). This repression was detected in all HSF2-β cell clones. Analysis of HSF1 revealed that none of the mock-transfected cells or cells expressing exogenous HSF2 isoforms showed changes in accumulation or phosphorylation state of the endogenous HSF1 (data not shown). We also analyzed the accumulation of Hsp70 and Hsc70 during hemin treatment of the transfected cell clones (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the accumulation of Hsp70 was markedly reduced in the hemin-treated cells overexpressing HSF2-β as compared with the mock-transfected and HSF2-α-transfected cells. As expected, the levels of the constitutively expressed Hsc70 were not affected. Based on these results, we conclude that overexpression of HSF2-β inhibits the increase in HSF2 amounts and consequently prevents the hemin-mediated accumulation of Hsp70. Since our results presented in Fig. 2 suggest that HSF2-β functions as a repressor of the hemin-induced increase in Hsp70 accumulation, we wanted to determine at which molecular level the repression occurs. First, we analyzed whether the reduced accumulation of Hsp70 was caused by a corresponding decrease in hsp70transcription. The production of hsp70 and hsp90transcripts were measured by nuclear run-on assay using nuclei isolated from the parental K562 cells, the mock-transfected cells (vector), and the cells transfected with HSF2-α (2α-F4) and HSF2-β (2β-D5, 2β-C8). The results presented in Fig. 3 Aand quantitated in Fig. 3 B show that the repression of Hsp70 indeed occurs at the transcriptional level in the hemin-treated cells overexpressing HSF2-β, as only a weak, if any, hemin-mediated induction of hsp70 transcription could be detected. Similarly, the hemin-mediated induction of hsp90transcription was repressed due to overexpression of HSF2-β. In contrast, all other cell clones showed the characteristic transcriptional induction of heat shock genes upon hemin treatment. The transcriptional repression of hsp70 and hsp90genes in HSF2-β-overexpressing cells was specific for hemin treatment since exposure to heat shock resulted in an equally prominent induction of heat shock gene transcription in all cells. The repression ofhsp70 gene expression in HSF2-β-overexpressing cells was observed also at the steady-state mRNA level as analyzed by Northern blotting (Fig. 3 C). HSF2-α and HSF2-β have identical DNA binding and oligomerization domains. The only alteration in HSF2-β is the deletion of an 18-amino acid sequence located immediately adjacent to the carboxyl-terminal HR-C (21Goodson M.L. Park-Sarge O.-K. Sarge K.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5288-5293Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, HSF2-β would be expected to compete with HSF2-α for binding to HSE. To test this assumption, we next analyzed HSE binding activity in untreated and hemin-treated cells (Fig.4). As expected, hemin treatment induced the HSE binding activity in parental K562 cells (Fig. 1 B), mock-transfected cells (vector), and cells overexpressing HSF2-α (2α-C7, 2α-F4). Surprisingly, despite the presence of a DNA binding domain in the HSF2-β isoform, the formation of a protein·HSE complex was prevented in the hemin-treated cells overexpressing HSF2-β. This inhibition of DNA binding activity was detected in all HSF2-β cell clones (2β-D5,2β-C8, 2β-E7). Quantitation revealed that overexpression of HSF2-α in 2α-C7 cells potentiated the binding to HSE. In accordance with the transcriptional induction of heat shock genes (Fig. 3 A), DNA binding activity was strongly induced upon heat shock (Table I and data not shown), indicating that the HSF1-mediated heat shock response is not affected by overexpression of HSF2-β. Hemin-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells was confirmed by analyzing globin accumulation using Coomassie staining. In agreement with previous studies (31Dean A. Erard F. Schneider A.B. Schechter A.N. Science. 1981; 212: 459-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 32Haldeman M.T. Finley D. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9507-9516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), increased accumulation of globin was apparent after 3 days of exposure to hemin (Fig. 5). To elucidate whether HSF2 activity is involved in the hemin-induced erythroid differentiation, the globin content was determined in HSF2-α and HSF2-β transfectants. As shown in Fig. 5, overexpression of HSF2-β decreased the hemin-induced globin accumulation by 40–60% (2β-D5, 2β-E7), whereas globin induction was potentiated in HSF2-α-overexpressing cells (2α-F4,2α-C7). Taken together, our results indicate that the HSF2-β isoform functions as a negative regulator of heat shock gene expression and that HSF2 activity is essential for the hemin-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. Signal-dependent regulation of transcription factors plays a critical role in the processes underlying cellular differentiation and development. HSF2 has been shown to be active during mouse embryogenesis at blastocyst stage, during mouse spermatogenesis, during hemin-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells, and in mouse embryonal carcinoma cells (14Mezger V. Rallu M. Morimoto R.I. Morange M. Renard J-P. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15Murphy S.P. Gorzowski J.J. Sarge K.D. Phillips B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5309-5317Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Sarge K.D. Park-Sarge O.-K. Kirby J.D. Mayo K.E. Morimoto R.I. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 1334-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 17Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Phillips B. Abravaya K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4104-4111Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Characteristic of the cells involved in these processes is abundant expression of HSF2 as compared with other cell types. Furthermore, HSF2-α is the predominantly expressed isoform in spermatogenic cell types in testis (21Goodson M.L. Park-Sarge O.-K. Sarge K.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5288-5293Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Based on these results, it has been suggested that increased expression of HSF2 as well as the relative abundance of the HSF2 isoforms might contribute to HSF2 activation. Our results provide evidence that besides increased expression of HSF2, a molar excess of HSF2-α is required for HSF2 activation in K562 cells. Our results further suggest that HSF2-α and HSF2-β have distinct functions during hemin-mediated erythroid differentiation, as HSF2-α acts as a potential activator and HSF2-β as a suppressor of the hemin-induced transcription of heat shock genes in K562 cells. Using cell lines that express altered molar ratios of HSF2-α and HSF2-β, we examined the regulation and the functional significance of the alternatively spliced HSF2 isoforms during the hemin-mediated erythroid differentiation. We observed that excess of HSF2-β prevents the hemin-mediated HSE binding activity and subsequent induction of heat shock gene transcription. Furthermore, overexpression of HSF2-β specifically inhibits the hemin-mediated increase in the levels of both endogenous and exogenous HSF2. These results raise the interesting possibility that HSF2-β negatively controls the amount of HSF2 protein accumulated in a cell. This type of regulation could be a relevant mechanism to attenuate the hemin-mediated induction of heat shock gene expression. Our results further suggest that HSF2-α could counteract the inhibitory effect of HSF2-β on HSF2 DNA binding and transcriptional activity only when the molar ratio of HSF2-α to HSF2-β is favorable, i.e. HSF2-α is predominantly expressed. However, overexpression of HSF2-α alone is not sufficient to activate HSF2 in K562 cells, but another factor, such as hemin, is required for activation. Yet, it is not clear whether hemin mediates the action on HSF2 directly by binding to the molecule or by triggering some post-translational modifications thereby resulting in conformational change in HSF2. Interestingly, as hemin-mediated activation of HSF2 is accompanied by an increase in the levels of both HSF2 isoforms, the conformations of HSF2-α and HSF2-β might be differentially affected by hemin. An example of a hemin-regulated transcription factor is HAP1, which in yeast activates transcription of genes encoding cytochromes in response to oxygen and hemin (33Fytlovich S. Gervais M. Agrimonti C. Guiard B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1209-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 34Zhang L. Guarante L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14643-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HSF2, however, does not contain a sequence similar to the HAP1 repeat, termed hemin regulatory motif, that binds hemin directly (35Zhang L. Guarante L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the kinetics of HSF2 activation upon hemin treatment is relatively slow, varying between 6 and 16 h of hemin exposure (Ref. 17Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Phillips B. Abravaya K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4104-4111Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar and this study). Based on these results and the fact that hemin is known to be an important regulator of protein synthesis (36Padmanaban G. Venkateswar V. Rangarajan P.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 492-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that the hemin-induced increase in HSF2 levels and acquisition of HSF2 DNA binding activity could be consequences of changes in protein synthesis leading to a requirement for elevated levels of molecular chaperones. There are multiple examples where changes in RNA splicing result in transcription factor isoforms with altered activities. For example, certain AP-2 isoforms function as inhibitors of transactivation due to a deletion in the oligomerization domain, which is necessary for DNA binding (37Buettner R. Kannan P. Imhof A. Bauer R. Yim S.O. Glockshuber R. Van Dyke M.W. Tainsky M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4174-4185Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Splicing can also result in deletion of sequences required for full transactivation potential as exemplified by the Fos-related proteins (38Mumberg D. Lucibello F.C. Schuermann M. Müller R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 39Nakabeppu Y. Nathans D. Cell. 1991; 64: 751-759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 40Yen J. Wilson R.M. Tratner I. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5077-5081Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Analyses of different family members of nuclear steroid hormone receptors, c-ErbA and RORα, have revealed that their distinct DNA binding properties are dictated by the specific amino-terminal domains (41Chen H. Smit-McBride Z. Lewis S. Sharif M. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2366-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 42Giguère V. Tini M. Flock G. Ong E. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 538-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). In the case of HSF2-β, alternative splicing eliminates 18 amino acids adjacent to the HR-C, and HR-C has been implicated in maintaining HSFs in the inactive, non-DNA binding form (6Rabindran S.K. Haroun R.I. Clos J. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 7Zuo J. Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7557-7568Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). According to Goodson et al. (21Goodson M.L. Park-Sarge O.-K. Sarge K.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5288-5293Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the deletion in HSF2-β resulted in poor transactivation capacity in transiently transfected NIH 3T3 cells without affecting the DNA binding activity. However, our results showing that overexpression of HSF2-β in K562 cells interferes with HSF2 DNA binding lead us to conclude that the hemin-induced HSF2 DNA binding activity is controlled by this specific sequence adjacent to the HR-C located in the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein. We propose that the different results obtained earlier and in this study are likely to be due to experimental differences reflecting specific features of the different cell types and distinct expression levels of HSF2-β. Interestingly, HSF4, a novel human HSF lacking the properties of a transcriptional activator, has recently been identified (5Nakai A. Tanabe M. Kawazoe Y. Inazawa J. Morimoto R.I. Nagata K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In HeLa cells, which do not express endogenous HSF4, overexpression of HSF4 was shown to lead to constitutive HSE binding activity and repression of target genes, which could be related to the fact that HSF4 lacks the HR-C. Thus, despite the similar effects of overexpression of HSF4 and HSF2-β on gene expression, these factors seem to be functionally distinct, and the mechanism(s) by which overexpression of HSF2-β prevents HSF2 DNA binding activity remains to be established. The biologically relevant finding that HSF2 activity is essential for the regulation of hemin-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells is based on our results showing that globin accumulation upon hemin treatment is differentially affected by overexpression of HSF2 isoforms. The enhancing and inhibiting effects of HSF2-α and HSF2-β, respectively, on the signaling cascades leading to activation of HSF2 and subsequently to accumulation of Hsp70 and globin suggest that HSF2 plays a critical role during progression of cells to erythroid differentiation. We also demonstrate that the HSF1-mediated heat shock response is not affected by overexpression of HSF2-β and thus provides support for earlier studies implying that hemin-induced accumulation of Hsp70 in the differentiated erythroblasts of both K562 and bone marrow reflects a differentiation event rather than a general response to stress conditions (43Singh M.K. Yu J. Nature. 1984; 309: 631-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Future studies will be directed toward elucidating whether activation of HSF2 functions as a trigger in the initiation phase of erythroid differentiation and determining by which mechanisms HSF2 activity is regulated in cells undergoing differentiation.

Phorbol ester treatment is without an effect on Ca2+ influx in a different T cell line, HSB. Down-regulation of PKCβI expression by 18-h phorbol ester treatment is associated with a loss of the response to acute phorbol ester treatment in Jurkat cells, suggesting that PKCβI may be the isozyme responsible for the effects on Ca2+ influx. Electroporation of an anti-PKCβI antibody, but not antibodies against PKCα or PKCγ, led to an increase in the rate of Ca2+ influx following stimulation.

Electroporation of an anti-PKCβI antibody, but not antibodies against PKCα or PKCγ, led to an increase in the rate of Ca2+ influx following stimulation. Taken together, these data suggest that PKCβI may be a component of the down-regulation of increases in [Ca2+] i associated with Jurkat T cell activation. Activation of T lymphocytes via stimulation through the T cell receptor for antigen (TCR) 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell receptor for antigen; [Ca2+] i, intracellular concentration of Ca2+; DAG, diacyl glycerol; IP3, inositol trisphosphate; PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid. leading to proliferation, cytokine production, or effector function requires a regulated increase and subsequent decrease in the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ([Ca2+] i). The biochemical events associated with activation of T lymphocytes and leading to Ca2+ entry have been extensively studied (1Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2272) Google Scholar). Engagement of the TCR leads to the activation of phospholipase C, which subsequently cleaves phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3, binding to an intracellular receptor, induces the release of Ca2+ from an intracellular storage depot (2Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar). In a receptor-independent manner, the Ca2+/ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (3Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar) causes an uncompensated leak of Ca2+ from this internal storage pool. In T lymphocytes, as well as in most electrically nonexcitable cells, this depletion of the intracellular storage pool induces the opening of the plasma membrane Ca2+ entry pathway and permits influx of extracellular Ca2+ (1Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2272) Google Scholar). Previously, we have provided evidence that the pathway between release of intracellular Ca2+ and influx of extracellular Ca2+ is mediated by Ca2+-activated calmodulin (4Haverstick D.M. Gray L.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), which permits Ca2+ entry carried by a current we have calledI T (5Densmore J.J. Haverstick D.M. Szabo G. Gray L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1494-C1503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DAG produced subsequent to TCR stimulation is the naturally occurring activator of a family of serine-threonine kinases known collectively as protein kinase C (PKC). It has been proposed that DAG, via activation of PKC, represents the down-regulatory arm of Ca2+ signaling initiated by IP3 generation (for example, see Ref. 6Petersen C.C.H. Berridge M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32246-32253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Four points in Ca2+ signaling have been implicated as targets for PKC action. First is a PKC-mediated phosphorylation of the γ subunit of the TCR·CD3 complex and subsequent down-regulation of this complex at the surface of the cell (7Montero M. Garcia-Sancho J. Alvarez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3963-3967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Cantrell D.A. Lucas S.C. Ward S. Westwick J. Gullberg M. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 3653-3658PubMed Google Scholar). Second is the PKC-dependent phosphorylation of phospholipase C, with a consequent reduction in phospholipase C activity and IP3 generation (9Abraham R.T. Ho S.N. Barna T.J. Rusovick K.M. McKean D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5448-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Third is the phosphorylation of the plasma membrane Ca2+/ATPase, leading to its activation and a facilitation of efflux of Ca2+(10Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2115-2118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Depending upon the methodology used and the cell type examined, activation of PKC can (11Balasubramanyam M. Gardner J.P. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 526-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) or cannot (12Balasubramanyam M. Kimura M. Aviv A. Gardner J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C321-C327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) be shown to affect the rate of Ca2+ efflux following stimulation-induced increases in [Ca2+] i. The fourth potential target for a PKC effect is on the rate of Ca2+ influx itself, as suggested for HPB-ALL cells (13Shivnan E. Alexander D.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1146-1156PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we show that in Jurkat T cells the rate of Ca2+ influx is reduced by approximately 50% following activation of PKC. The PKC family consists of at least 11 isozymes that vary in their requirements for lipid and Ca2+ for activation and are differentially expressed in various cell types (reviewed in Refs. 14Stabel S. Parker P.J. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1991; 51: 71-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholarand 15Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). The study of the functions of this family of isozymes in cellular regulation has been facilitated by the use of phorbol esters, such as phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), which activate PKC, although with little specificity for any individual isozyme (14Stabel S. Parker P.J. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1991; 51: 71-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). In the past, the lack of isozyme-specific inhibitors (16Melner M.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 869-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) has made assignment of a PKC effect to a specific isozyme difficult. However, the recent development of some isozyme-specific inhibitors (17Ishii H. Jirousek M.R. Koya D. Takagi C. Xia P. Clermont A. Bursell S.-E. Kern T.S. Ballas L.M. Heath W.F. Stramm L.E. Feener E.P. King G.L. Science. 1996; 272: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar) and the use of technology such as RNA aptamers to block transcription of individual isozymes (18Conrad R. Keranen L.M. Ellington A.D. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32051-32054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is beginning to allow for the assignment of specific functions within a given cell type to a specific isozyme. For example, the development of a specific isozyme inhibitor has implicated PKCβ directly as a mediator of the vascular dysfunctions seen in diabetic rats (17Ishii H. Jirousek M.R. Koya D. Takagi C. Xia P. Clermont A. Bursell S.-E. Kern T.S. Ballas L.M. Heath W.F. Stramm L.E. Feener E.P. King G.L. Science. 1996; 272: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). In T lymphocytes, expression of the various isozymes of PKC depends upon the cell lineage and the state of differentiation of the cell line (for example, see Ref. 19Montero M. Garcia-Sancho J. Alvarez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26911-26919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The state of differentiation also confers upon T lymphocytes varying degrees of susceptibility to apoptosis induced by increases in [Ca2+] i (20McConkey D.J. Jondal M. Orrenius S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 606-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). While apoptosis is used by the immune system to regulate the expression of specific subsets of T lymphocytes during development, disregulation of this process can lead to immune suppression (21Cohen J.J. Duke R.C. Fadok V.A. Sellins K.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 267-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). To further define the role of PKC in T cell activation, we have examined the expression of PKC isozymes in Jurkat T lymphocytes and begun the determination of which isozyme(s) may function in the normal down-regulation of antigen- or agonist-induced increases in [Ca2+] i. Jurkat E6.1 and HSB cells were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (BioWhitaker, Walkersville, MD) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), SerXtend (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA), and glutamine (BioWhitaker, Walkersville, MD) at 37 °C in a CO2incubator. Indo-1 and BAPTA were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Anti-PKC isoform-specific antibodies and the peptides used for immunization were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Unless otherwise indicated, all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Cells at a concentration of 4 × 106/ml were incubated with 1 μm indo-1/AM for 1 h at 37 °C in culture medium. Cells were washed three times in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% glucose, 1% fetal bovine serum) and suspended at a final concentration of 1 × 106/ml in buffer A. The [Ca2+] i was determined from the fluorescence ratio (398/480 nm) with excitation at 360 nm in an SLM 8100 spectrofluorometer (SLM/Aminco, Urbana, IL) in the T format as described previously (4Haverstick D.M. Gray L.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22Gray L.S. Gnarra J.R. Engelhard V.H. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 63-69PubMed Google Scholar). Calibration was conducted as described previously (22Gray L.S. Gnarra J.R. Engelhard V.H. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 63-69PubMed Google Scholar, 23Dutz J.P. Fruman D.A. Burakoff S.J. Bierer B.E. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2591-2598PubMed Google Scholar) using the equation developed for an earlier generation of Ca2+ indicator dyes (24Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 25Scanlon M. Williams D.A. Fay F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6308-6312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and 50 μl, representing 5 × 105 cells, were applied to a 10% acrylamide gel. Proteins were then transferred to blotting membrane and probed for isoform expression using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's directions. The protocol for electroporation was based on that published by Lukas et al.(26Lukas J. Bartek J. Strauss M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 170: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed three times in buffer B (10 mm PO4, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and suspended to a final concentration of 2 × 108/ml. Cells (50 μl) were mixed with 50 μl of antibody at 100 μg/ml in buffer B plus 0.1% NaN3 and 0.2% gelatin (as supplied by Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and placed in the electroporation chamber. For those experiments using antibody plus peptide, 50 μl of buffer B or 50 μl of peptides (200 μg/ml in buffer B plus 0.1% NaN3 and 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin as supplied by Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was mixed with the anti-PKC antibodies and incubated on ice for 30 min prior to the addition of 50 μl of cells to the electroporation chamber. Electroporation (CellPorator, Life Technologies, Inc., Bethesda, MD) was carried out with the following settings: high resistance, 270 V, and 800 microfarads. These settings were chosen based on testing of multiple settings and balancing percentage of cell survival with antibody incorporation (determined by Western blotting and immunofluorescence; data not shown). Cells were then removed from the electroporation chamber, suspended to 2 × 106/ml in culture medium, and placed in a CO2incubator for a period of recovery (6–18 h) prior to use. Controls include cells mixed with antibody but not electroporated or cells electroporated in the absence of antibody. Cells subjected to the electroporation procedure and prepared for use in experiments to measure changes in [Ca2+] i were allowed to settle on poly-l-lysine-coated microscope slides. The cells were lightly permeabilized by incubation with 9% buffered formalin and washed three times in buffer B. Anti-PKC antibody was visualized by incubating the slide with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody. For the images presented in Fig. 8, all fluorescence fields were photographed using T-Max 400 film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) using a 16-s exposure time. Phase contrast images were taken of the same fields immediately thereafter using a 3-s exposure time.Figure 8Immunofluorescent visualization of antibody uptake following electroporation.

In most electrically nonexcitable cells, the Ca2+ entry pathway can be opened by depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ storage depot (1Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2272) Google Scholar). In T cells, the Ca2+ entry pathway can be opened in a receptor-dependent or -independent manner, using, respectively, an activating monoclonal antibody to the T cell receptor (OKT3) or thapsigargin (4Haverstick D.M. Gray L.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The effects of activation of PKC by the phorbol ester PMA on these two methods of opening the Ca2+entry pathway are shown in Fig. 1. The addition of PMA prior to stimulation of Jurkat cells with thapsigargin results in a concentration-dependent decrease in the maximum [Ca2+] i reached (Fig. 1 A). Fig.1 B demonstrates that the inhibitory effect of PMA also occurs once the Ca2+ entry pathway has been opened. The addition of PMA at a time when the storage pool has refilled but the Ca2+ entry pathway is still open (4Haverstick D.M. Gray L.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) results in a concentration-dependent reduction of [Ca2+] i. Similar results were observed when the Ca2+ entry pathway was opened in a receptor-dependent manner using the anti-CD3-specific antibody OKT3 (Fig. 1, C and D). Previously, it has been reported that such inhibitory effects of PMA are not seen in all T lymphocytes (19Montero M. Garcia-Sancho J. Alvarez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26911-26919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, a different T cell line, HSB, was examined as well. This human T cell line has lost expression of the T cell receptor for antigen; thus, the Ca2+ entry pathway can only be opened by thapsigargin treatment. As shown in Fig.2, there was no effect of up to 3 μm PMA on the changes in [Ca2+] i induced by thapsigargin in this cell line.Figure 2Increases in [Ca2+] i in HSB cells are not affected by phorbol ester treatment. Changes in [Ca2+] i in HSB cells were monitored as outlined under “Materials and Methods.” A, 100 nmthapsigargin was added to HSB cells in the absence (solid line) or presence (dotted line) of 3 μmPMA added 30 s prior. B, HSB cells were stimulated with 100 nm thapsigargin at 30 s, and 3 μmPMA was added at 150 s (dotted line). Traces are means of three determinations and are representative of five experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It has been proposed that the decreased magnitude of agonist-stimulated changes in [Ca2+] i after PMA pretreatment is due to a PKC-dependent phosphorylation and inactivation of phospholipase C (9Abraham R.T. Ho S.N. Barna T.J. Rusovick K.M. McKean D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5448-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Such a phosphorylation would result in decreased production of IP3 with a corresponding reduction in the amount of Ca2+ released from the intracellular storage depot. To measure the amount of Ca2+ released from the intracellular storage pool without interference from Ca2+influx, extracellular Ca2+ was chelated with EGTA prior to stimulation. Consistent with inhibition of phospholipase C, prior PMA treatment results in a reduction in the amount of Ca2+released from the intracellular storage pool following receptor stimulation in Jurkat cells (Fig. 3 A). However, the same inhibition of Ca2+ release is seen with thapsigargin treatment (Fig. 3 C). Since thapsigargin increases [Ca2+] i without the involvement of the T cell receptor, it seems unlikely that this latter effect is due to inhibition of phospholipase C. Whatever the site of PKC action is, no significant effect on [Ca2+] i was observed when PMA was added after stimulation of Ca2+ release in the absence of Ca2+ influx (Fig. 3, B andD). It has been proposed that activation of PKC results in activation of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump, such that there is a more rapid efflux of intracellular Ca2+ following PMA treatment (10Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2115-2118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, it is possible that activation of PKC inhibits Ca2+ influx. To examine which of these mechanisms might be active in Jurkat cells, it was necessary to measure influx and efflux separately. To measure Ca2+ pump activity, cells were stimulated to open the Ca2+ entry pathway, and then extracellular Ca2+was rapidly chelated by the addition of 3 mm BAPTA to the extracellular medium (Fig. 4 A). At this point, the rate at which Ca2+ returns to base line is a reflection of the activity of the Ca2+ pump, since there is no Ca2+ entry. Because the rate of pump activity is dependent primarily upon the [Ca2+] i (27Donnadieu E. Bismuth G. Trautmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25864-25872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a calculation of the exponential rate of decay was used to provide an estimate of pump activity; i.e. calculation of thet½ for the return of Ca2+ to basal levels can be used to compare efflux under various experimental conditions (Fig. 4 B). Unlike a calcium channel blocker such as Ni2+ (4Haverstick D.M. Gray L.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), chelation of extracellular Ca2+ with BAPTA does not close the Ca2+ entry pathway. Therefore, readdition of extracellular Ca2+ to the cell suspension (Fig.4 A) allows for the measurement of entry specifically during the first 10–15 s after readdition of Ca2+ (27Donnadieu E. Bismuth G. Trautmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25864-25872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the activity of the plasma membrane pump is governed by [Ca2+] i, during this time when [Ca2+] i is low, pump activity will be greatly reduced. Therefore, a straight line function can be applied, and the rate of Ca2+ influx in nmol/s can be determined and compared under the various experimental conditions (Fig.4 C). Influx and efflux rates in the presence and absence of PMA were calculated from several independent experiments (Fig.5). PMA caused a slight, but reproducible, decrease in the rate (increased t½) of Ca2+efflux, measured during the 30 s following the addition of BAPTA in Jurkat cells (Fig. 5 B). In paired experiments, this difference ranged from a 13 to 23% change but was not, overall, statistically significant. However, PMA caused a pronounced, statistically significant decrease in the rate of Ca2+influx measured in Jurkat cells during the 15 s following readdition of extracellular Ca2+. This reduction ranged from 37 to 56% when thapsigargin was used and up to 71% when cells were stimulated through the T cell receptor with OKT3 (Fig.5 A). Because the release of Ca2+ from the internal stores is reduced in the presence of PMA (Fig. 3), it is possible that this reduction in the rate of influx is merely a consequence of reduced release from internal stores. However, when the rate of influx was measured in cells stimulated with a concentration of OKT3 that resulted in a 50% reduction in the amount of Ca2+ released from internal stores (0.1 μg/ml of OKT3, data not shown), the rate of influx was not different from the rate of influx in the presence of the maximally effective concentration of 1 μg/ml of OKT3 (83–102 nmol/s with 1 μg/ml OKT3 versus 98–114 nmol/s using 0.1 μg/ml OKT3, n = 3). As a control for the calculations of influx and efflux, the same experiment was performed using HSB cells, which show no response to PMA on thapsigargin-induced changes in [Ca2+] i. No differences in Ca2+ influx or efflux were observed between cells that were treated with 100 nm PMA and those that were not (Fig. 5, right bars). For HSB cells, influx rates in the presence of PMA varied from 82 to 105% of control, and efflux rates varied from 93 to 110% of control. In many cell types, treatment with PMA for 12–18 h ablates the effects of acute PMA addition; under most circumstances, this is due to extensive proteolytic degradation of PKC (28Kikkawa U. Kishimoto A. Nishizuka Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). To determine whether this same phenomenon occurred in Jurkat cells, cells were treated for 18 h with 250 nm PMA, and the effects of acute PMA addition on stimulated changes in [Ca2+] i were examined. Fig. 6 demonstrates that the rapid return to basal levels that occurs following acute PMA addition (Fig.6 A) was lost in cells that had been treated overnight with PMA (Fig. 6 B). Similarly, when influx and efflux were measured as in Fig. 4, the effect of PMA on the rate of Ca2+ influx was completely lost in cells that had been treated for 18 h with PMA prior to stimulation (Fig.6 C). As outlined above, PKC is a family of serine-threonine kinases, and although the isozymes appear to be differentially sensitive to PMA within any single cell type, there is little consistency among various cell types (29Lucas S. Marais R. Graves J.D. Alexander D. Parker P. Cantrell D.A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 30Tsutsumi A. Kubo M. Jufii H. Freire-Moar J. Turck C.W. Ransom J.T. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1746-1754PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the lack of phorbol ester-induced inhibition of Ca2+ influx in HSB cells was due to the absence of a certain PKC isozyme, isozyme expression in Jurkat and HSB cells was compared. As shown in TableI, although there were some differences in the level of expression of a specific isozyme (for example, PKCα), there were no clear cut examples of an isozyme present in Jurkat cells but absent in HSB.Table IPKC isozyme expression by Jurkat and HSB cellsIsozyme-specific antibodyJurkatHSBα++++βI++βII+++++η++θ++ζ++δ−−ε±+γ±+Cells were lysed and proteins were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as outlined under “Materials and Methods.” Proteins were transferred to blotting membrane, incubated with isozyme-specific anti-PKC antibodies, and visualized with ECL reagents.

Relative signal intensity (greater to lesser) is designated by +++, ++, and +. − indicates no antibody binding detected. Because the effect of acute PMA addition was ablated by 18 h of PMA exposure, the Western blot analyses were repeated in Jurkat and HSB cells that had been incubated for 18 h with 250 nmPMA. Expression of PKCα, -βII, and -ζ were unchanged following this treatment (data not shown). However, PKCβI expression was markedly reduced following PMA treatment in Jurkat cells but only minimally affected in HSB cells (Fig. 7). This lack of an effect of PMA in HSB cells is similar to that observed by others (31Stoolman L.M. Wang T.L. Situ R. Varani J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 32Nagasawa K. Howatson A. Mak T.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1981; 109: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Since isozyme-specific inhibitors (16Melner M.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 869-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) are not commercially available, the effect of electroporation of isozyme-specific antibodies on Ca2+ entry was examined to garner additional support for a role for PKCβI in inhibition of Ca2+ entry. Jurkat cells were electroporated in the presence of isozyme-specific antibodies as outlined under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in Fig.8, cells mixed with antibody but not electroporated showed no incorporation of antibody (Fig. 8 A). However, electroporation resulted in a reasonably uniform incorporation of antibody, as visualized by immunofluorescence (Fig. 8 B). Prior incubation of antibody with the peptide used for immunization did not affect the incorporation of antibody (Fig. 8 C). The effects of the incorporation of antibody on agonist-induced changes in [Ca2+] i were examined next. Jurkat cells that had been electroporated in the presence of anti-PKCβI showed a reduced rate of return of [Ca2+] i to base line compared with cells that had been electroporated in the absence of antibody or those electroporated in the presence of anti-PKCα antibody (Fig. 9 A). In five such experiments, electroporation in the presence of anti-PKCβI reduced this rate of decrease in [Ca2+] i by 40–45%, while electroporation in the presence of anti-PKCα or anti-PKCγ had no significant effect on this rate (Fig. 9 B). Furthermore, the effects of anti-PKCβI antibody could be blocked by a 2-fold mass excess of the peptide used to generate this antibody, but not the peptide used to generate the anti-PKCα antibody (Fig.9 B). To determine if this reduction in rate was due to reduced efflux or enhanced influx, both were measured in cells electroporated with the isozyme-specific antibodies using the protocol described for the experiment of Fig. 4. The rate of efflux of Ca2+ from cells electroporated in the presence of anti-PKCβI was very similar to the rate observed in cells electroporated in the absence of antibody (Fig.10 B) or in cells electroporated in the presence of anti-PKCα (data not shown). Inclusion of peptides for PKCα or -β caused a small but statistically insignificant increase in the efflux time (decrease in rate). There was a slight reduction in the magnitude of the PMA effect in cells electroporated with either anti-PKC antibody, compared with cells electroporated without antibody. However, this effect could not be assigned to a specific isozyme of PKC. The effects of electroporation were more striking when the influx of Ca2+ was examined. In individual experiments, a 25–40% increase in the rate of Ca2+ influx was observed in cells electroporated in the presence of anti-PKCβI compared with a less than 5% decrease in Ca2+ influx in cells electroporated in the presence of anti-PKCα or anti-PKCγ (Fig. 10 A). Additionally, the effect of PMA treatment on Ca2+ influx was lost in cells electroporated in the presence of anti-PKCβI, while the PMA effect was still seen in cells electroporated with anti-PKCα or anti-PKCγ. As with the effects of anti-PKCβI antibody shown in Fig. 9, the effects of anti-PKCβI on Ca2+ influx could be blocked by a 2-fold mass excess of the peptide used for immunization but were not blocked by the peptide used for the production of anti-PKCα antibody (Fig. 10 A). Control of intracellular free Ca2+ concentration is a critical component of cellular homeostasis for all cell types. Increases in [Ca2+] i subsequent to receptor stimulation are necessary for the regulated progression of most cells through the cell cycle (33Lu K.P. Means A.R. Endocrine Rev. 1993; 14: 40-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), for appropriate expression of gene products such as cytokines in T lymphocytes (1Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2272) Google Scholar), and for some T cell effector functions, such as perforin-dependent cell killing by cytolytic T lymphocytes (34Haverstick D.M. Engelhard V.H. Gray L.S. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3306-3313PubMed Google Scholar). Equally necessary is the regulated decrease with a return to prestimulation calcium levels subsequent to any increase. The consequence of a sustained increase in [Ca2+] i is generally cell death, often due to induction of apoptosis (21Cohen J.J. Duke R.C. Fadok V.A. Sellins K.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 267-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). Changes in [Ca2+] i subsequent to engagement of the T cell receptor for antigen are initiated by release of Ca2+ from an internal storage depot mediated by the IP3 generated by receptor-induced activation of phospholipase C. This release of stored Ca2+ is followed by an influx of extracellular Ca2+. This process has been called by a number of names in electrically nonexcitable cells, such as capacitative calcium entry and the storage-operated calcium entry pathway (1Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2272) Google Scholar). Regardless of the nomenclature, most current models for this component of cellular signaling indicate a feed forward mechanism. In general, PKC activation, mediated by the other product of phospholipase C, DAG, has been associated with down-regulation of this pathway, although the data are not wholly consistent. The discrepancies may be due to differences in methodologies employed as much as to differences in cell lines examined. For example, in mixed populations of peripheral blood lymphocytes, phorbol ester treatment has been shown to have either an inhibitory (12Balasubramanyam M. Kimura M. Aviv A. Gardner J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C321-C327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or augmenting (8Cantrell D.A. Lucas S.C. Ward S. Westwick J. Gullberg M. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 3653-3658PubMed Google Scholar) effect on receptor-mediated changes in [Ca2+] i. These opposing results may be due to the relative state of differentiation of the cells as at least one study has implied (19Montero M. Garcia-Sancho J. Alvarez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26911-26919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data are more consistent when cell lines are examined. When changes in [Ca2+] i are examined in Jurkat cells using fluorescent dyes, stimulation through the TCR with prior activation of PKC is associated with a reduction in the magnitude of increases in [Ca2+] i (this report and Refs. 8Cantrell D.A. Lucas S.C. Ward S. Westwick J. Gullberg M. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 3653-3658PubMed Google Scholar, 11Balasubramanyam M. Gardner J.P. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 526-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, and 35Tordai A. Sarkadi B. Gorog G. Gardos G. Immunol. Lett. 1989; 20: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These results are in contrast to stimulation of Jurkat cells with a mitogenic lectin, such as concanavalin A, where there appear to be no effects of PKC activation on the subsequent changes in [Ca2+] i (35Tordai A. Sarkadi B. Gorog G. Gardos G. Immunol. Lett. 1989; 20: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In addition to controversy over the effects of PKC activation, multiple targets of PKC in the Ca2+ entry pathway have been proposed. While in both a murine T lymphoma line (9Abraham R.T. Ho S.N. Barna T.J. Rusovick K.M. McKean D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5448-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and in neutrophils (7Montero M. Garcia-Sancho J. Alvarez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3963-3967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Montero M. Garcia-Sancho J. Alvarez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13055-13061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) phosphorylation and down-regulation of receptors by PKC has been implicated, this observation cannot explain the effect of PMA on receptor-independent changes in [Ca2+] i. Similarly, a reduction in IP3 generated due to a PKC-dependent phosphorylation of phospholipase C (9Abraham R.T. Ho S.N. Barna T.J. Rusovick K.M. McKean D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5448-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) fails to explain the observed reduction in release of Ca2+ from internal stores following thapsigargin treatment (Fig. 3). The effects of PKC activation on Ca2+ influxversus efflux also have been examined. In peripheral blood lymphocytes, no effect on efflux following PMA treatment was seen when a straight line function was applied to the decrease in [Ca2+] i following chelation of extracellular Ca2+ (12Balasubramanyam M. Kimura M. Aviv A. Gardner J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C321-C327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in Jurkat cells, activation of PKC was associated with enhanced efflux of Ca2+ when a nonlinear, biexponential calculation was used (11Balasubramanyam M. Gardner J.P. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 526-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Efflux of Ca2+ has been associated with a pump mechanism, most likely the plasma membrane Ca2+/ATPase (27Donnadieu E. Bismuth G. Trautmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25864-25872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of the pump has been shown to be dependent upon the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ (27Donnadieu E. Bismuth G. Trautmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25864-25872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which we believe makes this application of a nonlinear function more appropriate. The observation of a PMA effect on Ca2+ efflux is confirmed by the data in this report, although the magnitude of the change was slightly less in the current study than observed in the previous one (11Balasubramanyam M. Gardner J.P. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 526-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), perhaps due to the different curve fitting method used in this study. There is more consistency when the effects of PKC activation on Ca2+ influx are examined. In nonlymphoid cells, PKC activation was associated with inhibition of Ca2+ influx when the current induced by Ca2+ influx was measured (37Di Virgilio F. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. Vicentini L.M. Meldolesi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 32-35Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In another study, a current others (38Parekh A.B. Penner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7907-7911Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), but not ourselves (5Densmore J.J. Haverstick D.M. Szabo G. Gray L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1494-C1503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have implicated as the mediator of storage pool depletion-induced Ca2+ entry was reduced in the presence of activated PKC (38Parekh A.B. Penner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7907-7911Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, we observed a 30–50% inhibition of the rate of Ca2+ influx in Jurkat cells following PKC activation with PMA (Fig. 5). Some of the discrepancies reported among various cell types may be due to differences in the expression of individual isozymes of PKC. Differences in the Ca2+ and lipid requirements for activation of the various isozymes suggest that specific functions are associated with each. Isozyme-specific functions in T cells were recently elegantly demonstrated in a study examining a subclone of Jurkat cells transfected with constitutively active expression vectors for different isozymes (39Genot E.M. Parker P.J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9833-9839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Regulation of some transcription factors was enhanced in cells that overexpressed PKCε but not PKCζ (39Genot E.M. Parker P.J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9833-9839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Several observations in the present study support a role for PKCβI in inhibition of Ca2+ influx. First, although PKC isozyme expression did not significantly differ between Jurkat cells that respond to PMA and HSB cells that did not, PKCβI was down-regulated by long term PMA treatment only in Jurkat cells (Fig. 8). Second, this long term PMA treatment abolished the PMA-induced inhibition of Ca2+ influx (Fig. 7). Third, electroporation of an antibody to PKCβI, but not an antibody to PKCα or PKCγ, reduced the rate of Ca2+ influx and abolished the PMA effect (Fig. 10). The presence of PKCβI in HSB cells seems difficult to reconcile with the failure of these cells to exhibit PMA-induced down-regulation of [Ca2+] i if this isozyme is responsible for the effect. However, the failure of PMA to down-regulate this isozyme in HSB cells (Fig. 7) suggests that PMA may fail also to activate the isozyme in these cells. This is consistent with previous reports suggesting that HSB cells fail to respond to PMA (31Stoolman L.M. Wang T.L. Situ R. Varani J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 32Nagasawa K. Howatson A. Mak T.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1981; 109: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Other possible explanations for the failure of these cell to down-regulate [Ca2+] i despite the presence of PKCβI include a defective enzyme and altered or missing downstream substrates. Collectively, the results of these and other studies provide support for a closed loop pathway initiated by engagement of the TCR in human lymphocytes. Following TCR ligation and activation of phospholipase C, IP3 induces the release of Ca2+ from the intracellular stores. This released Ca2+ activates calmodulin, which initiates the influx of extracellular Ca2+ (23Dutz J.P. Fruman D.A. Burakoff S.J. Bierer B.E. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2591-2598PubMed Google Scholar), carried by a current we have namedI T (5Densmore J.J. Haverstick D.M. Szabo G. Gray L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1494-C1503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This feed forward portion of the pathway is down-regulated by DAG-activated PKCβI, which inhibits Ca2+ influx. Whether or not this inhibition is by an action on I T is currently under investigation. We thank Paul Jung for excellent technical work examining Ca2+ influx and efflux and Chien Ying Lee for assistance with Western blots."

The role of the Asn394 residue (which is predicted to be in putative trans-membrane α-helix 11) in the structure/activity relationship of the d-galactose-H+ symporter (GalP) was therefore assessed by measuring the interaction of sugar substrates and the inhibitory antibiotics, cytochalasin B, and forskolin with the wild-type and Asn394 → Gln mutant proteins. Steady-state fluorescence quenching experiments show that the mutant protein binds cytochalasin B with a K d 37–53-fold higher than the wild type. This low affinity binding was not detected with equilibrium binding or photolabeling experiments. In contrast, the mutant protein binds forskolin with aK d similar to that of the wild type and is photolabeled by 3-125I-4-azido-phenethylamido-7-O-succinyl-desacetyl-forskolin. The mutant protein displays an increased amount of steady-state fluorescence quenching with the binding of forskolin, suggesting that the substitution of the Asn residue has altered the environment of a tryptophan, probably Trp395, in a conformationally active region of the protein. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements on the mutant protein provided association and dissociation rate constants (k 2 and k −2), describing the initial interaction of cytochalasin B to the inward-facing binding site (Ti), that are decreased (9-fold) and increased (4.9-fold) compared with the wild type. This yielded a dissociation constant (K 2) for cytochalasin B to the inward-facing binding site 44-fold higher than that of the wild type. The binding of forskolin gave values fork 2 and k −2 3.9- and 3.6-fold lower, respectively, yielding a K 2value for Ti similar to that of the wild type. The low overall affinity (high K d) of the mutant protein for cytochalasin B is due mainly to a disruption in binding to the Ti conformation. It is proposed that Asn394forms either a direct binding interaction with cytochalasin B or is part of the immediate environment of the binding site and that Asn394 is in the immediate environment, but not part, of the forskolin binding site. The ability of the mutant protein to catalyze energized transport is only mildly impaired with 4.8- and 2.1-fold reduction inV max/K m values ford-galactose and d-glucose, respectively. In stark contrast, the overall K d describing binding of d-galactose and d-glucose to the inward-facing conformation of the mutant and their subsequent translocation across the membrane is substantially increased (64-fold for d-galactose and 163.3-fold for d-glucose). These data indicate that Asn394 is associated with both the cytochalasin B and internal sugar binding sites. This conclusion is also supported by data showing that the sugar specificity of the mutant protein has been altered for d-xylose. This work powerfully illustrates how comparisons of the aligned amino acid sequences of homologous membrane proteins of unknown structure and characterization of their phenotypes can be used to map substrate and ligand binding sites.

The inclusion of both passive and active transporters in the homologous transporter family implies they share common features of both structure and molecular mechanism. Furthermore, the E. coli and mammalian proteins are predicted to have a similar membrane topology, comprising 12 membrane spanning α-helices (12 TM), with helices 6 and 7 connected by a cytoplasmic domain containing 60–70 amino acids (Fig. 1) (2Roberts, P.

This phenomenon has allowed the kinetics of the binding of cytochalasin B to GLUT1 and cytochalasin B and forskolin to GalP to be time-resolved using stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy; the binding of cytochalasin B and forskolin to GalP and of cytochalasin B to GLUT1 occurs by similar mechanisms, with at least three conformational states of the transport proteins identified (14Walmsley A.R.

The identification of transporter amino acid residues involved in the interaction with antibiotics will help elucidate the mechanism of recognition of both antibiotics and substrates. To this end, we have exploited the homology of the bacterial and mammalian transporters and compared their aligned amino acid sequences with their reported sensitivities to inhibition by cytochalasin B; it is probable that conserved residues are important in maintaining a common structure and mechanism and that differences are associated with variations in sugar specificity and antibiotic binding. In previous studies the covalent photolabeling of GLUT1 with cytochalasin B has been localized, by peptide mapping experiments, to a region containing amino acids Phe389 to Trp412 (30Cairns M.T.

Site-directed mutagenesis experiments on GLUT1 (40Inukai K. Asano T. Katagiri H. Anai M. Funakai M. Ishihara H. Tsukuda K. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Oka Y. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) led to a model where cytochalasin B can photolabel either Trp388 or Trp412. These regions of the aligned sequences of GalP, AraE, XylE, GLUT1, GLUT2, GLUT3, GLUT4, GLUT7, and a high affinityd-fructose transporter, GLUT5 (41Burant C.F. Takeda J. Brot-Laroche E. Bell G.I. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14523-14526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were compared. The transporters GalP, AraE, GLUT1, GLUT2, GLUT3, and GLUT4 have a conserved Asn residue and are all susceptible to inhibition by cytochalasin B. In contrast, the transporters XylE, GLUT5, and GLUT7 do not have a conserved Asn residue and show no (XylE 2T. P. McDonald and P. J. F. Henderson, unpublished data.2 (41Burant C.F. Takeda J.

Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar)) sensitivity to inhibition by cytochalasin B. We therefore predicted that the conserved Asn residue would be involved in cytochalasin B binding. To test this hypothesis Asn394 of GalP, which is predicted in a three-dimensional model to be in the middle of TM11 (Fig. 1), was changed by site-directed mutagenesis to Gln. The ability to over-express wild-type and mutant GalP proteins in high yield in appropriate E. coli strains has enabled us to achieve a rigorous characterization, which shows that changing Asn394to Gln markedly diminishes sensitivity to the antibiotic cytochalasin B, but not to forskolin, and also diminishes binding of sugar to the inward-facing side of the protein. E. coli strain JM1100HfrC his-gnd Δ thyA galK ptsM galP mglP ptsF ptsG (43Henderson P.J.F. Giddens R.A. Jones-Mortimer M.C. Biochem. J. 1977; 162: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), containing plasmids with wild-type or mutatedgalP genes, was the host strain for over-production of the GalP protein. After the mutagenic reaction (see below) the recombinant bacteriophage M13 DNA was transfected into E. coli strain TG1 Δ(lac-proAB) supE thi hsd Δ5 F′[traD36proAB + lacI q lacZ ΔM15]. The modification (−) and restriction (−) phenotype of strain TG1 necessitated that the mutant plasmids constructed from DNA isolated from strain TG1 were transformed into strain DH1 (modification (+), restriction (−)) before introduction into E. coli strain JM1100 (modification (+), restriction (+) phenotype), to prevent restriction of unmodified plasmid DNA.E. coli strain DH1 has the genotype supE44hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA96thi-1 relA1. The E. coli strains JM1100(pPER3) (wild-type GalP (2Roberts, P. E. (1992) The Galactose-H+ Symport Protein of Escherichia coli. Ph.D. thesis, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.Google Scholar)) and JM1100(pTPM6) (GalP with the Asn394 → Gln mutation, this work) were used for the constitutive over-expression of the wild-type and mutated GalP proteins. To gain maximum expression of GalP, strains were grown overnight in minimal media with 15 μg/ml tetracycline, supplemented with l-histidine (80 μg/ml) and thymine (20 μg/ml). For sugar transport and sugar-H+ symport experiments, requiring lower levels of expression, cells were grown on rich media (2TY supplemented with 20 mm glycerol, 20 μg/ml thymine, and 15 μg/ml tetracycline). The E. coli cells were disrupted by explosive decomposition in a French Press at 137.5 MPa, and the inner membranes were prepared essentially as described by Osborn et al.(44Osborn M.J. Gander J.E. Parisi E. Carson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3962-3972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This procedure yields predominantly inside-out vesicles (45Futai M. Rosen B.P. Bacterial Transport. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1978: 7-41Google Scholar). A sample of the membrane preparation (30 μg of protein) was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After staining with Coomassie Blue, gels were scanned with a Molecular Dynamics 100A Computing Densitometer, and the proportion of GalP protein was measured. The levels of expression of the wild-type and mutant proteins were determined by comparison of the intensities of the bands corresponding to the GalP proteins on Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The expression of the Asn394 → Gln mutant protein was 107% that of the wild-type protein. The concentration of protein in the membrane preparations was assayed by the method of Schaffner and Weissman (46Schaffner W. Weissman C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar). The codon (AAC) for asparagine 394 of the galP gene was replaced by that of glutamine (CAG) as follows. The single-stranded DNA template for mutagenesis was prepared by subcloning a 2.46-kilobase pairAlwI-AlwI DNA fragment coding for the C-terminal half of GalP from plasmid pPER3 (which confers elevated expression of GalP (2Roberts, P. E. (1992) The Galactose-H+ Symport Protein of Escherichia coli. Ph.D. thesis, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.Google Scholar)) into bacteriophage M13mp18. Mutagenesis was carried out with the Amersham Corp. in vitro mutagenesis kit using the mutagenic primer 5′-GGCAATCCACTGGGTGGCAGTG-3′ (the mismatches are underlined) complementary to the coding strand ofgalP. The base changes were confirmed by single-stranded dideoxynucleotide sequencing. A double-stranded 1.561-kilobase pairMluI-NdeI fragment containing the base changes was isolated from the bacteriophage M13 construct and substituted for the wild-type DNA in MluI-NdeI cut plasmid pPER3 to give plasmid pTPM6 (Asn394 → Gln). The substitution was confirmed by subcloning the DNA containing the mutation back into bacteriophage M13mp18 and dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Double-stranded sequencing of the entire mutant galP gene in the expression plasmid confirmed that there were no other base changes in thegalP gene sequence. The transport of radioisotope-labeled sugars into intact cells was measured after the cells were energized with 10 mm glycerol as described by Henderson et al. (43Henderson P.J.F. Giddens R.A. Jones-Mortimer M.C. Biochem. J. 1977; 162: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). All transport measurements were carried out on cells that had been grown on rich media producing levels of GalP expression less than 1% total membrane protein. The level of expression of the mutant GalP protein was very similar to that of wild type judging by Western blots (data not shown). The velocity ofd-galactose uptake (with d-galactose at 50 μm) without the addition of inhibiting sugar did not vary greatly between experiments showing little day to day variation (wild type 24.3 ± 2.8 nmol/mg/min (n = 10) and Asn394 → Gln 6.73 ± 0.88 nmol/mg/min (n = 10)). d-Galactose-promoted pH changes (sugar-H+ symport) were measured using 3.3 mm sugar with energy-depleted anaerobic suspensions of intact cells in 150 mm KCl, 2 mm glycylglycine, pH 6.6, as detailed by Henderson and Macpherson (47Henderson P.J.F. Macpherson A.J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 125: 387-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Initial velocities of d-galactose uptake into E. colistrains expressing wild-type and mutant GalP proteins were measured after the cells had been aerated in the presence of glycerol (10 mm) and a range of sugar concentrations for 3 min. Cells were made permeable to cytochalasin B and forskolin by treatment with Tris-EDTA (48Leive L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1965; 21: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Cells were grown for uptake experiments as described above. After washing with the growth volume twice in 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MES, pH 6.5, the cells were equilibrated in 200 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, before the addition of an equal volume of 200 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. After 30 min, 100 volumes of 150 mmKCl, 5 mm MES, pH 6.5, 10 mm MgSO4were added and the cells harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in the same buffer. Ligands were incorporated into membrane proteins by irradiation with ultraviolet light (13Cairns M.T. McDonald T.P. Horne P. Henderson P.J.F. Baldwin S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8176-8183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Carter-Su C. Pessin J.E. Mora R. Gitomer W. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5419-5425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inner membrane vesicles were preincubated with or without 500 mm d-galactose at 4 °C in photolabeling buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) and transferred to quartz cuvettes containing 0.4 nm 3-125I-APS-forskolin or 0.5 μm 4-[3H]cytochalasin B. The samples were flushed with argon to reduce free radical production and irradiated with ultraviolet light for 10 min. After irradiation, noncovalently bound ligand was removed by diluting the sample in photolabeling buffer containing 1% mercaptoethanol (for 3-125I-APS-forskolin) or unlabeled cytochalasin B (for 4-[3H]cytochalasin B) and centrifugation (130,000 ×g for 2 h at 4 °C). The resulting membrane pellet was resuspended in 15 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and assayed for protein. The proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The incorporation of 4-[3H]cytochalasin B was monitored by fluorography and the incorporation of 3-125I-APS-forskolin by autoradiography. Fluorescence spectra were measured in a Perkin-Elmer LS50B spectrophotofluorimeter. The protein was excited at either 280 or 297 nm and the fluorescence emission monitored between 300 and 400 nm. Rapid reactions were followed using an Applied Photophysics (London, UK) spectrophotofluorimeter, operated at 20 °C, as described by Walmsley et al. (14Walmsley A.R. Lowe A.G. Henderson P.J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 17Walmsley A.R. Martin G.E.M. Henderson P.J.F. J. Biol.

Fluorescence measurements were carried out in 50 mmpotassium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mmEDTA, buffered to pH 7.4 at 20 °C. Routinely the membranes were used at a protein concentration of 200 μg/ml, in the above buffer. Equilibrium dialysis was carried out as described by Walmsley et al. (50Walmsley A.R. Petro K.R. Henderson P.J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The binding of 12-[3H]forskolin and 4-[3H]cytochalasin B to inner membranes (1.0 mg/ml) containing GalP was measured over the range of 0.05–80 μm ligand at 4 °C. Ratios of bound to free ligand were calculated from the equilibrium distribution of the radiolabeled ligand and used to determine both theK d and the number of ligand binding sites by an unweighted nonlinear least-squares fit of the data to an hyperbola using the Biosoft program Ultrafit 2.1. The apparent K m values, with their standard deviations, for transport of radiolabeled sugar were obtained by a least-squares fit of the unweighted initial rate data directly to a hyperbola using Biosoft program Ultrafit 2.1. Generally, rates of the quench in the intrinsic fluorescence of GalP, when it was mixed with the antibiotics in a stopped-flow apparatus, were fitted to an exponential function using the non-linear least-squares regression program supplied with the Applied Photophysics SF.17MV stopped-flow equipment. The data sets, for the concentration dependence of the rate of binding of the antibiotics, were analyzed by fitting to the appropriate equation using the non-linear least-squares regression program SIGMA PLOT (Jandel Scientific). The transport ofd-galactose by the wild-type GalP protein, under energized conditions, was characterized by a hyperbolic increase in the initial rate with increasing concentrations of sugar. A least-squares fit yielded apparent K m and V maxvalues of 42.4–58.9 μm and 59.1–65.4 nmol/mg/min (Fig. 2 and Table I). TheK m and V max values quoted here and subsequently are apparent as it was not known whether the co-substrate, H+, was at saturating amounts. The substitution of Asn394 by Gln"

Interactions of GDP, Mg2+ and hadacidin are similar to those observed for the same ligands in the complex of IMP, GDP, NO3−, Mg2+ and hadacidin (Poland, B. W., Fromm, H. J. & Honzatko, R. B. (1996).J. Mol. Biol. 264, 1013–1027). Although crystals were grown from solutions containing 6-mercapto-IMP and GTP, the electron density at the active site is consistent with 6-thiophosphoryl-IMP and GDP. Asp-13 and Gln-224 probably work in concert to stabilize the 6-thioanion of 6-mercapto-IMP, which in turn is the nucleophile in the displacement of GDP from the γ-phosphate of GTP. Once formed, 6-thiophosphoryl-IMP is stable in the active site of the enzyme under the conditions of the structural investigation. The direct observation of 6-thiophosphoryl-IMP in the active site is consistent with the putative generation of 6-phosphoryl-IMP along the reaction pathway of the synthetase. Crystal structures of adenylosuccinate synthetase from Escherichia coli complexed with Mg2+, 6-thiophosphoryl-IMP, GDP, and hadacidin at 298 and 100 K have been refined to R-factors of 0.171 and 0.206 against data to 2.8 and 2.5 Å resolution, respectively.

The direct observation of 6-thiophosphoryl-IMP in the active site is consistent with the putative generation of 6-phosphoryl-IMP along the reaction pathway of the synthetase. 6-Mercaptopurine is used in the treatment of pediatric leukemia and other cancers (1De Abreu R.A. Sahota A. Taylor M. Purine and Pyrimidine Metabolism in Man VIII. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 195-200Google Scholar). The drug is transformed enzymically to 6-mercapto-IMP and then into other derivatives such as 6-thio-GTP, 6-thio-ITP and 6-thiomethyl-IMP. 6-Thio-GTP can be incorporated into DNA, increasing the susceptibility of DNA to damage. 6-Thiomethyl-IMP is a potent inhibitor of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase, suppressing de novo purine biosynthesis, and 6-mercapto-ITP is a potent inhibitor of RNA polymerase. Depletion of the adenine nucleotide pool (specifically ATP) by the action of 6-thiomethyl-IMP reduces levels of S-adenosyl-l-methionine, which in turn impedes methylation of DNA and RNA. Although mechanisms for the cytotoxic effects of 6-mercapto-IMP are known, the metabolic pathways by which 6-mercapto-IMP is inactivated as a drug are unclear. Adenylosuccinate synthetase (IMP:l-aspartate ligase (GDP-forming), EC 6.3.4.4) is likely to play a role in the metabolic effects of 6-mercapto-IMP. The synthetase governs the first committed step in the de novo biosynthesis of AMP (2Stayton M.M. Rudolph F.B. Fromm H.J. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1983; 22: 103-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), GTP + IMP +l-aspartate ⇌ GDP + P i + adenylosuccinate. 6-Mercapto-IMP is a competitive inhibitor with respect to IMP (3Rudolph F.B.

Biophys. 1977; 184: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and likely inhibits the enzyme in vivo. The combination of adenylosuccinate synthetase with adenylosuccinate, GDP, and thiophosphate (reverse reaction) leads to the slow generation of 6-mercapto-IMP, GTP, and aspartate (6Markham G.D. Reed G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6184-6189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, 6-mercapto-IMP, GTP, and aspartate in the presence of enzyme (forward reaction) gives no detectable level of adenylosuccinate. This apparent violation of microscopic reversibility has been explained by an equilibrium constant that significantly favors GTP, 6-mercapto-IMP, and aspartate over GDP, adenylosuccinate, and thiophosphate (6Markham G.D. Reed G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6184-6189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of 6-mercapto-IMP with adenylosuccinate synthetase then may contribute to the suppression of de novo purine biosynthesis but only if in vivo levels of IMP are low relative to those of 6-mercapto-IMP. We report here refined crystal structures at 298 and 100 K of adenylosuccinate synthetase from Escherichia coli, grown in the presence of 6-mercapto-IMP, GTP, Mg2+, and hadacidin. Hadacidin (see Fig. 1), a fermentation product of Penicillium frequentans (7Kaczka E.A. Gitterman C.O. Dulaney E.L. Folkers K. Biochemistry. 1962; 1: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), is a competitive inhibitor (K i ∼ 10−6m) with respect to aspartate (4Clark S.W. Rudolph F.B. Biochim. Biophys.

Biophys. 1977; 184: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); the only known function of hadacidin is the inhibition of adenylosuccinate synthetase (8Shigeura H.T. Gottlieb D. Shaw P. Antibiotics. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1967: 451-456Crossref Google Scholar). In the mechanism proposed for the synthetase by Lieberman (9Lieberman I. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 223: 327-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the γ-phosphate of GTP is transferred to the 6-oxygen of IMP, whereafter aspartate displaces phosphate from the 6-phosphoryl intermediate to form adenylosuccinate. Although the Lieberman (9Lieberman I. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 223: 327-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) mechanism enjoys substantial support from the literature (10Fromm H.J. Biochim.

Furthermore, 6-phosphoryl-IMP has never been isolated or synthesized. Regardless of temperature, however, a 6-thiophosphoryl intermediate sits at the IMP binding site in the crystal structures, hence providing the first direct observation of 6-thiophosphoryl-IMP and strong evidence in support of the catalytic mechanism proposed 40 years ago by Lieberman (9Lieberman I.

Starting phases for the 6-thiophosphoryl-IMP complex were calculated from the IMP/NO3− complex (15Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), omitting coordinates for water molecules, NO3−, and IMP. Refinement of the structures involved manual fitting of models to the electron density, using a Silicon Graphics 4D-25 and the program TOM (17Cambillau C. Horjales E. J. Mol. Graphics. 1987; 5: 174-177Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar), followed by a cycle of refinement using XPLOR (18Brünger, A. T. (1992) XPLOR, Version 3.1., Yale University Press, New Haven, CT.Google Scholar) on a Silicon Graphics 4D-35. Constants of force and geometry for the protein came from Engh & Huber (19Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). The geometry of hadacidin was based on a related structural fragment (20Bernardinelli G. Tronchet J.M.J. Bizzozero N. Z. Kristallog. 1991; 195: 135-138Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar), retrieved by a search of the Cambridge Data Base. Models of hadacidin with a planar nitrogen and with tetrahedral nitrogens inl- and d-configurations were refined individually. In early rounds of refinement, both crystal structures were heated to 2000 K and then cooled in steps of 25–300 K. In later rounds of refinement, the systems were heated to 1000 or 1500 K but then cooled in steps of 10 K. After the slow cooling protocol was completed (at 300 K), the models were subjected to 120 steps of conjugate gradient minimization, followed by 20 steps of individual B-parameter refinement. Individual B-parameters were subject to the following restraints: nearest neighbor, main chain atoms, 1.5 Å2; next to nearest neighbor, main chain atoms, 2.0 Å2; nearest neighbor, side chain atoms, 2.0 Å2; and next to nearest neighbor, side chain atoms, 2.5 Å2. Water molecules were added if (i) electron density at a level of 2.5ς was present in maps based on Fourier coefficients (F obs −F calc)e i αcalcand (2F obs −F calc)e i αcalc, and (ii) acceptable hydrogen bonds could be made to an existing atom of the model. If after refinement a site for a water molecule fell beyond 3.3 Å from its nearest neighbor, that site was omitted from the model. In addition, water molecules were deleted from the model if their thermal parameters exceeded 80 Å2. Harmonic restraints (50 kcal/mol) were placed on the positions of oxygen atoms of water molecules to allow new water molecules to relax by adjustments in orientation. Occupancies of water molecules were not refined because of the high correlation between occupancy and thermal parameters for data of 2.6 Å nominal resolution. Thus solvent sites with B values between 50 and 80 Å2 probably represent water molecules with occupancy parameters below 1.0 and thermal parameters substantially lower than those reported from the refinement. The model reported here has been deposited with the Protein Data bank, Brookhaven National Laboratory (code 1NHT). The method of Luzzati (21Luzzati V. Acta Crystallogr. 1952; 5: 802-810Crossref Google Scholar) indicates an uncertainty in coordinates of 0.30 Å. The amino acid sequence used in refinement is identical to that reported by Silva et al.(14Silva M.M. Poland B.W. Hoffman C.R. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 431-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Results of the refinement are in Table I. The Ramachandran plot (22Ramachandran G.N. Ramakrishnan C. Sasisekharan V. J. Mol. Biol. 1963; 7: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar) for the structures reported here are comparable with those of Poland et al. (15Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15753-15759Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the most apparent outlier is Gln-10, which exists in the same conformation in each of the five independent polypeptide chains of three crystal forms. The program PROCHECK (26Laskowski R.A. Mac Arthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) indicates better stereochemistry for both the low and room temperature models than is typical for a structure of 2.5 Å resolution. The low temperature data set is superior in nominal resolution (〈I〉 = 2ς(I) at 2.6 Å relative to 3.1 Å for the room temperature data). A much improved electron density map is the most significant consequence of the superior data acquired at low temperature. We observed no significant divergence between the room temperature and low temperature structures. The average thermal parameter in the low temperature model varies from 5–33 Å2 for atoms of the main chain and 5–37 Å2 for atoms of side chains. The corresponding variations for the room-temperature structure are 14–43 and 14–44 Å2, respectively, for main and side chain atoms. The variation in average thermal parameter as a function of residue number for the structures reported here are comparable with those of the IMP/NO3− complex (15Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The complex of 6-thiophosphoryl-IMP, GDP, Mg2+, and hadacidin (Fig. 1) is isomorphous to that of IMP, GDP, NO3−, Mg2+, and hadacidin (15Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and to that of hydantocidin 5′-phosphate, GDP, HPO42−, Mg2+, and hadacidin (25Poland B.W. Lee S.-F. Subramanian M.V. Siehl D.L. Anderson R.J. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15753-15759Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A view of one monomer of the synthetase dimer with associated ligands appears in Fig.2. Conformational changes in the synthetase upon ligation are described by Poland et al. (15Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) as are the interactions of GDP, Mg2+, and hadacidin, which are the same here within experimental error. Fig. 3 is a pictorial summary of the important interactions of ligands in the active site of the synthetase.Figure 3Diagram of selected hydrogen and coordinate bonding of ligands in the active site of adenylosuccinate synthetase.

The IMP and NO3− sites are connected by continuous electron density, which we can interpret only as a molecule of 6-thiophosphoryl-IMP (Fig. 4). Omit maps are in complete agreement with electron density maps generated from coefficients 2Fobs −F calc. Thermal parameters of atoms of 6-thiophosphoryl-IMP are comparable with those of the surrounding protein, suggesting full occupancy of the ligand. Thus, the electron density between the 6-sulfur and the phosphoryl group cannot arise as a consequence of the mutually exclusive binding of phosphate and 6-mercapto-IMP, with each ligand in partial occupancy. Finally, a model for 6-thiophosphoryl-IMP fits the electron density well, leaving behind no significant density in difference maps. Indeed, a difference map, based on observed data from the IMP/NO3− and 6-thiophosphoryl-IMP complexes and calculated phase angles from the IMP/NO3− complex, reveals a strong and well defined peak of electron density in the area between the 6-oxygen of IMP and the nitrogen of NO3− (Fig.4). Interactions involving the 5′-phosphate, the ribose, and the base (exclusive of the 6-thiophosphoryl group) of 6-thiophosphoryl-IMP are the same as those of IMP in an earlier study (15Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The 5′-phosphate hydrogen bonds with OG1 of Thr-129, backbone amide 129, ND2 of Asn-38, OG1 of Thr-239, and the guanidinium group of Arg-143 of the symmetry-related monomer (Table II). In addition, three water molecules, 554, 636, and 732, mediate interactions between the 5′-phosphate and the protein. The 5′-phosphate of 6-thiophosphoryl-IMP along with the side chain of Asp-114 (conserved in all known sequences of the synthetase) lie at the N terminus of helix H4. No direct hydrogen bonds, however, exist between helix H4 and either Asp-114 or the 5′-phosphate.Table IISelected contacts (less than 3.4 Å) involving 6-thiophosphoryl-IMPLigand atomContact atomDistance (Å)N1OD1 Asp-132.94N7NE2 Gln-2242.66S6NE2 Gln-2242.94O2′NH2 Arg-3032.63O Val-2732.87O3′OW Wat-6992.93OW Wat-5243.08O1AN Thr-1292.93OG1 Thr-1292.68OW Wat-6362.69O2ANH1 Arg-1432-aSymmetry-related subunit.3.17OW Wat-7322.60O3AND2 Asn-382.90OG1 Thr-2392.51OW Wat-5543.14O2N Asp-132.58NZ Lys-162.79O1NZ Lys-162.72NE2 His-413.27N Gln-2242.70O3Mg2+2.17O1B GDP2.61N Gly-403.242-a Symmetry-related subunit. Open table in a new tab The 2′-OH group of the ribose of 6-thiophosphoryl-IMP hydrogen bonds with the guanidinium of Arg-303 and the 3′-OH hydrogen bonds with waters 524 and 699, which in turn interact with backbone carbonyls 126 and 273, respectively. Although the data are not of sufficient resolution to unambiguously determine the state of puckering of the ribose, the best fit to the electron density occurs with a low energy 2′-endo conformation (pseudorotation phase angle, 166°). The torsion angles O5′-C5′-C4′-C3′ (γ by convention) and O4′-C1′-N9-C4 (χ by convention) are 44° (+synclinal) and −135° (anti), respectively. The base of 6-thiophosphoryl-IMP interacts with the amide side chain of Gln-224 through its N7 and S6 atoms and with the side chain of Asp-13 through its N1 position. Interactions of 6-thiophosphoryl-IMP are dominated by the 6-thiophosphoryl group. Backbone amides 13, 40, and 224, NZ of Lys-16, NE2 of His-41, and NE2 of Gln-224 hydrogen bond with oxygen and sulfur atoms of the thiophosphoryl group (Fig. 5). In addition, one of the oxygens of the thiophosphoryl group coordinates to the Mg2+. The oxygen atoms of the thiophosphoryl group correspond in position to the oxygens of NO3− in the IMP/NO3− complex (15Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and to three of four oxygens of HPO42− in the hydantocidin 5′-phosphate complex (25Poland B.W. Lee S.-F. Subramanian M.V. Siehl D.L. Anderson R.J. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15753-15759Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). His 41 interacts with the β-phosphate of GDP when NO3− resides in the phosphoryl site, as observed in the IMP/NO3− complex (15Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the hydantocidin 5′-phosphate complex (25Poland B.W. Lee S.-F. Subramanian M.V. Siehl D.L. Anderson R.J. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15753-15759Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which has HPO42− at the phosphoryl site, His-41 interacts with the HPO42− molecule, similar to the interaction observed for His-41 here. Presumably the increase in formal electrostatic charge from −1 to −2 is responsible for the interaction of His-41 with the anion located in the phosphoryl site. Markham and Reed (7Kaczka E.A. Gitterman C.O. Dulaney E.L. Folkers K. Biochemistry. 1962; 1: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) deduced a ΔG of +5 kcal/mol at pH 7 for the reaction: GTP + 6-thiophosphoryl-IMP +l-aspartate ⇌ GDP + thiophosphate + adenylosuccinate. Even in the absence of hadacidin, which leads to the dead end kinetic complex observed here, the combination of GTP, 6-mercapto-IMP, aspartate, Mg2+, and enzyme should lead to undetectable levels of product. A plausible outcome of the crystallization of GTP, 6-mercapto-IMP, Mg2+, and hadacidin, then, would be a 6-mercapto-IMP-GTP or 6-mercapto-IMP-GDP complex. The ratio of GDP to GTP in the active site would depend largely on the rate of hydrolysis of GTP in the bulk solvent and the rate of exchange of guanine nucleotides between the active site and the bulk solvent. Instead, the active site contains 6-thiophosphoryl-IMP and GDP. The presence of 6-thiophosphoryl-IMP in the active site indicates a lower free energy for the 6-thiophosphoryl-IMP/enzyme complex than for the substrate/enzyme complex. Thus, the enzyme must be a thermodynamic trap for the 6-thiophosphoryl intermediate. Several factors favor the formation of 6-thiophosphoryl-IMP in the active site of the synthetase. First, the pK a of N1 of 6-mercapto-IMP is approximately 1–1.5 pH units lower than that of N1 of IMP. Thus, Asp-13, which is a putative catalytic base in the abstraction of the proton from N1 of IMP (15Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), may be more effective in stabilizing the ionized form of the 6-mercapto nucleotide relative to the 6-oxo nucleotide (Fig. 6). In addition, the S-P thioester bond (approximately 2.1 Å in length) is 0.5 Å longer than the O-P ester bond. The increased bond length allows the three oxygens of the 6-thiophosphoryl group to occupy the positions of oxygen atoms of NO3− in the IMP/NO3− complex (15Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Markham and Reed (5Markham D.G. Reed G.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 184: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) have shown synergy in the binding of IMP, GDP, Mg2+, and NO3− to the synthetase. The distance between N of NO3− and the 6-oxygen of IMP in the IMP/NO3− complex is 2.7 Å, implying a strong electrostatic interaction between an electron deficient N of NO3− and an electron-rich 6-oxygen of IMP (15Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the present study, the 6-sulfur (presumably stabilized initially as a thioanion) and the phosphorus atom of PO3− (putatively derived from the γ-phosphate of GTP and stabilized in the NO3− site) form a covalent bond as a consequence of electrostatic interactions and the increased atomic radii of sulfur and phosphorus relative to oxygen and nitrogen. The proposed mechanism for the formation of 6-thiophosphoryl-IMP in the active site appears in Fig. 6. The interaction involving Asp-13 identifies it as a possible catalytic base in the abstraction of the proton from N1 of 6-mercapto-IMP and generation of a 6-thioanion. In fact, the natural substrate IMP may be in the 6-oxyanion state, when bound to the active site (15Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Gln-224 may stabilize the 6-thioanion further by a hydrogen bond interaction. Mutation of Asp-13 to alanine inactivates the synthetase completely (27Kang C. Poland B.W. Gorrell A. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11881-11885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and mutation of Gln-224 to glutamate reduces k cat by 1000-fold at pH 7.7. 1W. Wang, R. B. Honzatko, and H. J. Fromm, unpublished results. The interaction involving Gln-224 is relevant to reported differences in the recognition of IMP analogs by the synthetase from mammals and leishmanial parasites (28Spector T. Jones T.E. Elion G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8422-8426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Spector T. Berens R.L. Marr J.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1982; 31: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Allopurinol ribonucleotide, which differs from IMP at position 7 of the purine ring system, is not recognized as a substrate by mammalian adenylosuccinate synthetase but is a poor substrate for the synthetase from leishmanial parasites. As Gln-224 alone recognizes N7 of IMP, the equivalent position in the synthetases from other organisms may be an important determinant of substrate specificity. Unfortunately, the sequence of the synthetase from a leishmanial parasite is not available. The 6-thioanion then displaces GDP from the γ-phosphate of bound GTP (Fig. 6). Both His-41 and Mg2+ probably play important roles in stabilizing charge development on the β- and γ-phosphates of GTP in the transition state (15Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A His-41 to asparagine mutant is inactive (27Kang C. Poland B.W. Gorrell A. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11881-11885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and Mg2+ is required for activity of the synthetase (9Lieberman I. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 223: 327-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second reaction governed by the synthetase involves the nucleophilic displacement of thiophosphate from the 6-phosphoryl intermediate by the amino group of l-aspartate (Fig. 7). The conformation and interactions of aspartate are inferred from enzyme-bound hadacidin (15Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The putative conformation of bound aspartate favors a hydrogen bond between its β-carboxylate and its α-amino group, suggesting a catalytic function for the β-carboxylate in abstracting a proton from that amino group. No direct evidence is available regarding the catalytic role of the β-carboxylate of aspartate. However, an α-amino acid is a substrate of the synthetase only if it bears a negatively charged substituent with carboxylate-like geometry at the β-carbon (30Porter D.J.T. Rudie N.G. Bright H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 225: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Hydroxylamine is the only known substrate for the synthetase that departs significantly from aspartate in structure and charge distribution. Hydroxylamine may not require the catalytic support of the β-carboxylate because the pK a of its amine is significantly lower than that of the α-amino group of aspartate. Assuming a catalytic function for the β-carboxylate of aspartate (there are no other candidates provided by the enzyme (15Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)), a total of three hydrogen bonds, then, may be involved in promoting the second reaction: (i) the putative interaction between the α-amino and β-carboxylate groups of aspartate, (ii) the hydrogen bond between Asp-13 and N1 of the phosphoryl intermediate, and (iii) the hydrogen bond between His-41 and the 6-phosphoryl group. The first interaction enhances the nucleophilicity of the amino group, the second hydrogen bond enhances the electrophilicity of C6 of the intermediate, and the third hydrogen bond stabilizes the developing charge on the leaving group (thiophosphate in this case). The extent to which these three hydrogen bonds promote catalysis in the second reaction cannot be answered on the basis of the present study. Poland et al. (15Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) suggest a more significant interaction between Asp-13 and Mg2+ after formation of the phosphoryl intermediate, hence transforming Asp-13 from a catalytic base in the phosphotransfer step into a catalytic acid for the second reaction. In the present complex, we observe no significant movement of Asp-13 toward the Mg2+. Coordinate uncertainty (0.3 Å), however, could obscure small but catalytically significant changes in the distance of Asp-13 to Mg2+. Lieberman (9Lieberman I. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 223: 327-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was the first to propose the formation of 6-phosphoryl-IMP as an intermediate on the reaction pathway governed by the synthetase, but the results of his study are consistent with two other proposed mechanisms (2Stayton M.M. Rudolph F.B. Fromm H.J. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1983; 22: 103-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Miller and Buchannan (31Miller R.W. Buchanan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 485-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggest an attack of aspartate on C6 of IMP in concert with an attack by the 6-oxygen of IMP on the γ-phosphate of GTP. Markham and Reed (6Markham G.D. Reed G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6184-6189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were unable to find spectral evidence for the formation of a 6-phosphoryl intermediate and, as a consequence, suggested that the addition of aspartate to C6 of IMP preceded the phosphorylation of O6. Isotope exchange studies at equilibrium by Cooper et al. (12Cooper B.F. Fromm H.J. Rudolph F.B. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7323-7327Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), however, support the formation of 6-phosphoryl-IMP prior to the nucleophilic attack of aspartate. Furthermore, Bass et al.(11Bass M.B. Fromm H.J. Rudolph F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12330-12333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated the chemical exchange of 18O from the β,γ-bridging position of GTP to the oxygens of the β-phosphate of GTP in the presence of enzyme and IMP or in the presence of enzyme, IMP, and succinate (as an analog of aspartate). Isotope exchange could occur only if the γ-phosphate dissociates from GTP for an interval long enough to allow the rotational isomerization of the β-phosphate group. The absence of labeled phosphate in solution demonstrated that the dissociated γ-phosphate remained bound to the enzyme. As IMP was required for isotope exchange, Bass et al. (11Bass M.B. Fromm H.J. Rudolph F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12330-12333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the dissociated γ-phosphate existed as 6-phosphoryl-IMP. The observation here of 6-thiophosphoryl-IMP in the active site of the synthetase is entirely consistent with the results and conclusions of the isotope exchange studies. We thank Drs. Fred Rudolph and Bruce Cooper for their generous gift of hadacidin."
https://openalex.org/W2077700733,"In this study, we investigated the role of specific amino acid residues present near the amino terminus of the 9–2 isozyme of 2′–5′-oligoadenylate synthetase. In vitroexpression of deletion mutants showed that residues 1–9 are required for enzyme activity. Within this region, residues 3, 7, and 8 were found to be conserved among all known isozymes of 2′–5′-oligoadenylate synthetase. Mutation of these residues singly or in combination resulted in partial or total loss of enzyme activity. Substitution of the proline residue at position 7 by different residues caused a partial or complete loss of activity. The properties of the inactive P7Q mutant were further explored by expressing the protein in bacteria. The bacterially expressed protein was also enzymatically inactive. The mutant protein could bind the substrate ATP and the activator double-stranded RNA normally. Oligomerization properties of the protein were examined by an affinity-based interaction assay and by glycerol gradient centrifugation; there was no detectable difference between the wild type and the P7Q mutant. These results demonstrated the importance of the proline residue at position 7 in conferring enzyme activity to the protein without affecting its other properties. In this study, we investigated the role of specific amino acid residues present near the amino terminus of the 9–2 isozyme of 2′–5′-oligoadenylate synthetase. In vitroexpression of deletion mutants showed that residues 1–9 are required for enzyme activity. Within this region, residues 3, 7, and 8 were found to be conserved among all known isozymes of 2′–5′-oligoadenylate synthetase. Mutation of these residues singly or in combination resulted in partial or total loss of enzyme activity.

Sen G.C. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Raven, New York, NY1996: 375-399Google Scholar,2Hovanessian A. J. Interferon Res. 1991; 11: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Their synthesis is induced by interferon (IFN), and they all polymerize ATP into 2′–5′-linked oligoadenylates that activate the latent ribonuclease RNase L. The 2–5(A) synthetase/RNase L pathway is responsible for mediating IFNs antiviral action against specific groups of viruses, and it has also been implicated in the antigrowth effects of IFN. For manifesting their enzyme activity, the 2–5(A) synthetases require a co-factor, namely double-stranded (ds) RNA. Another IFN-induced enzyme that requires dsRNA as a co-factor is the protein kinase, PKR, which, when activated, can phosphorylate the translation initiation factor eIF-2 and the transcriptional inhibitory factor IκB (1Vilcek J. Sen G.C. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Raven, New York, NY1996: 375-399Google Scholar, 3Maran A. Maitra R.K. Kumar A. Dong B. Xiao W. Li G. Williams B.R.

The dsRNA-binding domain of PKR has been defined, and essential residues within this domain have been identified (5Patel R.C. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7671-7676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6McCormack S.J. Thomis D.C. Samuel C.E. Virology. 1992; 188: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 7Feng G.S.

Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that this domain overlaps with a dimerization domain of PKR (10Patel R.C. Stanton P. McMillan N.M.J. Williams B.R.G. Sen G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8283-8287Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The dsRNA binding motif of PKR is shared by a number of dsRNA-binding proteins from a variety of organisms (11St. Johnston D. Brown N.H. Gall J.G. Jantsch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10979-10983Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). 2–5(A) synthetases, however, do not have this motif, and the nature of their interaction with dsRNA is quite distinct from that of PKR. The different isozymes of 2–5(A) synthetase are structurally related. There is also extremely high sequence conservation among similar isozymes from different species (12Ghosh S.K. Kusari J. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Samanta H. Kumar R. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15293-15299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These enzymes are classified into three families: large, medium, and small (2Hovanessian A. J. Interferon Res. 1991; 11: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The large 2–5(A) synthetase has a molecular mass of about 100 kDa; the corresponding cDNA and the gene have not yet been cloned. The medium human 2–5(A) synthetase has a molecular mass of about 69 kDa. Two isozymes of this family are derived from alternatively spliced mRNAs encoded by one gene. This gene appears to have arisen by duplication of a gene encoding a small synthetase (13Marie I. Hovanessian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9933-9939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The small synthetases have molecular masses ranging from 40 to 46 kDa. Two human small synthetases, E16 and E18, are the products of alternatively spliced mRNAs of the same gene (14Chebath J. Benech P. Revel M. Vigneron M. Nature. 1987; 330: 587-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The same is true for the murine 9–2 and 3–9 synthetases (12Ghosh S.K. Kusari J. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Samanta H. Kumar R. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15293-15299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in mouse there is an additional small synthetase, L-3, which is encoded by a separate gene (15Ichii Y. Fukunaga R. Shiojiri S. Sokawa Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 10117Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The different isozymes partition differently to various subcellular compartments, which could be caused by the different post-translational modifications they carry (16Marie I. Svab J. Robert N. Galabru J. Hovanessian A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18601-18607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the primary structures of at least six 2–5(A) synthetase isozymes are known, the structural features responsible for their dsRNA binding activity and their enzyme activity remain to be identified. We have previously reported that truncation of 94 residues, but not of 70 residues, from the carboxyl terminus of the 9–2 protein causes a loss of its enzyme activity (12Ghosh S.K. Kusari J. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Samanta H. Kumar R. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15293-15299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report that the loss of even nine residues from the amino terminus of the 9–2 protein also causes a complete loss of enzyme activity. Sequence comparison and site-directed mutagenesis within this region revealed the importance of the residues at positions 3, 7, and 8 in determining the enzyme activity of the protein. Detailed analysis of the properties of one mutant, P7Q, is presented here. Poly(I)·poly(C)-agarose and m7GpppGm were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Polyethyleneimine cellulose plates were from EM Science. Restriction enzymes, RNase inhibitor, and other fine chemicals were from Boehringer Mannheim. [α-32P]ATP (specific activity, 800 Ci/mmol) and [35S]methionine (specific activity, 1000 Ci/mmol) were from DuPont NEN. Plasmid pGEM4 and rabbit reticulocyte lysate were from Promega. ATP-agarose containing a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, adenosine 5′-γ-4 aminophenyl triphosphate, was purchased from Sigma. TNT, a DNA-driven in vitro translation system, was purchased from Promega. Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody Sepharose was purchased from Eastman Kodak Co. The substitution mutants were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using appropriate primers carrying the desired mutations. cDNA products of PCR were digested with the appropriate enzymes and joined to the bulk of the coding region of wild type synthetase. The portion of the cDNA generated by PCR was completely sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutation and the absence of any other mutation. The mutant cDNAs were expressed in vitro from a NS-9–2 hybrid cDNA clone (12Ghosh S.K. Kusari J. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Samanta H. Kumar R. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15293-15299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or expressed in Escherichia coli using the pET15b vector as described (17Desai S.Y. Patel R.C. Sen G.C. Malhotra P. Ghadge G.D. Thimmapaya B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3454-3461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For generating the deletion mutants, the expression vectors pGEM39T, -5T, or -1T were used (5Patel R.C. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7671-7676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The +2 mutant encoded a protein with Met-Gly-Pro-Asp (residue 2 of authentic 9–2), Δ9 encoded a protein with Met-Gly-Pro-Ser (residue 10 of authentic 9–2), and Δ23 encoded a protein with Met-Ala-Pro-Cys (residue 24 of authentic 9–2) at the amino terminus. All the cDNAs to be transcribed were cloned in pGEM4 in an orientation appropriate for the synthesis of sense strand RNA by SP6 RNA polymerase. The capped mRNAs were synthesized from NS-9–2 hybrid cDNAs linearized by digestion with HinfI at amino acid 344. A typical transcription mixture (40-μl volume) contained 2 μg of DNA template and 20 units of SP6 RNA polymerase in a buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 6 mmMgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 40 units of RNase inhibitor, 500 μm each of ATP, CTP, UTP, 50 μm GTP, and 500 μm m7GpppGm. The reaction was incubated for 1 h at 30 °C followed by digestion of the template with 5 units of DNase I at 37 °C for 15 min. The transcribed products were deproteinized by extracting twice with phenol/chloroform and once with chloroform followed by precipitation with ethanol. The respective mRNAs were translated in an mRNA-dependent protein-synthesizing system prepared from nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Typically 500 ng of mRNA was translated in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing 17.5 μl of reticulocyte lysate, 20 units of RNase inhibitor, 12.5 μCi of [35S]methionine, and 1 μl of amino acid mixture without methionine. Incubations were at 30 °C for 90 min. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Alternatively, the plasmid DNA was used directly in a coupled transcription-translation system. Synthetase assay was according to the method of Moryet al. (18Mory Y. Vaks B. Chebath J. J. Interferon Res. 1989; 9: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In vitrotranslated protein products were separated on SDS-PAGE and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. For enzyme assay, equal quantities of translated proteins were used in the same volume of translation mixture. If required, translation mixture without any added mRNA was used as a dilutant. Bacterially produced synthetase was purified and used directly for enzyme assay. Unless otherwise specified, 10 μl of reaction mixture containing the enzyme, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm magnesium acetate, 2.5 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm ATP, 5 μCi of [α-32P]ATP, and 50 μg/ml poly(I)·poly(C) was incubated for 2 h at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by boiling for 3 min and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and 8 μl of the supernatant was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with 3 μl of 1 unit/μl calf intestine alkaline phosphatase to convert the unreacted [α-32P]ATP to inorganic phosphate. Two μl of the sample were then spotted on a polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography plate and resolved in 750 mm KH2PO4, pH 3.5. The 2–5(A) formed was then quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis and expressed as arbitrary units. Hexahistidine-tagged synthetase was expressed in bacteria and purified as described previously (17Desai S.Y. Patel R.C. Sen G.C. Malhotra P. Ghadge G.D. Thimmapaya B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3454-3461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The binding reaction contained approximately 100 ng of purified 2–5(A) synthetase, 100 μg/ml poly(A), 1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm magnesium acetate, and 50,000 cpm of an 85-bp labeled dsRNA (19Patel R.C. Sen G.C. Cell. & Mol. Biol. Res. 1995; 40: 671-682Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was incubated on ice for 20 min followed by the addition of glycerol dye and underwent electrophoresis onto a 4% polyacrylamide gel at 150 V in 50 mm Tris/glycine buffer. The gel was prerun for 1 h in the same buffer. For supershifting the complex, the antipeptide B antibody (20Chebath J. Benech P. Hovanessian A. Galabru J. Revel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3852-3857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used. [35S]Methionine-labeled hexahistidine-tagged WT and P7Q mutant proteins were synthesizedin vitro using a coupled T7 transcription translation system (Promega) and the cognate pET15b constructs. The proteins were bound to nickel-Sepharose (Novagen) and eluted with a buffer containing 100 mm EDTA, 400 mm NaCl, and 20 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5. The eluted samples were dialyzed against a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 10% glycerol and concentrated to a smaller volume using microcon concentrators. The purified radiolabeled proteins were bound to ATP-agarose or agarose in the binding buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mmmagnesium acetate, and 2.5 mm dithiothreitol) for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence of 50 μg/ml poly(I)·poly(C). Before binding, the resins were presoaked and washed three times in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, incubated with reticulocytic lysate at 4 °C for 30 min in the same buffer, washed with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 500 mm NaCl, and equilibrated against the binding buffer. This protocol of resin pretreatment reduces nonspecific binding of proteins (21Haystead C.M.M. Gregory P. Sturgill T.W. Haystead T.A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). After binding the radiolabeled proteins to ATP-agarose, the resin was washed three times with 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. Finally, the proteins bound to the resin were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, electrophoresed, and quantitated by autoradiography and PhosphorImager analysis. This assay was done as previously described (12Ghosh S.K. Kusari J. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Samanta H. Kumar R. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15293-15299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For adding the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) to the carboxyl terminus of the 9–2 protein, the TGA stop codon in 9–2 was mutated to AGA, and a TCT codon appeared after that. These mutations were achieved by PCR using the appropriate primers. Since the newly created AGATCT sequence is a BglII site, the 9–2 cDNA can be cut open there and joined to a synthetic DNA containing a BglII sticky end at the 5′ followed by codons to encode the FLAG epitope, DYKDDDDK, and a stop codon. The final protein contained two residues, Arg and Ser (encoded by theBglII site) in between the last residue of 9–2 (Ser) and the first residue of FLAG (Asp). For carrying out this construction, part of 9–2 cDNA was copied by PCR using a sense primer from nucleotide 630 to 653 and an antisense primer containing theBglII site for mutating the termination codon. The blunt-ended PCR product was cloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript. The clone was digested with BglII (cuts at the end of 9–2) and SmaI (cuts in the vector polylinker), and the FLAG double-stranded oligonucleotide (BglII overhang at the 5′ end and blunt at the 3′ end) was ligated to the plasmid. The synthetic oligonucleotide was not phosphorylated to prevent its oligomerization. Finally, the 9–2 FLAG sequence from this clone was released by BamHI (cuts in the 9–2 body) andKpnI (cuts in the plasmid) digestion and swapped in the place of the same fragment generated from NS9–2 in pGEM4 (12Ghosh S.K. Kusari J. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Samanta H. Kumar R. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15293-15299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 9–2 FLAG mRNA can be transcribed from the final plasmid, pG1 in pGEM4, using SP6 RNA polymerase. The 9–2 FLAG protein (48.8 kDa) and the wild type or mutant 9–2 protein (47.5 kDa) were co-translated using the TNT translation system and [35S]cysteine according to the manufacturer's instructions. The translated products were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the amount of each protein synthesized was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis of the gel. For measuring potential interaction between the co-translated proteins, the 9–2 FLAG protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody-Sepharose, and co-precipitation of the 9–2 protein without a FLAG was monitored. The immunoprecipitation was done in RIPA buffer (150 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0). 30 μl of the antibody-Sepharose (2.38 mg/ml) was suspended in 500 μl of RIPA buffer and washed twice. It was then incubated in 500 μl of buffer containing 1.5 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and 3 μl/ml reticulocyte lysate for 15 min at 25 °C with continuous mixing. The pre-equilibrated Sepharose was centrifuged down and resuspended in 500 μl of buffer containing the sample of 5 μl of translation products in reticulocyte lysate. The suspension was incubated at 25 °C for 1 h with continuous mixing. The continuous mixing during presoaking and sample binding was achieved by taping the Eppendorf tube containing the suspension horizontally to the platform of an orbital shaker and shaking it at 160 rpm. After sample binding, the Sepharose beads were centrifuged down and washed four times with RIPA buffer. Finally, the beads were suspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled. The eluted proteins were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. 11.4 ml of glycerol gradients (5–20% v/v) were prepared in the gradient buffer containing 400 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and equilibrated to 4 °C. 10 μl ofin vitro translated proteins were diluted with 100 μl of gradient buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and layered on the top of the glycerol gradient. The gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SW 41 ultracentrifuge rotor at 4 °C for 30 h at 38,000 rpm. After centrifugation, the gradients were fractionated by using a peristaltic pump and a capillary tube inserted from the top and reaching to the bottom of the tube. 300-μl fractions were collected. Proteins present in 200 μl of alternate fractions were precipitated with 1.0 ml of cold acetone in the presence of 50 μg of bovine serum albumin. The protein pellets were centrifuged out, dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and subjected to gel electrophoresis. The 9–2 band in each fraction was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. We have previously shown that residues 345–414, present at the carboxyl terminus of the 9–2 isozyme, are not required for 2–5(A) synthetase activity. Further deletion, however, destroys the protein's ability to polymerize ATP but not to bind dsRNA. In the current study, we inquired if deletions from the amino terminus can be tolerated for enzyme activity. Two deletion mutants missing residues 1–23 (Δ23) and 1–9 (Δ9) were synthesized by in vitrotranslation using appropriate cDNAs. These proteins bound to poly(I)·poly(C)-agarose (data not shown) but were enzymatically inactive (Fig. 1). Although there was a low level of activity contributed by the endogenous 2–5(A) synthetase present in reticulocyte lysates, the in vitro translation products of Δ9 (lane 2) and Δ23 (lane 3) cDNAs were no more active than the negative control (lane 5). In contrast, the in vitro translated wild type protein was highly active (lane 4). The way the Δ9 and the Δ23 mutants were constructed at their amino termini, there were two additional residues including a proline residue in addition to the initiator methionine. Since proline is known to profoundly influence local protein structure, we wondered whether the lack of activity of the mutants was due to an altered conformation near the amino terminus. This does not appear to be the case since another mutant, +2, carrying methionine, glycine, and proline at the amino terminus of full-length 9–2, was highly active (lane 1). To find out if the residues present near the amino terminus of the 9–2 protein are conserved among other isozymes of 2–5(A) synthetase, we did an appropriate homology search (Table I). Nine residues at the amino terminus of 9–2 were totally conserved in the mouse 3–9 and the human E-16 and E-18 isozymes. Residues Leu, Pro, and Ala at positions 3, 7, and 8 were also conserved in the L-3 isozyme at positions 5, 9, and 10, respectively. The 69K medium isozyme is thought to be a composite of two halves, each of which resembles the small synthetase isozyme. We found that the Leu and Pro residues are also conserved in both halves of the medium isozyme, whereas the Ala residue is conserved in the amino-terminal half but replaced by Gly in the carboxyl-terminal half. Thus, it appears that the LXXXPA motif is present near the amino termini of all known 2–5(A) synthetase isozymes.Table ISequence homology near the amino termini of 2–5(A) synthetase isozymesSynthetase isozymeResidue numberAmino acid sequence9–21–9M D L R N T P A K3–91–9M D L R N T P A KL-33–11H G L R S I P A WE-161–9M D L R N T P A KE-181–9M D L R N T P A K69K I6–14S Q L S S V P A Q69K II338–346A P L P T T P G HThe top three synthetase isozymes are murine, and the bottom four are human. Except for the bottom two, all are isozymes of the small synthetase. The bottom two are the two homologous regions, I and II, of the medium synthetase (13Marie I. Hovanessian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9933-9939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conserved residues are indicated by bold letters. Open table in a new tab The top three synthetase isozymes are murine, and the bottom four are human. Except for the bottom two, all are isozymes of the small synthetase.

Conserved residues are indicated by bold letters. To examine the functional significance of the conserved Leu, Pro, and Ala residues at positions 3, 7, and 8, we mutated them individually in the context of the 9–2 cDNA sequence. A double mutant at positions 7 and 8 was also produced. Each of these mutant proteins was generated by in vitro translation and assayed for enzyme activity. They were all translated equally well (Fig.2 A and data not shown) and bound dsRNA as efficiently as the wild type protein (data not shown). Their enzymatic activities, however, were quite different. The L3H mutant was 30% as active as the wild type protein, whereas the A8D mutant had about 18% activity. In contrast, the activities of the P7Q and the P7Q/A8D mutants were not any higher than the background activity present in the reticulocyte lysate. Since this background activity varied from lot to lot of the commercial lysates used, these experiments were repeated 10 times with different lots of cDNAs and reticulocyte lysates (Fig.2 B). Given the small range of variability from experiment to experiment, it was reasonable to conclude that the P7Q and the double mutant were totally inactive, whereas the L3H and A8D mutants were partially active. Since the P7Q mutant was totally inactive, we wondered whether the Pro residue is absolutely necessary for the enzyme to be active. To examine this possibility, Pro was replaced by several other amino acids by site-directed mutagenesis. The corresponding mutant proteins were translated in vitro, and their enzyme activities were measured. All mutations caused partial losses of enzyme activity, but the degrees of inactivation were different for different substitutions (Fig. 3). Between the two aromatic residues, Phe and Tyr, substitution by Phe was more detrimental. Substitution of Pro by charged residues Glu or Lys also inactivated the protein partially. Substitution by Thr, a polar residue, had a degree of effect very similar to that of Tyr, another polar residue. Leu, a hydrophobic residue, had strong effects like Phe, which was the only other hydrophobic residue tested. These results demonstrated that the presence of Pro at position 7 was not absolutely required for enzyme activity. However, compared with all of the mutations tested, Pro was the best residue to be at that position, since no substitution increased the activity. The degree of reduction in the activity could not be readily correlated with any simple property of the substituting residue. To further test the properties of proteins carrying a mutation at position 7, the P7Q and the P7Q/A8D mutants were expressed in E. coli as hexahistidine-tagged proteins and purified by nickel-agarose chromatography. The mutant proteins were devoid of any enzyme activity, whereas the wild type protein was highly active (Fig.4). Over a large range of protein concentrations, the activity of the WT protein increased linearly, but even at the highest concentration tested, the mutant proteins were enzymatically inactive. 2–5(A) synthetases use ATP as the substrate and dsRNA as the activator, and hence, they have to be able to bind these two molecules for being enzymatically active. These binding properties of the P7Q mutant were examined in the next experiments. We have previously described a poly()I·poly(C)-agarose binding assay for mapping the dsRNA-binding domain of 2–5(A) synthetase (12Ghosh S.K. Kusari J. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Samanta H. Kumar R. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15293-15299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same assay was used for measuring the dsRNA binding activity of the P7Q mutant (Fig. 5). It could bind dsRNA as well as the WT protein. A different assay was used to measure the dsRNA binding ability of bacterially produced 2–5(A) synthetase proteins. A radiolabeled 85-bp dsRNA probe was used to perform electrophoretic mobility shift assays. No shifted complex was observed when bovine serum albumin was added to the probe (Fig.6 A, lane 2), but as reported previously (19Patel R.C. Sen G.C. Cell. & Mol. Biol. Res. 1995; 40: 671-682Google Scholar) two shifted complexes were produced in the presence of the dsRNA-binding domain of PKR (Fig. 6 A, lane 3). The wild type synthetase (Fig. 6 B, lane 1) and the mutant (Fig. 6 B, lane 4) produced one shifted complex that was not supershifted by a non-immune serum (Fig.6 B, lanes 2 and 5), but a synthetase-specific antipeptide antiserum (20Chebath J. Benech P. Hovanessian A. Galabru J. Revel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3852-3857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) supershifted and stabilized the complexes (Fig. 6 B, lanes 3 and6). These results demonstrated that the synthetase protein could form a specific complex with dsRNA, and this property was not affected by the P7Q mutation.Figure 6Electrophoretic mobility shift assay of bacterially produced WT and mutant synthetase. An 85-bp-labeled dsRNA was used as the probe. A, lane 1, no addition; lane 2, bovine serum albumin; lane 3, double-stranded RNA binding domain of PKR.

ATP-agarose chromatography has been used for this purpose in the case of protein kinases (21Haystead C.M.M. Gregory P. Sturgill T.W. Haystead T.A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Using that method, we could demonstrate that the mutant and the WT synthetase could bind ATP equally well (Fig.7). Of the total input, 48% of the mutant and 54% of the WT proteins bound to ATP-agarose, whereas only 10% of the mutant protein bound nonspecifically to agarose. Thus, the inactivity of the mutant could not be attributed to its inability to bind ATP. It has been shown that the small family of 2–5(A) synthetases, as isolated from interferon-treated human cells, can form tetramers (16Marie I. Svab J. Robert N. Galabru J. Hovanessian A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18601-18607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been speculated that it is the tetrameric form of the protein that is enzymatically active. We wondered whether the P7Q mutation affected the oligomerization property of the protein. For measuring the protein-protein interaction property of 2–5(A) synthetase and its derivatives, we developed a novel affinity assay. Because of the inherent experimental convenience, we wanted an assay to quickly examine whether an in vitro translated mutant synthetase can bind to wild type synthetase. For standardizing this assay, a FLAG epitope-tagged WT 9–2 synthetase cDNA was constructed. The corresponding protein was expressed in vitro along with the WT 9–2 or mutant 9–2 proteins. The FLAG-tagged protein was isolated by immunoaffinity purification using a FLAG-antibody resin, and co-purification of the co-translated protein without a FLAG tag was monitored. The FLAG-tagged and untagged proteins could be identified by their electrophoretic mobility differences. When an unrelated protein, luciferase, was co-translated, it did not co-purify with 9–2 FLAG (Fig. 8,lanes 1 and 2), but co-translation of 9–2 FLAG and 9–2 WT caused the untagged protein to co-purify with 9–2 FLAG (lanes 5 and 9). The same was true for P7Q 9–2 (lanes 6 and 10). When untagged 9–2 was translated by itself (lane 3), no labeled protein was purified (lane 7), thus validating the method. As expected, all of translated 9–2 FLAG protein was purified by the affinity resin (lanes 4 and 8). For co-purification, the two proteins required co-translation; mixing after separate translation did not yield the oligomeric complex (data not show). These results demonstrated that the 9–2 protein could bind to itself, and the P7Q mutation did not affect this interaction. The oligomerization property of the mutant protein was investigated by another method in the experiment shown in Fig. 9. Velocity gradient sedimentation was used to measure the apparent size of the 2–5(A) synthetase proteins synthesized in vitro. Appropriately sized markers were provided by centrifugation of standard proteins of known molecular weights. The WT and P7Q proteins produced similar profiles (Fig. 9). The majority of the in vitrotranslated proteins was present as a monomer, but a substantial portion of both proteins formed a tetrameric complex. The mutant protein was as efficient as the WT protein in formation of the tetramer. The results shown in Figs. 8 and 9 clearly demonstrated that the P7Q protein was capable of participation in both homomeric and heteromeric interactions. Continuing our investigation of the structure-function relationship of the mouse 9–2 isozyme of 2–5(A) synthetase, we created deletion mutants missing the first 9 or the first 22 residues from the amino terminus. These proteins were expressed using the translation initiation vectors that we designed previously for doing a similar analysis of PKR (5Patel R.C. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7671-7676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neither of the amino-terminal deletion mutants of the 9–2 protein had enzyme activity, although they were translated as efficiently as the wild type protein (data not shown). Another protein carrying two additional residues at the amino terminus of the full-length 9–2 protein was highly active. These results suggested that some alterations, but not others, near the amino terminus of the protein are tolerated. That the addition of extra residues to this end of the protein does not change its conformation to an inactive form was also demonstrated by the production of active hexahistidine-tagged 9–2 protein. We, therefore, concluded that specific residues present near the amino terminus are essential for the activity of this enzyme. Sequence comparison revealed that the first nine residues are completely conserved among the murine 9–2 and 3–9 isozymes and the human E-16 and E-18 isozymes (Table I). Remarkably, when the sequence of the other murine small synthetase L-3 was compared, we noted the presence of a motif of LXXXPA in all isozymes. The leucine residue is at position 3 of the 9–2 protein, but it is at position 5 of the L-3 protein. Yet the spacing of the invariant residues is the same, and no other residue in this region is conserved between the two proteins. The 69K medium synthetase consists of two halves, which have strong sequence homology. We searched for the LXXXPA motif near the amino termini of the two halves and found that the leucine and the proline residues are conserved there as well. The alanine residue after proline is also conserved in the amino half, but it is conservatively replaced by a glycine residue in the carboxyl half. The spacing of the conserved residues was again identical. The above observations strongly suggested that conservation of the LXXXPA motif has a functional significance. Site-directed mutagenesis of the invariant residues at positions 3, 7, and 8 clearly established that these residues are important for the enzymatic activity of the 9–2 protein. Replacement of the hydrophobic leucine residue at position 3 with histidine, a polar residue, reduced the activity by about 70%, whereas replacement of alanine at position 8 with a charged aspartic acid residue reduced the activity by more than 80%. Thus, these substitutions created partially active mutants. The specific defect in the enzymatic properties of these partially active mutants remains to be delineated. Similarly, more mutational studies will be required to determine which substitutions are tolerable at positions 3 and 8. Replacement of proline at position 7 with glutamine destroyed the activity of the protein completely. Proline residues are known to create discrete structural changes in protein conformations. Hence, it is quite likely that the substitution of proline at position 7 resulted in a crucial conformational change of the protein, resulting in a loss of activity. This putative conformational change was affected differently by different substitutions at this position. However, the degree of effect of a given substitution could not be easily correlated with any property of the replacing amino acid. In addition to the totally inactive point mutation P7Q described here two other inactive point mutants, K199R and K199H, have been described recently (22Kon N. Suhadolnik R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19983-19990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The latter mutations apparently affect the enzyme's active center and its ATP binding. In contrast, the P7Q mutant could bind ATP as well as the wild type protein. Similarly, the dsRNA binding property and the oligomerization property of the protein were also unaffected by this mutation. For testing the oligomerization properties of the protein, we developed two new assays. The glycerol gradient centrifugation assay has the advantage of providing the molecular weight of the native protein and hence the estimate of its number of subunits. It is, however, a time-consuming assay, and it cannot distinguish between a heteromeric and a homomeric interaction. To circumvent these problems, we developed the FLAG-antibody interaction assay and established its validity. The observation that co-translation was required for the formation of heteromeric complexes suggests that the complexes are quite stable, and they do not exchange subunits at an appreciable rate under our experimental conditions. Such information will be valuable in the future for expressing enzymatically inactive mutants in whole cells as potential trans-dominant inhibitors of the endogenous wild type enzyme.

Both types of analysis indicate that 5 S rRNA processing is not dependent on the nucleotide sequence of either the external transcribed spacer or the mature 5 S rRNA. The results further indicate the RNA is processed by an exonuclease activity which is limited primarily or entirely by helix I, the secondary structure formed between the mature and interacting termini. The 5 S RNA binding protein (YL3) also appears not to influence directly the maturation process, but rather to play a role in protecting the rRNA from further degradation by “housekeeping” nucleases. Taken together, the results continue to support a “quality control” function which helps to ensure that during maturation only normal precursors are processed and assembled into active ribosomes.

Taken together, the results continue to support a “quality control” function which helps to ensure that during maturation only normal precursors are processed and assembled into active ribosomes. In bacteria, the ribosomal 5 S RNA component is encoded in a single long transcript which is cleaved and matured as three individual RNA components (the 16, 23, and 5 S rRNAs) that constitute the RNA portion of active ribosomes. In eukaryotes, the 5 S RNA of cytoplasmic ribosomes is encoded by a separate gene and transcribed by an alternate RNA polymerase III (see Ref. 1Nazar R.N. Cell Nucleus. 1982; 10: 1-29Google Scholar). Despite this uncoupled synthesis and the small size of the 5 S RNA molecule (∼120 nucleotides), all known eukaryotic 5 S RNAs still are transcribed as slightly longer precursors with the 3′-sequence extensions removed as the RNA is processed.

Cell. 1982; 29: 149-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) have documented this maturation process or provided some detail of the underlying mechanism. Some differences in precursor size and enzymatic requirements have been observed between higher and lower eukaryotes; in Drosophila and yeast the 7–15 extra nucleotides appeared to be removed by a single rapid endonucleolytic step (6Tekamp P.A. Garcea R.L. Rutter W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9501-9506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Piper P.W. Bellatin J.A. Lockheart A.

More recent detailed studies in vitro have begun to define the structural features in 5 S RNA transcripts ofDrosophila melanogaster which are essential for RNA processing (see Ref. 11Vasisht V. Greene V. Arjun I. Levinger L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18468-18474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies initially concluded (10Preiser P.R. Levinger L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7509-7516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that a base paired C at position 118 followed by a stretch of pyrimidines was the processing signal which is recognized by the processing enzyme and/or a required accessory factor. Subsequent studies have shown that a number of more distal structural features in the mature 5 S RNA also appear to affect the maturation process (11Vasisht V. Greene V. Arjun I. Levinger L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18468-18474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Levinger L.F. Vasisht V. Greene V. Arjun I. J. Biol.

Vasisht V. Birk A. Levinger L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11553-11557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).A potential role for the extended sequence in the 5 S RNA precursor and its subsequent processing was suggested when studies on rRNA termination indicated that accurate termination of the 5 S rRNA gene transcripts was critical to transcript stability and subsequent integration into ribosomal structure (15Lee Y. Melekhovets Y.F. Nazar R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28003-28005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Deletions or substantial displacements of the termination signals resulted in highly unstable transcripts which were not incorporated into stable ribosomes. Such results suggested that transcript termination coupled with rapid processing was essential and served as a quality control mechanism to help eliminate altered RNA molecules.To further elucidate the structural features which underlie eukaryotic 5 S rRNA maturation and perhaps its role as a quality control mechanism, we have examined 5 S rRNA maturation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using targeted mutagenesis to evaluate the effect of specific changes, both in vivo and in vitro. Our results indicate that, while both the structure of the 5 S RNA and the presence of the cognate ribosomal 5 S RNA binding protein, YL3 (16Nazar R.N. Yaguchi M. Willick G.E. Rollin C.F. Roy C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 102: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), are essential for the efficient integration of the 5 S rRNA into the ribosomal structure, the actual processing of the 5 S RNA is largely or entirely dependent only on stem I, the helix formed between the interacting of the mature RNA molecule.RESULTSThe mutagenic strategies used in these studies were based on PCR amplification (19Good L. Nazar R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4934Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and mutant genes were expressed in vivousing a high copy, autonomously replicating yeast shuttle vector (20Percival-Smith A. Segall J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2484-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 1 (A99), under normal conditions, 80–90% of the cellular 5 S RNA was mutant, easily detected using a well characterized and neutral (18Van Ryk D.I. Lee Y. Nazar R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8377-8381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lee Y. Erkine A.M. Van Ryk D.I. Nazar R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 634-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) single base substitution, Y5A99. In the course of this study, additional mutations were introduced in three regions of the 5 S RNA gene: the nontranscribed spacer downstream of the termination site, the 3′ nonconserved spacer, which is transcribed but removed during RNA processing, and the actual 5 S RNA sequence. The mutations examined in Fig. 1 illustrate features in the 3′-nonconserved spacer that are essential for chain termination, but which do not affect RNA maturation. As originally suggested by the gene sequence (31Maxam A.M. Tizard R. Skryabin K.G. Gilbert W. Nature. 1977; 267: 643-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and subsequently confirmed by transcription in vitro (6Tekamp P.A. Garcea R.L. Rutter W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9501-9506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or brief labeling in vivo (7Piper P.W. Bellatin J.A. Lockheart A. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the extended cluster of adenylate residues in the coding sequence, beginning with A + 8 and encoding a poly(U) tract in the 3′ end of the precursor, signals termination. This systematic analysis (Fig. 1) shows that five adenylic acid residues (lane c) are essential for efficient termination in vivo, but some termination still occurs when only four residues are present (lane g). Furthermore, it is also clear that the position of the adenylate cluster is not critical, and a shorter extension encoded only by adenylic acid residues still results in efficiently terminated and matured 5 S RNA (lane d). Only traces of mutant RNA were evident with three or fewer adenylic acid residues (lanes a and b).Figure 1Effect of 3′ external transcribed sequences on the expression of 5 S rRNA in S. cerevisiae. The 5 S rRNA genes containing altered 3′ ETS regions (a–g) were prepared by PCR amplification and subcloned in a high copy yeast shuttle vector (pYF404), and the recombinants were used to transform LEU2-deficient S. cerevisiae cells (18Van Ryk D.I. Lee Y. Nazar R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8377-8381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whole cell RNA was prepared from exponentially growing transformants (lanes a–g) and fractionated by gel electrophoresis. RNA from untransformed cells (lane Y5) and cells transformed with pYF5A99 (lane A99) are included; the positions of the host cell and plasmid-derived RNAs are indicated byarrowheads.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because previous in vitro analyses have indicated that the extended sequence itself plays a role in RNA maturation (10Preiser P.R. Levinger L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7509-7516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), base substitutions also were introduced into the extension preceding the termination signal. As again indicated by the examples shown in Fig. 1, when expressed in vivo these changes also had no effect on RNA production. For example, when a guanylic acid residue was substituted at +2 (lane e) or even when the spacer was very different in composition (CCCCCCCC versus UUAUUUC inlane f), the mutant 5 S RNA was efficiently produced with most of the cellular RNA containing the A99 substitution. Clearly inS. cerevisiae, the exact position of the termination signal or the composition of the spacer is not critical for normal 5 S rRNA production in vivo.Since external changes did not affect 5 S RNA maturation, and internal sequence changes have been observed to affect the maturation ofDrosophila 5 S RNA in vitro (see Ref. 11Vasisht V. Greene V. Arjun I. Levinger L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18468-18474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a survey also was made of the effect of changes in the 5 S rRNA sequence, itself. A variety of effects were observed, as illustrated in the examples for stem 1 changes shown in Fig. 2, as well as the larger number of more internal changes previously surveyed in studies on the internal promoter and 5 S rRNA function (see TableI). As shown in Fig. 2, changes in the 3′ end of the 5 S RNA, which are predicted to affect the secondary structure of the 5 S RNA, were observed to significantly affect the amount of mutant 5 S RNA in the transformed cells. A simple substitution in the unpaired 3′ end had no effect (lane a), but other changes (lanes b to f), which disrupted the helix formed between the two termini (stem 1) to various degrees, resulted in small or large reductions depending on the actual structural change. For example, the reduction with A112 (e), a change at the edge of the helix, was minimal. In contrast, almost no mutant RNA was observed with G116 (c), which introduced a bulge in the center of the helix.Figure 2Effect of 5 S RNA gene mutations on the expression of 5 S rRNA in S. cerevisiae. The 5 S rRNA genes containing mutations in stem I (a–f) or other regions (g and h) were prepared by PCR amplification and subcloned in a high copy yeast shuttle vector (pYF404), and the recombinants were used to transform LEU2-deficient S. cerevisiae cells (18Van Ryk D.I.

Open table in a new tab As summarized in Table I, such a range of changes also was observed with the internal substitutions. For example, as also shown in Fig. 2, the A33 substitution results in virtually no change (lane h), but the C101–103 substitution results in no mutant RNA (lane g). Because these reductions in in vivolevels of mutant 5 S RNA could result from reduced transcription, improper rRNA processing, or even simple instability in the mature rRNA molecules, in earlier studies (23Lee Y. Erkine A.M. Van Ryk D.I. Nazar R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 634-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and as noted in Table I, the initial presence of mature rRNA and the instability were confirmed by brief labeling and half-life determinations. In most cases the reduced levels of mutant RNA were related to RNA instability and a brief labeling revealed much higher initial levels. In five examples (Y5U56U57, Y5C61, Y5C64, Y5A70, and Y5A86); however, the reduced levels corresponded closely with changes in the eukaryotic 5 S rRNA gene internal promoter sequence (23Lee Y. Erkine A.M. Van Ryk D.I. Nazar R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 634-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Taken together these data indicate that, in S. cerevisiae, none of the internal sequences or structures that were examined was critical to RNA maturation but changes to them could substantially affect the stability of the mature RNA or its initial transcription.In the present study, a correct maturation in these examples was established further in vitro, using a nuclear cell free extract prepared from S. cerevisiae. As illustrated in Fig.3 a, the extract was effective with both normal and efficiently expressed mutant 5 S rRNA precursors, resulting in stable and fully processed mature 5 S rRNA. As also illustrated by the examples shown in Fig. 3, b–e, this was equally true for precursors with mutations in the 3′ end-spacer sequence. Nucleotide substitutions in the spacer (b and c), a shorter spacer (d), or a longer spacer (e), all resulted in a normal 5 S rRNA molecule. The only exceptions were precursors which contained altered secondary structure in the spacer region. As illustrated in Fig. 3 f, in this case a new mature terminal was evident at the beginning of the altered secondary structure and the resulting molecule was highly unstable. Unlike the other examples, the amount of labeled precursor plus full-length 5 S RNA dropped rapidly and internally cleaved fragments were evident.Similar results also were obtained when the 5 S rRNA sequence mutations were examined. As illustrated by the examples shown in Fig. 4, in all cases the mature 5 S rRNA was evident but, depending on the specific mutation, the stability of the product varied greatly. For example, a change which partially disrupted the terminal helix (e) always resulted in a slightly shorter and very unstable product, but a change which only slightly altered the helix (f) resulted in a more stable product. Similarly, more internal changes (b–d) resulted in correctly processed 5 S rRNA for which the stability, in vitro, generally reflected that which was observed in vivo.Figure 4Effect of 5 S rRNA mutations on the processing of 5 S RNA precursors in vitro. The 5 S rRNA precursors containing normal (a) or altered internal sequences; Y5U56–57 (b), Y5G69 (c), Y5C101–103 (d), Y5G116 (e), or Y5C118 (f) were prepared in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase transcription. The RNA was labeled at the 5′ end and incubated for 0, 30, or 90 min with nuclear extract, SDS/phenol extracted and fractionated by gel electrophoresis. The positions of the precursor and mature 5 S rRNA are indicated by arrowheads.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Taken together, the present results, both in vivo andin vitro, strongly suggest that an exonuclease activity simply trims the precursor, at least in most instances. This conclusion is supported by the absence of dependence on sequence specificity in any of the experiments which are described, as well as the critical nature of altered secondary structure (stem I). The helix formed between the termini appears to be the key controlling element in the maturation process, an observation which suggests that the structure itself, at least in part, limits the action of the exonuclease. To examine this possibility further, additional changes were introduced to either the precursor or the assay conditions. In the first instance, the 3′ end was phosphorylated by the addition of pCp using RNA ligase (28Peattie D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1760-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar) to inhibit exonuclease cleavage. As shown in Fig. 5(middle), this action fully inhibited normal processing,in vitro. The precursor molecules did disappear slowly because of nonspecific internal cleavage into much shorter fragments which migrated from the gel. In the second experiment (right), a large amount of unlabeled 5 S rRNA precursor was added to the assay mixture. This resulted in a much slower processing reaction in which the intermediated steps were much more evident. Finally, in a third experiment, oligonucleotides, complementary to either the 5′ or 3′ end of the mature 5 S rRNA were hybridized with precursor, prior toin vitro assay. As shown in Fig. 6, the oligonucleotide which was complementary to the 3′ end (left) did not disrupt the maturation process, but with 5′ end specific oligonucleotide, processing was very abnormal with shortened degradation products clearly evident (right).Figure 5Inhibition of 5 S rRNA precursor processingin vitro. The 5 S rRNA precursor was prepared and labeled as described in Fig. 3 before being incubated for 0, 30, or 90 min with nuclear extract, SDS/phenol extracted and fractionated by gel electrophoresis (left). A second aliquot (middle) was extended at the 3′ end with pCp using RNA ligase before incubation with nuclear extract, and a third aliquot (right) was incubated with nuclear extract together with unlabeled precursor RNA.

A. 1979; 76: 145-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Our previous studies of the yeast 5 S RNA-protein complex have indicated that three helical regions are important for this interaction, the primary site being the helix formed by the termini (32Nazar R.N. Wildeman A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 3155-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 37McDougall J. Nazar R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5256-5259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since 5 S RNP is likely to be present in any nuclear extract and since 5 S RNA can readily exchange into such a complex (29Nazar R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7724-7729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Nazar R.N. Wildeman A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 3155-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the effect of the the 5 S RNA ribosomal binding protein also was examined with respect to RNA processing. In the experiments shown in Fig. 7, the processing of 5 S rRNA precursor was compared in the presence of a large pool of 5 S rRNA binding protein (right) or of mature 5 S rRNA (middle). In all cases the results were entirely comparable with an efficient and complete processing of the 5 S rRNA precursor. The presence of excess 5 S rRNA, which would be expected to remove 5 S rRNA binding protein from the extract did not prevent RNA maturation and the presence of excess protein also had no effect.Figure 7Effect of 5 S rRNA or the 5 S RNA-protein complex on the processing of 5 S rRNA precursors in vitro. The 5 S rRNA precursor was prepared and labeled as described in Fig. 3, and aliquots were incubated for 0, 120, or 240 min with nuclear extract (left) and an excess of unlabeled 5 S rRNA (middle), or an equivalent amount of purified 5 S RNA-protein complex (right) before being SDS/phenol-extracted and fractionated by gel electrophoresis. The positions of the original precursor and the normal mature 5 S rRNA are indicated by arrowheads.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)While RNA processing remained a constant in most experiments, as already noted, large differences in product stability were observed. Because the 5 S binding protein would be expected to affect the susceptibility of 5 S RNA to random nuclease digestion, the affinity of the mutant RNAs for this ribosomal protein also was examined. As previously shown for mature labeled 5 S RNA, labeled 5 S rRNA precursor also can readily exchange into purified 5 S ribonucleoprotein complex (Fig. 8 (RNP)). More important, as illustrated in Fig. 8, many of the precursors for unstable 5 S RNA mutants were observed to exchange less effectively. For example, a mutation in the spacer sequence (G122), which results in normal levels of 5 S rRNA in vivo, was observed to efficiently interact with protein to form RNP (lane f), but changes in the terminal helix resulted in interactions which were compromised to various degrees (lanes a–e). This reduced interaction often correlated with the stability of RNA, both in vivo andin vitro suggesting that, while this interaction was not critical to rRNA processing, it was important in the stabilization of processed RNA and perhaps its integration into ribosome structure (33Steitz J.A.

The analyses reveal a simple trimming process by an exonuclease activity which is limited by the secondary structure of the 5 S rRNA molecule. At the same time, the interaction of the 5 S RNA molecule with its cognate ribosomal binding protein appears to stabilize the secondary structure, and limits further degradation of the 5 S RNA by other nuclease activities. The efficient termination of the nascent chainin vivo requires the presence of at least five adenylic acid residues in the coding DNA strand. Other features in nascent 3′-external transcribed spacer are not significant to the maturation process, the requirement only being a free 3′ hydroxyl end to initiate the exonuclease cleavage. Changes in the position of the termination signal or marked changes in the composition of the extended sequence had no significant effect. The formation of artificial secondary structure by targeted changes (Fig. 3) did interfere with processing and mature RNA production by prematurely limiting the progress of the exonucleolytic cleavage.The importance of the YL3 p"

A membrane-associated protein, it is found mainly in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) co-localized with the TGN 38 marker protein (9Molloy S.S. Thomas L. VanSlyke J.K. Stenberg P.E. Thomas G.

So far furin has not been detected in bodily fluids like blood, nor has the effect of its expression on cell and organ development been studied in transgenic animals. Transgenic animals secreting recombinant proteins into milk, blood, urine, or saliva (11Lubon H. Paleyanda R.K. Velander W.H. Drohan W.N. Transfus. Med. Rev. 1995; X: 131-143Google Scholar) have been generated and differences in recombinant protein modification compared with the human counterpart observed (12Drohan W. Zhang D-W. Paleyanda R. Chang R. Wroble M. Velander W. Lubon H Transgenic Res. 1994; 3: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In a pioneering attempt to engineer the post-translational capacity of the mouse mammary gland, we reported enhanced proteolytic maturation of the recombinant human Protein C (rHPC) precursor upon coexpression with furin (13Drews R.

However, the effect of increased furin concentration on mammary gland development could not be predicted, nor its' intra- and extracellular distribution. Here we demonstrate localization of two heterologous proteins with the endogenous whey acidic protein (WAP) in the mouse mammary gland and secretion of active truncated furin into milk. The WAP/PACE construct comprising the 2.47-kb human furin cDNA and 74-base pair 3′-untranslated sequences, the four lines of CD-1 mice transgenic for WAP/HPC (12Drohan W. Zhang D-W. Paleyanda R.

RNA was isolated from tissues of primiparous, F3 generation transgenic and control females on day 10 of lactation using RNAzol (Molecular Research Center). 15 μg of total RNA was fractionated on formaldehyde, 1.2% agarose gels along with RNA markers (Life Technologies) and transferred to GeneScreen Plus membranes (DuPont NEN). A radiolabeled 2.5-kb human PACE cDNA was used to detect mouse furin as they share 94% amino acid homology (14Hatsuzawa K. Hosaka M. Nakagawa T. Nagase M. Shoda A. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol.

Data were corrected for sample loading by ethidium bromide staining and 18 S rRNA detection. Paraffin-embedded sections of mammary gland from mid-lactation bigenic mice were stained with hematoxylin/eosin or immunostained. Endogenous peroxidase activity was exhausted by immersion in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min. Sections were preincubated in 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 10% rabbit, horse, or goat serum for the detection of rHPC, furin, or mWAP, respectively. Sections were reacted with a 1:400 dilution of sheep anti-HPC antibody (Affinity Biologicals), a 1:5 dilution of MON 148 antibody (gift of Dr. Van de Ven; Ref. 15van Duijnhoven H.L.P. Creemers J.W.M.

Staining with secondary antibodies alone was negligible. Tissues of at least two animals from all four lines were analyzed. Continuously bred mice of the F3 and F4 generations were milked between days 7 and 15 of lactation after intraperitoneal administration of 0.5 IU oxytocin (Sigma). Milk was diluted with 2 volumes of PBS, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm EDTA, centrifuged twice at 15,800 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C, and stored at −80 °C. 20 μg of milk proteins were separated under reducing conditions on 8–16% (Novex) or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and silver stained, or Western blotted with 1:20 to 1:100 dilutions of the MON 139, 148, 150, or 152 anti-furin monoclonal antibodies (15van Duijnhoven H.L.P.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG at 0.5 μg/ml was added and blots developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham). rHPC was detected using the heavy chain-specific 8861 monoclonal antibody, or a sheep polyclonal antibody.

Briefly, 100 μl of whole milk containing sucrose at 5% (w/v) was underlaid beneath 1 ml of PBS and spun at 1,500 × g, for 30 min at 22 °C. A lower “skim milk” fraction was collected, while the upper fat fraction was diluted in 1 ml of PBS and respun. A lower “cream wash” fraction was collected, while fat globules were dispersed in 1.3 ml of 0.05 m Tris, pH 7.5, with 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) SDS, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate. Globules were chilled to 4 °C and spun at 50,000 × g, for 60 min. The milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) “supernatant” was collected and the “MFGM pellet” resuspended in buffer. Fractions were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE. Fluorometric assays were carried out essentially as described (18Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol.

Defatted milk diluted 1:100 to 1:400 was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with an equal volume of 100 μm peptide substrate Boc-RVRR-AMC (N-α-t-butoxycarbonyl-l-arginyl-l-valyl-l-arginyl-l-arginine-7-AMC; Bachem) in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.5% Triton X-100, in a 200-μl volume. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 15 mm EDTA. 7-Amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) liberated by cleavage was measured with a Perkin-Elmer LS-3 spectrofluorometer, 380 nm excitation, 460 nm emission. The blank sample consisted of substrate alone, while control milk values were negligible. For kinetic analysis, duplicate milk samples diluted 1:200 were incubated for 5 min with Boc-RVRR-AMC at concentrations ranging from 12.5 to 200 μm. Protease activity was assessed by incubating whole mouse milk from the HPC line 6.4 (12Drohan W. Zhang D-W. Paleyanda R. Chang R. Wroble M. Velander W. Lubon H Transgenic Res. 1994; 3: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in a 10:1 ratio with milk from HPC/PACE line C5.2, for 0–30 min at 37 °C. Milk was then diluted and processed with PBS, pH 7.4, with 50 mm EDTA to inhibit further furin activity. Whole milk, from the HPC line 6.4, 0.9 ml, was incubated with 0.1 ml of milk from line C5.2 HPC/PACE mice for 3 h, at 37 °C. Milk was diluted with 20 ml of 50 mm Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm benzamidine, pH 7.2, and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The defatted milk was re-centrifuged, filtered, and rHPC purified as described (13Drews R. Paleyanda R.K. Lee T.K. Chang R.R. Drohan W.N. Lubon H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Northern blot hybridization with the human probe under conditions of low stringency revealed a 4.2-kb furin transcript in control and transgenic mouse mammary glands, Fig. 1, corresponding to reports of a 4.5-kb RNA in mouse kidney (7Schalken J.A. Roebroek A.J.M. Oomen P.P.C.A. Wagenaar S.Sc. Debruyne F.M.J. Bloemers H.P.J. Van de Ven W.J.M. J. Clin.

Chem. 1990; 265: 22075-22078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The signal obtained in the mammary gland was 5–10-fold lower than that in the liver, salivary gland, and brain (data not shown). The expected 2.5-kb human furin transcript was detected in bigenic mice at levels about 100-fold higher than endogenous furin. Histologic analyses of the mammary glands of HPC/PACE bigenic mice did not reveal differences in their gross morphology compared with control mice, Fig. 2. Transgenic tissues differed subtly, having less distended alveoli with larger epithelial cells, as in HPC transgenic mice (19Paleyanda R.K. Zhang D-W. Hennighausen L. McKnight R. Drohan W.N. Lubon H. Transgenic Res. 1994; 3: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The distribution of recombinant proteins and endogenous WAP was compared by immunostaining of serial sections. rHPC was found in the secretory epithelium, and alveolar and ductal lumina. Unlike the relatively diffuse intracellular staining pattern of WAP and rHPC, furin showed a more discrete staining pattern. Unexpectedly, furin was also detected in the lumen, indicating secretion from the apical surface of epithelial cells. WAP, rHPC, and furin were detected in all the alveoli and ducts, although some alveoli stained more intensely than others. Furin and rHPC synthesis appeared to be regulated like WAP, being present inside the epithelial cells lining collapsed milked-out alveoli, although predominantly in the lumina of milk-distended alveoli. Control mouse tissue was stained neither by furin- nor rHPC-specific antibodies. The furin-specific MON 148 antibody (15van Duijnhoven H.L.P. Creemers J.W.M. Kranenborg M.G.C. Timmer E.D.J.

Hybridoma. 1992; 11: 71-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) detected a protein of approximately 80 kDa in bigenic mouse milk, which was absent in control milk (Fig.3 A). Higher levels were detected in lines C1.2, C2.2, and C5.2, than in C4.1. Trace polypeptides of approximately 150 kDa were also detected. A 141-kDa membrane-associated form of furin was recently reported in neural lobe secretory vesicles (20Hill R.M. Ledgerwood E.C. Brennan S.O. Pu L.-P. Loh Y.P. Christie D.L. Birch N.P. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2318-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). MON 152 which is specific for human furin also detected the 80-kDa protein (Fig. 3 B). The enzyme was not recognized by MON 150 and MON 139, indicating removal of the propeptide and C-terminal region, respectively (Fig. 4). These results are consistent with truncation at the hydrophobic transmembrane domain, resulting in secretion of an 80-kDa form. The minor protein species of approximately 65 kDa probably arises from additional cleavage(s) in the cysteine-rich region (21Munzer J.S. Jean F. Basak A. Lazure C. Thomas G. Seidah N. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1995; 19B: B7-108Google Scholar, 22Bravo D.A. Gleason J.B. Sanchez R.I. Roth R.A. Fuller R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25830-25837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Selective inclusion of furin in the MFGM was not observed upon fractionation of milk (Fig. 3 C), while traces of a 90-kDa protein detected upon prolonged exposure may represent full-length furin from sloughed-off epithelial cells. A rough estimate of 81–325 μg/ml furin in the milk was obtained by comparison with Coomassie Blue-stained gels and Western blots of soluble furin secreted by CV-1 cells (data not shown).Figure 4Processing of rHPC and furin in the mammary gland. The WAP/HPC and WAP/PACE transgenes were coexpressed in the mouse mammary gland. Pro-furin composed of the propeptide (P), serine protease (SP), middle (M), Cys-rich (CYS), transmembrane (TM), and cytoplasmic (C) domains is activated by propeptide cleavage. Furin is localized to the TGN or undergoes C-terminal truncation and is secreted into the milk. Furin processes pro-Protein C inside cells to the mature form by removing the propeptide and the internal dipeptide. Processing may also continue in milk. The arrows denote known proprotein cleavage sites, while the dotted arrowsindicate probable cleavage sites.

Paleyanda R. Chang R. Wroble M. Velander W. Lubon H Transgenic Res. 1994; 3: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Incubating the milk of bigenic and HPC mice together resulted in a reduction of the amount of rHPC single chain (Fig. 5 A and Fig. 4). Incubation of milk from HPC mice alone did not alter the electrophoretic pattern of rHPC, but trace amounts of single chain present in HPC/PACE milk disappeared. rHPC purified from a mixture of HPC/PACE and HPC milk after incubation showed a marked reduction in the amount of precursor (Fig. 5 B). Amino acid sequencing confirmed site-specific cleavage of the propeptide. Normal cells express furin at low levels and the enzyme is ubiquitously distributed (7Schalken J.A. Roebroek A.J.M. Oomen P.P.C.A. Wagenaar S.Sc. Debruyne F.M.J. Bloemers H.P.J. Van de Ven W.J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 80: 1545-1549Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Expression of furin in genetically engineered cells or animals at a great excess beyond the basal level deviates from the physiological norm and may be toxic. Toxicity of furin has been reported in transfected cells (24Ayoubi T.A.Y. Creemers J.W.M. Roebroek A.J.M. Van de Ven W.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9298-9303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), probably due to broadened specificity. The furin gene was also up-regulated 5–10-fold in primary human non-small cell lung carcinomas (7Schalken J.A. Roebroek A.J.M. Oomen P.P.C.A. Wagenaar S.Sc. Debruyne F.M.J. Bloemers H.P.J.

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25830-25837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are also processed by furin. Stromelysin-3, a metalloprotease involved in mammary tissue remodeling, was activated by furin in cells and in solution (29Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Thus, undesirable effects following the expression of an additional protease could not be excluded. We show here that although transgene transcripts were highly expressed, mammary gland gross morphology was similar in normal and transgenic animals. Mammary development was not impaired, nor were tumors observed in mice from any line for up to 2 years of age and over several generations, implying that increased furin expression in mammary epithelial cells was not associated with transformation. Our results also do not implicate secreted furin in tissue remodeling. Two mechanisms could possibly explain our data. First, large amounts of the specific substrate, rHPC, may limit access of furin to other proteins. The presence of furin and rHPC in the same region of the mammary gland and in the same alveoli would support this argument. Our unique observation of the co-localization of two foreign proteins suggests the coordinated regulation of expression and protein synthesis of two cointegrated transgenes in the mammary gland. The two transgenes under control of the 4.1-kb WAP promoter also mimicked the pattern of synthesis of endogenous WAP, supporting reports of the simultaneous synthesis of endogenous milk proteins and a heterologous protein under the control of the β-lactoglobulin promoter (30Faerman A. Barash I. Puzis R. Nathan M. Hurwitz D.R. Shani M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although several multigenic animal models have been generated, the site(s) of synthesis and cellular distribution of foreign proteins were not established (31McKnight R.A. Wall R.J. Hennighausen L. Transgenic Res. 1995; 4: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar,32Prunkard D. Cottingham I. Garner I. Bruce S. Dalrymple M. Lasser G. Bishop P. Foster D. Nat. Biotech. 1996; 14: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The amount of fully assembled human fibrinogen hexamer secreted into milk of β-lactoglobulin/fibrinogen transgenic mice was reported to range from 10 to 100% (32Prunkard D. Cottingham I. Garner I. Bruce S. Dalrymple M. Lasser G. Bishop P. Foster D. Nat. Biotech. 1996; 14: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As coordinate synthesis of the α-, β-, γ-subunit chains is required for the correct assembly of human fibrinogen, partial assembly may imply a heterogeneous pattern of synthesis in some lines. The second mechanism assumes secretion of excess furin from epithelial cells (Fig. 4). Secretion from transfected cells (23Vidricaire G. Denault J-B. Leduc R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1011-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 33Wise R.J. Barr P.J. Wong P.A. Kiefer M.C. Brake A.J. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2424-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) has been suggested as a mechanism to regulate the amount of intracellular enzyme (35Vey M. Schäfer W. Berghöfer S. Klenk H-D. Garten W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1829-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and we also detected furin in milk. So far furin had not been detected in any bodily fluid in normal or pathological states, probably due to the low sensitivity of existing methods. This should be considered when generating animals expressing furin in the liver, as the secreted protein could be directed to the circulation. We had expected furin to be shed from the apical plasma membrane of mammary cells in fat globules, but did not detect full-length protein in the MFGM fraction. Unlike the cystic fibrosis transductance regulator protein found predominantly in the milk fat of transgenic mice (19Paleyanda R.K. Zhang D-W. Hennighausen L. McKnight R. Drohan W.N. Lubon H. Transgenic Res. 1994; 3: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), this was not the main route of furin secretion. Finding truncated furin in all fractions of milk suggested secretion along with the milk proteins. Propeptide removal probably occurred in the endoplasmic reticulum, followed by targeting to the TGN in the presence of the cytoplasmic tail (9Molloy S.S. Thomas L. VanSlyke J.K. Stenberg P.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 18-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 33Wise R.J. Barr P.J. Wong P.A. Kiefer M.C. Brake A.J. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9378-9382Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the acidic signal crucial for TGN retention then resulted in secretion (28Liu B. Amizuka N. Goltzman D. Rabbani S.A. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 63: 276-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 29Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), implying that C-terminal processing of furin occurs in normal, untransformed mammalian cells. The activity of secreted furin provided further evidence of propeptide processing, as propeptide removal was necessary for enzyme activation (9Molloy S.S. Thomas L. VanSlyke J.K. Stenberg P.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 18-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) and the presence of propeptide on a furin mutant led to loss of activity (36Rehemtulla A. Dorner A.J. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8235-8239Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In milk up to 40,000 units/ml active furin which functioned as a protease in the maturation of the rHPC precursor was detected, unlike the PACE-Sol mutant which was unable to process vWF in the medium of COS-1 cells (37Rehemtulla A. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2349-2355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore conclude that both the intracellular and truncated extracellular forms are active and process the rHPC precursor in epithelial cells as well as in milk (Fig. 4). Similarly, Prieto et al. (1995) described the presence of active human α1,2-fucosyltransferase in the milk of mice (38Prieto P.A. Mukerji P. Kelder B. Erney R. Gonzalez D. Yun J.S. Smith D, F. Moremen K.W. Nardelli C.

Thus, it is possible to produce significant amounts of secreted forms of intracellular enzymes in milk. Our results should encourage others to augment the processing of endogenous and heterologous proteins in transgenic animals. It will not be necessary to process incompletely modified recombinant proteinsin vitro, instead this can be done simultaneously in vivo. The intra- and extracellular presence of furin allows for multiple interactions with its substrate, thus removing temporal and spatial constraints on proprotein processing and highlighting further advantages of protein production in transgenic animal bioreactors.

https://openalex.org/W2074010026,"DNA replication in eucaryotic cells is a complex process involving a variety of proteins that synthesize the leading and lagging strand in an asymmetric, coordinated manner. To investigate the effect of this asymmetry on the translesion synthesis of bulky lesions, we have constructed SV40 origin-containing plasmids with site-specificN-2-acetylaminofluorene adduct on either leading or lagging strand templates. These plasmids have been incubated with DNA replication-competent extracts made from human HeLa cells. Two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis analyses reveal a strong blockage of fork progression only when theN-2-acetylaminofluorene adduct is located on the leading strand template. Morever, the analysis revealed that replication with HeLa cell extracts of SV40 origin-dependent plasmids functions in both directions from the origin with equal efficiency but, probably due to an important asynchrony at the formation of the two forks, proceeds unidirectionally for a large number of individual molecules. The validity of the in vitro replication approach to study the fidelity of both leading- and lagging strand synthesis is discussed with regard to these new data.

The validity of the in vitro replication approach to study the fidelity of both leading- and lagging strand synthesis is discussed with regard to these new data. DNA lesions are usually repaired in an error-free manner, which eliminates most of the consequences of a DNA-damaging treatment. However, some DNA lesions may escape repair and can cause inhibition of DNA replication and transcription, alteration of gene expression, mutagenesis, or cell death. Hence, some mutations can be tolerated, but cells must replicate their full DNA before dividing. Because DNA replication is a complex process that functions in an asymmetric manner to coordinate synthesis of both leading and lagging strands (1Kornberg A. Backer T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1991Google Scholar), DNA adducts may have different potentials for blocking replication and therefore inducing mutagenesis, depending on which strand the lesion is located on. For example, in mammalian cells deficient in excision repair, mutations are supposed to be due to unrepaired lesions found only on one strand of the hprt gene (2Vrieling H. van Rooijen M.L.

Biol. 1991; 11: 1927-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), leading to the hypothesis that translesion synthesis of the leading strand is less accurate than that of the other strand. However, in cultured cells, the determination of the leading or lagging strand of the hprtgene has not yet been done. Recent studies using in vitro SV40 origin-dependent replication with HeLa cell extracts have been made to determine the accuracy of leading or lagging strand synthesis (6Thomas D.C. Nguyen D.C. Piegorsch W.W. Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11476-11482Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 7Thomas D.C. Veaute X. Fuchs R.P.P. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol.

Translesion synthesis has been observed with a variety of types of DNA damage produced by chemical and physical agents, and mutation frequencies have been determined according to the position of the lesions. However, the conclusions that were drawn were based on at least two assumptions: first, that replication of SV40-based plasmids is bidirectional and synchronous from the SV40 origin under the conditions used for in vitro DNA replication; and second, that replication forks are similarly hindered by lesions on the leading or lagging strand template. We wished to re-examine the first point using a two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis technique, which allowed us to investigate the mode of replication of individual molecules (for a recent review, see Ref. 10Friedman K.L. Brewer B.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The second point has been addressed by studying the effect of the position of the adduct on replication fork progression. We have constructed plasmid molecules that contain a singleN-2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF) 1The abbreviations used are: AAF,N-2-acetylaminofluorene; bp, base pair(s); RI, replication intermediate; SV40 Tag, SV40 large tumor antigen.1The abbreviations used are: AAF,N-2-acetylaminofluorene; bp, base pair(s); RI, replication intermediate; SV40 Tag, SV40 large tumor antigen.in either the leading or lagging strand and used these DNAs as templates for replication in vitro in human HeLa cell extracts. AAF is a potent carcinogen that binds primarily at the C-8 position of guanine and has been shown to be a strong mutagen, leading essentially to 1- and 2-base deletions in Escherichia coli(11Fuchs R.P.P.

Minus two frameshift mutations have also been found after incubation of AAF-monomodified plasmid in HeLa cell extracts (7Thomas D.C. Veaute X. Fuchs R.P.P. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol.

In this study, we have used the same set of SV40 origin-dependent DNAs to analyze the inhibition of the replication fork by lesions on either the leading or the lagging strand template. The usefulness of the in vitro SV40-based replication assay to study the fidelity of the two DNA strand synthesis is discussed on the basis of our findings. HeLa cytoplasmic extracts were prepared by the method of Li and Kelly (14Li J.J. Kelly T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1238-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). SV40 large tumor antigen (SV40 Tag) was obtained from Molecular Biology Resources (Milwaukee, WI). Creatine phosphate, creatine phosphokinase, and proteinase K were from Boehringer Mannheim.

Plasmid pVil was constructed by introducing the 2517-bp SspI DNA fragment of pACYC184, which contains the tetracyclin resistance gene, into the unique SspI site of pMKBNar (Fig. 1).Figure 1Maps of plasmids PMKBNar, pMZBNar and pVil.

Kunkel T.A. Methods Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 295-313Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Reactions (50 μl) were performed in 30 mm HEPES (pH 8); 7 mm MgCl2; 4 mm ATP; 200 μm CTP, GTP, and UTP; 100 μm dATP, dGTP, dTTP and [α-33P]dCTP (4000 cpm/pm); 40 mmcreatine phosphate; 100 μg of creatine phosphokinase/ml; 0.5 mm dithiothreitol; 1 μg SV40 Tag; 10 ng of DNA template; and 75 μg of protein of HeLa cytoplasmic extract. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the reactions were terminated by adding 50 μl of stop solution (10 mg of proteinase K/ml; 10% SDS, and 0.5m EDTA) and incubating at 37 °C for 30 min. One-fifth of each reaction was acid precipitated for the determination of the total DNA synthesis. 20 μg of carrier tRNA were added to the remainder of the reaction, and after a phenol-chloroform extraction, the mixture was filtered through a MicroSpin S-200 HR column (Pharmacia Biotech). After ethanol precipitation, DNA products were treated with StyI restriction enzyme for pMKBNar and pMZBNar (Fig. 1 A),SfiI endonuclease for SV40 DNA, and SfiI orEcoRV endonuclease for pVil (Fig. 1 B) before analysis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The first-dimension electrophoresis was run at 0.6 V/cm for 14 h in a 0.4% agarose gel without ethidium bromide in 1 × TBE buffer (90 mmTris, 90 mm borate, 2 mm EDTA). The second-dimension electrophoresis was run in a cold room at 4 V/cm in a 1% agarose gel in 1 × TBE buffer containing 0.3 μg of ethidium bromide (18Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1987; 51: 463-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). The dried gel was subjected to autoradiography. After in vitro replication, DNA products were purified and digested with three restriction endonucleases:BglI, AflIII, and Bsu36I. The fragments were separated by 5% nondenaturating polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was then dried and exposed to a phosphor screen. The amount of labeled dCMP incorporated was quantified using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). DNA synthesis was normalized by dividing the band intensities by the number of cytosine residues in each fragment to account for the relative incorporation of radioactive dCMP into each fragment. To detect replication fork blockage by a unique acetylaminofluorene adduct, we analyzed the replication intermediates (RIs) by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis. This technique provides useful qualitative information about the mode of replication and has already been used to detect pause sites in DNA synthesis (19Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L.

Unmodified monomer plasmid DNAs were incubated in the presence of HeLa cytoplasmic extract at 37 °C as described in “Experimental Procedures.” DNA synthesis was SV40 Tag-dependent, and no incorporation could be detected when plasmid without a SV40 origin was used. About 25 pmol of dCMP were incorporated after a 60-min incubation with either of the two pMKBNar or pMZBNar plasmids (47 and 114 pmol of dCMP incorporated for 2 and 4 h of incubation, respectively). Reaction products were digested with StyI restriction enzyme, which cuts once at the origin (Fig. 1 A), and then analyzed by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig.2). For both plasmids, a simple Y arc was detected. This pattern is characteristic of DNA fragments with a unique replication fork coming from one extremity. A double Y profile that would correspond to RIs with two replication forks coming form both ends was not clearly observed. However, a very light and diffuse triangular region was detected. This indicates the convergence of opposing replication forks at multiple sites throughout some molecules. This analysis suggested that replication proceeds mostly unidirectionally on individual molecules. The result was unexpected because previous studies suggested that SV40 origin containing plasmids could replicate by a bidirectional mode (14Li J.J. Kelly T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1238-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 22Stillman B.W. Gluzman Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2051-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 23Wobbe C.R. Dean F. Weissbach L. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5710-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Plasmids used in this study possessed a minimal SV40 origin and were relatively small (2.7 kb). To see whether the unidirectional mode of replication was due to the initiation of synthesis at this minimal origin, we performed the same experiment with DNA directly isolated from the SV40 virus. In parallel, to follow the effect of plasmid size, we constructed a new plasmid, pVil, in which the 2517-bpSspI DNA fragment of pACYC184, containing the tetracyclin resistance gene, was cloned into the unique SspI site of pMKBNar (Fig. 1). In this way, we increased the size of the plasmid from 2.7 to 5.3 kb (size identical to that of wild type SV40 DNA) with the same minimal origin of replication (Fig. 1 B).The replication products derived from SV40 DNA virus and pVil plasmid were digested with the SfiI enzyme, which cuts once at the origin, and analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. We never succeeded in getting a complete digestion with SfiI endonuclease, even with large amounts of enzyme and prolonged incubation times. SfiI endonuclease cleaves DNA by a mechanism that differs from other restriction enzymes and is known to cut inefficiently substrates with only one SfiI site (24Wentzell L.M. Nobbs T.J. Halford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 581-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar,25Nobbs T.J. Halford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 399-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After digestion, two species coexisted in about the same proportion, linear DNA and nicked circular DNA (data not shown). But because no other enzyme could be used for cutting at a unique site in the replication origin, we decided to analyze the uncomplete restriction reaction product on two-dimensional gel (Fig.3 A). For both plasmids digested with SfiI endonuclease, a simple Y arc and a double Y arc were present. This indicates that some molecules replicated with only one replication fork, starting at the origin, and some replicated via a bidirectional mode. Another large spot, detected just on the top of the linear monomer, is attributed to nicked circular monomer. From this spot, a new arc starts, probably representing RIs with only one of the two replicated daughter strands cleaved by SfiI enzyme. To confirm the presence of unidirectionally synthesized molecules, we performed an additional experiment, in which replication products derived from pVil plasmid were digested with EcoRV, which cuts once at the opposite of the origin. The two-dimensional analysis gave a clear bubble to double Y transition (Fig. 3 B). Such a pattern demonstrated that in this assay, replication occurred mostly via only one fork (26Martin-Parras L. Hernandez P. Martinez-Robles M.-L. Schvartzman J.-B. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 843-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, an unexpected simple Y arc was detected. Because more than 94% of the input pVil plasmid is monomer, it seems unlikely that this simple Y arc resulted from replicated dimers (27Martin-Parras L. Hernandez P. Martinez-Robles M.L. Schvartzman J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22496-22505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These simple Y molecules were probably due to some initiation started randomly through the DNA. However, this random initiation appeared only with plasmid having a SV40 origin and requires the SV40 Tag. The existence of double Y-shaped molecules detected for both plasmids cleaved with SfiI endonuclease (Fig. 3 A) proves that all components were present in the cytoplasmic Hela cell extract to perform bidirectional replication. The minimal SV40 origin in pVil plasmid, and consequently in pMKNar and pMZNar plasmids, behave in the same manner as the complete wild type SV40 origin of replication. Although pVil and pMKBNar possess the same SV40 origin, molecules with two symmetrical forks arriving on opposite directions could be seen only with pVil. One possible explanation, for the small plasmid, is that one fork becomes functional and replicates the whole plasmid before the other fork has time to become operative. Due to the larger size of the plasmid pVil (which is identical to that of wild type SV40 DNA), sufficient time elapses before the completion of replication of the first fork to allow the second fork to start synthesis. Two-dimensional gel analysis showed that replication proceeds unidirectionaly in about half of the molecules. However, because SV40 origin-dependent synthesis can start from two opposite directions, the data do not exclude the possibility that 50% of the molecules replicate in one direction and 50% in the other. To examine this possibility, plasmid pVil was labeled for short periods in anin vitro assay and then digested with three restriction enzymes, Bsu36I, BglI, and AflIII. The fragments were resolved on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. DNA synthesis was quantified by determining the corrected labeling of each fragment (Fig. 4). After 15 min of incubation, only fragments D, E, and F, directly on each side of the origin, became labeled. After 20 min of incubation, the amount of label in fragments close to the origin increased, and some incorporation was detected in fragments B and C. Finally, labeling of fragment A, which is opposite the origin, was detected at the 30-min time point. At each time point, the incorporation of labeled dCMP followed a bell curve centered around the origin. These data are in agreement with those obtained with SV40 DNA (22Stillman B.W. Gluzman Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2051-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 23Wobbe C.R. Dean F. Weissbach L. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5710-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). They demonstrate that pVil DNA replication started from the origin sequence, and at this level of analysis, replication appeared to proceed in both directions from the origin with equal efficiency. It should be stressed that randomly initiated replicated molecules, which formed a simple Y arc after two-dimensional analysis (Fig. 3 B), were not observed on the one-dimensional analysis. They probably migrate as a very faint smear, and they represent only a minor portion of the replicated molecules. Taken together, results obtained by one- and two-dimensional gel analysis indicated that in a large percentage of the molecules, especially with plasmids of small size, replication occurred unidirectionally but could go in both directions with equal efficiency. To study the inhibition of fork progression by a bulky adduct, we used site-specific AAF-modified plasmids pMKBNar and pMZBNar. These vectors have been described elsewhere (7Thomas D.C. Veaute X. Fuchs R.P.P. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21226-21233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, the two plasmids differ only in the orientation of the HaeII restriction fragment containing the entirelacZ α complementing gene (Figs. 1 and5). When modified with AAF on the third guanine (G3) of the NarI site (5′-G1G2CG3CC), the pMKBNar substrate contains the adduct on the leading strand template with respect to the closest replication fork emanating from the SV40 origin. With pMZBNar DNA, the adduct is located on the lagging strand template in the same sequence context. The distance from SV40 origin to the AAF adduct is 523 nucleotides for pMKBNar and 588 nucleotides for pMZBNar, representing 19 and 21%, respectively, of the total size of the plasmid. Undamaged and site-specific modified substrates were replicated for 1 h in the HeLa cell extract. With AAF DNA, synthesis is about 30% less efficient than with the unmodified substrates. Following extraction and precipitation (see “Experimental Procedures”), samples were subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis (Fig. 5). For both unmodified DNAs, as described before, a smooth simple Y arc was detected (Fig. 2). With AAF-modified pMKBNar, an accumulation of RIs at a specific site was visible (Fig. 5 B). These molecules migrate like linear molecules of approximately 3350 bp. This corresponds to RIs of Y forms with two short arms of ∼560 bp in length. The distance between theStyI site and the AAF adduct is 572 nucleotides. Therefore, these RIs represent molecules with replication fork 1 blocked at the unique AAF lesion. This fork “sees” the adduct on the leading strand. In addition, some double Y forms can be detected, starting from RIs with the inhibited fork 1. They represent molecules with replication fork 2 coming from the opposite direction. Indeed, because fork 1 is stalled at the lesion, fork 2 has time to start and achieve replication of the molecule. The signal of the double Ys has a hook at the end, which is exactly what it is expected for a unique class of molecules with two forks that meet at an asymmetric location (26Martin-Parras L. Hernandez P. Martinez-Robles M.-L. Schvartzman J.-B. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 843-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This is an additional proof for the asynchrony in the initiation of the two replication forks. With AAF-modified pMZBNar, a strong spot corresponding to accumulated RIs of ∼5000 bp lies on the simple Y arc (Fig. 5 D). These Y-shaped molecules possess two arms of ∼2210 bp each. This is exactly the distance that fork 2 has to move before encountering the lesion. For this fork 2, the adduct is on the leading strand. The presence of double Y forms starting from this spot indicates that in some molecules, when fork 2 is stalled at the lesion, fork 1 becomes functional, as shown in Fig. 5 D. Using this site-specific modified vector, no inhibition of fork 1 can be detected. Taken together, these data mean that replication forks are blocked only by adducts located on the leading strand template, and in this case, the other replication fork can still progress toward the first fork with some retardation. Previous work has suggested that only lesions located on the leading strand are capable of inhibiting the progression of replication forks, but no direct evidence has been shown yet. The purpose of this study was to test this hypothesis using DNA plasmids modified with a single site-specific AAF adduct on either the leading or lagging strand template. In this work, several unexpected results were found concerning the mode of replication of SV40 origin-dependent DNA after incubation with HeLa cell extract. The technique of two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis provides detailed information about the mechanism of replication (10Friedman K.L. Brewer B.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). StyI-digested replication intermediates that resulted from in vitro synthesis of pMKBNar and pMZBNar in the presence of HeLa cell extract migrate along a simple Y arc, indicating that plasmids are replicated mostly by only one replication fork. A very faint triangular pattern indicated the presence of plasmids with two replication forks moving in the opposite direction. We decided to test whether this “unidirectional” mode of replication at the origin was due to the use of a minimal SV40 origin. SV40 DNA was replicated in vitro with HeLa cell extract, and labeled products were analyzed by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis. As with previous plasmids, a simple Y arc was detected, meaning that a lot of SV40 molecules are replicated by only one replication fork. However, a very clear double Y line is now detectable, corresponding to replication intermediates with two forks. Some molecules were therefore replicated bidirectionally. These data are consistent with those obtained by Dhar and Schildkraut (20Dhar V. Schildkraut C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6268-6278Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using the same system; they also found the presence of highly asymmetric molecules. However, the proportion of molecules with two replication forks seems to be higher in their study. Reasons for this discrepancy are not clear; some difference in quality and efficiency of the extract as a function of cell culture conditions or mode of extraction may be important factors. In our case, we tested two different HeLa extract preparations and obtained exactly the same results. Two parameters differ between SV40 DNA molecules and pMKBNar or pMZBNar plasmids: the sizes (5243 bp and 2782 bp, respectively) and the origin, which is complete in SV40 DNA and “minimal” in pMKBNar. To examine whether RIs with two replication forks diverging from the origin can be obtained with the minimal origin, we constructed a new 5303-bp plasmid, pVil, which contains the whole pMKBNar plus an extra DNA sequence not related to SV40. The pattern obtained with pVil after replication andSfiI digestion on two-dimensional gel analysis was exactly the same as the one observed with SV40 DNA. Therefore, whatever the origin used in the in vitro replication assay, molecules with bidirectional synthesis are present. The size of the DNA seems to be crucial to detect RIs with two forks. Because two forks can assemble at the SV40 origin and a large proportion of the input plasmid is replicated by only one fork, we examined which one is functional. One-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that about 50% of molecules are duplicated in one direction and 50% in the other. In other words, analysis made at the population level shows that replication proceeds in both direction from the origin, but at the individual level, a large proportion of molecules are replicated in an unidirectional mode. This idea was first proposed and rejected by Stillman and Gluzman (22Stillman B.W. Gluzman Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2051-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The rejection was based on the data of Li and Kelly (14Li J.J. Kelly T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1238-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), who showed electron microscope pictures of replicative intermediates of SV40 DNA incubated in the presence of COS-1 cell extract. In this study, newly replicated viral DNA with two forks going in opposite directions were detected. They also found some RIs presenting fork asymmetrically distributed compared with the origin and interpreted them as asynchrony in fork progression. It is possible that some factors necessary for synchrony of fork movement or initiation are present in COS extract and in limiting amounts in HeLa cell extract. Indeed, COS cells are green monkey kidney cells, which are the natural host of the SV40 virus, expressing a high level of SV40 Tag, whereas HeLa cells are semipermissive for SV40 replication. A second point should be stressed at this time. The two-dimensional electrophoresis analysis takes into account all the replicated DNA, but electron microscopy focuses only on small numbers of individual molecules. Our data are not formally in disagreement with those of Li and Kelly (14Li J.J. Kelly T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1238-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). SV40 and pVil synthesis revealed the presence of molecules with two forks diverging symmetrically from the origin, but a large proportion of them present such high asynchrony that they seem to be replicated unidirectionally. Previous studies have shown a strong inhibition of the replication fork by different DNA lesions, such as UV (28Sarasin A.R. Hanawalt P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 299-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 29Edenberg H.J. Virology. 1983; 16: 298-309Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 30Clark J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Mutat.

Fuchs R.P.P. Sarasin A. Carcinogenesis. 1988; 9: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Given the asymmetry of the DNA replication process, a DNA adduct may have different capacities for blocking replication depending on whether the adduct is located on the leading or lagging strand template. The mechanism by which lesions inhibit eucaryotic DNA replication are still under investigation. One model suggests that lesions in the leading strand template block replication fork progression, whereas lesions in the template for discontinuous synthesis block only completion of an Okazaki fragment, without hindering the fork movement (31Berger C.A. Edenberg H.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3443-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 32Armier J. Mezzina M. Leng M. Fuchs R.P.P. Sarasin A.

We directly tested this model using AAF-monomodified vectors in anin vitro replication assay. Two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis analysis revealed an accumulation of RIs having the replication fork blocked at the unique lesion located on the leading strand template. No inhibition of fork progression was detected when the adduct was on the lagging strand template. The same result was obtained with plasmids containing either a singlecis,syn-cyclobutane dimer or a pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone. 2Unpublished data. Our data prove unambiguously the validity of the model. When products of in vitro replication of AAF monomodified pMKBNar or pMZBNar reaction are loaded on 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide, newly synthesized covalently closed monomer-length molecules (RF I) are observed. It has been proved that some of these molecules still contain the AAF adduct, meaning that translesion replication occurred (7Thomas D.C. Veaute X. Fuchs R.P.P. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21226-21233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 13Thomas D.C. Veaute X. Kunkel T.A. Fuchs R.P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11476-11482Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 8Thomas D.C. Svoboda D.L. Vos J.-M.H. Kunkel T.A. Mol. Cell.

How these RF I molecules are produced is not clear. In our present work, we cannot distinguish whether AAF constitutes an absolute block or transiently inhibits the progression of the leading fork. If it constitutes an absolute block, this would mean that RF I molecules result from the replication using the lagging strand replication apparatus. If the fork encountering the adduct on the leading strand template is only transiently blocked, translesion synthesis may result from the leading strand replication complex. It may be possible to resolve this issues in the future using substrates containing a replication terminal signal. Because DNA replication is an asymmetric process, questions concerning the mechanism and the fidelity of synthesis of damaged leading or lagging strands was approached using SV40 origin-dependent replication in vitro (6Thomas D.C. Nguyen D.C. Piegorsch W.W. Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11476-11482Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 7Thomas D.C. Veaute X. Fuchs R.P.P. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 11975-11979Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For this purpose, lesions are situated close to the origin at a distance of less than 20% of the total size of the vector. In such constructions, it is assumed that the closer fork will encounter the lesion first and eventually achieve translesion synthesis. This assumption is based on the hypothesis that replication of SV40-based plasmids is bidirectional and synchronous from the SV40 origin. We clearly show in this study that it is not the case. Most of the molecules are replicated by only one fork, implying that after about 1 h of incubation in the extract, the distal fork reaches the adduct before the proximal fork is functional in approximately half of the population. These data suggest that: (i) each cell extract preparation should be tested for its ability to perform bidirectional replication using the two-dimensional agarose gel before examining the fidelity of leading and lagging strand synthesis, and (ii) a SV40 origin-dependent replication assay is probably not suitable for these studies without the development of new strategies like the construction of substrates containing a replication termination signal.

These results suggested that the protein might influence the maturation of megakaryocytes via action as a serpin. The generation of megakaryocytes is a complex process dependent on the interaction of hematopoietic progenitor cells, cytokines, and stromal elements (1Metcalf D. Trends Biochem.

The failure of an organism to maintain adequate megakaryocyte numbers leads to thrombocytopenia and consequent bleeding disorders that can result in death. It has been reported that several humoral factors have influences on megakaryocyte development (3Gordon M.S. Hoffman R. Blood. 1992; 80: 302-307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is believed that megakaryocyte proliferation is dependent on the essential megakaryocyte colony-stimulating factor (Meg-CSF) 1The abbreviations used are: Meg-CSF, megakaryocyte colony-stimulating factor; Meg-POT, megakaryocyte potentiator; IL, interleukin; serpin, serine protease inhibitor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; API, Achromobacter protease I; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; FBS, fetal bovine serum; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PAI, plasminogen activator inhibitor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MES, 4-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. and the ancillary megakaryocyte potentiator (Meg-POT), which augment the proliferation (3Gordon M.S.

It is argued that these two factors act at different stages of megakaryocyte development. While Meg-CSF is required for colony induction from megakaryocyte progenitor cells, Meg-POT stimulates the maturation of megakaryocyte into platelets.

This factor was termed thrombopoietin and was shown to be the primary regulator of the megakaryocyte development (16Kaushansky K. Broudy V.C. Lin N. Korgensen M.J. McCarty J. Fox N. Zucker-Franklin D. Lofton-Day C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3234-3238Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). However, it is suggested that thrombopoiesis independent of thrombopoietin is also operating in vivo(17Gurney A.L. Carver-Moore K. de Sauvage F.J. Moore M.W. Nature. 1994; 265: 1445-1447Google Scholar). In the studies reported here we have purified, cloned the cDNA for, and characterized a new family member of serpin that exhibited megakaryocyte maturation activity. A protein-free culture system not requiring serum or serum components, hormones, or any other growth factors was employed for the purification of the factor. The advantage of this system is that the detection and purification of small quantities of biologically active proteins could be easily accomplished without interference by the contaminant serum components (18Yamaguchi N. Kawai K. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 5353-5359PubMed Google Scholar, 19Yamaguchi N. Chung S. Shiroeda O. Koyama K. Imanishi J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 658-663PubMed Google Scholar). Our results may add a new biological activity to the growing family of serpin. Cell lines were propagated in protein-free Ham's F-12 medium, and the culture medium was collected at confluence as described previously (18Yamaguchi N. Kawai K. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 5353-5359PubMed Google Scholar, 19Yamaguchi N. Chung S. Shiroeda O. Koyama K. Imanishi J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 658-663PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation and/or filtration though a glass filter. The culture supernatants were concentrated by ultrafiltration in a Pericon cassette (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and the concentrates were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) extensively. To supply the starting material for the large scale purification, cell culture was performed employing the Opti-cell perfusion-culture system (Cellex, Minneapolis, MN). All procedures were performed at 4 °C. The dialyzed protein concentrate was applied to a Matrex Blue-A (Amicon, Beverly, MA) column (5 × 30 cm) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4). After washing, the bound proteins were eluted with the same buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl. The bound fraction from the Matrex Blue-A column was pooled, dialyzed against Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), and applied to a Q-Sepharose CL-6B (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) column (2.5 × 40 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer. After the sample was loaded, the column was washed with the equilibration buffer, and the factor was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.3 m NaCl. The active fractions (eluted at around 0.1 m NaCl) from the Q-Sepharose column were pooled, and ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration of 30% saturation. The sample was then applied to a phenyl-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) column (2.5 × 20 cm) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.4 containing 30% saturation of ammonium sulfate. After washing, the factor was eluted with a linear gradient of 30–0% saturation of ammonium sulfate. The active fractions (eluted at about 20% saturation of ammonium sulfate) from the phenyl-Sepharose column were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mm MES-NaCl buffer (pH 5.5) and applied to an S-Sepharose (Pharmacia) column (2.5 × 20 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer. After washing, the factor was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl. The active fractions (eluted at about 0.15 m NaCl) from the S-Sepharose column were pooled, dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and concentrated on YM-10 membrane in an Amicon cell. The concentrate was applied on a Sephacryl S-200 (Pharmacia) column (2.5 × 120 cm) equililbrated in PBS and eluted with the same buffer. Sequence analysis of peptides obtained from the Achromobacter protease I (API) digest of the purified protein was performed using an Applied Biosystem 477A gas phase sequencer according to the manufacturer's program. The resulting phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives were identified by reversed-phase HPLC with an Applied Biosystem 120A on-line system. Poly(A)+ RNA was purified from total RNA extracted from A431 cells using oligo(dT)-latex. The A431 cell cDNA library was then constructed from poly(A)+RNA using a cDNA synthesis kit obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. The cDNA for the protein was amplified employing RACE strategy. Based on the determined peptide sequences, two oligonucleotides for 3′-RACE were synthesized. The sequences were 5′-GTIGA(A/G)IIIGTIGA(C/T)TT(C/T)ACIAA(C/T)CA(C/T)(C/T)IGA(A/G)GA(C/T)AC-3′ (NI65) and 5′-TACATCGAIGTIACIGA(A/G)GA(A/G)GGIAC(A/C/G/T)GA(A/G)-3′ (NI67). Employing a 3′-RACE kit (Life Technologies), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was first performed between NI67 and the 3′-RACE adaptor primer attached to the kit. The reaction product was then subjected to a second PCR using NI67 and 3′-RACE adaptor primer. The reaction was carried out on a Perkin-Elmer thermal cycler. The amplified product of about 900 base pairs was obtained. Based on the sequence of this product, the antisense primer, 5′-ATGTTGTGGGGACTGCTATA-3′ (KY100) was synthesized. PCR was then performed between NI65 and KY100, and the amplified product of 807 base pairs was obtained. Based on the determined DNA sequences above, three oligonucleotides for 5′-RACE were synthesized. These sequences were 5′-CTCAGGCAGCAGAACGTACAT-3′ (NI075), 5′-TTGCCACTTGCCTTTGAAGTA-3′ (TP11), 5′-ACTAGCCGCTACAGTCAACA-3′ (gt11 5′-forward primer, F2), and 5′-GGCGACGACTCCTGGAGCCCG-3′ (gt11 5′-forward primer, F). Employing 5′-RACE reaction, PCR was first performed between F2 and NI075, and the product was subjected to the second PCR using F and TP11. The amplified product of about 700 base pairs was obtained. Based on the sequence of this product, 5′-AACTGAAGCCCAGCTGTGAA-3′ (NI083) was synthesized. After synthesizing first strand cDNA with A431 poly(A)+ RNA using random hexamer (Preamplification System, Life Technologies), PCR was performed using the primers NI083 and NI074 to get a 1001-base pair structural gene fragment. This PCR fragment was directly sequenced again by the method of Sanger et al. (20Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52746) Google Scholar) using a Taq dye primer cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected with the expression plasmid, pdKCR-dhfr-TP55, which was constructed as described previously using the cloned cDNA (21Tsujimoto M. Adachi H. Kodama S. Tsuruoka N. Yamada Y. Tanaka S. Mita S. Takatsu K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1989; 106: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and maintained in an α-minimal essential medium lacking ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides, supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (FBS) in the presence of methotrexate (1 μm). The transfectants were grown to confluency in roller bottles (850 cm2, Corning, NY) in Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 5% FBS. The cells were subsequently washed twice with PBS and incubated for 48 h with two changes of the medium. After changing to a serum-free medium (i.e. Ham's F12 medium containing 5 mg/liter bovine insulin and 1 mg/liter bovine transferrin), the culture was continued for 3 more days, and the spent medium was collected. The fresh serum-free medium was added, and the procedure was repeated. The viability of the cells after final collection was greater than 90% as determined by trypan blue exclusion. The purification of the recombinant factor was performed following the procedure described for the natural factor. Liquid marrow cultures employing murine bone marrow cells were performed as described by Ishibashi et al. (7Ishibashi T. Kimura H. Uchida T. Kariyone S. Frise P. Burstein S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5953-5957Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Marrow was flushed from the femurs of BDF1 mice with Opti-MEM I (Life Technologies) supplemented with 5% FBS. Nucleated nonadherent marrow cells (5 × 105) were set up (22Teramura M. Katahira J. Hoshino S. Motoji T. Mizoguchi H. Exp. Hematol. 1988; 16: 843-848PubMed Google Scholar) in 96-well plates in 0.1 ml of Opti-MEM I containing 0.5% FBS in the presence or absence of 25 ng/ml of murine IL-3 (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA). After incubation at 37 °C for 4 days, the appearance of megakaryocytes was assayed by histochemical staining for acetylcholine esterase, the marker of murine megakaryocyte, whose activity was measured by the fluorometric method as described (7Ishibashi T. Kimura H. Uchida T. Kariyone S. Frise P. Burstein S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5953-5957Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). One hundred eighty μl of a solution of 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 0.12 m NaCl, 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) was added to each well, followed by the addition of 20 μl of acetylcholine iodide to the final concentration of 5.6 mm. After a 3-h incubation at room temperature, 20 μl of the reaction mixture from each well was transferred to the corresponding well of a 96-well plate (MicroFLUOR, Dynatech). Twenty μl of 0.4 mm7-diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin was then added followed by 160 μl of diluent buffer (0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0)). Fluorescence emission was determined on a fluorescence concentration analyzer (Pandex, Mundelein, IL) capable of reading 96-well plates and was expressed in arbitrary units. Human megakaryocyte colony formation was performed as described previously (22Teramura M. Katahira J. Hoshino S. Motoji T. Mizoguchi H. Exp. Hematol. 1988; 16: 843-848PubMed Google Scholar). Cell suspensions of 2 × 105nonadherent mononuclear cells were cultured in 35-mm Petri dishes in 1 ml of ASF 101 medium (Ajinomoto, Tokyo, Japan) containing 0.3% agar, 20% human plasma (AB type), and various concentrations of factors tested. The cultures were incubated for 14 days at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 5% O2. For murine megakaryocyte colony formation, 20% FBS was used instead of human plasma. Human megakaryocyte colonies were detected by the alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase technique using the monoclonal antibody to GP IIb/IIIa (P2; Cosmobio, Tokyo, Japan) as described previously (22Teramura M. Katahira J. Hoshino S. Motoji T. Mizoguchi H. Exp. Hematol. 1988; 16: 843-848PubMed Google Scholar). Culture plates were dehydrated in the Petri dishes using filter paper and fixed with cold 2.5% formalin-aceton for 1 min. The fixed plates were washed twice with PBS and covered with 2 ml of PBS containing 10 units/ml agarase (Calbiochem) for 7 min at 37 °C. After two washes in PBS, immunostaining was performed using an alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase immunostaining kit (Zymed, San Francisco, CA). The plates were then counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin for 10 min. Megakaryocyte colonies were defined as groups of three or more P2-positive cells. Murine megakaryocyte colonies were enumerated after histochemical staining for acetylcholine esterase and counterstaining with hematoxylin as described (7Ishibashi T. Kimura H. Uchida T. Kariyone S. Frise P. Burstein S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5953-5957Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). For the in vivo assay, C57BL/6 mice were treated with 10 daily intraperitoneal injections of either 5 mg/kg (about 100 μg/100 μl buffer/head) of the recombinant factor or control buffer. On day 10, after 4 h of the last injection, blood was collected from the orbital plexus of unanesthetized mice using siliconized micropipettes. The white blood cell count was taken using an electronic Coulter counter. The pure recombinant factor (50 μg/ml, Fig.2) was coated on 96-well plastic dishes overnight at 4 °C. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin, dilutions of mAbs (0.46 ng/ml-1000 ng/ml) were added and allowed to bind to the immobilized recombinant factor. After washing, the bound mAbs were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-murine IgG (Bio-Rad). Absorbance readings were taken at 450 and 570 nm. Protease activity was determined from the rate of increase in absorbance at 405 nm using H-d-Val-l-Leu-l-Lys-p-nitroanilide (S-2251, Dai-ichi Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) as a substrate. In brief, the reaction mixture containing 0.5 mg/ml S-2251 and the desired concentration of enzyme preparation in 0.1 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) was incubated at room temperature for 60 min, and then the absorbance at 405 nm was read. In initial experiments, we surveyed about 40 human cell lines for their ability to induce the megakaryocyte from murine bone marrow cells in the presence of murine IL-3 by measuring acetylcholine esterase activity (a specific marker for murine megakaryocytes). All cell lines tested were grown in the protein-free media. The activity in their conditioned media was measured in the presence of neutralizing antibody to IL-6 because many cell lines tested produced this cytokine in large quantities. We chose the conditioned medium of A431 cells as the starting material for the purification of megakaryocyte maturation factor, since this cell line produced a higher activity, which was not inhibited by the antibody. To purify the megakaryocyte maturation factor in adequate quantities, A431 cells were grown in an Opti-cell perfusion-culture system to near confluency using a serum-containing medium, which was then replaced with the protein-free medium (18Yamaguchi N. Kawai K. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 5353-5359PubMed Google Scholar, 19Yamaguchi N. Chung S. Shiroeda O. Koyama K. Imanishi J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 658-663PubMed Google Scholar). After the medium was changed, cells were cultured for 3 months with the continuous supply of the protein-free medium, and overflowed medium was collected and pooled. In total, 500 liters of the medium were pooled, concentrated, and subjected to the purification. Initial fractionation was based on the moderate affinity of the factor to Matrex Blue-A column. The bound fraction was collected, dialyzed, and subjected to Q-Sepharose column chromatography followed by phenyl-Sepharose and S-Sepharose column chromatographies. The last two steps were quite effective in removing the contaminant proteins. Active fractions were pooled, concentrated, and further fractionated by gel filtration column chromatography (Fig. 1). Calibration of the column with molecular weight standards indicated that the apparent molecular weight of the active fraction was about 55,000. On SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis, this final preparation showed diffuse doublet bands of approximately 55 kDa (Fig.2). The acetylcholine esterase activity coincided well with the doublet bands. After treatment with endoglycosidase F, both protein bands were shifted to 40 kDa, indicating that the factor was glycosylated. Eighty μg of the purified protein was obtained after the purification process. However, we could not estimate the recovery of the factor, because substantial megakaryocyte maturation activities were detected in other fractions assayed even in the presence of the antibody to human IL-6. As shown in Fig. 3, the addition of the purified factor to murine bone marrow cells increased the acetylcholine esterase activity in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of murine IL-3. In the absence of IL-3, the factor had little effect on the enzyme activity. Under the microscope, bone marrow cells cultured with the factor contained more megakaryocytes than those cultured without the factor, suggesting that the factor potentiated the appearance of megakaryocytes (data not shown). Therefore, we decided to clone its cDNA to characterize it further. Several attempts to sequence directly the purified protein from the N terminus were unsuccessful, suggesting that the N terminus of the protein was blocked. Therefore, it was treated with API, and the peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC. The amino acid sequences of several peptides were determined. The oligonucleotides corresponding to the two determined sequences (i.e. VEXVDFTNHLEDTXXNINK and XYIEVTEEGTEAXAAXG) were prepared and used in a series of PCRs with cDNAs prepared from A431 cells to obtain specific primers. The amino acid sequence predicted from the amplified product contained the determined sequences of the peptides, confirming that this amplified product was generated from the cDNA of the megakaryocyte maturation factor. The cDNA and the deduced amino acid sequences are shown in Fig.4. The cDNA sequence contains 1950 nucleotides including the 73-nucleotide 5′-untranslated region and 737-nucleotide 3′-untranslated region excepting the poly(dA) tract. The 5′-untranslated region contains an in-frame stop codon preceding a putative initiator methionine codon. It encodes a protein of 380 amino acid residues with the predicted molecular weight of 42,874, which is comparable with the deglycosylated form of the purified protein described above. The predicted primary structure of the protein contained four potential N-glycosylation sites and five cysteine residues. The deduced amino acid sequence contained all of the sequences of the peptide fragments determined. The megakaryocyte maturation factor shows significant sequence similarity to the serpin superfamily of serine protease inhibitors (Fig. 5). It exhibits 27.1% amino acid identity to human PAI-1 (23Ginsburg D. Zeheb R. Yang A.Y. Rafferty U.M. Andreasen P.A. Niejsen L. Dano K. Lebo R.V. Gelehrter T.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1673-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and the highest 38.2% to human PAI-2 (24Schleuning W.D. Medcalf R.L. Hession C. Rothenbuhler R. Shaw A. Kruithof E.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4564-4567Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The P1 residue of serpin, located immediately upstream of the putative reactive center is a critical determinant of the target specificity, and the sequence alignment identified this megakaryocyte maturation factor as a Lys serpin (25Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected with the expression plasmid for the maturation factor, designated pdKCR-dhfr-TP55 and prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A clone resistant to 1 μm methotrexate was selected and cultured in roller bottles, and the supernatant was collected. After concentration and dialysis, the recombinant protein was purified by serial chromatographies on Q-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, and S-Sepharose columns as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purified protein showed a molecular mass of 55 kDa on SDS-PAGE, which was comparable with the natural one (data not shown). It was digested with API, and the resultant fragments were separated by reversed-phase HPLC and sequenced. We could identify peptides that were expected from the cDNA sequence (data not shown). Among four potential N-glycosylation sites, at least two (i.e. Asn68 and Asn215) were shown to be glycosylated, because Asn residues at these sites could not be detected in the sequences of the corresponding API digests. Fig. 6 shows the effect of the recombinant megakaryocyte maturation factor on the induction of megakaryocyte from murine bone marrow cells. In the absence of murine IL-3, no effect was observed in cultures treated with the recombinant protein. In the presence of murine IL-3, however, the addition of the recombinant protein increased the acetylcholine esterase activity in a dose-dependent manner. The activity of the recombinant protein was comparable with that of natural protein purified from A431 cells. Under the microscope, an increase in the number of megakaryocyte was definitely observed. The cell populations other than megakaryocyte in the factor-treated culture were not different from those in untreated culture (data not shown). To rule out the possible presence of contaminating protein having megakaryocyte maturation activity, we have prepared several murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the recombinant protein and examined their effects on the ability of the factor to increase the acetylcholine esterase activity in murine bone marrow cell culture. We have chosen two mAbs (designated 35 and 336) to test this ability, because these two mAbs were shown to have highly similar binding abilities to the purified recombinant protein in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Fig. 7 A). As expected, an irrelevant mAb called 2F, which was prepared against recombinant human IL-5, had no binding activity. We have also performed Western blot analysis and found that both mAbs 35 and 336 detected the 55-kDa bands, but mAb 2F did not (data not shown). Fig. 7 B shows the effects of mAbs on the biological activity of the recombinant protein. While mAb 336 decreased the megakaryocyte maturation activity significantly, the other two mAbs (35 and 2F) had no effect. These results suggested that the factor indeed induced the megakaryocyte maturation in vitro. However, a relatively large amount of the factor was required for the action on the murine cells (human IL-11 showed 1000-fold higher activity than the factor), suggesting its species-specific action (Fig. 6). To test the species specificity, the effect of the factor on megakaryocyte colony formation from human and murine bone marrow cells was compared (Fig. 8). We employed megakaryocyte colony assay instead of acetylcholine esterase assay because, unlike murine cells, the enzyme is not a marker of human megakaryocytes. It should also be noted that the acetylcholine esterase assay cannot distinguish exactly between an increase in the number of megakaryocytes and an increase in the amount of acetylcholine esterase per megakaryocyte. We employed human IL-11 as a standard for the comparison of the activities. In the absence of IL-3, the factor had no effect both on human and murine cells. On the other hand, in the presence of IL-3, the factor increased the number of megakaryocyte colonies both in human and murine cultures. While the factor was, on a weight basis, more than 1000-fold less active than IL-11 on murine cells, it was only less than 10-fold less active than IL-11 on human cells, clearly indicating the species-specific action of the factor. The human IL-11 was equally potent on both cells, although the number of colonies attained was less in human than in murine cell cultures. These results also made it unlikely that a contaminating cytokine was responsible for megakaryocyte maturation in our assay system, because on a molar basis the factor showed activity comparable with that of IL-11 on human cells. It was also observed that the factor had no effect on formation of myeloid or erythroid colonies (data not shown). When mice were injected with 100 μg/head of recombinant megakaryocyte maturation factor daily for 10 days, a 40% increase in platelet counts in plasma in comparison w"

The molecular mass of the epimerase determined on a Superdex column was 82.6 kDa, while the subunit molecular mass determined on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 13.7 kDa. This implies that the epimerase most probably exists as homohexamer. The 20-amino acid sequence from the N terminus was determined (AQPAAIIRIKNLRLRTFIGI). Based on this sequence, the gene encoding the epimerase was cloned using a simple polymerase chain reaction approach. Translation of the nucleotide sequence of the cloned gene revealed the presence of an open reading frame containing 120 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 13,993 Da. The epimerase gene located in a 2.3-kilobase BamHI-EcoRI fragment from Kohara's clone 406 was overexpressed 300-fold, which was confirmed by the prominent increase in the 14-kDa protein band on SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels.

Tetrahedron Lett. 1992; 33: 1341-1342Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). d-threo-Neopterin (1′R,2′R) or d-monapterin, tentatively termed as umanopterin (3Ogiwara S. Nagatsu T. Teradaira R. Fujita K. Sugimoto T. Tetrahedron Lett. 1992; 33: 1341-1342Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar), has been found in human urine and normally takes up 4–15% of d-neopterin. It is also present in Tetrahymena pyriformis (4Klein R. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).l-threo-Neopterin (1′S,2′S) or l-monapterin appears to be the major pterin in E. coli (5Rembold H. Heinz G. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1971; 342: 1271-1272Google Scholar). This compound has also been found in substantial quantities in Pseudomonasspecies (6Guroff G. Rhoads C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 142-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where its tetrahydro form functions as a coenzyme in the enzymatic hydroxylation of phenylalanine to tyrosine. It can also act as an inhibitor for human 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase (EC4.6.1.10) (7Blau N. Steinerstauch P. Redweik U. Pfister K. Schoedon G. Kierat L. Niederwieser A. Curtius H.-C. Blau N. Unconjugated Pterins and Related Biogenic Amines. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin, Germany1987: 105-115Google Scholar). The cyclic monophosphate of l-threo-neopterin has been identified in Methylococcus capsulatus and its suggested function was a cofactor for alcohol dehydrogenase (8Urushibara T. Forrest H.S. Hoare D.S. Patel R.N. Biochem. J. 1971; 125: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Also in Dictyostelium discoideum a distinct chemotactic activity toward l-monapterin was observed during the developmental phase after starvation and its implication in cell sorting has been suggested (9Tillinghast H.S. Newell P.C. J. Cell. Sci. 1987; 87: 45-53PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli excrete l-monapterin during their logarithmic growth phase. At the switch from the logarithmic to the stationary phase, there is a burst increase in excretion ofl-monapterin and its role as a marker for cell proliferation has been suggested (10Wachter H. Hausen A. Reider E. Schweiger M. Naturwissenschaften. 1980; 67: 610-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the biological function of l-monapterin in this organism. In E. coli, l-monapterin is made from H2MTP after successive dephosphorylation and oxidation. H2MTP is formed by an epimerase (11Heine M.C. Brown G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 411: 236-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) acting on C2′ carbon of H2NTP (Fig. 1), which is made from GTP by GTP cyclohydrolase I (EC 3.5.4.16) (12Yim J.J. Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5087-5094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). H2NTP is a key intermediate for the biosynthesis of many pteridine compounds of biological significance. These include tetrahydrobiopterin, methanopterin, molybdopterin, drosopterin, sepiapterin, limipterin, and folates (13Dorsett D.L. Yim J.J. Jacobson K.B.

Despite its long history of existence in E. coli, H2NTP 2′-epimerase has not previously been purified to homogeneity. Some characteristics of the epimerase have been studied with only partially purified enzymes (7Blau N. Steinerstauch P. Redweik U. Pfister K. Schoedon G. Kierat L. Niederwieser A. Curtius H.-C. Blau N. Unconjugated Pterins and Related Biogenic Amines. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin, Germany1987: 105-115Google Scholar, 11Heine M.C. Brown G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 411: 236-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The aims of the previous studies were not to get a highly purified enzyme, but rather to learn as much as possible about how l-monapterin is made. The present work was initiated to elucidate the biological function ofl-monapterin in E. coli as well as to further investigate the physico-chemical properties of the epimerase with completely purified enzymes. We report here the purification, partial amino acid sequence, cloning, and overexpression of the epimerase fromE. coli. All chemicals used were of reagent grade.d-7,8-Dihydroneopterin, d-neopterin, andl-monapterin were purchased from Dr. B. Schircks Laboratories (Switzerland). The frozen E. coli cells (ATCC 11303), harvested in late log phase from Kornberg medium, were obtained from General Biochemicals. GTP, alkaline phosphatase, calibration proteins for gel filtration (MW-GF-20), Sephadex G-10, Cibacron blue 3GA dye resin, phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B, methotrexate-agarose, and Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel were purchased from Sigma. Calibration proteins for SDS-PAGE were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim GmbH. The restriction enzymes and DNA modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs, Promega Corp., Postech Biotechnology, and Boehringer Mannheim. Dynazyme for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were purchased from Finnzymes Oy (Finland). Nylon membranes were purchased from ICN. [α-32P]UTP and [α-35S]dATP were purchased from Amersham Nuclear Corp. Sequenase version 2.0 sequencing kit was purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. The primers were synthesized at DNA International. E. coli Gene Mapping Membrane was purchased from TaKaRa Shuzo. E. coli genomic library was from CLONTECH Laboratories. Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. DH5α E. coli strain was used as a host cell for plasmids, while Gln358 was used for phage propagation. pBluescript II KS (Stratagene) and pBSTA (pBluescript II KS backbone; a plasmid designed for direct-cloning of PCR product) were used for cloning of general DNA fragments and for PCR products, respectively. Phage 406 (9D2) is a clone of the Kohara's miniset (19Kohara Y. Akiyama K. Isono K. Cell. 1987; 50: 495-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). Luria-Bertani (LB) and NZCYM media were used for E. coli and phages, respectively (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). H2NTP was made enzymatically from GTP as described previously (12Yim J.J. Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5087-5094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since H2NTP is very unstable and prone to photooxidation, many aliquots were made and stored frozen at −70 °C in the darkness until used. The enzyme reaction mixture (25 μl) contained 40 mm PIPES (pH 6.2), 4 mm MgCl2, 40 mm H2NTP, and the epimerase preparation. The reaction was carried out by incubating the mixture for 10 min at 50 °C in the darkness and terminated by heat for 1 min in boiling water. To dephosphorylate the remaining substrate (H2NTP) and the product (H2MTP), the mixture was treated with 2.5 units of alkaline phosphatase for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by treatments of 2.5 μl of 30% trichloroacetic acid and 5 μl of 1% I2, 2% KI for 15 min at 4 °C for the oxidation of reactants. After proteins were removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 15 min), a 30-μl aliquot of the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and neutralized by 2 μl of 2n NaOH. Excess iodine was reduced with 4 μl of 2% ascorbic acid. A 2-μl aliquot of the final assay mixture was subjected to reversed-phase HPLC (Waters, Model 510) equipped with Partisil ODS C18 column (Whatman, 0.39 × 30 cm). The column was pumped using water as a mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min and the eluent was monitored with a fluorescence detector (Shimadzu RF-540). Enzyme activity was determined by integrating the peak area of l-monapterin. To avoid photooxidation of pteridines, all operations were conducted in dim light. All assays were performed in duplicate. During the routine assay of the epimerase activity, the percent conversion ofd-neopterin to l-monapterin ((area ofd-monapterin × 100)/(area of d-neopterin + l-monapterin)) was monitored. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme which catalyzes the formation of 1 nmol of H2MTP/min. The volume of the epimerase preparation in the assay mixture was chosen so that the ratio ofl-monapterin/d-neopterin never exceeded 0.3 at the end of the assay. Product formation was shown to be linear with enzyme concentration and incubation time under standard reactions. All enzyme purification steps were performed at 4 °C. 500 g of frozen cells were resuspended in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and disrupted by sonication (Ultrasonic Processor XL, Misonix, Inc.). Total process time was 10 min with 5 s of pulse on time and 10 s of pulse off time. Cell debris were removed by centrifugation (5,500 ×g for 30 min). To the crude extract was added enough ammonium sulfate to give a 50% saturated solution. The resulting precipitated proteins were discarded and additional ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant with slow stirring to 75% saturation. The precipitates were recovered by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 30 min), dissolved in minimal amount of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) (buffer S), and subjected to dialysis three times against 5 liters of buffer S for 4 h. This dialyzed fraction was again centrifuged (13,000 × gfor 20 min) to obtain clear supernatant. A 50–75% ammonium sulfate fraction was applied to a column (5 × 16 cm) of Cibacron blue 3GA dye resin that had been equilibrated with buffer S. The column was washed with buffer S containing 0.12 m NaCl until the absorbance (280 nm) dropped to the baseline. Then the column was eluted with the buffer S containing 0.7 m NaCl. Fractions of 10 ml were collected at a rate of 30 ml/h. To the active fractions pooled from the Cibacron blue 3GA dye resin were added ammonium sulfate with slow stirring to give a 1.0 msolution of ammonium sulfate. This was loaded onto a column (3 × 7 cm) of phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B, pre-equilibrated with buffer S containing 1.0 m ammonium sulfate. The column was developed with 150 ml of a linear gradient (1.0–0 m) of ammonium sulfate dissolved in buffer S. The column was further eluted with buffer S. Fractions of 5 ml were collected at a rate of 30 ml/h. Active fractions from the phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column were combined and applied to a column (1.5 × 15 cm) of methotrexate-agarose pre-equilibrated with buffer S. The column was developed with 60 ml of a linear gradient (0–0.7 m) of NaCl dissolved in buffer S. Then the column was further eluted with buffer S containing 0.7 m NaCl until the absorbance (280 nm) dropped to the baseline. Fractions of 4 ml were collected at a rate of 30 ml/h. The active fractions were pooled and concentrated in Centriprep-10 (Green Base:M r cut-off = 10,000; Amicon) down to 1 ml, which was further concentrated to 200 μl by Centricon-10 filter (Amicon). To reduce the possible irreversible binding of proteins, methotrexate-agarose was subjected to pre-use treatment as follows: liver concentrate (5 g) was dissolved in 50 ml of 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.5) and centrifuged to obtain clear supernatant. Then 20 ml of gel cake was slurried in the clarified liver extract and mixed gently by shaking for 20 min. The top layer was decanted and the gel cake washed with 100 ml of folic acid solution (1 mg/ml in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.5) followed by 100 ml of 0.5 n NaCl. The methotrexate-purified enzyme concentrate was subjected to Superdex 200 HR 10/30 FPLC column chromatography. The column was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 0.15m NaCl at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min and calibrated with blue dextran 2000 (for void volume), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and lysozyme (14.3 kDa). Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. A 5-μg aliquot of purified epimerase was subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) as described previously (21Matsudaira P. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press, San Diego1993Google Scholar). Protein was visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The N-terminal amino acid sequence was analyzed using a protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Model 476A) at the Korea Basic Science Institute (Daejon, Korea). The sequence was verified independently using another protein sequencer (Milligen 6600B). Two degenerate primers were synthesized based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the epimerase: EP1, 5′-GCICARCCIGCIGCIATYATYCGIAT-3′; EP2, 5′-ATNCCRATRAANGTRCG-3′ (I = inosine; R = A + G; Y = C + T; N = A + C + G + T). Other specific primers used are as follows: EP3, 5′-ATAAAGAACCTTCGTTTG-3′; EP4, 5′-CGCAAACGAAGGTTCTTT-3′; EP5, 5′-CTGCTAAAAGCACAACTC-3′; EP6, 5′-AGAACGGAACTGGCTTTCTG-3′; GT11R (λgt11 reverse), 5′-CACCAGACCAACTGGTAATG-3′. Polymerase chain reaction was performed as described (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method (22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52237) Google Scholar) using the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit, according to the supplier's protocol. Uniformly radiolabeled RNA probe of antisense strand for Southern blot analysis was prepared by in vitrotranscription as recommended in Protocols and Applications Guide from Promega Corp. Southern analysis was performed as described (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with some modifications. The digested phage DNA run on the gel was transferred onto a nylon membrane by capillary action (23Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21351) Google Scholar) and cross-linked by UV irradiation (Stratalinker™ 1800). The blot was hybridized at 50 °C in hybridization buffer (150 mm sodium phosphate, 250 mm NaCl, 50% formamide, 10% polyethylene glycol, 1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 2 × Denhardts) and the membrane was washed with the washing solution (0.1 × SSC, 5 mm sodium phosphate, 1% SDS, 0.02% sodium pyrophosphate).E. coli Gene Mapping Membrane was hybridized in the same way as above. Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211784) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Protein of column chromatography fractions was monitored by measuring absorbance at 280 nm. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was done as described by Hames (25Hames B.D. Hames B.D. Rickwood D. Gel Electrophoresis of Proteins: A Practical Approach. IRL Press Limited, Oxford, England1981: 1-91Google Scholar). Protein sequence homology comparison was performed by the Blast program (via the NCBI BLAST E-mail server, National Institutes of Health). A new procedure for the epimerase assay has been developed by the use of a reversed-phase HPLC column equipped with a fluorescence detection system. After epimerization reaction, the substrate (H2NTP) and the product (H2MTP) are oxidized and dephosphorylated to give d-neopterin andl-monapterin, respectively. Complete baseline separation ofl-monapterin from d-neopterin was achieved in a Whatmann Partisil 5 ODS-3 column with water as a mobile phase (Fig.2). d-Neopterin eluted at 7.2 min andl-monapterin about 3 min later at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Slight enhancement in separation was achieved by incorporating boric acid (0.5% (w/v), pH 4.7) or cupric sulfate (4 mm)/d-phenylalanine (8 mm) in the mobile phase (4Klein R. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, standard assay was routinely performed without these additives. Since fluctuations were observed in the retention times, comparison of the retention time with that of standards alone was not accurate for identifying the compound. Therefore a spiking test was performed with authentic compound. The standard d-neopterin orl-monapterin, indeed, coeluted with the correspondingd-neopterin or l-monapterin from the reaction mixture, respectively (data not shown). The purification scheme included ammonium sulfate fractionation of crude extract followed by chromatography on Cibacron blue 3GA, phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B, methotrexate-agarose, and Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column. The most effective step was methotrexate-agarose column chromatography which eliminated most of the contaminating proteins (Fig. 3). Final purification was achieved by gel filtration on Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column, which gave one peak of the epimerase activity coincident with a major protein peak (data not shown). This purification scheme resulted in the isolation of an essentially homogeneous enzyme as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3). A summary of the purification is shown in Table I. Overall, the epimerase was purified 954-fold over the crude extract with an activity yield of 5.4% to a final specific activity of 505 unit/mg.Table IPurification of epimerasePurification stepProteinActivitySpecific activityRecoveryPurificationmgnmol H 2 MTP/minunit/mg%-foldCrude extract35,21718,6470.5301001Ammonium sulfate (50–75%)3,9404,1101.04322.01.97Cibacron blue 3GA-agarose9132,9363.21515.76.07Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B602,26537.7312.171.3Methotrexate-agarose3.41,6604848.90914Superdex 200 HR2.01,0105055.42954 Open table in a new tab The molecular mass of the epimerase was determined on Superdex 200 HR 10/30 FPLC column with standard calibrator proteins including lysozyme (14.3 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa). Epimerase activity eluted at a position consistent with a molecular mass of 82.6 kDa (data not shown). This was confirmed using another gel filtration in HPLC (Protein Pak 125, Waters). This compares favorably with earlier determinations of 87–89 (11Heine M.C. Brown G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 411: 236-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and 88 (7Blau N. Steinerstauch P. Redweik U. Pfister K. Schoedon G. Kierat L. Niederwieser A. Curtius H.-C. Blau N. Unconjugated Pterins and Related Biogenic Amines. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin, Germany1987: 105-115Google Scholar) kDa. However, the minimum subunit molecular mass of the epimerase was 13.7 kDa (Fig. 3). This value is in close agreement with the molecular mass (13,993 Da) deduced from the open reading frame of the cloned epimerase gene. The N-terminal sequence of the epimerase subunit was determined by microsequencing. A 20-amino acid sequence from the N terminus is presented in Fig.4. It showed no homology with the sequences of isomerase or any other enzymes in GenBank/EMBL data bases, indicating that it is a novel sequence. The gene encoding the epimerase was cloned by the PCR approach as follows. Since there was no other information available on the epimerase gene except the N-terminal amino acid sequence, we first cloned the N terminus DNA of the epimerase gene by PCR amplification with two degenerate primers (EP1 and EP2) designed based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence (Fig. 4). The PCR performed on E. coli chromosomal DNA produced a 59-bp band corresponding to the size of 20 amino acids. This fragment was cloned into pBSTA and the sequence was determined. The 59-bp DNA indeed contained amino acid sequences identical with the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the epimerase. Based on this DNA sequence, two gene-specific primers, sense primer EP3 and antisense primer EP4, were designed for cloning 5′-upstream and 3′-downstream DNA. To obtain the 5′-upstream portion, the first PCR was performed with EP2 and GT11R primers using the DNA prepared from E. coligenomic library (λgt11) as a template. The amplified product was then subjected to the second PCR using the sequence-specific primer (EP4 and GT11R primer) to obtain a DNA fragment with increased specificity. A prominent DNA band of about 200 bp was obtained and cloned into pBSTA for sequencing. Analysis of the sequence revealed that this 200-bp DNA contained 1–9 residues of the N-terminal amino acid sequence as well as an initiation codon (ATG) and a presumed ribosomal binding site. To obtain the 3′-downstream portion, the same PCR process was employed, except that the degenerate primer (EP1) and sequence-specific primer (EP3) were used. Three prominent DNA bands were obtained and each fragment was cloned into pBSTA for DNA sequencing. Analyses of both terminal regions of the three fragments revealed that only the 1.2-kb DNA fragment contained the amino acid sequence corresponding to 15–20 residues of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the epimerase and open reading frame that stretched to 339 bp downstream. Next, we linked the 5′-upstream and 3′-downstream DNA sequences and found an open reading frame of 360 bp encoding a polypeptide of 120 amino acid residues. The deduced molecular mass was 13,993 Da in close agreement with the 13.7 kDa determined by SDS-PAGE of the purified epimerase. These results indicated that the entire nucleotide sequence for the epimerase gene was obtained. To obtain the DNA fragment covering the entire epimerase gene, the specific sense primer (EP5) and antisense primer (EP6) were designed, based on the linked DNA sequence. The PCR with EP5 and EP6 produced the DNA fragment of 0.6 kb, which was cloned into pBSTA to generate pEPIFL. Then we examined the specific activity of the epimerase in DH5α cells carrying pEPIFL. When the lysates of DH5α cells were assayed for the epimerase activity, there was 2.8-fold more epimerase activity in cells transformed with pEPIFL than those transformed with pBluescript control (Fig. 7). This indicates we successfully cloned the epimerase gene. Three factors led us to clone the epimerase gene from the Kohara's genomic library of E. coli: (i) to obtain DNA containing more of distal 5′ and 3′ regions besides open reading frame; (ii) to compare the DNA sequence obtained from PCR with that from the chromosomal DNA, as there is frequently PCR errors; and (iii) to establish the location of the gene on E. coli genome. First, when the radiolabeled RNA probe prepared from the 0.6-kb insert of a plasmid pEPIFL was hybridized to E. coli gene mapping membrane, numbers 405 and 406 were found to be the positive clones. The DNA of Kohara's phage clone 406 was subjected to Southern hybridization analysis. The epimerase gene was located within the 2.3-kb BamHI-EcoRI segment of phage clone 406 DNA (Fig. 5). To further map the location and determine the direction of transcription, the 2.3-kbBamHI-EcoRI fragment was subcloned into pBluescript II KS, yielding pMPS. It was then analyzed for restriction sites, EcoRV and MluI, and the location of the gene is marked by the arrow in Fig. 5. Next, we determined the entire nucleotide sequence of the epimerase gene in pMPS using T7 primer and the primers used for the PCR cloning. Fig. 6 shows the entire nucleotide sequence of the gene that encodes the epimerase. There was no difference between the sequence of pMPS and that obtained from PCR. We again examined an enhancement in the activity of the epimerase in pMPS-transformed DH5α cells. Surprisingly, the cell had 300-fold more activity than the cells transformed with pBluescript control (Fig.7). Also, there was a prominent increase in 14-kDa protein band in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 8). These results again confirm the successful cloning and overexpression of the epimerase. Although pMPS and pEPIFL are identical in coding regions, pMPS has some additional 5′ and 3′ sequences which may account for the higher level of the epimerase activity (Fig. 7). To narrow down the positive regulatory elements, extra 5′ region (−130 to −102) of pMPS has been deleted and the epimerase activity was compared with that from pMPS. There was no significant difference in the activity between the 5′-deleted pMPS and intact pMPS. This suggests strongly a positive regulatory role of the 3′ end downstream sequence on the overexpression of the epimerase gene. Despite the ubiquitous distribution of polyhydroxypropyl-pterins in nature, much of the exact stereoisomerism and their implicated roles have not been elucidated completely. Monapterin has been gaining wide attention regarding its nature and its biological role in various organisms. It has been found in human, bovine, and rat retina (26Gerding H. Cremer-Bartels G. Hanneken L. Krause K. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1989; 370: 383Google Scholar) as well as in human urine. In patients with retinitis pigmentosa, which is a progressive dystrophic disease of rod-photoreceptor cells of the retina, monapterin was significantly decreased in lymphocytes and erythrocytes (27Cremer-Bartels G. Gerding H. Gerlach W. Gremm W. Pfleiderer W. Wachter H. Blair J.A. Biochemical and Clinical Aspects of Pteridines. 5. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1987: 359-364Google Scholar). So far the function of monapterin in humans is unknown. Its role as a protective pigment against light damage has been suggested (28Hanneken L. Cremer-Bartels G. Gerding H. Krause K. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1989; 370: 384Google Scholar). Recently, the exact stereochemistry of natural monapterins has been determined by chiral HPLC as well as by measurements of their circular dichroism spectra (3Ogiwara S. Nagatsu T. Teradaira R. Fujita K. Sugimoto T. Tetrahedron Lett. 1992; 33: 1341-1342Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 4Klein R. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Those present in human urine were found to bed-monapterin, while those present in E. coli andPseudomonas are l-monapterin. Although the function of l-monapterin has been suggested as a cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase in Pseudomonas (6Guroff G. Rhoads C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 142-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar),l-monapterin has no known function in E. coli. To further understand the function and the biosynthesis ofl-monapterin in E. coli, the preparation of highly purified epimerase that is enzymatically fully active is required. However, preparations of the epimerase have suffered from limited purity and low yields until now. The epimerase, completely purified here, is the first to be purified and microsequenced among the many enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of pteridines in E. coli other than those committed toward folic acid biosynthesis. Overall, 954-fold purification was achieved with 5.4% recovery. This compared well with earlier partial purifications: Heine and Brown (11Heine M.C. Brown G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 411: 236-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), purification of 7.5-fold, recovery of 6.2%; Blau et al.(7Blau N. Steinerstauch P. Redweik U. Pfister K. Schoedon G. Kierat L. Niederwieser A. Curtius H.-C. Blau N. Unconjugated Pterins and Related Biogenic Amines. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin, Germany1987: 105-115Google Scholar), purification of 53-fold, recovery of 0.35%. One of the unique findings made from this complete purification was the multimeric nature of the epimerase. Taken with the native molecular mass, 82.6 kDa, estimated from gel filtration chromatography, the value of 13.7 kDa for the denatured enzyme and 13,993 Da for predicted molecular mass suggest that the epimerase is a hexamer of identical polypeptides. It is interesting to note that 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase, a key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway ofl-tetrahydrobiopterin, is a hexamer of identical subunits (31Nar H. Huber R. Heizmann C.W. Thöny B. Bürgisser D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1255-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). 6-Pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase (EC 4.6.1.10) also acts on H2NTP like the epimerase. Based on the N-terminal amino acid sequences presented here (Fig. 4), the gene encoding the H2NTP epimerase was cloned and functionally expressed. The cloned gene contained one open reading frame encoding 120 amino acid residues and its expression increased the epimerase activity as well as the amount of protein corresponding to the deduced molecular mass (13,993 Da) in SDS-PAGE. The predicted N-terminal amino acid sequence matched perfectly with that determined by microsequencing of the N terminus of the purified epimerase. The cloning strategy employed here is unique in that only the 20-amino acid sequence from the N terminus was available for PCR and the entire gene sequence was deduced by linking the sequences of the 5′ and 3′ DNA fragments from two separate PCRs. This approach is likely to be very useful in cloning the genes that encode the proteins in a short time, provided that the N-terminal amino acid sequences are available. The problems that may arise from the PCR cloning can be solved as follows: (i) the PCR error can be reduced by using thermostable DNA polymerase with high fidelity and by determining and comparing the nucleotide sequences of multiple subclones. (ii) The absence of the native promoter may be circumvented by utilizing the exogenous promoter (e.g. T7 promoter) and E. coli strain that expresses T7 RNA polymerase (e.g. BL21(DE3)pLysS). No significant sequence homology with other epimerase was found when GenBank/EMBL data bases were searched for homology with the epimerase gene. This suggests that it may be the first enzyme of its type to be cloned. Also, we could not find in the epimerase gene any potential pterin-binding domain which is conserved in aromatic acid hydroxylases and required for pterins to act as coenzymes (29Jennings I.G. Kemp B.E. Cotton R.G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5734-5738Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 30Zhao G. Xia T. Song J. Jensen R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1366-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The similarity between l-tetrahydromonapterin fromPseudomonas and l-tetrahydrobiopterin from the human liver is that both act as a cofactor for the phenylalanine hydroxylase (EC 1.14.16.1) and neither is an efficient precursor of the pteridine moiety of folate (1Jones T.H.D. Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3989-3997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since these compounds are not involved directly in the biosynthetic pathway of folic acid, their presence may be mainly for use in hydroxylation reactions. However, such oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of phenylalanine to tyrosine does not occur in E. coli and these two amino acids are made independently from the common precursor (prephenic acid) in this organism. Therefore the function of l-monapterin and its reduced forms in E. coli must be something other than being involved in the hydroxylation reactions. In E. coli, the epimerase may function as a regulator system for folic acid biosynthesis. Whiled-erythro-dihydroneopterin, which is generated from H2NTP, is a good substrate for dihydroneopterin aldolase and greater portion of H2NTP may enter folate pathway, l-threo-dihydromonapterin which is made after the epimerization is still an efficient substrate (32Jones T.H.D. Reynolds J.J. Brown G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1964; 17: 486Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 33Mathis J.B. Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3015-3025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and provide a shunt for H2NTP pool, thus regulating the level of folate. Also, monapterin or its derivative may play a role related to scavenging of toxic radicals generated during monooxygenase reactions in addition to the role in cell proliferation (10Wachter H. Hausen A. Reider E. Schweiger M. Naturwissenschaften. 1980; 67: 610-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Heine M.C. Brown G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 411: 236-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Once the mutant lacking this epimerase gene is obtained, the absolute requirements for l-monapterin or its derivatives can be determined and we will be a step closer to elucidating the biological function of l-monapterin in E. coli.

Deletion mapping analysis of the carboxyl-terminal region of the β-subunit protein revealed that the terminal 18 amino acid residues (positions 571–588) are dispensable for the replicase reaction. Subsequent deletions up to the Ala-565 residue reduced the RNA polymerizing activity of the replicase in vivo but increased it in vitro. The mutant replicases with enhancedin vitro RNA polymerizing activity were found to have relaxed template specificity for ribosomal RNAs and cellular RNAs as well as Qβ RNA. Deletions beyond the Ile-564 residue abolished both the RNA polymerizing activity and the binding ability to midivariant (MDV)-poly(+) RNA, a derivative of a natural template for Qβ replicase, MDV-1 RNA.

With the development of modern gene technology, it became feasible to analyze the relationships between the structures and functions of gene products. In the case of RNA coliphages, the complete nucleotide sequences of representative phage genomes were determined (1Fiers W. Contreras R. Duerinck F. Haegeman G. Iserentant D. Merregaert J. Min Jou W.

Hirose T. Inayama S. Hirashima A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6205-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and analysis of the structure of each gene also became possible. In attempts to clarify the functional domain of the polymerases, several polymerase genes have been extensively characterized. An RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNA replicase) of RNA coliphage Qβ consists of four subunits. Three of them are host-derived proteins (ribosomal protein S1, and protein elongation factors, EF-Tu and EF-Ts) (5Blumenthal T. Carmichael G.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 525-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Only the β-subunit, which is composed of 588 amino acid residues, is encoded by phage RNA. The central region of the β-subunit is well conserved in RNA coliphages, and this region is thought to contain common structural features for such as the assembly of the subunits and catalysis for RNA synthesis (6Mills D.R. Priano C. DiMauro P. Binderow B.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 205: 751-764Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A sequence motif, Gly-Asp-Asp, which has been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of many viruses and is considered to be the active site for polymerization (7Agros P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9909-9916Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 8Poch O. Sauvaget I. Delarue M. Tordo N. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3867-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar), is located in the central part of the β-sububit protein (9Inokuchi Y. Hirashima A. J. Biochem. 1990; 108: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Recently, this motif sequence of the Qβ and polio virus 3Dpol proteins was found to take part in the binding of metal ions necessary for RNA polymerization (10Inokuchi Y. Kajitani M. Hirashima A. J. Biochem. 1994; 116: 1275-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 11Jablonsky S.A. Morrow C.D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Qβ replicase can specifically transcribe in vitro the Qβ RNA as well as the RNA from closely related phages (5Blumenthal T. Carmichael G.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 525-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). S1 and another host protein, HF-I (12Franze de Fernandez M.T. Eoyang L. August J.T. Nature. 1968; 219: 588-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), are required for the recognition of only Qβ viral plus-strand RNA as a template. In contrast, Qβ replicase lacking S1 and HF-I transcribes poly(rC), MDV-1 RNA, and Qβ minus-strand RNA, as does the holoenzyme of Qβ replicase (5Blumenthal T. Carmichael G.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 525-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). RNA replicases from phages MS2, GA, and SP share the host subunits of Qβ replicase except for HF-I, but they have the different template specificity. Therefore, it is reasonable to think that some factor(s) determining the enzyme specificity must be present in the β-subunit. The β-subunit proteins of MS2 and GA replicases are approximately 10% shorter than those of Qβ and SP replicases, with most of the extra amino acids being located in the carboxyl-terminal region (4Inokuchi Y. Jacobson A.B. Hirose T. Inayama S. Hirashima A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6205-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the carboxyl termini of the β-subunit are more divergent in sequence (Fig. 1). It is therefore likely that this region may contribute to template discrimination.Figure 4Northern blot analysis of RNAs from cells infected with phage Qβsus51. Phage Qβsus51 was introduced intoE. coli 594/F′ lacI q cells carrying pUC8 (lanes c and d), pRQ1-DA565 (eand f), pRQ1-DS567 (g and h), or pRQ1 (i and j) and incubated for another 20 min (c, e, g, and i) or 40 min (d, f, h, and j).Lane b represents mock infection of cells carrying pUC8. Five-μg samples of RNAs were applied to the gel, except for inlane a, where 12 μg of Qβ phage RNA was applied. 16 and 23 S rRNAs of E. coli MRE600 were electrophoresed in a lane on the gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and their positions were determined by cutting the lane of the membrane and staining it with methylene blue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 1Amino acid sequence similarity of the carboxyl-terminal region of the β-subunit protein among MS2, GA, Qβ, and SP replicase.

The carboxyl-terminal 18 amino acid residues were found to be dispensable for the replicase reaction, but a larger deletion made the enzyme defective. Escherichia coliA/λ (sup pro/F+) and BE110 (sup + rel-1 T2r tonA22 phoA4 Hfr) were used as indicators. E. coli594/F′ lacI q (sup + gal Strr recA44/F′lacI q lac + proAB) was used as a recipient for transformation and for growing phages. Phage Qβsus51 was described previously (13Inokuchi Y. Hirashima A. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3946-3949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pRQ1, which contains the wild-type β-subunit gene of Qβ replicase, was used to construct plasmids carrying various sizes of the replicase gene lacking the 3′-terminal region. Plasmid pUC-MDV-LR carrying the segment corresponding to MDV-poly(+) RNA was described previously (10Inokuchi Y. Kajitani M. Hirashima A. J. Biochem. 1994; 116: 1275-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). MDV-poly(+) RNA is 244 nucleotides long and is a derivative of naturally occurring MDV-1(+) RNA (14Lizard P.M. Guerra C.E. Lomeli H. Tussie-Luna I. Kramer F.R. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1197-1202Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar), for which Qβ replicase exhibits strong template activity. Plasmid ZpQβ-32 (15Taniguchi T. Palmieri M. Weissmann C. Nature. 1978; 274: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) was provided by C. Weissmann. Poly(rC) and DNase I were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. [γ-32P]ATP, [α-32P]dCTP, [α-32P]GTP, and [α-32P]UTP were obtained from Amersham Corp. Restriction endonucleases were purchased from TaKaRa Shuzo. AmpliTaq DNA polymerase was from Perkin-Elmer. The 16 and 23 S ribosomal RNAs ofE. coli MRE600 were from Boehringer Mannheim. Plasmids carrying the β-subunit gene, of which the 3′-terminal end was shortened to various extents, were constructed using the polymerase chain reaction method. Oligonucleotide RQ1-f2 has a nucleotide sequence corresponding to positions 3328–3351 of the Qβ cDNA sequence including the cleavage site for the restriction enzyme, XhoI, and was used as a forward primer (Table I). The oligonucleotides listed in Table I were used as reverse primers, containing an artificial stop signal leading to premature termination of β-subunit protein synthesis and having the site for BglII for inserting the DNA fragment into the vector plasmid. Amplification of the DNA fragments was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amplified DNA fragments were digested with XhoI and BglII and then ligated to plasmid pVAR-AD6 DNA (9Inokuchi Y. Hirashima A. J. Biochem. 1990; 108: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), which harbors the β-subunit gene lacking the 3′-terminal part and was previously cleaved withXhoI and BamHI. The nucleotide sequences of the amplified DNA regions were analyzed by the chain termination method (16Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Open table in a new tab E. coli 594/F′lacI q cells carrying the plasmids were grown at 37 °C in YT broth (0.8% tryptone (Difco), 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% sodium chloride) containing 10 mm CaCl2to a cell density of 3 × 108 cells/ml, at which time phage Qβsus51, which is defective in the β-subunit gene, was added at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1. After 10 min at 37 °C, the cells were spun down and resuspended in an equal volume of YT broth. The cell suspension was then diluted 104-fold with YT broth containing 2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the incubation was continued at 37 °C for 90 min, at which time chloroform was added. An aliquot (100 μl), after appropriate dilution, was immediately mixed with a large excess of a stationary culture of E. coli A/λ or BE110 and then plated onto a YT broth-agar plate. E. coli 594/F′lacI q cells carrying the plasmids were grown in 5 ml of YT broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin to a cell density of 2 × 108 cells/ml, at which time 2 mm(final concentration) of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the medium, and the incubation was continued for another hour. Cell lysates were prepared according to Ball and Kaesberg (17Ball L.A. Kaesberg P. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 74: 547-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Aliquots (5 μl) of the lysates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to demonstrate that a similar amount of β-subunit protein was present in each lysate (Fig. 2). For the gel retardation assay, the lysates were centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were used. The wild-type and mutant polymerase activities were measured using poly(rC), MDV-poly(+) RNA, or Qβ RNA as described previously (10Inokuchi Y. Kajitani M. Hirashima A. J. Biochem. 1994; 116: 1275-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. The standard reaction mixtures (50 μl) each contained 125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 25 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm phosphoenol pyruvate, 10 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, 74 units/ml DNase I, 10 μg/ml rifampicin, and 5 μl of cell lysate. For the poly(rG) experiment, the mixture also included 0.4 mmGTP, 20 μg/ml poly(rC), and 740 kBq/ml [α-32P]GTP. The MDV-poly RNA or Qβ RNA reaction mixture contained 0.8 mm each ATP, CTP, and GTP, 0.1 mm UTP, 20 μg/ml MDV-poly(+) RNA or 68 μg/ml Qβ RNA, and 1.48 MBq/ml [α-32P]UTP. Incubation was performed at 35 °C for 15 min (MDV-poly RNA polymerase assay) or at 37 °C for 60 min (Qβ RNA polymerase assay). Aliquots (10 μl) of the mixtures were applied to 3MM Whatman filter paper discs. Incorporated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting (10Inokuchi Y. Kajitani M. Hirashima A. J. Biochem. 1994; 116: 1275-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In control reactions, 100 ng of purified Qβ replicase was exogeneously added to the lysates of host cells carrying pUC8. From the control assay results, it was determined that 5 μl of the lysates of cells carrying pRQ1 contained the equivalent of 271 ng (Qβ RNA polymerase activity) or 247 ng (MDV-poly RNA polymerase activity) of pure Qβ replicase. In this paper, MDV-poly(+) RNA represents an RNA that was transcribed from pUC-MDV-LR DNA by T7 RNA polymerase in vitro. E. coli 594/F′lacI q cells were grown and infected as described under “In Vivo Complementation Analysis” except that the phage was added at a multiplicity of infection of 3. After 10 min at 37 °C, the cells were spun down and resuspended in an equal volume of YT broth containing 2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and then the incubation was continued for the indicated times. RNAs were extracted with phenol and precipitated with ethanol in the presence of 0.8m LiCl. The pellets were washed twice with 70% ethanol and then dissolved in distilled water. A 5-μg sample of the extracted RNA was denatured with glyoxal and dimethyl sulfoxide and then applied to a 1.0% agarose gel. Electrophoresis, transfer to a nylon membrane (Biodyne A, Pall Ultrafine Corp.), and hybridization were performed as described previously (13Inokuchi Y. Hirashima A. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3946-3949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 1.2-kilobase pair XhoI-BamHI fragment of ZpQβ-32 DNA, which lies within the maturation (A2) gene, was labeled using E. coli DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment), random oligonucleotide primers (nonamers), and [α-32P]dCTP and then was used as the hybridization probe to detect Qβ viral RNA. The 5′-end of MDV-poly(+) RNA was labeled as described previously (10Inokuchi Y. Kajitani M. Hirashima A. J. Biochem. 1994; 116: 1275-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Ice-cold binding mixture (15 μl) comprised 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm dithioerythritol, 5% glycerol, 1.5 × 10−2 pmol of 32P-end-labeled MDV-poly(+) RNA, and 1 μl of various cell lysate supernatants. After 20 min of incubation at 5 °C, samples (10 μl) were applied to a 5% polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C as described by Werner (18Werner M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5832-5838Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The gel was then dried and subjected to autoradiography. The wild-type and DS567 replicases were purified from E. coli 594/F′lacI q cells carrying the plasmids according to Kajitani and Ishihama (19Kajitani M. Ishihama A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For the Qβ RNA polymerase assay, the standard reaction mixtures (50 μl) each contained 80 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 12 mm MgCl2, 12 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.8 mm each ATP, CTP, and GTP, 0.1 mm UTP, 74 kBq of [α-32P]UTP, and 200 ng of the replicase. Incubation was performed at 37 °C for 15 min. Incorporated radioactivity was determined as described under “Assay for Polymerase Activities Using Cell Lysates.” We first investigated whether or not the mutated β-subunit proteins could complement the activity of phage Qβsus51 replicase, an amber mutant of the β-subunit gene. E. coli 594/F′lacI q cells carrying the mutant plasmids were infected with phage Qβsus51, and then proliferation of the phage in the cells was examined. As shown in Fig. 3 A, as long as the amino acid deletion was less than 19 residues from the carboxyl-terminal end of the β-subunit protein, cells carrying each plasmid, pRQ1-DL585, -DQ578, -DV576, -DA572, and -DV570, produced as many progeny phages as did cells carrying the wild-type plasmid pRQ1 (Fig. 3 A). However, when the deletion extended beyond the Val-570 residue, progeny production steadily decreased. Furthermore, when the deletion reached the Ile-564 residue, the phage production in cells carrying larger deletion plasmids was abolished completely. To investigate the cause of the poor phage production in cells carrying mutant plasmids (Fig.3 A), we extracted RNAs from phage Qβsus51-infected cells, and subjected the RNAs to Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 4, the 32P-labeled Qβ cDNA probe strongly hybridized with Qβ phage RNA (Fig. 4,lane a) but did not hybridize with cellular RNAs at all (Fig. 4, lane b), demonstrating that this cDNA probe specifically detected Qβ viral RNA. In the control cells carrying pRQ1, viral RNA synthesis occurred at 20 min after the Qβsus51 infection, and many viral RNAs accumulated during another 20 min of incubation (Fig. 4, lanes i and j). On the other hand, in the cells carrying plasmid pRQ1-DA565 or -DS567, in which phage production was greatly reduced (Fig. 3 A), viral RNA was found only a little even at 40 min after the infection (Fig. 4,lanes e–h). Since viral RNA synthesis did not occur in the cells carrying pUC8 (Fig. 4, lanes c and d), the residual viral RNA syntheses found in the cells carrying the mutant plasmids were not due to the invading phage genomes. Also seen were the hybridization signals at the positions near to those of 16 and 23 S rRNAs (Fig. 4, lanes f and h–j). These signals may represent the premature transcripts of Qβ RNA because such small RNAs were observed in Qβ RNA-dependent RNA synthesis by wild-type or DS567 replicase (see Fig.5 C). Using lysates from cells carrying various mutant plasmids described above, we examined Qβ RNA-dependent RNA polymerizing activity. As shown in Fig. 3 B, as long as the amino acid deletion was less than 18 residues, the polymerizing activity of lysates from the cells carrying the mutant plasmid was similar to that of the control cell lysate. However, when the deletion extended beyond the Val-570 residue of the β-subunit, despite the fact that the cells expressing the mutant replicases supported poor growth of the invading Qβsus51 phage (Fig. 3 A), lysates of the cells carrying pRQ1-DR569, -DS568, -DS567, or -DC566 synthesized much more RNA than did lysate from cells harboring pRQ1. These results suggest that those deletions did not affect the polymerizing activity of the replicase. When 25 or more amino acids were deleted from the carboxyl terminus of the β-subunit protein, polymerizing activity was abolished. In addition, lysates of cells carrying pUC8 exhibited little RNA polymerizing activity. To further analyze the characterization of the mutant replicase, we purified DS567 replicase and compared the Qβ RNA-dependent RNA synthesis by wild-type and DS567 replicases. As shown in Fig. 5 A, when 16 ng of the template Qβ RNA was added to the reaction mixture, DS567 replicase synthesized RNA in a similar manner and amount to wild-type replicase. However, when 1 μg of the template RNA was incubated with DS567 replicase, incorporation of [32P]UTPs was about 2-fold of that using wild-type replicase. Fig. 5 B shows the relationships between Qβ RNA-dependent synthesis and the molar ratio of Qβ RNA to replicase (Qβ RNA/replicase). Since Qβ replicase binds to Qβ RNA at three sites (5Blumenthal T. Carmichael G.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 525-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), an excess amount of Qβ RNA causes binding of Qβ replicase to two or three Qβ RNA molecules, resulting in inhibition of Qβ RNA synthesis (20Kondo M. Weissmann C Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 24: 530-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, Qβ RNA-dependent synthesis was found to be maximum at a molar ratio of about 0.3 or 0.5 for the wild-type or DS567 replicase reaction, respectively. When the ratio was higher than 0.5, DS567 replicase synthesized RNA twice as much as wild-type replicase did, which was consistent with the results in Fig. 4 A. When the 32P-labeled RNAs synthesized by wild-type or DS567 replicase at a molar ratio of 0.5 were compared by an agarose gel electrophoresis, most of the 32P-labeled RNAs were found to be similar in size to Qβ viral RNA (Fig. 5 C). These results indicate that the polymerization activity of DS567 replicase did not get damaged and suggest that DS567 replicase had an extra ability to bind to Qβ RNA. It was puzzling that lysates of cells carrying pRQ1-DC566, -DS567, -DS568, and -DR569 exhibited higher polymerizing activity in vitro with the Qβ RNA template but that these cells were unable to support effectively the proliferation of the invading phage, Qβsus51. Taking account of the results in Fig. 5, the mutant replicases are assumed to have more relaxed template specificity than the wild-type replicase, so thereby they neglect Qβ RNA synthesis in cells infected with phage Qβsus51. Therefore, we examined the polymerizing activities of cell lysates using cellular RNAs as templates. As shown in Table II, lysates of cells carrying pRQ1-DC566, -DS567, -DS568, or -DR569 incorporated more [32P]UTPs than the control cell lysates carrying pRQ1 when ribosomal RNA or total cellular RNA was used as template. In contrast, lysates of cells carrying pRQ1-DA572 or -DV576, which exhibited lower Qβ RNA polymerase activity in vitro but supported progeny production in Qβsus51-infected cells, had lower polymerization activity than the control lysate in the cellular RNA-dependent system.Table IICellular RNA-directed RNA synthesis by cell lysates from cells carrying the mutant plasmidsTemplate RNA[32P]UMP incorporated by cell lysates2-aValues are the means ± S.D. for two independent determinations.Vector2-bLysate from cells carrying pUC8.DA565DC566DS567DS568pmolQβ RNA2-cData from Fig. 3 B.0.2 ± <0.118.4 ± 4.550.2 ± 5.670.6 ± 5.446.1 ± 1.6rRNAs2-d16 and 23 S ribosomal RNAs (2 μg) of E. coliMRE600 were used in each reaction.0.1 ± <0.10.2 ± <0.10.8 ± <0.13.0 ± 0.11.8 ± <0.1total RNAs2-eTotal cellular RNAs were extracted from E. coli594/F′ lacI q cells carrying pUC8, and 4 μg of the RNAs were used in each reaction.0.1 ± 0.10.3 ± <0.11.0 ± 0.23.3 ± 0.62.3 ± 0.6DR569DV570DA572DV576Wild type2-fLysate from cells carrying pRQ1.Qβ RNA2-cData from Fig. 3 B.27.2 ± 0.918.1 ± 0.110.5 ± 0.28.2 ± 0.316.2 ± 2.2rRNAs2-d16 and 23 S ribosomal RNAs (2 μg) of E. coliMRE600 were used in each reaction.0.8 ± 0.20.7 ± 0.10.4 ± <0.10.1 ± <0.10.6 ± 0.2total RNAs2-eTotal cellular RNAs were extracted from E. coli594/F′ lacI q cells carrying pUC8, and 4 μg of the RNAs were used in each reaction.0.9 ± 0.10.9 ± 0.20.4 ± 0.10.2 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.62-a Values are the means ± S.D. for two independent determinations.2-b Lysate from cells carrying pUC8.2-c Data from Fig. 3 B.2-d 16 and 23 S ribosomal RNAs (2 μg) of E. coliMRE600 were used in each reaction.2-e Total cellular RNAs were extracted from E. coli594/F′ lacI q cells carrying pUC8, and 4 μg of the RNAs were used in each reaction.2-f Lysate from cells carrying pRQ1. Open table in a new tab To further determine the cause of the difference between the in vivo and in vitro replicase reactions, we compared the template specificity of purified wild-type and DS567 replicases. Qβ replicase transcribes closely related phage RNAs but not other RNAs such as ribosomal RNAs and unrelated phage RNAs (5Blumenthal T. Carmichael G.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 525-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). As shown in TableIII, when SP RNA, a closely related phage RNA to Qβ RNA, was also used as a template, DS567 replicase incorporated more [32P]UTPs than the wild-type replicase, as in the case of Qβ RNA template. DS567 replicase also exhibited much higher RNA polymerizing activity for 16 and 23 S ribosomal RNAs or total cellular RNA as template, confirming the results of Table II. These results indicate that DS567 replicase relaxed specificity for not only Qβ RNA template but also cellular RNA templates.Table IIIComparison of the template specificity between wild-type and DS567 replicasesReplicase[32P]UMP incorporated with a template3-aValues are the means ± S.D. for two independent determinations.

Open table in a new tab Since Qβ replicase lacking S1 and HF-I does not transcribe Qβ RNA but can use MDV-1 RNA and poly(rC) as template, we examined the effects of deletions on MDV-poly RNA and poly(rG) polymerase activities. The MDV-poly(+) RNA-dependent polymerizing activity of cell lysates changed in a similar way to Qβ RNA-dependent polymerizing activity as the amino acid deletion extended into the inner part of the β-subunit protein (Fig. 3 B). When 25 residues were deleted, lysates of cells expressing mutant replicases with larger deletions no longer showed the polymerizing activity. The poly(rC)-dependent polymerizing activity of cell lysates carrying pRQ1-DI564 decreased by 75% compared with the control cell lysates, as in the case of the MDV-poly(+) RNA template (TableIV). Furthermore, replacement of the carboxyl-terminal Ile residue of DI564 replicase with Ala or a chemically similar Leu residue reduced the poly(rG) and MDV-poly(+) RNA polymerizing activities to background levels. These results indicate that the sequence from Ile-564 to Ala-565 of the β-subunit protein is important for both the MDV-poly RNA and poly(rG) polymerase activities.Table IVEffects of amino acid substitutions on MDV-poly RNA and poly(rG) polymerase activitiesCell lysate[32P]UMP or [32P]GMP incorporated with a template4-aValues are the means ± S.D. for two independent determinations.MDV-poly(+) RNApoly(rC)pmolVector4-bLysates of cells carrying pUC8.0.3 ± 0.20.6 ± 0.8DY5630.6 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.1DI56411.3 ± 1.625.6 ± 3.0DA5640.8 ± 0.42.0 ± 1.3DL5642.6 ± 0.64.4 ± 0.4DA56559.0 ± 5.178.8 ± 3.5Wild type4-cLysates of cells carrying pRQ1.83.0 ± 15.196.5 ± 9.54-a Values are the means ± S.D. for two independent determinations.4-b Lysates of cells carrying pUC8.4-c Lysates of cells carrying pRQ1. Open table in a new tab Qβ replicase binds to the central region of MDV-1(+) RNA, in which nucleotides 81–126 are identical with nucleotides 84–129 of Qβ minus-strand RNA (21Nishihara T. Mills D.R. Kramer F.R. J. Biochem. 1983; 93: 669-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To determine whether or not mutant replicases without MDV-poly RNA polymerizing activity can bind to a template, we examined a gel retardation assay using 32P-end-labeled MDV-poly(+) RNA. When the lysates of cells carrying pRQ1-DA565, pRQ1-DC566, or pRQ1 were incubated with [32P]MDV-poly(+) RNA and then electrophoresed on a polyacrylamide gel, the mobility of [32P]MDV-poly(+) RNA was decreased (Fig.6, lanes c and g–i). In contrast, in the case of lysates of cells carrying pRQ1-DI564, which exhibited poor polymerizing activity (Fig. 3 B and Table IV), only a small amount of [32P]MDV-poly(+) RNA migrated slowly (Fig. 6, lane f), indicating that the binding of MDV-poly(+) RNA to DI564 replicase was greatly impaired. Furthermore, in the case of pRQ1-DQ562 or -DY563, a mobility shift was not observed anymore (Fig. 6, lanes d and e). Qβ replicase distinguishes its own Qβ RNA and closely related viral RNAs among natural RNAs. This discrimination involves the recognition of a specific secondary or tertiary structure of the template RNA. Qβ RNA provides the replicase with three binding sites (S-site, the initiation region of the coat gene; M-site, the internal region of the β-subunit gene; and the 3′-terminal region of Qβ RNA) (3ürichMekler, P. (1981) Determination of Nucleotide Sequences of the Bacteriophage Qβ Genome: Organization and Evolution of an RNA Virus.Ph. D. thesis, University of Zürich.Google Scholar). However, little is known about the counterparts of the replicase molecule responsible for the enzyme specificity, such as template recognition or subunit assembly. In this paper, we propose that the carboxyl-terminal part of the β-subunit of Qβ replicase is one of the candidates for functional domains determining the template recognition from the following results. DS567 replicase with deletions of 21 amino acid residues at the carboxyl terminus had a relaxed template specificity for a related phage RNA and cellular RNAs as well as Qβ RNA (Tables II and III, Fig. 5). Furthermore, lysates of cells expressing DR569, DS568, DS567, or DC566 replicase, which showedin vitro higher polymerizing activity with the Qβ RNA template but failed to support progeny production in the cell, exhibited higher polymerizing activity in cellular RNA-dependent synthesis (Table II). In contrast, lysates of cells expressing DA572 or DV576 replicase showed lower polymerizing activity than the control lysate in Qβ RNA or cellular RNA-dependent synthesis (Table II); however, these mutant proteins complemented the activity of phage Qβsus51 replicase (Fig.3 A). These results suggest that in cells infected with phage Qβsus51, a mutant replicase having a more relaxed template specificity than that of wild-type replicase engaged in transcribing cellular RNAs as well as Qβ RNA and accordingly failed to perform the task of polymerizing Qβ RNA, indicating that the accessibility of Qβ replicase to cellular RNAs may be critical for phage growth. DI564 replicase lacking the carboxyl-terminal 24 amino acid residues of the β-subunit protein showed only a little activity in the MDV-poly RNA polymerase assay (Fig. 3 B). On removal of the terminal Ile residue from DI564 replicase, the resulting mutant, DY563, replicase lost the polymerizing activity (Table IV). Furthermore, DI564 replicase showed reduced binding ability to MDV-poly(+) RNA, and DY563 replicase abolished it completely (Fig. 6). These results indicate that the failure of MDV-poly(+) RNA-dependent RNA synthesis by DI564 replicase was due to poor binding of the replicase to the RNA. Therefore, the sequence from Ile-564 to Ala-565 of the β-subunit protein was essential for Qβ replicase to express MDV-poly RNA polymerase activity, particularly for its binding to MDV-poly(+) RNA. The finding that the insertion of a pentapeptide at the Ala-565 residue abolished the MDV-1 RNA polymerizing activity of Qβ replicase (6Mills D.R. Priano C. DiMauro P. Binderow B.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 205: 751-764Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) agrees with our results. Recently, Brown and Gold (22Brown D. Gold L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11558-11562Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) have proposed a three-site model of Qβ replicase, according to which two RNA binding sites, site I on the S1 subunit and site II on EF-Tu, are responsible for RNA binding, and the polymerase-active site on the β-subunit is for RNA synthesis. Site I binds class I RNAs that possess single-stranded regions containing a high fraction of A and C nucleotides such as Qβ plus-strand RNA, and site II binds class II RNAs that have polypyrimidine tracts such as Qβ minus-strand RNA or MDV-1 RNA. According to their model, destruction of site II or removal of EF-Tu from Qβ replicase will result in the replicase without the MDV-1 RNA binding activity. Therefore, the data in Fig. 6 that show the importance of the Ile-564 and Ala-565 residues of the β-subunit protein in MDV-poly(+) RNA binding suggest that site II on EF-Tu interacts with these amino acid residues to form an active Qβ replicase molecule. Our present results indicate that a change in the carboxyl-terminal structure of the β-subunit protein of Qβ replicase could cause relaxation of the template specificity and that this part of the β-subunit is responsible for recognizing MDV-poly(+) RNA. The carboxyl-terminal region of the β-subunit protein is heterologous in RNA coliphages. Phage RNA replicase is thus assumed to have evolved its template specificity in part by altering the carboxyl-terminal structure of the β-subunit and simultaneously by keeping the accessibility of the replicase to cellular RNAs at a low level.

https://openalex.org/W2022573027,"Hb S variants containing Lys-β132 → Ala or Asn substitutions were engineered to evaluate the consequences of the A helix destabilization in the polymerization process. Previous studies suggested that the loss of the Glu-β7-Lys-β132 salt bridge in the recombinant Hb βE6V/E7A could be responsible for the destabilization of the A helix. The recombinant Hb (rHb) S/β132 variants polymerized with an increased delay time as well as decreased maximum absorbance and Hb solubility values similar to that of Hb S. These data indicate that the strength of the donor-acceptor site interaction may be reduced due to an altered conformation of the A helix. The question arises whether this alteration leads to a true inhibition of the polymerization process or to qualitatively different polymers. The oxygen affinity of the β132 mutated rHbs was similar to that of Hb A and S, whereas the cooperativity and effects of organic phosphates were reduced. This could be attributed to modifications in the central cavity due to loss of the positively charged lysine. Since Lys-β132 is involved in the stabilization of the α1-β1 interface, the loss of the β132(H10)-β128(H6) salt bridge may be responsible for the marked thermal instability of the β132 mutated rHbs.

The substitution of valine for the β6 glutamic acid residue in human Hb results in the abnormally low solubility of deoxy-Hb S. Under physiological conditions, sickle Hb aggregates upon deoxygenation to form a gel composed of long helical fibers that deform the erythrocytes and severely diminish their life-span.

Chem. 1985; 260: 8272-8279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that both fibers and crystals are composed of double strands of deoxy-Hb S molecules. The formation of the double strands requires stereochemical contact between complementary surfaces involving specifically Val-β6 and a hydrophobic pocket on an adjacent molecule (lateral contact). The capacity of some Hb variants to facilitate or impair the polymerization process of Hb S is well documented (4Bookchin R. Nagel R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 60: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The use of binary Hb mixtures (Hb X + Hb S) has allowed a mapping of the residues involved in areas of contact in the polymer (5Nagel R.L. Johnson J. Bookchin R.M. Garel M.C. Rosa J. Schiliro G.

Six naturally occurring Hb variants have been described with two mutations on the same β chain, one of them being the Hb S substitution. Among them, Hb S Antilles Val-β6/Ile-23 (6Montplaisir N.

Studies of recombinant Hbs (rHbs) 1The abbreviations used are: rHb, recombinant Hb; C sat, Hb solubility; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol. have shown that in Hb S Antilles the polymer fibers were stabilized at the axial contact by the replacement of Val with the more hydrophobic residue Ile (10Pagnier J. Baudin-Chich V. Lacaze N. Bohn B. Poyart C. Br. J. Haematol. 1990; 74: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We have previously reported studies of the function and polymerization of another rHb, βE6V/E7A (11Lesecq S. Baudin V. Kister J. Marden M.C. Poyart C. Pagnier J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17211-17214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In this rHb, the association of Glu-β6(A3) → Val and Glu-β7(A4) → Ala mutations on the same β chain (rHb βE6V/E7A) results in an apparent decrease of the polymer formation. We therefore postulated that this decrease could be due to an instability of the A helix because of the loss of a salt bridge between the A and H helices, namely between the Glu-β7(A4) and Lys-β132(H10) residues (11Lesecq S. Baudin V. Kister J. Marden M.C. Poyart C. Pagnier J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17211-17214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Modification of the second partner in the salt bridge (Lys-β132(H10)) may also result in its rupture. This residue participates in several contacts at the α1-β1 interface (12Sack J.S. Andrews L.C. Magnus K.A. Hanson J.C. Rubin J. Love W.E. Hemoglobin. 1978; 2: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and might also be involved in the stability of the A helix. We have thus engineered two doubly mutated Hbs in which the Glu-β6(A3) → Val mutation is associated with either Lys-β132(H10) → Ala or Asn substitution (rHbs βE6V/K132A and βE6V/K132N, respectively). We have also engineered the single mutant Hbs Lys-α2β2132(H10) → Ala and Lys-α2β2132(H10) → Asn as controls (rHbs βK132A and βK132N, respectively). The βE6V, βK132A, and βK132N mutations were introduced into the β-globin cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis using synthetic primers (Genset, Paris, France). The mutated β-globin subunits were produced as fusion proteins in Escherichia coli using the expression vector pATPrcIIFXβ (13Bihoreau M.T. Baudin V. Marden M. Lacaze N. Bohn B. Kister J. Schaad O.

The presence of the mutation(s) was confirmed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography of the tryptic digests and amino acid analysis of the abnormal peptides. The purified β-subunits were folded in the presence of cyanhemin and the partner α-subunits (prepared from natural Hb A) to form the tetrameric Hb α2β2 (13Bihoreau M.T. Baudin V. Marden M. Lacaze N.

Fluorescence studies of the rHbs were performed at a concentration of 10 μm on a heme basis in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, using an SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer. Fluorescence spectra were measured in the region for tyrosine and tryptophan emission (for air-equilibrated samples). The heat stability of the Hbs was determined by incubating the recombinant and native Hbs at 65 °C in 10 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 100 μm heme under 1 atm of CO or 1 atm of O2 (16Wajcman H.

Measurements were made at different protein concentrations to study the concentration dependence of the ligand binding kinetics to estimate the dimer-tetramer equilibrium compared with natural Hb A (19Andersen M.E. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4790-4799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For concentrations above 30 μm (on a heme basis), 1-mm optical cuvettes were used. Below 30 μm, 4 × 10 mm cuvettes were used with detection along the 10-mm axis and dissociation at 90° along the 4-mm axis. Kinetics of polymer formation for mutant deoxy-Hbs were carried out in 1.8 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, for different Hb concentrations, following initiation by a temperature jump (0 to 30 °C). The solubility and kinetics of polymerization of the mutated Hb were compared with those of native Hb S. Under these conditions and after a characteristic lag period, the assembly of Hb S into fibers resulted in a cooperative increase in turbidity at 700 nm until a plateau was achieved. The Hb solubility (C sat) was determined by measuring the Hb concentration of the soluble phase after completion of the polymerization process (20Adachi K. Asakura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7765-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Poyart C. Bohn B. Bursaux E. Guesnon P. Nouv. Rev. Fr. Hématol. 1981; 23: 17-25Google Scholar). Molecular graphics models of the deoxy-Hbs βE7A and βK132N were performed starting from the crystallographic coordinates of the deoxy structure of Hb A (file 3HHB, Protein Data Bank, Brookhaven National Laboratory) reported by Fermi et al. (22Fermi G. Perutz M.F. Shaanan B. Fourme R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 174: 159-174Crossref Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Minimization of the potential energy in the mutant and normal Hbs was performed using the CHARMm™ program (version 22) (23Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13963) Google Scholar) with a Silicon Graphics Indigo work station. Holding the rest of the structure constant, the mutated residue was initially minimized by starting with an additional high harmonic constant that was progressively decreased to 0. Reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography of the tryptic digest of the purified mutated fusion proteins βK132A, βK132N, βE6V/K132A, or βE6V/K132N revealed the presence of one or two abnormal peptides. Amino acid analyses of these peptides confirmed the presence of the expected mutation(s). Reassembled tetramers showed visible absorption spectra identical to those of native Hb A and S in dilute solution and liganded forms. The fluorescence intensity is sensitive to the small quantities of apoproteins. The intensity for the rHbs was similar to that for natural Hb A, indicating a correct reconstitution to the holoprotein form. Cellulose acetate electrophoresis and isoelectrofocusing (Fig. 1) of the purified rHbs βK132A, βK132N, βE6V/K132A, and βE6V/K132N showed a single band migrating at isoelectric points of 6.85, 6.85, 7.10, and 7.10, respectively, relative to 6.95 and 7.20 for Hb A and Hb S and 7.40 for the rHb βE6V/E7A. These values are higher than expected for the replacement of the positively charged Lys with Ala or Asn. This may be explained by the location of the β132 residue, which is at least partially buried in the central cavity of the Hb tetramer.Figure 1Isoelectric focusing of rHbs βE6V/K132A (lane 2), βK132A (lane 3), βE6V/K132N (lane 4), and βK132N (lane 5) compared with mixtures of Hbs A and F and Hbs A, A2, and S (lanes 6 and 7) and with the rHb βE6V/E7A (lane 1). Mobilities of the Hbs were determined by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel with a pH gradient ranging from 6.0 to 8.0.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Heat stability of the oxy and carboxy forms of the mutated rHbs was compared with that of the natural Hbs A and S and that of the rHb βE6V/E7A. As shown in Fig. 2, we did not observe significant differences between Hb A and S. The stability of the β132 mutants was dramatically decreased under the same conditions. The doubly mutated rHbs βE6V/K132A and βE6V/K132N were the most unstable, more so than the rHbs containing only the β132 mutation. The rHbs βE7A and βE6V/E7A were the least unstable mutants (Fig.2). The oxygen equilibrium curves (not shown) showed that the oxygen affinity of the rHbs K132N and E6V/K132N was similar to that of native Hb A. When Lys-β132 was replaced with Ala the oxygen affinity was slightly increased (Table I). The cooperativity in ligand binding and the 2,3-diphosphoglycerate effect were decreased for all mutants. Since it is known that the oxygen binding properties of Hb S are similar to those of Hb A, the functional abnormalities could be attributed to the presence of the β132 mutation. CO recombination kinetics for the rHbs (not shown) were similar to those observed for Hb A, indicating that the mutant rHbs retain allosteric function. At low protein concentration, loss of the allosteric form is normally observed due to the increased fraction of dimers. Results at 1 μm indicate that the rHbs do not present a significant increase in the amount of dimers.Table IFunctional studies of the rHbs βK132A, βK132N, βE6V/K132A, and βE6V/K132NHb− 2,3-Diphosphoglyceraten 50+ 2,3-DiphosphoglycerateP 50ΔlogP 501-aShift in P 50 expressed as ΔlogP 50 relative to Hb A.P 50ΔlogP 501-bExpressed as Δlog P 50 ± 2,3-diphosphoglycerate.mm Hgmm HgA4.42.5–2.814.00.50Recombinant βK132A3.5−0.101.9Not determinedRecombinant βK132N4.70.032.110.30.34Recombinant βE6V/K132A3.1−0.151.77.40.38Recombinant βE6V/K132N4.30.011.99.10.33Experimental conditions: 0.05 m bis-Tris buffer, 20 μg/ml catalase, 50 μm EDTA, 60–80 μm heme, 100 mm NaCl, 25 °C, 1 mm 2,3-diphosphoglycerate.

The percentage of MetHb at the end of the oxygen equilibrium curve recording was between 1.5 and 5%. Polymerization of the rHbs βE6V/K132A and βE6V/K132N in the deoxy form was studied in vitro by the temperature jump method and compared with that of the rHb βE6V/E7A and natural Hb S. Fig.3 illustrates the variations of ΔA 700 as a function of time after the temperature jump. Under these conditions, the rHbs βK132A and K132N did not polymerize at all concentrations studied (up to 2.0 g/liter). The kinetic curves of polymerization of the doubly mutated Hbs were sigmoidal, as was observed for native Hb S. The maximum absorbance at 700 nm was lower than for Hb S, whereas the delay time (τ) was longer at all concentrations studied (1.6–3.0 g/liter). A logarithmic plot of the reciprocal of the delay time versus initial Hb concentration (Fig. 4) showed straight lines shifted toward the right for the rHbs βE6V/K132A and βE6V/K132N, indicating longer delay times compared with Hb S and the rHb βE6V/E7A. Plotting the log of the aggregation rate as a function of log C showed straight lines with similar slopes for Hb S and rHb βE6V/E7A on the one hand and for the rHbs βE6V/K132N and βE6V/K132A on the other (Fig.5). The time required to reach maximum polymerization depends on Hb concentration. At equivalent initial concentration that time was longer when the sickle mutation was associated with the β132 mutations than when associated with Glu-β7 → Val. TheC sat values for the double mutants were not significantly different from those of natural Hb S and rHb βE6V/E7A (Fig. 6). For the two double mutants, the aggregation process was reversible in the presence of CO and in ice water.Figure 5Relationship between the log of the rate of polymerization k (s−1) and the log of initial concentration C (g/liter) for deoxy-rHb βE6V/K132A and βE6V/K132N compared with deoxy-Hb S and deoxy-rHb βE6V/E7A. k was calculated as ΔA 700/(final time -τ).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Supernatant Hb concentration at the plateau of polymerization (C sat) for deoxy-rHb βE6V/K132A and βE6V/K132N compared with deoxy-Hb S and deoxy-rHb βE6V/E7A as a function of the initial concentration. TheC sat was determined after centrifugation of the turbid solution at 2500 × g for 30 min at 30 °C under mineral oil. Conditions of polymerization were as described in the Fig. 3 legend.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously demonstrated that the association of the βE7A and βE6V mutations on the same β chain leads to a decreased polymer formation; the Glu-β7(A4) for Ala substitution in human Hb resulted in heat instability and in an increased oxygen affinity of the rHbs βE7A and βE6V/E7A (11Lesecq S. Baudin V. Kister J. Marden M.C. Poyart C. Pagnier J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17211-17214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In human Hbs A and S, Glu-β7(A4) forms an intrachain salt bridge with Lys-β132(H10) in both R- and T-state structures (24Fermi G. Perutz M.F. Philips D.C. Richard F.M. Atlas of Molecular Structure in Biology 2, Haemoglobin and Myoglobin. Clarendon Press, Oxford1981: 20-34Google Scholar). The loss of this salt bridge may modify the conformation of the A helix, which could account for the alteration of the polymerization process. We attributed the increased oxygen affinity of the rHbs βE7A and βE6V/E7A to an increased dissociation of the tetramer into dimers demonstrated by the concentration dependence of the ligand binding kinetics. In the present work we have studied the consequences of modifications of Lys-β132(H10), which also participates in the salt bridge. In contrast with the data obtained with the rHbs βE7A and βE6V/E7A, CO rebinding to the photodissociated β132 mutants did not reveal an increased dissociation into dimers, and the rHbs modified at the β132(H10) site did not exhibit high oxygen affinity (Table I). Note that naturally occurring Hb Yamataga Lys-β132 → Asn is described as having a slightly decreased oxygen affinity (25International Hemoglobin Information Center Hemoglobin. 1996; 20: 215-312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In human deoxy-Hb, the β132 residue interacts with the N-terminal β-chain residues Val-β1(NA1), His-β2(NA2), and Leu-β3(NA3) (12Sack J.S. Andrews L.C. Magnus K.A. Hanson J.C. Rubin J. Love W.E. Hemoglobin. 1978; 2: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Two of these residues participate in the 2,3-diphosphoglycerate binding. The loss of a positive charge when the Lys-β132 is replaced by either Ala or Asn may result in the destabilization of the contacts in the central cavity. These structural modifications are able to prevent or modify the binding of the allosteric effector. Structural crystallographic studies revealed that in both the R- and T-state Lys-β132(H10) is not only linked to Glu-β7(A4) but may also interact with Ala-β128(H6), which is involved in the α1-β1 contacts, and with Gly-β136(H14) located in the central cavity (12Sack J.S. Andrews L.C. Magnus K.A. Hanson J.C. Rubin J. Love W.E. Hemoglobin. 1978; 2: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The known natural substitutions described at these two latter sites are responsible for thermal or isopropyl alcohol instability (25International Hemoglobin Information Center Hemoglobin. 1996; 20: 215-312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rupture of the β7(A4)-β132(H10) salt bridge near the α1-β1 interface and of β132(H10)-β128(H6) that directly participates in the α1-β1 stabilization may induce a heat instability of the mutated tetramers (Fig. 2). Among the three natural β132 mutants, only Hb Cook (Lys-β132 → Thr) has been shown to be slightly unstable (25International Hemoglobin Information Center Hemoglobin. 1996; 20: 215-312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Combinations of Hb S with another α or β chain variant are responsible for a variety of clinical patterns (26Dickerson R.E. Geis I. Hemoglobin: Structure, Function, Evolution, and Pathology. The Benjamin Cummings Publishing Co., Inc., Menlo Park, CA1983: 118-145Google Scholar, 27Benesh R.E. Kwong S. Benesh R. Nature. 1982; 299: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Information on the location of intermolecular contacts in the polymer has been obtained by studying the in vitro and in vivointeractions of Hb S and natural Hb mutants (4Bookchin R. Nagel R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 60: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 5Nagel R.L. Johnson J. Bookchin R.M. Garel M.C. Rosa J. Schiliro G. Wajcman H. Labie D. Moo-penn W. Castro O.

Hb K-Woolwich Lys-β132(H10) → Gln behaves like deoxy-Hb A when interacting with deoxy-Hb S, demonstrating that the β132 residue is not directly involved in the interactions stabilizing the deoxy-Hb S polymer (5Nagel R.L.

Biol. 1981; 150: 557-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our results show that when associated with the sickle mutation on the same β chain, neither the Lys-β132 → Ala nor the Asn substitution increases the hydrophobic interaction between donor and acceptor sites. They both lead to a decrease in the maximum change in absorption at 700 nm (Fig. 3) comparable to what was observed for the rHb βE6V/E7A without significant modification of the solubility of the rHbs (Fig. 6). The question arises whether these data account for an inhibition of the polymerization process and/or for different geometry or size of the polymers. It should be pointed out that the “apparent” inhibition of the polymerization process is more important when Lys-β132 is replaced by Ala than when replaced by Asn, the inhibition being intermediate with the rHb βE6V/E7A. The β132 site is sterically near the acceptor pocket involving Phe-β85 and Leu-β88. One may speculate that substituting the β132 residue modifies the acceptor pocket and the fitting between the donor and acceptor sites. In the rHb βE6V/K132A, two phenomena are susceptible to interfere with the polymerization process. The absence of the salt bridge as in the rHb βE6V/E7A would render the A helix softer and would modify the acceptor pocket. As a result Val-β6 would not fit well in the acceptor pocket, and the formation of the polymers would be delayed. When Lys-β132 is replaced by Asn the consequences seem to be less important. Molecular graphic modeling studies indicate that the position of the Asn-β132 residue makes it possible to be hydrogen-bonded to Glu-β7 (Fig. 7), thus maintaining better donor-acceptor site contacts. Alternatively, although Val-β6 is essential to the interaction with the hydrophobic acceptor pocket, other critical residues are involved in the stabilization of the nuclei. Modifying the conformation of the A helix may prevent these secondary contacts, resulting in an unstable nucleus. Note that the value of C sat is similar to that found for Hb S as also observed with rHb βE6V/E7A. The differences observed in the aggregation rates for the β132 mutated rHbs (Fig. 5) relative to Hb S and to the rHb βE6V/E7A may not only reflect quantitative but also qualitative differences in the polymer formation. Increasing the delay time (as observed for rHbs βE6V/K132A and βE6V/K132N) would be of major interest to a therapeutic approach to prevent Hb S polymerization in the microcirculation vessels. These studies may help to determine critical target sites for antisickling agents while preserving normal function and stability of the molecule, which remains a challenge. We thank M.
