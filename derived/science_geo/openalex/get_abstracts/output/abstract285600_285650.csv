https://openalex.org/W2071102901,"Conjugated organic compounds with 3-phenyl-5-isoxazolone or N,N'-diethylthiobarbituric acid acceptors have large first molecular hyperpolarizabilities (beta) in comparison with compounds with 4-nitrophenyl acceptors. For example, julolidinyl-(CH=CH)(3)-CH=N,N'- diethylthiobarbituric acid, which has 12 atoms between the donor and acceptor, has a beta(0) of 911 x 10(-30) electrostatic units, whereas (CH(3))(2)NC(6)H(4),-(CH=CH)(4)-C(6)H(4)NO(2), with 16 atoms between its donor and acceptor, has a beta(0) of 133 x 10(-30) electrostatic units. The design strategies demonstrated here have resulted in chromophores that when incorporated into poled-polymer electrooptic modulators exhibited significant enhancements in electrooptic coefficients relative to polymers containing the commonly used dye Disperse Red-1. Poled polymer devices based on these or related chromophores may ultimately lead to high-speed electrooptic switching elements with low drive-power requirements, suitable for telecommunications applications."

These isotopic shifts can be viewed as a result of air temperature fluctuations, but determination of the cause of the changes—the most crucial issue for future climate concerns—requires a detailed understanding of the controls on isotopes in precipitation. Results from general circulation model experiments suggest that the sources of Greenland precipitation varied with different climate states, allowing dynamic atmospheric mechanisms for influencing the ice core isotope shifts."

Microbial communities on Precambrian (&gt;550 million years ago) land may have been extensive enough to affect weathering, erosion, sedimentation, and geochemical processes."
https://openalex.org/W2017192136,Analysis of a 60-picosecond molecular dynamics trajectory of the reaction center of Rhodopseudomonas viridis provides an understanding of observations concerning vibrational coherence and the nonexponential kinetics of the primary charge transfer in photosynthesis. Complex kinetics arises from energy gap correlations that persist beyond 1 picosecond.
https://openalex.org/W1974235181,"Zonation of oxygen isotope ratios, fluorine, and rare earth element abundances across garnet crystals from the Permian Oslo Rift reflect temporal variation of the hydrothermal system in which the garnets grew. A sharp rimward decrease in the (18)O/(16)O ratio (of 5 per mil) across the interface between aluminum-rich garnet cores and iron-rich rims indicates influx of meteoric fluids to a system initially dominated by magmatic fluids. This influx may record the transition from ductile to brittle deformation of the hydrothermally altered rocks. In contrast, fluorine and light rare earth element concentrations increase at the core-rim interface. These data may reflect enhanced advective transport and notable kinetic control on trace element uptake by the garnets during brittle deformation."

https://openalex.org/W2058725801,"The time-dependent velocity field in a rotating Couette system has been decomposed. Successive instantaneous velocity profiles were obtained by an ultrasonic Doppler velocity profile method, and the spatiotemporal velocity field had been analyzed by two-dimensional Fourier transform. The Fourier spectrum is depicted by intrinsic peaks, and the velocity field can be reconstructed with these peak components only, indicating a successful decomposition of the velocity field. This method shows that the so-called broadband component, which is purely spatiotemporal and attributed to chaos, corresponds to a global motion of the wave propagating from roll to roll."

https://openalex.org/W2083251182,"The repaired Hubble Space Telescope overshadowed everything else at the American Astronomical Society (AAS) Meeting earlier this month in Alexandria, Virginia. The nearly 2000 astronomers who turned out for the society's largest meeting yet provided plenty of ""oohs"" and ""aahs"" for every new image. But, in between, some astronomers caught word of a new proposal about how to tell whether the universe is open or closed, more data about mysterious gamma ray bursts, and the crowning of the ""Galaxy of the Year."""
