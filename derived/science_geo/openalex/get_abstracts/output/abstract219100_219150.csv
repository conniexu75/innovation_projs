https://openalex.org/W2012961745,The amount of handling received in ten daily tests by infant mice reared by foster parents was significantly affected by the strain of pups and by the strain of foster parents. This finding siggests that at least some behavioral differences between highly inbred strains may be due to early environmental rather than genetic variation.

https://openalex.org/W1991493403,"Pigeons trained to peck a lighted key were presented with a key that was alternately dark and lighted. The key was dark for intervals of from 3 to 30 seconds. Pecking of the lighted key was reinforced only after the shortest or, in a second experiment, the longest interval that the key was dark. The pigeons were able to discriminate the duration of the dark interval."

Teeth and bones developing in the same biologic environment were found to accumulate Sr/sup 90/ and Ca in the same ratio. It was shown that collection of teeth can be accomplished on a large scale.

A linear sequence of gene action has been constructed for anthocyanin synthesis in maize by this approach. This technique probably can be applied to other systems and organisms that have the requisite circumstances.

It can be easily adapted to older children, to some animals, and to problems other than the development of exploratory behavior."

https://openalex.org/W62659791,"Studies on dogs (1) and guinea pigs (2) have shown increments in the myoglobin content of muscles of individuals from high altitude as compared with individuals from sea level. More recently, the same relation has been shown in man by the use of biopsy material (3), but there are no data on wild species living at high altitude. Since wild mammals often have a more vigorous life, and since they have adapted to altitude by mutation and selection over a much longer time span, their response may be quite different from the shorter term adaptation of man and domestic species. Thus, for example, an increase in blood hemoglobin is commonly seen in domestic animals and man during short term exposure to altitude, but the hemoglobin level in native species of mammals from high altitude is no higher than in those from sea level.” 2 This study surveys myoglobin levels in a series of wild mammals from the Peruvian altiplano, principally rodents, to provide some answers to this question.

Freund and other workers have shown aspermatogenesis following the injection of homologous testicular extract with an adjuvant1, and similarly other auto-antibodies have been produced against lens tissue2 and peripheral nerves3."

As yet no distinction has been made between the uptake of labelled thymidine and its incorporation by the cell into a more complex structure, presumably DNA."
