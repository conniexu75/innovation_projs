The intact histidine molecule is used in the synthesis, and the three methyl groups of the betaine moiety can be derived from methionine by a triple transmethylation process (2). Cysteine appears to be an immediate precursor of the sulfur atom of the thiolimidazole ring. In this paper we present data which establish the sequence of these biosynthetic reactions. provide data which show that hercynine is an intermediate compound in the biosynthesis of ergothioneine."

A response was reinforced on a ratio schedule by the termination of the light. This method produced a high rate of response quite similar to that produced by a comparable schedule of food reinforcement.

The exceptional cell frequencies were not discernibly correlated with age. The B homozygotes had fewer non-B exceptional cells than their AB parents or sibs, but too many to represent independent losses of the B alleles. These results are not in agreement with the simplest expectations based on the mutational hypothesis of automosaicism."

https://openalex.org/W2170927597,On theoretical grounds it is unlikely that the catalytic action of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase would be required for the precipitation of apatite in vitro. The presence of carbonic anhydrase in either active or inactivate form did not initiate precipitation in a metastable calcifying solution. It is unlikely that carbonate (or bicarbonate) ions are essential for the precipitation of apatite in vitro or in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W1993045074,"THE importance of obtaining more precise information regarding the sterol excretion pattern in human beings has recently become apparent and has been emphasized by Aylward1. The normal clinical laboratory techniques for stools, namely extraction of dried material or wet extraction coupled with saponification make impossible the isolation of any sterol esters which may be present. This difficulty in isolating (as distinct from estimating) sterol esters was indeed common to all lipid extracts until the methods developed by Borgstrom2, and others, were applied by Fillerup and Mead3 to extracts from animal tissues. Using silicic acid, they were able for the first time to separate cholesterol esters from triglycerides. We have applied a modification of this technique to the lipids of human faeces and have been able to isolate cholesterol ester fractions; and, using gas-liquid chromatography, have examined the fatty acids present in the esters."
