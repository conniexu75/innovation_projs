https://openalex.org/W2020601776,"G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) exhibit a spectrum of functional behaviours in response to natural and synthetic ligands. Recent crystal structures provide insights into inactive states of several GPCRs. Efforts to obtain an agonist-bound active-state GPCR structure have proven difficult due to the inherent instability of this state in the absence of a G protein. We generated a camelid antibody fragment (nanobody) to the human β(2) adrenergic receptor (β(2)AR) that exhibits G protein-like behaviour, and obtained an agonist-bound, active-state crystal structure of the receptor-nanobody complex. Comparison with the inactive β(2)AR structure reveals subtle changes in the binding pocket; however, these small changes are associated with an 11 Å outward movement of the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane segment 6, and rearrangements of transmembrane segments 5 and 7 that are remarkably similar to those observed in opsin, an active form of rhodopsin. This structure provides insights into the process of agonist binding and activation."

https://openalex.org/W2168966210,"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are eukaryotic integral membrane proteins that modulate biological function by initiating cellular signalling in response to chemically diverse agonists. Despite recent progress in the structural biology of GPCRs, the molecular basis for agonist binding and allosteric modulation of these proteins is poorly understood. Structural knowledge of agonist-bound states is essential for deciphering the mechanism of receptor activation, and for structure-guided design and optimization of ligands. However, the crystallization of agonist-bound GPCRs has been hampered by modest affinities and rapid off-rates of available agonists. Using the inactive structure of the human β(2) adrenergic receptor (β(2)AR) as a guide, we designed a β(2)AR agonist that can be covalently tethered to a specific site on the receptor through a disulphide bond. The covalent β(2)AR-agonist complex forms efficiently, and is capable of activating a heterotrimeric G protein. We crystallized a covalent agonist-bound β(2)AR-T4L fusion protein in lipid bilayers through the use of the lipidic mesophase method, and determined its structure at 3.5 Å resolution. A comparison to the inactive structure and an antibody-stabilized active structure (companion paper) shows how binding events at both the extracellular and intracellular surfaces are required to stabilize an active conformation of the receptor. The structures are in agreement with long-timescale (up to 30 μs) molecular dynamics simulations showing that an agonist-bound active conformation spontaneously relaxes to an inactive-like conformation in the absence of a G protein or stabilizing antibody."

However, the mechanisms behind this are unclear. Here, we describe a novel role for autophagy in regulating the production of IL-1β in antigen-presenting cells. After treatment of macrophages with Toll-like receptor ligands, pro-IL-1β was specifically sequestered into autophagosomes, whereas further activation of autophagy with rapamycin induced the degradation of pro-IL-1β and blocked secretion of the mature cytokine. Inhibition of autophagy promoted the processing and secretion of IL-1β by antigen-presenting cells in an NLRP3- and TRIF-dependent manner. This effect was reduced by inhibition of reactive oxygen species but was independent of NOX2. Induction of autophagy in mice in vivo with rapamycin reduced serum levels of IL-1β in response to challenge with LPS. These data demonstrate that autophagy controls the production of IL-1β through at least two separate mechanisms: by targeting pro-IL-1β for lysosomal degradation and by regulating activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.

These data demonstrate that autophagy controls the production of IL-1β through at least two separate mechanisms: by targeting pro-IL-1β for lysosomal degradation and by regulating activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. IntroductionIL-1β is an important proinflammatory cytokine, released at sites of infection or injury, that regulates diverse physiological responses, including cellular recruitment, appetite, sleep, and body temperature (1Dinarello C.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2010; 40: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). IL-1β is first produced as a proform in response to inflammatory stimuli, such as TLR ligands. This inactive precursor is cleaved into the bioactive (p17) molecule by caspase 1, following the activation of an inflammasome (2Schroder K. Tschopp J. Cell. 2010; 140: 821-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4001) Google Scholar). Inflammasomes are molecular scaffolds that trigger the activation of caspase 1 and subsequent maturation of IL-1β and IL-18. Typically, inflammasomes are formed from at least one member of the cytosolic innate immune sensor family, the NOD-like receptors (NLRs), including NLRP1, NLRP3, and NLRC4, coupled with the adaptor apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC or PYCARD) and caspase 1 (2Schroder K. Tschopp J. Cell. 2010; 140: 821-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4001) Google Scholar). The NLRP3 inflammasome is the best characterized to date and is activated by a number of endogenous and exogenous signals.Most studies in vitro employ TLR ligands, particularly LPS, to induce pro-IL-1β formation, but in many cases, this is not enough to stimulate inflammasome activation and secretion of the mature cytokine. Instead, a second signal is commonly required, and this can come from a number of endogenous and exogenous sources, including ATP and particulates, including uric acid crystals, amyloid-β, silica, asbestos, synthetic microparticles, and alum (3Eisenbarth S.C.

Uptake of particulates by phagocytes may lead to lysosomal damage and release of lysosomal products into the cytosol, which activates NLRP3 (4Hornung V. Bauernfeind F. Halle A. Samstad E.O. Kono H.

In particular, the lysosomal protease cathepsin B has been implicated, due to the inhibitory effects of the cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074 methyl ester on IL-1β secretion (4Hornung V. Bauernfeind F.

Controlled by the products of autophagy-related genes (Atg), autophagy occurs under normal physiological conditions but can be up-regulated by numerous factors, including nutrient deprivation and pharmacological inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In addition, autophagy is regulated by cytokines; it is up-regulated by IFN-γ and TNF-α (17Gutierrez M.G. Master S.S. Singh S.B. Taylor G.A. Colombo M.I. Deretic V. Cell. 2004; 119: 753-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar, 18Harris J. Keane J. Clin. Exp.

Immunity. 2007; 27: 505-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). It was previously reported that inhibition of autophagy in macrophages by knockdown of Atg7 or Atg16L1 promoted the secretion of IL-1β in response to LPS (20Saitoh T. Fujita N. Jang M.H. Uematsu S. Yang B.G. Satoh T. Omori H. Noda T. Yamamoto N. Komatsu M. Tanaka K. Kawai T. Tsujimura T. Takeuchi O. Yoshimori T. Akira S. Nature. 2008; 456: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). The mechanisms behind this observation, or the inflammasome responsible, have not been fully determined, although the process was found to be dependent on signaling via TIR (Toll/IL-1 receptor) domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β (TRIF) and ROS (20Saitoh T. Fujita N. Jang M.H. Uematsu S. Yang B.G. Satoh T. Omori H. Noda T. Yamamoto N. Komatsu M. Tanaka K. Kawai T. Tsujimura T. Takeuchi O. Yoshimori T. Akira S. Nature. 2008; 456: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar).The aim of this study was to determine the mechanisms behind autophagy-dependent regulation of IL-1β secretion. Using bone marrow-derived macrophages (iBMM) and DC (BMDC) from knock-out mice we found that autophagy regulates the NLRP3 inflammasome. Moreover, we found that after TLR ligation in macrophages IL-1β was specifically sequestered into autophagosomes. Furthermore, induction of autophagy using rapamycin resulted in the loss of intracellular pro-IL-1β and inhibited secretion of mature IL-1β in cells stimulated with LPS and alum, chitosan or ATP and reduced IL-1β in the blood of mice challenged with LPS.DISCUSSIONThe link between autophagy and innate and adaptive immunity is now well established. In particular, autophagy has been demonstrated to play a role in the maturation of pathogen-containing phagosomes and MHC class II presentation of viral antigens (17Gutierrez M.G. Master S.S.

Moreover, autophagy is itself regulated by cytokines and may be an effector of Th1/Th2 polarization; it is induced by IFN-γ and TNF-α (17Gutierrez M.G. Master S.S. Singh S.B. Taylor G.A. Colombo M.I.

Immunity. 2007; 27: 505-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). In addition, inflammatory stimuli, including LPS and other TLR agonists, have been shown to induce autophagy (31Delgado M.A. Elmaoued R.A. Davis A.S. Kyei G. Deretic V. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1110-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 32Shi C.S. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol.

Immunity. 2007; 27: 135-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). A recent study has suggested that autophagy may also be a regulator of inflammation, modulating inflammasome activation and release of IL-1β (20Saitoh T. Fujita N. Jang M.H. Uematsu S. Yang B.G. Satoh T. Omori H. Noda T. Yamamoto N. Komatsu M. Tanaka K. Kawai T. Tsujimura T. Takeuchi O. Yoshimori T. Akira S. Nature. 2008; 456: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the inhibition of autophagy in LPS-activated BMDC and iBMM leads to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and secretion of IL-1β and IL-18. This is dependent on caspase 1, ASC, and TRIF and may involve the generation of ROS.Although it is clear from this study and that of Saitoh et al. (20Saitoh T. Fujita N. Jang M.H. Uematsu S. Yang B.G. Satoh T. Omori H. Noda T. Yamamoto N. Komatsu M. Tanaka K. Kawai T. Tsujimura T. Takeuchi O. Yoshimori T. Akira S. Nature. 2008; 456: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar) that activation of the inflammasome by LPS in the absence of autophagy is dependent on TRIF signaling, the mechanism behind this is not clear. Both TRIF and MyD88 can mediate TLR-induced production of pro-IL-1β and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, as demonstrated by the fact that all the TLR agonists we tested can induce production of pro-IL-1β and secretion of mature IL-1β, when given in combination with ATP. Moreover, our data show that although both TRIF−/− and MyD88−/− BMDC show equally reduced secretion of IL-1β in response to LPS with ATP or LPS with alum, compared with WT cells, both still secrete significantly more IL-1β than cells treated with LPS alone. This suggests that, in the case of LPS, one can compensate for the other, at least to a degree, but the full response is dependent on both pathways. Indeed, BMDC from TRIF−/− MyD88−/− double knock-out mice do not respond at all to LPS with ATP or alum (data not shown). However, the response of BMDC to LPS with 3-MA is completely abrogated in TRIF−/− cells but is still present in MyD88−/− cells. This would suggest that, unlike LPS with ATP or alum, the role of TRIF in response to LPS and 3-MA cannot be compensated for by the presence of MyD88. Interestingly, TLR agonists can induce autophagy in macrophages through both TRIF- and MyD88-dependent pathways (31Delgado M.A. Elmaoued R.A. Davis A.S. Kyei G. Deretic V.

Nature. 2008; 456: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar) found that Atg16L1-deficient macrophages generated higher levels of ROS in response to LPS compared with WT or Atg16L1/TRIF double-deficient cells, suggesting that autophagy is an important regulator of intracellular ROS. Although we did not see an increase in LPS-induced ROS generation in 3-MA-treated BMDC or iBMM (data not shown), we did find that the ROS scavenger NAc inhibited IL-1β secretion in response to LPS in combination with either wortmannin or 3-MA. However, we found that IL-1β secretion by iBMM deficient in the phagocytic NADPH oxidase, NOX2 (gp91phox), was not impaired in response to LPS with 3-MA or LPS with ATP or alum. This would suggest either that ROS from an alternative source are involved in activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome or that NAc inhibits inflammasome activation via a ROS-independent mechanism. One possible alternative source of ROS is from altered or damaged mitochondria and peroxisomes. Given that autophagy is involved in the removal of these organelles (15Monastyrska I. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Aspects Med. 2006; 27: 483-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 16Moreau K. Luo S. Rubinsztein D.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2010; 22: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), this could represent a mechanism for the inflammasome-activating action of autophagy inhibitors. Indeed, a recent study has demonstrated that ROS from mitochondria can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in human THP-1 cells and that autophagy of mitochondria (mitophagy) inhibits this (37Zhou R. Yazdi A.S. Menu P. Tschopp J. Nature. 2010; Google Scholar). Moreover, ROS derived from both mitochondria and NADPH oxidases stimulate autophagy (38Chen Y. Azad M.B. Gibson S.B.

Yamamoto N. Komatsu M. Tanaka K. Kawai T. Tsujimura T. Takeuchi O. Yoshimori T. Akira S. Nature. 2008; 456: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar) found that inhibition of potassium efflux with extracellular KCl prevented LPS-induced IL-1β secretion in macrophages deficient in Atg16L1, which is involved in the formation of autophagosomes. In agreement with this, we found that KCl inhibited LPS-induced IL-1β secretion in macrophages treated with 3-MA at high concentrations. However, at these concentrations, IL-6 production was also abrogated, which may suggest a general inhibitory or toxic effect.Our finding that IL-1β is sequestered into autophagosomes suggests a previously unidentified role for autophagy in controlling inflammatory responses in macrophages and dendritic cells. Moreover, the fact that further induction of autophagy with rapamycin in LPS-treated cells leads to the loss of intracellular pro-IL-1β and inhibition of IL-1β secretion after treatment with LPS and alum, chitosan, or ATP strongly suggests that autophagosomes specifically target pro-IL-1β for degradation. Moreover, caspase 1 was not seen in autophagosomes, suggesting that autophagosomes do not act as a platform for inflammasome assembly and processing of IL-1β, but rather segregate pro-IL-1β from caspase 1. This sequestration of IL-1β by autophagosomes might explain why inhibition of autophagy leads to increased secretion of IL-1β in response to LPS; more pro-IL-1β is available in the cytosol. However, LPS-induced inflammasome activation and secretion of IL-1β by cells deficient in autophagy is dependent on TRIF, while both MyD88- and TRIF-dependent mechanisms lead to the generation of pro-IL-1β and the sequestration of IL-1β into autophagosomes, as demonstrated by our experiments with other TLR agonists, including poly(I:C), which signals through TRIF and PAM3CysK4, R837, and CpG, which signal through MyD88 (40O'Neill L.A. Bowie A.G. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). Thus, these data suggest that inhibition of autophagy increases IL-1β secretion through two different mechanisms. First, inhibiting autophagy prevents degradation of pro-IL-1β, leaving more of the cytokine available in the cytosol for processing and secretion. Second, inhibition of autophagy leads to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase 1-dependent processing of IL-1β through a ROS/TRIF-dependent mechanism.Previous studies have implicated the autophagy gene Atg16L 1 as a candidate gene for susceptibility to Crohn disease (41Hampe J.

Using an in vivo LPS challenge model, we have demonstrated that rapamycin, a potent activator of autophagy, reduces serum levels of IL-1β in mice, compared with those treated with LPS alone. These data indicate that autophagy has an important role to play in regulating acute inflammation in vivo. Conversely, a recent study has demonstrated that serum IL-1β and IL-18 levels in MAPLC3−/− mice are raised compared with WT in response to LPS challenge (44Nakahira K. Haspel J.A. Rathinam V.A. Lee S.J. Dolinay T. Lam H.C. Englert J.A. Rabinovitch M. Cernadas M. Kim H.P. Fitzgerald K.A. Ryter S.W. Choi A.M. Nat. Immunol. 2010; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, short-term induction of autophagy may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for sepsis and fever, whereas targeted administration of rapamycin or alternative autophagy-inducing compounds might offer new remedies for inflammatory conditions such as Crohn disease.In summary, we have demonstrated that the inhibition of autophagy in the presence of TLR3 or TLR4 signaling leads to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and secretion of IL-1β and IL-18. This is dependent on caspase 1 and on signaling via the TRIF pathway. In addition, we found that inhibitors of ROS and potassium efflux inhibited IL-1β secretion in response to autophagy blockade. Stimulation of cells with LPS induces autophagy and results in IL-1β being sequestered by autophagosomes, suggesting that autophagy may control inflammation through the degradation of pro-IL-1β. Furthermore, the induction of autophagy in mice using rapamycin reduced LPS-induced elevation of serum IL-1β. Thus, we present a novel mechanism by which autophagy can regulate inflammatory responses in antigen-presenting cells. IntroductionIL-1β is an important proinflammatory cytokine, released at sites of infection or injury, that regulates diverse physiological responses, including cellular recruitment, appetite, sleep, and body temperature (1Dinarello C.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2010; 40: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). IL-1β is first produced as a proform in response to inflammatory stimuli, such as TLR ligands. This inactive precursor is cleaved into the bioactive (p17) molecule by caspase 1, following the activation of an inflammasome (2Schroder K. Tschopp J. Cell. 2010; 140: 821-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4001) Google Scholar). Inflammasomes are molecular scaffolds that trigger the activation of caspase 1 and subsequent maturation of IL-1β and IL-18. Typically, inflammasomes are formed from at least one member of the cytosolic innate immune sensor family, the NOD-like receptors (NLRs), including NLRP1, NLRP3, and NLRC4, coupled with the adaptor apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC or PYCARD) and caspase 1 (2Schroder K. Tschopp J. Cell. 2010; 140: 821-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4001) Google Scholar). The NLRP3 inflammasome is the best characterized to date and is activated by a number of endogenous and exogenous signals.Most studies in vitro employ TLR ligands, particularly LPS, to induce pro-IL-1β formation, but in many cases, this is not enough to stimulate inflammasome activation and secretion of the mature cytokine. Instead, a second signal is commonly required, and this can come from a number of endogenous and exogenous sources, including ATP and particulates, including uric acid crystals, amyloid-β, silica, asbestos, synthetic microparticles, and alum (3Eisenbarth S.C.

https://openalex.org/W2085164934,"Similar to silicon that is the basis of conventional electronics, strontium titanate (SrTiO3) is the bedrock of the emerging field of oxide electronics. SrTiO3 is the preferred template to create exotic two-dimensional (2D) phases of electron matter at oxide interfaces, exhibiting metal-insulator transitions, superconductivity, or large negative magnetoresistance. However, the physical nature of the electronic structure underlying these 2D electron gases (2DEGs) remains elusive, although its determination is crucial to understand their remarkable properties. Here we show, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), that there is a highly metallic universal 2DEG at the vacuum-cleaved surface of SrTiO3, independent of bulk carrier densities over more than seven decades, including the undoped insulating material. This 2DEG is confined within a region of ~5 unit cells with a sheet carrier density of ~0.35 electrons per a^2 (a is the cubic lattice parameter). We unveil a remarkable electronic structure consisting on multiple subbands of heavy and light electrons. The similarity of this 2DEG with those reported in SrTiO3-based heterostructures and field-effect transistors suggests that different forms of electron confinement at the surface of SrTiO3 lead to essentially the same 2DEG. Our discovery provides a model system for the study of the electronic structure of 2DEGs in SrTiO3-based devices, and a novel route to generate 2DEGs at surfaces of transition-metal oxides."
https://openalex.org/W1978441796,"Brain changes in response to nerve damage or cochlear trauma can generate pathological neural activity that is believed to be responsible for many types of chronic pain and tinnitus. Several studies have reported that the severity of chronic pain and tinnitus is correlated with the degree of map reorganization in somatosensory and auditory cortex, respectively. Direct electrical or transcranial magnetic stimulation of sensory cortex can temporarily disrupt these phantom sensations. However, there is as yet no direct evidence for a causal role of plasticity in the generation of pain or tinnitus. Here we report evidence that reversing the brain changes responsible can eliminate the perceptual impairment in an animal model of noise-induced tinnitus. Exposure to intense noise degrades the frequency tuning of auditory cortex neurons and increases cortical synchronization. Repeatedly pairing tones with brief pulses of vagus nerve stimulation completely eliminated the physiological and behavioural correlates of tinnitus in noise-exposed rats. These improvements persisted for weeks after the end of therapy. This method for restoring neural activity to normal may be applicable to a variety of neurological disorders."

Much effort has been devoted worldwide over the past years to develop memories suitable for the storage of quantum states. Of central importance to this task is the preservation of entanglement, a quantum mechanical phenomenon whose counter intuitive properties have occupied philosophers, physicists and computer scientists since the early days of quantum physics. Here we report, for the first time, the reversible transfer of photon-photon entanglement into entanglement between a photon and collective atomic excitation in a solid-state device. Towards this end, we employ a thulium-doped lithium niobate waveguide in conjunction with a photon-echo quantum memory protocol, and increase the spectral acceptance from the current maximum of 100 MHz to 5 GHz. The entanglement-preserving nature of our storage device is assessed by comparing the amount of entanglement contained in the detected photon pairs before and after the reversible transfer, showing, within statistical error, a perfect mapping process. Our integrated, broadband quantum memory complements the family of robust, integrated lithium niobate devices. It renders frequency matching of light with matter interfaces in advanced applications of quantum communication trivial and institutes several key properties in the quest to unleash the full potential of quantum communication."

Two groups report advances in the development of the light–matter quantum interface that could pave the way for the construction of multiplexed quantum repeaters for long-distance quantum networks. Clausen et al. demonstrate entanglement between a photon at the telecommunication wavelength (1,338 nanometres) and a single collective atomic excitation stored in a neodymium-doped Y2SiO5 crystal. Saglamyurek et al. use a thulium-doped LiNbO3 waveguide to achieve a similar entanglement. Harnessing entanglement between light and material systems is of interest for future quantum information technologies. Here, entanglement is demonstrated between a photon at the telecommunication wavelength (1,338 nm) and a single collective atomic excitation stored in a crystal. These resources pave the way for building multiplexed quantum repeaters for long-distance quantum networks. Entanglement is the fundamental characteristic of quantum physics—much experimental effort is devoted to harnessing it between various physical systems. In particular, entanglement between light and material systems is interesting owing to their anticipated respective roles as ‘flying’ and stationary qubits in quantum information technologies (such as quantum repeaters1,2,3 and quantum networks4). Here we report the demonstration of entanglement between a photon at a telecommunication wavelength (1,338 nm) and a single collective atomic excitation stored in a crystal. One photon from an energy–time entangled pair5 is mapped onto the crystal and then released into a well-defined spatial mode after a predetermined storage time. The other (telecommunication wavelength) photon is sent directly through a 50-metre fibre link to an analyser. Successful storage of entanglement in the crystal is proved by a violation of the Clauser–Horne–Shimony–Holt inequality6 by almost three standard deviations (S = 2.64 ± 0.23). These results represent an important step towards quantum communication technologies based on solid-state devices. In particular, our resources pave the way for building multiplexed quantum repeaters7 for long-distance quantum networks."

The structural basis for interaction with DNA is unknown, which limits our understanding of PARP-1 regulation and involvement in DNA repair and transcription. Here, we have determined crystal structures for the individual Zn1 and Zn2 domains in complex with a DNA double strand break, providing the first views of PARP-1 zinc fingers bound to DNA. The Zn1-DNA and Zn2-DNA structures establish a novel, bipartite mode of sequence-independent DNA interaction that engages a continuous region of the phosphodiester backbone and the hydrophobic faces of exposed nucleotide bases. Biochemical and cell biological analysis indicate that the Zn1 and Zn2 domains perform distinct functions. The Zn2 domain exhibits high binding affinity to DNA compared with the Zn1 domain. However, the Zn1 domain is essential for DNA-dependent PARP-1 activity in vitro and in vivo, whereas the Zn2 domain is not strictly required. Structural differences between the Zn1-DNA and Zn2-DNA complexes, combined with mutational and structural analysis, indicate that a specialized region of the Zn1 domain is re-configured through the hydrophobic interaction with exposed nucleotide bases to initiate PARP-1 activation."

Here, we show that KIBRA associates with and activates Lats (large tumor suppressor) 1 and 2 kinases by stimulating their phosphorylation on the hydrophobic motif. KIBRA overexpression stimulates the phosphorylation of Yes-associated protein (YAP), the Hippo pathway effector. Conversely, depletion of KIBRA by RNA interference reduces YAP phosphorylation. Furthermore, KIBRA stabilizes Lats2 by inhibiting its ubiquitination. We also found that KIBRA mRNA is induced by YAP overexpression in both murine and human cells, suggesting the evolutionary conservation of KIBRA as a transcriptional target of the Hippo signaling pathway.

Two mechanisms have been proposed for this, an effect on gating and an enhancement of expression. With respect to the effect on expression, β-subunits have been suggested to enhance trafficking by masking an unidentified endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal. Here we have investigated whether, and how, β-subunits affect the level of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 channels within somata and neurites of cultured sympathetic neurons. We have used YFP-Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 containing a mutation (W391A), that prevents binding of β-subunits to its I-II linker and found that expression of this channel was much reduced compared with WT CFP-Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 when both were expressed in the same neuron. This effect was particularly evident in neurites and growth cones. The difference between the levels of YFP-Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2(W391A) and CFP-Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2(WT) was lost in the absence of co-expressed β-subunits. Furthermore, the relative reduction of expression of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2(W391A) compared with the WT channel was reversed by exposure to two proteasome inhibitors, MG132 and lactacystin, particularly in the somata. In further experiments in tsA-201 cells, we found that proteasome inhibition did not augment the cell surface Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2(W391A) level but resulted in the observation of increased ubiquitination, particularly of mutant channels. In contrast, we found no evidence for selective retention of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2(W391A) in the ER, in either the soma or growth cones. In conclusion, there is a marked effect of β-subunits on Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 expression, particularly in neurites, but our results point to protection from proteasomal degradation rather than masking of an ER retention signal."

Therefore, regulation of HA synthesis could provide new methods to treat vascular pathologies. Growth factors, cytokines, prostaglandins, PKA, and PKC are known to modulate HA synthesis through HAS activity and HAS gene expression, although their physiological roles are not completely understood (1Jiang D. Liang J. Noble P.W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 435-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Our research and that of others have revealed the critical role of the UDP-sugar precursors (UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc) in the regulation of HA synthesis (16Jokela T.A. Jauhiainen M. Auriola S.

The ratio of NAD+ to NADH, which is influenced mainly by oxygen availability, is known to control UDP-GlcUA content through the activity of UDP-glucose dehydrogenase in cartilage and cornea, which can lead to keratan sulfate synthesis (18Balduini C. Brovelli A. De Luca G. Galligani L. Castellani A.A. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The synthesis of HA precursors requires ATP, UTP, and other critical metabolic molecules, including glucose, glutamine, glucosamine, and acetyl-CoA (supplemental Fig. S1), which makes GAG production an energy-consuming process. As energy charge is critical for the regulation of all cellular metabolism, we tested whether the ATP/AMP ratio could control the synthesis of HA and other GAGs. We focused our attention on AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is the main energy sensor of the eukaryotic cell (19Hardie D.G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5479-5487Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). AMPK is a heterotrimeric protein with a catalytic α subunit and two regulatory subunits (β and γ) that, when the ATP/AMP ratio decreases, inhibit anabolic processes and induce catabolic pathways to restore ATP levels (20Towler M.C. Hardie D.G. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 328-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). The mechanism for activating AMPK is complex and involves phosphorylation of the critical Thr-172 on the catalytic α subunit. By altering gene expression or by directly phosphorylating several pivotal enzymes, AMPK regulates cellular metabolic processes, including glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, lipid metabolism, and protein synthesis. However, the consequences for the metabolism of ECM components are not yet known. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine how modulation of AMPK affects the metabolism of HA and other GAGs in primary human aortic SMCs (AoSMCs). Primary human AoSMCs were purchased from Lonza and were grown for four to five passages in complete SmGm2 culture medium (Lonza) supplemented with 5% FBS as described previously (15Vigetti D. Rizzi M. Viola M. Karousou E. Genasetti A. Clerici M. Bartolini B. Hascall V.C. De Luca G. Passi A. Glycobiology. 2009; 19: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). 2.5 × 105 cells were seeded in 35-mm dishes, and after 6 h, SmGm2 medium was replaced with high glucose DMEM supplemented with 0.2% FBS to induce quiescence. After 48 h, DMEM was maintained in the positive control (quiescent cells), whereas it was replaced with SmGm2 medium supplemented with 15% FBS in the negative control (growth cells). In the treated cells, DMEM was substituted with SmGm2 medium enriched with 15% FBS and supplemented with increasing concentrations of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR), metformin, or 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) (all from Sigma). Western blot experiments were performed as reported previously (14Vigetti D. Viola M. Karousou E. Rizzi M. Moretto P. Genasetti A. Clerici M. Hascall V.C. De Luca G. Passi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4448-4458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) using antibodies against AMPKα, phospho-AMPKα (Thr-172), or phospho-acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Ser-79) (all from Cell Signaling). To investigate the phosphorylation of HAS2 at the putative AMPK target residue Thr-110, we used a affinity-purified phospho-specific polyclonal antibody prepared in rabbit against the synthetic peptide RKCLQSVKRLpTYPGIKV, which resembles residues 100–116 of the human HAS2 sequence (Davids Biotechnologie, Regensburg, Germany). As a control, we also used a polyclonal antibody against the same peptide without threonine phosphorylation (generated by the same company). HA, chondroitin sulfate (CS), and heparan sulfate (HS) released into the culture medium were purified by proteinase K (Finnzymes) and ethanol precipitation. Streptomyces dysgalactiae hyaluronidase, chondroitinase ABC, and heparinases I–III (all from Seikagaku) were used to obtain the unsaturated (Δ) disaccharides, which were quantified by HPLC analyses (21Karousou E.G.

Pericellular HA matrices were visualized using a particle exclusion assay (15Vigetti D. Rizzi M. Viola M. Karousou E. Genasetti A. Clerici M. Bartolini B. Hascall V.C. De Luca G. Passi A. Glycobiology. 2009; 19: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Total RNAs were extracted from AoSMCs with TRIzol (Invitrogen), retrotranscribed using the High Capacity cDNA synthesis kit (Applied Biosystems), and amplified on an ABI Prism 7000 instrument (Applied Biosystems). The following human TaqMan gene expression assays were used: HAS1 (Hs00155410_m1), HAS2 (Hs00193435_m1), HAS3 (Hs00193436_m1), UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (Hs00163365_m1), UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (Hs00198879_m1), and β-actin (Hs99999903_m1). The relative gene expression was determined by comparing ΔCt (14Vigetti D. Viola M. Karousou E. Rizzi M. Moretto P. Genasetti A. Clerici M. Hascall V.C. De Luca G. Passi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4448-4458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Confluent AoSMCs were growth-arrested by culture in DMEM with 0.2% FBS for 2 days. The cells were scratched by blue tip and then cultured under different conditions for 24 h. Migrated cells were quantified as described previously (15Vigetti D. Rizzi M. Viola M. Karousou E. Genasetti A. Clerici M. Bartolini B. Hascall V.C. De Luca G. Passi A. Glycobiology. 2009; 19: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To assess the adhesiveness of AoSMCs under different conditions, we performed monocyte adhesion assays using the U937 monocyte cell line as reported previously (15Vigetti D. Rizzi M. Viola M. Karousou E. Genasetti A. Clerici M. Bartolini B. Hascall V.C. De Luca G. Passi A. Glycobiology. 2009; 19: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Primary AoSMCs were nucleofected with 5 μg of plasmid DNA using a Nucleofector apparatus (Amaxa) and the human AoSMC Nucleofector kit as described previously (17Vigetti D. Ori M. Viola M.

Wild-type and knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and COS-1 and COS-7 cells were efficiently transfected using ExGen 500 (Fermentas) following the manufacturer's protocol. Control or transfected COS-7 cells were lysed in 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) by scraping and sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C to obtain microsomes containing vesiculated fragments of the plasma membrane (23Caride A.J. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Penniston J.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The pellet was resuspended in the lysis buffer, and protein content was determined by Bradford assay. Twenty μg of proteins were used to determine HAS activity as described previously (8Vigetti D. Genasetti A. Karousou E. Viola M. Clerici M. Bartolini B. Moretto P. De Luca G. Hascall V.C. Passi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 30684-30694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Statistical analyses of the data were performed by analysis of variance, followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests using Origin 7.5 software (OriginLab). Probability values of p < 0.01 or 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Experiments were repeated three times, each time in duplicate, and data are expressed as means ± S.E. To induce AMPK activation, AoSMCs were incubated for 2 days with 0.2% FBS to induce quiescence (positive control) and then treated for 48 h with 15% FBS (negative control) or with 15% FBS plus AICAR, a pharmacological activator of AMPK that mimics AMP, as previously reported in AoSMCs (24Igata M. Motoshima H. Tsuruzoe K. Kojima K. Matsumura T. Kondo T. Taguchi T. Nakamaru K. Yano M. Kukidome D. Matsumoto K. Toyonaga T. Asano T. Nishikawa T. Araki E. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). By Western blotting, we demonstrated that AICAR induced phosphorylation of Thr-172 on the AMPK α subunit and that AICAR induced AMPK activation by detecting phospho-acetyl-CoA carboxylase, an AMPK target (Fig. 1A). In other experiments, quiescent AoSMCs were treated for 48 h with metformin and 2-DG (Fig. 1A), which induce AMPK phosphorylation and activation driven by different mechanisms from AICAR, i.e. through the upstream kinase complex LKB1-STRAD-MO25 (25Zhou G. Myers R. Li Y. Chen Y. Shen X. Fenyk-Melody J. Wu M. Ventre J. Doebber T. Fujii N. Musi N. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (4472) Google Scholar) and by ATP depletion, respectively. These results showed that AICAR, metformin, and 2-DG sustained phospho-AMPK and phospho-acetyl-CoA carboxylase activities in 15% FBS in dose-dependent responses. At this time point, we collected aliquots of cell medium and purified the secreted GAGs. Unsaturated (Δ) disaccharides from HA, CS, and HS were obtained by digestion with specific enzyme eliminases. The resulting Δ-disaccharides were then derivatized with 2-aminoacridone and quantified by HPLC (21Karousou E.G. Viola M. Genasetti A. Vigetti D. Luca G.D. Karamanos N.K. Passi A. Biomed. Chromatogr. 2005; 19: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 22Viola M. Vigetti D. Karousou E. Bartolini B. Genasetti A. Rizzi M. Clerici M. Pallotti F. De Luca G. Passi A. Electrophoresis. 2008; 29: 3168-3174Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The treatment of quiescent AoSMCs with 15% FBS induced an ∼2.5-fold increase in HA, whereas the addition of 15% FBS plus AICAR or metformin caused a dose-dependent and statistically significant inhibition of HA synthesis (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the synthesis of CS (both 6- and 4-sulfated isomers) (Fig. 1B) as well as HS (supplemental Fig. S1) did not change after the treatments, and only minor and not statistically significant modification of sulfation patterns were observed. These results clearly demonstrate that HA synthesis, but not CS or HS synthesis, is inhibited by both AICAR and metformin. Previous studies showed that metformin does not decrease sulfate incorporation into GAGs (26de Dios S.T. Frontanilla K.V. Nigro J. Ballinger M.L. Ivey M.E. Cawson E.A. Little P.J. J. Diabetes Complicat. 2007; 21: 108-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, because HA is not sulfated, our results are novel and particularly interesting because of the critical functions of HA in the vasculature. The “conventional” GAG synthesis inhibitor 2-DG (27Tímár J. Diczházi C. Bartha I. Pogány G. Paku S. Rásó E. Tóvári J. Ladányi A. Lapis K. Kopper L. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 62: 755-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was used as a control and indeed reduced synthesis of both HA and CS (Fig. 1B). Moreover, HA, which remains associated with cell membranes to form pericellular coats, also decreased after the treatments as evaluated by particle exclusion assays (supplemental Fig. S2). To confirm the results obtained with AICAR, AoSMCs were also treated with dipyridamole, which inhibits AICAR transport into cells by blocking an adenosine transporter, and with 5′-amino-5′-deoxyadenosine, which inhibits the cytosolic phosphorylation of AICAR by blocking the adenosine kinase (24Igata M. Motoshima H. Tsuruzoe K. Kojima K. Matsumura T. Kondo T. Taguchi T. Nakamaru K. Yano M. Kukidome D. Matsumoto K. Toyonaga T. Asano T. Nishikawa T. Araki E. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Both these treatments avoided the HA reduction induced by AICAR (Fig. 1C). To confirm the involvement of AMPK in HA synthesis inhibition, we used Compound C, a specific AMPK inhibitor (25Zhou G. Myers R. Li Y. Chen Y. Shen X. Fenyk-Melody J. Wu M. Ventre J. Doebber T. Fujii N. Musi N. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (4472) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, Compound C in the presence of AICAR increased the HA level to near control levels. Therefore, these data substantiate the critical involvement of AMPK in regulating HA synthesis. Furthermore, AoSMCs were nucleofected with a recombinant pcDNA3 plasmid coding for constitutively active AMPK (CA-AMPK) or for dominant-negative AMPK (DN-AMPK). The amount of HA secreted was dramatically decreased after CA-AMPK nucleofection but did not change after DN-AMPK nucleofection (Fig. 2B). Similarly, HA pericellular coats were abolished by CA-AMPK but not DN-AMPK treatment (supplemental Fig. S2). Interestingly, CS synthesis was not altered by either of the treatments (Fig. 2B), indicating a specific role of AMPK in HA synthesis. To definitely demonstrate AMPK effects on HA synthesis, we used MEFs from animals null in the α1 and α2 subunits of AMPK (AMPK−/−) or from wild-type (AMPK+/+) mice, both kindly provided by Benoît Viollet (28Laderoute K.R. Amin K. Calaoagan J.M. Knapp M. Le T. Orduna J. Foretz M. Viollet B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5336-5347Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In preliminary control experiments, we verified the lack of AMPK activity in AMPK−/− MEFs by demonstrating the absence of the phospho-acetyl-CoA carboxylase band in Western blotting as well as the lack of cell cycle inhibition after AICAR addition (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S3). AMPK+/+ and AMPK−/− MEF cultures were treated with 15% FBS or with 15% FBS plus AICAR or metformin. After 48 h, AICAR and metformin reduced HA released into the medium by ∼60% in AMPK+/+ MEF cultures (Fig. 2D) and caused a near absence of cell-associated HA (supplemental Fig. S4). As expected, CS was not affected by the treatments (Fig. 2D). In contrast, HA in AMPK−/− MEF cultures was not changed by these treatments (Fig. 2D). These results demonstrate that cells without AMPK activity are not able to reduce HA synthesis in response to AICAR or metformin. The transfection of the CA-AMPK-coding plasmid into AMPK−/− MEFs restored their ability to inhibit HA synthesis (Fig. 2E). This clearly shows that the energy charge, through AMPK activity, regulates HA synthesis and therefore affects ECM composition. SMCs are involved in vascular diseases through their proliferation, intima invasion, and recruitment of immune cells, and HA has a central role to control SMC behavior. Therefore, we investigated whether AICAR and metformin are able to modulate AoSMC cell cycle responses. Using cytofluorometric analyses, we confirmed the previously published data (24Igata M. Motoshima H. Tsuruzoe K. Kojima K. Matsumura T. Kondo T. Taguchi T. Nakamaru K. Yano M. Kukidome D. Matsumoto K. Toyonaga T. Asano T. Nishikawa T. Araki E. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) indicating that AICAR and metformin, through AMPK, can block the cell cycle in G0/G1 phase without inducing cell death or apoptosis (data not shown). Furthermore, the exogenous addition of high molecular mass HA (average of ∼4 × 106 Da; Healon) and the exogenous addition of low molecular weight HA (prepared by digesting Healon with testicular hyaluronidase for 90 min, which generates oligosaccharides <500 kDa) to AICAR- or metformin-treated cells maintained AoSMCs arrested in G0/G1 (supplemental Fig. S5), suggesting that the HA-activated signaling by specific cell-surface receptors cannot bypass the block of the cell cycle induced by AMPK. These data confirm the finding that high molecular mass HA antagonizes mitogen-induced S phase entry in vascular SMCs by modulating cyclin D1 and p27kip1 (12Cuff C.A. Kothapalli D. Azonobi I. Chun S. Zhang Y. Belkin R. Yeh C. Secreto A. Assoian R.K. Rader D.J. Puré E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 29Kothapalli D. Zhao L. Hawthorne E.A. Cheng Y. Lee E. Puré E. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). On the other hand, by means of scratch tests, we found that AMPK activity reduced cell migration by ∼70%, whereas AMPK inhibition by Compound C maintained cell motility (Fig. 3A). The exogenous addition of high molecular mass HA was not able to bypass the blocking effect of AMPK on cell migration (supplemental Fig. S5). This issue is interesting, as high molecular mass HA is generally known to greatly induce cell mobility, and by decreasing HA synthesis, AICAR or metformin could be useful to limit HA-dependent cell invasion that is critical in several pathologies, such as cancer metastasis or neointima formation. Interestingly, low molecular mass HA, which is known to strongly induce cell motility, was able to partially overcome the effects AICAR and metformin (supplemental Fig. S5). As in vivo HA can be fragmented during neointima formation due to an inflammatory response (30de la Motte C. Nigro J. Vasanji A. Rho H. Kessler S. Bandyopadhyay S. Danese S. Fiocchi C. Stern R. Am. J. Pathol. 2009; 174: 2254-2264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the migration inhibitory effect of AMPK could be maintained also in the presence of HA oligosaccharides that physiologically are a strong activator of cell proliferation or motility. AICAR and metformin treatments also strongly reduced adhesion of fluorescent U937 monocytes on AoSMCs, whereas AMPK inhibition with Compound C maintained the number of adherent monocytes comparable with the control (Fig. 3, B and C). Interestingly, the monocyte binding in the Compound C-treated samples confirmed the role of HA in cell adhesion because enzymatic removal of HA and the exogenous high molecular mass HA added to treated cells reduced monocyte adhesion to near control levels. It is known that HA can modulate inflammation triggering TLR4 signaling (1Jiang D. Liang J. Noble P.W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 435-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) or can mediate immune cell adhesion on the endothelium or SMCs via CD44 (9Vigetti D. Genasetti A. Karousou E. Viola M. Moretto P.

The results of these experiments demonstrate that activation of AMPK in vitro inhibits proliferation, migration, and monocyte adhesion, thereby reducing AoSMC pro-atherosclerotic behaviors. Vessel thickening involves a plethora of causes partially still unknown, but ECM remodeling is one of the main events affecting vascular cells (33Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19370) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that administration of AICAR in vivo suppressed neointima formation after mechanical injury in the rat femoral artery, although no information was provided on ECM composition (34Nagata D. Takeda R. Sata M. Satonaka H. Suzuki E. Nagano T. Hirata Y. Circulation. 2004; 110: 444-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been known for decades that metformin can inhibit vascular complications of type 2 diabetes patients (35Kirpichnikov D. McFarlane S.I. Sowers J.R. Ann. Intern. Med. 2002; 137: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar), and AMPK has also been indicated as a therapeutic target for atherosclerosis and cancer (36Motoshima H. Goldstein B.J. Igata M. Araki E. J. Physiol. 2006; 574: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Therefore, in add"
https://openalex.org/W1686163441,"Electrons in two dimensions and strong magnetic fields effectively lose their kinetic energy and display exotic behavior dominated by Coulomb forces. When the ratio of electrons to magnetic flux quanta in the system is near 5/2, the unique correlated phase that emerges is predicted to be gapped with fractionally charged quasiparticles and a ground state degeneracy that grows exponentially as these quasiparticles are introduced. Interestingly, the only way to transform between the many ground states would be to braid the fractional excitations around each other, a property with applications in quantum information processing. Here we present the first observation of localized quasiparticles at nu=5/2, confined to puddles by disorder. Using a local electrometer to compare how quasiparticles at nu=5/2 and nu=7/3 charge these puddles, we are able to extract the ratio of local charges for these states. Averaged over several disorder configurations and samples, we find the ratio to be 4/3, suggesting that the local charges are e/3 at seven thirds and e/4 at five halves, in agreement with theoretical predictions. This confirmation of localized e/4 quasiparticles is necessary for proposed interferometry experiments to test statistics and computational ability of the state at nu=5/2."
https://openalex.org/W1983958620,"Ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) is a critical component of the 40 S ribosomal subunit that mediates translation initiation at the 5'-m(7)GpppG cap of mRNA. In response to mitogenic stimuli, rpS6 undergoes ordered C-terminal phosphorylation by p70 S6 kinases and p90 ribosomal S6 kinases on four conserved Ser residues (Ser-235, Ser-236, Ser-240, and Ser-244) whose modification potentiates rpS6 cap binding activity. A fifth site, Ser-247, is also known to be phosphorylated, but its function and regulation are not well characterized. In this study, we employed phospho-specific antibodies to show that Ser-247 is a target of the casein kinase 1 (CK1) family of protein kinases. CK1-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-247 was induced by mitogenic stimuli and required prior phosphorylation of upstream S6 kinase/ribosomal S6 kinase residues. CK1-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-247 also enhanced the phosphorylation of upstream sites, which implies that bidirectional synergy between C-terminal phospho-residues is required to sustain rpS6 phosphorylation. Consistent with this idea, CK1-dependent phosphorylation of rpS6 promotes its association with the mRNA cap-binding complex in vitro. Additionally, we show that protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) antagonizes rpS6 C terminus phosphorylation and cap binding in intact cells. These findings further our understanding of rpS6 phospho-regulation and define a direct link between CK1 and translation initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2118915833,"The pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS), both serious complications of dengue virus (DV) infection, remains unclear. In this study, we found that anti-DV NS1 (nonstructural protein 1) polyclonal antibodies cross-reacted with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We further identified a complex-specific mAb, DB16-1, which could recognize DV NS1 and cross-react with HUVECs and human blood vessels. The target protein of DB16-1 was further purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. LC-MS/MS analysis and co-immunoprecipitation revealed that the target protein of DB16-1 was human LYRIC (lysine-rich CEACAM1 co-isolated). Our newly generated anti-LYRIC mAbs bound to HUVECs in a pattern similar to that of DB16-1. The B-cell epitope of DB16-1 displayed a consensus motif, Lys-X-Trp-Gly (KXWG), which corresponded to amino acid residues 116-119 of DV NS1 and mimicked amino acid residues 334-337 in LYRIC. Moreover, the binding activity of DB16-1 in NS1 of DV-2 and in LYRIC disappeared after the KXWG epitope was deleted in each. In conclusion, DB16-1 targeted the same epitope in DV NS1 and LYRIC protein on human endothelial cells, suggesting that it might play a role in the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS. Future studies on the role of the anti-NS1 antibody in causing vascular permeability will undoubtedly be performed on sera collected from individuals before, during, and after the endothelial cell malfunction phase of a dengue illness."
https://openalex.org/W1964490122,"FXYD proteins are a family of seven small regulatory proteins, expressed in a tissue-specific manner, that associate with Na,K-ATPase as subsidiary subunits and modulate kinetic properties. This study describes an additional property of FXYD proteins as stabilizers of Na,K-ATPase. FXYD1 (phospholemman), FXYD2 (γ subunit), and FXYD4 (CHIF) have been expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and purified. These FXYD proteins associate spontaneously <i>in vitro</i> with detergent-soluble purified recombinant human Na,K-ATPase (α1β1) to form α1β1FXYD complexes. Compared with the control (α1β1), all three FXYD proteins strongly protect Na,K-ATPase activity against inactivation by heating or excess detergent (C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub>), with effectiveness FXYD1 > FXYD2 ≥ FXYD4. Heating also inactivates E<sub>1</sub> ↔ E<sub>2</sub> conformational changes and cation occlusion, and FXYD1 protects strongly. Incubation of α1β1 or α1β1FXYD complexes with guanidinium chloride (up to 6 m) causes protein unfolding, detected by changes in protein fluorescence, but FXYD proteins do not protect. Thus, general protein denaturation is not the cause of thermally mediated or detergent-mediated inactivation. By contrast, the experiments show that displacement of specifically bound phosphatidylserine is the primary cause of thermally mediated or detergent-mediated inactivation, and FXYD proteins stabilize phosphatidylserine-Na,K-ATPase interactions. Phosphatidylserine probably binds near trans-membrane segments M9 of the α subunit and the FXYD protein, which are in proximity. FXYD1, FXYD2, and FXYD4 co-expressed in HeLa cells with rat α1 protect strongly against thermal inactivation. Stabilization of Na,K-ATPase by three FXYD proteins in a mammalian cell membrane, as well the purified recombinant Na,K-ATPase, suggests that stabilization is a general property of FXYD proteins, consistent with a significant biological function."
https://openalex.org/W2019365096,"The observed number counts of high-redshift galaxy candidates have been used to build up a statistical description of star-forming activity at redshift z >~ 7, when galaxies reionized the Universe. Standard models predict that a high incidence of gravitational lensing will probably distort measurements of flux and number of these earliest galaxies. The raw probability of this happening has been estimated to be ~ 0.5 percent, but can be larger owing to observational biases. Here we report that gravitational lensing is likely to dominate the observed properties of galaxies with redshifts of z >~ 12, when the instrumental limiting magnitude is expected to be brighter than the characteristic magnitude of the galaxy sample. The number counts could be modified by an order of magnitude, with most galaxies being part of multiply imaged systems, located less than 1 arcsec from brighter foreground galaxies at z ~ 2. This lens-induced association of high-redshift and foreground galaxies has perhaps already been observed among a sample of galaxy candidates identified at z ~ 10.6. Future surveys will need to be designed to account for a significant gravitational lensing bias in high-redshift galaxy samples."

https://openalex.org/W2099228763,"The peptide neurotensin (NT) is known to exert a potent excitatory effect on the dopaminergic system by inhibiting D2 dopamine (DA) receptor (D2R) function. This regulation is dependent on activation of PKC, a well known effector of the type 1 NT receptor (NTR1). Because PKC phosphorylation of the D2R has recently been shown to induce its internalization, we hypothesized that NT acts to reduce D2R function through heterologous desensitization of the D2R. In the present study, we first used HEK-293 cells to demonstrate that NT induces PKC-dependent D2R internalization. Furthermore, internalization displayed faster kinetics in cells expressing the D2R short isoform, known to act as an autoreceptor in DA neurons, than in cells expressing the long isoform, known to act as a postsynaptic D2R. In patch clamp experiments on cultured DA neurons, overexpression of a mutant D2S lacking three key PKC phosphorylation sites abrogated the ability of NT to reduce D2R-mediated cell firing inhibition. Short interfering RNA-mediated inhibition of β-arrestin1 and dynamin2, proteins important for receptor desensitization, reduced agonist-induced desensitization of D2R function, but only the inhibition of β-arrestin1 reduced the effect of NT on D2R function. Taken together, our data suggest that NT acutely regulates D2 autoreceptor function and DA neuron excitability through PKC-mediated phosphorylation of the D2R, leading to heterologous receptor desensitization.

The major second messenger cascade triggered by NTR1 signaling involves activation of phospholipase C and the subsequent increase in intracellular calcium concentration, inositol-triphosphate production, and PKC activity, all of which have been linked to physiological effects of NT (7Wu T.

We have previously demonstrated that the regulation of D2R function by NT in cultured DA neurons requires PKC activity (27Jomphe C. Lemelin P.L. Okano H. Kobayashi K. Trudeau L.E. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2006; 24: 2789-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was also shown that the D2R can be directly phosphorylated by PKC, leading to agonist-independent functional desensitization and internalization of the membrane D2R (28Namkung Y. Sibley D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49533-49541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 29Morris S.J. Van-Ham II Daigle M. Robillard L. Sajedi N. Albert P.R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 577: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The goal of the present study was to assess whether NTR1 activation leads to PKC-induced D2R desensitization and to establish whether a mechanism of agonist-independent desensitization of the D2R could have any functional significance for the physiological effects of NT on DA neurons. Our results show that NTR1 activation can trigger PKC-dependent internalization of both short and long isoforms of D2R (D2S and D2L) in a transfected HEK-293 cell line. We also demonstrate that the effect of NT on D2R function in cultured DA neurons is strongly reduced by overexpression of a D2S receptor mutated on PKC phosphorylation sites that are critical for D2R desensitization and by siRNA-mediated down-regulation of β-arrestin1. HEK-293 cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) enriched with 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.5% Glutamax, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Upon reaching ∼80% confluence, the enriched medium was replaced with basic DMEM, and the cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1 plasmids containing the sequences of HA-tagged NTR1 (Missouri S&T cDNA Resource Center) and FLAG-tagged D2L or D2S using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). 24 h after transfection, HEK-293 cells were reseeded in enriched DMEM onto glass coverslips precoated with poly-l-lysine (Invitrogen). The next day, the enriched medium was removed, and cells were incubated with basic DMEM containing a rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody (1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min to allow binding to surface receptors, before being treated for 10 min with basic DMEM (vehicle), 10 μm quinpirole (Quin, specific D2R agonist, Sigma-Aldrich) or 10 nm NT (NT 8-13, active fragment, Sigma-Aldrich). After fixation, cells were incubated with a first secondary antibody (1:500, Alexa Fluor 633 anti-rabbit, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min, which labeled surface receptors (membrane signal). After washout of the first secondary antibody, cells were permeabilized in a 0.01% Triton X-100 solution and incubated with a second secondary antibody (1:500, Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit, Molecular Probes) for 30 min, which labeled both surface and internalized receptors (total signal = membrane + internalized). Images were acquired with a point-scanning confocal microscope (Prairie Technologies) equipped with argon and helium/neon lasers. Internalization was then quantified cell by cell from images processed with NIH ImageJ software by subtracting the membrane signal from the total signal and expressed as a percentage of the total signal of each individual transfected cell. Statistical analysis was performed with a one-way ANOVA followed with Tukey's multiple comparison tests. HEK-293 cells transfected with the D2S, NTR1, and Rab5-GFP plasmids were handled identically to the internalization assay protocol described above, with a labeling of surface D2S on live cells and a subsequent 10-min drug treatment. After fixation and permeabilization, cells were incubated with a goat polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (1:1000, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) and then with secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 anti-goat and Alexa Fluor 546 anti-rabbit, 1:500 each, Molecular Probes). Images were acquired with a laser scanning confocal microscope (FV1000 MPE, Olympus) equipped with multi-argon and helium/neon lasers. D2S-Rab5 colocalization was measured with the “Mander's coefficient” plug-in of the ImageJ software. The Pearson correlation coefficient obtained for each image from the different treatment groups were averaged and statistically analyzed with a one-way ANOVA followed with Tukey's multiple comparison tests. 24 h after transfection, HEK-293 cells were resuspended in enriched medium and reseeded into 24-well plates precoated with poly-l-lysine. After an overnight incubation, the enriched medium was removed, and the cells were washed with basic DMEM (vehicle) or 10 μm chelerythrine (CHE, Sigma-Aldrich), a wide spectrum PKC inhibitor, for 30 min. The cells were then treated with 10 μm quinpirole and/or 10 nm NT for different time periods. Receptor trafficking was stopped by addition of ice-cold PBS for 5 min, following which cells were rinsed and fixed in 3% PFA for 20 min. Membrane immunoreactivity of the D2R was revealed by incubation for one hour with an anti-FLAG primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal, 1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich) and for 30 min with HRP-coupled secondary antibody (1:5000, Amersham Biosciences). After antibody incubations and PBS washes, the HRP substrate o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (SIGMAFAST OPD, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each well, and the reaction was stopped after 15 min by addition of 3 n HCl. 200 μl from each well was then transferred to a 96-well plate for subsequent absorbance readings at 490 nm on a Wallac Victor2 1420 multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Each experiment had two different internal controls consisting of untreated transfected cells (100% membrane signal value, set as time 0) and untreated non-transfected cells (nonspecific labeling). Specific membrane immunoreactivity value was calculated by subtracting the intensity level of wells seeded with nontransfected cells, and the signal from treated transfected cells was expressed as a percentage of the intensity level of wells containing untreated transfected cells. Values were always obtained and averaged in triplicate, and statistical analyses were performed by two-way repeated measure ANOVAs followed with Bonferroni multiple comparison tests to compare the membrane signal measured at different time points following vehicle or CHE pretreatments. Mesencephalic DA neuron primary culture was prepared according to a protocol described in earlier publications (27Jomphe C. Lemelin P.L. Okano H. Kobayashi K. Trudeau L.E. Eur. J.

These cultures were maintained in Neurobasal medium enriched with 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% Glutamax, 2% B-27 supplement, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). For plasmid transfections, 3-day-old neuron cultures were co-transfected with pcDNA3 plasmids containing sequences for the DsRed protein and either the D2S-FLAG (D2S-WT) or a D2S-mutant (triple mutant T225A,S228G,S229G) (29Morris S.J. Van-Ham II Daigle M. Robillard L. Sajedi N. Albert P.R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 577: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) for a total of 4 μg of DNA per coverslip by means of calcium phosphate co-precipitation. RT-PCR was first performed to verify the presence of each RNA of interest in DA neuron cultures at the appropriate time (7–12 days in vitro). In all cases, total mRNA was extracted from neuronal culture coverslips using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol and dissolved in RNase-free water. cDNA synthesis was performed with 0.5 mm deoxynucleotide triphosphate mix (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), 2.5 μm random hexamers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 500 ng of total RNA, 10 mm DTT, 40 units of RNaseOUT, 200 units of Moloney-murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), 50 mm Tris-HCl, 75 mm KCl, and 3 mm MgCl2, pH 8.3. For transfections with siRNA, 7-day-old neuron cultures were transfected with a total of 40 or 60 pmol of siRNAs per coverslip using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's guidelines (Invitrogen). Controls consisted in cultures transfected with a Cy-3-labeled scramble siRNA sequence (Ambion, Austin, TX). Knockdown of target mRNA was then assessed by RT-PCR on whole coverslip extracts at 24, 48, and 72 h post-transfection (8–10 days in vitro). Primers and oligonucleotides (synthesized by Alpha DNA, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) were designed to amplify each specific sequence by RT-PCR and to synthesize siRNAs, respectively, using a kit (Ambion). Sequences for β-arrestin1 (β-arr1), β-arrestin2 (β-arr2), dynamin1 (Dyn1), and dynamin2 (Dyn2) mRNAs were obtained from the Entrez Nucleotides mouse database. PCR primers were as follows (left primers followed by right primers): β-arr1, 5′-gagtctacgtgacactgacctg-3′ and 5′-ctcaggggcatactgaacctt-3′; β-arr2, 5′-aagtcgagccctaactgcaa-3′ and 5′-cagctctttgtccagggaag-3′; Dyn1, 5′-ttgtgctgactgctgagaatc-3′ and 5′-ctccttcagtgcgtggtaca-3′; and Dyn2, 5′-gccatacccaatcagggggaga-3′ and 5′-cccacaggcataggaatcagggga-3′. The oligonucleotides sequences for siRNA synthesis were as follows (sense oligonucleotides followed by antisense oligonucleotides): β-arr1, 5′-aagcacttgtactgagctgtgcctgtctc-3′ and 5′-aacacagctcagtacaagtgccctgtctc-3′; Dyn1, 5′-aaatccttgtaccaggacagacctgtctc-3′ and 5′-aatctgtcctggtacaaggatcctgtctc-3′; and Dyn2, 5′-aaacaactctagtgtgtctaccctgtctc-3′ and 5′-aagtagacacactagagttgtcctgtctc-3′. Neuron culture coverslips of 7 days (plasmid transfection) or 9–11 days (siRNA transfection) in culture were positioned in a recording chamber affixed to the stage of an inverted Nikon Eclipse TE-200 fluorescent microscope and gravitationally perfused with a physiological saline solution composed of the following: 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2; 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 6 mm sucrose, 10 mm glucose. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed on GFP-expressing neurons using borosilicate pipettes (5.5–6.5 megohms) filled with an intrapipette solution composed of the following: 145 mm KMeSO4, 20 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm ATP (magnesium salt), 0.6 mm GTP (Tris salt), 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm phosphocreatine, pH 7.35. The signal was amplified by a Warner PC-505 amplifier, filtered at 1 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz, and analyzed with pClamp8 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The spontaneous firing rate was recorded and analyzed off-line using MiniAnalysis software (Synaptosoft, Fort Lee, NJ). The threshold for spike detection was set to 30 mV. In every case, the maximal effect of Quin (1 μm) on the spontaneous firing rate of DA neurons was calculated by comparing the number of spikes during the minute of maximal effect with the 2-min baseline period. To measure the desensitization of D2R function, patched DA neurons were treated with Quin for a prolonged period of eight consecutive minutes. The mean maximal effect of Quin on firing rate was compared with the average rate of minutes 4 to 6 after the beginning of treatment. A rejection criterion was set as to keep for further analysis only neurons that showed a minimum of 50% reduction in firing in response to Quin. To measure the effect NT on D2R function, patched DA neurons were first exposed to Quin for 2 min to measure D2R-mediated firing rate inhibition (and to exclude nonresponsive neurons), washed for 6 min, treated with NT (1 nm) for 3 min, and finally exposed again to Quin in the presence of NT (Quin+NT). A second rejection criterion was set to exclude unstable neurons that did not show recovery of at least 50% of their initial firing rate by the end of the second Quin washout period. Neurons from control, plasmid, and siRNA transfection groups all displayed similar basal firing rate and spike amplitude (data not shown). Typical membrane resistance of recorded DA neurons ranged from ∼150 to 400 megohms. Statistical analysis was performed by a two-way repeated-measure ANOVAs followed by Bonferroni multiple comparison tests. We first used HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with both NTR1 and FLAG-tagged short isoform D2R (D2S-WT) receptors to test whether NTR1 activation triggers D2R internalization. As a first approach, we detected D2R internalization by immunofluorescence using a strategy involving membrane labeling of the D2S prior to treatment and incubation of cells with different secondary antibodies before and after cell permeabilization (Fig. 1A). Cells treated with Quin (10 μm) or NT (10 nm) alone both showed equivalent D2S internalization after 10 min (28.9 ± 5.0 and 26.5 ± 3.5%, respectively; n = 29 cells for Quin and 37 for NT, Fig. 1B). On the other hand, co-application of Quin and NT (Quin+NT) produced a significantly greater internalization (50.6 ± 3.4%; n = 36) compared with Quin or NT alone, suggesting an additive effect of the drugs after 10 min of treatment. To confirm that the D2S was readily internalized through a typical endocytotic route, we performed a similar membrane labeling experiment in HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with Rab5-GFP, an early endosomal protein (37Stenmark H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 513-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (2186) Google Scholar), in addition to the NTR1 and D2S-WT receptors (Fig. 1C). Our analysis showed a significant increase in the Pearson correlation coefficient of the Rab5 and D2S signals, compared with control following a 10-min treatment with Quin (10 μm), NT (10 nm), or both; this can be interpreted as an increase in Rab5-D2S colocalization (−0.052 ± 0.019 for control, 0.203 ± 0.032 for Quin, 0.115 ± 0.041 for NT, and 0.201 ± 0.049 for Quin+NT). Thus, NTR1 activation seems to trigger D2S internalization by endocytosis in HEK-293 cells. As a second strategy to confirm our initial findings and to gain insight into the time course of receptor internalization, we used an ELISA approach quantifying the decrease in membrane immunoreactivity induced by drug treatment at different time points. Because PKC is a major component of the NTR1 signaling cascade and was shown to induce D2R internalization via direct receptor phosphorylation (28Namkung Y. Sibley D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49533-49541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we used CHE, a wide-spectrum PKC inhibitor, to test the hypothesis that NT-induced D2R internalization requires PKC activity. Compared with controls, set to a membrane signal value of 100%, the D2S membrane signal decreased to a value of 80.2 ± 2.1% (n = 5 experiments) after 5 min of treatment with Quin following a 30-min pretreatment with vehicle (Fig. 2A, black curve). Cells that were treated with Quin for 5 min after pretreatment with CHE (10 μm) displayed a similar level of receptor internalization (80.1 ± 1.4% of control; n = 4), showing that agonist-induced homologous D2S internalization is PKC-independent. In both cases, Quin-induced reduction in membrane signal reached a plateau value after 5 min and remained constant during the entire treatment period. In cells pretreated with vehicle, NT induced more extensive internalization of D2S, with cell surface signal reaching 57.6 ± 6.8% of control (n = 5) after 5 min (Fig. 2B, black curve); the signal came back to 74.7 ± 2.4% of control (n = 5) at 10 min. In cells pretreated with CHE, NT failed to induce any change in membrane D2S signal (Fig. 2B, gray curve), which was significantly different from the NT group with vehicle pretreatment (Fig. 2B, black curve; p = 0.0003); all time points were statistically different between the two conditions (p < 0.01 or lower, Bonferroni post-test), clearly showing that NT-induced D2S internalization is PKC-dependent. Co-treatment with both Quin and NT together (Quin+NT, Fig. 2C, black curve) produced a large reduction in membrane signal at 5 min (50.5 ± 8.8% of control; n = 5), which persisted after 10 min (53.7 ± 3.8%) and rose back to 70.2 ± 3.0% of control (n = 5) after 15 min. Following CHE pretreatment, Quin and NT co-application still caused a decrease in membrane D2S signal (Fig. 2C, gray curve), but with a pattern of internalization that was similar to that induced by Quin alone. Membrane signal from the Quin+NT-treated cells after vehicle or CHE pretreatment were significantly different overall (p = 0.0069), but post hoc tests confirmed that only the 5- and 10-min time points differed (p < 0.01 for both). Overall, these results show that although PKC is not required for agonist-dependent D2S internalization, this kinase is necessary for NT-induced D2S internalization through a mechanism that seems additive to Quin-induced internalization only within the first 10 min of treatment in transfected HEK-293. Because prior studies have reported that rapid (2 min) uncoupling of D2L is less sensitive to PKC phosphorylation than D2S (29Morris S.J. Van-Ham II Daigle M. Robillard L. Sajedi N. Albert P.R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 577: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 38Liu Y.F. Civelli O. Grandy D.K. Albert P.R. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 2311-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we also examined the ability of NT to regulate D2L internalization in ELISA experiments with transfected HEK-293 cells. Similar to our results with D2S, pretreatment with the PKC inhibitor CHE failed to interfere with Quin-induced D2L internalization (Fig. 2D; p = 0.8645) but prevented NT-induced D2L internalization (Fig. 2E; p = 0.0003). Interestingly, the amplitude and kinetics of D2L internalization in response to NT or Quin+NT co-application were different than for D2S (Fig. 2, E and F): the peak reduction in membrane D2S seen after 5 min of NT was not present for the D2L, reaching only 80.8 ± 3.9% of control in response to NT and 72.7 ± 1.7% of control in response to Quin+NT. Pretreatment with CHE also altered the response to Quin+NT co-application (Fig. 2F; p = 0.0267), but post hoc analysis revealed that this was only due to a difference at 30 and 60 min (p < 0.01 and 0.05, respectively), where Quin and NT seem to produce additive effects. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that activation of NTR1 by NT can trigger D2S and D2L internalization in a PKC-dependent manner in transfected HEK-293 cells, although the kinetics of the PKC-dependent response of D2S and D2L in the combined agonist treatments were partially different. We next examined cultured DA neurons to extend our conclusions to a cellular context in which NTR1 and D2R are normally co-expressed. For these experiments, primary postnatal cultures were prepared from TH-GFP transgenic mice, thus facilitating identification of DA neurons for patch clamp recordings. Considering that PKC has been shown to phosphorylate D2R directly, leading to its functional desensitization and internalization (28Namkung Y. Sibley D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49533-49541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 29Morris S.J. Van-Ham II Daigle M. Robillard L. Sajedi N. Albert P.R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 577: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and that PKC activity is necessary for the ability of NT to reduce D2R in DA neurons (27Jomphe C. Lemelin P.L. Okano H. Kobayashi K. Trudeau L.E. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2006; 24: 2789-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that mutation of D2R PKC phosphorylation sites should prevent the ability of NT to reduce D2R-mediated firing rate inhibition. To test this hypothesis, we used a previously characterized D2S construct in which three key PKC phosphorylation sites specifically required for PKC-induced internalization of the D2R have been mutated (D2S triple mutant T225A,S228G,S229G) (28Namkung Y. Sibley D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49533-49541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 29Morris S.J. Van-Ham II Daigle M. Robillard L. Sajedi N. Albert P.R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 577: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Our results show that overexpression of this construct in DA neurons, acting as a dominant negative to compete with endogenous D2Rs (Fig. 3A), produced a complete blockade of the ability of NT to reduce D2R agonist (Quin)-mediated inhibition of cell firing (Fig. 3D). Indeed, in control cultures transfected with wild-type D2S (D2S-WT), NT strongly reduced the ability of Quin to inhibit spontaneous firing (84.9 ± 8.0% when applied alone, compared with a 54.1 ± 6.9% reduction after NT; Fig. 3B; p < 0.01; two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test; n = 7).

SEB is one of the most potent superantigens known and treatment of SEB induced shock remains a challenge. We generated and characterized murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to SEB in mice. We tested mAbs neutralize mitogenic effects of SEB in vitro and in vivo with T-cell proliferation assays and 2 murine models for SEB induced lethal shock (SEBILS). Epitope mapping suggests that all these mAbs recognize conformational epitopes that are destroyed by deleting the C terminus of the protein. Further site-directed mutagenesis identified potential residues involved in binding to SEB that differ between Methicillin resistant and sensitive Staphylococcus aureus strains. Only mAb 20B1 was effective as a monotherapy in treating SEBILS in HLA DR3 transgenic mice, which exhibit enhanced sensitivity to SEB. It is noteworthy that mAbs, 14G8 and 6D3 were not protective when given alone in the HLA DR3 mice but their efficacy of protection could be greatly enhanced when mAbs were co-administered simultaneously. Our data suggest combinations of defined mAbs may constitute a better treatment strategy and provide a new insight for the development of passive immunotherapy.

Shafer W.M. Infect. Immun. 1977; 16: 610-616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) is a well characterized 28 kDa protein that is related to SEC1–3 on the basis of sequence homology (1Iandolo J.J. Shafer W.M. Infect. Immun. 1977; 16: 610-616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Swaminathan S. Furey W. Pletcher J. Sax M. Nature. 1992; 359: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). SEB is a superantigen that triggers cytokine production and T-cell proliferation by cross-linking MHC class II molecules on antigen presenting cells and T-cell receptors (TCR) (2Swaminathan S. Furey W. Pletcher J. Sax M. Nature. 1992; 359: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 3Kappler J.W. Herman A. Clements J. Marrack P. J. Exp.

SEB is the major enterotoxin associated with non-menstrual toxic shock syndrome and accounts for the majority of intoxications that are not caused by toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1). In addition, some reports indicate that SEB induces an IgE response and thereby might contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma, chronic rhinitis, and dermatitis (6Bachert C. Zhang N. Patou J. van Zele T. Gevaert P. Curr. Opin. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2008; 8: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 7Liu T. Kong W. Yang P. Wang B. J. Huazhong. Univ. Sci. Technolog. Med.

Maxwell J.R. Vella A.T. Int. Immunol. 2004; 16: 1751-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). SEB is considered a select agent. The quantities needed to produce a desired effect are much lower than with synthetic chemicals. Also SEB can be easily produced in large quantities (10Ulrich R.G. Sidell S. Taylor T.J. Wilhelmsen C.L. Franz D.R. Textbook of Military Medicine: Medical Aspects of Chemical and Biological Warfare. Borden Institute, Washington D. C2001Google Scholar). Currently there are no therapies available for treating enterotoxin-induced shock, but clinical data suggests that immunoglobulins can alleviate disease (11Darenberg J. Söderquist B. Normark B.H. Norrby-Teglund A. Clin Infect. Dis. 2004; 38: 836-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Moreover, passive administration of pooled human immunoglobulin, as well as murine and chicken antibodies (Abs) can protect against SEB induced lethal shock (SEBILS) in murine and primate animal models as well as against SEB triggered release of cytokines by SEB stimulated T-cells (12Bavari S. Ulrich R.G. LeClaire R.D. J. Infect. Dis. 1999; 180: 1365-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 13Hamad A.R. Herman A. Marrack P. Kappler J.W. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The efficacy of humoral immunity in protection against SEB was established by demonstrating an inverse relationship between susceptibility and antibody (Ab) titer (13Hamad A.R. Herman A. Marrack P.

The C terminus of the protein has been proposed to be the predominant epitope recognized by human B-cells (20Nishi J.I. Kanekura S. Takei S. Kitajima I. Nakajima T. Wahid M.R. Masuda K. Yoshinaga M. Maruyama I. Miyata K. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 247-254PubMed Google Scholar). We generated and characterized murine mAbs to SEB. We investigated their toxin neutralizing efficacy in two murine models of SEBILS. Site-directed mutagenesis provide new insight into the complexity of the epitope, and neutralization studies in murine models highlight ways to decrease dose and improve efficacy. The toxins SEA, SEB, and TSST-1 were purchased from Toxin Technology (Sarasota, FL) in accordance with CDC biosafety regulations. Recombinant full-length SEB and SEB deletion mutants were generated in compliance with 42CFR Parts 72, 73, and health and safety regulations. The commercially available SEB toxin is derived from a methicillin-sensitive S. aureus strain (MSSA). mAbs to SEB were generated from SEB-immunized BALB/c mice in the Hybridoma Facility of Albert Einstein College of Medicine (AECOM) as described. All mice were immunized with full-length SEB (MSSA derived) in complete Freund adjuvans (CFA). The mouse with the highest Ab titer to SEB was selected for spleen harvest and hybridoma generation. Hybridoma supernatants were screened for reactivity to SEB by ELISA, with positive reactivity being defined as absorbance 3-fold higher than background. Four mAbs, 20B1, 14G8, 6D3, and 4C7 were selected and used in this study. Specificity of mAb for SEB was determined by Western blot according to standard methods with purified SEA, SEB, and TSST-1. T-cells were isolated from donor blood using RosetteSep CD4+ T-cell enrichment mixture (Stemcell Tech) and T- cell proliferation was measured using the ViaLight HS Cell Proliferation kit (Cambrex BioScience), both according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, T-cells (5 × 104/ well) were stimulated in 96 well culture plates with 100 pm of purified SEB (Toxin Technology). SEB-specific mAbs (500 nm) were added concurrently with SEB. Cells were incubated at 37 °C with 10% CO2 for 48 and 96 h. Next, 100 μl per well of nucleotide releasing reagent was added and incubated for 10 min to lyse cells followed by 20 μl of ATP monitoring reagent. The plates were immediately read with 1s integrated read times. For cytokine induction assays, purified T-cells were mixed 1:1 with donor matched PBMCs. Supernatants were removed after 8 h of co-incubation with SEB and mAbs and measured by ELISA for human IL-2 and IFN-γ (21Cook E. Wang X. Robiou N. Fries B.C. Clin Vaccine Immunol. 2007; 14: 1094-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from hybridoma culture cells with a Qiagen RNeasy kit and cDNA was prepared using Superscript II (Invitrogen). Amplification of variable regions was done by PCR using previously published primers (22Dattamajumdar A.K. Jacobson D.P. Hood L.E. Osman G.E. Immunogenetics. 1996; 43: 141-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting amplification products were gel purified and sequenced in both directions using M13 primers. Sequence was analyzed using BLAST 2 sequence and amino acid sequence was generated using the program “Translate” from ExPASy proteomic server. The sequences obtained for heavy and light chain V regions were further analyzed for homologous germline variable region genes in the database using IMGT (International ImMunoGeneTics Information System) software program. The AID generated SHM of Immunoglobulin variable (V) regions was analyzed by SHM tool webserver (23MacCarthy T. Roa S. Scharff M.D. Bergman A. DNA Repair. 2009; 8: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of SEB gene in clinical MSSA and methicillin-resistant (MRSA) S. aureus isolates was performed by isolating DNA by Qiagen DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. PCR amplification of the SEB gene was done using specific primers (SEB-for 5′-GAGAGTCAACCAGATCCTAA-3′ and SEB-rev 5′-GCAGGTACTCTATAAGTGCCTGC). Purified PCR products were ligated into TOPO-TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) and transformed in Top-10 E. coli competent cells and purified by standard methods for sequencing. Sequences were aligned in ClustalW with SEB gene sequence of S. aureus (M11118). Full-length SEB gene from MRSA and MSSA encoding the residues 1–239 and SEB deletion mutants 1–7 were subcloned into H-MBP-T vector (24Alexandrov A. Dutta K. Pascal S.M. BioTechniques. 2001; 30: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) using the primers shown in the supplemental materials. H-MBP-T-SEB plasmid was then transformed into Escherichia coli BL-21(DE3) Codon Plus (Stratagene) cells for protein expression. Cells were grown for ∼18 h at 15 °C in LB media after inducing with 0.5 mm IPTG at 0.6 OD. Cells were harvested and re-suspended in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5 and lysed with 1× BugBuster. The clear supernatant was incubated with 5 ml of Talon affinity resin (Clontech) for 1 h. The resin was washed with the lysis buffer and the fusion protein was eluted with the lysis buffer supplemented with 200 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was digested with thrombin overnight at 4 °C to cleave the H-MBP fusion tag and the excess imidazole was removed by dialysis into 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The fusion tag and other impurities were removed by using a HiTrap Q Sepharose ion-exchange column (GE HealthCare). The fractions, which contained SEB, were pooled and passed through a size exclusion column pre-equilibrated with buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5) to remove high molecular weight soluble aggregates. The protein was found to be >99% pure by SDS-PAGE. Similarly, all other deletion mutants were cloned into H-MBP-T vector and expressed and purified as mentioned above. Full-length SEB, mutant-1 and mutant-2 proteins were successfully expressed as soluble fraction, however mutants 3–7 expressed as insoluble fraction. Selected amino acids residues on SEB were mutated by site-directed mutagenesis using Quickchange XL Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Based on computer-assisted modeling, we gave precedence to positions where the residues are hydrogen bonded between the backbone C-terminal residues. Fig. 10, A and B shows the expanded view of the β-sheet formed by the three strands. To avoid disrupting the overall folding of SEB, 7 AA positions were mutated to alanine, 135-Arg, 137-Phe, 186-Tyr, 188-Lys, 229-Lys, 231-Glu, 233-Tyr. We also generated mutant-MRSA by adding an extra residue (T) at base position 703. PCR primers were designed using QuickChange® Primer Design Program and PCR was conducted according to manufacturer's instructions. Purified PCR products of mutated clones were ligated into H-MBP-T vector and transformed into Escherichia coli XL-10 gold cells. Substitution of amino acids in all mutant constructs was confirmed by sequencing. Expression and purification of mutant SEBs were done as described above.FIGURE 1Western blot analysis of mAbs 20B1, 14G8, 6D3, and 4C7 shows specificity of mAbs for SEB and not for SEA and TSST.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The crude induced and uninduced lysates of SEB, mutant 1–3 and single point mutation proteins were dissolved in 30 μl of sample loading buffer and boiled for 10 min. After centrifugation for 30 s, the proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under denaturaing condition and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. For immunoblotting, the proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the fractionated proteins were transferred from the gel onto the PVDF membrane (Millipore) in a semi-dry transblot apparatus. The membrane was blocked in blocking buffer (1× PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 5% milk) for 2 h. The blots were washed and incubated with 1:20,000 dilution of 10 μg/μl concentration mAbs (20B1 or 14G8 or 6D3) for 45 min. Later, the blots were washed twice in PBST and one in PBS and further incubated for 45 min with HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000). After washing, development was performed by chemiluminescence method according to manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Scientific). Further binding to mutant proteins and C-terminal decapeptide were investigated under native conditions using dot blot analysis. Briefly 2 μg of synthesized 10-mer peptide (Genscript Corporation), SEB and the mutant-1 and 2 protein were spotted onto the nitrocellulose membrane and dried for 10 min. Membranes were further blocked by soaking in blocking buffer for 2 h. Membranes were washed with PBST twice and incubated with 1:10,000 dilution of 10 μg/μl concentration mAbs (20B1 or 14G8 or 6D3) for 45 min. Blots were further washed with PBST twice and incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG1 (1:10,000) and developed as before. Standard ELISA to measure SEB concentration was performed as described (21Cook E. Wang X. Robiou N. Fries B.C. Clin Vaccine Immunol. 2007; 14: 1094-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To establish relative affinity of mAbs decreasing levels of mAb (0.1–0.001 μg) as well as decreasing levels of SEB toxin (0.1 and 0.001 μg) were used in ELISA assay. ELISA was performed with WT-SEB and purified SEB mutants protein (1 and 2) and point mutation proteins by coating the plate with purified protein, followed by unlabeled mAbs 20B1 or 14G8 or 6D3 or 4C7, which further binds to AP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG1 and was developed by PNPP tablets. A modified competition ELISA was done to determine if two mAbs could bind to SEB simultaneously. This assay involved coating the plate with anti-IgG1 Ab, followed by unlabeled SEB specific mAb (mAbs 20B1 or 6D3 or 14G8 or 4C7) and SEB Ag. After washing another mAb (mAbs 14G8 or 6D3 or 20B1 or 4C7) was added and incubated for 1 h and further captured with a labeled anti-mouse IgG1. Alternatively, this ELISA was also performed with directly labeled mAbs. All animal experiments were carried out with the approval of the Animal Institute Committee (AIC), in accordance with the rules and regulations set forth by the AECOM AIC. Protective efficacy of mAbs was tested in 2 murine models for SEBILS. BALB/c mice, injected intraperitoneal with 25 mg of d-galactosamine in PBS, followed by 20 μg of purified SEB (Toxin technology) die with 48 h. Transgenic mice expressing HLA-DR3 in the absence of endogenous MHC class II (a generous gift of Dr. David Chella, Mayo Clinic) were injected intraperitoneal with two doses of 50 μg of SEB 48 h apart and die within 4–5 days. To test protective efficacy, mice were injected intraperitoneal once with different doses of mAbs 20B1, 14G8, 6D3, and 4C7, or in combinations 10 min prior to administration of SEB. Control mice were treated with PBS, isotype-specific mAb 18B7 or NSO ascites, which was made by injecting mice with the myeloma cell partner NSO and thus provides an ascites control without specific antibodies. Murine blood was obtained from retro-orbital bleeding at 2, 8, and 24 h post-toxin injection according to animal institute guidelines as outlined by AIC. Serum was separated by centrifugation from clotted blood at 3000 rpm × 10 min and frozen prior to measurement by ELISA. All mice immunized with full-length SEB (MSSA-derived) in CFA responded to immunization. Eleven hybridomas were successfully stabilized after two soft agar cloning steps that allowed selection for efficient Ab producers with strong binding to SEB. To identify good candidates that could be further developed as potential therapeutic reagents, hybridomas were characterized for isotype and protective efficacy in vivo in BALB/c mice co-injected with SEB and d-galactosamine (Table 1). d-Galactosamine potentiates the SEB effect in mice, which by nature are resistant to SEB. These experiments identified 3 mAbs that conveyed protection, 5 mAbs that conveyed partial protection and 3 mAbs that exhibited no protection against SEBILS. We focused on four IgG1 mAbs (20B1, 6D3, 14G8, and 4C7), which showed different degrees of protection. Their respective hybridomas had good in vitro growth parameters. Furthermore, IgGs have a long serum half-life time, which makes them suitable candidates for in vivo application.TABLE 1List of SEB-specific mAbs and their efficacy to protect against SEBILS in vivomAbIsotypeProtection in vivo (BALB/c)20B1IgG1100%6D3IgG140–60%3B4IgM100%10F1IgA100%14G8IgG10%14B9IgG2a60%11B4IgG2a60%17C12IgG2a60%4D4IgG120%12A1IgG120%4C7IgG10% Open table in a new tab Specificity of mAbs for SEB was evaluated by their binding to SEA, SEB, and TSST-1. Western blot analysis showed that mAbs 20B1 14G8, 4C7, and 6D3 bound to SEB but not to SEA or TSST-1 (Fig. 1). Sequence analysis of SEB genes derived from 9 MRSA and 3 MSSA clinical isolates was performed and compared with the SEB sequence of MSSA strain M11118. An additional nucleotide was found at position 703 in all MRSA but not in any MSSA strain. This addition results in three amino acid changes at positions 235, 236, and 238 (tyrosine-threonine, asparagine-threonine, and glutamine-lysine) (Fig. 2). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and spa typing assigned all 9 MRSA isolates to CC8 spa7 type whereas the MSSA strains were assigned to CC5 spa2, CC8 spa 139, and CC8 spa7 type. The germ line genes encoding 3 of the 4 mAbs are shown in Table 2. These data demonstrate that each of the 3 mAbs studied were different. The heavy chain V region sequence (VH) of 14G8 and 6D3 is identical to the IGHV5–6-3*1 family member whereas the mAb 20B1 VH was identical to the sequence of IGHV5–9-3*1 family member. The light chain V sequence (VL) was different for each of the 3 mAbs and contains mutations of 5 (20B1), 4 (14G8), and 6 residues (6D3) when compared with IGKV9–124*01, IGKV5–39*01 and IGKV8–19*01 germline kappa sequences, respectively. All 3 mAbs used the same J segment genes for the VH and different J segments in the VL. To test if the activation-induced deaminase (AID) and Pol-η mediated error prone repair contributed to somatic hypermutation (SHM) observed in the VL sequence, further analysis was done using SHM tool. The results showed that 67, 40, and 90% of the mutations are in AID and Pol-η associated hotspots in the VL regions of mAbs 20B1, 14G8, and 6D3, respectively (Table 3).TABLE 2Identification of germline variable region genes for the SEB-specific mAbsmAbVH geneVH familyJH geneD geneVL familyVL geneJL gene20B1AJ851868IGHV5–9-3*01IGHJ1*01IGHD3–2*02IGKV9–124*01AF003294IGKJ1*0114G8AJ851868IGHV5–6-3*01IGHJ1*01IGHD3–2*02IGKV5–39*01AJ235964IGKJ2*016D3AJ851868IGHV5–6-3*01IGHJ1*01IGHD3–2*02IGKV8–19*01Y15980IGKJ5*01 Open table in a new tab TABLE 3Percentage of mutations located in AID and Pol η associated hotspots20B1-VL region (6 mutations)14G8-VL region (10 mutations)6D3-VL region (10 mutations)AIDHotspotWRC003 (30%)GYW3 (50%)1 (10%)2 (20%)ColdspotSYC000GRS02 (20%)0Pol η HotspotWA004 (40%)TW1 (16%)3 (30%)0 Open table in a new tab SEB acts as a potent T-cell mitogen that binds to the Vβ chain of the TCR and induces T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. Because the human MHC-II complex has the highest affinity for SEB, humans are more sensitive than mice. Therefore, neutralizing efficacy was also tested in vitro in human T-cells. The effect of SEB-specific mAbs alone or in combination on SEB induced T-cell proliferation and cytokine production in human T-cells from a normal donor was measured. MAbs 20B1, 14G8, and 6D3 each demonstrated comparable levels of inhibition of SEB induced T-cell proliferation after 48 and 96 h (Fig. 3, A and B) whereas the effect of 4C7 treatment was only half that of the positive controls. Inhibition of cytokine induction was also measured after 8 h and as expected T-cells produced less IFN-γ (Fig. 3C) and IL-2 (Fig. 3D) if treated with SEB specific mAb when compared with untreated T-cells. These assays also demonstrated comparable inhibition of IFN-γ by mAbs including 4C7. Inhibition of IL-2 excretion was less complete and not observed in mAb 4C7-treated T-cells. Enhanced inhibition of T-cell proliferation and IL-2 production could not be shown for when mAbs were used in combination, however mAb 4C7 used in combination with mAb 20B1 lessened the potent neutralizing effect of mAb 20B1. Next, the protective efficacy of mAbs 20B1, 14G8, 6D3 and 4C7 mAbs was explored in vivo in two different models of SEBILS, one in BALB/c and the other in HLA-DR3 transgenic mice. In contrast to in vitro assays, these animal experiments demonstrated significant differences in toxin neutralization for the different mAbs as well as for combinations of mAbs. Protection also differed between the two models. Two of the four mAbs (6D3 and 20B1) demonstrated consistent levels of protection in the d-galactosamine potentiated BALB/c model (Fig. 4A). Treatment with doses of mAb 20B1 as low as 100 μg per mouse conveyed protection (Fig. 4B). Enhanced protection was observed when mAb 20B1 was given in combination with mAbs 6D3 or 14G8 in doses as low as 50 μg, which were not protective when used as monotherapy. In the BALB/c model 20B1 demonstrated superior efficacy compared with 6D3, which was less protective when used alone in HLA-DR3 (Fig. 4C). MAbs 14G8 and 4C7 treatment did not protect mice from SEBILS in either mouse model. However, mAb14G8 enhanced protection when used in combination with mAb 20B1 or 6D3 in HLA-DR3 as well as in BALB/c mice whereas 4C7 lowered the efficacy of mAb 20B1 in a manner analogous to that observed for in vitro neutralization assays. In the HLA-DR3 model combination of two non-protective mAbs resulted in 60–100% protection whereas treatment with either one of the mAb could not protect mice from SEBILS (Fig. 4D). Lastly, we also investigated the protective efficacy of mAbs in mice that were injected with MRSA-derived SEB protein. These mice died in the same time frame as those injected with MSSA derived SEB. Although these mice were protected by treatment with mAbs 20B1, efficacy was decreased as low doses of 100 μg could not convey protection whereas they did when mice were injected with MSSA-derived SEB (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5Protection against MRSA-derived SEB protein induced lethal shock was also determined in BALB/c mice by treatment with mAb 20B1 (p = 0. 0109). n = 10 each group. Analysis of survival data were performed using Mantel-Cox Test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SEB serum levels measured by ELISA were consistently higher in mice (both murine models), treated with mAbs compared with non-treated control mice (Fig. 6, A and B). Of note, SEB serum levels in mice correlated with protection. Treatment with one mAb did not interfere with the accurate quantification of SEB in serum but quantification could not be accurately carried out in the setting of combination therapy. First, the capture ELISA was modified to determine if mAbs recognized distinct epitopes. The results demonstrated that mAbs 20B1, 14G8, and 6D3 each recognized different epitopes and thus can bind in any combination of two of the three mAbs simultaneously (Fig. 7) whereas mAbs 4C7 and 14G8 cannot bind simultaneously. Also apparent from these experiments was that there is only one epitope present per toxin molecule as binding inhibited additional binding of the same mAb. Competition ELISA where one mAb was kept constant while the other was varied in concentration indicated some concentration-dependent inhibition of binding in the setting of two mAbs (data not shown), which was most significant for mAbs 4C7 and 20B1. To investigate the domains recognized by the various mAbs to SEB, mutant proteins were cloned in accordance with select agent regulations (42CFR73). Full-length SEB, SEB-MRSA, three C-terminal deletions of 5, 11, 15, residues (mutants 1–3) and mutants of aa 1–209, 1–189, 1–149, 46–149 (mutant 4–7) (Fig. 8A) were successfully expressed. All mAbs recognized the full-length SEB protein, deletion mutant-1 (5 terminal residues deleted) and the MRSA-derived SEB protein (addition of thymidine at 703). Further deletion of the C terminus (11 and 15 residues) eliminated binding by Western blot (Fig. 8C) and ELISA (Fig. 8E). Dot blot analysis comparing binding of mAbs to the decapeptide (227–236), SEB and mutant-1 demonstrated binding of the mAbs to the decapeptide (Fig. 8D) but not mutant-2, however binding efficiency was variable. Given that the C terminus distal 10 residue epitope would be too small to accommodate distinct binding of 4 mAbs we hypothesized that the actual mAb binding domain was more complex and included conformational epitopes to which distantly located residues contribute. Consequently the C terminus would be either directly part of several conformational epitopes each binding one of the mAbs or contribute indirectly to their stability. To identify individual amino acids that could be potentially involved in epitope structure, we focused on 7 residues based on computer-assisted three-dimensional modeling derived from crystal structure of SEB (Fig. 10) (2Swaminathan S.

Mutagenesis studies were carried out to provide the structural basis for understanding the loss of catalytic activity observed in a recently identified UfSP2 mutation that is associated with an autosomal dominant form of hip dysplasia. Ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (Ufm1) is a recently identified ubiquitin-like protein (UBL) 5The abbreviations used are: UBL, ubiquitin-like protein; Ub, ubiquitin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; BFHD, Beukes familial hip dysplasia; PDB, Protein Data Bank; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. (1Komatsu M. Chiba T. Tatsumi K. Iemura S. Tanida I. Okazaki N. Ueno T. Kominami E. Natsume T. Tanaka K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). It shares several common properties with ubiquitin (Ub) and other UBLs. It is synthesized as an inactive precursor protein composed of 85 residues, with two amino acids following a highly conserved glycine in its C terminus, the exposure of which is required for its subsequent conjugation. The NMR structure of Ufm1 shows a similar tertiary structure to Ub and other UBLs despite the fact that it shares very little sequence identity (2Sasakawa H. Sakata E. Yamaguchi Y. Komatsu M. Tatsumi K. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Kato K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 343: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, Ufm1 displays different surface features from Ub and UBLs, suggesting that it may recognize different partners. It has been demonstrated that Ufm1 is ligated to a number of proteins in HEK293 cells and mouse tissues via a conjugation mechanism similar to that of Ub and UBLs. Mature Ufm1 is activated by a novel E1-like activating enzyme, Uba5, and then transferred to its cognate E2-like conjugating enzyme Ufc1. Recently, a Ufm1-specific E3 ligase, Ufl1, and its cellular substrate, C20orf116, have also been identified (3Tatsumi K. Sou Y.S. Tada N. Nakamura E. Iemura S. Natsume T. Kang S.H. Chung C.H. Kasahara M. Kominami E. Yamamoto M. Tanaka K. Komatsu M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 5417-5427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although the biological function of Ufm1 conjugation has yet to be identified, the fact that both Ufm1 and its conjugating system are conserved in both metazoans and plants suggests potential roles in various multicellular organisms. Like Ub and UBLs, Ufm1 requires specific proteolytic cleavage to remove two C-terminal residues to become its mature form. Two cysteine proteases of different lengths, UfSP1 and UfSP2, have been identified (4Kang S.H. Kim G.R. Seong M. Baek S.H. Seol J.H. Bang O.S. Ovaa H. Tatsumi K. Komatsu M. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5256-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The longer UfSP2 is present in most, if not all, multicellular organisms, whereas the shorter UfSP1 is not found in plants or nematodes. These proteases are also responsible for the removal of Ufm1 from native intracellular conjugates. Neither protease shares sequence homology with any of the five categorized deubiquitinating enzymes identified thus far nor with any previously known proteases. However, the crystal structure of mouse UfSP1 at 1.7 Å resolution revealed a papain-like fold with a unique active site that is composed of Cys and an Asp-Pro-His conserved box instead of the canonical Cys-His-Asp triad, and this Cys and Asp-Pro-His configuration of the catalytic residues seems to form a new subfamily of the cysteine protease superfamily (5Ha B.H. Kim E.E. BMB Rep. 2008; 41: 435-443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A mutation within the human UFSP2 gene has recently been identified in a family with an autosomal dominant form of hip dysplasia, termed Beukes familial hip dysplasia (BFHD; MIM142669) (6Roby P. Eyre S. Worthington J. Ramesar R. Cilliers H. Beighton P. Grant M. Wallis G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 904-908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which is characterized by severe premature degenerative osteoarthritis of the hip joint. 6C. M. Watson and G. Wallis, manuscript in preparation. The UFSP2 mutation predicts the substitution of the highly conserved Tyr290 by His in the encoded protein. Sequence alignments indicated that the human UFSP2 Tyr290 is equivalent to Tyr282 in the mouse and also corresponds to the highly conserved Tyr41 of mouse Ufsp1. The crystal structure of mouse UfSP1 suggested that Tyr41 plays a role in oxyanion hole formation. Interestingly, the Y282H substitution in UfSP2 abolished the in vitro Ufm1-processing activity of mouse UfSP2, whereas the corresponding Y41H mutation in mouse UfSP1 reduced but did not abolish the activity.6 Here, we report the crystal structure of mouse UfSP2 at 2.6 Å resolution, which shows a unique protein fold for the N-terminal domain linked to the catalytic domain that is similar to UfSP1. We also show that the novel N-terminal domain plays a role in the interaction with its cellular substrate C20orf116 and thus in the recruitment of UfSP2 to the endoplasmic reticulum, where C20orf116 almost exclusively resides. A comparison of the crystal structures of UfSP1 and UfSP2 coupled with the results from a series of mutagenesis experiments on both UfSP2 and UfSP1 defines the structural requirements for the substrate recognition and catalysis and explains the loss of activity of the UfSP2 mutation associated with BFHD. The cDNAs for Ufm1 (Swiss Protein Database code P61961) and Ufsp2 (Swiss Protein Database code Q99K23) from mouse were cloned into pET28a (Novagen) to generate N-terminal His-tagged proteins. In the case of Ufsp2, because the expressed protein was cleaved at Lys94 as confirmed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing, we have replaced it with Arg at this position to avoid cleavage. In addition, we added another mutation of Arg128 to Ala to evade cleavage upon standing for crystallization. The resulting vectors were transformed to Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) codon plus RIL (Stratagene) cells. The histidine-tagged proteins were purified initially using nickel affinity resins (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and further by Mono Q and gel filtration on a Superdex 75 26/60 column (GE Healthcare). The purified UfSP2 was concentrated to 10 mg/ml in a buffer containing 20 mm MES (pH 6.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. Selenomethionine-substituted UfSP2 was generated as described previously (29Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Initial screening for the crystallization was carried out by using 96-well Intelli plates (Hampton Research), and Hydra II Plus One (MATRIX Technology) robotics system at 295 K yielded micro-crystals, and this was further optimized using the hanging drop methods. Diffraction quality crystals were obtained by mixing equal volumes of 10 mg/ml mouse UfSP2 in 20 mm MES (pH 6.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT with a reservoir solution containing 0.04 m K2HPO4, 12% (v/v) PEG3350 in 3 days. The crystals of UfSP2 belong to the space group C2, with a = 184.53 Å, b = 56.04 Å, c = 143.27 Å, and α = γ = 90° and β = 128.01°, and it contains two molecules per asymmetric unit, corresponding to a Matthews volume Vm of 2.78 Å3 Da−1. Attempts to crystallize the UfSP2 complex with Ufm1 did not yield crystals large enough to be suitable for high resolution data collection. The x-ray diffraction data set from the native and selenomethionine crystals were collected at beamline 4A of Pohang Light Source, Pohang, Korea. Crystals were equilibrated in a cryoprotectant buffer containing reservoir buffer plus 30% (v/v) ethylene glycol and then flash-frozen in a cold nitrogen stream at 100 K prior to collection. Data were processed, integrated, and scaled by using HKL2000 program suite (30Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Open table in a new tab The crystal structure of UfSP2 was determined by the multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction phasing method, because all attempts by molecular replacement using UfSP1 failed. Initially 9 out of 11 possible selenium sites were found, and eventually all selenium sites were refined; the initial phases were calculated using the programs SOLVE (31Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and RESOLVE (32Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

About 54% of the residues were automatically modeled as a polyalanine chain by RESOLVE and further constructed using the molecular modeling program COOT (33Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). The refinement was then carried out using the CNS and REFMAC (34Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L.

The final refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Site-directed mutagenesis and loop exchanges on the residues that might be involved in the catalysis were carried out using QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) by following the manufacturer's instructions. Mutants of UfSP2 were produced as N-terminally His-tagged proteins with single point mutations at positions Tyr282, Cys294, Asn290, Thr422, and Met283. The chimerical regulatory, upstream, and neighboring loops of UfSP2 were made by substitution with corresponding UfSP1 residues. The regulatory loop of UfSP2 (393GGVLA397) was replaced by 149GDADAQS155 of UfSP1 and vice versa. Upstream and neighboring loop of UfSP2 basically having the quadruple mutant (Y282H/M283G/N290R/T422W) was exchanged. The 284QDRI287 and 423GAEDL427 of UfSP2 changed to 43CDGL46 and 180GTPKNR185 of UfSP1, respectively. In vitro proteolysis assay was performed using GST-Ufm1-HA as a model substrate of Ufm1 precursor as described previously (7Ha B.H. Ahn H.C. Kang S.H. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. Kim E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14893-14900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). All proteolysis assays were performed by incubating appropriate amounts of UfSP enzymes with 6 μg of GST-Ufm1-HA at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by addition of SDS sampling buffer and analyzed using SDS-PAGE. The gels were then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. HeLa cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with appropriate vectors. Two days after transfection, they were fixed by incubation for 10 min with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Cells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, and treated with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 h. They were then incubated for 1 h with appropriate antibodies. After washing with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, cells were incubated for 1 h with FITC- or TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody in PBS containing 3% BSA. After washing, cells were observed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM510; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Images were acquired using an 80× objective and then processed using Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NEM, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm PMSF, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were incubated with appropriate antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C and then with protein A-conjugated agarose for the next 1 h. UfSP2 from mouse, containing 461 amino acids, was crystallized, and the structure was determined using multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion data collected from the selenomethionine-substituted UfSP2 and refined at 2.6 Å resolution. Crystallized UfSP2 was mutated at three positions: C294S, K94R, and R128A to void cleavage during expression and crystallization, and all atoms were well defined in the electron density map except for the residues 53–55, 62–64, 81–102, and 117–133. Table 1 summarizes statistics on the crystallographic data. The overall structure has dimensions of 80 × 50 × 55 Å and consists of two domains, with the first domain composed of the 240 residues at the N terminus and the second domain consisting of the 200 residues at the C terminus as seen in Fig. 1A. The two domains are connected by a linker of about 20 residues, and the C-terminal tail forms additional interactions with the N terminus at the interface. The N-terminal domain, which is shaped like a rectangular box of 40 × 40 × 20 Å, has a six-stranded β-sheet with five helices. The strands are in the order of β2-β3-β1-β4-β5-β6, and the two long helices, α1 and α3, are on the somewhat concave face of the sheet, running diagonal to it, whereas the third helix, α4, packs at one end of the β-sheet (β5-β6) in the same direction as the sheet. The inner surface of the β-sheet facing the α-helices is highly hydrophobic, whereas the opposite side of the β-sheet is somewhat polar. The two long helices are amphipathic with the hydrophobic surfaces facing the β-sheet. The linker residues are practically packed against the N terminus of the β-sheet on the opposite side of the two parallel helices. The catalytic C-terminal domain has seven α-helices and seven β-strands and resembles the papain-like structure that was previously reported in mouse UfSP1 (7Ha B.H. Ahn H.C. Kang S.H. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. Kim E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14893-14900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and the catalytic triad is positioned on the surface cleft of the opposite side of the N-terminal domain. In this crystal form, there are two UfSP2 molecules per asymmetric unit and the two are related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold and show a root mean square deviation of 1.6 Å (supplemental Fig. S1). As expected, comparison of UfSP2 with other structures in the Protein Data Bank using the DALI algorithm (8Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol.

Atg4B is an essential enzyme in autophagy that cleaves nascent Atg8 at its C-terminal arginine residue and deconjugates Atg8 family proteins from a small adduct, phosphatidylethanolamine (12Ohsumi Y.

When the N-terminal domain of UfSP2 alone was tested, there were no significant hits on structural similarity search using either DALI or TM-align (15Zhang Y. Skolnick J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2302-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar). The highest similarities were found in a putative lipoprotein B and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules but with Z-scores less than 5. The catalytic domain of UfSP2 shows almost identical overall structure with UfSP1, as expected from the sequence identity of 36%. However, there are significant differences as indicated by the root mean square deviation of 1.9 Å for 210 Cα atoms. Some regions show a root mean square deviation greater than 3 Å, but they are mostly on the surface and more than 15 Å away from the active site. One surprising point is that UfSP2 has more prominent secondary structures than UfSP1 (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S2). The helix α7, which harbors the catalytic cysteine residue, is longer in UfSP2, and there is a three-residue insertion after the helix. The loop between α7 and α8 interacts with its α5 helix, which turns 180° in comparison with the loop of UfSP1. A stretch of residues after β8 reorganizes into a longer helix (α11) and is coupled with the changes in residues between β12 and β13. The C terminus of UfSP2 has three extra residues, and they make contact with the N-terminal domain, e.g. the backbone amide of Ala460 forms hydrogen bonds with the carboxyl group of Asp231, and the C terminus of Leu461 forms hydrogen bonds to Arg219. As seen in Fig. 2A, all the atoms near the active site are well defined in the electron density map. The catalytic Cys294 is located on the N terminus of an α-helix utilizing dipole moment, and “Asp418–Pro419–His420” are located at the loop off a β-strand (Fig. 2B). This is the same as what is found in UfSP1 (5Ha B.H. Kim E.E. BMB Rep. 2008; 41: 435-443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ha B.H. Ahn H.C. Kang S.H. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. Kim E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14893-14900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This differs from the canonical triad of the cysteine proteases where the Asp and His are located at two separate β-strands of the central β-sheet (16Kraut J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 331-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). His398 of UfSP2, which is part of a highly conserved stretch among UfSP2 (supplemental Fig. S3), is the canonical histidine position, thereby posing doubt on the identification of catalytic residues. However, when this residue was replaced by alanine, the in vitro activity of the mutant was the same as that of wild type UfSP2 (Fig. 2C). Indeed, in the crystal structure, His398 is too far from the catalytic Cys294, i.e. 7.2 and 3.9 Å away from the Sγ atom of Cys294 and Nδ1 of His420, respectively. Furthermore, superposition of papain shows that Leu396 is located at the canonical histidine position. The loss of activities by mutations of Cys294, Asp418, and His420 further confirm the identification of the catalytic triad, and Tyr282 is responsible for the formation of the oxyanion hole (Fig. 2). The in vitro activity was assessed by using GST-Ufm1-HA as a model substrate for Ufm1 precursor as was used in previous studies (4Kang S.H. Kim G.R. Seong M. Baek S.H. Seol J.H. Bang O.S. Ovaa H. Tatsumi K. Komatsu M. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5256-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structure of UfSP1 and the NMR peak shifts in the UfSP1-Ufm1 complex, we predicted that the loop connecting β3 and β4 as well as Trp98 may play a role in Ufm1 recognition and/or stabilization (7Ha B.H. Ahn H.C. Kang S.H. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. Kim E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14893-14900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These correspond to the loop connecting β9 and β10 and Trp342 in UfSP2. This loop is referred to as the “R-loop” (regulatory loop) hereafter. On the outset, the R-loop in UfSP2 is slightly shorter than that of UfSP1 (Figs. 1B and 3). To test whether this loop indeed participates in Ufm1 recognition, it was mutated. The R-loop of UfSP2 was swapped with that of UfSP1, i.e. the residues 393GGVLA397 in UfSP2 were replaced by the corresponding loop in UfSP1, namely 149GDADAQS155. As shown in Fig. 3C, both the chimera UfSP1 with UfSP2 R-loop (UfSP1-RL2) and wild type UfSP1 digested the substrate completely within 2 h, whereas the chimera UfSP2 with UfSP1 R-loop (UfSP2-RL1) showed limited activity. These results suggest that although this loop is not strictly conserved, it plays a role in the recognition of Ufm1 precursor. The active site was further dissected to understand the lack of activity observed for the mouse equivalent Ufsp2 mutation associated with BFHD (Ufsp2 Y282H is the mouse equivalent of the human UFSP2 Y290H BFHD-associated mutation). Of note was the finding that UfSP1 Y41H, which corresponds to UfSP2 Y282H, cleaved GST-Ufm1-HA at about a 3-fold lower rate than wild type UfSP1 (Fig. 4C). Because Y41H retained the enzymatic activity (although significantly reduced), the residues that are not conserved within 6 Å of the oxyanion hole Tyr of UfSP2 were examined. These residues included Met283, Asn290, and Thr422 of UfSP2, which correspond to Gly42, Arg49, and Trp179 of UfSP1, respectively (Fig. 4A). To the inactive Y282H UfSP2 mutant, additional mutations were introduced and tested for their in vitro activities against GST-Ufm1-HA to see whether the enzymatic activity gets restored, as was the case in UfSP1. As shown in Fig. 4C, incorporation of Arg at amino acid 290 resulted in a slight recovery of activity. Introduction of an additional mutation at position 422, i.e. Y282H/N290R/T422W led to a further recovery in enzymatic activity. A similar effect was observed in the case of Y282H/M293G/N290R triple mutant. However, incorporation of mutation at all four sites, i.e. Y282H/M283G/N290R/T422W, did not seem to yield additional enhancement. We then tested the possible effect of residues further away from Tyr282, in two adjacent loops that differ from one another as seen in Fig. 4B. These residues correspond to Gln284–Ile287 and Gly423–Leu427 in UfSP2, and Cys43–Leu46 and Gly180–Arg185 stretches in UfSP1 (Fig. 1B), referred to as the “U-loop” (upstream loop) and “N-loop” (neighboring loop), respectively. When the U-loop of UfSP2 was replaced with the corresponding loops of UfSP1 in addition to the quadruple mutant above, it showed a dramatic restoration of enzymatic activity (i.e. the chimera of UfSP2 with its U-loop replaced by that of UfSP1 showed activity that was nearly the same as that of wild type UfSP2) (Fig. 4C). On the other hand, the replacement of the N-loop showed relatively little effect on activity. In an attempt to determine the role of the unique N-terminal domain of UfSP2, we first examined the subcellular localization of UfSP2 and its N- and C-terminal domains. As shown in Fig. 5, all are localized in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Significantly, a portion of the N-terminal domain in the cytoplasm appeared as speckles, raising the possibility that the N-terminal domain plays a role in the localization of UfSP2 in subcellular organelles, such as the ER and the Golgi apparatus (see below). Recently C20orf116, a protein of unknown function, has been identified as a target for Ufm1 modification; whereas the newly identified Ufl1 serves as a Ufm1 E3 ligase for C20orf116, and UfSP2 deconjugates Ufm1 from its cellular substrate (3Tatsumi K. Sou Y.S. Tada N. Nakamura E. Iemura S. Natsume T. Kang S.H. Chung C.H. Kasahara M. Kominami E. Yamamoto M. Tanaka K. Komatsu M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 5417-5427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It has also been found that C20orf116 predominantly localizes in the ER. In accordance with this finding, C20orf116 almost completely co-localized with calreticulin, a marker protein for the ER in HeLa cells but minimally with β-COP, a marker protein for Golgi bodies (Fig. 6). Co-expression with C20orf116 revealed that UfSP2 and its N-terminal domain, but not the C-terminal domain, strongly co-localize in the ER. These results suggest that C20orf116 possibly interacts with the N-terminal domain of UfSP2 and recruits it to the ER. To test this possibility, FLAG-C20orf116 was expressed in HeLa cells with and without Myc-tagged UfSP2 and its N- and C-terminal domains. Immunoprecipitation analysis by using an anti-FLAG antibody revealed that full-length UfSP2 and its N-terminal domain, but not its C-terminal domain, co-precipitated with C20orf116 (Fig. 7A), indicating that the N-terminal domain of UfSP2 interacts with C20orf116. To confirm this finding, Myc-C20orf116 was expressed in HeLa cells with and without HisMax-tagged UfSP2 and its N- and C-terminal domains. Pulldown analysis using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-conjugated agarose showed that the amount of C20orf116 that co-precipitated with UfSP2 or its N-terminal domain was much higher than that with the C-terminal domain of UfSP2 (Fig. 7B). Collectively, these results suggest that the N-terminal domain of UfSP2 plays a key role in the recognition of C20orf116 and thus in the recruitment of UfSP2 to the ER, where C20orf116 is predominantly localized.FIGURE 7Interaction of UfSP2 and its N-terminal domain with C20orf116.

https://openalex.org/W2032604166,"The carbohydrate antigen (glycoantigen) PSA from an intestinal commensal bacteria is able to down-regulate inflammatory bowel disease in model mice, suggesting that stimulation with PSA results in regulatory T cell (Treg) generation. However, mechanisms of how peripheral human T cells respond and home in response to commensal antigens are still not understood. Here, we demonstrate that a single exposure to PSA induces differentiation of human peripheral CD4(+) T cells into type-Tr1 Tregs. This is in contrast to mouse models where PSA induced the production of Foxp3(+) iTregs. The human PSA-induced Tr1 cells are profoundly anergic and exhibit nonspecific bystander suppression mediated by IL-10 secretion. Most surprisingly, glycoantigen exposure provoked expression of gut homing receptors on their surface. These findings reveal a mechanism for immune homeostasis in the gut whereby exposure to commensal glycoantigens provides the requisite information to responding T cells for proper tissue localization (gut) and function (anti-inflammatory/regulatory)."
https://openalex.org/W2084299788,"Disposal of damaged proteins and protein aggregates is a prerequisite for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and impairment of this disposal can lead to a broad range of pathological conditions, most notably in brain-associated disorders including Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases, and cancer.

IntroductionThe transcriptional response of the cell to proteotoxic stress (the protein stress response) is induced by a plethora of physical conditions and chemical compounds. The heat shock factor-1 (HSF1) 2The abbreviations used are: HSF1, heat shock factor-1; PQC, protein quality control; HSE, heat shock elements; UPS, ubiquitin proteasome system; CHIP, C terminus of Hsp-70-interacting protein. is considered the master regulator that orchestrates this cellular process (1Shamovsky I. Ivannikov M. Kandel E.S. Gershon D. Nudler E. Nature. 2006; 440: 556-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Hsp(s) and other stress-activated genes, whose activities help the cell to recover from a proteotoxic stress, contain, in their regulatory regions, the so-called heat shock elements (HSEs), which confer stress regulation to those genes (2Voellmy R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2004; 78: 143-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Multiple layers of regulation characterize the activation of HSF1. Upon exposure to stressful conditions, HSF1 accumulates in the nucleus and, by a homotrimerization process, gains the ability to bind to HSE and to transactivate the target genes (reviewed in Ref. 3Shamovsky I. Nudler E. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 2008; 65: 855-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).The stress-inducible molecular chaperone Hsp70 is a target of HSF1, and its expression, in combination with other HSF1-target genes, plays a central role in the “triage” of damaged proteins either by refolding altered conformations or, as a last resort, by promoting their clearance (4Marques C. Guo W. Pereira P. Taylor A. Patterson C. Evans P.C. Shang F. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 741-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Indeed, the ability of Hsp70 to sense the folded state of a specific client can be coupled to the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) by the co-chaperone CHIP (C terminus of Hsp-70-interacting protein) to promote the degradation of the substrate (5Meacham G.C. Patterson C. Zhang W. Younger J.M. Cyr D.M. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 6McClellan A.J. Frydman J. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: E51-E53Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). At the same time, Hsp70 has been shown to play a role in autophagy, the catabolic process characterized by the disposal of aggregated proteins and altered cellular structures, by helping substrate translocation through the lysosomal membrane (7Leu J.I. Pimkina J. Frank A. Murphy M.E. George D.L. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 15-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar).The co-chaperone BAG3 has been isolated in an attempt to identify proteins that bind to the ATPase domain of Hsp70, a property that BAG3 shares with the other five members of the BAG family (8Takayama S. Reed J.C. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: E237-E241Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). As are other stress-regulated genes, BAG3 is activated by an increasing number of stressful and physiological conditions (9Rosati A. Ammirante M. Gentilella A. Basile A. Festa M. Pascale M.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 781-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Proteasome inhibitor treatment, a condition characterized by the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, stimulates BAG3 transcription in a HSF1-regulated manner (14Du Z.X. Zhang H.Y. Meng X. Gao Y.Y. Zou R.L. Liu B.Q. Guan Y. Wang H.Q. J. Cell. Physiol. 2009; 218: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Liu P. Xu B. Li J. Lu H.

Commun. 2008; 365: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recent evidence has shown that BAG3 participates in the protein quality control (PQC) process and it can stimulate the macroautophagic pathway during the aging of the rodent brain (17Gamerdinger M. Hajieva P. Kaya A.M. Wolfrum U. Hartl F.U. Behl C. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 889-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Furthermore, BAG3 expression stimulates the disposal of polyglutamine (poly Q)-containing proteins, preventing the formation of aggregates (18Carra S. Seguin S.J. Lambert H. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1437-1444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar).Although BAG3 is not required for proper development of skeletal muscle, its deficiency results in an impaired ability for the preservation of homeostasis in the adult muscle (19Homma S. Iwasaki M. Shelton G.D. Engvall E. Reed J.C. Takayama S. Am J Pathol. 2006; 169: 761-773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The interplay between BAG3 and the protein degradation pathways has been proposed to mediate this effect (20Arndt V. Dick N. Tawo R. Dreiseidler M. Wenzel D. Hesse M. Fürst D.O. Saftig P. Saint R. Fleischmann B.K. Hoch M. Höhfeld J. Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 143-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar).The control of the protein degradation by the use of proteasome inhibitors was shown to be an effective in vitro strategy to reduce the proliferative potential of brain tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common and aggressive brain tumor (21Yin D. Zhou H. Kumagai T. Liu G. Ong J.M. Black K.L. Koeffler H.P. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 344-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Here we show that the ectopic expression of BAG3 in glioblastoma cells activates HSF-1, which in turn stimulates the transcription of target genes involved in the stress response such as Hsp70 and BAG3 itself. Evidently, intracellular accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins contributes to the underlying mechanisms participating in the stress response. Ectopic expression of BAG3, through the interaction with Hsp70 and a functional WW domain, a region located in the N terminus of the protein, results in an accumulation of ubiquitinated partners. This event favors the turnover of BAG3-partners, as suppression of polyubiquitin chain formation or proteasomal inhibition results in further accumulation of ubiquitinated clients. At the cellular level, overexpression of BAG3 in glioblastoma cell lines, but not in non-glial cells, results in a remarkable decrease in the colony formation capacity and this tumor suppressor-like effect is almost entirely reverted when the binding to Hsp70 is impaired.RESULTSLike Hsp70, BAG3 transcriptional activation of BAG3 is a major hallmark of the stress response, which is activated by HSF-1. Earlier studies have shown that proteasome inhibitor MG132 stimulates BAG3 gene transcription by recruiting heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and that DNA sequences positioned within the 5′-UTR of the BAG3 gene are required for this event (14Du Z.X. Zhang H.Y. Meng X. Gao Y.Y. Zou R.L. Liu B.Q. Guan Y. Wang H.Q. J. Cell. Physiol. 2009; 218: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This is an interesting observation in light of our recent results on the auto-activation of the BAG3 promoter and the importance of the 5′-UTR for this positive regulatory feedback (22Gentilella A. Khalili K. J. Cell. Biochem. 2009; 108: 1117-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As a first step to investigate potential involvement of HSF1 in the auto-regulation of BAG3, human glioblastoma cells, T98G, were transfected with plasmids encoding either full-length BAG3 or its mutant variant ΔC-(1–420), which lacks the C terminus of the protein. Examination of the nuclear extracts from these cells revealed a remarkable increase in the level of HSF1 in cells overexpressing full-length BAG3 but not mutant ΔC-(1–420) (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained with other human glioblastoma cell lines, such as U-87MG but not with cells of non-glial origin including HeLa cells (data not shown).To investigate involvement of HSF-1 in transcriptional activation of BAG3, the nucleotide sequence corresponding to the HSE present in BAG3 5′-UTR was altered in the context of the firefly luciferase reporter gene construct bearing the BAG3 promoter sequence spanning nucleotides −831 to +306 nucleotides, with respect to transcription start site at +1. As shown by luciferase activity assay (Fig. 1B), mutation in the HSE desensitized the BAG3 promoter for activation by full-length BAG3, suggesting that this effect is mediated by HSE-binding nuclear proteins, including HSF1. In fact, results from band shift studies verified the interaction of HSF1 with the HSE motif of BAG3 (data not shown).HSF1 is the master regulator of heat-shock and protein stress response (1Shamovsky I. Ivannikov M. Kandel E.S. Gershon D. Nudler E. Nature. 2006; 440: 556-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Activation of HSF1 leads to enhanced transcriptional activity of Hsp70 and the related proteins. To further investigate the biological impact of BAG3-HSF-1 cross activation, first we examined the level of Hsp70 transcription in T98G cells after transfection with plasmids expressing full-length BAG3 or its mutant variant ΔC-(1–420). Results from RNA analysis revealed induction of Hsp70 transcription by full-length BAG3, but not its mutant variant ΔC-(1–420) (Fig. 1C), suggesting that activation of HSF-1 by BAG3 triggers expression of the stress protein response.Interestingly, down-modulation of endogenous BAG3 expression by BAG3 specific siRNA caused more than 40% decrease in the level of both Hsp70 and Hsp27 expression. Of note, suppression of BAG3 expression had no major impact on the level of Hsp40 and α-B crystallin in these cells (data not shown). Altogether, these observations indicate that endogenous BAG3 sustains the expression of some HSF1 target genes (Fig. 1D).The BAG domain has been shown to play a role in the BAG3 autoregulatory feedback as its deletion from the full-length protein impairs BAG3 transcriptional activation (22Gentilella A. Khalili K. J. Cell. Biochem. 2009; 108: 1117-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The BAG domain is also the region of the BAG proteins that retains the ability to interact with Hsp70 (13Takayama S. Xie Z. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 781-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 25Doong H. Vrailas A. Kohn E.C. Cancer Lett. 2002; 188: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar).To test the hypothesis of an involvement of Hsp70 in BAG3 transcriptional activation, and more broadly, in the triggering of the stress response, we sought to identify the residue(s) within the BAG domain that are important for binding to Hsp70 and assess their ability to augment transcription of the BAG3 promoter. First, we performed a cross-species conservation analysis of the primary sequence of the BAG domains of different members of the family to identify candidate amino acid residues suitable for mutation and functional analyses. In this respect, we focused our attention on the highly conserved third α-helix motif of the BAG domain (Fig. 2A), which is known for its importance for the interaction of BAG3 with Hsp70. Among the four highly conserved residues within the helix α-3 of the BAG domain (shown by asterisks), alterations of arginine at position 480 into alanine, hereafter called R480A, impaired the capacity of BAG3 to interact with Hsp70 as tested by GST pull-down assay (Fig. 2B). Of note, R480A retained its ability to associate with PLC-γ, which is known to associate with the central proline-rich domain of BAG3 (26Doong H. Price J. Kim Y. Gasbarre C. Probst J. Liotta L.A. Blanchette J. Rizzo K. Kohn E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4385-4395Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Binding of BAG3 to Hsp70 is required for BAG3 promoter activation. A, cross-species and cross-members sequence comparison of the evolutionarily conserved helix α-3 of the BAG domain. Human (h), rat (r), mouse (m), and zebrafish (z) amino acid sequences of the BAG domain from BAG3 and from human BAG1 and BAG4 were retrieved as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Representation of aligned sequences was obtained using Clustal W sequence alignment tool. Boxes highlight identical and similar conserved amino acid positions and a clustal consensus is marked by stars. The shaded box points at arginine 480 in the helix α-3 of the BAG Domain of human BAG3. B, in vitro protein interaction assay of wild-type and point mutant BAG3 proteins with Hsc/Hsp70. GST-BAG3, and GST-BAG3(R480A) fusion proteins were incubated with T98G lysate as source of Hsc/Hsp70. Proteins bound to GST-BAG3 (wt or R480A) were identified by precipitation with glutathione-Sepharose beads. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot using α-Hsc/Hsp70 and α-PLC. GST alone was used as negative control. C, in vivo association of wild-type and point mutant BAG3 with Hsc/Hsp70. T98G cells were transfected with Myc-His-tagged BAG3 wt or BAG3 (R480A). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Myc TAG monoclonal antibody or with normal mouse serum (NMS). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed for Hsc/Hsp70 after Western blot using an α-Hsc/Hsp70 monoclonal antibody. Binding of α-His antibody was used as control (NT, not transfected). D, nuclear expression level of HSF1 in R480A transfected T98G cells. Cells were transfected as indicated, and 24 hours later nuclear lysates were prepared. Detection of HSF1 and Lamin A/C was performed as in Fig. 1A and band intensities, respectively, were measured. E, BAG3 promoter activity upon R480A ectopic expression. T98G cells were co-transfected with wild-type BAG3 promoter (−831/+306) plus empty vector or wild-type BAG3 or R480A. Luciferase assay was performed as described in Fig. 2B. The results expressed are the mean of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In an alternative approach to examine the importance of arginine 480 for BAG3 association with Hsp70, mutant cDNA was cloned in pcDNA6-Myc-His, and after its expression in T98G cells, its association with endogenous Hsp70 was determined by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot using various antibodies that recognize either Hsp70 or tagged protein. As seen in Fig. 2C, in vivo association of R480A with Hsp70 was completely abrogated. As a first step toward understanding a potential engagement of Hsp70 in BAG3 transcriptional activation, T98G glioblastoma cells were transfected with empty vector, wild-type, or R480A BAG3-encoding plasmids and, after 24 h, the nuclear accumulation of HSF1 was measured by Western blot analysis of nuclear protein extracts. HSF1 expression, which correlates with a nuclear accumulation upon wild-type BAG3 overexpression (Fig. 2D, lane 2), was not altered by R480A expression (Fig. 2D, lane 3). Accordingly, results from promoter-reporter assay showed that R480A failed to stimulate the transcription of the BAG3 promoter (Fig. 2E). All these observations point to the importance of helix α-3 of BAG3 and residue 480 in the association of BAG3 with Hsp70, nuclear translocation of HSF-1 and auto-regulation of the BAG3 promoter.HSF1 has been shown to be activated in response to high intracellular levels of ubiquitinated proteins. Proteasome inhibitors such as MG132, ALLN, and lactacystine, trigger the stress protein response in several cellular contexts through the activation of Hsp(s) in a HSF1-dependent manner (27Kawazoe Y. Nakai A. Tanabe M. Nagata K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 28Mathew A. Mathur S.K. Jolly C. Fox S.G. Kim S. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7163-7171Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).To understand the molecular events associated with HSF1-driven auto-regulation of BAG3 expression, we sought to determine whether an increase in the level of BAG3 via ectopic expression elevated the overall ubiquitination of BAG3-client proteins. To this end, we first assessed the level of ubiquitinated proteins, which are associated with BAG3 by immunoprecipitation using an antibody that pulls down overexpressed, tagged BAG3 followed by Western blot using anti-ubiquitin antibody. As shown in Fig. 3B, a remarkable amount of ubiquitinated immunocomplexes was pulled down from full-length BAG3 but not from ΔC-(1–420)-overexpressing lysates. Deletion of amino acid residues 1–62, which comprise the WW domain, also showed a significant decrease in the amount of ubiquitinated proteins that are immunoprecipitated by α-Myc TAG antibody (Fig. 3C). In light of our results, the importance of BAG3:Hsp70 interaction in the auto-regulation of BAG3 (shown in Fig. 2E) and the involvement of the C-terminal region of BAG3 in the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins (Fig. 3B), we investigated the impact of the R480A mutation on the ubiquitination of BAG3 and BAG3 partners. As seen in Fig. 3D, unlike wild-type BAG3, the mutant R480A was unable to pull-down ubiquitinated proteins indicating that binding to Hsp70 is required for this event. Interestingly, despite a lower stability of R480A mutant protein in respect to the wild type was observed (supplemental Fig. S1), normalized amounts of immunoprecipitated BAG3 and R480A were used in this experiment to compare the ubiquitinated pulled-down proteins. Moreover, when endogenous BAG3 was pulled down by a rabbit polyclonal antibody, a smear of ubiquitinated proteins was still detected (Fig. 3E).Because the observed ubiquitination pattern could arise from BAG3 and/or BAG3 clients, we aimed to verify both hypotheses in the next two steps. The direct ubiquitination of BAG3 was evaluated by an in vivo ubiquitination assay. T98G cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HA-tagged ubiquitin and Myc-His-BAG3. To facilitate detection of ubiquitinated isoforms of BAG3, protein extracts from transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody followed by Western blot using anti-His TAG antibody to detect protein isoforms corresponding to BAG3. Two bands of higher molecular weight (indicated by the arrows) than canonical 80 kDa (as highlighted by an asterisk) and corresponding to ubiquitinated isoforms of BAG3 were detected in the α-HA immunocomplexes (Fig. 4A, lane 4).FIGURE 4Ubiquitination occurs both on BAG3 and BAG3-client proteins. A, analysis of BAG3 ubiquitination in vivo. T98G cells were transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin in the presence of an empty vector (lanes 1 and 3) or BAG3 tagged at the C terminus with Myc-His (lanes 2 and 4). Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody against HA (lanes 3 and 4). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with an α-His antibody. Arrows point to ubiquitinated isoforms of BAG3, whereas the asterisks point to the canonical isoform. B, evaluation of BAG3 substrates ubiquitination in vivo. T98G cells expressing Myc-His-tagged BAG3 were harvested and lysed in native conditions (lanes 1 and 2) or in the presence of 1% SDS denaturing conditions (lanes 3 and 4) and subsequently immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody against Myc TAG or control IgG. Immunocomplexes were immunoblotted with an α-ubiquitin antibody (upper panel). α-His and α-Hsc/Hsp70 hybridization served as immunoprecipitation and partner-binding controls, respectively. C, inhibition of polyubiquitin chain formation stabilizes ubiquitinated BAG3 partners and BAG3 itself. T98G cells expressing Myc-His tagged BAG3 or ΔC-(1–420) or R480A mutant plus HA-tagged ubiquitin or lysine-less ubiquitin (KØ), were immunoprecipitated with α-Myc TAG antibody (upper panel) or with α-HA antibody (second panel from the top). Imunocomplexes were analyzed by Western blot and hybridized with α-ubiquitin and α-His TAG, respectively. His TAG and α-tubulin immunoblots from 20 μg of input lysates are shown in lower panels. D, proteasomal inhibition stabilizes ubiquitinated BAG3 partners. In vivo immunoprecipitation assay using α-Myc TAG antibody or control IgG with T98G lysate co-expressing Myc-His-tagged BAG3 and HA-tagged ubiquitin (lanes 1 and 2), plus 5 h of treatment with pepstatin A (lanes 3 and 4), plus 5 h of treatment with MG132 (lanes 5 and 6), or co-expressing Myc-tagged BAG3 and ubiquitin (KØ) (lanes 7 and 8). Immunoblot of immunoprecipitated complexes was reacted with an ubiquitin antibody (upper panel). The input levels of ectopic BAG3 are shown in the lower panel. The asterisks point to the IgG heavy chains (B, C, and D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To assess the contribution of BAG3-clients to the ubiquitination pattern observed in Fig. 3B, protein extracts overexpressing Myc-His-BAG3 were treated with 1% SDS as described under “Experimental Procedures” to dissociate BAG3 from its associated proteins, and further subjected to immunoprecipitation with a Myc TAG antibody. Immunocomplexes were analyzed by Western blot using anti-ubiquitin antibody. As shown in Fig. 4B, the smeared ubiquitination pattern was abolished in the presence of denaturing agents (compare lanes 2–4), indicating that BAG3 partners are ubiquitinated in this event and that their contribution to the ubquitination pattern is remarkable. Of note, equal amounts of BAG3 immunocomplex were used in these experiments (Fig. 4B, middle panel, compare lanes 2 and 4) and protein-protein interaction was further verified (Fig. 4B, lower panel).The ubiquitin lysine-less (KØ) mutant isoform is impaired in the ability to form polyubiquitin chains on target proteins of the UPS (ubiquitin proteasome system) and serves as a powerful tool to evaluate the ubiquitination dependence of the target degradation (27Kawazoe Y. Nakai A. Tanabe M. Nagata K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Co-transfections of BAG3 isoforms with HA-tagged wt- or lysine-less (KØ)-ubiquitin were carried out in T98G cells and total lysates were immunoprecipitated with α-Myc TAG or α-HA antibodies. The co-expression of Ub(KØ) determined a remarkable increase in the amount of ubiquitinated clients bound to wt BAG3, but not to ΔC-(1–420) or R480A (Fig. 4C, upper panel). Likewise, wt BAG3 pulled down by α-HA antibody was markedly augmented in presence of Ub(KØ) (Fig. 4C, lower panel). The basal ubiquitination levels of both clients and BAG3, in the presence of wt-ubiquitin, were even more evident with a longer exposure of the film (Fig. 4C, right panels).Interestingly, additional accumulation of ubiquitinated BAG3-clients, following BAG3 overexpression, was observed when T98G were treated for 5 h with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 but not with the lysosomal protease inhibitor Pepstatin A (Fig. 4D), indicating that proteasomal activity is important for the clearance of the ubiquitinated proteins.The accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins is an indication of a stressful condition for the cell. Different insults can induce extensive damage at the protein level. This could result in the triggering of a stress protein response that could potentially lead to unfavorable growth conditions and eventually to the cell death.To investigate the impact of BAG3 overexpression on cell growth, we set up a series of anchorage-dependent and -independent colony formation assays. T98G cells were transfected with an equimolar amount of plasmids encoding different BAG3 isoforms and carrying the selection marker for blasticidin, which confers resistance to the corresponding eukaryotic antibiotic. After replating, cells were cultured in medium supplemented with blasticidin for 15–20 days, with periodic medium change every 3 days. Colonies originating from single cells were stained and counted. As shown in Fig. 5A, wild-type BAG3 expression resulted in a remarkable drop in colony number when compared with pcDNA6 empty vector-transfected cells. Notably, deletion of C-terminal part of the protein (ΔC-(1–420) displayed a comparable number of colonies as the empty vector. Quantitatively the expression of wt BAG3 resulted in a 88% and a 79% decrease in colony number compared with empty vector control and ΔC-(1–420), respectively. Similar results were obtained in anchorage-independent conditions (−78% in BAG3 wt-overexpressing cells) as shown by colonies growing in soft agar (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, the R480A mutant expression partly restored the number of colonies observed in the control, indicating that Hsp70 binding activity correlates with the tumor suppressor-like phenotype described. Comparable results were obtained in other glioblastoma cell lines such as U-87MG and LN229 but not in non glial-derived cell lines such as HeLa and HEK293 (data not shown).FIGURE 5BAG3 expression displays a tumor suppressor-like phenotype in glioblastoma cells.

The RNA-binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K interacts with kinases and is found along genes including the mitogen-inducible early response gene EGR-1. Here, we used chromatin immunoprecipitations to study co-recruitment of hnRNP K and ERK cascade activity along the EGR-1 gene. These measurements revealed that the spatiotemporal binding patterns of ERK cascade transducers (GRB2, SOS, B-Raf, MEK, and ERK) at the EGR-1 locus resemble both hnRNP K and RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Inhibition of EGR-1 transcription with either serum-responsive factor knockdown or 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole altered recruitment of all of the above ERK cascade components along this locus that mirrored the changes in Pol II and hnRNP K profiles. siRNA knockdown of hnRNP K decreased the levels of active MEK and ERK at the EGR-1, changes associated with decreased levels of elongating pre-mRNA and less efficient splicing. The hnRNP K dependence and pattern of ERK cascade activation at the c-MYC locus were different from at EGR-1. Ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitations revealed that hnRNP K was associated with the EGR-1 but not c-MYC mRNAs.

Seger R. Biofactors. 2009; 35: 407-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). They are activated by a variety of mitogenic ligands that bind to surface receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) (13McKay M.M. Morrison D.K.

ERKs are among critical terminal effectors of kinase cascades that regulate virtually every intracellular response. Nuclear translocation of ERK1 and ERK2 is an accepted mode of their action (3Seth A. Gonzalez F.A. Gupta S. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24796-24804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3187) Google Scholar, 35Turjanski A.G. Vaqué J.P. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3240-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Importantly, most of the components of the ERK1/2 signaling module have been found bound to genes in ChIP assays (11Nelson J.D. LeBoeuf R.C. Bomsztyk K. Diabetes. 2011; 60: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 36Flanagin S. Nelson J.D. Castner D.G. Denisenko O. Bomsztyk K.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 13315-13320Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). ERKs target a large repertoire of nuclear protein substrates; thus compartmentalization at genomic sites explains one way by which their specificity is controlled in the intracellular environment. Still, it is not known how they are recruited and regulated along genes.Early growth response-1 (EGR-1, two exons, 3,824-bp-long locus) is an immediate early gene that encodes a zinc finger transcription factor (38Sukhatme V.P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1990; 1: 859-866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EGR-1 is rapidly and transiently expressed in many cell types following mitogenic stimulation, which then targets genes involved in signal transduction and gene expression (39Kubosaki A. Tomaru Y. Tagami M. Arner E. Miura H. Suzuki T. Suzuki M. Suzuki H. Hayashizaki Y. Genome Biol. 2009; 10: R41Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). hnRNP K is recruited to inducible gene loci including EGR-1. Intriguingly, ERK1/2 is bound to EGR-1 in a pattern that resembles K protein (36Flanagin S. Nelson J.D. Castner D.G. Denisenko O. Bomsztyk K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: e17Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Moreover, hnRNP K binds (40Laury-Kleintop L.D. Tresini M. Hammond O. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 95: 1042-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), regulates (41Chang J.W. Koike T. Iwashima M. Int.

Oncogene. 2009; 28: 1904-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) of ERK1/2 and other components of the ERK cascade. These previously published studies may reflect compartmentalized hnRNP K-controlled bursts of ERK activity in the vicinity of inducibly transcribed genes. Here, we explored the role and interaction of hnRNP K with the ERK1/2 cascade along inducible genes following mitogenic stimulation.DISCUSSIONThe discovery that terminal kinases such as ERK have hundreds of protein substrates has fueled great interest to understand mechanisms that control their specificity (13McKay M.M. Morrison D.K. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3113-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 33Yao Z. Seger R. Biofactors. 2009; 35: 407-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus far, several elements have been identified that account for kinase specificity including amino acid consensus sequence, subcellular localization or compartmentalization, duration and magnitude of the signals, cross-talk with other pathways, and scaffolds that modulate their activity (1Shaul Y.D. Seger R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 1213-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 12Murphy L.O. Blenis J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 268-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 13McKay M.M. Morrison D.K. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3113-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Below we discuss the elements of ERK specificity revealed in the current study and suggest a model for hnRNP-K-compartmentalized in situ control of ERK kinase cascade at the EGR-1 gene, which in turn regulates K protein-dependent mRNA synthesis and processing (Fig. 8).Compartmentalization of the ERK Cascade Signaling Module at Inducible GenesIt has been previously demonstrated that nearly all of the components of the ERK pathway translocate to the nucleus (73Oláh Z. Komoly S. Nagashima N. Joó F. Rapp U.R. Anderson W.B. Exp. Brain Res. 1991; 84: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 74Romero F. Ramos-Morales F. Domínguez A. Rios R.M. Schweighoffer F.

Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 76Lin S.Y. Makino K. Xia W. Matin A. Wen Y. Kwong K.Y. Bourguignon L. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). This and another recent study from our laboratory (11Nelson J.D. LeBoeuf R.C. Bomsztyk K. Diabetes. 2011; 60: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) provide evidence that in fact most of the ERK cascade components, from GRB2 down to ERK, are inducibly recruited along an inducible gene (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). These signal transducers were not found in the intergenic regions flanking the EGR-1, indicating that the ERK activation cascade is compartmentalized to discrete sites, restricting their action to only relevant gene locus-associated substrates along the Pol II transcribed region.Timing of the ERK Cascade Induction along Inducible GenesUnder the conditions of the present study, the serum-induced levels of active MEK/ERK assessed by Western blot analysis in whole cell lysates (Fig. 4B) were relatively low. In sharp contrast, the induced ChIP levels of all the ERK cascade components at the EGR-1 and the Nr4A3 loci were robust and short-lived. Moreover, the temporal profiles of ERK cascade at EGR-1 and Nr4A3 were very different from the one at the c-MYC and hnRNP K (Fig. 5) or the GAPDH genes (11Nelson J.D. LeBoeuf R.C. Bomsztyk K. Diabetes. 2011; 60: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The levels of active MEK/ERK seen by Western blot analysis represent the sum of MEK/ERK activities in different subcellular compartments/sites. Thus, the local burst of ERK activities occurring at different time points after mitogenic stimulation, as illustrated by the different profiles at EGR-1 and c-MYC (Fig. 5), would not be as readily detectable in bulk cell fractions.The short burst of localized activity (e.g. at the EGR-1 locus) would ensure that ERK will phosphorylate only those substrates that are present at the correct time in the immediate vicinity of the compartmentalized signaling cassette. The sharp peaks of activity will also provide a means for more precise cross-talk timing with other signaling cascades, further increasing specificity (52Kyriakis J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 1238-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the cases studied here, the activation of the ERK cascade components is linked to the elongating Pol II along inducible genes. The tight coupling to Pol II seems like an ideal way for these signal transducers to specifically regulate in a timely fashion serum-induced factors involved in co-transcriptional RNA processing (Fig. 8). In fact, a recent study suggests that synchronized activation of ERK cascade components along genes appears to be important in maintaining effective transcription (11Nelson J.D. LeBoeuf R.C. Bomsztyk K. Diabetes. 2011; 60: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Activation of ERK at Inducible Gene LociThe unexpected kinetic differences between MEK-ERK activities measured in whole cell lysates compared with those measured at the specific genomic sites (Fig. 4) are not consistent with the traditional view of cytoplasmic ERK activation. Thus, these observations raise questions about the pathways that activate ERK at these genes in the absence of comparable changes in the cell as whole. Most of the ERK cascade components (77Zehorai E. Yao Z. Plotnikov A. Seger R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2010; 314: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) as well as RTKs (78Hsu S.C.

Yao Z. Plotnikov A. Seger R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2010; 314: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These factors could be preassembled in the nucleus so that induction of EGR-1 and Nr4A3 may not require serum-induced nuclear translocation of these components. We have measured high constitutive levels of ERK components at the GAPDH gene (supplemental Fig. S2) (11Nelson J.D. LeBoeuf R.C. Bomsztyk K. Diabetes. 2011; 60: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We have also found high constitutive levels of insulin receptor at insulin-responsive genes without detectable insulin (11Nelson J.D. LeBoeuf R.C. Bomsztyk K. Diabetes. 2011; 60: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). EGFR is also bound to genes and exhibits transcriptional activity (76Lin S.Y. Makino K. Xia W. Matin A. Wen Y. Kwong K.Y. Bourguignon L. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Thus, RTKs could also be constitutively preassembled in the nucleus and serve to initiate activation of the ERK cascade module at inducible gene loci. Because we did not detect RAS, Ran, known to be chromatin-associated and to interact with Shc (81George R. Chan H.L. Ahmed Z. Suen K.M. Stevens C.N. Levitt J.A. Suhling K. Timms J. Ladbury J.E. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), could be an alternative small GTPase that could link nuclear RTKs to Grb2/SOS. We have found that a specific MEK inhibitor, U0126, blocks inducible recruitment of all components, GRB2, SOS, B-Raf, MEK, and ERK, to the EGR-1 gene without any effects on histone marks (supplemental Fig. S5, rows 8 and 9). This observation suggests the presence of a different upstream activation ERK cascade module that indirectly controls the ERK signaling microcircuit at the EGR-1 gene. For example, a cytoplasmic ERK activation module could drive nuclear translocation, binding, and activation of SRF, Elk (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S3), and/or other transcription factors to the EGR-1 locus initiating Pol II recruitment/elongation. In turn, hnRNP K binding activates the ERK microcircuit, a process that may involve all of the cascade components including chromatin-bound RTKs.hnRNP K acts as a docking platform at sites of RNA-directed processes (22Adolph D. Flach N. Mueller K. Ostareck D.H. Ostareck-Lederer A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 1758-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 31Bomsztyk K. Denisenko O. Ostrowski J.

Cell Host Microbe. 2008; 4: 398-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). hnRNP K exists in complexes with ERK1/2 and regulates their activities (40Laury-Kleintop L.D. Tresini M. Hammond O. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 95: 1042-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 82Wolf D. Witte V. Clark P. Blume K. Lichtenheld M.G. Baur A.S. Cell Host Microbe. 2008; 4: 398-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We show that in response to serum treatment, hnRNP K recruitment along the EGR-1 gene is linked to Pol II transcription (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). The hnRNP K knockdown inhibited MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 activities along the EGR-1 and NR4A3 genes (Fig. 5). This observation is consistent with a model where K protein is a functional scaffold for the ERK cascade along these loci.ERK Targets along Inducible GenesThere could be several targets of the K protein-mediated discrete activation and recruitment of ERK1/2 along the EGR-1 and NR4A3 genes. Inhibition of MEK-ERK activity by hnRNP K knockdown had little or no effect on Pol II occupancy along the EGR-1 and NR4A3 genes (Fig. 5), suggesting that processivity was not altered. Pol II processivity can be uncoupled from the rate of elongation (84Mason P.B. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 831-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Moreover, pre-mRNA processing is linked to Pol II elongation. Consistent with this view, we provide evidence that K protein regulates both the rate of elongation and splicing (Fig. 6). Thus, ERK cascade targets could include elongation and/or splicing factors.ERK1/2 phosphorylates Ser-284 and Ser-353 of hnRNP K (29Habelhah H. Shah K. Huang L. Ostareck-Lederer A. Burlingame A.L. Shokat K.M. Hentze M.W. Ronai Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Thus, after hnRNP K-mediated ERK activation along the EGR-1 gene, the K protein itself may become ERK substrate regulating the splicing activity of K. ERK-mediated phosphorylation also drives K protein export from the nucleus (29Habelhah H. Shah K. Huang L. Ostareck-Lederer A. Burlingame A.L. Shokat K.M. Hentze M.W. Ronai Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). ERK-mediated phosphorylation of hnRNP K increases stability of K protein-bound transcripts (20Chen L.C. Liu H.P. Li H.P. Hsueh C. Yu J.S. Liang C.L. Chang Y.S. Oncogene. 2009; 28: 1904-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and also drives K protein export from the nucleus (29Habelhah H. Shah K. Huang L. Ostareck-Lederer A. Burlingame A.L. Shokat K.M. Hentze M.W. Ronai Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Thus, the ERK-catalyzed phosphorylation can also play a role in hnRNP K-bound EGR-1 mRNA stability and transport to the cytoplasm (Fig. 8).In sum, we obtained evidence that nearly the full complement of the ERK cascade components is recruited along the inducible genes coupled to Pol II elongation. Binding of hnRNP K that accompanies these signal transducers plays a role in MEK1/2 recruitment and ERK1/2 activation along the inducible EGR-1 and NR4A3 loci. This study illustrates for the first time how a spatiotemporally restricted chain of events starting with Pol II recruitment followed by K protein binding to inducible loci, presumably to nascent transcript, controls kinases, which in turn regulate rate of mRNA synthesis and processing. In this regard, compartmentalized intracellular bursts of activation of kinase signaling cascades at different time points following mitogenic activation could be a more ubiquitous phenomenon than previously recognized. IntroductionLocalized spatiotemporal activation of kinases is an important mode to regulate kinase specificity (1Shaul Y.D. Seger R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 1213-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). It has been known for more than 20 years that kinases can translocate to the nucleus (2Nigg E.A. Hilz H. Eppenberger H.M.

In fact, recent observations suggest that activation of entire canonical kinase cascades is recapitulated along gene loci (11Nelson J.D. LeBoeuf R.C. Bomsztyk K. Diabetes. 2011; 60: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Compartmentalization of signaling cascades within discrete genomic regions would serve to control specificity of kinase action (12Murphy L.O. Blenis J. Trends Biochem.

Tight regulation of RIG-I activity is important to prevent ultra-immune responses. In this study, we identified an ARF-like (ARL) family member, ARL16, as a protein that interacts with RIG-I. Overexpression of ARL16, but not its homologous proteins ARL1 and ARF1, inhibited RIG-I-mediated downstream signaling and antiviral activity. Knockdown of endogenous ARL16 by RNAi potentiated Sendai virus-induced IFN-β expression and vesicular stomatitis virus replication. ARL16 interacted with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RIG-I to suppress the association between RIG-I and RNA. ARL16 (T37N) and ARL16Δ45-54, which were restricted to the GTP-disassociated form, did not interact with RIG-I and also lost the inhibitory function. Furthermore, we suggest that endogenous ARL16 changes to GTP binding status upon viral infection and binds with the RIG-I CTD to negatively control its signaling activity. These findings suggested a novel innate immune function for an ARL family member, and a GTP-dependent model in which RIG-I is regulated."
https://openalex.org/W2108228005,"Peptides and proteins possess an inherent propensity to self-assemble into generic fibrillar nanostructures known as amyloid fibrils, some of which are involved in medical conditions such as Alzheimer disease. In certain cases, such structures can self-propagate in living systems as prions and transmit characteristic traits to the host organism. The mechanisms that allow certain amyloid species but not others to function as prions are not fully understood. Much progress in understanding the prion phenomenon has been achieved through the study of prions in yeast as this system has proved to be experimentally highly tractable; but quantitative understanding of the biophysics and kinetics of the assembly process has remained challenging. Here, we explore the assembly of two closely related homologues of the Ure2p protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces paradoxus, and by using a combination of kinetic theory with solution and biosensor assays, we are able to compare the rates of the individual microscopic steps of prion fibril assembly. We find that for these proteins the fragmentation rate is encoded in the structure of the seed fibrils, whereas the elongation rate is principally determined by the nature of the soluble precursor protein. Our results further reveal that fibrils that elongate faster but fracture less frequently can lose their ability to propagate as prions. These findings illuminate the connections between the in vitro aggregation of proteins and the in vivo proliferation of prions, and provide a framework for the quantitative understanding of the parameters governing the behavior of amyloid fibrils in normal and aberrant biological pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2063296257,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) harbors elaborate quality control mechanisms to ensure proper folding and post-translational modifications of polypeptides targeted to this organelle. Once an aberrant protein is detected, it is dislocated from the ER and routed to the proteasome for destruction. Autophagy has been recently implicated in the elevation of the ER stress response; however, the involvement of this pathway in selective removal of ER-associated degradation (ERAD) substrates has not been demonstrated. In the present study, we show that an ER membrane lesion, associated with the accumulation of the yeast ERAD-M substrate 6Myc-Hmg2p elicits the recruitment of Atg8 and elements of the cytosol to vacuole targeting (CVT) to the membrane, leading to attenuation in the degradation process. Deletion of peptide:N-glycanase (PNG1) stabilizes this association, a process accompanied by slowdown of 6Myc-Hmg2p degradation. Truncation of the unstructured C-terminal 23 amino acids of 6Myc-Hmg2p rendered its degradation PNG1-independent and allowed its partial delivery to the vacuole in an autophagy-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate a new conduit for the selective vacuolar/lysosomal removal of ERAD misfolded proteins by an autophagy-related machinery acting concomitantly with the proteasome."
https://openalex.org/W2042078992,"The effect of replacing a histidine ligand on the properties of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) and the structure of the Mn4Ca cluster in Photosystem II (PSII) is studied by x-ray absorption spectroscopy using PSII core complexes from the Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 D1 polypeptide mutant H332E. In the x-ray crystallographic structures of PSII, D1-His332 has been assigned as a direct ligand of a manganese ion, and the mutation of this histidine ligand to glutamate has been reported to prevent the advancement of the OEC beyond the S2Yz• intermediate state. The manganese K-edge (1s core electron to 4p) absorption spectrum of D1-H332E shifts to a lower energy compared with that of the native WT samples, suggesting that the electronic structure of the manganese cluster is affected by the presence of the additional negative charge on the OEC of the mutant. The extended x-ray absorption spectrum shows that the geometric structure of the cluster is altered substantially from that of the native WT state, resulting in an elongation of manganese-ligand and manganese-manganese interactions in the mutant. The strontium-H332E mutant, in which calcium is substituted by strontium, confirms that strontium (calcium) is a part of the altered cluster. The structural perturbations caused by the D1-H332E mutation are much larger than those produced by any biochemical treatment or mutation examined previously with x-ray absorption spectroscopy. The substantial structural changes provide an explanation not only for the altered properties of the D1-H332E mutant but also the importance of the histidine ligand for proper assembly of the Mn4Ca cluster. The effect of replacing a histidine ligand on the properties of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) and the structure of the Mn4Ca cluster in Photosystem II (PSII) is studied by x-ray absorption spectroscopy using PSII core complexes from the Synechocystis sp.

In the x-ray crystallographic structures of PSII, D1-His332 has been assigned as a direct ligand of a manganese ion, and the mutation of this histidine ligand to glutamate has been reported to prevent the advancement of the OEC beyond the S2Yz• intermediate state. The manganese K-edge (1s core electron to 4p) absorption spectrum of D1-H332E shifts to a lower energy compared with that of the native WT samples, suggesting that the electronic structure of the manganese cluster is affected by the presence of the additional negative charge on the OEC of the mutant. The extended x-ray absorption spectrum shows that the geometric structure of the cluster is altered substantially from that of the native WT state, resulting in an elongation of manganese-ligand and manganese-manganese interactions in the mutant. The strontium-H332E mutant, in which calcium is substituted by strontium, confirms that strontium (calcium) is a part of the altered cluster. The structural perturbations caused by the D1-H332E mutation are much larger than those produced by any biochemical treatment or mutation examined previously with x-ray absorption spectroscopy. The substantial structural changes provide an explanation not only for the altered properties of the D1-H332E mutant but also the importance of the histidine ligand for proper assembly of the Mn4Ca cluster."

Members of the Polydnaviridae are divided into two paraphyletic groups as follows: bracoviruses (BVs; genus Bracovirus) and ichnoviruses (genus Ichnovirus), which occur in some members of the wasp families, Braconidae and Ichneumonidae, respectively (5Webb B.A. Beckage N.E.

PDVs are replicated only in the ovaries of female wasps and are not known to affect the wasp (8Beckage N.E. Bioscience. 1997; 48: 305-311Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). PDVs are highly unusual in that individual particles only contain a subset of the expressed genes and do not contain any genes for virus structure/replication. Therefore, the virus is only able to be transmitted vertically (between wasp generations) through the integration of the PDV genome into wasp chromosomes (8Beckage N.E. Bioscience. 1997; 48: 305-311Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 9Stoltz D.B. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 1051-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 10Stoltz D.B. Beckage N.E. Thompson S.N.

Indeed, it was the analysis of nonpackaged PDV genes (such as capsid proteins) that allowed the different ancestral viruses to be differentiated. Prior to this, a range of encapsidated PDV genes and/or gene families was postulated as being immune-suppressive, targeting cellular and humoral (cell-free) aspects of the innate insect immune system (4Glatz R.V.

Other PDV proteins are also thought to target insect immunity, but as yet their class and potential mode-of-action are yet to be elucidated. CrV2, expressed by the Cotesia rubecula bracovirus (CrBV), is an example of such a protein. CrV2 is expressed by CrBV only in the larvae of two closely related butterflies (Pieris spp.) and is secreted into the hemolymph. It was thought to be temporally associated with short term, subtle immune dysfunction in hemocyte cells that take up the secreted protein, although the molecular basis for its effects is not yet understood (26Glatz R. Schmidt O. Asgari S. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 2873-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The protein does not cause toxic effects on the cells that recover their immune function once significant expression of CrV2 (and other early expressed proteins) is reduced. Here, we present data that infer a specific, high affinity interaction between CrV2 and invertebrate/mammalian Gα subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins, which are important cell-signaling proteins, indirectly implicated in vertebrate and invertebrate immune function (see under “Discussion” and Refs. 27Cytryñska M.

There are a variety of subtypes for each G-protein class. The Gα subunit binds guanine nucleotides and exchanges GDP for GTP upon activation of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with which the G-protein is usually associated. Nucleotide exchange causes conformation changes such that the Gα subunit and the Gβγ dimer interact with downstream effectors, including various enzymes and ion channels that alter cellular metabolism (33Oldham W.M. Hamm H.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 60-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). We previously developed a TR-FRET (time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer) assay utilizing a terbium-chelate donor and Alexa546 acceptor to demonstrate interactions of the Gα subunit with the Gβγ dimer and the regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (RGS4) (34Leifert W.R. Bailey K. Cooper T.H. Aloia A.L. Glatz R.V. McMurchie E.J. Anal. Biochem. 2006; 355: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The assay was recently adapted by others to monitor the effect of allosteric modulators of RGS4 in altering RGS4:Gα affinity and further developed into a high throughput screen for other such modulators (35Blazer L.L. Roman D.L. Chung A. Larsen M.J. Greedy B.M. Husbands S.M. Neubig R.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2010; 78: 524-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Generally, TR-FRET uses a lanthanide donor fluorophore (such as terbium or europium) in combination with an appropriate acceptor (with an excitation spectrum overlapping the donor emission spectrum). When the fluorophores are in close proximity (<100 Å), energy transfer occurs between them, and acceptor emission is measured to determine binding kinetics (36Selvin P.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 275-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Using a lanthanide donor increases the signal:noise ratio when the long lived luminescence (characteristic of lanthanides) is exploited with time-gated measurements that eliminate short lived background signals. Lanthanides also exhibit other favorable properties, including multiple emission peaks, a large Stokes shift, and nonpolarized emission (37Nishioka T. Yuan J. Matsumoto K. Ferrari M. Ozkan M. Heller M.J. BioMEMS and Biomedical Nanotechnology. 3. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York2007: 437-446Google Scholar, 38Roda A. Guardigli M. Michelini E. Mirasoli M. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2009; 393: 109-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).As part of validating the original TR-FRET assay, we determined that the CrV2 protein appeared to specifically interact with mammalian Gα subunits. Here, we adapt our TR-FRET assay to demonstrate a high affinity (nanomolar) interaction of acceptor-labeled CrV2 with mammalian and insect donor-labeled Gα. We also demonstrate that recombinant CrV2 is taken up by a specific hemocyte morphotype from larval Pieris rapae, which are key immune cells, where it could potentially interact with cellular proteins such as Gα. These results are intriguing as they suggest that insect hemocyte immune function could be regulated through G-protein signaling pathways and that some PDVs subvert host immunity by producing proteins that interact with Gα to alter immune signaling. This mode-of-action for immune suppression has not previously been reported, and its elucidation has the potential to facilitate the development of novel insect controls.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAll chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade and purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. All buffers were made in Milli-Q water.Production and Purification of Recombinant CrV2 and G-protein SubunitsTo produce CrV2 used in cell and far Western blot experiments, PCR was used to generate full CrV2 constructs containing the N-terminal signal peptide with a His tag incorporated at the 3′ end and NotI and KpnI restriction enzyme sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The forward primer sequence was 5′-gcg gcc gca tgt tgt cta caa agc-3′, and the reverse primer sequence was 5′-ggt acc tta gtg atg gtg atg gtg atg ggg atg atc tcg agc cct-3′. PCR products were produced with proofreading polymerase and cloned into pCR®-Blunt (Invitrogen) to allow subsequent restriction of the cloned products for insertion into pFastBac1 (Invitrogen). Recombinant baculovirus was then generated using the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Sf9 cells at 2 × 106 cells/ml were infected with amplified virus at a multiplicity of infection of ∼2 for 48–72 h in suspension at 27 °C with shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and expression was confirmed by Western blot. The media containing secreted CrV2 were stored at −20 °C or −80 °C for longer term storage.To produce purified recombinant CrV2 for TR-FRET experiments, the coding sequence without the first 21 N-terminal amino acids, which contain the secretory signal peptide, was cloned into pQE30 (Qiagen) and transformed into M15[pREP4] Escherichia coli as per Glatz et al. (26Glatz R. Schmidt O. Asgari S. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 2873-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Expression of recombinant CrV2 was induced in 400-ml bacterial cultures in YT broth (8 g/liter tryptone, 5 g/liter yeast extract, 2.5 g/liter NaCl, pH 7.0) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Induced bacterial cells were pelleted by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C. Cells were later resuspended in 10 ml of TBP buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02 mg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.03 mg/ml benzamidine). Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml and gently mixed at 4 °C for 30 min. MgCl2 was then added to a final concentration of 5 mm followed by DNase I to a concentration of 0.01 mg/ml. Mixing was continued for a further 30 min. Twenty percent (w/v) cholate solution (50 mm NaHEPES, pH 8.0, 3 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and 200 g/liter cholic acid (Na+)) was added to give a final cholate concentration of 1% (v/v). The preparation was then gently stirred (1 h at 4 °C) before ultracentrifugation in a Beckman Coulter OptimaTM LE-80K at 100,000 × g for 40 min. Ni-NTA-agarose beads (800 μl; Qiagen) in TBP (50%) were added to the supernatant and incubated on ice for 30 min with occasional stirring. Supernatants were then applied to gravity-fed columns. Columns were then washed with 20 ml of TBP containing 100 mm NaCl followed by washing with 5 ml of TBP containing 100 mm NaCl and 10 mm imidazole. All washing procedures were carried out at 4 °C. His-tagged CrV2 was eluted from the column in 400-μl fractions using TBP containing 100 mm NaCl and 250 mm imidazole. Elution fractions were run on a polyacrylamide gel and stained using Coomassie Blue. Elutions containing CrV2 were identified and fractions pooled. Protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213288) Google Scholar) or by laser densitometry, before aliquoting and storage at −80 °C.G-protein subunits were produced from 1 to 2 liters of Sf9 cells infected with the desired recombinant baculovirus. Recombinant full-length Drosophila Gαo (isoform I)-expressing baculovirus was produced using the Bac-to-Bac expression system as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Cell culture, virus amplifications, and infections, as well as the purification of G-protein subunits using Ni-NTA-agarose beads and fluorescent labeling of G-proteins or CrV2 with cysteine-reactive Alexa Fluor 546 C5-maleimide (Invitrogen) or CS124-DTPA-EMCH-Tb (Invitrogen), were performed as described by Leifert et al. (34Leifert W.R. Bailey K. Cooper T.H. Aloia A.L. Glatz R.V. McMurchie E.J. Anal. Biochem. 2006; 355: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Antibody Labeling of CrV2 in Hemocytes in VitroLarval P. rapae were surface-sterilized in ice-cold 70% ethanol for a few minutes and then kept on ice until they were bled from a severed proleg directly into an ice-chilled 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube containing ∼200 μl of Sf900II medium (Invitrogen) saturated with phenylthiourea (which inhibits melanization reactions). Hemocytes were aliquoted into wells of a printed glass slide and incubated at room temperature until cells attached, and spreading was observed. Obviously, spread cells were considered to be a plasmatocyte morphotype and attached cells that retained a rounded, apparently unspread, conformation were considered as a granulocyte morphotype. Insect cell culture medium containing secreted baculovirus-expressed CrV2 was applied to the hemocyte-containing slides and incubated for the desired time. Medium was then removed, and cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 4 min, and washed in TBST (8.8 g/liter NaCl, 0.2 g/liter KCl, 3 g/liter Trizma (Tris base), 500 μl/liter Tween 20 detergent). Anti-CrV2 polyclonal rabbit antibodies (26Glatz R. Schmidt O. Asgari S. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 2873-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) in TBST (1:500) were added to the glass slide and incubated for 1.5–2 h at room temperature. Cells were washed with TBST, and fluorphore-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:200–250) with 1:50 dilution of FITC-phalloidin (0.1 mg/ml) in TBST were applied to slides for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Cells were then washed with TBST and stained with 1:10,000 dilution (1 μg/ml) of DAPI for 5 min. Cells were then washed with TBST and PBS; a coverslip was applied, and the coverslip sealed with nail varnish.TR-FRET AssaysThe interaction between Alexa546 (Alexa)- and CS124-DTPA-EMCH-Tb (Tb)-labeled proteins was measured using TR-FRET as described in Leifert et al. (34Leifert W.R. Bailey K. Cooper T.H. Aloia A.L. Glatz R.V. McMurchie E.J. Anal. Biochem. 2006; 355: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, these experiments were conducted in black 96-well plates. 20× working solutions of proteins were made in TMN buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2). Five microliters of each was then applied to opposite sides of the well such that mixing did not occur. Other indicated components such as proteinase K could also be added in this manner where required. TMN buffer was then added to give a final assay volume of 100 μl, and the reaction was initiated by mixing of all components. TR-FRET was then measured using a Victor3 multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and a delay of 50 μs, before measuring the emission at 572 nm for 900 μs. Where appropriate, measurements were ceased so that unlabeled proteins or buffer could be added and then measurements resumed.[35S]GTPγS Binding Assay40 nm purified Gα subunit or CrV2 was mixed with 1 nm [35S]GTPγS in a final volume of 100 μl of TMN buffer and incubated in a shaking water bath for 90 min at 27 °C. Twenty five microliters in triplicate were then filtered through glass microfiber 1-μm filter papers (GFCs; Filtech), and unbound [35S]GTPγS was removed by washing with three times with 4 ml of TMN buffer. The filters were then dried, and the amount of bound [35S]GTPγS was measured by scintillation counting for 60 s in Pico Pro VialsTM with 4 ml of Ultima GoldTM scintillation mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a Wallac 1410 liquid scintillation counter.Far Western AssayPurified Drosophila Gαo and bovine serum albumin were subjected to SDS-PAGE on an “any kDa” TGX gel (Bio-Rad) using a nonreducing sample buffer. Proteins were transferred onto a Hybond-C nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare) at 100 V for 1 h. Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk powder in TBS buffer (8.8 g/liter NaCl, 0.2g/liter KCl, 3 g/liter Trizma) for >2 h. Membranes were then probed with CrV2 in Sf900II medium or conditioned medium overnight. Membranes were then washed with TBST buffer (see above) and probed with rabbit anti-CrV2 (1:10,000) in blocking solution for 2 h. Following washing with TBST, membranes were probed with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:20,000) in blocking solution for 2 h. Membranes were washed with TBST and developed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate p-toluidine salt and nitro blue tetrazolium chloride to detect any CrV2 bound to Gαo.TR-FRET Data AnalysesData were analyzed using PrismTM 4.00 (GraphPad software Inc., San Diego). Data are presented as mean ± S.E., where n is equal or greater than 3. Where n = 2, data are presented as the mean, and error bars represent the range of the duplicates. If error bars are not visible, they are small and therefore hidden by the symbols.Amino Acid Sequence AnalysesThe CrV2 amino acid sequence was subjected to protein Blast (blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) to detect any similar protein sequences. Three similar sequences were detected. ClustalW2 software was then used to align the amino acid sequences of the four similar proteins and to produce a simple phylogenetic tree of the four protein sequences. Protein BLAST was also used to determine the amino acid identity between the two experimental Gα subunits used here, i.e. rat Gαi1 (GenBankTM accession number NP_037277) and Drosophila melanogaster Gαo isoform I (GenBankTM accession number AAS64873).

PDVs are replicated only in the ovaries of female wasps and are not known to affect the wasp (8Beckage N.E. Bioscience. 1997; 48: 305-311Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). PDVs are highly unusual in that individual particles only contain a subset of the expressed genes and do not contain any genes for virus structure/replication. Therefore, the virus is only able to be transmitted vertically (between wasp generations) through the integration of the PDV genome into wasp chromosomes (8Beckage N.E.

Indeed, it was the analysis of nonpackaged PDV genes (such as capsid proteins) that allowed the different ancestral viruses to be differentiated.

Mutations that cause these dominantly inherited neurodegenerative diseases greatly increase the propensity of the mutant proteins to self-associate into protein aggregates in vitro and in vivo (4Fink A.L. Fold. Des. 1998; 3: R9-R23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 5Wanker E.E. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 937-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Aggregation of misfolded proteins is also caused by aberrant protein modifications, translational errors, and environmental stresses, such as non-native conditions of pH, temperature, ionic strength, and oxidation (6Garcia-Mata R. Gao Y.S. Sztul E. Traffic. 2002; 3: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Quality control mechanisms, such as molecular chaperones and the ubiquitin-proteasome system, may refold or degrade abnormal proteins and prevent the toxic accumulation of small aggregates. However, when the capacity of chaperones and the ubiquitin-proteasome system is overwhelmed or evaded, the resulting numerous small protein aggregates dispersed throughout the cell are actively cleared via transport to intracellular IBs. These IBs, termed “aggresomes” or “aggresome-like inclusions,” which are conserved from yeast to mammalian cells, act as storage bins for protein aggregates (2Kopito R.R. Trends Cell. Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar, 6Garcia-Mata R. Gao Y.S. Sztul E.

The formation of aggresomes is believed to serve a cellular cytoprotective function by the removal of toxic protein aggregates via sequestration, refolding, or degradation (8Arrasate M. Mitra S. Schweitzer E.S. Segal M.R. Finkbeiner S. Nature. 2004; 431: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar). Aggresomes are found either in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus depending on the particular disease or mutant protein. In Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion diseases, aggresomes reside exclusively in the cytoplasm and exist as a single large perinuclear IB at the microtubule-organizing center. Cytoplasmic aggresomes form by retrograde dynein-dependent transport of misfolded protein aggregates along microtubules toward the microtubule-organizing center (2Kopito R.R. Trends Cell. Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar, 6Garcia-Mata R. Gao Y.S. Sztul E.

Biol. 1999; 146: 1239-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The microtubule-associated histone deacetylase HDAC6 was shown to play an essential role in the transport of polyubiquitinated misfolded protein aggregates by its ability to interact with both ubiquitin and dynein motors (10Kawaguchi Y. Kovacs J.J. McLaurin A. Vance J.M. Ito A. Yao T.P. Cell. 2003; 115: 727-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar, 11Johnston J.A. Dalton M.J. Gurney M.E. Kopito R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 12571-12576Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Other ubiquitin-binding proteins, including protein linking integrin-associated protein to cytoskeleton and ataxin-3, were also shown to regulate targeting of proteins to aggresomes. A second distinct pattern of aggresome formation is seen in the polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases, including Huntington disease, spinobulbar muscular atrophy, and the spinocerebellar ataxias 1, 3, and 7 (3Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). These diseases are caused by a single type of mutation, the expansion of CAG repeats encoding a tract of uninterrupted polyglutamines, in otherwise unrelated proteins. Although clinically and pathologically distinct, a single unifying feature of polyQ diseases is the formation of aggresome-like IBs located primarily in the nucleus. These intranuclear aggresomes contain aggregates of misfolded mutant proteins and are invariably linked to end stage neurodegenerative disease. The mechanisms involved in the formation of intranuclear aggresomes are not understood. Studies in transgenic mice and in cell culture have shown that nuclear IBs are enriched in chaperones and proteasomal subunits (12Chai Y. Wu L. Griffin J.D. Paulson H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44889-44897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 13Cummings C.J. Mancini M.A. Antalffy B. DeFranco D.B. Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Differences exist between the nuclear and cytoplasmic aggresomes. Unlike the solitary inclusion body at the microtubule-organizing center characteristic of cytoplasmic aggresomes, intranuclear aggresomes exist as multiple discrete inclusions. The absence from the nucleus of an extensive network of microtubules, which is essential to cytoplasmic aggresome formation, would indicate differences in the mechanisms of nuclear aggresome formation. The formation of nuclear aggresomes by a variety of different mutant proteins is invariably accompanied by the redistribution and recruitment of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein. Because PML resides exclusively within the nucleus, it is unlikely that it would be recruited to cytoplasmic aggresomes at the microtubule-organizing center via microtubules. The link between polyQ expansions and the formation of intranuclear aggresomes initially suggested that their formation was induced by mechanisms that specifically respond to polyQ tract expansions. However, several mutant proteins that lack polyQ domains activate the formation of nuclear aggresomes that share characteristics of nuclear aggresomes induced by mutant polyQ proteins. GFP-170*, consisting of GFP fused to a portion of the Golgi complex protein 170, induced the formation of nuclear aggresomes that recruited PML protein, the chaperones HSP70 and HDJ2, and proteasomal subunit-α (14Fu L.

Housman D.E. Thompson L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6763-6768Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). Another mutant protein, REDΔ87–113GFP, which lacks a polyQ domain and contains a polar zipper repeat domain, was also shown to induce nuclear aggresomes that resembled those formed by mutant polyQ-containing ataxin-1 (18Dovey C.L. Varadaraj A. Wyllie A.H. Rich T. J. Pathol. 2004; 203: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cellular and environmental stresses, such as generation of reactive oxygen species and irradiation, have also been shown to induce the formation of nuclear aggresomes that resemble those generated by mutant polyQ proteins (19Moran D.M. Shen H. Maki C.G. BMC Cell. Biol. 2009; 10: 32Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 20Qin Q. Inatome R. Hotta A. Kojima M. Yamamura H. Hirai H. Yoshizawa T. Tanaka H. Fukami K. Yanagi S. J. Cell. Biol. 2006; 172: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The tight association between polyQ expansions and nuclear aggresomes indicates a degree of specificity in the mechanisms that activate the nuclear aggresome pathway. However, the induction of this pathway by at least two non-polyQ mutant GFP fusion proteins and by environmental stresses also indicates that the sensing and activation mechanism is not restricted to expansions of polyQ tracts. The mutations introduced into the two previously described non-polyQ protein inducers of the nuclear aggresome pathway each consist of a large deletion of the native protein and the fusion of a 238-amino acid GFP moiety. These chimeric mutants thus do not elucidate the precise nature of the alterations recognized by the sensing mechanism. It would be desirable therefore to limit the mutation recognized by the nuclear aggresome pathway to as small a region as possible, ideally a single amino acid change. This would enhance the opportunity to specifically characterize the nature of the conformational change that activates the nuclear aggresome pathway. In this study, we describe the induction of nuclear aggresomes by the introduction of single missense mutation in a non-polyQ protein, Bam HI Z E B virus replication activator (ZEBRA). Furthermore, by analyzing several missense mutations at various positions in ZEBRA, we demonstrate the utility of this system in investigating the precise changes responsible for activating the nuclear aggresome pathway. ZEBRA, encoded by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) BZLF1 gene, is the major regulator of the lytic phase of EBV. ZEBRA is a 245-amino acid (aa) protein that belongs to the basic zipper (bZIP) family of transcription factors that includes the AP-1 transcription factors c-Fos and c-Jun. ZEBRA can be modified by phosphorylation (21El-Guindy A.S. Miller G. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 7634-7644Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and SUMOylation (22Adamson A.L. Kenney S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2388-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). ZEBRA homodimerizes and binds DNA at canonical AP-1 sites (TGAGTCA) via the bZIP domain (23Farrell P.J. Rowe D.T. Rooney C.M. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 24Lieberman P.M. Hardwick J.M. Sample J. Hayward G.S. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1143-1155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, unlike c-FOS, ZEBRA also binds degenerate AP-1-like heptad sequences with the consensus sequence 5′-T(T/G)(T/A)G(T/C)(G/C/A)A-3′ (25Lehman A.M. Ellwood K.B. Middleton B.E. Carey M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 932-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), termed “ZEBRA-responsive elements.” The bZIP domain of ZEBRA encompasses the basic DNA-binding domain (aa 178–194) and the dimerization domain (aa 195–225) (26Chang Y.N. Dong D.L. Hayward G.S. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3358-3369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nine of 17 aa in the DNA-binding domain are arginines or lysines. The crystal structure of the S186A/C189A mutant of ZEBRA bound to an AP-1 site showed a continuous α helix between aa 175 and 221 (27Petosa C. Morand P. Baudin F. Moulin M. Artero J.B. Müller C.W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 565-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Other bZIP proteins whose structures have been solved also showed a long continuous α helix encompassing their bZIP domains (28Ellenberger T.E. Brandl C.J. Struhl K. Harrison S.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 1223-1237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 29Glover J.N. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Heston et al. (30Heston L. El-Guindy A. Countryman J. Dela Cruz C. Delecluse H.J. Miller G. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 9115-9133Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) analyzed an extensive series of single amino acid substitutions introduced throughout the basic domain of ZEBRA. Of these mutants, 27 retained the capacity to bind DNA yet showed specific defects in the ability to activate different phases of the lytic cycle. These defects in transcriptional activation were accompanied by distinct changes in the localization of ZEBRA and in the capacity to induce the formation of replication compartments (31Park R. Heston L. Shedd D. Delecluse H.J. Miller G. Virology. 2008; 382: 145-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Nineteen of the 46 mutations abolished the ability of ZEBRA to bind ZIIIB, a high affinity ZEBRA-responsive element, as seen by mobility shift assay. Each of these 19 DNA binding-defective mutants was also incapable of activating the lytic cycle of EBV. The initial impetus of the current study was to observe the localization of several mutants of ZEBRA that were severely impaired in DNA binding. We report here that specific single missense mutations within the basic domain of ZEBRA induce the formation of nuclear aggresomes, which strongly sequester the mutant protein. The aggresomes contain two identifying components of nuclear aggresomes, HSP70 and PML protein. These aggresomes have the characteristic ability to recruit and sequester other specific non-mutated cellular proteins, including HDAC6 and SC35, and viral proteins, including those encoded by BZLF1, BRLF1, and BMLF1 genes. Transfection of aggresome-inducing mutants of ZEBRA strongly inhibits the lytic cycle and replication of EBV. A review of those missense mutations that can induce the nuclear aggresome response suggests that the mutations responsible for inducing aggresomes may be limited to conversion of a basic amino acid (arginine or lysine) to an acidic amino acid as well as additional contributing factors, such as the absence of contact of ZEBRA with the phosphate backbone of DNA. The procedure for construction of the bzlf1 mutants has been described (30Heston L. El-Guindy A. Countryman J. Dela Cruz C. Delecluse H.J. Miller G. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 9115-9133Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The 10 mutants analyzed in this study were as follows: K178D (AAG to GAC), K178E (AAG to GAA), R179E (CGA to GAA), N182K (AAT to AAG), N182E (AAT to GAG), R183E (CGG to GAG), S186E (TCC to GAG), R190E (CGG to GAG), K194D (AAG to GAC), and K194E (AAG to GAA). 293 cells are a human embryonic kidney cell line immortalized by the early region of adenovirus (32Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J.

In immunofluorescence experiments, ZEBRA was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (S1605) or a mouse monoclonal antibody (BZ1) (35Young L.S. Lau R. Rowe M. Niedobitek G. Packham G. Shanahan F.

S1605 was prepared from rabbits immunized with full-length ZEBRA protein that was expressed in Escherichia coli from a pET22b vector containing the BZLF1 cDNA and purified over a nickel-agarose column.

BFRF3 was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (S1931-1) raised against full-length BFRF3 protein expressed and purified from E. coli. Lamin B was detected using a commercially available goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-6216). Secondary antibodies used in immunofluorescence experiments were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories: FITC-sheep anti-mouse IgG (515-095-062), Texas Red-donkey anti-rabbit IgG (711-075-152), FITC-donkey anti-goat IgG (705-095-147), Rhodamine Red X-donkey anti-rabbit IgG (711-295-152), and DyLight 549-donkey anti-rabbit IgG (711-505-152). 2089 and 293 cells grown on glass coverslips were transfected with plasmid DNA using dimyristyl Rosenthal inhibitor ether-C reagent (Invitrogen). After 8 h, the transfection reagent was replaced with growth medium. Forty-two hours after transfection, a time previously determined to be adequate for detection of lytic viral DNA replication, cells were fixed in methanol for 30 min at −20 °C, washed with PBS, and incubated in blocking solution (10% human serum in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were stained with primary antibody diluted in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature in humidified chambers. Cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with secondary antibody diluted 1:200 in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature in opaque humidified chambers. Cells were washed with PBS, briefly rinsed in distilled H2O to remove salts, and then mounted on glass slides using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). A Zeiss LSM510 confocal laser scanning microscope was used to obtain digital images of fluorescence and transmitted light. Excited fluorophore emissions were collected either individually or simultaneously under detection settings that reduced cross-talk between the green and red channels to non-detectable levels. BZKO cells were transfected by DMRIE-C reagent (Invitrogen). Cells initially plated at 2 × 105 cells/well of a 6-well plate were transfected after 4–5 days when they were 80% confluent. Constant amounts of wild-type (WT) genomic ZEBRA gene were mixed with increasing amounts of Z(R183E) or Z(R179E) plasmids in 3 ml of Opti-MEM containing 36 μl of DMRIE-C reagent. After 72 h of incubation at 37 °C, BZKO cells were removed from the plastic surface by forceful pipetting, pooled, centrifuged, and resuspended in PBS. The cell suspension was divided into five tubes and spun down. Each cell pellet was flash frozen. To assay for viral proteins, one pellet, containing 2 × 106 cells, was resuspended in 40 μl of SDS sample buffer. Samples were sonicated for 30 s and heated to 100 °C for 5 min. 40 μl was loaded per lane of a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by being electroblotted for 30 min at 15 V using a Bio-Rad Transblot semidry transfer cell. The blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h and incubated for 1–2 h with human, rabbit, or murine antibodies (diluted in 5% nonfat dry milk) to EBV lytic cycle proteins. The blots were washed twice in Tris-saline (TS) (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5% Tween 20), incubated for 1–2 h with secondary antibodies (diluted in 5% nonfat dry milk) appropriate for the species, and washed twice in TS. To detect immunoreactive bands, blots were incubated with 1 μCi of 125I-protein A (Amersham Biosciences) in nonfat dry milk for 1 h and washed twice. The blots were exposed overnight with intensifying screens to Eastman Kodak Co. XAR-5 film at −70 °C. 2089 cells were transfected with WT gZ-CMV and Z(R183E)-CMV plasmids using DMRIE-C reagent (Invitrogen). Samples were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C, rinsed in PBS, resuspended in 10% gelatin, chilled, then trimmed to smaller blocks, and placed in cryoprotectant (2.3 m sucrose) overnight at 4 °C. Blocks were transferred to aluminum pins and frozen rapidly in liquid nitrogen. Frozen blocks were trimmed on a Leica cryo-EM UC6 UltraCut, and 75-nm-thick sections were collected using the method of Tokuyasu (37Tokuyasu K.T. J. Cell. Biol. 1983; 97: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Sections were placed on a nickel Formvar/carbon-coated grid and floated in a dish of PBS for immunolabeling. Grids were placed section side down on drops of 0.1 m ammonium chloride for 10 min to quench untreated aldehyde groups, and then blocked with 1% fish skin gelatin in PBS for 20 min. Single labeled grids were incubated with rabbit anti-ZEBRA IgG for 30 min. After rinsing, grids were placed on protein A-gold (University Medical Center Utrecht) for 30 min, rinsed in PBS, and then fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde for 5 min. Grids were rinsed again, transferred to a uranyl acetate/methylcellulose drop for 10 min, then collected, and dried. Samples were viewed on a FEI Tencai Biotwin transmission electron microscope at 80 kV. Images were taken using a Morada charge-coupled device camera and iTEM (Olympus) software. BZKO cells were transfected by DMRIE-C reagent (Invitrogen) with WT gZ-CMV, Z(S186A)-CMV, Z(R183E)-CMV, and CMV (empty vector) plasmids. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested. 1.2 × 107 cells were used for the nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation, and the remaining cells were resuspended in SDS sample buffer at 106 cells/μl as whole cell extracts. Cells were centrifuged, washed with PBS, centrifuged again, and then lysed in Buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1.0 mm DTT, 2 mm PMSF) with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 10 min on ice. The lysate was centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was saved as the cytoplasmic fraction. The pellet was washed twice with Buffer A and then resuspended in Buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 420 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm DTT, 25% glycerol). Samples were incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was saved as the nuclear fraction. The protein content of the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions was determined by the Bradford assay. 30 μg of nuclear or cytoplasmic protein extract was mixed with 20 μl of SDS sample buffer. The whole cell extract was sonicated for 30 s. All samples were heated at 100 °C for 5 min and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. DNA was extracted, purified, and digested with BamHI as described in Heston et al. (30Heston L. El-Guindy A. Countryman J. Dela Cruz C. Delecluse H.J. Miller G. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 9115-9133Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, DNA was denatured with 0.4 m NaOH and transferred to a Zeta-Probe GT genomic membrane (Bio-Rad) by Southern blotting procedure. One probe for Southern blots was made from a subregion of the unique XhoI 1.9-kb sequence found adjacent to the terminal repeats in the B95-8 EBV genome (38Raab-Traub N. Flynn K. Cell. 1986; 47: 883-889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). A 336-bp subfragment was isolated from pBR/XhoI 1.9 by PCR using the primers 5′-CTCACGAGCAGGTGG and 5′-CGCAGTCTTAGGTATCTGG. The other probe was EBV BamHI W. The PCR product or restriction fragment to be used as a probe was excised from an 0.8% low melting point agarose gel and processed with a Gene Clean II kit (Q-Biogene). The excised DNA (4 μl) was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using 1 ng of random primer oligonucleotides (GE Healthcare) and 10 units of the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). The labeled DNA was separated from unincorporated radioactive nucleotides on a G-50 Sephadex spin column. The probe was hybridized to the Zeta-Probe membrane at 65 °C in 6× SSC (1× SSC is 0.15 m NaCl plus 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.1% Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA for at least 16 h. The membrane was washed and exposed to film. We investigated the intracellular localization of 10 point mutants within the basic DNA-binding region of ZEBRA that abolished the ability of the protein to bind DNA (Fig. 1). These included seven mutants, K178D, K178E, R179E, R183E, R190E, K194D, and K194E, in which a basic aa was replaced by an acidic aa. These mutants were selected for study because 11 of the 19 non-DNA-binding mutants generated by Heston et al. (30Heston L. El-Guindy A. Countryman J. Dela Cruz C. Delecluse H.J. Miller G. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 9115-9133Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) had replaced a basic aa with an acidic aa. The other three mutants were N182K in which a neutral aa was replaced by a basic aa, N182E in which a neutral aa was replaced by an acidic aa, and S186E in which the well studied serine at position 186, required for BRLF1 activation and absent from other AP-1-binding proteins (39Francis A.L. Gradoville L. Miller G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3054-3061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was changed to a glutamate. We transfected 2089 cells, which are 293 cells containing an EBV bacmid, with wild-type ZEBRA or each of the 10 non-DNA-binding mutants; the localization"

In this study, treatment of bone marrow-derived mast cells with prostaglandin D(2) reduced their ability to generate leukotriene (LT) C(4) upon calcium ionophore stimulation but had little effect on LTB(4) generation. This effect could be reproduced by a selective agonist of the DP(2) receptor, 15R-methyl prostaglandin D(2) (15R-D(2)). 15R-D(2) dose-dependently inhibited LTC(4) generation with an IC(50) of 2 μM, and the effect was not altered by a DP(2)/thromboxane antagonist or by a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ antagonist. 15R-D(2) exerted its suppressive effect via a reduction in intracellular GSH, a mechanism that involved the conjugation of its non-enzymatic breakdown product to GSH. At 10 μM, 15R-D(2) reduced LTC(4) generation to 10%, intracellular GSH to 50%, and LTC(4) synthase (LTC(4)S) activity to 33.5% of untreated cells without altering immunoreactive LTC(4)S protein expression or 5-lipoxygenase activity. The effects of 15R-D(2) on LTC(4)S activity could be partially reversed by reducing reagent. The sulfhydryl-reactive oxidative agent diamide suppressed LTC(4)S activity and induced a reversible formation of covalent dimer LTC(4)S. LTC(4)S bearing a C56S mutation was resistant to the effect of diamide. Covalent dimer LTC(4)S was observed in nasal polyp biopsies, indicating that dimerization and inactivation of LTC(4)S can occur at the site of inflammation. These results suggest a cellular redox regulation of LTC(4)S function through a post-translational mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2017447338,"Cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes are critical regulators of cellular proliferation. A complex network of regulatory mechanisms has evolved to control their activity, including activating and inactivating phosphorylation of the catalytic CDK subunit and inhibition through specific regulatory proteins. Primate herpesviruses, including the oncogenic Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus, encode cyclin D homologues. Viral cyclins have diverged from their cellular progenitor in that they elicit holoenzyme activity independent of activating phosphorylation by the CDK-activating kinase and resistant to inhibition by CDK inhibitors. Using sequence comparison and site-directed mutagenesis, we performed molecular analysis of the cellular cyclin D and the Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus-cyclin to delineate the molecular mechanisms behind their different behavior. This provides evidence that a surface recognized for its involvement in the docking of CIP/KIP inhibitors is required and sufficient to modulate cyclin-CDK response to a range of regulatory cues, including INK4 sensitivity and CDK-activating kinase dependence. Importantly, amino acids in this region are critically linked to substrate selection, suggesting that a mutational drift in this surface simultaneously affects function and regulation. Together our work provides novel insight into the molecular mechanisms governing cyclin-CDK function and regulation and defines the biological forces that may have driven evolution of viral cyclins."
