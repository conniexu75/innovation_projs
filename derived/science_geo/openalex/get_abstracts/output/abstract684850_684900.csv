https://openalex.org/W3216628913,"Quantum many-body systems display rich phase structure in their low-temperature equilibrium states1. However, much of nature is not in thermal equilibrium. Remarkably, it was recently predicted that out-of-equilibrium systems can exhibit novel dynamical phases2-8 that may otherwise be forbidden by equilibrium thermodynamics, a paradigmatic example being the discrete time crystal (DTC)7,9-15. Concretely, dynamical phases can be defined in periodically driven many-body-localized (MBL) systems via the concept of eigenstate order7,16,17. In eigenstate-ordered MBL phases, the entire many-body spectrum exhibits quantum correlations and long-range order, with characteristic signatures in late-time dynamics from all initial states. It is, however, challenging to experimentally distinguish such stable phases from transient phenomena, or from regimes in which the dynamics of a few select states can mask typical behaviour. Here we implement tunable controlled-phase (CPHASE) gates on an array of superconducting qubits to experimentally observe an MBL-DTC and demonstrate its characteristic spatiotemporal response for generic initial states7,9,10. Our work employs a time-reversal protocol to quantify the impact of external decoherence, and leverages quantum typicality to circumvent the exponential cost of densely sampling the eigenspectrum. Furthermore, we locate the phase transition out of the DTC with an experimental finite-size analysis. These results establish a scalable approach to studying non-equilibrium phases of matter on quantum processors."
https://openalex.org/W3216791550,"CD8 T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases result from the breakdown of self-tolerance mechanisms in autoreactive CD8 T cells1. How autoimmune T cell populations arise and are sustained, and the molecular programmes defining the autoimmune T cell state, are unknown. In type 1 diabetes, β-cell-specific CD8 T cells destroy insulin-producing β-cells. Here we followed the fate of β-cell-specific CD8 T cells in non-obese diabetic mice throughout the course of type 1 diabetes. We identified a stem-like autoimmune progenitor population in the pancreatic draining lymph node (pLN), which self-renews and gives rise to pLN autoimmune mediators. pLN autoimmune mediators migrate to the pancreas, where they differentiate further and destroy β-cells. Whereas transplantation of as few as 20 ﻿autoimmune progenitors induced type 1 diabetes, as many as 100,000 pancreatic autoimmune mediators did not. Pancreatic autoimmune mediators are short-lived, and stem-like ﻿autoimmune progenitors must continuously seed the pancreas to sustain β-cell destruction. Single-cell RNA sequencing and clonal analysis revealed that autoimmune CD8 T cells represent unique T cell differentiation states and identified features driving the transition from autoimmune progenitor to autoimmune mediator. Strategies aimed at targeting the stem-like autoimmune progenitor pool could emerge as novel and powerful immunotherapeutic interventions for type 1 diabetes. A population of β-cell-specific autoimmune stem-like CD8 T cells initiates and sustains β-cell destruction and disease in a mouse model of type 1 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3217658296,"Observing social/physical distancing norms between humans has become an indispensable precaution to slow down the transmission of COVID-19. We present a novel method to automatically detect pairs of humans in a crowded scenario who are not maintaining social distancing, i.e. about 2 meters of space between them using an autonomous mobile robot and existing CCTV (Closed-Circuit TeleVision) cameras. The robot is equipped with commodity sensors, namely an RGB-D (Red Green Blue-Depth) camera and a 2-D lidar to detect social distancing breaches within their sensing range and navigate towards the location of the breach. Moreover, it discreetly alerts the relevant people to move apart by using a mounted display. In addition, we also equip the robot with a thermal camera that transmits thermal images to security/healthcare personnel who monitors COVID symptoms such as a fever. In indoor scenarios, we integrate the mobile robot setup with a static wall-mounted CCTV camera to further improve the number of social distancing breaches detected, accurately pursuing walking groups of people etc. We highlight the performance benefits of our robot + CCTV approach in different static and dynamic indoor scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W3216931901,"Human organoids allow the study of proliferation, lineage specification, and 3D tissue development. Here we present a genome-wide CRISPR screen in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived kidney organoids. The combination of inducible genome editing, longitudinal sampling, and endpoint sorting of tubular and stromal cells generated a complex, high-quality dataset uncovering a broad spectrum of insightful biology from early development to ""adult"" epithelial morphogenesis. Our functional dataset allows improving mesoderm induction by ROCK inhibition, contains monogenetic and complex trait kidney disease genes, confirms two additional congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) genes (CCDC170 and MYH7B), and provides a large candidate list of ciliopathy-related genes. Finally, identification of a cis-inhibitory effect of Jagged1 controlling epithelial proliferation shows how mosaic knockouts in pooled CRISPR screening can reveal ways of communication between heterogeneous cell populations in complex tissues. These data serve as a rich resource for the kidney research community and as a benchmark for future iPSC-derived organoid CRISPR screens."
https://openalex.org/W3216156708,"Researcher teams around the globe including the ""Project Lightspeed"" are intensively working on vaccines to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the availability of effective vaccines does not guarantee the vaccination willingness among the population. In spring 2021, we investigated the vaccination willingness and its potential predictors in representative online samples in nine countries (China, France, Germany, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, U.K., U.S.). Of the 9,264 participants, 79.9% revealed Covid-19 vaccination willingness. The highest willingness was in the U.K., followed by Spain and China, the lowest in Russia. In most countries, the perception of governmental Covid-19 measures as useful and the use of television reports as Covid-19 information source positively predicted the willingness. Further factors such as demographic variables, mental and physical health status, evaluation of governmental communication, social media use, and general adherence to Covid-19 measures showed a country-specific predictive pattern. Recommendations how to increase the vaccination willingness are provided."
https://openalex.org/W3215986958,"The COVID Stress Scales (CSS) were developed to measure stress in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. To further investigate the psychometric properties of the CSS, we used data collected in Poland across two waves of assessment (N = 556 at T1 and N = 264 at T2) to evaluate the factor structure, reliability (at the item and scale level), measurement invariance (across the Polish and Dutch translations of the CSS, and time), over time stability, and external associations of the Polish-language version of the CSS (CSS-PL). Overall, results suggest that the CSS-PL is psychometrically robust, largely invariant across the countries and time-lags considered. The CSS-PL was also positively related to other measures of COVID-19 fear, health anxiety, obsessive compulsive symptoms, anxiety, depression, and intent to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. This study thus provides considerable information about the CSS's items and scales, and lays the foundation for future investigations into COVID stress across time and different populations."
https://openalex.org/W3217341447,"Neutrophil trafficking is a key component of the inflammatory response. Here, we have investigated the role of the immunomodulatory lectin Galectin-9 (Gal-9) on neutrophil recruitment. Our data indicate that Gal-9 is upregulated in the inflamed vasculature of RA synovial biopsies and report the release of Gal-9 into the extracellular environment following endothelial cell activation. siRNA knockdown of endothelial Gal-9 resulted in reduced neutrophil adhesion and neutrophil recruitment was significantly reduced in Gal-9 knockout mice in a model of zymosan-induced peritonitis. We also provide evidence for Gal-9 binding sites on human neutrophils; Gal-9 binding induced neutrophil activation (increased expression of β2 integrins and reduced expression of CD62L). Intra-vital microscopy confirmed a pro-recruitment role for Gal-9, with increased numbers of transmigrated neutrophils following Gal-9 administration. We studied the role of both soluble and immobilized Gal-9 on human neutrophil recruitment. Soluble Gal-9 significantly strengthened the interaction between neutrophils and the endothelium and inhibited neutrophil crawling on ICAM-1. When immobilized, Gal-9 functioned as an adhesion molecule and captured neutrophils from the flow. Neutrophils adherent to Gal-9 exhibited a spread/activated phenotype that was inhibited by CD18 and CD44 neutralizing antibodies, suggesting a role for these molecules in the pro-adhesive effects of Gal-9. Our data indicate that Gal-9 is expressed and released by the activated endothelium and functions both in soluble form and when immobilized as a neutrophil adhesion molecule. This study paves the way for further investigation of the role of Gal-9 in leukocyte recruitment in different inflammatory settings."
https://openalex.org/W3216529497,"We aimed to determine factors independently associated with early COVID-19 vaccination and adherence to two-dose regimens.Among persons receiving care in the Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system (n = 5,766,638), we identified those who received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccination through the VA, during the first ~3months following emergency use authorization, from December 11, 2020 to March 9, 2021 (n = 1,569,099, or 27.2%, including 880,200 (56.1%) Moderna, 676,279 (43.1%) Pfizer-BioNTech and 12,620 (0.8%) Janssen vaccines).Follow-up for receipt of vaccination began on December 11, 2020. After adjustment for baseline characteristics ascertained as of December 11, 2020, factors significantly associated with vaccination included older age, higher comorbidity burden, higher body mass index category, Black (vs. White) race (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 1.19, 95% CI 1.19-1.20), Hispanic (vs. non-Hispanic) ethnicity (AHR 1.12, 95% CI 1.11-1.13), urban (vs. rural) residence (AHR 1.31, 95% CI 1.31-1.31), and geographical region, while AI/AN race (vs. White), was associated with lower vaccination rate (AHR 0.85, 95% CI 0.84-0.87). Among persons who received both doses of Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, 95.3% received the second dose within ±4 days of the recommended date. Among persons who received the first vaccine dose, only 3.2% did not receive the second dose within 42 days for Pfizer versus 4.0% for Moderna (p<0.001). Factors independently associated with higher likelihood of missing the second dose included younger age (10.83% in 18-50 yo vs. 2.72% in 70-75 yo), AI/AN race, female sex, rural location, geographical region and prior positive test for SARS-CoV-2.We identified sociodemographic and clinical factors that may be used to target vaccination efforts and to further improve adherence to second vaccine dosing."
https://openalex.org/W3216543317,"As scientific research becomes increasingly cross-disciplinary, many universities seek to support collaborative activity through new buildings and institutions. This study examines the impacts of spatial proximity on collaboration at MIT from 2005 to 2015. By exploiting a shift in the location of researchers due to building renovations, we evaluate how discrete changes in physical proximity affect the likelihood that researchers co-author. The findings suggest that moving researchers into the same building increases their propensity to collaborate, with the effect plateauing five years after the move. The effects are large when compared to the average rate of collaboration among pairs of researchers, which suggests that spatial proximity is an important tool to support cross-disciplinary collaborative science. Furthermore, buildings that host researchers working in the same or related fields and from multiple departments have a larger effect on their propensity to collaborate."
https://openalex.org/W4225930693,"Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (Tim-3) are important immune checkpoint receptors that prevent an overreacted maternal immune response to fetal antigens during pregnancy. Disruption of complex immune regulation mechanisms is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preeclampsia (PE). Our recent study showed that the Tim-3 pathway was involved in the regulation of decidual macrophage polarization. Decidual macrophages polarized to the M1 phenotype may impair uterine vessel remodeling during placentation, accounting for the occurrence of PE. Co-blockade of the PD-1/Tim-3 pathway was shown to successfully control tumor growth in preclinical cancer models. However, the effects of activating both PD-1 and Tim-3 pathways as a combined intervention strategy in PE are never reported. Herein, we observed the skew of decidual macrophage polarization toward the M1 phenotype in patients with PE and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced PE-like rat model. Moreover, we found that the activation of PD-1/Tim-3 pathway by using PD-L1 and Gal-9 fusion proteins could alleviate the manifestation of the LPS-induced PE-like rats and protect their offspring. Compared with the single intervention, the combination of PD-L1and Gal-9 fusion proteins exhibited obvious advantages in the relief of PE-like symptoms, trophoblast invasion, and fetal vascular development, indicating a synergistic effect of the activated PD-1/Tim-3 pathway. The in vitro study also revealed that the combined intervention using PD-L1 and Gal-9 fusion proteins inhibited the LPS-induced M1 macrophage polarization via the synergic activation of the ERK/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway. Together, our findings provide the first evidence that simultaneous activation of PD-1/Tim-3 signaling pathways may have an optimal protective effect and serve as a new potential target for PE intervention."
https://openalex.org/W3175977253,"Several racial and ethnic identities are widely understood to be under-represented within academia, however, actual quantification of this under-representation is surprisingly limited. Challenges include data availability, demographic inertia and identifying comparison points. We use de-aggregated data from the U.S. National Science Foundation to construct a null model of ethnic and racial representation in one of the world's largest academic communities. Making comparisons between our model and actual representation in academia allows us to measure the effects of retention (while controlling for recruitment) at different academic stages. We find that, regardless of recruitment, failed retention contributes to mis-representation across academia and that the stages responsible for the largest disparities differ by race and ethnicity: for Black and Hispanic scholars this occurs at the transition from graduate student to postdoctoral researcher whereas for Native American/Alaskan Native and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander scholars this occurs at transitions to and within faculty stages. Even for Asian and Asian-Americans, often perceived as well represented, circumstances are complex and depend on choice of baseline. Our findings demonstrate that while recruitment continues to be important, retention is also a pervasive barrier to proportional representation. Therefore, strategies to reduce mis-representation in academia must address retention. Although our model does not directly suggest specific strategies, our framework could be used to project how representation in academia might change in the long-term under different scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W3215624619,"The COVID-19 pandemic has reintroduced questions regarding the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure amongst passengers on an aircraft. Quantifying risk with computational fluid dynamics models or contact tracing methods alone is challenging, as experimental results for inflight biological aerosols is lacking. Using fluorescent aerosol tracers and real time optical sensors, coupled with DNA-tagged tracers for aerosol deposition, we executed ground and inflight testing on Boeing 767 and 777 airframes. Analysis here represents tracer particles released from a simulated infected passenger, in multiple rows and seats, to determine the exposure risk via penetration into breathing zones in that row and numerous rows ahead and behind the index case. We present here conclusions from 118 releases of fluorescent tracer particles, with 40+ Instantaneous Biological Analyzer and Collector sensors placed in passenger breathing zones for real-time measurement of simulated virus particle penetration. Results from both airframes showed a minimum reduction of 99.54% of 1 μm aerosols from the index source to the breathing zone of a typical passenger seated directly next to the source. An average 99.97 to 99.98% reduction was measured for the breathing zones tested in the 767 and 777, respectively. Contamination of surfaces from aerosol sources was minimal, and DNA-tagged 3 μm tracer aerosol collection techniques agreed with fluorescent methodologies."
https://openalex.org/W3215926942,"This study investigated the association between COVID-19 infection and host metabolic signatures as prognostic markers for disease severity and mortality. We enrolled 82 patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection who were classified as mild, moderate, or severe/critical based upon their WHO clinical severity score and compared their results with 31 healthy volunteers. Data on demographics, comorbidities and clinical/laboratory characteristics were obtained from medical records. Peripheral blood samples were collected at the time of clinical evaluation or admission and tested by quantitative mass spectrometry to characterize metabolic profiles using selected metabolites. The findings in COVID-19 (+) patients reveal changes in the concentrations of glutamate, valeryl-carnitine, and the ratios of Kynurenine/Tryptophan (Kyn/Trp) to Citrulline/Ornithine (Cit/Orn). The observed changes may serve as predictors of disease severity with a (Kyn/Trp)/(Cit/Orn) Receiver Operator Curve (ROC) AUC = 0.95. Additional metabolite measures further characterized those likely to develop severe complications of their disease, suggesting that underlying immune signatures (Kyn/Trp), glutaminolysis (Glutamate), urea cycle abnormalities (Cit/Orn) and alterations in organic acid metabolism (C5) can be applied to identify individuals at the highest risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 infection. We conclude that host metabolic factors, measured by plasma based biochemical signatures, could prove to be important determinants of Covid-19 severity with implications for prognosis, risk stratification and clinical management."
https://openalex.org/W3216232410,"This was a prospective study to evaluate the feasibility of the photic phenomena test (PPT) for quantifying glare, halo, and starburst. We compared two presbyopia-correcting intraocular lenses (IOLs), the Symfony IOL and the PanOptix IOL, as well as the monofocal Clareon IOL in 111 IOL-implanted eyes of 111 patients who underwent the PPT 1 month postoperatively. The reproducibility of photic phenomena with the PPT was assessed in 39 multifocal IOL-implanted eyes of 20 patients and among the examiners. Patients with ocular diseases, except for refractive errors, were excluded. The mean values of the groups were evaluated. Bland-Altman plots were used to analyze statistical data (Easy R version 1.37; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The PPT reproducibility assessment revealed no fixed bias or regressive significance. Reproducibility was confirmed. The glare size did not differ significantly between the Symfony, PanOptix, and Clareon groups. The halo size was significantly larger in the Symfony group (p < 0.01) than in the PanOptix group. The halo intensity was significantly brighter in the PanOptix group (p < 0.01) than in the Symfony group. In contrast, no halos were perceived in the Clareon group. The starburst size or intensity did not differ significantly between the Symfony, PanOptix, and Clareon groups. We identified the photic phenomenon related to various IOLs."
https://openalex.org/W3215909278,"The heterogeneous presentation of inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive core symptoms in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) warrants further investigation into brain network connectivity as a basis for subtype divisions in this prevalent disorder. With diffusion and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from the Healthy Brain Network database, we analyzed both structural and functional network efficiency and structure-functional network (SC-FC) coupling at the default mode (DMN), executive control (ECN), and salience (SAN) intrinsic networks in 201 children diagnosed with the inattentive subtype (ADHD-I), the combined subtype (ADHD-C), and typically developing children (TDC) to characterize ADHD symptoms relative to TDC and to test differences between ADHD subtypes. Relative to TDC, children with ADHD had lower structural connectivity and network efficiency in the DMN, without significant group differences in functional networks. Children with ADHD-C had higher SC-FC coupling, a finding consistent with diminished cognitive flexibility, for all subnetworks compared to TDC. The ADHD-C group also demonstrated increased SC-FC coupling in the DMN compared to the ADHD-I group. The correlation between SC-FC coupling and hyperactivity scores was negative in the ADHD-I, but not in the ADHD-C group. The current study suggests that ADHD-C and ADHD-I may differ with respect to their underlying neuronal connectivity and that the added dimensionality of hyperactivity may not explain this distinction."
https://openalex.org/W3217007783,"The present study, conducted immediately after the 2020 presidential election in the United States, examined whether Democrats' and Republicans' polarized assessments of election legitimacy increased over time. In a naturalistic survey experiment, people (N = 1,236) were randomly surveyed either during the week following Election Day, with votes cast but the outcome unknown, or during the following week, after President Joseph Biden was widely declared the winner. The design unconfounded the election outcome announcement from the vote itself, allowing more precise testing of predictions derived from cognitive dissonance theory. As predicted, perceived election legitimacy increased among Democrats, from the first to the second week following Election Day, as their expected Biden win was confirmed, whereas perceived election legitimacy decreased among Republicans as their expected President Trump win was disconfirmed. From the first to the second week following Election Day, Republicans reported stronger negative emotions and weaker positive emotions while Democrats reported stronger positive emotions and weaker negative emotions. The polarized perceptions of election legitimacy were correlated with the tendencies to trust and consume polarized media. Consumption of Fox News was associated with lowered perceptions of election legitimacy over time whereas consumption of other outlets was associated with higher perceptions of election legitimacy over time. Discussion centers on the role of the media in the experience of cognitive dissonance and the implications of polarized perceptions of election legitimacy for psychology, political science, and the future of democratic society."
https://openalex.org/W3217802678,"Cassava breeding is hampered by high flower abortion rates that prevent efficient recombination among promising clones. To better understand the factors causing flower abortion and propose strategies to overcome them, we 1) analyzed the reproductive barriers to intraspecific crossing, 2) evaluated pollen-pistil interactions to maximize hand pollination efficiency, and 3) identified the population structure of elite parental clones. From 2016 to 2018, the abortion and fertilization rates of 5,748 hand crossings involving 91 parents and 157 progenies were estimated. We used 16,300 single nucleotide polymorphism markers to study the parents' population structure via discriminant analysis of principal components, and three clusters were identified. To test for male and female effects, we used a mixed model in which the environment (month and year) was fixed, while female and male (nested to female) were random effects. Regardless of the population structure, significant parental effects were identified for abortion and fertilization rates, suggesting the existence of reproductive barriers among certain cassava clones. Matching ability between cassava parents was significant for pollen grains that adhered to the stigma surface, germinated pollen grains, and the number of fertilized ovules. Non-additive genetic effects were important to the inheritance of these traits. Pollen viability and pollen-pistil interactions in cross- and self-pollination were also investigated to characterize pollen-stigma compatibility. Various events related to pollen tube growth dynamics indicated fertilization abnormalities. These abnormalities included the reticulated deposition of callose in the pollen tube, pollen tube growth cessation in a specific region of the stylet, and low pollen grain germination rate. Generally, pollen viability and stigma receptivity varied depending on the clone and flowering stage and were lost during flowering. This study provides novel insights into cassava reproduction that can assist in practical crossing and maximize the recombination of contrasting clones."
https://openalex.org/W3215088990,"Motivated by the two-decade-long scientific debate over the existence of the ego-depletion effect, our paper contributes to exploring the scope conditions of ego-depletion theory. Specifically, in a randomized experiment, we depleted students' self-control with a cognitively demanding task that required students' effort. We measured the effect of depleted self-control on a subsequent task that required self-control to not engage in fraudulent cheating behavior-measured with an incentivized dice-roll task-and tested ego-depletion in a large-scale preregistered field experiment that was similar to real-life situations. We hypothesized that treated students would cheat more. The data confirms the hypothesis and provides causal evidence of the ego-depletion effect. Our results provide new insights into the scope conditions of ego-depletion theory, contribute methodological information for future research, and offer practical guidance for educational policy."

https://openalex.org/W3216486341,"The venomic profile of Asian mountain pit viper Ovophis monticola is clarified in the present study. Using mass spectrometry-based proteomics, 247 different proteins were identified in crude venom of O. monticola found in Thailand. The most abundant proteins were snake venom metalloproteases (SVMP) (36.8%), snake venom serine proteases (SVSP) (31.1%), and phospholipases A2 (PLA2) (12.1%). Less abundant proteins included L-amino acid oxidase (LAAO) (5.7%), venom nerve growth factor (3.6%), nucleic acid degrading enzymes (3.2%), C-type lectins (CTL) (1.6%), cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISP) (1.2%) and disintegrin (1.2%). The immunoreactivity of this viper's venom to a monovalent antivenom against green pit viper Trimeresurus albolabris, or to a polyvalent antivenom against hemotoxic venom was investigated by indirect ELISA and two-dimensional (2D) immunoblotting. Polyvalent antivenom showed substantially greater reactivity levels than monovalent antivenom. A titer for the monovalent antivenom was over 1:1.28x107 dilution while that of polyvalent antivenom was 1:5.12x107. Of a total of 89 spots comprising 173 proteins, 40 spots of predominantly SVMP, SVSP and PLA2 were specific antigens for antivenoms. The 49 unrecognized spots containing 72 proteins were characterized as non-reactive proteins, and included certain types of CTLs and CRISPs. These neglected venom constituents could limit the effectiveness of antivenom-based therapy currently available for victims of pit viper envenomation."
https://openalex.org/W3216927091,"A large variety of misconceptions about learning, teaching, and other educational topics is prevalent in the public but also among educational professionals. Such misconceptions may lead to ill-advised judgments and actions in private life, professional practice, and policymaking. Developing effective correction strategies for these misconceptions hinges on a better understanding of the factors that make individuals susceptible to or resilient against misconceptions. The present study surveyed students from educational and non-educational fields of study to investigate whether the endorsement of four typical educational misconceptions can be predicted by study-related variables (i.e., field of study and study progress) and by students’ cognitive ability (i.e., numeracy), epistemic orientations, general world views (i.e., conservative orientation), and education-related values (i.e., educational goals). A sample of N = 315 undergraduates in teacher education and education- and non-education-related fields of study completed an online survey. Results from structural equation models showed that the pattern of effects strongly varied across the specific misconceptions. The two misconceptions related to teaching factors (i.e., class size and effectiveness of direct instruction as a teaching method) were the most strongly affected by the field of study and had an association with conservative orientation. In contrast, the misconception about the effectiveness of grade retention as an educational intervention was more prevalent among the students emphasizing conventional educational goals, such as discipline. None of the investigated explanatory variables proved predictive of the misconception about the “feminization” of education as an educational-equity topic. Moreover, neither numeracy nor epistemic orientation was found to have any effect on the endorsement of educational misconceptions. These findings emphasize the topic dependency of the factors that make individuals susceptible to misconceptions. Future research and intervention approaches need to consider the topic specificity of educational misconceptions."
https://openalex.org/W3217494929,"This study investigates international students’ acculturation attitude preference and the influence factors (i.e., gender, duration in China, host and English proficiency, adult attachment style and social ties) on each acculturation attitude (i.e, integration, assimilation, separation and marginalization attitude) in China. A group of 229 international students within China responded online. Results from cluster analysis based on process model of acculturation revealed that, integration was the most prevalent acculturation attitude of international students in China. Additionally, logistic regressions analysis indicated that duration in China was negatively associated with adoption of separation and marginalization attitude also higher level of English proficiency predicted the preference of marginalization attitude. However, Chinese proficiency was positively associated with integration attitude adoption, host ties were positively and significantly associated with adoption of assimilation and integration attitude, but negatively associated with the usage of marginalization attitude. Lastly, avoidance attachment was found negatively associating with the integration attitude. This study provides valuable insights for international student education policymakers to assist international students in order to adapt to a new environment quickly and effectively."
https://openalex.org/W3217548811,"The actin cytoskeleton is indispensable for the motility and migration of all types of cells; therefore, it plays a crucial role in the ability of the tissues to repair. Mesenchymal stem cells are intensively used in regenerative medicine, but usually relatively low percent of transplanted cells reaches the injury. To overcome this evident limitation, researchers try to enhance the motility and migration rate of the cells. As one of the approaches, co-cultivation and preconditioning of stem cells with biologically active compounds, which can cause actin cytoskeleton rearrangements followed by an increase of migratory properties of the cells, could be applied. The observed changes in F-actin structure induced by the compounds require quantitative estimation, and measurement of fluorescence intensity of the F-actin image captured by various microscopic techniques is commonly used nowadays. However, this approach could not always accurately detect the observed changes in the shape and structure of actin cytoskeleton. At this time, the image of F-actin has an irregular geometric pattern, and thus could be considered and characterized as a fractal object. To quantify the re-organization of cellular F-actin in terms of fractal geometry Minkovsky's box-counting method is suitable, but it is not widely used nowadays. We modified and improved the previously described method for fractal dimension measurement, and successfully applied it for the quantification of the F-actin structures of human mesenchymal stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W3214812192,"In the game of softball, the batter should possess the necessary skills to hit the ball toward various directions with high initial speed. However, because various factors influence each other, there are limitations to the range that can be controlled by the batter's skill. This study was aimed at extracting the impact characteristics associated with the launch speed/direction and batted ball spin and clarifying the important skills required to improve the batter's hitting performance. In our experiments, 20 female softball players, who are members of the Japan women's national softball team, hit balls launched from a pitching machine. The movements of the ball and bat before, during, or after the impact were recorded using a motion capture system. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed to extract factors relating the side spin rate. The undercut angle (elevation angle between the bat's trajectory and the common normal between the ball and bat: ΔR2 = 0.560) and the horizontal bat angle (azimuth of bat's long axis at ball impact: ΔR2 = 0.299) were strongly associated with the side spin rate (total R2 = 0.893, p < 0.001). The undercut angle in opposite-field hitting was significantly larger than that in pull-side hitting (p < 0.001). The side spin rate was associated with the undercut angle because the bat's distal (barrel) side inclined downward (-29.6 ± 8.7°) at impact. The ball exit velocity was higher when it was hit at a smaller undercut angle (R2 = 0.523, p < 0.001). Therefore, it is deemed desirable to focus on maximizing the ball exit velocity rather than ball spin because the ball-bat impact characteristics vary inevitably depending on the launch direction. Meanwhile, the use of the ball delivery machine and the slower pitched ball are the limiting factors in the generalization of the findings."

Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the disease-free survival and overall survival (OS).Overall, 11 patients with NSR-SCCUB were identified between 2002 and 2017 with adequate tissue samples. Median age was 71 years (45-86), predominantly male (63.6%). At time of diagnosis, 9 patients (81.8%) had muscle-invasive disease, 1 (9.1%) had non-muscle invasive, and 1 (9.1%) had advanced disease. Nine (81.8%) patients had radical cystectomy and pelvic lymph nodes dissection. Eight (72.7%) patients had pT3 or pT4 with N0, and 5 (45.5%) were grade 3. Median OS was 12.5 months (95% CI 7.7-17.2 months). Single nucleotide variants or insertion/deletions were identified in TP53, TERT, PIK3CA, PTEN, CREBBP, FBXW7, and FGFR3. Amplifications were found in CCND1, and EGFR.NSR-SCCUB has potentially actionable genomic alterations with anticancer agents and many of these aberrations are also seen in UC. The recruitment of NSR-SCCUB patients harboring such mutations should be considered in biomarker driven urinary bladder cancer studies."
https://openalex.org/W3215648181,"Collective cell migration is essential for embryonic development and homeostatic processes. During zebrafish development, the posterior lateral line primordium (pLLP) navigates along the embryo flank by collective cell migration. The chemokine receptors, Cxcr4b and Cxcr7b, as well as their cognate ligand, Cxcl12a, are essential for this process. We corroborate that knockdown of the zebrafish cd9 tetraspanin orthologue, cd9b , results in mild pLL abnormalities. Through generation of CRISPR and TALEN mutants, we show that cd9a and cd9b function partially redundantly in pLLP migration, which is delayed in the cd9b single and cd9a; cd9b double mutants. This delay led to a transient reduction in neuromast numbers. Loss of both Cd9a and Cd9b sensitized embryos to reduced Cxcr4b and Cxcl12a levels. Together these results provide evidence that Cd9 modulates collective cell migration of the pLLP during zebrafish development. One interpretation of these observations is that Cd9 contributes to more effective chemokine signalling."
https://openalex.org/W3216701053,"Given widespread vulnerability to COVID-19 infection in areas with low vaccination rates, facemask wearing is repeatedly emphasized for the general population including bank workers, who have contact with many customers each day. Over the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, studies focused on facemask wearing among healthcare workers but not among bank workers, who are also at risk of COVID-19. To address this gap and to consider intervention measures that encourage the wearing of facemasks, this study was conducted to identify behaviors of facemask wearing and associated factors among bank workers in Dessie City, Ethiopia.An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 413 bank workers who were selected using a simple random sampling technique from January 1st to 30th, 2021 in Dessie City, Ethiopia. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire and on-the-spot observational checklist. The collected data were checked, coded and entered to EpiData version 4.6 and exported to Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25.0 for data cleaning and analysis. Data were analyzed using bivariable (crude odds ratio [COR]) and multivariable (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]) logistic regression model at 95% confidence interval (CI). Variables from the bivariable analysis with a p-value <0.25 were considered for multivariable analysis. Then, variables that had a p-value <0.05 were declared as factors significantly associated with behavior of facemask wearing.In this study, the behavior of facemask wearing among bank workers was 50.4% [95%CI: 45.3-55.2%] with 21.1% always wearing a facemask, 72.4% sometimes, and 6.5% never. A majority of the bank workers 350 (84.7%) had good knowledge of COVID-19 and half of them 208 (50.4%) had a positive attitude towards taking precautions against COVID-19. Just over two-thirds of the respondents 284 (68.8%) preferred to wear a non-medical mask. Two hundred fifty-five (61.7%) said wearing a facemask interfered with communication and 259 (62.7%) felt that wearing a facemask was not comfortable. Facemask-wearing behavior was significantly associated with a high level of positive attitude towards taking precautions against COVID-19 (AOR = 3.27, 95% CI: 1.75-6.11), the perception that the consequences of getting COVID-19 could be serious (AOR = 4.87, 95% CI: 2.38-9.94), the presence of chronic illness (AOR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.07-4.48), sex being female (AOR = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.06-3.32) and age being greater or equal to 35 years (AOR = 9.25, 95% CI: 4.79-17.88).The main finding of the study showed that the behavior of facemask wearing among bank workers was relatively low (50.4%) compared to other types of workers as found in other studies. To increase the behavior of facemask wearing among bank workers, health decision makers need to develop updated guidance for promotion of facemask wearing to increase the practical and appropriate use of facemasks among bank workers. Bank managers and concerned government bodies should enforce mask use to change behavior of these workers."
https://openalex.org/W3217242538,"Humans express loyalty to consumer brands much like they do in human relationships. The neuroactive chemical oxytocin is an important biological substrate of human attachment and this study tested whether consumer-brand relationships can be influenced by oxytocin administration. We present a mathematical model of brand attachment that generates empirically-testable hypotheses. The model is tested by administering synthetic oxytocin or placebo to male and female participants (N = 77) who received information about brands and had an opportunity to purchase branded products. We focused on two brand personality dimensions: warmth and competence. Oxytocin increased perceptions of brand competence but not brand warmth relative to placebo. We also found that participants were willing to pay more for branded products through its effect on brand competence. When writing about one's favorite brands, oxytocin enhanced the use of positive emotional language as well as words related to family and friends. These findings provide preliminary evidence that consumers build relationships with brands using the biological mechanisms that evolved to form human attachments."
https://openalex.org/W3217770693,"Research with a focus on sleep posture has been conducted in association with sleep pathologies such as insomnia and positional obstructive sleep apnoea. Research examining the potential role sleep posture may have on waking spinal symptoms and quality of sleep is however limited. The aims of this research were to compare sleep posture and sleep quality in participants with and without waking spinal symptoms.Fifty-three participants (36 female) were, based on symptoms, allocated to one of three groups; Control (n = 20, 16 female), Cervical (n = 13, 10 female) and Lumbar (n = 20, 10 female). Participants completed an online survey to collect general information and patient reported outcomes and were videoed over two consecutive nights to determine sleep posture using a validated classification system including intermediate sleep postures.Participants in the symptomatic groups also reported a lower sleep quality than the Control group. Compared to Control group participants, those in the Cervical group had more frequent posture changes (mean (SD); 18.3(6.5) versus 23.6(6.6)), spent more time in undesirable/provocative sleep postures (median IQR; 83.8(16.4,105.2) versus 185.1(118.0,251.8)) minutes and had more long periods of immobility in a provocative posture, (median IQR: 0.5(0.0,1.5) versus 2.0 (1.5,4.0)). There were no significant differences between the Control and Lumbar groups in the number of posture changes (18.3(6.5) versus 22.9(9.1)) or the time spent in provocative sleep postures (0.5(0.0,1.5) versus 1.5(1.5,3.4)) minutes.This is the first study using a validated objective measure of sleep posture to compare symptomatic and Control group participants sleeping in their home environment. In general, participants with waking spinal symptoms spent more time in provocative sleep postures, and experienced poorer sleep quality."
https://openalex.org/W3215278354,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) caused by various mechanisms, including antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cisplatin, and radiocontrast. Tunicamycin (TM) is a nucleoside antibiotic that induces ER stress and is a commonly used model of AKI. 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) is a chemical chaperone and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor and has been shown to protect the kidney from ER stress, apoptosis, and structural damage in a tunicamycin model of AKI. The renal protection provided by 4-PBA is attributed to its ability to prevent misfolded protein aggregation and inhibit ER stress; however, the HDAC inhibitor effects of 4-PBA have not been examined in the TM-induced model of AKI. As such, the main objective of this study was to determine if histone hyperacetylation provides any protective effects against TM-mediated AKI. The FDA-approved HDAC inhibitor vorinostat was used, as it has no ER stress inhibitory effects and therefore the histone hyperacetylation properties alone could be investigated. In vitro work demonstrated that vorinostat inhibited histone deacetylation in cultured proximal tubular cells but did not prevent ER stress or protein aggregation induced by TM. Vorinostat induced a significant increase in cell death, and exacerbated TM-mediated total cell death and apoptotic cell death. Wild type male mice were treated with TM (0.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection), with or without vorinostat (50 mg/kg/day) or 4-PBA (1 g/kg/day). Mice treated with 4-PBA or vorinostat exhibited similar levels of histone hyperacetylation. Expression of the pro-apoptotic protein CHOP was induced with TM, and not inhibited by vorinostat. Further, vorinostat did not prevent any renal damage or decline in renal function caused by tunicamycin. These data suggest that the protective mechanisms found by 4-PBA are primarily due to its molecular chaperone properties, and the HDAC inhibitors used did not provide any protection against renal injury caused by ER stress."
https://openalex.org/W3215724978,"The effectiveness of health education on adolescents has been questioned, along with a growing body of empirical studies documenting the absence of behavioral changes after the intervention. However, evidence on its impact on other crucial health domains, besides health practices, is lacking. We evaluated the causal effects of a school-based health education program on adolescents' multidimensional psychological health factors.A cluster-randomized controlled trial.We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial involving 140 lower secondary schools in Vietnam. After stratifying by district, schools were randomized 1:1 to either treatment or control groups. Students enrolled in the treatment schools received monthly stand-alone health education in five topics by school teachers at the class level, but control group students did not receive any intervention. The primary outcomes of the study were students' non-cognitive skills, life satisfaction, aspirations gap, and the Health-Related Quality of Life at five-month follow-up. We estimated the intention-to-treat effects with the panel fixed effects model using student panel data.Of the 6,477 students enrolled at baseline, 2,958 (92%) treated and 2,967 (91%) control students completed the follow-up survey five months after baseline data collection from October to December 2018. Compared with controls, health education led to improved treatment school students' self-efficacy (p-value = 0.013), presumed life satisfaction five years from the present (p-value = 0.001), aspirations gap for a socially and mentally healthy future (p-value = 0.036), and the Health-Related Quality of Life (p-value = 0.036).A school-based health education program enhanced students' non-cognitive skills, life satisfaction and aspirations gap, and the Health-Related Quality of Life significantly. This study proposes essential psychological factors that should be taken into account when evaluating the effectiveness of a health education program in resource-limited settings."
https://openalex.org/W3216127615,"To prospectively evaluate nocturnal sleep problems and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, and analyze the influence of motor symptoms, treatment, and sex differences on sleep problems in PD.Sleep disturbances of 103 PD patients were assessed with Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Student's t-test for related samples, one-way ANOVA with Tukey's HSD post hoc test were used to assess group differences. Bivariate correlations and mixed-effects linear regression models were used to analyze the association between clinical aspects and sleep disturbances over time.At baseline, 48.5% of PD patients presented nocturnal problems and 40% of patients presented EDS. The PDSS and ESS total score slightly improve over time. Nocturnal problems were associated with age and motor impartment, explaining the 51% of the variance of the PDSS model. Males presented less nocturnal disturbances and more EDS than females. Higher motor impairment and combined treatment (L-dopa and agonist) were related to more EDS, while disease duration and L-dopa in monotherapy were related to lower scores, explaining the 59% of the model.Sleep disturbances changed over time and age, diseases duration, motor impairment, treatment and sex were associated with nocturnal sleep problems and EDS. Agonist treatment alone or in combination with L-dopa might predict worse daytime sleepiness, while L-dopa in monotherapy is related to lower EDS, which significantly affects the quality of life of PD patients."
https://openalex.org/W3216518344,"The Kuroshio Current can take two paths; usually it follows the regular pattern but occasionally it follows a pattern known as the large meander. In this study, we investigated the abundance of fish that migrate to coastal waters and the spatial distribution of fish schools under both Kuroshio patterns in Suzu district, Kochi prefecture, where the set net is the main fishery industry. We clarified the seasonal variation in the density and distribution of fish schools using a quantitative echo sounder. The effects of the Kuroshio large meander (LM) depended on the season. There was no effect of current pattern in summer or autumn, but in winter and spring the LM altered the marine environment and fish distributions. Cold water masses were formed in the survey area during winter and spring during the LM, and the water temperature dropped significantly compared with during the Kuroshio non-large meander (NLM). This altered the fish species and the distribution of fish schools in the survey area. The catches of Japanese horse mackerels (Trachurus japonicus) and Yellowtails (Seriola quinqueradiata) were much higher during the LM compared with those during the NLM. Unlike these two species, the small-sized pelagic fishes in spring has decreased significantly during the LM."
https://openalex.org/W3216698873,"Phytoplankton play a central role in our ecosystems, they are responsible for nearly 50 percent of the global primary productivity and major drivers of macro-elemental cycles in the ocean. Phytoplankton are constantly subjected to stressors, some natural such as nutrient limitation and some manmade such as oil spills. With increasing oil exploration activities in coastal zones in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere, an oil spill during nutrient-limited conditions for phytoplankton growth is highly likely. We performed a multifactorial study exposing the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum (UTEX 646) to oil and/or dispersants under nitrogen and silica limitation as well as co-limitation of both nutrients. Our study found that treatments with nitrogen limitation (-N and-N-Si) showed overall lower growth and chlorophyll a, lower photosynthetic antennae size, lower maximum photosynthetic efficiency, lower protein in exopolymeric substance (EPS), but higher connectivity between photosystems compared to non-nitrogen limited treatments (-Si and +N+Si) in almost all the conditions with oil and/or dispersants. However, certain combinations of nutrient limitation and oil and/or dispersant differed from this trend indicating strong interactive effects. When analyzed for significant interactive effects, the-N treatment impact on cellular growth in oil and oil plus dispersant conditions; and oil and oil plus dispersant conditions on cellular growth in-N-Si and-N treatments were found to be significant. Overall, we demonstrate that nitrogen limitation can affect the oil resistant trait of P. tricornutum, and oil with and without dispersants can have interactive effects with nutrient limitation on this diatom."

In this study, preliminary analysis by high-throughput sequencing of short RNAs of kernels from the crosses between almond cultivars 'Sefid' × 'Mamaee' (with small and large kernels, respectively) and 'Sefid' × 'P. orientalis' (with small kernels) showed that the expressions of several miRNAs such as Pdu-miR395a-3p, Pdu-miR8123-5p, Pdu-miR482f, Pdu-miR6285, and Pdu-miR396a were significantly different. These miRNAs targeted genes encoding different proteins such as NYFB-3, SPX1, PGSIP3 (GUX2), GH3.9, and BEN1. The result of RT-qPCR revealed that the expression of these genes showed significant differences between the crosses and developmental stages of the seeds, suggesting that these genes might be involved in controlling kernel size because the presence of these miRNAs had a negative effect on their target genes. Pollen source can influence kernel size by affecting hormonal signaling and metabolic pathways through related miRNAs, a phenomenon known as xenia."

Integration of the Philips DXL-16 algorithm into the electrocardiogram (ECG) extensively analyses the electricity of the heart. Machine learning techniques such as the C5.0 could lead to a new decision tree criterion to detect Echo-LVH.To search for a new combination of ECG parameters predictive of Echo-LVH. The final model is called the Cardiac Hypertrophy Computer-based model (CHCM).We extracted the 458 ECG parameters provided by the Philips DXL-16 algorithm in patients with Echo-LVH and controls. We used the C5.0 ML algorithm to train, test, and validate the CHCM. We compared its diagnostic performance to validate state-of-the-art criteria in our patient cohort.We included 439 patients and considered an alpha value of 0.05 and a power of 99%. The CHCM includes T voltage in I (≤0.055 mV), peak-to-peak QRS distance in aVL (>1.235 mV), and peak-to-peak QRS distance in aVF (>0.178 mV). The CHCM had an accuracy of 70.5% (CI95%, 65.2-75.5), a sensitivity of 74.3%, and a specificity of 68.7%. In the external validation cohort (n = 156), the CHCM had an accuracy of 63.5% (CI95%, 55.4-71), a sensitivity of 42%, and a specificity of 82.9%. The accuracies of the most relevant state-of-the-art criteria were: Romhilt-Estes (57.4%, CI95% 49-65.5), VDP Cornell (55.7%, CI95%47.6-63.7), Cornell (59%, CI95%50.8-66.8), Dalfó (62.9%, CI95%54.7-70.6), Sokolow Lyon (53.9%, CI95%45.7-61.9), and Philips DXL-16 algorithm (54.5%, CI95%46.3-62.5).ECG computer-based data and the C5.0 determined a new set of ECG parameters to predict Echo-LVH.

Here we take a low-coverage, long-read genome sequencing approach to characterisation of individual root-knot nematodes. We demonstrate library preparation for Oxford Nanopore Technologies Flongle sequencing of low input DNA from individual juveniles and immature females, multiplexing up to twelve samples per flow cell. Taxonomic identification with Kraken 2 (a k-mer -based taxonomic assignment tool) is shown to reliably identify individual nematodes to species level, even within the very closely related Meloidogyne incognita group.

https://openalex.org/W3215615278,"Does the unequal formal representation of people in legislatures (“malapportionment”) affect development? Answering this question is critical for assessing the welfare costs of malapportionment. We argue that representation might spur development as the desire for reelection incentivizes legislators to provide for their districts, and as voters hold politicians to account for doing so. Since this is the case, malapportionment might cause unequal development. Using data from India, we show that a 10% increase in representation causes a 0.6% increase in night lights, a frequently used proxy for development. Reapportionment, or the equalization for representation, attenuates this effect. Consistent with the theory, the effect of representation is larger in districts with legislators and voters that are able to hold the executive to account."

Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyse the influence of survey mode and patient characteristics on patient experience with patient safety.The overall response rate was 71.1%. Most patients completed the questionnaire on site (76.6%) and on paper (96.1%). Between 30.1% to 68.5% of the respondents report the most positive option for patient experience with the main domains of patient safety. A total of 2.9% of patients reported having experienced a patient-safety event (PSE) during the last 12 months. Patients who filled in the questionnaire off site were more likely to report negative experiences for the scales communication & information (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.5), rapport & participation (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.7) and access (OR 1.3, 95% CI 0.9-1.4) than those who completed it on site. Those who chose a paper questionnaire were more likely to report negative experiences for all five scales compared to web responders.Routine measurement of patient experience with factors contributing to the occurrence of PSEs can achieve high response rates by offering flexible participation options. Results gained from mixed-mode surveys need to take mode-effects into account when interpreting and using the results. Further research is needed in how to adequately assess number and type of experienced events in routine measurements."

https://openalex.org/W3217061772,"The recent uptake in popularity in vehicles with zero tailpipe emissions is a welcome development in the fight against traffic induced airborne pollutants. As vehicle fleets become electrified, and tailpipe emissions become less prevalent, non-tailpipe emissions (from tires and brake disks) will become the dominant source of traffic related emissions, and will in all likelihood become a major concern for human health. This trend is likely to be exacerbated by the heavier weight of electric vehicles, their increased power, and their increased torque capabilities, when compared with traditional vehicles. While the problem of emissions from tire wear is well-known, issues around the process of tire abrasion, its impact on the environment, and modelling and mitigation measures, remain relatively unexplored. Work on this topic has proceeded in several discrete directions including: on-vehicle collection methods; vehicle tire-wear abatement algorithms and controlling the ride characteristics of a vehicle, all with a view to abating tire emissions. Additional approaches include access control mechanisms to manage aggregate tire emissions in a geofenced area with other notable work focussing on understanding the particle size distribution of tire generated PM, the degree to which particles become airborne, and the health impacts of tire emissions. While such efforts are already underway, the problem of developing models to predict the aggregate picture of a network of vehicles at the scale of a city, has yet to be considered. Our objective in this paper is to present one such model, built using ideas from Markov chains. Applications of our modelling approach are given toward the end of this note, both to illustrate the utility of the proposed method, and to illustrate its application as part of a method to collect tire dust particles."

In this study we invited public responses to five different research projects, using non-technical summaries intended for lay audiences. Our aim was to assess the potential for this type of public consultation in protocol review, and a secondary aim was to better understand what types of animal research people are willing to accept and why. US participants (n = 1521) were asked (via an online survey) ""Do you support the use of these (insert species) for this research"", and responded using a seven-point scale (1 = ""No"", 4 = ""Neutral"", and 7 = ""Yes""). Participants were asked to explain the reasons for their choice; open-ended text responses were subjected to thematic analysis. Most participants (89.7%) provided clear comments, showing the potential of an online forum to elicit feedback. Four themes were prevalent in participant reasoning regarding their support for the proposed research: 1) impact on animals, 2) impact on humans, 3) scientific merit, and 4) availability of alternatives. Participant support for the proposed research varied but on average was close to neutral (mean ± SD: 4.5 ± 2.19) suggesting some ambivalence to this animal use. The protocol describing Parkinson's research (on monkeys) was least supported (3.9 ± 2.17) and the transplant research (on pigs) was most supported (4.9 ± 2.02). These results indicate that public participants are sensitive to specifics of a protocol. We conclude that an online forum can provide meaningful public input on proposed animal research, offering research institutions the opportunity for improved transparency and the chance to reduce the risk that they engage in studies that are out of step with community values."

Meanwhile, we applied Bayesian phylogenetic methods to infer the weighted average effective reproductive number [Formula: see text] from four HIV subtypes that sampled from 912 HIV-positive patients in China. It is an original and innovative method by fitting [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text] by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to generate unknown parameters in [Formula: see text].By analyzing the HIV gene sequences, we inferred that the most recent common ancestor of CRF01AE, CRF07BC, CRF08BC, and CRFBC dated from 1994, 1990, 1993 and 1990, respectively. The weighted average effective reproductive number [Formula: see text] dropped from 1.95 in 1994 to 1.73 in 2018. Considering different interventions, we used a macro dynamic model to predict the trend of HIV resistance. The results show that the number of new infections and total drug resistance under the baseline parameter (S1) are 253,422 and 213,250 in 2025, respectively. Comparing with the numbers under the target treatment rate (S2), they were 219,717 and 236,890, respectively. However, under the ideal treatment target (S3, the treatment rate reaches 90% and the treatment success rate reaches 90%), the number of new infections shows a declining trend and will decrease to 46,559 by 2025. Compared with S1 and S2, the total number of resistance also decreased to 160,899 in 2025.With the promotion of NFATP in China, HIV resistance to ARVs is inevitable. The strategy of increasing the treatment rate would not only ineffectively curb the epidemic, but also deteriorate drug resistance issue. Whereas, a combination of intervention strategies (the treatment rate reaches 90% and the treatment success rate reaches 90%) can greatly reduce both infection and drug resistance rate than applying one strategy alone."

This study aims to investigate what kind of complexities adults undergoing genetic counseling in Switzerland experience, how they deal with them, and what heuristics they use during the decision-making process.Semi-structured qualitative interviews with eighteen Swiss adults seeking genetic counseling for hereditary cancer syndrome genetic testing and two counseling physicians were conducted and analyzed using a grounded theory approach.Counselees stated that once they were aware of their eligibility for genetic testing they perceived an inevitable necessity to make a decision in a context of uncertainties. Some counselees perceived this decision as simple, others as very complex. High emotional involvement increased perceived complexity. We observed six heuristics that counselees used to facilitate their decision: Anticipating the test result; Focusing on consequences; Dealing with information; Interpreting disease risk; Using external guidance; and (Re-)Considering the general uncertainty of life.Our findings are limited to the context of predictive genetic testing for hereditary cancer syndromes. This qualitative study does not allow extrapolation of the relative frequency of which heuristics occur.The use of heuristics is an inherent part of decision-making, particularly in the complex context of genetic testing for inherited cancer predisposition. However, some heuristics increase the risk of misinterpretation or exaggerated external influences. This may negatively impact informed decision-making. Thus, this study illustrates the importance of genetic counselors and medical professionals being aware of these heuristics and the individual manner in which they might be applied in the context of genetic testing decision-making. Findings may offer practical support to achieve this, as they inductively focus on the counselees' perspective."
https://openalex.org/W3216189811,"We use 19 billion likes on the posts of top 2000 U.S. fan pages on Facebook from 2015 to 2016 to measure the dynamic ideological positions for politicians, news outlets, and users at the national and state levels. We then use these measures to derive support rates for 2016 presidential candidates in all 50 states, to predict the election, and to compare them with state-level polls and actual vote shares. We find that: (1) Assuming that users vote for candidates closer to their own ideological positions, support rates calculated using Facebook predict that Trump will win the electoral college vote while Clinton will win the popular vote. (2) State-level Facebook support rates track state-level polling averages and pass the cointegration test, showing two time series share similar trends. (3) Compared with actual vote shares, polls generally have smaller margin of errors, but polls also often overestimate Clinton's support in right-leaning states. Overall, we provide a method to forecast elections at low cost, in real time, and based on passively revealed preference and little researcher discretion."
https://openalex.org/W3217022265,"Telemedicine can be used to conduct ophthalmological assessment of patients, facilitating patient access to specialist care. Since the teleophthalmology models require data collection support from other health professionals, the purpose of our study was to assess agreement between the nursing technician and the ophthalmologist in acquisition of health parameters that can be used for remote analysis as part of a telemedicine strategy. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 140 patients referred to an ophthalmological telediagnosis center by primary healthcare doctors. The health parameters evaluated were visual acuity (VA), objective ophthalmic measures acquired by autorefraction, keratometry, and intraocular pressure (IOP). Bland-Altman plots were used to analyze agreement between the nursing technician and the ophthalmologist. The Bland-Altman analysis showed a mean bias equal to zero for the VA measurements [95%-LoA: -0.25-0.25], 0.01 [95%-LoA: -0.86-0.88] for spherical equivalent (M), -0.08 [95%-LoA: -1.1-0.95] for keratometry (K) and -0.23 [95%-LoA: -4.4-4.00] for IOP. The measures had a high linear correlation (R [95%CI]: 0.87 [0.82-0.91]; 0.97 [0.96-0.98]; 0.96 [0.95-0.97] and 0.88 [0.84-0.91] respectively). The results observed demonstrate that remote ophthalmological data collection by adequately trained health professionals is viable. This confirms the utility and safety of these solutions for scenarios in which access to ophthalmologists is limited."
https://openalex.org/W3217804797,"Resource partitioning, and especially dietary partitioning, is a mechanism that has been studied for several canid species as a means to understand competitive relationships and the ability of these species to coexist. Coyotes ( Canis latrans ) and gray foxes ( Urocyon cinereoargenteus ) are two canid species that are widely distributed, in Mexico, and they are sympatric throughout most of their distribution range. However, trophic dynamic and overlap between them have not been thoroughly studied. In order to better understand their ecological relationship and potential competitive interactions, we studied the trophic niche overlap between both canids in a temperate forest of Durango, Mexico. The results are based on the analysis of 540 coyote and 307 gray fox feces collected in 2018. Both species consumed a similar range of food items, but the coyote consumed large species while the gray fox did not. For both species, the most frequently consumed food categories throughout the year and seasonally were fruit and wild mammals (mainly rodents and lagomorphs). Coyotes had higher trophic diversity in their annual diet ( H’ = 2.33) than gray foxes ( H’ = 1.80). When analyzing diets by season, trophic diversity of both species was higher in winter and spring and tended to decrease in summer and autumn. When comparing between species, this parameter differed significantly during all seasons except for summer. Trophic overlap throughout the year was high ( R 0 = 0.934), with seasonal variation between R 0 = 0.821 (autumn) and R 0 = 0.945 (spring). Both species based their diet on the most available food items throughout each season of the year, having high dietary overlap which likely can lead to intense exploitative competition processes. However, differences in trophic diversity caused by differential prey use can mitigate competitive interactions, allowing these different sized canid species to coexist in the study area."
https://openalex.org/W4226245857,"The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) with its ligand aldosterone (aldo) physiologically regulates electrolyte homeostasis and blood pressure but it can also lead to pathophysiological effects in the cardiovascular system. Previous results show that posttranslational modifications (PTM) can influence MR signaling and function. Based on in silico and in vitro data, casein kinase 1 (CK1) was predicted as a candidate for MR phosphorylation. To gain a deeper mechanistic insight into MR activation, we investigated the influence of CK1 on MR function in HEK cells. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that the MR is located in a protein-protein complex with CK1α and CK1ε. Reporter gene assays with pharmacological inhibitors and MR constructs demonstrated that especially CK1ε acts as a positive modulator of GRE activity via the C-terminal MR domains CDEF. CK1 enhanced the binding affinity of aldosterone to the MR, facilitated nuclear translocation and DNA interaction of the MR, and led to expression changes of pathophysiologically relevant genes like Per-1 and Phlda1. By peptide microarray and site-directed mutagenesis experiments, we identified the highly conserved T800 as a direct CK1 phosphorylation site of the MR, which modulates the nuclear import and genomic activity of the receptor. Direct phosphorylation of the MR was unable to fully account for all of the CK1 effects on MR signaling, suggesting additional phosphorylation of MR co-regulators. By LC/MS/MS, we identified the MR-associated proteins NOLC1 and TCOF1 as candidates for such CK1-regulated co-factors. Overall, we found that CK1 acts as a co-activator of MR GRE activity through direct and indirect phosphorylation, which accelerates cytosolic-nuclear trafficking, facilitates nuclear accumulation and DNA binding of the MR, and increases the expression of pathologically relevant MR-target genes."
