https://openalex.org/W1966322594,"NITRIC oxide (NO), apparently identical to endothelium-derived relaxing factor in blood vessels1–3, is also formed by cytotoxic macrophages4,5, in adrenal gland6 and in brain tissue7–9, where it mediates the stimulation by glutamate of cyclic GMP formation in the cerebellum10,11. Stimulation of intestinal12 or anococcygeal13–15 nerves liberates NO, and the resultant muscle relaxation is blocked by arginine derivatives that inhibit NO synthesis. It is, however, unclear whether in brain or intestine, NO released following nerve stimulation is formed in neurons, glia, fibroblasts, muscle or blood cells, all of which occur in proximity to neurons and so could account for effects of nerve stimulation on cGMP and muscle tone. We have now localized NO synthase protein immunohisto-chemically in the rat using antisera to the purified enzyme16. We demonstrate NO synthase in the brain to be exclusively associated with discrete neuronal populations. NO synthase is also concentrated in the neural innervation of the posterior pituitary, in autonomic nerve fibres in the retina, in cell bodies and nerve fibres in the myenteric plexus of the intestine, in adrenal medulla, and in vascular endothelial cells. These prominent neural localizations provide the first conclusive evidence for a strong association of NO with neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1975971473,"The gene associated with cystic fibrosis (CF) encodes a membrane-associated, N-linked glycoprotein called CFTR. Mutations were introduced into CFTR at residues known to be altered in CF chromosomes and in residues believed to play a role in its function. Examination of the various mutant proteins in COS-7 cells indicated that mature, fully glycosylated CFTR was absent from cells containing delta F508, delta 1507, K464M, F508R, and S5491 cDNA plasmids. Instead, an incompletely glycosylated version of the protein was detected. We propose that the mutant versions of CFTR are recognized as abnormal and remain incompletely processed in the endoplasmic reticulum where they are subsequently degraded. Since mutations with this phenotype represent at least 70% of known CF chromosomes, we argue that the molecular basis of most cystic fibrosis is the absence of mature CFTR at the correct cellular location."
https://openalex.org/W1978817835,"In the central nervous system (CNS), the principal mediators of fast synaptic excitatory neurotransmission are L-glutamate-gated ion channels that are responsive to the glutamate agonist alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA). In each member of a family of four abundant AMPA receptors, a small segment preceding the predicted fourth transmembrane region has been shown to exist in two versions with different amino acid sequences. These modules, designated ""flip"" and ""flop,"" are encoded by adjacent exons of the receptor genes and impart different pharmacological and kinetic properties on currents evoked by L-glutamate or AMPA, but not those evoked by kainate. For each receptor, the alternatively spliced messenger RNAs show distinct expression patterns in rat brain, particularly in the CA1 and CA3 fields of the hippocampus. These results identify a switch in the molecular and functional properties of glutamate receptors operated by alternative splicing."

https://openalex.org/W2055090102,"Adhesion of circulating leukocytes to the vascular endothelium during inflammation is mediated in part by their interaction with the endothellal-leukocyte adhesion molecule ELAM-1. ELAM-1, a member of the LEC-CAM family of cell adhesion molecules, expresses an N-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) homologous to various calcium-dependent mammallan lectins. However, the contribution of the CRD to cell adhesion and its carbohydrate binding specificity have not been elucidated. This study demonstrates that transfection of a human fucosyltransferase cDNA into nonmyeloid cell lines confers ELAM-1-dependent endothelial adhesion. Binding activity correlates with de novo cell surface expression of the slalylated Lewis x tetrasaccharide, whose blosynthesis is determined by the transfected fucosyltransferase cDNA. We propose that specific α(1,3)fucosyltransferases regulate cell adhesion to ELAM-1 by modulating cell surface expression of one or more α(2,3)sialylated, α(1,3)fucosylated lactosaminoglycans represented by the sialyl Lewis x carbohydrate determinant."

https://openalex.org/W1996339077,"Different combinations of cloned rat brain subunit isoforms of the GABAA receptor channel were expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The voltage-clamp technique was then used to measure properties of the GABA-induced membrane currents and to study the effects of various modulators of the GABAA receptor channel (diazepam, DMCM, pentobarbital, and picrotoxin). This approach was used to obtain information on the minimal structural requirements for several functional properties of the ion channel. The combination alpha 5 beta 2 gamma 2 was identified as the minimal requirement reproducing consensus properties of the vertebrate GABAA receptor channel, including cooperativity of GABA-dependent channel gating with a Ka in the range of 10 microM, modulation by various drugs acting at the benzodiazepine binding site, picrotoxin sensitivity, and barbiturate effects."
https://openalex.org/W2006406301,"We have isolated two cDNA clones (GIuR-K2 and GIuRK3) that share considerable sequence identity with the previously described glutamate receptor subunit, GIuRK1. The three glutamate receptor subunits show significant sequence conservation with the glutamine binding component of the glutamine permease of E. coli. Each of these clones encodes a channel responsive to both kainate and AMPA. The coexpression of GIuR-K2 with either GluR-K3 or GIuR-K1 results in the formation of channels whose current-voltage relationships differ from those of the individual subunits alone and more closely approximate the properties of kainate receptors in neurons. These observations indicate that the kainate/quisqualate receptors are encoded by a family of genes and are likely to be composed of hetero-oligomers of at least two distinct subunits."

It is detectable in discrete zones, for example on astrocytes delineating ""barrels"" in the rodent somatosensory cortex. To investigate the effects of J1/tenascin on neural cell behavior in vitro, we have generated two monoclonal antibodies specific for protein epitopes on J1/tenascin and used them for immunoaffinity isolation of the molecule from postnatal mouse brain. The purified ECM molecule alone did not support attachment and growth of cerebral astrocytes or E14 mesencephalic, E18 hippocampal, and P6 cerebellar neurons. When various ECM constituents were adsorbed to polyornithine-conditioned glass, a favorable substrate for neural cells, the neurons avoided J1/tenascin-, but not laminin- or fibronectin-coated surfaces, while they grew on J1/tenascin-free, polyornithine-containing areas of the coverslip. In contrast, astrocytes formed uniform monolayers on all of these substrates. We conclude that J1/tenascin could serve to define repulsive territories for CNS neurons from different stages of neural development."
https://openalex.org/W2134551213,"Heparin-binding growth factor-1 (HBGF-1) is an angiogenic polypeptide mitogen for mesoderm- and neuroectoderm-derived cells in vitro and remains biologically active after truncation of the amino-terminal domain (HBGF-1 alpha) of the HBGF-1 beta precursor. Polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis and prokaryotic expression systems were used to prepare a mutant of HBGF-1 alpha lacking a putative nuclear translocation sequence (amino acid residues 21 to 27; HBGF-1U). Although HBGF-1U retains its ability to bind to heparin, HBGF-1U fails to induce DNA synthesis and cell proliferation at concentrations sufficient to induce intracellular receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and c-fos expression. Attachment of the nuclear translocation sequence from yeast histone 2B at the amino terminus of HBGF-1U yields a chimeric polypeptide (HBGF-1U2) with mitogenic activity in vitro and indicates that nuclear translocation is important for this biological response."
https://openalex.org/W2031463996,"PADGEM (platelet activation-dependent granule-external membrane protein) is a leukocyte receptor of activated platelets that mediates cellular adhesion of platelets to neutrophils and monocytes. To identify the natural ligand on neutrophils and monocytes that interacts with PADGEM, we have evaluated anti-leukocyte antibodies for their ability to block leukocyte-PADGEM binding. Only anti-CD15 antibodies were able to inhibit the binding of neutrophils, monocytes, HL60 cells, and U937 cells to platelets. Anti-CD15 antibodies inhibited the binding of U937 cells to PADGEM-expressing COS cells and to purified PADGEM incorporated into phospholipid vesicles. The CD15 antigen, lacto-N-fucopentaose III (Gal beta 1----4[Fuc alpha 1----3]NAcGlc beta 1----3Gal-beta 1----4Glc), inhibited the interaction of neutrophils or HL60 cells with platelets, whereas lacto-N-fucopentaose I did not; lacto-N-fucopentaose II demonstrated minimal inhibition. Lacto-N-fucopentaose III, and to a lesser extent lacto-N-fucopentaose II, but not lacto-N-fucopentaose I, inhibited the interaction of HL60 cells with COS cells transfected with PADGEM cDNA. CD15, lacto-N-fucopentaose III or Lex, is a component of the PADGEM ligand on neutrophils and monocytes."

https://openalex.org/W2078577005,"The immunosuppressants FK506 and rapamycin bind to the same immunophilin, FK506 binding protein (FKBP), and inhibit distinct signal transduction pathways in T lymphocytes. A nonnatural immunophilin ligand, 506BD, which contains only the common structural elements of FK506 and rapamycin, was synthesized and found to be a high-affinity ligand of FKBP and a potent inhibitor of FKBP rotamase activity. Whereas 506BD does not interfere with T cell activation, it does block the immunosuppressive effects of both FK506 and rapamycin. Thus, the common immunophilin binding element of these immunosuppressants, which is responsible for rotamase inhibition, is fused to different effector elements, resulting in the inhibition of different signaling pathways. Inhibition of rotamase activity is an insufficient requirement for mediating these effects."
https://openalex.org/W2246378037,"Characterization of the three mammalian transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) isoforms, TGF-beta 1, -beta 2, and -beta 3, indicates that TGF-beta 3 is somewhat more potent (ED50 = 0.5 pM versus 2 pM) than TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 as a growth inhibitor of the Mv1Lu mink lung epithelial cell line. In the fetal bovine heart endothelial (FBHE) cell line, however, TGF-beta 1 and -beta 3 are at least 50-fold more potent than TGF-beta 2 which is a very weak growth inhibitor (ED50 greater than or equal to 0.5 nM). Thus, as growth inhibitors, TGF-beta 1 and -beta 3 resemble each other more than TGF-beta 2. The presence of serum alpha 2-macroglobulin in the FBHE cell assays decreases the biological potency of TGF-beta s, in particular TGF-beta 2. This effect of alpha 2-macroglobulin, however, is not sufficient to explain the low responsiveness of FBHE cells to TGF-beta 2. Evaluation of the role of TGF-beta receptors as determinants of cell-specific responsiveness to TGF-beta isoforms indicates that TGF-beta 1, -beta 2, and -beta 3 have similar affinity for the membrane proteoglycan, betaglycan. They differ, however, in their ability to bind to receptor types I and II which are implicated in TGF-beta signal transduction. TGF-beta 1 is similar, albeit not identical, to TGF-beta 3 and much more potent than TGF-beta 2 as a competitor for binding to the overall population of receptors I and II in all cell lines tested. A subset of receptors I and II has been identified in Mv1Lu cells which has high affinity for TGF-beta 2 (KD approximately 10 pM) and binds this factor at concentrations that are biologically active in Mv1Lu cells. This receptor subset could not be detected in FBHE cells, suggesting that cell-specific differences in the level of high affinity of TGF-beta 2 receptors may lead to cell-specific differences in responsiveness to this isoform. Thus, despite their structural and biological similarities, TGF-beta 1, -beta 2, and -beta 3 diverge in their ability to bind to receptors in a manner that correlates with their potency as growth inhibitors."

Here we report the analysis of a cDNA corresponding to a gene induced in mouse 3T3 cells by growth factors and a variety of other extracellular signaling agents. The cDNA encodes a proline-, serine-, and glycine-rich nuclear protein designated Nup475 of 319 amino acids that contains two tandemly repeated cysteine- and histidine-containing sequences (CX8CX5CX3H) suggestive of a novel heavy metal-binding domain. Nup475 produced in Escherichia coli binds zinc. Its mRNA is present in a number of mouse tissues and cell lines, being especially abundant in intestine, thymus, and regenerating liver and in a macrophage cell line stimulated by gamma-interferon. We hypothesize that Nup475 is a regulatory protein with a novel zinc finger structure."

The only function identified for human CD1 is as a ligand recognized by a subpopulation of T lymphocytes. In order to study the distribution and function of these molecules in the mouse, a murine CD1 complementary DNA was expressed in mouse fibroblasts and used to produce monoclonal antibodies. These antibodies revealed prominent expression of murine CD1 only on gastrointestinal tract epithelium and in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. Low levels of expression were also detected on thymocytes and peripheral lymphocytes. The gastrointestinal distribution of murine CD1 suggests that this molecule may be important in epithelial immunity."

https://openalex.org/W1486175763,"This study explores conformational states of human platelet glycoprotein IIIa (GP IIIa) and possible mechanisms of fibrinogen receptor exposure. D3GP3 is an IgG1, kappa monoclonal antibody generated against purified GP IIIa and found to be specific for GP IIIa by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. The binding of D3GP3 to resting platelets caused fibrinogen binding (approximately 5,000 molecules/platelet) and platelet aggregation but not secretion. Platelets express 40,000-50,000 GP IIb-IIIa molecules in their surface membranes. However, resting platelets only bound approximately 5,000 D3GP3 molecules/platelet. D3GP3 binding to platelets could be increased 2-3-fold by dissociation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex with 5 mM EDTA or by occupying the fibrinogen receptor with either RGDS peptides or fibrinogen. Platelet stimulation with ADP in the absence of fibrinogen did not cause increased D3GP3 binding above control levels. These data suggest that 1) GP IIb-IIIa can exist in multiple conformations in the platelet membrane, 2) D3GP3 binding to GP IIIa can expose the fibrinogen receptor, 3) the binding of either RGDS peptides or fibrinogen causes exposure of the D3GP3 epitope, and 4) platelet activation in the absence of ligand does not induce the same conformational changes in GP IIb-IIIa as does receptor occupancy by RGDS peptides or fibrinogen."
https://openalex.org/W1513937290,"In the present study, the ability of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) to stimulate hexose transport in quiescent 3T3-L1 fibroblasts has been examined. Activation of transport occurred in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with maximal stimulation (6-8-fold) observed 16 h after exposure to 2.5 nM TNF. Early activation of hexose transport by TNF (2-fold within 30 min) was associated with increased plasma membrane immunoreactive glucose transporters. Prolonged exposure to TNF (16 h) resulted in a 2-fold increase in glucose transporter content of both plasma and inner membrane compartments. The magnitude of increased glucose transport (6-8-fold) was greater than the increased content of plasma membrane glucose transporters (2-fold), suggesting that the TNF-treatment altered the intrinsic activity of the glucose transporters. Increased transcription of the glucose transporter (GLUT-1) gene, as well as several immediate-early genes (c-fos, c-jun, jun-B, and beta-actin) was observed within 15 min of exposure to TNF. Transcriptional activation of immediate-early genes was tightly coupled to subsequent accumulation of their respective mRNAs. However, increased GLUT-1 mRNA (8 h after TNF treatment) was due to an apparent 3-fold increase in the stability of this message and not to increased transcription. The time course of TNF-induced hexose transport occurred concomitant with a 6-fold increase in total RNA synthesis which preceded a 3-fold increase in protein synthesis. Moreover, TNF induced cell-cycle progression through S-phase, as measured by aphidicolin-sensitive thymidine uptake. Phorbol myristate acetate also stimulated hexose transport as well as expression of the GLUT-1 gene and several immediate-early genes in quiescent 3T3-L1 cells. TNF-induced immediate-early gene expression was intact in PMA-pretreated cells (with the exception of GLUT-1 and beta-actin genes where the response was muted), suggesting the involvement of multiple pathways in TNF signal transduction. Our results indicate that TNF initiates mitogenic events in quiescent 3T3-L1 fibroblasts reminiscent of serum-derived growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W1576313910,"A 240-kDa protein exhibiting immunochemical cross-reactivity with red blood cell spectrin has been shown to be directly associated with the 63-kDa cGMP-gated channel of bovine rod outer segments. When detergent-solubilized, chromatographically purified channel preparations were treated with Sepharose beads coupled to either an anti-240-kDa monoclonal antibody (PMs 4B2) or an anti-63-kDa channel monoclonal antibody (PMc 1D1), both the 240-kDa protein and the 63-kDa channel protein were concomitantly immunoprecipitated as analyzed by Western blotting of sodium dodecyl sulfate gels. Both of these antibody-Sepharose matrices also removed cGMP-gated channel activity as measured by functional reconstitution. In control studies anti-rhodopsin monoclonal antibody (Rho 1D4)-Sepharose beads removed residual rhodopsin, but not the 63/240-kDa complex or channel activity. Western blotting of purified rod outer segment disk and plasma membrane fractions and immunogold-dextran labeling of lysed rod outer segments indicated that the 240-kDa polypeptide, like the 63-kDa channel, is preferentially localized to the plasma membrane as visualized by electron microscopy. The 240-kDa protein does not appear to be directly involved in the cGMP-gated channel activity, but it may be part of a cytoskeletal system that serves to maintain the organization of the 63-kDa channel complex within the rod outer segment plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1480548185,"Abstract 3'-Azido-3'-deoxythymidine 5'-triphosphate (AZTTP) was an efficient substrate for the human immunodeficiency virus 1 reverse transcriptase. It was incorporated into both homopolymer and defined sequence DNA-primed RNA templates and DNA-primed DNA templates. The substrate and inhibitor kinetics of both AZTTP and dTTP were dependent on the template-primer and reaction conditions used. dTMP was incorporated into poly(rA).oligo(dT) and into a defined sequence DNA-primed RNA template (when the other three 2'-deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphates were present) as a conventional substrate, with steady-state Km values of 5-10 microM. The results suggest that the reverse transcriptase was capable of processive DNA polymerization on these DNA-primed RNA templates. In contrast, in the absence of the other three 2'-deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphates, the time course for incorporation of dTMP into the same defined sequence DNA-primed RNA template was biphasic. A burst of product formation was observed followed by a slow steady-state rate with a Km value of 0.082 microM. AZTMP incorporation into poly(rA).oligo(dT) and into the defined sequence DNA-primed RNA template produced similar biphasic time courses and steady-state Km values. These results were consistent with rate-limiting dissociation of the polymerase.template-primer complex after termination of polymerization. AZTMP and dTMP were both incorporated into the homopolymer DNA-primed DNA template, poly(dA).oligo(dT), and a defined sequence DNA-primed DNA template as conventional substrates. Their Km values were similar (2-10 microM). The absence of biphasic time courses suggested that dissociation of the DNA-primed DNA templates from the enzyme, after forced termination, was not rate-limiting. This was consistent with a more distributive mode of DNA polymerization. With the defined sequence template-primers and poly(dA).oligo(dT), Ki values for both dTTP and AZTTP were comparable to their Km values. Thus, AZTTP appeared to be a simple competitive substrate-inhibitor with respect to dTTP. AZTTP inhibition of dTMP incorporation into poly(rA).oligo(dT) was linear competitive at low concentrations (0-100 nM) of AZTTP (Ki = 35 nM) but became hyperbolic (decreasing potency) at concentrations of AZTTP above this range. A mechanism for this nonlinear inhibition is discussed."

Chem. 263, 15454-15461) in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of cultured human endothelial cells (HUVEC) was studied. Like PAI-1, VN was found associated with the ECM as evidenced by direct antibody binding, by Western blot analysis as well as by diffuse immunofluorescence staining in permeabilized HUVEC. The specific interaction of VN with confluent monolayers of HUVEC was found to be saturable within 2-4 h at 37 degrees C only with respect to binding to the cells, while no saturable binding to the underlying ECM was observed, indicating that the majority if not all ECM-associated VN was derived from the culture medium. In contrast to PAI-1, ECM-associated VN was resistant toward glycine (pH 2.3), guanidine or urokinase treatment, suggesting that VN was tightly associated with the ECM network. Binding of recombinant PAI-1 (rPAI-1) was largely blocked by anti-VN IgG and only partly by anti-collagen IgG but not by antibodies against other ECM components, indicating that VN constitutes the primary binding protein for ECM-associated PAI-1. This contention was supported by ligand blotting experiments in which rPAI-1 was reacted with nitrocellulose replicas of electrophoretically separated ECM components. Protein band(s) (Mr = 63,000-67,000), comigrating with bovine VN (i.e. medium-derived VN) rather than with human VN were identified as major binding component(s). Moreover, binding studies with purified components revealed that PAI-1 did not show any affinity for collagen (type I/III) alone, whereas VN collagen coating was a much better template for PAI-1 binding than VN alone and that conformationally extended VN provides maximal PAI-1 binding capacity. Binding of rPAI-1 to surface-coated VN was saturable and revealed that (unlike urokinase) heparin or the synthetic peptide Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser did not inhibit PAI-1 binding. Ligand binding of rPAI-1 to nitrocellulose replicas from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels containing electrophoretically separated peptides from VN digests documented the association of PAI-1 with Mr = 10,000-20,000 fragments originating from the heparin-binding domain of VN. These results indicate that the exposure of the glycosaminoglycan-binding domain in VN may allow the concomitant binding of PAI-1 and heparin-like molecules to this region of the VN molecule.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1490615017,"A nuclear factor I (NFI) binding sequence in the myelin basic protein (MBP) promoter is required for brain-specific transcription.

The entire sequence of NFI-B suggests that NFI-B is a mouse counterpart of NFI-L, which was previously isolated from rat liver. NFI-B is highly enriched in the cerebellum, in contrast with a ubiquitous NFI, CTF/NF-I. NFI-B proteins translated in vitro could bind to the MBP NFI site. Furthermore, we demonstrated by transfection experiments that NFI-B activated transcription from transfected MBP promoter in neuronal/glial NG108-15 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1575879758,"Organization of endothelium as the lining of the cardiovascular system is supported by basement membrane. The important role of laminin and other basement membrane proteins is assumed in the angiogenesis. We show here that cultured endothelial cells produce two forms of laminin, and their relative levels are changed by antiangiogenic steroids. The synthesis of laminin subunits by endothelial cells isolated from bovine aorta and from bovine pulmonary artery was studied by metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine. Both endothelial cells produced a novel laminin-related polypeptide (A' subunit) in addition to the A, B1, and B2 subunits. Two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoretic analysis showed that the B1B2 complex was first formed and the A subunit joined it to form the AB1B2 complex or the A' subunit joined it to form A'B1B2 complex. This mechanism implied that replacement of subunits in the complex by a corresponding variant produces variety in the structure and function of laminin. The A'B1B2 complex was the major product in endothelial cells under normal culture conditions. An angiostatic steroid, medroxyprogesterone, suppressed the A' synthesis and stimulated the A synthesis. Consequently, the major product of bovine aorta endothelial cells was converted to AB1B2. Two types of intracellular precursors were identified for each laminin-related polypeptide. Since the precursors in a given complex were synchronized with regard to maturation, the assembly of AB1B2 and A'B1B2 complexes was suggested to occur at an early step of intracellular processing."

https://openalex.org/W1547570854,"Abstract The intron-containing tRNA(Trp) precursor from Halobacterium volcanii, like many intron-containing archaebacterial precursor tRNAs, can assume a structure in which the two intron endonuclease cleavage sites are localized in two three-nucleotide loops separated by four base pairs. To investigate the role of this structure in cleavage by the halophilic endonuclease, a series of mutant tRNA(Trp) RNAs were prepared and evaluated as substrates. We find that alterations in this structure result in the loss of cleavage at both 5' and 3' sites. Cleavage of a 35-nucleotide model RNA substrate, containing only these features, demonstrates that sequences and structures present at the exon-intron boundaries are sufficient for recognition and cleavage. We have also examined the mechanism used by the halophilic endonuclease to identify the cleavage sites. Addition of a single base, or a base pair in the anticodon stem above the cleavage sites, does not affect the cleavage site selection. The addition of nucleotides between the two cleavage sites significantly decreases cleavage efficiency and has an effect on the cleavage site selection. These results demonstrate that the halophilic endonuclease requires a defined structure at the exon-intron boundaries and does not identify its cleavage sites by a measurement mechanism like that employed by eukaryotic tRNA intron endonucleases."
https://openalex.org/W1579611404,"Although steroids have been implicated in post-transcriptional regulation, their effects on mRNA translation rates have been uncertain. We have used a cell-free translation system programmed with synthetic messages to show that steroids can alter the translation rates of a number of myelin protein mRNAs and the mRNA encoding a non-myelin protein, the estrogen receptor. Through the use of deletion analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and chimeric mRNAs we have identified a 9-nucleotide segment in the 5'-untranslated region of one myelin protein mRNA that is necessary for steroid action. Steroid-mediated translational regulation is discussed in terms of myelination where subtle developmental changes in protein composition of the membrane have significant consequences on its morphology and function. We propose that the modulation of mRNA translation rates by steroids is a more general phenomenon that may serve as another mechanism by which steroids can regulate gene expression."

Using the luciferase reporter gene system we have identified a region of the H promoter required for the retinoic acid response.

https://openalex.org/W1529540653,"Charybdotoxin (ChTX), a potent inhibitor of the high conductance Ca2(+)-activated K+ channel (PK,Ca) is a highly basic peptide isolated from venom of the scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus, whose primary structure has been determined (Gimenez-Gallego, G., Navia, M. A., Reuben, J. P., Katz, G. M., Kaczorowski, G. J., and Garcia, M. L. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 85, 3329-3333). The synthesis of this peptide using continuous flow solid phase fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl-pentafluorophenyl ester methodology has now been achieved. The 1-37-amino acid hexasulfhydryl peptide oxidizes readily to give the tricyclic disulfide structure in good yield. This folded synthetic material is identical to native toxin based on three criteria: co-migration with ChTX on reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC); competitive inhibition of 125I-labeled monoiodotyrosine charybdotoxin binding to bovine aortic sarcolemmal membrane vesicles with a Ki (10 pM) identical to that of native toxin; blockade of PK,Ca activity in excised outside-out patches from bovine aortic smooth muscle with the potency and inhibitory properties characteristic of ChTX (i.e. appearance of silent periods interdispersed with normal bursts of channel activity in single channel recordings). Selective enzymatic digestion of native or synthetic ChTX by simultaneous exposure to chymotrypsin and trypsin yields identical reversed phase HPLC profiles. Analysis of the sequence and amino acid composition of the resulting fragments defines a disulfide bond arrangement (Cys7-Cys28, Cys13-Cys33, Cys17-Cys35) which differs from that previously suggested. This configuration predicts a highly folded tertiary structure for ChTX which, together with observations from electrophysiological and binding experiments, suggests a possible mechanism by which ChTX interacts with PK,Ca to block channel function."
https://openalex.org/W1545347787,"Peptide hormones can stimulate cyclic GMP synthesis through either of two general mechanisms: some peptides activate the cytoplasmic form of guanylate cyclase via a coupling factor called EDRF (endothelium-derived relaxation factor), while others activate the membrane form by interacting directly with an extracellular binding domain of the cyclase molecule itself. We have investigated the mechanism(s) by which crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH), a neuropeptide that regulates energy metabolism in crustaceans, elevates cyclic GMP levels in lobster muscle. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors potentiate the response in intact tissue. This indicates that the primary effect of the peptide is to activate a cyclase rather than inhibit a phosphodiesterase. Methylene blue, a specific inhibitor of the EDRF pathway, does not block the actions of CHH. In addition, nitroprusside, an agent that directly activates the EDRF pathway in vertebrate animals, does not activate guanylate cyclase either in intact or homogenized lobster muscle. This indicates that the EDRF pathway, although prominent in vertebrate muscle, is not found in crustaceans and further suggests that the membrane cyclase is the most likely target of CHH. Membrane and soluble cyclases can be isolated from homogenates of lobster muscle (in a 3.5:1 ratio), and both are stimulated by Mn2+ and inhibited by Ca2+. CHH has no effect on the soluble enzyme. Coupling of CHH receptors to the particulate cyclase, however, remains intact in isolated membranes, thus providing a new model system for the study of receptor/cyclase interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1654708089,"Upon binding of bacteriophage T5 tails to purified FhuA receptor protein the tail-tip protein pb2 became extremely sensitive to trypsin and other proteases. However, when T5 tails were bound to FhuA integrated into liposomes, pb2 was found to retain some resistance to trypsin. Electron microscopic examination of tail-liposome complexes supported the idea that trypsin resistance of pb2 in such complexes was caused by insertion of the tail-tip into the liposomes. pb2 was isolated from tails by treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate and was further purified by gel filtration using a fast protein liquid chromatography system. pb2 obtained with this procedure was most likely monomeric. It was extremely sensitive to trypsin. When reconstituted into black lipid bilayer membranes, it formed pores with an average single-channel conductance of 4.6 nanosiemens in 1 M KCl. Zero-current potential measurements showed only a very slight preference, if any, for cations over anions. The data are compatible with pb2 forming a large water-filled transmembrane channel. The functioning during infection of pb2 in cytoplasmic membrane depolarization and phage DNA uptake into the cell is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2006076593,"The DNA-dependent RNA polymerase of bacteriophage T7 efficiently and specifically replicates two structurally related RNAs, termed X and Y RNAs. Replication of both RNAs involves synthesis of complementary strands initiated with pppC and pppG. RNAs transcribed from DNA template containing the established sequences of X and Y RNAs were efficiently replicated by T7 RNA polymerase. Both RNAs possess palindromic sequences with a dual axis of symmetry, permitting formation of hairpin-, dumbbell-, or cloverleaf-type structures. The template must consist of RNA and not DNA sequence, and the terminal unpaired dinucleotides of the RNA are necessary for replication. Nucleotidyl transferase activity of E. coli adenylates the unpaired CCOH dinucleotide at the 3' end of a C strand of X RNA. This feature, as well as the length (64 nucleotides) and compact structure of X and Y RNAs, suggests that they may resemble tRNA molecules and tRNA-like structures at the 3' termini of many plant viral RNA genomes."
https://openalex.org/W1663592530,"In primary cultures of anterior pituitary cells, dopamine inhibited basal and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-stimulated inositol monophosphate, bisphosphate, and trisphosphate production. This inhibition by dopamine can be resolved into two distinct components. One of the components was rapid and already present after 10 s. The other was slower, starting after 1 min, and was mimicked by nimodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist. The effects of dopamine and nimodipine were not additive on both basal and TRH-stimulated inositol phosphate production. Furthermore, the dopamine inhibition in the presence of TRH was much higher than the inhibition induced by nimodipine. It is thus likely that calcium entry through voltage-dependent calcium channels triggers a positive feedback on TRH stimulation of phospholipase C. However, depolarizing concentrations of K+ or BAY-K-8644, a voltage-dependent calcium channel agonist, had no effect on inositol monophosphate and bisphosphate accumulation. Ionomycin, even at a very high concentration (10 microM), had only a slight and transient effect on inositol phosphate formation. In addition, these agents did not affect the TRH dose-dependent stimulation of inositol phosphate production. These results suggest that the intracellular calcium concentrations that we measured under basal and TRH-stimulated conditions are sufficient to allow the maximal activity of phospholipase C which can be obtained under these two experimental conditions. In contrast, any decrease in the intracellular calcium concentration by a dihydropyridine antagonist, suppression of extracellular calcium, or inactivation of a voltage-dependent calcium channel by long term depolarization with K+ decreased the phospholipase C activities measured under basal and TRH-stimulated conditions. From these data it can be concluded that dopamine inhibits inositol phosphate production by two distinct mechanisms. The slow dopamine-induced inhibition of TRH-stimulated inositol phosphate production which is mimicked by nimodipine is likely because of an inhibition of a voltage-dependent calcium channel. This is substantiated further by the fact that ionomycin (10 microM) was able to reverse the nimodipine inhibitions as well as this slow component of dopamine inhibition. The nature of the rapid inhibition of TRH-stimulated inositol phosphate production induced by dopamine, but not by nimodipine, remains to be determined. It is suppressed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. This may suggest that this inhibition is related to blockade of non-dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1504602313,"The genome of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and especially the envelope gene are mutated with unusually high frequency during in vivo replication. Recent studies indicate that HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) is unusually error prone and that the number of generated mutations is disproportionately high within repetitive base sequences. To study the ability of recombinant and wild-type HIV RT to traverse specific homo-oligomeric stretches, we used bacteriophage M13 DNA templates that contain different oligo(purine) and oligo(pyrimidine) inserted tracts. The progress of HIV RT along these templates was potently inhibited from further progression only at a (dA)16 insert. Comparison with other polymerases indicates that the almost complete blockage of polymerization beyond an oligo(dA) insert is unique to HIV RT and Moloney murine leukemia virus RT, which has high sequence homology with HIV RT. The extent of termination of HIV RT at the oligo(dA) run is not affected by alterations in the concentration of KCl, Mg2+, dNTP, or by a decrease in pH. Obstruction of HIV RT opposite the oligo(dA) insert is not alleviated by moving the primer position further upstream from the oligo(dA) insert. Lastly, HIV RT purified directly from virions is also specifically arrested at an oligo(dA) tract. Competition experiments indicate that the concentration of active HIV RT in the presence of M13(dA)16 DNA is similar to that observed in the presence of M13(dG)16 DNA. In addition, preincubation of M13(dA)16 DNA with HIV RT does not subsequently inhibit avian myeloblastosis virus RT from successfully traversing the (dA)16 insert. Therefore, it appears that the blockage of chain elongation of HIV RT at the (dA)16 insert is not the result of trapping the enzyme at this site."
https://openalex.org/W1507648776,"We have examined the relative transcript levels of the junB and c-jun proto-oncogenes during development of the mouse testis. junB and c-jun mRNA levels are low in total RNA from intact immature or mature testes. Dissociation of testicular cells, however, increases the levels of junB and c-jun mRNAs, with higher increases in the dissociated cells from testes of 8-day-old mice than from 17-day-old or sexually mature mice. These differences in junB and c-jun mRNA levels localize to specific cell types. In testes from 8-day-old mice, the mRNA levels for both proto-oncogenes are higher in type B spermatogonia and in the interstitial cell fraction than in type A spermatogonia. In testes of 17-day-old mice, the highest mRNA levels for both proto-oncogenes are seen in preleptotene spermatocytes and interstitial cells, with decreasing levels in leptotene/zygotene spermatocytes and prepuberal pachytene spermatocytes. junB and c-jun mRNAs are nearly undetectable in pachytene spermatocytes, round spermatids, and residual bodies/cytoplasts. The increased junB mRNA levels originate not only from the expected 2.1-kilobase transcript but from a more slowly migrating transcript of about 2.3 kilobases. RNase H analysis demonstrates that this migration change was due to an increase in mRNA polyadenylation. The low levels of junB and c-jun mRNAs in intact testes and the much higher levels in isolated cells from identical testes suggest that the disruption of cell-to-cell contact increases the amount of junB and c-jun transcripts in specific cells of the testis. Coupled with this increase, structural changes are seen with the junB mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1575019366,"Expression of the pyrBI operon of Escherichia coli K12, which encodes the pyrimidine biosynthetic enzyme aspartate transcarbamylase, is negatively regulated by pyrimidine availability, primarily through an attenuation control mechanism, and also appears to be subject to stringent control. Previous in vitro transcription studies indicated that the pyrBI operon is transcribed from tandem promoters designated P1 and P2, which appeared to be of similar strength. In this study, we characterized these promoters in detail and examined their role in pyrBI expression. Our results show that although transcription is initiated at both promoters in vivo, greater than 99% of the pyrBI transcripts are initiated at promoter P2, indicating that this is the only physiologically significant promoter. The level of transcripts initiated at promoter P2 was found to be higher in cells grown under pyrimidine-limiting conditions compared to that in cells grown under conditions of pyrimidine excess, indicating pyrimidine-mediated regulation at the level of transcriptional initiation. In vitro characterization of transcription from the pyrBI promoter region showed that non-physiological reaction conditions used in the original identification of the two promoters greatly overestimated the strength of promoter P1. Further in vitro characterization of the two promoters showed that transcription from promoter P2, but not from promoter P1, is inhibited by guanosine tetraphosphate and exhibits salt and heparin sensitivity typical of a stringently controlled promoter. In addition, heparin-challenge experiments revealed a UTP-induced instability of transcriptional initiation complexes at promoter P2 which may be of regulatory significance."
https://openalex.org/W1589231329,Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is an auxiliary protein required for leading strand DNA synthesis by polymerase delta. Steady-state levels of PCNA RNA increase during interleukin 2 stimulated G1 activation of cloned T cells (L2 cells) and correlate with expression of the PCNA protein. We demonstrate that the initial (G1) rapid rise in PCNA RNA levels is predominantly related to increased transcription. The slower rate of increase in PCNA RNA at the initial G1-S transition is related to transcription as well as increased stability of the PCNA message and partially requires protein synthesis. These data provide a foundation for further investigation of the mechanisms of increased stability and transcription of PCNA.

https://openalex.org/W1612327509,"The enzyme(s) catalyzing the 5'-monodeiodination of thyroxine and 3,3',5'-triiodothyronine has not yet been purified, and antibodies of demonstrated specificity are not available. Thus, molecular cloning strategies which rely on the traditional screening techniques of using cDNA probes or monospecific antibodies are problematic. We previously reported that expression of type I 5'-deiodinase can be induced in Xenopus laevis oocytes by the injection of poly (A)+ RNA prepared from rat liver (St. Germain, D.L., and Morganelli, C.M. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 3054-3056). Using this expression system, we developed a hybrid arrest assay, and with it identified a 241-base pair cDNA which encodes part of this enzyme. The cDNA inhibits translation of 5'-deiodinase activity in oocytes by greater than 99% and 5'-deiodinase mRNA from rat liver poly(A)+ RNA in hybrid selection experiments. The cDNA hybridizes to a 1.9-kilobase RNA species on Northern analysis and demonstrates no significant homology to any previously cloned protein. The application of this hybrid arrest strategy for molecular cloning may prove useful for the isolation of cDNAs for proteins that are low in abundance, difficult to purify, or are subunits of a polymeric functional unit."

https://openalex.org/W1514320119,"In a unique Chinese hamster mutant, Gal-32, the mitochondrially encoded subunits of cytochrome c oxidase (CO I, II, III) and NADH dehydrogenase (ND 1-6) are greatly decreased while other mitochondrially synthesized proteins, such as ATPase subunits 6 and 8, are less affected. Pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine demonstrated that the reduced amounts of CO I and ND 5 subunits in Gal-32 are not the result of more rapid protein degradation. No differences in sizes of mtRNAs were detected between wild type and mutant using Northern blotting. The steady state levels of both heavy and light strand mtDNA transcripts were elevated in Gal-32: CO I mRNA was 1.5-fold higher in the mutant than in the wild type; ND 5 mRNA was 1.9-fold higher; ND 6 precursor RNAs were 1.4-fold higher and ATPase 6 and 8 mRNA (a single transcript) was 2.7-fold higher. Thus, the amounts of translation products are roughly correlated with the levels of mRNAs. The reduced levels of mitochondrially synthesized proteins in Gal-32 are the result of decreased translation of specific mRNAs, not increased degradation of mtRNAs."
