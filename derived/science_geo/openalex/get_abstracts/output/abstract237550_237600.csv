https://openalex.org/W2159879659,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves amyloid β (Aβ) accumulation, oxidative damage, and inflammation, and risk is reduced with increased antioxidant and anti-inflammatory consumption. The phenolic yellow curry pigment curcumin has potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities and can suppress oxidative damage, inflammation, cognitive deficits, and amyloid accumulation. Since the molecular structure of curcumin suggested potential Aβ binding, we investigated whether its efficacy in AD models could be explained by effects on Aβ aggregation. Under aggregating conditions in vitro, curcumin inhibited aggregation (IC50 = 0.8 μm) as well as disaggregated fibrillar Aβ40 (IC50 = 1 μm), indicating favorable stoichiometry for inhibition. Curcumin was a better Aβ40 aggregation inhibitor than ibuprofen and naproxen, and prevented Aβ42 oligomer formation and toxicity between 0.1 and 1.0 μm. Under EM, curcumin decreased dose dependently Aβ fibril formation beginning with 0.125 μm. The effects of curcumin did not depend on Aβ sequence but on fibril-related conformation. AD and Tg2576 mice brain sections incubated with curcumin revealed preferential labeling of amyloid plaques. In vivo studies showed that curcumin injected peripherally into aged Tg mice crossed the blood-brain barrier and bound plaques. When fed to aged Tg2576 mice with advanced amyloid accumulation, curcumin labeled plaques and reduced amyloid levels and plaque burden. Hence, curcumin directly binds small β-amyloid species to block aggregation and fibril formation in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that low dose curcumin effectively disaggregates Aβ as well as prevents fibril and oligomer formation, supporting the rationale for curcumin use in clinical trials preventing or treating AD. Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves amyloid β (Aβ) accumulation, oxidative damage, and inflammation, and risk is reduced with increased antioxidant and anti-inflammatory consumption.

The 4-kDa (40–42-amino acid) amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) 1The abbreviations used are: Aβ, amyloid β; APP, amyloid precursor protein; AD, Alzheimer's disease; CR, Congo Red; dH2O, distilled H2O; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; ANOVA, analysis of variance; EM, electron microscopy; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; NSAID, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug; HFIP, hexafluoroisopropanol. is derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through sequential proteolysis by the aspartyl protease β-secretase and presenilin-dependent γ-secretase cleavage (1Selkoe D.J. Science. 1997; 275: 630-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Mutations at the cleavage sites in APP or in presenilin that increase production or aggregation of Aβ provide a compelling argument for a central role for Aβ aggregation in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The progressive accumulation of Aβ aggregates is widely believed to be fundamental to the initial development of neurodegenerative pathology and to trigger a cascade of events such as neurotoxicity, oxidative damage, and inflammation that contribute to the progression of AD (2Pike C.J.

Therefore, many therapeutic efforts are targeted at reducing Aβ production, including inhibiting secretase, increasing Aβ clearance with amyloid vaccines, or blocking Aβ aggregation (with antibodies, peptides, or small organic molecules that selectively bind and inhibit Aβ aggregate and fibril formation). Aβ fibrillization involves formation of dimers and small oligomers followed by growth into protofibrils and fibrils via a complex multistep-nucleated polymerization. Polymerizing Aβ fibrils and intermediates can be stained by amyloidophilic dyes such as Congo Red (CR) (6Puchtler H. Sweat F. Levine M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1962; 10: 355-364Crossref Google Scholar). Congo Red can inhibit the toxic and inflammatory activity of polymerizing Aβ (7Lorenzo A. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12243-12247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar, 8Abe K. Kato M. Saito H. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 29: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and prevent the natural oligomer formation found at low Aβ concentrations (9Podlisny M.B. Walsh D.M. Amarante P. Ostaszewski B.L. Stimson E.R. Maggio J.E. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3602-3611Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, CR is toxic and negatively charged and therefore poorly brain-penetrant (10Klunk W.E. Debnath M.L. Pettegrew J.W. Neurobiol. Aging. 1994; 15: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Curcumin (diferulomethane) is a low molecular weight molecule with potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities that has a favorable toxicity profile and is under development as a potential cancer chemotherapeutic agent (11Kelloff G.J. Crowell J.A. Hawk E.T. Steele V.E. Lubet R.A. Boone C.W. Covey J.M. Doody L.A. Omenn G.S. Greenwald P. Hong W.K. Parkinson D.R. Bagheri D. Baxter G.T. Blunden M. Doeltz M.K. Eisenhauer K.M. Johnson K. Knapp G.G. Longfellow D.G. Malone W.F. Nayfield S.G. Seifried H.E. Swall L.M. Sigman C.C. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1996; 26: 72-85PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous results demonstrated that chronic dietary curcumin lowered Aβ deposition in 16-month-old APPsw transgenic mice (Tg2576) (12Lim G.P. Chu T. Yang F. Beech W. Frautschy S.A. Cole G.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8370-8377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it remains unresolved whether curcumin was reducing plaques in vivo in part by effects on aggregation. As shown in Fig. 1, curcumin has a structure similar to Congo Red but with the charge replaced by polar groups like the brain-permeable compound chrysamine G (10Klunk W.E. Debnath M.L. Pettegrew J.W. Neurobiol. Aging. 1994; 15: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 13Klunk W.E. Jacob R.F. Mason R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 266: 66-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). It is also similar to RS-0406, a novel compound selected from a screen of 113,000 compounds as a potent inhibitor of Aβ oligomer formation (14Nakagami Y. Nishimura S. Murasugi T. Kaneko I. Meguro M. Marumoto S.K.H. Koyama K. Oda T. Br. J. Pharamacol. 2002; 137: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that, like these polar Aβ binding compounds, curcumin might be able to cross the blood-brain barrier and bind to amyloid and related aggregates. Therefore, in these studies, we used an in vitro model of Aβ fibrillization to show that curcumin can bind amyloid to inhibit Aβ aggregation as well as fibril and oligomer formation with dosing at achievable levels. We also demonstrate that curcumin can label plaques in vitro and in vivo, block toxicity of oligomers in vitro, and significantly reduce amyloid levels in aged Tg2576 mice (22 months old) fed a curcumin diet beginning at 17 months after established amyloid deposition. Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides were purchased from the laboratory of Dr. Charles Glabe (University of California, Irvine, CA) and American Peptide (Sunnyvale, CA). Aβ fragment peptides 1–13, 1–28, 25–35, 34–40, and 37–42 were purchased from Bio-Synthesis (Lewisville, TX), and Aβ 12–28 was purchased from American Peptide Company. Aβ 8–17, 14–24, 17–24, and 17–28 were purchased from Quality Control Biochemicals (Hopkinton, MA). Curcumin, naproxen, and ibuprofen were purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). Stocks of curcumin, naproxen, and ibuprofen (5 mm) were dissolved in 100% ethanol and stored at -80 °C. A 5 mm stock of Congo Red was prepared in dH2O immediately before use. The 6E10 antibody (Aβ 1–17) was purchased from Signet Labs, and the A11 antibody was generously provided by C. Glabe (University of California, Irvine). All other reagents were from Sigma. Just before use, curcumin was diluted from 2.5 mm to 50 nm in 0.1 m TBS (pH 7.4) containing 3% BSA with 0.5% Tween 20. Thioflavin S (1%) was freshly prepared in dH2O, stirred for 0.5 h, and filtered. Human AD hippocampus was fixed in buffered formalin and snap-frozen. Tg2576 mice (22 months old) were perfused with Hepes buffer and protease inhibitors (15Lim G.P. Yang F. Chu T. Chen P. Beech W. Teter B. Tran T. Ubeda O. Hsiao Ashe K. Frautschy S.A. Cole G.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5709-5714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and brains were removed, fixed in buffered formalin, and snap-frozen. Both brains were cryosectioned at 12 μm and stored at -70 °C. Sections were warmed to room temperature for 10 min and dipped in 75% ethanol, treated with 0.3% Triton X-100 and 0.1 m TBS (pH 7.4) containing 3% BSA with 0.5% Tween 20 for 10 min each. Different concentrations of curcumin were applied to sections for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. Sections were washed in TBS three times, rinsed once in dH2O, and coverslipped with fluorescent mounting medium. Adjacent sections were stained with 1% thioflavin S for 10 min at room temperature and dipped for 1 min in 75% ethanol, 95% ethanol, 100% ethanol, 95% ethanol, and 75% ethanol before rinsing in dH2O. All sections were examined and photographed with a fluorescence microscope using fluorescein isothiocyanate optics. Groups of APPsw Tg2576 transgenic mice raised on Purina 5015 breeder chow were placed on 500 ppm curcumin (Sabinsa, Piscataway, NJ) or control safflower oil-based test diets (TD#02347 and TD#02346, respectively; Harlan Teklad) and aged until 22 months. A curcumin stock solution was diluted 1:100 into sterile PBS. Three 22-month-old Tg2576 mice (50 g body weight) were anesthetized with 25 mg/ml nembutal (intraperitoneally). One mouse on the chronic 500 ppm curcumin diet was injected with 200 μl of curcumin/PBS into the right carotid artery over a 5-min period. Because blood volume for a 50-g mouse was estimated to be about 4 ml (80 ml/kg × 0.05 kg), we expected blood levels of curcumin to reach ∼2 μm. The other two mice were injected with PBS only as a control, and one of these mice had also received the 500-ppm curcumin diet. After 1 h, the mice were perfused as described previously (15Lim G.P. Yang F. Chu T. Chen P. Beech W. Teter B. Tran T. Ubeda O. Hsiao Ashe K. Frautschy S.A. Cole G.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5709-5714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Brains were removed and snap-frozen in 2-methylbutane chilled by liquid nitrogen. Freshly cut cryosections (12 μm) were air-dried for 10 min in the dark and coverslipped with VECTASHIELD mounting medium for fluorescence protection (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Sections were examined and photographed with a Nikon Microphot-Fx fluorescence microscope using a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set. Image Analysis of Plaque Pathology—Plaque burden was assessed using a characterized polyclonal antibody against Aβ 1–13 (DAE) (15Lim G.P. Yang F. Chu T. Chen P. Beech W. Teter B. Tran T. Ubeda O. Hsiao Ashe K. Frautschy S.A. Cole G.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5709-5714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Coronal sections were made through anterior (bregma; -1.00 to -1.46 mm), middle (bregma; -1.58 to -2.30 mm), and posterior hippocampus (bregma; -2.46 to -3.16 mm) of control (n = 6) and curcumin-treated mice (n = 8). Immunolabeling was examined in various cortical and hippocampal areas of animals, and image analysis was performed as described previously (12Lim G.P. Chu T. Yang F. Beech W. Frautschy S.A. Cole G.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8370-8377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Lim G.P. Yang F. Chu T. Chen P. Beech W. Teter B. Tran T. Ubeda O. Hsiao Ashe K. Frautschy S.A. Cole G.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5709-5714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amyloid Extracts and Assays—Amyloid levels were evaluated in the cortex of control (n = 6) and curcumin-fed (n = 4) Tg2576 mice. Samples were processed in TBS and lysis buffer (detergent) as described previously (16Calon F. Lim G.P. Yang F. Morihara T. Teter B. Ubeda O. Rostaing P. Triller A. Salem Jr., N. Ashe K.H. Frautschy S.A. Cole G.M. Neuron. 2004; 43: 633-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Detergent-insoluble pellets from cortex were sonicated in 8 volumes of 5 m guanidine, 50 mm Tris-HCl and solubilized by agitation at room temperature for 3–4 h. Guanidine-soluble extracts were diluted 1:10,000 with TBS containing 5% BSA and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem) and assayed for total Aβ by ELISA as described previously (17Howlett D.R. Perry A.E. Godfrey F. Swatton J.E. Jennings K.H. Spitzfaden C. Wadsworth H. Wood S.J. Markwell R.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Aggregation—Aβ40 was dissolved at 1 mg/ml in dH2O, and curcumin stock was diluted in 0.1 m TBS with 0.02% Tween 20. Aβ40 (100 μg/ml) was mixed a 1:1 volume ratio with curcumin in Eppendorf tubes and incubated for 6 days at 37 °C. Final concentrations of Aβ40 were 50 μg/ml (11.6 μm), and curcumin concentrations were 0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 μm. Disaggregation of Preformed Fibrils—Aβ40 (100 μg/ml) was incubated for 3 days at 37 °C to generate fibrils. Preformed fibrils were mixed with the same concentrations of curcumin as above for an additional 3 days at 37 °C. At the end of both incubations, an aliquot (3 μl) was taken from each tube for electron microscopy (EM) analysis. The remaining Aβ solution was assayed for aggregates using the 6E10/6E10 sandwich ELISA. 6E10/6E10 Aggregation ELISA—To determine the relative amount of aggregated Aβ, the monoclonal antibody 6E10 was used for both detection and capture as described by Howlett et al. (17Howlett D.R. Perry A.E. Godfrey F. Swatton J.E. Jennings K.H. Spitzfaden C. Wadsworth H. Wood S.J. Markwell R.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with 3 μg/ml 6E10 in 55 mm sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 9) at 4 °C overnight before wells were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with TBS-Tween 20 (TBS-T; 0.1 m TBS, pH 7.4, 0.02% Tween 20) with 1% BSA. Samples were transferred to the wells, and plates were placed on an orbital shaker (30 rpm) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing four times with TBS-T, biotinylated 6E10 antibody diluted 1:1200 in TBS-T containing 1% BSA was applied to the plate for 1 h at room temperature with shaking. After washing, alkaline phosphatase streptavidin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) diluted at 1:4000 in TBS-T with 1% BSA was applied to the plates, followed by the addition of the fluorescent substrate, Attophos (Promega). Fluorescence was measured using a CytoFluor II fluorescence plate reader (excitation 450 nm and emission 580 nm; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Aβ 1–40 was dissolved at 1 mg/ml in dH2O. A 50 μg/ml solution was made with 0, 0.5, 2, or 8 μm curcumin. Naproxen and ibuprofen were tested at 0, 8, 16, and 32 μm. Samples were sealed in Eppendorf tubes and incubated for 6 days at 37 °C. Aβ aggregates were assayed with the 6E10/6E10 ELISA as above. Separate drug-only controls were used to assess possible drug fluorescence interference in the assay. EM was used to observe inhibition of Aβ fibril formation in disaggregation and aggregation inhibition experiments (see Fig. 5). To determine whether filaments had formed, 3 μl of Aβ peptide solution was applied to 150-mesh copper grids coated with Formvar/carbon film (EM Sciences, Fort Washington, PA) for 30 s. Excess solution on the other side of grids was absorbed with filter paper, grids were stained with one drop of 0.5% filtered uranyl acetate for 20 s, and staining solution was absorbed with filter paper again. After air drying for 4 h or overnight, grids were examined with an electron microscope (TECNAI 10/12; Phillips) at 80 kV. Aβ40 and Aβ42 were solubilized in HFIP, dried overnight at room temperature and speed-vacuumed for 10 min (18Chromy B.A. Nowak R.J. Lambert M.P. Viola K.L. Chang L. Velasco P.T. Jones B.W. Fernandez S.J. Lacor P.N. Horowitz P. Finch C.E. Krafft G.A. Klein W.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12749-12760Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Aliquots were stored at -80 °C until they were needed, when they were resolubilized in 20 μl of Me2SO and dissolved in dH2O (1 mg/ml). Additional samples of Aβ40, Aβ42, and shorter Aβ peptides were dissolved in dH2O, whereas Aβ 17–24 was dissolved in Me2SO. Peptides were aggregated in TBS (0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 75 mm NaCl, 0.025% NaN3) at 500 μg/ml. Two hundred μl of each peptide solution was sealed in Eppendorf tubes and incubated without shaking at 37 °C for 10 days. After 10 days, an aliquot was removed for EM analysis of structure before solutions from each tube were mixed with curcumin at a final concentration of 1 μm. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then spun at 16,000 × g for 10 min. To assess curcumin staining of synthetic peptide aggregates, pellets were mixed with 10 μl of dH2O, smeared to slides, and air-dried for 1 h. Supernatant, spun down after mixing Aβ peptides with 1 μm curcumin, were applied to cryosections of Tg2576 mouse brain (22 months) at 37 °C for 1 h. Slides were coverslipped with anti-quenching mounting medium before examination under a fluorescent microscope (Table I).Table ICurcumin binds to peptide sequences that form fibrils or protofibrils Shown are a schematic diagram and table of curcumin binding experiments. Aβ was aggregated for 10 days at 37 °C before an aliquot was removed for EM analysis. Curcumin was incubated with samples before they were centrifuged. Pellets were smeared on glass slides to check for Aβ binding while supernatants were applied to Tg2576 mouse brain sections for plaque labeling. Weak staining was defined as + or ++, and strong staining was +++ or ++++. Fibrils/protofibrils were determined by estimating thickness and length of fibers. Open table in a new tab Immunoblot of Curcumin- and Congo Red-treated Aβ42 Oligomers—An aliquot of Aβ42 (0.045 mg) was dissolved in 20 μlofMe2SO and diluted in Ham's F-12 media without phenol red (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA). Aβ42 (5 μm) was incubated with curcumin (0, 0.25, 1, 4, 16, and 64 μm) or Congo Red (16 and 64 μm) in a 37 °C water bath for 4 h. After the incubation, the samples (72 μl) were spun at 14,000 × g (4 °C for 10 min), and the supernatant (65 μl) was mixed with an equal part of Tricine sample buffer without reducing agents (Bio-Rad). The unaggregated Aβ42 control was not incubated at 37 °C, and after dilution in F-12 medium, it was mixed with sample buffer (no centrifuging) and stored at -20 °C before it was electrophoresed. Samples (30 μl, no boiling) were electrophoresed at 100 V on a 10–20% Tris-Tricine SDS gel, transferred at 100 V for 1 h, and blocked overnight (4 °C) with 10% nonfat milk in PBS plus 0.1% gelatin. The blots were probed with 6E10 (1:2000; 3 h at room temperature), followed by goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000; 1 h at room temperature), and developed with ECL. Dot Blot Assay—Aβ40 oligomer was prepared from HFIP-solubilized Aβ (4 mg/ml, 10–20 min in HFIP at 25 °C). An 80-μl Aβ aliquot was diluted 1:10 with 800 μl of sterile H2O. The final Aβ concentration was 400 μg/ml or 88 μm. Curcumin was added to Aβ solutions to give final 0, 2, and 16 μm curcumin in 0.01% methanol. After the pH was adjusted (pH 3), the samples were incubated for 2.5 h at 42 °C followed by a 48-h incubation at room temperature with stirring. Samples (500 ng of oligomer) were applied to nitrocellulose membrane in a Bio-Dot apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked with 10% nonfat milk in TBS-T at room temperature for 1 h, washed with TBS-T, and probed with anti-oligomer A11 antibody (19Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar) solution (1:10,000) or 6E10 (1: 10,000) in 3% BSA-TBS-T overnight at 4 °C. After washing, it was probed with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase- or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Pierce) solution (1:12,000) for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was developed with SuperSignal (Pierce) for 2–5 min. Dots were scanned and analyzed with a model GS-700 densitometer using Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad). Toxicity Assays—Confirmation of Aβ oligomer toxicity was performed in human APPSwe neuroblastoma (N2a) cells, which were cultured in 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 50% Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), 5% fetal bovine serum, 200 μg/ml Glutamax. Cells were plated at equal densities (8000 cells/well) with 1.5% bovine calf serum and maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The medium was removed before treatment and replaced with medium containing 70% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 30% Opti-MEM with 0.1% BSA. An LDH assay was performed on media using the LDH assay toxicity kit (Promega, Madison, WI). To determine whether curcumin could block this oligomer toxicity, SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were grown and maintained as described previously (20Yang F. Sun X. Beech W. Teter B. Wu S. Sigel J. Vinters H.V. Frautschy S.A. Cole G.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 379-389PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were plated at 10,000 cells/well in 96-well plates and were differentiated in low serum Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with N2 supplement and 1 × 10-5m all-trans-retinoic acid for 7 days. The medium was removed and replaced with fresh maintenance medium containing 0.1% BSA. Aβ42 oligomer (100 nm) was added to cells for 48 h at 37 °C with or without 0.1, 1, 2.5, and 5 μm curcumin. After treatment, LDH assay was performed as mentioned above. Cell viability was assayed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reduction assay (21Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46517) Google Scholar), where absorbance was measured at 550 nm. Each data point was determined in triplicate, and the S.D. value did not exceed 5%. Because curcumin is a fluorochrome, we first compared plaque-associated curcumin fluorescence with that of thioflavin S, using sections from APPsw (Tg2576) mouse brain (Fig. 2, A, B, and E) and AD hippocampus (Fig. 2, C and D). Like thioflavin S (Fig. 2, A and C), curcumin brightly labeled amyloid plaques (1 μm; Fig. 2, B–E). In AD brain, curcumin labeled plaques with a yellow fluorescence (Fig. 2D) similar to thioflavin S in an adjacent section (Fig. 2C). Thioflavin S labeled tangles very strongly (Fig. 2C), whereas curcumin labeled tangles only weakly or not at all (Fig. 2D). Curcumin fluorescence was initially yellow-orange, but with prolonged (>2-min) light exposure, the fluorescence gradually shifted to yellow/green fluorescence. This phenomenon is illustrated in Fig. 2E, where the right side of the field was illuminated for 3 min before shifting the field back to make the photoexposure. Color change depended on the intensity of plaque staining and the fluorescent exposure time, and was stable for several weeks at 4 °C. Lipofuscin age pigments in this aged mouse brain (small arrows) are orange/red under these thioflavin optics and, unlike curcumin labeling, did not show a fluorescent shift with prolonged illumination. Optimal staining concentrations for curcumin were 0.5–2 μm. Unlike thioflavin S and Congo Red, curcumin is highly hydrophobic and should readily enter the brain to bind to plaques in vivo. In order to evaluate this idea, we injected curcumin (50 μm in 200 μl) or vehicle (PBS) into the carotid artery of aged Tg2576 mice. Mice were sacrificed 1 h later, and unfixed cryosections were immediately prepared from snap-frozen brains. Untreated mice injected with PBS only showed no plaque staining (Fig. 3A), but a mouse on a chronic curcumin diet (500 ppm) showed discernable but weak plaque staining when injected with PBS alone (Fig. 3B). Plaques in the curcumin-injected mouse were brightly labeled (Fig. 3, C and D). These data suggested that curcumin can cross the blood-brain barrier and bind to plaques in transgenic mice after oral feeding or peripheral injection. Having established that curcumin can stain in vitro and in vivo amyloid, we sought to test whether it can interfere with Aβ aggregation and its disaggregation. Because curcumin fluoresces over the same wavelengths as thioflavin S, we could not use thioflavin-based assays to quantify amyloid fibrils in curcumin-treated samples, and thioflavin-based assays require high concentrations of Aβ. Therefore, we employed a sandwich ELISA for aggregated Aβ using the same N-terminal Aβ antibody (6E10) for both capture and detection. Aβ40 (final concentration 50 μg/ml) was incubated under fibril-forming conditions with 0–8 μm curcumin. As shown in Fig. 4A, Aβ aggregation was significantly inhibited with increasing doses of curcumin, with an approximate IC50 of 0.81 μm (gray circles; p < 0.001). When Aβ was preaggregated for 3 days before incubation with curcumin, increasing doses of curcumin were capable of inducing the disaggregation of preaggregated Aβ40, with an IC50 of 1 μm (filled circles; p < 0.005; Fig. 4B). In control experiments, curcumin over this range did not interfere with the Aβ aggregate ELISA and did not interfere with an ELISA with 6E10 as the capture and anti-Aβ 34–40 as the detection (not shown), implying that curcumin did not simply block 6E10 antibody binding. We also sought to test whether curcumin was better than other NSAIDs at inhibiting Aβ aggregation. Aβ40 (final concentration 50 μg/ml) was incubated with curcumin (0–8 μm), naproxen (0–32 μm), or ibuprofen (0–32 μm) for 6 days at 37 °C. The presence of Aβ aggregates was determined with the 6E10/6E10 ELISA. In this assay, curcumin again showed dose-dependent inhibition of Aβ aggregate formation over the low dose range (Fig. 4C), in contrast to naproxen and ibuprofen (Fig. 4, D and E). These data indicate that although high concentrations of naproxen and ibuprofen can inhibit Aβ aggregation (20Yang F. Sun X. Beech W. Teter B. Wu S. Sigel J. Vinters H.V. Frautschy S.A. Cole G.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 379-389PubMed Google Scholar), curcumin is a better aggregation inhibitor. EM Analysis of Inhibition of Fibril Formation—To determine whether curcumin could inhibit the formation of fibrils, EM was used to examine samples of Aβ40 incubated with and without curcumin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Aβ40 (50 μg/ml) incubated for 6 days at 37 °C formed extensive, but less mature fibrils (Fig. 5A) than fibrils formed with a higher concentration of Aβ40 (100 μg/ml; Fig. 5D). These fibrils were extensive and more uniform in thickness than those at the lower concentration, with less branching, bumps, or nodules. In order to test whether low physiologically relevant concentrations of curcumin might inhibit fibril formation, we tested curcumin's impact on Aβ assembly at the lower Aβ40 (50 μg/ml) concentration. If a low dose of curcumin (0.125 μm) was included in the initial incubation, fibril formation appeared reduced (Fig. 5B). A higher dose (2 μm) resulted in similar but more potent inhibition of fibril formation (Fig. 5C). Droplets of curcumin/Tween accumulated with curcumin dose as fibril formation was inhibited. In order to determine whether curcumin could also be inhibitory when added after initial aggregation events, we incubated 100 μg/ml Aβ40 for 3 days at 37 °C and then incubated another 3 days at 37 °C without (Fig. 5D) or with 0.125 μm (Fig. 5E) and 2 μm curcumin (Fig. 5F). The results show that curcumin limits fibril formation even when added midway through the incubation, consistent with an impact on fibril maturation or dissolution. Curcumin Prevents Formation of Oligomers—Soluble oligomers of Aβ or “ADDLs” are a neurotoxic species implicated in AD pathogenesis (22Walsh D.M. Klyubin I. Fadeeva J.V. Cullen W."
https://openalex.org/W2091602394,"SUMO, or Smt3 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is a ubiquitin-like protein that is post-translationally attached to multiple proteins in vivo. Many of these substrate modifications are cell cycle-regulated, and SUMO conjugation is essential for viability in most eukaryotes. However, only a limited number of SUMO-modified proteins have been definitively identified to date, and this has hampered study of the mechanisms by which SUMO ligation regulates specific cellular pathways. Here we use a combination of yeast two-hybrid screening, a high copy suppressor selection with a SUMO isopeptidase mutant, and tandem mass spectrometry to define a large set of proteins (>150) that can be modified by SUMO in budding yeast. These three approaches yielded overlapping sets of proteins with the most extensive set by far being those identified by mass spectrometry. The two-hybrid data also yielded a potential SUMO-binding motif. Functional categories of SUMO-modified proteins include SUMO conjugation system enzymes, chromatin- and gene silencing-related factors, DNA repair and genome stability proteins, stress-related proteins, transcription factors, proteins involved in translation and RNA metabolism, and a variety of metabolic enzymes. The results point to a surprisingly broad array of cellular processes regulated by SUMO conjugation and provide a starting point for detailed studies of how SUMO ligation contributes to these different regulatory mechanisms.

The results point to a surprisingly broad array of cellular processes regulated by SUMO conjugation and provide a starting point for detailed studies of how SUMO ligation contributes to these different regulatory mechanisms. Many types of post-translational protein modifications alter protein function, and in some cases the modifying group is itself a protein. The prototypical example of this is ubiquitin, a small, highly conserved polypeptide that is reversibly linked to many different proteins (probably thousands) in the cell (1Peng J. Schwartz D. Elias J.E. Thoreen C.C. Cheng D. Marsischky G. Roelofs J. Finley D. Gygi S.P. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). Polypeptides distinct from but related to ubiquitin, called ubiquitin-like proteins or Ubls, can also be ligated to proteins (2Hochstrasser M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E153-E157Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 3Schwartz D.C. Hochstrasser M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 321-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Ligation to each Ubl has unique mechanistic and functional consequences. SUMO (Smt3 in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is a divergent Ubl that has crucial roles in many organisms (4Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 690-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 5Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). Vertebrates have four SUMO variants, SUMO1–SUMO4, whereas yeasts have only one. Only human SUMO1, and not the other SUMO variants, can substitute for the essential yeast protein (6Johnson P.R. Hochstrasser M. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 408-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Activation and conjugation reactions involving SUMO have much in common with those of ubiquitin (reviewed in Refs. 2Hochstrasser M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E153-E157Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 5Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar, and 7Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Attachment of substrates to Smt3/SUMO depends on a heterodimeric SUMO-activating enzyme (E1), 1The abbreviations used are: E1, SUMO-activating enzyme; E2, SUMO-conjugating enzyme; E3, SUMO-protein ligase; ORF, open reading frame; MS, mass spectrometry; GBD, Gal4 DNA-binding domain; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside.1The abbreviations used are: E1, SUMO-activating enzyme; E2, SUMO-conjugating enzyme; E3, SUMO-protein ligase; ORF, open reading frame; MS, mass spectrometry; GBD, Gal4 DNA-binding domain; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. called Uba2-Aos1 in yeast, and a SUMO-conjugating enzyme (E2), Ubc9. Both enzymes form transient thiolester bonds with the C terminus of SUMO. Substrate recognition factors (E3s) that stimulate the transfer of SUMO from E2 to substrate have also been identified. SUMO, like ubiquitin, is always synthesized in precursor form, requiring enzymatic removal of a C-terminal peptide. Specialized proteases, called Ubl-specific proteases or Ulps, are responsible for these SUMO processing reactions and for reversing the post-translational attachment of SUMO to proteins. Unlike ubiquitin ligation, many sumoylation sites in proteins match a short consensus sequence, hKXE, where h represents a hydrophobic residue, X is any residue, and lysine (K) is the site of SUMO attachment (5Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). This consensus can be rationalized by structural data showing the direct binding of the Ubc9 E2 to the conserved elements of this sequence (8Bernier-Villamor V. Sampson D.A. Matunis M.J. Lima C.D. Cell. 2002; 108: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 9Hochstrasser M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 453-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This E2-substrate interaction is unlikely to be sufficient for specific substrate discrimination in the cell, so E3 factors are expected to be important for achieving the requisite in vivo specificity. The SUMO system has been implicated in multiple physiological pathways (3Schwartz D.C. Hochstrasser M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 321-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 4Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 690-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 5Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). SMT3, as well as the genes encoding the SUMO E1, E2, and Ulp1 protease, are all essential for viability in budding yeast, and cells with a conditional allele of either UBC9 or ULP1 are defective in cell cycle progression. The first identified target of SUMO conjugation was vertebrate RanGAP1, a protein required for nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. Modification by SUMO is required for RanGAP1 localization to the nuclear pore complex. Among the many (>50) mammalian targets for SUMO now known are RanBP2, another nuclear pore complex component; PML, a nuclear protein that is altered in certain leukemias; Sp100, an autoantigen in primary biliary cirrhosis; the p53 tumor suppressor; the Sp3 transcription factor; and the NF-κB inhibitor IκB. Even this partial list of in vivo targets makes it clear that the SUMO system must exert a major influence on mammalian growth and regulation. Misregulation of the system is likely to contribute to tumorigenesis, abnormal inflammatory responses, and autoimmune defects. In yeast, a much more limited number of SUMO-linked substrates has been characterized. The first was a subset of the septins, which are proteins essential for cytokinesis; however, eliminating septin sumoylation has no detectable phenotypic effect (10Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 11Johnson E.S. Gupta A.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Yeast topoisomerase II is also sumoylated in vivo, and this modification, while not required for the essential function of the enzyme, may contribute to the cohesive properties of the centromere (12Bachant J. Alcasabas A. Blat Y. Kleckner N. Elledge S.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1169-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). SUMO is also ligated to the DNA replication/repair protein PCNA (Pol30), and sumoylation inhibits the DNA repair activity of PCNA (13Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2002; 419: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar, 14Stelter P. Ulrich H.D. Nature. 2003; 425: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Although all of these substrate proteins are essential for growth, in no case is their sumoylation required for viability. Therefore, the protein or proteins that must be sumoylated for cell division in yeast remain to be identified. Additional proteins involved in chromosome cohesion, Pds5 and Ysc4, have also recently been reported to be transiently sumoylated in yeast, but the sites of sumoylation were not mapped (15Stead K. Aguilar C. Hartman T. Drexel M. Meluh P. Guacci V. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 16D'Amours D. Stegmeier F. Amon A. Cell. 2004; 117: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Determination of the precise functions of specific SUMO-protein modifications in S. cerevisiae should generally be more facile than in other eukaryotes. However, a much more comprehensive list of sumoylated proteins in this organism must first be obtained. Toward this end, we have taken several independent genetic and proteomic approaches. Our data reveal a surprisingly large and functionally diverse set of SUMO system substrates. Interestingly, the different methods of substrate identification have yielded overlapping but distinct groups of proteins, underscoring the value of using multiple approaches to establish the SUMO proteome. Yeast and Bacterial Methods—Rich (YPD) and minimal (SD) media were prepared as described (17Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1986Google Scholar). Standard methods were used for genetic analysis of yeast (17Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1986Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli strains used in this study were JM101, MC1061, BL21(DE3), and DH10B, and bacterial methods and media were as described (18Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar). Construction of Yeast Strains—Yeast strains used are listed in Table I. The strain background for all experiments other than the two-hybrid screen was MHY501 (19Chen P. Johnson P. Sommer T. Jentsch S. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1993; 74: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). To make the MHY2811 strain for purification of HFT-SUMO-protein conjugates, MHY1538 was transformed with YRTAG310-HFT-SMT3GG, and transformants were plated on 5-fluoroorotic acid to select for cells that had lost the two original URA3-marked plasmids. Other strains listed were generated by standard molecular genetic methods. The library of yeast strains with genes fused to the TAP tag was obtained from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL).Table IYeast strainsStrainGenotypeMHY501α his3-Δ200 leu2-3,112 lys2-801 trp1-1 ura3-52MHY1380α his3-Δ200 leu2-3,112 lys2-801 trp1-1 ura3-52 ulp2Δ::HIS3MHY1538α his3-Δ200 leu2-3,112 lys2-801 trp1-1 ura3-52 smt3Δ::HIS3 ulp1Δ::HIS3[pVT102U-SMT3gg YCp50-ULP1]MHY2809α his3-Δ200 leu2-3,112 lys2-801 trp1-1 ura3-52 smt3Δ::HIS3 ulp1Δ::HIS3[YRTAG310-H6-SMT3gg]MHY2811α his3-Δ200 leu2-3,112 lys2-801 trp1-1 ura3-52 smt3Δ::HIS3 ulpΔ::HIS3[YRTAG310-HFT-SMT3gg]PJ69-4Aa trp1-901 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 his3-Δ200 gal4Δ gal80Δ LYS2::GAL1-HIS3 GAL2-ADE2 met2::GAL7-lacZ Open table in a new tab Plasmid Constructions—The plasmid pGBD-U-C1-SMT3 for the two-hybrid screen was constructed by ligating a BamHI, SalI-cut PCR product that contained the entire SMT3 open reading frame (ORF) into pGBD-U-C1 (20James P. Halladay J. Craig E. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Derivatives of this plasmid that lacked either N-terminal or C-terminal coding sequences of SMT3 were made by EcoRI digestion and religation of the plasmid to make pGBD-SMT3-C30 or by BglII digestion and religation to make pGBD-SMT3-N30, respectively. Plasmid pGBD-SMT3ΔGG was made by PCR amplification of SMT3 sequence encoding its first 96 residues and ligation into BamHI, SalI-cut pGBD-U-C1. Plasmid pQE30-FLAG-TEV-SMT3GG was made by PCR amplification of the SMT3 ORF using a 5′ primer that included a BamHI site and sequences encoding a FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) followed by the tobacco etch virus recognition sequence (TEV; ENLYFQ/G) and a 3′ primer with sequences for SMT3 codons 90–98 followed by a stop codon and a SalI recognition site. The PCR product was cut with BamHI and SalI and ligated to the identically digested pQE30 (Qiagen) His6-tagging vector. A DNA fragment encoding His6-FLAG-TEV-SMT-GG was then amplified by PCR, digested with SalI and SacI, and cloned into the yeast CUP1-driven expression vector YRTAG310 that had been cut with XhoI and SacI, creating YRTAG310-HFT-SMT3GG. SMT3 and FLAG-TEV-tagged SMT3 alleles encoding mature SUMO were also amplified by PCR and were cloned into pRS426GAL for galactose-inducible expression. Insert sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Two-hybrid Screen with SUMO Bait—Full-length SMT3 (mature domain) was fused to the sequence encoding the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. This was used as bait for a two-hybrid screen of yeast plasmid libraries made of partial digested S. cerevisiae genomic sequences ligated to a sequence encoding the Gal4 activation domain (20James P. Halladay J. Craig E. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified DNA from the libraries was transformed into yeast strain PJ69–4A carrying the bait plasmid pGBD-U-C1-SMT3, and transformants were grown on triple dropout plates (SD-trp-leu-his) for 5 days at 30 °C. The PJ69–4A strain carries three reporter genes (HIS3, ADE2, and lacZ), each under the control of a different GAL promoter. Transformants that grew on the triple dropout plates (his+ and therefore able to activate GAL-HIS3) were rescreened on SD-trp-leu-ade dropout plates to test ADE2 expression and on X-gal-containing plates to test lacZ expression. Plasmids were isolated from yeast transformants that were his+ ade+ and blue on X-gal. The plasmids were retransformed into the two-hybrid tester strain to confirm the two-hybrid signal, and the plasmid insert junctions were sequenced using the suggested upstream and downstream primers (20James P. Halladay J. Craig E. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We tested the positive clones for interactions with the SUMO deletion mutant pGBD-SMT3ΔGG and in a tester strain that also carried ULP1 on a 2-μm plasmid. Selection for High Copy Suppressors of ulp2Δ—Selection of dosage suppressors of ulp2Δ temperature-sensitive growth at 37 °C was done by transformation of the ulp2Δ strain MHY1380 (21Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2367-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) with a YEp24 (2 μm, URA3)-based yeast genomic library. Transformants were plated on uracil dropout plates and incubated at 37 °C and, as a control, 30 °C. Approximately one in 104 to 105 ura+ transformants appeared as colonies on the 37 °C plates after 7 days. The ura+ thermoresistant colonies were restreaked at 37 °C to confirm the phenotype. Plasmid DNA was isolated from individual clones and transformed again into MHY1380 to test for the plasmid dependence of high temperature growth. Nine plasmid-dependent, temperature-resistant clones from ∼106 MHY1380 transformants were identified. Vector-insert junctions in these plasmids were determined by DNA sequencing and data base searching. For the four strongest suppressors, DNA subcloning and deletion was used to identify the genes responsible for the suppression. Immunoblotting—Proteins were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using either a GENIE blotter at 20 V for 2 h at 4 °C or a Bio-Rad semidry blotter at 25 V for 30 min at room temperature. The membrane was blocked with 10% skim milk in TBST solution (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times with TBST for 10 min. Primary antibodies diluted 1:3,000 to 1:10,000 in TBST with 1% skim milk were incubated with membrane for 1–2 h. The membrane was washed with TBST and incubated for 1 h with secondary antibody diluted 1:4,000 in TBST. After washing with TBST, antibody binding was detected using ECL Western blotting reagents (Amersham Biosciences). SUMO conjugates were visualized with a purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against yeast SUMO (22Li S.-J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Purification of SUMO-Protein Conjugates from Yeast—MHY2811 yeast cells were grown in 4 liters of YPD (no added copper) at 24 °C to an A600 of 0.5–1.0. Approximately 7–14 g of cells (wet weight) were pelleted, washed twice with deionized water, and shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen cells were ground to a powder to facilitate later resuspension in lysis buffer and were stored at –80 °C. Cells were resuspended in 3 volumes of extraction buffer (8 m guanidinium HCl, 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8) at room temperature. Cells were lysed at room temperature with three passes through a French press at 18,000 p.s.i. The lysate was cleared at 30,000 × g for 30 min at room temperature, and the supernatant was carefully removed with a pipette from below the cloudy lipid layer on top. The cleared lysate was bound to 2–4 ml of Talon beads for 60 min at room temperature. Protein-bound beads were then loaded into a column and washed three times with 10 volumes of wash buffer (8 m urea, 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8). Bound proteins were eluted with 300 mm imidazole in wash buffer, and 2-ml fractions were collected. Eluates were pooled, and the resulting 10–20-ml sample was diluted into 24 volumes of FLAG-binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) with protease inhibitors, in which 0.1 volumes of anti-FLAG beads (Sigma) were already present. After binding in batch for 90 min at 4 °C, the beads were transferred to a column, drained, and washed with 100–200 ml of FLAG wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and then 10–20 ml of TEV cleavage buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The drained beads were resuspended in 1–2 ml of TEV cleavage buffer containing 100 units of recombinant TEV protease (Invitrogen). TEV cleavage was executed in the sealed column on a shaker at 16 °C for at least 16 h. The column was drained and then washed several times with TEV cleavage buffer to collect all of the eluted protein. Samples of 2 ml were collected. Eluate 1 (E1) is the material from the original draining plus one column volume of wash, and E2 the following 2 column volumes of washings. The anti-FLAG beads were stripped with 0.1 m glycine at pH 3.5. Samples were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid at –20 °C for 2 h and spun down at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. Pellets were washed four times with ice-cold acetone to remove residual Nonidet P-40. Protein samples were checked by anti-SUMO immunoblot analysis and by Gel Code Blue (Pierce) staining. Mass Spectrometry and Computational Methods—The final purified protein fractions were reduced with 1 mm dithiothreitol and then carboxyamidomethylated with 5 mm iodoacetamide. The samples were diluted with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, and digested with 1:20 (v/v) Poroszyme-immobilized trypsin (Applied Biosystems, Streetsville, Canada) for 48 h at 30 °C with rotation. The resulting peptide mixtures were solid phase-extracted with SPEC-Plus PT C18 cartridges (Ansys Diagnostics; Lake Forest, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting peptide mixtures were sequenced by shotgun tandem mass spectrometry using the multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) of Yates and colleagues (23Washburn M.P. Wolters D. Yates J.R. II I Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4029) Google Scholar), as adapted by Kislinger et al. (24Kislinger T. Rahman K. Radulovic D. Cox B. Rossant J. Emili A. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2003; 2: 96-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 150-μm inner diameter fused silica capillary microcolumn (Polymicro Technologies; Phoenix, AZ) was pulled to a fine tip using a P-2000 laser puller (Sutter Instruments; Novato, CA) and packed to a 10-cm bed height with 5 μm Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 resin (Agilent Technologies, Mississauga, Canada) followed by 6cmof5 μm Partisphere strong ion exchanger (Whatman). The sample was loaded manually onto the column using a pressure vessel and then connected in-line to a quaternary high pressure liquid chromatography pump and interfaced with an LCQ DECA XP quadrupole ion trap tandem mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan; San Jose, CA). The eluate was analyzed by electrospray ionization using a fully automated four-buffer, 15-step chromatographic cycle essentially as described (24Kislinger T. Rahman K. Radulovic D. Cox B. Rossant J. Emili A. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2003; 2: 96-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Individual eluting peptides were subject to automated, data-dependent collision-induced fragmentation. The peptide spectra were searched against a locally maintained data base of yeast protein sequences obtained from the Saccharomyces Genome Database (around August 2001) using a distributed version of the SEQUEST algorithm running on a multiprocessor computer cluster (25Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates J.R. II I J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5315) Google Scholar) and filtered for high confidence protein matches (p value <0.05) using the STATQUEST statistical evaluation algorithm (24Kislinger T. Rahman K. Radulovic D. Cox B. Rossant J. Emili A. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2003; 2: 96-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The data sets were arranged into tabular format using the DTASelect and Contrast software programs (26Tabb D.L. McDonald W.H. Yates J.R. II I J. Proteome Res. 2002; 1: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar) and subgrouped into select gene ontology functional annotation categories (27Harris M.A. Clark J. Ireland A. Lomax J.

BMC Bioinformatics. 2002; 3: 35Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). We have undertaken a series of approaches to identify sumoylated proteins in yeast. These different methods were expected to yield different but related kinds of information about SUMO-protein ligation and the roles of SUMO modification in the cell. A “Covalent Interaction Trap” for SUMO-linked Proteins—A protein that can be covalently coupled to other proteins offers an interesting type of bait in an otherwise standard two-hybrid screen for protein-protein interactions (Fig. 1A). We fused SUMO (Smt3) to the C terminus of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (GBD), creating a fusion that can functionally replace normal SUMO (data not shown). Unlike most baits, a positive signal in the two-hybrid screen can be generated by covalent ligation of the bait, GBD-SUMO, to a library substrate protein fused to the Gal4 transcriptional activation domain (AD) (Fig. 1A, I). Alternatively, GBD-SUMO may get attached to an endogenous yeast protein that then can interact with the activation domain fusion (Fig. 1A, II). Finally and more conventionally, GBD-SUMO could interact noncovalently with an activation domain fusion (Fig. 1A, III). As will be described, it is possible to distinguish ligation-dependent association from noncovalent interactions. Thus, the screen could identify both SUMO-conjugated substrates and proteins that bind noncovalently to SUMO or SUMO-protein conjugates. The latter proteins may be SUMO pathway regulators or enzymes of the SUMO system. We screened ∼5 × 105 yeast genomic clones and identified segments of 13 different proteins that gave strong two-hybrid interaction signals with three reporter genes, each under the control of a different GAL promoter (20James P. Halladay J. Craig E. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). To determine whether any of the two-hybrid interactions were likely to depend on SUMO ligation, we tested them against a GBD-SUMOΔGG fusion, which lacks the terminal pair of glycines of SUMO and therefore cannot be attached to other proteins (29Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Seven of the tested interactions appear to require SUMO ligation because the interaction signal was no longer seen with GBD-SUMOΔGG (minus signs in Fig. 1B), as predicted for binding modes I and II in Fig. 1A. We also tested the sensitivity of these interactions to Ulp1 isopeptidase overexpression, since most SUMO-protein conjugates are depleted in cells overproducing this enzyme (22Li S.-J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Of the seven SUMOΔGG-sensitive interactors, five were also sensitive to Ulp1 overproduction; some SUMO conjugates might be poor substrates for Ulp1 in vivo, which might account for the two exceptions (Hex3 and Ufd1). In contrast, all but one of the identified prey proteins that also bound SUMOΔGG still interacted with SUMO in the presence of high Ulp1. ULP1HC-sensitive, SUMO diglycine-dependent interactors represent strong candidates for SUMO-linked substrates or proteins that bind such substrates. Among the 13 identified SUMO-interacting proteins are proteins involved in RNA metabolism, DNA repair, protein degradation, and gene silencing. Two of the proteins, Siz2/Nfi1 and Wss1, had been linked to the SUMO pathway in previous studies (11Johnson E.S. Gupta A.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 30Biggins S. Bhalla N. Chang A. Smith D.L. Murray A.W. Genetics. 2001; 159: 453-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Siz2 is an SP-RING-bearing E3-like factor involved in protein sumoylation, although its substrates are not known. The function of Wss1 is unclear, but it is a weak, high copy suppressor of a temperature-sensitive smt3 mutant. Interestingly, Siz2 and Nis1 have both been found to bind to septins, which are the most abundant sumoylated proteins in yeast. The septins localize to the bud neck during cell division, and another two-hybrid hit, Fir1, also localizes to this region. Besides Siz2, two other proteins, Ris1 and Hex3, contain a RING motif, a signature sequence for E3 ligases. Therefore, these proteins might be SUMO E3-like enzymes as well. Both Siz2 and Hex3 require a conjugation-competent form of SUMO for detection of a two-hybrid interaction. RING E3s in the ubiquitin pathway frequently ubiquitinate themselves. Autosumoylation might be occurring with Siz2 and Hex3, but the minimal segments of these two proteins that interacted with GBD-SUMO in the two-hybrid screen lacked the catalytic RING motif, which would suggest that sumoylation was occurring in trans. We chose Siz2 to determine whether it is in fact sumoylated in vivo and to validate the use of the two-hybrid screen to identify substrates for SUMO ligation. Previously, we had developed a gel shift assay to demonstrate in vivo protein ubiquitination (31Hochstrasser M. Ellison M.J. Chau V. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4606-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar); an analogous strategy was used here to test sumoylation. When Myc-tagged Siz2, expressed from the normal chromosomal locus,"

During kidney development, the metanephric mesenchyme contributes to emerging epithelium of the nephron via mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET). In the injured adult kidney, renal epithelia contribute to the generation of fibroblasts via epithelial-mesenchymal transition, facilitating renal fibrosis. Recombinant human bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-7, a morphogen that is essential for the conversion of epithelia from condensing mesenchyme during kidney development, enhances the repair of tubular structures in the kidney. In this setting, BMP-7 inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition involving adult renal epithelial tubular cells and decreases secretion of type I collagen by adult renal fibroblasts. In search of a mechanism behind the ability of BMP-7 to repair damaged renal tubules, we hypothesized that systemic treatment with BMP-7 might induce MET involving adult renal fibroblasts in the injured kidney, generating functional epithelial cells. Here we report that BMP-7 induces formation of epithelial cell aggregates in adult renal fibroblasts associated with reacquisition of E-cadherin expression and decreased motility, mimicking the effect of BMP-7 on embryonic metanephric mesenchyme to generate epithelium. In addition, we provide evidence that BMP-7-mediated repair of renal injury is associated with MET involving adult renal interstitial fibroblasts in mouse models for renal fibrosis. Collectively, these findings suggest that adult renal fibroblasts might retain parts of their original embryonic imprint and plasticity, which can be re-engaged by systemic administration of BMP-7 to mediate repair of tubular injury in a fibrotic kidney.

A distinction between epithelial and mesenchymal cells was appreciated in the late 19th century based on their morphology and topic organization (1Lilie F.R. The Development of the Chick. Henry Holt and Co., New York1908Google Scholar). Interconversion of mesenchymal and epithelial cells during embryonic development via epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) 1The abbreviations used are: EMT, epithelial to mesenchymal transition; BMP, bone morphogenic protein; rhBMP-7, recombinant human bone morphogenic protein-7; FSP1, fibroblast-specific protein-1; MET, mesenchymal to epithelial transition; NTN, nephrotoxic serum nephritis; IMDM, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium. and mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) are well established mechanisms in the development of multicellular organisms (2Hay E.D. Acta Anat. 1995; 154: 8-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). Capacity of epithelial and mesenchymal cells to interconvert during development is essential, because formation of mesenchymal cells from epithelial cells (EMT) enables these cells to migrate through an extracellular environment and settle in distinct areas to form organs (3Kalluri R. Neilson E.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1776-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2110) Google Scholar, 4Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5489) Google Scholar). In adults, mesenchymal and epithelial cells have been traditionally considered as terminally differentiated (2Hay E.D. Acta Anat. 1995; 154: 8-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar, 3Kalluri R. Neilson E.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1776-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2110) Google Scholar). However, more recent studies demonstrate that EMT is a common event among adult epithelial cells (3Kalluri R. Neilson E.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1776-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2110) Google Scholar, 4Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5489) Google Scholar). It has now been established that adult epithelial cells of the kidney, eye, lung, peritoneum, and colon can undergo EMT in chronic inflammatory diseases associated with fibrosis, in addition to EMT associated with carcinogenesis in a broad range of epithelia (3Kalluri R. Neilson E.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1776-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2110) Google Scholar, 4Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5489) Google Scholar). In animal models of kidney fibrosis, about 30% of fibroblasts derive via EMT, and inhibition of EMT can prevent the progression of fibrosis, demonstrating that EMT is an important contributor to the progression of renal disease (5Iwano M. Plieth D. Danoff T.M. Xue C. Okada H. Neilson E.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). The kidney has evolved as a model system to study embryonic and adult cellular plasticity between epithelia and mesenchyme (2Hay E.D. Acta Anat. 1995; 154: 8-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). Kidney development depends on a program of reciprocal inductive interactions between two mesodermal derivatives, the ureteric bud and the metanephric mesenchyme (6Horster M.F. Braun G.S. Huber S.M. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1157-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 7Dressler G. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 390-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In mice, at ∼10.5 days postcoitum, the ureteric bud contacts the metanephric mesenchyme, inducing these cells to condense and aggregate (6Horster M.F. Braun G.S. Huber S.M. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1157-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Subsequently, this induced population undergoes mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) to form a comma-shaped node, which elongates to form an S-shaped tubular epithelial structure (6Horster M.F. Braun G.S. Huber S.M. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1157-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 7Dressler G. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 390-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Further, morphogenesis and differentiation of this S-shaped tubule results in the formation of the glomerulus, the distal and proximal tubule elements associated with the mature nephron (6Horster M.F. Braun G.S. Huber S.M. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1157-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In the adult kidney, tubular epithelial cells can convert into fibroblast via EMT (8Zeisberg M. Kalluri R. J. Mol. Med. 2004; 82: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). During kidney fibrosis, conversion of renal tubular epithelial cells into myofibroblasts/fibroblasts is considered unfavorable, since it leads to disruption of polarized renal tubular epithelial layers and an increase in fibrotic scar formation (8Zeisberg M. Kalluri R. J. Mol. Med. 2004; 82: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Therefore, EMT in the kidney is of significant interest as a therapeutic target, and in this regard, inhibition of EMT by systemic administration of bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-7, results in regression of established lesions in the kidney and improved renal function (9Zeisberg M. Hanai J. Sugimoto H. Mammoto T. Charytan D. Strutz F. Kalluri R. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 964-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). The family of BMPs contains several different members and in general, BMPs control morphogenic pathways at different stages of development (10Ray R.P. Wharton K.A. Cell. 2001; 104: 801-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 11Hogan B.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). BMP-7, also sometimes referred to as osteogenic protein-1, was originally identified as a potent osteogenic factor purified from bone (12Ozkaynak E. Rueger D.C. Drier E.A. Corbett C. Ridge R.J. Sampath T.K. Oppermann H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2085-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Different studies have demonstrated a specific role for BMP-7 during mammalian kidney development (13Dudley A.T. Lyons K.M. Robertson E.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2795-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar, 14Luo G. Hofmann C. Bronckers A.L. Sohocki M. Bradley A. Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2808-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Although BMP-7 is expressed in many organized regions of the early embryo, defects in BMP-7-deficient mice are largely restricted to kidney and eye (13Dudley A.T. Lyons K.M. Robertson E.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2795-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar, 14Luo G. Hofmann C. Bronckers A.L. Sohocki M. Bradley A. Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2808-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). BMP-7-deficient mice die shortly after birth due to severe kidney dysplasia (13Dudley A.T. Lyons K.M. Robertson E.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2795-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar, 14Luo G. Hofmann C. Bronckers A.L. Sohocki M. Bradley A. Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2808-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). In the developing kidney, BMP-7 is expressed initially in the ureteric bud (15Godin R.E. Takaesu N.T. Robertson E.J. Dudley A.T. Development. 1998; 125: 3473-3482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As development proceeds, expression is next observed in the metanephric mesenchyme and then in the early tubules derived from the mesenchyme (15Godin R.E. Takaesu N.T. Robertson E.J. Dudley A.T. Development. 1998; 125: 3473-3482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BMP-7-deficient kidneys show a gradual cessation of nephrogenesis, associated with a reduction of ureteric bud and the loss of metanephric mesenchyme, suggesting that BMP-7 activities are essential for morphogenesis during the later stages of kidney development (13Dudley A.T. Lyons K.M. Robertson E.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2795-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar, 14Luo G. Hofmann C. Bronckers A.L. Sohocki M. Bradley A. Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2808-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). BMP-7 is considered a principal regulator of MET in kidney development and a survival factor for the metanephric mesenchyme (16Vukicevic S. Kopp J.B. Luyten F.P. Sampath T.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9021-9026Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 17Dudley A.T. Godin R.E. Robertson E.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1601-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In adults, BMP-7 is robustly expressed in the kidney (18Gould S.E. Day M. Jones S.S. Dorai H. Kidney Int. 2002; 61: 51-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, both acute and chronic renal injury are associated with substantial decrease in the expression of BMP-7 (19Vukicevic S. Basic V. Rogic D. Basic N. Shih M.S. Shepard A. Jin D. Dattatreyamurty B. Jones W. Dorai H. Ryan S. Griffiths D. Maliakal J. Jelic M. Pastorcic M. Stavljenic A. Sampath T.K. J. Clin.

Several recent reports unequivocally demonstrate that administration of exogenous recombinant human BMP-7 (rhBMP-7) enhances recovery of the kidney in animal models of acute and chronic renal injury (9Zeisberg M. Hanai J. Sugimoto H. Mammoto T. Charytan D. Strutz F. Kalluri R. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 964-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar, 19Vukicevic S. Basic V. Rogic D. Basic N. Shih M.S. Shepard A.

Physiol. 2003; 285: F1060-F1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). These studies collectively suggest that the therapeutic effect of rhBMP-7 is due to its direct effect on tubular epithelial cells and interstitial fibroblasts (8Zeisberg M. Kalluri R. J. Mol. Med. 2004; 82: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we demonstrate that BMP-7 can inhibit EMT involving tubular epithelial cells, resulting in potential repair of injured tubules (9Zeisberg M. Hanai J. Sugimoto H. Mammoto T. Charytan D. Strutz F. Kalluri R. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 964-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). In addition, we demonstrate that rhBMP-7 can reduce secretion of type I collagen from adult renal fibroblast (24Zeisberg M. Bottiglio C. Kumar N. Maeshima Y. Strutz F. Muller G.A. Kalluri R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F1060-F1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). However, the precise action and mechanism of BMP-7 activity on fibroblasts are still unknown. Here we report that BMP-7 can induce MET and potentially facilitate the repair of tubular epithelial structures in injured kidneys. Cell Culture—The human renal fibroblast cell line TK173 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin (25Muller G.A. Frank J. Rodemann H.P. Engler-Blum G. Exp. Nephrol. 1995; 3: 127-133PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were cultured with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. For experiments, the medium was replaced with Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM; Invitrogen) without fetal bovine serum. In cell culture experiments, rhBMP-7, dissolved in 24 mm sodium acetate containing 1% mannitol, was used (Curis, Inc., Cambridge, MA) (24Zeisberg M. Bottiglio C. Kumar N. Maeshima Y. Strutz F. Muller G.A. Kalluri R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F1060-F1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Induction of EMT-dependent Crescentic Nephritis—The protocol for inducing crescentic glomerulonephritis in mice, modified for studies to avoid rapid lethality from acute renal failure while ensuring adequate tissue injury for analysis, was used as described in our previous publication (9Zeisberg M. Hanai J. Sugimoto H. Mammoto T. Charytan D. Strutz F. Kalluri R. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 964-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar, 26Lloyd C.M. Minto A.W. Dorf M.E. Proudfoot A. Wells T.N. Salant D.J. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1371-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Briefly, CD1 mice weighing ∼30 g were preimmunized by subcutaneous injection of 200 μg of normal sheep IgG (Sigma) in Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma). After 5 days, experimental mice were injected intravenously with 50 μl of NTS for 3 consecutive days (NTS was a generous gift from Dr. Salant (Boston University)). NTS was generated by immunization of sheep with rat glomeruli as described previously (26Lloyd C.M. Minto A.W. Dorf M.E. Proudfoot A. Wells T.N. Salant D.J. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1371-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Control groups (n = 6 mice/group) were sacrificed 1, 3, and 6 weeks post-NTS injection to obtain representative kidney specimen corresponding to the time course of NTN. Treatment with 300 μg/kg BMP-7 was started at 3 weeks (n = 6 mice/group) postinduction of NTN. For in vivo studies, recombinant human BMP-7 homodimer, noncovalently attached to prodomain protein (referred to as soluble rhBMP-7) was used (Curis, Inc., Cambridge, MA) as described previously (9Zeisberg M. Hanai J. Sugimoto H. Mammoto T. Charytan D. Strutz F. Kalluri R. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 964-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). Treated mice were sacrificed 6 weeks postinduction of NTN, and kidneys and plasma were obtained for future analysis. Histologic Assessment of Renal Injury—Tissue of kidneys, liver, heart, spleen, and brain was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Masson's trichrome stain, and periodic acid-Schiff stain. Extent of renal injury was estimated by morphometric assessment of the tubulointerstitial injury and glomerular damage in a double-blinded manner. The relative interstitial volume was evaluated by morphometric analysis using a 10-mm2 graticule fitted into the microscope. The relative interstitial volume was defined as the cortical region outside tubules and glomeruli (27Bohle A. Christ H. Grund K.E. Mackensen S. Contrib. Nephrol. 1979; 16: 109-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Five randomly selected cortical areas, which included glomeruli, were evaluated for each animal (27Bohle A. Christ H. Grund K.E. Mackensen S. Contrib. Nephrol. 1979; 16: 109-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The relative interstitial volume was defined as the cortical region outside tubules and glomeruli. Immunocytochemistry—For immunocytochemistry, human renal fibroblasts (TK173) were seeded into 4-well chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) and stimulated according to the experimental protocol. At the end of incubation, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with ethanol/acetic acid (50:50, v/v) at -20 °C for 20 min (28Zeisberg M. Bonner G. Maeshima Y. Colorado P. Muller G.A. Strutz F. Kalluri R. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 1313-1321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The cells were subsequently washed again, blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween for 20 min at room temperature, and incubated for 2 h with primary monoclonal antibodies to E-cadherin (Transduction Laboratories). Cells were then washed again and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch). The stained cells were covered with Vectashield® mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and coverslips. The staining was visualized by fluorescence microscopy, and representative pictures were documented using Zeiss Axiovision Software. Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemical staining was performed as described previously (9Zeisberg M. Hanai J. Sugimoto H. Mammoto T. Charytan D. Strutz F. Kalluri R. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 964-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4-μm sections were obtained using a cryostat. Sections were fixed in 100% acetone at -20 °C for 10 min before the sections were incubated with primary antibodies to FSP1 and E-cadherin (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. Subsequently, the slides were washed three times in Tris-buffered saline and incubated with donkey-derived secondary antibodies conjugated with rhodamine or fluorescein isothiocyanate (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). After four washes with Tris-buffered saline, the slides were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and coverslipped. The staining was analyzed using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss). FSP1 antibody was a gift from Dr. Eric G. Neilson. Analysis of Mouse E-cadherin Promoter Fragment Activity in Epithelial Cells—For analysis of mouse E-cadherin promoter activity, a fragment containing the regulatory region of the E-cadherin promoter was ligated into the pXP2 luciferase vector (29Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-458PubMed Google Scholar). This truncated construct (-214 E-cadherin pXP2) displayed enhanced specificity for epithelial cells compared with the full-length promoter fragment, which exhibits activity in epithelial cells as well as in fibroblasts (30Behrens J.

This construct (-214Ecad/luc)was used to transfect TK173 adult renal fibroblasts, and stable clones were obtained. TK173 cells were co-transfected with 5 μg each of -214 E-cadherin pXP2 construct and pNeoβ-gal plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using a calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. Cells were tested for luciferase activity, staining with antibodies to luciferase (Promega, Madison, WI), and β-galactosidase activity was assessed by an o-nitrophenyl-β-galactopyranoside substrate-based assay kit (Stratagene). Single-cell-derived cell lines were established by limited dilution in selection medium that contained 1000 μg/ml G418 (31Strutz F. Zeisberg M. Ziyadeh F.N. Yang C.Q. Kalluri R. Muller G.A. Neilson E.G. Kidney Int. 2002; 61: 1714-1728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). A selection of cells that contained the -214 E-cadherin pXP2 construct was confirmed by staining with antibody to luciferase. Stable transfected TK173 cells were stimulated in IMDM that contained BMP-7 in a 6-well plate when they were 50–60% confluent for 24 h. Measurement of luciferase activity was performed using the Bright-Glo™ luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Migration Assay—Migration assays using a Boyden chamber were performed as described previously (32Zeisberg M. Maeshima Y. Mosterman B. Kalluri R. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 2001-2008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone-free polycarbonate membranes with 8-μm pores (Neuro Probes, Inc.) were coated with type I collagen on both sides (50 μg/ml). The bottom wells of chamber were filled with IMDM medium containing supplements according to the specific experimental protocol. Wells were covered with the coated membrane sheet, and 20,000-fibroblasts/well, which had been serum-starved for 24 h, were added into the upper chamber. The Boyden chamber was incubated for 6 h at 37 °C to allow possible migration of cells through the membrane into the lower chamber. Membranes were stained with Hema3® stain according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Biochemical Sciences, Inc., Swedesboro, NJ). Cells that migrated through the membrane were counted using a counting grid, which was fitted into an eyepiece of a phase-contrast microscope. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Under-agarose Cell Spreading Assay—Under-agarose cell motility assays were performed as described with modifications (33Hirschi K.K. Rohovsky S.A. D'Amore P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). 6-Well plates were coated with fibronectin for 1 h at 37 °C. 1-cm-thick agarose gels (2% low melt agarose in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) were cast into each well. After the gel had solidified, we punched a central hole (∼1 cm) surrounded by four additional holes (∼0.5 cm). Adult renal fibroblasts were stained with green (PKH67; Sigma) or red (PKH2626; Sigma) fluorescent dyes according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Equal uptake of the dyes was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy, before the cells were treated for 48 h with rhBMP-7 or maintained in serum-free IMDM control medium. 3000 cells/100 μl of serum-free medium were plated into the central cavity in the center of the gel, and the surrounding holes were each filled with 100 μl of medium containing 10% fetal calf serum to create a chemotactic gradient. Plates were incubated for 48 h in a cell culture incubator under standard conditions to allow the cells to migrate. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and the cells were visualized under a fluorescent microscope (Zeiss Axiovert). Cells that migrated from the central hole underneath the gel were counted using a fluorescent microscope. Statistical Analysis—All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. unless specified. Analysis of variance was used to determine statistical differences between groups using Sigma-Stat™ software (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). Further analysis was carried out using t test with Bonferroni correction to identify significant differences. A level of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. BMP-7 decreases the expression of type I collagen in adult renal fibroblasts (24Zeisberg M. Bottiglio C. Kumar N. Maeshima Y. Strutz F. Muller G.A. Kalluri R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F1060-F1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In experiments here, treatment of adult renal fibroblasts with BMP-7 at the optimum dose of 1000 ng/ml resulted in the formation of epithelial cell aggregates within the 90–100% confluent fibroblast monolayer (Fig. 1, B and D). Immunocytochemistry analysis of BMP-7-treated fibroblasts revealed that cells within the aggregated/condensed areas expressed abundant levels of the epithelial marker E-cadherin (Fig. 1F) and cytokeratin (data not shown) as compared with the untreated fibroblasts (Fig. 1E). E-cadherin staining was diffusely distributed within the cells as well as some distribution within the typical junctional regions, suggesting that the phenotype represents an early stage of MET. Several different studies have demonstrated that E-cadherin is an important determinant for maintenance of the epithelial phenotype (2Hay E.D. Acta Anat. 1995; 154: 8-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar, 34Vleminckx K. Vakaet Jr., L. Mareel M. Fiers W. van Roy F. Cell. 1991; 66: 107-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar). E-cadherin is an epithelial cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule, which by itself can induce MET if overexpressed in mesenchymal cells (35Vanderburg C.R. Hay E.D. Acta Anat. 1996; 157: 87-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Such studies have led to the speculation that E-cadherin is a potential epithelial master gene (2Hay E.D. Acta Anat. 1995; 154: 8-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). In order to further analyze the regulation of E-cadherin expression in adult renal fibroblasts, we performed stable transfections using a cDNA fragment of the mouse E-cadherin promoter (-214/+93) conjugated to the luciferase gene (lux), which contains all of the reported key regulatory elements for function in epithelial cells (Fig. 2A) (30Behrens J.

The -214/+93 mouse E-cadherin promoter construct (-214 E-cadherin pXP2) is active only in epithelial cells with minimal activity in fibroblasts, as compared with the full-length promoter, which displays robust activity in both epithelial cells and fibroblasts (30Behrens J.

In dose-response studies, rhBMP-7 induces E-cadherin promoter activity with maximal induction (5.3-fold) observed at 1000 ng/ml in TK173 fibroblast cells (Fig. 2B). Similar levels of induction (2-fold) of E-cadherin promoter activity, associated with epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity, has been reported previously (9Zeisberg M. Hanai J. Sugimoto H. Mammoto T.

https://openalex.org/W1983967734,"Chitin proteins are commonly found in bacteria that utilize chitin as a source of energy. CBP21 is a chitin-binding protein from Serratia marcescens, a Gram-negative soil bacterium capable of efficient chitin degradation. When grown on chitin, S. marcescens secretes large amounts of CBP21, along with chitin-degrading enzymes. In an attempt to understand the molecular mechanism of CBP21 action, we have determined its crystal structure at 1.55 Å resolution. This is the first structure to be solved of a family 33 carbohydrate-binding module. The structure reveals a “budded” fibronectin type III fold consisting of two β-sheets, arranged as a β-sheet sandwich, with a 65-residue “bud” consisting of three short helices, located between β-strands 1 and 2. Remarkably, conserved aromatic residues that have been suggested previously to play a role in chitin binding were mainly found in the interior of the protein, seemingly incapable of interacting with chitin, whereas the structure revealed a surface patch of highly conserved, mainly hydrophilic residues. The roles of six of these conserved surface-exposed residues (Tyr-54, Glu-55, Glu-60, His-114, Asp-182, and Asn-185) were probed by site-directed mutagenesis and subsequent binding studies. All single point mutations lowered the affinity of CBP21 for β-chitin, as shown by 3–8-fold increases in the apparent binding constant. Thus, binding of CBP21 to chitin seems to be mediated primarily by conserved, solvent-exposed, polar side chains.

Thus, binding of CBP21 to chitin seems to be mediated primarily by conserved, solvent-exposed, polar side chains. Chitin is a linear insoluble polymer of β(1–4)-linked N-acetylglucosamine, which is a common constituent of fungal cell walls, shells of crustaceans, and exoskeletons of insects. In nature, two major types of chitin occur that are characterized by an anti-parallel (α-chitin) or a parallel (β-chitin) arrangement of the polymer chains. Chitin binding is an important event in mechanisms varying from plant responses to chitin-containing pathogens to chitin degradation by microorganisms. Genes putatively encoding chitin-binding proteins or proteins containing chitin binding domains have been found in many organisms, ranging from bacteria to man with high diversity. In the classification of carbohydrate active enzymes ((1Henrissat B. Davies G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar) afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/), proteins and protein domains with chitin binding properties are classified into several families of carbohydrate-binding modules (families 1, 2, 12, 14, 18, 19, and 33) based on amino acid similarity. The majority of these modules are domains of larger enzymes, where they are thought to increase substrate affinity and enhance catalytic efficiency (2Hashimoto M. Ikegami T. Seino S. Ohuchi N.

Lett. 2004; 232: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), have shown that aromatic residues on the surfaces of these chitin binding domains are important for substrate affinity.In addition to appearing as discrete domains in enzymes, chitin-binding modules also exist as independent, noncatalytic, chitin-binding proteins (CBPs). 1The abbreviations used are: CBPs, chitin-binding proteins; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; FnIII, fibronectin type III.1The abbreviations used are: CBPs, chitin-binding proteins; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; FnIII, fibronectin type III. Such noncatalytic CBPs are found in families 14, 18, and 33, where families 14 and 18 constitute small anti-fungal proteins that share a structurally similar chitin-binding motif (7Suetake T. Tsuda S. Kawabata S. Miura K. Iwanaga S. Hikichi K. Nitta K. Kawano K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17929-17932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Family 33 CBPs are mainly found in bacteria and viruses and have so far not been structurally characterized at high resolution, although a low resolution solution x-ray scattering structure has been reported (8Svergun D.I. Becirevic A. Schrempf H. Koch M.H.J. Gruber G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10677-10683Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The ability to actually bind chitin has been established for only six CBPs in this family (9Folders J. Tommassen J. van Loon L.C. Bitter W. J.

Bacterial family 33 CBPs are expressed and secreted during chitin degradation and have been hypothesized to invade the chitin matrix and dissolve individual polymers, making them more accessible to degradation by chitinases (13Kolbe S. Fischer S. Becirevic A. Hinz P. Schrempf H. Microbiology (UK). 1998; 144: 1291-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Some CBPs in this family also appear as chitin binding domains in putative chitinases, but none of these multidomain enzymes have been characterized.The Gram-negative soil bacterium Serratia marcescens efficiently degrades chitin (15Monreal J. Reese E.T. Can. J. Microbiol. 1969; 15: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). When the bacterium is grown in the presence of chitin as a carbon source, CBP21 (197 amino acids, including a 27-residue leader peptide) is one of the major proteins produced and secreted, along with three chitinases and an N-acetylhexosaminidase (12Suzuki K. Suzuki M. Taiyoji M. Nikaidou N. Watanabe T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 16Watanabe T. Kimura K. Sumiya T. Nikaidou M. Suzuki K. Suzuki M. Taiyoji M. Ferrer S. Regue M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7111-7117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gene for CBP21 is located 1.5 kb downstream of one of the chitinase genes (chiB), but the two genes are not in the same operon (12Suzuki K. Suzuki M. Taiyoji M. Nikaidou N. Watanabe T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 17Suzuki K. Uchiyama T. Suzuki M. Nikaidou N. Regue M. Watanabe T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2001; 65: 338-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Several detailed structural and functional studies have recently described the roles of the chitinolytic enzymes (18van Aalten D.M.F. Komander D. Synstad B. Gåseidnes S. Peter M.G. Eijsink V.G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8979-8984Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 19Suzuki K. Sugawara N. Suzuki M. Uchiyama T. Katouno F. Nikaidou N. Watanabe T. Biosci. Biotechnol.

Biochem. 2004; 271: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar); however, not much is known about CBP21. A study by Suzuki et al. (12Suzuki K. Suzuki M. Taiyoji M. Nikaidou N. Watanabe T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) has revealed that CBP21 has a specific preference for binding β-chitin and that affinity is strongly pH-dependent.To obtain more insight into the properties of CBP21, we have determined its crystal structure at 1.55 Å resolution. The structure is the first of a family 33 carbohydrate-binding module to be solved and reveals a compact fibronectin III-type fold plus a 65-residue loop/helical pseudo-domain. Most surprisingly, only one of several conserved aromatic residues in CBPs was found to be located on the protein surface. In order to identify functionally important residues, the result of a sequence alignment of bacterial CBPs was combined with the structural data to reveal conserved, surface-exposed residues. The contribution of six of these residues to chitin binding was assessed by studying the effect of mutating them to alanine. Because CPB21 crystallized as a dimer, several experiments were done to detect dimeric forms in solution, and several amino acids in/near the putative dimer interface were mutated, and the effects on chitin binding were examined.MATERIALS AND METHODSGene Cloning and Sequencing—The gene encoding CBP21 was subcloned from plasmid pLES3, which contains a 9.2-kb fragment from the genome of S. marcescens BJL200 (21Brurberg M.B. Eijsink V.G.H. Haandrikman A.J. Venema G. Nes I.F. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and cloned into the pRSETB expression vector (Invitrogen). The gene sequence was determined using the Applied Biosystems BigDye Terminator version 3.1 kit and an automated ABI Prism sequencing apparatus. The sequencing reaction was set up according to the supplier's instructions. The sequence has been submitted to the GenBank™ (accession number AY665558).CBP21 mutants Y54A, E55A, E60A, H114A, Y147A, A152R, Q161A, N163R, D182A, and N185A were made using the Quickchange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), according to the instructions provided by the supplier. All mutants had retained considerable affinity for chitin under the chromatographic conditions used for purifying the wild type protein and could thus be purified by using the standard procedure described below.Protein Expression and Purification—The pRSETB vector containing the cbp21 gene was transformed into BL21(DE3) Star cells (Invitrogen), and the protein was expressed by growing the cells in Luria-Bertani broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin for 16 h at 37 °C. Cells were fractionated using the cold osmotic shock method described by Manoil and Beckwith (22Manoil C. Beckwith J. Science. 1986; 233: 1403-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), and the periplasmic fraction was used as starting sample for further work. CBP21 was purified using chitin affinity chromatography. 25 ml of periplasmic extract was adjusted to 1 m NH4(SO3)2 and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (running buffer), before being applied on a 1.5 × 10-cm (18 ml) chitin bead column (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) equilibrated with running buffer. After application of the sample, the column was washed with 2 volumes of running buffer. CBP21 was eluted from the column by changing the running buffer to 20 mm acetic acid, pH 3.6. The flow rate was 2.5 ml/min throughout the experiment. Fractions containing pure CBP21 (assessed by SDS-PAGE) were collected and concentrated using Centricon Plus-20 ultrafiltration tubes (Millipore, Billerica, MA) to concentrations in the 20–150 mg/ml range. The concentrated protein was dialyzed in a Slide-A-Lyzer (Pierce) cassette against 500 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 24 h at 4 °C with three buffer changes. Protein samples were stored at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Microassay according to the instructions from the supplier (Bio-Rad).Protein Crystallization—The protein sample was diluted to 20 mg/ml and used in sitting drop vapor diffusion crystallization experiments. Crystals for wild type CBP21 were obtained in several conditions of which 35% (w/v) PEG 3000 and 0.5 m CHES buffer, pH 9.5 (condition a), and 1.26 m ammonium sulfate and 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5 (condition b), resulted in the best diffracting crystals. A heavy atom derivative was obtained by soaking a crystal obtained from crystallization condition a for 2 days in a 5 mm solution of sodium perrhenate. The Y54A mutant (at 17.5 mg/ml) was crystallized using a similar approach but from 20% (w/v) PEG-8000, 100 mm CAPS, 200 mm NaCl, and cryoprotected with 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol.Structure Determination—Data sets for native and derivative crystals were collected on beamline ID23-1 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France. To remove excess sodium perrhenate, the derivative crystal was soaked in 40% (w/v) PEG 3000 and 0.5 m CHES buffer, pH 9.5. Crystals were flash frozen at 100 K in a nitrogen cryostream. A data set from a native crystal and a complete single anomalous dispersion data set from the rhenium derivative crystal were collected at 1.55 and 1.75 Å, respectively. Data were processed with the HKL suite (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar) (Table I). From the native data set, a Matthews coefficient of 2.19 Å3/dalton was obtained assuming two molecules in the asymmetric unit and a space group of P3221. The single heavy atom site was found and refined with SOLVE (24Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar), yielding phases to 1.85 Å resolution with an overall figure of merit of 0.29 (see Table I). Combination of the SAD phases with the 1.55 Å native amplitudes and solvent flattening using DM (25Cowtan K. Jt. CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsl. on Protein Crystallogr. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar) resulted in an interpretable map. WarpNtrace (26Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar) was used to build an initial model of 137 residues out of a possible total of 350. LSQKAB (27CCP Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Residues that were successfully built into one monomer were fitted to the other monomer by using LSQKAB resulting in two chains of 162 residues and a total of 324 residues out of 350.

Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Refinement, using the same procedures as describe above, was initiated using the native structure as a starting model and resulted in a final model as described in Table I.Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were recorded with a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco International Co., Ltd., Tokyo Japan) calibrated with ammonium d-camphor-10-sulfonate (Icatayama Chemicals, Tokyo Japan). Measurements were performed at 23 °C, using a quartz cuvette (Starna, Essex, UK) with a path length of 0.1 cm. All measurements were performed with a protein concentration of 0.10 mg/ml in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Samples were scanned five times at 50 nm/min with a bandwidth of 1 nm and a response time of 0.5 s. The data were averaged, and the spectrum of a sample-free control sample was subtracted. All measurements were conducted at least twice.Binding Assays—Binding studies were performed using α-chitin from shrimp shells (Hov Bio, Tromsø, Norway), β-chitin from squid bone (<80 mesh-sized particles, France Chitin, Marseille, France), or crystalline cellulose (Avicel; Sigma) as substrates. The (insoluble) substrates were suspended in double distilled H2O to yield 20 mg/ml stock suspensions that were continuously stirred with a magnetic stirrer in order to obtain consistent amounts when pipetting. In initial binding experiments, reaction mixtures (500 μl) contained 1 mg/ml substrate and 100 μg/ml protein in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The reaction mixture was rotated vertically at 60 rpm at room temperature. At time points (5, 15, 45, 90, 180, 240, and 480 min), the substrate was spun down in a microcentrifuge for 3 min at 13,000 rpm, and reduction of protein in the supernatant was determined by measuring absorption at 280 nm (A280, Eppendorf Biophotometer, Eppendorf, Hamburg). Binding studies with α-chitin and cellulose were performed with CBP21 wild type only, as these substrates showed little affinity for CBP21.The CBP21 variants showing reduced binding to β-chitin were analyzed further by using a second binding assay meant to estimate equilibrium binding constants (Kd) and binding capacities (Bmax). For the binding assays, a CBP21 solution with known protein concentration (Bradford method; see above) was diluted to various concentrations in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Before adding chitin (from a concentrated stock suspension in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0), the A280 of the prepared solutions was measured, thus creating individual standard curves for each CBP21 variant. Subsequently, chitin was added, bringing the reaction volume to 1 ml, the β-chitin concentration to 0.5 mg/ml, and the CBP21 concentration to 10, 20, 50, 100, 150, 200, or 300 μg/ml CBP21. After addition of β-chitin, the solutions were mixed by vertical rotation (60 rpm) at room temperature for 16 h. Subsequently, the sample tubes were spun for 3 min at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge to pellet the chitin, and the A280 values of the supernatants were measured. Apparent extinction coefficients calculated from the respective A280 standard curves were subsequently used to convert A280 values to protein concentrations. If a value lower than 20 μg/ml was estimated by measuring A280, the protein concentration was re-determined using the Bio-Rad protein microassay. All assays were performed in triplicate and with blanks (buffer + 0.5 mg/ml β-chitin) and controls to correct for aspecific binding of the protein (buffer + CBP21 variants). The equilibrium dissociation constants, Kd (μm), and substrate binding capacities, Bmax (μmol/g), were determined by fitting the binding isotherms to the one-site binding equation where P stands for protein: [Pbound] = Bmax [Pfree]/Kd + [Pfree], by nonlinear regression using the GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOverall Structure of CBP21—The cbp21 gene was cloned, overexpressed in E. coli, and purified to homogeneity by chitin affinity chromatography. The protein was crystallized, and the structure was solved by a rhenium single-wavelength anomalous dispersion experiment (Table I). The native structure of CBP21 was refined to 1.55 Å resolution with R-factors converging to R = 0.156, Rfree = 0.175 (Table I). The asymmetric unit contains three molecules with similar conformation and secondary structure (average pairwise r.m.s.d. on C-α atoms is 0.3 Å). Ramachandran plots created by PROCHECK (30Laskowski R.A. McArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) showed that all residues had dihedral angles within allowed regions, apart from one residue in the A monomer that was positioned in the generously allowed area. The B monomer was used for structure analysis and is shown in the figures.The structure consists of a three-stranded and a four-stranded β-sheet that form a β-sandwich (Fig. 1). There is a bud-like 65-residue pseudo-domain between β-strands one and two, which consists of loops, one short α-helix, and two short 310 helices (Figs. 1 and 2). The four cysteine residues of CBP21 appear as two disulfide bridges, one in the loop/helical region (Cys-41 and Cys-49) and one joining β-strands 4 and 5 (Cys-145 and Cys-162) (Fig. 1A). The core of CBP21 consists of several conserved aromatic amino acids, such as Trp-94, Trp-108, Trp-119, Tyr-121, Trp-128, Trp-178, Phe-187, and Tyr-188 (Figs. 1A and 2). The structure represents the first high resolution data for the CBM-33 family, although a low resolution solution scattering envelope for a Streptomyces chitin-binding protein (CHB1) has been reported previously (8Svergun D.I. Becirevic A. Schrempf H. Koch M.H.J. Gruber G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10677-10683Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The structure of this protein, which is 46% identical at the sequence level with CBP21 (Fig. 2), was described as an elongated globule with a distinct bud-like extension. This is in agreement with the CBP21 structure, where the elongated globule would correspond with the β-sandwich, and the bud-like extension with the 65-residue pseudo-domain between β1 and β2.Fig. 2Multiple alignment of bacterial CBPs (Q8GBD4, Yersinia enterocolitica; Q8ES33, Oceanobacillus iheyensis; Q8EHY2, Shewanella oneidensis; Q87FT0, Vibrio parahemeolyticus; Q838S1, Enterococcus feacalis; Q88WE3, Lactobacillus plantarum; Q7N4I5, Photorhabdus luminescens (subsp. laumondii); Q9CE94, Lactococcus lactis (subsp. lactis); Q9F9Q5*, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens; Q8Y4H4, Listeria monocytogenes; Q54501*, Streptomyces olivaceoviridis (CHB1); O83009*, Serratia marcescens (CBP21)).

Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3552) Google Scholar) revealed that the CBP21 fold shares structural similarity with a number of proteins (140 matches with Z-score greater than 2.0). The most similar structures all possess a fibronectin type III (FnIII) domain, which is a common fold appearing in a variety of eukaryotic proteins. In bacteria, FnIII domains have so far only been found among carbohydrate active enzymes (32Jee J.G. Ikegami T. Hashimoto M. Kawabata T. Ikeguchi M. Watanabe T. Shirakawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1388-1397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Most strikingly, the closest structural match is with the FnIII-like chitin binding domain of chitinase A (ChiA) from S. marcescens (3Perrakis A. Tews I. Dauter Z. Oppenheim A.B. Chet I. Wilson K.S. Vorgias C.E. Structure (Lond.). 1994; 2: 1169-1180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), with an r.m.s.d. of 2.5 Å on 85 structurally matched C-α atoms (Fig. 1B). The topology of the β-sandwiches of CBP21 and ChiA-FnIII is similar, but ChiA-FnIII lacks the bud-like extension of CBP21 (Fig. 1B). Indeed, it appears that this budded variant of the FnIII fold is not found in other FnIII-containing structures identified in the DALI search. Sequence alignments suggest that the bud is conserved in the CBM-33 family and carries several completely conserved residues (Fig. 2). Most surprisingly, the exposed aromatic amino acids that are known to be responsible for chitin binding in the ChiA-FnIII domain (5Uchiyama T. Katouno F. Nikaidou N. Nonaka T. Sugiyama J. Watanabe T.

The endothelial cell differentiation gene receptors are G-protein coupled receptors that, upon stimulation, propagate second messenger signals via activation of heterotrimeric G-protein α subunits and β-γ dimers. Ultimately, this S1P-driven signaling results in cell survival, increased cell migration, and, often, mitogenesis. The recent development of agonists targeting S1P receptors has provided insight regarding the role of this signaling system in physiologic homeostasis. For example, the immunomodulator FTY720 (2-amino-2-[2-(4-octylphenyl)ethyl]propane-1,3-diol), which is a pan S1P receptor agonist following phosphorylation, revealed that S1P tone influences lymphocyte trafficking (1Brinkmann V.

The utility of an S1P receptor agonist was unexpected; indeed, prior speculation focused on the potential (as yet unrealized) for S1P antagonists as anti-angiogenic agents. Recent findings also suggest a physiological influence for S1P in the vasculature. Although not yet explored in detail, it has been hypothesized that S1P may exert anti-inflammatory actions on endothelial cells through its release from high density lipoprotein (5Kimura T. Sato K. Malchinkhuu E. Tomura H. Tamama K. Kuwabara A. Murakami M. Okajima F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1283-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). A recent study found that S1P inhibited tumor necrosis factor α-mediated monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion. 2Lynn Hedrick, personal communication. Furthermore, an S1P1 receptor antagonist described herein blocked the anti-inflammatory action of S1P, thereby providing evidence that this effect maps to the S1P1 receptor. If verified, these results would expand the role of the S1P1 receptor to include influencing monocyte extravasation and would further highlight how the development of S1P receptor-specific compounds is expanding our understanding of the biology of this important signaling system. To further characterize the biology associated with individual S1P receptors, we have undertaken a program to develop S1P analogs with the twin goals of expanding the structure-activity relationships associated with S1P receptor interactions and identifying receptor-specific compounds. Our studies have led to the identification of a series of S1P analogs that behave as antagonists at two of the five S1P receptors.

Syntheses of VPC23019, VPC23031, VPC25239, and VPC23089— The synthetic route to the meta-substituted compounds VPC23031, VPC25239, and VPC23019 was initiated with a Sonogashira coupling (6Jones L. Schumm J.S. Tour J.M. J. Org. Chem. 1997; 62: 1388-1410Crossref Scopus (268) Google Scholar) of 3-iodo-1-nitrobenzene with the appropriate terminal alkyne. The resulting adducts were then subjected to simultaneous hydrogenation of the nitro group and the triple bond to generate the meta-substituted anilines. The anilines were next coupled to a protected serine, and the ensuing amides underwent hydrogenolysis to afford the free alcohols. The alcohols were subsequently phosphorylated, oxidized with hydrogen peroxide, and then subjected to acid-catalyzed global deprotection to provide the final products, VPC23031, VPC25239, and VPC23019. Synthesis of the ortho-substituted compound, VPC23089, commenced with the union of 2-iodoaniline and 1-octyne via a Sonogashira coupling. The ensuing aniline was then coupled to a protected serine utilizing the benzotriazol-1-yl-oxytripyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate reagent. The resulting amide was then subjected to a hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis step to remove the benzyl ether-protecting group and simultaneously reduce the aryl triple bond. The liberated alcohol was next phosphorylated, oxidized with hydrogen peroxide, and then subjected to acid-catalyzed global deprotection to provide the final product, VPC23089. NMR and mass spectrometry were used to confirm all structures. VPC23019 will be available from Avanti Polar Lipids.

After about 60 h, cells were harvested, and membranes were prepared, aliquoted, and stored at –70 °C until use (8Im D.S. Heise C.E. Ancellin N. O'Dowd B.F. Shei G.J. Heavens R.P. Rigby M.R. Hla T.

Transfection of receptor and G-protein was confirmed with the γ-35S-GTP binding assay (described below), as analysis of HEK293T cells transfected with G-proteins alone did not respond to agonist stimulation (see Fig. 2A, inset). Stable Expression in T24 Cells—T24 cell monolayers were cotransfected with the human S1P1, S1P2, and S1P3 receptor-encoding DNAs and the pIRESpuro2 plasmid DNA (Clontech, San Jose, CA) using either Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Clonal populations expressing the puromycin acetyltransferase gene were selected by addition of puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) to the culture medium. T24 cells were grown in monolayers at 37 °C in a 5% CO2/95% air atmosphere in growth medium consisting of 95% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium and 10% charcoal/dextran-stripped FBS. γ-35S-GTP Binding Assay—The γ-35S-GTP binding assay was performed as described previously (8Im D.S.

Membranes containing 0.001–0.005 mg of protein were incubated in 0.1 ml of binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5) containing 0.005 mg of saponin, 0.10 mm GDP, 0.1 nm γ-35S-GTP (1200 Ci/mmol), and the indicated lipid(s) for 30 min at 30 °C and collected using a Brandel Cell Harvester (Gaithersburg, MD). Samples were then analyzed for bound radionuclide. Cell Migration Assay—Cell migration assays were performed using modified Boyden chambers (tissue culture-treated with a 24-mm diameter, a 0.010-mm thickness, and 0.008-mm pores, Transwell®, Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) containing polycarbonate membranes that were coated on the underside with 0.1% gelatin. The underside of the polycarbonate membranes was rinsed once with migration medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 without Phenol Red and 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA) and then immersed in the lower chamber containing 2 ml of migration medium. T24 cells transfected stably with human S1P1 receptor DNA were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium containing charcoal/dextran-stripped FBS and 0.010 mg/ml puromycin to 100% confluence in 150 × 25-mm tissue culture plates and serum starved for at least 12 h. Serum-starved cells were removed from culture dishes with 10× trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen), washed once with migration medium, and resuspended in migration medium (106 cells/ml). One milliliter of the cell suspension was added to the upper migration chamber while the S1P agonist VPC22277 (10 nm) was added to the lower chamber. Cells were allowed to migrate to the underside of the membrane for 4 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of antagonist (VPC23019 (0–1000 nm), VPC23019, VPC23031, VPC23089, and VPC25239 (50 nm each)), which were added to the lower chamber. The migrated cells attached to the bottom surface of the membrane were removed with 10× trypsin-EDTA, their mass was determined by combining 0.1 ml of cell suspension with an equal volume of CyQuant dye solution (3.0 ml of 2× lysis buffer and 0.015 ml of CyQuant dye), and the resulting fluorescence was quantified using the FlexStation™ fluorimeter (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). Each determination represents the average of two individual migration chambers. For determination of the reversibility of the antagonism associated with VPC23019, cells were incubated with 0.01 mm VPC23019 at 37 °C for 30 min. The monolayer was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and processed immediately for the cell migration assay, as described above. Measurement of Intracellular Calcium Mobilization—A FlexStation™ fluorimeter was used to measure intracellular calcium in native T24 cells and T24 cells stably transfected with either human S1P2 or human S1P3 receptor DNA. Cells were seeded (∼50,000 cells/well) in 96-well, clear bottom black microplates (Corning Costar Corp.) and left overnight at 37 °C. The cells were dye-loaded with 0.004 mm Fluo-4AM ester in a loading buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution, pH 6.4, containing 20 mm HEPES, 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA, and 2.5 mm probenecid) for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing cell monolayers three times with phosphate-buffered saline, loading buffer was added, and the cells were exposed to sets of compounds for 3 min at 25 °C in the FlexStation™.In all cases, each concentration of every compound was tested at least in triplicate. For determination of the reversibility of the antagonism associated with VPC23019 (0.010 mm), the compound was added in combination with loading dye to the cells and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and exposed to compounds immediately, as described above. Determination of the Binding Constant for VPC23019 at the S1P1 and S1P3 Receptors—The binding constant (Kb) for VPC23019 at the S1P1 and S1P3 receptors was determined by Schild analyses from curves that were fitted using the nonlinear regression method discussed by Lew and Angus (9Lew M.J. Angus J.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 328-337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Briefly, nonlinear analysis of the best fit line generated by plotting the negative log of the EC50 values obtained from agonist dose-response curves, in the absence and presence of varying concentrations of antagonist, was plotted against the concentration of antagonist to give the Kb value. An F-test analysis was also performed to establish whether the antagonist did or did not meet the criteria of a simple competitive interaction. S1P Radiolabeling—[32P]S1P was prepared by incubating sphingosine and [γ-32P]ATP with cell lysate from HEK293T cells transfected transiently with human sphingosine kinase type 2 DNA. The 0.2-ml reaction contained 0.025 mm sphingosine, 1 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP (7000 Ci/mmol), and kinase buffer (10 mm Mg(C2H3O2)2 in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaF, and 2 mm semicarbizide). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.02 mg of cell lysate protein and incubated at 37 °C for at least 30 min. The [32P]S1P was extracted by the addition of 1 n HCl and 2.0 m each KCl, methanol, and chloroform to the reaction mixture. The mixture was then vortexed and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5–10 min. The organic layer was isolated, and the extraction procedure was repeated two additional times with the remaining aqueous fraction. The combined organic fractions were dried under a stream of nitrogen gas and resuspended in aqueous 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA. The specific activity of the product, [32P]S1P, is estimated to be that of the radiolabeled substrate, [γ-32P]ATP, i.e. 7000 Ci/mmol. [32P]S1P Binding Assay—Membranes containing 0.005 mg of protein from HEK293T cells transfected transiently with both receptor and G-protein DNAs were incubated in 0.5 ml of binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5), 50 pm [32P]S1P, and the indicated lipid(s) for 1 h at room temperature. Bound ligand was separated from free ligand by rapid filtration and analyzed in a liquid scintillation counter. Nonspecific binding was determined as residual binding of radioligand in the presence of excess S1P to membranes, both heat-denatured and non-heat-denatured, from HEK293T cells transfected transiently with receptor and G-protein DNAs; it was typically 60% of total binding. The binding constant (Ki) associated with the ligand-receptor interaction was determined from the IC50 using the Chang-Prusoff equation (Ki = IC50/(1 + [L]/Kd). In applying this equation, the concentration of radioligand (L) is 0.05 nm and the Kd value used was that reported for the S1P-S1P1 receptor interaction, i.e. 8.1 nm (10Lee M.J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—The EC50 and IC50 values for all dose response curves were determined by nonlinear regression analysis of all data using the Graphpad Prism program. The error associated with the data collected is reported as the standard error of the mean (S.E.). VPC23019 Is Devoid of Agonism at the S1P1 and S1P3 Receptors—In the course of our examinations of S1P analog structure-activity relationship, we discovered that the aryl-amide compound VPC23019 (Fig. 1) lacked agonist activity at the S1P1 (Fig. 2A) and S1P3 (Fig. 2B) receptors in a broken cell γ-35S-GTP binding assay. Indeed, a profile suggesting inverse agonism was observed at VPC23019 concentrations greater than 100 nm in this assay; however, the alternate explanation, such as a neutral antagonist blocking an endogenous agonist in our preparation, cannot be discounted from present data. The lack of agonist activity was confirmed in whole cell assays using T24 cells (derived from bladder carcinoma) in which either the S1P1 (T24-S1P1) or S1P3 (T24-S1P3) receptor was expressed stably. Reverse transciptase-PCR analysis detected only S1P2 receptor mRNA endogenously in T24 cells; however, although the efficacy of the response was the same, S1P was at least 100-fold more potent when recombinant S1P1, S1P2 (data not shown), or S1P3 (Fig. 2D) receptors were expressed stably. Thus, the T24 cell system provides an opportunity to interrogate individual S1P receptors introduced by transfection. Numerous studies have demonstrated that S1P can promote cell migration; however, it was shown recently that S1P can also inhibit migration, possibly through stimulation of the S1P2 receptor (11Clair T. Aoki J. Koh E. Bandle R.W. Nam S.W. Ptaszynska M.M. Mills G.B. Schiffmann E. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5446-5453PubMed Google Scholar). To circumvent this inhibitory effect, we used VPC22277 (Fig. 1), an S1P analog that is an agonist at the S1P1 and S1P3 receptors, but not the S1P2 receptor (Table I). (All of the compounds in the aryl amide series (12Clemens J.J. Davis M.D. Lynch K.R. Macdonald T.L. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2003; 13: 3401-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) are devoid of detectable activity at the S1P2 receptor.) We found that migration of T24-S1P1 cells could be induced by VPC22277, whereas no migration was evoked in response to VPC23019 (Fig. 2C). Similarly, in whole cell calcium mobilization studies using T24-S1P3 cells, dose-dependent calcium mobilization was observed with S1P (Fig. 2D). Thus, VPC23019 is devoid of agonist activity at the S1P1 and S1P3 receptors using both broken cell and whole cell assays.Table IAgonist activity at the S1P receptorsCompoundLongest alkyl chainRing substitutionsEnantiomerpEC50 valuesS1P1S1P2S1P3S1P4S1P5S1P18S8.39 ± 0.168.62 ± 0.108.65 ± 0.116.81 ± 0.148.63 ± 0.06VPC2227710paraS8.80 ± 0.06<57.13 ± 0.11 (PA)7.05 ± 0.22 (PA)7.96 ± 0.10VPC230198metaRNA<5NA6.58 ± 0.087.07 ± 0.12 (PA)VPC252397metaRNA<5NA6.78 ± 0.097.94 ± 0.09 (PA)VPC230316metaRNA<5NA5.96 ± 0.066.87 ± 0.16 (WPA)VPC230898orthoRNA<5NA6.07 ± 0.21<5VPC230799metaR6.17 ± 0.24<5NA5.93 ± 0.08NAVPC2306910metaR7.09 ± 0.16<55.72 ± 0.28 (WPA)6.07 ± 0.07<5VPC250278metaS8.65 ± 0.16 (PA)NANA6.05 ± 0.047.20 ± 0.08 (PA) Open table in a new tab VPC23019 Blocks Agonist Activity at the S1P1 and S1P3 Receptors—The finding that VPC23019 exhibited possible inverse agonist activity at the S1P1 or S1P3 receptors prompted us to investigate whether this compound blocked agonist activity. Using the γ-35S-GTP binding assay, we found that S1P concentration effect curves generated in the presence of VPC23019 at either the S1P1 (Fig. 3A) or S1P3 (Fig. 3B) receptors produced a concentration-dependent, parallel rightward shift in the curves. This shift in agonist-mediated responses was also observed in two whole cell assays, cell migration (Fig. 3C) and calcium mobilization (data not shown). VPC23019 neither exhibited agonist activity at the LPA1–3 endothelial cell differentiation gene family receptors at concentrations up to 0.03 mm nor blocked the action at these sites (data not shown). VPC23019 S1P Receptor Affinity—Schild analyses of the antagonist activity associated with VPC23019 in the γ-35S-GTP binding assay gave pKb values at the S1P1 (Fig. 3A) and S1P3 (Fig. 3B) receptors of 7.49 ± 0.15 and 5.98 ± 0.08, respectively. Additionally, the nonlinear regression method of Lew and Angus (9Lew M.J. Angus J.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 328-337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), which predicts whether a compound behaves as a competitive antagonist, suggested that VPC23019 behaves as a competitive antagonist at both receptors. Schild analysis of calcium mobilization in T24-S1P3 cells gave a Kb value for VPC23019 that was ∼10-fold less than that observed in the γ-35S-GTP binding assay. However, the nonlinear regression analysis indicated that VPC23019 did not behave as a competitive antagonist in the calcium mobilization assay with T24-S1P3 cells. Importantly, both whole cell S1P receptor assays (Ca2+ mobilization (Fig. 3D, S1P3) and cell migration (S1P1, not shown)) recovered fully after washing out the antagonist. Thus, the antagonist activity exhibited by VPC23019 is reversible as well as fully surmountable, which are essential criteria for a competitive antagonist. To measure the affinity of VPC23019 for the S1P1 and S1P3 receptors directly, we examined the ligand-receptor interaction associated with the S1P1 and S1P3 receptors via a receptor binding assay using [32P]S1P in competition with S1P and VPC23019. Analysis of S1P in the radioligand binding assay (Fig. 4A) yielded pKi values of 8.96 ± 0.14 and 8.12 ± 0.06 at the S1P1 and S1P3 receptors, respectively. These values are in agreement with the published pKd values for radiolabeled S1P binding to these receptors (10Lee M.J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T.

The radioligand binding assay also revealed an excellent correlation between the pKi and the pKb for VPC23019 generated from the Schild analysis at both the S1P1 and S1P3 receptors, i.e. pKii values of 7.86 ± 0.16 and 5.93 ± 0.19, respectively (Fig. 4B and Table II). Finally, VPC23019 was also found to be devoid of agonist activity at the S1P2 receptor, and radioligand binding studies with the S1P2 receptor revealed that VPC23019 did not influence the binding of [32P]S1P to the S1P2 receptor at concentrations up to 0.010 mm (data not shown).Table IIAntagonist affinity at the S1P1 and S1P3 receptorsCompoundLongest alkyl chainRing substitutionspKipKbS1P1S1P3S1P1S1P3VPC230198meta7.86 ± 0.165.93 ± 0.197.49 ± 0.165.98 ± 0.08VPC252397meta7.87 ± 0.047.01 ± 0.146.25 ± 0.23aBased on Schild analysis, the antagonism observed is not competitive.5.85 ± 0.10aBased on Schild analysis, the antagonism observed is not competitive.VPC230316meta7.21 ± 0.072.56 ± 13.46.87 ± 0.154.98 ± 0.62aBased on Schild analysis, the antagonism observed is not competitive.VPC230898ortho6.05 ± 0.165.80 ± 0.166.31 ± 0.236.36 ± 0.67aBased on Schild analysis, the antagonism observed is not competitive.a Based on Schild analysis, the antagonism observed is not competitive. Open table in a new tab Changes in Analog Structure Alter Activity at the S1P1 and S1P3 Receptors—Previous studies with para-substituted aryl amide compounds (VPC23019 is meta-substituted, Fig. 1) revealed that they are agonists at all of the S1P receptors, except at the S1P2 receptor, where they are inactive (12Clemens J.J. Davis M.D. Lynch K.R. Macdonald T.L. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2003; 13: 3401-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Furthermore, different potencies and efficacies were observed with changes in either the length of the longest alkyl chain or the spatial configuration about the amino carbon (12Clemens J.J. Davis M.D. Lynch K.R. Macdonald T.L. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2003; 13: 3401-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is reasonable, therefore, to expect that such changes would also influence antagonist activity. Thus, we synthesized several structural analogs of VPC23019 and tested the effect on potency at either the S1P1 or S1P3 receptor. If the primary amine of VPC23019 is placed in the opposite spatial configuration (VPC25027), the compound is at least 1 log order less potent than VPC23019 as an antagonist at the S1P1 and S1P3 receptors (data not shown). Extension of the alkyl chain located at the third phenyl carbon (meta to the amide) beyond eight carbon atoms resulted in a switch from antagonist to agonist activity at both the S1P1 and S1P3 receptors (Table I). Conversely, shortening of the alkyl chain by one (VPC25239) or two (VPC23031) carbon atoms or moving it to the second phenyl carbon (ortho-VPC23089) resulted in an antagonist profile similar to that observed previously with VPC23019 at both the S1P1 and S1P3 receptors (data not shown). Furthermore, these analogs blocked agonist-mediated migration (Fig. 5A) and calcium mobilization (Fig. 5B) in T24 cells stably expressing either the S1P1 or S1P3 receptor, respectively. None of these synthetic maneuvers resulted in an antagonist with improved potency except for VPC25239 (Table II), which was equal in potency to the lead compound at the S1P1 receptor but about 1 log order more potent at the S1P3 receptor (Table II). Thus, VPC25239 is an equipotent S1P1/S1P3 receptor antagonist, whereas the other antagonists in the series are more potent at the S1P1 receptor. The affinity of VPC23031 observed at the S1P3 receptor (Table II) does not appear to correlate with the ability of the compound to effectively shift the agonist-mediated activation of the receptor (Fig. 5B). The reason for this disconnect is unclear to us presently. As observed previously with VPC23019, all of the compounds in this series behaved as agonists at the S1P4 and S1P5 receptors, and no agonist activity was observed with the S1P2 receptor (Table I). Finally, modification of the phosphate head group of VPC23019 (e.g. phosphonate) resulted in compounds with an agonist and antagonist activity profile similar to that observed with VPC23019. 3M. D. Davis, F. W. Foss, T. L. Macdonald, and K. R. Lynch, unpublished data. Understanding of the physiological role of the S1P receptors has been greatly enhanced by using sphingosine- and S1P-related analogs.

Furthermore, studies performed with the S1P1 receptor-selective agonist SEW2871 (5-(4-phenyl-5-trifluoromethylthiophen-2-yl)-3-(3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-(1,2,4)oxadiazole) suggest that lymphopenia, which is an index of FTY720 action, is a result of activation of the S1P1 receptor (4Sanna M.G. Liao J. Jo E. Alfonso C. Ahn M.Y. Peterson M.S. Webb B. Lefebvre S. Chun J. Gray N. Rosen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13839-13848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Furthermore, lymphocyte egress from thymus and peripheral lymphatic tissues is dependent on the S1P1 receptor (3Matloubian M. Lo C.G. Cinamon G. Lesneski M.J. Xu Y. Brinkmann V. Allende M.L.

Hale J. Keohane C. Meyers C. Milligan J. Mills S. Nomura N. Rosen H. Rosenbach M. Shei G.J. Singer II, Tian M. West S. White V. Xie J. Proia R.L. Mandala S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 309: 758-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). These studies highlight the potential associated with the further characterization of related molecular entities. We have characterized the activity of a series of S1P analogs that are antagonists at two of the five S1P receptors. Our results show that two of these analogs, VPC23019 and VPC25239, are reasonably potent at the S1P1 receptor (i.e. Ki ≤ 50 nm), and VPC25239 is also potent (Ki ≤ 100 nm) at the S1P3 receptor. By comparison, the Kd value for the S1P-S1P1 receptor interaction is reported to be 8.1 nm (10Lee M.J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Our previous results with para-substituted aryl amide analogs demonstrate that these are uniform S1P receptor agonists (12Clemens J.J. Davis M.D. Lynch K.R. Macdonald T.L. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2003; 13: 3401-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The antagonist activity observed with the compounds presented here resulted from minor changes in the aryl amide structures. Given our earlier observations, it was counterintuitive that antagonists would be realized by 1) positioning of the primary amine in a configuration opposite that of naturally occurring sphingosine and S1P, 2) placing the phenyl substituents in a 1,3 (meta) configuration, and 3) limiting the alkyl chain to no more than eight carbon atoms. In view of our present findings, it is possible that one of the enantiomers of the meta-substituted analog of FTY720 described by Kiuchi et al. (15Kiuchi M. Adachi K. Kohara T. Minoguchi M. Hanano T. Aoki Y. Mishina T. Arita M. Nakao N. Ohtsuki M. Hoshino Y. Teshima K. Chiba K. Sasaki S. Fujita T. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 2946-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) is an antagonist (following phosphorylation) for one or more S1P receptors; however, the whole animal assays used to evaluate their compounds would not have allowed for this determination. The availability of an S1P receptor antagonist should provide a useful tool for studies of S1P biology. Two predictions made using S1P agonists and genetic models are prominent. First, the history of S1P and the S1P1 receptor in endothelial biology, which is reinforced by the defect in vascular maturation observed in S1P1 receptor gene ablated mice (3Matloubian M. Lo C.G. Cinamon G. Lesneski M.J. Xu Y. Brinkmann V. Allende M.L. Proia R.L. Cyster J.G. Nature. 2004; 427: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (2091) Google Scholar), has led to the suggestion that S1P1 receptor antagonists might prove useful as anti-angiogenic agents. Second, the suggestion that phospho-FTY720 exerts its effect on lymphocyte trafficking by desensitizing T-lymphocyte S1P1 receptors (and thereby functionally antagonizing S1P signaling in T-cells (3Matloubian M. Lo C.G. Cinamon G. Lesneski M.J. Xu Y. Brinkmann V. Allende M.L. Proia R.L. Cyster J.G. Nature. 2004; 427: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (2091) Google Scholar, 30Gräler M.H. Goetzl E.J. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 551-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar)), suggests that a S1P1 receptor antagonist should also evoke the lymphopenia that is characteristic of S1P1 receptor agonists, such as phospho-FTY720 or SEW2871 (4Sanna M.G.

The presence of the phosphate monoester in our current set of antagonist compounds, however, might result in their rapid hydrolysis by cell surface lipid phosphatases and thus make their use in vivo problematic. Thus, the testing of these ideas may require the synthesis of similar compounds containing hydrolysis-resistant phosphate analogs. In summary, the results presented here clearly illustrate the discrete chemical space associated with the interaction between these ligands and the S1P receptors. As demonstrated amply by FTY720, such chemical tools can provide unique insights into the physiological roles of S1P and expand our understanding of S1P receptor signaling, a significant undertaking given their potential roles as therapeutic targets.

Synthesis of mRNA in eukaryotic nuclei is carried out by RNA polymerase (Pol) 1The abbreviation used is: Pol, polymerase. 1The abbreviation used is: Pol, polymerase. II. The mechanism of Pol II transcription has been investigated in many biochemical and detailed structural studies (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Cramer P. Adv.

Pol II consists of a 10-polypeptide catalytic core and the heterodimeric Rpb4/7 complex, which can dissociate from the yeast enzyme (5Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 71-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Refined structures were reported for the Pol II core in free form (6Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Fu J. Gnatt A.L. Maier-Davis B.

A. 2002; 99: 1218-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Crystallographic models of the Pol II core bound to the initiation factor TFIIB and bound to a synthetic DNA-RNA hybrid were published recently (10Westover K.D. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D.

Science. 2004; 303: 983-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). For the complete 12-subunit Pol II, backbone models were reported for the free enzyme (12Armache K.-J. Kettenberger H. Cramer P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6964-6968Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 13Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2003; 114: 347-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Our previous Pol II model was derived by fitting structures of the core polymerase and a distantly related archaeal Rpb4/7 counterpart (15Todone F. Brick P. Werner F. Weinzierl R.O. Onesti S. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1137-1143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) to a 4.2-Å crystallographic electron density map, guided by selenomethionine markers (12Armache K.-J. Kettenberger H. Cramer P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6964-6968Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The model showed the overall architecture of the enzyme but did not reveal details of the Rpb4/7 structure or its interaction with the Pol II core. Rpb4/7 was seen protruding from the polymerase upstream face, where initiation factors assemble for promoter loading. Rpb7 formed a wedge underneath the mobile Pol II clamp, apparently restricting the clamp to a closed position and preventing entry of a DNA duplex into the active center cleft. We present here the refined atomic model of the complete Pol II at 3.8-Å resolution. To derive this model we determined the crystal structure of the free Rpb4/7 subcomplex at 2.3-Å resolution. Comparison of the complete Pol II structure with the structures of the core enzyme and the Rpb4/7 subcomplex reveals folding events that accompany formation of Pol II. The refined complete Pol II structure provides the new reference for functional analysis of the eukaryotic transcription machinery. The structure also enables further structural studies of scarce complexes of the complete Pol II, such as a recently described complex with DNA, RNA, and the elongation factor TFIIS (16Kettenberger H. Armache K.-J. Cramer P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 955-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Rpb4/7 Preparation and Crystallization—Rpb4 and Rpb7 were coexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (12Armache K.-J. Kettenberger H. Cramer P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6964-6968Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The Rpb4/7 variant lacking 34 amino-terminal residues of Rpb4 and with loop residues 82–100 deleted was amplified by PCR from the full-length Rpb4/7 construct and subcloned into vector pET21b (Novagen). The Rpb4/7 variant was purified essentially as described above and concentrated to 3 mg/ml. Crystals were grown at 20 °C with the hanging drop method, using a reservoir solution of 0.2 m di-ammonium hydrogen phosphate, pH 7.9, 20–22% polyethylene glycol 3350, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Crystals grew to a maximum size of 0.3 × 0.2 × 0.1 mm. Crystals were transferred stepwise to reservoir solutions additionally containing 5%, 10%, 18%, and 22% glycerol and plunged in liquid nitrogen. X-ray Structure Determination of Rpb4/7—A multiwavelength anomalous diffraction experiment was performed with selenomethionine-containing crystals at the Swiss Light Source (Table I). Data were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). The program SOLVE (18Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1937-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) detected 14 selenium sites and was used for multiwavelength anomalous diffraction phasing (Z-score = 42.8; figure of merit = 0.37). A subsequent anomalous difference Fourier identified four additional peaks. After phasing with SHARP (19de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar), six additional selenium peaks were detected, giving a total of 24 selenium peaks. The peaks stemmed from four copies of the Rpb4/7 complex in the asymmetric unit and could be assigned to methionines Met1, Met22, Met106, and Met115 in Rpb7 and Met145 in Rpb4 (double peak). Phasing with all selenium peaks resulted in a figure of merit of 0.40 and in an electron density map that enabled building of an initial model with program O (20Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar) that was partially refined with crystallography NMR software (21Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar). The native crystal belonged to the same space group as the selenomethionine crystals (P21212), but the crystallographic c-axis is half the length (Table I), resulting in two Rpb4/7 complexes per asymmetric unit instead of four complexes. Thus, a dimer of two Rpb4/7 complexes was used as a search model in AMORE (22Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar) to solve the native structure by molecular replacement (Table I, correlation coefficient = 42.7, next highest peak = 36.9). An atomic Rpb4/7 model was refined, which shows 99% of the residues in allowed and additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, and none of the residues in disallowed regions (Table I).Table ICrystal structure determinationsCrystalRpb4/7 SeMetRpb4/7 nativeComplete Pol IIData collectionaAll data were collected at beamline X06SA at the Swiss Light Source (Villigen, Switzerland)Space groupP21212P21212C2221Wavelength (Å)0.97946 peak0.93930 remote0.97973 inflection0.932000.97924Unit cell axis (Å)103.39, 114.69, 161.42103.65,114.81, 80.48222.7, 395.1, 284.3Resolution (Å)20-2.6 (2.69-2.60)20-2.6 (2.69-2.60)20-2.6 (2.69-2.60)50-2.3 (2.4-2.3)50-3.8 (3.95-3.8)Completeness (%)99.6 (99.5)99.7 (99.6)99.7 (99.6)95.2 (92.0)99.3 (97.0)Unique reflections59,077 (5,811)59,144 (5,816)59,129 (5,815)41,315 (4,872)121,866 (13,089)Redundancy4.54.54.33.23.2Rsym (%)7.9 (21.6)7.4 (29.4)8.3 (40.3)4.9 (31.0)7.3 (35.3)<I/σI>15.013.311.716.011.5f′-7.8-2.28-9.6f″5.03.532.5RefinementResidues5833902Zn2+/Mg2+-/-8/1Water molecules154r.m.s.d.br.m.s.d., root mean square deviation bonds (Å)0.0070.009r.m.s.d. angles (°)1.361.53Rcryst (%)22.825.7Rfree (%)27.428.5a All data were collected at beamline X06SA at the Swiss Light Source (Villigen, Switzerland)b r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation Open table in a new tab X-ray Structure Analysis of the Complete Pol II—The complete 12-subunit Pol II was reconstituted as described previously (12Armache K.-J.

Cell. 2003; 114: 347-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Complete diffraction data were collected in 0.5° increments at the Swiss Light Source (Table I). Molecular replacement with AMORE and the 10-subunit Pol II core (Protein Data Bank code 1I6H) as search model resulted in a unique solution (correlation coefficient = 52.4, second best solution = 30.5). The Pol II structure was adjusted with program O and refined with crystallography NMR software (Table I). Only a few rounds of restrained rigid body, positional, and B-factor refinement were carried out, with strict monitoring of the free R-factor. The refined structure has 98.5% of the residues in allowed and additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Structure Determinations—The complete 12-subunit yeast Pol II was prepared as described previously (12Armache K.-J. Kettenberger H. Cramer P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6964-6968Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and crystallized under altered conditions (16Kettenberger H. Armache K.-J. Cramer P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 955-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). We could extend the resolution of the crystals from 4.2 to 3.8 Å (Table I), but no further, likely because of the high solvent content of around 80%. An initial electron density map was phased with the core Pol II structure and improved by solvent flipping. The high quality of the map allowed us to adjust the structure of the polymerase core (7Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 8Gnatt A.L. Cramer P. Fu J. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1876-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar) and to build parts of the Rpb4/7 complex as an atomic model. To complete the model, however, we had to solve the crystal structure of free Rpb4/7 at high resolution (see “Experimental Procedures”). Full-length recombinant Rpb4/7 failed to crystallize, but crystals were obtained after 34 residues were removed from the proteolytically sensitive amino-terminal tail of Rpb4 (Fig. 1). Additional deletion of a proteolytically sensitive loop in Rpb4 resulted in larger crystals that diffracted synchrotron radiation to 2-Å resolution. The Rpb4/7 structure was solved by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction from a selenomethionine-substituted crystal and refined to a free R-factor of 27.4% at 2.3-Å resolution (Table I; Figs. 1 and 2). Due to the high resolution, a total of 154 water molecules could be added to the refined model of free Rpb4/7.Fig. 2Electron density maps. 2Fo - Fc electron density maps around the final model of Rpb4 residues 176–196 are shown for free Rpb4/7 at 2.3-Å resolution (left) and for the complete Pol II at 3.8-Å resolution (right). The maps are contoured at 1σ. The figure was prepared with BOBSCRIPT (26Esnouf R.M. J. Mol. Graph. 1997; 15: 132-134Crossref Scopus (1794) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The refined Rpb4/7 structure served as a guide for completion of the Rpb4/7 model within Pol II. After removal of the water molecules, restricted refinement of atomic positions and B-factors, minor adjustments of the complete Pol II model led to a structure with high stereochemical quality (Table I; Fig. 3). Two factors apparently enabled refinement of an atomic Pol II model with data to 3.8-Å resolution. First, combination of two refined structures, the core Pol II structure and the Rpb4/7 structure, resulted in a very good starting model. Second, the high solvent content allowed for powerful electron density modification and resulted in a favorable ratio of observed reflections to refinement parameters. The 3.8-Å electron density map has high quality, and side chains are generally visible (Fig. 2). Rpb4/7 Structure—The overall structure of the Rpb4/7 complex is similar to that of its archaeal counterpart (15Todone F. Brick P. Werner F. Weinzierl R.O. Onesti S. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1137-1143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Rpb4 binds between two Rpb7 domains, the amino-terminal “tip” domain and a carboxyl-terminal domain (Fig. 1B). Compared with the archaeal protein, Rpb7 lacks the carboxyl-terminal helix K4 and has an additional helix inserted into strand A3 (Fig. 1, K*). About half of the Rpb4 residues (residues 48–57 and 138–221) fold as in the archaeal counterpart. Rpb4 additionally contains a non-conserved amino-terminal extension (residues 1–46), a longer helix H1, and an insertion between helices H1 and H2 (H1-H2 insertion), which comprises a long disordered loop and an additional helix (Fig. 2, H*). The Rpb4 amino-terminal extension is flexible in free Rpb4/7 but forms a partially ordered loop in the Pol II structure. This Rpb4 aminoterminal extension is apparently associated weakly with Rpb2 in the complete Pol II structure (Fig. 3). However, residues involved in Rpb2-Rpb4 contacts are not conserved, and the 34 amino-terminal residues of Rpb4 are not required for binding to the Pol II core in vitro (data not shown). Three amino-terminal residues of Rpb4 associate with the sheet of the Rpb7 tip, similar to the amino-terminal half of strand A1 in the archaeal counterpart (Figs. 2 and 3). Folding Transitions upon Pol II Core-Rpb4/7 Interaction—In addition to the Rpb4 amino-terminal extension, other protein elements fold upon Rpb4/7-core interaction. The Rpb7 tip domain binds to the Pol II core with the helical turn K1 and with the highly conserved “tip loop,” which is disordered in the free Rpb4/7 structure but folds upon core binding (Fig. 4). There are no obvious changes in the conformation of the H1-H2 insertion upon core binding. Rpb4/7 binding, however, induces formation of an α-helix in the previously disordered residues 1445–1455 in the linker region of the largest Pol II subunit (Fig. 4, Rpb1 linker helix α50). Folding transitions upon interaction with Pol II are also observed in the elongation factor TFIIS (14Kettenberger H. Armache K.-J. Cramer P. Cell. 2003; 114: 347-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) and the initiation factor TFIIB (11Bushnell D.A. Westover K.D. Davis R.E. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2004; 303: 983-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and appear to be a common theme in interactions of the Pol II core with accessory factors. Specificity of the Pol II Core-Rpb4/7 Interaction—The complete Pol II structure reveals details of the Pol II core-Rpb4/7 interaction, which refine our previous description of the involved protein elements (12Armache K.-J. Kettenberger H. Cramer P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6964-6968Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). For example, the structure reveals a hydrogen bond between residue Gly66 of Rpb7 and residue Gln100 of Rpb6 in the Pol II core. This hydrogen bond explains why mutation of residue Gln100 in Rpb6 leads to facilitated Rpb4/7 dissociation and reduced Pol II activity upon a shift to non-permissive temperatures (23Tan Q. Prysak M.H. Woychik N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3329-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The detailed information on the core-Rpb4/7 interaction also helps to rationalize why another nuclear RNA polymerase, Pol I, binds specifically to A43/14, the Rpb4/7 counterpart. Specificity of A43/14 for the Pol I core may result from an ionic contact between a lysine that replaces the Rpb7 residue Pro63 in A43 and a patch of three glutamates that replace the Rpb1 residues Thr13, Met1433, and Gly1439 in the largest Pol I subunit. However, we could not find a straightforward explanation for specific interaction of the core of the third nuclear RNA polymerase, Pol III, with its Rpb4/7 counterpart, C25/17. It is possible that additional Pol III-specific subunits are involved in defining the specificity in subunit assembly. We thank C.

In response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), MAP kinases are rapidly activated and play an important role in the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Although a number of MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs) have been identified, their roles in the control of cytokine production have not been well defined. In the present report, we investigated the role of MKP-1 in alveolar macrophages stimulated with LPS. We found that LPS triggered transient activation of three MAP kinase subfamilies, ERK, JNK, and p38, in both immortalized and primary murine alveolar macrophages. MKP-1 was rapidly induced by LPS, and its induction correlated with the dephosphorylation of these MAP kinases. Blocking MKP-1 with triptolide prolonged the activities of both JNK and p38 in immortalized alveolar macrophages. Stimulation of primary alveolar macrophages isolated from MKP-1-deficient mice with LPS resulted in a prolonged p38 phosphorylation compared with wild type alveolar macrophages. Accordingly, these MKP-1-deficient alveolar macrophages also mounted a more robust and rapid tumor necrosis factor α production than their wild type counterparts. Adenovirus-mediated MKP-1 overexpression significantly attenuated tumor necrosis factor α production in immortalized alveolar macrophages. Finally, MKP-1 was induced by a group of corticosteroids frequently prescribed for the treatment of inflammatory lung diseases, and the anti-inflammatory potencies of these drugs closely correlated with their abilities to induce MKP-1.

We speculate that MKP-1 may represent a novel target for therapeutic intervention of inflammatory lung diseases. Bacterial pneumonia represents a serious challenge to the public health. In the United States alone, ∼4 to 5 million cases of community-acquired pneumonia occur each year, accounting for 10 million physician visits, a half million hospitalizations, and ∼45,000 deaths (1Bartlett J.G. Breiman R.F. Mandell L.A. File Jr., T.M. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1998; 26: 811-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Among cases of the community-acquired pneumonia, ∼10% are caused by Gram-negative bacteria. Nosocomial pneumonia, which is primarily caused by Gram-negative bacteria and has a mortality rate of up to 30%, accounts for about 15% of all hospital-acquired infections (2Septimus E.J. Semin. Respir. Infect. 1989; 4: 245-252PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, elucidation of the pulmonary immune responses to Gram-negative bacteria is crucial for the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent and alleviate lung injury. Alveolar macrophages constitute the first line of immune defense against microbial agents that infiltrate the gas-exchanging airways (3File T.M. Semin. Respir. Infect. 2000; 15: 184-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 4Zhang P. Summer W.R. Bagby G.J. Nelson S. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 173: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). These cells serve important phagocytic, microbicidal, and secretory functions and play a prominent role in lung immunity by initiating inflammatory and immune responses. Alveolar macrophages are essential for the daily clearance of air-borne microbial infiltration and maintaining the sterility of the delicate alveolar surfaces for effective gas exchange. When invading pathogens overwhelm the innate host defenses and establish an infection in the lung, as in bacterial pneumonia, alveolar macrophages are capable of initiating profound inflammatory responses. As a critical part of the innate immune defense, alveolar macrophages produce an array of inflammatory mediators that orchestrate the recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes from the pulmonary vasculature into the alveolar spaces for the effective eradication of the offending pathogens (5Sibille Y. Reynolds H.Y. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1990; 141: 471-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Among the crucial inflammatory mediators produced by alveolar macrophages are proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MKP, MAP kinase phosphatase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; m.o.i., multiplicity/multiplicities of infection; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase.1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MKP, MAP kinase phosphatase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; m.o.i., multiplicity/multiplicities of infection; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase.-α, interleukin 1β, and interleukin 6. Although these inflammatory cytokines are beneficial to pulmonary host defense, excessive production of these cytokines is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory lung injury, which can result in failure of lung function in severe cases (6Mizgerd J.P. Spieker M.R. Doerschuk C.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4042-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Macrophage activation and the subsequent production of proinflammatory cytokines as responses to Gram-negative bacteria have been studied extensively (7Beutler B. Kruys V. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1995; 25: S1-S8Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a cell wall component unique to Gram-negative bacteria, forms complexes with the LPS-binding protein. These complexes then interact with CD14 and toll-like receptor-4, leading to the activation of a multitude of signaling cascades that ultimately result in the biosynthesis of a group of proinflammatory cytokines (7Beutler B. Kruys V. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1995; 25: S1-S8Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 8Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). MAP kinases, including extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), and p38, play crucial roles in this process. Carter et al. (9Carter A.B. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that, in LPS-stimulated human alveolar macrophages, both p38 and ERK are required for the maximal production of TNF-α and interleukin-6. It has been reported that JNK is potently activated in response to LPS stimulation in primary rat alveolar macrophages (10Zhang P. Nelson S. Holmes M.C. Summer W.R. Bagby G.J. Shock. 2002; 17: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), although the role of JNK in the macrophage responses to LPS has not been defined. Also poorly understood are the negative regulation of MAP kinases in alveolar macrophages and the mechanisms responsible for the termination of the biosynthesis of proinflammatory cytokines. In the present report, we examined the function and regulation of MAP kinase phosphatase (MKP)-1 in LPS-stimulated primary and immortalized alveolar macrophages. We found that MKP-1 is highly induced by LPS in alveolar macrophages, and its induction is associated with the inactivation of MAP kinases. Using primary alveolar macrophages isolated from MKP-1-deficient mice, we demonstrated that MKP-1 acts in vivo to attenuate the p38 MAP kinase cascade, thus inhibiting the biosynthesis of proinflammatory cytokines. We also found that MKP-1 is highly induced by a group of corticosteroids commonly prescribed for the treatment of inflammatory lung diseases. Moreover, the abilities of these corticosteroids to induce MKP-1 are correlated with their relative anti-inflammatory potencies. Our studies suggested that MKP-1 plays an important role in the pulmonary innate immune defense and could be a novel target for the development of new anti-inflammatory drugs. Animals—Male C57BL/6 mice (8–12 weeks old) were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN). The generation of MKP-1 knock-out mice has been described previously (11Dorfman K. Carrasco D. Gruda M. Ryan C. Lira S.A. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 925-931PubMed Google Scholar). Cryopreserved embryos of MKP-1 knock-out mice (MKP-1+/- and MKP-1-/-) were kindly provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and were regenerated into mice in The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). These mice were bred in-house to yield both wild type and MKP-1-/- mice. All of the mice were maintained on Harlan Tecklad irradiated diet (Harlan) at 24 °C with relative humidity between 30 and 70% on a 12-h day-night cycle. All of the animals received humane care in accordance with the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health and were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation. The experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Columbus Children's Research Institute. Isolation of Primary Murine Alveolar and Peritoneal Macrophages, Cell Culture, and Treatment—Resident bronchoalveolar macrophages were isolated from naive male C57BL/6, MKP-1+/+, or MKP-1-/- mice by alveolar lavage. Briefly, murine lungs were filled and flushed 15–20 times with 0.7 ml of prewarmed phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 5 mm EDTA. This procedure yielded about 10 ml of lung lavage per animal. Cells in the alveolar lavage were collected by centrifugation at 800 × g for 8 min at 4 °C and plated into tissue culture dishes in RPMI 1640 (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and 2 mm l-glutamine. For immunofluorescence studies, the alveolar macrophages were seeded onto poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips. For assaying the role of MKP-1 in TNF-α production, cell suspensions containing 3 × 105 alveolar macrophages, together with residual nonadherent cells, were plated into 6-well tissue culture plates. Four h later, nonadherent cells were removed by extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline. The macrophages were cultured in complete medium overnight before being stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS (Escherichia coli 055:B55, Calbiochem). After stimulation, cells were harvested into lysis buffer and culture medium collected as described previously (12Chen P. Li J. Barnes J. Kokkonen G.C. Lee J.C. Liu Y. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6408-6416Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Resident peritoneal macrophages were isolated from naive male MKP-1+/+ or MKP-1-/- mice by carrying out a lavage of the peritoneum three times each with 4 ml of complete medium. Cells in the peritoneal lavage were collected by centrifugation at 800 × g for 8 min at 4 °C and were plated in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. Four h after plating, nonadherent cells were removed by extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline. The macrophages were cultured overnight in complete medium supplemented with interferon-γ (50 units/ml, CalBiochem) before being stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml). Mouse alveolar macrophage MH-S cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and were grown in complete medium (RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1.5 g/liter NaHCO3, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μm mercaptoethanol) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. LPS was added to the cell culture to achieve a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. Triptolide (Calbiochem), dissolved in Me2SO, was added to the medium at indicated concentrations 30 min before stimulating the cells with LPS. Dexamethasone, betamethasone, budesonide, flunisolide, triamcinolone, beclomethasone, clobetasol propionate, and prednisone, all purchased from Sigma, were dissolved in Me2SO as 5 mm stock solutions and were added to the medium to achieve a final concentration of 5 μm. Advenovirus Infection—The replication-deficient adenovirus expressing MKP-1 has been described previously (13Pratt P.F. Bokemeyer D. Foschi M. Sorokin A. Dunn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51928-51936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Null adenovirus was kindly provided by Dr. Michael Crow (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine). On the day of viral infection, medium was removed, and cells, grown in 35-mm dishes, were washed once with medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum. The cells were incubated with adenovirus in 300 μl of medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum for 1 h on a Belly Dancer (Stovall Life Science) shaking at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, before complete medium was added to the culture. Twenty-four h later, cells were fed with fresh complete medium and were allowed to grow overnight before stimulation with LPS. Western Blotting, ELISA, and Immunofluorescence—Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (12Chen P. Li J. Barnes J. Kokkonen G.C. Lee J.C. Liu Y. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6408-6416Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). MKP-1 was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Phosphorylated JNK, p38, and ERK were detected using rabbit polyclonal antibodies purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Total p38 or β-actin levels in the cell lysates were detected using an antibody against total p38 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or β-actin (Sigma), respectively. TNF-α in the culture medium was determined using the mouse ELISA Ready-SET-Go kits (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. To detect the phosphorylation levels of p38 in alveolar macrophages using immunofluorescence, cells were first fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C and then were blocked with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 10% normal goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h. After blocking, the cells were incubated at 4 °C overnight with a rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-p38 or anti-phospho-ERK antibody at a concentration of 20 μg/ml. The cells were washed twice with TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and once with TBS for 15 min, then were incubated with an Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing five times with TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, the cells were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to visualize the nuclei and were examined under a Zeiss Axioskop microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., New York). The fluorescent images were acquired with identical exposure time for all of the samples. The green fluorescent intensity was measured using AxioVision 3.1 software (Carl Zeiss). The fluorescent intensities of individual cells were defined as those above the background. Mean and S.E. were calculated from the fluorescent intensities of at least 20 randomly chosen cells. Northern and Southern Blotting—Total RNA was isolated using STAT-60 (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). Northern blot analysis was carried out using a full-length mouse MKP-1 cDNA as a probe as described previously (12Chen P. Li J. Barnes J. Kokkonen G.C. Lee J.C. Liu Y. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6408-6416Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 14Li J. Gorospe M. Hutter D. Barnes J. Keyse S.M. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8213-8224Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The membrane was stripped and reprobed with 18 S rRNA to normalize for RNA loading. For Southern blot analysis, genomic DNA was isolated from mouse tails according to standard procedures (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Ten μg of the genomic DNA was digested overnight with BamHI restriction enzyme. Southern blot analysis was performed using the full-length MKP-1 cDNA as a probe, as described previously (16Liu Y. Ishii S. Tokai M. Tsutsumi H. Ohki O. Akada R. Tanaka K. Tsuchiya E. Fukui S. Miyakawa T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 227: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Immune Complex Kinase Assays—JNK1 activity was measured by immune complex kinase assays as described previously (17Liu Y. Gorospe M. Yang C. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol.

Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 24: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), using [γ-32P]ATP and recombinant GST-c-Jun (1–143) as a substrate (20Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2403) Google Scholar). The incorporation of 32P into the substrates was quantitated using a Storm system and the ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Association between MKP-1 Induction and Inactivation of MAP Kinases in LPS-stimulated Alveolar Macrophages—To examine the regulation of MAP kinases in alveolar macrophages, we stimulated immortalized murine alveolar macrophage MH-S cells with LPS for different periods of time. The activation kinetics of ERK and p38 MAP kinases in the cells were assessed by Western blot analysis using phospho-specific antibodies (Fig. 1A). In control alveolar macrophages, p38 activity was virtually undetectable. Upon LPS stimulation, p38 was rapidly activated, reaching maximal levels at about 15 min; then p38 activity promptly plummeted, returning to nearly basal levels within 45 min. The change in p38 was due to reversible phosphorylation, because total p38 levels did not change over the time course of the experiment. Likewise, ERK was also potently activated in response to LPS stimulation with kinetics similar to that of p38 activation. The effect of LPS on JNK1 activity was examined by immune complex kinase assays using GST-c-Jun as a substrate (Fig. 1B). Similar to what was observed for p38, JNK1 activity was also transiently activated in response to LPS, reaching maximal levels at 15 min and returning to base line after 2 h (Fig. 1B, lower panel). The lack of change in total JNK1 protein content indicates that JNK1 activation was also due to reversible phosphorylation (Fig. 1B, upper panel). It has been shown that in mammalian cells, inactivation of MAP kinases is primarily carried out by a group of dual-specificity MAP kinase phosphatases (21Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). We have recently found that LPS induces the expression of MKP-1 in RAW264.7 cells (12Chen P. Li J. Barnes J. Kokkonen G.C. Lee J.C. Liu Y. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6408-6416Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). To examine whether MKP-1 plays a role in the regulation of MAP kinases in alveolar macrophages, we investigated the effect of LPS on MKP-1 expression. MKP-1 mRNA was examined with Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2A). Unstimulated MH-S alveolar macrophages expressed low basal levels of MKP-1 mRNA (Fig. 2A). Upon LPS stimulation, MKP-1 mRNA levels were rapidly elevated. The increase in MKP-1 mRNA expression was clearly evident within 15 min. Maximal MKP-1 mRNA levels were seen at about 60 min, followed by a gradual decline. Mirroring the increases in MKP-1 mRNA levels, MKP-1 protein levels were also increased upon LPS stimulation (Fig. 2B). MKP-1 protein band was clearly visible within 30 min, and its levels were significantly elevated by 45 min. Maximal MKP-1 protein levels were reached at about 60 min. Although MKP-1 mRNA levels decreased to nearly basal levels by 120 min (Fig. 2A), MKP-1 protein levels subsided only moderately (Fig. 2B). Comparable sample loading was confirmed using an antibody against a housekeeping protein, β-actin (Fig. 2B). The tight correlation between MKP-1 induction and the inactivation of MAP kinases suggests that MKP-1 plays a significant role in mediating the dephosphorylation of these MAP kinases. To further explore the relationship between MKP-1 and MAP kinases, we used triptolide to pharmacologically suppress the induction of MKP-1 and examined the effect of this MKP-1 blockade on the activation kinetics of MAP kinases after LPS stimulation. Pretreatment of MH-S cells with triptolide did not exhibit an appreciable effect on the basal MKP-1 levels. Triptolide attenuated LPS-induced MKP-1 accumulation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A, upper panel). Consistent with the idea that MKP-1 plays an important role in the dephosphorylation of stress-activated MAP kinases, the blockade of MKP-1 induction by triptolide considerably delayed the dephosphorylation of p38 and JNK (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, triptolide exhibited little effect on the dephosphorylation of ERK (Fig. 3A). Triptolide pretreatment neither prevented nor delayed the responses of alveolar macrophages to LPS, as indicated by the prompt activation of p38 in the presence of triptolide (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that triptolide did not postpone the initiation of LPS-triggered signal transduction, arguing that MKP-1 blockade was responsible for the prolonged activation of p38 and JNK in LPS-stimulated MH-S cells. To investigate whether MKP-1 plays a significant role in the responses of primary alveolar macrophages to LPS, we studied MAP kinase regulation using bronchoalveolar macrophages isolated from naive male C57BL/6 mice. We found that recovery of alveolar macrophages from the lungs by lavage was relatively small; one adult mouse yielded ∼3–5 × 105 alveolar macrophages. To overcome the difficulty in obtaining large quantities of primary alveolar macrophages, we performed immunofluorescence assays to assess the activation of p38 in LPS-stimulated primary alveolar macrophages, using a monoclonal rabbit antibody specific for phosphorylated p38 (Fig. 4A). In unstimulated alveolar macrophages, low basal levels of phospho-p38 were detected. Upon LPS stimulation, phospho-p38 levels were markedly elevated within 15 min, with maximal activity attained at about 30 min, which was followed by a gradual decline in phospho-p38 levels. It is worth noting that at 15 min the phospho-38 levels in the cells appeared to vary widely, probably reflecting the heterogeneity in the responses of individual cells. Quantitation of the fluorescent intensity in individual cells, as a measurement of phospho-p38 levels, indicated that p38 activity decreased by ∼58% after 1 h and dropped by ∼70% after 2 h (Fig. 4A). Phosphorylated (that is, active) p38 appeared to localize in both the cytosolic and nuclear compartments, which were distinguished by DAPI staining (Fig. 4A). To validate the methodology of the immunofluorescence-based p38 activity assay, we performed Western blot analysis to examine the activation kinetics of p38 after LPS stimulation (Fig. 4B). From 20 C57BL/6 mice, ∼8 × 106 alveolar macrophages were collected and pooled. Similar to what was observed with the immunofluorescence assays, LPS stimulation resulted in a transient activation of p38, with maximal phosphorylation levels observed between 15 and 30 min. After the peak, p38 activity rapidly descended by 60 min. Likewise, JNK and ERK also underwent a transient activation with kinetics similar to those of p38 activation (Fig. 4B). Correlated with the inactivation of these MAP kinases, MKP-1 underwent a potent induction upon LPS stimulation (Fig. 4B). MKP-1 protein became clearly evident by 30 min and reached high levels by 60 min. Immunofluorescent analysis of phospho-ERK in fixed cells confirmed the observations made by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4C). Taken together, our results validated the methodology of immunofluorescence for the assessment of phospho-p38 levels in LPS-stimulated alveolar macrophages. More importantly, these results strongly suggest that MKP-1 is a physiologically relevant regulator of MAP kinases in alveolar macrophages during bacterial infection. Effects of MKP-1 Deficiency on p38 Activity and TNF-α Biosynthesis in Alveolar Macrophages—To further elucidate the physiological functions of MKP-1, we obtained cryopreserved embryos of MKP-1 knock-out mice from Bristol-Myers Squibb and regenerated these embryos into mice. The MKP-1 transgenic mice were bred to produce wild type (MKP-1+/+), heterozygous (MKP-1+/-), and homozygous (MKP-1-/-) offspring. The genotypes of these progenies were determined by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 5A). To verify the deficiency of MKP-1 protein in the MKP-1 knock-out mice, resident peritoneal macrophages were isolated from wild type and MKP-1-/- mice and primed with interferon-γ overnight. Stimulation of the peritoneal macrophages with LPS for 60 min resulted in a large increase in MKP-1 protein in wild type but not in MKP-1-/- cells, indicating the lack of MKP-1 function in these animals (Fig. 5B). Importantly, compared with the MKP-1+/+ peritoneal macrophages, the MKP-1-/- peritoneal macrophages exhibited significantly elevated levels of phospho-p38, phospho-JNK, and phospho-ERK proteins, illustrating a crucial role for MKP-1 in the dephosphorylation of these kinases in these cells (Fig. 5B). Because of the relatively limited numbers of alveolar macrophages isolated from mice, the kinetics of p38 activation in wild type and MKP-1-deficient alveolar macrophages were examined by immunofluorescence using an antibody specific for phospho-p38 (Fig. 5C). In wild type alveolar macrophages, LPS resulted in a transient p38 phosphorylation that reached its maximal levels at 15–30 min and returned to nearly basal levels by 1 h. LPS also triggered a rapid p38 phosphorylation in MKP-1-deficient cells. However, unlike the rapid dephosphorylation of p38 observed in wild type alveolar macrophages, p38 activity persisted for a substantially longer time in MKP-1-deficient alveolar macrophages. In fact, the levels of p38 phosphorylation at 60 and 120 min did not markedly differ from the peak levels (Fig. 5C). These results indicate that MKP-1 plays a critical role in the negative feedback control of p38 in LPS-stimulated alveolar macrophages. To understand the function of MKP-1 in the regulation of TNF-α production, alveolar macrophages isolated from both wild type and the MKP-1-deficient mice were stimulated with LPS for 4 and 6 h, and the medium was harvested. TNF-α concentrations in the medium were measured by ELISA. Compared with the wild type alveolar macrophages, the MKP-1-deficient cells produced significantly more TNF-α at both the 4- and 6-h time points (Fig. 6A). Our results indicate that MKP-1-deficient alveolar macrophages were able to mount a more robust and rapid inflammatory responses than were wild type cells. To further define the function of MKP-1 in the regulation of proinflammatory cytokines in alveolar macrophages, we examined the effect of MKP-1 overexpression on TNF-α production in MH-S alveolar macrophages. Because MH-S cells were extremely difficult to transfect, adenovirus was utilized to mediate high level MKP-1 expression. MH-S cells were infected with either null or MKP-1-expressing adenoviruses at doses of 200, 400, or 800 multiplicities of infection (m.o.i.). Thirty-six h later, cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS for 4 or 6 h. TNF-α secreted into the medium was determined by ELISA (Fig. 6B). Infection of cells with the MKP-1-expressing adenovirus, but not the null adenovirus, resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of TNF-α secretion. Infection with 800 m.o.i. of MKP-1 adenovirus resulted in a 53% reduction in TNF-α production, whereas infection with the same m.o.i. of null virus had no significant effect. These results indicate that enhanced expression of MKP-1 inhibits TNF-α production. Taken together, these results suggest that MKP-1 plays an important role in modulating the responses of alveolar macrophages to LPS to prevent overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines. Induction of MKP-1 by Anti-inflammatory Corticostero"
https://openalex.org/W2072505432,"Transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase has been shown to be activated by cellular stresses including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Here, we characterized the molecular mechanisms of cellular stress-induced TAK1 activation, focusing mainly on the phosphorylation of TAK1 at Thr-187 and Ser-192 in the activation loop. Thr-187 and Ser-192 are conserved among species from Caenorhabditis elegans to human, and their replacement with Ala resulted in inactivation of TAK1. Immunoblotting with a novel phospho-TAK1 antibody revealed that TNF-α significantly induced the phosphorylation of endogenous TAK1 at Thr-187, and subsequently the phosphorylated forms of TAK1 rapidly disappeared. Intermolecular autophosphorylation of Thr-187 was essential for TAK1 activation. RNA interference and overexpression experiments demonstrated that TAK1-binding protein TAB1 and TAB2 were involved in the phosphorylation of TAK1, but they regulated TAK1 phosphorylation differentially. Furthermore, SB203580 and p38α small interfering RNA enhanced TNF-α-induced Thr-187 phosphorylation as well as TAK1 kinase activity, indicating that the phosphorylation is affected by p38α/TAB1/TAB2-mediated feedback control of TAK1.

On the other hand, the transcriptional activity of NF-κB is regulated by IκB kinase (IKK)-mediated degradation of IκBs and subsequent nuclear translocation of the NF-κB complex (15Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar). Several MAP3Ks have also been shown to regulate the NF-κB pathway by controlling the IKK complex (16Yang J. Lin Y. Guo Z. Cheng J. Huang J. Deng L. Liao W. Chen Z. Liu Z. Su B. Nat.

However, the precise functions of MAP3Ks in the regulation of IKK are still controversial, mainly because of the poor characterization of the regulatory mechanisms of MAP3K activation under physiological conditions. Transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is one of the most characterized MAP3K family members and is activated by various cellular stress, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), lipopolysaccharide, and osmotic stress (5Shirakabe K.

In addition, TAK1 is essential for antibacterial innate immunity in Drosophila (33Vidal S. Khush S.R. Leulier F. Tzou P. Nakamura M.

In these signaling pathways, TAK1 functions as an upstream stimulatory molecule of the JNK, p38, and IKK signaling pathways. Therefore, TAK1 has been recognized as a potential candidate that regulates the cellular stress-induced activation of both AP-1 and NF-κB. Other MAP3Ks such as MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1), MEKK3, and mixed lineage kinases (MLKs) have been also reported to activate both the AP-1 and NF-κB pathways (16Yang J.

In contrast, apoptosis signal-regulated kinase 1 (ASK1) has been characterized as a MAP3K specifically activating JNK/p38 pathways (11Takeda K. Matsuzawa A. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. Cell Struct. Funct. 2003; 28: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). TAK1 is a unique MAP3K whose kinase activity is controlled by specific TAK1-binding proteins (37Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Two TAK1-binding proteins, TAB1 and TAB2, have been well characterized in the IL-1 signaling pathway (20Takaesu G. Kishida S. Hiyama A. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K.

Biol. 2001; 21: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). TAB1 binds to the NH2-terminal catalytic domain of TAK1 and is essential for TAK1 kinase activity (37Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal 68 amino acids of TAB1 are sufficient for full activation of TAK1 (37Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K.

Commun. 2002; 297: 1277-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the NH2-terminal region of TAB1 shares a putative protein phosphatase 2C domain and a p38α binding domain (43Ge B. Gram H. Di Padava F. Huang B. New L. Ulevitch R.J. Luo Y.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5793-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) reported that the association of TAB1 with p38α negatively regulates TAK1 kinase activity by phosphorylating TAB1 at Ser-423 and Thr-431. On the other hand, TAB2 interacts with the COOH-terminal region of TAK1, which functions as an adaptor protein to recruit TAK1 to TNF-α receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family members TRAF2 and TRAF6 in the TNF-α and IL-1 signaling pathways, respectively (20Takaesu G.

Gaynor R.B. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6277-6288Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The translocation of TAB2 from the membrane to the cytosol on stimulation of IL-1 facilitates the interaction between TAK1 and TRAF6 (20Takaesu G. Kishida S. Hiyama A. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 649-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IL-1 signaling leads to the ubiquitination of TAB2 through ubiquitin E3 ligase activity of TRAF6 (23Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.I. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar, 27Ishitani T. Takaesu G. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Shibuya H. Gaynor R.B. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6277-6288Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The TAK1 kinase activity is regulated restrictedly in TNF-α and IL-1 signaling pathways. We demonstrated previously that TNF-α induces the kinase activity within a few min after stimulation, with a rapid turnover within 10 min (18Sakurai H. Miyoshi H. Toriumi W. Sugita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10641-10648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms of the rapid and transient activation of TAK1 are still unclear. TAK1 has been suggested to be phosphorylated in the stress signaling pathway. Mutational experiments defined Thr-187 and Ser-192 in the activation loop as target residues to trigger TAK1 kinase activity (41Sakurai H. Miyoshi H. Mizukami J. Sugita T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 442: 141-145Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 42Sakurai H. Nishi A. Sato N. Mizukami J. Miyoshi H. Sugita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, there is no evidence of the phosphorylation of endogenous TAK1 under physiological conditions. In this study, we generated a novel phospho-TAK1 antibody specifically recognizing the Thr-187 phosphorylated form. The present study using the antibody demonstrated that phosphorylation of TAK1 at Thr-187 is correlated with endogenous TAK1 kinase activity. Expression Vectors—Expression vectors for TAK1, TAB1, and IKKβ were reported previously (18Sakurai H. Miyoshi H. Toriumi W. Sugita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10641-10648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 19Sakurai H. Shigemori N. Hasegawa K. Sugita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Nishi A. Sato N. Mizukami J. Miyoshi H. Sugita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 1277-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Point mutations were made by using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and all of the mutations were verified by DNA sequencing analysis. The expression vector for TAB2 was kindly provided by Dr. Kunihiro Matsumoto (Nagoya University, Japan). Antibodies and Reagents—A novel antiphospho-TAK1 (Thr-187) antibody was generated by immunizing rabbits with the synthetic phosphopeptide corresponding amino acids 180–194 of human TAK1. The sequence of peptide antigen is as follows, NH2-CDIQTHM[pT]NNKG-SAA-COOH. The immunoglobulin fraction was purified by affinity chromatography with the phospho-TAK1 peptide. The phosphospecific antibody was obtained in a flow-through fraction of a nonphospho-TAK1 peptide column. Antiphospho-p38 (Thr-180/Tyr-182), anti-HA tag (262K), and anti-IKKβ antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies against TAK1 (M-579), TAB1 (C-20), TAB2 (K-20), p38 (C-20), p65 (C-20-G), IκBα (C-21), PCNA (PC-10), IKKα (H-744), HA tag (Y-11), and GST (B-14) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-FLAG antibody (M5) was obtained from Sigma. Recombinant hTNF-α and SB203580 were obtained from GenzymeTECHNE and Calbiochem, respectively. Cell Cultures and Transfection—HeLa and HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. HEK293 and HeLa cells were transfected with expression plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 and Lipofectamine reagents (Invitrogen), respectively. Small Interfering RNAs (siRNAs)—Duplex siRNAs with two nucleotides overhang at the 3′-end of the sequence were designed at iGENE Therapeutics and synthesized at Hokkaido System Science Co., Ltd. The target sequences were as follows; TAK1, UGGCUUAUCUUACACUGGA; TAB1, GGCUCAAGUUCAGGAGUGAGAACAA; TAB2, GGAACGACUUCAAAGAGAACUUGAG; p38α (MAPK14), GCAUUACAACCAGACAGUUGAUAUU; and firefly luciferase (GL2), CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGA. HeLa cells were transfected with siRNAs in a final concentration of 20 nm using Lipofectamine reagents. At 72 h post-transfection, cells were stimulated. Preparation of Cell Extracts—After transfection or stimulation, whole cell lysates were prepared with lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously with some modifications (18Sakurai H. Miyoshi H. Toriumi W. Sugita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10641-10648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were suspended in 420 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and chilled on ice for 15 min. Next, 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added, and the suspension was vortexed vigorously for 10 s. Cytoplasmic extracts were collected from the supernatants of centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min. The nuclear pellets were washed with 200 μl of buffer A and suspended in 50–100 μl of buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The mixture was kept on ice for 15 min with frequent agitation. Nuclear extracts were prepared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min and stored at -85 °C. Immunoprecipitation—Cell lysates were diluted with an equal volume of dilution buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). After centrifugation, lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA tag antibody (clone 262K or Y-11) or anti-FLAG (M5) antibody on ice for 1.5 h and then rotated with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Bioscience) at 4 °C for 1.5 h. The Sepharose beads were washed three times with wash buffer (1:1 mixture of whole cell lysate buffer and dilution buffer). Immunoblotting—Cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P nylon membrane (Millipore). The membrane was treated with BlockAce (Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, Suita, Japan) and probed with primary antibodies as described above. The antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, and anti-goat IgG (DAKO), and visualized with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). For detection of endogenous phospho-TAK1, anti-phospho-TAK1 (Thr-187) antibody was incubated with the EnVision horseradish peroxidase reagent (DAKO) and anti-normal rabbit serum (DAKO). In competition assays, antibodies were preincubated with 10 μg/ml phosphorylated TAK1 peptides at 4 °C overnight. In Vitro Immunocomplex Kinase Assay—Epitope-tagged TAK1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibody (Y-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and endogenous TAK1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-TAK1 antibody. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed for TAK1 kinase activity using His6-MKK6 as a substrate. Endogenous JNK and IKK were immunoprecipitated with anti-JNK1 (FL, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-IKKα (H-744, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively. The protein kinase activities of the immunoprecipitates were determined by in vitro immunocomplex kinase assays using GST-c-Jun (1–54) and GST-IκBα (1–54), respectively (18Sakurai H. Miyoshi H. Toriumi W. Sugita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10641-10648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Luciferase Assay—Cells were cotransfected with expression vectors (as described above) and a luciferase reporter plasmid containing a 4xκB site or AP-1 site (Stratagene). The luciferase activity was measured by using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay (Promega). Impaired Activation of NF-κB and AP-1 by TAK1-T187A—Fig. 1A shows the amino acid sequences between subdomains VII and VIII (the activation loop) of TAK1 in the DNA data base. The protein kinase domains of mammalian TAK1, including human, mouse, and rat, are identical. The activation loop of Xenopus TAK1 (xTAK1) is also completely identical to that of mammalian TAK1. Moreover, Drosophila TAK1 (dTAK1) and MOM-4, a TAK1 homolog in Caenorhabditis elegans, retained the Thr residue corresponding to Thr-187 of mammalian TAK1. Ser-192 of TAK1, another possible phosphorylation site, is also conserved among the species, except for the replacement of Ser with Thr in MOM-4. To characterize the physiological role of Thr-187 phosphorylation, we first tried to investigate the functional importance of Thr-187 in the NF-κB and AP-1 signaling pathways. Overexpression of wild type TAK1 with TAB1 stimulated IKK kinase activity and subsequent degradation of IκBα and nuclear translocation of the NF-κB p65 subunit (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the mutant TAK1-T187A as well as kinase-inactive TAK1-K63W failed to induce these cellular responses. Activation of p38 and JNK is also impaired in cells transfected with TAK1-T187A (Fig. 1C). In addition, the impaired activation of downstream pathways resulted in reduced transcriptional activation of NF-κB and AP-1 by TAK1-T187A (Fig. 1, D and E). These results indicate that Thr-187 is essential for the activation of TAK1 by TAB1. TAB1-induced Thr-187 Phosphorylation of TAK1—To characterize the physiological roles of TAK1 phosphorylation, we developed a novel phosphospecific antibody recognizing TAK1 phosphorylated at Thr-187 (pTAK1-Ab). It has been shown that overexpression of TAK1 with TAB1 resulted in activation of TAK1 (37Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 41Sakurai H. Miyoshi H. Mizukami J. Sugita T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 442: 141-145Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first tried to detect Thr-187 phosphorylation of TAK1 in an overexpression experiment. FLAG-TAK1 and HA-TAB1 were expressed in HeLa cells, and then anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with pTAK1-Ab (Fig. 2A). The phosphospecific band and MKK6 phosphorylating activity of TAK1 were clearly detected when coexpressed with TAB1 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, no phosphorylation and kinase activity were detected in TAK1-T187A and TAK1-K63W even on the coexpression with TAB1 (Fig. 2A), indicating that pTAK1-Ab specifically recognizes the active form of TAK1. This correlates with the defective activation of the AP-1 and NF-κB signaling pathways by these TAK1 mutants described in Fig. 1. Ser-192 in the activation loop of TAK1 is another proposed phosphorylation site regulating TAK1 activation (45Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). We confirmed that replacing Ser-192 with Ala inhibited TAK1 kinase activity, in which Thr-187 phosphorylation was also impaired (Fig. 2A). This result was derived from either impaired Thr-187 phosphorylation in the cells or the requirement of Ser-192 for the antibody binding to TAK1 in vitro. To address this issue, the specificity of pTAK1-Ab to phospho-Thr-187 was evaluated by immunoblotting in the presence of several phospho-TAK1 peptides as competitors (Fig. 2B). Phosphospecific TAK1 was not competed by peptides with no phosphorylation (T-S) and single phosphorylation at Ser-192 (T-pS). In contrast, phospho-Thr-187 peptide (pT-S) and peptide with both phospho-Thr-187 and phospho-Ser-192 (pT-pS) completely blocked the binding of pTAK1-Ab to the active form of TAK1. These results demonstrated that pTAK1-Ab specifically recognizes phospho-Thr-187, and the binding is not dependent on the status of Ser-192 phosphorylation. The specific recognition of phospho-Thr-187 revealed that the mutation of Ser-192 resulted in impaired Thr-187 phosphorylation of TAK1 in vivo. Intermolecular Autophosphorylation of TAK1—We next tried to determine whether Thr-187 phosphorylation occurred via an intra- or intermolecular reaction. HeLa cells were transfect"
https://openalex.org/W2076019855,"Carbon monoxide (CO), previously considered a toxic waste product of heme catabolism, is emerging as an important gaseous molecule. In addition to its important role in neurotransmission, exogenous CO protects against vascular injury, transplant rejection, and acute lung injury. However, little is known regarding the precise signaling mechanisms of CO. We have recently shown that CO attenuates endothelial cell apoptosis during anoxia-reoxygenation injury by activating MKK3/p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Our current study is the first to demonstrate that CO can differentially modulate STAT1 and STAT3 activation and, specifically, that STAT3 activation by CO is responsible for the anti-apoptotic effect in endothelial cells. In addition, we show that the anti-apoptotic effects of CO depend upon both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and p38 MAPK signaling pathways in endothelial cells, whereas previous reports have implicated only the MKK3/p38 MAPK pathway. Using chemical inhibitors and dominant negative constructs, we show that CO enhances STAT3 activation via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and p38 MAPK pathways with subsequent attenuation of Fas expression and caspase 3 activity. These data highlight the anti-apoptotic signaling mechanisms of CO and, importantly, delineate potential therapeutic strategies to prevent ischemia-reperfusion or anoxia-reoxygenation injury in the vasculature. Carbon monoxide (CO), previously considered a toxic waste product of heme catabolism, is emerging as an important gaseous molecule. In addition to its important role in neurotransmission, exogenous CO protects against vascular injury, transplant rejection, and acute lung injury. However, little is known regarding the precise signaling mechanisms of CO. We have recently shown that CO attenuates endothelial cell apoptosis during anoxia-reoxygenation injury by activating MKK3/p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways.

The lungs possess the largest surface area of endothelial cells in the body.

Despite the emerging evidence of its biologic importance, the precise mechanisms of CO remain elusive. In this study, we sought to further delineate the signal transduction pathways utilized by CO during A-R injury. The PI3K/Akt and STAT pathways are known to play critical roles in mediating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptotic responses (10Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4657) Google Scholar, 11Battle T.E. Frank D.A. Curr. Mol. Med. 2002; 2: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The STAT family of transcription factors also mediates pro- and anti-apoptotic effects (11Battle T.E. Frank D.A. Curr. Mol. Med. 2002; 2: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 12Mui A.L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1547-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). There is little information on the role of PI3K/Akt and STAT pathways in mediating apoptotic signals during A-R injury, and nothing is known about the ability of CO to modulate these pathways. Given our previous data showing that CO requires p38 MAPK activation to exert an anti-apoptotic effect during endothelial cell A-R (13Zhang X. Shan P. Alam J. Davis R. Flavell R. Lee P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22061-22070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and reported associations among MAPKs, PI3K/Akt, and STATs (14Lee H.M. Jin H.S. Park J.W. Park S.M.

Signal. 2003; 15: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we investigated whether CO modulates A-R-induced apoptosis through PI3K/Akt and STAT pathways in lung endothelial cells. Reagents—LY294002 and SB203580 were purchased from Calbiochem. The phospho-p38, phospho-STAT1 (Tyr701), phospho-STAT3 (Ser727), phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705), STAT1, STAT3, phospho-Akt (Ser473), and Akt antibodies for Western blotting were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The β-tubulin, rat IgG-FITC, and Fas antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Endothelial Cell A-R CO Exposure—Rat pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAEC) have been described previously (16Zhang X. Bedard E.L. Potter R. Zhong R. Alam J. Choi A.M. Lee P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L815-L829Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and were exposed to A-R in the presence or absence of 15 ppm of CO according to our previous methods (4Zhang X. Shan P.

Apoptosis Detection—Annexin V-FITC detection (BD Biosciences) was used to determine apoptosis in PAEC by flow cytometry as described previously (4Zhang X. Shan P. Otterbein L.E. Alam J. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Choi A.M. Lee P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1248-1258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Flow Cytometric Analysis of Cell Surface Fas Expression—Cells were trypsinized, pelleted, suspended with Fas (1:100 dilution) or control rat IgG (1:100 dilution) antibody, and incubated on ice. The cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing anti-rat FITC (1:50 dilution) antibody. Cells were then fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and subjected to flow cytometry analysis. Western Blot Analysis—Phospho-p38, phospho-STAT1, phospho-STAT3, and phospho-Akt were analyzed by Western blot assays. To verify equivalent sample loading, membranes were stripped with Blot Restore Membrane rejuvenation solution (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) and re-probed with anti-β-tubulin antibody. Antibody to total STAT1 or STAT3 was used to detect the respective total STAT protein expression. Measurement of Caspase 3 Activity—Caspase 3 activity was measured with the CaspACE assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). After A-R PAEC were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in cell lysis buffer, cell lysates were centrifuged and the supernatants were incubated with the colorimetric substrate Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroanilide (Ac-DEVD-p-nitroanilide). The release of p-nitroanilide from Ac-DEVD-p-nitroanilide was measured at 405 nm using a spectrophotometer. Plasmid Constructs and Transient Transfections—PAEC were incubated for 6 h with DNA mixtures containing serum-free medium, FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science), and the relevant plasmid (STAT1 or STAT3 dominant negative mutant or pEFneo as empty vector control). STAT1 dominant negative mutant (Y701F) and STAT3 dominant negative mutant (Y705F) plasmids have been described previously (17Asao H. Fu X.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 867-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 18Zhang S.S. Wei J. Qin H. Zhang L. Xie B. Hui P. Deisseroth A. Barnstable C.J. Fu X.Y. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 2407-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). After incubation, cells were cultured for an additional 16 h in complete medium and then exposed to A-R in the presence or absence of 15 ppm. Our past studies have demonstrated the transfection efficiency of PAEC to exceed 80% using pEGFP transfections (16Zhang X. Bedard E.L. Potter R. Zhong R. Alam J. Choi A.M. Lee P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L815-L829Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear protein extracts from PAEC were prepared using NE-PER® nuclear and cytoplasmic reagents (Pierce, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. STAT electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously with minor modifications (19Lee P.J. Camhi S.L. Chin B.Y. Alam J. Choi A.M.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L175-L182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA binding activity was determined after incubation of 4 μg of PAEC nuclear protein extract with [γ-32P]ATP-labeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide (5′-GTGCATTTCCCGTAAATCTTGTCTACA-3′), representing a high affinity sis-inducing element (SIE) of the c-fos promoter (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), which yields both STAT1 and STAT3 binding (20Ndubuisi M.I.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13023-13032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Protein-DNA complexes were separated on Novex 6% retardation gels (Invitrogen). The gel was dried and exposed to Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). Self-competitions were carried out under the same conditions with a 100-fold molar excess of the unlabeled probe. Nonspecific competitions were performed with an unlabeled oligonucleotide probe encompassing an SP1 transcription factor binding site. For supershifts, nuclear protein extracts were preincubated with polyclonal anti-STAT1 antibody or anti-STAT3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 45 min at room temperature before proceeding to the binding reaction described above. Statistics—The data were expressed as mean ± S.E., and analyzed by Student's t test. Significance was accepted at p < 0.05. CO Differentially Modulates STAT1 and STAT3 Activation in PAEC during A-R—We have previously demonstrated that A-R-induced apoptosis in PAEC is initiated during the anoxia phase (4Zhang X. Shan P. Otterbein L.E. Alam J. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Choi A.M. Lee P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1248-1258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). We have also shown that the ability of CO to attenuate A-R-induced apoptosis is dependent upon its modulation of critical pathways, such as p38 MAPK, during anoxia (4Zhang X. Shan P. Otterbein L.E. Alam J. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Choi A.M. Lee P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1248-1258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). To evaluate the potential roles of STAT1 and STAT3 in the anti-apoptotic effect of CO, we first conducted a time course of phosphorylated and thus activated STAT1 and STAT3 protein expression during anoxia in the presence and absence of CO (Fig. 1A). CO decreased phospho-STAT1 expression but increased phospho-STAT3 expression by 8-h anoxia with maximal effect by 24-h anoxia. Our earlier studies demonstrated that, in the absence of CO, A-R-induced cell death was maximal after 24 h of anoxia and was maintained up to 8 h of reoxygenation (4Zhang X. Shan P. Otterbein L.E. Alam J. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Choi A.M. Lee P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1248-1258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the effect of CO on STAT1 and STAT3 during 24-h anoxia followed by a time course of reoxygenation. Similar to the effects of CO on STAT1 and STAT3 during anoxia, CO attenuated phospho-STAT1 protein while enhancing phospho-STAT3 protein during 24 h of anoxia followed by 0.5 to 4 h of reoxygenation (Fig. 1B, lanes 7–9). We tested for STAT DNA binding activity with the SIE oligonucleotide in PAEC during A-R in the presence and absence of CO and found that CO decreased the STAT1 binding activity but enhanced STAT3 binding activity during 24-h anoxia and 24-h anoxia followed by 1-h reoxygenation (Fig. 1C, lanes 4 and 5). The specificity of STAT1 and STAT3 binding was demonstrated by the ability of unlabeled SIE to compete with the radiolabeled SIE (Fig. 1C, lane 6), whereas unlabeled SP1, an unrelated oligonucleotide, did not compete for STAT1 and STAT3 binding (Fig. 1C, lane 7). In addition, antibodies against STAT1 or STAT3 were able to supershift the respective complexes (Fig. 1D). Therefore, we postulated that the ability of CO to decrease STAT1 activation and/or to increase STAT3 activation during anoxia and A-R might be responsible for the anti-apoptotic effect of CO. CO Differentially Modulates STAT1 and STAT3 Activation through the PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK Pathways in PAEC during A-R—We have shown in earlier studies that CO depends upon the activation of the p38 MAPK pathway to exert an anti-apoptotic effect (4Zhang X. Shan P. Otterbein L.E. Alam J. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Choi A.M. Lee P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1248-1258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 13Zhang X. Shan P. Alam J. Davis R. Flavell R. Lee P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22061-22070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Our current data demonstrate that CO modulates STAT1 and STAT3. The PI3K/Akt pathway is an important survival pathway and has been shown to modulate STAT3 serine phosphorylation (15Fung M.M. Rohwer F. McGuire K.L. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, we explored the role of PI3K/Akt in CO-mediated anti-apoptosis. A time course of phospho-Akt protein expression during anoxia in the presence and absence of CO demonstrates that CO increases phospho-Akt expression by 16–24 h of anoxia (Figs. 2A, lanes 6 and 7). Of note, we have published a similar time course of p38 MAPK activation by CO during anoxia (13Zhang X. Shan P. Alam J. Davis R. Flavell R. Lee P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22061-22070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). During A-R, CO also enhanced both p38 MAPK and Akt phosphorylation in PAEC (Fig. 2B, lanes 7–9). Unless otherwise noted, the subsequent figures used 24-h anoxia followed by 1-h reoxygenation (denoted as A-R) as a representative time point. To determine whether PI3K/Akt was upstream of p38 MAPK, we blocked the PI3K/Akt pathway with LY294002, a compound that acts as a competitive inhibitor of the ATP binding site of PI3K and has been shown to cause specific inhibition (23Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Walker E.H. Pacold M.E. Perisic O. Stephens L. Hawkins P.T. Wymann M.P. Williams R.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 909-919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). We blocked the p38 MAPK signaling pathway with SB203580 as described previously (16Zhang X. Bedard E.L. Potter R. Zhong R. Alam J. Choi A.M. Lee P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L815-L829Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). LY294002 pretreatment significantly inhibited CO-mediated activation of both Akt and p38 MAPK (Fig. 2C, lane 4). However, SB203580 pretreatment only inhibited p38 MAPK activation and had no effect on Akt activation (Fig. 2C, lane 5). These data indicated that the activation of p38 MAPK by CO is PI3K/Akt-dependent. We next tested whether CO modulated STAT1 and STAT3 via PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK pathways. We pretreated PAEC with SB203580 and observed that CO can no longer modulate STAT1 or STAT3 activation (Fig. 2D, lane 5). Consistent with our data that PI3K/Akt activation is upstream of p38 MAPK activation by CO during A-R (Fig. 2C), when we blocked the PI3K/Akt pathway with LY294002, CO lost its ability to decrease STAT1 and increase STAT3 activation during A-R (Fig. 2D, lane 4). These data demonstrated that the opposing effect of CO on STAT1 and STAT3 activation is dependent upon PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK pathways. The Anti-apoptotic Effect of CO Is Mediated through the PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK Pathways in PAEC during A-R—We next hypothesized that the inhibition of PI3K/Akt or p38 MAPK will abolish the anti-apoptotic effect of CO during A-R. Pretreatment of PAEC with LY294002 or SB203580 completely abolished the anti-apoptotic effect of CO as assessed by flow cytometry analysis for annexin V-FITC expression (Fig. 3A). Pretreatment with LY294002 or SB203580 in room air showed basal levels of cell death similar to those in room air alone (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 3). CO dramatically decreased A-R-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3B, lane 7). However, in the presence of PI3K/Akt inhibition with LY294002 or p38 MAPK inhibition with SB203580, CO could not attenuate A-R-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3B, lanes 8 and 9, respectively). CO Requires STAT3 Activation to Exert an Anti-apoptotic Effect in PAEC during A-R—Thus far, we have demonstrated that CO differentially modulates STAT1 and STAT3 activation via the PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK pathways. Furthermore, the PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK pathways are required for the anti-apoptotic effect of CO. Therefore, we hypothesized that decreased STAT1 and/or increased STAT3 activation may play an important role in the anti-apoptotic effect of CO. PAEC were transfected with empty vector or dominant negative mutant STAT1 (STAT1 DNM) or STAT3 (STAT3 DNM) or both DNM plasmids and then exposed to A-R in the presence and absence of CO. We first confirmed the ability of the DNMs to inhibit STAT1 and STAT3 activation. In Fig. 4A, PAEC transfected with STAT1 DNM, STAT3 DNM, or both STAT1 and STAT3 DNMs exhibited the appropriate decreases in A-R-induced DNA binding activity. Fig. 4B demonstrates a similar effect of the DNMs on STAT1 and STAT3 protein phosphorylation. As expected, empty vector transfection had no effect on A-R-induced STAT1 and STAT3 DNA binding activity or phosphorylation. We proceeded to test the effect of the DNMs on A-R-induced apoptosis. PAEC transfected with STAT3 DNM showed significantly increased apoptosis during A-R compared with wild type PAEC during A-R (Fig. 4D, lanes 5 and 7). In addition, CO lost its ability to inhibit A-R-induced apoptosis in the presence of STAT3 DNM (Fig. 4D, lane 11). However, in the presence of STAT1 DNM, PAEC exhibited similar levels of apoptosis compared with wild type PAEC during A-R and CO retained its ability to attenuate A-R-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4D, lanes 6 and 10). When both STAT1 and STAT3 DNM were transiently transfected, the level of A-R-induced apoptosis and CO-mediated effects were similar to that of STAT3 DNM alone (Fig. 4D, lanes 8 and 12). The transfection of wild type STAT1 and STAT3 constructs had no effect on CO-mediated apoptosis (data not shown). These data demonstrated that STAT3 activation, but not STAT1 inactivation, by CO is critical for the anti-apoptotic effect of CO during A-R. CO Decreases Fas Expression through PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK Pathways in PAEC during A-R—Our laboratory and others have previously shown that the anti-apoptotic effect of CO involves Fas inhibition through the p38 MAPK pathway (13Zhang X. Shan P. Alam J. Davis R. Flavell R. Lee P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22061-22070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Furthermore, p38 MAPK has been shown to protect human melanoma cells from UV-induced apoptosis through the down-regulation of Fas expression (25Ivanov V.N. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3003-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Given that our current studies demonstrate that the activation of p38 MAPK is via PI3K/Akt (Fig. 2C), we treated PAEC with LY294002 and SB203580 to assess Fas expression with flow cytometry analysis during A-R in the presence and absence of CO. Pretreatment of PAEC with LY294002 or SB203580 completely attenuated the inhibitory effect of CO on Fas expression (Fig. 5). CO decreased A-R-induced Fas expression to less than 25%, but in the presence of LY294002 or SB203580, CO lost its ability to decrease Fas expression (Fig. 5B, lanes 8 and 9). These data indicated that the inhibition of Fas expression by CO during A-R in PAEC is dependent upon PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK pathways. CO Requires STAT3 Activation to Attenuate Fas Expression in PAEC during A-R—Given that PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK pathways are involved in STAT1 and STAT3 modulation by CO (Fig. 2D) and the study by Ivanov et al. (26Ivanov V.N. Bhoumik A. Krasilnikov M. Raz R. Owen-Schaub L.B. Levy D. Horvath C.M. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 517-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) that demonstrates that dominant negative STAT3 in melanoma cells efficiently increased Fas expression, we surmised that STAT3 activation may be upstream of CO-mediated Fas modulation. PAEC were transiently transfected with STAT1 DNM or STAT3 DNM or both STAT1 and STAT3 DNM plasmids and then exposed to A-R in the presence or absence of CO. Not surprisingly, the Fas expression data paralleled the apoptosis data. PAEC transfected with STAT3 DNM showed significantly increased Fas expression during A-R compared with wild type PAEC during A-R (Fig. 6B, lanes 5 and 7). In addition, CO was unable to inhibit A-R-induced Fas expression in the presence of STAT3 DNM (Fig. 6B, lane 11). However, in the presence of STAT1 DNM, PAEC exhibited similar levels of Fas expression compared with wild type PAEC during A-R and CO retained its ability to attenuate A-R-induced Fas expression (Fig. 6B, lanes 6 and 10). When both STAT1 and STAT3 DNM were transiently transfected, the level of A-R-induced Fas expression and CO-mediated effects were similar to that of STAT3 DNM alone (Fig. 6B, lanes 8 and 12). These data indicated that the inhibition of Fas expression by CO during A-R depends upon STAT3 activation. CO Requires STAT3 Activation to Attenuate Caspase 3 Activity in PAEC during A-R—Similar to our apoptosis and Fas expression data, CO lost its ability to attenuate A-R-induced caspase 3 activity in the presence of STAT3 DNM (Fig. 6C, lanes 9 and 11). However, STAT1 DNM had no effect on A-R-induced caspase 3 activity or on the ability of CO to modulate caspase 3 (Fig. 6C, lanes 6 and 10). As expected, the simultaneous transient transfection of both STAT1 and STAT3 resulted in effects similar to those of STAT3 DNM alone (Fig. 6C, lanes 8 and 12). CO Inhibits Caspase 3 Activity through PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK Pathways in PAEC during A-R—To further define the downstream events modulated by CO via the PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK pathways, we assessed CO-modulated caspase 3 activity in the presence of LY294002 or SB203580. Caspase 3 activity was markedly decreased in the presence of CO (Fig. 6D, lane 7). When PAEC were pretreated with LY294002 (50 μm) or SB203580 (10 μm), CO lost its ability to decrease A-R-induced caspase 3 activity (Fig. 6D, lanes 8 and 9). These data indicated that the inhibition of caspase 3 activity by CO during A-R is PI3K/Akt- and p38 MAPK-dependent. CO is emerging as a gaseous molecule with profound and potentially therapeutic biologic effects. Exposing mice to exogenous CO in sublethal ranges up to 500 ppm dramatically attenuates inflammation, apoptosis, and lethality in a variety of injury and transplantation models (2Otterbein L.E.

Elucidating the signaling mechanisms of CO-mediated effects will be important if we are to precisely delineate the biology and potential applications of this often misunderstood gas. Our present study demonstrates that CO differentially modulates STAT1 and STAT3 via PI3K/Akt/p38 MAPK-dependent pathways. Furthermore, the ability of CO to increase A-R-induced STAT3 activation leads to CO-mediated attenuation of Fas expression and caspase 3 activity, thereby decreasing A-R-induced apoptosis. There is evidence that STAT1 and STAT3 have opposing actions in cytoprotection, cell death, and inflammation. STAT1 plays a critical role in I-R-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis (29Stephanou A. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 2002; 13: 401-403PubMed Google Scholar), and STAT1–/– mice do not exhibit significant lipopolysaccharide-induced liver damage and inflammation. STAT3 appears to mediate resistance to apoptosis in rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (30Krause A. Scaletta N. Ji J.D. Ivashkiv L.B. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6610-6616Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Recently, cardiomyocyte-restricted STAT3 knock-out mice exhibited greater inflammation, cardiac fibrosis, and heart failure with advanced age (31Jacoby J.J. Kalinowski A. Liu M.G. Zhang S.S. Gao Q. Chai G.X. Ji L. Iwamoto Y. Li E. Schneider M. Russell K.S. Fu X.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12929-12934Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Our studies show that, not only does CO differentially modulate STAT1 and STAT3, the CO-mediated increase in STAT3 activation, rather than STAT1 attenuation, is responsible for improved endothelial cell survival during A-R injury. STAT1 DNM did not significantly affect A-R-induced apoptosis, whereas STAT3 DNM increased A-R-induced Fas expression, caspase 3 activity, and endothelial cell apoptosis. Furthermore, STAT3 DNM inhibited the ability of CO to modulate apoptosis, Fas expression, and caspase 3 activity. Taken together, the data indicate that STAT3 has a critical cytoprotective role and mediates the anti-apoptotic effect of CO in endothelial cells. We have previously demonstrated that CO inhibited A-R-induced ERK1/2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1/2 MAPK activation but increased activation of p38 MAPK and MKK3, an upstream kinase (4Zhang X.

MAPKs have been found to be involved in STAT phosphorylation induced by interferon, serum withdrawal, ultraviolet radiation, and ischemia (28Stephanou A. Scarabelli T.M. Brar B.K. Nakanishi Y.

Investig. 1997; 99: 2898-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Precisely how p38 MAPK modulates STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation is still unclear and beyond the scope of our current study. We demonstrate that CO loses its ability to decrease STAT1 activation and increase STAT3 activation in the presence of p38 MAPK inhibition in endothelial cells. Furthermore, for the first time, we demonstrate that the anti-apoptotic effects of CO depend upon signaling through both the PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK pathways. In lung endothelial cells, CO-induced Akt expression and anti-apoptotic effects depend upon the PI3K/Akt pathway, which appears to be upstream of p38 MAPK activation by CO. We use primary lung endothelial cells to delineate the ability of CO to modulate STAT1 and STAT3 via PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK-dependent pathways. In addition, we demonstrate that STAT3 activation, rather than STAT1 inactivation, confers protection against A-R-mediated cell death. Consistent with this observation is our data showing that CO-mediated STAT3 activation, rather than CO-mediated STAT1 inactivation, is responsible for the ability of CO to attenuate Fas expression, caspase 3 activity, and apoptosis. I-R/A-R-induced apoptosis is an important contributor to organ failure, transplantation rejection, and mortality, yet effective therapies do not currently exist. By delineating anti-apoptotic mechanisms of gaseous molecules such as CO, we may uncover novel foundations upon which to base future therapeutic strategies.

We have previously described a group of genes that is rapidly up-regulated in these cells following dexamethasone (Dex) treatment. In an effort to dissect the mechanisms of GR-mediated breast epithelial cell survival, we now examine the molecular events downstream of GR activation. Here we show that GR activation leads to both the rapid induction of MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) mRNA and its sustained expression. Induction of the MKP-1 protein in the MCF10A-Myc and MDA-MB-231 breast epithelial cell lines was also seen. Paclitaxel treatment resulted in MAPK activation and apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, and both processes were inhibited by Dex pretreatment. Furthermore, induction of MKP-1 correlated with the inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity, whereas p38 activity was minimally affected. Blocking Dex-induced MKP-1 induction using small interfering RNA increased ERK1/2 and JNK phosphorylation and decreased cell survival. ERK1/2 and JNK inactivation was associated with Ets-like transcription factor-1 (ELK-1) dephosphorylation. To explore the gene expression changes that occur downstream of ELK-1 dephosphorylation, we used a combination of temporal gene expression data and promoter element analyses. This approach revealed a previously unrecognized transcriptional target of ELK-1, the human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). We verified the predicted ELK-1 → tPA transcriptional regulatory relationship using a luciferase reporter assay. We conclude that GR-mediated MAPK inactivation contributes to cell survival and that the potential transcriptional targets of this inhibition can be identified from large scale gene array analysis.

Lancet. 2000; 356: 87-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) constitute a superfamily of related kinases that are activated by a diverse array of extracellular stimuli (18Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). These include extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and the p38 protein kinase (19Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). MAPKs are activated by reversible Thr and Tyr phosphorylation of a conserved Thr-X-Tyr motif (20Raingeaud J. Gupta S.

A growing family of dual Thr- and Tyr-specific phosphatases (DUSPs), termed MAPK phosphatases (MKPs), has also been identified. The prototypic member of this family, MKP-1, also called DUSP-1, CL100, 3CH13, or ERP, was originally identified as an ERK-specific phosphatase (21Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K.

Chaudhuri S. Brickley D.R. Pang D. Karrison T. Conzen S.D. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1757-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 40Fan W. Sui M. Huang Y. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Here we explored the mechanism of Dex-mediated cell survival and found that the induction of MKP-1 following Dex treatment results in the specific inhibition of paclitaxel-induced ERK1/2 and JNK activity. Furthermore, MKP-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibits GR-mediated ERK and JNK dephosphorylation and cell survival. In an effort to further elucidate the role of ERK and JNK inactivation in inhibiting paclitaxel-induced apoptosis, potential downstream targets of the Ets-like transcription factor-1 (ELK-1) were examined. Using a combination of time course microarray and promoter element analyses, we identified 12 genes that were down-regulated by Dex and contain ELK-1 binding sites. Human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was chosen for further analysis, and Dex pretreatment was observed to inhibit paclitaxel-induced tPA promoter activation through an ELK-1 binding motif. These results suggest that GR-mediated MKP-1 induction and the subsequent inactivation of ERK and JNK signaling contribute to inhibition of paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. A set of ELK-1-dependent target genes was identified whose members are down-regulated 2–24 h following GR activation, suggesting that glucocorticoid signaling mediates both early (direct) and later (indirect) gene expression changes leading to cell survival.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Transfection—MCF10A-Myc cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F12 medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with hydrocortisone (0.5 μg/ml), human recombinant epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), and insulin (5 ng/ml; Sigma). MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transient transfection was performed using Polyfect reagent (Qiagen) per the manufacturer's instructions.For siRNA knockdown, MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells per 6-cm plate and allowed to adhere overnight. The next day, pSilencer 1.0-U6-MKP-1 siRNA or pSilencer 1.0-U6-control siRNA plasmid DNA (14Wu W. Chaudhuri S. Brickley D.R. Pang D. Karrison T. Conzen S.D. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1757-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) was transfected into cells using Polyfect. After 40 h, transfected cells were split equally into three 6-cm plates and allowed to adhere overnight. Paclitaxel (10–7 m) was added for various time periods (8, 24, or 30 h) with or without Dex (10–6 m) pretreatment and scored for apoptosis. Parallel experimental cell lysates were collected for Western analysis.Microarray Experiment and Data Analysis—The procedure for cRNA preparation and hybridization to high density oligonucleotide arrays was described previously (14Wu W. Chaudhuri S. Brickley D.R. Pang D. Karrison T. Conzen S.D. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1757-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Briefly, MCF10A-Myc cells were subjected to 72 h of growth factor withdrawal followed by treatment with either vehicle (ethanol), Dex (10–6 m), or concomitant Dex/RU486 (10–7m) for 0.5, 2, 4, or 24 h. Total RNA from each sample was extracted using a Qiagen RNeasy kit. The preparation of biotinylated cRNA and hybridization to oligonucleotide arrays (Affymetrix HG-U133A) were performed at the University of Chicago Microarray Core Facility. Gene chips were scanned and analyzed using Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0. To identify genes significantly regulated by GR activation, the first variation taken into account was the Affymetrix software description of a gene's expression, namely “absent” (gene intensity below an Affymetrix calculated threshold), “present,” or “marginal.” Genes deemed absent at all four time points in both Dex-treated and control samples were excluded from further analysis, because these gene intensity values were below the threshold and, therefore, considered to be unreliable. The second step was to exclude genes with intensities ≤20 in both Dex-treated and control samples at all four time points. This is because false positives are expected to be more frequent in genes with very low levels of expression. The third step was to set a cutoff of ≥1.5-fold (Dex-treated versus vehicle-treated) for “induction” and ≤0.5-fold (Dex-treated versus vehicle-treated) for “repression” at a given time point.Our main goal was to identify the transcriptional targets of ELK-1. A time lag is predicted to exist between the initial induction of MKP-1 gene expression and the subsequent repression of ELK-1 transcriptional targets (due to MKP-1 protein synthesis and dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 and ELK-1). Therefore, we first obtained a set of genes that have an ELK-1 binding motif, GGAANNTTAA, in their promoter regions using the Data Base of Transcriptional Start Sites (dbtss.hgc.jp). This software searches for promoter sequences with a specific transcription factor binding motif between –1000 nucleotide and +200 nucleotide. We subsequently identified putative ELK-1 targets by searching for a set of genes that both contained an ELK-1 binding motif and were down-regulated at either 2, 4, or 24 h following GR activation.Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA (20 μg) was isolated and fractionated on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to nylon membranes. The membranes were hybridized overnight to [32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probes encoding MKP-1 (a gift from Dr. Christele Debros-Monbers, Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (INSERM), Paris, France) or rat GAPDH (13Mikosz C.A.

Membranes were then washed and exposed to film. Band intensity was quantified using a GS-710 densitometer (Bio-Rad), and the relative ratio of MKP-1 signal to GAPDH signal was determined. The fold change was calculated by normalizing the MKP-1 signal from Dex or Dex/Ru486-treated cells to the vehicle-treated cell signal.Quantitative Real Time PCR—Total RNA was extracted (Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit) from MDA-MB-231 or MCF10A-Myc cells treated with either vehicle or Dex for 0.5, 2, 4, or 24 h. cDNA was synthesized from 0.5 μg of total RNA with TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems). Reverse transcription was performed in the GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems) beginning with an incubation period of 10 min at 25 °C followed by a reverse transcription period of 30 min at 48 °C and ending with reverse transcription inactivation by 95 °C for 5 min. Quantitative real time PCR (Q-RT-PCR) was carried out in the ABI Prism 7700 (Applied Biosystems) thermal cycler/detector in the following sequence: 2 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 95 °C, 40 cycles consisting of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C, 15 min at 95 °C, 20 min at 60 °C, and 15 min at 95 °C. The following primers were used: DUSP-1 (MKP-1, NM_004417), 5′-CCTGACAGCGCGGAATCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GATTTCCACCGGGCCAC-3′ (reverse); DUSP3 (VHR; NM_004090), 5′ TAAAAACCCCACCATTTGGA-3′ (forward) and 5′CTTCCCTGCTTGTCTTCTGG-3′ (reverse); DUSP-9 (MKP-4, NM_001395), 5′-GCCATCACTGGTGTTGTCAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAAACAAAACAGCCCACCAG-3′ (reverse); tPA, 5′-ACATGCTGTGTGCTGGAGAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTTTGAGGAGTCGGGTGTTC-3′ (reverse); GAPDH, 5′-GAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTGATTTTGGAGGGATCTCG-3′ (reverse). GAPDH was amplified as an internal control. The samples were loaded in triplicate, and the results of each sample were normalized to GAPDH. Fold change was calculated as a ratio of treated (Dex) over control (vehicle).Western Blot Analysis—MCF10A-Myc or MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with Dex (10–6 m) for various time periods. Cell lysates were prepared with cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride added before use. Equal amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked by incubation in 5% skim milk in TBS-T (0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline), and probed with a 1:1000 dilution of one of the following antibodies: the rabbit polyclonal anti-MKP-1 (M-18) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); the polyclonal anti-phospho-p44/42 (ERK1/2, Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibody; monoclonal anti-phospho-SAPK/JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185) antibody; and the anti-phospho-p38 (Thr-180/Tyr-182) MAPK antibodies (Cell Signaling Technologies). Goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin-horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as the secondary antibody. Proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Biosciences) or SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce). Blots were subsequently probed with a mouse anti-actin antibody (Sigma) to detect actin expression as a loading control. In some experiments, blots were also reprobed with a 1:1000 dilution of polyclonal anti-pan-ERK1/2, SAPK/JNK, or p38 MAPK antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). For activated MAPK protein expression, the intensities of the phosphorylated proteins were quantified using a GS-710 densitometer (Bio-Rad). The expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2, SAPK/JNK, or p38 after paclitaxel treatment is shown relative to their individual baseline expression levels.In Vitro Kinase Assay—Non-radioactive ERK, p38, and JNK kinase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Cell Signaling). Briefly, 20 μl of resuspended immobilized phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-p38 MAPK monoclonal antibody, or c-Jun fusion protein beads were incubated with 200 μg of total protein lysate with gentle rocking overnight at 4 °C. The next day, samples were microcentrifuged for 30 s at 4 °C. Pellets were washed twice with 500 μl of 1× lysis buffer and twice with 500 μl of 1× kinase buffer. Pellets were suspended in 50 μl of 1× kinase buffer supplemented with 100 μm ATP and 2 μg of ELK-1 fusion protein for ERK1/2 activity or 2 μg of ATF-2 fusion protein for p38 activity. The samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, and the reactions were terminated with 25 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer. The samples were then boiled for 5 min, vortexed, and microcentrifuged for 2 min. Samples were then loaded (30 μl) into a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were incubated with the corresponding phospho-specific antibodies against ELK-1, ATF-2, or c-Jun, respectively. Band intensities were quantified using a GS-710 densitometer (Bio-Rad), and the relative fold change at each time point following paclitaxel or Dex/paclitaxel treatment was compared with the untreated baseline signals.Apoptosis Assays—After transfection, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with either paclitaxel (10–7 m) alone or Dex (10–6 m)/paclitaxel for 8, 24, or 30 h. Cells were then fixed immediately by adding 500 μl of 37% formaldehyde to each well in a dropwise fashion and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The fixative solution was subsequently aspirated, and cells were allowed to dry overnight. To score for apoptosis, cells were stained with a 1 μm 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole/phosphate-buffered saline solution as described previously (12Moran T.J. Gray S. Mikosz C.A. Conzen S.D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 867-872PubMed Google Scholar). A Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope with UV illumination at 600× magnification was used to count at least 200 4′,6-diamidino-3-phenylindole-stained cells to determine the percentage of apoptotic cells per experimental condition. All apoptosis assays were performed independently three times to calculate the average percentage of apoptosis and the S.E. Statistical significance between two conditions in the apoptosis assays was determined by a one-sided t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant.Luciferase Reporter Assay—A 709-bp fragment of the human tPA gene (NM_000930) promoter containing an ELK-1 binding consensus site (GGAANNTTAA) (41Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4698-4706Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) (+76 nucleotide/+85 nucleotide) was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using a Kpn-1 restriction site (5′-GGGGTACCAGAGAAAGATTCTCCCTAAAATTAC-3′) and a BglII restriction site primer (5′-GAAGATCTCCCCAAGGTACAGAAACCCG-3′) and cloned into the pGL3 vector (a kind gift from Dr. Barbara Kee, University of Chicago) with Kpn-1 and BglII restriction enzymes. The fragment of the human tPA gene promoter was then mutated to introduce a single G to C substitution in the core of the ELK-1 binding consensus site (GCAANNTTAA) by site-directed mutagenesis (Quik-Change site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene) using the primers 5′-CCCCACCCCCTGCCTGCAAACTTAAAGGAGGCCGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCGGCCTCCTTTAAGTTTGCAGGCAGGGGGTGGGG-3′ (reverse). The mutation was validated by sequencing. MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with 2.5 μg of wild type tPA promoter firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL3-wt tPA), mutant plasmid (pGL3-mut tPA), or pGL3 vector alone together with 0.5 μg of a pCMV-β-galactosidase-encoding vector (gift of Dr. Geoffrey Greene, University of Chicago). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were treated either with vehicle (100% ethanol) or Dex (10–6 m) 1 h prior to paclitaxel (10–7 m)in serum-free medium for 6 h. After removing the culture media and rinsing twice with 1× PBS, 500 μl of 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega) was added to the plates, which were then shaken at room temperature for 15 min. Luminescence was measured using a Wallace luminescence counter (Beckman), and β-galactosidase activity was measured at 420 nm. The experiments were done three times. The relative luciferase activity in each condition was normalized to β-galactosidase activity and reported as an average ± S.E.RESULTSInduction of MKP-1 following GR Activation in Mammary Epithelial Cells—As reported in many cell types (25Lasa M.

Pang D. Karrison T. Conzen S.D. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1757-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Gene array analysis of MCF10A-Myc cells showed that MKP-1 gene expression increases initially at 30 min and is up-regulated ∼3-fold from 2 to 24 h (Fig. 1A, solid line). Microarray data also demonstrated that the induction of MKP-1 mRNA by Dex is reversed by the partial GR-agonist/antagonist RU486 (Fig. 1A, dashed line). To validate the microarray data, we performed a Northern blot analysis of MKP-1 mRNA expression from MCF10A-Myc cells treated with Dex. As shown in Fig. 1B, MKP-1 mRNA expression was up-regulated 3-fold relative to vehicle-treated ce"

In this study, we aimed at characterizing the role of SOCS5 in the negative regulation of EGFR. Here we show that the expression of SOCS5 and its closest homolog SOCS4 is elevated in cells following treatment with EGF, similar to several negative feedback regulators of EGFR whose expression is up-regulated upon receptor activation. The expression of SOCS5 led to a marked reduction in EGFR expression levels by promoting EGFR degradation.

A balance of both positive and negative signals is critical for proper cell function, and its deregulation is often implicated in the development of human diseases (1Dikic I. Giordano S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Removal of activated EGFR-ligand complexes from the cell surface by endocytosis and their subsequent degradation in the lysosome is the main process for the attenuation of signaling processes initiated by activated receptors (2Waterman H. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). ErbB receptors that show decreased down-regulation following ligand stimulation have been shown to possess increased and prolonged signaling capacity (3Waterman H. Katz M. Rubin C. Shtiegman K. Lavi S. Elson A. Jovin T. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 4Wells A. Welsh J.B. Lazar C.S. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1990; 247: 962-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). A key component in the negative regulation of EGFR signaling is the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl. Following EGF stimulation, EGFR is phosphorylated and c-Cbl binds to a phosphorylated tyrosine residue of the receptor (5Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I.

Druker B. Band H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Elson A. Jovin T. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Subsequently, c-Cbl itself is phosphorylated and, as a result, can mediate the ubiquitylation of the EGFR and promote receptor degradation (5Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1029-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). c-Cbl can associate with and ubiquitylate the receptor at the plasma membrane (8Stang E. Johannessen L.E. Knardal S.L. Madshus I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13940-13947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar); however, c-Cbl remains associated with the EGFR throughout the endocytic pathway, resulting in prolonged ubiquitylation of the receptor and thus its enhanced degradation (9de Melker A.A. van der Horst G. Calafat J. Jansen H. Borst J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2167-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Indeed, ubiquitylation of the EGFR is sufficient to serve as a signal for internalization and recent reports demonstrate that attachment in-frame of ubiquitin to EGFR results in constitutive internalization and enhanced degradation of the chimeric protein (11Haglund K. Sigismund S. Polo S. Szymkiewicz I. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 12Mosesson Y. Shtiegman K. Katz M. Zwang Y. Vereb G. Szollosi J. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21323-21326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In addition to c-Cbl, other proteins take part in the negative regulation of RTKs. Among these proteins are the suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS), a family of proteins initially identified as negative regulators of cytokine signaling. The SOCS family consists of eight intracellular proteins (SOCS1–7 and the cytokine-induced Src homology-2 (SH2) protein). SOCS proteins contain a central SH2 domain, an amino-terminal domain of variable length and divergent sequence, and a carboxyl-terminal 40 amino acid sequence known as the SOCS box (SB) (reviewed in Ref. 13Alexander W.S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 410-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). In addition to the SOCS family of proteins, ∼40 additional proteins have been identified that contain a SB and protein-protein interaction motifs other than SH2 domains (14Kile B.T. Schulman B.A. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Martin H.M. Hilton D.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 235-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). SOCS proteins utilize various mechanisms to attenuate signaling. First, they can compete with STATs for binding sites on activated cytokine receptors. Second, SOCS proteins can bind JAKs to inhibit their tyrosine kinase activity. Third, SOCS proteins can utilize their SOCS box to recruit an E3 ubiquitin ligase protein complex, which targets SOCS-associated proteins for proteasomal degradation (13Alexander W.S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 410-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). For example, following stimulation with cytokines, SOCS1 can undergo SH2 domain-mediated binding to phosphorylated tyrosine residues of activated JAK2. When bound to JAK2, SOCS1 can recruit ElonginC through the SOCS box and ElonginC binds ElonginB, a protein that contains a ubiquitin-like domain (15Zhang J.G. Farley A. Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A. Zugaro L.M. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Cary D. Richardson R. Hausmann G. Kile B.J. Kent S.B. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Baca M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2071-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The ElonginBC complex interacts with a Cullin family member, which binds to a small ring finger protein, Roc/Rbx1 (16Kamura T. Burian D. Yan Q. Schmidt S.L. Lane W.S. Querido E. Branton P.E. Shilatifard A. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29748-29753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Together, the SOCS-ElonginBC-Cullin-Roc complex has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity with the substrate recognition function fulfilled by the SOCS protein and the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity fulfilled by Roc1. In the presence of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) and a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), the E3 complex can transfer polyubiquitin chains to its substrate JAK2, resulting in JAK degradation by the proteasome (14Kile B.T.

Accumulating evidence indicates a role for SOCS proteins in the regulation of signaling pathways other than cytokine receptors. Recent reports suggest a regulatory role for SOCS proteins in focal adhesion kinase, insulin receptor, and EGFR signaling (18Liu E. Cote J.F. Vuori K.

Expression of SOCS proteins, including SOCS1 and SOCS3, is enhanced by EGF treatment, and SOCS3 is also phosphorylated following EGF treatment (20Cacalano N.A. Sanden D. Johnston J.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 21Xia L. Wang L. Chung A.S. Ivanov S.S. Ling M.Y. Dragoi A.M. Platt A. Gilmer T.M. Fu X.Y. Chin Y.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30716-30723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). SOCS3 phosphorylation is required for its association with the Ras inhibitor p120RasGAP, and this association ablates the inhibitory role of p120RasGAP and promotes activation of the Ras/ERK cascade. SOCS1 and SOCS3 physically associate with EGFR and reduce EGF-mediated STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation (21Xia L. Wang L. Chung A.S. Ivanov S.S. Ling M.Y. Dragoi A.M. Platt A. Gilmer T.M. Fu X.Y. Chin Y.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30716-30723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Additional signaling molecules, such as the insulin receptor substrate proteins and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav1, are also regulated by SOCS family members that mediate the degradation of these substrates (22Rui L. Yuan M. Frantz D. Shoelson S. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42394-42398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 23De Sepulveda P. Ilangumaran S. Rottapel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14005-14008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). SOCS genes have also been identified in Drosophila melanogaster as well as in Caenorhabditis elegans. Worms lack a JAK ortholog, again suggesting a role for SOCS proteins in the regulation of signaling pathways other than cytokine signal transduction (14Kile B.T. Schulman B.A. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Martin H.M. Hilton D.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 235-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). One of the three predicted Drosophila SOCS family members, SOCS36E, has been implicated as a regulator of DER, the Drosophila EGFR ortholog. SOCS36E is most similar to mammalian SOCS5 in its SH2 and SOCS box domains, although its amino terminus is unique and shows no significant homology to vertebrate SOCS proteins. The expression of SOCS36E in the Drosophila embryo results in phenotypes in the adult fly that are consistent with defects in JAK/STAT or EGFR signaling and are exacerbated in flies heterozygous for either D-jak (hopscotch), D-stat (stat92e), or DER (24Callus B.A. Mathey-Prevot B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4812-4821Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In an attempt to further characterize the outcome and regulation of EGFR signaling, microarray analysis was performed to identify genes whose expression is altered upon stimulation of cells with EGF. We detected increased expression of several genes implicated in the regulation of EGFR signaling, such as various mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases and the transmembrane protein LRIG1 (25Gur G. Rubin C. Katz M. Amit I. Citri A. Nilsson J. Amariglio N. Henriksson R. Rechavi G. Hedman H. Wides R. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3270-3281Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In addition, we observed up-regulation of SOCS5 as well as its closest homolog, SOCS4, upon treatment with EGF, which led us to study the role of SOCS proteins in the regulation of EGFR signaling. Here we show that SOCS5 functions to enhance the degradation of EGFR in a ligand- and c-Cbl-independent manner. Both the SH2 and SB domains of SOCS5 are required for EGFR degradation. Furthermore, we show that, in an SH2 domain and SB-dependent manner, enhanced SOCS5 expression results in the translocation of EGFR to intracellular vesicles and in the attenuation of EGF-induced signaling. These results are discussed in the context of an emerging picture regarding the homeostatic machinery that regulates RTK levels.

Ron (Technion, Haifa, Israel), respectively. Cell Culture and Transfection—CHO cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with a penicillin-streptomycin mixture (100 units/ml), 2 mm l-glutamine, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. HEK-293T, HeLa, and COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with a penicillin-streptomycin mixture (100 units/ml), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10% serum. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine for CHO cells, JET-PEI for COS cells, and the calcium-phosphate method for HEK-293T and HeLa cells. The total amount of DNA in each transfection was normalized with pcDNA3 or pEF empty vectors. For inducible expression of SOCS5, HEK-293-EcR cells stably expressing the pVgRXR vector were co-transfected with pInd-SOCS5 along with a puromycin resistance-encoding vector. 24 h after transfection, cells were incubated in puromycin-containing medium (1 μg/ml). Muristerone (2 μm) was then added to the cells for the indicated time intervals for induction of SOCS5 expression. Lysate Preparation, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting Analyses—48 h after transfection, cells were washed briefly with ice-cold saline and lysed (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 30 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, and a protease inhibitor mixture). For direct electrophoretic analysis, gel sample buffer was added to cleared cell lysates. For EGFR immunoprecipitation, lysates were incubated with anti-EGFR mAbs precoupled to anti-mouse IgG-agarose beads. FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG-agarose beads, and SOCS5 was immunoprecipitated with anti-SOCS5 goat antibodies precoupled to protein G-Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with HNTG (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and electrophoretically transferred to a nitro-cellulose membrane prior to Western blot analysis. Quantitative Real-time PCR—cDNA was synthesized from total RNA isolated from HeLa cells using 250 ng of random primers, 3 μg of total RNA, 1 μl of 10 mm dNTP, 4 μl of 5× first-strand buffer, 2 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, and 1 μl of ribonuclease inhibitor RNaseOUT (40 units/μl) and 1 μl (200 units) of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the protocol recommended by Invitrogen. The following primers were used: Socs2 (forward, 5′-GCTCGGTCAGACAGGATGGT-3′; reverse, 5′-TTGGCTTCATTAACAGTCATACTTCC-3′); Socs4 (forward, 5′-CACTCTTCAGGGCTTCCGTC-3′; reverse, 5′-AGGCTAAATCTGATCGAGGTGG-3′); and Socs5 (forward, 5′-ATCTGGAGACAGCCATACCCA-3′; reverse, 5′-CAAATCAGGCACGAGGCAGT-3′). Quantification of cDNA targets was performed on ABI Prism 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), utilizing the SDS 2.1 software. All of the reactions were run in duplicates, and transcripts were detected using SYBR Green I according to manufacturer instructions and normalized to β-actin as an internal control. Optimal reaction conditions for amplification of the target genes were performed according to manufacturer's (Applied Biosystems) recommendation. STAT3 Transcription Assays—Cells grown in 100-mm plates were transfected with GFP- and SOCS-encoding vectors along with a STAT3-luciferase plasmid containing a STAT3 response element fused to a luciferase reporter gene. 24 h later, the cells were split into 24-well plates. 12 h later, the cells were serum-starved for 12 h and then treated with EGF (20 ng/ml) for 5.5 h or left untreated. The luciferase reporter assay was performed using a Promega luciferase assay system (Madison, WI). Light intensity was measured using a luminometer, and the results were normalized to GFP expression levels. Metabolic Labeling of Cellular Proteins—36 h after transfection, CHO cells were rinsed twice and incubated for 12 h in cysteine- and methionine-free medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed serum and a mixture of 35S-labeled amino acids (pulse). The labeling medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with non-radioactive amino acids, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for various time intervals prior to extraction in lysis buffer (chase). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation and subjected to immunoprecipitation followed by electrophoresis, signal amplification, and autoradiography. Immunofluorescence—Transfected HeLa cells grown on coverslips were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed for 15 min (3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline), and then washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline. Thereafter, the cells were mounted in Mowiol and analyzed using a confocal Zeiss microscope with a 63X/1.4 plane Apochromat objective attached to a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 laser-scanning system. Construction of Expression Vectors—pcDNA3-based expression vectors encoding EGFR, ErbB-2, ErbB-4, and the Y1045F point mutant of EGFR were described previously (5Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1029-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). pEF vectors encoding FLAG-SOCS4, FLAG-SOCS2, FLAG-SOCS3, FLAG-SOCS5, and FLAG-SOCS6 were a kind gift from Dr. Paulo De Sepulveda (INSERM, Marseille, France). SOCS5 expression vectors containing point mutations, namely R406K, ΔSB (L469stop), and LC-to-PF (L484P,C488F), were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the pEF-FLAG-SOCS5 vector. pInd-FLAG-SOCS5 was generated by PCR amplification of FLAG-SOCS5 from the pEF vector. The resulting PCR product was digested with HindIII and XhoI and cloned into pInd. The following plasmids were kind gifts. STAT3-response element luciferase reporter plasmid was from A. Gertler (the Hebrew University's Faculty of Agriculture, Rehovot, Israel), pcDNA3-FGFR1 was from D. Ron (the Technion, Haifa, Israel), pcDNA3-p75-NGFR was from M. Fainzilber (The Weizmann Institute, Rehovot, Israel), hemagglutinin-ubiquitin was from D. Bohmann (the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany), pCEFL/Myc-Cbl was from S. Lipkowitz (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), and pEF-FLAG-ElonginB and pEF-Myc-ElonginC were from N. Nicola (Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, Australia). The Expression of SOCS5 Is Enhanced by EGF—The expression of multiple negative regulators of signaling through RTKs is induced upon growth factor stimulation. This reflects evolutionary conserved feedback loops aimed at homeostatic regulation (27Shilo B.Z. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 140-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Notably, a recent report by Cacalano et al. (20Cacalano N.A. Sanden D. Johnston J.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) showed that treatment of cells with growth factors such as EGF and platelet-derived growth factor induces a rapid elevation in SOCS3 expression. Thus, we examined the effects of EGF treatment on the expression of SOCS family members. In a microarray analysis in which RNA from EGF-treated cells was used, an elevation in both Socs3 and Socs5 mRNA levels was detected 20–40 min following EGF stimulation. Soon after, Socs3 and Socs5 mRNA levels returned to basal levels (Fig. 1A). No expression or change in expression was detected for other SOCS proteins included in the microarrays, specifically Socs1, Socs7, Cis, and Socs2 (Fig. 1A and data not shown). To confirm the results obtained in the microarray, the expression of several SOCS family members was also analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. The expression of Socs5 and Socs2 as well as Socs4, which was not present on the microarray chip, was analyzed using RNA from EGF-treated cells (Fig. 1B). We detected an 8-fold increase in the expression of Socs5 following EGF stimulation. The higher induction detected by RT-PCR is attributable to the relatively high sensitivity of detection as compared with the microarray analysis. Interestingly, the expression of Socs4 was also increased in a pattern similar to that of Socs5. Although the expression of Socs2 was not altered upon EGF treatment in the microarray analysis using real-time PCR, a 2-fold increase was observed following 60 min of stimulation with EGF. Analysis of SOCS5 expression at the protein level revealed detectable expression prior to EGF stimulation; however, its expression increased following stimulation as did the expression of SOCS3 (Fig. 1C). Taken together, the results presented in Fig. 1 indicate that activation of EGFR results in elevated expression of SOCS3 as well as SOCS4 and SOCS5. SOCS5 Reduces the Expression of EGFR—Various SOCS proteins can mediate the degradation of tyrosine kinases such as JAK and focal adhesion kinase, and as a result terminate downstream signaling events (17Ungureanu D.

As the data shown in Fig. 1 demonstrate that the expression of several SOCS proteins is elevated following EGF stimulation, we examined whether these proteins would affect EGFR expression levels. These analyses were performed by co-transfection of plasmids encoding EGFR and SOCS into CHO cells, which lack endogenous EGFR. Interestingly, EGFR levels were significantly reduced only in cells co-expressing SOCS5 or its closest homolog, SOCS4, irrespective of EGF treatment and despite the relatively low levels of ectopic SOCS5 expression (Fig. 2A). Expression of other SOCS proteins including cytokine-induced SH2 (CIS), SOCS2, SOCS3, and SOCS6 did not alter EGFR expression (Fig. 2A). Because EGF stimulation results in the phosphorylation of SOCS3 (20Cacalano N.A. Sanden D. Johnston J.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), we examined the phosphorylation of SOCS family members following EGF stimulation. SOCS2, 3, 5, and 6 all underwent tyrosine phosphorylation following EGF stimulation, but no tyrosine phosphorylation of SOCS4 was detectable (Figs. 2B and 6C). Notably, the expression of either SOCS4 or SOCS5 leads to a reduction in EGFR expression levels (Fig. 2A) but only SOCS5 undergoes ligand-induced phosphorylation, raising the possibility that down-regulation of EGFR requires no EGF-induced phosphorylation of the respective SOCS protein.Fig. 6Both the SH2 and SB domains are necessary for SOCS5-induced degradation of EGFR.A, HEK-293T cells were transfected with an EGFR-encoding plasmid or an empty control vector along with a SOCS5-encoding plasmid. 48 h after transfection, the cells were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with MG132 (10 μm). The cells were then lysed and their lysates were subjected to analyses with the indicated antibodies. B, COS7 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding Myc-ElonginC (EloC) and the indicated combination of FLAG-SOCS5 and FLAG-ElonginB (EloB) expression vectors. 48 h after transfection, the cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with MG132 (10 μm). The cells were then lysed and the lysates were subjected to analyses with the indicated antibodies. C, COS7 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding puromycin resistance along with each of the indicated SOCS5 plasmids. 24 h after transfection, the cells were transferred to puromycin-containing medium (2 μg/ml) for 36 h, serum-starved for 12 h, and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C without or with EGF (100 ng/ml). Thereafter, the cells were lysed and the lysates were subjected to analyses with the indicated antibodies. D, CHO cells were transfected with a hemagglutinin (HA)-ubiquitin (Ub) and EGFR-encoding plasmids along with a SOCS5-encoding plasmid or a control empty vector. 24 h after transfection, the cells were incubated for 17 h at 37 °C with MG132. Thereafter, the cells were lysed and the lysates were subjected to analyses with the indicated antibodies. The location of ubiquitylated EGFR is indicated.

Prolonged molecular dynamics simulation of ACh-binding protein showed that binding of ACh establishes close register of Trps from adjacent subunits, Trp143 and Trp53, and draws the peripheral C-loop inward to occlude the entrance to the binding cavity. Close register of Trp143 and Trp53 was demonstrated by ACh-mediated quenching of intrinsic Trp fluorescence, elimination of quenching by mutation of one or both Trps to Phe, and decreased lifetime of Trp fluorescence by bound ACh. Occlusion of the binding cavity by the C-loop was demonstrated by restricted access of an extrinsic quencher of binding site Trp fluorescence by ACh.

Chemical signaling throughout the organism is initiated by molecular recognition of small biomolecules by receptor binding sites. Recognition is accompanied by conformational changes of the binding site, through induced fit, selection of pre-existing conformers, or a combination of the two, and these are amplified over distance and time to produce the biological response. In the case of rapidly gated synaptic receptors, the amplification propagates within the receptor macromolecule itself and occurs within as little as tens of microseconds (1Sine S.M. J. Neurobiol. 2002; 53: 431-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Structural counterparts of the initial recognition step likely evolved to provide this close spatial and temporal coupling. To understand the initial recognition step in rapidly gated synaptic receptors, we examined conformational changes due to agonist occupancy in AChBP, 1The abbreviations used are: AChBP, acetylcholine-binding protein; ACh, acetylcholine; MD, molecular dynamics; CCh, carbamylcholine.1The abbreviations used are: AChBP, acetylcholine-binding protein; ACh, acetylcholine; MD, molecular dynamics; CCh, carbamylcholine. a prototype of the nicotinic receptor ligand binding domain (2Smit A.B.

Although a complete atomic structure has not been determined for any member of the superfamily, atomic resolution data recently emerged for AChBP (3Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V.

MD simulation revealed asymmetric relaxation of the AChBP homopentamer without ACh bound, but maintenance of the symmetrical structure with ACh bound. Differences between the ACh-free and ACh-bound structures revealed conformational changes linked to agonist occupancy. Conformational changes predicted by simulation were verified by measurements of intrinsic Trp fluorescence, showing that binding of ACh establishes close register of two Trp side chains from opposing subunits and draws the peripheral C-loop inward to occlude the entrance of the binding cavity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMolecular Docking and Dynamics Simulation—We used the AMBER 7 program (13Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Cheatham T.E. Debolt S. Ferguson D. Seibel G. Kollman P. Comp. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 1-41Crossref Scopus (2628) Google Scholar) to conduct molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of AChBP in the presence of explicit solvent molecules at room temperature, without ACh bound or with ACh bound to one, two, or all five binding sites. Atomic coordinates of AChBP (3Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar) were downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (Protein Data Bank code 1I9B). To prepare the protein structure for docking and MD simulation, water, ions, and HEPES were first removed from the crystal structure. Partial atomic charges were then assigned to each atom of the protein using the restrained electrostatic potential charge model of the AMBER7 program. The crystal structure of ACh was used to prepare the ligand for docking. Partial atomic charges of ACh were obtained from electrostatic potential fitted charges from the HF/6-31* quantum mechanics calculation. The AUTODOCK 3.0.3 program (14Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comp. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (8960) Google Scholar), which uses the Lamarkian genetic algorithm, was employed for docking simulation (grid sizes were 40 × 40 × 40, and grid spacing was 0.375 Å). The simulation yielded 10 docked conformations of ACh, of which the predominant conformation was chosen as the orientation in the binding site.AChBP without ACh or with one (at the interface of subunits c and d), two (at the interfaces of subunits c and d and subunits e and a), or five sites occupied was then solvated in a water box. The TIP3P model for water molecules was used, and the box was extended at least 10 Å in each direction from the solute. Na+ and Cl- counter ions were added to neutralize the system by employing the LEAP module of the AMBER 7 program (parm 99 force field included). The system was energy minimized, followed by a 30-ps heating step to 298 K, and the Particle Mesh Ewald method was employed to calculate long-range electrostatic interactions. After the heating step, the system was maintained at 298 K, and MD simulation out to 45 ns was computed at 2.0-fs intervals, with frames collected every 1.0 ps. During the simulation, the SHAKE algorithm was turned on to constrain bonds involving hydrogen atoms, and the non-bonded interaction cutoff was set to 8.0 Å.Plasmids and Mutagenesis—The previously described synthetic cDNA encoding AChBP (11Hansen S.B.

Point mutations were constructed using the QuikChange kit from Stratagene. The final AChBP construct and all mutations were confirmed by automated dye terminator sequencing.Expression and Purification of AChBP and Mutants—293 HEK cells were transfected with wild-type or mutant subunit cDNAs using calcium phosphate precipitation (15Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Three days after transfection, wildtype or mutant AChBP secreted into the culture medium was collected with the addition of protease inhibitors (5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.002 mm aprotinin, and 0.01 mm pepstatin A), and the protein was purified by passing the medium through a minicolumn with anti-MF2 coupled to an agarose gel (Sigma-Aldrich). The purified protein was obtained by elution with the FLAG peptide (100 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and further purified by fast protein liquid chromatography using a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) with Tris buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), and it was finally concentrated to the micromolar range using the Centricon YM-10 (Millipore).Tryptophan Fluorescence Measurements—Protein samples in Tris buffer (pH 7.4) were stored on ice and placed in a 3 × 3-mm cuvette for fluorescence measurements. All measurements were performed at 4 °C. Steady-state fluorescence was measured on a PTI fluorescence spectrometer (PTI, London, Ontario, Canada). Samples were excited at 298 ± 2 nm, and the emission spectrum was measured with 4-nm bandwidth resolution at wavelengths between 310 and 370 nm. The fluorescence intensity collected at 342 nm was used for analysis. For ligand titration experiments, the effects of dilution were corrected by titration of buffer into an identical sample of the protein.Time-resolved fluorescence intensity decay was measured on a timedomain analog lifetime instrument with flash lamp excitation (PTI). Tryptophans were excited at 298 ± 2 nm, and emission was collected over a 32-nm bandwidth centered at 335 nm. The fluorescence intensity decays were fitted by convoluting the observed lamp flash profile with an exponential fitting function of the form, F(t) = ΣiAiexp[-t/τi], where t is time, Ai is the decay amplitude, and τi is the lifetime for the ith component (16Badea M.G. Brand L. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 61: 378-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Best fits were located using a nonlinear least squares protocol. We verified instrument calibration using N-acetyltryptophanamide, which has a 3-ns lifetime, in 0.1 m sodium phosphate at pH 7 and 20 °C (17Samanta U. Pal D. Chakrabarti P. Acta Crystallogr. 1999; D55: 1421-1427Google Scholar). The observed N-acetyltryptophanamide lifetime was 2.95 ± 0.3 ns.RESULTSTo delineate atomic-scale conformational changes associated with molecular recognition of ACh, we conducted MD simulations of AChBP in the presence of explicit water molecules and counter ions, either with or without ACh bound to the five binding sites. We generated the ACh-bound structure by computational docking of ACh to the AChBP crystal structure (3Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar) and obtained a highly similar orientation of ACh compared with that of carbamylcholine (CCh) in complex with AChBP (4Celie P.H. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. van Dijk W.J. Brejc K. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Neuron. 2004; 41: 907-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Simulations out to 45 ns reveal clear ACh-dependent differences in the dynamics of local structural motifs at the ACh binding site, as well as differences distributed throughout the structure (Fig. 1A). With ACh bound, the hairpin joining β strands 9 and 10, known as the C-loop, occludes the entrance to the binding cavity, whereas without ACh, the C-loop moves away, opening up the cavity (Fig. 1B). The outward movement of the C-loop shows asymmetry across both space and time; it moves in two of the five subunits during the 45-ns simulation (subunits c and e), motion occurs in non-adjacent subunits, and the two C-loops move at different times. The analysis also reveals remarkably little motion of the global structure with ACh bound, as indicated by the preponderance of blue hues associated with little change from the initial 5-fold symmetrical structure (Fig. 1A). Thus, binding of ACh maintains an overall symmetrical conformation of AChBP, but without ACh, local regions, particularly the C-loop, relax asymmetrically.Conformations of the C-loop with and without ACh are compared with the conformation in the crystal structure of AChBP with CCh bound (Fig. 1C). After 45 ns of simulation with ACh bound, the conformation of the C-loop is similar to that in the crystal structure of the CCh-bound complex. However, without ACh, the simulation reveals a large outward displacement of the C-loop compared with the ACh-bound structure; this displacement is much larger than that suggested by comparison of C-loop conformations in the HEPES- and CCh-bound crystal structures (4Celie P.H. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. van Dijk W.J. Brejc K. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Neuron. 2004; 41: 907-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). The ACh-free structure obtained by simulation shows substantial disengagement of the disulfide-bonded cysteines, Cys187 and Cys188, and the conserved Tyr185 of the C-loop from the quaternary ammonium moiety of ACh (Fig. 1C).We looked further for global structural changes by computing radius of gyration as a function of time for each subunit relative to the central vestibule (Figs. 2, A and B). The radius of gyration, calculated as displacement in the plane perpendicular to an axis passing through the central vestibule, measures the breathing motion of AChBP. With ACh bound to all five binding sites, the subunits show only small fluctuations in radius of gyration. However without ACh bound, the subunits that showed motion of the C-loop increase radius of gyration, whereas the intervening subunit shows a decrease. By mapping distances between α carbon atoms and the central axis on the surface of the structure, changes in radius of gyration are seen to result from movement of local regions, rather than bulk movement of the subunit (Fig. 2C). These motions include outward displacement of the C-loop of non-adjacent subunits and inward displacement of the β8-β9 linker of the intervening subunit. The map further confirms that bound ACh restrains motion of the overall structure.Fig. 2Change in radius of gyration of each subunit of AChBP after MD simulation. A, radius of gyration (Rg=(∑​miri2/∑​mi)1/2), where mi is mass of the atom, and ri is the distance of the atom from the central axis) of each subunit from a to e is plotted against simulation time without ACh bound. B, radius of gyration of each subunit is plotted against simulation time with five ACh bound. C, changes in displacement of each α carbon atom from the central axis, relative to the crystal structure (3Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar), are mapped on a surface representation of the opened up AChBP pentamer. Results from the last 5 ns of the 45-ns simulation are averaged and color-coded with blue for inward and red for outward displacement.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To examine how conformation of the C-loop depends on the extent of ACh occupancy, we carried out simulations with either one or two binding sites occupied by ACh (Fig. 3A). With one binding site occupied, the C-loops change conformation as if no ACh is bound; C-loops in two non-adjacent subunits again move outward at different times. Inward motion of the β8-β9 linker in subunit a is also seen, analogous to but somewhat greater than observed in subunit d in the ACh-free simulation (Fig. 1A). With two binding sites occupied, motion of the C-loop is highly restricted in all five subunits, similar to occupancy of all five binding sites. Thus, the restriction of C-loop motion by ACh shows allostery because occupancy of one binding site is not sufficient to restrict motion at that site, but rather occupancy of two physically separate binding sites is required. The structural changes accompanying this allosteric effect include outward motion of the C-loop (subunits c and e), inward motion of the β8-β9 linker (subunit d), and smaller motions distributed throughout the subunits (Figs. 1, 2, 3).Fig. 3MD simulation of AChBP with one and two ACh bound. A, absolute value of the distance change of each α carbon atom relative to the AChBP crystal structure is indicated by color, from blue (no change) to red (large change), as a function of simulation time and residue number of each subunit (a-e). B, superposition of ribbon structures of subunit e from 45-ns simulation with one ACh bound (brown) and subunit c with two ACh bound (blue). C, superposition of α carbons of the subunit with an “opened up” C-loop in the crystal structure with one CCh bound (brown) and a subunit from the crystal structure with two CCh bound (blue). Arrows indicate range of motion of the C-loop.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We sought to confirm the allosteric effect by comparing AChBP crystal structures (4Celie P.H. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. van Dijk W.J. Brejc K. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Neuron. 2004; 41: 907-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar) with one or two molecules of CCh bound (Protein Data Bank code 1UV6). In the AChBP pentamer with two molecules of CCh bound, all five C-loops are in the inward conformation shown in Fig. 1C. Although not mentioned by Celie et al. (4Celie P.H. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. van Dijk W.J. Brejc K. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Neuron. 2004; 41: 907-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), in the complex with one CCh bound, one of the C-loops extends outward, away from the binding cleft, similar to our ACh-free structure after 45 ns of simulation (Fig. 1C), whereas the other C-loops are in the inward conformation of the HEPES- or CCh-bound structures. Thus, our MD simulations independently confirm the allostery suggested by crystal structures with one and two bound agonists. We then superimposed crystal structures of the subunit with the C-loop in the outward conformation and a subunit containing bound CCh (Fig. 3C) and compared that with superimposed ACh-free and ACh-bound structures obtained by simulation (Fig. 3B). The comparison shows a similar range of motion of the C-loop between the crystal structures and our simulated structures. Thus, simulation with one and two molecules of ACh bound reveals allosteric conformational changes of the C-loop that mirror those in the corresponding crystal structures.Because little structural change is seen elsewhere in the subunit, the allosteric effect due to agonist occupancy appears to originate with conformational change of the C-loop. New contacts formed when the C-loop tilts inward include aromatic-quaternary and van der Waals contacts with the agonist, as well as hydrogen bonding between Ser186 of the C-loop and Glu163 of the β8-β9 linker of the adjacent subunit. More wide-spread conformational changes are expected to accompany the allosteric effects due to agonist occupancy, requiring even more prolonged MD simulation and analyses of the trajectory.We next focused on the aromatic-rich ACh binding cavity and examined dynamics of two conserved Trp residues, Trp143 and Trp53. These Trps are located deep in the binding cavity and project toward each other from adjacent subunits (Fig. 4A). Analogous Trps are found at binding sites of every subtype and species of nicotinic receptor, indicating they are essential for binding ACh. The distance between closest carbon atoms on the indole rings of Trp143 and Trp53 remains around 3.3 Å throughout the simulations of both ACh-free and ACh-bound structures (data not shown). However, the angle defined by the planes of the two indole rings fluctuates considerably without ACh and becomes fixed at around 90° with ACh bound (Fig. 4, B and C). This edge-to-face stacking is observed for many Trp-Trp pairs in structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (17Samanta U. Pal D. Chakrabarti P. Acta Crystallogr. 1999; D55: 1421-1427Google Scholar). Thus, binding of ACh maintains close register of these two principal components of the binding site, but without ACh, conformational mobility of the indole side chains increases.Fig. 4Orientation of indole side chains of Trp143 and Trp53 from opposing subunits depends on ACh occupancy. A, indole side chains from opposing subunits are displayed. B, the angle formed by planes passing through the two indole rings is plotted against simulation time for AChBP without ACh bound. C, results for simulation with five ACh bound.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To look for experimental counterparts of the conformational changes observed by MD simulation, we measured intrinsic Trp fluorescence of AChBP in solution, with and without ACh. The initial studies asked whether tryptophans Trp143 and Trp53, among five Trps per subunit, are responsible for ACh-dependent quenching of intrinsic Trp fluorescence (11Hansen S.B. Radic Z. Talley T.T. Molles B.E. Deerinck T. Tsigelny I. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41299-41302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, we generated pure AChBP, the mutants W53F and W143F, and the corresponding double mutant and measured steady-state fluorescence as a function of ACh concentration. ACh quenches about 35% of the total Trp fluorescence of wild-type AChBP, with the concentration dependence of quenching well described by occupancy of a single binding site (Fig. 5). However, ACh fails to quench intrinsic Trp fluorescence when Phe is substituted for either Trp53 or Trp143 but rather enhances fluorescence about 10-20% in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5). When Phe is substituted for both Trp53 and Trp143, ACh neither quenches nor enhances fluorescence. Thus, ACh-mediated quenching of Trp fluorescence originates from interaction between Trp143 and Trp53.Fig. 5Steady-state fluorescence change after addition of ACh to wild-type AChBP and the mutants W53F and W143F. All fluorescence intensities are corrected for dilution due to addition of ACh. Intensity change is normalized according to the following formula: F = (FACh - F0)/(Fmax - F0), in which FACh is the observed fluorescence intensity for a given concentration of ACh, F0 is fluorescence before addition of ACh, and Fmax is the asymptotic fluorescence intensity when the concentration of ACh approaches infinity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Time-resolved fluorescence is a highly sensitive indicator of protein conformational change involving a fluorophore and quencher, such as the pair of intrinsic binding site Trps in AChBP. Quenching results from changes in electronic configurations of ground or excited states of the interacting Trps, and these can be distinguished with changes in fluorescence amplitude or lifetime. Perturbation of the ground state alters the amplitude of fluorescence relaxation, whereas perturbation of the excited state alters the decay rate (18Birks J.B. Photophysics of Aromatic Molecules. Wiley-Interscience, London1970: 403-491Google Scholar). Measurements of time-resolved fluorescence reveal that binding of ACh to wild-type AChBP shortens Trp lifetime, but lifetime is unaltered when Phe is substituted for either Trp53 or Trp143 (Fig. 6, A-C; Table I). In all cases, a single relaxation is observed, even though three additional Trps remote from the binding site are present; fluorescence decay of the nonbinding site Trps cannot be distinguished as distinct components and likely falls into the 2-3-ns range observed for the overall decay. Thus, in wild-type AChBP, ACh promotes interaction between Trp53 and Trp143 that quenches fluorescence through an excited state mechanism.Fig. 6Time-resolved fluorescence decay for wild-type AChBP and the mutants W53F and W143F with and without ACh (10 mm).

Open table in a new tab Among possible excited state quenching mechanisms, proton transfer is least likely because it requires precise alignment and van der Waals contact of the amide groups of the two Trps. Electron transfer, on the other hand, is the most likely mechanism because it occurs through space and is sensitive to separation distance and orientation of the interacting fluorophores (19Yang H. Luo G. Karnchanaphanurach P. Louie T.-M. Rech I. Cova S. Xun L. Xie X.S. Science. 2003; 302: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 20Marcus R.A. Sutin N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 811: 265-322Crossref Scopus (7663) Google Scholar). The basic conditions for observing electron transfer, as well as for a change in the rate of transfer on binding ACh, are accommodated by our MD simulation of AChBP; the two indole rings are highly mobile in the unbound state, but they maintain close register with ACh bound (Fig. 4).For both Phe mutants, ACh enhances fluorescence in a concentration-dependent manner but causes negligible change in fluorescence lifetime. These observations suggest that when ACh binds to each mutant AChBP, a conformational change occurs that affects ground-state electronic configurations of Trp143 and Trp53, enhancing fluorescence. This conformational change is likely analogous to that which produces fluorescence quenching when both Trp143 and Trp53 are present. However, in the Phe mutants, electron transfer quenching of Trp fluorescence is not observed because of disparate energies of Phe and Trp excited states.MD simulation reveals that (a) ACh maintains close register of the Trp pair deep in the binding cleft and (b) ACh draws the C-loop inward to occlude the entrance to the binding cavity. To obtain experimental evidence for conformational change of the C-loop, we used the pair of binding site Trps as reporters of binding cavity occlusion, and we measured Trp fluorescence in the presence of the Stern-Volmer collisional quencher acrylamide (21L"

When the cells were exposed to hyperosmotic stress, an absence of HSP70 negatively affected cell viability. Caspase-9 and caspase-3 were rapidly activated, and extensive cleavage occurred in focal adhesion and cytoskeletal molecules in the hsp70.1–/–MEFs. In contrast, hsp70.1+/+ MEFs exhibited no caspase-9 or caspase-3 activation and finally recovered intact cell morphology when cells were shifted back to an isosmotic state. Because HSP70 might be involved in the regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activities with regard to various cellular activities, we also monitored MAPK phosphorylation. The absence of HSP70 affected c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation. However, it had no effect on p38. Sustained phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was observed during the hyperosmolarity-induced apoptosis of hsp70.1–/–MEFs. Inhibition of ERK activity by the treatment of PD98059 accelerated the apoptotic pathway. ERK phosphorylation was precisely correlated with shift of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-3 from the soluble to insoluble fraction. Our results demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of HSP70 on caspase-3 activation is sufficient to inhibit apoptosis and that HSP70 exhibits regulatory functions to c-Jun N-terminal kinase and ERK phosphorylation in hyperosmolarity-induced apoptosis.

Apoptosis can be induced by a variety of different signals, including the activation of the Fas or tumor necrosis factor receptors, deprivation of growth factors, excessive DNA damage, treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs, or stresses such as heat shock, hyperosmotic shock, or UV irradiation (1Martin S.J.

Many apoptotic stimuli induce the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, and this released cytochrome c then binds to apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 with dATP in the cytosol. This apoptosome complex in turn activates caspase-9, and the activated caspase-9 results in the cleaving of downstream caspase-3 (3Koremer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2753) Google Scholar, 4Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6180) Google Scholar). The apoptotic process is also mediated via mitochondria-independent pathways, which converge on the proteolytic activation of the executive caspase, caspase-3. Caspase-3 cleaves various cellular proteins, finally resulting in the morphological alteration of apoptotic cells. Apoptosis, which is characterized by cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, nuclear breakdown, and DNA fragmentation, is an indispensable process in embryological development, tissue homeostasis, and regulation of the immune system (5Steller H.

Apoptotic malfunctions have been implicated in a myriad of human diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and ischemic stroke (7Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C.

In addition to its chaperone functions in protein folding and assembly, HSP70 protects cells from a number of apoptotic stimuli (11Mosser D.D. Martin L.H. J. Cell.

Most living cells are sensitive to sudden exposures to apoptotic stimuli. A transition from a mild to a harsh stimulus or repeated exposures to stimuli, i.e. preconditioning, can render cells tolerant to cellular damage (16Joyeux-Faure M. Arnaud C. Godin-Ribuot D. Ribuot C. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 60: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). HSP70, which is highly induced during preconditioning, performs a pivotal role in the process of apoptotic tolerance. HSP70 binds to specific target proteins, mediating their cellular activities. HSP70 can modulate stress-activated signaling through direct binding to c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (17Park H.S. Lee J.S. Huh S.H. Seo J.S. Choi E.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 446-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). HSP70 inhibits apoptosis via its direct association with apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (18Beere H.M. Wolf B.B. Cain K. Mosser D.D. Mahboubi A. Kuwana T. Tailor P. Morimoto R.I. Cohen G.M. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar).Despite recent advances in our knowledge regarding the anti-apoptotic effects of HSP70, this function has not yet been confirmed precisely using HSP70-deficient cells. Therefore, we utilized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) generated from hsp70.1–/–mice to directly observe the changes occurring to apoptotic molecules under HSP70-deficient conditions. Our results illustrate that HSP70 exerts an apoptosis-regulatory effect at multiple steps in the hyperosmolarity-induced apoptotic pathway. HSP70 deficiency leads to the activation of JNK, ERK, and caspase-3 in the apoptotic pathway. The HSP70-induced prevention of caspase-3 activation was critical in inhibiting the apoptotic process. In contrast to the pro-apoptotic functions of JNK and caspase-3, sustained activation of ERK played an inhibitory role with regard to apoptosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Antibodies against JNK, ERK, p38, phospho-JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185), phospho-ERK (Thr-202/Tyr-204), and phospho-p38 (Thr-180/Tyr-182) were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA).

Spontaneous immortalized MEFs were obtained with successive subculture, and they were used for transfection experiments. For the specific induction of hsp70.1, i.e. preconditioning with NaCl, culture media were replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 mm NaCl and incubated for 6 h. For the lethal hyperosmotic condition, cells were exposed to the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) medium supplemented with 400 or 500 mm NaCl for 2 h and then allowed to recover in the isosmotic DMEM media for the indicated time. For heat preconditioning, culture plates containing cells were tightly wrapped with Parafilm and immersed in a water bath at 43 °C for 30 min, then kept in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 6 or 16 h.Cell Morphology, Immunofluorescence, and Viability—Morphological characteristics of MEFs were evaluated with an inverted phase contrast microscope (Olympus).

After 48 h of incubation, puromycin (3 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium to select the transfected cells. The selection was continued for 10 days, after which the cells were maintained as a population, and the selected cells were used for the experiments.RESULTShsp70.1–/–MEFs Exhibit No Basal HSP70 Expression and No HSP70 Induction by Hyperosmolarity—We previously generated hsp70.1-deficient mice and demonstrated the differential expression of two inducible hsp70 genes, hsp70.1 and hsp70.3, depending on stress type (19Shim E.H. Kim J.I. Bang E.S. Heo J.S. Lee J.S. Kim E.Y. Lee J.E. Park W.Y. Kim S.H. Kim H.S. Smithies O. Jang J.J. Jin D.I. Seo J.S.

Because heat shock induced the expression of both genes, i.e. hsp70.1 and hsp70.3, hsp70.1+/+ and hsp70.1–/–MEFs exhibited drastic increases in HSP70 levels when exposed to heat shock (Fig. 1A). In contrast, mild hyperosmotic conditions (addition of 100 mm NaCl to culture media) resulted in HSP70 expression only in the hsp70.1+/+ MEFs due to the selective induction of hsp70.1 (Fig. 1B). This selective hyperosmotic stress-mediated induction of hsp70.1 was also confirmed by Northern blot analysis (data not shown). We detected no basal expression of HSP70 in the hsp70.1–/–MEFs under normal growth conditions (Fig. 1, A and B). This indicates that basal HSP70 level is attributed to the hsp70.1 gene expression. Thus, the HSP70 level in hsp70.1+/+ MEFs was far higher than in hsp70.1–/–MEFs under both normal and hyperosmotic conditions (Fig. 1B). The induced level of HSP70 was stably maintained for up to 24 h. With the other HSPs, HSP90 and HSP27, which are involved in apoptosis signaling, we detected no significant alterations occurring in the hsp70.1–/–MEFs (Fig. 1C).HSP70 Deficiency Renders Cells Vulnerable to Apoptotic Stress—When MEFs were exposed to lethal concentrations of NaCl (addition of 400 or 500 mm NaCl), hsp70.1+/+ MEFs were found to be more resistant to cell death than the hsp70.1–/–MEFs due to their basal HSP70 expression levels (Fig. 2A, left panel). If the MEFs were preconditioned with 100 mm NaCl, in order to induce HSP70 expression only in the hsp70.1+/+ MEFs, cell viability was observed to increase enormously in the hsp70.1+/+ MEFs compared with the hsp70.1–/–MEFs. Fig. 2A depicts cell viability in the hsp70.1+/+ and hsp70.1–/–MEFs either with or without preconditioning. Cellular morphologies and HSP70 levels in the hsp70.1+/+ and hsp70.1–/–MEFs after preconditioning are shown in Fig. 2B. These results indicate that the loss of either HSP70 basal expression or inducibility impairs the cell tolerance to cell death signaling.Fig. 2HSP70 level is critical for cytoprotection against hyperosmotically induced cell death.A, viabilities of hsp70.1+/+ and hsp70.1–/–MEFs. The percentage of surviving cells was estimated by trypan blue exclusion analysis.

The cells were then recovered in isosmotic media for 7 h (R7h) or 17 h (R17h). The preconditioned hsp70.1+/+ MEFs had large amounts of HSP70 compared with hsp70.1–/–MEFs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cleavage of Caspase-3 and Caspase-9 Is Inhibited by HSP70—It has been reported that HSP70 plays an inhibitory role in caspase-3 activation via prevention of the active apoptosomes (18Beere H.M.

However, because there is no available information regarding caspase-3 activity in hsp70-deficient cells, we compared caspase-3 cleavage between hsp70.1+/+ and hsp70.1–/–MEFs under hyperosmolarity-induced apoptotic conditions. Cleavage of caspase-3 was unambiguously detected in time- and dose-dependent manners in the hsp70.1–/–MEFs (Fig. 3A). No effect of preconditioning on caspase-3 cleavage was consistent with no induction of HSP70 in the hsp70.1–/–MEFs (Fig. 3B). In contrast to the hsp70.1–/–MEFs, caspase-3 was somewhat resistant to apoptotic cleavage in the hsp70.1+/+ MEFs, which is probably attributable to basal HSP70 levels (Fig. 3A). When the hsp70.1+/+ MEFs were preconditioned, caspase-3 cleavage was clearly inhibited (Fig. 3B). This indicates that the amount of HSP70 is a critical factor for the prevention of caspase-3 activation. Cleavage of caspase-9, which is an upstream molecule of caspase-3, was also inhibited in the hsp70.1+/+ MEFs after preconditioning (Fig. 3C). However, caspase-9 was cleaved, in a manner similar to that of caspase-3 cleavage in the hsp70.1–/–MEFs. To confirm whether or not HSP70 per se blocks caspase-3 cleavage and cellular damage, the hsp70 gene was transfected into hsp70.1–/–MEFs. Empty vector transfectants exhibited caspase-3 cleavage when exposed to hyperosmotic stress conditions, just as hsp70.1–/–MEFs. However, hsp70 transfectants did not exhibit caspase-3 cleavage under the same stressful conditions (Fig. 3D). Inhibition of cellular damage was also observed in the hsp70-transfected hsp70.1–/–MEFs (Fig. 3D).Fig. 3HSP70 prevents caspase-3 and caspase-9 cleavage.A, cells were exposed to lethal concentrations of NaCl (400 or 500 mm) for the indicated time periods.

With shrinkage of cell volume, both hsp70.1+/+ and hsp70.1–/–MEFs were severely damaged in terms of cellular morphology and cytoskeletal integrity during the exposure to hyperosmotic stress (Fig. 4A). When cells were returned to an isosmotic state, i.e. recovery state, hsp70.1+/+ MEFs gradually recovered, and ultimately exhibited normal cellular morphology and cytoskeletal structure. However, hsp70.1–/–MEFs showed no recovery after transition from hyperosmotic to isosmotic media. Cellular damage proceeded, even after returning to isosmotic conditions, culminating in cell death. Because cells had shrunk and become deformed, we evaluated both focal adhesion status and the state of the cytoskeletal molecules. Despite cellular deformation, focal adhesion molecules (FAK, vinculin, paxillin) and cytoskeletal molecules (tubulin, actin) were found to have remained intact in the hsp70.1+/+ MEFs (Fig. 4B). By way of comparison, FAK, paxillin, tubulin, and actin were all degraded with caspase-3 activation in the hsp70.1–/–MEFs, even after cells had been shifted back to an isosmotic state. Vinculin was a protein implicated in resistance to apoptotic degradation. In the case of the hsp70.1+/+ MEFs, cellular damage was totally reversed during the recovery period, possibly due to the inhibition of caspase-3 activation by HSP70. When the caspase-3-specific inhibitor, DEVD-CHO, was applied, hsp70.1–/–MEFs were rescued from the apoptotic cell death (data not shown). In this study we demonstrated that the inhibitory role of HSP70 on caspase-3 activation is indispensable, keeping the maintenance of recovery potential and, thus, cell viability.Fig. 4Differential cellular damages between hsp70.1+/+ and hsp70.1–/–MEFs.A, reversibility of cellular damage depends on intracellular levels of HSP70. Cells preconditioned with 100 mm NaCl were incubated in 500 mm NaCl for up to 2 h, and then cells were kept in isosmotic media for the indicated time periods. Cytoskeletal structures in the hsp70.1+/+ and hsp70.1–/–MEFs were examined via immunostaining.

Therefore, we assessed MAPK activities in MEFs exposed to lethal hyperosmotic conditions (Fig. 5A). Earlier and more severe phosphorylation of JNK was detected in the hsp70.1–/–MEFs than in the hsp70.1+/+ MEFs. JNK phosphorylation was detected at 30 min, peaking 2 h after exposure to hyperosmotic stress, and it decreased to basal levels when cells were returned to an isosmotic state, i.e. in recovery condition. Whereas the hsp70.1+/+ MEFs exhibited no ERK phosphorylation, the hsp70.1–/–MEFs exhibited prominent ERK phosphorylation. ERK phosphorylation was sustained, and the degree of phosphorylation during the apoptotic process was not observed to undergo any reduction (Fig. 5B). No detectable differences were observed between hsp70.1+/+ and hsp70.1–/–in terms of p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 5A).Fig. 5HSP70 regulates stress-induced MAPK phosphorylation.A, MAPK status in hsp70.1–/–MEFs.

However, it has been recently suggested that JNK acts as an anti-apoptotic molecule, and ERK could be pro-apoptotic on cell type and stimulus (22Yu C. Minemoto Y. Zhang J. Liu J. Tang F. Bui T.N.

To clarify the roles of phospho-JNK and phospho-ERK in hyperosmolarity-induced apoptosis, we treated the cells with inhibitors before applying hyperosmotic stress. Treatment with ERK inhibitor (PD98059) accelerated cellular damage and reduced the viability of the hsp70.1–/–MEFs (Fig. 5C). When JNK inhibitor (SP600125) was applied, cellular morphology recovered, and viability increased (Fig. 5C). This indicates that, whereas phospho-JNK acts as a proapoptotic molecule, phospho-ERK acts as an anti-apoptotic molecule in hyperosmolarity-induced apoptosis. To verify the anti-apoptotic function of ERK in the hyperosmolarity-induced apoptotic pathway, caspase-3 activity was analyzed in PD98059-treated hsp70.1–/–MEFs. Caspase-3 activation and the cleavage of its substrate were also accelerated by treatment with PD98059 (Fig. 5D). hsp70.1+/+ MEFs exhibited no significant differences in cellular morphology by the treatment of PD98059 or SP600125 (Fig. 5C).Increase of ERK Phosphorylation Is Attributed to Decrease of Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Phosphatase-3 in Soluble Fraction—Either activation of"
https://openalex.org/W2069034261,"The biological effects of ionizing radiation are attributable, in large part, to induction of DNA double-strand breaks. We report here the identification of a new protein factor that reconstitutes efficient double-strand break rejoining when it is added to a reaction containing the five other polypeptides known to participate in the human nonhomologous end-joining pathway. The factor is a stable heteromeric complex of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated splicing factor (PSF) and a 54-kDa nuclear RNA-binding protein (p54(nrb)). These polypeptides, to which a variety of functions have previously been attributed, share extensive homology, including tandem RNA recognition motif domains. The PSF·p54(nrb) complex cooperates with Ku protein to form a functional preligation complex with substrate DNA. Based on structural comparison with related proteins, we propose a model where the four RNA recognition motif domains in the heteromeric PSF·p54(nrb) complex cooperate to align separate DNA molecules."

This coordinate regulation is biologically important as it is conserved in all eukaryotes where transcription by pols I and III has been examined. The principal evolutionary imperatives that are thought to underlie this conserved regulation are the common function of rRNAs and tRNA in protein synthesis and the high energetic cost of their synthesis, which accounts for about 80% of nuclear gene transcription in actively growing cells (1Paule M.R. White R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1283-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Willis I.M. Desai N. Upadhya R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2004; 77: 323-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The levels of pol I and pol III transcription are critical determinants of cell growth rate, and the deregulation of this transcription is a hallmark of cell transformation and tumorigenesis (4Ruggero D.

In addition, for single cell eukaryotes whose biological niche exposes them to periods when nutrients are in short supply and/or harsh environmental conditions, the ability to rapidly shut off the synthesis of rRNAs and tRNA is thought to be of vital importance for achieving metabolic economy (6Warner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 437-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar) and hence is likely to impact cell survival. In higher eukaryotes, p53 and Rb and its relatives p107 and p130 play an important role in controlling pol I and pol III transcription and in coordinating the production of new protein synthetic capacity with cell proliferation (2Grummt I.

These repressors function by binding directly to components of the pol I and pol III transcription machinery and thereby prevent protein-protein interactions required for transcription. Specific components of this machinery are also substrates for phosphorylation by various kinases including extracellular signal-regulated kinase, casein kinase II, and cyclin-dependent kinases, which can either activate or repress transcription depending on the stage of the cell cycle and the growth conditions (2Grummt I.

In lower eukaryotes such as budding yeast, there are no homologs of p53 or Rb, and the signaling pathways that regulate pol I and pol III transcription have yet to be clearly defined (3Willis I.M.

For example, pol III transcription in yeast requires Tpd3, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (12van Zyl W. Huang W. Sneddon A.A. Stark M. Camier S. Werner M. Marck C. Sentenac A. Broach J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4946-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), as well as casein kinase II, which is necessary for efficient TFIIIB·DNA complex assembly (13Ghavidel A. Schultz M.C. Cell. 2001; 106: 575-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Casein kinase II copurifies with the TBP and Brf1 subunits of the initiation factor TFIIIB and phosphorylates TBP (most likely on Ser-128 (13Ghavidel A. Schultz M.C.

Yeast TFIIIB (which comprises TBP, Brf1, and Bdp1 polypeptides) and in some cases pol III itself have been suggested as regulatory targets based on their ability to rescue (at least partially) the transcription defect in extracts prepared from tpd3 and cka2 mutant strains or following rapamycin or cycloheximide treatment (12van Zyl W.

Lee J. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1489-1494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). An absolute requirement for Maf1 in the repression of pol III transcription has been demonstrated in maf1Δ cells following interruption of the secretory pathway and in response to DNA damage, growth to stationary phase, and treatments with rapamycin and the antifungal compound chlorpromazine (CPZ). As these conditions are known to activate at least three distinct signaling pathways (secretory signaling, target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase, and DNA damage response pathways), it is evident that these pathways must converge upon Maf1 to affect repression (3Willis I.M. Desai N. Upadhya R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2004; 77: 323-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17Upadhya R. Lee J. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1489-1494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Consistent with this view, Maf1 is located at or near the end of these pathways based on its direct but limited interaction with pol III (16Pluta K. Lefebvre O. Martin N.C. Smagowicz W.J. Stanford D.R. Ellis S.R. Hopper A.K. Sentenac A. Boguta M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5031-5040Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Given the range of conditions that have been examined to date, the findings suggest that Maf1 may be required universally for pol III transcriptional repression in yeast and that common mechanisms will operate downstream of Maf1 to affect repression of the pol III transcription machinery. In this work, we examined the consequences of Maf1-dependent repression in vivo and in vitro following CPZ treatment. We found that repression is affected at two different steps in transcription, namely TFIIIB·DNA complex assembly and polymerase recruitment. Maf1 was shown to interact with a small fraction of the Brf1 and pol III in control yeast extracts, and these interactions were not affected quantitatively under repressing conditions. The results exclude a stoichiometric mechanism of action by Maf1 and suggest that Maf1 functions, directly or indirectly, in a catalytic process to repress pol III transcription.

Biol. 1989; 9: 2551-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) yielded a flow-through fraction containing TFIIIB. The column was then developed with a linear gradient of ammonium sulfate (70–700 mm) to isolate the TFIIIC and pol III fractions (20Huet J. Manaud N. Dieci G. Peyroche G. Conesa C. Lefebvre O. Ruet A. Riva M. Sentenac A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 249-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pure recombinant TFIIIB subunits were prepared as described previously (Ref. 21Cloutier T.E.

TBP was kindly provided by Dr. Michael Brenowitz. Yeast Bdp1 with a histidine tag at its C terminus was purified from the BRα fraction (19Kassavetis G.A. Riggs D.L. Negri R. Nguyen L.H. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2551-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) under denaturing conditions on Ni2+-NTA-agarose resin (Qiagen Inc.) following the manufacturer's recommendations. The protein was renatured from 8 m urea in 40 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 500 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm EDTA and quantified by Western blotting with rBdp1 as a standard. Polyclonal antibodies to each TFIIIB subunit and Tfc4 have been described previously (22Rameau G. Puglia K. Crowe A. Sethy I. Willis I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 822-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23Sethy-Coraci I. Moir R.D. Lopez-de-Leon A. Willis I.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2344-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The Rpc34 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Steven Hahn. Schizosaccharomyces pombe Maf1 was PCR-amplified from a cDNA library provided by Dr. Tomohiro Matsumoto. A 740-bp PCR product was inserted into the pCR 2.1-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. For bacterial expression the entire open reading frame was cloned downstream of the Precision protease cleavage sequence in pGEX-6p-3 (Amersham Biosciences) to yield glutathione S-transferase (GST)-SpMaf1 and into NdeI/XhoI-cleaved pET-30a+ (Novagen) to yield a C-terminal hexahistidine-tagged SpMaf1. GST-SpMaf1 was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 Star (DE3) (Invitrogen), and protein expression was induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 2 h. GST-SpMaf1 (52 kDa) was purified under native conditions using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The histidine-tagged SpMaf1 construct was transformed into the Rosetta (DE3) pLysS strain (Novagen). Cultures grown at 37 °C were induced for 16 h with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside after shifting the temperature to 15 °C. SpMaf1 (27 kDa) was purified under denaturing conditions in 8 m urea using Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Further purification was achieved by chromatography on Resource Q (Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.0, 100 mm sodium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 6 m urea. Maf1 was eluted with a linear gradient of sodium acetate from 100 mm to 1 m. Pooled fractions were renatured by dialysis at 4 °C against 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.0, 50 mm ammonium sulfate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT and stored at –70 °C. Fragments of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MAF1 containing conserved domain A (amino acids 1–200, no intron) or domains B + C (amino acids 201–395) and the full-length protein were expressed with a C-terminal histidine tag in pET-30a(+) and pET-21d, respectively, using the Rosetta pLysS strain noted above. ScMaf1(A) and ScMaf1(B + C) fragments were purified under denaturing conditions on Ni2+-NTA-agarose and renatured into 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. For the A domain fragment, the final urea concentration was maintained at 0.5 m. Full-length ScMaf1 was gel-purified and used as a standard for quantifying ScMaf1 in yeast cell extracts. The concentrations of GST-SpMaf1 and ScMaf1(A) were determined by the Bio-Rad microassay, while for SpMaf1, ScMaf1(B + C) and full-length ScMaf1, the absorbance at 280 nm was used together with the calculated molar extinction coefficients. Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits against recombinant S. cerevisiae Maf1 (amino acids 201–395). Maf1-Brf1 Interaction Assay—Recombinant His-tagged Brf1 was immobilized on Ni2+-NTA-resin in binding buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 150 mm potassium acetate, and 10% glycerol with protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin at a concentration of 2 μg/ml). Untagged versions of either full-length S. pombe or S. cerevisiae Maf1 cloned into pET-30a(+) were individually transcribed and translated in vitro (SMLNT® coupled reticulocyte lysate system, Promega) to generate 35S-labeled proteins. Each pull-down reaction (100 μl) contained control or Brf1 (100 pmol)-resin (10 μl) and 35S-labeled Maf1 (10 μl) in binding buffer (see above) containing 10 mm imidazole, 5 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100. After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h, the resins were washed in binding buffer containing 20 mm imidazole (3 × 20 min) and then in binding buffer containing 30 mm imidazole, 400 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Triton X-100 (3 × 20 min). Samples were boiled in Laemmli buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the labeled Maf1 proteins were detected by autoradiography. Transcription and Complex Assembly Assays—Standard multiple round transcription assays in whole cell extracts (60 min at 15 °C) were performed on a tRNALeu3 template (YEp13, 0.5 μg) as described previously (24Moir R.D. Sethy-Coraci I. Puglia K. Librizzi M.D. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7119-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Transcription of the B box-deleted SNR6 template (U6ΔB) was performed similarly except that the extracts were supplemented with rTBP (20 pmol). To prepare Brf1-immunodepleted extracts, whole cell extracts (400 μg) were incubated with an affinity-purified Brf1 antibody (8 μl) at 4 °C for 1 h. Protein A-Sepharose 4 fast flow (Amersham Biosciences, 10 μl) equilibrated with KBC100 (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol) was added and mixed at 4 °C for 4 h. The tube was centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 4 °C, 15 s), and the supernatant was used for transcription and Western blotting. TFIIIC-independent transcription was reconstituted on the U6ΔB template (0.5 μg) with rTBP (20 pmol), rBrf1 (8 pmol), yeast Bdp1 (112 fmol, prepared from chromatin; Ref. 24Moir R.D. Sethy-Coraci I. Puglia K. Librizzi M.D. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7119-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and pol III (0.36 μg, DEAE-purified). TFIIIC-dependent transcription on the tRNALeu3 template (YEp13, 0.5 μg) was performed similarly except that TFIIIC (17 fmol, Mono Q fraction; Ref. 24Moir R.D. Sethy-Coraci I. Puglia K. Librizzi M.D. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7119-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and rTBP (1 pmol) were used unless otherwise specified. Transcription was allowed to proceed for 60 min at 20 °C with or without a prior preincubation (45 min at 20 °C), conducted in the absence of nucleotides and polymerase, to assemble TFIIIB onto the DNA. Recombinant Maf1 fragments were added either before or after the formation of the TFIIIB·DNA complex. Heparin-stripped TFIIIB·DNA, TFIIIB·TFIIIC·DNA, and Brf1·TFIIIC·DNA complexes were assembled on a sup3-eST tRNA gene and resolved on native 4% polyacrylamide gels as described previously (17Upadhya R. Lee J. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1489-1494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 25Moir R.D. Puglia K.V. Willis I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 694-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Incubation of rMaf1 fragments with preassembled TFIIIB·TFIIIC-·DNA complexes was carried out for an additional 20 min prior to gel loading. rMaf1 proteins were dialyzed in complex assembly buffer for these reactions (25Moir R.D. Puglia K.V. Willis I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 694-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of Maf1, Brf1, and Pol III—Whole cell extracts (2 mg) prepared from control and CPZ-treated cells expressing HA- and/or Myc-tagged proteins were incubated with monoclonal antibodies (12CA5 or 9E10, 2 μg, Roche Applied Science) in KBC100 buffer (see above) in a total volume of 400 μl at 4 °C for 3–4 h (Rpc82 and Maf1) or overnight (Brf1) followed by a 3-h incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads (20 μl). The beads were washed with KBC100 buffer (3 × 15 min) and boiled in SDS sample buffer, and aliquots were subjected to immunoblotting. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation and Quantitative PCR—Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis was carried out essentially as described by Kuras and Struhl (26Kuras L. Struhl K. Nature. 1999; 399: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). DNA samples were analyzed by quantitative PCR using primer pairs for three different tRNA genes and two negative controls (a ribosomal protein gene, TCM1, and an intergenic region on chromosome V, Int V; see Supplemental Data). The Activity of Brf1 in Transcription Is Repressed in Extracts of CPZ-treated Cells—In previous work we established an in vitro system to study Maf1-dependent repression of pol III transcription (17Upadhya R. Lee J. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1489-1494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts prepared following CPZ treatment of logarithmically growing cells were shown to have significantly reduced (>15-fold) pol III transcription compared with untreated cell extracts. The low transcription activity of these treated cell extracts could not be achieved by addition of CPZ directly to control extracts and did not result from the presence of an abundant repressor in the treated extracts (deduced from extract mixing experiments (17Upadhya R. Lee J. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1489-1494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar)). However, extract supplementation with control yeast TFIIIB substantially rescued the transcriptional defect, while excess molar amounts of the assembly factor TFIIIC or pol III from control extracts had no effect. To further examine the effect of CPZ treatment in this system, TFIIIB, TFIIIC, and pol III were partially purified from the control and treated extracts to compare their individual activities in transcription. Western blotting for representative TFIIIC and pol III subunits indicated that the corresponding control and treated fractions contained equivalent amounts of these factors per microgram of protein (Fig. 1, A and B, Tfc4 and Rpc34), consistent with their levels in the unfractionated extracts (17Upadhya R. Lee J. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1489-1494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Subsequent titrations of the TFIIIC or pol III fractions under conditions in which these components are limiting for transcription revealed no significant differences in their activity (Fig. 1, A and B). For pol III, this result was somewhat unexpected given the ability of Maf1 to be co-immunoprecipitated from crude extracts with the polymerase (16Pluta K. Lefebvre O. Martin N.C. Smagowicz W.J. Stanford D.R. Ellis S.R. Hopper A.K. Sentenac A. Boguta M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5031-5040Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and other results described below. We note, however, that Maf1 was resolved from pol III during purification and was not detectable in the pol III fraction by Western analysis (<10 ng of Maf1/2.5 μg of protein). For TFIIIC, the similar activity of control and treated fractions is concordant with transcription experiments performed in TBP-supplemented crude extracts using a B box-deleted SNR6 template (U6ΔB). Under these conditions, U6ΔB transcription is TFIIIC-independent (27Gerlach V.L. Whitehall S.K. Geiduschek E.P. Brow D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1455-1466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), yet the large differential in transcription between the control and treated extracts was retained. 3J. Lee, unpublished data. On the basis of these findings, a direct role for TFIIIC in the repression of pol III transcription by CPZ seems unlikely. In contrast to the results described above for TFIIIC and pol III, the TFIIIB fractions revealed differences in both the recovery and the activity of this initiation factor. In particular, the amount of Brf1 in the CPZ-treated fraction was 6-fold lower (per microgram of protein) than in the control fraction (Fig. 1C, lower panel) despite the fact that equivalent amounts of Brf1 were present in the starting extracts (17Upadhya R. Lee J. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1489-1494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Differential recovery of Brf1 upon purification has previously been correlated with the activity of the starting extracts (22Rameau G. Puglia K. Crowe A. Sethy I. Willis I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 822-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 24Moir R.D. Sethy-Coraci I. Puglia K. Librizzi M.D. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7119-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In these cases, the higher transcription activity of extracts derived from PCF1-1 and PCF1-2 strains, which contain dominant mutations in the second largest subunit of TFIIIC, resulted in more efficient recovery of Brf1 in purified TFIIIB fractions relative to wild type. Although the basis for this effect is not known, the same correlation was found in the current study with control and repressed whole cell extracts and their corresponding TFIIIB fractions. The different amounts of Brf1 in the purified fractions relative to other TFIIIB subunits (e.g. TBP, whose concentration in the treated fraction was only 30% lower than the control) may complicate the interpretation of transcription experiments where this fraction is limiting. Therefore, we first determined whether the activity of one or more of the TFIIIB subunits was compromised in the CPZ-treated whole cell extract by performing supplementation experiments. Control and CPZ-treated whole cell extracts contain equal amounts of each TFIIIB subunit (17Upadhya R. Lee J. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1489-1494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). 3J. Lee, unpublished data. Supplementation of a control extract with excess molar amounts (≥3-fold) of rTBP, rBrf1, or affinity purified yeast Bdp1 resulted in negligible to small effects on transcription that increased up to 2.6-fold when Brf1 and Bdp1 or all three TFIIIB components were added together (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the CPZ-treated extract, which was 15-fold less active than the control, produced a large (∼7-fold) increase in transcription when supplemented with Brf1 alone. Further increases in transcription were observed when TBP was added together with Brf1 (∼11-fold) or when all three TFIIIB subunits were added (∼13-fold). By comparing the transcription activity between extracts supplemented with the same factors, it is apparent that addition of exogenous Brf1 substantially reduces (from 15- to 2.5-fold) but does not completely eliminate the differential between the CPZ-treated and control extracts (Fig. 2, A and B). This suggests that changes in the activity of Brf1 underlie, at least in part, the transcriptional differences between the extracts. Conversely differences in the activity of TBP and Bdp1 do not appear to contribute significantly to the transcriptional differential between the extracts. Comparable results were obtained with extracts immunodepleted of Brf1 (Fig. 2C). A Brf1 polyclonal antibody was used to deplete about 90% of the Brf1 from control and CPZ-treated extracts. Mock-depleted extracts showed no significant reduction in Brf1, and the level of TBP and Bdp1 was not reduced in the Brf1-depleted extracts (data not shown) consistent with the ease of dissociation of these components from one another in the absence of DNA (28Huet J. Conesa C. Manaud N. Chaussivert N. Sentenac A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2282-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Like the starting whole cell extracts (Fig. 2, A and B), the transcription differential in the mock-depleted control and CPZ-treated extracts was reduced from 12-fold (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 6) to 2.8-fold (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 7) after supplementation with rBrf1. Transcription in the Brf1-depleted extracts was undetectable (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 8). However, supplementation of both depleted extracts with Brf1 rescued transcription and reduced the differential between them to less than 4-fold (Fig. 2C, lanes 4 and 9). Further supplementation with TBP produced only a small increase in transcription (Fig. 2C, lanes 5 and 10), indicating that TBP is not limiting to any significant degree in the depleted extracts. The finding that TBP and Bdp1 do not contribute significantly to the transcriptional difference between the extracts (Fig. 2, A and B) allowed a com"

Efficiency of signaling is further increased by protein and lipid segregation within the plasma membrane. We have previously demonstrated the importance of raft-mediated signaling in the regulation of smooth and skeletal muscle cell contraction. Since G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are key components in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction-relaxation cycles, it is important to determine whether GPCR signaling is mediated by lipid rafts and raft-associated molecules. Neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) is expressed in central and peripheral nervous system as well as in endothelial and smooth muscle cells and involved in mediation of pain, inflammation, exocrine secretion, and smooth muscle contraction. The NK1 receptor was transiently expressed in HEK293 and HepG2 cell lines and its localization in membrane microdomains investigated using biochemical methods and immunofluorescent labeling. We show that the NK1 receptor, similar to the earlier described β2-adrenergic receptor and G proteins, localizes to lipid rafts and caveolae. Protein kinase C (PKC) is one of the downstream effectors of the NK1 activation. Its active form translocates from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. Upon stimulation of the NK1 receptor with Substance P, the activated PKC relocated to lipid rafts. Using cholesterol extraction and replenishment assays we show that activation of NK1 receptor is dependent on the microarchitecture of the plasma membrane: NK1R-mediated signaling was abolished after cholesterol depletion of the receptor-expressing cells with methyl-β-cyclodextrin. Our results demonstrate that reorganization of the plasma membrane has an effect on the activation of the raft-associated NK1R and the down-stream events such as recruitment of protein kinases.

The plasma membrane is segregated into domains, which incorporate specific lipid and protein moieties. These lateral assemblies of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids form dynamic structures termed lipid “rafts” or microdomains, and are associated with characteristic sets of proteins, linked by glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) 1The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; PLC, phospholipase C; PKC, protein kinase C; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; SM, smooth muscle; NK1R, neurokinin 1 receptor; MBCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; PMA, 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; HEK, human embryonic kidney cells; Ab, antibody; SP, substance P. anchors to their extracellular face and/or multiple acylated cytoplasmic proteins to the inside of the cell. Membrane rafts can self-associate to form higher order structures with higher physical stability and constitute hubs of signaling activity (1Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar). Over the last few years, a wide array of signaling and receptor proteins have been found to associate with lipid rafts, which further strengthened this concept (2Shaul P.W. Anderson R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: 843-851PubMed Google Scholar). Signal transduction across the plasma membrane is a fundamental aspect of cellular communication in which G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play a major role. Molecular regulation by these seven transmembrane receptors results in the transmission of an extracellular signal from the receptors via heterotrimeric (α-, β-, and γ-subunit-containing) G proteins to effector molecules. Each cell expresses a number of different GPCRs, which may share their downstream signaling partners. Since GPCRs remain major targets for pharmacological manipulation, their activation and blockade by specific agonists and antagonists have been extensively investigated. Most of this work has been aimed at studying the receptor-ligand interaction, disregarding the downstream events of GPCR signaling, yet many G protein-coupled receptors have the capacity to interact with multiple G proteins and thus regulate more than one effector pathway (3Chabre O. Conklin B.R. Brandon S. Bourne H.R. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5730-5734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such observations contradict the paradigm that receptors and other integral membrane proteins are randomly distributed in the plasma membrane. Indeed, fluorescence labeling experiments have demonstrated that the distribution of G proteins is not random and that both βγ- and α-subunits display limited mobility (4Fishburn C.S. Pollitt S.K. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1085-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Since the receptors themselves interact with various scaffolding molecules, (5Edwards S.W. Tan C.M. Limbird L.E. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 304-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), it is highly likely that GPCRs form a part of the pre-assembled and relatively stable signal transduction complexes within the plasma membrane. G protein-coupled receptors play an important role in the regulation of smooth muscle (SM) contraction and relaxation, as well as other important processes such as growth, remodeling, and inflammation (6Billington C.K. Penn R.B. Respir. Res. 2003; 4: 2Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of different agonists activate G protein-coupled receptors to stimulate adenylyl cyclase (AC), increase cAMP formation, and promote relaxation in vascular smooth muscle (7Ostrom R.S. Liu X. Head B.P. Gregorian C. Seasholtz T.M. Insel P.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 983-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). β-Adrenergic receptors are the primary therapeutic targets in airways since their activation promotes relaxation of airway smooth muscle and combats acute asthma attacks. The Gq-coupled receptors, on the other hand, are the principal mediators of SM contraction. They activate PLC, which causes an increase of the intracellular Ca2+ through IP3-mediated release from sarcoplasmic calcium stores. The raise in Ca2+ concentration promotes Ca-calmodulin to activate MLCK and start the actin-myosin cross-bridge cycling and contraction. The evidence is emerging, that many components of the GPCR signal transduction chains in muscle cells are localized to specific membrane domains. Oh and Schnitzer (8Oh P. Schnitzer J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 685-698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that Gαq subunits of G proteins concentrate in caveolae, whereas Gαs and Gαi target lipid rafts. Consistent with the presence of G proteins in rafts, several members of the GPCR family, as well as certain channel proteins, AC, PLC, and activated PKC have been shown to localize to rafts and caveolae (9Rybin V.O.

Often raft localization is a dynamic process as it has been shown that the β2-adrenergic receptor leaves caveolae upon ligand binding, whereas muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and B2 bradykinin receptor that are uniformly distributed throughout the plasma membrane localize to caveolae only in the presence of ligand (13Feron O.

Tachykinin receptors NK1–3 preferentially couple to Gαq and are widely expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system, as well as in the target organs including respiratory, genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts. NK1 receptor, which has Substance P (SP) as its ligand, mediates smooth muscle contraction, water and ion secretion, and inflammatory response (15Quartara L. Maggi C.A. Neuropeptides. 1998; 32: 1-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). NK1 has been extensively studied regarding its membrane topology, ligand binding, signal transduction, and tissue distribution (16Saria A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 375: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 17Hokfelt T. Pernow B. Wahren J. J. Intern. Med. 2001; 249: 27-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). One of the puzzling aspects of the NK1-mediated signaling is its ability to couple to two different signaling pathways: Gαq, which activates PLCβ, thereby initiating inositol phosphate formation and intracellular Ca2+ release, and Gαs pathway, leading to activation of AC and formation of cAMP. Using mutational analysis and generation of NK1-G protein fusions, Holst et al. (18Holst B. Hastrup H. Raffetseder U. Martini L. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19793-19799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) have shown that the heterogeneous pharmacological phenotype of this receptor, which becomes evident at whole cell binding experiments, is a reflection of two complexes of NK1 with either Gq or Gs, and that these complexes do not readily interchange. Based on this evidence, the authors suggested the existence of NK1 receptors in different membrane microdomains. We investigated the plasma membrane localization of the NK1 receptor, and show that this receptor is localized to lipid rafts. Disruption of rafts following cholesterol extraction with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MBCD) leads to the dissociation of the NK1R signaling complexes and receptor desensitization. Binding of SP to the NK1R causes receptor activation, and induces protein kinase C (PKC), which in turn inhibits the SP signaling by phosphorylating the receptor (19Dery O. Defea K.A. Bunnett N.W. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1097-C1106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We show that activation of the NK1R stimulated translocation of PKC into lipid rafts, where it interacts with the receptor and causes its desensitization. Extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) are known to be among the downstream effectors of the NK1R signaling (20DeFea K.A. Vaughn Z.D. O'Bryan E.M. Nishijima D. Dery O. Bunnett N.W.

Here we study the effects of lipid raft dissociation on the NK1R-mediated activation of ERK1/2, and show that the SP-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation does not occur in MBCD-extracted cells expressing the NK1R. Reagents and Antibodies—Anti-annexin 1, 2, 4, and 6, anti-Lyn, anti-PKCα monoclonal antibodies, anti-caveolin polyclonal antibody were from Transduction Laboratories, anti-Gαq, NK1R, ERK1/2, and phospho-ERK1/2 polyclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, anti-β-actin, anti-FLAG antibodies, as well as MBCD, MBCD-cholesterol, filipin, and 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were from Sigma. Peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies and the ECL detection kit were from Amersham Biosciences. Restriction endonucleases and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs. Fluo-3 was from Molecular Probes, Inc. The radiolabeled NK1R-selective antagonist [3H]SR-140333 was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and selective NK1 receptor antagonist L-733,060 was from Tocris. Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK293 and HepG2 cells, as well as human aortic smooth muscle cell primary cultures (HAoSMC) (Promocell, Heidelberg) and human myometrium smooth muscle cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mm glutamine, 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 μg of streptomycin/ml, 10% fetal calf serum. All cells were grown in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in a humidified incubator. HEK293 and HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with pCI-NK1R plasmid using electroporation (Bio-Rad), maintained at 37 °C for 48 h, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-NK1R antibodies. HAoSMC, which endogenously express NK1R were used without transfection. Immunohistochemistry—Immunolabeling of the fixed, permeabilized cells with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, and anti-caveolin polyclonal antibodies was performed as described (23Babiychuk E.B. Palstra R.J. Schaller J. Kampfer U. Draeger A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35191-35195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For immunostaining using the native (unfixed) conditions, transfected cells were seeded onto glass coverslips, and 48 h post-transfection washed with ice-cold Na+-Tyrode's solution (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES; pH 7.4) containing 0.05% NaN3, and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the primary anti-FLAG mAb diluted in the same buffer. After washing and incubation with the Alexa-488-conjugated (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) secondary antibody using the same conditions, the plasma membrane of the non-fixed cells was stained for 5 min with concanavalin A conjugated with tetramethylrhodamine (40 μg/ml, Molecular Probes). Finally the cells were washed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde buffered with Na+-Tyrode's solution before mounting. Negative controls were generated by applying a non-binding primary antibody. Specimen were examined in a Zeiss LSM META 510 confocal microscope. Isolation of Lipid Rafts and Determination of Their Lipid and Protein Content—Lipid rafts were prepared by detergent extraction on ice and flotation on sucrose gradients. Pieces of frozen pig or mouse brain tissue (approx 100 mg each) were finely sliced and homogenized on ice in BW buffer (20 mm imidazole, 40 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0) using Polytron homogenizer. Cultured cells were scraped off the dish and lysed by sonication. Following 30 min of incubation of the homogenates on ice in the presence of 0.4% Triton X-100 and 0.2 μm CaCl2, the sucrose content of the homogenate was adjusted to 40% by the addition of 80% sucrose in BW buffer. A 30–5% discontinuous sucrose gradient was layered over the lysate. The gradients were centrifuged for 16 h at 33,000 rpm in SW50.1 rotor at 4 °C. Seven 650-μl fractions were collected from the top of the gradient, and SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot was performed to examine their protein content. Lipid composition of the fractions was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). When present, the lipid rafts were found to be floating at the 5–30% interface, corresponding to fractions 3 and 4 of the gradient. Isolation of Microsomal Membranes—Cultured cells (6 × 107) expressing NK1R were scraped off the dish, washed, and resuspended in 5 ml of buffer A (60 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0) on ice. Cells were homogenized, and homogenates subjected to low speed centrifugation (10,000 × g, 30 min). The supernatants were filtered through glass wool, and centrifuged at high speed (50,000 × g, 120 min). The pellets were washed three times with 1 ml of buffer B (120 mm KCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0) with intervening centrifugations at 10,000 × g for 30 min and resuspended in 100 μl of the same buffer. Protein concentration was measured and adjusted to 4 mg/ml across the preparations. Samples of equal volume were then were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. 5′-Nucleotidase Activity in Gradient Fractions—5′-Nucleotidase was assayed using 5′-AMP as a substrate, as described previously (23Babiychuk E.B. Palstra R.J. Schaller J. Kampfer U. Draeger A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35191-35195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts were isolated by flotation in sucrose gradient and 40 μl of each fraction taken for the 5′-nucleotidase assay. Protein concentration in fractions was determined using BCA assay (Sigma) as described by the manufacturer, to estimate the amount of protein taken into each 5′-nucleotidase assay. 5′-Nucleotidase activity in each fraction was monitored as Pi release, which was measured spectrophometrically at a wavelength of 820 nm (OD820). Activity was expressed as an optical density at 820 nm per μg of protein. Data represent the average of three independent experiments Intracellular Calcium Measurements—NK1 receptor signaling was assessed by measuring SP-induced Ca2+ mobilization. For calcium imaging recordings, the cultured cells expressing NK1R were loaded with Fluo-3/AM (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature. Single wavelength measurements at 520 nm (488 nm excitation) were performed on a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM 510 META, Zeiss, Germany). Images were recorded and analyzed using the “Physiology evaluation” software package (Zeiss), and increase in fluorescence intensity of Ca2+-bound Fluo-3, proportional to the [Ca2+], was calculated after subtracting the background fluorescence. An average of three independent experiments is presented. ERK1/2 Activation Assays—SP-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was analyzed by Western blotting. Cells expressing NK1R were exposed to 30 nm SP for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were lysed by boiling in the SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and equal amounts of lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-phospho-ERK1/2. The amounts of the non-phosphorylated ERK1/2, NK1R, and the total protein were the same across the samples as determined by Western blotting with respective antibodies as well as staining the membranes with Amido Black. Results were expressed as increase relative to non-stimulated cells in three experiments. Whole Cell Radioligand Binding Assays—200 μl of cell suspension and 50 μl of radioligand [3H]SR-140333 solution (final concentration between 0.25 and 4 nm) in binding buffer (Tris-HCl 10 mm, NaCl 137 mm, MgCl2 2 mm, bovine serum albumin 0.2 mg/ml) were incubated at 13 °C for 3 h. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of the non-radiolabeled antagonist L-733,060 (3 μm). Binding reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of ice-cold binding buffer. 1 ml of the incubation mixture was then filtered through Whatman GF/C filters precoated with 0.5% polyethylenimine, and the filters were washed three times with 5 ml of 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, transferred into vials and counted after adding 5 ml of scintillation mixture. The protein concentration of the cell suspension was determined by Lowry protein assay. Specific binding was then calculated as the difference between total binding (measured in the absence of L-733,060) and unspecific binding (measured in the presence of L-733,060) and expressed as fmol/mg protein. Binding curves were fitted by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism (version 3.0) and Bmax and KD values determined. Miscellaneous—SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, TLC, and sucrose gradient centrifugations were performed as described previously (24Babiychuk E.B. Monastyrskaya K. Burkhard F.C. Wray S. Draeger A. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Protein content of the individual bands following SDS-PAGE and Western blotting was estimated using ONE-Dscan 1.0 software. Expression of the NK1 Receptor in Heterologous Systems and in Vivo—The NK1R was expressed in pCI vector (Promega) following its PCR amplification from human bladder cDNA with receptor-specific primers as described previously (25Lundstrom K. Mills A. Buell G. Allet E. Adami N. Liljestrom P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 917-921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NK1R was tagged with the FLAG tag at the N terminus using the forward primer 5′-TATAACTCGAGATGGACTACAAGGACGATGATGACAAGGATAACGTCCTCCCGGTGGAC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-TATAAGCGGCCGCCTAGGAGAGCACATTGGAGGAG-3′. Epitope tagging had been shown to have no effect on the receptor signaling and localization (26Vigna S.R. Bowden J.J. McDonald D.M. Fisher J. Okamoto A. McVey D.C. Payan D.G. Bunnett N.W. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 834-845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The receptor was transiently expressed in HEK293 and HepG2 cells using electroporation and its presence and plasma membrane localization confirmed by Western blot and immunofluorescence with both anti-tag and anti-receptor antibodies. Different pig and mouse tissues, as well as uterus (HU SMC) and HAoSMC smooth muscle primary cell cultures were assayed for the expression of the NK1R. We found that total mouse and pig brain lysates, as well as HAoSMC react with anti-NK1R antibodies in Western blot (see below, Fig. 1). Our cultures of HU SMC did not express the NK1R. Endogenous expression of the NK1R in HAoSMC was further confirmed by challenging these cells with Substance P and examining the intracellular Ca2+ release by calcium imaging. Certain proportion of HAoSMC responded to SP application by elevation of [Ca2+]i (data not shown). The fact that not all the cells were responsive to SP, despite a relatively high expression level of the NK1R as judged by Western blotting and immunofluorescence can be explained by de-differentiation of the smooth muscle cells in culture, with possible loss of expression of some of the NK1R signal transduction pathway components. The NK1R Is Localized to the Low Density Plasma Membrane Microdomains—Lipid rafts were prepared following detergent extraction and flotation on sucrose gradients as described previously (27Parkin E.T. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Since detergent concentration has an important effect on the degree of extraction of raft components, 2E. Babiychuk, personal communication. Triton-X100 concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 2% were tested and raft integrity controlled by monitoring the presence of known raft-specific proteins and extraction of the others. After incubation of the lysates on ice in the presence of Ca2+, lipid rafts were isolated by flotation in sucrose gradients as described previously (28Draeger A. Monastyrskaya K. Burkhard F.C. Wobus A.M. Moss S.E. Babiychuk E.B. Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 324-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Our earlier experiments (24Babiychuk E.B. Monastyrskaya K. Burkhard F.C. Wray S. Draeger A. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) demonstrated that lipid rafts prepared using extraction with 0.4% Triton X-100 on ice for 30 min effectively removed the non-raft proteins annexin 1 and Rho A, together with glycerophospholipids. In contrast, the majority of raft-associated proteins (Lyn, Gαq, annexins 2 and 6, caveolin) and lipids (cholesterol, sphingomyelin) were concentrated at the interface between 5 and 30% sucrose following overnight centrifugation of the sucrose gradients. The endogenous NK1 receptor in pig (Fig. 1A) and mouse brain extracts (Fig. 1B) and in the HAoSMC cultures (Fig. 1C) localized to the low density fractions 3 and 4 of the gradient. The raft markers annexin 2, Lyn, caveolin, and the GPI-anchored 5′-nucleotidase showed similar localization patterns. The NK1R, heterologously expressed in the HEK293 cells floated to the 5–30% sucrose interface following 0.4% Triton-X100 extraction of lipid microdomains and separation on sucrose gradients (Fig. 2A). Activation of the receptor following incubation with 3 nm SP did not cause the complete dissociation of the receptor from lipid rafts, however, there was a shift of the maximum of NK1R into the 30% sucrose (fractions 4 and 5), which might reflect clathrin-dependent internalization of the NK1R following its agonist-induced endocytosis (29Grady E.F. Garland A.M. Gamp P.D. Lovett M. Payan D.G. Bunnett N.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 509-524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our method of lipid raft isolation did not allow us to discriminate between caveolae and non-caveolar rafts. In order to determine, whether the presence of caveolin is crucial for the NK1R association with rafts, we employed transient transfection of the pCI-NK1R vector into HepG2 cells, naturally devoid of this protein (30Fu Y. Hoang A. Escher G. Parton R.G. Krozowski Z. Sviridov D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14140-14146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We found that, similar to the transfected HEK293 cells, in HepG2 cells expressing the NK1R, the receptor localized to low density microdomains, in the same fractions as the raft-associated proteins Lyn, annexin 6, and 5′-nucleotidase (Fig. 2B). Therefore, interaction with caveolin was not necessary for the lipid raft targeting of the NK1R. The detergent extraction and sucrose gradient flotation experiments used here did not allow us to precisely determine the co-localization of the NK1R with the other raft-associated proteins. Indeed, the fact that some of the raft markers form peaks at slightly different gradient fractions than NK1R might be a reflection of the heterogeneity of the raft population. This might be especially true in the case of annexins (see distribution of annexin 6 in Fig. 2B), which are not integral membrane proteins and whose interaction with lipid rafts depends on additional factors, such as [Ca2+]i. The NK1R Signaling Activates PKCα and Induces Its Translocation to Lipid Rafts—HEK293 cells, expressing the NK1 receptor, were either left untreated, or exposed to PMA (2 μm) for 15 min to activate PKC; Ca2+-iomonycin (10 μm) to cause Ca2+ influx; or Substance P (3 nm) to activate the NK1 receptor. Following the treatments, lipid rafts were prepared and the presence of PKCα in the gradient fractions analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Lipid microdomains floated in the low density gradient fractions 3 and 4, as shown using caveolin as a control. In untreated cells, the majority of PKCα localized to the high density fractions 6 and 7, however, activation by PMA or Ca2+ increase promoted its association with the lipid rafts in fractions 3 and 4, in accordance with the previously published observations in cardiomyocytes (9Rybin V.O. Xu X. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 980-988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, Ca2+ mobilization by NK1 signaling to 3 nm SP resulted in translocation of PKCα into rafts (Fig. 3A). Activation of PKC with phorbol esters strongly inhibits signaling by several GPCR, including the NK1R (19Dery O. Defea K.A. Bunnett N.W. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1097-C1106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Garrad R.C. Otero M.A. Erb L. Theiss P.M. Clarke L.L. Gonzalez F.A. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 28496-28503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The subsequent translocation of the activated PKCα to lipid rafts might be important for the inhibitory effect of PKCα on SP-induced Ca2+ mobilization in transfected HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells expressing the NK1R were loaded with Fluo-3 to study the NK1-mediated intracellular Ca2+ release. When the cells were pretreated with 2 μm PMA to activate PKC, their ability to activate the receptor-mediated intracellular Ca2+ release was greatly reduced (Fig. 3B). PKC phosphorylates the C-tail of the NK1R, therefore uncoupling it from the G proteins (19Dery O. Defea K.A. Bunnett N.W. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1097-C1106Crossref PubMed Google"

Using the epididymis as a model system in which luminal acidification is crucial for sperm maturation and storage, we now report that modulation of the actin cytoskeleton by the calcium-activated actin-capping and -severing protein gelsolin plays a key role in regulating vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) recycling. Epididymal clear cells contain abundant V-ATPase in their apical pole, and an increase in their cell-surface V-ATPase expression correlates with an increase in luminal proton secretion. We have shown that apical membrane accumulation of V-ATPase is triggered by an elevation in cAMP following activation of bicarbonate-regulated soluble adenylyl cyclase in response to alkaline luminal pH (Pastor-Soler, N., Beaulieu, V., Litvin, T. N., Da Silva, N., Chen, Y., Brown, D., Buck, J., Levin, L. R., and Breton, S. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 49523-49529). Here, we show that clear cells express high levels of gelsolin, indicating a potential role in the functional activity of these cells. When jasplakinolide was used to overcome the severing action of gelsolin by polymerizing actin, complete inhibition of the alkaline pH- and cAMP-induced apical membrane accumulation of V-ATPase was observed. Conversely, when gelsolin-mediated actin filament elongation was inhibited using a 10-residue peptide (PBP10) derived from the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-binding region (phosphoinositide-binding domain 2) of gelsolin, significant V-ATPase apical membrane mobilization was induced, even at acidic luminal pH. In contrast, the calcium chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester) and the phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122 inhibited the alkaline pH-induced V-ATPase apical accumulation. Thus, maintenance of the actin cytoskeleton in a depolymerized state by gelsolin facilitates calcium-dependent apical accumulation of V-ATPase in response to luminal pH alkalinization. Gelsolin is present in other cell types that express the V-ATPase in their plasma membrane and recycling vesicles, including kidney intercalated cells and osteoclasts. Therefore, modulation of the actin cortex by this severing and capping protein may represent a common mechanism by which these cells regulate their rate of proton secretion.

Traffic. 2001; 2: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, a dense sheet of polymerized actin adjacent to the plasma membrane forms the actin cortex. The role of the cortical actin in regulating vesicle trafficking is extremely complex, and numerous studies have shown that depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton can either facilitate or impair vesicle recycling. This topic has been extensively reviewed (20Apodaca G. Traffic. 2001; 2: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 21Hoekstra D. Tyteca D. van IJzendoorn S.C. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117 (S. C.

Gabbay K.H. Malaisse W.J. Science. 1972; 175: 1128-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) were among the first to demonstrate that the actin-depolymerizing agent cytochalasin can either stimulate or inhibit exocytosis depending on the experimental conditions used. Actin depolymerization enhances catecholamine secretion in adrenal chromaffin cells (22Sontag J.M. Aunis D. Bader M.F. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 46: 316-326PubMed Google Scholar, 23Morita K. Oka M. Hamano S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 3357-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), suggesting that the actin cortex can form a barrier for exocytic vesicles. Although a similar stimulation of exocytosis was observed upon moderate actin depolymerization in pancreatic acinar cells, severe depletion of F-actin inhibited exocytosis in these cells (18Muallem S. Kwiatkowska K. Xu X. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), indicating the need for a minimal amount of polymerized actin. In intact muscle, the insulin-stimulated cell-surface mobilization of GLUT4 is inhibited after disruption of cortical F-actin (24Brozinick Jr., J.T. Hawkins E.D. Strawbridge A.B. Elmendorf J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40699-40706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In contrast, accumulation of the water channel AQP2 in the plasma membrane of primary cultured kidney collecting duct principal cells occurs after disruption of the actin cytoskeleton (25Klussmann E. Tamma G. Lorenz D. Wiesner B. Maric K. Hofmann F. Aktories K. Valenti G. Rosenthal W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20451-20457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Increase in surface expression of AQP2 is promoted by vasopressin in the mammalian kidney and toad bladder (26Ausiello D.A. Hartwig J. Brown D. Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1987; 42: 259-275PubMed Google Scholar), and in the latter, this process was shown to be accompanied by depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton (27Hays R.M. Condeelis J. Gao Y. Simon H. Ding G. Franki N. Pediatr. Nephrol. 1993; 7: 672-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). More recently, actin filaments were proposed to facilitate endocytosis of water channels but not to be required for exocytosis in the toad bladder (28Dibas A. Mia A. Yorio T. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 2000; 223: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In some cells, disruption of the actin cytoskeleton inhibits apical endocytosis without affecting basolateral endocytosis (29Gottlieb T.A. Ivanov I.E. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 695-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 30Jackman M.R. Shurety W. Ellis J.A. Luzio J.P. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2547-2556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another study showed variable effects on receptor-mediated endocytosis after either depolymerization or polymerization of actin filaments in different cell types (31Fujimoto L.M. Roth R. Heuser J.E. Schmid S.L. Traffic. 2000; 1: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). It therefore appears that opposite effects can be obtained following disruption of the actin cytoskeleton depending on the cell type or the nature of the recycling process examined.Remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton is controlled by several intracellular proteins, including the calcium-activated actinsevering proteins villin, gelsolin, fragmin, severin, and adseverin (scinderin) (32Janmey P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 169-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 33Dos Remedios C.G. Chhabra D. Kekic M. Dedova I.V. Tsubakihara M. Berry D.A. Nosworthy N.J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83 (I. V.): 433-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Gelsolin severs actin filaments and caps their fast-growing barbed ends, thereby promoting rapid actin filament fragmentation and blocking their elongation (34Kwiatkowski D.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 35Azuma T. Witke W. Stossel T.P. Hartwig J.H. Kwiatkowski D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1362-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The binding of gelsolin to actin is activated by calcium and by low pH, whereas phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) 1The abbreviations used are: PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PBD, phosphoinositide-binding domain; V-ATPase, vacuolar H+-ATPase; PLC, phospholipase C; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester); CPT-cAMP, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP; sAC, soluble adenylyl cyclase.1The abbreviations used are: PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PBD, phosphoinositide-binding domain; V-ATPase, vacuolar H+-ATPase; PLC, phospholipase C; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester); CPT-cAMP, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP; sAC, soluble adenylyl cyclase. and some other phosphoinositides remove gelsolin from the barbed ends of actin filaments (36Hartwig J.H. Bokoch G.M. Carpenter C.L. Janmey P.A. Taylor L.A. Toker A. Stossel T.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 37Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1987; 325: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Two phosphoinositide-binding domains (PBDs) of gelsolin (PBD1 and PBD2; 10-20 amino acids each) have been identified (38Kwiatkowski D.J. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1717-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The actin-severing activity of gelsolin is located in the N-terminal half of gelsolin (38Kwiatkowski D.J. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1717-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, modulation of the actin cytoskeleton by gelsolin is a regulated and complex process that involves both the severing and capping properties of gelsolin.Gelsolin was shown to be highly expressed in a variety of cell types involved in active plasma membrane recycling, including osteoclasts, kidney intercalated cells, and spermatozoa (39Lueck A. Brown D. Kwiatkowski D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3633-3643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Cabello-Agueros J.F. Hernandez-Gonzalez E.O. Mujica A. Cell Motil.

Chellaiah M.A. BMC Cell Biol. 2004; (http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/5/19)PubMed Google Scholar). It was proposed that active remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton by gelsolin might regulate the endo/exocytic activity in these cells. In this study, we show that gelsolin is highly expressed in another cell type involved in active recycling, the clear cells of the epididymis. Furthermore, osteoclasts, kidney intercalated cells, and epididymal clear cells all express high levels of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) on intracellular vesicles and the plasma membrane (42Breton S.

Brown D. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 470-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar).The V-ATPase is a complex enzyme composed of numerous subunits, some of which are present in multiple copies in each holoenzyme (49Wagner C.A. Finberg K.E. Breton S. Marshansky V. Brown D. Geibel J.P. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1263-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 50Sun-Wada G.H. Wada Y. Futai M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1658: 106-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It is ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotic cells, where it is located in intracellular acidic organelles, including lysosomes, the Golgi apparatus, secretory vesicles, and endosomes. In some specialized cells such as osteoclasts, kidney intercalated cells, and epididymal clear cells, the V-ATPase is also expressed in the plasma membrane (46Gluck S.L. Lee B.S. Wang S.P. Underhill D. Nemoto J. Holliday L.S. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1998; 643: 203-212PubMed Google Scholar, 48Brown D. Breton S. J. Exp.

In these cells, the V-ATPase rapidly recycles between intracellular vesicles and the plasma membrane, and an increase in proton secretion correlates with an increase in V-ATPase surface expression (48Brown D.

The B subunit of the V-ATPase exists in two forms known as B1 and B2. The B1 subunit is predominant in kidney intercalated cells and epididymal clear cells (44Brown D. Lui B. Gluck S. Sabolic I. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C913-C916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Brown D. Hirsch S. Gluck S. J. Clin. Investig. 1988; 82: 2114-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 60Paunescu T.G. Da Silva N. Marshansky V. McKee M. Breton S. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C149-C162Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), whereas osteoclasts express the B2 isoform (47Lee B.S. Holliday L.S. Ojikutu B. Krits I. Gluck S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C382-C388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These isoforms are highly homologous, and they both bind directly to actin via their cytoplasmic N termini (56Chen S.H. Bubb M.R. Yarmola E.G. Zuo J. Jiang J. Lee B.S. Lu M. Gluck S.L. Hurst I.R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 32331-32337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In addition, the B1 subunit, but not the B2 subunit, contains a DTAL motif in its C terminus, which allows for binding to the PDZ domain-containing protein NHERF1 (59Breton S. Wiederhold T. Marshansky V. Nsumu N.N. Ramesh V. Brown D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18219-18224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). NHERF1, which was originally identified as a cofactor for the regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3 (61Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Tate K. Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 2199-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), binds to the ezrin/radixin/moesin family of actin-binding proteins and links many membrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton (62Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F389-F395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, NHERF1 may allow for indirect interaction between V-ATPase and actin. It was proposed that interaction between the V-ATPase and F-actin is required for V-ATPase-dependent proton secretion by osteoclasts (55Lee B.S. Gluck S.L. Holliday L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29164-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), but whether this is also the case in other cell types remains to be elucidated. In addition, although the role of the actin cytoskeleton in regulating clathrin-mediated endocytosis is clearly emerging (20Apodaca G. Traffic. 2001; 2: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 63Guilherme A. Soriano N.A. Bose S. Holik J. Bose A. Pomerleau D.P. Furcinitti P. Leszyk J. Corvera S. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10593-10605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), its role in the recycling of V-ATPase, which utilizes unique clathrin- and caveolin-independent mechanisms (51Brown D. Breton S. J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 199: 2345-2358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 64Breton S. Lisanti M.P. Tyszkowski R. McLaughlin M. Brown D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), has not been demonstrated yet.In this study, we used epididymal clear cells as a model system to examine the role of actin cytoskeleton modulation via gelsolin in regulating V-ATPase-dependent proton secretion. This model allows the study of V-ATPase recycling in intact cells while they reside in their native epithelium. The epididymis establishes a low luminal pH of 6.5-6.8 to maintain spermatozoa in a quiescent state during their maturation and storage in this organ. We have shown previously that clear cells are key players in this acidification process (43Breton S. Smith P.J. Lui B. Brown D. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 470-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that V-ATPase recycling in these cells is strongly dependent on luminal pH and that a bicarbonate-regulated soluble adenylyl cyclase-dependent rise in cAMP in response to alkaline luminal pH induces an accumulation of V-ATPase in the apical membrane, leading to significant elongation of V-ATPase-containing microvilli (65Pastor-Soler N. Beaulieu V. Litvin T.N. Da Silva N. Chen Y. Brown D. Buck J. Levin L.R. Breton S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49523-49529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The resulting increase in proton secretion by clear cells would re-establish the pH of the lumen to its resting acidic value. We now show that polymerization of the actin cytoskeleton inhibits the alkaline pH-induced V-ATPase apical cell-surface mobilization in gelsolin-rich clear cells. In addition, a PIP2-binding peptide that competes for the binding of PIP2 with gelsolin, thereby preventing uncapping of gelsolin from actin filament barbed ends, favors the apical membrane accumulation of V-ATPase. We also show that the phospholipase C (PLC) calcium signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of V-ATPase trafficking. These data point to a major role for the actin cytoskeleton-remodeling protein gelsolin in regulating V-ATPase endocytosis, a process that is broadly used by specialized acidifying V-ATPase-expressing cells in various tissues and organs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTissue Fixation and Immunofluorescence—Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were anesthetized using an intraperitoneal sodium pentobarbital injection of 10 mg/100 g of body weight. They were then perfused through the left ventricle of the heart with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 12 mm phosphate buffer containing 137 mm NaCl and 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4), followed by PLP fixative containing 10 mm sodium periodate, 75 mm lysine, 4% paraformaldehyde, and 5% sucrose. Epididymides were harvested and further fixed overnight at 4 °C in PLP fixative. Tissues were then washed in PBS and stored in PBS containing 0.02% sodium azide.PLP-fixed epididymides were cryoprotected in a solution of 30% sucrose in PBS, and 5-μm cryostat sections were cut and picked up onto Fisher Superfrost Plus microscope slides as described previously (42Breton S.

Sections were hydrated for 15 min in PBS and treated with 1% SDS, an antigen retrieval technique that we have described previously (66Brown D. Lydon J. McLaughlin M. Stuart-Tilley A. Tyszkowski R. Alper S. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 105: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding of the antibody was blocked by preincubation of sections with 1% bovine serum album in PBS containing 0.02% sodium azide for 15 min. Sections were then incubated with the primary antibody for 90 min at room temperature, followed by two washes of 5 min in high salt PBS (2.7% NaCl) to reduce nonspecific staining and one wash in normal PBS. The secondary antibody was applied for 1 h at room temperature and washed as described above. Double labeling was performed by subsequent incubation of the sections with additional primary and secondary antibodies.The primary antibodies used were as follows. Affinity-purified chicken or rabbit antibodies raised against the last 10 C-terminal amino acids (C-GANANRKFLD) of the E subunit of the V-ATPase were used at a 1:5 or 1:50 dilution, respectively, and have been characterized previously (59Breton S.

A rabbit polyclonal antibody against gelsolin, kindly provided and characterized previously by Dr. David J. Kwiatkowski (39Lueck A. Brown D. Kwiatkowski D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3633-3643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used at a 1:1200 dilution. A monoclonal antibody raised against chicken gizzard actin (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA) was used at a 1:100 dilution. The secondary antibodies used were donkey anti-chicken antibody coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate (7.5 μg/ml), goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to Cy3 (2 μg/ml) or fluorescein isothiocyanate (7.5 μg/ml), and goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to Cy3 (2 μg/ml) and were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). All antibodies were diluted in Dako antibody diluent. The slides were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) diluted 1:1 with 1.5 m Tris buffer, pH 8.5. Some slides were mounted in Vectashield containing the DNA marker 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to stain the nucleus. Images were acquired either with a Hamamatsu Orca charge-coupled device camera mounted on a Nikon E800 epifluorescence microscope using IPLab Spectrum software (Scanalytics, Inc., Fairfax, VA) or with a Zeiss Axioplan microscope equipped with a Radiance 2000 confocal laser scanning system (Bio-Rad). Final images were imported into and printed from Adobe Photoshop.Western Blotting—Homogenate from total epididymis was resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) and boiled for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer containing 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol. Electrophoresis was performed using Tris/glycine/SDS running buffer (Boston BioProducts, Inc., Worcester, MA) on 4-20% polyacrylamide gel (Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville, Inc., Walkersville, MD). After transfer to Immun-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), an overnight incubation was performed at 4 °C with anti-gelsolin antibody at a dilution of 1:10,000. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce) was then applied at a 1:10,000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were detected using Western Lightning Western Blot Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Detection of Proton Secretion Using a Self-referencing Proton-selective Electrode—The effect of actin polymerization by jasplakinolide on proton secretion from intact vas deferens was measured using an extracellular proton-selective electrode as we have described previously (42Breton S.

https://openalex.org/W2107017822,"This study provides new perspectives of the unique aspects of platelet-derived growth factor β-receptor (PDGFR-β) signaling and biological responses through the establishment of a mutant mouse strain in which two loxP sequences were inserted into the introns of PDGFR-β genome sequences. Isolation of skin fibroblasts from the mutant mice and Cre recombinase transfection in vitro induced PDGFR-β gene deletion (PDGFR-βΔ/Δ). The resultant depletion of the PDGFR-β protein significantly attenuated platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB-induced cell migration, proliferation, and protection from H2O2-induced apoptosis of the cultured PDGFR-βΔ/Δ dermal fibroblasts. PDGF-AA and fetal bovine serum were mitogenic and anti-apoptotic but were unable to induce the migration in PDGFR-βΔ/Δ fibroblasts. Concerning the PDGF signaling, PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, and JNK, but not p38, decreased in PDGFR-βΔ/Δ fibroblasts, but PDGF-AA-induced signaling was not altered. Overexpression of the phospholipid phosphatases, SHIP2 and/or PTEN, inhibited PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 in PDGFR-βΔ/Δ fibroblasts but did not affect that of JNK and p38. These results indicate that disruption of distinct PDGFR-β signaling pathways in PDGFR-βΔ/Δ dermal fibroblasts impaired their proliferation and survival, but completely inhibits migratory response, and that PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 possibly mediated by PDGFR-α is regulated, at least in part, by the lipid phosphatases SHIP2 and/or PTEN. Thus, the PDGFR-β function on dermal fibroblasts appears to be critical in PDGF-BB action for skin wound healing and is clearly distinctive from that of PDGFR-α in the ligand-induced biological responses and the underlying properties of cellular signaling.

Westermark B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1283-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). PDGF family members, PDGF-A, -B, -C, and -D, are assembled as disulfide-linked homo- or heterodimers and exert their activity by binding to and activating specific high affinity cell surface receptors. Two receptor subtypes with protein-tyrosine kinase activity have been identified that can form homo- and heterodimeric receptor complexes: the α-subunit, which can bind to the A-, B-, and C-chains of PDGF, and the β-subunit, specific for the B-, C- and D-chains (1Heldin C.H.

Dermal fibroblasts are one of the major target cells of PDGF in the initiation and propagation of wound healing in the skin (5Singer A.J. Clark R.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 738-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (4607) Google Scholar). Levels of PDGF receptor (PDGFR)-α expression are high in fibroblasts during early embryogenesis, and disruption of PDGFR-α results in a reduction in fibroblasts throughout the embryo (6Orr-Urtreger A. Lonai P. Development (Camb.). 1992; 115: 1045-1058PubMed Google Scholar, 7Schatteman G.C. Morrison-Graham K. van Koppen A. Weston J.A. Bowen-Pope D.F. Development (Camb.). 1992; 115: 123-131PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, targeted deletion of PDGFR-β and analysis of blastocyst chimeras demonstrated no effect of PDGFR-β on fibroblast development (8Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1888-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 9Crosby J.R. Seifert R.A. Soriano P. Bowen-Pope D.F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, in mice prepared from the blastocyst chimeras that contain a combination of wild-type and PDGFR-β-/- cells, analysis of granulation tissue formation following the subcutaneous implantation of sponges demonstrated that PDGFR- β-/- cells were depleted in the granulation tissue (10Crosby J.R. Tappan K.A. Seifert R.A. Bowen-Pope D.F. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 1315-1321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These reports suggest that the two subtypes of PDGFR play distinct roles in development and that PDGFR-β is important in wound healing by dermal fibroblasts. Analysis of mutant mice in which the cytoplasmic signaling domain of the PDGFR-β was used to replace the PDGFR-α cytoplasmic domain showed no obvious defects in any of the PDGFR-α-dependent cell types (11Klinghoffer R.A. Mueting-Nelsen P.F. Faerman A. Shani M. Soriano P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). On the other hand, when the PDGFR-β was dependent upon PDGFR-α cytoplasmic domain, multiple abnormalities occurred in vascular smooth muscle cell development (11Klinghoffer R.A. Mueting-Nelsen P.F. Faerman A. Shani M. Soriano P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These data suggest that PDGFR-β has unique signaling capacities compared with PDGFR-α. PDGF binding to the receptors activates a variety of intracellular signaling molecules (12Heldin C.H. Ostman A. Ronnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar). One of these is phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which results in the local accumulation of PI(3,4,5)P3 at the plasma membrane. Synthesized PI(3,4,5)P3 recruits the pleckstrin homology domain-containing signaling molecule Akt/PKB to the membrane (12Heldin C.H. Ostman A. Ronnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar, 13Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4621) Google Scholar). PDGFs are also known to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) families, including the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK. ERK1/2 is predominantly activated by receptor tyrosine kinases of growth factors, whereas JNK and p38 are preferentially activated by stress-inducing stimuli such as UV light, heat shock, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and by mitogenic stimuli as well (14Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar). The PI3K/Akt and MAPKs pathways play important roles in the regulation of cell growth, migration, and survival during the wound healing process (13Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4621) Google Scholar, 15Yates S. Rayner T.E. Wound Repair Regen. 2002; 10: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4354) Google Scholar), although the relative importance of these kinases in various cellular phenomena differ depending on the cell type (14Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar). SHIP2 and PTEN are recently identified phospholipid phosphatases that are thought to negatively regulate the PDGF activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway by removing 5′- and 3′-phosphates, respectively, from PI(3,4,5)P3. In addition, PTEN and SHIP2 also appear to inhibit PDGF activation of ERK1/2 (17Mahimainathan L. Choudhury G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15258-15268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 18Sasaoka T. Kikuchi K. Wada T. Sato A. Hori H. Murakami S. Fukui K. Ishihara H. Aota R. Kimura I. Kobayashi M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4204-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, the specific role of PDGFR-β in the activation of Akt and MAPKs and the implication of the phospholipid phosphatases in PDGFR-β-mediated signaling are still poorly understood. To elucidate the biological properties and signaling pathways of PDGFR-β, it is critical to analyze its function in non-transformed cells that physiologically express the receptor. Because homozygous disruption of PDGF-B or PDGFR-β results in perinatal death in mouse embryos (8Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1888-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 19Leveen P. Pekny M. Gebre-Medhin S. Swolin B. Larsson E. Betsholtz C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1875-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar), it has been difficult to evaluate the role of the PDGF-B/PDGFR-β system in repair of adult tissues, such as wound healing. To address this problem, we established a new mouse strain in which the PDGFR-β exons are flanked by two loxP sequences. The Cremediated recombination by adenovirus-gene transfer markedly reduced the expression of PDGFR-β in the dermal fibroblasts derived from the mutant mice without affecting the expression of PDGFR-α. By using these dermal fibroblasts, we studied the PDGF-induced biological effects, including proliferation, migration, and apoptosis, which are central processes in wound healing. In addition, we examined the involvement of PDGFR-β in the activation of Akt and MAPKs to clarify the intracellular signals activated by the PDGFs. Finally, we examined the effect of the phospholipid phosphatases, SHIP2 and PTEN, in the regulation of PDGF-BB signaling in dermal fibroblasts lacking PDGFR-β. Materials—Human recombinant PDGF-AA was provided by Strathmann Biotech AG (Hamburg, Germany), and human recombinant PDGF-BB was purchased from Invitrogen. Polyclonal anti-PDGFR-β antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Polyclonal anti-PDGFR-α antibody, polyclonal anti-Tyr857 phosphospecific PDGFR-β antibody, monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY99), monoclonal anti-Akt1 antibody, and monoclonal anti-PTEN antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

(Beverly, MA). Polyclonal anti-SHIP2 antibody was generated as described previously (20Ishihara H. Sasaoka T. Hori H. Wada T. Hirai H. Haruta T. Langlois W.J. Kobayashi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was obtained from BioWhittaker A Cambrex Inc. (Walkersville, MD). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was from Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). All other reagents were of analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma or Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Generation of PDGFR-βflox/flox Mutant Mice—For the construction of the targeting vector, a 13.5-kb BamHI/SpeI genomic fragment of the PDGFR-β gene from the 129X1/SvJ mouse was cloned into pBluescript SK-(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). We inserted a neomycin-thymidine kinase (neo-TK) selection cassette and one-loxP sequence at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, of the 3.3-kb FspI/HpaI genomic fragment that includes exons 4–7 encoding the extracellular domain of the PDGFR-β (Fig. 1A). The neo-TK selection cassette consisted of MC1-neo and MC1-TK selection cassette flanked by two loxP sites. A diphtheria toxin selection cassette (DT-A) was inserted at the 3′-end of the vector (Fig. 1A). After linearization, the vector was electroporated into 129SV mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. The obtained recombinant ES clones were transfected with the pCre-Pac plasmid by electroporation to delete the neo-TK selection genes. The resulting ES clones in which exons 4–7 of the PDGFR-β gene were flanked by two loxP sequences (PDGFR- βflox/+) were then injected into blastocysts to obtain chimeric mice. The chimeras were bred with C57BL/6 mice (Sankyo Laboratory, Tokyo, Japan) to obtain the F1 progenies containing the recombinant allele (PDGFR-βflox/+). These F1 progenies were cross-bred to obtain PDGFR- βflox/flox homozygous mice. Genotyping was performed by both Southern blotting and PCR-based analyses. The probes for Southern blotting are shown in Fig. 1A. The primers for genomic PCR were as follows: primer 1, 5′-TAGCCATGGAGTCATCTCTTCAGCCCTAAA-3′; primer 2, 5′-CCTGCATCAAGTAGCTCACAACTGCCTGTA-3′; primer 3, 5′-TTCTTGTCTGAGAGCCTGTTGTGTGATGGA-3′; primer 4, 5′-TGTCTGCAGATCTCTAGCCTTGGGGAAATC-3′; and primer 5, 5′-AGCAAGGTCGCGCAAGGGATAACAGC-3′. Adenovirus—We used adenovirus expression vectors with an E1-deleted replication deficiency. Two adenoviral vectors expressing Cre recombinase and LacZ tagged with a nuclear localization signal under the control of the CAG promoter (21Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Izumu Saito (Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan) (22Kanegae Y. Lee G. Sato Y. Tanaka M. Nakai M.

Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1411-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was a generous gift of Dr. Tomoichiro Asano (Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan). The SHIP2-expressing adenovirus vector was constructed as described previously (18Sasaoka T. Kikuchi K. Wada T. Sato A. Hori H. Murakami S. Fukui K. Ishihara H. Aota R. Kimura I. Kobayashi M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4204-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Infection with Adenovirus—Mouse dermal fibroblast cells were prepared from 8- to 12-week-old male control C57BL/6 mice and PDGFR-βflox/flox mice. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body weight), and a full thickness of the back skin was cut out by scissors. The skin tissues were cut into small pieces and were implanted into plastic tissue culture dishes containing DMEM with 10% FBS. The fibroblast cultures were used after three to seven passages. Cre recombinase, PTEN, and SHIP2 were transiently expressed in cultured cells by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. Cells were infected in DMEM containing 5% FBS at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10 pfu/cell. After 16 h, the virus was removed by replacing the medium. Experiments were conducted 24–48 h after the initial addition of the virus. DNA Synthesis Assay—The cultured fibroblasts obtained from wild-type or PDGFR-βflox/flox mice were infected with Cre-adenovirus as described above. The cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS for an additional 24 h. The cells were then plated into 96-well plates at 1.5 × 104 cells/well in DMEM containing 10% FBS. After 24 h, the cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then were incubated for 18 h with 1 nm PDGF-AA, 1 nm PDGF-BB, or 10% FBS in DMEM containing 10 mm 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd). BrdUrd incorporation into DNA was determined with a 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine labeling and detection kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions and detected with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (Nippon InterMed. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Wound Scratch Assay—Confluent cultured fibroblasts obtained from wild-type or PDGFR-βflox/flox mice were grown in 6-well plates and were infected with Cre-adenovirus as described above. The cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS for an additional 24 h. After the cells were serum-starved for 24 h in DMEM, they were scratched with a 1-ml plastic pipette tip and washed twice with PBS to remove the floating cells. The cells were then cultured in DMEM supplemented with 1 nm PDGF-AA, 1 nm PDGF-BB, or 10% FBS. After 48 h, the cells were viewed with an inverted phase contrast microscope (Olympus CK30, Tokyo, Japan) and photographed. Apoptosis Assay—Apoptosis was detected using an APOPercentage™ kit (Biocolor Ltd., Belfast, Northern Ireland). Briefly, confluent wild-type or PDGFR-β flox/flox fibroblasts grown in 6-well plates were infected with the Cre-adenovirus as described above. After infection, the cells were replated into 12-well plates and cultured for an additional 24 h in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Apoptosis was induced by 1 μm H2O2 in 1 ml of DMEM containing 1 nm PDGF-AA, 1 nm PDGF-BB, or 10% FBS, and 50 μlofAPOPercentage Dye. After 60 min, the medium was drained from the wells, and the cells were washed twice with PBS. The cells were then observed with an inverted phase contrast microscope. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Confluent wild-type and PDGFR-βflox/flox fibroblasts grown in 6-well plates were infected for 16 h with the Cre-adenovirus at an m.o.i. of 10 pfu/cell. The cells were then incubated for 24 h in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Next, the cells were serum-starved for 48 h and then treated with various concentrations of PDGF-AA or PDGF-BB at 37 °C for the indicated times. The cells were lysed for 15 min at 4 °C in a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm Na3VO4, 150 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin (pH 7.4). Lysates obtained from the same number of cells were centrifuged to remove insoluble materials. The supernatants were incubated with the indicated antibodies for 4 h at 4 °C, and then immune complexes were mixed with glutathione-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were precipitated by centrifugation. Immune complexes or whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and then electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were incubated for 1 h at 20 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat dry milk. The membranes were then probed with specified antibodies for 16 h at 4 °C. After the membranes had been washed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20, the blots were incubated with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Immunoreactive bands were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunofluorescence—Cultured wild-type or PDGFR-βflox/flox fibroblasts were infected with the Cre-adenovirus as described above and were replated in chamber slides. All staining procedures were performed at room temperature. After growth for 24 h, the cells were fixed with 1% formalin in PBS for 10 min. Nonspecific immunoreactions were blocked by incubation for 20 min with 10% goat serum in PBS. Cells were then incubated for 2 h with 1:100 anti-PDGFR-β, washed three times for 5 min with PBS, and then incubated for 1 h with 1:1,000 Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The cells were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and observed with an Olympus AX80 microscope. Statistical Analysis—All data were presented as means ± S.D. Student's t test was used to determine the p values, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. PDGFR-βflox/flox Mutant Mice Are Healthy and Show No Gross Abnormalities—After transfection of the targeting vector (Fig. 1A) and selection with neomycin, we obtained four ES cell clones with homologous recombination out of the 319 clones examined. In addition to a 12.8-kb fragment, clones that had undergone recombination generated a 7.3-kb fragment in Southern blotting using a 5′-probe after digestion of the genomic DNA with XbaI (Fig. 1B). Generation of a 5.7-kb fragment after SacI digestion and an 8.8-kb fragment after XbaI digestion was detected by Southern blotting using a 3′-probe and neo probe, respectively (Fig. 1B). ES cell clones that had undergone homologous recombination were transfected with Cre-expressing plasmid (pCre-Pac; gift from Dr. Takeshi Yagi, Osaka University, Japan) to delete the neo-TK selection cassette. Deletion of the neo-TK selection gene was confirmed by Southern blotting with an internal probe (data not shown). The resulting ES clones (PDGFR- βflox/+) were used for the generation of chimeric mice. The PDGFR-βflox/+ ES clones were also transfected with the pCre-Pac plasmid to confirm that the Cre recombinase can induce recombination and eliminate the floxed PDGFR-β allele. After transfection with the pCre-Pac plasmid, genomic PCR with primers 1, 2, and 5 generated bands of 271, 329, and 410 bp, which corresponded to the PDGFR-β genes for wild-type, floxed, and deleted alleles (PDGFR-β Δ), respectively (Fig. 1C). These results confirmed that the Cre recombinase caused PDGFR-β gene deletion in the PDGFR-βflox/+ ES cells. The chimeras generated from PDGFR-βflox/+ ES cells were bred with C57BL/6 mice, generating F1 progenies containing the recombinant allele (PDGFR-βflox/+). These mice were crossed with each other to obtain homozygous PDGFR-βflox/flox mice. The PDGFR-βflox/flox mice were healthy, and no gross abnormalities were detected. The genotype of the mice was confirmed by PCR with primers 1 and 2 (Fig. 1D) and primers 3 and 4 (data not shown). PCR with primers 1 and 2 generated a 271-bp band from the wild-type PDGFR-β gene and a 329-bp band from the floxed allele. Adenovirus-mediated Cre Expression Eliminates the Expression of PDGFR-β in PDGFR-βflox/flox Dermal Fibroblasts—We first investigated whether Cre-adenovirus infection could abrogate the expression of PDGFR-β in PDGFR-βflox/flox dermal fibroblasts. Similar levels of PDGFR-β were expressed in both wild-type and PDGFR-βflox/flox fibroblasts in the absence of Cre-adenovirus infection (Fig. 2A). Treatment with 1 nm PDGF-BB induced similar levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFR-β in both types of fibroblast (Fig. 2A). Infection with the Cre-adenovirus caused a marked reduction in the expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFR-β in PDGFR- βflox/flox but not wild-type fibroblasts. However, Cre transfection had no effect on the expression of PDGFR-α in wild-type or PDGFR-βflox/flox fibroblasts (Fig. 2A). Immunofluorescent studies revealed that the cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for the PDGFR-β was eliminated in greater than 90% of PDGFR- βflox/flox fibroblasts after Cre transfection (PDGFR-βΔ/Δ) (Fig. 2B). The effects of Cre transfection were further assessed by examining PDGF-AA- and PDGF-BB-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFR-α and PDGFR-β. Stimulation by either PDGF-AA or PDGF-BB induced equivalent and dose-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFR-α in both Cre-transfected wild-type and PDGFR-βflox/flox fibroblasts (Fig. 2C, a and b). In contrast, PDGF-BB-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFR-β was not detected in PDGFR-βΔ/Δ fibroblasts, although it was clearly observed in wild-type fibroblasts following Cre transfection (Fig. 2C, c). Thus, Cre transfection of PDGFR-βflox/flox fibroblasts selectively abrogated the expression and function of PDGFR-β but not PDGFR-α. PDGF-BB- and Fetal Bovine Serum-induced BrdUrd Incorporation Is Decreased after PDGFR-β Gene Deletion—PDGFR is known to play an important role in cell proliferation (12Heldin C.H. Ostman A. Ronnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of Cre transfection on PDGF-AA-, PDGF-BB-, and fetal bovine serum (FBS)-induced BrdUrd incorporation in wild-type and PDGFR-βflox/flox fibroblasts. As shown in Fig. 3, 1 nm PDGF-AA induced similar levels of BrdUrd incorporation in wild-type and PDGFR-βΔ/Δ cells. In contrast, 1 nm PDGF-BB- and 10% FBS-induced BrdUrd incorporation were significantly decreased in PDGFR-βΔ/Δ fibroblasts compared with wild-type fibroblasts, 48.4 ± 1.2 and 34.2 ± 1.9%, respectively. These results demonstrate a significant contribution of PDGFR-β to cell proliferation in response to PDGF-BB and FBS, but not PDGF-AA. In Vitro Repair of a Scratch Wound Is Inhibited after PDGFR-β Gene Deletion—Because PDGFR is also known to be implicated in cell migration (12Heldin C.H. Ostman A. Ronnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the effect of the deletion of the PDGFR-β gene on the combined migratory and proliferative response to scratch wounding that mimics aspects of wound healing. A wound was formed in confluent cell monolayers by scratching with a plastic pipette tip. In wild-type fibroblasts cultured for 48 h with 1 nm PDGF-BB, the wound was completely closed (Fig. 4, A and B). Similarly, substantial numbers of wild-type fibroblasts had filled in the scratched area following treatment with 10% FBS for 48 h (Fig. 4, E and F). In contrast, the scratched wound remained unclosed at 48 h after culture with 1 nm PDGF-BB in PDGFR-βΔ/Δ fibroblasts (Fig. 4, C and D). Wound closure was mostly suppressed in PDGFR-βΔ/Δ cells after culture with 10% FBS (Fig. 4, G and H). These results indicate that the PDGF-BB/PDGFR-β system is essential for the combined migration and proliferation required to fill in a scratch wound with PDGF-BB- and 10% FBS as stimulants and suggest that the role of PDGF-α is minimal. This concept was further supported by the fact that PDGF-AA did not induce apparent wound closure in either wild-type or PDGFR-βΔ/Δ cells (Fig. 4, I–L). Apoptosis Induced by H2O2 Is Enhanced by Elimination of the PDGFR-β Gene—We next examined the effect of the deletion of the PDGFR-β gene on H2O2-induced apoptosis in dermal fibroblasts. To detect apoptosis, we utilized the APOPercentage™ kit, which stains apoptotic cells but not necrotic cells with a purple-red color (24Charalampopoulos I. Tsatsanis C. Dermitzaki E. Alexaki V.I.

Few apoptotic cells were observed in wild-type or PDGFR-βΔ/Δ fibroblasts when the cells were cultured with 10% FBS (data not shown). In wild-type cells cultured with DMEM supplemented only with 0.2% bovine serum albumin, the addition of H2O2 increased the number of apoptotic cells by 78.3 ± 3.2%. The addition of 1 nm PDGF-BB protected wild-type cells from apoptosis. However, PDGFR-"

It is unclear which pathways dominate in vivo. As a new step to resolve this issue, we identified and tested 6-bromo-6-deoxy-l-ascorbic acid as a specific candidate for SVCTs. In high performance liquid chromatography and electron paramagnetic resonance analyses, the reduced compounds ascorbic acid and 6-bromo-6-deoxy-l-ascorbic acid were similar. The oxidized products 6-bromo-6-deoxy dehydroascorbic acid (BrDHA) and dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) had comparable stabilities, based on reduction recoveries. Upon expression of GLUT1 or GLUT3 in Xenopus oocytes, BrDHA was neither transported nor bound, in contrast to robust transport of DHA. The findings were not explained by differences in the oocyte reduction of DHA and BrDHA because lysed oocytes reduced both compounds equally. Further, there was no transport of the reduced compound, 6-bromo-6-deoxy-l-ascorbic acid, by GLUT1 or GLUT3. As a prerequisite for investigating 6-bromo-6-deoxy-l-ascorbic acid transported by SVCTs, SVCT2 transport activity in oocytes was enhanced 14-fold by construction and use of a vector that added a fixed poly(A) tail to the 3′ end of cRNA. For SVCT1 and SVCT2 expressed in oocytes, similar Km and Vmax values were observed for ascorbic acid and 6-bromo-6-deoxy-l-ascorbic acid. In human fibroblasts, predicted to have SVCT-mediated ascorbate accumulation, Km and Vmax values were again comparable for ascorbic acid and 6-bromo-6-deoxy-l-ascorbic acid. Using activated human neutrophils, predicted to have ascorbate accumulation mediated predominantly by DHA and GLUT transporters, 6-bromo-6-deoxy-l-ascorbic acid accumulation was <1% of accumulation when compared with ascorbic acid. We conclude that 6-bromo-6-deoxy-l-ascorbic acid is the first transport substrate identified as completely specific for SVCTs, but not GLUTs, and provide a new strategy to determine the contribution of each pathway to ascorbate accumulation. Vitamin C intracellular accumulation is mediated by Na+-dependent vitamin C transporters SVCT1 and -2 and dehydroascorbic acid transporters GLUT1 and -3. It is unclear which pathways dominate in vivo. As a new step to resolve this issue, we identified and tested 6-bromo-6-deoxy-l-ascorbic acid as a specific candidate for SVCTs. In high performance liquid chromatography and electron paramagnetic resonance analyses, the reduced compounds ascorbic acid and 6-bromo-6-deoxy-l-ascorbic acid were similar. The oxidized products 6-bromo-6-deoxy dehydroascorbic acid (BrDHA) and dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) had comparable stabilities, based on reduction recoveries. Upon expression of GLUT1 or GLUT3 in Xenopus oocytes, BrDHA was neither transported nor bound, in contrast to robust transport of DHA. The findings were not explained by differences in the oocyte reduction of DHA and BrDHA because lysed oocytes reduced both compounds equally.

We conclude that 6-bromo-6-deoxy-l-ascorbic acid is the first transport substrate identified as completely specific for SVCTs, but not GLUTs, and provide a new strategy to determine the contribution of each pathway to ascorbate accumulation. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is accumulated by many tissues, but the transport mechanisms responsible are controversial (1Goldenberg H. Schweinzer E. J. Bioenerg.

Three possibilities exist: transport and accumulation of ascorbic acid by Na+-dependent transporters (4Diliberto Jr., E.J. Heckman G.D. Daniels A.J. J. Biol.

To distinguish among these possibilities requires the isolated transporters, an appropriate expression system, and a substrate that is specific for the ascorbic acid transporters or DHA transporters but not both. 6-Halo-ascorbates are attractive candidate substrates for two reasons. First, they inhibit ascorbic acid but not DHA transport in cells (11Rumsey S.C. Welch R.W. Garraffo H.M. Ge P. Lu S.F. Crossman A.T. Kirk K.L. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23215-23222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Second, the products of oxidation of 6-halo-6-deoxy-l-ascorbic acids, the 6-halo-dehydroascorbic acids, cannot cyclize, in contrast to DHA, which exists in solution predominantly as a bicyclic hemiketal (see Fig. 1e) (12Tolbert B.M. Ward J.B. Seib P.A. Tolbert B.M. Ascorbic Acid: Chemistry, Metabolism, and Uses. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1982: 101-123Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the properties of the 6-halo-ascorbates themselves have been only partially described (11Rumsey S.C. Welch R.W. Garraffo H.M. Ge P. Lu S.F. Crossman A.T. Kirk K.L. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23215-23222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it previously has been impossible to perform additional key experiments. Thus, for some time, there has been clear evidence that DHA is transported by some Na+-independent glucose transporters (GLUTs) (6Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Fischbarg J. Golde D.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 13Rumsey S.C. Kwon O. Xu G.W. Burant C.F. Simpson I. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18982-18989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). However, distinct Na+-dependent vitamin C transporters (SVCT1, SVCT2) have been isolated only more recently (14Tsukaguchi H. Tokui T. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Chen X.Z. Wang Y. Brubaker R.F. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Based on its distribution, SVCT2 is the best Na+-dependent transporter candidate to mediate ascorbate tissue accumulation (14Tsukaguchi H. Tokui T. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Chen X.Z. Wang Y. Brubaker R.F. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, because the activity of this transporter in expression systems is low (14Tsukaguchi H. Tokui T. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Chen X.Z. Wang Y. Brubaker R.F. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 15Daruwala R. Song J. Koh W.S. Rumsey S.C. Levine M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), the requisite experiments could not be undertaken. In this study, we describe a means to enhance the activity of SVCT2 ∼14-fold in the Xenopus oocyte expression system and characterize the experimental properties of the reduced halo-ascorbate 6-bromo-6-deoxy-l-ascorbic acid and its oxidized product 6-bromo-6-deoxy dehydroascorbic acid (BrDHA). These compounds were tested as substrates for expressed Na+-dependent vitamin C transporters, SVCT1 and SVCT2, and for expressed DHA transporters, GLUT1 and GLUT3. The results show that 6-bromo-6-deoxy-l-ascorbic acid is completely specific for SVCT1 and -2 and is not transported by GLUT1 and -3, whereas the oxidized form BrDHA is not transported by any of these transporters. These data represent the first full characterization of an ascorbate-specific transporter substrate and indicate that the 6-halo-ascorbate analogs are ideal compounds for resolving outstanding issues in the biology of ascorbate accumulation. Reagents—[14C]Ascorbic acid (4–8 mCi/mmol) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Tris(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine hydrochloride, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione, dithiothreitol, EDTA, phosphate buffers, and bromine were obtained from Sigma. Methanol was purchased from J. T. Baker. Histopaque-1083, HEPES, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, and dimethyl sulfoxide were obtained from Sigma. (3-(3-Cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio-1-propanesulfonate was purchased from J. T. Baker. Dextran T-500 was from Amersham Biosciences. Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium was from BIOSOURCE Inc. All other reagents were of the highest available commercial grade. Synthesis of Ascorbate Analogs—6-Deoxy-6-halo-l-ascorbic acids were prepared using a previously published procedure (16Kiss J. Berg K.P. Dirsherl A. Oberhansli W.E. Arnold W. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1980; 63: 1728-1739Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with modifications (11Rumsey S.C. Welch R.W. Garraffo H.M. Ge P. Lu S.F. Crossman A.T. Kirk K.L. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23215-23222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). HPLC Analysis—Ascorbate mass was measured by reverse phase HPLC using a 5μ, 250 × 4.6 mm C-18 column (Columbus, Phenomenex, Torrence, CA) with coulometric electrochemical detection as described previously (17Washko P.W. Hartzell W.O. Levine M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 181: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). 6-Deoxy-6-bromo, -iodo, and -chloro-l-ascorbic acid mass were also measured by HPLC, using the same detection system and settings but with a modification of the mobile phase methanol: water ratio to 47.5:52.5%. Bromine was used as described previously (13Rumsey S.C. Kwon O. Xu G.W. Burant C.F. Simpson I. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18982-18989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) to oxidize ascorbic acid and 6-halo ascorbate analogs to dehydroascorbic acid and 6-deoxy-6-bromo, -iodo, and -chloro dehydroascorbic acid, respectively. To quantitate the capacity of oocyte lysates to reduce DHA to ascorbic acid, lysates were incubated with [14C]DHA for 10 min. HPLC analysis was then used to separate [14C]ascorbic acid from [14C]dehydroascorbic. To separate [14C]ascorbic acid from endogenous ascorbic acid, eluted fractions were collected after HPLC separation at 10-s intervals and analyzed by scintillation spectrometry. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance—Ascorbic acid and 6-bromo-6-deoxy-l-ascorbic acid were adjusted to a final concentration of 250 μm in the presence of 50 mm phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and 50 μm EDTA. The free radical reaction was initiated by adding ferric sulfate (Fe(II) SO4) at a final concentration of 5 μm. For electron paramagnetic resonance measurements of the ascorbyl acid free radical and 6-deoxy 6-bromo ascorbyl acid free radical, samples from the reaction mixture were drawn into a gas-permeable Teflon capillary tube (Zeus Industries) of 0.81-mm inner diameter, 0.38-mm wall thickness, and 15-cm length. Each capillary was folded four times, inserted into a narrow quartz tube open at both ends (2.9-mm diameter), and then placed into the cavity of a Varian E-109 X-band spectrometer. Electron paramagnetic resonance settings were as follows: 1.25-G modulation amplitude, 100-kHz modulation frequency, and 10-milliwatt microwave power. Spectrophotometry—Spectrophotometric measurements were performed using an 8453A Hewlett Packard diode array spectrophotometer set at absorbance 265 nm. The kinetics of ascorbic acid and 6-bromo-6-deoxy-l-ascorbic acid recovery from their oxidized equivalents were studied following the addition of reducing agents, 10 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine hydrochloride or 0.04 mg/ml glutaredoxin (18Park J.B. Levine M. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and 10 mm glutathione. Visualization of recovery was achieved using UV-visible Chemstation software. Each data point represents one sample reaction repeated three times. Plasmids and Constructs—Rat GLUT1 and human GLUT3, SVCT1, and SVCT2 cRNA were prepared by cutting plasmid vectors with the appropriate restriction enzymes followed by an in vitro transcription reaction using the SP6 or T7 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion). Poly(A) tailing of SVCT1 and -2 cRNA was undertaken using a poly(A) tailing kit (Ambion). The integrity of newly synthesized cRNA was assessed using a 1% agarose-6% formaldehyde gel. cRNA concentration was determined using an 8453A Hewlett Packard diode array spectrophotometer set at absorbance 260/280 nm. Construction of Human SVCT2p(A)18 pCR2.1—Human SVCT2 poly(A) cRNA was synthesized as described previously. GeneRacer oligo(dT) primer 5′-GCTGTCAAGCATACGCTACGTAACGGCATGACAGTG(T)18-3′ was annealed to SVCT2 poly(A), and a reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR was initiated according to the GeneRacer protocol (Invitrogen). Human SVCT2 forward primer 5′-ATGAGGGCCCAGAGAGACCTCG-3′ and GeneRacer RNA primer 5′-CGACUGGAGCACGAGGACACUGACAUGGAUGAAGGAGUAGAAA-3′ were used to amplify human SVCT2p(A)18 cDNA by PCR. The resultant PCR product was then subcloned into TOPO-PCR2.1 (Invitrogen), and the presence of SVCT2 with a fixed length poly(A)18 tail at the 3′ end was confirmed by ABIprism cycle sequencing. Xenopus Oocyte Transport Assay—Xenopus oocytes were isolated and injected with 36 ng of cRNA coding for the glucose transporter isoforms, GLUT1 and GLUT3, and the Na+-dependent ascorbic acid transporter isoforms, SVCT1 and SVCT2 as described previously (13Rumsey S.C. Kwon O. Xu G.W. Burant C.F. Simpson I. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18982-18989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 15Daruwala R. Song J. Koh W.S. Rumsey S.C. Levine M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). 3 days after injection, individual oocytes were incubated with [14C]ascorbic acid or 6-bromo-6-deoxy-l-ascorbic acid, freshly prepared [14C]DHA, or BrDHA at the indicated concentrations for the times specified. After incubation at room temperature, oocytes were washed four times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Individual oocytes per replicate were solubilized with 10% SDS, and internalized radioactivity was quantified by scintillation spectrometry as pmol/oocyte. Each data point represents the mean value of 10–20 oocytes ± S.D. Each experiment was repeated a minimum of three times with similar results. Fibroblast Culture—Human skin fibroblasts were cultured as described (5Welch R.W. Bergsten P. Butler J.D. Levine M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Strain CRL-1497 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium with 4.5 g glucose/liter and without glutamine (BIOSOURCE) supplemented with 0.1 mm minimum essential medium non-essential amino acid solution, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured using 200-ml culture flasks (Nunc Inc.) in 5% CO2, 95% humidified incubator at 37 °C. Cultures were subdivided using 0.05% trypsin with 0.53 mm EDTA. All experiments were performed at passage numbers 8–12. Neutrophil Isolation—Neutrophils were isolated from heparinized whole blood collected from healthy male volunteers (19Washko P.W. Rotrosen D. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18996-19002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neutrophils were separated from other cellular components by Histopaque-1083 density centrifugation followed by dextran sedimentation and osmotic lysis of residual erythrocytes with hypotonic saline. Neutrophils were suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution without calcium, magnesium, or phenol red (pH 7.4) to a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml using particle count and size analyzer (Z2, Coulter Corp.). For ascorbic acid transport experiments, neutrophils were plated on 24-well Costar culture plates (Corning) to a final concentration of 1 × 106 cells/well in 10 mm HEPES-PO4 buffer (pH 7.4) containing 147 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.9 mm KH2PO4, 1.1 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mm glucose, 0.3 mm MgSO4·7H2O, 1.0 mm MgCl2·6H2O, 1.5 mm CaCl2·2H2O. Neutrophils were incubated to allow the cells to attach to the wells for 1 h and then washed with HEPES buffer. Fibroblast and Neutrophil Transport Assays—Fibroblasts were plated on 6-well culture plates (3506, Costar) and grown for ∼7 days until confluent. 30 min before experiments, culture medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium without fetal bovine serum. Ascorbic acid and 6-bromo-6-deoxy-l-ascorbic acid were added to plated fibroblasts at the indicated concentration, with superoxide dismutase (11.3 μg/well), catalase (450 units/well), and glutathione (100 μm) added to prevent oxidation of ascorbic acid and 6-bromo-6-deoxy-l-ascorbic acid. After a 2-h incubation, the medium was transferred for external ascorbic acid and 6-bromo-6-deoxy-l-ascorbic acid measurement. Fibroblasts were washed two times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH. 7.4), and intracellular ascorbic acid and 6-bromo-6-deoxy-l-ascorbic acid were extracted with 75% methanol, 1 mm EDTA for 5 min. Cellular protein was assayed with the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce) (20Smith P. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Probenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.K. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18348) Google Scholar) after solubilization with 0.1 n NaOH, 1% 3-(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio-1-propanesulfonate. Neutrophils were activated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (55 ng/ml) and N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (5 μm). Neutrophils were incubated in HEPES containing superoxide dismutase (11.3 μg/well), catalase (450 units/well), dithiothreitol (100 μm), and 50 μm 6-bromo-6-deoxy-l-ascorbic acid or [14C]ascorbic acid in 24-well culture plates for 60 min. After incubation, the extracellular buffers were removed, and external substrate concentrations were determined by HPLC and scintillation spectrometry. Neutrophils were washed with cold HEPES buffer twice and extracted with 60% methanol, 1 mm EDTA for 10 min on ice. Intracellular substrate concentrations were then determined as described previously. Each fibroblast and neutrophil experiment was repeated three times with similar results. Transport results were calculated as concentrations based on intracellular volumes (5Welch R.W. Bergsten P. Butler J.D. Levine M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19Washko P.W. Rotrosen D. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18996-19002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and fibroblast kinetics were expressed as Eadie-Hofstee plots. Error bars were omitted when S.D. was less than symbol size. RT-PCR Analysis of GLUT1, GLUT3, SVCT1, and SVCT2 Expression—Total RNA from human neutrophils and fibroblasts were extracted using QIAamp RNA blood and RNeasy kits (Qiagen), respectively. RT-PCRs were performed using Superscript One-Step RT-PCR kit with Platinum Taq (Invitrogen) and primers at a final concentration of 1 μm. Human primers are as follows: GLUT1 forward primer, 5′-ACCATGAGAAGAGGGCCTGTGGGAGCCTG-3′; GLUT1 reverse primer, 5′-ATCCTGAGTCGAAGTCTAAGCCGTTGCAG-3′; GLUT3 forward primer, 5′-CTCCTTCCACCTCCCTCCCGGCATGGGAAA-3′; GLUT3 reverse primer, 5′-CTTTTCCTCTCCTATATCCCCTAGTGCGGC-3′; SVCT1 forward primer, 5′-ATGAGGGCCCAGGAGGACCTCG-3′; SVCT1 reverse primer, 5′-TGGAACAGCGGCAGCCGGAT-3′; SVCT2 forward primer, 5′-CTGAGCTCATGGCGATCTAC-3′; SVCT2 reverse primer, 5′-CATGTCAGGTAGTGCTGTAGCCCCA-3′. Human kidney and whole brain total RNA (1 μg/μl) were used as controls for gene expression (Clontech), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) primers (Clontech) were used to determine PCR efficiency: G3PDH forward primer, 5′-TGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGT-3′; G3PDH reverse primer, 5′-CATGTGGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC-3′. For cDNA synthesis and predenaturation, 1 cycle of 50 °C for 20 min and 94 °C for 2 min was performed on total RNA. For PCR amplification, 40 cycles of 94 °C for a 15-s denaturation, 55 °C for 30 s of annealing, 68 °C for a 50-s extension, and 1 cycle of 72 °C for a 5-min final extension were performed using Peltier thermal cycler (MJ Research). Characterization of 6-Halo-ascorbic Acid Analogs and Halodehydroascorbic Acid Analogs—To dissect vitamin C transport pathways, an ideal substrate would be transported by SVCTs but not GLUTs (or vice versa). We chose to investigate 6-halo ascorbic acid analogs because the reduced forms of these analogs are similar to ascorbic acid in structure (Fig. 1) and thus should be transported by SVCT1 and SVCT2. On the other hand, the oxidized form of ascorbic acid (DHA) has been shown to exist in solution as hydrates and can also form a cyclic hemiketal (Fig. 1e) (12Tolbert B.M. Ward J.B. Seib P.A. Tolbert B.M. Ascorbic Acid: Chemistry, Metabolism, and Uses. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1982: 101-123Google Scholar). This latter structure cannot be formed in the absence of the 6-hydroxyl group. If this planar cyclic hemiketal is important for transport, the 6-halo ascorbic acid analogs should behave quite differently in the oxidized form and should not be transported by GLUT1 and GLUT3. A sensitive and accurate platform for analog detection must be available to study transport specificities. Fig. 2A is a representative HPLC chromatogram of 100 pmol of ascorbic acid and 6-deoxy-6-bromo, -iodo, and -chloro-l-ascorbic acid and shows the reduced forms of the analogs to be pure with no detectable secondary or interfering peaks. The quantification of analog transport can therefore be undertaken by HPLC analysis. In the use of analogs to dissect vitamin C transport pathways, analogs must be completely oxidized, with oxidation similar to that of ascorbic acid. Fig. 2B is a representative chromatogram of 100 pmol of DHA and 6-deoxy-6-bromo, -iodo, and -chloro dehydroascorbic acid. The figure shows that 6-halo dehydroascorbic acid analogs are undetectable by HPLC analysis and are thus completely oxidized, similar to DHA. Because of the ease of synthesis and purification of 6-bromo-6-deoxy-l-ascorbic acid and its similarity to other 6-halo-ascorbates, subsequent studies focused on this compound. As a further test of oxidation profiles, the formation of ascorbyl radical intermediates was measured from ascorbic acid and 6-bromo-6-deoxy-l-ascorbic acid (Fig. 2C). Ferric(II) sulfate, which auto-oxidizes to ferrous(III) sulfate under neutral pH and aerobic conditions (21Samuni A.M. Krishna M.C. DeGraff W. Russo A. Planalp R.P. Brechbiel M.W. Mitchell J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1571: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), was used to drive the formation of the free radical species. In the absence of Fe(II), no free radical species were observed, indicating that ascorbic acid and 6-bromo-6-deoxy-l-ascorbic acid were stable in solution under the test conditions. An electron paramagnetic resonance signal was detected only in the presence of Fe(II), indicating the production of ascorbyl and 6-deoxy-6-bromo ascorbyl free radical adducts. The areas under the curve for ascorbyl and 6-deoxy-6-bromo ascorbyl free radicals were similar, indicating similar degrees of oxidation. To validate transport studies, it is necessary to show that the oxidized analog, BrDHA, is stable enough to be available for transport, similar to DHA. The analysis of stability could not be assessed directly by HPLC because oxidized analogs and DHA were undetectable (Fig. 2B). Instead, stability was measured by determining the recovery (reduction) of oxidized analog at various time points after oxidation, using spectrophotometry for detection. Fig. 3, A and B, demonstrate that DHA and BrDHA were 80–100% recovered 0–20 min after oxidation. At 40 min after oxidation, DHA and BrDHA were 100 and 60% recovered, respectively. As a further test of recovery, glutaredoxin and glutathione were used as a reducing system after oxidation (18Park J.B. Levine M. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). DHA and BrDHA were 100% recovered (100% reduced) up to 20 min after oxidation (data not shown). Subsequent experiments with oxidized analog were undertaken within 20–40 min of oxidation. To quantify oocyte transport of oxidized analog by HPLC, oocytes must be able to internally reduce any oxidized analog if it is transported. To this end, internal oocyte reduction capacity was assessed using mechanically lysed oocytes incubated for 10 min with 10–320 μm [14C]DHA or BrDHA (Fig. 4). The reduction of BrDHA was measured directly by HPLC. [14C]DHA reduction to [14C]ascorbic acid was analyzed using HPLC to separate the two compounds, with the quantification of each peak by scintillation spectrometry as described under “Materials and Methods.” [14C]DHA was used because oocytes contain ascorbic acid, and endogenous ascorbic acid created an interfering high background for the assessment of DHA reduction capability. Fig. 4 displays the scintillation and HPLC analysis of the concentration/recovery curve. These data show that the oocyte reductions of [14C]DHA and BrDHA were equivalent over the selected concentration range. Thus, if BrDHA is transported into oocytes, the analog will be reduced and readily measured. Analyses of BrDHA Transport by GLUTs—Having confirmed the stability and reduction properties of BrDHA, as described above, transport of this analog was studied in GLUT1- and GLUT3-injected oocytes, with DHA transport as controls (Fig. 5). Intracellular accumulation of 300 μm [14C]DHA and BrDHA was assayed by scintillation spectrometry and HPLC, respectively. [14C]DHA transport via GLUT1 and -3 was linear for 40 min, whereas BrDHA transport and reduction were undetectable by HPLC analysis. These data indicate that BrDHA is not transported at all by GLUT1 and GLUT3. The possibility was tested that BrDHA binds to, but is not transported by, GLUT1 and GLUT3. [14C]DHA uptake by GLUT1 and GLUT3 was measured when unlabeled DHA or BrDHA concentrations were varied (Fig. 6). Unlabeled DHA competed with [14C]DHA transport mediated by GLUT1 and GLUT3, whereas unlabeled BrDHA had no effect. These data indicate that oxidized analog does not interact with the substrate binding sites of either GLUT1 or GLUT3, whereas DHA interacts as expected. Analyses of 6-Bromo-6-deoxy-l-ascorbic Acid Transport— Previous studies using Xenopus oocytes have shown SVCT2 transporter activity to be almost 300 times below that of SVCT1 (14Tsukaguchi H. Tokui T. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Chen X.Z. Wang Y. Brubaker R.F. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 15Daruwala R. Song J. Koh W.S. Rumsey S.C. Levine M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Therefore, before the accurate quantification of 6-bromo-6-deoxy-l-ascorbic acid transport using SVCT2-injected oocytes could be undertaken, an enhanced expression system needed to be obtained. Polyadenylation was a potential method to enhance translation (22Huez G. Marbaix G. Hubert E. Leclercq M. Nudel U. Soreq H. Salomon R. Lebleu B. Revel M. Littauer U.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3143-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Fig. 7 shows the effects of poly(A) tailing on SVCT1 and -2 ascorbic acid transport in oocytes. As expected, [14C]ascorbic acid transport mediated by SVCT1 was easily detectable by scintillation spectrometry, whereas SVCT2 ascorbic acid transport was nea"
https://openalex.org/W2023568083,"The translocation of Bax from the cytosol into the mitochondrial outer membrane is a central event during apoptosis. We report that beyond the addressing step, which involves its first α-helix (hα1), the helices α5 and α6 (hα5α6) are responsible for the insertion of Bax into mitochondrial outer membrane bilayer. The translocation of Bax to mitochondria is associated with specific changes in the conformation of the protein that are under the control of two prolines: Pro-13, which controls the unfolding of hα1, and Pro-168, a proline located immediately before the hydrophobic carboxyl-terminal end (i.e. helix α9, hα9), which controls the disclosure of hα5α6. An additional step, the disruption of an electrostatic bond formed between Asp-33 (hα1) and Lys-64 (BH3), allows the mitochondria addressing of Bax. We conclude that, although the intramolecular interactions of hα1 with the BH3 region control the addressing of Bax to mitochondria, the Pro-168 is involved in the control of its membrane insertion through hα5α6. The translocation of Bax from the cytosol into the mitochondrial outer membrane is a central event during apoptosis.

The BCL-2 family of proteins is a central regulator of apoptosis, because these proteins are the final integrators of most death signals (1Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3325) Google Scholar). This family is divided into two groups: the first with anti-apoptotic/pro-survival properties such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, Mcl-1, and the second with pro-apoptotic/death-promoting properties such as Bax and Bak (1Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3325) Google Scholar). These two groups of proteins share some degrees of homology, which are restricted to three domains called BH1, BH2, and BH3. Associated with this family are proteins like Bid or Bad, with a homology with Bcl-2 limited to the BH3 region only and hence called BH3-only proteins (BOP) 1The abbreviations used are: BOP, BH3-only protein; ART, apoptosis-regulating targeting; CT, carboxyl-terminal end; cyt c, cytochrome c; DOX, doxorubicin; GBM, glioblastoma multiforme; Hα, α-helix; IP, immunoprecipitation; IVT, in vitro translated; NT, amino-terminal end; MOM, mitochondrial outer membrane; BdGBM, human glioblastoma multiforme; RFP, red fluorescent protein; CLIC, cytosol locked in conformation; CLAC, cyt c liberation-associated conformation; CF, correlation factor.1The abbreviations used are: BOP, BH3-only protein; ART, apoptosis-regulating targeting; CT, carboxyl-terminal end; cyt c, cytochrome c; DOX, doxorubicin; GBM, glioblastoma multiforme; Hα, α-helix; IP, immunoprecipitation; IVT, in vitro translated; NT, amino-terminal end; MOM, mitochondrial outer membrane; BdGBM, human glioblastoma multiforme; RFP, red fluorescent protein; CLIC, cytosol locked in conformation; CLAC, cyt c liberation-associated conformation; CF, correlation factor.

Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar). These proteins activate or sensitize to apoptosis by interacting with Bcl-2 family members: the multidomain pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak can be activated directly by BOP-like Bid, whereas another BOP-like Bad activates apoptosis by binding to and thus inactivating anti-apoptotic proteins (2Huang D.C. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 3Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar). The main function of Bax and Bak appears to be the induction of permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM), through a mechanism that remains obscure (4Sharpe J.C. Arnoult D. Youle R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1644: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). According to the rheostat model (5Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 189-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar), interactions between anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins directly or indirectly regulate apoptosis through the permeabilization of MOM. Bax is a globular protein, present in the cytosol of resting cells, in an inactive state. However, in response to apoptotic stimuli, Bax undergoes specific conformational changes, which allow its targeting/insertion into MOM (1Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3325) Google Scholar). Bid induces conformational changes in Bax that cause its dimerization and integration into mitochondrial membranes (6Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 7Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.-C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Structural studies of Bax (8Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar) show that this protein consists of nine helices α (hα) that are able to form a hydrophobic pocket into which a BH3 peptide from another protein may bind. These studies also showed that the hα5α6 of Bcl-xl, Bcl-2, and Bax are structurally similar to the pore-forming domain of the colicins A/E1 and diphtheria toxin (9Schendel S.L. Montal M. Reed J.C. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The latter result suggests that both proteins could be able to function as membrane ions channels and as such facilitate MOM permeabilization during apoptosis (9Schendel S.L. Montal M. Reed J.C. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, it has been shown that Bax formed ionic channels in artificial membranes and that the electrical activity was indeed associated with the hα5hα6 (10Nouraini S. Six E. Matsuyama S. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1604-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 11Heimlich G. McKinnon A.D. Bernardo K. Brdiczka D. Reed J.C. Kain R. Kronke M. Jurgensmeier J.M. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The lack of mitochondrial integration of Bax in the absence of a death signal is correlated with a repression imposed upon the targeting signal of Bax by the NH2-terminal (NT) domain (i.e. the first 20 amino acids of Bax α) called ART for apoptosis-regulating targeting sequence (12Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that both the NT and carboxyl termini (CT) of Bax cooperated to maintain the inactive cytosolic conformation of Bax (12Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 13Nechushtan A. Smith C.L. Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2330-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that the hα1 of Bax, which immediately follows the ART domain, carries a MOM targeting signal, because this sequence causes the addressing to mitochondria of a cytosolic protein and this construct, unlike a similar construct with hα9, inhibits the association of Bax with mitochondria (14Cartron P.F. Juin P. Oliver L. Martin S. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4701-4712Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that deletion of the hydrophobic CT of Bax (i.e. hα9) did not modify the intracellular localization in the presence of the ART domain (15Tremblais K. Oliver L. Juin P.

Commun. 1999; 254: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), whereas a deletion of both sequences enhanced Bax binding to MOM (18John G.B. Anjum R. Khar A. Nagaraj R. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 278: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 20Cartron P.-F. Priault M. Oliver L. Meflah K. Manon S. Vallette F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11633-11641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Bax NT and not its CT are involved in Bax translocation to mitochondria. Conversely, Schinzel et al. (21Schinzel A. Kaufmann T. Schuler M. Martinalbo J. Grubb D. Borner C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) have recently reported that a Pro located near the CT of Bax (Pro-168) was crucial in directing Bax localization to mitochondria and could allow a hα9-mediated targeting of a reporter cytosolic protein. Because Bax-induced targeting to, insertion into, and permeabilization of MOM is a crucial step in the implementation of many forms of apoptosis, we have investigated the role of the helices α 1, 9, 5, and 6 in the acquisition of mitochondria-bound Bax conformation. Materials—Unless specified, all reagents used in this study were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). The following antibodies were used: monoclonal anti-cytochrome c 6H2B4 from BD Bioscience (St. Quentin Yvelines, France), monoclonal anti-Bax 2D2 and 6A7 antibodies from R&D Systems (Lille, France), and the antibody Ab-4 form Oncogene (Calbiochem). The affinity-purified polyclonal antibody TL41 was raised against the Bax BH3 region peptide (i.e. residues 57–72) as described previously (22Juin P. Hunt A. Littlewood T. Griffiths B. Swigart L.B. Korsmeyer S. Evan G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6158-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and the antibody AF820, raised against a synthetic peptide derived from residues 12–33 of human Bax α, was obtained from R&D Systems (see the localization of these sequences in Bax in Fig. 1). Monoclonal Bax antibody (clone 4F11) was from Immunotech and was used at a concentration of 1 μg/ml in confocal microscopy experiments. The mitochondrion-selective probe Mitotracker Green™ and Fluorescent Alexa 568™- and Alexa 468™-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes (Interchim, Montlucon, France) and the fluorogenic peptide Ac-DEVD-AMC from Bachem (Voisins, France). Plasmids and Cell Transfection—NT mutants of Bax were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using the PCR-based Gateway™ method and were subcloned into pDEST12.2 and pDEST3.2 plasmids according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The sequences of the primers used for site-directed mutagenesis are given in Table I. The other Bax mutants constructs have been described elsewhere (14Cartron P.F. Juin P. Oliver L. Martin S.

Biol. 2003; 23: 4701-4712Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) was transfected with the empty vector (pDEST12.2 or pDEST3.2.) or Bax mutants cloned into this vector. Plasmid DNAs (5 μg) were introduced into 106 BdGBM-Bak (-) cells by electroporation (GenePulser, Bio-Rad) using 200 V/cm and 250 microfarads, the transfected cells were selected in a medium containing neomycin (250 μg/ml) for 48 h. After selection, the bulk of transfected cells were used in in vitro experiments to avoid clonal bias as described previously (16Oliver L. Priault M. Tremblais K. LeCabellec M. Meflah K. Manon S. Vallette F.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 487: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Acellular Assay of Bax Insertion—Mitochondria were prepared from normal rat liver as described previously (24Guihard G. Bellot G. Moreau C. Pradal G. Ferry N. Thomy R. Fichet P. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46542-46550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Of note, the presence of endoplasmic reticulum markers such as GRP 78 was routinely checked by immunoblots prior to any further experiments, and in most cases, no or little contamination by endoplasmic reticulum was found in our mitochondria preparation. Cell-free association of Bax with the mitochondria was performed as described previously (23Cartron P.-F. Moreau C. Oliver L. Mayat E. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar): briefly, [35S]Met (Amersham Biosciences)-labeled proteins were synthesized from cDNAs using the TnT-coupled Transcription/Translation system from Promega (Lyon, France) to obtain IVT Bax. The post-translational insertion of IVT proteins into mitochondrial membranes and the subsequent alkaline treatment (0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.5) of the mitochondria were performed in a standard import buffer as described previously (23Cartron P.-F. Moreau C. Oliver L. Mayat E. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). IVT proteins bound to the mitochondria were recovered after centrifugation of the incubation mixture for 10 min at 4 °C and at 8000 × g in the pellet. [35S]Met-IVT Bax associated with isolated mitochondria was analyzed in a SDS-PAGE and scanned with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The amount of proteins present in the gel was quantified with the IP Lab gel program (Signal Analytics, Vienna, VA) and expressed as a percentage of initial input. To analyze the release of mitochondrial apoptogenic factors from mitochondria, the supernatant derived from the latter acellular assay was incubated together with a non-apoptotic cellular extract, and the DEVDase activity was measured in these extracts as described before (23Cartron P.-F. Moreau C. Oliver L. Mayat E. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For the release of cytochrome c (cyt c), 20 μl of supernatant from the acellular assay was analyzed by immunoblotting and quantified with the IP Lab gel program. In all experiments, the aggregation of proteins was controlled by incubating the Bax constructs with non-relevant antibodies in the absence or presence of mitochondria. Of note, we never found a significant amount of proteins aggregating under our conditions (data not shown). Binding of IVT Bax to Bcl-2 or its stimulation by p13-tBid was performed as described previously (14Cartron P.F. Juin P. Oliver L. Martin S. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4701-4712Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Quantification of Apoptosis—BdGBM cells (2 × 106 cells), transfected with the different Bax constructs, were cultured in the presence or in the absence of doxorubicin (DOX, 2 μg/ml) for 16 h before quantification of apoptosis by measurement of DEVDase activities. Briefly, the cells were washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline, plated in 96-well plates, and then the caspase-3 fluorogenic substrate (Ac-DEVD-AMC) was added in the presence of 0.01% Triton X-100 and enzymatic activity was quantified in a fluorometer over a period of 1 h (t1), whereas the activity was in a linear range. The activities were calculated from the differences measured between t1 and t0 and thus were not affected by the different backgrounds. Confocal Analysis—For laser confocal microscopy analysis, the cells were incubated for 30 min with 5 μg/ml MitoTracker Green™ at 37 °C then fixed with 1:1 methanol/acetone for 15 min at -20 °C. After saturation with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated with anti-Bax and anti-cyt c antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were extensively washed, and then the conjugated secondary antibodies were added for 1 h at 37 °C. The weak auto fluorescence due to doxorubicin, which was mostly located in the nuclei of the treated cells, did not interfere with our analyses. Images were collected on a Leica TCS NT microscope with a 63 × 1.3 NA Fluotar objective (Leica, France). Quantification of the overlay of labeling was done using a MetaMorph 4.6 program (Universal Imaging Corp.). The correlation factor (CF) is a measure of the strength of the relationship between two variables, x (labeling specific for the mitochondria) and y (labeling specific for the protein of interest), and was calculated as instructed by the manufacturer (www.universal.imaging.com). On average, calculations were performed after analysis of 50 different cells for four independent experiments. Subcellular Fractionation and Immunoprecipitation Experiment— Cell fractionation was performed as described in Cartron et al. (20Cartron P.-F. Priault M. Oliver L. Meflah K. Manon S. Vallette F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11633-11641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (www.zymed.com/methods/ip.html). Bax or its mutants were incubated in the presence of 4 μg of antibodies 2D2, 6A7, Ab-4, TL41, or AF820 for up to 16 h at 4 °C. Antibody-protein complexes were then incubated with gentle rocking first with a second antibody for 2 h at 4 °C and then with Zysorbin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for an additional 2 h at 4°C. The agarose beads were collected by centrifugation for 5 s at 13,000 × g. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline before resuspension in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Controls immunoprecipitated (IP) were carried out in parallel with unrelated poly- or monoclonal antibodies. SDS-PAGE analysis and quantification of the IP IVT proteins using a PhosphorImager were performed as described for IVT protein insertion into mitochondria. Bacterial Two-hybrid Assay—The interaction between Bax domains was assayed using the Bacteriomatch™ two-hybrid system (Stratagene). This assay measured the interaction between polypeptides fused to the NT of RNA polymerase α in a target plasmid (pTRG) and a sequence fused to the bacteriophage λcl protein in a bait plasmid (pBT). The interaction between the proteins ensured the survival of bacteria in a selective media. The binding of Bax hα1 with Bax BH3 was screened using as a bait the plasmid encoding for hα1-RFP (pBT-Hα1Bax-RFP), whereas the target plasmids encoded for Bax α (pTRG-Bax α), Bax Ψ (pTRG-Bax Ψ), and Bax α deleted of its first 37 amino acids (pTRG-Bax α Δ37), the BH3 region (pTRG-Bax ΔBH3), or expressing only this domain (pTRG-Bax BH3). Bacteria transformation, growth, and selection were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (www.stgn.com/manuals/982000.pdf). The hα1 Mediates Bax Targeting to Mitochondria while the hα5α6 Is Involved in Its Membrane Insertion—It has recently been shown that the hα1 of Bax behaves as an endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane (TM) segment when fused to Escherichia coli Leader peptidase (25Garcia-Saez A.J. Mingarro I. Perez-Paya E. Salgado J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10930-10943Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we have shown that Bax hα1 is a mitochondrial targeting signal but not a membrane insertion domain for the MOM (20Cartron P.-F. Priault M. Oliver L. Meflah K. Manon S. Vallette F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11633-11641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Because, during apoptosis, Bax is inserted into MOM as a membrane-embedded protein (26Schinzel A. Kaufmann T. Borner C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1644: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we have performed a series of mutants and deletions along the Bax α sequence to localize the anchor domain of Bax for the MOM. An epitope-mapping technique to detect changes in the conformation was also used to complement the mutagenesis experiments (Fig. 1 and Table II).Table IIMapping of the conformation of the Bax constructs by immunoprecipitation with different anti-Bax antibodies 1% Triton was used to expose all epitopes as described in Hsu et al.

Using the same system, several reports have shown that the association of Bax α with mitochondria in cell-free systems is extremely low (12Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R.

Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). For this reason, the first 20 amino acids of Bax have been called ART for apoptosis-regulating targeting domain (12Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The ART-deleted form of Bax α is equivalent to Bax Ψ, a variant of Bax identified in a series of brain tumors. This form of Bax is constitutively associated with mitochondria and particularly apoptogenic (29Cartron P.F. Oliver L. Martin S. Moreau C. LeCabellec M.T. Jezequel P. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 675-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that neither hα1 nor the hydrophobic CT were the membrane anchor domain of Bax α or Bax Ψ (20Cartron P.-F. Priault M.

A hairpin pair of amphipathic helices hα5α6 has been predicted to form a pore and to be involved in the membrane insertion of Bax α (10Nouraini S. Six E. Matsuyama S. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Mol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 1604-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) have shown that the substitution of 8 out of 10 charged residues in this domain of Bax with an Ala resulted in a loss of cytotoxicity. We performed these mutations, which we called hα5α6 M (Fig. 1), in several Bax constructs with or without the NT or CT (i.e. Bax α, Bax Ψ, and Δhα9 derivatives) and examined their effects on the association of Bax with mitochondria using a cell-free system. As shown in Fig. 2a, a L26G mutation abolished the association of Bax α and Bax Ψ with mitochondria, as previously shown (20Cartron P.-F. Priault M. Oliver L. Meflah K. Manon S. Vallette F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11633-11641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), whereas mutations in hα5α6 (hα5α6M) or the deletion of hα9 had no effect. Similarly, a mutation in hα1(i.e. A24R), which was designed to generate a canonical mitochondrial addressing signal (30Wiedemann N. Frazier A.E. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14473-14476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), had no effect on the association of Bax with mitochondria, suggesting that the hα1 did not carry a conventional targeting sequence. Alkali treatment of the mitochondrial pellet revealed that only Bax Ψ was inserted into mitochondria and that this insertion was altered by the hα5α6 mutations and not by a deletion of Bax CT (Δhα9) (Fig. 2a). The functionality of the association/insertion of Bax mutants was assessed by quantification of cyt c release into the supernatant in cell free assay. As illustrated in Fig. 2b, only Bax Ψ and Bax ΨΔhα9 induced the liberation of cyt c from mitochondria, and this release was inhibited in hα1 and hα5α6 mutants. These results ruled out the possibility that Bax constructs, associated with mitochondria as observed in Fig. 2a, was simply aggregated on the surface of the organelle. These different constructs were expressed in BdGBM cells (14Cartron P.F. Juin P. Oliver L. Martin S. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4701-4712Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and apoptosis was induced with DOX as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 2c, the deletion of hα9 in Bax α had no influence on the induction of cell death but increased the apoptogenicity of Bax Ψ as described before (20Cartron P.-F. Priault M. Oliver L. Meflah K. Manon S. Vallette F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11633-11641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). On the other hand, both the hα1 and hα5α6 mutations decreased cell death to that observed with a control plasmid (Fig. 2c). Altogether, these results suggest that hα1 regulates the targeting, and the association of Bax with mitochondria and the hα5α6 regulates its membrane insertion. Conformational changes in"
https://openalex.org/W2095323010,"The methanogenic archaean Methanococcus maripaludis can use ammonia, alanine, or dinitrogen as a nitrogen source for growth. The euryarchaeal nitrogen repressor NrpR controls the expression of the nif (nitrogen fixation) operon, resulting in full repression with ammonia, intermediate repression with alanine, and derepression with dinitrogen. NrpR binds to two tandem operators in the nif promoter region, nifOR(1) and nifOR(2). Here we have undertaken both in vivo and in vitro approaches to study the way in which NrpR, nifOR(1), nifOR(2), and the effector 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) combine to regulate nif expression, leading to a comprehensive understanding of this archaeal regulatory system. We show that NrpR binds as a dimer to nifOR(1) and cooperatively as two dimers to both operators. Cooperative binding occurs only with both operators present. nifOR(1) has stronger binding and by itself can mediate the repression of nif transcription during growth on ammonia, unlike the weakly binding nifOR(2). However, nifOR(2) in combination with nifOR(1) is critical for intermediate repression during growth on alanine. Accordingly, NrpR binds to both operators together with higher affinity than to nifOR(1) alone. NrpR responds directly to 2OG, which weakens its binding to the operators. Hence, 2OG is an intracellular indicator of nitrogen deficiency and acts as an inducer of nif transcription via NrpR. This model is upheld by the recent finding (J. A. Dodsworth and J. A. Leigh, submitted for publication) in our laboratory that 2OG levels in M. maripaludis vary with growth on different nitrogen sources."
https://openalex.org/W2065678231,"Of 12 naturally occurring, activating mutations in the seven-transmembrane (7TM) domain of the human Ca2+ receptor (CaR) identified previously in subjects with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (ADH), five appear at the junction of TM helices 6 and 7 between residue Ile819 and Glu837. After identifying a sixth activating mutation in this region, V836L, in an ADH patient, we studied the remaining residues in this region to determine whether they are potential sites for activating mutations. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis revealed five additional residues in this region that when substituted by alanine led to CaR activation. We also found that, whereas E837A did not activate the receptor, E837D and E837K mutations did. Thus, region Ile819–Glu837 of the 7TM domain represents a “hot spot” for naturally occurring, activating mutations of the receptor, and most of the residues in this region apparently maintain the 7TM domain in its inactive configuration. Unique among the residues in this region, Pro823, which is highly conserved in family 3 of the G protein-coupled receptors, when mutated to either alanine or glycine, despite good expression severely impaired CaR activation by Ca2+. Both the P823A mutation and NPS 2143, a negative allosteric modulator that acts on the 7TM through a critical interaction with Glu837, blocked activation of the CaR by various ADH mutations.

Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar, 2Hu J. Spiegel A.M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 14: 282-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Family 3 members are typically characterized by a large extracellular amino terminus comprised of Venus's flytrap (VFT)-like and cysteine-rich domains, in addition to the signature seven-transmembrane (7TM) domain of all GPCRs. The three-dimensional structure of the VFT domain of the rat metabotropic glutamate type 1 receptor showed that it is an intermolecular disulfide-linked dimer (3Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). Agonist binding to the cleft of the VFT leads to VFT closure and a 70° rotation of one monomer relative to the other about an axis perpendicular to the dimer interface. How this agonist-induced conformational change in the VFT domain is transmitted to the 7TM domain to cause CaR activation is a key unanswered question. Naturally occurring CaR mutations identified in subjects with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (ADH), in addition to validating the physiologic importance of the CaR in extracellular Ca2+ homeostasis (4Brown E.M. MacLeod R.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 239-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar), provide unique insights into CaR structure and function (2Hu J. Spiegel A.M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 14: 282-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Missense, activating mutations identified in ADH could help identify regions of the CaR particularly important for receptor activation. More than 30 such activating mutations have been identified to date in subjects with ADH (5Pidasheva S. D'Souza-Li L. Canaff L. Cole D.E. Hendy G.N. Hum. Mutat. 2004; 24: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and these are non-randomly distributed (Fig. 1). Ten ADH mutations cluster between residues 116–131 in a part of the VFT domain, loop 2, which is the site of intermolecular disulfide-linked dimerization (6Ray K. Hauschild B.C. Steinbach P.J.

We suggested that ADH loop2 mutations cause activation of the CaR by facilitating the agonist-induced conformational change in the VFT domain (2Hu J. Spiegel A.M. Trends Endocrinol.

Moreover, we had previously identified Glu837 in TM7 as a residue critical for action of positive allosteric modulators of the CaR (7Hu J. Reyes-Cruz G. Chen W. Jacobson K.A. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46622-46631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This suggested to us that the TM6/TM7 junction may also represent a switch region that is critically involved in the activation mechanism of the CaR. To begin to evaluate this possibility, we performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis of residues in this region. We identified multiple additional TM6/TM7 residues that lead to receptor activation upon substitution of alanine and a unique mutation in TM6, P823A, that blocks CaR activation, mimicking the effect of a negative allosteric modulator. Site-directed Mutagenesis of the hCaR—The full-length human CaR (hCaR) cDNA cloned in the pCR3.1 expression vector was described previously (8Ray K. Fan G.F. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31355-31361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Inc., La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Parental hCaR cDNA in pCR3.1 vector was amplified using pfu Turbo DNA polymerase with mutagenic oligonucleotide primers (sequences available on request) for 16 cycles in a DNA thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After digestion of the parental DNA with DpnI for 1 h, the amplified DNA with incorporated nucleotide substitution was transformed into Escherichia coli (DH-5α strain). The sequence of mutant receptors was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing using a dRho-damine Terminator cycle sequencing kit and ABI PRISM-373A DNA sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Transient Transfection of Wild Type and Mutant Receptors in HEK-293 Cells—Transfections were performed using 12 μg of plasmid DNA for each transfection in a 75-cm2 flask of HEK-293 cells. DNA was diluted in serum-free DMEM (BioFluids, Inc., Rockville, MD) mixed with diluted Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The DNA-Lipofectamine complex was further diluted in 6 ml of serum-free DMEM and was added to 80% confluent HEK-293 cells plated in 75-cm2 flasks. After 5 h of incubation, 15 ml of complete DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (BioFluids, Inc.) was added. 24 h after transfection, transfected cells were split and cultured in complete DMEM. Phosphoinositide (PI) Hydrolysis Assay—PI hydrolysis assay has been described previously (8Ray K. Fan G.F. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31355-31361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, 24 h after transfection, transfected cells from a confluent 75-cm2 flask were split. Typically oneeighth of cells were plated in one well in a 6-well plate, and whole cell lysate was prepared 48 h post-transfection for Western blot assay. The remaining cells were plated in two 12-well plates in complete DMEM medium containing 3.0 μCi/ml of 3H-labeled myoinositol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and cultured for another 24 h. Culture medium was replaced by 1× PI buffer (60 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 2.8 mm glucose, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm LiCl in 12.5 mm PIPES, pH 7.2) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After removal of PI buffer, cells were incubated for an additional 1 h with different concentrations of Ca2+ in 1× PI buffer with or without 1 μm calcimimetic compound NPS R-568 or calcilytic compound NPS 2143. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of acid-methanol (1:1,000 v/v) per well. Total inositol phosphates were purified by chromatography on Dowex 1-X8 columns, and radioactivity for each sample was counted with a liquid scintillation counter. Graphs of concentration dependence for stimulation of PI hydrolysis by [Ca2+]o for each transfection were drawn by using GraphPad Prism version 2.0 software. Each value on a curve is the mean of duplicate determinations unless otherwise indicated. Graphs shown in this paper were representative ones from at least three independent experiments. Synthetic Chemistry—The method for the synthesis of NPS R-568 was reported previously (9Hauache O.M. Hu J. Ray K. Xie R. Jacobson K.A. Spiegel A.M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4156-4163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The synthesis of (2R)-2-chloro-6-[-3-[[1,1-dimethyl-2-(2-naphthalenyl)ethyl]amino]-2-hydroxypropoxy]-(9-Cl)-benzonitrile of NPS 2143 was accomplished via the route of Thompson and co-workers (10Del Mar, E.

Reduction of 2-naphthalenecarbonitrile via the agency of lithium aluminum hydride in THF provided (naphthalen-6-yl)methanamine, and treatment with 2,4,6-triphenylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate produced the analogous 2,4,6-triphenylpyridium tetrafluoroborate salt in greater than 70% yield. Base catalyzed nucleophilic substitution with 2-nitropropane followed by the reduction of the nitro group via Raney-Ni catalyzed hydrogenation provided 2-(2-methyl-2-aminopropyl)naphthalene in moderate yields. 2-Chloro-6-hydroxybenzonitrile was attained through a nucleophilic aromatic substitution of the 6-fluoro species and coupling with (-)glycidyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonate provided 2-(((R)-oxiran-2-yl)methoxy)-6-chlorobenzonitrile in good yields. Finally, the union of 2-(((R)-oxiran-2-yl)methoxy)-6-chlorobenzonitrile and 2-(2-methyl-2-aminopropyl)naphthalene in t-butyl alcohol provided NPS 2143, which was utilized as the HCl salt following precipitation in a anhydrous ether solution of hydrochloric acid (11Seki T.

Immunoblotting—Confluent cells in 6-well plates were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped on ice in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and freshly added protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Applied Science). For immunoblotting of full-length receptors, 50 μg of protein per lane reduced with β-mercaptoethanol (5%) was separated on 5% SDS-PAGE gel. The proteins on the gel were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with 0.1 μg/ml of protein A-purified mouse monoclonal anti-hCaR antibody ADD (raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 214–235 of hCaR protein). Subsequently, the membrane was incubated with a secondary goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) at a dilution of 1:2,000. The hCaR protein was detected with an ECL (Amersham Biosciences).

The V836L mutation led to increased sensitivity of the CaR to Ca2+ activation (EC50 = 1.11 mm) compared with WT (EC50 = 3.08 mm), as did to varying degrees the five other ADH mutations, although as seen previously for other activating mutations identified in ADH, maximal activity at higher concentrations of Ca2+ was often lower than that of WT CaR (Fig. 2, left panel, and Table I).Table IEC50 values for [Ca2+]o stimulation of PI hydrolysis of wild type receptor and receptors containing activating mutations in the region of residues 819–837 Data shown are means ± S.E. of three to six experiments.MutationEC50[Ca2+] omMWT hCaR3.08 ± 0.07Naturally occurring activating mutation S820F1.25 ± 0.15 F821L1.42 ± 0.16 A824S2.22 ± 0.11 F832S1.45 ± 0.08 A835T1.74 ± 0.12 V836L1.11 ± 0.03Artificial activating mutation I819A2.71 ± 0.08 I822A2.08 ± 0.04 Y825A2.37 ± 0.06 G830A2.23 ± 0.13 K831A1.92 ± 0.04 E837D1.29 ± 0.05 E837K2.04 ± 0.11 Open table in a new tab Expression and Characterization of Alanine-scanning Mutations of CaR Residues in the TM6/TM7 Junction Region—To evaluate the importance of other residues in the TM6/TM7 junction region in determining sensitivity of CaR to activation by Ca2+, we systematically mutated individual residues from 819–837 (apart from the six identified as sites of ADH mutations) to alanine (Ala826 was mutated to Ser) and tested their expression and activity. Five of these residues when mutated to alanine, Ile819, Ile822, Tyr825, Gly830 and Lys831, caused increased CaR sensitivity to Ca2+ (Fig. 3, left panel, and Table I). Alanine substitution for other residues in this region (Ser827, Tyr829, Val833, Ser834) and serine substitution for Ala826 caused no significant change in Ca2+ sensitivity, whereas alanine substitution for Thr828 caused a slight reduction in sensitivity (data not shown). Alanine substitution for Glu837, as we reported earlier, did not affect Ca2+ sensitivity (7Hu J. Reyes-Cruz G. Chen W. Jacobson K.A. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46622-46631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, both aspartic acid and lysine substitution for Glu837 increased CaR sensitivity to Ca2+ (Fig. 3, left panel, and Table I). Identification of P823A as a Unique Inactivating CaR Mutation—Alanine substitution for Pro823 led to a drastic reduction in Ca2+ response despite excellent cell surface expression (refer to the upper band on the immunoblot) that is comparable with that of WT CaR (Fig. 4). Similarly, glycine substitution for Pro823 also severely impaired CaR activation by Ca2+, although the mutant was very well expressed at the cell surface (data not shown). For comparison, we studied three naturally occurring inactivating mutations identified in familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, V817I adjacent to Pro823 in TM6, S657Y in TM2, and P748R in TM4. The latter two mutations showed minimal response even at 30 mm Ca2+ and on immunoblot lacked the upper band indicating poor cell surface expression (data not shown). Although the V817I mutant showed reduced expression on immunoblot compared with WT CaR and showed a significant reduction in sensitivity to Ca2+, its activity exceeded that of the P823A mutant (Fig. 4). NPS R-568, a positive allosteric modulator that increases Ca2+ sensitivity of WT CaR, was able to increase significantly the response of the P823A mutant but did not restore its activity to WT levels (Fig. 5A). Because the P823A mutant maintained good CaR expression but severely reduced Ca2+ response, we were interested in determining the effect of this mutation when superimposed on activating CaR mutations. Double mutants of P823A combined with activating mutations in the VFT domain such as L125P (Fig. 5B) or N124K (data not shown) showed severely reduced Ca2+ sensitivity compared with either WT or the single activating mutant. Combining P823A with activating mutations in the 7TM domain such as V836L (Fig. 5C) or F832S (data not shown) likewise reduced Ca2+ sensitivity but not to the same degree as for VFT domain mutations. In contrast, combining P823A with a unique, constitutively activating mutation, A843E, lowered basal and maximal activation but did not eliminate constitutive activation (Fig. 5D). The changes in Ca2+ response observed with these double mutants was not a function of altered receptor expression as measured by immunoblot (data not shown).Fig. 5A, concentration dependence for [Ca2+]o stimulation of PI hydrolysis of CaR in transiently transfected HEK-293 cells expressing WT hCaR and P823A mutant hCaR with or without treatment of 1 μm NPS R-568.

J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 29: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Like the positive allosteric modulator NPS R-568, NPS 2143 critically depends on Glu837 for its action presumably because the central amine of both compounds binds to the negatively charged glutamate (18Petrel C.

Indeed, mutation of Glu837 to Asp or Lys increased sensitivity to Ca2+ (Fig. 3A, left panel); but whereas E837D remained subject to both activation by NPS R-568 and inhibition by NPS 2143, E837K lost responsiveness to either allosteric modulator (Fig. 6). We tested the effect of NPS 2143 on a series of other activating mutations of the CaR to determine whether they were sensitive to inhibition by the negative allosteric modulator. VFT domain activating mutants such as L125P (Fig. 7A), N124K (Fig. 7B), and K29E (not shown), as well as additional 7TM domain activating mutations such as V836L (Fig. 7C) all were inhibited by NPS 2143. In marked contrast, the constitutively activating A843E mutant was not affected by NPS 2143 (Fig. 7D).Fig. 7Concentration dependence for [Ca2+]o stimulation of PI hydrolysis of CaR in transiently transfected HEK-293 cells expressing L125P (A), N124K (B), V836L (C), and A843E (D) mutant hCaRs with or without treatment of 1 μm NPS 2143.

Metab. 2003; 14: 282-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) have identified activating CaR mutations in subjects with ADH. Unlike loss of function CaR mutations identified in subjects with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, the majority of which cause either loss of protein expression or receptor trafficking to the cell surface, missense mutations causing ADH may provide insight into the mechanism of CaR activation. Including the novel V836L mutation we identified, the 7TM domain ADH mutations include one missense mutation each in TM1 and TM3, none in TM2 and TM4, two in TM5, and four each in TM6 and TM7. Of the latter, six cluster at the junction of TM6 and TM7 (Ile819-Glu837). In addition to these naturally occurring activating mutations, we showed that five other residues in this region increase sensitivity to activation by Ca2+ when mutated artificially to alanine. Moreover, the remaining residues in this region could also be potential sites for activating mutation, as we found that whereas E837A was not activating, E837D and E837K mutations did activate the receptor. Although our studies of course do not exclude a role for other parts of the 7TM domain, these results suggest that a small part of this domain, i.e. Ile819–Glu837, involving the extracellular surface proximal portions of TM6 and TM7 may play a key role in CaR activation. Current models for GPCR activation are based largely on the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin (21Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Trong LeI. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5035) Google Scholar). 11-cis-retinal is covalently bound to Lys296 in TM7 and is bracketed by residues in TM3 and TM6. 11-cis-retinal and a series of helix-helix contacts involving primarily TM1–4 keep the 7TM domain in an inactive conformation. How photon-mediated retinal isomerization promotes the active rhodopsin conformation has not been clearly defined, but a recent NMR study suggests that “rigid body” motion of TM6 is a key element in the activation mechanism (22Patel A.B. Crocker E. Eilers M. Hirshfeld A. Sheves M. Smith S.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10048-10053Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A proline highly conserved in family 1 GPCRs, Pro267 in TM6 (6.50 in Ballesteros numbering scheme (23Ballesteros J.A. Shi L. Javitch J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar)), acts as a flexible hinge for rotation of TM6. Given the very limited sequence homology between the 7TM domains of family 1 versus family 3 GPCRs, one should be cautious in extrapolating from the rhodopsin three-dimensional structure to that of family 3 GPCRs. Nonetheless, it is interesting to speculate that a similar rotation of TM6 in the CaR acts as part of a “switch” mechanism upon receptor activation. A key role for Pro823 in such a TM6 rotation is suggested by the effects of the P823A mutation. Despite good expression of the mutant receptor, its ability to be activated by Ca2+ is drastically reduced. A positive allosteric modulator enhanced the Ca2+ response of the mutant receptor but not to WT levels. Further, the P823A mutation blocked or reduced the enhanced Ca2+ response of activating VFT or 7TM mutations. Pro823 is highly conserved in family 3 GPCRs but is in a slightly different location (6.53 rather than 6.50) than the proline in TM6 highly conserved in family1 GPCRs. The study of prolines and TM helix kinks in GPCRs by Yohannon et al. (24Yohannan S. Faham S. Yang D. Whitelegge J.P. Bowie J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) suggested that Pro to Ala mutations often do not impair structure or function because of compensatory evolutionary changes in residues in other helices. This does not appear to be true for Pro823 in the CaR, and we suggest that mutation of this residue in other family 3 GPCRs would have similar consequences. The P823A mutation had qualitatively, if not quantitatively, similar effects as the CaR negative allosteric modulator, NPS 2143. Both blocked the effects of agonist and of activating CaR mutations but had little if any effect on the A843E mutation that uniquely among ADH mutations causes constitutive activation (25Zhao X.M. Hauache O. Goldsmith P.K. Collins R. Spiegel A.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We and others recently found by alanine substitution that residue Glu837 is critical for the action of allosteric modulators of the CaR with a phenylalkylamine structure, such as NPS R-568 and NPS 2143 (7Hu J. Reyes-Cruz G. Chen W. Jacobson K.A. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46622-46631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 18Petrel C. Kessler A. Dauban P. Dodd R.H.

Chem. 2004; 279: 7254-7263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). It was speculated that a critical salt bridge might form between the negatively charged glutamate and the positively charged central amine in these compounds. We report here the study of E837D and E837K mutants providing direct evidence that the negative charge at residue 837 is crucial for the response of the CaR to both NPS R-568 and NPS 2143. Such responsiveness was abolished when Glu837 was substituted by either a neutral or positively charged residue. How agonist-induced VFT closure and dimer rotation leads to activation of the 7TM domain of family 3 GPCRs remains unclear. Our results, however, lead us to speculate that the TM6/TM7 junction region (Ilu819–Glu837) plays a critical role in maintaining the CaR in its inactive state. Mutation of many of the residues in this region, as well as the action of positive allosteric modulators binding to Glu837(such as NPS R-568), reduces the inhibitory constraints in the 7TM domain, thus enhancing sensitivity to Ca2+ activation. In contrast, negative allosteric modulators which also bind to Glu837 (such as NPS 2143) and the P823A mutation stabilize the inactive conformation of the CaR perhaps by impeding rotation of part of TM6. We suggest that the relative insensitivity of the A843E mutant to inhibition by NPS 2143 or by superimposing the P823A mutation reflects the more “distal” location of this mutation in TM7. The A843E mutation may cause a structural change in the CaR intracellular domain that directly leads to constitutive G protein activation and is less susceptible to constraints caused by changes elsewhere in the 7TM domain. A final point worth noting is the ability of NPS 2143 to inhibit the activity of all ADH mutations tested with the exception of A843E. ADH mutations, with the exception of the constitutively activating A843E, cause hypocalcemia and inappropriate inhibition of parathyroid hormone secretion and renal Ca2+ reabsorption by increasing the Ca2+ sensitivity of the CaR expressed in parathyroids and kidney. Conventional treatment of ADH using vitamin D and calcium supplements is unsatisfactory because of the resultant hypercalciuria leading to nephrolithiasis. Negative allosteric modulators such as NPS 2143 offer the possibility of more “physiologic” correction of the molecular defect in ADH by decreasing the sensitivity of the CaR to Ca2+, enhancing PTH secretion and renal Ca2+ reabsorption. Negative allosteric CaR modulators are currently under study for possible use in treatment of osteoporosis (26Stewart A.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 351: 324-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), but further studies in animal models and eventually in humans may be warranted to evaluate such agents for a new therapeutic indication, correction of hypocalcemia in subjects with ADH. We thank Ilaria Zamproni and Maria Carla Proverbio for assistance with identification of V836L mutation in the CaR gene of a patient with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia."
https://openalex.org/W2168221939,"The chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan aggrecan forms link protein-stabilized complexes with hyaluronan (HA), via its N-terminal G1-domain, that provide cartilage with its load bearing properties. Similar aggregates (potentially containing new members of the link protein family), in which other chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (i.e. versican, brevican, and neurocan) substitute for aggrecan, may contribute to the structural integrity of many other tissues including skin and brain. In this study, cartilage link protein (cLP) and the G1-domains of aggrecan (AG1) and versican (VG1) were expressed in Drosophila S2 cells. The recombinant human proteins were found to have properties similar to those described for the native molecules (e.g. cLP was able to form oligomers, and HA decasaccharides were the minimum size that could compete effectively for their binding to polymeric HA). Gel filtration and protein cross-linking/matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight peptide fingerprinting showed that cLP and AG1 interact in the absence or presence of HA. Conversely, cLP and VG1 did not bind directly to each other in solution yet formed ternary complexes with HA24. N-linked glycosylation of AG1 and VG1 was demonstrated to be unnecessary for either HA binding or the formation of ternary complexes. Surprisingly, the length of HA required to accommodate two G1-domains was found to be significantly larger for aggrecan than versican, which may reflect differences in the conformation of HA stabilized on binding these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2089558187,"We previously showed, using differential expression screening and in situ hybridization that Vanin-1, which encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked membrane-associated pantetheinase, is expressed in a sex-specific manner during fetal gonad development in mice (Bowles, J., Bullejos, M., and Koopman, P. (2000) Genesis 27, 124–135). In the present study we investigate in detail the expression and regulation of Vanin-1 in the fetal testis. Vanin-1 is co-expressed with the transcription factors steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) and SOX9 in Sertoli cells and, at a lower level, with SF-1 in Leydig cells in developing testes. SF-1 is able to activate the transcription of the Vanin-1 promoter in in vitro reporter assays, and this activation is further augmented by SOX9. We found that SF-1 is able to bind to two sites in the Vanin-1 promoter, whereas SOX9 can bind to a single interposed site defined by DNA footprinting. Mutation of the SF-1 or SOX9 sites disrupts the binding of these factors and activation of transcription. The expression of Vanin-1 was abolished in Leydig cells of a mouse mutant lacking SF-1 in that cell type. Our findings account for the sex- and cell-type-specific expression of Vanin-1 in the developing mouse gonad in vivo, which we suggest is required to provide an appropriate environment for male germ cell development. We previously showed, using differential expression screening and in situ hybridization that Vanin-1, which encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked membrane-associated pantetheinase, is expressed in a sex-specific manner during fetal gonad development in mice (Bowles, J., Bullejos, M., and Koopman, P.

Male and female gonads, although structurally and functionally quite distinct tissues, arise in the embryo from the same tissue primordia, the genital ridges. Their developmental trajectories begin to diverge about 10.5 days post coitum (dpc) 1The abbreviations used are: dpc, days post coitum; AMH, anti-Müllerian hormone; SF-1, steroidogenic factor 1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EMSA, electromobility shift assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. in mice, when Sry expression in XY genital ridges initiates testis determination. Many genes that operate downstream of Sry have been identified as being expressed male-specifically during sex determination and gonad differentiation, but little is known about how they are regulated, interact, and function within the overall scheme of sex differentiation. SRY is the eponymous founding member of the Sox (SRY-related HMG box) gene family, encoding a group of proteins that bind to DNA in a sequence-specific manner via their HMG (high mobility group) domain (1Bowles J. Schepers G. Koopman P. Dev. Biol. 2000; 227: 239-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Immediately following Sry induction the expression of SOX9, another member of the SOX family, is up-regulated in male genital ridges. Transgenic mouse studies have shown that expression of SOX9 is sufficient for testis formation (2Vidal V.P. Chaboissier M.C. de Rooij D.G. Schedl A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 216-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), whereas mutations in human SOX9 can result in XY sex reversal (3Foster J.W. Dominguez-Steglich M.A. Guioli S. Kwok C. Weller P.A.

These observations show that SOX9 is a key transcription factor in the male sex determination pathway. SOX9 plays an essential role in regulating the gene encoding anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), a key hormone required for the regression of the female duct system in male embryos. A homozygous mutation of the SOX9 binding site within this promoter in male mice ablates the expression of Amh, resulting in the retention of the Müllerian ducts and the generation of pseudohermaphrodites (4Arango N. Lovell-Badge R. Behringer R. Cell. 1999; 99: 409-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In conjunction with SOX9, steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) is also required to modulate levels of Amh expression (4Arango N. Lovell-Badge R. Behringer R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 29654-29660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). SF-1 (also known as Ad4BP or NR5A1) is an orphan nuclear receptor required for gonad and adrenal gland development that is expressed in the Leydig and Sertoli cells of the testis and in the adrenal cortex (6Hatano O. Takayama K. Imai T. Waterman M.R. Takakusu A. Omura T. Morohashi K. Development. 1994; 120: 2787-2797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ikeda Y. Shen W.H. Ingraham H.A. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Mice homozygous for a null mutation of SF-1 fail to develop adrenal glands and gonads, establishing SF-1 as an essential regulator required for their development (8Luo X. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 481-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). Many potential target genes for SF-1 have been determined, including several genes involved in steroidogenesis in the adrenal gland and Leydig cell lineage of the testis. Two of these targets encode proteins required for the rate-limiting steps in testosterone synthesis: steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein, which regulates cholesterol uptake into the mitochondria, and cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme, which catalyzes the first cleavage reaction in steroid biosynthesis (9Reinhart A.J. Willaims S.C. Clark B.J. Stocco D.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 729-741PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro studies suggest that the HMG domain of SOX9 interacts directly with the C-terminal domain of SF-1 to cooperatively activate expression from the Amh promoter in Sertoli cells (10de Santa Barbara P. Bonneaud N. Boizet B. Desclozeaux M. Moniot B. Su ̈dbeck P. Scherer G. Poulat F. Berta P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6653-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that a related SOX factor expressed by Sertoli cells, SOX8, can synergize with SF-1 in a similar fashion (11Schepers G. Wilson M. Wilhelm D. Koopman P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28101-28108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). There is further evidence to suggest that SOX9 may be responsible for the male-specific expression of SF-1, as it can bind to the proximal promoter of SF-1 and up-regulate expression in vitro (12Shen J.H.-C. Ingraham H.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although a large body of data indicates that SF-1 and SOX9 are critical transcription factors required for embryonic testis differentiation and are likely to cooperate in several steps of this process, only Amh has been identified as a direct target for these proteins. Vanin-1 has been identified as being expressed in a male-enriched fashion in the embryonic gonad by both subtractive hybridization (13Bowles J. Bullejos M. Koopman P. Genesis. 2000; 27: 124-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and microarray screening (14Grimmond S. Van Hateren N. Siggers P. Arkell R. Larder R. Soares M. Bonaldo M. Smith L. Tymowska-Lalanne Z. Wells C. Greenfield A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1553-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Whole mount in situ hybridization of XY embryonic gonads has shown that Vanin-1 is expressed immediately following Sry expression, just before the formation of the testis cords. Vanin-1 is a member of a protein family of consisting of at least three members in humans (Vanin-1, -2, and -3) and two members in mice (Vanin-1 and -3) (15Martin F. Malergue F. Pitari G.

The Vanin-1 gene product is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked membrane-associated pantetheinase, a family of enzymes that catalyzes the hydrolysis of pantetheine into pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) and cysteamine, an anti-oxidant (16Maras B.

Garrido-Urbani S. Millet V. Imbert J. Dupre S. Pitari G. Naquet P. Galland F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7214-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), further suggesting that Vanin-1 is likely to play an important role in tissue response to stress and inflammation. To identify proteins involved in regulating expression from the Vanin-1 promoter in the developing testis, immunofluorescence studies were carried out on cryosectioned embryonic testes. Vanin-1 is expressed by cells that are positive for SF-1 and is strongly expressed in Sertoli cells that express both SOX9 and SF-1. The proximal Vanin-1 promoter was isolated and found to contain putative binding sites for both SF-1 and SOX9. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and cell transfection assays showed that SF-1 and SOX9 synergistically activate transcription from this promoter. PCR and Plasmid Constructions—The oligonucleotide primers 5′-GATTCCTGTCATAACCTC-3′ and 5′-CATGCTGAAGTCCAAAGA-3′ were used to amplify the Vanin-1 promoter fragment (267 bp) from mouse genomic DNA by PCR. The resulting fragment was cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega), sequenced, and then subcloned into pGL2-Basic (Promega) using the KpnI and SacI restrictions sites. Expression constructs for SOX9, SOX8, and SF-1 and GST fusion constructs were reported previously (11Schepers G. Wilson M. Wilhelm D. Koopman P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28101-28108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The open reading frame of Sry was amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotide pair 5′-GCGGGATCCATGGAGGGCCATGTCAAG-3′ and 5′-GCGGTCGACCTATGAGACTGCCAACCACA-3′ and cloned into pGEM-T easy. A BamHI and NotI restriction fragment from the resulting plasmid was then subcloned into the pGEX4T-3 expression vector (Amersham Biosciences) in-frame with the GST coding region and confirmed by DNA sequencing. pcDNA3-SOX9ΔTA was generated to lack the last 60 amino acids of SOX9, which includes the activation domain (21Ng L.-J. Wheatley S. Muscat G.E.O. Conway-Campbell J. Bowles J. Wright E. Bell D.M. Tam P.P.L. Cheah K.S.E. Koopman P. Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 108-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced into the wild-type promoter using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sequence of the top strand oligonucleotides used to generate each mutation was as follows, with the mutated nucleotides in bold, SF-M1 5′-CTGACCAGAAACTAGGGATATTCTGAAACTGTTG-3′, SF-M2 5′-TTTTTTGAAGCTACCCAGATCTGGGAACCACGTG-3′, and MutSOX 5′-CGATAAGTAACCTCTAGTCCTGTCTGCATTCCTG-3′. The presence of introduced mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—EMSA analysis was performed as described previously (11Schepers G. Wilson M. Wilhelm D. Koopman P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28101-28108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Briefly, KpnI-SacI restriction fragments from pGL2-Vnn expression constructs were purified using the Qiagen Gel Purification Kit. Following dephosphorylation using alkaline phosphatase, fragments were end-labeled with 32γ-ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Probes were purified on a Nick Purification Column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted in TE buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8). DNase I Footprinting—The procedure for DNase I footprinting has been described previously (22Wilhelm D. Englert C. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1839-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The Vanin-1 promoter fragment was labeled on either strand by PCR by using one 32P end-labeled oligonucleotide primer (for the strand to be labeled) along with the non-labeled primer. Footprinting reactions were electrophoresed in parallel with sequencing reactions to determine the sequence of the protected site. Sequencing reactions were performed using the Thermo Sequenase radiolabeled terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences) using the oligonucleotide that was labeled in the PCR. Luciferase Assays—TM3 cells (23Mather J.P. Biol. Reprod. 1980; 23: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) were plated in 12-well plates and transfected with 500 ng of luciferase reporter plasmid with either empty expression vector (pcDNA3) or SF-1 (50 or 20 ng) and/or SOX9 (20 ng) expression plasmids using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS and assayed for luciferase activity with the Luciferase Reporter Gene assay kit (Roche Applied Science). Each transfection was done in duplicate and repeated independently at least three times; data represent the average -fold increase relative to cells co-transfected with empty expression vector (pcDNA3). Immunofluorescence—Antibody staining was performed on cryosectioned embryonic tissue with the following antibodies. Vanin-1 antibody (1:100 dilution) was purified from the rat hybridoma clone H202-407-6-3 as described previously (24Aurrand-Lions M. Galland F. Bazin H. Zakharyev V. Imhof B.A. Naquet P. Immunity. 1996; 5: 391-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-SF-1 antibody (1:1000 dilution) was a kind gift from K. Morohashi (National Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki, Japan). Goat anti-AMH antibody (sc-6886) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and used as a 1:100 dilution. Rabbit anti-SOX9 antibody has been described previously (25Kent J. Wheatley S.C. Andrews J.E. Sinclair A.H. Koopman P. Development. 1996; 122: 2813-2822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies (anti-rat Alexa 488, anti-rabbit Alexa 594, and anti-goat Alexa 594) were purchased from Molecular Probes and used at a 1:200 dilution. Tissue samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h, washed with PBS, and then incubated overnight in PBS containing 30% sucrose. Samples were then frozen in OCT cryo-embedding compound and sectioned at a 10-μm thickness. Slides were washed three times with PBTx (PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100) and blocked with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum. Slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody diluted in blocking solution as indicated above. After three washes with PBTx, slides were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody, washed, mounted, and imaged using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 MP confocal microscope. Gonad-specific SF-1 null mice were bred and genotyped as described previously (26Jeyasuria P. Ikeda Y. Jamin S.P. Zhao L. de Rooij D.G. Themmen A.P.N. Behringer R.R. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Embryos were isolated and prepared as described above for sectioning. SF-1 and SOX9 Are Co-expressed with Vanin-1 in Vivo— Previously it has been shown by in situ hybridization on whole gonads that Vanin-1 mRNA is expressed predominantly in Sertoli cells of the testis cords of mouse XY fetal gonads at 13.5 dpc (13Bowles J. Bullejos M. Koopman P. Genesis. 2000; 27: 124-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Grimmond S. Van Hateren N. Siggers P. Arkell R. Larder R. Soares M. Bonaldo M. Smith L. Tymowska-Lalanne Z. Wells C. Greenfield A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1553-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the present study, immunofluorescence was carried out to further characterize the expression of Vanin-1 in the embryonic testis in terms of cell type and possible coexpression with transcription factors present in the Sertoli cells, SOX9 and SF-1 in vivo. Mouse fetal testes at 13.5 and 16.5 dpc were sectioned and stained with an antibody specific for Vanin-1 (24Aurrand-Lions M. Galland F. Bazin H. Zakharyev V. Imhof B.A. Naquet P. Immunity. 1996; 5: 391-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), together with anti-SF-1, -SOX9, or -AMH antibodies (Fig. 1). Vanin-1 was found to be strongly expressed in the cytoplasm of Sertoli cells at these stages, as evidenced by colocalization with AMH (Fig. 1A) and SOX9 (Fig. 1C). Some staining was also observed in interstitial cells located between the cords. These interstitial cells were identified as Leydig cells by positive staining for SF-1 (6Hatano O. Takayama K. Imai T. Waterman M.R. Takakusu A. Omura T. Morohashi K. Development. 1994; 120: 2787-2797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). These results show that Vanin-1 protein is expressed in Leydig cells as well as Sertoli cells. SF-1 is known to be expressed strongly in the adrenal cortex at 13.5 dpc (7Ikeda Y. Shen W.H. Ingraham H.A. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Vanin-1 staining was found on the surface of SF-1-positive cells within the adrenal cortex (Fig. 2). Antibody staining was weaker compared with the Vanin-1 staining found in the testis cords (Fig. 2). Together these results indicate that cells positive for SF-1 also express Vanin-1 and that there may be stronger expression of Vanin-1 in cells that also express SOX9 in vivo, consistent with the possibility that SOX9 and SF-1 may together be involved in the regulation of Vanin-1 transcription. SF-1 and SOX9 Can Bind to the Vanin-1 Proximal Promoter— To investigate whether SF-1 and SOX9 can activate transcription from the proximal promoter of Vanin-1, a 267-bp fragment of the promoter was cloned by PCR using mouse genomic DNA. A sequence analysis revealed two potential SF-1 binding sites based on the consensus binding sequence previously determined for SF-1 (27Morohashi K. Honda S. Inomata Y. Handa H. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17913-17919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). To test whether SF-1 is able to bind to this promoter fragment, we performed EMSA using a GST·SF-1 fusion protein. The Vanin-1 promoter probe formed DNA·protein complexes with GST·SF-1, but not with GST alone (Fig. 3B, arrowheads), confirming the presence of SF-1 binding sites within this promoter fragment. To test for binding specificity, each site was mutated and tested by EMSA for the ability to bind GST·SF-1. A mutation of either site individually produced a minor reduction of SF-1·DNA complex formation, but when both sites were mutated in the same fragment the formation of a specific SF-1·DNA complex was abolished (Fig. 3B). Because SF-1 and SOX9 cooperatively act to up-regulate Amh promoter expression, and in view of our observations that Vanin-1 expression is stronger in the testis cords where SOX9 is expressed compared with Leydig cells or the adrenal where SOX9 is not expressed (Fig. 2), the ability of SOX9 to bind to the Vanin-1 promoter was investigated. Purified GST·SOX9 fusion protein was able to bind to the isolated promoter fragment in EMSA (Fig. 3C) confirming the presence of a SOX site(s) within the promoter. In addition to SOX9, Sertoli cells also express SRY (28Albrecht K. Eicher E. Dev. Biol. 2001; 240: 92-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and SOX8, a protein that shares 53% identity with SOX9 (11Schepers G. Wilson M. Wilhelm D. Koopman P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28101-28108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). As with SOX9, SOX8 has also been shown to cooperate with SF-1 to activate transcription from the Amh promoter (11Schepers G. Wilson M. Wilhelm D. Koopman P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28101-28108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), although SOX8 is not crucial for testis formation because Sox8 null mice develop normally (29Sock E. Schmidt K. Hermanns-Borgmeyer I. Bo ̈sl M. Wegner M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6951-6959Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Analysis of Sox9/Sox8 double mutant mice revealed that SOX8 complements SOX9 function during testis differentiation (30Chaboissier M.C. Kobayashi A. Vidal V.I. Lutzkendorf S. van de Kant H.J. Wegner M. de Rooij D.G. Behringer R.R. Schedl A. Development. 2004; 131: 1891-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Because all SOX proteins, including SRY, share the same consensus binding sequence (31Mertin S. McDowall S.G. Harley V.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), we next tested whether SRY and SOX8 could bind to the Vanin-1 promoter fragment. Interestingly, GST·SOX8 was able to bind to the DNA fragment; however GST·SRY failed to form a specific DNA·protein complex (Fig. 3C). To locate the putative SOX factor binding site(s) within the Vanin-1 proximal promoter fragment, DNase I footprinting analysis was carried out (Fig. 4A). The Vanin-1 promoter was labeled on one strand and incubated with either GST or GST·SOX9 fusion protein. The inclusion of purified GST·SOX9 protein resulted in a protection of bases -206 to -173 (Fig. 4A) from DNase I digestion. This protected region of 34 bases is of a similar size to that protected in a footprinting analysis carried out on the Amh promoter (10de Santa Barbara P. Bonneaud N. Boizet B. Desclozeaux M. Moniot B. Su ̈dbeck P. Scherer G. Poulat F. Berta P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6653-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). To confirm this was the SOX site bound by SOX9, we next used site-directed mutagenesis to induce mutations into this putative SOX binding site and tested by EMSA. A mutation of this site prevented both SOX9 and SOX8 from binding to the promoter fragment (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the correct binding site for these proteins had been identified. SF-1 and SOX9 Co-activate Transcription from the Vanin-1 Proximal Promoter—To determine whether the sites for SF-1 and SOX9 that we identified are functional in regulating Vanin-1 expression, the proximal promoter was cloned immediately upstream of the luciferase gene in the pGL2-Basic reporter construct (pGL2-Vnn). TM3 cells, derived from mouse fetal gonads (23Mather J.P. Biol. Reprod. 1980; 23: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) and retaining expression of a number of genes of the sex-determining pathway (32Beverdam A. Wilhelm D. Koopman P. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2003; 101: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), were co-transfected with pGL2-Vnn without or with an SF-1 expression plasmid (pcDNA3-SF-1) and were assayed for luciferase activity after 48 h. Co-transfection with 20 ng of pcDNA3-SF-1 resulted in a 22-fold increase in luciferase activity compared with the empty pcDNA3 vector (Fig. 5A). This response was dose-dependent, as a transfection of 50 ng further increased the promoter activity 35-fold above basal activity. To investigate possible synergy between SF-1 and SOX9 in activating Vanin-1 transcription, TM3 cells were co-transfected with the pGL2-Vnn reporter plasmid without or together with pcDNA3-SOX9 and/or pcDNA3-SF-1 expression plasmids. No activation was found in cells transfected with pcDNA3-SOX9 alone (Fig. 5A). However, co-transfection of pcDNA3-SOX9 and pcDNA3-SF-1 resulted in a doubling in the relative levels of luciferase produced compared with pcDNA3-SF-1 alone (Fig. 5A). These results demonstrated that SOX9 required the presence of SF-1 to activate transcription and that it can act synergistically with SF-1 to mediate expression from the Vanin-1 promoter. Our EMSA experiments showed that also SOX8, but not SRY, is able to bind the Vanin-1 promoter. Expression constructs pcDNA3-SOX8 and pcDNA3-SRY were assayed to determine whether these SOX factors could stimulate activity from the Vanin-1 promoter in reporter assays. Cells transfected with pcDNA3-SOX8 showed an increase in luciferase activity compared with cells transfected with pcDNA3-SF-1 alone (Fig. 5A). This suggests that SOX8 can, like SOX9, bind to and activate transcription from the Vanin-1 promoter in combination with SF-1. pcDNA3-SRY failed to activate the transcription of pGL2-Vnn either alone or in combination with pcDNA3-SF-1. This situation is similar to that reported for the Amh promoter where SRY was also unable to activate transcription, indicating that it cannot substitute for SOX9 in vitro (10de Santa Barbara P. Bonneaud N. Boizet B. Desclozeaux M. Moniot B. Su ̈dbeck P. Scherer G. Poulat F. Berta P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6653-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) even though it can bind directly to SF-1. 2M. Wilson, unpublished data. SOX transcription factors bind to DNA via their HMG domains, resulting in bending of the DNA by up to 71°, and has been proposed to act as an architectural transcription factor (33Preiss S. Argentaro A. Clayton A. John A. Jans D. Ogata T. Nagai T. Barroso I. Schafer A. Harley V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27864-27872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 34Harley V.R. Clarkson M.J. Argentaro A. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 466-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To determine whether SOX9 synergizes with SF-1 to activate the Vanin-1 promoter through DNA bending or in a more conventional manner through its trans-activation domain, TM3 cells were co-transfected with an expression construct, pcDNA3-SOX9ΔTA, encoding a SOX9 mutant protein that lacks the C-terminal trans-activation domain but can still bind to DNA. In luciferase assays this construct failed to activate transcription from the Vanin-1 promoter over levels seen with SF-1 alone (Fig. 5A). Thus, promoter regulation depended on the SOX9 trans-activation domain. To confirm that the binding site(s) responsible for activation by SF-1 and SOX9 had been identified, reporter constructs containing mutations in SF-1 site 1 (SF-M1), site 2 (SF-M2), or both (SF-M1M2), or in the SOX site (MutSox) were co-transfected with pcDNA3-SF-1. Mutation of either SF-1 site reduced SF-1-dependent activation from the Vanin-1 promoter to ∼28% of wild-type promoter expression levels. Mutation of both SF-1 sites completely abolished promoter activity (Fig. 5B). This indicates that both binding sites are required for transcriptional activation by SF-1. Previous analysis of the Amh promoter, which also contains two SF-1 DNA binding sites, found that mutation of either site greatly reduced promoter activity demonstrating also that both sites were required for full promoter activation by SF-1 (35Watanabe K. Clarke T. Lane A. Wang X. Donahoe P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1624-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of pcDNA3-SOX9 and pcDNA3-SF-1 with the Vnn1 promoter-reporter construct containing the mutated SOX site (MutSox) identified by DNase I footprinting produced luciferase levels similar to pcDNA3-SF-1 transfection alone (Fig. 5B). Thus the putative SOX binding site identified in this study is essential for activation of transcription from the Vanin-1 promoter by SOX9. Disruption of SF-1 Function Leads to Loss of Expression of Vanin-1 in Vivo—Recently, targeted excision of the SF-1 gene in fetal Leydig cells in vivo has been reported, mediated by Cre-recombinase expression under the control of the AmhR2 promoter (26Jeyasuria P. Ikeda Y. Jamin S.P. Zhao L. de Rooij D.G. Themmen A.P.N. Behringer R.R. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The developing SF-1-null testes are smaller in size, show delayed cord formation, and lack expression of cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme and StAR, indicating that these genes are in vivo targets of SF-1. We analyzed 14.5-dpc testes from knock-out and wild-type litterma"
https://openalex.org/W2048026169,"Bak is generally recognized as a multidomain, pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. Bak and Bax are functionally redundant in non-neuronal cells and represent a mitochondrial convergence point for cell death signaling pathways. This functional redundancy, however, may not exist in neurons in which the single deletion of Bax is sufficient to confer protection against a variety of cytotoxic insults. In the present study, we demonstrate that postnatal cortical and cerebellar granule neurons exclusively express an alternatively spliced, BH3 domain-only form of Bak (N-Bak), whereas astrocytes express only the full-length, multidomain form. Overexpression of N-Bak promotes Bax translocation in HeLa cells and induces neuronal cell death in cortical, hippocampal, and cerebellar granule neurons in a Bax-dependent manner. N-Bak interacts with Bcl-X<sub>L</sub> but not BAX, suggesting an indirect mechanism for promoting Bax translocation to the mitochondria. N-Bak message and protein levels are elevated in cortical neurons in response to DNA damage, and subsequent induction of neuronal death is significantly delayed by expressing a full-length Bak antisense plasmid. These results demonstrate that postnatal neurons solely express a BH3 domain-only form of Bak, which contributes to DNA damage-induced neuronal apoptosis. The absence of full-length Bak expression explains the near exclusive requirement for Bax in neuronal apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2083231946,"XPG has structural and catalytic roles in nucleotide excision repair (NER) and belongs to the FEN-1 family of structure-specific nucleases. XPG contains a stretch of over 600 amino acids termed the “spacer region” between the conserved N- and I-nuclease regions. Its role is unknown, and it is not similar to any known protein. To investigate its possible functions, we generated and analyzed several deletion mutants of XPG. The spacer region is not required for endonuclease activity, but amino acids 111–550 contribute to the substrate specificity of XPG, and they are required for interaction with TFIIH and for NER activity in vitro and in vivo. Deletion of residues 184–210 and 554–730 leads only to a partial defect in NER activity and a weakened interaction with TFIIH. XPGΔ184–210 and XPGΔ554–730 are not observed at sites of local UV damage in living cells by immunofluorescence, suggesting that the weakened interaction between XPG and TFIIH results in an NER reaction with altered kinetics. This study demonstrates that the N-terminal portion of the spacer region is particularly important for NER progression by mediating the XPG-TFIIH interaction and XPG substrate specificity.

Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington D. C.1995Google Scholar, 2Hoeijmakers J.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (3163) Google Scholar). The hallmark of good NER substrates is that they induce significant helical distortion in addition to a chemical change in the DNA structure (3Hess M.T. Schwitter U. Petretta M. Giese B. Naegeli H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6664-6669Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 4Scha ̈rer O.D. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003; 42: 2946-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Versatility as well as specificity in NER are achieved through sequential and highly coordinated action of the various factors involved. The importance of NER is illustrated by the dramatic consequences of a defect in many of the approximately 30 genes involved, resulting in the three disorders xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne syndrome (CS), and trichothiodystrophy (5Bootsma D.

Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Among these, XP represents a classical repair syndrome that is characterized by extreme UV sensitivity and a high incidence of skin cancer associated with sunlight exposure. After initial damage recognition in NER, the helix is opened around the lesion, the damaged strand is incised on both sides of the lesion and released as a 24–32-nucleotide-long oligonucleotide, and the resulting gap is then filled in by repair synthesis (7de Laat W.L. Jaspers N.G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 768-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). A subpathway of NER preferentially removes damage from the transcribed strand of active genes. This transcription-coupled repair process remains poorly understood but is thought to be initiated by a stalled transcribing RNA polymerase at the lesion (8Svejstrup J.Q. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In contrast, the initial damage recognition and incision steps of NER in bulk DNA, sometimes referred to as global genome repair, are understood in some detail. This process has been reconstituted in vitro using the six repair factors XPC-HR23B, XPA, RPA, TFIIH, XPG, and ERCC1-XPF (9Aboussekhra A. Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K. Vilpo J.A. Moncollin V.

XPC-HR23B appears to be the initial sensor of helix-distorting lesions and is essential for the sequential assembly of all subsequent NER factors (12Sugasawa K. Ng J.M. Masutani C.

Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2281-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Subsequently, XPA, RPA, and XPG join the complex, leading to the formation of a fully opened and stable pre-incision complex (16Evans E. Moggs J.G. Hwang J.R. Egly J.M. Wood R.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6559-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 17Mu D. Wakasugi M. Hsu D.S. Sancar A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 19074-19083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). XPA, RPA, and XPG are recruited independently of each other to sites of UV damage, and addition of ERCC1-XPF to the complex requires XPA but not XPG (13Volker M. Mone M.J. Karmakar P. van Hoffen A.

However, the presence of XPG without XPA and RPA is apparently insufficient to allow the 3′ incision. Likewise, the physical presence of XPG is required for the 5′ incision activity of ERCC1-XPF (20Wakasugi M. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16030-16034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 21Constantinou A. Gunz D. Evans E. Lalle P. Bates P.A. Wood R.D. Clarkson S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5637-5648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), indicating that although the two endonucleases are recruited to pre-incision complexes independently of each other, the proper assembly of all the factors is required for dual incision around the lesion and progression through the NER pathway. We have had a long standing interest in elucidating the roles of the XPG protein in NER and other processes (22Clarkson S.G. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 1113-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The nuclease function of XPG is required for both NER and transcription-coupled NER, and XPG has an additional nuclease-independent function in the assembly of NER pre-incision complexes. Structural roles of XPG are also important for additional functions outside of the NER, most likely transcription (23Lee S.K. Yu S.L. Prakash L. Prakash S. Cell. 2002; 109: 823-834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and the repair of oxidative damage (24Klungland A. Hoss M. Gunz D. Constantinou A. Clarkson S.G.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 979-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). XPG belongs to the FEN-1 family of structure-specific nucleases, whose members share two highly conserved nuclease motifs called N- and I-regions (26Lieber M.R. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). In FEN-1 and most other family members, the N- and I-regions are separated by only about 70 amino acids, which form a flexible helical loop in the proteins with known structures (27Ceska T.A. Sayers J.R. Stier G. Suck D. Nature. 1996; 382: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 28Mueser T.C. Nossal N.G. Hyde C.C.

Cell. 1998; 95: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In contrast, the N- and I-regions in XPG are separated by a stretch of over 600 amino acids that was designated “spacer region” (31Scherly D. Nouspikel T. Corlet J. Ucla C. Bairoch A. Clarkson S.G. Nature. 1993; 363: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This region does not contain any known structural motifs, but it has been speculated that it has a role in mediating interactions with proteins involved in NER and other processes. TFIIH appears to be the key interacting partner for XPG in NER, and it needs to be present at damage sites for the subsequent recruitment of XPG (13Volker M. Mone M.J. Karmakar P. van Hoffen A. Schul W. Vermeulen W. Hoeijmakers J.H. van Driel R. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 213-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 32Riedl T. Hanaoka F. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5293-5303Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The interaction between XPG and TFIIH is sufficiently strong that the two proteins co-purify from cell extracts over several chromatographic steps (10Mu D. Park C.H. Matsunaga T. Hsu D.S. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2415-2418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). They can also be co-immunoprecipitated and then used in NER reactions missing these two components (15Araujo S.J. Nigg E.A. Wood R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2281-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Pull-down assays using in vitro translated proteins have shown that XPG fragments, including parts of the spacer region, interact with the XPB, XPD, p62, and p44 subunits of TFIIH (33Iyer N. Reagan M.S. Wu K.J. Canagarajah B. Friedberg E.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2157-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The interacting domains have not yet been precisely localized, but 7 amino acids near the N terminus of the spacer region are known to be important for the TFIIH interaction (34Thorel F. Constantinou A. Dunand-Sauthier I. Nouspikel T. Lalle P. Raams A. Jaspers N.G. Vermeulen W. Shivji M.K. Wood R.D. Clarkson S.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10670-10680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Additionally, an RPA-XPG interaction has been mapped to the spacer region by using in vitro translated proteins, but the functional significance of this reported interaction is not yet clear (35He Z. Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. Ingles C.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In addition to mediating protein-protein interactions, the spacer region may also contribute to the substrate specificity of XPG. FEN-1 and XPG show distinct but overlapping substrate specificities in vitro, cleaving various DNA substrates with single-strand (ss)/double-strand (ds) DNA junctions adjacent to the 5′ ssDNA overhang. Whereas FEN-1 and other members of this nuclease family need a single-stranded 5′ end for activity (36Robins P. Pappin D.J. Wood R.D. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28535-28538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 38Murante R.S. Rust L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30377-30383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), XPG efficiently processes bubble substrates, which have no free 5′ ends (39O'Donovan A. Davies A.A. Moggs J.G. West S.C. Wood R.D. Nature. 1994; 371: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 40Evans E. Fellows J. Coffer A. Wood R.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Given the involvement of XPG and FEN-1 in different repair and replication pathways, it is possible that the XPG-specific spacer region may be a determinant for the unique substrate specificity of XPG. These observations suggest that the spacer region of XPG has an important role in NER by mediating association with other NER factors and by contributing to the substrate specificity of XPG. Here we tested these hypotheses by generating mutants of XPG with deletions in the spacer region and by analyzing their properties at the biochemical and cell biological levels. Our studies reveal that the spacer region of XPG is dispensable for endonuclease activity but is required for efficient bubble cleavage activity, interaction with TFIIH and NER activity. We discuss these results in the context of how XPG contributes to the progression through the NER incision reaction as a modular protein. Construction of XPG Spacer Deletion Mutants—Deletion mutants were generated by digestion of pFastBac1-XPG (41Hohl M. Thorel F. Clarkson S.G. Scha ̈rer O.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19500-19508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) with HindIII and NdeI (Δ111–550), with NdeI and AseI (Δ554–730), or with HindIII and AseI (Δ111–730), and the resulting pFastBac1-XPG fragments were ligated with a double-stranded adaptor DNA having corresponding sticky ends. The adaptors were made by annealing two oligonucleotides, 5′-AGCTTCTGCCA and 5′-TATGGCAGA for HindIII-NdeI, 5′-TATGAGAT and 5′-TAATCTCA for NdeI-AseI or 5′-AGCTTCTGAT, and 5′-TAATCAGA for HindIII-AseI. The XPGΔ184–210 deletion construct was performed by fusion PCR (42Amberg D.C. Botstein D. Beasley E.M. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1275-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) using the following primers: the external primers (A) 5′-GCAGAGAAAGGACTTAGCG and (B) 5′-CGAATTTACTCTCATATGGGC, and the internal primers surrounding the Δ184–210 region (C) 5′-TCATAATCCTTTCACCAAGCGCAGAAGAAC and (D) 5′-GCTTGGTGAAAGGATTATGAAAGAACTCTTCC. Two separate PCRs were performed on the plasmid pFastBac1-XPG using the external primer A and the internal primer D, and the external primer B and the internal primer C, respectively, according to published procedures. Both PCR products were mixed, and a further PCR using the external primers A and B was performed. This latter PCR results in the deletion of the fragment 184–210 in the XPG cDNA. This construct was cloned in the pFastBac1 vector by digestion with HindIII and NdeI. For transduction of XP-G/CS fibroblasts, each XPG cDNA construct in the pFastBac1 vector was cloned into the pLOX/EWgfp lentiviral vector by replacing the GFP cDNA. XPG Protein Expression and Purification—XPG wild-type and mutant proteins were expressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified as described previously (41Hohl M. Thorel F. Clarkson S.G. Scha ̈rer O.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19500-19508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Expression levels of XPGΔ554–730, XPGΔ111–550, and XPGΔ111–730 were significantly higher than those of wild-type XPG and XPGΔ184–210 proteins. The different mutant XPG proteins eluted at different salt concentrations from the ion-exchange columns. Wild-type XPG eluted from the Hitrap S column between 400 and 600 mm NaCl, XPGΔ184–210 and XPGΔ111–550 between 500 and 650 mm NaCl, and XPGΔ554–730 and XPGΔ111–730 between 600 and 850 mm NaCl. From the HitrapQ column, the wild-type XPG, XPGΔ184–210, and XPGΔ111–550 proteins eluted between 450 and 600 mm NaCl, XPGΔ554–730 between 300 and 400 mm NaCl, and only a fraction of XPGΔ111–730 bound to the column and eluted between 150 and 300 mm NaCl. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford protein assay with BSA as a standard. Typically 0.2–0.5 mg of wild-type, XPGΔ184–210, and XPGΔ111–730 and 0.5–3 mg of XPGΔ554–730 and XPGΔ111–550 were obtained at concentrations of 0.2–0.6 mg/ml. DNA Binding and Cleavage Assays—Oligonucleotides described previously were used to create the splayed arm (substrate 1 with n = 20), the flap (substrate 3), and the bubble DNA substrate (Table I of Ref. 41Hohl M. Thorel F. Clarkson S.G. Scha ̈rer O.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19500-19508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). DNA cleavage and binding assays were performed as described previously. Cleavage assays were analyzed by denaturing PAGE and binding assays by native PAGE (41Hohl M. Thorel F. Clarkson S.G. Scha ̈rer O.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19500-19508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Each gel was quantified using a Typhoon 9400 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and ImageQuant version 5.2 software (Amersham Biosciences). In all studies, the amount of substrate and products were quantified, and the percentage of substrate cleavage was determined by the product/(substrate + product) ratio. This method allows for correction of any loading errors among lanes. All assays were performed at least in duplicate, and representative gels are shown. Cell Culture Conditions and Preparation of Whole Cell Extracts—For the generation of whole cell extracts, SV40-transformed fibroblast cells XPCS1RO (43Ellison A.R. Nouspikel T. Jaspers N.G. Clarkson S.G. Gruenert D.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 243: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) were cultured in modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. Cells were grown to near confluency, and whole cell extract was prepared accordingly to a published procedure (44Biggerstaff M. Wood R.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 113: 357-372PubMed Google Scholar). For the transduction experiments, primary fibroblasts from a severely affected XP-G/CS patient (XP20BE) (45Moriwaki S. Stefanini M. Lehmann A.R. Hoeijmakers J.H. Robbins J.H. Rapin I. Botta E.

Cells were kept in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. For transduction experiments, 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and kept in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. In Vitro NER Assay—A site-specifically aminoacetylfluorene (AAF)-modified 24-mer oligonucleotide (sequence, 5′-GTATCGATAAGAAFCTTGATATCGAAT) was obtained by incorporating a protected dG-AAF phosphoramidite (47Gillet L.C. Scha ̈rer O.D. Org. Lett. 2002; 4: 4205-4208Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) through a modified “ultra-mild” solid support DNA synthesis, 2L. C. J. Gillet and O. D. Schärer, manuscript in preparation. used in primer extension reaction with ssDNA of pBluescript as a template, and purified as described previously (48Moggs J.G. Yarema K.J. Essigmann J.M. Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7177-7186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). 50 ng of pBluescript containing a single site-specific AAF adduct was incubated in a reaction volume of 10 μl with 50 μg of cell-free extract prepared from XPCS1RO fibroblast cells in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 70 mm KCl, 7% glycerol, 1.3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm EDTA, 0.4 mg/ml BSA, and 2 mm ATP. An ATP-regenerating system was included, consisting of 22 mm phosphocreatine (di-Tris salt, Sigma) and 50 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase (rabbit muscle, Sigma). Complementation was assayed upon addition of 150 or 750 nm XPG wild-type or mutant protein. After incubation for 45 min at 30 °C, 50 nm of an oligonucleotide complementary to the excision product with a G4 3′ overhang (5′-GGGGGATATCAAGCTTATCGATACCGTCGACCTCG) was added, followed by heat inactivation at 95 °C for 5 min. After cooling down the reactions for 15 min at room temperature, 1 μl of a Sequenase enzyme/[α-32P]dCTP mixture was added to the tubes, such that each reaction contained 0.5 units of Sequenase and 2.5 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (dilution in Sequenase dilution buffer; Amersham Biosciences). Reactions were incubated for 3 min at 37 °C, prior to addition of 1.2 μl of dNTP mixture (100 μm each of dATP, dGTP, and dTTP; and 50 μm dCTP) and incubated for another 12 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by addition of 8 μl of formamide loading dye, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and placed on ice. Reactions were loaded on a 14% sequencing gel and run in 1× TBE at 60 watts. The MspI-digested pBR322 fragments were used as size markers after end-labeling with [α-32P]dCTP and Klenow enzyme (New England Biolabs). The gels were exposed on phosphor screens and scanned on the PhosphorImager. Cell Transduction with Lentiviral Recombinants—Recombinant lentiviruses containing the various XPG cDNAs under the control of the EF1α promoter were produced by co-transfecting 293T cells with the following three plasmids: the packaging plasmid R8.91, the vesicular stomatitis virus-G envelope-protein expression plasmid pMDG, and the pLOX/EW lentiviral vector containing the different XPG cDNAs (49Salmon P. Kindler V. Ducrey O. Chapuis B. Zubler R.H. Trono D. Blood. 2000; 96: 3392-3398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A plasmid containing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNA was used as negative control. Details of the lentiviral vectors and protocols are described on the following website: www.tronolab.unige.ch. Briefly, the culture medium containing the lentiviral XPG recombinants was harvested and filtered through a 0.45-μm polyether sulfone membrane (Millipore). Infection was carried out by adding the viral particles containing the different recombinants to XP-G/CS primary fibroblasts (XP20BE) at 50% confluency. Fibroblasts were then cultured normally for various times, and transduction efficiency was assessed by XPG immunofluorescence. UV Irradiation and Survival Assay—Cells were seeded on dishes and cultured overnight prior to UV irradiation. Irradiation was performed using a TUV 6-watt lamp (UVGL-58, Omnilab), and the UVC dose rate was measured by using a UV radiometer (UVX-25, Omnilab). 50–60% confluent fibroblasts were irradiated with increasing doses of UVC, and cell viability was assessed 72 h post-irradiation using the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The number of proliferating cells was measured by recording the absorbance at 490 nm with a 96-well plate reader (Bio-Rad). Viability assays were performed independently four times using two independent sets of transduced cells. Local UV Irradiation and Immunofluorescence—Fibroblasts were seeded on glass coverslips and cultured overnight prior to UV irradiation. Cells were either non-irradiated or irradiated with 150 J/m2 through 8-μm polycarbonate isopore membrane filters (Millipore). Cells on four coverslips were irradiated under the same filter, and two coverslips were incubated in their original medium and fixed 30 min post-irradiation, and the remaining two coverslips were fixed at 24 h post-UV. Cells were fixed and permeabilized with 3% formaldehyde, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. The saturation step was performed in 1× PBS containing 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibodies, mouse monoclonal anti-XPG (clone 8H7) at 1/2000 dilution and rabbit polyclonal anti-p89 at 1/600, were added for 1 h at room temperature in 1× PBS containing 1% BSA. Detection of (6-4) photoproducts (6-4PPs) was performed by using the mouse monoclonal antibody 64M-2 against 6-4PPs (50Mori T. Nakane M. Hattori T. Matsunaga T. Ihara M. Nikaido O. Photochem. Photobiol. 1991; 54: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) as described (13Volker M. Mone M.J. Karmakar P. van Hoffen A. Schul W. Vermeulen W.

Cell. 2001; 8: 213-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), except that cells were treated with 0.7 m HCl instead of 2 m HCl. Detection was performed using the anti-mouse IgG (H + L) Alexa™ 488 conjugate (Molecular Probes) and the anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) Cy3™ conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at room temperature, both at 1/600 dilution. Nuclear staining was performed during the incubation of the secondary antibody using 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining (Molecular Probes) at 1/300 dilution. Stained cells were observed in a Zeiss Axiocam microscope using the Axiovision software. Transduced cells were analyzed for the presence or absence of UV-induced foci, and untransduced cells were used as negative controls. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—XP20BE cells were transduced with lentivectors containing cDNAs encoding wild-type XPG or XPG spacer mutants. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (34Thorel F. Constantinou A. Dunand-Sauthier I. Nouspikel T. Lalle P. Raams A. Jaspers N.G. Vermeulen W. Shivji M.K. Wood R.D. Clarkson S.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10670-10680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells were lysed for 1 h on ice in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 1× complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Dynabeads PAN anti-mouse IgGs (Dynal) were pre-coupled to the 8H7 anti-XPG monoclonal antibody at a ratio of about 0.5 μg of antibody per 107 beads for 1 h at room temperature. Cell extracts were incubated with pre-coupled XPG-beads for 2 h at room temperature. Beads were collected using a magnetic particle concentrator (Dynal MPC) and were washed four times in lysis buffer containing 1× complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Beads were resuspended in 2× loading buffer and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described previously (34Thorel F.

Quantification of at least three independent experiments was performed using the Quantity One software, and a representative gel is shown. Construction and Purification of XPG Spacer Deletion Mutants—We constructed several deletion mutants in the spacer region between the N- and I-domains of XPG using appropriate available restriction enzyme sites, resulting in deletion of either the N-terminal (Δ111–550), C-terminal (Δ554–730), or both parts (Δ111–730) of the spacer. Residues within XPG region 1–337 have been shown to interact with TFIIH (33Iyer N. Reagan M.S. Wu K.J. Canagarajah B. Friedberg E.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2157-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This region contains the conserved nuclease N-domain and the N-terminal part of the spacer (Fig. 1A). Residues within the region 668–747 located in the C-terminal part of the spacer have been reported to contain an RPA interaction domain (Fig. 1A) (35He Z. Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. Ingles C.J.

https://openalex.org/W2017929504,"The group II truncated hemoglobin from Bacillus subtilis has been cloned, expressed, purified, and characterized. B. subtilis truncated hemoglobin is a monomeric protein endowed with an unusually high oxygen affinity (in the nanomolar range) such that the apparent thermodynamic binding constant for O2 exceeds that for CO by 1 order of magnitude. The kinetic 2basis of the high oxygen affinity resides mainly in the very slow rate of ligand release. The extremely stable ferrous oxygenated adduct is resistant to oxidation, which can be achieved only with oxidant in large excess, e.g. ferricyanide in 50-fold molar excess. The three-dimensional crystal structure of the cyano-Met derivative was determined at 2.15 Å resolution. Although the overall fold resembles that of other truncated hemoglobins, the distal heme pocket displays a unique array of hydrophilic side chains in the topological positions that dominate the steric interaction with iron-bound ligands. In fact, the Tyr-B10, Thr-E7, and Gln-E11 oxygens on one side of the heme pocket and the Trp-G8 indole NE1 nitrogen on the other form a novel pattern of the “ligand-inclusive hydrogen bond network” described for mycobacterial HbO. On the proximal side, the histidine residue is in an unstrained conformation, and the iron-His bond is unusually short (1.91 Å).

Although the overall fold resembles that of other truncated hemoglobins, the distal heme pocket displays a unique array of hydrophilic side chains in the topological positions that dominate the steric interaction with iron-bound ligands. In fact, the Tyr-B10, Thr-E7, and Gln-E11 oxygens on one side of the heme pocket and the Trp-G8 indole NE1 nitrogen on the other form a novel pattern of the “ligand-inclusive hydrogen bond network” described for mycobacterial HbO. On the proximal side, the histidine residue is in an unstrained conformation, and the iron-His bond is unusually short (1.91 Å). Truncated hemoglobins (trHbs) 1The abbreviations used are: trHbs, truncated hemoglobins; PDB, protein data bank; Bs-trHb, B. subtilis trHb. are present in a wide variety of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as in some plants and fungi (1Wittenberg J.B. Bolognesi M. Wittenberg B.A. Guertin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 871-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). TrHbs are 20–40 amino acids shorter than other globins, and the classical globin fold is not conserved as revealed by the crystal structures of the proteins from Chlamydomonas eugametus, Paramecium caudatum, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (2Pesce A. Couture M. Dewilde S. Guertin M. Yamauchi K. Ascenzi P. Moens L. Bolognesi M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2424-2434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Milani M. Pesce A. Ouellet Y. Ascenzi P. Guertin M.

A. 2003; 100: 5766-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In contrast to vertebrate and other nonvertebrate hemoglobins, in which most heme pocket residues are conserved, bacterial hemoglobins and trHbs in particular are characterized by a remarkable variability in the nature of these residues, especially in the distal side of the heme pocket (1Wittenberg J.B. Bolognesi M. Wittenberg B.A. Guertin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 871-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas the proximal F8 histidine is invariant and the B9-B10 pair is commonly phenylalanine-tyrosine, other residues lining the heme pocket are not conserved. A phylogenetic classification has suggested the partition of trHbs in three groups that share less than 30% sequence similarity with each other, and the sequence identity within the same group may be greater than 80% (1Wittenberg J.B. Bolognesi M. Wittenberg B.A. Guertin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 871-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The phylogenetic tree brings out distinct structural features of the active site that are characteristic of each group. In particular, group II and group III trHbs are characterized by the presence of a tryptophan residue at position G8, in the proximity of the heme group. Based on the crystal structure of M. tuberculosis HbO, the only available one for group II trHbs, such a large hydrophobic residue in the heme pocket is thought to hinder the escape of gaseous heme ligands and thereby contribute to the lower oxygen dissociation rate constants (around 10–3 s–1) observed in group II trHbs (5Watts R.A. Hunt P.W. Hvitved A.N. Hargrove M.S. Peacock W.J. Dennis E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10119-10124Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 6Ouellet H. Juszczak L. Dantsker D.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3897-3905Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). An additional contribution to the stabilization of heme ligands is provided by hydrogen bonding to Tyr-B10, a conserved residue in all trHbs. In some proteins carrying a polar residue at position E11, usually Gln, hydrogen bonding to the iron ligand may also involve this residue that is on the opposite side of the distal heme pocket relative to Tyr-B10. In HbO, even Tyr-CD1 has been shown to participate in ligand stabilization, thus contributing to the creation of an ensemble of polar residues in contact with the iron-bound ligand coordination shell that has been appropriately named a “ligand-inclusive hydrogen bond network” (6Ouellet H. Juszczak L. Dantsker D. Samuni U. Ouellet Y.H. Savard P.-Y. Wittenberg J.B. Wittenberg B.A. Friedman J.M. Guertin M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5764-5774Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The high oxygen affinity displayed by most trHbs renders their role as oxygen transporters unlikely (1Wittenberg J.B. Bolognesi M. Wittenberg B.A. Guertin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 871-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 6Ouellet H. Juszczak L. Dantsker D. Samuni U. Ouellet Y.H. Savard P.-Y. Wittenberg J.B. Wittenberg B.A. Friedman J.M. Guertin M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5764-5774Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Other functions have been proposed, e.g. trHbs have been presumed to be terminal oxidases (13Dikshit R.P. Dikshit K.L. Liu Y.X. Webster D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 293: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), to act as oxygen sensors (1Wittenberg J.B. Bolognesi M. Wittenberg B.A. Guertin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 871-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), or to be involved in the response to oxidative and nitrosative stress (7Couture M. Yeh S.R. Wittenberg B.A. Wittenberg J.B. Ouellet Y. Rousseau D.L. Guertin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11223-11228Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 15Ouellet H. Ouellet Y.

A. 2002; 99: 5902-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), but no final answer to this question has been given as yet. Some pathogenic bacteria, like Mycobacterium avium and M. tuberculosis, have more than one trHb belonging to different groups. In M. tuberculosis, group I HbN is expressed during the stationary phase and is thought to be involved in the defense against nitrosative stress, whereas no clear function has been attributed to group II HbO, which is expressed throughout the Mycobacterium growth phase (4Milani M. Savard P.-Y. Ouellet H. Ascenzi P. Guertin M. Bolognesi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5766-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Such distinctive features have been correlated with the necessity of pathogenic bacteria to outlive the adverse conditions encountered during the infectious cycle (12Mukai M. Savard P.Y. Ouellet H. Guertin M. Yeh S.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3897-3905Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 16Pathania R. Navani N.K. Rajamohan G. Dikshit K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15293-15302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and may hence pertain to other organisms. In any case, the large diffusion of trHbs also in bacteria with a severely reduced genome, like Mycobacterium leprae, is indicative of their importance for the survival of microorganisms. The genes encoding for truncated hemoglobins have been identified in all species of the Bacillus genus, including Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus halodurans, and Oceanobacillus ihyeiensis, as well as Bacillus subtilis. The proteins belong to group II trHbs, are closely related to each other (>60% sequence identity), and have the same heme pocket residues. Most interestingly, in all Bacillus species whose genomes have been sequenced, truncated hemoglobins coexist with true-type heme-containing chemotactic oxygen sensors and flavohemoglobins. However, in B. subtilis the globin-like sensor domain of the HemAT oxygen sensor as well as the flavohemoglobin heme domain share little sequence similarity with the trHb. Most importantly, structural alignments reveal that key residues within the heme pocket are not conserved, suggesting different functional roles for the three proteins (17Freitas T.A. Hou S. Dioum E.M. Saito J.A. Newhouse J. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Alam M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6675-6680Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In this framework, unveiling the structure and ligand binding properties of Bacillus trHbs represents a key step toward the understanding of the physiological role of these proteins. Tris, EDTA, NaCl, NaOH, HCl, and sodium dihydrogen phosphate were from Carlo Erba Reagenti (Rodano, Italy); the other reagents were from Sigma, unless specified otherwise. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant B. subtilis trHb—The amplification of the yjbI gene from B. subtilis genomic DNA was obtained through PCR. The primers 5′-GGA GTA GTC ACC ATG GGA CAA TC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCA GGA CAT AAA GGA TCC ACA AAC-3′ (reverse) were used. The DNA fragment was purified with the Qiagen GmbH (Hilden, Germany) kit, digested with restriction enzymes BamHI and NcoI (MBI Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania), and inserted into a pET28b(+) plasmid (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany). Competent Escherichia coli BL21DE3 cells were transformed with the ligation mixture, and the colonies with the correct DNA insert were selected through PCR screening. E. coli cells were grown overnight in Luria-Bertani medium containing 0.017 mm kanamycin, and 0.3 mm d-aminolevulinic acid (the heme precursor) and 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (the inductor) were added in the stationary phase. The cells were pelleted after 2–3 h, resuspended in a minimum volume of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.0 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and sonicated until the supernatant was reddish and clear. After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded on a DEAE-cellulose column (Whatman International Ltd., Maidstone, UK) equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and eluted with a NaCl step gradient (0–0.15 m). Further purification was obtained through gel filtration on a Sephadex G-75 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. The protein obtained was >98% pure on SDS-PAGE. Both the plasmid and the protein N-terminal sequences were determined and found to correspond to the expected ones. Sequence Analysis—The sequences were obtained from the NCBI protein sequence data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/). The sequence alignment of group II trHbs (B. subtilis, accession number GI:16078221; Arabidopsis thaliana, GI:14165163; and M. tuberculosis HbO, GI:15609607) and group I trHbs (M. tuberculosis HbN, GI:15608680; Synechocystis sp., GI:27065788; Chlamydomonas eugametos, GI:1707907; and Paramecium caudatum, GI:10835656), whose three-dimensional structures and/or functional properties have been determined (Fig. 1), was performed with ClustalW (18Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55767) Google Scholar) and refined, wherever possible, according to the structural alignment. The sequence of B. subtilis trHb (Bs-trHb) was used to search the NCBI nonredundant sequence data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) for sequence homologues using the programs PSI-BLAST (19Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar) and SAM-T02 (20Karplus K. Karchin R. Draper J. Casper J. Mandel-Gutfreund Y. Diekhans M. Hughey R. Proteins. 2003; 53: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). A multiple sequence alignment of the collected homologues was generated using ClustalW and refined according to the structural alignment shown in Fig. 1. The resulting multiple sequence alignment (data not shown) was used to investigate sequence variability at specific positions. Protein Crystallization and Data Collection—Attempts to crystallize the oxygenated derivative were unsuccessful. Crystallization of cyano-Met Bs-trHb, obtained by addition of 2-fold molar excess KCN to the oxidized protein, was achieved at 293 K by the hanging drop vapor-diffusion technique. A 2-μl volume of protein at 20 mg/ml (ϵ422 = 115 mm–1 cm–1 for the cyano-Met derivative) equilibrated versus 0.05 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.25, 2 mm KCN, was mixed with an equal amount of the reservoir solution containing (NH4)2SO4 in a range between 1.8 and 2.4 m, isopropyl alcohol at 5% v/v, and 2 mm KCN. Crystals grew in 2 weeks and were very small. A preliminary data set was collected at 2.5 Å resolution using the MAR CCD detector on the x-ray beamline BW7A at DESY (Hamburg, Germany) at a wavelength of 0.9236 Å. The deposited structure factors were calculated from a data set collected using the MAR CCD detector on the x-ray beamline XRD1 at ELETTRA, Basovizza (Trieste, Italy), at 2.15 Å resolution. The data were collected at 100 K using 26% glycerol as cryo-protectant. Intensities were integrated with DENZO and scaled with SCALEPACK (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The data analysis indicates that the crystal is tetragonal (P41212) with unit cell dimensions of a = 41.193, b = 41.193, and c = 134.537 Å; the asymmetric unit contains one molecule. The data scaling gave an Rmerge of 9.8% and a χ2 = 1.2. The data set is 98.5% complete at 2.15 Å resolution. Structure Solution and Refinement—The x-ray structure of Bs-trHb was solved by molecular replacement using the A subunit of M. tuberculosis HbO (Protein Data Bank entry 1NGK) as search probe. The rotational and translational searches, performed with the program MOLREP (22Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4153) Google Scholar) in the resolution range of 10–3.0 Å, produced a clear solution. Refinement of the atomic coordinates and displacement parameters have been carried out with the program REFMAC 5 (23Murshudov G.N. Lebedev A. Vagin A.A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Model building has been performed using the program package XTALVIEW (24McRee D.E. Practical Protein Crystallography. Academic Press, San Diego1993Google Scholar). The structure has been refined to an Rfactor of 20% and an Rfree of 26%. The final model includes 118 residues (6–123), 1 heme molecule, 77 water molecules, a cyanide anion, and 1 chlorine anion. The quality of the structure was assessed by the program PROCHECK (25Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The overall G-factor calculated as a measure of the quality of the model is 0.01. The Ramachandran plot contains 95% of the residues in the most favored region.

All experiments were conducted on a Beckman Optima XL-A ultracentrifuge equipped with an An60-Ti rotor at 20 °C in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The scans were taken at an appropriate wavelength (500, 540, or 580 nm) for different protein concentrations, in the range 50 μm to 1 mm. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at 50,000 rpm, at a spacing of 0.005 cm with three averages. Scans were taken every 5 min. The data were analyzed with Sedfit 8.3 (26Schuck P. Rossmanith P. Biopolymers. 2000; 54: 328-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and the sedimentation coefficient was reduced to s20,w by using standard procedures (27Laue T.M. Shah D.B. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S. Harding S.E. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar). Short column sedimentation equilibrium experiments were conducted at 30,000, 35,000, and 40,000 rpm. Scans were taken every 3 h at a spacing of 0.001 cm with 10 averages. Data were edited with WinReed and analyzed with NONLIN (Jeff Lary, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT) both individually and globally. Control spectra were taken at the end of the experiment to check for the possible occurrence of degradation and/or oxidation. Kinetic Measurements—The CO/O2 displacement kinetics was measured at 20 °C on an HP 3852 diode array spectrophotometer. The carbonmonoxy derivative was obtained by equilibrating the oxygenated protein with 1 atm CO gas over 24 h in a tonometer. The CO-bound protein was added to a 1-cm gas-tight quartz cuvette containing a measured amount of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer at different oxygen concentrations. The CO-O2 exchange was monitored through the decrease of absorbance at 421 nm, the Soret peak of carbonmonoxy-trHb. At the highest CO/O2 ratios analyzed, an alternative procedure was used. Concentrated samples of oxygenated trHb (1–10 μl at a protein concentration of 0.5–1.5 mm) were added to a 10-cm path length and gas-tight cuvette (8 ml, total volume) containing buffer equilibrated with 1 mm CO. The O2-CO exchange was monitored through the increase of absorbance at 421 nm. Data points were taken every 12–36 s for 1–2 h. In all cases, the final trHb concentration was between 1 and 5 μm. Rapid kinetics experiments for the measurements of the oxygen release kinetics were conducted in a stopped-flow apparatus (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK). The protein concentration was 5 μm in 0.2 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The rate constant of oxygen release was obtained by mixing a solution of oxy-trHb with CO-saturated (1 mm) buffer containing an excess of sodium dithionite (10–50 mm). Under these conditions, the CO binding reaction is fast, and oxygen release is the rate-limiting factor. The increase in absorbance at 421 nm, corresponding to the formation of carbonmonoxy-trHb, was monitored. The dependence of the apparent rate of oxygen release, kobs, upon dithionite concentration was investigated by mixing the oxygenated protein with increasing amounts of dithionite. A dithionite stock solution (98 mm) was prepared according to Lambeth and Palmer (14Lambeth D.O. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6059-6103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and diluted to concentrations in the range 0.8–50 mm with degassed buffer. Absorbance changes at 434 nm, corresponding to the Soret absorption band of the deoxygenated derivative, and at 416 nm were followed. Control experiments were also carried out by mixing ferric horse Mb and ferric Bs-trHb with dithionite at varying concentrations in order to monitor the reduction kinetics of the ferric derivatives. In these experiments, the ferric protein solutions were degassed and equilibrated under nitrogen prior to mixing with the dithionite solutions. The kinetics of CO binding to deoxy-trHb were measured by rapidly mixing a solution of deoxy-trHb with 0.2 m phosphate buffer containing sodium dithionite (10–50 mm) and CO at concentrations ranging from 15 to 250 μm. The decrease in absorbance at 434 nm was followed. The CO binding kinetics of B. subtilis trHb were measured also by laser photolysis. The protein concentration was 5 μm in 0.2 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The protein solution was degassed exhaustively in a tonometer equipped with a fluorescence quartz cell of 1 cm length and was equilibrated with CO gas at an equilibrium concentration of 1 or 0.2 mm. The measurements were carried out at 20 °C using as an optical pump the second harmonic from a Quanta System Nd-YAG laser (λ = 532 nm, frequency = 2 Hz with pulse width of 5 ns and pulse energy of ∼80 mJ). The laser pulse flashes the sample orthogonally to the optical probe because of a 100-watt UV-visible source focused onto a monochromator SPEX 1681. Single wavelength measurements were acquired using a Hamamatsu photomultiplier tube H6870 as a detector. The time courses (average of 64 traces) were followed at the Soret peak of the deoxy derivative (434 nm) and were recorded using a Tektronix TDS 360 digital oscilloscope. The CO dissociation kinetics were measured by mixing the trHb-CO adduct with solutions containing NO in excess. The trHb-CO derivative was prepared by equilibrating overnight a concentrated oxy-trHb sample (200 μm) with 1 atm CO. For the measurements, the CO derivative was diluted 80-fold with deoxygenated buffer containing a 2 mm NO solution in a sealed 1-cm path length cuvette. The signal decrease at 421 nm was followed over a period of 2 h. Oxidation reactions were carried out by exposing oxygenated Bs-trHb in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, to H2O2 or potassium ferricyanide in 1–50 m excess. Incubation of the protein for 24 h in the presence of a 50 m excess of ferricyanide yields the fully oxidized protein. Excess oxidant and oxidation products were removed by passage through a G-25 column equilibrated with 0.1 m phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 containing 0.5 m KCl. EPR Spectra—Continuous wave EPR spectra were recorded using a Bruker ER 200D series X-band spectrometer equipped with a TE102 cavity and an Oxford Instruments ESR-900 helium flow cryostat. The spectra were measured on the ferric Bs-trHb adduct and on the ferrous oxygenated derivative at pH 7.0. Sequence and Structure Analysis—The sequence alignment of representative group II and group I trHbs, selected among those whose structural and/or ligand binding properties have been determined, is presented in Fig. 1. The three glycine motifs, which characterize the compact 2-over-2 α-helical fold of trHbs, and relevant residues in the heme pocket are highlighted. In Bs-trHb residue B10 is Tyr as in many bacterial hemoglobins, whereas residue E7 is Thr, at variance with the other group II trHbs previously studied that have a hydrophobic Ala residue in this position (1Wittenberg J.B. Bolognesi M. Wittenberg B.A. Guertin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 871-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The B9 and CD1 positions, usually occupied by aromatic residues, are both Phe residues, and position E11 hosts the less conserved Gln. Analysis of the three-dimensional structure (Fig. 2) brings out similarities and differences relative to M. tuberculosis HbO, the only group II hemoglobin whose crystal structure has been determined (4Milani M. Savard P.-Y. Ouellet H. Ascenzi P. Guertin M. Bolognesi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5766-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The overall fold and the relative position of the heme and of the heme contacting residues are similar in the two proteins. Thus, despite three deletions occurring in Bs-trHb relative to HbO (the first between helices A and B, the second between helices C and E, and the third between helices G and H, see Fig. 1), four α-helices (G, H, E, and B) are organized in a two-over-two α-helical fold. The structural comparison between the two proteins carried out by superimposing these four α-helices yields a root mean square deviation of 0.771 Å (Fig. 2). The F-helix is reduced to a one-turn helix placed in the middle of a flexible loop. Bs-trHb conserves the so-called ϕ-helix (residues 62–65), a common characteristic of all group II trHbs. The major differences between the two proteins are observed in the flexible regions (CD1 loop, pre-F loop, and the loop between helices G and H). In Bs-trHb the CD1 loop is less flexible than in HbO; in particular, the four residues 34–37 are organized in a one-turn helix. Moreover, in Bs-trHb the loop which precedes the small F-helix (residues 52–58) is more extended toward the solvent and appears to be less polar than in HbO (Pro60 substitutes an Arg residue in HbO). In addition, the loop between helices G and H, which is polar and extended toward the solvent in HbO, in Bs-trHb is shorter and apolar because of the deletion of three polar residues, namely Ser101, Glu102, and Thr103 of HbO, and to the substitution of Asp100 with a Gly residue (Gly101 in Bs-trHb). Distal Heme Pocket—The distal heme pocket of Bs-trHb is characterized by the presence of an array of polar residues surrounding the bound ligand, namely Tyr25-B10, Thr45-E7, and Gln49-E11 (Fig. 3A). The cyanide ion is almost perpendicular to the heme plane, and the carbon atom is bound to the ferric heme iron at a distance of 1.92 Å. The cyanide ion is stabilized mostly by the Tyr25-B10 residue, which is hydrogen-bonded through the OH group directly to the cyanide nitrogen atom (distance = 2.54 Å). Trp89-G8 is buried in the distal pocket and is roughly parallel to the heme plane with the indole NE1 atom placed at a distance of 3.4 Å from the cyanide nitrogen atom. At the external edge of the distal site, a Lys residue (Lys48-E10) forms a salt bridge with the heme propionate D (distance O1D–NZ = 2.23 Å). This salt bridge is on the external surface of the protein and may hinder access to the distal pocket. Most interestingly, position E10 is occupied by a positively charged residue in all three groups of trHbs. Proximal Heme Pocket—In Bs-trHb the heme is inserted into a crevice formed by the two antiparallel E- and G-helices and the short F-helix. The architecture of the heme pocket in the proximal region is dominated by Arg75-F7, His76-F8, Phe79, and Met121-H10 (see Fig. 3C) and differs from HbO where position H10 is occupied by a leucine residue (Fig. 3D). The position and orientation of the proximal histidine is typical of an unstrained imidazole ring that facilitates the heme in-plane location of the iron atom. Although the unconstrained histidine conformation appears to be a common feature of the trHbs investigated to date (28Samuni U. Ouellet Y. Guertin M. Friedman J.M. Yeh S.R. J. Am. Chem.

https://openalex.org/W2110833751,"The ryanodine receptor-calcium release channel complex (RyR) plays a pivotal role in excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal and cardiac muscle. RyR channel activity is modulated by interaction with FK506-binding protein (FKBP), and disruption of the RyR-FKBP association has been implicated in cardiomyopathy, cardiac hypertrophy, and heart failure. Evidence for an interaction between RyR and FKBP is well documented, both in skeletal muscle (RyR1-FKBP12) and in cardiac muscle (RyR2-FKBP12.6), however definition of the FKBP-binding site remains elusive. Early reports proposed interaction of a short RyR central domain with FKBP12/12.6, however this site has been questioned, and recently an alternative FKBP12.6 interaction site has been identified within the N-terminal half of RyR2. In this study, we report evidence for the human RyR2 C-terminal domain as a novel FKBP12.6-binding site. Using competition binding assays, we find that short C-terminal RyR2 fragments can displace bound FKBP12.6 from the native RyR2, although they are unable to exclusively support interaction with FKBP12.6. However, expression of a large RyR2 C-terminal construct in mammalian cells encompassing the pore-forming transmembrane domains exhibits rapamycin-sensitive binding specifically to FKBP12.6 but not to FKBP12. We also obtained some evidence for involvement of the RyR2 N-terminal, but not the central domain, in FKBP12.6 interaction. Our studies suggest that a novel interaction site for FKBP12.6 may be present at the RyR2 C terminus, proximal to the channel pore, a sterically appropriate location that would enable this protein to play a central role in the modulation of this critical ion channel.

Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) 1The abbreviations used are: RyR, ryanodine receptor; FKBP, FK506-binding protein; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; IP, immunoprecipitation; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; Ab, antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. are intracellular Ca2+ channels located in the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum of muscle and non-muscle cells. They govern the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and play an essential role in various cellular processes, including muscle contraction, neurotransmission, secretion, and apoptosis (1Berridge M. Lipp P. Bootman M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4493) Google Scholar). Three genes coding for mammalian RyRs have been identified; ryr1, the major form expressed in skeletal muscle, ryr2, the major form expressed in heart and brain, and ryr3, which is found at low levels in a number of tissues (2Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 3Sutko J. Airey J. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1027-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The primary structure of all three has been deduced by cDNA cloning and suggests a small hydrophobic C terminus forming the channel pore with the remaining ∼80% of the molecule being cytoplasmic. RyR channel activity is regulated by Ca2+, Mg2+, ATP, phosphorylation and redox status, and a number of accessory proteins (3Sutko J. Airey J. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1027-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 4Zucchi R. Ronca-Testoni S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 1-51PubMed Google Scholar, 5Mackrill J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 345-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The RyR-calcium release channel complex is composed of four RyR protomers with a molecular mass of ∼560 kDa and four identical small subunits of ∼12 kDa, known as FKBP (FK506-binding protein). FKBP12 and its closely related FKBP12.6 isoform are classified as immunophilins, because they are the receptor proteins for the immunosuppressant drugs FK506 and rapamycin, and they are the smaller members of an extensive and ubiquitous FKBP family (6Galat A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4945-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 7Kay J. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). FKBPs have a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity, and it has been suggested that FK506 and rapamycin mimic a twisted-amide, leucyl-prolyl bond in natural protein substrates (8Schreiber S. Science. 1991; 251: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar, 9Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1) binds both FKBP12/12.6 with similar affinities (10Timerman A. Ogunbumni E. Freund E. Wiederrecht G. Marks A. Fleischer S. J. Biol.

FKBP12/12.6 binding to RyR modulates the Ca2+-flux properties of the channel complex; in particular, it stabilizes the full conductance state (14Brillantes A. Ondrias K. Scott A. Kobrinsky E.

Given the profound effects of FKBP on both the channel activity and conductance of the RyR and its peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerizing activity, it was suggested that FKBP binds to Pro-4595 (numbering given for the human RyR2), a residue located within a hydrophobic, predicted transmembrane domain at the RyR C terminus (14Brillantes A.

Furthermore, it was proposed that the FKBP-binding site may reside in, or near, the conduction pore of the channel, because FKBP12 binding to RyR1 was found to be voltage-dependent in single channel electrophysiological experiments (25Ma J. Bhat M. Zhao J. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2398-2404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, the early biochemical evidence indicated that FKBP binds to a short, central portion of the RyR, mapping to amino acids 2407–2520 for RyR1 (26Cameron A. Nucifora F. Fung E. Livingston D. Aldape R. Ross C. Snyder S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27582-27588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and at amino acids 2361–2496 for RyR2 (16Marx S. Reiken S.

Cell. 2000; 101: 365-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar), as identified with the yeast two-hybrid assay. Further support for this central location was provided by mutational analysis in full-length RyR1 (22Avila G. Lee E. Perez C. Allen P. Dirksen R. J. Biol.

These studies identified Val-2461 in RyR1 (and the corresponding Val-2322 in RyR3) as an important residue for FKBP binding. However, a recent report has questioned the involvement of the central domain in the interaction of FKBP12.6 with RyR2 (30Masumiya H. Wang R. Zhang J. Xiao B. Chen S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3786-3792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Using a GST-FKBP12.6 pull-down assay, it was found that deletion of residues 2358–2530, or mutations within the central domain, did not prevent GST-FKBP12.6 from binding to RyR2 mutant channels expressed in HEK293 cells (30Masumiya H. Wang R. Zhang J. Xiao B. Chen S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3786-3792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In agreement with the latter report, we were also unable to demonstrate an interaction between fragments containing the previously suggested FKBP-binding site in any of the three mammalian RyR isoforms, with either FKBP12 or FKBP12.6, using two different techniques, the yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (31Zissimopoulos S. Lai F.A. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the N-terminal region of the RyR2 has been implicated in FKBP12.6 binding. Using co-immunoprecipitation assays and GST-FKBP affinity chromatography, the first 1855 N-terminal residues of RyR2 was shown to interact with FKBP12.6 (30Masumiya H. Wang R. Zhang J. Xiao B. Chen S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3786-3792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 32Xiao B. Sutherland C. Walsh M. Chen S.R. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Our studies indicated that there is no interaction between FKBP12.6 and a series of overlapping fragments encompassing the entire RyR2 (31Zissimopoulos S. Lai F.A. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that short peptide fragments (<900 residues) containing the central region or other domains of the cardiac RyR are not sufficient to support the interaction with FKBP12.6 (31Zissimopoulos S. Lai F.A. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the controversy with regard to the precise identity of the FKBP-binding site on the RyR, we undertook a strategy to indirectly identify the FKBP12.6 interaction site(s) on RyR2 using the aforementioned RyR2 overlapping fragments. Using solubilized cardiac heavy sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles and competition binding experiments, we report here that C-terminal fragments (spanning RyR2 residues 3788–4765) displace bound FKBP12.6 from the native channel. RyR2 N-terminal or central domain constructs displayed no effect on the RyR2-FKBP12.6 interaction. Furthermore, an RyR2 C-terminal construct encompassing the poreforming transmembrane domains (amino acids 3788–4967), was shown to interact with FKBP12.6 in a rapamycin-sensitive way. Under identical conditions, FKBP12 failed to interact with the RyR2 C terminus. In addition, we found that a large RyR2 N-terminal fragment (amino acids 1–2064) was also capable of FKBP12.6 binding, however protein expression differences prevented a direct comparison of the FKBP12.6-binding affinities of these two RyR2 domains. Materials—Cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. Radioactive sulfur was obtained from Amersham Biosciences in the form of Pro-Mix containing ∼70% l-[35S]methionine and 30% l-[35S]cysteine. Pfu DNA polymerase was obtained from Promega, and oligonucleotides were from MWG Biotech or Sigma-Genosys. DNA restriction endonucleases and other DNA-modifying enzymes were from Amersham Biosciences. CHAPS and rapamycin were obtained from Calbiochem. Electrophoresis reagents were from Bio-Rad. All other reagents were from Sigma. Antibodies—Abc-Myc, a mouse monoclonal to c-Myc antigen (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), was used at 1:500 dilution for Western blotting and 1:100 dilution for immunoprecipitation (IP). AbFKBP/C-19, a goat polyclonal to FKBP (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), was used at 1:200 dilution for Western blotting. The RyR antibodies, 33, 1093, 129, 2149, and 2160, were used at 1:500 dilution for Western blotting and 1:40 dilution for IP. The RyR2-specific Ab1093 (epitope at residues 4454–4474) (33Xiao B.

Blayney L. Tan Y. Marty A. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1256-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) have been described previously. The RyR consensus Ab33 was produced in rabbits against a synthetic peptide, TLTAKEKAKDREKAQDILKFL, which corresponds to residues 2876–2896. The RyR consensus Ab2149 was produced in rabbits against a synthetic peptide, TGQESYVWKMYQER, which corresponds to residues 4933–4948. Plasmid Construction—Preparation of the human RyR2-overlapping fragments (BT constructs, Fig. 1), human FKBP12 and FKBP12.6 have been recently described (31Zissimopoulos S. Lai F.A. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). A large RyR2 C-terminal construct (pc-MycRyR2C), encoding amino acids 3788–4967 with an N-terminal c-Myc tag, was generated as follows: the BT71 cDNA insert together with the c-Myc tag-encoding sequence was PCR-amplified using primers annealing on the pGBKT7 vector, and cloned in the mammalian expression vector pCR3 (Invitrogen) using the HindIII-XhoI sites. This construct was extended to the end of the hRyR2 coding sequence by transferring the FseI-11505 to XhoI-15335 cDNA fragment from the full-length hRyR2. A large RyR2 N-terminal construct (pc-Myc1–2064), encoding amino acids 1–2064 with an N-terminal c-Myc tag, was generated as follows: the BT4 cDNA insert (nucleotides 122–2398) was subcloned in the c-Myc-modified pCR3 vector using the NdeI-SalI sites. This construct was extended to nucleotide 4987 by transferring the BT3 cDNA sequence (nucleotides 2153–4987) using the BglII-2398 and SalI (vector) sites. The latter construct was extended to nucleotide 6315 by transferring the BamHI-4987 to NcoI-6315 cDNA fragment from BT5 (nucleotides 4811–7645); the NcoI site at the 3′-end was blunted using Pfu DNA polymerase and ligated into the SalI site of the vector also blunted with Pfu treatment. All constructs were verified by direct DNA sequencing (BigDye, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cell-free Protein Expression—In vitro cell-free protein expression was carried out using the TnT T7 Quick-coupled transcription and translation system (Promega). Reactions were carried out in 10-μl volumes by adding the TnT mix with 1 μg of plasmid DNA together with 1 μl (0.53 MBq or 14 μCi) of 35S-labeled methionine (Pro-Mix, Amersham Biosciences) or 1 μl of 1 mm unlabeled methionine. Where necessary, 1.5 μl of canine pancreatic microsomes (Promega) was included. Reaction samples were incubated in a 30 °C water bath for 90 min and terminated by placing on ice. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Immunolocalization—HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells at 80–90% confluence were transiently transfected with the pc-MycRyR2C or pc-Myc1–2064 plasmids using either Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) or the calcium phosphate precipitation method, depending on the nature of the experiment (see below). For microsome preparation and use in co-immunoprecipitation experiments, eight 100-mm Petri dishes were transfected with 24 μg of pc-MycRyR2C plasmid DNA per dish using Lipofectamine2000, according to the manufacturer's instructions, at a 1:2 plasmid DNA:transfection reagent ratio. Cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection, and crude microsomes were prepared as described below. For cell lysate preparation and use in co-immunoprecipitation experiments, six 100-mm Petri dishes were transfected with 24 μg of either pc-Myc1–2064 or pc-MycRyR2C plasmid DNA per dish, using the calcium phosphate precipitation method according to procedures described elsewhere (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection, and cell lysates were prepared as described below. Transiently transfected cells grown on glass coverslips were washed in PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS) for 15 min at room temperature, and after re-hydration in PBS, cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 (in PBS) for 30 min. Nonspecific immunoreactivity was blocked using 10% fetal bovine serum (in PBS) for 2 h. Coverslips were incubated with Abc-Myc (1:100 dilution in PBS) overnight at 4 °C, followed by an anti-mouse Alexa Fluor488-conjugated antibody (Molecular Probes). Fluorescent cells were viewed on a Leica TCS4D confocal microscope using Scanware software (Leica). Transfection efficiency was estimated to be ∼20% for pc-MycRyR2C and ∼2% for pc-Myc1–2064 using the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent. Cell Lysate and Microsome Preparation—Crude microsomes were prepared as follows: HEK293 cells were resuspended in homogenization buffer (0.3 m sucrose, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4), ∼15 × 106 cells/ml buffer, supplemented with Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), and homogenized on ice by 20 passages through a needle (23-gauge, 0.6 × 25 mm) and dispersing the cell suspension through a half volume of glass beads (425–600 μm, Sigma). Cell nuclei and glass beads were removed by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was subjected to centrifugation at ∼120,000 × g (55,000 rpm, Beckman TLA100.4 rotor) for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet, representing the crude microsomal fraction, was resuspended in homogenization buffer and stored at –80 °C. Typically, ∼1 mg of microsomal protein was obtained from 15 × 106 cells. For subcellular fractionation studies, microsomes were resuspended in 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11, and incubated for 1 h on ice, to extract peripheral proteins, before recovering the microsomal pellet by centrifugation. The cell lysate was prepared as follows: HEK293 cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.4% CHAPS, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4), ∼15 × 106 cells/ml of buffer, supplemented with Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The cell suspension was frozen in liquid nitrogen followed by thawing at 37 °C and then passed 20 times through a needle (23-gauge, 0.6 × 25 mm); this procedure was repeated twice more, and the lysed cell suspension was incubated overnight at 4 °C with continuous mixing. Insoluble material was pelleted at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was withdrawn and used directly for immunoprecipitation experiments with in vitro synthesized, radiolabeled FKBP12.6. Co-sedimentation Assays—HEK293 cells at 80–90% confluence were transiently transfected with FKBP12 or FKBP12.6 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two 100-mm Petri dishes were transfected using 24 μg of plasmid DNA per dish, at a 1:2 plasmid DNA to transfection reagent ratio. After 24 h, one of the two dishes was further transfected with pc-MycRyR2C, whereas the other one was mock transfected, and both dishes were kept in culture for another 24 h. This sequential transfection protocol was employed to ensure that single and double transfected cells express similar levels of FKBP protein. Cells were collected 48 h post-transfection for FKBP (24 h post-transfection for pc-MycRyR2C) and homogenized as described above. The low speed supernatant was divided in two aliquots (∼1.5 mg each), 20 μm rapamycin was added to one of the two aliquots, and samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Microsomal membranes were sedimented at ∼120,000 × g (55,000 rpm, Beckman TLA100.4 rotor) for 1 h at 4 °C, resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer (60 mm Tris, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8), heated at 85 °C for 5 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using AbFKBP/C-19, an antibody that recognizes both FKBP12/12.6. Preparation of Cardiac Heavy SR Vesicles—Cardiac heavy SR vesicles from pig hearts were prepared as described by Meissner and Henderson (37Meissner G. Henderson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3065-3073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and modified by Sitsapesan and Williams (38Sitsapesan R. Williams A. J. Physiol. 1990; 423: 425-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Briefly, ventricle muscle was homogenized in four volumes of homogenization buffer (10 mm Pipes, 0.3 m sucrose, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitors, 2 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, and 10 μm leupeptin) with the use of a blender, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was re-homogenized in one volume of homogenization buffer, and the centrifugation step was repeated. The two supernatants were combined, filtered through four sheets of cheesecloth, and centrifuged at ∼120,000 × g (30,000 rpm, Beckman 45-Ti rotor) for 45 min at 4 °C. The pellet representing the crude cardiac microsomal fraction was resuspended in gradient buffer (10 mm Pipes, 0.4 m KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, pH 7.0) and layered on a discontinuous sucrose gradient consisting of three layers of 40%, 30%, and 20% sucrose (in the salt solution used for the gradient buffer). The gradients were centrifuged at ∼70,000 × g (20,000 rpm, Beckman SW28.1 rotor) for 14 h at 4 °C, and the 30–40% interface containing the heavy SR vesicles was collected and diluted with an equal volume of 10 mm Pipes, pH 7.4. Cardiac heavy SR vesicles were pelleted at ∼125,000 × g (32,000 rpm, Beckman 50.2-Ti rotor) for 1 h at 4 °C, resuspended in homogenization buffer at 20 mg/ml protein concentration, and stored at –80 °C. Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—In vitro expressed proteins, produced in individual TnT reactions (Promega), were mixed and solubilized in 200 μl of IP buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.4% CHAPS, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4) by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. A specific antibody was added at the appropriate dilution, and the sample was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with continuous mixing, followed by addition of 20 μl of protein G Dynabeads (Dynal) and incubation for a further 2 h. Protein immunocomplexes were isolated with the use of a magnetic particle concentrator (MPC-S, Dynal), and beads were washed three times with IP buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, heated at 85 °C for 5 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Where multiple IP samples of the same protein were to be processed, the individual TnT reactions (of the same protein) were mixed and an equal aliquot was distributed to the IP samples, to minimize variations in protein expression. For the experiments with native RyR2, cardiac heavy SR vesicles (1 mg) were solubilized in 200 μl of IP buffer by overnight incubation at 4 °C, with continuous mixing. The insoluble material was pelleted at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was withdrawn, mixed with the in vitro synthesized, radiolabeled FKBP protein for 1 h at room temperature, and processed as described above. For the expression studies in HEK293 cells and use of crude microsomes, the microsomes (∼1.5 mg) were solubilized in 200 μl of IP buffer by overnight incubation at 4 °C with continuous mixing. The insoluble material was pelleted at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was withdrawn, mixed overnight with the in vitro synthesized, radiolabeled FKBP protein at 4 °C, and processed as described above. For the expression studies in HEK293 cells and use of whole cell lysates, the cell lysates (∼8 mg) were incubated with Abc-Myc (2 μg) and 50 μl of protein G Dynabeads (Dynal) for 8 h at 4 °C with continuous mixing to isolate the c-Myc-tagged RyR2 fragments. Protein immunocomplexes were isolated with the use of a magnetic particle concentrator (MPC-S, Dynal), resuspended in 200 μl of IP buffer, and mixed overnight with in vitro synthesized, radiolabeled FKBP12.6 at 4 °C. Protein immunocomplexes were isolated, the beads were washed three times with IP buffer, and immunoprecipitated proteins were resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, heated at 85 °C for 5 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins from SDS-PAGE gels were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) using a semi-dry transfer system (Trans-Blot SD, Bio-Rad) in transfer buffer (48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, 0.0375% SDS, 20% methanol) at 20 V for 30 min to 2 h, depending on protein size. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk protein (Marvel) in TBS-T buffer (20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4). Primary antibodies were applied in the appropriate dilution overnight at 4 °C, followed by horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoreactive protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Autoradiography—Radiolabeled proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was fixed (40% methanol, 10% acetic acid) for 30 min. The fixing solution was removed, and the gel was incubated with a fluorographic enhancer (Amplify, Amersham Biosciences) for a further 30 min and subsequently dried. The dried gel was exposed to an x-ray film (Kodak) at –80 °C for variable periods of time. Densitometric analysis was performed using a GS-700 scanner (Bio-Rad) and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). RyR2 C-terminal Fragments Compete for FKBP12.6 Binding with the Native Channel—We recently demonstrated that the native RyR2 interacts with FKBP12.6 in a rapamycin-sensitive way but not with FKBP12; in contrast, the native RyR1 was found to interac"

Here we demonstrate a novel nonenzymatic function for caspase-2 other than its reported proteolytic role in apoptosis. Caspase-2, unlike caspase-3, -6, -7, -9, -11, -12, and -14, is a potent inducer of NF-κB and p38 MAPK activation in a TRAF2-mediated way. Caspase-2 interacts with TRAF1, TRAF2, and RIP1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that endogenous caspase-2 is recruited into a large and inducible protein complex, together with TRAF2 and RIP1. Structure-function analysis shows that NF-κB activation occurs independent of enzymatic activity of the protease and that the caspase recruitment domain of caspase-2 is sufficient for the activation of NF-κB and p38 MAPK. These results demonstrate the inducible assembly of a novel protein complex consisting of caspase-2, TRAF2, and RIP1 that activates NF-κB and p38 MAPK through the caspase recruitment domain of caspase-2 independently of its proteolytic activity.

NF-κB and p38 MAPK activation are involved in the transcriptional activation of numerous inflammation-related and antiapoptotic genes in response to cytokines, bacterial products, and cellular stress conditions (1Baud V.

Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Pathogen-derived products such as peptidoglycan, double-stranded RNA, and lipopolysaccharide lead to NF-κB activation through stimulation of surface-exposed TLR-2, -3, and -4, respectively (3Sabroe I.

In addition to pathogen-derived products, the proinflammatory cytokines TNF 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; DD, death domain; CARD, caspase recruitment domain; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; DN, dominant negative. and interleukin-1 also induce NF-κB activation by binding to their respective cell surface receptors (4Baeuerle P.A.

These receptors signal through distinct pathways (3Sabroe I. Read R.C. Whyte M.K. Dockrell D.H. Vogel S.N. Dower S.K. J.

For example, activation of NF-κB through TNF-R1 stimulation occurs through assembly of an intracellular signaling complex containing TRADD, TRAF2, and RIP1 (7Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 8Micheau O. Tschopp J.

Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar), RIP2 has recently been identified as the central downstream mediator of NF-κB activation arising from TLR-2, -3, and -4 (11Kobayashi K.

MAPKs are an evolutionarily conserved family of cytosolic serine/threonine kinases that modulate the activity of other intracellular proteins by phosphorylation of specific serine/threonine residues. Extracellular stimuli of the p38 MAPK pathway include a variety of cytokines and a number of pathogens that activate p38 through the different TLR receptors (13Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar). Moreover, MAPK is induced by several growth factors (14Foltz I.N. Lee J.C. Young P.R. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3296-3301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), as well as by environmental factors such as heat shock, changes in osmolarity, and ultraviolet irradiation (13Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar). The downstream targets of p38 MAPK are other kinases or transcription factors such as AP-1. The main biological response to p38 MAPK activation involves the production and activation of inflammatory mediators to initiate leukocyte recruitment and activation. Caspase-2 is one of the most conserved caspases across species, and it clusters phylogenetically with CED-3 and the inflammatory caspases, caspase-1, -4, -5, -11, and -12 (15Lamkanfi M. Declercq W. Kalai M. Saelens X. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Initially caspase-2 was described as a neuronally expressed caspase that is down-regulated during the course of brain development (16Kumar S. Kinoshita M. Noda M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1613-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Caspase-2 recently was demonstrated to be required for mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and the release of apoptogenic factors, such as cytochrome c and Diablo, in response to several DNA-damaging agents (17Lassus P. Opitz-Araya X. Lazebnik Y. Science. 2002; 297: 1352-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 18Robertson J.D. Gogvadze V. Kropotov A. Vakifahmetoglu H. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 13430-13437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it seems that full maturation of the protease, rather than its enzymatic activity, is required for the release of cytochrome c and Diablo from mitochondria (18Robertson J.D. Gogvadze V. Kropotov A. Vakifahmetoglu H. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The death domain superfamily includes the death domain (DD), the death effector domain, the caspase recruitment domain (CARD), and the recently identified PYRIN domain (21Martinon F. Hofmann K. Tschopp J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R118-R120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 22Weber C.H. Vincenz C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 475-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Members of this superfamily of homotypic oligomerization domains are involved in both the recruitment of adaptor proteins and the assembly of protein complexes, hereby promoting proteolytic activation of the recruited caspases in the context of apoptosis and inflammation. At its N terminus, caspase-2 contains a CARD that is involved in the formation of filamentous and dotlike structures (23Colussi P.A. Harvey N.L. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24535-24542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 24Shearwin-Whyatt L.M. Harvey N.L. Kumar S. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Besides caspase-2, several other CARD- or death effector domain-containing proteins, including caspase-8, FADD, RAIDD, and Bcl-10, have been shown to oligomerize and to form filamentous structures (25Jabado O. Wang Q. Rideout H.J. Yeasmin M. Guo K.X. Vekrellis K. Papantonis S. Angelastro J.M. Troy C.M. Stefanis L. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 618-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 26Siegel R.M.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1131-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the case of caspase-8, FADD, and RAIDD, such structures are associated with the induction of apoptosis (25Jabado O. Wang Q. Rideout H.J. Yeasmin M. Guo K.X. Vekrellis K. Papantonis S. Angelastro J.M. Troy C.M. Stefanis L. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 618-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 26Siegel R.M.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1131-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Via its CARD domain, caspase-2 interacts with the CARD-containing adaptor proteins RAIDD/CRADD (24Shearwin-Whyatt L.M.

It can therefore be argued that caspase-2, through its CARD, may be recruited to large multiprotein complexes in response to death or inflammatory signals. Indeed, upon incubation of cell lysates at 37 °C, endogenous caspase-2 elutes in high molecular weight fractions (Mr >670,000), suggesting that it can be recruited in vivo to a large protein complex similar to the caspase-9-containing apoptosome (Mr >700,000) (33Read S.H. Baliga B.C. Ekert P.G. Vaux D.L. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and caspase-1-containing inflammasomes (Mr >700,000) (34Agostini L. Martinon F.

Cell. 2002; 10: 417-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4233) Google Scholar). The adaptor proteins RAIDD and PIDD have recently been identified as members of this large caspase-2 complex designated the “PIDDosome” (36Tinel A. Tschopp J. Science. 2004; 304: 843-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that caspase-2, like caspase-1 and -8, but unlike caspase-3, -6, -7, -9, -11, -12, and -14, potently induces p38 MAPK and NF-κB activation. This NF-κB-activating function is independent of its enzymatic activity and resides in the N-terminal CARD domain. Caspase-2 interacts with TRAF1, TRAF2, and RIP1. Furthermore, endogenous caspase-2, along with TRAF2 and RIP1, is recruited into a large and inducible protein complex (Mr >670,000). RIP1, a known substrate of caspase-8 (37Martinon F. Holler N. Richard C. Tschopp J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 134-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 38Lin Y. Devin A. Rodriguez Y. Liu Z.G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2514-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar), is not cleaved by caspase-2. These results suggest that, in addition to its role in nuclear stress-induced apoptosis, caspase-2 may be involved in proinflammatory pathways through the TRAF2- and RIP1-mediated activation of p38 MAPK and NF-κB. Plasmids—The cloning of cDNAs encoding murine caspase-2, -3, -6, -7, -11, -12, and -14 have been described (39Van de Craen M. Van Loo G. Pype S. Van Criekinge W. Van den Brande I. Molemans F.

Caspase-2 deletion mutants were generated by PCR and cloned into the pCAGGS-E vector. The cDNA encoding human caspase-2 CARD was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from a THP-1 cDNA library and cloned into pCAGGS-E vector in frame with the N-terminal E-tag. Full-length RIP1 was cloned into the pEF1 vector (Invitrogen) in frame with a C-terminal V5-HIS epitope tag. All PCR products were checked by sequencing to ensure that no errors had been introduced by PCR. The following expression plasmids were obtained from the indicated sources. pNF-conLuc, encoding the luciferase reporter gene driven by a minimal NF-κB-responsive promoter, was a gift from Dr. A. Israël (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). The plasmid pUT651, encoding β-galactosidase, was obtained from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). pNLS-EGFP is a modified pEGFP-N1 plasmid (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein with a nuclear localization signal. Plasmids encoding dominant negative forms of IKK-β and TRAF2 were generous gifts from Dr. J. Schmid (University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria) and Dr. D. V. Goeddel (Genentech, South San Francisco, CA), respectively. pCR3-RIP2 and pCR3-RIP2-CARD (RIP2 DN) were kindly provided by Dr. J. Tschopp (University of Lausanne, Epalinges, Switzerland). The plasmid encoding murine A20 was kindly provided by Dr. K. Heyninck (Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium). Plasmids encoding TRAF1 and TRAF2 were gifts of Dr. I. Carpentier (Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium). Transfection, Co-immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting Assays—293T cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (41O'Mahoney J.V. Adams T.E. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 1227-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded the day before transfection in 6-well plates (BD Biosciences) at 2 × 105 cells/well. Cells were transfected for 4 h, washed, and incubated for another 24 h before lysates were prepared. Lysates were prepared by harvesting the cells and lysing them in ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 142.5 mm KCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EGTA) or using three cycles of freeze-thawing in TNE buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mix (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates (0.5 ml) were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min and immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies, including anti-E (Amersham Biosciences), anti-Myc (Invitrogen), anti-RIP1 (BD Pharmingen), and anti-HA antibodies (Babco, Richmond, CA), in combination with 15 μl of Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Immune complexes were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were subsequently incubated with various antibodies, including the 11B4 rat monoclonal anti-caspase-2 antibody (kindly provided by Dr. S. Kumar, Hanson Institute and Adelaide University, Adelaide, Australia), anti-TRAF2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-E (Amersham Biosciences), and anti-V5 antibodies (Invitrogen), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and detected by an ECL method. Alternatively, lysates were analyzed directly by immunoblotting. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against recombinant murine caspase-3, -6, -7, -11, -12, and -14 were prepared at the Centre d'Economie Rurale (Laboratoire d'Hormonologie Animale, Marloie, Belgium). Anti-p38 MAPK antibodies were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Anti-green fluorescent protein antibody was from Clontech. Anti-human caspase-3 antibody was purchased from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA). Quantification of NF-κB Activity—293T cells were transfected with the indicated expression vectors in combination with 100 ng of NF-κB-luciferase and pUT651-β-galactosidase reporter plasmids. In some experiments, cells were treated for 6 h with 500 IU/ml TNF-α prior to harvesting. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were collected, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in Tris phosphate (25 mm, pH 7.8), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm cyclohexane-trans-1,2-diaminetetraacetate, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100. After the addition of 50 μl of substrate buffer (658 μm luciferin, 378 mm coenzyme A, and 742 μm ATP) to 20 μl of cell lysates, luciferase activity was assayed in a TopCount NXT microplate scintillation reader (Packard Instrument Co.). To normalize transfection efficiency, cell lysates were also subjected to a β-galactosidase colorimetric assay. In brief, 20 μl of cell lysate were incubated for 5 min at room temperature with 200 μl of a solution containing 0.9 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, 1 mm MgCl2, 45 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. The optical density was read at a wavelength of 595 nm. Results are expressed as relative luciferase units/optical density for β-galactosidase activity. The data represent the average ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. In Vitro Transcription/Translation—pGEM-caspase-2 (40Van de Craen M. Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Van den Brande I.

Translation reactions (2 μl each) were incubated with 200 nm purified recombinant caspase-2 and -8 (42Van de Craen M. Declercq W. Van den brande I. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1117-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) in a total volume of 25 μl of “cell-free system” buffer (0.1% CHAPS, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5 (adjusted with KOH), 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μm leupeptin, 20 μg/μl aprotinin) for 45 min at 37 °C. The resulting cleavage products were analyzed by autoradiography of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Two-hybrid Analysis—The yeast shuttle vectors pAS2 (GAL4 DNA binding domain), pGAD424 (GAL4 activation domain), pVA3 (p53), and pTD1 (SV40 large T antigen) were from Clontech. The cDNA encoding enzymatically inactive murine caspase-2 C320A was cloned in frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain of pAS2. In a similar way, murine TRAF1 was inserted into the pGAD424 vector in frame with the GAL4 activation domain. The yeast strain YRG-2 was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). his3 and lacZ were used as reporter genes, and the auxotrophic markers trp1 and leu2 were used for plasmid selection following transformation. Yeast cells were grown overnight at 30 °C in complete yeast-peptone-dextrose medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose). Transformation of yeast was done by the lithium acetate procedure (43Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Yeast. 1991; 7: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) using YEASTMAKER Carrier DNA (Clontech). PGAD424-mTRAF1 was transformed into the YRG-2 strain with either empty pAS2 vector or pAS2-caspase-2 C320A. In another setup, the YRG-2 strain was cotransformed with pAS2-caspase-2 C320A and the empty pGAD424 vector. Three days after transformation, β-galactosidase activity was determined using the colony lift filter assay (77Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) as a substrate. Interaction between the oncogene p53 and SV40 large T antigen was used as a positive control. Gel Filtration Chromatography—293T cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in buffer A (20 mm HEPES-KOH, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete™; Roche Applied Science). Resuspended cells were subjected to four rounds of freeze/thawing using liquid nitrogen and ice water. Cellular debris was removed by centrifuging twice at 11,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Cleared lysates were fractionated at 4 °C on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated with buffer A, the lysates were applied, and the proteins were eluted in 400-μl fractions with buffer A at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Caspase-2 Induces NF-κB Independently of Its Enzymatic Activity—Since CARD domains have been implicated in NF-κB modulation, we investigated the NF-κB activating capability of the CARD-containing caspase-2. In accordance with published results, we found that wild type caspase-2 induces apoptotic cell death upon overexpression in 293T cells (Fig. 1A). The induction of apoptosis is lost when the catalytic Cys320 in the active site of caspase-2 is mutated to Ala, demonstrating that caspase-2 maturation is required for its proapoptotic function (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, wild type cells overexpressing caspase-2 show significant dose-dependent levels of NF-κB activation, when measured before any morphological signs of apoptosis are visible (Fig. 1B). The mutant expressing enzymatically inactive caspase-2 C320A was similarly potent in inducing NF-κB activity (Fig. 1C), demonstrating that NF-κB activation occurs independently of the proteolytic activity of caspase-2. Specificity of Caspase-2-induced NF-κB Activation—We next asked whether caspases other than caspase-2 can activate NF-κB. Western blot analysis of lysates of 293T cells overexpressing caspase-1, -2, -3, -6, -7, -8, -9, -11, -12, or -14 confirmed the appropriate expression of all of these caspases and the presence of some characteristic proteolytic fragments (Fig. 2A). In addition to the 50-kDa band characteristic of full-length caspase-2, anti-caspase-2 antibodies recognized an additional 34-kDa band, as reported before (23Colussi P.A. Harvey N.L. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24535-24542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 44Butt A.J. Harvey N.L. Parasivam G. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6763-6768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Besides detecting the full-length protein, the anti-caspase-11 antibody also detected an additional 27-kDa fragment characteristic of caspase-11 activation (45Wang S. Miura M. Jung Y. Zhu H. Gagliardini V. Shi L. Greenberg A.H. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20580-20587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, of all caspases in this panel, only wild type caspase-2 is able to activate NF-κB. These results demonstrate that caspase-2-derived activation of NF-κB is not provoked by the transient expression of proteins in general. Because overexpression of procaspase-1, -8, and -9 is highly cytotoxic, as demonstrated by their barely detectable expression levels on Western blots (Fig. 2B), we included the enzymatically inactive procaspase-1 C284A and procaspase-8 C362A mutants and the naturally occurring procaspase-9S variant to study their potential NF-κB-inducing activity. In accordance with previous reports (46Lamkanfi M. Kalai M. Saelens X. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24785-24793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 47Chaudhary P.M. Eby M.T. Jasmin A. Kumar A. Liu L. Hood L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 10838-10844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), we observed significant NF-κB activation with the enzymatically inactive mutants of procaspase-1 and -8, suggesting that the NF-κB-inducing activity of their wild type counterparts is masked by their high cytotoxic activities. In contrast to procaspase-1 and -8, both procaspase-9 and -9S are incapable of activating NF-κB (Fig. 2B). Caspase-2 CARD Is Sufficient for Activation of NF-κB and p38 MAPK—To determine which part of caspase-2 is responsible for NF-κB activation, we generated plasmids encoding different domains of caspase-2 and compared their NF-κB-inducing abilities with that of full-length caspase-2 C320A (Fig. 3A). Western blotting analysis confirmed the appropriate expression of all domains and their combinations (Fig. 3B). Neither the p20 domain, the p10 domain, nor the colinear combination of both was able to induce NF-κB activity. Indeed, the CARD was the only domain capable of inducing NF-κB activity on its own. Moreover, the level of NF-κB activity induced by the CARD was comparable with that observed with caspase-2 C320A, suggesting that the CARD is sufficient for NF-κB activation. We next analyzed the NF-κB-activating ability of the human caspase-2 CARD. As could be expected, a potent dose-dependent induction of NF-κB activation was observed upon overexpression of human caspase-2 CARD in 293T cells (Fig. 3C), demonstrating that the NF-κB-inducing ability of caspase-2 CARD is conserved in mice and humans. We further analyzed whether overexpression of caspase-2 CARD in cells is sufficient for the activation of endogenous p38 MAPK, another important mediator of inflammatory signaling pathways (2Kumar S. Boehm J. Lee J.C. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Although both caspase-2 CARD- and green fluorescent protein-overexpressing cells contain similar basal levels of p38 MAPK, a strong induction of p38 MAPK phosphorylation was observed only in cells expressing caspase-2 CARD (Fig. 3D). All together, these results demonstrate that caspase-2 CARD is capable of activating both NF-κB and p38 MAPK. Caspase-2 Activates NF-κB through TRAF2 and the IKK Complex—To investigate the signaling pathway downstream of caspase-2, we made use of several inhibitors and dominant negative (DN) molecules of key proteins involved in known NF-κB signaling pathways. Because most NF-κB signaling pathways converge at the IKK complex, we started with a kinase-dead mutant (K44A) of IKK-β that functions as a dominant negative inhibitor (IKK-β DN) to analyze whether caspase-2 signals through this central NF-κB-activating complex. Indeed, low levels of IKK-β DN abolish both TNF- and caspase-2-induced NF-κB activation, suggesting that the IKK complex is a central down-stream mediator of caspase-2-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 4A). A20 is an inhibitor of several NF-κB-activating pathways, including those induced by lipopolysaccharide (49Lee E.G. Boone D.L. Chai S. Libby S.L. Chien M. Lodolce J.P. Ma A.

A20 blocked both TNF- and caspase-2-induced activation of NF-κB, suggesting that it is a downstream inhibitor of both pathways (Fig. 4A). We next explored whether TRAF2 is involved in caspase-2-derived NF-κB activation. Several reports have shown that TRAF2, together with RIP1, is needed for TNF- and CD40-induced NF-κB activation (54Hostager B.S. Haxhinasto S.A. Rowland S.L. Bishop G.A. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2007006841,"The ankyrin repeat-containing protein with a suppressor of cytokine signaling box-2 (ASB2) gene was identified as a retinoic acid-response gene and a target of the promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor-α oncogenic protein characteristic of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Expression of ASB2 in myeloid leukemia cells inhibits growth and promotes commitment, recapitulating an early step known to be critical for differentiation.

This is a first indication that a member of the ASB protein family, ASB2, is a subunit of an ECS (Elongin C-Cullin-SOCS box)-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Altogether, our results strongly suggest that ASB2 targets specific proteins to destruction by the proteasome in leukemia cells that have been induced to differentiate.

Altogether, our results strongly suggest that ASB2 targets specific proteins to destruction by the proteasome in leukemia cells that have been induced to differentiate. Identification of genes controlling proliferation and differentiation of myeloid cells is critical for understanding how myelopoiesis is dysregulated by chromosomal abnormalities in leukemia cells. Because committed hematopoietic progenitors are likely targets for leukemic transformation, genes involved in myeloid differentiation might be repressed in leukemia cells and activated when these cells are exposed to agents that induce differentiation.

RARα is a retinoic acid (RA)-dependent transcription factor (3Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2601) Google Scholar) involved in hematopoietic differentiation (4Kastner P. Chan S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7178-7185Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although RARs are dispensable for granulopoiesis (5Kastner P. Lawrence H.J. Waltzinger C. Ghyselinck N.B. Chambon P. Chan S. Blood. 2001; 97: 1314-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), a role for RA in the commitment of hematopoietic progenitors into the granulocytic lineage has been proposed (6Tsai S. Collins S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7153-7157Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 7Labbaye C. Valtieri M. Testa U. Giampaolo A. Meccia E. Sterpetti P. Parolini I. Pelosi E.

Baumann M.A. Blood. 1995; 86: 3737-3744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of wild-type RARα or dominant-negative forms of RARα including PML-RARα blocks granulocytic differentiation at the promyelocytic stage (9Tsai S. Bartelmez S. Sitnicka E. Collins S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 10Du C. Redner R.L. Cooke M.P. Lavau C. Blood. 1999; 94: 793-802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that RARα may inhibit neutrophil differentiation when unbound and promote differentiation when bound to its specific ligand. In more than 95% of APL, the specific translocation t(15;17) produces the PML-RARα fusion proteins. Although most patients express the reciprocal RARα-PML protein, some do not, suggesting that RARα-PML may be dispensable for leukemogenesis. The association of histone deacetylases with PML-RARα has been described in APL cells (11Grignani F. De Matteis S. Nervi C. Tomassoni L. Gelmetti V. Cioce M. Fanelli M. Ruthardt M. Ferrara F.F.

Nature. 1998; 391: 811-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar), suggesting that PML-RARα may recruit a histone deacetylase complex leading to the repression of RA target genes critical to myeloid differentiation. It has been shown that the histone deacetylase complex dissociates from the PML-RARα fusion protein in the presence of pharmacological concentrations of RA, suggesting a mechanism by which APL cells are sensitive to RA treatment (11Grignani F.

Indeed, when treated with RA, these cells withdraw from the cell cycle and undergo terminal maturation both in vitro (14Breitman T.R. Collins S.J. Keene B.R. Blood. 1981; 57: 1000-1004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in vivo (15Warrell Jr., R.P. Frankel S.R. Miller Jr., W.H. Scheinberg D.A. Itri L.M. Hittelman W.N. Vyas R. Andreeff M. Tafuri A.

This suggests a molecular mechanism by which RA-responsive genes critical to myeloid differentiation are repressed in leukemia cells and derepressed when these cells are treated with RA. A few PML-RARα target genes have been identified including (i) PRAM-1, a novel molecular adaptor of myeloid cells (18Moog-Lutz C. Peterson E.J. Lutz P.G. Eliason S. Cave-Riant F. Singer A.

Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), (iv) ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1-like (UBE1L), which mediates PML-RARα ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (21Kitareewan S. Pitha-Rowe I. Sekula D. Lowrey C.H. Nemeth M.J. Golub T.R. Freemantle S.J. Dmitrovsky E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3806-3811Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and (v) the CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBP) β and ϵ, which are myeloid transcription factors (22Duprez E. Wagner K. Koch H.

Investig. 1999; 103: 1399-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). C/EBPϵ is the only example of a gene that is up-regulated by RA in APL cells and dominantly repressed by PML-RARα and whose expression is required for the reactivation of the differentiation program. The ASB2 gene was isolated by applying a subtractive hybridization strategy to identify novel genes activated during RA-induced maturation of APL cells (24Moog-Lutz C. Cave-Riant F. Guibal F.C.

ASB2 is both a PML-RARα target and a RA-response gene (19Guibal F.C. Moog-Lutz C. Smolewski P. Di Gioia Y. Darzynkiewicz Z. Lutz P.G. Cayre Y.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 218-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Expression of the ASB2 protein in myeloid leukemia cells inhibits growth and promotes chromatin condensation, which are characteristics of commitment known as critical to differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells (19Guibal F.C.

The ASB2 gene encodes a protein harboring ankyrin repeats, a protein-protein interaction domain, and a BC motif located within a SOCS box. By interacting with the Elongin BC complex through the BC motif, several proteins containing a BC motif are able to assemble into an ECS (Elongin C-Cullin-SOCS box)-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that functions with the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme and an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme to ubiquitinate its specific partners (25Kile B.T.

These targets are then degraded by the proteasome machinery. The mammalian Elongin BC complex, which is a heterodimer composed of the Elongin B and Elongin C proteins, was initially identified as a positive regulator of RNA polymerase II elongation factor Elongin A (26Bradsher J.N. Jackson K.W. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25587-25593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Aso T. Lane W.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and subsequently as a component of the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor complex (28Duan D.R. Pause A. Burgess W.H.

Kaelin Jr., W.G. Science. 1995; 269: 1444-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Both Elongin A and VHL protein have been shown to bind to Elongin C via interaction with the highly conserved leucine residue at position 2 of the BC box (30Aso T. Haque D. Barstead R.J. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5557-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 31Stebbins C.E. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 284: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Elongin B binds to Elongin C and does not interact directly with the BC box. The Elongin BC complex functions as an adaptor that links the BC box-containing protein to cullin (Cul) 2 or 5, which in turn binds to the ring finger protein Rbx1 to reconstitute a multisubunit complex with ubiquitin ligase activity (32Kamura T.

Within this complex, the BC-box protein is also involved in the recruitment of specific targets, suggesting that BC-box proteins regulate turnover of proteins by targeting them for proteasomal degradation. Indeed, the VHL protein can be considered as the receptor subunit of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Consequently, the VHL-ubiquitination machinery controls the stability of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF1α by promoting its ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation (36Iwai K. Yamanaka K. Kamura T. Minato N. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Klausner R.D. Pause A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12436-12441Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 37Lisztwan J.

In an attempt to decipher the ASB2 mechanism of action, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen and identified Elongin B as specifically associated with ASB2. By interacting with the Elongin BC complex through the BC motif, ASB2 can assemble with the Cul5·Rbx1 module to reconstitute an active E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Cell Lines, Culture, and Differentiation—The COS-7 and HEK293 cell lines were grown in Petri dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). To inhibit de novo protein synthesis, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) was added to HEK293 cells 48 hours post-transfection. Cells were harvested after an additional incubation of 5, 10, and 24 h. NB4 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (PAA Laboratories), 2 mm glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Exponentially growing NB4 cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/ml 16 h before all-trans RA treatment (Sigma). Cell viability was estimated using standard trypan blue dye exclusion assay. Differentiation was assessed by (i) the percentage of cells with nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma) deposits and (ii) cell morphology under light microscopy on May-Grünwald-Giemsa-stained cytospin slides. Sf21 cells were cultured at 27 °C in Sf-900 II medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Plasmid Constructs—The ASB2 coding sequence was subcloned into (i) the pGBKT7 vector (Clontech), (ii) the pGST, a derivative of pGEX-3X (Amersham Biosciences), in-frame with the glutathione S-transferase (GST) sequence, (iii) pSG5-(Stratagene)- and pBacPAK8 (Clontech)-derived vectors to direct the expression of ASB2 fused to the FLAG epitope at its N terminus (pSG5FN-ASB2 and pBacPAK8FN-ASB2, respectively), and (iv) the pAT4 vector (39Lutz P. Rosa-Calatrava M. Kedinger C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5102-5109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to direct the expression of ASB2 tagged with the F domain of the human estrogen receptor at its N terminus. Deletion of the SOCS box (amino acids 545–587) was generated by PCR amplification. Construction of the ASB2LPCF-mutated vectors was achieved using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the mutated oligonucleotide sequence, as indicated in boldface, 5′-CTCCAAGACCTCCGGCTCACCTTTTCCGACTGCGGGTT-3′. The human Elongin B was subcloned into the pAT4 vector. The human Elongin C open reading frame was obtained by PCR amplification using bone marrow cDNA and subcloned into pSG5-derived vectors to direct the expression of Elongin C tagged with the hemagglutinin (HA) or the FLAG epitope at its N terminus. Human Ubc5 containing an N-terminal FLAG tag and a C-terminal His6, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Uba1 containing an N-terminal Myc tag and a C-terminal His6, and mammalian GST-ubiquitin expression vectors were as described (38Kamura T. Sato S. Iwai K. Czyzyk-Krzeska M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10430-10435Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by sequencing. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—A human bone marrow library was screened using the Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System-3 protocol (Clontech). Briefly, a Gal4-DNA binding domain fusion of ASB2 (pGBKT7-ASB2) was employed as bait in the screen carried out by mating AH109-MATα pre-transformed with pGBKT7-ASB2 to Y187-MATa library-pretransformed cells. The AH109 transformation was carried out by standard lithium acetate protocol, and the library was maintained in the Y187 strain according to manufacturer's recommendations. Recombinant pGBKT7-ASB2 clones were tested for protein expression by Western blotting (positive), autonomous lacZ reporter activation by the bait alone (negative), cell proliferation effects through the bait (negative), and mating efficiency with Y187-MATa and were constantly maintained under selection of the auxotrophy marker Trp–. Once AH109-MATα-pGBKT7-ASB2 was confirmed through the above protocol, mating of a sufficient large pool of these cells to the pre-transformed Y187-MATa library-carrying strain (titer, 5 × 107 colony-forming units/ml) was conducted according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Mating efficiency was determined in this case at 79%, with a total of 1.9 × 108 independent clones, thus covering the library (3.5 × 106 independent inserts) approximately 53 times. Mated cells were spread onto selective media (SD, Clontech) for Trp (bait), Leu (prey), His (reporter 1), Ala (reporter 2), and lacZ (reporter 3) (SD-HALTX). After plating, positive clones were collected from days 8–20 after plating and re-streaked on SD-HALTX, SD-LTX, and SD-LX plates for verification of growth phenotype. Clones confirmed through this secondary screening were amplified in SD-L media, selecting only for the “prey” library insert. Plasmid DNA was finally isolated for sequencing according to standard procedures. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins in Escherichia coli—Overnight starter cultures (20 ml) of E. coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene) transformed with pGST, pGST-ASB2, pGST-Elongin B, pGST-Elongin C, and pGEX4T-2-ubiquitin were inoculated into 500 ml of culture medium and grown at 30 °C to an optical density of about 0.6 at 600 nm. After isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction (0.5 mm, 2 h at 30 °C), bacteria were collected and sonicated in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 10 μm ZnCl2, 10% glycerol, 100 μg/ml lysozyme freshly supplemented with 0.1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and the protease inhibitor mixture for use with mammalian cell extracts (0.1%, Sigma). Uba1 and Ubc5 were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). After isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction (0.5 mm, 2 h at 30 °C), bacteria were collected and sonicated in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 100 μg/ml lysozyme, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture for use with mammalian cell extracts. Cellular extracts were clarified by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 45 min at 4 °C). To immobilize GST, GST-ASB2, GST-Elongin B, and GST-Elongin C proteins, 32 mg of extracts were incubated with 300 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2.5 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed 3 times with lysis buffer and resuspended in 300 μl of the same buffer. Uba1 and Ubc5 were purified by Ni2+-agarose chromatography as recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen). Uba1 and Ubc5 were eluted with 100 mm imidazole. GST-ubiquitin was purified by glutathione-Sepharose chromatography as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Purified Uba1, Ubc5, and GST-ubiquitin proteins were dialyzed against 40 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.9, 60 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 2 mm DTT. In Vitro Binding Assays—One μg of T7 promoter-fused cDNA was incubated according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine for 2 h at 30 °C. In vitro binding assays were performed using ∼1 μg of GST fusion proteins and 5 μl of translation products of a coupled in vitro transcription/translation of cDNAs for 30 min at room temperature. After several washes to remove unbound material in washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), proteins were recovered in Laemmli buffer, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and analyzed by Coomassie staining and autoradiography of dried gels. Alternatively, ASB2 and the Elongin BC complex were produced using a coupled in vitro transcription/translation reaction, and immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out with anti-ASB2 antibodies as described below. In Vivo Expression and Protein Extracts—COS-7 and HEK293 cells were transfected using calcium phosphate coprecipitation of the appropriate amount of DNA vectors adjusted to 14 μg per 9-cm Petri dish with pBluescript carrier DNA. Medium was changed after 16 h. After an additional 20-h culture, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (1×), collected, and resuspended in whole cell extract buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture for use with mammalian cell extracts). After 2 freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen, the resulting cell lysates were cleared by a 30-min 10,000 × g centrifugation at 4 °C. PLB-985 cells were transfected and selected with G418 as described (19Guibal F.C. Moog-Lutz C. Smolewski P. Di Gioia Y. Darzynkiewicz Z. Lutz P.G. Cayre Y.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 218-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Antibodies, Western Blots, Immunoprecipitations—The rabbit serum raised against ASB2 (1PNA) has been described previously (19Guibal F.C. Moog-Lutz C. Smolewski P. Di Gioia Y. Darzynkiewicz Z. Lutz P.G. Cayre Y.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 218-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG (2EL-1B11), anti-F (4ERb-2D7), anti-HA, and anti-GST (1D10) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Euromedex. Anti-herpes simplex virus tag was from Novagen. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. After blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, proteins were probed with the corresponding rabbit antiserum or mouse monoclonal antibodies. For detection of proteins, appropriate peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratories Research) were used with a standard chemiluminescence system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After one-step preclearing (30 min at 4 °C) with protein A-Sepharose fast flow (Amersham Biosciences), antibodies were added to the cell protein extract in a binding buffer adjusted to 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. After 2 h of incubation, immunocomplexes were recovered with protein A-Sepharose. After three washes with binding buffer, proteins were eluted in sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Expression of Recombinant Proteins in Sf21 Insect Cells—Recombinant baculoviruses encoding ASB2 and ASB2LPCF containing an N-terminal FLAG tag were generated with the BacPAK baculovirus expression system (Clontech). Baculoviruses encoding human Elongin B, human Elongin C containing an N-terminal herpes simplex virus tag, human Cul2 and Cul5 containing an N-terminal HA tag, and mouse Rbx1 containing an N-terminal Myc tag were as described (38Kamura T. Sato S. Iwai K. Czyzyk-Krzeska M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10430-10435Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Sf21 cells were coinfected with the recombinant baculoviruses indicated in the figure legends. 48 h after infection, cells were collected and lysed in ice-cold buffer containing 40 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Ubiquitination Assays—Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG or anti-ASB2 antibodies and protein A-Sepharose fast flow. After 3 washes with binding buffer and 2 washes with a buffer containing 40 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.9, 60 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 2 mm DTT, the beads were mixed with 500 ng of Uba1, 1.4 μg of Ubc5a, 2.5 μg of GST-ubiquitin in a 15-μl reaction containing 4 mm Hepes NaOH, pH 7.9, 6 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 1.5 mm ATP. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. Reaction products were fractionated by SDS/PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-GST or anti-ASB2 antibodies. ASB2 Bound to the Elongin BC Complex through Its BC Box—To identify binding partners for ASB2, a yeast two-hybrid screen was used with full-length ASB2 as bait together with a cDNA library from human bone marrow cells. One cDNA identified in this screen was found to encode Elongin B. The yeast strain AH109 was then transformed with Elongin B or the pACT2 empty plasmid together with the ASB2 bait plasmid and grown onto a selective media. As shown in Fig. 1A, Elongin B was found to associate specifically with ASB2 in yeast. Because Elongin B has not been shown to bind directly to BC box-containing proteins, interaction of ASB2 with Elongin B in yeast is likely to involve yeast Elongin C. To confirm the binding results from the yeast two-hybrid screen, we examined in vitro binding of Elongins B and C to ASB2. Affinity-purified GST, GST-ASB2, GST-Elongin C, and GST-Elongin B proteins expressed in E. coli were incubated with in vitro translated Elongin B and C proteins. As shown in Fig. 1B, GST-ASB2 did not bind Elongin B, whereas it bound Elongin C. Association between ASB2 and the Elongin BC complex was further assessed in coimmunoprecipitation experiments using a transcription/translation system. Both Elongins B and C coprecipitated with the wild-type ASB2 (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the ASB2ΔSOCS mutant lacking the entire SOCS box did not associate with the Elongin BC complex (Fig. 1D). To confirm that ASB2 was capable of interacting with Elongin BC complex in vivo and to determine whether ASB2 associated with the Elongin BC complex through the BC motif located between amino acids 547 and 557, COS-7 cells were transfected with constructs expressing epitope-tagged elongins or ASB2. As shown in Fig. 2B, the expressed wild-type ASB2 could be coprecipitated specifically with tagged Elongins B and C. The N-terminal region of the SOCS box of ASB2, which is highly conserved in human, mouse, and chicken, includes a consensus Elongin BC binding site or BC box (Fig. 2A). The association between ASB2 and the Elongin BC complex was strongly dependent on the presence of an intact BC box since mutation of conserved residues within this motif abolished the binding of the Elongin BC complex to ASB2 (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2ASB2 associated with the Elongin BC complex through the BC motif.A, alignments of BC boxes of Homo sapiens (hs), Mus musculus, (mm) and Gallus gallus (gg) ASB2 protein with the consensus sequence. Shaded regions represent residues identical to the consensus sequence. Point mutations within the BC box of ASB2 are indicated in bold (hsASB2LPCF). B, COS-7 cells were transfected in 10-cm dishes with 0.2 μg of the F-Elongin B expression vector, 2 μg of the expression vector HA-Elongin C, and 1 μg of the wild-type FLAG-ASB2 expression vector or 4 μg of the FLAG-ASB2LPCF expression vector as indicated. 100-μg aliquots of each protein extract were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-F or anti-HA antibodies. Immunoprecipitated proteins (IP) as well as a 10-μg aliquot of the protein extracts (input) were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed for ASB2, Elongin B, and Elongin C as indicated (Western blot).

https://openalex.org/W2023766647,"The inducible serotonergic 1C115-HT cell line expresses a defined set of serotonergic receptors of the 5-HT2B, 5-HT1B/D, and 5-HT2A subtypes, which sustain a regulation of serotonergic associated functions through G-protein-dependent signaling. 1C115-HT cells have been instrumental to assign a signaling function to the cellular prion protein PrPC. Here, we establish that antibody-mediated ligation of PrPC concomitant to agonist stimulation of 5-HT receptors modulates the couplings of all three serotonergic receptors present on 1C115-HT cells. Specific impacts of PrP antibodies were monitored depending on the receptor and pathway considered. PrPC ligation selectively cancels the 5-HT2A-PLC response, decreases the 5-HT1B/D negative coupling to adenylate cyclase, and potentiates the 5-HT2B-PLA2 coupling. As a result, PrPC ligation disturbs the functional interactions occurring between the signaling pathways of the three receptor subtypes. In 1C115-HT cells, antagonizing cross-talks arising from 5-HT2B and 5-HT2A receptors control the 5-HT1B/D function. PrPC ligation reinforces the negative regulation exerted by 5-HT2B on 5-HT1B/D receptors. On the other hand it abrogates the blocking action of 5-HT2A on the regulatory loop linking 5-HT1B/D receptors. We propose that the ligation of PrPC affects the potency or dynamics of G-protein activation by agonist-bound serotonergic receptors. Finally, the PrPC-dependent modulation of 5-HT receptor couplings is restricted to 1C115-HT cells expressing a complete serotonergic phenotype. It critically involves a PrPC-caveolin platform implemented on the neurites of 1C115-HT cells during differentiation. Our findings define PrPC as a modulator of 5-HT receptor coupling to G-proteins and thereby as a protagonist contributing to the homeostasis of serotonergic neurons.

Some aspects of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 1The abbreviations used are: 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine; DOI, (±)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane; GPCR, G-protein coupled receptor; PLC, phospholipase C; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphophate; NO, nitric oxide; NOS, NO synthase; PLA2, phospholipase A2; AA, arachidonic acid; PrPC, cellular prion protein; SERT, 5-HT transporter; 5-CT, 5-carboxamidotryptamine; d4, day 4; FScA, forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation.)homeostasis may relate to the plasticity of serotonergic neurons, which continually adapt their phenotype in response to 5-HT as well as to a variety of neuronal and non-neuronal factors (1Azmitia E.C. Neuropsychopharmacology. 1999; 21: 33S-45SCrossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In addition to releasing 5-HT, serotonergic neurons of the raphe nuclei contribute to the integration of 5-HT signals by expressing 5-HT receptors, including 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B/D, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2B subtypes (2Gaspar P. Cases O. Maroteaux L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 1002-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). These receptors most likely behave as autoreceptors modulating 5-HT-related cellular functions (3Hoyer D. Clarke D.E. Fozard J.R. Hartig P.R. Martin G.R. Mylecharane E.J. Saxena P.R. Humphrey P.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 157-203PubMed Google Scholar, 4Mouillet-Richard S. Mutel V. Loric S. Tournois C. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9186-9192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However it is unclear whether the same neurons or distinct subpopulations harbor these receptor subtypes. The complexity of serotonergic signaling networks is far from being solved. Indeed, the targets recruited by 5-HT receptor-mediated signals are poorly characterized. Besides, still little is known about cross-talks between signaling cascades coupled with a single 5-HT receptor subtype and/or between pathways related to distinct receptor subclasses. Taking advantage of the 1C11 murine neuroectodermal cell line, which is endowed with the capacity to undergo serotonergic differentiation upon appropriate induction (4Mouillet-Richard S. Mutel V. Loric S. Tournois C. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9186-9192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we previously underlined the existence of functional interactions between three 5-HT receptor subtypes (5Tournois C. Mutel V. Manivet P. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17498-17503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Within 4 days of treatment with dibutyryl cyclic AMP and cyclohexane carboxylic acid, nearly 100% of 1C11 neuroprogenitor cells are converted into 1C115-HT neuronal cells, which express a complete serotonergic phenotype including 5-HT metabolism, storage, and transport (4Mouillet-Richard S. Mutel V. Loric S. Tournois C. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9186-9192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This serotonergic differentiation program is accompanied by the selective and time-dependent onset of three serotonergic receptors. 1C115-HT cells become sensitive to external 5-HT at day 2 of differentiation with the induction of 5-HT1B/D (1500 GTI binding sites/cell) and 5-HT2B (2200 DOI binding sites/cell) receptors. At day 4, the repertoire of neurotransmitter receptors extends to 5-HT2A receptors (400 DOI binding sites/cell), which further contribute to the integration of 5-HT signals. In mature 1C115-HT cells, these autoreceptors take a critical part in the regulation of the intensities of 5-HT-related functions, namely synthesis, storage, and transport (4Mouillet-Richard S. Mutel V. Loric S. Tournois C. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9186-9192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All three receptors belong to the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) family (see Ref. 6Hoyer D. Hannon J.P. Martin G.R. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 2002; 71: 533-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar for review). Various cell systems and notably the 1C11 cell line have allowed several of their coupling mechanisms to be characterized. 5-HT1B/D receptors elicit their response through Gi-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase (6Hoyer D. Hannon J.P. Martin G.R. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 2002; 71: 533-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). 5-HT binding to either 5-HT2 subclass activates Gq protein and stimulates phospholipase C (PLCβ), thereby initiating a rapid release of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and a rise in intracellular calcium level (6Hoyer D. Hannon J.P. Martin G.R. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 2002; 71: 533-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). The 5-HT2B receptor is also coupled to the ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (7Launay J.M. Birraux G. Bondoux D. Callebert J. Choi D.S. Loric S. Maroteaux L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3141-3147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and cross-talks with tyrosine kinase pathways to promote cell proliferation (8Nebigil C.G. Launay J.M. Hickel P. Tournois C. Maroteaux L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2591-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In addition, the 5-HT2B receptor recruits both cellular and inducible nitric-oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) transduction pathways through a type I PDZ domain (9Manivet P. Mouillet-Richard S. Callebert J. Nebigil C.G. Maroteaux L. Hosoda S. Kellermann O. Launay J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9324-9331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Finally, a coupling of the 5-HT2B receptor to the phospholipase A2 (PLA2)/arachidonic acid (AA) pathway was evidenced in 1C115-HT cells and shown to sustain a negative regulation of the 5-HT1B/D receptor function at day 2 of 1C11 serotonergic differentiation (5Tournois C. Mutel V. Manivet P. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17498-17503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect exerted by 5-HT2B receptors on the 5-HT1B/D coupling to adenylate cyclase however is lifted in 1C115-HT day 4 cells by the concomitant activation of the 5-HT2A receptor. 5-HT2A receptors are also coupled with the PLA2 cascade. The signaling pathway through which 5-HT2A receptors counterbalance the antagonizing action of 5-HT2B receptors on the 5-HT1B/D receptor function, necessarily distinct from PLA2, is still unclear. Understanding how serotonergic neurons manage 5-HT-related inputs with respect to the diversity of other signals constitutes another important challenge. Recently, the 1C11 cell line allowed us to identify transduction pathways coupled with the cellular prion protein (PrPC). This protein is the normal counterpart of a pathogenic protein termed scrapie prion protein, which is involved in a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. PrPC is expressed in all cell types and is particularly represented at the surface of neurons to which it is anchored by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol moiety. Whatever the state of differentiation of 1C11 cells, PrPC is endogenously expressed at roughly similar levels (10Mouillet-Richard S. Laurendeau I. Vidaud M. Kellermann O. Laplanche J.L. Microbes Infect. 1999; 1: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, antibody-mediated ligation of PrPC, which is assumed to mimic the interaction with a yet to be identified ligand, induces NADPH oxidase-dependent reactive oxygen species production and activation of the extracellular regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), two members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family (11Schneider B. Mutel V. Pietri M. Ermonval M. Mouillet-Richard S. Kellermann O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13326-13331Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In cells harboring a fully differentiated phenotype exclusively, PrPC associates with the membrane protein caveolin and the tyrosine kinase Fyn within a signaling platform that governs the downstream effectors, i.e. reactive oxygen species and ERK1/2 (11Schneider B. Mutel V. Pietri M. Ermonval M. Mouillet-Richard S. Kellermann O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13326-13331Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 12Mouillet-Richard S. Ermonval M. Chebassier C. Laplanche J.L. Lehmann S. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. Science. 2000; 289: 1925-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). The implementation of the PrPC-caveolin-Fyn complex depends upon the expression of neuronal and neurotransmitter-associated functions. It may relate to the proper structural organization of the partners within subcellular microdomains. Noticeably, the PrPC-Fyn coupling occurs on the neurites of 1C11-derived neuronal progenies where bioaminergic receptors are most likely localized (13Kellermann O. Lafay-Chebassier C. Ermonval M. Lehmann S. Mouillet-Richard S. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 2002; 325: 9-15Google Scholar). We assume that the PrPC-dependent signaling activity may contribute to cell homeostasis and take part to the fine-tuning of neuronal and neurotransmitter-associated functions, notably in 1C115-HT fully differentiated serotonergic cells. In an attempt to shed some light on the mechanisms sustaining the homeostasis of serotonergic neurons, we took interest in relations between 5-HT-mediated pathways and PrPC. Our initial goal was to monitor in 1C115-HT serotonergic cells the functionality of 5-HT receptors under PrPC ligation. We show here that PrPC modulates the couplings and cross-talks of the 5-HT1B/D, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2B receptors in 1C115-HT serotonergic cells.

Experiments were performed using 1C115-HT cells or mouse LMTK– fibroblasts stably transfected with cDNA encoding the mouse 5-HT2A or 5-HT2B receptor. Determination of Phospholipase C Activity—Cells were washed twice with fresh serum-free medium and exposed to various agonists or antagonists of the 5-HT2 receptors family and in some experiments to PrP antibodies. After 10 min of incubation, cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped with a rubber policeman.

PrPC Ligation Modifies PLA2 and PLC (but Not NOS) Activities Coupled to 5-HT2 Receptors—To assess potential cross-talks between PrPC and the signaling pathways coupled with the 1C115-HT serotonergic receptors, we monitored the levels of various second messengers production in response to 5-HT receptor activation combined to antibody-mediated ligation of PrPC. A first set of experiments was centered on the two 5-HT2 subtypes, i.e. 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors. Treatment of 1C115-HT day 4 cells with 100 nm DOI, a selective 5-HT2-receptor agonist, stimulates PLC (18Kellermann O. Loric S. Maroteaux L. Launay J.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 1161-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), PLA2 (5Tournois C. Mutel V. Manivet P. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17498-17503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and NOS (9Manivet P. Mouillet-Richard S. Callebert J. Nebigil C.G. Maroteaux L. Hosoda S. Kellermann O. Launay J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9324-9331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) activities. When 1C115-HT d4 cells were incubated with anti-PrP antibodies (SAF61, SAF32, or BAR221) only, no PLC, PLA2, or NOS activation was obtained (Fig. 1, A–C). Now, upon simultaneous exposure to DOI and PrP antibodies, the level of NOS activity did not differ from that obtained in response to DOI alone (Fig. 1A). By contrast, as shown in Fig. 1B, PrPC ligation combined with the addition of DOI caused a significant 1.7-fold increase in PLA2 stimulation as compared with DOI treatment alone. PrPC ligation also had an impact on the DOI-induced PLC activation. Concomitant exposure of 1C115-HT d4 cells to DOI and PrP antibodies reduced by 3-fold the level of IP3 production triggered by the sole addition of 100 nm DOI, thereby remaining at the basal level (Fig. 1C). In all experiments, identical results could be obtained using three distinct antibodies against PrP (SAF61, SAF32, or BAR221). Of note, no effect could be recorded on the DOI-induced activation of NOS, PLA2, or PLC under simultaneous incubation of 1C115-HT d4 cells with irrelevant antibodies to the membranous serotonin transporter (SERT) used as a negative control (Fig. 1, A–C). These overall data argue against the occurrence of functional interactions between PrPC and the 5-HT2B receptor-NO pathway. In turn, they emphasize PrPC-dependent modulations of the PLC and PLA2 couplings associated to 5-HT2A and/or 5-HT2B receptors. PrPC Ligation Preferentially Enhances the Efficacy of PLA2 Coupling to the 5-HT2B Receptor—The effect of PrP ligation on 5-HT2 receptors-induced PLA2 activity was further investigated using SAF61 antibodies. In 1C115-HT day 4 cells, both 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors promote PLA2 activation and subsequent AA release (5Tournois C. Mutel V. Manivet P. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17498-17503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because DOI activates both 5-HT2 receptor subtypes, we selected a series of 5-HT2 agonists with distinct specificities toward the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B subtypes. The level of AA production monitored in 1C115-HT d4 cells under stimulation by a given agonist and concomitant PrP ligation was compared with the maximal response (Emax) elicited by the agonist alone. As shown in Fig. 1D, PrPC ligation had no significant effect on the PLA2 activity induced by treatment with 100 nm MK212, preferentially targeting 5-HT2A receptors. By contrast, a potentiative (1.5-fold) effect of PrPC was observed on the PLA2 response to 100 nm BW723C86, a selective agonist of 5-HT2B receptors (Fig. 1D, see also supplemental Fig. S1 for other anti-PrP antibodies). Concomitant PrPC ligation also strongly enhanced by 2.4-fold the efficacy of the PLA2 response to 100 nm 1-(m-chlorophenyl)-piperazine with preferential affinity for 5-HT2B over 5-HT2A receptors. These data show that the efficacy of PLA2 response associated to 5-HT2A receptors is not affected by PrPC ligation. They also indicate that the enhancing effect of PrPC on PLA2 activity relates to 5-HT2B receptors. To explore the functional relation between PrP and the 5-HT2B receptor, we investigated whether PrP ligation affects the binding properties of the 5-HT2B receptor. We selected a panel of agonists and antagonists that differentially bind to 5-HT2A or 5-HT2B receptors (14Porter R.H. Benwell K.R. Lamb H. Malcolm C.S. Allen N.H. Revell D.F. Adams D.R. Sheardown M.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 15Cussac D. Newman-Tancredi A. Quentric Y. Carpentier N. Poissonnet G. Parmentier J.G. Goldstein S.

J. Pharmacol. 2001; 414: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This set of drugs allows discriminating between both 5-HT2 receptor subtypes and more precisely specifies the 5-HT2B receptor. We determined the pharmacological profile of the 5-HT2B receptor in 1C115-HT day 4 cells by assessing the binding affinities to each drug, used as a competitor of DOI binding. The binding of all drugs to 1C115-HT d4 cells was then followed under simultaneous incubation with antibodies to PrP. As shown in Fig. 2A, the binding constants of the drugs to 1C115-HT cells exposed to PrP antibodies (SAF61) did not significantly differ from those monitored without PrP ligation. In view of the exclusive specificity of this set of drugs toward the 5-HT2B receptor, we conclude that PrP antibodies have no impact on the binding properties of the 5-HT2B receptor. In another set of experiments, we evaluated the effect of the same panel of drugs on PLA2 activity in 1C115-HT d4 cells. In the case of agonists, the pEC50 values were deduced from the dose-response curves. As for antagonists, their capacities to inhibit the DOI-dependent stimulation of PLA2 activity were monitored to calculate pKB values. Comparison between the binding constants of the drugs (pKi) and the apparent equilibrium constants deduced from their effects on PLA2 activity (pEC50 or pKB) yield a correlation ratio of 0.787 (n = 19, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2B). The dose effect of the drugs on PLA2 activity was then monitored in 1C115-HT day 4 cells submitted to concomitant PrPC ligation using SAF61 antibodies. The pEC50 and pKB values thus obtained were plotted against the pKi values of the drugs determined in 1C115-HT cells exposed to PrP antibodies (Fig. 2C). A highly significant ratio (0.957, n = 19, p < 0.0001) was found between the effects of the agonists and antagonists on PLA2 activity and their binding. This correlation was over one order of magnitude higher than that obtained without PrP antibodies. Because the set of selected drugs specifies the 5-HT2B receptor (14Porter R.H. Benwell K.R. Lamb H.

Coldwell M.C. Smart D. Middlemiss D.N. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 414: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), this comparative analysis directly demonstrates that PrPC ligation enhances the coupling potency (EC50) of 5-HT2B receptors to the PLA2 pathway. PrPC Ligation Abrogates the 5-HT2A Receptor-dependent PLC Coupling in 1C115-HT D4 Cells—To further characterize the negative impact of PrPC ligation on the DOI-induced PLC activation, we first sought to evaluate the relative contribution of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors to the DOI-dependent IP3 production in 1C115-HT day 4 cells. In contrast to the 5-HT2A receptor, a functional coupling of the 5-HT2B receptor to PLCβ has never been evidenced in vivo (21Cox D.A. Cohen M.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 272: 143-150PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ellis E.S. Byrne C. Murphy O.E. Tilford N.S. Baxter G.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, we described previously a 5-HT2B receptor-dependent IP3 accumulation both in LMTK cells stably transfected with a cDNA encoding this receptor or in 1C115-HT cells at day 2 of serotonergic differentiation when 5-HT2A receptors are not yet present (9Manivet P. Mouillet-Richard S. Callebert J. Nebigil C.G. Maroteaux L. Hosoda S. Kellermann O. Launay J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9324-9331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 18Kellermann O. Loric S. Maroteaux L. Launay J.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 1161-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As already mentioned in Fig. 1C, the addition of 100 nm DOI on 1C115-HT d4 cells promoted a rapid IP3 accumulation reaching a plateau at 15 min with a level of maximal response (Emax) corresponding to a 4-fold increase as compared with the basal level of IP3 production. When the cells were simultaneously exposed to 100 nm DOI and to 100 nm MDL100.907, a selective antagonist of 5-HT2A receptors, IP3 accumulation remained at the basal level (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3A, treatment of 1C115-HT d4 cells by 100 nm BW723C86, which specifically activates 5-HT2B receptors, did not induce any PLCβ activation either (32 ± 2.5% of the DOI reference level, not significantly different from 26 ± 3.7% corresponding to the basal level). These data indicate that the PLCβ stimulation monitored in 1C115-HT d4 cells in response to 100 nm DOI (Fig. 3A) depends on 5-HT2A receptors only. They also emphasize that between day 2 and day 4 of the serotonergic differentiation program of 1C115-HT cells 5-HT2B receptors lose their ability to recruit the PLCβ/IP3 pathway. As shown in Fig. 3A, IP3 accumulation in 1C115-HT d4 cells remained at a basal level under simultaneous exposure to PrP antibodies and to 100 nm DOI. Again, similar impacts on the DOI-induced IP3 release were recorded using three distinct anti-PrP antibodies (SAF61, SA"

Analysis of SRF-LacZ “knock-in” mice showed highly restricted expression in early embryonic cardiac and skeletal muscle mesoderm and neuroectoderm. Examination of the SRF gene for regulatory regions by linking the promoter and 5′-flanking sequences, up to 5.5 kb, failed to target LacZ transgene activity to the heart and the tail pre-somitic mesenchyme. However, linkage of a minimal SRF promoter with the SRF 3′-untranslated region (UTR), inundated with multimeric T-box binding sites (TBEs), restored robust reporter gene activity to embryonic heart and tail. Finer dissection of the 3′-UTR to a small cluster of TBEs also stimulated transgene activity in the cardiac forming region and the tail, however, when the TBEs contained within these DNA sequences were mutated, preventing Tbx binding, transgene activity was lost. Tbx2, Tbx5, and the cardiac-enriched MYST family histone acetyltransferase TIP60, were observed to be mutual interactive cofactors through the TIP60 zinc finger and the T-box of the Tbx factors. In SRF-null ES cells, TIP60, Tbx2, and Tbx5 were sufficient to stimulate co-transfected SRF reporter activity, however this activity required the presence of the SRF 3′-UTR. SRF gene transactivation was blocked by two distinct TIP60 mutants, in which either the histone acetyltransferase domain was inactivated or the Zn finger-protein binding domain was excised. Our study supports the idea that SRF embryonic cardiac gene expression is dependent upon the SRF 3′-UTR enhancer, Tbx2, Tbx5, and TIP60 histone acetyltransferase activity.

During early development, a subset of pluripotent mesodermal cells becomes increasingly committed to the cardiac muscle lineage, through the combinatorial interactions of transcription factors, which result in the expression of cardiac-specific genes. Although this is a continuous developmental process, one transcription factor, serum response factor (SRF), 1The abbreviations used are: SRF, serum response factor; UTR, untranslated region; Tbx, T-box; UTR, untranslated region; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CMV, cytomegalovirus; GST, glutathione S-transferase; E, embryonic day; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; T, brachyury; ES cells, embryonic stem cells.1The abbreviations used are: SRF, serum response factor; UTR, untranslated region; Tbx, T-box; UTR, untranslated region; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CMV, cytomegalovirus; GST, glutathione S-transferase; E, embryonic day; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; T, brachyury; ES cells, embryonic stem cells. may play a leading role in the commitment of pre-cardiac cells. SRF is a 67-kDa DNA-binding protein that was first cloned from a HeLa cDNA library and was generally presumed to be a ubiquitous transcription factor (1Norman C. Runswick M. Pollock R. Treisman R. Cell. 1988; 55: 989-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). SRF binds DNA as a dimer and symmetrically contacts various serum response elements with a consensus sequence CC(A/T)6GG. SRF is member of the “MADS” box transcription factor family (2Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 3Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), and, despite their similarities, MADS box proteins have evolved to perform disparate important biological functions. Functions of MADS transcription factors include specification of mating type in yeast, homeotic activities in plants, pharyngeal muscle specification in Caenorhabditis elegans, pulmonary development in Drosophila, and elaboration of mesoderm structures in vertebrates (reviewed in Ref. 4Reecy J.M. Belaguli N.S. Schwartz R.J. Harvey R. Rosenthal R. Heart Development. Academic Press, New York, NY1999: 273-290Crossref Google Scholar). Recent homologous recombinant knock-out of the murine SRF gene locus supports the observation that SRF is absolutely required for the appearance of mesoderm during mouse gastrulation (5Arsenian S. Weinhold B. Oelgeschlager M. Ruther U. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6289-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar).Analysis of SRF null mice not only revealed a severe block to the activation of SRF-regulated immediate early genes, but it also showed inhibited expression of the cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle α-actins. These results indicate that SRF is an essential regulator of muscle-specific gene activity. Further, the regulatory regions of a number of muscle-specific genes, such as skeletal, cardiac (6Chen C.-Y. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell.

J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 577-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Mutations that prevent SRF binding severely impair the expression of c-fos, as well as these muscle-restricted promoters (12Belaguli N.S. Schildmeyer L.A. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18222-18231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data further support a role for SRF in muscle formation, a subset of mesoderm-derived cell populations. We therefore examined the expression pattern of SRF in the developing embryo and show that SRF is not ubiquitously expressed but is rather restricted to tissues of mesoderm and neuroectoderm origins. We show that staining of embryos generated from β-galactosidase “knock-in” mouse lines closely mirror actual SRF gene activity, as shown by strict correlation with in situ hybridization analysis.Although SRF is important for muscle formation in the developing embryo, the one or more mechanisms governing its expression remain elusive. The upstream promoter region of SRF contains binding sites for the cardiac transcription factors GATA, Nkx, and SRF (12Belaguli N.S. Schildmeyer L.A. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18222-18231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Because it has been shown for the cardiac α-actin promoter that these three factors can bind to DNA and synergistically activate gene transcription (8Sepulveda J.L. Vlahopoulos S. Iyer D. Belaguli N.S. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25775-25782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we asked if sequences in the SRF promoter region were sufficient to up-regulate expression of the β-galactosidase reporter gene in the cardiac regions of transgenic mice. We found that the promoter sequences containing the GATA, Nkx, and SRF binding sites were insufficient to drive expression in the developing heart, although skeletal and smooth muscle populations expressed SRF in these mice. Where then are the SRF genetic sequences that allow for cardiac expression?Tbx factors are potential candidates for directing SRF gene activity. One example comes from Eomesodermin, a T-box (Tbx) transcription factor expressed in the early mesoderm of Xenopus embryos (13Ryan K. Garrett N. Mitchell A. Gurdon J.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 989-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). When the T-domain of this factor is fused to an engrailed repressor domain, arrest of gastrulation results, similar to that of the SRF null mutant. Other examples show similar roles for T-box factors in the formation of the heart. The cardiac Tbx factor Tbx5 is known to physically interact with the cardiac factor Nkx2.5 (14Hiroi Y. Kudoh S. Monzen K. Ikeda Y. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Komuro I. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Mutation or ablation of Tbx5 from the embryo causes Holt-Oram syndrome, a condition characterized by defects in limb and heart development (15Basson C.T. Huang T. Lin R.C. Bachinsky D.R. Weremowicz S. Vaglio A. Bruzzone R. Quadrelli R. Lerone M. Romeo G. Silengo M. Pereira A. Krieger J. Mesquita S.F. Kamisago M. Morton C.C. Pierpont M.E. Muller C.W. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. Proc.

Genet. 2001; 10: 1983-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition, Tbx2, Tbx5, and SRF are co-expressed in overlapping patterns, indicative of mutual co-regulation. SRF transcripts were examined by in situ hybridization in Tbx5 “knock-out” mice, which display the Holt-Oram phenotype (16Bruneau B.G. Nemer G. Schmitt J.P. Charron F. Robitaille L. Caron S. Conner D.A. Gessler M. Nemer M. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Cell. 2001; 106: 709-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). SRF transcripts were reduced in the cardiac and tail regions of these mice, indicating that a loss of Tbx5 results in a reduction in cardiac SRF expression. Furthermore, the presence of a plethora of evolutionarily conserved consensus T-box DNA sequences (18Tada M. Smith J.C. Dev. Growth Differ. 2001; 43: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), many of which are located in the 3′-UTR of the SRF gene, influence the notion that SRF may be a downstream gene target of the Tbx factors.Our study demonstrates that SRF transgenes, containing a minimal promoter and multimeric Tbx-containing 3′-UTR sequences, are capable of inducing expression in heart and tail mesenchyme of the developing embryo. This inductive activity was lost when the T-box sites were mutated. In addition, it has recently been shown that TIP60, a founding member of the MYST family of histone acetyltransferases, appears in the embryonic chick myocardium and physically interacts with SRF (19Lough J. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 223: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although the function of TIP60 in the context of the early heart is unknown, we imagine that TIP60 may participate in the transcriptional regulation of early myocardial genes. Co-transfection assays done in SRF-/- murine ES cells indeed indicated that Tbx2, in combination with Tbx5, can up-regulate SRF reporter activity, but only in the presence of the SRF 3′-UTR sequences and TIP60. Inactivation of the HAT domain in a TIP60 mutant or ablation of its zinc finger domain abrogated up-regulation of SRF gene activity. Our study indicates that cardiac expression of SRF is achieved through the combination of Tbx factors and a MYST histone acetyltransferase via a T-box-rich enhancer region in the 3′-UTR of the gene.MATERIALS AND METHODSTargeting Strategy and Generation of NLS-β-galactosidase Recombination into the SRF Genomic Locus—SRF genomic DNA used for targeting was isolated from the isogenic strain 129λ library (12Belaguli N.S. Schildmeyer L.A. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18222-18231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A cassette containing nuclear localization signal-β-galactosidase cloned upstream of neo selectable marker was inserted between the NotI site located upstream of the SRF ATG and the BglII site located within the second exon. The cassette was designed with the pGKneo reading frame in an opposite orientation to that of the endogenous SRF allele. Insertion of this cassette deleted both the DNA binding and dimerization domains of SRF. The targeting vector contained 2.4 kb and 6.7 kb of homologous sequences on 5′ and 3′ regions of the cassette, respectively. SalI-linearized targeting vector was electroporated into AB2.2 ES cells and selected in 200 μg/ml G418 for 10 days. Genomic DNA from 100 clones was analyzed by Southern blotting after cutting the DNA with BamHI (for the 3′-end external probe) and HindIII (for 5′-end internal probe). Two correctly targeted clones were used to generate chimeras.Generation, Collection, and Identification of Transgenic Embryos—Constructs for the generation of LacZ transgenic mice were generated by restriction endonuclease digestion of vector sequences using the following enzymes: HindIII/NotI (5.5 kb), ScaI/NotI (3.5 kb), XhoI/NotI (1.0 kb), EcoNI/NotI (0.541 kb), XhoI/ScaI (1.0 kb plus UTR), EcoNI/ScaI (0.541 kb plus UTR), XhoI/BsrGI (1.0 kb plus UTR231M), and EcoNI/BsrGI (0.541 kb plus UTR231). Restriction endonuclease digestion was followed by size separation on agarose gels and purification with Qiaex beads (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). DNA fragments were then eluted with 0.1× Tris-EDTA and phenol/chloroform-purified. Transgenic embryos were produced by pro-nuclear injection of one-cell-stage embryos (20Behringer R.R. Crotty D.A. Tennyson V.M. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Wolgemuth D.J. Development. 1993; 117: 823-833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Embryos were harvested 7.5-10.5 days post coitus following transfer and stained for β-galactosidase activity (21Hogan B.L. Horsburgh G. Cohen J. Hetherington C.M. Fisher G. Lyon M.F. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1986; 97: 95-110PubMed Google Scholar). Paraffin-embedded embryos were sectioned (10 μm), de-waxed, and counterstained with nuclear fast red. Transgenic embryos were identified by PCR analysis of placental or embryo DNA with a combination of LacZ S/A primers: upstream, 5′-CTCAAACTGGCAGATGCACGGT-3′; downstream, 5′-CGTTGCACCACAGATGAAACGC-3′. PCR reactions were performed using 1 μg of DNA isolated from the amnion or embryo (20Behringer R.R. Crotty D.A. Tennyson V.M. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Wolgemuth D.J. Development. 1993; 117: 823-833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as template.Transient Transfection Assays—SRF-/- murine embryonic stem cells generated, as described by Du et al. (22Du K.L. Ip H.S. Li J. Chen M. Dandre F. Yu W. Lu M.M. Owens G.K. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2425-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), were maintained in ES medium supplemented with leukemia inhibitory factor to prevent differentiation. Cells were plated at 1 million cells per well in a 6-well dish and transfected 24 h later with DNA mixtures containing a total of 1 μg of total DNA, which included 250 ng of luciferase reporter vector and a total of 750 ng of pCG-derived vectors. Cells were transfected using Effectene reagent (Qiagen). Briefly, DNA solution levels were brought to a total volume of 150 μl with the Effectene kit (EC buffer). Next, 8 μl of enhancer was added to each sample, and these solutions were incubated for 5 min at room temperature. 25 μl of Effectene was then added to each sample, and after mixing these were incubated an additional 10 min. Following washing with phosphate-buffered saline, and application of 1 ml of ES medium/well, 1 ml of ES medium was added to each DNA sample, and this was added dropwise to the cells. Cells were then incubated for 16 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Medium was then changed, and cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 200 μl of Reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Cell lysates were scraped from the dishes and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were tested for luciferase activity using a Luminometer Mono-light 2010 (Analytic Luminescence Laboratory). 20 μl of cell extract was automatically mixed with 100 μl of luciferase substrate solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 4 mm MgSO4; 0.1 mm EDTA; 30 mm dithiothreitol; 0.5 mm ATP; 0.5 mm d-luciferin; 0.25 mm coenzyme A), and the emitted luminescence was measured for 10 s. Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) and used to normalize luciferase activities.Whole Mount in Situ Hybridization—Whole mount in situ hybridization of wild-type and Tbx5 mutant mouse embryos was performed as described previously (23Yamada M. Revelli J.P. Eichele G. Barron M. Schwartz R.J. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To examine the expression of SRF in these mice, an antisense probe was synthesized as described by Belaguli et al. (12Belaguli N.S. Schildmeyer L.A. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18222-18231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Sense probes showed no signal (data not shown).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Double-stranded oligonucleotides, corresponding to nucleotides 11,038-11,097 and 11,091-11,150 of the SRF gene sequence, as well as a consensus Tbx binding sequence (5′-CGGTGTGGCTAGCTAACACC-3′) as described by Gosh et al. (17Ghosh T. Packham E. Bonser A. Robinson T. Cross S. Brook D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1983-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) were synthesized and used for electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). Each reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 1 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), and purified bacterial proteins. Bacterial proteins were prepared in Epicurian coli BL21-Gold (DE3) cells (Stratagene). End-labeled probes (0.02 pmol; 10,000-20,000 cpm) and proteins were incubated for 15 min at room temperature. For competition assays, cold competitors were incubated with the proteins for 5 min prior to the addition of probe. The DNA-protein complexes were fractionated on 5% polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio, 29:1) in Tris borate-EDTA buffer as described by Belaguli et al. (12Belaguli N.S. Schildmeyer L.A. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18222-18231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The gels were dried and processed for autoradiography.TIP60 Mutants—TIP60 was amplified from reverse-transcribed mouse testis total RNA using primers complementary to the first and last nucleotides of TIP60 cDNA; the forward primer was 5′-GCGCGAATTCTATGGCGGAGGTGGGG-3′ (note underlined EcoRI site), and the reverse primer was 5′-GCGCGGATCCCAGCTCTCGTGGTATG-3′ (note underlined BamHI site). Following directional ligation into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of p3xFLAG-CMV-7.1, sequencing was performed in both directions to verify identity as TIP60 and to ensure the absence of PCR-generated mutations. The HAT motif of TIP60 in the above FLAG-tagged plasmid was inactivated by inserting two point mutations in the acetyl-CoA binding domain, Q377E and G380E, using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene 200518). The mutagenesis primers were: 5′-CTCTGCCTCCCTACGAGCGCCGGGAGTATGGCAAGCTGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCAGCTTGCCATACTCCCGGCGCTCGTAGGGAGGCAGG-3′ (reverse). These point mutations were previously shown to abolish the ability of TIP60 to acetylate histones (24Ikura T. Ogryzko V.V. Grigoriev M. Groisman R. Wang J. Horikoshi M. Scully R. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). The ΔZn TIP60 mutation was generated as a truncated protein, ablating the zinc finger domain (amino acids 261-283).Glutathione Pull-down Assays—GST fusion proteins were prepared by first sub-cloning coding sequences for Tbx5, SRF, or TIP60 (five individual domains and wild-type) into pGEX4T2. (PCR primers for TIP domains were: chromo-domain UP 5′-CGGGATCCGAGTGGCCCCTG-3′, DWN 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCATCACTTGGCCTC-3′; zinc finger UP 5′-CGGGATCCTACCTGTGCGAG-3′, DWN 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCATCAACACTTGGT-3′; exon 5 UP 5′-CGGGATCCCGGCTGGACCTA-3′; DWN 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCATCATGTGATCTG-3′; HAT UP 5′-CGGGATCCGTGGCCTGCATC-3′; DWN 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCATCAATAGCTGAA-3′; NRB box UP 5′-CGGGATCCGTGGATGGCCAT-3′, and DWN 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCATCACCATTCCC-3′). Proteins were expressed in Epicurian Coli BL21-Gold (DE3) (Stratagene), and bacteria were broken by French press. After pelletting debris, aliquots of the supernatants were taken to isolate GST fusions using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Binding proteins were synthesized in vitro (Tbx2, -3, and -5, SRF, and TIP60) using the TnT T7-coupled reticulate lysate system (Promega). Binding assays were done using 25 μl of Sepharose beads per sample, and GST fusions were bound to the beads at 4 °C for 3 h. Following this, samples were washed five times with binding buffer (BB) (100 mm NaCl, 40 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science)), and volumes were brought to 100 μl with BB. Next, in vitro proteins were bound (20 μl) at room temperature for 1 h. Samples were again washed five times, and were re-suspended into 20 μl of SDS sample buffer for analysis by SDS-PAGE via autoradiography to detect 35S-labeled in vitro proteins. No labeled protein was detected in control samples, which contained either the GST tag alone, or in vitro protein plus Sepharose beads (no GST or GST fusions; data not shown).RESULTSEarly Embryonic Expression of SRF Is Largely Restricted to Cardiac and Skeletal Muscle Tissues—In situ hybridization analysis of mouse embryos, using an SRF RNA probe, indicate that transcripts of SRF are somewhat diffuse early in development, with concentrated expression in the lateral plate mesoderm and primitive streak (Fig. 1A, E7.5). These areas are of significance to cardiac and skeletal muscle, because pre-cardiac mesoderm cells migrate through the streak to take up residence in the anterior lateral plate, whereas skeletal muscle originates in myotomes of the paraxial mesoderm. As development proceeds, SRF becomes robustly expressed in the cardiac crescent (Fig. 1B) and later in the heart tube and developing somites (Fig. 1, C and D, E8.5). These tissues continue to express high levels of SRF throughout development. Similar to chick embryos previously analyzed, SRF transcripts appear highly restricted to myogenic mesoderm and neuroectoderm (7Croissant J.D. Kim J.H. Eichele G. Goering L. Lough J. Prywes R. Schwartz R.J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 250-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 8Sepulveda J.L. Vlahopoulos S. Iyer D. Belaguli N.S. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25775-25782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Both in chick and mouse embryos, SRF is enriched in the cardiac crescent (and later the heart tube), somites, and the tail region. The concentration of SRF in muscle precursors early in development suggests that SRF plays a specific role in muscle specification and differentiation.SRF β-Galactosidase “Knock-in” Reporter Mice Faithfully Reproduce the Endogenous SRF Expression Pattern—We generated β-galactosidase reporter “knock-in” mice to analyze SRF gene activity during embryogenesis. The organization of the SRF gene and the knock-in cloning strategy used to disrupt the SRF genomic locus with a β-galactosidase-PGK neomycin cassette are shown schematically in Fig. 2A. Southern blots of mouse-tail DNA cut with HindIII and probed with the 5′ internal probe revealed expected sizes of 10.9 kb for wild-type SRF and 8.7 kb for the β-galactosidase knock-in allele in the heterozygous mutant (Fig. 2B). To determine whether expression of the β-galactosidase reporter gene would faithfully reproduce the expression of endogenous SRF, as seen in in situ analysis, we stained various stages of knock-in embryos for evaluation. As shown in Fig. 2C, embryos ranging from E7.5 to E9.5 show β-galactosidase staining predominantly in the cardiac crescent, and later in the heart tube, the somites, and the precondensed mesenchyme in the tail. This pattern is consistent with the endogenous gene. E10.5 embryos (Fig. 2D) continue the expression pattern of their younger counterparts, showing expression in the myocardium of the heart, the somites, and strong staining in the tail region (Fig. 2D, panels s and t). β-Galactosidase expression also extended to the smooth muscle of vessels (Fig. 2D, panel p) and the ventral portion of the neural tube (Fig. 2D, panel q). Thus, SRF transcriptional activity, shown by LacZ expression, reinforced the notion of restricted developmental expression of SRF and demonstrates that transcriptional expression of the reporter is consistent with the appearance of the endogenous gene.Fig. 2β-Galactosidase reporter gene knock-in into the SRF genomic locus reveals restrictive expression in embryonic cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle tissues. A, a simple map of the SRF gene locus organization of the knock-in vector with regions comprising coding exons shown as boxes. Filled and open boxes indicate the coding region and the 5- and 3-untranslated regions, respectively. The numbers below each box indicate the last nucleotide of the exon. The locations of the translational start codon (ATG), the stop codon (TGA), and the first and second polyadenylation signals (Poly(A)) are indicated. Introns and the flanking sequences are shown as thin lines. The bacterial β-galactosidase gene was inserted into the translation start site of SRF (Approximately 2 kb of homologous sequence was linked to the PGK-neo cassette (phospho-glycerate kinase) promoter driving neo in the opposite orientation to lacZ). B, a Southern blot of tail DNA derived from two wild-type controls and a β-galactosidase knock-in mouse line. HindIII digestion probed with a DNA fragment overlapping the core promoter revealed two hybridized bands of 10.9 kb, representing the wild-type control, and the foreshortened 8.7-kb band, representing the β-gal-Pgk-neo knock-in control. Panel C, SRF lacZ expression in E7.5-E9.5 mouse embryos. a, negative control (whole mount view); b-e and i, SRF knock-in expression in whole mouse embryos; f-h, and j, transverse sections through SRF β-galactosidase embryos shown in a-e and i.

The following embryonic tissues are marked: nt, neural tube; h, heart; ht, heart tube; so, somites; a, allintois; hf, head fold; t, tail; lb, limb bud; e, endocardium; m, myocardium; en, endothelium; cc, cardiac crescent; ys, yolk sac; v, blood vessel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Core Promoter and Contiguous 5′-Flanking Sequences Are Insufficient to Direct Cardiac Expression of SRF—Because the SRF core promoter was shown to contain binding sites for the cardiac transcription factors GATA4, Nkx2-5, and SRF, we asked whether these sequences and additional 5′-flanking sequences were sufficient to drive β-galactosidase activity in the heart, using transient transgenics of Fo embryos. Fig. 3A shows a schematic representation of the constructs used to test SRF promoter and 5′-flanking sequences, as well as a summary of the β-galactosidase staining in six different embryonic tissue types. The expression pattern in mice containing 5.5 kb of the SRF promoter and contiguous 5′-flanking sequences included the ventral neural tube and somites, but no staining was observed in the heart tube (Fig. 3B). The 3.5-kb flanking sequences yielded staining in the ventral neural tube and in somites (Fig. 3, C and D). Mice transfected with up to 1.0 kb of SRF contiguous sequence showed staining in the neural crest cells, particularly those in the outflow tract of the heart and pharyngeal arches, but not in the distal tail and the heart (Fig. 3, E-J). No β-galactosidase staining was observed in the embryo when 0.541 kb of the promoter was linked with LacZ (Fig. 3K). These resu"

Recent studies indicate that aggregated α-synuclein binds to S6′, a component of the 19 S subunit in the 26 S proteasome and inhibits 26 S proteasomal degradation, both ubiquitin-independent and ubiquitin-dependent. The IC50 of aggregated α-synuclein for inhibition of the 26 S ubiquitin-independent proteasomal activity is ∼1nm. α-Synuclein has two close homologues, termed β-synuclein and γ-synuclein. In the present study we compared the effects of the three synuclein homologues on proteasomal activity. The proteasome exists as a 26 S and a 20 S species, with the 26 S proteasome containing the 20 S core and 19 S cap. Monomeric α- and β-synucleins inhibited the 20 S and 26 S proteasomal activities only weakly, but monomeric γ-synuclein strongly inhibited ubiquitin-independent proteolysis. The IC50 of monomeric γ-synuclein for the 20 S proteolysis was 400 nm. In monomeric form, none of the three synuclein proteins inhibited 26 S ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal activity. Although β-synuclein had no direct effect on proteasomal activity, co-incubating monomeric β-synuclein with aggregated α-synuclein antagonized the inhibition of the 26 S ubiquitin-independent proteasome by aggregated α-synuclein when added before the aggregated α-synuclein. Co-incubating β-synuclein with γ-synuclein had no effect on the inhibition of the 20 S proteasome by monomeric γ-synuclein. Immunoprecipitation and pull-down experiments suggested that antagonism by β-synuclein resulted from binding to α-synuclein rather than binding to S6′. Pull-down experiments demonstrated that recombinant monomeric β-synuclein does not interact with the proteasomal subunit S6′, unlike α-synuclein, but β-synuclein does bind α-synuclein and competes with S6′ for binding to α-synuclein. Based on these data, we hypothesize that the α- and γ-synucleins regulate proteasomal function and that β-synuclein acts as a negative regulator of α-synuclein.

The pathology of Parkinson's disease (PD) 1The abbreviations used are: PD, Parkinson's disease; DHFR-U, fusion protein of E. coli dihydrofolate reductase, barnase, and an N-terminal degradation tag.1The abbreviations used are: PD, Parkinson's disease; DHFR-U, fusion protein of E. coli dihydrofolate reductase, barnase, and an N-terminal degradation tag. is characterized by a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the formation of intracellular inclusions, termed Lewy bodies. One of the primary components of Lewy bodies is α-synuclein, which is a small, abundant protein (1Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6469-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar). α-Synuclein is implicated in the pathophysiology of PD because it is the primary component of Lewy bodies and because three mutations in the α-synuclein protein, A30P, E46K, and A53T, have been linked to the development of familial PD (2Polymeropoulos M.H.

The pathophysiology of PD is incompletely understood, but increasing evidence suggests that proteasomal inhibition contributes significantly to the neurodegenerative process. The proteasome consists of a 20 S organelle that is a large proteolytic complex and is the core of each form of the proteasome core (5Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar). The 20 S proteasome is thought to degrade oxidized proteins but has also been shown recently to internally cleave α-synuclein (6Lam Y.A. Lawson T.G. Velayutham M. Zweier J.L. Pickart C.M. Nature. 2002; 416: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Both the 26 S ubiquitin-independent and 26 S ubiquitin-dependent proteasomes contain the 20 S core plus smaller caps on each end of the 20 S core that have sedimentation coefficients of 19 S. One of the functions of the 19 S cap is to recognize ubiquitinated proteins, which is mediated by a protein in the 19 S cap, termed S6′ (6Lam Y.A. Lawson T.G. Velayutham M. Zweier J.L. Pickart C.M. Nature. 2002; 416: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Aggregated proteins, such as those that accumulate as inclusion bodies in the brains of individuals with neurodegenerative disease, appear to potently inhibit proteasomal activity (7Bence N.F.

Polyglutamine repeat proteins, such as those that occur with Huntington's disease, appear to be particularly potent inhibitors of ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal function in cell culture (7Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). Our own work indicates that aggregated α-synuclein also inhibits proteasomal activity potently (8Snyder H. Mensah K. Theisler C. Lee J. Matouschek A. Wolozin B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11753-11759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). One mechanism through which α-synuclein binds the proteasome is via the proteasomal protein S6′ (8Snyder H. Mensah K. Theisler C. Lee J. Matouschek A. Wolozin B. J. Biol.

Both monomeric and aggregated α-synuclein interact with S6′, but aggregated α-synuclein is a much more potent inhibitor of 26 S proteasomal activity than monomeric α-synuclein. Aggregated α-synuclein inhibits 26 S proteasomal activity with an IC50 (<5 nm) that is >1000-fold lower than that of monomeric α-synuclein (16 μm) (8Snyder H. Mensah K. Theisler C. Lee J.

Other studies suggest that α-synuclein also inhibits the 20 S proteasome, although it also appears able to be cleaved by the 20 S proteasome (11Lindersson E. Beedholm R. Hojrup P. Moos T. Gai W.

The proteasomal hypothesis of neurodegeneration is supported by post-mortem studies showing that proteasomal activity is reduced in the substantia nigra from subjects who died with PD, although one study failed to detect changes in proteasomal activity in brain tissue from subjects who suffered from PD (13McNaught K.S.

Proteasomal inhibition in neurodegeneration might be enhanced by positive feedback, because drug-induced proteasomal inhibition increases the accumulation of aggregated α-synuclein (16Rideout H.J.

These studies highlight the potential importance of the proteasome in the pathophysiology of PD. α-Synuclein is part of a family of proteins that also includes β and γ-synuclein (19Uversky V.N. Li J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 11970-11978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). β-Synuclein is 78% homologous to α-synuclein, and γ-synuclein is 58% homologous to α-synuclein. Expression of α- and β-synuclein appears to be inversely regulated. β-Synuclein is the predominant RNA message expressed in the brain, although α-synuclein is the predominant protein expressed in the brain (20Rockenstein E. Hansen L.A. Mallory M. Trojanowski J.Q. Galasko D. Masliah E. Brain Res. 2001; 914: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A form of inverse regulation also occurs at the biochemical level, because β-synuclein inhibits the aggregation of α-synuclein in vitro and in vivo (19Uversky V.N. Li J. Souillac P. Millett I.S.

Alimova-Kost M.V. Paterson J.W.E. Delaney L. Cohen B.B. Imreh S. Gnuchev N.V. Davies A.M. Buchman V.L. Hum. Mol.

It stimulates the ligand-dependent transcriptional activity of estrogen receptor-α in cultured breast cancer cells, stimulates cell proliferation, and up-regulates matrix metalloproteases, which are enzymes implicated in tumorigenesis and neurodegeneration (24Jiang Y. Liu Y.E. Goldberg I.D. Shi Y.E. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4539-4546Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 25Surgucheva I.G. Sivak J.M. Fini M.E. Palazzo R.E. Surguchov A.P. Arch. Biochem.

Because of the homology of the three-synuclein proteins and the link between α-synuclein and the proteasome, we set to understand how α-, β-, and γ-synucleins interact with the proteasomal system. In this study, we examine the interactions of α-synuclein, β-synuclein, and γ-synuclein with the three different proteasome pathways and demonstrate differential regulation by the three synuclein proteins. We demonstrate that β-synuclein does not inhibit proteasomal function but does prevent aggregated α-synuclein from inhibiting the 26 S proteasome. In addition, we observed that γ-synuclein potently inhibits the 20 S proteasome but is not affected by β-synuclein. Cell Lines, Transfections, Chemicals, and Antibodies—HEK-293 cells were also grown in OPTIMEM (Cell Grow) plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Recombinant α-synuclein and β-synuclein was generated using wild type α-synuclein inserted into a ProEX-His6 plasmid (Invitrogen) as described previously (26Ostrerova-Golts N. Petrucelli L. Hardy J. Lee J. Farrer M. Wolozin B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6048-6054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Golts N. Snyder H. Frasier M. Theisler C. Choi P. Wolozin B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16116-16123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). γ-Synuclein was cloned into the XhoI and HindIII sites of the pTrcHisA vector (Invitrogen) and purified like α-synuclein and β-synuclein. Neurologically normal human cortical brain tissue (male, 72 years old, 8-h post mortem interval) was provided by the Loyola University Brain Tissue Bank directed by J. M. Lee. The antibodies used included monoclonal anti-α-synuclein (1:1000 immunoblot, 1:100 immunocytochemistry; Transduction Labs), monoclonal anti-S6′ (1:1000 immunoblot; Affiniti), and monoclonal anti-His (1:1000; Roche Applied Science). Pull-down Assays from Brain—Brain samples were pre-cleared with nickel-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C to eliminate nonspecific proteins binding to the nickel-agarose (Invitrogen). Samples were incubated overnight with 10 μg of recombinant monomeric α-, β-, or γ-synuclein (His-tagged). Following this overnight incubation, samples were incubated with nickel-agarose for 1 h to allow binding of the His-tagged protein and then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min. Samples were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton-X, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm proteasome inhibitor mixture (Sigma), pH 7.4) and run on 8–16% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Cambrex). Pull-down Assay from Purified 20 S—Purified 20 S proteasome (Biomol) was incubated overnight with 10 μg of recombinant protein. Samples were incubated with nickel-agarose for 1 h to allow binding of the His-tagged protein and then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min. Samples were washed 3 times with immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm proteasome inhibitor mixture (Sigma), pH 7.4) and run on 8–16% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Cambrex). Aggregation of α-Synuclein—Recombinant α-synuclein was aggregated by incubating samples for 1–2 months at 37 °C while rotating (5 mg/ml concentration in phosphate-buffered saline). Aggregation was confirmed by performing immunoblot analysis. Immunoblot Analysis—Samples were re-suspended in 2× or 4× dithiothreitol loading buffer, heated for 5 min at 90 °C, and run on 8–16% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Cambrex). Transfers to polyvinylidene difluoride (Bio-Rad) were done overnight at 4 °C and 150 mA for 12 h. Blots were washed once with Tris-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and then blocked with 5% milk (Carnation) in TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature while shaking. The primary antibody was added overnight in 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in TBS-T and incubated at 4 °C while shaking. Blots were then washed three times while shaking in TBS-T for 10 min per wash. A secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories) was added (1:5000) in 5% milk in TBS-T. Blots were washed three times while shaking in TBS-T and developed using a chemiluminescent reaction (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In Vitro 20 S Ubiquitin-independent Proteasomal Activity Assay— Increasing concentrations of the recombinant protein of interest were incubated with purified 20 S proteasome (human erythrocytes; Biomol) in a 20 S proteasome assay buffer (Biomol) for 10 min at 30 °C, and then a 75 μm fluorogenic substrate (succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; Biomol) was added. Lactacystin was used as an inhibitor control at 25 μm. Half-volume 96-well plates were used (Biomol). This substrate measures chymotryptic activity of the proteasome. Reactions were read immediately using a Gemini XS machine (Molecular Probes) to excite the solution at a wavelength of 380 nm, and the fluorescence emission was read at the wavelength of 460 nm. In Vitro 20/26 S Ubiquitin-independent Proteasomal Activity Assay—At increasing concentrations, the recombinant protein of interest was incubated with 75 μg of HEK-293 whole cell lysates, as determined by BCA Protein Assay (Pierce) in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) for 10 min at 30 °C. Half-volume 96-well plates were used (Biomol). We then added a fluorogenic substrate (succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; Biomol). Samples were excited at a wavelength of 380 nm and the emission was read at a wavelength of 460 nm and fluorescence was read using the Gemini XS machine (Molecular Probes). In Vitro 26 S Ubiquitin-dependent Proteasomal Activity Assay— These experiments were done by in vitro transcription and translation of substrate proteins using a T7 promoter in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) supplemented with [35S]methionine and then partially purified using high speed centrifugation and ammonium sulfate precipitation as described (28Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The protease substrate for C1P assays was derived from barnase, which is a ribonuclease from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens; the protease substrate for proteasomal assays was derived from Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) (28Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 29Matouschek A. Azem A. Ratliff K. Glick B.S. Schmid K. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6727-6736Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). An ubiquitin moiety was added to the N terminus of the substrate proteins via a four-amino acid linker from the E. coli lac repressor (28Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Substrate proteins were constructed in pGEM-3Zf (+) vectors (Promega) and verified by sequencing. The reaction was re-suspended in 40 μl of buffer (25% (v/v) glycerol, 25 mm MgCl2, and 0.25 m Tris/Cl, pH 7.4) to which 5 μl of the in vitro reaction containing the radiolabeled ubiquitinated substrate protein was added with 35 μl of a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Green Hectares) that was ATP-depleted as described (28Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The reactions were incubated with the recombinant protein of interest or with no protein as the negative control. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce). Initial cleavage of substrate proteins was enabled by a 7-min incubation at 37 °C. Ubiquitination and degradation were initiated by the addition of ATP and an ATP regenerating system (0.5 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.1 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase; final concentrations). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C at designated time points (15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min), small aliquots were removed and transferred to ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, and the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fractions were analyzed by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and quantified by electronic autoradiography. Monomeric α-Synuclein Mildly Inhibits the 20 S Proteasome, but γ-Synuclein Potently Inhibits the 20 S Proteasome—We began investigating how the different synucleins might modulate the activity of the 20 S proteasome. We examined the activity of 20 S proteasome in the presence of increasing concentrations of monomeric α-synuclein using synthetic fluorogenic peptides to monitor proteasomal activity. The purity of the monomeric α-synuclein was confirmed by immunoblot (Fig. 1B). Monomeric α-synuclein mildly inhibited the chymotryptic, 20 S ubiquitin-independent proteasomal activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). The IC50 for inhibition of the proteasome was ∼15 μm in these experiments, assuming that α-synuclein could achieve 100% maximal inhibition (Fig. 1A). This IC50 is similar to our previously published results demonstrating that monomeric α-synuclein inhibits the 20 S ubiquitin-independent proteasome with an IC50 of 16 μm. Our previous study also demonstrated that proteasomal inhibition by monomeric α-synuclein is not due to an interaction between α-synuclein and the fluorogenic substrate and is not sensitive to the concentration of a fluorogenic substrate (8Snyder H. Mensah K. Theisler C. Lee J. Matouschek A. Wolozin B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11753-11759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Next we examined the effect of β-synuclein on the 20 S ubiquitin-independent proteasome. We confirmed the purity of the β-synuclein by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1D). Increasing concentrations of recombinant β-synuclein were incubated with purified 20 S proteasome. A fluorogenic peptide was used that measures the chymotryptic proteasomal activity in an ubiquitin-independent manner. Increasing concentrations of β-synuclein had very little effect on the 20 S chymotryptic, ubiquitin-independent activity; we saw modest inhibition at all concentrations of β-synuclein (Fig. 1C). Two potential reasons might explain the low level inhibition of the 20 S proteasome in the presence of β-synuclein. 1) Modest inhibition might be due to an interaction of β-synuclein with the 20 S proteasome, although we detected no interaction with the 20 S α4, 20 S ζ, and 20 S α5 subunits of the 20 S proteasome. 2) β-Synuclein binds weakly to the 20 S proteasome as it cleaves β-synuclein (in addition to cleaving α-synuclein) (12Tofaris G.K. Layfield R. Spillantini M.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Recombinant γ-synuclein behaved differently than either α- or β-synuclein. The purity of the recombinant γ-synuclein protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1F). The activity of γ-synuclein on the 20 S proteasome was tested in the presence of increasing amounts of monomeric γ-synuclein using a synthetic fluorescent peptide to monitor chymotryptic proteasomal activity. γ-Synuclein potently inhibited the 20 S chymotryptic activity with an IC50 for inhibition of 400 nm (Fig. 1E). We confirmed that the inhibition seen by γ-synuclein was not due to the binding of γ-synuclein to the substrate by showing that γ-synuclein did not alter the substrate dependence (data not shown). This suggests that γ-synuclein inhibits 20 S proteasomal activity in vitro by binding to a component of the 20 S proteasome. Monomeric γ-Synuclein Potently Inhibits the 20/26 S Proteasome Mixture—Because the 26 S proteasome contains the 20 S organelle, we hypothesized that γ-synuclein would inhibit the 20/26 S proteasomal system present in HEK-293 cell lysates. Both β-synuclein and γ-synuclein were tested using the same methods described above. Recombinant β-synuclein protein was incubated with whole HEK-293 lysates, and proteasomal activity was measured by the adding the chymotryptic fluorogenic peptide. Monomeric β-synuclein had no effect on the 20/26 S ubiquitin-independent, chymotryptic proteasomal activity (Fig. 2A). However, monomeric γ-synuclein potently inhibited the 20/26 S ubiquitin-independent chymotryptic proteasomal activity with an IC50 of 600 nm (Fig. 2B). γ-Synuclein also inhibited the tryptic and peptidyl activities of the proteasome (Fig. 2C). The similarities between the IC50 of monomeric γ-synuclein on the 20 S proteasome alone (IC50 of 400 nm) and that of the 20/26 S proteasomal mixture suggests that inhibition of the 20/26 S proteasomal activity by γ-synuclein is primarily due to a direct action of γ-synuclein on the 20 S proteasome alone. Monomeric α-Synuclein, β-Synuclein, and γ-Synuclein Do Not Inhibit the 26 S Ubiquitin-dependent Pathway—We demonstrated previously that aggregated α-synuclein inhibits the 26 S ubiquitin-dependent pathway, unlike monomeric α-synuclein (8Snyder H. Mensah K. Theisler C. Lee J. Matouschek A. Wolozin B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11753-11759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Although β-synuclein and γ-synuclein do not aggregate as readily, we asked whether β-synuclein or γ-synuclein inhibit 26 S ubiquitin-dependent degradation. To investigate this question, we examined ubiquitin-mediated degradation of a fusion protein of E. coli dihydrofolate reductase, barnase, and an N-terminal degradation tag (DHFR-U) (28Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Prior studies demonstrate that ubiquitinated DHFR-U is degraded by the 26 S proteasome in reticulocyte lysates (28Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that aggregated α-synuclein inhibited 26 S ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, with a half-life of DHFR-U greatly increased (>100-fold, from 15 min to ≫180 min) in the presence of 500 nm aggregated α-synuclein as compared with basal conditions (8Snyder H. Mensah K. Theisler C. Lee J. Matouschek A. Wolozin B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11753-11759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). We used this same system to investigate whether monomeric β-synuclein and γ-synuclein inhibit ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation (Fig. 3). Degradation of ubiquitinated DHFR-U was examined in the presence of monomeric α-synuclein, β-synuclein, or γ-synuclein. The half-life of DHFR-U was 125 min under basal conditions as well as in the presence of 5 μm monomeric α-synuclein, β-synuclein, or γ-synuclein (Fig. 3). The absence of inhibition indicates that monomeric α-synuclein, β-synuclein, and γ-synuclein have no effect on 26 S ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. These data suggest that only aggregated α-synuclein can selectively inhibit the 26 S ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation pathway. β-Synuclein Antagonizes the Inhibition of the 26 S Proteasome Caused by Aggregated α-Synuclein—Because of the high degree of homology between α- and β-synuclein, we hypothesized that β-synuclein might interfere with the binding of aggregated α-synuclein to S6′. To investigate this question, we incubated recombinant β-synuclein with whole HEK-293 cell lysates for 10 min and then incubated reactions with the recombinant aggregated α-synuclein for 10 min. Fluorogenic substrate was added, and the fluorescence was immediately determined and quantified. We observed that the addition of β-synuclein largely blocked inhibition of the 26 S ubiquitin-independent proteasome by aggregated α-synuclein when added before the aggregated α-synuclein (Fig. 4A). The β-synuclein was unable to antagonize the proteasomal inhibition induced by aggregated α-synuclein when it was added after the α-synuclein, possibly because the short duration of the assay (10 min) did not allow for a thermodynamic equilibrium to be established. The antagonism by β-synuclein was not due to disaggregation of the α-synuclein, because co-incubation of β-synuclein with aggregated α-synuclein did not change the size of the aggregate, as judged by immunoblot (Fig. 4C). This suggests that β-synuclein functions as a negative regulator of α-synuclein. β-Synuclein Does Not Prevent the Inhibition of the 20 S Proteasome Caused by Monomeric γ-Synuclein—Because γ-synuclein is ∼50% homologous to β-synuclein, we also asked whether β-synuclein prevented the inhibition of the 20 S ubiquitin-independent proteasomal system by γ-synuclein. Using the same experimental setup as above, we incubated β-synuclein with purified 20 S human proteasomes prior to the addition of γ-synuclein. β-Synuclein did not prevent the inhibition caused by γ-synucle"

In a screening for multicopy suppressor genes of Congo red hypersensitivity of erd1Δ mutant, we found that a previously uncharacterized gene, YBR005w, makes most of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains resistant to Congo red. This gene was named RCR1 (resistance to Congo red 1). An rcr1Δ null mutant showed an increased sensitivity to Congo red. RCR1 encodes a novel ER membrane protein with a single transmembrane domain. Molecular dissection suggested that the transmembrane domain and a part of the C-terminal polypeptide are sufficient for the activity. We examined the effect of RCR1 in various null mutants of genes related to the cell wall. The resistance of mutants to Congo red correlates with a reduction of chitin content. Multicopy RCR1 caused a significant decrease in the chitin content while the amount of alkali-soluble glucan did not change. The binding of Calcofluor white to the cell wall significantly decreased in these cells. Our results show that RCR1 regulates the chitin deposition and add firm genetic and biochemical evidences that the primary target of Congo red is chitin in S. cerevisiae.

The fungal cell wall plays an important role in protecting the cell from various types of stress, including noxious chemicals and osmotic pressure. The cell wall of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is composed of β1,3- and β1,6-glucan, chitin, and mannoproteins (1Klis F.M. Mol P. Hellingwerf K. Brul S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 239-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). About half of the cell wall is made up of β1,3-glucan that has linkage with other polymers. β1,6-Glucan mainly links mannoproteins to β1,3-glucan. Chitin, a linear polymer of β1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine, constitutes only 2–3% of the cell wall but has a vital role in S. cerevisiae (2Shaw J.A. Mol P.C. Bowers B. Silverman S.J. Valdivieso M.H. Duran A. Cabib E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). These components are under a dynamic and highly regulated control by stress or cell cycle and have a complementary role in which a decrease in one component is immediately compensated by an increase in others. In a defective mutant of fks1 that encodes a β1,3-glucan synthase catalytic subunit, the content of glucan greatly reduces, but the amount of chitin increases instead. Similar change in cell wall components was found in a gas1 mutant that releases soluble glucan in the medium and accumulates chitin and mannoproteins (3Ram A.F. Kapteyn J.C. Montijn R.C. Caro L.H. Douwes J.E. Baginsky W. Mazur P. van den Ende H. Klis F.M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1418-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Popolo L. Gilardelli D. Bonfante P. Vai M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 463-469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant yeast cell that has an altered cell wall composition by the compensating system shows a different response to the external stress from the wild-type cell. A significant case is the sensitivity to K1 killer toxin or Calcofluor white. These compounds have a specific target in cell wall components and therefore have been used in the study of the cell wall. K1 killer toxin binds to its receptor, including β1,6-glucan, and forms fatal ion channels in the plasma membrane (5Martinac B. Zhu H. Kubalski A. Zhou X.L. Culbertson M. Bussey H. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6228-6232Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A number of genes concerned in the synthesis of β1,6-glucan have been identified by studying the killer toxin-resistant (kre) mutants (6Boone C. Sommer S.S. Hensel A. Bussey H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1833-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 7Brown J.L. Kossaczka Z. Jiang B. Bussey H. Genetics. 1993; 133: 837-849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Calcofluor white preferentially binds to polysaccharides containing β1,4-linked d-glucopyranosyl units (8Wood P.J. Carbohydr. Res. 1980; 85: 271-287Crossref Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In yeast, it binds to chitin and alters the assembly of its microfibrils (9Elorza M.V. Rico H. Sentandreu R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1983; 129: 1577-1582PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the sensitivity against this compound closely relates to the chitin content. Mutants with increased chitin, by compensating for the defect of other components such as fks1 or gas1, show higher sensitivity to Calcofluor white (10Ram A.F. Wolters A. Ten Hoopen R. Klis F.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1019-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 11Ram A.F. Brekelmans S.S. Oehlen L.J. Klis F.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). On the other hand, reduction in chitin content makes cells more resistant to Calcofluor white. The mutants chs3, which encodes a major chitin synthase, and chs4-chs7, which help in the proper localization or activation of Chs3, show higher resistance to Calcofluor white (12Trilla J.A. Duran A. Roncero C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1153-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 13Bulawa C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1764-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 14Jablonowski D. Fichtner L. Martin V.J. Klassen R. Meinhardt F. Stark M.J. Schaffrath R. Yeast. 2001; 18: 1285-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Similarly, overexpression of KNR4, which represses the chitin synthesis genes, makes the cell more resistant to Calcofluor white (15Martin H. Dagkessamanskaia A. Satchanska G. Dallies N. Francois J. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although the stilbene-type dye Calcofluor white has been extensively used in many cell wall mutant studies, another cell wall-perturbing agent, benzidine-type dye Congo red, has not been widely used in identifying cell wall mutants. One of the reasons is that the effect of Congo red on the cell wall in S. cerevisiae is somehow ambiguous. Because Congo red stimulates chitin synthesis in S. cerevisiae like Calcofluor white (16Roncero C. Duran A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1180-1185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), both compounds are thought to have similar effects on fungal cell wall. But it has also been known that Congo red binds to β1,3-glucan (17Ogawa K. Hatano M. Carbohydr. Res. 1978; 67: 527-535Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18Ogawa K. Tsurugi J. Watanabe T. Carbohydr. Res. 1973; 29: 397-403Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and interferes with the assembly of the β1,3-glucan filaments in S. cerevisiae (19Kopecka M. Gabriel M. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 158: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These effects would not be mutually exclusive, and the mechanism of growth inhibition by Congo red in S. cerevisiae remains somewhat unclear. Congo red as well as Calcofluor white binds to β1,4-linked d-glucopyranoside units, but the binding specificity to other polysaccharides, such as Curdlan, which mainly consists of β1,3-linked d-glucopyranoside units, was completely different from Calcofluor white (8Wood P.J. Carbohydr. Res. 1980; 85: 271-287Crossref Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect may be different among biological species. So far, there is little information on the relationship between the sensitivity to Congo red and the genes that are concerned in cell wall synthesis of S. cerevisiae. In this work, we report characterization of a previously uncharacterized gene RCR1 (resistance to Congo red 1) and firm evidence indicating that the primary target of Congo red in S. cerevisiae is chitin rather than glucan. Strains and Media—Escherichia coli K12 strain DH5α (F-, φ80lacZΔM15, supE44 ΔlacU169 hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1) was used in plasmid propagation, and Escherichia coli was grown in an LB (1% Bacto-Tryptone, 0.5% Bacto yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl) medium with or without 100 μg/ml ampicillin. S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Yeast was grown in YPD medium (1% yeast extract (BD Biosciences), 2% peptone (BD Biosciences), 2% glucose) and SD medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (BD Biosciences), 0.5% (NH4)2SO4, 2% glucose, and appropriate supplements) (20Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). Solid media were made with 2% agar.

RCR1 (systematic name YBR005w) was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using DNA polymerase Pyrobest (Takara). A BamHI site was placed at 219 bp upstream from the initiator methionine codon of RCR1, and a XhoI site was placed at 363 bp downstream from the stop codon (sense primer, 5′-CGGGATCCCGCCTCCTCTCTCGAAGC-3′; antisense primer, 5′-CCCTCGAGATCTATTGATCTCTGACGAGTA-3′). The PCR product was digested with BamHI and XhoI and ligated into pRS426 (21Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate pki72. To obtain the N-terminal myc epitope-tagged Rcr1 in yeast, the RCR1 open reading frame was amplified by PCR from pki72, placing a BamHI site at the start codon and SacI site at 363 bp downstream from the stop codon (sense primer, 5′-CGGGATCCATGGGACTTATTTCATACGAAAAT-3′; antisense primer, 5′-CGAGCTCATCTATTGATCTCTGACGAGTA-3′). The PCR product was digested with BamHI and SacI and ligated into pki80 (2μ, URA3, and a six myc-coding sequence) to generate pki94. The truncated Rcr1 constructs were made in the same way. The disruption plasmid pki106 (rcr1Δ::LEU2) was constructed by inserting the BamHI/PstI fragment obtained by PCR using the primers (sense primer, 5′-TGCACTGCAGAGGCATGGTAGATGCTATCG-3′; antisense primer, 5′-CGGGATCCTCCTTATTCTTAATTCGAGTTATA-3′) and the PstI/XhoI fragment obtained by PCR using the primers (sense primer, 5′-TGCACTGCAGATCTATTGATCTCTGACGAGTA-3′; antisense primer, 5′-CCCTCGAGACTGAATCTTTTTTTCCGGCTG-3′) in the BamHI/PstI and PstI/XhoI sites of pRS305, respectively. In this way, RCR1 was replaced by LEU2. Schemes for the other construction of the plasmids and the sequence of PCR primers are available upon request.Table IIPlasmids used in this studyPlasmidCharacteristicsReference/sourcepRS305LEU2Sikorski and Hieter (21Sikorski R.S.

Pelham H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2667-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Log-phase cells grown at 30 °C were fixed by adding 2.5 ml of fresh 10% paraformaldehyde to 7.5 ml of yeast culture and pelleted by centrifugation. They were resuspended in 3.2 ml of PP (0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.5), 1.8 ml of paraformaldehyde solution was added, and fixation was continued for an additional 15 min. Cells were then washed four times in PP and resuspended in 1 ml of SPP (PP with 1.2 m sorbitol) containing 100 mm dithiothreitol. 10 μl of lyticase was added, and incubation was continued at 30 °C. The spheroplasts were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mm NH4Cl in SPP, and then in SPP before being transferred to polylysine-coated slides. The slides were immersed in methanol for 6 min and acetone for 30 s, both at -20 °C, and then air dried. Anti-myc mouse monoclonal antibody (9E10, Berkeley Antibody) and anti-Kar2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (a kind gift of Dr. Masao Tokunaga) were diluted to 1/40, 1/100 each in 1% skim milk, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline, and incubations were carried out overnight at 4 °C. Slides were washed and incubated in the secondary antibodies (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat antibody to mouse immunoglobulin G and Texas Red-conjugated goat antibody to rabbit immunoglobulin G) for 2 h at room temperature, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and mounted as described by Kilmartin and Adams (23Kilmartin J.V. Adams A.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 922-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Images were obtained using an FV500 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Biochemical Analyses—For preparation of yeast lysate, cells grown to log phase were harvested, washed, and resuspended in sorbitol buffer (1 m sorbitol, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 85 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Cells were converted to spheroplasts with lyticase (49Shen S.H. Chietien P. Bastien L. Slilaty S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1058-1063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and homogenized in B88 (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 200 mm sorbitol, pH 6.8) with protease inhibitors mixture (5 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, 2 μm pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Wako Chemicals). Lysate was obtained after clearing centrifugation at 300 × g to remove unbroken cells. For subcellular fractionation, the cleared lysate was sequentially centrifuged to generate 10,000 × g pellet (P10), 100,000 × g pellet (P100), and 100,000 × g supernatant (S100) fractions. For solubilization, the lysate was treated on ice for 10 min with lysis buffer and lysis buffer containing either 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 m Na2CO3 (pH 11), or 2 m urea. Then a portion of the mixture was taken as the total fraction (T), and the remaining mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g and separated to the pellet (P) and the supernatant (S) fractions. Analyses of invertase, chitinase, and Gas1 protein were done as described in Hashimoto et al. (24Hashimoto H. Sakakibara A. Yamasaki M. Yoda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16308-16314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and Gentzsch and Tanner (25Gentzsch M. Tanner W. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Protease Protection Assay—The KA31–1A spheroplasts harboring multicopy 6myc-RCR1 were prepared using lyticase in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol. Protease protection assays were performed as described previously (26Abeliovich H. Grote E. Novick P. Ferro-Novick S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11719-11727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 27Romano J.D. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1957-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), with the use of proteinase K (Roche Applied Science). Spheroplasts (10 optical density unit equivalents) were incubated with SPP, including combinations of proteinase K and/or 1% Triton X-100 for 5 min on ice. Reactions were terminated by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 1 mm. Bovine serum albumin was added as carrier (final concentration, 62.5 μg/ml) before proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting for 6myc-Rcr1 or Kar2. Immunological Analyses—Immunoprecipitation was done as described previously (28Abe M. Noda Y. Adachi H. Yoda K. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Western blots were probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Kar2 or Gos1 and mouse monoclonal antibody against myc (9E10), HA 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. (12CA5), or Pep12 (2C3-G4), followed by incubation with peroxidase-labeled goat antibody to rabbit IgG(H+L) and mouse IgG(H+L) (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD), respectively. Signals were detected by using a chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate, Pierce) and Lumino-image analyzer (LAS-1000plus, Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). Quantitative β1,3-Glucan Measurement—Amount of β1,3-glucan per cell was measured using aniline blue as described previously (29Sekiya-Kawasaki M. Abe M. Saka A. Watanabe D. Kono K.

Biochem. 1997; 249: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) with some modification. In brief, cells were grown to A600 = 0.5 ∼ 0.8 and 2.5 × 106 cells were harvested. The cells were washed twice with TE (10 mm Tris·Cl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and resuspended in 250 μl of TE. To the cells 6 n NaOH was added to a final concentration of 1 n, incubated at 80 °C for 30 min followed by an addition of 1.05 ml of AB mix (0.03% aniline blue (Wako), 0.18 n HCl, and 0.49 n glysine/NaOH, pH 9.5). The tube was vortexed briefly, then incubated at 50 °C for 30 min. Fluorescence of β-1,3-glucan was quantified using a spectrofluorometer (F-2500, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The excitation wavelength was 400 nm, and the emission wavelength was 460 nm. Measurement of Chitin Content—Total cellular chitin was measured as described by Bulawa et al. (31Bulawa C.E. Slater M. Cabib E. Au-Young J. Sburlati A. Adair Jr., W.L. Robbins P.W. Cell. 1986; 46: 213-225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and outlined by Ketela et al. (32Ketela T. Green R. Bussey H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3330-3340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modification. In brief, washed cells (∼65–100 mg wet cells) were resuspended in 1 ml of 6% KOH and incubated at 80 °C for 90 min. After cooling at room temperature, 100 μl of glacial acetic acid was added. Insoluble material was washed twice with water and resuspended in 450 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.3) containing 0.2 unit of Serratia marcescens chitinase (Sigma) and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. After centrifugation, 400 μl of supernatant was incubated with 0.25 mg of Helix pomatia β-glucuronidase (Sigma) at 37 °C for 1 h, and then an aliquot of the mixture was assayed for N-acetylglucosamine content according to Reissig et al. (33Reissig J.L. Storminger J.L. Leloir L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 959-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calcofluor White Staining—Calcofluor white staining was performed as described previously (34Pringle J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) with some modification. Briefly, log-phase cells grown at 30 °C were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.1 mg/ml Calcofluor white for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and mounted on a slide in mounting medium (1 mg/ml p-phenylenediamine, phosphate-buffered saline, pH 9.0, 90% glycerol). Images were obtained using AX-80 microscope (Olympus). Identification of RCR1/YBR005w as a Multicopy Suppressor Gene of Congo Red Hypersensitivity of erd1Δ Mutant—ERD1 was previously found as a gene required for retention of the ER lumen proteins (35Pelham H.R. Hardwick K.G. Lewis M.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1757-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and its mutants show temperature-sensitive growth in YPD medium, Geneticin hypersensitivity, 2K. Imai, Y. Noda, H. Adachi, and K. Yoda, unpublished data. and glycosylation defect (36Hardwick K.G. Lewis M.J. Semenza J. Dean N. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We found that the erd1Δ mutant also shows hypersensitivity to Congo red and conducted a screening for multicopy suppressors that confer this to elucidate the function of the Erd1 protein. S. cerevisiae YKI59 (erd1Δ) was transformed with a multicopy library YNYL2 (URA3, 2μ). 82 out of 1,200,000 transformants formed colonies on SD medium containing 100 μg/ml Congo red. Seventy-six of them had ERD1. By sequencing and subcloning of the remaining six plasmids, we found that a previously uncharacterized open reading frame, YBR005w, was responsible for colony formation of YKI59 transformants on the SD plus Congo red medium (Fig. 1A). We named this gene RCR1 (resistance to Congo red 1). On the other hand, the other phenotype of erd1Δ, including the temperature sensitivity, glycosylation defect, and hypersensitivity to Geneticin, did not recover in the RCR1 transformant. Fig. 1B shows that no difference was found in N-glycosylation of invertase, O-glycosylation of chitinase, and maturation of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored Gas1 protein. Furthermore, the Congo red resistance was not restricted in the erd1Δ mutant, and introduction of the multicopy RCR1 made the wild-type and various mutant yeast strains more resistant to the growth inhibitory action of Congo red (Fig. 1C). Introduction of the multicopy RCR1 also made these strains more resistant to Calcofluor white (Fig. 1D). Phenotypes of the rcr1Δ Null Mutant—Firstly, we examined the phenotype caused by an rcr1Δ null allele, because cells become significantly resistant to Congo red by the introduction of RCR1 in a CEN plasmid (data not shown). A heterologous diploid with RCR1/rcr1Δ was constructed from BY4743 and spores were dissected into tetrads. Sensitivity to SDS and growth at 37 °C were the same in the RCR1 and rcr1Δ haploid progenies. But the rcr1Δ progenies showed a higher sensitivity to 50 μg/ml Congo red or 40 μg/ml Calcofluor white in SD medium than the RCR1 progenies (Fig. 2A). The medium condition is important in determining the sensitivity, because all progenies grew similarly in YPD medium containing these compounds. Characterization of RCR1—RCR1 encodes a polypeptide of 213 amino acids with a calculated mass of 23.9 kDa. Another open reading frame YDR003w encoding a polypeptide of 210 amino acids has a sequence identity of 46% with Rcr1. We named this gene RCR2 (Fig. 3A). However, the multicopy RCR2 did not have an activity to confer Congo red resistance in any strain tested so far. The rcr2Δ null mutant did not show increased sensitivity to Congo red or Calcofluor white, and the rcr1Δ rcr2Δ double disruptant showed similar sensitivity to these dyes as the rcr1Δ single null mutant (Fig. 2A). These null alleles had no effect on glycosylation of invertase (Fig. 2B) and maturation of Gas1 protein (Fig. 2C). Therefore, it is unlikely that RCR1 and RCR2 have an essential redundant role in S. cerevisiae. The hydropathy plot suggests that Rcr1 and Rcr2 are integral membrane proteins with a single transmembrane domain (Fig. 3B) and the TMHMM program (available at www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/) predicts that amino acids 40–62 of Rcr1 form an α-helix that spans the membrane. It is noticeable that this transmembrane segment has an adjacent arginine-rich stretch (amino acids 64–71). The PEST find program (available at www.at.embnet.org/embnet/tools/bio/PESTfind/9) suggests that amino acids 99–114 is a region with a high PEST score (+6.84). The PEST regions are thought to endow several proteins with sensitivity to ubiquitination or proteasomal digestion. Localization of Rcr1 Protein—To make it clear that Rcr1 localizes in the membrane, we have first done a fractionation analysis. A 6myc epitope was added at the N terminus of Rcr1 for immunological detection, and the 6myc-Rcr1 protein was produced under the control of the SED5 promoter (pki94). By introduction of pki94, the yeast cells acquired a similar resistance to Congo red as the authentic RCR1 gene. The 6myc-Rcr1 protein migrated in SDS-PAGE to the position corresponding to a protein of 54 kDa, although its calculated molecular mass is about 34 kDa (data not shown). The spheroplasts of wild-type yeast having pki94 were lysed, and the lysate was subjected to 100,000 × g centrifugation. 6myc-Rcr1 was exclusively recovered in the pellet and not solubilized by treating with 0.1 m Na2CO3 or 2 m urea (Fig. 4A), but it was solubilized by 1% Triton X-100. These results indicate that Rcr1 is a typical integral membrane protein. Next, we examined the localization of Rcr1 by subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescent microscopy. A majority of 6myc-Rcr1 was recovered in P10 as well as the ER-marker protein Kar2, whereas a similar amount of the endosome-marker Pep12 or the Golgi-marker Gos1 was recovered equally in P10 and P100 (Fig. 4B). Immunofluorescent staining of myc epitope showed that 6myc-Rcr1 was present in a central ring and in peripheral ribbon-like structures beneath the cytoplasmic membrane. This immunological staining coincided well with that of the ER-marker Kar2 (Fig. 5). Topology of the Rcr1 Protein—To make a topological issue clear, the membrane fraction was treated with proteinase K and protection of the N-terminal 6myc tag was examined by immunoblotting. In the absence of a detergent, a 32-kDa remnant of 6myc-Rcr1 was detected suggesting that the C-terminal cytosolic region was digested (Fig. 6.). Kar2 protein in the lumen of the ER remained mostly intact. In the presence of a detergent, no myc signal was detected indicating the whole protein was digested and Kar2 became a smaller fragment that is intrinsically resistant to proteinase K digestion. When a tag was added to the C-terminal of Rcr1 to make Rcr1-6myc, no epitope signal was detected after proteinase digestion both in the presence and absence of detergent (data not shown). These results indicate that Rcr1 is a type I membrane protein with the N-terminal in the ER lumen and the C-terminal in the cytosol. Molecular Dissection of the Rcr1 Protein—To get clues to reveal the mechanism that makes the cell more resistant to Congo red, we dissected the Rcr1 molecule and sought to find which region is responsible for the activity. The truncated polypeptides at the N or C termini were produced by a multicopy plasmid under the SED5 promoter in an rcr1Δ strain of KA31 genetic background (Fig. 7A). A similar amount of polypeptide was produced because a similar intensity of myc signal at the N-terminal was detected in each construct by immunoblotting (data not shown). We found that the N-terminal luminal region is dispensable for Congo red resistance, because Rcr1 (amino acids 40–213) is active (Fig. 7B). The transmembrane domain is required for the activity, because Rcr1 (amino acids 63–213) and Rcr1 (amino acids 69–213) were inactive. A C-terminal region that has a low sequence similarity between Rcr1 and Rcr2 could be removed with a little decrease of activity and Rcr1 (amino acids 1–160) still had a significant activity. However, the cytosolic conserved region is essential, because Rcr1 (amino acids 1–96) and Rcr1 (amino acids 1–70) did not have an activity. A chimera protein consisting of amino acids 1–63 of Rcr1 and 64–210 of Rcr2 had activity (Fig. 7C), although Rcr2 itself did not confer Congo red resistance in the same expression construct. This suggested that the conserved region plays an important role for the activity of Rcr1. RCR2 may be a defective copy of a duplication of a common ancestor of the RCR1 gene."
https://openalex.org/W2062420358,"One of the major biomarkers of oxidative stress and oxidative damage of cellular DNA is 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoGua), which is more easily oxidized than guanine to diverse oxidative products. In this work, we have investigated further oxidative transformations of 8-oxoGua in single- and double-stranded oligonucleotides to the dehydroguanidinohydantoin, oxaluric acid, and diastereomeric spiroiminodihydantoin lesions. The relative distributions of these end products were explored by a combined kinetic laser spectroscopy and mass spectrometry approach and are shown to depend markedly on the presence of superoxide radical anions. The 8-oxaGua radicals were produced by one-electron oxidation of 8-oxoGua by 2-aminopurine radicals generated by the two-photon ionization of 2-aminopurine residues site specifically positioned in 5′-d(CC[2-aminopurine]TC[8-oxoGua]CTACC). The hydrated electrons also formed in the photoionization process were trapped by dissolved molecular oxygen thus producing superoxide. A combination reaction between the 8-oxoGua and superoxide radicals occurs with the rate constant of (1.3 ± 0.2) × 108 m–1 s–1 and (1.0 ± 0.5) × 108 m–1 s–1 in single- and double-stranded DNA, respectively. The major end products of this reaction are the dehydroguanidinohydantoin lesions that slowly hydrolyze to oxaluric acid residues. In the presence of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase, an enzyme that induces the rapid catalytic dismutation of superoxide to the less reactive H2O2 and O2, the yields of the dehydroguanidinohydantion lesions become negligible. Under these conditions, the 8-oxoGua radicals do not exhibit any observable reactivities with oxygen (k < 102 m–1 s–1), decay on the time interval of several seconds, and the major reaction products are the spiroiminodihydantoin lesions.

Muller J.G. Rachlin E.M. Burrows C.J. Org. Lett. 2000; 2: 613-616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The initial one-electron oxidation product of the nucleoside 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodGuo), the radical cation 8-oxodGuo·+, has been detected by direct spectroscopic methods in pulse radiolysis (5Steenken S.

In neutral aqueous solutions the radical cation (pKa = 6.6) is in equilibrium with its neutral form, 8-oxodGuo(–H)· (5Steenken S. Jovanovic S.V. Bietti M. Bernhard K. J. Am. Chem.

In DNA, 8-oxoGua is more easily oxidizable than any of the four natural nucleobases in different sequence contexts (3Hickerson R.P. Prat F. Muller J.G. Foote C.S. Burrows C.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 9423-9428Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Our own laser flash photolysis studies have shown that the spectroscopic characteristics of the 8-oxoGua·+/8-oxoGua(–H)· radicals embedded in DNA (8Shafirovich V. Cadet J. Gasparutto D. Dourandin A. Huang W. Geacintov N.E. J. Phys. Chem. 2001; 105: 586-592Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) are very close to those of the free base radicals, 8-oxodGuo·+/8-oxodGuo(–H)· (5Steenken S. Jovanovic S.V. Bietti M. Bernhard K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2373-2374Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 6Shafirovich V. Cadet J. Gasparutto D. Dourandin A. Geacintov N.E. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, direct time resolved spectroscopic techniques have not yet been employed to monitor the decay and the reactivities of 8-oxoGua·+/8-oxoGua(–H)· radicals in DNA. In this work we explored the decay kinetics of 8-oxoGua·+/8-oxoGua(–H)· in single- and double-stranded oligonucleotides in the presence and absence of the superoxide radical anions (O2·¯). The superoxide radical is an important biological intermediate that is ubiquitous in living cells (9Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 97-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18515-18517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar, 11Valentine J.S. Hart P.J. Gralla E.B. Leone A. Mercer J.F.B. Advances in Experimantal Medicine and Biology. 448. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1999: 193-203Google Scholar). In vivo, superoxide radicals are rapidly deactivated by superoxide dismutases that catalyze the conversion of O2·¯ to the less reactive H2O2 and O2 molecules (9Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 97-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18515-18517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar, 11Valentine J.S. Hart P.J. Gralla E.B. Leone A. Mercer J.F.B. Advances in Experimantal Medicine and Biology. 448. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1999: 193-203Google Scholar). However, in tissues subjected to chronic infection and inflammation, the consumption of molecular oxygen is enhanced, and O2·¯ radicals are overproduced (12Grisham M.B. Jourd'heuil D. Wink D.A. Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 14: 3-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Halliwell B. Mutat. Res. 1999; 443: 37-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Therefore, bimolecular combination reactions of 8-oxoGua radicals with superoxide anions might be feasible in vivo, especially under conditions of oxidative stress. However, neither the rates of such reactions nor the nature of the oxidation products formed has so far been investigated. In this work, the 8-oxoGua·+/8-oxoGua(–H)· radicals were generated using a laser flash photolysis method developed by our group (8Shafirovich V. Cadet J. Gasparutto D. Dourandin A. Huang W. Geacintov N.E. J. Phys. Chem. 2001; 105: 586-592Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Misiaszek R. Crean C. Joffe A. Geacintov N.E. Shafirovich V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32106-32115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This method involves the site-specific incorporation of a single 2-aminopurine (2AP) residue, a nucleic acid base analog, into 2′-deoxyribooligonucleotide strands containing a single 8-oxoGua residue at a defined site. Intense 308 nm laser pulse excitation of these oligonucleotides in either single- or double-stranded forms induces a two-photon ionization of the 2AP residues yielding 2AP radical cations (Fig. 1). Under these conditions of photoexcitation, neither 8-oxoGua nor the four normal DNA nucleobases are photoionized (8Shafirovich V. Cadet J. Gasparutto D. Dourandin A. Huang W. Geacintov N.E. J. Phys. Chem. 2001; 105: 586-592Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The 2AP radicals rapidly deprotonate to yield the neutral 2AP(–H)· radicals. Both the 2AP radical cations and 2AP(–H)· radicals are strong one-electron oxidants that selectively oxidize 8-oxoGua at a distance (8Shafirovich V. Cadet J. Gasparutto D. Dourandin A. Huang W. Geacintov N.E. J. Phys. Chem. 2001; 105: 586-592Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In air-equilibrated or oxygen-saturated solutions, the hydrated electrons derived from the photoionization of 2AP are rapidly and quantitatively scavenged by dissolved O2 to generate superoxide radicals (15Buxton G.V. Greenstock C.L. Helman W.P. Ross A.B. J. Phys. Chem. 1988; 17: 513-886Google Scholar). Thus, the laser flash photolysis method provides a very convenient approach for exploring the reactivities and fates of 8-oxoGua·+/8-oxoGua-(–H)· radicals in DNA (Fig. 1). In this study, the oligonucleotide 5′-d(CC[2AP]TC[8-oxo-Gua]CTACC) was employed. The electron transfer from 8-oxo-Gua to the 2AP radicals occurs over a bridge of two bases and is rather efficient in oligonucleotides with analogous sequence contexts (8Shafirovich V. Cadet J. Gasparutto D. Dourandin A. Huang W. Geacintov N.E. J. Phys. Chem. 2001; 105: 586-592Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 16Shafirovich V. Dourandin A. Huang W. Luneva N.P. Geacintov N.E. J. Phys.

The reactions of the 8-oxoGua·+/8-oxoGua(–H)· radicals were monitored by transient absorption spectroscopy. The oxidatively modified oligonucleotides, separated and purified by HPLC analysis of the irradiated oligonucleotides, were identified by MALDI-TOF/MS analysis. The major product found was the dehydroguanidinohydantoin (Ghox) lesion that slowly decomposes to oxaluric acid (Oa). However, the end products of oxidation of 8-oxoGua(–H)· radicals changes dramatically from Ghox and Oa to the diastereomeric spiroiminodihandantoin (Sp) lesions when the levels of O2·¯ are reduced by the addition of superoxide dismutase during the photoreactions. Materials—All chemicals (analytical grade) were used as received. Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD) was from Roche Applied Science. The oligonucleotides were synthesized by standard automated phosphoramidite chemistry techniques. Phophoramidites and other chemicals required for oligonucleotide synthesis were obtained from Glen Research (Sterling, VA). To prevent the oxidation of 8-oxoGua residues, the tritylated oligonucleotides were deprotected overnight at 55 °C in concentrated aqueous ammonia solutions containing 0.25 m mercaptoethanol. The crude oligonuclotides were purified by reversedphase HPLC, detritylated in 80% acetic acid according to standard protocols, and desalted using reversed-phase HPLC. The integrity of the oligonucleotides was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Laser Flash Photolysis—The transient absorption spectra and kinetics of free radical reactions were monitored directly using a fully computerized kinetic spectrometer system (∼7 ns response time) described elsewhere (16Shafirovich V. Dourandin A. Huang W. Luneva N.P. Geacintov N.E. J. Phys. Chem. 1999; 103: 10924-10933Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, 308 nm nanosecond XeCl excimer laser pulses were used to photolyse the sample solutions (0.25 ml) of the oligonucleotides saturated with molecular oxygen. The transient absorbance was probed along a 1-cm optical path by a light beam from a 75-watt xenon arc lamp with its light beam oriented perpendicular to the laser beam. The signal was recorded by a Tektronix TDS 5052 oscilloscope operating in its high resolution mode that typically allows for a suitable signal/noise ratio after a single laser short. The decay of the very long-lived 8-oxoGua radicals (experiments in the presence of Cu,Zn-SOD) was monitored by an HP 84453 diode array spectrophotometer (Hewlett Packard GMBH, Waldbronn, Germany) with a resolution of 0.5 s per point. The second order rate constants of the oxidative reactions initiated by free radicals were typically determined by least squares fits of the appropriate kinetic equations to the transient absorption profiles obtained in five different experiments with five different samples. HPLC Isolation of Oxidation Products—Stable end products of 8-oxoGua oxidation were isolated employing an analytical (250 × 4.6 mm inside diameter) ACE C18 column (MAC-MOD Analytical, Chadd Ford, PA). An 8–20% linear gradient of acetonitrile in 50 mm triethylammonium acetate in water (pH 7) was utilized for 60 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (detection of products at 260 nm). The HPLC fractions were evaporated under vacuum to remove acetonitrile and were purified by a second HPLC cycle. The oxaluric acid and spiroiminodihydantoin adducts were separated from one another using the adapted protocol from Ref. 18Kornyushyna O. Berges A.M. Muller J.G. Burrows C.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15304-15314Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar. Typically, separations were performed employing an analytical (250 × 4 mm inside diameter) DNAPac PA-100 column (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA), an isocratic mobile phase consisting of solvent A (10% acetonitrile in water) and solvent B (10% acetonitrile in 1.5 m ammonium acetate) in a 45:55 ratio and a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The purified adducts were desalted by reversed-phase HPLC using the following mobile phases: 5 mm triethylammonium acetate (10 min), deionized water (10 min), and an isocratic 50:50 acetonitrile and H2O mixture (15 min). MALDI-TOF/MS Assay—The mass spectra were acquired using a Bruker OmniFLEX instrument. The matrix was a 2:1 mixture of 2′,4′,6′-trihydroxyacetophenone methanol solution (30 mg/ml) and ammonium citrate aqueous solution (100 mg/ml). The aliquots (1–2 μl) of the 10 pmol/μl desalted samples and the matrix solution were spotted on a MALDI target and air-dried before analysis. The mass spectrometer equipped with a 337-nm nitrogen laser was operated in the negative linear mode (accelerating voltage 19 kV, extraction voltage 92.7% of the accelerating voltage, ion focus 9 kV, and delay time 250 ns). Each spectrum was obtained with an average of 50–100 laser shots. The mass spectra were internally calibrated by using synthetic oligonucleotides of known molecular weights. In this work we explore the oxidative transformations of 8-oxoGua that are initiated by a one-electron oxidation mechanism. The decay of 8-oxoGua·+/8-oxoGua(–H)· radicals was monitored by laser kinetic spectroscopy methods, whereas the end products were isolated by HPLC and identified by MALDI-TOF/MS techniques. Experiments were performed with the oligonucleotides, 5′-d(CC[2AP]TC[8-oxoGua]CTACC) containing single 8-oxoGua and 2AP residues separated by a TC dinucleotide sequence. The DNA duplexes were prepared either by annealing 5′-d(CC[2AP]TC[8-oxo-G]CTACC) with its natural complementary strand 5′-d(GGTAGCGATGG) or with a shorter strand, 5′-d(GCGTAG), to yield duplexes 1 and 2. 5′-d(CC[2AP]TC[8-oxoGua]CTACC)3′-d(GG—T−AG——C——GATGG)Duplex 1 5′-d(CC[2AP]TC[8-oxoGua]CTACC)3′-d(G—T—AG—−C——-G)Duplex 2 The melting temperatures of these duplexes were 44.0 ± 0.7 °C (1Beckman K.B. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19633-19636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar) and 24.0 ± 1.0 °C (2Cadet J. Bellon S. Berger M. Bourdat A.G. Douki T. Duarte V. Frelon S. Gasparutto D. Muller E. Ravanat J.L. Sauvaigo S. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 933-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) in 5 mm phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl. The duplex 2 rather than duplex 1 was utilized in most experiments because the shorter complementary strand in 2 facilitated the separation of the two strands by reversed-phase HPLC methods. The reaction kinetics of duplex 2 was studied at 9 °C to prevent the dissociation of the two strands. The full duplex 1 was utilized as a control to verify that the reaction kinetics of the radicals was not affected significantly by the less than full-length complementary strand in duplex 2. Experiments with single-stranded oligonucleotides and duplex 1 were performed at room temperature (23 ± 2 °C). Monitoring 8-OxoGua(–H)· Radicals by Transient Absorption Methods—Photoexcitation of the 5′-d(CC[2AP]TC[8-oxoGua]CTACC) sequence in either single- or double-stranded forms in oxygen-saturated buffer solutions (pH 7.5) with intense 308 nm excimer laser pulses induces a selective ionization of the 2AP residues (Fig. 1). The laser flash photolysis experiments showed that in agreement with previous observations (8Shafirovich V. Cadet J. Gasparutto D. Dourandin A. Huang W. Geacintov N.E. J. Phys. Chem. 2001; 105: 586-592Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) the hydrated electrons formed by the photoionization of 2AP are scavenged by molecular oxygen, resulting in the formation of superoxide radicals. Furthermore, the oxidation of 8-oxoGua residues by 2AP radicals is complete within ∼100 μs. Correspondingly, the transient absorption spectra recorded on a millisecond time scale at room temperature (Fig. 2) exhibit the narrow absorption band near 325 nm that is characteristic of the spectrum of the 8-oxoGua radical (5Steenken S. Jovanovic S.V. Bietti M. Bernhard K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2373-2374Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 6Shafirovich V. Cadet J. Gasparutto D. Dourandin A. Geacintov N.E. Chem. Res.

Chem. 2001; 105: 586-592Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The radical species observed cannot be unambiguously assigned either to the radical cation or to the neutral radical form because the transient absorption spectra of these two species are very close to one another (5Steenken S. Jovanovic S.V. Bietti M. Bernhard K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2373-2374Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 6Shafirovich V. Cadet J. Gasparutto D. Dourandin A. Geacintov N.E. Chem. Res.

Chem. 2001; 105: 586-592Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). If we make the assumption that the acid/base properties of the 8-oxoGua radicals in DNA are close to those of the free base radicals, 8-oxodGuo(–H)·/8-oxodGuo·+, the rate constant of the radical cation deprotonation can be estimated as k– = k+Ka, where Ka is the dissociation constant and k+ is the rate constant of radical protonation (∼2 × 1010–1m–1 s–1, Ref. 19Candeias L.P. Steenken S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 1094-1099Crossref Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Using the pKa value of 6.6 for 8-oxodGuo·+ (5Steenken S. Jovanovic S.V. Bietti M. Bernhard K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2373-2374Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar), the characteristic time of the deprotonation of the radical cation is τ– = 1/k– = 0.2 ms. Furthermore, recent pulse radiolysis experiments have shown that the deprotonation rate of G·+ radical cations in double-stranded DNA is extremely fast (∼300 ns, Ref. 20Kobayashi K. Tagawa S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 10213-10218Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Therefore, the deprotonation of the 8-oxoGua radical cations is most likely complete by the time the recording of the transient absorption spectra was started 0.6 ms after photoexcitation (Fig. 2). Based on these considerations, we conclude that the spectra recorded at pH 7.5 (Fig. 2) are predominantly caused by the neutral radical form, 8-oxoGua(–H)·. The absorption band of the O2·¯ radicals at 250 nm (21Bielski B.H.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1978; 28: 645-649Crossref Google Scholar) overlaps with the strong absorption of DNA at 260 nm and thus cannot be directly observed in these experiments. Amplitudes of the 8-oxoGua(–H)· signals in the duplex 1 were much lower than those in the single strand (Fig. 2). This difference in the signal amplitudes is in agreement with a lower efficiency of two-photon photoionization of 2AP in the double-stranded than in the single-stranded DNA (8Shafirovich V. Cadet J. Gasparutto D. Dourandin A. Huang W. Geacintov N.E. J. Phys. Chem. 2001; 105: 586-592Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 16Shafirovich V. Dourandin A. Huang W. Luneva N.P. Geacintov N.E. J. Phys.

A decrease in temperature does not result in any observable effects on 8-oxoGua(–H)· formation in both the single- and double-stranded oligonucleotides because the initial absorption amplitudes at 325 nm recorded at 9 °C were close to those measured at room temperature. At 9 °C, the signals of 8-oxoGua(–H)· in duplex 1 with the normal complementary strand were close to those in duplex 2 with the shorter complementary strand. This observation is an indication that the dissociation of the duplex 2 is negligible at 9 °C because in single-stranded oligonucleotides the photoionization of 2AP is more efficient than in double-stranded sequences (8Shafirovich V.

Kinetics of Radical Combination; Effect of Superoxide Dismutase—The gradual decay of the 8-oxoGua(–H)· absorption band (Fig. 3) occurring on a millisecond time scale was assigned to the combination reaction of the 8-oxoGua(–H)· and superoxide radicals (Reaction 1, Table I). A typical kinetic profile of the 8-oxoGua(–H)· decay recorded at 325 nm in the single-stranded oligonucleotide 5′-d(CC[2AP]TC[8-oxoGua]CTACC) is shown in Fig. 3A; the kinetic traces of the 8-oxoGua(–H)· decay in duplex 1 were similar (data not shown). The kinetic profiles of the transient absorbance (At) as a function of time were described by the following equation, obtained by integrating the differential equation for the second order kinetics, At=(A0−A∞)/[1+A0(k1/εR)t]+A∞(Eq. 1) Table IKinetic parameters of combination of the G(–H)·and O2·radicals in DNAView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)a The rate constants were measured in oxygen-saturated buffer solutions containing 0.1 m NaCl, and uncertainties are given as standard errors for the best least squares fits of the appropriate kinetic equations to the transient absorption profiles of 8-oxo-G(–H)· recorded at 325 nm.b The rate constants were calculated using Equation 6 in Ref. 21Bielski B.H.J.

The values of k1 were calculated by fitting Equation 1 to the transient absorption profiles at 325 nm, and the values are summarized in Table I. In these calculations, we used the molar extinction coefficients 11.0 × 103m–1 cm–1 and 10.2 × 103m–1 cm–1 for the free nucleoside radicals, 8-oxodGuo(–H)·, and the radical cation 8-oxodGuo·+, respectively, that were determined experimentally (5Steenken S. Jovanovic S.V. Bietti M. Bernhard K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2373-2374Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The contributions of the radical cation and neutral forms at pH 6.0 (80/20%) and pH 7.5 (10/90%) were estimated from the pKa value of 6.6 of the 8-oxodGuo·+ radical cation (5Steenken S. Jovanovic S.V. Bietti M. Bernhard K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2373-2374Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Note that dismutation of superoxide (Reaction 2) is relatively slow (21Bielski B.H.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1978; 28: 645-649Crossref Google Scholar) and thus cannot compete effectively with the combination reaction (Table I). The obtained value of k1 at pH 6.0 is larger by a factor of ∼1.5 than at pH 7.5. The smaller value at pH 7.5 correlates with the deprotonation of 8-oxodGua·+, and the formation of the neutral 8-oxoGua(–H)· radicals that reacts more slowly with O2·¯ than the radical cation. In duplex 1 and in the single-stranded form, the combination of 8-oxoGua(–H)· and O2·¯ radicals occurs with similar rates (Table I). Here, k1 was determined with a lower accuracy than in the case of the single strand, because the transient absorption signals are smaller in the duplex form. Nevertheless, these measurements indicate that the DNA secondary structure exerts a rather small effect on the combination rates. The values of k1 (Table I) were calculated directly only from the decay kinetics of 8-oxoGua(–H)· recorded at 325 nm (Fig. 3A) because the strong UV absorption of DNA does not allow for a direct observation of the decay kinetics of superoxide radicals that have an absorption band near 250 nm (21Bielski B.H.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1978; 28: 645-649Crossref Google Scholar). To obtain additional evidence that the O2·¯ radical is a principal reaction partner of the 8-oxoGua(–H)· radical, the kinetics of decay of 8-oxoGua(–H)· were recorded in the presence of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase that rapidly reacts with the superoxide radicals (Reaction 3). The addition of Cu,Zn-SOD at micromolar concentrations exerts a pronounced effect on the kinetics of decay of the 8-oxo-G(–H)· as shown for the single-stranded oligonucleotide 5′-d(CC[2AP]TC[8-oxoGua]CTACC) in Fig. 3. At [Cu,Zn-SOD] = 5 μm, the 8-oxoGua(–H)· radicals are stable in the millisecond time domain (0–100 ms) (Fig. 3A), and decay on a time scale of seconds (Fig. 3B) with a characteristic decay time of 3–5 s. In the case of duplex 1, the effect of Cu,Zn-SOD is very similar (data not shown), and at a 5 μm Cu,Zn-SOD concentration the lifetime of the 8-oxoGua(–H)· radicals approaches 15–20 s at amb"

Heme oxygenase (HO)-1, although acutely induced by inflammatory stimuli, has cytoprotective properties and prevents an exaggerated inflammatory response. Ets-1 and Ets-2 both induce HO-1 promoter activity; however, Ets-2 was a more potent transactivator of HO-1 in macrophages. A potent inflammatory mediator, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), induced Ets-2 at the mRNA and protein level, and this induction preceded the up-regulation of HO-1. To further delineate the role of Ets-2 in regulating HO-1 transcription, we performed HO-1 promoter analysis studies in macrophages. Deletion mutants down to –137/+74 maintained an activity analogous to that of the largest construct, –4045/+74. Further deletion constructs (starting with –117/+74) showed a significant reduction in promoter activity when co-transfected with Ets-2 or exposed to LPS. Promoter sequence analysis revealed two putative Ets binding sites (EBSs) in this region, and mutation of these sites showed that EBS –93, more than EBS –125, was critical for full HO-1 promoter activity. Additional studies showed that EBS –93 binds Ets-2 and that mutation of the DNA binding domain of Ets-2 entirely prevented transactivation of HO-1. Finally, overexpression of a dominant negative form of Ets-2 blunted HO-1 promoter induction by LPS, and kinase inhibitors (PI3K more than JNK) that reduced Ets-2 expression markedly decreased endogenous HO-1 expression. Our data provide evidence that Ets-2 contributes to the up-regulation of HO-1 by the potent inflammatory stimulus LPS in macrophages.

Three different HO isoforms have been described, and HO-1 is the highly inducible isoform expressed in many cell types in response to pathophysiologic stimuli such as inflammation and endotoxin exposure (1Tenhunen R.

The importance of HO-1 during endotoxemia was demonstrated by the increased mortality, increased oxidative stress, and exaggerated end-organ damage in HO-1-null mice compared with wild-type mice (10Wiesel P. Patel P.P. DiFonzo N. Marria P.B. Sim C.U. Pellacani A. Maemura K. LeBlanc B.W. Marino K. Doerschuk C.M. Yet S-F. Lee M.-E.

HO-1 and the subsequent metabolites of heme catabolism play vital roles in regulating inflammation, oxidative stress, and cell survival (15Ryter S.W. Otterbein L.E. Morse D. Choi A.M.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 234/235: 249-263Crossref Scopus (452) Google Scholar) in many animal models of disease. The proposed mechanisms by which HO-1 exerts its biological effects include the following: (a) the ability to degrade the pro-oxidative heme; (b) the release of biliverdin and subsequent conversion to bilirubin, both of which have antioxidant properties (16Stocker R. Yamamoto Y. McDonagh A.F. Glazer A.N. Ames B.N. Science. 1987; 235: 1042-1046Crossref Scopus (2942) Google Scholar); (c) the generation of CO, which has vasodilatory, antiproliferative, and anti-inflammatory properties (15Ryter S.W. Otterbein L.E. Morse D. Choi A.M.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 234/235: 249-263Crossref Scopus (452) Google Scholar); and (d) the induction of ferritin, which has iron-binding properties (17Otterbein L.E. Soares M.P. Yamashita K. Bach F.H. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 449-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). Due to these beneficial effects of HO-1 during an inflammatory stimulus, we wanted to further understand the regulation of HO-1 gene expression during endotoxin exposure. The Ets proteins are a family of transcription factors that are known to be involved with inflammatory responses (18Dittmer J. Nordheim A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1377: F1-F11PubMed Google Scholar, 19Anderson K.L. Perkin H. Surh C.D. Venturini S. Maki R.A. Torbett B.E. J.

Immunity. 1995; 3: 223-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 22Ghysdael J. Boureux A. Ghysdael J. Yaniv M. Oncogenes as Transcriptional Regulators. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1997: 29-89Google Scholar). The Ets superfamily of transcription factors is composed of proteins that share a DNA binding domain (winged helix-turn-helix motif) that allows Ets proteins to interact with GGAA/T-containing DNA elements (18Dittmer J. Nordheim A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1377: F1-F11PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). The majority of Ets members bind to DNA as monomeric proteins; however, Ets-1 and Ets-2 have been shown to interact with a variety of transcription factors, including AP-1 and nuclear factor-κB, to regulate gene expression (22Ghysdael J. Boureux A. Ghysdael J. Yaniv M. Oncogenes as Transcriptional Regulators. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1997: 29-89Google Scholar). In these circumstances, Ets factors often regulate the transcriptional activity of enhancer elements containing adjacent cis-acting elements, for example, Ets and AP-1 binding sites (21Bassuk A.G. Leiden J.M. Immunity. 1995; 3: 223-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Due to the presence of putative Ets binding domains in the –4 kb enhancer region of the mouse HO-1 gene, which are located in close proximity to stress response elements that contain functionally important AP-1 binding sites (14Wiesel P. Foster L.C. Pellacani A. Layne M.D. Hsieh C-M. Huggins G.S. Strauss P. Yet S.-F. Perrella M.A. J. Biol.

Des. 2003; 9: 2499-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that Ets family members may be important transcription factors driving HO-1 expression during an inflammatory response. Deramaudt et al. (26Deramaudt B.M. Remy P. Abraham N.G. J. Cell Biochem. 1999; 72: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) previously investigated the role of Ets factors, particularly Erg, in regulating HO-1 in oocytes and endothelial cells to promote angiogenesis. However, the importance of Ets factors in regulating HO-1 induction during an inflammatory stimulus (such as endotoxin exposure) is not known. Thus, due to the potential importance of Ets factors in immune cell signaling and vascular inflammation, we wanted to determine whether members of the Ets superfamily could regulate HO-1 gene expression. Cell Culture and Reagents—Murine macrophages (RAW 264.7) were cultured as described previously (27Ejima K. Layne M.D. Carvajal I.M. Nanri H. Ith B. Yet S-F. Perrella M.A. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2002; 4: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Salmonella typhosa was purchased from Sigma. Kinase inhibitors used in our studies were purchased from BIOMOL International L.P. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). LY294002, SP600125, SB203580, and PD98059 were all used in concentrations of 5–10 μm. Luciferase Reporter Constructs and Expression Plasmids—An HO-1 luciferase reporter plasmid, HO-1-(–4045/+74), was amplified from mouse genomic DNA by PCR and subcloned into the pGL2 luciferase reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). This HO-1 promoter was a gift from Dr. Shaw-Fang Yet. HO-1-(–3527/+74), HO-1-(–2986/+74), HO-1-(–2413/+74), HO-1-(–1857/+74), HO-1-(–295/+74), HO-1-(–137/+74), HO-1-(–117/+74), HO-1-(–66/+74), and HO-1-(–35/+74) deletion mutants were generated by PCR amplification with HO-1-(–4045/+74) as the template. Expression plasmids pCI-Ets-1, pCI-Ets-2, pCI-NERF2, and pCI-Elk-1 were a generous gift from Dr. Peter Oettgen. The dominant negative mutant of Ets-2 (28Sementchenko V.I. Schweinfest C.W. Papas T.S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 18871-18880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) were generated by PCR amplification from mouse Ets-2 cDNA. Ets-2 phosphorylation mutant with a substitution of alanine for the wild-type threonine at position 72, pCI-Ets-2T72A, was generated as described previously (31Fowles L.F. Martin M.L. Lelsen L.

Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutants of Ets binding sites (EBSs) at bp –125 (mEBS1), –93 (mEBS2), and double mutant (mEBS1+2) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the HO-1-(–4045/+74) plasmid using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). In brief, PCR primers encoding mutant EBS, –122 to –125 and –90 to –93, were generated with CTGA substituted for ATCC in mEBS1 (5′-GAGTCATATGATTTCTGACCTTACAGGCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGCCTGTAAGGTCAGAAATCATATGACTC-3′) and GTTT substituted for GGAT in mEBS2 (5′-CTCCGGGCTGTTTGTTGCAACAGCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGCTGTTGCAACAAACAGCCCGGAG-3′). PCR was performed with Pfu polymerase using the wild-type HO-1-(–4045/+74) plasmid as a template. The PCR was digested with DpnI, and the undigested plasmids were transformed into XL2-Blue bacteria (Stratagene). Individual plasmids were sequenced to verify incorporation of the Ets site mutation (schematic structures as described in the top panel of Fig. 4A). Transient Transfections of RAW 264.7 Cells—HO-1 reporter constructs were used for transient transfection assays of RAW 264.7 cells as described previously (14Wiesel P. Foster L.C. Pellacani A. Layne M.D. Hsieh C-M. Huggins G.S. Strauss P. Yet S.-F. Perrella M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24840-24846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and 3 × 105 cells/well were plated in triplicate on 6-well plates and incubated overnight. Using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science), cells were transfected with 250 ng of a HO-1 reporter plasmid plus the indicated amounts of expression constructs, Ets-1, Ets-2 (wild-type or mutated forms), NERF2, and Elk-1. At least three independent experiments, carried out in triplicate, were performed for each experimental condition. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays and Microaffinity Capture Experiments—Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described previously (32Chen Y-H. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Yet S.-F. Perrella M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47658-47663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), using nuclear extracts from RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with vehicle or LPS (500 ng/ml) for 6 h. In brief, double-stranded oligonucleotide probes encoding region –99 to –82 (EBS2) of the HO-1 5′-flanking sequence (5′-CGGGCTGGATGTTGCAAC-3′; the Ets binding site is underlined) were used. The probe containing EBS at bp –93 was end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase. Labeled DNA (approximately 50,000 cpm) was used in each binding reaction. Microaffinity Ets-2 capture experiments were performed as described previously (33Han Y. Runge M.S. Brasier A.R. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), with modifications. Purification of DNA-binding proteins by this microaffinity technique was performed using the EBS2 double-stranded oligonucleotide probe, with the upper strand synthesized with a5′ biotin modification. The probe was incubated with 200 μg of nuclear extract protein, under the same binding conditions used for the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, in volumes of 100 –200 μl. After the addition of 100 μg of streptavidin magnetic beads (New England BioLabs) and incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, the tubes were clamped against a magnetic bar and washed twice with 500 μl of ice-cold nuclear extraction buffer. SDS-PAGE protein sample buffer was added, and after heating the samples to 95 °C for 10 min, they were fractionated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide minigels. Western blot analysis was then performed with rabbit polyclonal anti-Ets-2. In experiments using recombinantly expressed Ets-2, pCI-Ets-2 cDNA was used as a template for generating 35S-labeled in vitro translation products in the TnT quick coupled transcription/translation systems (Promega). RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—RNeasy mini RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used to extract total RNA from cultured cells. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (10Wiesel P. Patel P.P. DiFonzo N. Marria P.B. Sim C.U. Pellacani A. Maemura K. LeBlanc B.W. Marino K. Doerschuk C.M. Yet S-F. Lee M.-E.

In brief, RNA samples (10 μg) were electrophoresed in a 1.3% agarose gel containing 3.7% formaldehyde and then transferred to NitroPure filters (GE Osmonics Inc., Minnetonka, MN). The filters were then hybridized with random primed, [α-32P]dCTP-labeled Ets-2 or HO-1 probes. To correct for the differences in RNA loading, blots were subsequently hybridized to a γ-32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe complementary to 28 S rRNA. The blots were exposed to a phosphoscreen and x-ray film. The radioactivity was measured on a PhosphorImager by using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Total Protein Isolation and Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell lysates (30 μg) of RAW 264.7 cells were boiled and resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were transferred on Pure nitrocellulose membranes and immunoblotted using SuperSignal® West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Rabbit polyclonal anti-Ets-2 (SC-351; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-HO-1 (Stressgen Biotechnologies Corp., Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) antibodies were diluted to 1:2000 before use. Statistics—Where indicated, comparisons between groups were made by factorial analysis of variance followed by Fisher's least significant difference test. Ets-2 Activates HO-1 Promoter Activity—Due to the importance of the Ets family of proteins in immunologic responses (18Dittmer J. Nordheim A. Biochim. Biophys.

Biol. 1995; 15: 6961-6970Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), we postulated that Ets factors may also play a role in the regulation of HO-1 in response to an inflammatory stimulus. We initially examined the ability of a panel of macrophage-expressed Ets factors to transactivate the –4 kb HO-1 promoter. Mouse macrophages (RAW 264.7 cells) were transiently transfected with expression plasmids for Ets-1, Ets-2, NERF2, and Elk-1, and promoter activity of HO-1-(–4045/+74) reporter construct was assessed. We found that Ets-1 and Ets-2 increased HO-1 promoter activity (by 3-fold and by 7-fold, respectively; p < 0.05), whereas NERF2 and Elk-1 had no effect (Fig. 1). In addition, we found that LPS induced HO-1 promoter activity by 8-fold. To confirm the induction of HO-1 promoter activity by Ets-2, we co-transfected HO-1-(–4045/+74) reporter construct with increasing amounts of the Ets-2 expression plasmid and demonstrated that Ets-2 induces HO-1 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). These results suggest that Ets-2 is a potential transcriptional regulator of the HO-1 promoter and that the ability of Ets-2 to transactivate HO-1 is comparable with LPS stimulation. Induction of Ets-2 Precedes Induction of HO-1 by LPS Stimulation in Macrophages—To investigate the temporal relationship between Ets-2 and HO-1 expression, we treated RAW 264.7 cells with LPS (500 ng/ml) and harvested total RNA at 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 12, and 24 h after LPS. HO-1 mRNA levels began to increase by 6 h, and marked induction of HO-1 was evident after 12 h of LPS treatment (Fig. 2A). Ets-2 message was evident at baseline (vehicle-treated cells); however, induction of Ets-2 began by 1 h after LPS administration. To evaluate protein expression, we treated RAW 264.7 cells with LPS and harvested total protein at analogous time points. Ets-2 protein was seen as a doublet, with the upper band of the doublet representing the phosphorylated form of Ets-2 (Fig. 2B, P-Ets-2), as confirmed by the disappearance of this band after treatment of the extracted protein with alkaline phosphatase (data not shown). HO-1 protein levels were markedly increased 12 h after LPS treatment (Fig. 2B). Ets-2 protein levels began to increase 1 h after LPS treatment and were maximally induced after 6 h. Also, to determine whether overexpression of Ets-2 could increase endogenous HO-1 expression, we transiently transfected RAW 264.7 cells with expression plasmids for Ets-2 (pCI-Ets-2) or empty plasmid (pCI). Cells receiving the same transfection reagents were also treated with vehicle (negative control) or LPS (positive control) for 24 h. Total protein was harvested from the cells, and Western blots were performed. Although only a portion of the cells were transfected with the Ets-2 expression plasmid (in contrast to the ubiquitous expression in LPS-stimulated cells), extraction of total protein revealed an increase in exogenous Ets-2 (Fig. 2C). Cells transfected with pCI-Ets-2 revealed an induction in endogenous HO-1, compared with no HO-1 induction in cells transfected with pCI (empty plasmid; Fig. 2C). Taken together, these data demonstrate that Ets-2 induction precedes HO-1 induction by LPS at both the mRNA and protein levels and that overexpression of Ets-2 alone is capable of inducing endogenous HO-1 expression. Ets-2- and LPS-responsive Elements are Downstream of bp –137 in the HO-1 Promoter—Initially, we assessed the responsiveness of construct HO-1-(–4045/+74) to stimulation by Ets-2 and LPS. This construct, containing the HO-1 –4 kb enhancer region, was induced a similar magnitude by Ets-2 and LPS, as shown in Fig. 1. To further localize the Ets-2- and LPS-responsive element(s), we made deletion mutants of HO-1-(–4045/+74) and either co-transfected these deletion constructs with an expression plasmid for Ets-2 (Fig. 3A) or stimulated the constructs with LPS (500 ng/ml; Fig. 3B). The data are presented as fold induction of promoter activity compared with HO-1-(–4045/+74) promoter construct in the absence of Ets-2 or LPS. Induction of the deletion mutants by Ets-2 or LPS was similar to construct HO-1-(–4045/+74) down to construct HO-1-(–137/+74). Further deletions (including constructs HO-1-(–117/+74), HO-1-(–66/+74), and HO-1-(–34/+74)) showed a significant reduction in promoter activity when exposed to Ets-2 (Fig. 3A) or LPS (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that the cis-acting elements critical for HO-1 induction by either Ets-2 or LPS in these mouse macrophages are located downstream of bp –137 in the HO-1 promoter. Ets Binding Site at bp –93 Is Critical for Induction of HO-1 Promoter Activity by Ets-2 and LPS—To identify the exact Ets-2- and LPS-responsive sites, we further analyzed the HO-1 promoter sequence downstream of bp –137. Sequence analysis of this region revealed putative Ets-2 binding sites at –125 and –93. We named these two sites EBS1 (5′-GATTTATCCCCTTA-3′) and EBS2 (5′-GGGCTGGATGTTGC-3′), respectively. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we made single and double mutants of these two putative EBSs in the HO-1-(–4045/+74) promoter construct. Fig. 4A shows a schematic diagram of these mutants. The data are presented as fold induction compared with promoter activity of the wild-type construct in the absence of Ets-2 or LPS. The EBS mutants and wild-type HO-1 promoter constructs were co-transfected with the expression plasmid for Ets-2 or with an equivalent amount of empty vector plus LPS (Fig. 4, B and C, respectively). In the context of the HO-1-(–4045/+74) construct, the promoter activity of mEBS1 tended to decrease slightly in the presence of Ets-2, and this decrease was significant in the presence of LPS. The lack of significance in the Ets-2-transfected cells may relate to variability in efficiency and level of Ets-2 expression. However, more impressively, both mEBS2 and mEBS1+2 constructs were markedly decreased compared with the wild-type HO-1-(–4045/+74) construct in the presence of Ets-2 or LPS, and in the LPS-stimulated cells, mEBS2 and mEBS1+2 were also significantly decreased compared with mEBS1. Taken together, these results suggest that both EBS –125 and EBS –93 contribute to Ets-2 and LPS responsiveness; however, the EBS –93 site is the most critical site responsible for Ets-2 or LPS induction of the HO-1 –4 kb promoter. To further define the potential role of Ets-2 in the regulation of HO-1, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay and microaffinity Ets-2 capture experiments with a radiolabeled probe encoding the EBS2 site at bp –93. The probe was incubated with nuclear extracts from RAW 264.7 cells in the presence or absence of LPS (500 ng/ml) (Fig. 5). Fig. 5A shows that a protein complex bound at the EBS2 site, and the intensity of this complex increased with LPS treatment. To evaluate the specificity of binding, a 100-molar excess of unlabeled identical (Fig. 5A, I, lane 3), mutated (MtI, lane 4), or non-identical (NI, lane 6; AP-1 binding site) oligonucleotide competitors was incubated with the reaction mixture. These competitor studies revealed that the induced DNA-protein complex binding at the EBS2 site was specific. To determine whether Ets-2 was present in the binding complex, we used a previously described transcription factor microcapture technique (33Han Y. Runge M.S. Brasier A.R. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The biotinylated EBS2 probe was incubated with nuclear extracts from RAW 264.7 cells treated with vehicle or LPS. Nuclear extracts from cells stimulated with LPS were also incubated in the presence or absence of in vitro translated dominant negative (rdn)-Ets-2. The bound proteins were recovered by magnetic separation using streptavidin-coated beads, after which Ets-2 was assessed by Western blot analysis. Fig. 5B revealed that Ets-2 binds at the EBS2 site, and rdn-Ets-2 blocked the binding of endogenous Ets-2 at this same site. Fig. 5C demonstrated that mutation of the DNA binding domain of recombinant Ets-2 (Ets-2ΔDBD) prevented this protein from binding at the EBS2 site and that mutation of the EBS2 site prevented binding of wild-type recombinant Ets-2 (rEts-2). Disruption of DNA Binding or Overexpression of Dominant Negative Ets-2 Blocks Induction of the HO-1 Promoter—We have shown that Ets-2 induces HO-1 transactivation by acting through the EBS2 site at bp –93 and that Ets-2 is capable of binding to this EBS site. To confirm the importance of DNA binding by Ets-2, we generated an expression construct with the DNA binding domain of Ets-2 mutated (Ets-2ΔDBD). As shown previously (Fig. 1), overexpression of wild-type Ets-2 significantly increased HO-1-(–4045/+74) promoter activity; however, overexpression of Ets-2ΔDBD is incapable of transactivating the HO-1 promoter (Fig. 6). Thus, Ets-2 must bind DNA for this transcription factor to induce the HO-1 promoter (Fig. 4). To examine the role of Ets-2 in regulating HO-1 transactivation by an LPS stimulus, we generated a dominant negative Ets-2 expression plasmid (dn-Ets-2). The dn-Ets-2 construct has a DNA binding domain but does not have a transactivation domain; thus, it acts by blocking the binding of functional Ets-2 to the target gene promoter (28Sementchenko V.I. Schweinfest C.W. Papas T.S. Watson D.K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2883-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 29Sapi E. Flick M.B. Rodov S. Kacinski B.M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1027-1033PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas LPS stimulation markedly induced the HO-1-(–4045/+74) reporter construct, co-expression of dn-Ets-2 significantly blunted HO-1 promoter transactivation by LPS. These data demonstrate that Ets-2 plays an important role in the transactivation of HO-1 by LPS in mouse macrophages. PI3K and JNK Regulate Expression of Both Ets-2 and HO-1— Ets-2 is a target of PI3K and JNK signaling pathways (34Smith J.L. Schaffner A.E. Hofmeister J.K. Hartman M. Wei G. Forsthoefel D. Hume D.A. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8026-8034Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and we wanted to determine whether an Ets-2 phosphorylation mutant or an alteration in Ets-2 expression by kinase inhibitors may also affect the level of HO-1 expression. As shown previously, the HO-1-(–4045/+74) reporter construct was significantly induced in RAW 264.7 cells by both LPS and wild-type Ets-2 (Fig. 7A).

Prior studies have suggested that cap trimethylation might be contingent on cis-acting elements in the RNA substrate, protein components of a ribonucleoprotein complex, or intracellular localization of the RNA substrate. However, the enzymatic requirements for TMG cap formation remain obscure because TMG synthesis has not been reconstituted in vitro from defined components. Tgs1 is a conserved eukaryal protein that was initially identified as being required for RNA cap trimethylation in vivo in budding yeast. Here we show that purified recombinant fission yeast Tgs1 catalyzes methyl transfer from S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) to m7GTP and m7GDP. Tgs1 also methylates the cap analog m7GpppA but is unreactive with GTP, GDP, GpppA, m2,2,7GTP, m2,2,7GDP, ATP, CTP, UTP, and ITP. The products of methyl transfer to m7GTP and m7GDP formed under conditions of excess methyl acceptor are 2,7-dimethyl GTP and 2,7-dimethyl GDP, respectively. Under conditions of limiting methyl acceptor, the initial m2,7GDP product is converted to m2,2,7GDP in the presence of excess AdoMet. We conclude that Tgs1 is guanine-specific, that N7 methylation must precede N2 methylation, that Tgs1 acts via a distributive mechanism, and that the chemical steps of TMG synthesis do not require input from RNA or protein cofactors.

Nature. 1999; 401: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). TMG caps are also found on nematode mRNAs that undergo trans-splicing of a 5′-capped leader sequence (3Liou R.F. Blumenthal T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1764-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It is generally assumed that TMG caps are formed by post-transcriptional methylation of m7G caps, but there is, as far as we know, no definitive evidence for an obligate relationship between prior N7 methylation and subsequent N2 methylation. Many studies, usually entailing RNA microinjections in amphibian oocytes, have focused on the question of how the TMG cap is targeted to specific cellular mRNAs in vivo. Spliceosomal snRNAs were shown to be trimethylated in the cytoplasm in a reaction that depended on an RNA element to which Sm protein components of the snRNP bind (4Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1986; 46: 905-911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Trimethylation of snoRNAs occurs in the nucleus and depends on RNA structural motifs specific to the snoRNAs (5Terns M Grimm P.C. Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4860-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 6Speckmann W.A. Terns R.M. Terns M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4467-4473Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). An analysis of snRNA trimethylation in an in vitro system derived from human cytosol indicated that: (i) AdoMet is the methyl donor in the reaction; (ii) snRNA pre-assembled with Sm proteins into a snRNP particle is an effective methyl acceptor; (iii) the Sm binding site in the RNA is required for trimethylation in vitro; and (iv) free snRNA does not serve as a methyl acceptor (7Plessel G. Fischer U. Lührmann R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4160-4172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A major step forward in defining the genetic pathway of TMG cap formation was made when Bordonné and colleagues (8Mouaikel J. Verheggen C. Bertrand E. Tazi J. Bordonné R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 891-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) identified the yeast Tgs1 protein in an interaction screen using a yeast Sm protein as bait. A tgs1 deletion mutant was viable even though the snRNAs and snoRNAs in the tgs1Δ strain lack TMG caps, as gauged by precipitation with anti-TMG antibody (8Mouaikel J. Verheggen C. Bertrand E. Tazi J. Bordonné R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 891-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The presence of a putative AdoMet binding motif in the Tgs1 polypeptide, mutation of which affected TMG formation in vivo (8Mouaikel J. Verheggen C. Bertrand E. Tazi J. Bordonné R. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4899-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), suggested that Tgs1 might be involved directly in TMG formation. Although Tgs1 has consequently been dubbed a trimethylguanosine synthase, there is no evidence as yet that this protein is itself the catalyst of guanosine hypermethylation and, if so, what its specificity, mechanism, and requirements for RNA or proteins partners might be. To address these issues, we produced and characterized the Tgs1 ortholog for the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Recombinant Tgs1—The open reading frame encoding Tgs1 was amplified from an S. pombe cDNA library by PCR and inserted into pET28-His10-Smt3. The pET-His10Smt3-Tgs1 plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21CodonPlus(DE3). A 500-ml culture amplified from a single transformant was grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol until the A600 reached 0.6. The culture was adjusted to 2% ethanol and 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and then incubated at 17 °C for 20 h with constant shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was stored at –80 °C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Thawed bacteria were resuspended in 25 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). Cell lysis was achieved by the addition of lysozyme to 100 μg/ml. The lysate was sonicated to reduce viscosity, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The soluble extract was applied to a 1-ml column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 10 ml of the same buffer and then eluted stepwise with 2-ml aliquots of buffer A containing 50, 100, 250, and 500 mm imidazole. The polypeptide compositions of the column fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE. The recombinant His10Smt3-Tgs1 polypeptide was recovered predominantly in the 250 mm imidazole fractions. The 250 mm imidazole eluate was dialyzed against buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol and then stored at –80 °C. The protein concentration was determined by SDS-PAGE analysis of serial dilutions of the Tgs1 preparation and a BSA standard. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, and the staining intensities of the His10Smt3-Tgs1 and BSA polypeptides were quantified with a Fujifilm FLA-5000 digital imaging and analysis system. Tgs1 concentration was calculated by interpolation to the BSA standard curve. Methyltransferase Assay—Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm DTT, 50 μm [3H-CH3]AdoMet, 5 mm m7GTP or m7GDP, and enzyme were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The mixtures were spotted on DEAE-cellulose filters (25 mm, Whatman DE81), which were washed three times batchwise with 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate (modified from Ref. 10Barbosa E. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7692-7697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The filters were dried, and the radioactivity adsorbed to the filter was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Materials—[3H-CH3]AdoMet was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. m7GTP, m7GDP, ATP, GTP, GDP, UTP, CTP, ITP, AdoMet, and AdoHcy were purchased from Sigma. m7GpppA and GpppA were purchased from New England Biolabs. 3′-O-MeGTP was from Amersham. m2,2,7GTP and m2,2,7GDP were obtained from Dr. Richard Davis (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center). Recombinant Tgs1 Is an AdoMet-dependent Methyltransferase— The 239-amino acid S. pombe Tgs1 protein was produced in E. coli as a His10-Smt3-tagged fusion and purified from a soluble bacterial extract by adsorption to nickel-agarose and elution with imidazole. SDS-PAGE revealed two predominant polypeptides, a larger species corresponding to His10Smt3-Tgs1 and a smaller polypeptide corresponding to the His10-Smt3 tag (Fig. 1A). The methyltransferase activity of Tgs1 was demonstrated by incubating the protein with 50 μm [3H-CH3]AdoMet and 5 mm m7GTP at 37 °C, which resulted in label transfer from AdoMet to the m7GTP to form an anionic methylated nucleotide product that was adsorbed to a DEAE filter and thereby separated from the cationic AdoMet substrate. The extent of methylation increased with time and was proportional to input enzyme (Fig. 1B). Methyl transfer displayed a bell-shaped pH dependence with optimal activity at pH 8.0 in Tris-HCl buffer (data not shown); activity was 60% of the optimum at pH 9.5 (Tris-HCl) and 25% of the optimum at pH 5.5 (Tris acetate). The recombinant protein was subjected to zonal velocity sedimentation in a 15–30% glycerol gradient (Fig. 2). Marker proteins catalase (native size 248 kDa), BSA (66 kDa), and cytochrome c (12 kDa) were included as internal standards. His10Smt3-Tgs1 (calculated to be a 41-kDa polypeptide) sedimented as a discrete peak (fraction 17) between BSA and cytochrome c and was clearly resolved from the free His10Smt3 tag (fraction 19). The methyltransferase activity profile paralleled the abundance of the tagged Tgs1 polypeptide and peaked at fraction 17. We surmise from these results that the methyltransferase activity is intrinsic to Tgs1 and that the tagged enzyme is a monomer in solution. Substrate Specificity and Product Analysis—Various nucleotides were tested as methyl acceptors at 5 mm concentration (Fig. 3). Tgs1 readily methylated m7GTP, m7GDP, and m7GpppA but not GTP, dGTP, ddGTP, 3′-O-MeGTP, GDP, GpppA, ITP, XTP, ATP, CTP, or UTP. Thus, Tgs1 is a guanine-specific methyltransferase that requires prior methylation at N7 of the purine ring. The trimethylated nucleotides m2,2,7GTP and m2,2,7GDP were not methylated by Tgs1 (Fig. 3), suggesting that the methylation reaction targeted the exocyclic amine of the guanine base. The product of the Tgs1-catalyzed reaction of 5 mm m7GTP with 5.4 μm [3H-CH3]AdoMet was analyzed by PEI-cellulose TLC and compared with a control reaction from which Tgs1 was omitted (Fig. 4A). The chromatogram was developed with 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, which allowed resolution of m7GTP from m2,2,7GTP and AdoMet. The positions of unlabeled nucleotide standards were identified by UV shadowing. The distribution of 3H radioactivity was gauged by cutting the chromatogram into 1-cm strips and quantifying each fraction by liquid scintillation counting. Most of the radioactivity in the no enzyme control comigrated with AdoMet in fractions 13–14, and there was no radioactivity associated with the guanine nucleotides (Fig. 4A, lower panel). In the presence of Tgs1, nearly all of the [3H-CH3]AdoMet was consumed, and the label transferred to two products: (i) a major species peaking at fraction 6 that migrated between the m7GTP and m2,2,7GTP standards; and (ii) a second species peaking at fraction 11, one fraction ahead of the m7GDP standard (Fig. 4A, upper panel). We surmise that the major reaction product is 2,7-dimethyl GTP and the minor product is likely to be 2,7-dimethyl GDP, formed by reaction of Tgs1 with the contaminating m7GDP nucleotide present in the commercial m7GTP preparation, which was visible on the UV-shadowed chromatogram. We also analyzed the product of Tgs1 reaction with 5 mm m7GDP with 5.4 μm [3H-CH3]AdoMet by PEI-cellulose TLC developed with 0.1 m ammonium sulfate (Fig. 4B). Most of the radioactivity in the no enzyme control comigrated with AdoMet in fractions 11–12 (Fig. 4B, lower panel). In the presence of Tgs1, the [3H-CH3]AdoMet was depleted and the label transferred to a single product peaking at fraction 6, between the m7GDP and m2,2,7GDP standards (Fig. 4B, upper panel). Formation of only one 3H-labeled product migrating between m7GDP and m2,2,7GDP was confirmed by autoradiography of a duplicate TLC plate (not shown). We surmise that the reaction product is 2,7-dimethyl GDP. We exploited the TLC assay to gauge the extent of methyl transfer from 50 μm [3H-CH3]AdoMet to m7GDP as a function of m7GDP concentration (Fig. 5A). From a double-reciprocal plot of the data, we calculated a Km value of 0.57 mm m7GDP and a kcat value of 2 min–1. Methylation of m7GDP by Tgs1 displayed a hyperbolic dependence on AdoMet concentration; from a double-reciprocal plot of the data, we calculated a Km value of 8 μm AdoMet (not shown). Methylation of 5 mm m7GTP in the presence of 50 μm [3H-CH3]AdoMet was inhibited in a concentration-dependent fashion by AdoHcy; the apparent IC50 for AdoHcy was 50 μm (data not shown). Thus, Tgs1 has similar affinity for its substrate AdoMet and its product AdoHcy. Addition of up to 20 mm GDP had only a modest (40%) inhibitory effect on methylation of 1 mm m7GDP by Tgs1 (Fig. 5B). From the inhibition profile, we estimate that Tgs1 binds GDP with one-thirtieth the affinity that it binds m7GDP. TLC analysis confirmed that no 3H-labeled m2GDP was formed by Tgs1 in the presence of 20 mm GDP (not shown). Synthesis of Trimethylguanosine by a Distributive Mechanism—The absence of 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine products in the experiments presented above implies that either: (i) Tgs1 is not responsible for the second methylation reaction; or (ii) Tgs1 does catalyze the second methylation reaction, but we are precluded from detecting it because the enzyme acts distributively, i.e. the labeled m2,7GTP or m2,7GDP product dissociates after a single round of catalysis and must compete with a >1,000-fold molar excess of unlabeled m7GTP or m7GDP for rebinding to Tgs1. To address these issues, we analyzed the products of methylation reactions containing low concentrations of the methyl acceptor. As outlined in Fig. 6, we incubated Tgs1 with 50 μm m7GDP and 100 μm [3H-CH3]AdoMet for 60 min and then supplemented the reaction mixture with 1 mm cold AdoMet and allowed the reaction to proceed. Aliquots were taken at 30-min intervals; the products were analyzed by TLC and the 3H-methylated nucleotides visualized by autoradiography. The instructive finding was that the majority of the m2,7GDP formed during the pulse-labeling phase was subsequently converted to m2,2,7GDP during the chase phase in the presence of excess cold AdoMet (Fig. 6). These results show that Tgs1 is a bona fide trimethylguanosine synthase capable of catalyzing serial methylation reactions at the exocyclic amino nitrogen of m7G via a distributive mechanism. The experiments presented here show that Tgs1, a protein implicated genetically in TMG cap formation (8Mouaikel J. Verheggen C. Bertrand E. Tazi J. Bordonné R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 891-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), is indeed a catalyst of TMG synthesis. A key finding is that methylation of guanine N2 by Tgs1 in vitro is strictly dependent on prior methylation of guanine N7. This requirement is unique to Tgs1, i.e. no such requirement applies to two other RNA guanine-N2 methyltransferases, Trm1 and Trm-G10 (11Armengaud J. Urbonavicius J. Fernandez B. Chaussinand G.

Biol. 1999; 291: 375-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and it suffices to explain why Tgs1 is cap-specific. Previous in vivo studies of Tgs1 had not illuminated this specificity, because the genetic analysis is complicated by the fact that whereas Tgs1 is not required for growth of S. cerevisiae (8Mouaikel J.

Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Moreover, the reliance on antibodies to characterize the state of the cap in mutant yeast strains (8Mouaikel J. Verheggen C. Bertrand E. Tazi J. Bordonné R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 891-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) places limits on what can be measured, i.e. anti-TMG antibodies might not be of use in determining whether snRNAs synthesized at restrictive temperature in an abd1-ts strain are methylated at N2 in the absence of methylation at N7. Our results argue against Tgs1 acting processively to add two methyl groups to the guanine N2 following a single event of m7GDP binding to the active site. In a processive mechanism, the AdoHcy product of the first methylation step would have to dissociate and the N-CH3 rotate about the C2–N2 bond to the purine ring in order to clear the transferred methyl group out of the active site to make room for an incoming AdoMet donor for the second methylation step. Our findings favor a distributive mechanism in which the AdoHcy and m2,7GDP products dissociate from Tgs1 after the first methylation step, and the second methylation step entails rebinding of m2,7GDP from solution. The finding here that guanine-N2 methylation of the cap by Tgs1 in vitro requires no RNA component and no protein cofactor forces reevaluation of the prevailing models that TMG synthesis depends strictly on cis-acting RNA signals or the assembly of specific RNP structures. Rather, our results instate a more conservative model in which RNP components might simply target Tgs1 to a particular subset of cellular RNAs that already have an m7G cap. This view of TMG formation, in which Tgs1 macromolecular interactions dictate access but not catalysis, mirrors the problem of enzymatic specificity versus cellular targeting encountered during the formation of the m7G cap itself. To wit, m7G capping in vivo is targeted specifically to cellular transcripts synthesized by RNA polymerase II, but the enzymes that perform the three capping reactions, starting from a triphosphate-terminated RNA, have no intrinsic ability to discriminate one RNA substrate from another as long as it has the requisite number of 5′-phosphates. Indeed, cap guanine-N7 methyltransferase is capable of methylating free guanine nucleotides (14Higman M.A. Christen L.A. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14974-14981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thus does not even require an RNA moiety to achieve its specificity in catalysis (15Fabrega C. Hausmann S. Shen V. Shuman S. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 77-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The capping apparatus is targeted to nascent RNAs by virtue of direct binding of the component enzymes to the RNA polymerase II transcription elongation complex (16Fabrega C. Shen V. Shuman S. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1549-1561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the present biochemical characterization of Tgs1 as an autonomous cap-specific guanine-N2 methyltransferase should stimulate efforts to dissect substrate selectivity determinants in a defined reconstituted system and to probe the structural basis for catalysis of TMG formation."
https://openalex.org/W2013181724,"We have recently demonstrated that light chain 2 (LC2) of the microtubule-associated protein MAP1A interacts with the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-binding domain of exchange protein directly activated by cyclic AMP 1 (EPAC1). In the present study we used a simultaneous expression system and found that LC2 enhances both basal and 8-(4-chloro-phenylthio)-2′-O-methyladenosine-3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-CPT-2Me-cAMP)-stimulated Rap1 activation by EPAC1. LC2 is known to stabilize microtubules; therefore we examined whether microtubules enhanced Rap1 activation by LC2. Nocodazole inhibited Rap1 activity in cells transfected with EPAC1 alone but had little effect on Rap1 activity in cells transfected with both EPAC1 and LC2. This indicates that part of the actions of LC2 in enhancing EPAC1 activity may be through stabilization of microtubules. We also found that in cells transfected with LC2, Rap1 was more sensitive to activation by 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP. Moreover, LC2 enhanced the ability of transfected and endogenous EPAC1 to interact with cyclic AMP-agarose, indicating that LC2 elicits conformational changes in the cAMP domain of EPAC1, enhancing its ability to be activated by cyclic AMP. We also found that disruption of the interaction of endogenous EPAC1 and LC2 with antibodies to the cAMP domain of EPAC1 abolished Rap1 activity in PC12 cell lysates, demonstrating the importance of LC2 for EPAC1 activation in these cells. Consistent with a role of EPAC1 in controlling integrin activity, we found that cell adhesion to laminin was enhanced in LC2- and EPAC1-transfected cells stimulated with 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP. LC2 is therefore a biological enhancer of EPAC1 activity toward Rap1 and associated downstream signaling mechanisms.

Cyclic AMP is a ubiquitous second messenger the synthesis of which is coupled to the activation of many G-protein-coupled receptors to regulate a wide variety of cellular responses (1Beavo J.A. Brunton L.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins stimulates production of cyclic AMP by one or more isoforms of adenylyl cyclase. Cyclic AMP phosphodiesterases degrade cyclic AMP to 5′AMP and thereby regulate intracellular concentrations of cyclic AMP (2Houslay M.D. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).

EPAC proteins, otherwise known as cyclic AMP guanine nucleotide exchange factors, represent a new mechanism for determining signaling specificity within the cyclic AMP signaling pathway (3Rehmann H.

Prior to the discovery of EPACs it was presumed that the principal intracellular receptor for cyclic AMP was PKA in many cell types (7Engh R.A. Bossemeyer D. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2001; 41: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). EPACs are specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors for the Ras GTPase homologues, Rap1 and Rap2, which EPACs activate independently of PKA (4Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S.

Specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors like EPAC1 convert Rap proteins to the active form, whereas GTPase-activating proteins complete the cycle by converting Rap to the inactive form (8Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Rap1 appears to function as an antagonist of Ras signaling by trapping Ras effectors (such as Raf-1) in an inactive complex (8Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). However, numerous reports indicate that Rap1 signaling independent of Ras is also important in controlling cellular processes (8Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). One of the most consistent findings is the involvement of Rap1 in integrin-mediated cell adhesion (8Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The cyclic AMP-EPAC-Rap1 pathway has been implicated in the control of cell spreading and cell adhesion through the α3β1 integrin (9Enserink J.M. Price L.S. Methi T. Mahic M. Sonnenberg A. Bos J.L. Tasken K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44889-44896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), whereas the cyclic AMP-EPAC-Rap2B pathway has been shown to control the activity of phospholipase Cϵ (10Schmidt M. Evellin S. Weernink P.A. von Dorp F. Rehmann H. Lomasney J.W. Jakobs K.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1020-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). We have recently discovered that EPACs can physically interact with light chain 2 (LC2) of the microtubule-associated protein 1A (MAP1A) (11Magiera M.M. Gupta M. Rundell C.J. Satish N. Ernens I. Yarwood S.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). MAP1A and LC2 are generated as a single mRNA in the same open reading frame and are translated as a pre-MAP1/LC2 polypeptide. The pre-MAP1A/LC2 protein is then proteolyzed to yield the 249-amino acid LC2 polypeptide and 2556-amino acid MAP1A protein (12Langkopf A. Hammarback J.A. Muller R. Vallee R.B. Garner C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16561-16566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LC2 has been shown to interact with the actin and microtubular cytoskeleton and has been shown to catalyze the polymerization of microtubules (13Noiges R. Eichinger R. Kutschera W. Fischer I. Nemeth Z. Wiche G. Propst F. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2106-2114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our identification of EPAC as a protein-binding partner for LC2 suggests that interaction with microtubules might be functionally important for EPAC activity. Indeed, this seems to be plausible in light of recent results from members of the Cheng laboratory (14Qiao J. Mei F.C. Popov V.L. Vergara L.A. Cheng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26581-26586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), who used immunolocalization to demonstrate that EPAC1 associates with the mitotic spindle during the M-phase of the COS7 cell cycle. LC2 may therefore serve as an “adaptor” protein promoting the interaction of EPAC with the microtubular cytoskeleton, perhaps to facilitate activation of Rap1 (13Noiges R. Eichinger R. Kutschera W.

In the present study we investigate the role of LC2 and the microtubule cytoskeleton in regulating the cyclic AMP-EPAC-Rap1 pathway. Materials—Anti-LC2 polyclonal antibody and rat LC2 cDNA were gifts from Professor Friedrich Propst, University of Vienna. Cyclic AMP-agarose was purchased from Sigma. Antibodies—Specific polyclonal antibodies against EPAC1 were generated and affinity-purified using the synthetic EPAC1 peptide spanning residues 41–60, (C)DFSESLEQASTERVLRAGR, by Alpha Diagnostic International Inc. (San Antonio, TX). Antibody elution fractions were stored at -70 °C. Polyclonal antibodies against the DEP and cAMP domains of EPAC1 were generated by Diagnostics Scotland (Carluke, Scotland) using fusion protein immunogens formed between glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the individual PCR-amplified domains as described (11Magiera M.M. Gupta M. Rundell C.J. Satish N. Ernens I. Yarwood S.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Generation of Expression Vectors—For simultaneous expression of Myc-tagged EPAC1 and LC2 in mammalian cells we used the pBUDCE4.1 (Invitrogen) vector. pBUD-EPAC1Myc/LC2 was generated by subcloning the full open reading frames for LC2 and EPAC1 into the EF-1α and cytomegalovirus multiple cloning sites of pBUDCE4.1, respectively. LC2 was inserted at the XhoI/KpnI site in the EF-1α multiple cloning site, and EPAC1 was inserted at the HindIII/XbaI site in the cytomegalovirus multiple cloning site. Growth of Cell Lines—HEK293 and COS1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 2 mm l-glutamine (Sigma), and a 2% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin solution (Sigma). PC12 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) horse serum (Sigma), 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and a 2% solution of penicillin-streptomycin. Rap1 Activation Assay—GST-RalGDS-RBD was used to determine the relative amount of active GTP-bound Rap1 as described previously (19McPhee I. Houslay M.D. Yarwood S.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Detergent extracts of whole cells were prepared by solubilization in 55 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 132 mm NaCl, 22 mm NaF, 11 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 containing complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cell extracts were incubated with 10 μg of immobilized GST-RalGDS-RBD for 60 min at 4 °C and then with 50 μl of GST for 1 h. The beads were then washed four times in lysis buffer followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-Rap1 antibody. Cyclic AMP-Agarose Pull-down Assay—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with either pBUD-EPAC1Myc or pBUD-EPAC1Myc/LC2 and then lysed in 55 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 132 mm NaCl, 22 mm sodium fluoride, 11 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1.1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. After equalizing the protein concentration using the Bradford assay, cell lysates were serially diluted at a ratio of 1:2 and then incubated with 50 μl of cyclic AMP-agarose beads on a rotator for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer, resuspended in sample buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Co-immunoprecipitation and Antibody Interference—COS1 or PC12 lysates (500 μg) were incubated with either 10 μl of anti-DEP or anti-cAMP antibody for 30 min followed by incubation for 30 min with 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP (100 μm). Thereafter the lysates were incubated with 50 μl of GST-RalGDS-RBD for 30 min and then with 50 μl of GST for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with Rap activation buffer, and proteins were eluted with sample buffer for analysis by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-Rap1 antibody. For co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous LC2 and endogenous EPAC1 lysates were incubated with either 5 μl of anti-LC2 antibody or control antibody for 30 min and then with 50 μlof protein A-Sepharose for 1 h. The beads were then recovered and washed three times with Rap activation buffer, and the proteins were eluted with sample buffer. Protein elutes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-EPAC1 and anti-LC2 antibodies. Cell Adhesion Assay—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with pBUD, pBUD-LC2, pBUD-EPAC1Myc, or pBUD-EPAC1Myc/LC2. On the day of the experiment, the cells were detached using trypsin-EDTA solution, and 10,000 cells were seeded onto the laminin-coated coverslips and allowed to adhere for different time intervals. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and then counted using bright field microscopy. Immunocytochemistry—COS1 cells were stimulated for 30 min with 10 μm nocodazole (Sigma) or 10 μm taxol (Sigma) and then washed with PBS at 4 °C and fixed in a 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde solution. Cells were then permeabilized in a 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 solution in PBS for 5 min at 4 °C and blocked with goat serum (0.1% (v/v) in PBS) and fish gelatin (0.2% (v/v) in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the anti-β-tubulin monoclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:250 in block solution. Cells were then washed three times in PBS and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-mouse Texas Red conjugate (Vector) diluted 1:200 in block solution. Cells were washed and mounted using Immu-Mount (Shandon) and visualized by confocal microscopy. SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—This was done as described previously (11Magiera M.M. Gupta M. Rundell C.J. Satish N. Ernens I. Yarwood S.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Measurement of Protein Concentrations—Protein concentrations were measured by the method of Bradford, using bovine serum albumin as a standard (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217370) Google Scholar). LC2 Enhances EPAC-activated Rap1—We recently identified by yeast two-hybrid screens LC2 as a protein interaction partner for EPAC (11Magiera M.M. Gupta M. Rundell C.J. Satish N. Ernens I. Yarwood S.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To test the functional consequences of this interaction in cells we generated pBUD expression vectors that allowed the expression of LC2 (pBUD-LC2 and Myc-tagged EPAC1 (pBUD-EPAC1Myc)) individually or synchronously (pBUD-EPAC1Myc/LC2) in mammalian HEK293 cells (Fig. 1A). LC2 has been reported to interact with microtubules in vivo and in vitro, and it induces rapid polymerization of tubulin (13Noiges R. Eichinger R. Kutschera W. Fischer I. Nemeth Z. Wiche G. Propst F. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2106-2114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of HEK293 cells with the microtubule depolymerizing agent nocadazole led to disruption of the microtubule network throughout the cell, resulting in a dispersed cytoplasmic staining pattern throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 1B). In contrast treatment of cells with taxol appeared to stabilize microtubules forming aggregated structures in cells (Fig. 1C). In cells expressing LC2, microtubule integrity was maintained despite treatment of cells with nocadazole (Fig. 1B). This is consistent with a previous report that LC2 is necessary for stabilization of microtubules (13Noiges R. Eichinger R. Kutschera W. Fischer I. Nemeth Z. Wiche G. Propst F. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2106-2114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of LC2 had little apparent effect on taxol-treated cells (Fig. 1B). Quantification of these experiments revealed that around 30% of cells expressing LC2 were protected against the depolymerizing effects of nocadazole. This equates to the degree of expression of LC2 in the culture population. We next tested the involvement of microtubule stability and LC2 expression on basal Rap1 activation by EPAC1. Cells were transfected with LC2, EPAC1, or a combination of the two, and Rap1 activity was measured using the RalGDS-RBD-GST pull-down assay described previously (19McPhee I. Houslay M.D. Yarwood S.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Interestingly we found that transfection with LC2 alone caused a small activation of Rap1 (Fig. 1, C and D). Given the ability of LC2 to stabilize microtubules, this suggests that Rap1 activity may be sensitive to microtubule stability. Transfection with EPAC1 gave a greater activation of Rap1 than LC2 (Fig. 1, C and D). The ability of EPAC1 to activate Rap1 independently of activation is probably due to a subpopulation of transfected EPAC1 being activated by endogenous cyclic AMP levels. The largest increase in basal Rap1 activation was observed following co-transfection of cells with both EPAC1 and LC2 (Fig. 1, C and D). This suggests that LC2 may enhance EPAC1 activity toward Rap1. To test an involvement of microtubules in the enhancement of EPAC1 activity by LC2, we pretreated cells with nocodazole, and this was found to abolish EPAC1-activated Rap1 but did not affect LC2-activated Rap1 (Fig. 1, C and D). Nocodazole only partially inhibited Rap1 activation by the combination of LC2 and EPAC1 (Fig. 1, C and D). Treatment with taxol had little effect on Rap1 activation (Fig. 1, C and D). This indicates that EPAC1 can increase basal Rap1 levels in a mechanism that involves polymerized microtubules. In addition, LC2 is capable of enhancing EPAC1 activity toward Rap1 and protecting EPAC-activated Rap1 from nocadazole treatment, probably through its ability to stabilize the cellular microtubule network (Fig. 1B). LC2 Enhances Activation of the EPAC1-Rap1 Pathway by 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP—We next sought to examine whether LC2 affects activation of Rap1 by the EPAC-specific cyclic AMP analogue, 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP (21Enserink J.M. Christensen A.E. de Rooij J. van Triest M. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Doskeland S.O. Blank J.L. Bos J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). We found that transfection of cells with pBUD-EPAC1Myc facilitated a small, ∼2–3-fold activation of Rap1 by 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP (Fig. 2, A and B). However, in cells transfected with a combination of EPAC1 and LC2 (pBUD-EPAC1Myc/LC2) we witnessed a very large, ∼100-fold activation of Rap1, equivalent to the levels achieved with the non-hydrolysable GTP analogue GTPγS (Fig. 2, A and B). This demonstrates that LC2 cooperates with EPAC1 to enhance Rap1 activation by 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP. We tested this further by examining the effect of different concentrations of 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP on Rap1 activation (Fig. 2C). We found that in EPAC1-transfected cells a small activation of Rap1 occurred at 1 μm 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP and was maximal at 100 μm (Fig. 2C). In contrast, in cells transfected with both EPAC1 and LC2, Rap1 activation was observed at lower concentrations of 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP (0.1 μm), and at maximal concentrations (100 μm) Rap1 activation was greater than that observed in cells transfected with EPAC1 alone (Fig. 2C). This suggests that LC2 not only increases the sensitivity of EPAC1 to activation by 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP but that it also increases maximal activation by this cyclic AMP analogue. We found that nocodazole had little effect on 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP-stimulated levels of Rap1 in pBUD-EPAC1Myc/LC2-transfected cells; however, it did disrupt stimulated Rap1 levels in pBUD-EPAC1Myc-transfected cells (Fig. 2D). This suggests that in addition to enhancing cyclic AMP-stimulated Rap1 levels, LC2 protects Rap1 activity against microtubule disruption. This is probably because of the ability of LC2 to stabilize the microtubular network (Fig. 1B). LC2 Enhances Interaction of EPAC1 with Cyclic AMP—We demonstrated previously that the interaction between EPAC1 and LC2 occurs through the cAMP-binding domain of EPAC1 (11Magiera M.M. Gupta M. Rundell C.J. Satish N. Ernens I. Yarwood S.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This led us to speculate that the enhancement of EPAC1 sensitivity to activation by 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP (Fig. 2C) elicited by LC2 might occur through modification of the conformation of the EPAC1 cAMP domain. To examine this we tested the ability of various concentrations of EPAC1 to interact in pull-down assays with cyclic AMP that had been immobilized on agarose beads (Fig. 3A). HEK293 cells were transfected with pBUD-EPAC1Myc or pBUD-EPAC1Myc/LC2, and various concentrations of cell lysates were precipitated with cyclic AMP-agarose (Fig. 3A). Cell lysates were also probed with anti-Myc antibody to show that coexpression with LC2 did not significantly affect the expression levels of EPAC1Myc (Fig. 3A). We found that half-maximal binding of EPAC1 to cyclic AMP was increased by approximately 1 order of magnitude in cells transfected with EPAC1 and LC2 compared with cells transfected with EPAC1 alone (Fig. 3, A and B). This suggests that LC2 can modify EPAC1 to enhance its interaction with cyclic AMP, which might explain why EPAC1 co-transfected with LC2 is activated at lower concentrations of 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP (Fig. 2C). We next tested whether expression of LC2 could affect the ability of EPAC1 endogenously expressed in COS1 cells to interact with cyclic AMP (Fig. 3, C and D). Expression of LC2 in COS1 cells did not affect the expression levels of endogenous EPAC1 as determined by immunoblotting cell lysates with a specific anti-peptide EPAC1 antibody (Fig. 3C). However, expression of LC2 in cells dramatically increased the ability of endogenous EPAC1 to interact with cyclic AMP (Fig. 3, C and D). Consistent with our EPAC1/LC2 coexpression experiments, LC2 enhanced the half-maximal binding of endogenous EPAC1 with cyclic AMP by approximately 1 order of magnitude (Fig. 3D). Together these results suggest that the ability of LC2 to enhance EPAC1-activated Rap1 may be through sensitizing EPAC1 to activation by cyclic AMP. Interaction between Endogenous EPAC1 and LC2 Is Required for Rap1 Activation—Thus far we had used co-transfection to demonstrate enhancement of EPAC1-activated Rap1 by LC2. We next decided to test the significance of interaction between endogenous EPAC1 and LC2. Because LC2 interacts with EPAC1 through the EPAC1 cAMP domain we generated anti-cAMP polyclonal antibody and tested its ability to inhibit interaction between EPAC1 and LC2 in PC12 cell lysates (Fig. 4A). Cell lysates were prepared from PC12 cells, which express both EPAC1 and LC2 (Fig. 4A), and then incubated with the anti-cAMP antibody or an anti-DEP domain antibody as a control (Fig. 4A). These antibodies had previously been found to recognize EPAC1 by immunoblotting but were unable to immunoprecipitate endogenous EPAC1 (results not shown). Next, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-LC2 antibody, and immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-EPAC1 and anti-LC2 antibodies (Fig. 4A). Immunoblots revealed that endogenous EPAC1 co-precipitated with LC2; however, incubation with the anti-cAMP antibody blocked the interaction between EPAC1 and LC2 (Fig. 4A). This is consistent with the cAMP domain being responsible for the interaction between LC2 and EPAC1 (11Magiera M.M. Gupta M. Rundell C.J. Satish N. Ernens I. Yarwood S.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In contrast the anti-DEP antibody did not affect the interaction between EPAC1 and LC2 (Fig. 4A). We next tested whether antibody competition for LC2 binding to EPAC1 could affect Rap1 activation. Cell lysates were prepared from PC12 cells, which express both EPAC1 and LC2 (Fig. 4A), or COS1 cells, which express EPAC1 (Fig. 3C) but not LC2 (results not shown). These were then incubated with anti-cAMP or anti-DEP antibodies and then stimulated with diluent or 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP (Fig. 4, B and C). Rap1 activity was then measured using the RalGDS-RBP-GST pull-down assay (19McPhee I. Houslay M.D. Yarwood S.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Stimulation with 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP prompted an ∼2-fold activation of Rap1 in PC12 cell lysates; however, Rap1 activity in COS1 cell lysates was hardly affected (Fig. 4, B and C). Incubation of PC12 cell lysates with the anti-cAMP antibody, which inhibits interaction between EPAC1 and LC2 (Fig. 4A), completely abolished basal Rap1 levels and prevented further activation by 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP (Fig. 4, B and C). Pretreatment of PC12 cell lysates with the anti-DEP antibody, which did not affect the interaction between EPAC1 and LC2 (Fig. 4A), also had no effect on basal or stimulated Rap1 levels. In contrast, treatment of COS1 cell lysates, which do not express LC2, with the anti-cAMP antibody did not affect basal or stimulated Rap1 levels. These results demonstrate that inhibition of endogenous LC2 interaction with endogenous EPAC1 prevents the ability of EPAC1 to activate Rap1. Together with the previous co-transfection experiments this suggests that LC2 is an important enhancer of EPAC1 activity toward Rap1. EPAC and LC2 Cooperate to Enhance Cell Adhesion to Laminin—It has been reported recently that the cyclic AMP-EPAC-Rap1 pathway regulates cell adhesion to laminin through the α3β1 integrin (9Enserink J.M. Price L.S. Methi T. Mahic M. Sonnenberg A. Bos J.L. Tasken K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44889-44896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Given that LC2 appears to enhance EPAC1-activated Rap1 (Fig. 2C) we examined whether this is translated into effects on cell adhesion. Consistent with the effects observed on Rap1 activation, we found that maximal cell adhesion was seen in HEK293 cells stimulated with 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP and co-transfected with both LC2 and EPAC (Fig. 5A). Approximately 30% more cell adhesion was seen in these cells compared with cells transfected with EPAC1 alone (Fig. 5A). We also tested the effects of nocadazole and taxol in regulating cell adhesion. We found again, consistent with our observations of Rap1 activation, that nocadazole, but not taxol, blunted cell adhesion in EPAC1-transfected cells but not in cells transfected with LC2 alone or LC2 plus EPAC1 (Fig. 5A). This effect is probably because of the ability of LC2 to stabilize microtubules in the presence of nocadazole (Fig. 1B) and suggests that an intact microtubular cytoskeleton is required for proper cell adhesion. We also found in cells transfected with the pBUD vector alone that 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP stimulation approximately doubled the amount of cell adhesion to laminin, and this was severely inhibited by nocadazole (Fig. 5A). We were surprised by this result because we had previously found that there was no detectable Rap1 activation in pBUD-transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 2D). This suggests either that 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP can promote cell adhesion independently of Rap1 or that very low levels of Rap1 activity, below the level of sensitivity of our activation assay, are required to promote cell adhesion. To confirm that Rap1 controls cell adhesion in these cells we transfected cells with constitutively active Rap1V12 and dominant negative Rap1N17 (22Cook S.J. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Transfection with Rap1V12 was found to enhance cell adhesion to laminin in the presence or absence of 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP, whereas Rap1N17 dramatically inhibited cell adhesion (Fig. 5B). Importantly Rap1N17 inhibited the promotion of cell adhesion promoted by treatment of cells with 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP (Fig. 5B). Together with our Rap1 activity data (Fig. 2D) this supports the idea that activation of very low levels of endogenous Rap1 is sufficient to promote cell adhesion. Together these results demonstrated that Rap1 is a key determinant in the regulation of cell adhesion in these cells. Moreover, the enhancement of signal transduction through the cyclic AMP-EPAC-Rap1 pathway by LC2 has functional consequences for cell behavior. We demonstrated previously that LC2 interacts directly with the cyclic AMP-binding domain of EPAC1 (11Magiera M.M. Gupta M. Rundell C.J. Satish N. Ernens I. Yarwood S.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the present study we have found that co-transfection of cells with LC2 and EPAC1 enhances the ability of 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP to activate Rap1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). Moreover, through its reported ability to stabilize microtubules (13Noiges R. Eichinger R. Kutschera W. Fischer I. Nemeth Z. Wiche G. Propst F. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2106-2114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), LC2 appears to protect Rap1 activation from the disruptive effects of nocadazole treatment (Fig. 1, C and D). Our results suggest that microtubule stability is critical for EPAC1 to be able to activate Rap1. The ability of LC2 to protect EPAC1-activated Rap1 activity may be important in cells where differences in spatial stability and dynamics of the microtubular cytoskeleton may be essential for critical cell processes, for example, in neuron development. In addition, LC2 may also play a role in maintaining EPAC1 activity during mitosis because EPAC1 has been reported to associate with the microtubules of the mitotic spindle (14Qiao J. Mei F.C. Popov V.L. Vergara L.A. Cheng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26581-26586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In addition to its effects on microtubule stability LC2 appears to have direct effects on the ability of EPAC1 to activate Rap1. This appears to be through direct interaction with EPAC1 because antibody competition for the binding of endogenous LC2 to the cyclic AMP-binding domain of endogenous EPAC1 was shown to completely ablate basal and 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP-stimulated Rap1 levels in PC12 cell lysates (Fig. 4, A and B). Furthermore, our data suggest that the amplification of stimulated Rap1 levels by LC2 may be through as yet undetermined conformational changes in the cyclic AMP-binding domain of EPAC1. This is based on two lines of evidence. First, co-transfection of LC2 with EPAC1 lowers the minimal dose of EPAC-specific 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP required to activate Rap1 (Fig. 2B). Second, LC2 appears to enhance the ability of the cyclic AMP-binding domain of EPAC1 to directly interact with immobilized cyclic AMP (Fig. 2C). LC2 therefore appears to be an enhancer of EPAC1 function by increasing sensitivity to activation by cyclic AMP. In this respect the cyclic AMP-binding domain of EPAC1 is thought to have a lower sensitivity to cyclic AMP than PKA in vivo (23Bos J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Half-maximal activation of PKA occurs in vitro at around 1 μm cyclic AMP, whereas half-maximal activation of EPAC1 occurs at 40 μm (23Bos J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). It could be envisaged that through direct protein interaction with suitable binding partners like LC2, the activation of EPAC1 by cyclic AMP could be “tuned” to sensitivities approaching those of PKA. This could occur in a tissue-specific manner, thereby adapting the cyclic AMP-EPAC1-Rap1 pathway to the requirements of particular cell types. Careful structural analysis of the LC2/EPAC1 interaction domain will have to be carried out to determine the mechanisms of LC2 enhancement of EPAC1 function."

Two unrelated isomerases have been identified, RpiA and RpiB, with different structures and active site residues. The reaction catalyzed by both enzymes is thought to proceed via a high energy enediolate intermediate, by analogy to other carbohydrate isomerases. Here we present studies of RpiB from Mycobacterium tuberculosis together with small molecules designed to resemble the enediolate intermediate. The relative affinities of these inhibitors for RpiB have a different pattern than that observed previously for the RpiA from spinach. X-ray structures of RpiB in complex with the inhibitors 4-phospho-d-erythronohydroxamic acid (Km 57 μm) and 4-phospho-d-erythronate (Ki 1.7 mm) refined to resolutions of 2.1 and 2.2 Å, respectively, allowed us to assign roles for most active site residues. These results, combined with docking of the substrates in the position of the most effective inhibitor, now allow us to outline the reaction mechanism for RpiBs. Both enzymes have residues that can catalyze opening of the furanose ring of the ribose 5-phosphate and so can improve the efficiency of the reaction. Both enzymes also have an acidic residue that acts as a base in the isomerization step. A lysine residue in RpiAs provides for more efficient stabilization of the intermediate than the corresponding uncharged groups of RpiBs; this same feature lies behind the more efficient binding of RpiA to 4-phospho-d-erythronate.

The reaction is involved in the pentose phosphate pathway and in the Calvin cycle of plants. Mutant studies in Escherichia coli have shown that Rpi activity is important in bacterial growth (1Sorensen K.I. Hove-Jensen B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1003-1011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent medical study has further revealed that a deficiency in human Rpi causes destruction of myelin sheaths (leukoencephalopathy), which in turn leads to extensive brain abnormalities (2Huck J.H.

Two nonhomologous Rpis have been identified and designated as RpiA and RpiB. The former type is most common, occurring in all three kingdoms of life. RpiBs have so far only been found in the genomes of some bacteria and protozoa (3Zhang R.-G. Andersson C.E. Skarina T. Evdokimova E. Edwards A.M. Joachimiak A. Savchenko A. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 1083-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Genes encoding both classes of enzymes are present in some bacterial species, including E. coli (4David J. Wiesmeyer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 208: 56-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 5Essenberg M.K. Cooper R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 55: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The two E. coli enzymes have been shown to have very different structures and active site residues, indicating that they represent an example of independent evolution (3Zhang R.-G. Andersson C.E. Skarina T. Evdokimova E. Edwards A.M. Joachimiak A. Savchenko A. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 1083-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 6Zhang R. Andersson C.E. Savchenko A.

We have more recently solved the structure of RpiB from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtRpiB) and demonstrated that it can catalyze the isomerization of R5P and Ru5P with an efficiency very similar to that of the E. coli RpiB, despite differences in the active site residues (7Roos A.K. Andersson C.E. Bergfors T. Jacobsson M. Karlen A. Unge T. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As for most isomerases, the reaction catalyzed by Rpis is believed to proceed through an enediolate intermediate (Fig. 1). By comparisons of the two RpiB structures and by docking experiments, roles for the various residues in this class of enzyme were proposed (7Roos A.K. Andersson C.E. Bergfors T. Jacobsson M. Karlen A. Unge T. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, the catalytic mechanism could not actually be established from this information alone. The present paper describes an investigation of the binding of MtRpiB to several inhibitors that mimic the high energy intermediate of the isomerization reaction (Fig. 1). X-ray structures for two of these inhibitors, 4-phospho-d-erythronohydroxamic acid (4PEH) and 4-phospho-d-erythronate (4PEA), in complex with MtRpiB are also presented. The combined data allow a much more complete understanding of the reaction mechanism of RpiBs. Protein Purification—The MtRpiB protein was cloned, overexpressed, and purified as described previously (7Roos A.K. Andersson C.E. Bergfors T. Jacobsson M. Karlen A. Unge T. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with the exception that the final purification step (size exclusion chromatography) was performed with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA. The purified protein was concentrated to 24 mg/ml and stored in the same buffer with 40 mm NaCl, at 4 °C or at –80 °C. Kinetic Assays—The inhibitory capacity of five different reaction intermediate analogs (illustrated in Fig. 1) toward MtRpiB was tested using a spectrophotometric assay (8Wood T. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 33: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) where the conversion of R5P to Ru5P was monitored directly as a change in absorbance at 290 nm. The 1-ml reactions (in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) were followed for 5 min at room temperature (∼22 °C) after the addition of 90 nmMtRpiB. Kinetic constants were obtained from Hanes-Woolf plots. Where possible, Ki values were estimated from a series of different R5P concentrations at three different inhibitor concentrations. A Km value for each inhibitor concentration was obtained and entered into a new plot of the observed Km versus inhibitor concentration. The x intercept, which is equal to –Ki, was determined by linear regression. For substances showing weak inhibition, only IC50 values could be acquired. These were measured using a constant substrate concentration of 5 mm, chosen close to the Km for maximum sensitivity. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Data Processing and Refinement—The protein was cocrystallized with inhibitors by vapor diffusion in hanging drops including 1 μl of protein and 1 μl of reservoir solution at 20 °C. Inhibitor and protein solutions were mixed 15 min prior to setting up the crystallization drops. MtRpiB (17 mg/ml, 0.49 mm) with 3mm 4PEH was crystallized with 1.55 m ammonium phosphate and 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5. MtRpiB (12 mg/ml, 0.35 mm) with 50 mm 4PEA was crystallized with 1.65 m ammonium phosphate, 0.1 m MES, pH 6. Needle-like crystals of dimensions 0.2 × 0.05 × 0.05 mm3 appeared after ∼2 weeks. Before flash cooling in liquid nitrogen the crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant consisting of reservoir solution plus 25% glycerol. X-ray data were collected at 100 K (Oxford Cryosystems) at beamlines BM14 (4PEH data) and ID29 (4PEA data), both at ESRF, Grenoble. All data were indexed with MOSFLM (9Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr.

Repeated rounds of refinement, rebuilding, and addition of waters with ARP/wARP (14Perrakis A. Sixma T.K. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Structural Comparisons and Interpretations of Ligand Interactions— The two inhibitor-complex structures were compared with each other and with the previously published phosphate complex structure in O. This program was also used to dock the β-furanose and open chain forms of R5P manually in the position of the 4PEH inhibitor, using the phosphate groups and the two carbon atoms adjacent to them as a guide. Figures were created with O, Molray (15Harris M. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect D. 2001; 57: 1201-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), ChemDraw (CambridgeSoft Corp.), and Canvas (Deneba Systems, Inc.). Deposition of Data—Atomic coordinates and structure factor data for the two complex structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (16Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27935) Google Scholar) with the entry codes 2BES and 2BET. Enzymatic Activity—The inhibition studies of 4PEH and 4PEA are illustrated in Fig. 2; binding data for these and other inhibitors are summarized in Table II. The results indicate that 4PEH binds ∼30 times more tightly than 4PEA. 4-Phospho-d-erythronamide (4PEAm), 4-phospho-d-erythronhydrazide (4PEHz), and 4-phosphonomethyl-d-erythronate (4PMEA) showed still weaker inhibition, and so for these compounds only IC50 values were obtained (although a Ki for 4PMEA could be estimated from the IC50 and is included in Table II).Table IIInhibition dataCompoundR5P (Km)4PEH (Ki)4PEA (Ki)4PEAm (Ki)4PEHz (Ki)4PMEA (Ki)mMmMmMmMmMmMMtRpiB1.80.0571.7NDND∼2.0(0.040)(6.0)(>30)(>35)(∼12)Spinach7.50.0290.0282.51.80.074RpiA(0.018)(0.010)(1.8)(1.8)(0.11) Open table in a new tab Complex Structures—The 4PEH complex structure was refined to 2.1 Å resolution and the 4PEA complex structure to 2.2 Å (see Table I). Both show density starting at residues 2–3 and ending at 158–160 (of 172, including the 10 residues of the His tag). MtRpiB forms a functional dimer as reported previously (7Roos A.K. Andersson C.E. Bergfors T. Jacobsson M. Karlen A. Unge T. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), with the two active sites of a dimer receiving contributions from both subunits (Fig. 3). Each asymmetric unit in the crystal contains two complete dimers; a fifth subunit is present which forms a dimer through crystallographic symmetry. Thus there are five independent observations of the MtRpiB active site for each complex structure determined. The electron density observed in the active sites of the 4PEH structure was consistently stronger than that for the 4PEA complex, although the density for the latter was clear (compare Fig. 4, A and B); this observation is in accordance with the tighter binding of the 4PEH ligand (Table II). Both complex structures were obtained in the presence of ∼1.5 m phosphate, which has previously been shown to inhibit MtRpiB with a Ki of 130 mm (7Roos A.K. Andersson C.E. Bergfors T. Jacobsson M. Karlen A. Unge T. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Clearly, the weaker affinity of the 4PEA ligand makes it more difficult for it to compete, even when it is included at 50 mm in the crystallization. Calculations suggest that a significant fraction (∼30%) of the MtRpiB molecules is still bound to phosphate in the observed 4PEA structures. A mixed population is further suggested by the higher temperature factors of the ligands/protein in the 4PEA models (Table I), as well as by the slightly higher temperature factors (by ∼5 Å2) for atoms at the nonphosphate end of the 4PEA ligands.Fig. 4Inhibitor binding to RpiB. Electron densities (using SIGMAA-weighted maps contoured at 1 σ) for the two ligands, 4PEH (A) and 4PEA (B), are shown together with the residues of the active site believed to be important for enzymatic activity. The A molecule is a darker shade of gray than the B molecule. Water molecules are presented as small gray spheres. In C and D, the hydrogen bonding interactions observed in the active sites (cut-off distance 3.2 Å) are shown for the 4PEH and 4PEA complexes, respectively. The distances reported here from the A/B dimers are very similar to those observed in the other active sites.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Comparison of Complex Structures—When the A/B dimers of the two inhibitor complex structures are compared by superpositioning of Cα atoms, it can be seen that these structures are very similar. The root mean square distance between them is 0.13 Å when 310 of the 314 Cα atoms of the A subunits are compared, within the expected experimental error; the slight differences observed are restricted to the extreme N and C termini. Similar results are obtained when evaluating the other molecules in the asymmetric unit. Comparing either of the two inhibitor complex structures with the original phosphate complex gives slightly higher root mean square distances, ∼0.19 Å with ∼300 Cα atoms matching. The largest differences in these cases are seen in the A, C, and E molecules. Here, the N and C termini are seen to move slightly, and four loops close to the active site (generally 11–13, 41–44, 69, 111–112) are shifted by 0.4–0.7 Å, causing the active site residues to come closer to the bound inhibitor. Ligand Interactions—Both 4PEA and 4PEH are bound in a similar fashion in the active site (Fig. 4). In each case, the phosphate group is placed at the same position as the phosphate in the original structure. In this location, it is largely exposed to the solvent; the other ends of the inhibitors point into a deep pocket in the enzyme. For one active site of the A/B dimer in the 4PEH complex, hydrogen bonds to the phosphate are contributed by residues His12 and Arg113 in the A molecule, and arginines 137 and 141 in the B molecule. Two water molecules are also in close proximity to the phosphate oxygens (one bound to Ala42 from the A molecule, and Arg141 from the B molecule, and one close to Arg113, A molecule). In the 4PEA complex structure the same residues interact with the phosphate in a very similar fashion (compare Fig. 4, C and D). The only (and small) difference is that Arg113 has a lower occupancy for this orientation and could be taking on an alternate conformation in some molecules of the asymmetric unit, as had been observed in the original phosphate complex structure. In the B, D, and E molecules this side chain clearly points toward the phosphate, but in the A and C molecules, the second conformation also appears to exist. Moving deeper into the active site, the hydroxyl group on C3 of 4PEH (which corresponds to C4 of the open chain form of the substrate) interacts with His102 and a water molecule, which in turn is within hydrogen bonding distance of His138. In 4PEA the distance to His102 is longer (and presumably the interaction is weaker). The C2 hydroxyl group of 4PEH (corresponding to O3 of the substrate) interacts with the nitrogen backbone of Gly70 and the side chain of Asp11. In 4PEA, this same sugar hydroxyl group interacts with Asp11 and Glu75. The terminal groups of 4PEH, which were designed to mimic the 1,2-cis-enediolate moiety of the intermediate of the isomerization reaction, have strong hydrogen bonds to the backbone nitrogens of residues 71 and 74. C1 of the substrate corresponds to the nitrogen atom of the hydroxamic moiety, which is situated 3.1 Å away from one carboxylate oxygen of Glu75. The other carboxylate oxygen of this same residue is close to both the amino group of the ligand and the hydroxyl group attached to it. The side chain of Ser71 is also seen to interact with the N-OH oxygen of 4PEH; it is slightly more distant (3.3 Å) from the O1 of 4PEH which replaces O2 of the substrate. By contrast, there are few interactions between protein and the anionic group at the equivalent position in the 4PEA complex structure. Only one strong hydrogen bond is observed, that from one of the carboxylate oxygens to a water molecule. A longer hydrogen bond links this same atom to the backbone amide nitrogen of Ser71. Other distances to main chain nitrogens in the 70–74 loop region are longer, in the range of 3.4 Å. The Ser71 side chain is generally 3.4 Å from the OH group (although in the D and E molecules a better H-bond of ∼3.1 Å is formed), and both Glu75 carboxylate oxygens are situated ∼3.4 Å away. The latter is not surprising, given the likely repulsion of groups bearing the same charge. In two molecules of the asymmetric unit the amide nitrogen of the Asn103 side chain is drawn closer to one of the carboxylate oxygens. Docking of Substrates—The β-anomer of the furanose form of R5P was placed manually in the position of 4PEH, using the equivalent atoms of 4PEH as a guide (Fig. 5). This docking suggests that the furanose ring will be tilted toward His102 and His138, positioning the C1 hydroxyl group within hydrogen bonding distance of His138. In this way, the substrate is positioned correctly to use these histidines as catalysts for the ring opening step of the reaction. Docking of the α-anomer, on the other hand, brings the hydroxyl group close to Asn103 and is thus not consistent with this catalytic step. When the open chain form is docked in the same fashion, the O1 and O2 groups are placed close to the side chains of Ser71 and Glu75. Isomerization of R5P to Ru5P probably requires the open chain form of the sugar. Although a mechanism can be envisioned in which both isomerization and ring opening of cyclic R5P occur in a concerted manner, leading directly to the enediolate intermediate species, we believe this is very unlikely because of the much lower acidity of the C2 hydrogen in cyclic compared with linear R5P. Kinetic studies of the unrelated spinach RpiA (17Jung C.H. Hartman F.C. Lu T.Y. Larimer F.W. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) suggested that this enzyme binds the furanose form and assists in its opening, a conclusion that was supported by structural studies combined with computer docking (7Roos A.K. Andersson C.E. Bergfors T. Jacobsson M. Karlen A. Unge T. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Because the α- and β-furanose forms are more plentiful in solution than the linear aldehyde (18Pierce J. Serianni A.S. Barker R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 2448-2456Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar), ring opening by the enzymes would have clear advantages for efficient processing of substrate, providing that this ring opening step is not rate-determining. Based on the results reported here, we propose that the fully conserved histidines 102 and 138 of MtRpiB are involved in this first step and that the true substrate of the enzyme is the β-furanose, as illustrated in Fig. 6. The hydroxyl group on C3 of 4PEH, which corresponds to the cyclic O4 oxygen of the furanose ring, interacts with His102 and a water molecule (Fig. 4). A similar hypothesis was put forward for phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI), i.e. that the ring opening of 6-phospho-β-d-fructofuranose is catalyzed by His388 (19Lee J.H. Chang K.Z. Patel V. Jeffery C.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7799-7805Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Further, the docking of a β-furanose form of R5P in MtRpiB (Fig. 5) shows that O1 is placed ∼3 Å from His138, in the same place that the water molecule is observed in the 4PEH structure. His138 is therefore an excellent candidate for the base that accepts a proton from O1. After the ring has been opened, a water molecule could quickly move into the position vacated by the sugar oxygen (as observed in the 4PEH structure). His138 could then use this water to return a proton to His102 in the last step of catalysis, so regenerating the active form of the enzyme. Docking the α-furanose form of R5P brings O1 close to Asn103, a residue that cannot act as a base, leading to the conclusion that the β-furanose is a more likely substrate for the enzyme. The residues of the protein that catalyze isomerization are clearly identified by the hydroxamic moiety of the 4PEH inhibitor in which the two oxygen atoms are cis to each other. This group interacts mainly with an anion hole consisting of backbone amide nitrogens from residues 70 to 74, as well as the side chain of Glu75. Thus Glu75 is in an excellent position to act as the catalytic base that transfers a proton between C1 and C2 of the substrates R5P and Ru5P (Fig. 6). As reported previously for Glu165 in the triose-phosphate isomerase (TIM)-phosphoglycolohydroxamic acid complex structure (20Davenport R.C. Bash P.A. Seaton B.A. Karplus M. Petsko G.A. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5821-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and in contrast to Glu357 in the PGI-5-phospho-d-arabinonohydroxamic acid structure (21Arsenieva D. Hardré R. Salmon L. Jeffery C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5872-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the plane of the carboxylate moiety of Glu75 is roughly perpendicular to the plane of the 4PEH hydroxamic function (Fig. 7). If the Ru5P substrate binds in the same way as 4PEH, the pro-R hydrogen on C1 would be transferred to the syn sp2 orbital of one of the carboxylate oxygens (Oϵ1orOϵ2) of Glu75. The syn orbitals, which have been reported to be orders of magnitude more basic than the anti orbitals (22Gandour R.D. Bioorg. Chem. 1981; 10: 169-176Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar), are in the plane of the carboxylate group and point inward, whereas the anti orbitals point outward, as observed for the two corresponding TIM and PGI structures mentioned above. In the MtRpiB·4PEH structure, Ser71 interacts with the oxygen atoms of the 4PEH hydroxamic function through three hydrogen bonds. In addition, the oxygen atom of the side chain of Ser71 and the hydroxamic acid function are in the same plane, as observed previously for the nitrogen atom of His95 in the TIM-phosphoglycolohydroxamic acid complex and the water molecule Wat241 in the PGI-5-phospho-d-arabinonohydroxamic acid complex (Fig. 7). His95 of TIM has been implicated in the proton transfer between the oxygen atoms O1 and O2 of the high energy intermediate 1,2-cis-enediolate through its imidazole/imidazolate couple, and Wat241 through its H2O/OH– couple in PGI (21Arsenieva D. Hardré R. Salmon L. Jeffery C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5872-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The remarkable overlap of Ser71, His95, and Wat241 is depicted in Fig. 7 for the three corresponding structures. Therefore, we propose that Ser71 has a similar role through its Ser-OH/Ser-O– couple, i.e. that it catalyzes proton transfer between O1 and O2 of the enediolate high energy intermediate in MtRpiB (Fig. 6). This serine is highly conserved, or replaced with the similar threonine, in all RpiBs so far identified (3Zhang R.-G. Andersson C.E. Skarina T. Evdokimova E. Edwards A.M. Joachimiak A. Savchenko A. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 1083-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Roos A.K. Andersson C.E. Bergfors T. Jacobsson M. Karlen A. Unge T. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), underlining its functional importance. The main chain nitrogen atoms in the 70–74 region form an anion hole that is expected to assist catalysis by stabilizing the transient negative charges during the reaction. In the fourth step of the reaction Glu75 donates a proton to the Re face of C1, thus creating the double bonded O2 of the ketose, Ru5P. His102 then donates its hydrogen to O4 but quickly recovers one from His138 via a water molecule, and the catalytic cycle is complete. In the reverse reaction, that converting Ru5P to R5P, the same steps will occur, with the exception that the ring opening step is not needed in this direction. In the E. coli RpiB, a change in the active site is observed, such that a cysteine residue will take on the role of Glu75. However, we anticipate that this enzyme will use the same reaction mechanism in other respects. 4PEA binds more weakly to MtRpiB (Table II), largely by virtue of a reduced number of hydrogen bonding interactions with the protein (Fig. 4). 4PEH was in fact designed to look more like the cis-enediolate intermediate than 4PEA and accordingly to be a better inhibitor of Rpi. Surprisingly, both of these compounds inhibit spinach RpiA equally well, with Ki values of ∼30 μm at pH 7.5 (see Table II and Ref. 23Burgos E. Salmon L. Tetrahedron Lett. 2004; 45: 753-756Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The similarity in their binding to RpiA could be explained by the presence of a lysine in the active site (Lys94 in the E. coli RpiA), which has been proposed to stabilize the high energy intermediate (6Zhang R. Andersson C.E. Savchenko A. Skarina T. Evdokimova E. Beasley S. Arrowsmith C.H. Edwards A.M. Joachimiak A. Mowbray S.L. Structure (Lond.). 2003; 11: 31-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). No positively charged group is found in an equivalent position in RpiB, and therefore the negatively charged 4PEA is not a good inhibitor. More effective stabilization of the reaction intermediate via the lysine of RpiA could also account for the observed difference in catalytic rate of the two enzymes; the kcat of RpiA is ∼2,100 s–1 (6Zhang R. Andersson C.E. Savchenko A. Skarina T. Evdokimova E. Beasley S. Arrowsmith C.H. Edwards A.M. Joachimiak A. Mowbray S.L. Structure (Lond.). 2003; 11: 31-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), whereas the kcat of MtRpiB is only ∼120 s–1 (7Roos A.K. Andersson C.E. Bergfors T. Jacobsson M. Karlen A. Unge T. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It was noted that there is no hydrogen bond between MtRpiB and the phosphate oxygen linked to C4 of the inhibitors. This observation led us to conclude that a replacement of this oxygen of the inhibitor by a methylene group, giving the hydrolytically stable analog, 4PMEA, should not significantly impair binding to the active site of the enzymes. As established previously for spinach RpiA (24Burgos E. Salmon L. Tetrahedron Lett. 2004; 45: 3465-3469Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar), kinetic results show that 4PMEA inhibits MtRpiB almost as well as 4PEA (Ki of ∼2 mm, see Table II). As for PGI, where 5-phospho-d-arabinonamide and 5-phospho-d-arabinonhydrazide were reported to inhibit the enzyme poorly (25Hardré R. Salmon L. Carbohydr. Res. 1999; 318: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), compounds 4PEAm and 4PEHz are weak inhibitors of spinach RpiA and are even worse inhibitors of MtRpiB. Both 4PEH and 4PEHz appear to be good structural mimics of the 1,2-cis-enediolate intermediate, in contrast to 4PEA and 4PEAm, which are shorter by 1 unit. However, the pKa of a hydroxamic acid is about 9.5 versus more than 15 for a hydrazide, which makes the former group much more easily ionized. Therefore, our results suggest that both structural analogy and ionization of the small molecule are important for good inhibition. In summary, kinetic and structural results now allow a good understanding of the mechanistic action of MtRpiB. Comparisons with the available data for an unrelated class of isomerases, the RpiAs, provide further insights into the observed differences, and similarities, in the behavior of those enzymes."

However, the insulin signaling pathway to the glucagon gene is unknown. Protein kinase B (PKB) is a key regulator of insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis. Impaired PKB function leads to insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus. Therefore, the role of PKB in the regulation of glucagon gene transcription was investigated. After transient transfections of glucagon promoter-reporter genes into a glucagon-producing islet cell line, the use of kinase inhibitors indicated that the inhibition of glucagon gene transcription by insulin depends on phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase. Furthermore, insulin caused a PI 3-kinase-dependent phosphorylation and activation of PKB in this cell line as revealed by phospho-immunoblotting and kinase assays. Overexpression of constitutively active PKB mimicked the effect of insulin on glucagon gene transcription. Both insulin and PKB responsiveness of the glucagon promoter were abolished when the binding sites for the transcription factor Pax6 within the G1 and G3 promoter elements were mutated. Recruitment of Pax6 or its potential coactivator, the CREB-binding protein (CBP), to G1 and G3 by using the GAL4 system restored both insulin and PKB responsiveness. These data suggest that insulin inhibits glucagon gene transcription by signaling via PI 3-kinase and PKB, with the transcription factor Pax6 and its potential coactivator CBP being critical components of the targeted promoter-specific nucleoprotein complex.

The present data emphasize the importance of PKB in insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis by defining the glucagon gene as a novel target gene for PKB. The pancreatic islet hormones insulin and glucagon are biologic antagonists in the regulation of blood glucose concentration. Insulin is known to increase peripheral glucose uptake and oppose hepatic glucose production. In contrast, glucagon balances the effect of insulin on blood glucose levels by increasing hepatic glucose production and opposing hepatic glucose storage (1Lefebvre P.J. Diabetes Care. 1995; 18: 715-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 2Unger R.H. Orci L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1981; 304: 1518-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 3Unger R.H. Orci L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1981; 304: 1575-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). As the glucagon-producing α-cells are mainly located in the peripheral regions of the islets of Langerhans surrounding the insulin-producing β-cells, they are exposed to high concentrations of insulin (1Lefebvre P.J. Diabetes Care. 1995; 18: 715-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 2Unger R.H. Orci L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1981; 304: 1518-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 3Unger R.H. Orci L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1981; 304: 1575-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Acting directly on α-cells, insulin inhibits glucagon secretion as well as glucagon gene transcription (4Philippe J. J. Clin. Investig. 1989; 84: 672-677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition of glucagon gene transcription by insulin depends on the paired domain transcription factor Pax6, which binds to the G1 and G3 element within the glucagon gene promoter (5Grzeskowiak R. Amin J. Oetjen E. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30037-30045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Pax6 binding to the G1 element within the glucagon promoter also confers responsiveness of the glucagon gene to thiazolidinediones, a novel class of insulin-sensitizing drugs (6Schinner S. Dellas C.

The paracrine inhibition of glucagon gene transcription by insulin is an important mechanism in the regulation of blood glucose concentrations. Consequently, in diabetic patients a relative hyperglucagonemia has been described that contributes to hyperglycemia in these patients (1Lefebvre P.J.

The elevated glucagon levels may be explained by the loss of insulin-mediated inhibition of glucagon synthesis and secretion.

Nauck M.A. Diabetes Care. 1996; 19: 580-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), the signal transduction mechanisms linking the insulin receptor to the promoter of the glucagon gene have not been characterized yet. Given the essential role of PKB in maintaining glucose homeostasis, we investigated the potential role of PKB in the insulin-dependent repression of glucagon gene transcription. We found the effect of insulin on the promoter of the glucagon gene to be mediated via the activation of PI 3-kinase. At the same time, insulin activated, in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner, PKB, which could mimic the effect of insulin. Furthermore, the transcription factor Pax6 and the coactivator CBP were found to be critically involved in this process. These data emphasize the importance of PKB in mediating biological effects of insulin and in establishing glucose homeostasis by defining the glucagon gene as a novel target gene for PKB.

The plasmid pCMV-GFPtpz was purchased from Canberra-Packard (Dreieich, Germany). The expression vector encoding myr-PKB was used to generate an expression vector encoding myr-PKB-K179M by site-directed mutagenesis (Quik-Change XL kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, California). The construct was confirmed by sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection of DNA—The glucagon-producing pancreatic islet cell line InR1-G9 was grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (28Schwaninger M.

Cotransfections were carried out with a constant amount of DNA, which was maintained by adding the Bluescript vector (Stratagene). In all experiments, 0.5 μg of cytomegalovirus-GFP (plasmid pCMV-GFPtpz) per 6-cm dish were cotransfected to check for transfection efficiency (the relative luciferase activities presented in the figures are derived from luciferase/GFP ratios). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were incubated in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and antibiotics as described above. When indicated, cells were treated with insulin (10 nm) for 23 h before harvest. Kinase inhibitors were added, when indicated, 0.5 h before insulin. Cell extracts (28Schwaninger M. Lux G. Blume R.

In brief, cells were lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm Na3VO4, 30 mm Na4P2O7, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 nm okadaic acid), and the enzyme activity in the immunoprecipitates obtained with PKB antibodies was assayed with [γ-32P]ATP using the glycogen synthase kinase-3 peptide (GRPRTSSFAEG) as a substrate for phosphorylation. The phosphorylated peptide was separated from free [γ-32P]ATP on a 40% polyacrylamide gel, and the phosphopeptide spots were quantified using a Cyclone phosphorimaging device and the OptiQuant software (Packard). Immunoblots—The protein concentration in the cell lysates was determined using a BCA kit (Pierce). Twenty micrograms of protein per lane were analyzed by Western blotting. Detection of PKB, (phosphoserine 473 PKB) was performed with specific antibodies (Cell Signaling). Nitrocellulose membranes were controlled for equal loading and transfer by staining with Ponceau S. After incubation with the appropriate first antibody and peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody, the signal was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. For immunoblotting of myr-PKB and myr-PKB-K179M (Fig. 3C), expression vectors encoding the hemagglutinin-tagged proteins were transfected into InR1-G9 cells (3 μg), and the blots were probed with an antibody directed against the influenza hemagglutinin protein (sc-805, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, California).

To investigate the signaling mechanisms involved in the regulation of the glucagon promoter by insulin, a reporter gene construct containing 350 base pairs of the 5′-flanking region of the rat glucagon gene (construct -350GluLuc) was transiently transfected into InR1-G9 cells. Treatment of InR1-G9 cells with 10 nm insulin led to an inhibition of the glucagon gene promoter activity by 45% (Fig. 1). A comparable inhibition of the glucagon gene promoter activity by insulin was observed in the presence of 1 μm Ro-31-8220, an inhibitor of conventional PKC activity (Fig. 1). Furthermore, inhibitors of MEK (100 μm PD 98059), and p70 S6 kinase (1 μm rapamycin) did not alter the effect of insulin on the glucagon reporter gene. Ro-31-8220 (1 μm) and PD 98059 (100 μm) prevented the activation of glucagon gene transcription by a PKC-activating phorbol ester (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) and Raf kinase, respectively (data not shown), suggesting that these compounds effectively blocked the targeted signaling pathways. However, when inhibitors of tyrosine kinases (100 μm genistein) or PI 3-kinase (100 μm Ly 294002) were added, the inhibition of glucagon gene transcription by insulin was abolished (Fig. 1). The effect of Ly 294002 was specific, because Ly 294002 had no effect on glucagon gene transcription under basal conditions or after stimulation with a PKC-activating phorbol ester (data not shown). These results confirm that the transcription of the glucagon gene is inhibited by insulin. Furthermore, these data suggest that both tyrosine kinase and PI 3-kinase activity, but not PKC, MEK, or p70 S6 kinase activity, are required to mediate this effect. Class 1a PI 3-kinase consists of a p110 catalytic subunit and a p85 or p55 regulatory subunit that possess two SH2 domains that interact with tyrosine-phosphorylated Tyr(P)-Met-Xaa-Met and Tyr(P)-Xaa-Xaa-Met motifs in insulin receptor substrate proteins (40Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar, 41Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3973) Google Scholar). Therefore, our data suggest that the proximal insulin-signaling pathway to the glucagon gene may involve the recruitment and activation of PI 3-kinase. Insulin Leads to a PI 3-Kinase-dependent Phosphorylation and Activation of PKB in InR1-G9 Cells—PI 3-kinase may transmit multiple signals, including the activation of PKB (41Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3973) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphoinositides on the 3 position to produce phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphates. The formation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate is thought to recruit PKB through its pleckstrin homology domain to the plasma membrane, thereby inducing a conformational change in PKB that allows its activation by phosphorylation at two residues (Thr-308 and Ser-473) (41Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3973) Google Scholar, 42Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 43Cross D.A. Watt P.W. Shaw M. van der Kaay J. Downes C.P. Holder J.C. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Because the above results suggest that the inhibition of glucagon gene transcription by insulin is mediated by PI 3-kinase (Fig. 1) and because PKB is a known downstream target of PI 3-kinase signaling, we next tested the potential involvement of PKB. To study a potential role of PKB in the regulation of glucagon gene transcription, we first studied the effect of insulin on PKB activity in glucagon-producing pancreatic islet cells (Fig. 2). As demonstrated by phosphoserine-specific immunoblot, insulin induced the phosphorylation of PKB on Ser-473 in glucagon-producing pancreatic islet cells (Fig. 2A, top). This phosphorylation is required for the activation of PKB (42Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). To test whether insulin increases PKB activity in InR1-G9 cells, PKB was precipitated with specific antibodies, and the amount of enzymatic activity in the precipitates was then determined via the use of a synthetic peptide based on the sequence of the PKB phosphorylation site in glycogen synthase kinase-3. As shown in Fig. 2A (bottom), insulin markedly stimulated PKB activity in glucagon-producing islet cells. Stimulation of PKB activity by insulin was dose- and time-dependent (Fig. 2, A and C). Maximum stimulation of PKB activity was at ∼10–100 nm insulin, resulting in a 13-fold increase of PKB activity over basal activity (Fig. 2A). The EC50 value of insulin for the stimulation of PKB activity was at ∼1 nm (Fig. 2A), corresponding to the reported IC50 value of insulin for inhibition of glucagon gene transcription (0.5 nm) (5Grzeskowiak R. Amin J. Oetjen E. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30037-30045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, these data relate well to the intra-islet situation in vivo, where α-cells are exposed to insulin concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 nm (4Philippe J. J. Clin. Investig. 1989; 84: 672-677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When a PI 3-kinase inhibitor (100 μm Ly 294002) was added, the activation of PKB by insulin was completely abolished (Fig. 2B). Time course studies demonstrated an activation of PKB by insulin within minutes (Fig. 2C) with a sustained response over >24 h (∼30% of maximum activity; data not shown), thereby providing further support for the idea that activation of PKB is involved in the insulin-dependent regulation of glucagon gene transcription in InR1-G9 cells. These results demonstrate that treatment with insulin results in a PI 3-kinase-dependent activation of PKB in the InR1-G9 cell line. PKB Mimics the Effect of Insulin on the Glucagon Gene Promoter—Because the results obtained to date suggest that insulin both inhibits glucagon gene transcription and activates PKB activity via PI 3-kinase in pancreatic islet cells, we investigated whether activated PKB is sufficient to mimic the effect of insulin on the glucagon gene promoter. Co-expression of a constitutively active version of PKB (construct myr-PKB) (44Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar) in InR1-G9 cells was found to inhibit the transcriptional activity of the glucagon reporter gene (Fig. 3A). The extent of the inhibition of glucagon gene transcription by myr-PKB (by 45%) was similar to the inhibition by insulin (Fig. 3A). In contrast, a catalytically inactive PKB mutant bearing a point mutation in position 179 of the kinase domain (construct PKB-K179M) (29Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar) did not inhibit glucagon gene transcription (Fig. 3A). Also, a second kinase-dead form of PKB (myr-PKB-K179M), which is identical to the constitutively active myr-PKB apart from the single amino acid change in the kinase-dead form myr-PKB-K179M, did not inhibit glucagon gene transcription (Fig. 3B). The lack of effect of myr-PKB-K179M was not due to the decreased protein expression of the catalytically inactive mutant PKB protein (Fig. 3C), indicating that the effect of PKB on the glucagon promoter is specific and due to its kinase activity. These results show that PKB activity is sufficient to inhibit glucagon promoter activity. Because insulin stimulates PKB activity, these data also suggest that insulin may inhibit glucagon gene transcription by signaling through the PI 3-kinase-PKB pathway. PKB, like Insulin, Targets Several Control Elements within the Glucagon Gene Promoter—The rat glucagon gene promoter contains the enhancer-like elements G2 and G3 as well as a CRE (45Knepel W. Hussain M.A. Habener J.F. Molecular Basis of Endocrine Pancreas Development and Function. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA2001: 67-89Google Scholar). The truncated glucagon gene promoter (136 base pairs) containing the proximal promoter elements G1 and G4 exhibits low transcriptional activity but is essential for proper enhancer function (45Knepel W. Hussain M.A. Habener J.F. Molecular Basis of Endocrine Pancreas Development and Function. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA2001: 67-89Google Scholar). A previous study has shown that insulin does not inhibit glucagon gene transcription through a single IRE (5Grzeskowiak R. Amin J. Oetjen E. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30037-30045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); insulin responsiveness of the glucagon gene is rather conferred by interactions between a proximal promoter and more distal enhancer-like elements involving the paired domain transcription factor Pax6 (5Grzeskowiak"

Several different, and in some cases contradictory, views exist on the role individual modules play in carrier transport across the mitochondrial membranes and how they promote protein insertion into the inner membrane. Thus, by use of specific translocation intermediates, we performed a detailed analysis of carrier biogenesis and assessed the physical association of carrier modules with the inner membrane translocation machinery. Here we have reported that each module of the dicarboxylate carrier contains sufficient targeting information for its transport across the outer mitochondrial membrane. The carboxyl-terminal module possesses major targeting information to facilitate the direct binding of the carrier protein to the inner membrane twin-pore translocase and subsequent insertion into the inner membrane in a membrane potential-dependent manner.

A major representative of precursor proteins with internal targeting signals is the metabolite carrier protein family of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Carrier proteins fulfill vital functions for eukaryotic cells, as they are critical for metabolite exchange between mitochondria and the cytosol by forming a transport route across the tightly sealed inner mitochondrial membrane. Members of the carrier protein superfamily share common structural features; they are ∼300 amino acids long and divided into three tandem repeats (modules) of similar length (18Walker J.E. Runswick M.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 19Palmieri F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The structure of the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier (AAC) solved recently by x-ray crystallography revealed six transmembrane α-helices that form a barrel in the membrane (20Pebay-Peyroula E. Dahout-Gonzalez C. Kahn R. Tre ́ze ́guet V. Lauquin G.J. Brandolin G. Nature. 2003; 426: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). The structural fold of each repeat is similar and joined by two short loops exposed to the intermembrane space. The question as to how the carriers themselves are transported to mitochondria and inserted into the inner membrane has drawn much attention. In vitro, the import of carrier proteins can be trapped at various stages along the way and has permitted a substantial dissection of the pathway (21Pfanner N. Neupert W. J. Biol.

The carrier protein then transfers to a major import receptor, Tom70, on the surface of mitochondria to which it remains bound in the absence of ATP (Stage II) (23Ryan M.T. Mu ̈ller H. Pfanner N. J.

If the membrane potential (ΔΨ) across the inner membrane is fully dissipated but ATP is supplied, the carrier protein moves further along the import pathway crossing the outer membrane through the TOM complex and associates with the Tim9–10 complex of the intermembrane space (Stage III) (11Koehler C.M.

An association of the carrier protein with components of the inner membrane TIM22 complex is also detected under these conditions (8Rehling P. Model K. Brandner K. Kovermann P. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E.

If the ΔΨ is, however, only partially dissipated, the carrier precursor accumulates at the stage of inner membrane insertion associating with the TIM22 complex (Stage IV) (8Rehling P. Model K.

A full ΔΨ provides sufficient energy for the carrier precursor to insert into the inner membrane where subsequent assembly into a dimeric form occurs (Stage V) (23Ryan M.T. Mu ̈ller H. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20619-20627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 30Zara V. Palmisano I. Rassow J. Palmieri F. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Beyond this analysis, several studies, using different carrier proteins, fusions, and truncated constructs, have addressed the question of where the targeting information for the different transport steps resides within the precursor. It appears that the targeting determinants, which drive outer membrane receptor binding, translocation through the general import pore, and even association with members of the small Tim family, are contained within each structural repeat (29Endres M. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3214-3221Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 31Wiedemann N. Pfanner N. Ryan M.T.

J. 2005; 385: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). At least for receptor recruitment and outer membrane translocation, there is cooperation between each of these domains (31Wiedemann N. Pfanner N. Ryan M.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Peptide binding scans of carriers revealed Tom70 and Tim9–10 binding sites within all three repeats (33Brix J. Ru ̈diger S.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 942-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). There is, however, controversy regarding the nature of carrier targeting signals that direct the later stages of carrier translocation from the intermembrane space to insertion into the inner membrane. Using the uncoupling protein 1, it was initially described that the first repeat alone can facilitate targeting and membrane insertion of a chimeric protein (36Liu X. Bell A.W. Freeman K.B. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), whereas an independent study (37Schleiff E. McBride H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2267-2272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the same carrier reports that the middle repeat contains the complete targeting signal to direct association with the inner membrane translocation machinery and, hence, membrane insertion. Although the carboxyl-terminal two-thirds of AAC has been implicated in facilitating the later stages of import into mitochondria (38Pfanner N. Hoeben P. Tropschug M. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14851-14854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Smagula C. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6783-6790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a more detailed study reports that the import signals that promote inner membrane insertion were specifically contained within the third module (29Endres M. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3214-3221Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In contrast to these data, a recent report suggests that the third module alone is insufficient to promote membrane insertion but rather that all three modules of the carrier precursor are required to allow membrane insertion via the TIM22 complex (32Vergnolle M.A. Sawney H. Junne T. Dolfini L. Tokatlidis K. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, truncated forms of AAC fused to mouse dihydrofolate reductase were unable to follow the carrier transport pathway via the Tim9–10 and TIM22 complexes but were instead mistargeted to the presequence translocase (TIM23 complex), which directs them into the matrix (32Vergnolle M.A. Sawney H. Junne T. Dolfini L. Tokatlidis K. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, the major drawback of these studies, collectively, has been the lack of an experimentally accessible translocation intermediate during insertion into the inner membrane, i.e. a transport intermediate accumulated at the TIM22 complex. Thus, despite all efforts the role of the different segments of the carrier in protein insertion into the inner membrane has remained enigmatic. Recently, by manipulation of the ΔΨ across the inner membrane, the precursor of the dicarboxylate carrier 1 (DIC) could be accumulated at the inner membrane TIM22 translocase (Stage IV) (8Rehling P. Model K. Brandner K. Kovermann P. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Ku ̈hlbrandt W. Wagner R. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Science. 2003; 299: 1747-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This observation provided, for the first time, the possibility of directly analyzing the molecular determinants responsible for the late stages of carrier import leading to membrane insertion. We generated DIC constructs containing each module either singularly or in pairs. We showed that the third module of DIC contains the dominant targeting signals that allow binding to the twin-pore translocase and promotion of import from Stage III to V. Yeast Strains and Media—Previously described yeast strains YPH499 (WT) (Mata ade2–101 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 ura3–52 trp1-Δ63 lys2–801) (40Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and PRY19 (Tim18ProtA) (Mata ade2–101 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 ura3–52 trp1-Δ63 lys2–801 tim18::TIM18-TEV-ProtA) (8Rehling P. Model K. Brandner K.

Science. 2003; 299: 1747-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) were grown on YPG medium (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) bactopeptone, 3% (v/v) glycerol) at 30 °C. Construction and in Vitro Synthesis of DIC-derived Precursors— DICFL (1–298) representing full-length Saccharomyces cerevisiae dicarboxylate carrier 1 and mutant constructs DICI (1–94), DICII (95–197), DICIII (198–298), DICI,II (1–197), and DICII,III (95–298) were amplified by PCR using Vent polymerase (New England BioLabs Inc.) and yeast genomic DNA as the template. For DIC constructs with amino-terminal deletions (DICII, DICIII, DICII,III), oligonucleotide primers containing the SP6 RNA polymerase binding sequence directly followed by the start codon ATG and the nucleotide sequence encoding the first few amino acids of the desired DIC construct were used. Carboxyl-terminal deletion constructs (DICI, DICII, DICI,II) were amplified using primers complementary to the desired region with the addition of an engineered in-frame stop codon. For the non-truncated ends of DIC constructs, oligonucleotide primers complementary to the 5′- or 3′-untranslated regions of the DIC1 gene were used as appropriate. To generate DICI,III (1–94 and 198–298), the single modules DICI and DICIII were first amplified by PCR from genomic DNA with flanking engineered endonuclease restriction sites EcoRI and BamHI and BamHI and XbaI, respectively. Following restriction digestion of DICI, DICIII, and pGEM4Z, a three-way ligation was used to generate pGEM-DICI,III. A short linker of G and S separates DICI from DICIII in this construct. Radioactive precursors were synthesized by in vitro transcription using SP6 RNA polymerase (Stratagene) and PCR-generated DNA templates amplified from genomic DNA or pGEM-DICI,III, followed by in vitro translation in the presence of [35S]methionine/cysteine using rabbit reticulocyte lysate. In Vitro Import into Isolated Mitochondria—Mitochondria were isolated as described previously (41Meisinger C. Sommer T. Pfanner N. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) from PRY19 and the corresponding wild-type cell, YPH499. Standard import of radiolabeled carrier precursor into isolated yeast mitochondria was performed as described previously (42Ryan M.T. Voos W. Pfanner N. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 189-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For non-standard import reactions (ΔΨ-modified), mitochondria (50 μg of protein) were diluted to a final concentration of 0.5 μg/μl in import buffer (1% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 250 mm sucrose, 80 mm KCl, 20 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm methionine, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2). Prior to import, samples were incubated for 5 min at 25 °C and supplemented with 2 mm ATP, 2 mm NADH, 5 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.1 mg/ml creatine kinase. For partial uncoupling of mitochondria, 20 μm oligomycin was added to the import buffer to prevent the reverse action of FoF1-ATPase and either 10 or 30 μm carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). Import (25 °C) was initiated by addition of rabbit reticulocyte lysate containing radiolabeled precursor protein. Reactions were terminated after 15 min by addition of 1 μm valinomycin. Samples were treated with 50 μg/ml proteinase K for 15 min on ice, and then the protease was inactivated with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Mitochondria were reisolated and either subjected to analysis by SDS-PAGE or solubilized in ice-cold 1% digitonin buffer (1% (w/v) digitonin, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and subjected to blue native-PAGE (BN-PAGE). For control imports, radiolabeled precursors were imported into either fully energized or ΔΨ-depleted mitochondria, solubilized in 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, and treated with proteinase K as above. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and mitochondrial proteins were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE and digital autoradiography. Isolation of Stage IV DIC Precursor-TIM22 Complexes from Mitochondria—35S-labeled full-length or mutant DIC precursors were imported into isolated mitochondria (300 μg of protein) and then solubilized in ice-cold 1% digitonin buffer. Following a clarification centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min, solubilized mitochondrial proteins were applied to human IgG-Sepharose (150-μl settled volume) at 4 °C and then washed with 15 column volumes of wash buffer (0.3% (w/v) digitonin, 50 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Bound proteins were eluted by cleavage with 500 units/ml tobacco etch virus protease (Invitrogen) for 2 h at 16 °C in wash buffer. Either 10× BN-PAGE sample buffer (5% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, 500 mm ϵ-amino n-caproic acid, 100 mm BisTris, pH 7.0) or 4× Laemmli buffer was added to the eluate. Samples were then subjected to either BN-PAGE (8–20%) or SDS-PAGE. Localization of Imported DIC Precursors—Following import of 35S-labeled full-length or mutant DIC precursors, mitochondria were reisolated and resuspended in 200 μl of SEM (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2) and then divided in half. To induce swelling and hence rupture of the outer membranes, one sample of mitochondrial suspension was diluted with four volumes of 10 mm MOPS-KOH buffer, pH 7.2. As a control, the other half of the mitochondrial suspension was diluted with 4 volumes of SEM buffer. After incubation on ice for 30 min, mitochondria (mitoplasts and control) were reisolated by centrifugation, resuspended in 100 μl of SEM buffer, and proteinase K-treated as described above. Mitochondrial proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently subjected to digital autoradiography or immunodecoration following Western blotting. Miscellaneous—Standard protocols were used for BN-PAGE, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting. Immune complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Digital autoradiography using PhosphorImager technology (Amersham Biosciences) was used to analyze radiolabeled proteins. Non-relevant gel lanes were removed digitally. All Modules of DIC Translocate across the Mitochondrial Outer Membrane—To investigate the location of targeting signals in carrier proteins that direct their translocation into the mitochondrial inner membrane, we made mutants of DIC containing one or two structural repeats, referred to as modules (Fig. 1A). Resistance to proteinase K added to the outside of mitochondria following import was used as a measure of precursor translocation across the outer membrane. Full-length and DIC mutants were efficiently synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Next, lysates were mixed with wild-type yeast mitochondria in the presence or absence of a ΔΨ across the inner membrane. After incubation at 25 °C, mitochondria were left untreated or treated with proteinase K, reisolated, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Radioactive full-length and mutant DIC were found associated with mitochondria in the presence and absence of a ΔΨ (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3). Moreover, for both full-length and mutant DIC significant amounts were also recovered with protease-treated mitochondria both in the presence or absence of a ΔΨ (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 5), suggesting that they were efficiently imported across the outer mitochondrial membrane. To ensure that reisolated radioactive signals represented translocated precursor and not just an intrinsic resistance of each mutant to proteinase K, control imports were performed. Following import of each DIC construct independently, mitochondria were solubilized with Triton X-100 and proteinase K-treated. Proteinase K-resistant precursor was recovered for constructs DICI, DICII, and DICIII (Fig. 1B, lanes 8 and 9), but not to the same level as obtained in intact mitochondria. Thus, all DIC constructs were able to translocate across the mitochondrial outer membrane both in the presence and absence of a ΔΨ. Depletion of the ΔΨ, by addition of the potassium ionophore valinomycin, abolishes translocation of the precursor into the inner membrane. The precursor is arrested in transport at Stage III. Under these conditions the amount of precursor that is protected against proteinase K reflects the portion that has passed the outer membrane but is not yet inserted into the inner membrane. When a ΔΨ is present, the precursor is also transported across the outer membrane to a protease-protected environment but is additionally able to insert into the inner membrane. To determine the efficiency of translocation across the outer membrane under both ΔΨ conditions, a quantitation was performed. Surprisingly, all DIC mutants were transported across the outer membrane more efficiently than full-length DIC, particularly under conditions of a full ΔΨ (Fig. 1C, compare lane 1 with lanes 2–7). In agreement with published data (30Zara V. Palmisano I. Rassow J. Palmieri F. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the import of full-length DIC into mitochondria in the absence of a ΔΨ was only marginally reduced compared with fully energized mitochondria (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 1 and 8). However, the ΔΨ-dependent import of the DIC mutants was variable, with the most prominent effect observed for module III in which there was a reduction of ∼50% when the ΔΨ was fully dissipated as compared with full ΔΨ (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 4 and 11). We concluded that all modules of DIC contain sufficient targeting information for import across the outer membrane into the intermembrane space in both fully energized or ΔΨ-dissipated mitochondria. Whereas translocation across the outer membrane was only partially ΔΨ-dependent, module III contains a strong ΔΨ-responsive element. The ability of each individual DIC module or module combination to direct insertion of carrier proteins into the inner membrane via the TIM22 complex under conditions of variable ΔΨ could thus be examined in intact mitochondria. DIC Modules Form Stage IV Intermediates—Recent work has raised doubt whether individual carrier modules follow the carrier pathway by engaging with the TIM22 translocase once they have passed through the outer membrane (32Vergnolle M.A. Sawney H. Junne T. Dolfini L. Tokatlidis K. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To determine whether any single or combined modules of DIC contain sufficient targeting information to drive the late stages of carrier import (from III to V), their ability to form a Stage IV intermediate was investigated. We recently showed that during import full-length DIC binds to the TIM22 translocation machinery, forming a high molecular mass complex that is discernable on BN-PAGE. This Stage IV complex (Fig. 2A) represents a productive translocation intermediate and accumulates with greatest efficiency under conditions of low ΔΨ that can be generated in organello by the addition of the protonophore CCCP (8Rehling P. Model K. Brandner K. Kovermann P. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Ku ̈hlbrandt W. Wagner R. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Science. 2003; 299: 1747-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). We predicted that because all DIC constructs cross the outer membrane (Fig. 1, B and C) and are thus accessible for binding to the TIM22 complex the DIC module or modules containing the TIM22 complex binding elements should be readily identified. The six DIC constructs plus full-length DIC (control) were imported into wild-type mitochondria in the presence of 30 μm CCCP. Mitochondria were proteinase K-treated to remove unimported surface-exposed precursors, reisolated, solubilized in digitonin, and then analyzed by BN-PAGE (Fig. 2B). As expected, full-length DIC formed the high molecular mass Stage IV intermediate, as well as the characteristic low molecular mass Stage III intermediate (which dissociates from the TOM complex during the BN-PAGE run) (43Rehling P.

We have demonstrated previously that the surface localization of the transporter in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells depends on its association with the LIN7 PDZ protein through a PDZ target sequence in the last 5 residues of the transporter (-KETHL). Here we describe a protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated mechanism regulating the association between BGT1 and LIN7. Reduced transport activity paralleled by the intracellular relocalization of the transporter was observed in response to the PKC activation induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) treatment. This activation caused clathrin-dependent internalization of the transporter and its targeting to a recycling compartment that contains the truncated transporter lacking the LIN7 binding motif (BGTΔ5) but not the LIN7 partner of BGT1. The decreased association between BGT1 and LIN7 was demonstrated further by coimmunoprecipitation studies and in vitro binding to recombinant LIN7 fusion protein. The TPA treatment induced phosphorylation of surface BGT1 on serine and threonine residues. However, a greater increase in phosphothreonines than phosphoserines was measured in the wild type transporter, whereas the opposite was true in the BGTSer mutant in which a serine replaced the threonine 612 in the LIN7 association motif (-KESHL). No similar increase in relative phosphoserines or phosphothreonines was found in the BGTΔ5 transporter. Moreover, phosphorylation of threonine 612 in a BGT COOH-terminal peptide impaired its association with recombinant LIN7. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the post-translational regulation of BGT1 surface density is a result of transporter phosphorylation and that threonine 612 is an essential residue in this PKC-mediated regulation.

However, it has been suggested that the post-transcriptional regulation of BGT1 protein also plays a role in cell adaptation to hypertonic stress (3Kempson S.A. Parikh V. Xi L. Chu S. Montrose M.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C1091-C1100Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The predicted structure of BGT1 contains 12 putative hydrophobic transmembrane α-helices, whose amino and carboxyl termini face the cytoplasm. The cytosolic COOH terminus contains a basolateral sorting signal (4Perego C. Bulbarelli A. Longhi R. Caimi M. Villa A. Caplan M.J. Pietrini G. J. Biol.

LIN7 forms a tripartite complex with LIN2 (CASK) and LIN10 (Mint, X11), and, through their PDZ domains, the mammalian homologs are involved in the assembly of junctional components in epithelia, neurons and glial cells (5Perego C.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3331-3340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The single PDZ domain of LIN7 is a type I PDZ domain that selectively binds ligands such as the BGT1 COOH terminus (-ETHL). The association of BGT1 and LIN7 is not required for targeting BGT1 to the basolateral surface of MDCK cells but, it is necessary to prevent its internalization, thus mediating transporter accumulation on the lateral junctional surface (5Perego C. Vanoni C. Villa A. Longhi R. Kaech S.M. Frohli E. Hajnal A. Kim S.K. Pietrini G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2384-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This need for the association with LIN7 to prevent internalization may provide the basis for a regulatory mechanism involving the rapid modulation of surface BGT1 expression. Transporter phosphorylation has been linked to regulatory protein trafficking, and it has been shown that various members of the sodium-dependent neurotransmitter transporter family (including GABA transporters) are acutely regulated in response to the activation of serine and threonine kinases (13Corey J.L. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Brecha N. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14759-14767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Preston A.S. Yamauchy A. Kwon H.M. Handler J.S. J. Am. Soc.

A number of consensus sites for these are located in the intracellular domains of BGT1, but no data are available concerning their phosphorylation. However, it has been shown that the phosphorylation of residues in the COOH-terminal sequences binding PDZ domains (17Chung H.J. Xia J. Scannevin R.H. Zhang X. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7258-7267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Parker L.L. Backstrom J.R. Sanders-Bush E. Shieh B.H. J. Biol.

Neuron. 1996; 17: 759-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and the phosphorylation of a serine residue in a PDZ domain (20Raghuram V. Hormuth H. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9620-9625Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) abolish the association of target proteins with their PDZ partners. The phosphorylation-mediated regulation of these interactions controls the surface distribution of AMPA and β-adrenergic receptors (17Chung H.J. Xia J. Scannevin R.H. Zhang X. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7258-7267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Because the interaction of BGT1 with the PDZ domain of LIN7 is a key factor determining its surface density, we investigated whether BGT1 phosphorylation events dynamically regulate BGT1-LIN7 interactions, thus affecting transporter activity and distribution. Analysis of the effects of activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) on BGT1 showed that PKC (but not PKA) phosphorylates BGT1 and disrupts its interaction with LIN7, thus causing a clathrinmediated relocalization of the transporter to an intracellular recycling compartment and a parallel decrease in its activity. Our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism for the regulation of transporter activity based on the PKC-mediated modulation of PDZ protein interactions with target sequences. The cDNAs of canine BGT1 carrying a single base mutation that produces a protein with serine instead of threonine in position 612 (BGTSer) were obtained by QuikChange site mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using pCB6-mycBGT as template (4Perego C.

The fragment corresponding to nucleotides 1886–1947 of the BGT cDNA was digested with KpnI-ClaI and subcloned to similarly digested pCB6-mycBGT. The sequence of the resulting clones was confirmed by DNA sequencing (PRIMM). MDCK-BGTSer cell lines were obtained by calcium phosphate transfection and G418 selection (4Perego C. Bulbarelli A.

They were plated at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/cm2 on glass coverslips for immunocytochemistry, Transwell filter inserts (0.4-μm pores; Costar) for GABA uptake experiments, or tissue culture dishes (Falcon) for biochemistry, and cultured for 60 h to reach confluence before treatment. In the case of transient transfections, the MDCK cells were cotransfected by the calcium phosphate-mediated method 24 h after plating using cDNA coding for untagged BGT1 and myc-tagged BGTΔ5; the MDCK-BGT1 cell lines were transfected 48 h after plating with cDNA coding for wild type HA-tagged dynamin1 or K44A (a gift from Dr. Schmid) (22Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 25 mm HEPES, the cells were treated in the same medium with 1 μm TPA (tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) (Sigma) for 30 min to stimulate PKC, or 10 μm forskolin (FSK) (Calbiochem) to activate PKA, or 2 μm GF109203X (Tocris) for 20 min before TPA treatment as a means of specifically preventing PKC activation. To inhibit clathrin-mediated internalization, the cells were pretreated for 30 min in hypertonic medium consisting of DMEM/HEPES supplemented with 0.45 m sucrose. Clathrin-independent endocytosis was blocked by maintaining the cells for2hat 37 °C in DMEM supplemented with 200 μm genistein. After treatment, the cells were processed for immunofluorescence or biochemical studies as indicated. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against a synthetic peptide consisting of amino acids 598–614 of dog BGT1; coupling and immunization were performed as described previously (23Pietrini G. Suh Y.J. Edelmann L. Rudnick G. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4668-4674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain the BGT17 and KETHL antibodies, the serum was affinity purified on columns of synthetic peptides consisting, respectively, of the last COOH-terminal 17 and 5 amino acids of BGT1 immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (24Meldolesi J. Corte G. Pietrini G. Borgese N. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 516-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To optimize the yield in the immunoprecipitation experiments, the BGT17 antibody was used to recognize the wild type transporter, whereas the BGT-KLH polyclonal antibody raised against an internal peptide (5Perego C. Vanoni C. Villa A. Longhi R. Kaech S.M. Frohli E. Hajnal A. Kim S.K. Pietrini G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2384-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) was used to immunoprecipitate mutant transporters. Qualitatively similar results were obtained when wild type and mutant transporters were immunoprecipitated with the 9E10 monoclonal antibody directed against the c-myc epitope (MBL, Santa Cruz), but the low efficiency prevented its use in these experiments. In the immunofluorescence experiments the wild type transporter was revealed by BGT17 or anti-myc antibodies, and the mutant transporters were localized using BGT-KLH or anti-myc antibodies. In the coexpression experiments, the purified rabbit polyclonal KETHL and the anti-myc antibodies were used, respectively, to distinguish BGT1 and the myc-epitope tagged BGTΔ5. LIN7 PDZ protein was immunorevealed by a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against amino acids 44–207 of mouse LIN7 fused to a sequence of 6 histidines (histidine-LIN7 fusion protein) (12Perego C. Vanoni C. Massari S. Raimondi A. Pola S. Cattaneo M.G. Francolini M. Vicentini L.M. Pietrini G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3331-3340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following antibodies were also used: monoclonal anti-β-catenin (Transduction Laboratories), anti-GST (Santa Cruz), and anti-HA epitope (Roche Applied Science), polyclonal antibodies against the bovine mannose 6-phosphate receptor as a late endosomal marker (a gift from Dr. Hoflack) (25Griffiths G. Matteoni R. Back R. Hoflack B. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 441-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and human catepsin D as a lysosomal marker (a gift from Dr. Isidoro) (26Isidoro C. De Stefanis D. Demoz M. Ogier-Denis E. Codogno P. Baccino F.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1029-1037PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde or ice-cold methanol and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. Immunostaining with primary antibodies was followed by incubation with rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch). For wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) labeling, the MDCK-mycBGT1 clones were incubated on ice for 1 h with FITC-WGA (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline + 0.1 mm Ca2+ + 1 mm Mg2+ + 1% bovine serum albumin 60 h after plating. The cells were washed to remove any unbound labeling lectin and then cultured for 30 min in DMEM/HEPES supplemented with 1 μm TPA before fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde and staining for BGT1. The confocal images were obtained using a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal microscope. The MDCK cell lines were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a mixture of protease inhibitors with or without a mixture of phosphatase inhibitors). After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min, the lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies preincubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose. The immunocomplexes bound to the beads were recovered by centrifugation, washed three times with lysis buffer, and loaded onto an 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane at 120 mA overnight, and the blots were probed for BGT1 and LIN7 using the primary antibodies described above, with protein A conjugated to peroxidase as the secondary reagent, and visualized by means of ECL (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Binding of Recombinant GST-LIN7 to Immobilized Peptides—The expression of mLIN7 fused to GST and inserted into pGEX-1 vector (5Perego C. Vanoni C. Villa A. Longhi R. Kaech S.M. Frohli E. Hajnal A. Kim S.K. Pietrini G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2384-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) was induced in Escherichia coli DH5α. Bacterial lysates containing ∼2 μg of GST-LIN7 were incubated with ∼20 μg of peptides immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). In competition experiments, 60 μg of free peptides was preincubated with the bacterial lysate for2hat room temperature before overnight incubation with the Sepharose-bound peptides, and the mixture was washed four times at 4 °C using 1.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100 (50% of the detergent concentration in the bacterial lysate). The proteins bound to the Sepharose beads were solubilized, loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and immunoblotted. Binding of MDCK Cell Line Lysates to Immobilized GST-LIN7 Fusion Protein—The expression of mLIN7 fused to GST was induced in E. coli DH5α. MDCK-mycBGT1 cell lines treated or not with TPA were solubilized in lysis buffer supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors and incubated overnight with ∼4 μg of the GST-LIN7 fusion protein previously immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). The bound transporter was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunostained using the polyclonal BGT17. Metabolic Labeling—Metabolic labeling with 32Pi was carried out by preincubating cells in phosphate-free medium for 3 h (27Rosa P. Mantovani S. Rosboch R. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12227-12232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then incubating them for 30 min at 37 °C with phosphate-free medium containing 32Pi (final specific activity 0.15–0.25 mCi/ml). The labeled cells were treated as described above, washed in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors, and lysed as described above. The transporters were immunoprecipitated, and the immunocomplexes were loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and autoradiographed. The signal intensity was quantified densitometrically using NIH Image 1.59 software, and statistical significance was determined by means of Student's t test. Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—Immunoprecipitated phosphorylated transporters were electrophoresed on 10% gels at 50 mV overnight, and after drying and autoradiography, the region of the gel containing the transporter was excised, and the protein was eluted overnight at 37 °C in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8, with 50 μg of Pronase (Sigma). After being evaporated by a vacuum concentrator (SpeedVac), the samples were hydrolyzed in 0.2 ml of 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 2 h and evaporated again. The hydrolyzed samples were dissolved in a pH 1.9 buffer (7.8% acetic acid, 2.5% formic acid) with a mixture of cold phosphoamino acid standards (phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine, 25 nm each), spotted onto cellulose thin layer plates (Schleicher & Schuell), and separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis: 750 V for 2 h with pH 1.9 buffer in the first dimension, and 500 V for 1.5 h at pH 3.5 (0.5% pyridine and 5% acetic acid) in the second dimension. The standards were visualized with ninhydrin, and the plates were autoradiographed at -70 °C in a cassette fitted with an intensifying screen (Kodak). Analysis and Quantification of Phosphoamino Acid—To visualize the TPA-mediated relative increase in phosphothreonines compared with phosphoserines in the transporters having an identical amount of serines (BGT1 and BGTΔ5) and the relative increase in phosphoserines compared with phosphothreonines in the transporters having identical threonines (BGTΔ5 and BGTSer), autoradiograms with comparable phosphoserines (BGT1 and BGTΔ5) or phosphothreonines (BGTΔ5 and BGTSer) were quantitated using the NIH Image program. The results were expressed as the -fold increase in phosphothreonines or phosphoserines in response to TPA normalized to the corresponding increase in phosphoserines or phosphothreonines (i.e. the -fold increase in phosphothreonines in BGT1 = the TPA-induced increase in phosphothreonines/the TPA-induced increase in phosphoserines). GABA influx was assayed according to Yamauchi et al. (2Yamauchi A. Kwon H.M. Uchida S. Preston A.S. Handler J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F197-F202PubMed Google Scholar), with modifications (23Pietrini G. Suh Y.J. Edelmann L. Rudnick G. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4668-4674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly 10 × 103 cells were plated on 6.5-mm Transwell filters, grown for 60 h, and treated as described above. [3H]GABA (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in incubation buffer was applied to the apical and basolateral sides at a final concentration of 10 μm for 10 min at 37 °C. Uptake was terminated by aspirating the medium, and the cells were washed three times with ice-cold incubation buffer. After removing the filters from the supports, the cells were solubilized in 0.2 ml of 1% SDS, and the samples were counted using a β-counter in 5 ml of scintillation solution (Ultima Gold, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). PKC Activation Decreases BGT1 Activity and Relocalizes the Transporter in Endocytotic Compartments—To verify whether serine/threonine kinase proteins regulate BGT1, we measured its activity in response to the activation of PKC and PKA in a MDCK-mycBGT1 clone by evaluating [3H]GABA uptake, because BGT1 transports GABA with even higher affinity than betaine. An ∼60% reduction in GABA influx was observed after TPA treatment, thus suggesting a PKC-mediated mechanism (Fig. 1A). The dramatic effect of PKC activation on GABA influx was dose-dependent and reached a peak when the cells were treated for 30 min with 1 μm TPA (Fig. 1B). This effect was largely but not completely prevented by the PKC specific inhibitor GF109203X because a reduction of ∼25–30% was still measured in the presence of the inhibitor (Fig. 1A). The reduction in GABA transport activity in response to TPA treatment was accompanied by the intracellular relocalization of BGT1 (Fig. 1C, compare the lateral surface staining in a with the intracellular staining in b), which appeared to be completely prevented by the PKC inhibitor GF109203X (c). A 25–30% reduction in transport activity unrelated to the intracellular relocalization of the transporter was also measured after FSK treatment (Fig. 1, A and C, d), thus suggesting that alternative mechanisms independent of transporter relocalization are responsible for the inhibition of transport activity after FSK and TPA. To establish whether BGT1 is internalized in response to TPA treatment, we first performed an endocytosis morphological assay, in which glycoproteins were labeled with FITCWGA at 0 °C, chased at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of 1 μm TPA, and then fixed and stained for BGT1. As shown in Fig. 2A, many of the intracellular structures containing BGT1 also contained internalized WGA-labeled glycoproteins, thus indicating that BGT1 is in endocytotic compartments. To identify the internalization pathway followed by BGT1, we analyzed the effect of endocytosis inhibition on transporter distribution. It has been reported widely that 0.45 m hypertonic sucrose treatment specifically inhibits endocytosis through clathrin-coated pits (28Heuser J.E. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 29Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), whereas 200 μm genistein inhibits clathrin-independent endocytosis (30Puri V. Watanabe R. Singh R.D. Dominguez M. Brown J.C. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). We found that sucrose prevented the TPA-mediated internalization of wild type BGT1, as revealed by the shift in the distribution of BGT1 from intracellular compartments to the cell surface (Fig. 2B). Genistein treatment did not prevent the TPA-induced relocalization of BGT1, thus indicating a clathrin-dependent mechanism underlying the TPA-mediated regulation of BGT1 distribution. We also used a dominant negative mutant of dynamin1 (K44A) to block clathrin-mediated and dynamin1-dependent internalization (22Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). MDCK-mycBGT1 cell lines were transiently transfected with wild type dynamin1 or the mutant K44A. The latter blocked the TPA-mediated internalization of BGT1, thus indicating that the process requires the functional budding of clathrin-coated endocytotic vesicles, but, when the cells were transfected with wild type dynamin1, TPA still induced the translocation of BGT1 to endosomes (Fig. 2C). A truncated transporter lacking the PDZ association motif (BGTΔ5) constitutively recycles from the intracellular endocytotic compartments to the plasma membrane, but immunofluorescence staining detects the transporters in the intracellular compartment where it accumulates (Fig. 2B) (5Perego C. Vanoni C. Villa A. Longhi R. Kaech S.M. Frohli E. Hajnal A. Kim S.K. Pietrini G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2384-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The truncated transporter staining appeared to be unchanged after TPA stimulation, but the sucrose-induced inhibition of clathrin-dependent endocytosis led to its surface accumulation. Taken together, these data document a clathrin-dependent internalization of wild type and truncated BGT1. TPA Treatment Targets Internalized Transporter to the BGTΔ5-containing Recycling Compartment—We next investigated the identity of the intracellular compartments containing BGT1 by first examining whether endogenous MDCK late endosomal and lysosomal markers colocalized with BGT1. After 30-min incubation with TPA, virtually no BGT1 colocalization with the mannose 6-phosphate receptor late endosomal marker or the cathepsin D lysosomal marker was detected by the specific antibodies (Fig. 3A). To verify whether BGT1 colocalizes with BGTΔ5 in the perinuclear recycling compartment of MDCK cells after TPA treatment, wild type BGT1 was coexpressed with myc-tagged BGTΔ5. A rabbit polyclonal KETHL antibody raised against the last 5 amino acids of BGT1 was used to distinguish the wild type transporter from the truncated form, and the latter was detected using an anti-myc monoclonal antibody. Colocalization of BGT1 and BGTΔ5inthe intracellul"
https://openalex.org/W2072276949,"The CCA-adding enzyme (tRNA nucleotidyltransferase) builds and repairs the 3′ end of tRNA. A single active site adds both CTP and ATP, but the enzyme has no nucleic acid template, and tRNA does not translocate or rotate during C75 and A76 addition. We modeled the structure of the class I archaeal Sulfolobus shibatae CCA-adding enzyme on eukaryotic poly(A) polymerase and mutated residues in the vicinity of the active site. We found mutations that specifically affected C74, C75, or A76 addition, as well as mutations that progressively impaired addition of CCA. Many of these mutations clustered in an evolutionarily versatile β-turn located between strands 3 and 4 of the nucleotidyltransferase domain. Our mutational analysis confirms and extends recent crystallographic studies of the highly homologous Archaeoglobus fulgidus enzyme. We suggest that the unusual phenotypes of the β-turn mutants reflect the consecutive conformations assumed by the β-turn as it presents the discriminator base N73, then C74, and finally C75 to the active site without translocation or rotation of the tRNA acceptor stem. We also suggest that β-turn mutants can affect nucleotide selection because the growing 3′ end of tRNA must be properly positioned to serve as part of the ribonucleoprotein template that selects the incoming nucleotide."
https://openalex.org/W1999842409,"EcoO109I is a type II restriction endonuclease that recognizes the DNA sequence of RGGNCCY. Here we describe the crystal structures of EcoO109I and its complex with DNA. A comparison of the two structures shows that the catalytic domain moves drastically to capture the DNA. One metal ion and two water molecules are observed near the active site of the DNA complex. The metal ion is a Lewis acid that stabilizes the pentavalent phosphorus atom in the transition state. One water molecule, activated by Lys-126, attacks the phosphorus atom in an SN2 mechanism, whereas the other water interacts with the 3′-leaving oxygen to donate a proton to the oxygen. EcoO109I is similar to EcoRI family enzymes in terms of its DNA cleavage pattern and folding topology of the common motif in the catalytic domain, but it differs in the manner of DNA recognition. Our findings propose a novel classification of the type II restriction endonucleases and lead to the suggestion that EcoO109I represents a new subclass of the EcoRI family."
https://openalex.org/W2129616621,"Human thyroperoxidase (hTPO), the key enzyme involved in thyroid hormone synthesis, is synthesized in the form of a 933-amino acid polypeptide that subsequently undergoes posttranslational modifications such as N- and O-glycosylation and heme fixation. In the present study, it was established that the N-terminal part of hTPO is cleaved during the maturation of the enzyme. In the first set of experiments performed in this study, Chines hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with hTPO cDNA generated four different species after deglycosylation, namely a 98-kDa species, which corresponds to the full-length deglycosylated hTPO, and two 94-kDa and one 92-kDa species, which were truncated in the N-terminal parts. The three latter forms were detected only at the cell surface. A proprotein convertase inhibitor prevented these cleavages, and experiments using monensin and brefeldin A showed that they occurred in a post-endoplasmic reticulum compartment. Site-directed mutagenesis studies were performed in which Arg65 was identified as one of the cleavage sites. In the second part of the study, hTPO from human thyroid glands was purified using a monoclonal antibody recognizing the folded form of hTPO. Amino acid determination showed that the N-terminal part of this protein begins at Thr109. This cleavage process differs from that observed in CHO cells. The fact that this hTPO was endoglucosaminidase H-sensitive indicated that the cleavage of the propeptide occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum. To analyze the role of the hTPO prosequence, cDNAs with and without prosequence (Cys15–Lys108) were transfected into CHO cells. hTPO propeptide deletion drastically decreased the proportion of the folded hTPO form, and under these conditions the cell surface activity disappeared completely. These results strongly suggest that the prosequence plays a crucial role as an intramolecular chaperone, facilitating the folding of hTPO.

Human TPO is a type I membrane-bound glycoprotein containing a heme prosthetic group (for a review, see Refs. 4McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocr.

The large extracytoplasmic domain, which is oriented toward the follicular lumen, contains the catalytic site and four potential N-glycosylation sites. Although TPO catalyzes the process of hormonosynthesis at the apical cell surface of the thyrocyte, only a small fraction of this enzyme is to be found at this location, and most of it is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (6Ekholm R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1981; 24: 141-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). After transfecting the full hTPO cDNA into CHO cells, a similar pattern of distribution between ER and the cell surface was obtained (7Fayadat L. Niccoli-Sire P. Lanet J. Franc J.L. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4277-4285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and only 15–20% of the hTPO molecules were able to acquire at least a partially folded form (they were recognized by the monoclonal antibody (mAb) 15), whereas the unfolded molecules were degraded by the proteasome, and only a small proportion of the forms recognized by mAb15 were able to reach the cell surface (7Fayadat L.

In the present study, it was established that hTPO undergoes another posttranslational modification, the cleavage of a propeptide by an endoprotease.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Tissue culture dishes were obtained from BD Biosciences, and Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture was from Invitrogen.

Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 856-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). CHO RPE.40 cells were a gift from J. F. Sucic (University of Michigan, Flint, MI).Cell Culture and Transfection Procedure—CHO cells and stably transfected hTPO-CHO cells were kept in Ham's-F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin in a humidified incubator (5% CO2).Transfection of hTPO cDNA was carried out by using the Lipofectamine reagent protocol (Invitrogen). CHO cells in 35-mm dishes were transfected with 1 μg of pcDNA3-hTPO construct for 3 h in serum-free culture medium. The transfection medium was replaced by complete medium, and cells were grown 48 h before use.Metabolic Labeling and Extraction—For metabolic labeling, confluent cells incubated in culture cell medium supplemented with 10 mm sodium butyrate were incubated 24 h with 100 μCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys. At the end of the labeling process, cells were washed four times with 2 ml of ice-cold PBS and subjected to either protein extraction or the biotinylation technique (see above).For pulse-chase experiments, cells were pre-incubated for 2 h in Met- and Cys-free Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 10 mm sodium butyrate and then labeled for 30 min with 100 μCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys. After the pulse step, cells were washed four times with 1 ml of PBS and chased by adding 1 ml of culture medium supplemented with 5 mm Met/Cys. At the chase times indicated, cells were washed twice with 2 ml of ice-cold PBS.For protein extraction, cells were scraped into 600 μl of TPO extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.3% DOC, protease inhibitor mixture, and 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide) and incubated on ice for 20 min. Samples were then centrifuged for 3 min at 10,000 × g, and the supernatants were kept for later use.Immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE—The immunoprecipitation step was performed using two antibodies directed against TPO, mAb47, and mAb15 (12Ruf J. Toubert M.E. Czarnocka B. Durand-Gorde J.M. Ferrand M. Carayon P. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1211-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), which were previously complexed with protein A-Sepharose by incubating them overnight at 4 °C. As described above, mAb47 immunoprecipitated the unfolded hTPO forms, and mAb15 immunoprecipitated both the partially and completely folded hTPO forms (8Fayadat L. Siffroi-Fernandez S. Lanet J. Franc J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15948-15954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The radiolabeled supernatants obtained after the extraction process were incubated for 3 h with immune complexes. After being briefly centrifuged, the immune complexes were washed four times with TPO extraction buffer and once with PBS. The precipitated TPO was separated from the immune complexes by boiling them for 5 min in 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, containing 2% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, and 10% bromphenol blue. The samples were run on 7.5% acrylamide gels and examined by autoradiography with a phosphorimaging system (Fudjix BAS 1000, Japan).Cell Surface Biotinylation—hTPO-CHO cells metabolically labeled for 24 h with 100 μCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys were incubated twice for 20 min each time at 4 °C in ice-cold PBS containing 0.5 mg/ml ImmunoPure NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce). Biotin reagent was then quenched by incubating the preparation with 50 mm NH4Cl in ice-cold PBS for 10 min. Cells were scraped into the extraction buffer, and hTPO was immunoprecipitated as described above. The hTPO recovered after a 3-min centrifugation at 10,000 × g was diluted in 250 μl of extraction buffer. Cell surface hTPO was separated from the intracellular pool by performing a 2-h incubation with avidin-agarose beads. The supernatant (intracellular hTPO) was stored for further use, and the pellet (cell surface hTPO) was washed four times with the extraction buffer without any N-ethylmaleimide. Cell surface hTPO was then eluted from the avidin-agarose beads by boiling them for 5 min in 5 μl of 2% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol diluted in 100 μl of Laemmli buffer. Supernatants corresponding to the cell surface fraction and the intracellular fraction were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE.Digestion with Endo H and PNGase F—Purified hTPO or immunoprecipitated hTPO were denatured by boiling them for 5 min in 0.1% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% DOC or 1% SDS and 2% β-mercaptoethanol, respectively. Samples were then diluted with glycosidase buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5, and 1% Triton X-100 for Endo H and 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, and 1% Triton X-100 for PNGase F) and incubated for 16 h with 1 unit of PNGase F or 5 milliunits of Endo H at 37 °C. The samples were then prepared for analysis by SDS-PAGE.Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis of potential furin cleavage sites was performed using a QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and a pcDNA3 plasmid containing the full-length human wild type hTPO (hTPO-pcDNA3) as a template. The mutagenic primers used for the point mutations R48A, R65A, and R103A were 5′-CTTGGAGGAAAGCAAGGCCCTGGTGGACACCGCCATG-3′/5′-CATGGCGGTGTCCACCAGGGCCTTGCTTTCCTCCAAG-3′, 5′-CAGAGAAACCTCAAGAAAGCAGGAATCCTTTCTCCAGC-3′/5′-GCTGGAGAAAGGATTCCTGCTTTCTTGAGGTTTCTCTG-3′, and 5′-GGAAACATCAATACAAGCGATGAAAGCAAAAGTCAACCTGAAAACTC-3′/5′-GAGTTTTCAGGTTGACTTTTGCTTTCATCGCTTGTATTGA TGTTTCC-3′, respectively. Mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing (Genome Express SA, France).Construction of the cDNA of hTPO Lacking the Cytoplasmic Tail (WCT-hTPO) and the Prosequence (Δpro-hTPO) and Construction of the cDNA of the Prosequence of hTPO (pro-hTPO)—All of these constructs were prepared using a single PCR procedure (13Makarova O. Kamberov E. Margolis B. BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 970-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 14Wang J. Wilkinson M.F. BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 976-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The PCR mixture contained 160 ng of each primer, 50 ng of the hTPO-pcDNA3, 200 μm dNTPs, 10% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, 2.5 units of PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene), and the corresponding buffer in a total volume of 50 μl. The reaction was performed under the following conditions: denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s followed by 17 denaturation cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and an extension at 68 °C for 17 min. PCR products were incubated with 10 units of DpnI for 2 h, and 5 μl of this solution was then transformed into 50 μl of MAX Efficiency DH5 (Invitrogen). Parts of this transformant were spread onto Luria-Bertani agar plates.The mutagenic primers used for the deletion of the C-terminal part of the hTPO were 5′-GGTGATTTGCAGGTGAACACGCACTGGCACTAAATCCACACTG-3′/5′-GGATTTAGTGCCAGTGCGTGTTCACCTGCAAATCACCGTCGAG-3′. These primers introduced a stop codon (in boldface) just after the hTPO transmembrane domain. The hTPO expressed was then deleted from the Trp873–Leu933 cytoplasmic tail sequence.The mutagenic primers used for prosequence deletion were 5′-TCTGTCACGCTGGTTATGGCC126A409CTCAACAATCACAGCATCCAACG-3′/5′-TCTGTCACGCTGGTTATGGCCACTCAACAATCACAGCATCCAACG-3′. The underlined nucleotides indicate the end of the signal peptide (position 126), and the bold nucleotides represent the hTPO sequence just after the prosequence (position 409).The prosequence of hTPO, extending from nucleotide 127 to nucleotide 408, was amplified from the hTPO-pcDNA3 template by performing PCR with 77 oligonucleotide pairs (5′-GAAAAGAAAAGTCAACCTGAAA408TACCCCTACGACGTGCCCGACTACGCCTAGA409CTCAACAATCACAGCATCCAACGG-3′/5′CCGTTGGATGCTGTGATTGTTGAGTCTAGGCGTAGTCGGGCACGTCGTAGGGGTATTTCAGGTTGACTTTTCTTTTC-3′) inserting the HA epitope sequence YPYDVPDYA (in boldface) just after the propeptide sequence, followed by a stop codon. Underlined sequences correspond to the native hTPO sequence between Lys102–Lys108 and Thr109–Thr116. Mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing (Genome Express SA).Purification and N-terminal Sequencing of Native hTPO—Native hTPO was purified from human thyroid tissue as described previously (15Czarnocka B. Ruf J. Ferrand M. Carayon P. Lissitzky S. FEBS Lett. 1985; 190: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Briefly, microsomes obtained from tissue were incubated overnight in solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 0.1 mm potassium iodide, and 0.3% DOC). After 105,000 × g centrifugation at 4 °C for 1 h, the supernatant was recovered and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, and 0.1 mm potassium iodide. Human TPO was then purified on a mAb15-Sepharose 4B column. After washing with 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 0.1 mm potassium iodide, 0.1% DOC, and 0.5 m KCl, hTPO was eluted with 0.1 mm NH4OH, 0.5% DOC, 1 m KCl, and 0.1 mm potassium iodide. Each fraction was tested for peroxidase activity (by guaiacol assay), and the most active fractions were pooled. This pool was extensively dialyzed against 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 0.05% DOC buffer and stored at –80 °C until use.After deglycosylation with Endo H and reduction, 35 μg of native hTPO was resolved by electrophoresis on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Western blotting was then performed using Problott polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Applied Biosystems) in Tris borate buffer followed by Amido Black staining. Protein bands of interest were then excised and sequenced by the Protein Microsequencing Laboratory at the Pasteur Institute.hTPO Enzymatic Activity—Forty-eight hours before assaying hTPO enzymatic activity, hTPO-CHO cells were incubated with 10 mm sodium butyrate with or without 50 μm CMK. The medium was then removed, and cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS buffer. The incubation mixture contained bovine serum albumin (5 mg/ml in PBS) and Na125I (106 cpm/ml) in the absence or presence of 2 mm mercapto-1-imidazole for the negative control experiments. The reaction was initiated by adding H2O2 to obtain a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Cells were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The medium was then transferred to ice-cold tubes, and the cell surface was washed once with 0.5 ml PBS. Then 1 ml of ice-cold 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, supplemented with 10–4 m potassium iodide, was added to each tube. After 20 min at 4 °C, the suspension was centrifuged (2000 × g for 6 min). The supernatant was discarded, and the acid insoluble iodinated material obtained was washed three times with 2 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid. The radioactivity remaining in the pellet was counted.RESULTSEvidence for Endoproteolytic Cleavage of hTPO—In a previous study using stably hTPO-expressing CHO cells metabolically labeled with [35S]Met/Cys, we reported that the 35S-hTPO gave a single band on SDS-PAGE and, after deglycosylation with PNGase F, yielded three distinct bands (7Fayadat L. Niccoli-Sire P. Lanet J. Franc J.L. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4277-4285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We assumed that this was due to an incomplete action of glycanase. At the beginning of the present study, we reassessed this hypothesis by carrying out the following experiments.After performing metabolic labeling for 24 h with [35S]Met/Cys, hTPO was immunoprecipitated using the pair of mAbs, mAb15 and mAb47. Under these conditions, as described previously (8Fayadat L. Siffroi-Fernandez S. Lanet J. Franc J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15948-15954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), >90% of the hTPO was immunoprecipitated. The samples were then deglycosylated by Endo H or PNGase F (Fig. 1A). As reported previously by our group, 35S-hTPO run on SDS-PAGE gave a specific band of 110 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 1). After Endo H digestion a supplementary 98-kDa band appeared (Fig. 1A, lane 2), and after PNGase F digestion the hTPO showed up on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel as 98-, 94-, and 92-kDa bands (Fig. 1A, lane 3). The 94-kDa band is actually composed of two distinct bands with very similar molecular masses.To induce the expression of completely unglycosylated control hTPO samples, hTPO-CHO cells were treated with tunicamycin, an antibiotic that inhibits the formation of all N-linked oligosaccharides in proteins. Under these culture conditions, the 98-kDa hTPO band obtained (Fig. 1A, lane 4) was resistant to Endo H or PNGase F digestion (Fig. 1A, lanes 5 and 6) and therefore corresponded to the full-length unglycosylated hTPO. In comparison with this unglycosylated hTPO band, the shift from the 110- to 98-kDa hTPO band extracted from untreated control cells after PNGase F deglycosylation can therefore be attributed to the presence of N-linked glycans (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4). By contrast, the migration of the two lower apparent molecular mass bands beyond the unglycosylated hTPO migration band suggests that the 94- and 92-kDa hTPO species cannot have been due to the glycosylation process but rather to the action of protease(s) on the polypeptide structure of the protein.To determine whether these cleavages occur in the N- or the C-terminal part of the protein, a mutant form of hTPO lacking the cytoplasmic tail was used. The nucleotidic sequence encoding 61 amino acids from Trp873 to Leu933 was deleted from the hTPO cDNA. This mutant, WCT-hTPO, was expressed in CHO cells and, after immunoprecipitation, was subjected to a PNGase F deglycosylation step. Along lines similar to what occurs in the case of the electrophoretic migration of the full-length hTPO, after PNGase F digestion WCT-hTPO was found to contain the three different apparent molecular mass species (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 4). This result indicates that the endoproteolytic cleavages of hTPO occurred in the N-terminal part of the protein.Because the hTPO cleaved species were resistant to Endo H and because this enzyme specifically cleaved the high-mannose type glycans, it is suggested that the endoproteolytic processing did not occur in the ER compartment but rather in the Golgi apparatus or at the cell surface. To confirm this assumption, after a metabolic labeling step the intracellular and cell surface 35S-hTPOs were separated using the cell surface biotinylation technique. Both intracellular and cell surface samples were then subjected to deglycosylation with Endo H or PNGase F. Intracellular and cell surface hTPO appeared on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel as a specific 110-kDa band (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 4). After Endo H and PNGase F digestion, the intracellular hTPO showed up on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel as a single 98-kDa band (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 3), whereas the cell surface hTPO yielded 98-, 94-, and 92-kDa bands (Fig. 1C, lane 6). The fact that the hTPO cleaved species bore complex-type N-glycans and were present only at the cell surface therefore suggests that the cleavage process occurred in a late compartment of the secretory pathway on mAb15 recognizing folded or partially folded hTPO forms. The subsequent hTPO immunoprecipitation steps were therefore performed using only the mAb15 antibody.To characterize the site of this processing more exactly, cell radiolabeling experiments were performed in the presence of brefeldin A (BFA) or monensin. These secretory pathway inhibitors induce the disassembly of the Golgi complex and block ER-Golgi transport and Golgi-cell surface vesicular transport of proteins, respectively. In the presence of BFA, which completely blocked the cell surface expression of hTPO (data not shown), only one of the lower bands (94 kDa) was retrieved after deglycosylation (Fig. 2A, lane 4). In the presence of monensin the cell surface expression of hTPO was not completely inhibited (Fig. 2B), but the deglycosylation of the hTPO remaining in the trans-Golgi network gave rise to three different apparent molecular mass populations (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that hTPO cleavages occurred after its transit through the Golgi apparatus but before it reached the cellular surface and that one cleavage can occur when hTPO was retained in the ER under BFA treatment but not under control conditions (Fig. 1C, lanes 1–3)Fig. 2Effects of secretory pathway inhibitors on the hTPO endoproteolytic cleavage process. A, hTPO-CHO cells were metabolically labeled for 24 h with [35S]Met/Cys in the absence (A, lanes 1 and 2) or presence of 10 μg/ml BFA (A, lanes 3 and 4) or 10 μm monensin (Mon) (A, lanes 5 and 6; B, lanes 1–4). After incubation, hTPO-CHO cells were immediately subjected to protein extraction (A, lanes 1–6), or cell surface biotinylation was performed (B). hTPO was immunoprecipitated with mAb15. Samples were treated with PNGase F and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Involvement of Proprotein Convertase(s) in the hTPO Cleavages—To obtain further insights into the endoproteases involved in the proteolytic processing of hTPO, metabolic labeling was performed in the presence of various protease inhibitors. The hTPO cleavages were not affected by serine (aprotin), cysteine (leupeptin) or aspartate (pepstatin A) protease inhibitors. Only the cysteine protease inhibitor E64 and l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone were found to slightly reduce the rate of hTPO cleavage (data not shown).The effects of a proprotein convertase (PPC)-specific inhibitor, CMK, were also tested. Human TPO-CHO cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]Met/Cys for 24 h in the absence or presence of CMK. After extraction and immunoprecipitation, hTPO was digested with PNGase F before SDS-PAGE. Contrary to what occurred with the untreated hTPO-CHO cells in which the 94- and 92-kDa bands could be observed (Fig. 3, lane 2), CMK treatment prevented the formation of cleaved forms. In the presence of 50 or 100 μm CMK, only the 98-kDa band corresponding to the totally deglycosylated full-length hTPO was obtained after digestion with PNGase F (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 6). Moreover, under CMK treatment, a change in the pattern of mobility of glycosylated hTPO was observed. The large 110-kDa band obtained with control hTPO-CHO cells was observed with two distinct species (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 5). The lower apparent molecular mass band (110 kDa) corresponded to the high mannose-type, N-glycan structure of the hTPO found in the intracellular hTPO pool under control culture conditions (Fig. 1C, lane 1), and the upper band (120 kDa) observed in CMK-treated hTPO-CHO cells can be attributed to the non-cleaved hTPO species containing complex-type N-glycan structures.Fig. 3The CMK furin-type convertase inhibitor blocks hTPO cleavages in the CHO cell line. hTPO-CHO cells were metabolically labeled for 24 h with [35S]Met/Cys in the absence (–) or presence (+) of 50 μm (lanes 3 and 4) or 100 μm CMK (lanes 5 and 6). After extraction and hTPO immunoprecipitation with mAb15, samples were incubated or not with 1 unit of PNGase F for 16 h at 37 °C. Samples were then reduced and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. The arrowheads indicate the molecular mass bands corresponding to the cleaved and non-cleaved hTPO species identified in Fig. 1. The arrows point to the complex N-glycan structures bearing hTPO species.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)All these results show that the endoproteolytic cleavage of hTPO is specifically inhibited by CMK and strongly suggests that PPCs may be involved in the hTPO processing. This endoprotease family has been found to be implicated in the maturation of numerous precursors of biological active proteins and peptides such as hormones and neuropeptides (for review, see Ref. 16Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar).Because furin, a member of the PPC family, is known to be required in the processing of various surface glycoproteins such as proreceptors or proproteases, we attempted to determine what role furin itself might possibly play in the processing of hTPO. Transfection of hTPO-pcDNA3 was then performed in the furin-defi"
https://openalex.org/W2103018091,"The major pseudopilin XpsG is an essential component of type II secretion apparatus of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris. Along with other ancillary pseudopilins, it forms a pilus-like structure spanning between cytoplasmic and outer membranes. Associations of pseudopilins with non-pseudopilin members of type II secretion apparatus were not well documented, probably due to their dynamic or unstable nature. In this study, by treating intact cells with a cleavable cross-linker dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (DSP), followed by metal chelating chromatography and immunoblotting on secretion-positive strains of X. campestris pv. campestris, we discovered associations of XpsGh with XpsN (GspC), as well as XpsD. These associations were detectable in a strain missing all components, but XpsO, of the type II secretion apparatus. However, chromosomal non-polar mutation in each gene exerted different effects upon the association between the other two. The XpsGh/XpsD association is undetectable in xpsN mutant; however, it was restored to a limited extent by overproducing XpsD protein. The XpsGh/XpsN association is unaltered by a lack of XpsD protein or an elevation of its abundance. Co-immune precipitation between XpsN and XpsD, while being independent of XpsG, was nonetheless enhanced by raising XpsG protein level. These observations agree with the proposition that the type II secretion apparatus in a cell may exist as an integrated multiprotein complex with all components working in concert. Moreover, in functional machinery, the association of the major pseudopilin XpsG with secretin XpsD appears strongly dependent on the existence of XpsN, the GspC protein.

Type II secretion (T2S) 1The abbreviations used are: T2S, type II secretion; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate); DTSSP, dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylproprionate); DTBP, dimethyl 3,3′-dithiobispropionimidate; β-ME, β-mercaptoethanol; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid.1The abbreviations used are: T2S, type II secretion; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate); DTSSP, dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylproprionate); DTBP, dimethyl 3,3′-dithiobispropionimidate; β-ME, β-mercaptoethanol; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. apparatus is utilized by a wide variety of pathogenic bacteria to secrete toxins or hydrolytic enzymes across outer membrane (1Russel M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 485-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 2Sandkvist M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 271-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Deficiency in any of the apparatus protein components may lead to an accumulation of secretory proteins in periplasm and a severe damage to the bacterial virulence. On the other hand, type IV pilus (Tfp) biogenesis is an evolutionarily related process that is essential in twitching and social gliding motility, biofilm formation, virulence-associated adhesion to cell surface, and phage attachment (3Mattick J.S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2002; 56: 289-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 4Hobbs M. Mattick J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 5Nunn D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 402-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These two processes involve a number of protein components in common, i.e. (i) secretin, known as D protein in T2S apparatus, that forms the secretion channel (6Chen L.Y. Chen D.Y. Miaw J. Hu N.T. J.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1664-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), (iii) a cytoplasmic membrane protein with three membrane-spanning sequences, known as F protein in T2S apparatus (5Nunn D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 402-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 12Thomas J.D. Reeves P.J. Salmond G.P. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and (iv) a group of prepilin-like proteins, also named pseudopilins for having an N-terminal signature sequence of Tfp precursor (5Nunn D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 402-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition, pseudopilins are processed by type IV prepilin leader peptidase, the enzyme that modifies Tfp precursor at its N terminus (13Nunn D.N. Lory S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 14Strom M.S. Nunn D.N. Lory S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2404-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Mutation in the type IV prepilin leader peptidase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been shown to block both the biogenesis of Tfp and T2S (15Nunn D.N. Lory S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4375-4382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pseudopilins have been proposed to form pilus-like structure spanning the cell envelope (4Hobbs M. Mattick J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). G protein, being most abundant, is the major component of the pilus-like structure (15Nunn D.N. Lory S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4375-4382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PulG protein of Klebsiella oxytoca was demonstrated to form a bundled pilus-like structure on cell surface, when all 15 pul genes involved in pullulanase secretion were overexpressed in Escherichia coli (16Sauvonnet N. Vignon G. Pugsley A.P. Gounon P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Likewise, XcpTG of P. aeruginosa, when overproduced alone, also appeared as a bundled pilus-like structure on cell surface (17Durand E. Bernadac A. Ball G. Lazdunski A. Sturgis J.N. Filloux A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2749-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, secretion was blocked in the latter case. The pul gene products could, in addition, support formation of surface-exposed pili comprised of heterologous G proteins that share greater than 50% overall sequence similarity with PulG (18Vignon G. Kohler R. Larquet E. Giroux S. Prevost M-C. Roux P. Pugsley A.P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3416-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The xcp gene products also supported formation of bundled pilus-like structure comprised of G protein of a closely related species Pseudomonas alcaligenes (17Durand E. Bernadac A. Ball G. Lazdunski A. Sturgis J.N. Filloux A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2749-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Moreover, a large sized form of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris XpsG protein detected in a secretion-positive strain was proposed to derive, during cell breakage, from the pilus-like structure spanning between cytoplasmic and outer membranes (19Hu N.T. Leu W.M. Lee M.S. Chen A. Chen S.C. Song Y.L. Chen L.Y. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 205-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to self-cross-linking, the major pseudopilin has been shown to cross-link with minor pseudopilins as well as type IV pilin (20Lu H.M. Motley S.T. Lory S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Several possible roles have been proposed for the pilus-like structure in T2S (21Shevchik V.E. Robert-Baudouy J. Condemine G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3007-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 22Filloux A. Michel G. Bally M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 22: 177-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 23Mattick J.S. Alm R.A. Trends Microbiol. 1995; 3: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (35) Google Scholar). One is to act like a piston or a ratchet, by actively pushing or rotating, driving the secreted proteins to pass through the secretion channel. Repeated extension and retraction of Tfp required for twitching motility has been postulated for the pilus-like structure in T2S apparatus. However, one nucleotide-binding protein is sufficient for T2S (24d'Enfert C. Ryter A. Pugsley A.P. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3531-3538Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 25Lindeberg M. Salmond G.P. Collmer A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 175-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In contrast, two proteins are required in twitching motility, one (PilB protein as designated in P. aeruginosa) for pilus extension and the other (PilT protein as designated in P. aeruginosa) for its retraction (3Mattick J.S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2002; 56: 289-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 26Wolfgang M. Park H.S. Hayes S.F. van Putten J.P. Koomey M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14973-14978Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A second role proposed for the pilus-like structure is to provide a scaffold, between cytoplasmic and outer membranes, probably guiding the secreted proteins to the secretion channel. The third possibility is for the central hollow space of the pilus-like structure serving as passage for secreted proteins. Based on the models deduced for Tfp, a central cavity with a diameter of 10 or 18 Å in the thin filament was revealed (27Craig L. Pique M.E. Tainer J.A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 363-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). If the pilus-like structure in T2S apparatus is similar to Tfp, the central cavity would be too small for the assembled protein complex to pass through. It is known that the cholera toxin comprised of one A and five B subunits is assembled before being secreted through the Vibrio cholerae T2S apparatus (28Hirst T.R. Holmgren J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7418-7422Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Complementation of non-polar mutation in the out genes of Erwinia chrysanthimi with the out genes of a closely related species Erwinia carotovora revealed that all, except OutC and OutD, are replaceable (25Lindeberg M. Salmond G.P. Collmer A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 175-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). C and D proteins were thus postulated to be the gate-keepers of T2S apparatus. Further analysis indicated that a C-terminal PDZ domain of OutC and the N-terminal domain of OutD are determinants of substrate specificity (29Bouley J. Condemine G. Shevchik V.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Direct association between X. campestris pv. campestris XpsN (GspC) and XpsD proteins were suggested by their co-immune precipitation (30Lee H.M. Wang K.C. Liu Y.L. Yew H.Y. Chen L.Y. Leu W.M. Chen D.C. Hu N.T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1549-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). On the other hand, XpsN (GspC) protein was also shown to form a ternary complex with two other bitopic cytoplasmic membrane proteins XpsL and XpsM (31Lee H.M. Tyan S.W. Leu W.M. Chen L.Y. Chen D.C. Hu N.T. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 528-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The XpsL analogue in V. cholerae, EpsL protein, has been demonstrated to mediate the association of its nucleotide-binding protein, EpsE protein, with cytoplasmic membrane (11Sandkvist M. Bagdasarian M. Howard S.P. DiRita V.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1664-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the association of E. chrysanthemi OutF protein with OutL and OutE proteins was suggested from yeast two-hybrid studies and co-immune precipitation experiments (32Py B. Loiseau L. Barras F. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A quaternary complex comprising OutE, -F, -L, and -M was thus hypothesized to form a platform for the assembly of the pilus-like structure. The first evidence for cross-talk between non-pseudopilin and pseudopilin components was from a genetic approach that implicates possible interaction between P. aeruginosa major pseudopilin XcpTG and its nucleotide-binding protein XcpRE (33Kagami Y. Ratliff M. Surber M. Martinez A. Nunn D.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Overproduction of K. oxytoca PulG caused a loss of PulC, -D, -E, -L, and -M (34Possot O.M. Vignon G. Bomchil N. Ebel F. Pugsley A.P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2142-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This has been taken as evidence for an interaction between PulG and these proteins. Furthermore, results from yeast two-hybrid system suggested an interaction between a minor pseudopilin OutJ and OutD, secretin of E. chrysanthemi, as well as OutL (35Douet V. Loiseau L. Barras F. Py B. Res. Microbiol. 2004; 155: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, no evidence has so far been available showing a direct connection between pseudopilin and non-pseudopilin protein components. In this study, by performing cross-linking, followed by metal chelating chromatography and immunoblotting analysis, we were able to detect, for the first time, an association of the major pseudopilin XpsG with the GspC protein XpsN and secretin XpsD in functional strains of X. campestris pv. campestris. In addition, analysis of pairwise interaction in mutant deficient in the third party indicated complex protein-protein interactions among the three components. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—X. campestris pv. campestris XC1701 was isolated as a spontaneously derived rifampicin-resistant mutant of the wild isolate XC17 (36Hu N.T. Hung M.N. Chiou S.J. Tang F. Chiang D.C. Huang H.Y. Wu C.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2679-2687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All other mutants were derivatives of XC1701. XC1708 is an xpsD::Tn5 mutant (36Hu N.T. Hung M.N. Chiou S.J. Tang F. Chiang D.C. Huang H.Y. Wu C.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2679-2687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). XC1709 (30Lee H.M. Wang K.C. Liu Y.L. Yew H.Y. Chen L.Y. Leu W.M. Chen D.C. Hu N.T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1549-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and XC1713 (19Hu N.T. Leu W.M. Lee M.S. Chen A. Chen S.C. Song Y.L. Chen L.Y. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 205-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are non-polar mutants, with in-frame deletion in xpsN and xpsG genes, respectively. XC17433, generated from Tn5 mutagenesis, is deleted in the entire xps gene cluster encoding 11 xps genes (36Hu N.T. Hung M.N. Chiou S.J. Tang F. Chiang D.C. Huang H.Y. Wu C.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2679-2687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmids pFG and pFGh, each encoding an untagged and a C-terminally His6-tagged XpsGh protein, respectively, was constructed in our previous studies (19Hu N.T. Leu W.M. Lee M.S. Chen A. Chen S.C. Song Y.L. Chen L.Y. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 205-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pNC2 carrying the wild-type xpsN gene on a broad host-range vector pCPP30 was constructed in a previous study (30Lee H.M. Wang K.C. Liu Y.L. Yew H.Y. Chen L.Y. Leu W.M. Chen D.C. Hu N.T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1549-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The plasmid pHMNZ carries the same xpsN gene as in pNC2 but in a different broad host-range vector pBBR1MCS-5 (37Kovach M.E. Elzer P.H. Hill D.S. Robertson G.T. Farris M.A. Roop R.M. Peterson K.M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 166: 175-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2693) Google Scholar), which is compatible with pCPP30. A 1.2-kb HindIII-EcoRI fragment from pNC2 was subcloned in pBBR1MCS-5. Moreover, an NsiI-HindIII fragment containing the lac promoter from pCPP30 was introduced upstream of the xpsN gene to improve the xpsN gene expression. The plasmid pHMNh encoding the XpsN with a C-terminal His6 tag was obtained by ligating a 1.2-kb HindIII-XhoI fragment in-frame with six downstream His codons located on pCPP30. The plasmid pHM118 encoding the wild-type XpsD was constructed by subcloning a 2.9-kb HindIII-EcoRI fragment in the vector pBBR1MCS-5. Chemical Cross-linking—X. campestris pv. campestris grown in Luria-Bertani broth at 28 °C to exponential phase (attenuance (D600) of ∼1.0) were harvested. After washing twice with water to remove exopolysaccharide, the cells were suspended at 0.10 culture volume of phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.5) buffer. The cross-linkers DSP and DTSSP were added to a final concentration of 0.8 mm, and DTBP to 40 mm. At the end of 2-h incubation on ice, the cross-linking reactions were terminated by adding Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, buffer to a final concentration of 50 mm. Following brief centrifugation to remove the cross-linker, the pellet was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and divided into two parts. Each was resuspended in the SDS-PAGE sample buffer, one containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) and the other without, and separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by immunoblotting with anti-XpsG antiserum. Preparation of Membrane Protein Extract—Cells from a 200-ml culture were harvested and treated with the cross-linker DSP as described in the previous section. After the cross-linking reaction was terminated, the cells collected from a brief centrifugation were broken by passing through French press at 16,000 lbs/in2. After removal of unbroken cells by centrifugation at 4300 × g for 10 min, membrane vesicles were collected as the pellet from ultracentrifugation at 233,000 × g for 45 min and suspended in 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, followed by addition of 9 ml of urea-containing membrane extraction buffer (0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 8 m urea). Urea was included to raise specific binding of XpsGh to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin. In the case of examining cross-linking of the outer membrane protein XpsD with XpsGh, 0.3% SDS was also included. Following gentle mixing at room temperature overnight, the membrane protein extract was collected as the supernatant from ultracentrifugation at 233,000 × g for 45 min. Metal Chelating Chromatography—Five milligrams of the membrane proteins extracted in membrane extraction buffer was gently mixed with 1 ml of Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) at room temperature for 30 min before the resin was packed in a column. The collected flow-through was then repeatedly passed through the column three times before saving the last one (flow-through). To remove proteins that are nonspecifically bound to nickel, 25 times the resin volume of the urea-containing wash buffer (0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.0, 1% Triton X-100, 8 m urea) was passed through the column and the first and the last wash fractions, each at 1 ml/fraction, were saved. Finally, the resin-bound protein was eluted with five times the resin volume of the urea-containing elution (UE) buffer (0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 4.5, 1% Triton X-100, 8 m urea) and collected at 1 ml/fraction. Each elute fraction (E1 to E5) was concentrated 30-fold with a final concentration of 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed with a 1:1 mixture of ethanol and ether, and then suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Ten microliters of FT, W1, Wf, and all five concentrated elute fractions were mixed with equal volume of 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 10% β-ME and boiled for 10 min before separation in SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Co-immune Precipitation—The procedures of Lee et al. (30Lee H.M. Wang K.C. Liu Y.L. Yew H.Y. Chen L.Y. Leu W.M. Chen D.C. Hu N.T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1549-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) were followed with slight modifications. Membrane proteins were extracted at 4 °C overnight with Triton extraction (TE) buffer (20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 2% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The membrane extract (at 1.5 mg/ml), collected as the supernatant from ultracentrifugation at 233,000 × g for 45 min, was incubated with anti-XpsN antiserum (at 1:40 dilution) at 4 °C overnight followed by mixing with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (at the final concentration of 10%, v/v) at 4 °C for 2 h. The resin was washed three times with TE buffer and twice with the TE without NaCl, before it was suspended in the SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After boiling, the samples were then separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-XpsN and anti-XpsD antisera. XpsG-containing Large Sized Molecules Generated from DSP Treatment of Intact Cells—Although cross-linked heterodimers of various combinations have been demonstrated among four of the P. aeruginosa pseudopilins (20Lu H.M. Motley S.T. Lory S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), no information is so far available regarding a direct association between pseudopilin and any non-pseudopilin components of T2S apparatus. To facilitate our search for possible interactive partners of the pilus-like structure, we examined three different disulfide-containing cross-linkers for their ability to cause dimerization of the major pseudopilin XpsG. After washing with water to remove exopolysaccharide, cells were suspended in 0.10 volume of phosphate-buffered saline and treated with each cross-linker at different concentrations for 2 h. Protein samples prepared from total cells were subsequently separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gel, with or without β-ME, followed by immunoblotting with anti-XpsG antiserum. Preliminary results indicated that only DSP, but not DTSSP or DTBP, could cause XpsG to form large sized molecules that are sensitive to β-ME. Detailed analysis showed that monomeric XpsG migrated as a major band with an apparent molecular mass of 14 kDa. In addition, at least six bands ranging from 23 to 175 kDa were detectable in DSP-treated wild-type strain XC1701; however, they were absent in xpsG mutant strain XC1713 (Fig. 1A). These bands were present only when β-ME was excluded from sample buffer, implying the involvement of disulfide bond. Beside the 24-kDa band, the other five protein bands could have arisen from self-cross-linking of XpsG or its cross-linking with other minor pseudopilins. Finally, the possibility of cross-linking between XpsG and other non-pseudopilin components could not be excluded.Fig. 2Metal chelating chromatography analysis of cross-linking between XpsGh and XpsN (A), XpsNh and XpsG (B), and XpsGh and XpsD (C), in complemented strains. XC1713 and XC1709 are, respectively, the xpsG and xpsN mutants. The plasmids pFGh and pFG encode, respectively, the wild-type XpsG with or without a C-terminal His6 tag. The plasmids pHMNh and pNC2 encode, respectively, the wild-type XpsN with or without a C-terminal His6 tag. Metal chelating chromatography was conducted in the presence of 8 m urea. Immunoblotting was performed using each antiserum at a 1:1000 dilution. The signals were detected by using ECL chemiluminescent substrate for horseradish peroxidase. Samples loaded in SDS-polyacrylamide gel were designated as follows: T, total membrane protein extract; FT, flow-through; W1 and Wf, the first and the last wash fractions, respectively. E1 to E5, 30-times concentrated, elute fractions collected at 1 ml/fraction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 1In vivo cross-linking followed by separating total cell lysate in SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-XpsG antiserum.

It complemented the xpsG mutant XC1713 as well as the wild-type XpsG as shown by α-amylase secretion assay (data not shown). To improve XpsGh binding to nickel, metal chelating chromatography was performed in the presence of 8 m urea. DSP cross-linking, followed by metal chelating chromatography of Triton X-100 extract of membrane proteins of XC1713(pFGh), revealed that only XpsN co-eluted with XpsGh (Fig. 2A); none of XpsL, XpsM, XpsE, or XpsF did (data not shown). XpsN detected in elution fractions E2 and E3 of the control experiment, in which the untagged XpsG was present, is much weaker than that co-eluting with the XpsGh. Conversely, when His6 tag was present on XpsN, co-elution of XpsG became apparent (Fig. 2B), confirming their interactive relationship. A mutant XpsN protein with its residues 34–131 missing is produced from xpsN mutant strain XC1709, which is detectable on immunoblot. In identical experiments as before on XC1709(pFGh), we found no truncated XpsN protein in the cross-linked products containing XpsGh (data not shown), ruling out the possibility that cross-linking between the full-length XpsN and XpsGh could result from nonspecific interaction. The association of XpsN with secretin XpsD, which constitutes the secretion channel in outer membrane, has been demonstrated with co-immune precipitation experiment. We thus are interested to find out if the XpsD is also present in the XpsG-containing cross-linked products. Since EDTA will strip the affinity ligand off Ni-NTA resin, it is not applicable in metal chelating chromatography. To circumvent its requirement in extracting outer membrane proteins, we included 0.3% SDS while performing membrane protein extraction with Triton X-100. DSP treatment and metal chelating chromatography in the presence of 8 m urea were identical to the previous experiment. Immunoblotting with anti-XpsD antiserum revealed that XpsD co-eluted with XpsGh but not with untagged XpsG (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the two are likely to associate with each other in the cell. Cross-linking between XpsG and XpsN or XpsD in the Absence of Other Xps Proteins—To determine whether cross-linking between XpsGh and XpsN or XpsD is mediated by other T2S apparatus protein components, we asked, using an xps deletion strain XC17433, whether or not they cross-linked in the absence of other Xps proteins. Along with either pFGh or the pFG plasmid encoding His6-tagged or untagged XpsG, the plasmid pHMNZ encoding XpsN or the plasmid pHM118 encoding XpsD was introduced into XC17433. Cross-linking, metal chelating chromatography, and immunoblotting identical to previous experiments were performed. The results indicate that, in absence of other Xps proteins, XpsN or XpsD remained capable of associating with XpsGh but not the untagged XpsG (Fig. 3). Despite a weak nonspecific binding of untagged XpsG with the resin, no XpsD was detected in the eluate. In addition, two XpsG signals were observed in strains that expressed the His6-tagged XpsGh (Fig. 3, A and B, left panel), with intensity ratios varying from sample to sample. However, the signal of the fast-migrating band tends to be stronger than that of the slow one in the elute fractions. Due to its appearance in elute fractions, as well as its being detectable with antibody against the His6 tag (data not shown), we designated it XpsGh*. So far, we have no explanation for its appearance. Disappearance of Cross-linking between XpsGh and XpsD in xpsN Mutant Strain—The above experiment indicates that, when overproduced from plasmid-enco"
https://openalex.org/W2012095629,"The four-transmembrane domain proteins synaptophysin and synaptogyrin represent the major constituents of synaptic vesicles. Our previous studies in PC12 cells demonstrated that synaptogyrin or its nonneuronal paralog cellugyrin targets efficiently to synaptic-like microvesicles (SLMVs) and dramatically increases the synaptophysin content of SLMVs (Belfort, G. M., and Kandror, K. V. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 47971–47978). Here, we explored the mechanism of these phenomena and found that ectopic expression of cellugyrin increases the number of SLMVs in PC12 cells. Mutagenesis studies revealed that cellugyrin's hydrophilic cytoplasmic domains are not involved in vesicle biogenesis, whereas small conserved hydrophobic hairpins in the first luminal loop and the carboxyl terminus of cellugyrin were found to be critical for the formation of SLMVs. In addition, the length but not the primary sequence of the second luminal loop was essential for SLMV biogenesis. We suggest that changing the length of this loop similar to disruption of the short hydrophobic hairpins alters the position of the vicinal transmembrane domains that may be crucial for protein function.

Understanding the mechanisms by which a cell sequesters specific proteins in unique subcellular compartments is fundamental to understanding how the cell maintains distinct organelles. For the past 25 years, the PC12 neuroendocrine cell line has provided a convenient system for studying the biogenesis of synaptic like microvesicles (SLMVs) 1The abbreviations used are: SLMV, synaptic-like microvesicle; PNS, postnuclear supernatant(s); PAS, postabsorptive supernatant(s); TE, Triton elution; SE, SDS elution; TM, transmembrane; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. (1Johnston P. Cameron P.L. Stukenbrok H. Jahn R. De Camilli P. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2863-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). SLMVs were chosen as a model organelle, because, like neuronal synaptic vesicles, their small size (∼50 nm) restricts the number of proteins present in each vesicle. Based on the estimates of 3 × 106 daltons of protein/synaptic vesicle and 50,000 daltons/average protein, ∼60 proteins could be contained in a vesicle of this size (2Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Two main methods have been used to study the biogenesis of SLMVs. Several groups have studied cell-free or perforated cell vesicle budding systems in order to identify cytosolic factors critical for vesicle budding. Others studying specific proteins that target to SLMVs have identified regions in their primary amino acid sequences that are required for targeting to that compartment. Two main pathways of SLMV biogenesis have emerged from in vitro studies. First, vesicles can bud from endosomes in a brefeldin A-sensitive mechanism that requires the AP3 adaptor protein and the ARF1 and Rab4 GTPases (3Faundez V. Horng J.T. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 4Lichtenstein Y. Desnos C. Faundez V. Kelly R.B. Clift-O'Grady L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2001; 12: 3703-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). By the second pathway, SLMVs can bud from the plasma membrane in a brefeldin A-insensitive mechanism that involves the AP2 adapter, clathrin, and dynamin (7Shi G. Faundez V. Roos J. Dell'Angelica E.C. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 947-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Further work with perforated PC12 cells demonstrated that endophilin I, a dynamin-binding protein, facilitates SLMV budding, probably by modifying the membrane lipid composition (8Schmidt A. Wolde M. Thiele C. Fest W. Kratzin H. Podtelejnikov V. Witke W. Huttner W.B. Soling H.D. Nature. 1999; 401: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Two categories of proteins are present in SLMVs in PC12 cells: neuronal synaptic vesicle proteins and other proteins that are not found in brain synaptic vesicles. Of those proteins belonging to the former category, synaptophysin, synaptobrevin/VAMPII, the vesicular acetylcholine transporter, and synaptotagmin I have all been at least partially analyzed for SLMV targeting sequences (9Leube R.E.

Cell. 1999; 10: 3979-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The group of nonsynaptic vesicle proteins localized in SLMVs can be further divided into the nonneuronal paralogs of synaptic vesicle proteins (cellubrevin, cellugyrin, and pantophysin) (14Chilcote T.J. Galli T. Mundigl O. Edelmann L. McPherson P.S. Takei K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 15Belfort G.M. Kandror K.V. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 731-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and those proteins that are unrelated to synaptic vesicle proteins (tyrosinase and P-selectin) (13Blagoveshchenskaya D. Hewitt E.W. Cutler D.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3979-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17Norcott J.P. Solari R. Cutler D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1229-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These studies, which examined targeting motifs, failed to identify a universal sequence applicable to all SLMV proteins. The one commonality among all of the targeting motifs identified so far is that they are all located in cytoplasmic domains. The question then arises as to what mechanisms maintain the structural integrity of SLMVs, such that, despite the complexity of their trafficking pathways in the cells and apparent heterogeneity of targeting signals, these vesicles maintain uniform and specific protein composition? Undoubtedly, adaptor proteins provide a certain level of specificity upon vesicle budding from the donor membranes. However, given the fact that at least two adaptors, AP-2 and AP-3, with different binding specificities, are involved in the formation of vesicles with the same protein composition from different compartments, we speculate that additional factors should participate in the formation of SLMVs. Cellugyrin (also referred to as synaptogyrin 2) is the nonneuronal paralog of the synaptic vesicle protein, synaptogyrin 1. Both cellugyrin and synaptogyrin 1 target to SLMVs in PC12 cells, and both do so with a much higher efficiency than any other protein tested so far (15Belfort G.M. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47971-47978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Increasing the level of cellugyrin or synaptogyrin 1 in PC12 cells also causes a concomitant increase of endogenous synaptophysin in SLMVs. Here, we report that cellugyrin expression is sufficient to induce the biogenesis of SLMVs, as measured by two independent methods. Furthermore, despite the finding that cellugyrin and synaptogyrin are capable of targeting very efficiently to microvesicles in all cell types tested, the capacity to facilitate targeting of synaptophysin to microvesicles was not replicated in a nonneuronal cell line (COS7 cells). These results suggest that the capacity of cellugyrin to facilitate the targeting of synaptophysin is not an artifact of overexpression but rather represents an epiphenomenon of cellugyrin targeting to microvesicles that requires cell type-specific factors. In support of this latter hypothesis, molecular dissection of cellugyrin via recombinant DNA techniques revealed that the targeting of cellugyrin mutants to SLMVs can be uncoupled from cellugyrin's effects on synaptophysin targeting. These studies demonstrated that conserved hydrophobic sequences in the carboxyl-terminal domain and the first luminal loop, in addition to the lengths, but not the primary sequences, of the second luminal loop and the cytoplasmic loop are key determinants for efficient SLMV targeting. Furthermore, inefficiencies in the targeting of these mutants to SLMVs yielded an even more significant decrease in the facilitation of synaptophysin targeting. We hypothesize that the highly efficient targeting of cellugyrin and synaptogyrin 1 to SLMVs and their ability to facilitate the targeting of synaptophysin is dependent on their capacity to increase the number of SLMVs and that this function is mediated by the regions identified in our targeting studies.

COS7 cells, a monkey kidney cell line, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transfections were performed with Lipofectamine2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Optimal transfections were obtained with 5 μg of DNA/10-cm plate and a Lipofectamine2000 reagent to plasmid ratio of 3 μl/μg of DNA. The efficiency of transfection was over 90%. Stably transfected cell lines were selected by culturing transiently transfected cells in the presence of G418 for 30 days. Vesicle Isolation and Fractionation of PC12 Cells—Confluent 15- or 10-cm plates were washed once with PBS. Cells were removed from the plates with cell dissociation medium (Sigma) for PC12 cells or trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen) for COS7. Cells in suspension were pelleted at 400 × g for 10 min. Pelleted cells were resuspended in Buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm MgCl2) with protease inhibitors (1 μm aprotinin, 5 mm benzamidine, 2 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Resuspended cells were homogenized with 11 strokes through a ball bearing cell cracker (European Molecular Biology Laboratory) and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min to generate a postnuclear supernatant (PNS). A high speed supernatant (S2) that contains only microvesicles and cytosolic proteins was generated by centrifugation of the PNS at 27,000 × g (15,000 rpm) for 35 min in a Ti42.2 rotor (Beckman) (18Clift-O'Grady L. Linstedt D. Lowe W. Grote E. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Density gradient centrifugation was performed by layering ∼1 mg of S2, adjusted to 230 μl, onto a 4.6-ml 10–50% sucrose gradient in Buffer A (w/v). Density gradients were centrifuged at 280,000 × g (48,000 rpm) in an SW55 rotor (Beckman) for 16 h. Fractions were collected from the bottom via a peristaltic pump. Vesicle decoration/shift analysis was performed by incubating 1 mg of S2 with 2.5 μg of purified nonspecific mouse IgG or anti-synaptophysin monoclonal antibodies, together with 2 μg of Nanogold-conjugated goat anti-mouse Fab fragments (Nanoprobes). This mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 2 h. The total volume of decorated vesicles (always adjusted to 230 μl) was then loaded on a 4.6-ml linear 10–30% sucrose gradient in Buffer A (w/v). Gradients were centrifuged at 280,000 × g (48,000 rpm) in an SW55 rotor (Beckman) for 1 h and 15 min. Fractions were collected from the bottom via a peristaltic pump. Vesicle Isolation and Fractionation of COS7 Cells—Confluent 15- or 10-cm plates were washed once with PBS. Cells were removed from the plates with trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen). Cells in suspension were pelleted at 400 × g for 10 min. Pelleted cells were resuspended in Buffer A with protease inhibitors. Resuspended cells were homogenized with 11 strokes through a ball bearing cell cracker (European Molecular Biology Laboratory) and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet (16,000 × g pellet) represents total expression, and the supernatant (16,000 × g supernatant) represents the microvesicular fraction. The 16,000 × g pellet was extracted with a 1% solution of Triton X-100 in Buffer A. This isolation method was tested in tandem with the PNS/S2 isolation method (see above) in PC12 cells and found to be functionally equivalent. Radioactive Labeling and Organelle Immunoisolation—Whole cell lipids were labeled as previously reported (19Schreiber B.M. Veverbrants M. Fine R.E. Blusztajn J.K. Salmona M. Patel Sipe J.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 7-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated overnight with 8 μCi of [1-14C]acetic acid, sodium salt (40–60 mCi/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A PNS was prepared and then assayed for protein concentration. PNS from empty vector- and pHis-cellugyrin-transfected cells were adjusted to the same protein concentration. A high speed supernatant was prepared (S2). Goat anti-mouse magnetic beads (Dynal) were precoated for 2 h with 2 μg of nonspecific IgG or synaptophysin antibody and washed with Buffer A. Equal quantities of IgG or synaptophysin-coated beads were mixed overnight in S2 from empty vector- or synaptophysin-transfected cells. Unbound material, referred to here as postabsorptive supernatants (PAS) was removed. The beads were washed three times with Buffer A. Triton elution (TE), with 1% Triton X-100 in Buffer A, was used to elute the lipids from the beads. SDS elution (SE), performed with Laemmli sample buffer, was used to remove the bound antibody (anti-synaptophysin) and its ligand (synaptophysin) from the bead (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Radioactivity of the culture media at time 0 and 24 h, PNS, S2, PAS, TE, and SE was quantified in a 1217 cintillation counter (LKB Wallace). In addition, PAS, TE, and SE were subjected to Western blot analysis. Immunofluorescence—PC12 cells transfected with pMyc/His-CR1–177-SCR67–76, which codes for rat cellugyrin with a truncated carboxyl terminus, a scrambled first luminal loop, and a carboxyl-terminal Myc/His tag, were lifted and grown on coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine overnight. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, blocked with 4% donkey serum, and probed with either monoclonal anti-Myc and polyclonal anti-calnexin or polyclonal anti-Myc and monoclonal anti-synaptophysin antibodies followed by Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Incubation with primary and secondary antibodies lasted for 60 min at room temperature and was followed by six quick rinses with PBS. Next, nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride according to the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes). The SlowFade-Light Antifade kit (Molecular Probes) was used for mounting coverslips onto slides. Staining was examined by fluorescence microscopy (Axiovert 200M; Zeiss). Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Following transfer, the membrane was blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk in PBST for 1 h at 25 °C and probed with specific antibodies overnight. The following day membranes were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After three more washes, the membranes were incubated in ECL reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 min and then exposed to an Eastman Kodak Co. 440 image station. Data analysis was performed with Kodak 1D image analysis software. Hydropathy Plot Generation—The hydropathy plot of rat cellugyrin was generated by the Kyte-Doolittle method available on the Biology Workbench (available on the World Wide Web at workbench.sdsc. edu/) (21Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17297) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Student's unpaired two-tailed t test was used to evaluate the statistical significance of the differences in targeting efficiencies. Targeting efficiency is defined as the amount of a specific protein in the S2 fraction normalized to the total amount of the same protein in the PNS. A paired t test was used to evaluate the statistical significance of the difference between synaptophysin-attributable radioactive counts in the Triton X-100 extract from empty vector and pHis-cellugyrin-transfected cells. Synaptophysin-attributable counts are defined as the counts precipitated with synaptophysin antibody minus the counts precipitated with nonspecific IgG. Cellugyrin Increases the Number of SLMVs in the Cell—In order to further characterize the biological role of cellugyrin, we explored the impact of exogenous cellugyrin expression on the physical characteristics of the SLMV. In a previous publication (15Belfort G.M. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47971-47978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we showed that increasing the cellugyrin levels in the SLMV had no impact on vesicle size, since sedimentation in glycerol velocity gradients was unchanged. Now we asked whether the vesicles changed in buoyant density, hypothesizing that an increase in protein per vesicle should increase the buoyant density of the vesicles (Fig. 1). High speed supernatants (S2) from empty vector and pHis-cellugyrin-transfected cells were loaded on continuous 10–50% sucrose gradients and centrifuged for 16 h at 280,000 × g. The peak of cellugyrin and synaptophysin in both empty vector and His-cellugyrin-transfected cells is between fractions 11 and 15 (Fig. 1). Note that both endogenous and transfected cellugyrin signals are detectable in the lower cellugyrin panel. These experiments reveal that the vesicle pool from cellugyrin-transfected cells are the same buoyant density as those from empty vector-transfected cells. Given that the vesicles are the same size and buoyant density, we hypothesized that cellugyrin increases the number of vesicles per cell and that these new vesicles accommodate the increased accumulation of proteins. We tested this hypothesis using two independent approaches. First we used a method developed in our laboratory called antibody decoration/shift analysis. This method involves the addition of an excess of a single monoclonal antibody to a high speed supernatant (S2) containing the SLMVs. During the incubation period, the antibody binds to the cytoplasmic epitope of the target protein in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio. Excess Nanogold-conjugated goat anti-mouse Fab fragments are included in the incubation to add more mass to each antibody. Next, the decorated vesicles are loaded on to a linear 10–30% sucrose gradient and centrifuged (see “Experimental Procedures”). Vesicles with a high copy number of the target protein migrate farther than vesicles with a lower copy number, because they are bound by more specific antibodies and in turn more Nanogold-labeled Fab fragments. In Fig. 2, we compared the shift of vesicles from empty vector- and cellugyrin-transfected cells using synaptophysin as the shifting antibody and nonspecific purified mouse IgG as the control. In the presence of nonspecific IgG, vesicles from both empty vector- and His-cellugyrin-transfected cells sediment with a peak between fractions 15 and 17. Anti-synaptophysin antibody shifts both peaks to between fractions 1 and 13. These data suggest that vesicles from cellugyrin-over-expressing cells and empty vector controls contain the same number of synaptophysin molecules. This implies that the increase in synaptophysin seen in the high speed supernatant (S2) is in fact explained by a greater number of vesicles. In order to verify the result obtained by antibody decoration/shift analysis, radioactive lipid labeling experiments were performed (Fig. 3, A and B). Cells transiently (Fig. 3A) or stably (Fig. 3B) transfected with either empty vector or His-cellugyrin were incubated in [1-14C]acetate overnight. A PNS was isolated, followed by adjustment of the protein concentrations of the different PNS samples so that they were equal. Then a high speed supernatant (S2) was obtained and split into two aliquots, one for immunoadsorption with anti-synaptophysin-coated goat antimouse magnetic beads and the other for mock immunoadsorption with nonspecific IgG-coated beads. The precipitated lipids along with vesicular proteins were eluted with 1% Triton X-100 (TE). Antibody and ligand were then eluted with SDS-containing sample buffer (SE). Liquid scintillation counting of the TE samples revealed ∼2.5-fold increase in the lipid content in these vesicles (p < 0.03) (Fig. 3, A and B). Given that the vesicles are the same size and density, this strongly suggests that expression of cellugyrin leads to an increase in the number of SLMVs. Fig. 3C demonstrates a Western blot analysis of fractions obtained during organelle immunoisolation. Cellugyrin's Effect on Synaptophysin Targeting Is Specific for PC12 Cells—Cellugyrin is a marker for ubiquitous microvesicles present in all cell types tested, including the COS7 monkey kidney cell line (15Belfort G.M. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47971-47978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In order to explore whether or not gyrins can exert their effects in nonneuronal cells, we co-transfected His-cellugyrin (or His-synaptogyrin) with His-synaptophysin in COS7 cells (Fig. 4). Note that synaptophysin ectopically expressed in COS7 cells represents a doublet, which is consistent with earlier results of Linstedt and Kelly (22Linstedt A.D. Kelly R.B. Neuron. 1991; 7: 309-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Total expression levels per microgram of transfected DNA of all three proteins were similar to one another in COS7 as well as in PC12 cells. In agreement with previously published results (15Belfort G.M. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47971-47978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), a significant fraction of ectopically expressed cellugyrin and synaptogyrin were found in the fraction of light vesicles recovered in the 16,000 × g supernatant of both COS7 and PC12 cells, suggesting that proteins of the gyrin family can facilitate formation of microvesicles in various different cells. Synaptophysin alone was not targeted efficiently to microvesicles in either cell type. In addition, cellugyrin and synaptogyrin did not facilitate the targeting of synaptophysin to the microvesicular compartment in COS7 cells, as they do in PC12 cells. These results argue against the possibility that the facilitation of synaptophysin targeting by either cellugyrin or synaptogyrin 1 represents an artifact of protein overexpression. Instead, these data suggest that synaptophysin targeting to the newly formed compartment requires a factor or factors that are only expressed in certain cell types. Mapping of Functional Domains of Cellugyrin—A comprehensive analysis of the rat cellugyrin protein was undertaken using recombinant DNA technology to identify domains responsible for the formation of SLMVs as well as cellugyrin's effect on synaptophysin targeting in PC12 cells (15Belfort G.M.

Recent study of (TRAP) gene expression has provided evidence for distinct promoters within the (TRAP) gene, suggesting that the gene has alternative, tissue-preferred mRNA transcripts. Examination of endogenous (TRAP) exon 1B and 1C mRNA transcripts revealed tissue-preferred transcript abundance with increased exon 1B transcripts detected in liver and kidney and increased exon 1C transcripts detected in bone and spleen. In this investigation, we have made transgenic mice that express a marker gene driven by two candidate promoters, designated BC and C, within the (TRAP) gene. The BC and C promoters are 2.2 and 1.6 kb, respectively, measured from the translation initiation site. Evaluation of BC transgenic lines demonstrated robust expression in multiple tissues. In contrast, significant transgene expression was not detected in C transgenic lines. Evaluation of transgene mRNAs in BC transgenic lines revealed that virtually all expression was in the form of B transcripts, suggesting that the tissue-preferred pattern of endogenous (TRAP) was not replicated in the BC transgenic line. Likewise, osteoclastogenic cultures from BC, but not C, transgenic bone marrow cells expressed the transgene following receptor activator of NFκB ligand/macrophage colony-stimulating factor stimulation. In conclusion, when compared with the 2.2-kb BC portion of the (TRAP) promoter region, the 1.6-kb C portion does not account for significant gene expression in vivo or in vitro; production of the bone- and spleen-preferred (TRAP) C transcript must depend on regulatory elements outside of the 2.2-kb promoter. As the majority of currently investigated transcription factors that influence transcriptional regulation of osteoclast gene expression bind within the 1.6-kb C portion of the (TRAP) promoter, it is likely that transcription binding sites outside of the 2.2-kb region will have profound effects on regulation of the gene in vivo and in vitro.

TRAP activity in the liver and kidney is predominantly in liver parenchymal cells and glomerular mesangial cells, respectively. TRAP activity in spleen, lung, and pancreas has been credited to mononuclear phagocytes (2Angel N.Z. Walsh N. Forwood M.R. Ostrowski M.C. Cassady A.I. Hume D.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and TRAP expression in bone is attributed to osteoclasts and their precursor cells. Several mammalian TRAP genes have been cloned, and the intron-exon structure of the TRAP gene is highly conserved in all species studied to date, including mouse, rat, pig, and human (3Cassady A.I.

Leukemia. 1996; 10: 637-643PubMed Google Scholar). Endogenous TRAP expression, based on detection of TRAP mRNA, has been revealed in a variety of tissues, including adult and neonatal bone, heart, brain, kidney, liver, lung, and spleen. Among these tissues, TRAP mRNA is most abundant in the liver, kidney, and bone (2Angel N.Z. Walsh N. Forwood M.R. Ostrowski M.C. Cassady A.I. Hume D.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 8Walsh N.C. Cahill M. Carninci P. Kawai J. Okazaki Y. Hayashizaki Y. Hume D.A. Cassady A.I.

Sites of transgene expression have included bone, liver, pancreas, spleen, lung, heart, brain, colon, brown fat, kidney, small intestine, and thymus (2Angel N.Z. Walsh N. Forwood M.R. Ostrowski M.C.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2835-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Recent study of murine TRAP gene expression suggests that there may be tissue-specific TRAP promoters (8Walsh N.C. Cahill M. Carninci P. Kawai J. Okazaki Y. Hayashizaki Y. Hume D.A. Cassady A.I. Gene. 2003; 307: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); as a result, it has been proposed that the TRAP gene has three alternative 5′-untranslated regions that align with the first base of exon 2 (Fig. 1). These have been designated exons 1A, 1B, and 1C (8Walsh N.C. Cahill M. Carninci P. Kawai J. Okazaki Y. Hayashizaki Y. Hume D.A. Cassady A.I. Gene. 2003; 307: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the promoter for exon 1B is responsible for basal level TRAP mRNA expression in macrophages and osteoclasts and is the major promoter utilized in nonhematopoietic cells. The exon 1C promoter is suspected to contribute to regulation of TRAP expression beyond basal expression in hematopoietic cells, such as macrophages and osteoclasts (8Walsh N.C. Cahill M. Carninci P. Kawai J. Okazaki Y. Hayashizaki Y. Hume D.A. Cassady A.I. Gene. 2003; 307: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The exon 1A promoter function is unknown, as 1A mRNA transcripts were detected in adult mouse bone but not in vitro or in neonatal bone. To improve understanding of transcriptional regulation of TRAP gene expression, we generated transgenic mice with distinct TRAP promoter regions fused to a reporter gene. Promoter regions consisted of the 2.2- or the 1.6-kb (relative to ATG) regions of the TRAP promoter region. The 2.2-kb region contained exons 1B and 1C, and the 1.6-kb region contained only exon 1C (Fig. 1). Transgenic lines derived from animals with the 2.2-kb promoter (BC mice) demonstrated robust tissue-restricted reporter gene expression, whereas transgenic lines derived from animals with the 1.6-kb promoter (C mice) failed to express significant gene expression. These findings provided novel insight into understanding transcriptional regulation of the TRAP gene by establishing that the 2.2-kb promoter is essential for gene expression in vivo, by determining that the 1.6-kb promoter region is not sufficient for gene expression in vivo, and by suggesting that expression of the bone- and spleen-preferred TRAP C transcript must depend on regulatory elements outside of the 2.2-kb TRAP promoter. Generation and Identification of Transgenic Mice—Two transgene constructs comprised of a portion of the murine TRAP promoter and a fusion gene containing a marker gene and a therapeutic gene were used to generate mice. A plasmid, LNGCDySN, containing the NGFR·CDy fusion gene was provided by Paul Orchard (11Lewis V.A. Basso L. Blake N. Salo J. Lund T.C. McIvor R.S. Orchard P.J. Hum. Gene Ther. 2003; 14: 1009-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The NGFR·CDy fusion gene contained the truncated human nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) gene and the yeast (y) gene encoding cytosine deaminase (CDy). The fusion gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using a sense oligonucleotide, Koz-NGFR-5′-HinDIII (AAGCTTCCACCATGGGGGCAGGTGCCA) and an antisense oligonucleotide, CDy-3′-HinDIII (AAGCTTCGATCACTCACCAATATCTTC) and cloned into pTRAP vector. The construct was designated BC-NGFR·CDy. pTRAP contains one promoter fragment (-1285 to -1 relative to ATG) and one 3′-poly(A) tail fragment (+2866 to +3385 relative to ATG) from mouse TRAP gene in pBluescriptSK. The second transgene, designated C-NGFR·CDy, was generated by deletion of a 620-bp fragment (-2160 to -1541 relative to ATG) from BC-NGFR·CDy. The BC-NGFR·CDy and C-NGFR·CDy transgenes were excised by removing pBluescriptSK, purified with a QiAquick gel extraction kit (catalogue number 28706; Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA), and purified DNA was diluted to 4 ng/μl in a TE buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Transgenic mice were produced by pronuclear microinjection of purified DNA into C3H/HeJ(F) × C57B1/6 (M) embryo eggs by the University of Minnesota Mouse Genetics Laboratory. Founder mice and offspring were identified by Southern blot. Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR—RNA was isolated and purified using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Expression levels of mRNA were determined using two-step qPCR, with SYBR green as a detection method. cDNA templates for PCR amplification were prepared using a Retroscript™ first strand synthesis kit for RT-PCR (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Random decamers were used to amplify 1.25 μg of total RNA according to the manufacturer's instructions in a reaction volume of 20 μl. 2 μl of this cDNA reaction volume were added to 23 μl of a PCR master mix for a final real-time quantitative reaction volume of 25 μl. The PCR master mix was prepared using Qiagen's Quantitect™ SYBR® green PCR kit (Qiagen). Four sets of primer pairs were used: NGFR·CDy-F3, CAGAACAAGACCTCATAGCC and NGFR·CDy-R1, GACATCCGCCAATAGGAACA (NGFR·CDy fusion gene); TRAP 1B-F, GCGCCGCCTCTTCCCAACTC and NGFR·CDy-R4, CGGAGAACGTCACGCTGTCCA (exon 1B transgene transcript); TRAP 1C-F, ACTGCCTCTTGCAGCCTCTC and NGFR·CDy-R3, ACTCGGTGCACGGCTTGCAC (exon 1C transgene transcript); and HPRT-F, GTAATGATCAGTCAACGGGGGAC and HPRT-R, CCAGCAAGCTTGCAACCTTAACCA (HPRT). HPRT was used for comparison and determination of relative ratio between samples. All primers used had a final concentration of 0.3 μm. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed using the ABI PRISM 7900 sequence detection system instrument and software (PE Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). Thermal cycling conditions were set according to the manufacturer's directions. Quantitated mRNA values were normalized by the amounts of HPRT mRNA, and results are given as -fold induction. Western Analysis—Transgenic mouse tissue (at least 100 mg) was homogenized in 0.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3PO4) containing protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). The homogenate was allowed to settle on ice for 20 min and then was centrifuged for 2 min at 14,000 × g in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. Supernatant was decanted and stored at -80 °C. 700 μg of cell lysate/lane was separated on a 10% reducing SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Polyclonal anti-cytosine deaminase (catalogue number 2485-4906; BIOTREND, Destin, FL) were applied at dilutions of 1:1000 and bovine anti-sheep-horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) at 1:3000. Cell Culture—To determine whether transgenic (TG) bone marrow expressed NGFR in vitro, replicate wells containing 4.5 × 104 TG or C3H/HeJ bone marrow cells, 20 ng/ml receptor activator of NFκB ligand (RANKL) (Amgen Corp., Thousand Oaks, CA), and 30 ng/ml macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) in 0.2 ml were cultured in 96-well plates. After 6 days, wells were stained for TRAP (Sigma) or NGFR immunocytochemistry. NGFR Immunocytochemistry—Monoclonal mouse anti-human NGFR (clone 20.4, provided by Dr. Paul Orchard) was diluted 1:500 and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. A biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (Rockland) was used as the secondary antibody (1:750 dilution, 30 min at 37 °C), and the tertiary reagent was horseradish peroxidase avidin-biotin complex (HRP-ABC; Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). In Vitro Cytotoxicity Assay—To assess the effect of 5-fluorocytosine (5FC) on osteoclastogenesis, TG or C3H/HeJ bone marrow cells (4.5 × 104/well), RANKL, and MCSF were cultured in 96-well plates with or without various doses of 5FC (0.05–1.0 mm). TRAP solution assay was performed on day 6 and enzyme activity read using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader at 405 nm (12Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Kelley M. Chang M-S.

Cytotoxicity was determined by calculation of percent osteoclasts, as measured against wells containing no drug. Immunohistochemistry—Paraffin-embedded sections were cut at 6 μm and mounted onto SuperfrostPlus™ slides as described previously (13Ramnaraine M. Pan W. Goblirsch M. Lynch C. Lewis V. Orchard P. Mantyh P. Clohisy D.R. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6847-6854PubMed Google Scholar). Statistics—Replicate wells were averaged for each drug dose, and data are presented as mean ± S.E. of three or four different animals. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Generation of Transgenic Lines—medTransgenic lines containing BC-NGFR·CDy or C-NGFR·CDy were generated by microinjection of either construct into fertilized C57BL/6 × C3H/HeJ F1 mouse embryos. The presence of the transgene was determined by Southern blot. Founder mice were mated with C3H/HeJ mice, and the transgene in offspring was determined by PCR. The four BC-NGFR·CDy mouse lines containing the B and C regions of the TRAP promoters were designated BC1–4, and the three C-NGFR·CDy mouse lines containing the C region of the TRAP promoter were designated C1–3. Southern blot analysis probing for the NGFR portion of each transgene demonstrated that the relative gene dosages in the BC-NGFR·CDy and C-NGFR·CDy transgenic lines spanned similar ranges. The estimated relative gene dosages for mice with the 2.2-kb promoter (BC) ranged from 1.0 to 3.7, and the estimated relative gene dosage for mice with the 1.6-kb promoter (C) ranged from 1.3 to 4.4 (Fig. 2). Southern probe targeting the B portion of the TRAP promoter detected endogenous TRAP gene in all lines, no gene in the C lines (as expected), and transgene in each of the BC lines (Fig. 2). The relative gene dose for BC lines based on Southern blots probed for the B region was qualitatively similar to gene dose estimates based on Southern blots probed for detection of NGFR. Comparison of Transgene Expression in BC and C Transgenic Mice—Transgene expression was higher in BC mice than in C mice. mRNA expression in kidney, liver, lung, spleen, bone, brain, and heart was determined in seven lines of mice. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR using primers for total NGFR·CDy mRNA revealed easily quantifiable expression of the transgene in each tissue examined from BC transgenic mice. Highest transgene expression was noted in liver and kidney (Fig. 3). Significant expression was seen in the lung, spleen, and bone. Minimal expression was present in the heart and brain. In contrast, transgene expression in C transgenic mice was not detectable in liver, kidney, spleen, lung, bone, and heart and was minimally detectable in brain. Evaluation of endogenous TRAP mRNA transcript expression in the transgenic mice revealed expected findings and confirmed a previous report describing transcript distribution (8Walsh N.C. Cahill M. Carninci P. Kawai J. Okazaki Y. Hayashizaki Y. Hume D.A. Cassady A.I. Gene. 2003; 307: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Total Transgene Transcript Expression in BC Mice—A general pattern of gene expression was noted in each of the four BC transgenic lines. Highest expression was detected in kidney and liver; lower expression was noted in lung, bone, and spleen (Fig. 3). Specifically, in three of the four BC lines, transgene expression was greatest in the kidney. In one line, expression was greatest in the liver. In all four BC lines, expression in the liver and kidney ranged from 10 to several hundred times greater than expression in lung, spleen, or bone. Exon 1B and Exon 1C Transcript Expression in BC Mice—To determine relative transcript expression in the BC transgenic mice, quantitative real time PCR for the exon 1B or 1C transcripts was performed. Findings indicate that the exon 1B transcripts were the dominant transcript in each BC line. Measurements of exon 1B transcript expression in each of the four BC lines provided data mirroring findings from detection of the NGFR transcript (Fig. 4, A and B). Between mice in each BC line, kidney and liver had the highest levels of expression. Expression levels ranged from 10- to several hundred-fold higher than spleen, lung, or bone in each animal. Evaluation of exon 1C transcript levels revealed minimal expression in all tissues and did not show evidence of tissue-specific transcript expression (Fig. 4C). Detection of NGFR·CDy Fusion Protein in Transgenic Mice— Western blot analysis of CDy protein demonstrated protein in the liver, kidney, and bone of BC mice (Fig. 5A). Western blot analysis did not detect protein in any tissue from C mice (data not shown). The NGFR·CDy fusion protein is commonly detected as two bands (13Ramnaraine M. Pan W. Goblirsch M. Lynch C. Lewis V. Orchard P. Mantyh P. Clohisy D.R. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6847-6854PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, kidney and bone displayed a single 63-kDa band, compared with liver which displayed 67 and 63-kDa bands, suggesting that there is tissue-specific post-translational modification of the NGFR·CDy fusion protein. Immunohistochemical detection of NGFR localized protein to the cell membrane of hepatocytes and renal tubular cells (Fig. 5, B–E) in BC, but not in C, mice. Evaluation of Transgene Expression in Vitro—Under osteoclastogenic conditions in vitro, cells from BC and C transgenics had increased expression of the endogenous TRAP gene, but only cells from BC mice exhibited increased expression of the NGFR·CD transgene. To induce osteoclast or macrophage differentiation, bone marrow cells from BC or C mice were cultured in the presence of MCSF and RANKL or MCSF alone, respectively. Endogenous TRAP expression increased in osteoclastogenic, but not macrophage, cultures containing cells from BC or C mice (Fig. 6A). In culture systems from BC mice, transgene expression increased significantly upon exposure to MCSF alone (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, in culture systems from C mice, transgene induction was not observed under either osteoclastogenic or macrophage differentiation conditions (Fig. 6B). To further characterize the effect of RANKL and MCSF treatment on TRAP and transgene expression in vitro, detection of the B and C transcripts was performed in normal and BC cells. Findings revealed that the endogenous exon 1B and exon 1C TRAP transcripts were induced following RANKL and MCSF treatment (Fig. 6, C and D). Likewise, expression of the transgenic exon 1B and 1C transcripts was also induced under osteoclastogenic conditions (Fig. 6, E and F). Detection of Transgenic Fusion Protein in Vitro—Findings from histochemical and immunohistochemical evaluation of osteoclastogenic culture systems were consistent with data from evaluation of gene expression. TRAP enzyme detection demonstrated that osteoclasts formed in culture (Fig. 7, B and D). Immunohistochemical detection of the NGFR portion of the NGFR·CDy fusion protein demonstrated the presence of the fusion protein in osteoclastogenic culture systems derived from BC mice but, as expected, not from C3H control mice (Fig. 7, A and C). Detection of the CDy portion of the NGFR·CDy fusion protein was performed using an assay based on cytosine deaminase enzyme activity. As CDy converts metabolically inert 5-fluorocytosine to the cytotoxic agent 5-fluorouracil, exposure of CDy-expressing osteoclastogenic cell culture systems to 5FC should result in a reduction in osteoclast number (13Ramnaraine M. Pan W. Goblirsch M. Lynch C. Lewis V. Orchard P. Mantyh P. Clohisy D.R. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6847-6854PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of osteoclastogenic culture systems from nontransgenic mice had no effect on osteoclast number. In contrast, treatment of osteoclastogenic culture systems derived from BC mice with 5FC resulted in reduction in the number of osteoclasts (Fig. 7E). 5FC doses as low as 0.05 mm eliminated 60% of the osteoclasts in BC culture systems, and the maximal effect was seen with doses at or above 0.1 mm 5FC. The primary objective of this investigation was to compare transgene expression in transgenic mice with a reporter gene (NGFR·CDy) regulated by either the 2.2- (BC) or the 1.6-kb (C) portion of the TRAP promoter. Findings demonstrated that transgene expression was robust in mice with the BC promoter and that transgene expression was essentially absent in mice with the C promoter. Immunohistochemistry of liver and kidney detected NGFR in BC, but not C, mice. In vitro osteoclastogenic conditions stimulated significant transgene expression in marrow cells from BC, but not C, mice and immunohistochemical detection of NGFR-positive osteoclasts. Our analysis of gene expression driven by the 2.2- and 1.6-kb regions of the TRAP promoter indicated robust expression from the BC promoter and nil expression from the C promoter in vivo. This finding was unexpected, as a previous analysis of TRAP mRNA from various mouse tissues provided evidence that the C region of the TRAP promoter may be sufficient for substantial gene expression (8Walsh N.C. Cahill M. Carninci P. Kawai J. Okazaki Y. Hayashizaki Y. Hume D.A. Cassady A.I. Gene. 2003; 307: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Low expression of the transgene in our C mice could not be explained by relative transgene copy dose, as estimates of transgene copy dosage range were similar in the BC and C mice. The dominant transgenic transcript in BC mice was the B transcript, with C transcripts being barely detectable. This finding was particularly interesting because analysis of endogenous TRAP mRNA transcripts in the transgenic mice indicated that endogenous C transcripts were abundant in bone and spleen, as has previously been reported (8Walsh N.C. Cahill M. Carninci P. Kawai J. Okazaki Y. Hayashizaki Y. Hume D.A. Cassady A.I. Gene. 2003; 307: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Based on previous determination of the relative abundance of distinct TRAP mRNA transcripts and our current analysis of endogenous TRAP transcript expression, we expected to observe that tissue- or cell type-specific transcripts would be present in hemopoietic (bone, spleen) versus nonhematopoietic (kidney, liver) tissues (8Walsh N.C. Cahill M. Carninci P. Kawai J. Okazaki Y. Hayashizaki Y. Hume D.A. Cassady A.I. Gene. 2003; 307: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast, we determined that transcripts derived from the 2.2-kb promoter region showed near complete fidelity to exon 1B. Taken in total, our in vivo finding of limited exon 1C transcript levels suggested that the most 5′-portion of the TRAP gene containing -6.5 to -2.2-kb (relative to ATG) may be required for generation of the exon 1C transcript. Several transcription factors involved in osteoclast formation and activity have been shown to interact with the TRAP promoter. These include MITF, Pip, PU.1, USF1, USF2, TFE3, and TFEC (14Mansky K.C. Sulzbacher S. Purdom G. Nelsen L. Hume D.A. Rehli M. Ostrowski M.C. J.

Each of these DNA binding proteins has been studied in in vitro TRAP promoter-reporter experimental systems, and transcription factor binding sites have been localized to the 3′-end of the TRAP promoter within the C region. As our findings demonstrated that the C region of the TRAP promoter alone is not sufficient for transgene expression, further investigation is warranted to decipher the transcription factor binding sites within the B region that permit vigorous TRAP gene expression in vivo. It is becoming increasingly clear that a complex set of regulatory mechanisms controls TRAP gene expression and transcriptional events in TRAP-expressing cells (8Walsh N.C. Cahill M. Carninci P. Kawai J. Okazaki Y. Hayashizaki Y. Hume D.A. Cassady A.I. Gene. 2003; 307: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This work has improved our understanding of TRAP gene regulation in osteoclasts by demonstrating that the 1.6-kb promoter region is not sufficient for expression of the TRAP gene in vivo and in vitro and by showing that the exon 1B transcript is the predominant TRAP mRNA in transgenic mice with the 2.2-kb TRAP promoter. As the great majority of currently studied transcription factors that influence TRAP gene expression bind within the 1.6-kb C region of the TRAP promoter, our findings strongly suggested that transcription factor binding sites upstream of the C region will also have profound effects on regulation of the TRAP gene."

Functionally, ACBP can act as an acyl-CoA carrier or as an acyl-CoA pool maker within the cell. Much work on the biochemical properties regarding the ACBP has been performed using various vertebrate and plant tissues, as well as different types of cells in culture, the regulatory mechanisms underlying ACBP gene expression have remained poorly understood. By exploiting the unique sex pheromone production system in the moth pheromone gland (PG), we report that transcription of a specific ACBP termed pheromone gland ACBP is triggered by a hemolymph-based humoral factor. Following purification and structure elucidation by means of high resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and NMR analyses, in conjunction with stereochemical analyses using acid hydrolysates, the humoral factor was identified to be β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine. Examination of the hemolymph titers during development revealed that the amount of β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine dramatically rose prior to eclosion and reached a maximum of 5 mg/ml (about 1 mg/pupa) on the day preceding eclosion, which was consistent with the effective dose of β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine in stimulating pheromone gland ACBP transcription in vivo. Furthermore, in vitro assays using trimmed PG indicated that β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine acts directly on the PG.

Knudsen J. Poulsen F.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 150-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although the in vivo function of this protein has yet to be clarified in detail, in vitro investigations have revealed that ACBP protects acyl-CoA esters from hydrolysis (2Mogensen I.B. Schulenberg H. Hansen H.O. Spener F. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 3Rasmussen J.T. Rosendal J. Knudsen J. Biochem.

Biophys. 1998; 350: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). ACBP can also generate an intracellular acyl-CoA pool that can serve a number of biochemical purposes (9Kragelund B.B.

Andersen J.S. Højrup P. Roepstorff P. Kristiansen K. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), because overexpression of ACBP in yeast cells results in a substantial increase in cellular acyl-CoA content (11Mandrup S. Jepsen R. Skøtt H. Rosendal J. Højrup P. Kristiansen K. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In mammals, whereas the ACBP gene is a typical housekeeping gene (12Mandrup S. Hummel R. Ravn S. Jensen G. Andreasen P.H. Gregersen N. Knudsen J. Kristiansen K. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), its expression differs markedly among different cell types; a high level of ACBP expression occurs in hepatocytes, steroidogenic cells, and adipocytes (reviewed in Ref. 13Knudesen J. Mandrup S. Rasmussen J.T. Andreasen P.H. Poulsen F. Kristiansen K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 123: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The expression of ACBP is partly correlated with increased lipogenesis and occurs, for instance, in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes during in vitro differentiation, a process that is accompanied by a marked accumulation of triacylglycerol (TG) and de novo fatty acid synthesis (14Swinnen J.V. Vercaeren I. Esquenet M. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 118: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 15Hansen H.O. Andreasen P.H. Mandrup S. Kristiansen K. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanisms regulating ACBP expression have remained largely unknown, two functional regulatory elements, a sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-binding site and a nuclear factor Y (NFY)-binding site, have been identified in the proximal promoter of the human ACBP gene (16Swinnen J.V. Alen P. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19938-19944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Recently, it has also been demonstrated that ACBP is a novel peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) target gene and that the PPAR-response element in intron 1 of the rat ACBP gene is a bona fide PPAR-response element (17Helledie T. Grøntved L. Jensen S.S. Kiilerich P. Rietveld L. Albrektsen T. Boysen M.S. Nøhr J. Larsen L.K. Fleckner J. Stunnenberg H.G. Kristiansen K. Mandrup S. J. Biol.

In insects, many species of female moths produce species-specific sex pheromones to attract conspecific male moths. Their pheromone components are generally synthesized de novo through long-chain fatty acyl intermediates in the abdominal pheromone gland (PG), a functionally differentiated organ responsible for sex pheromone production. In the course of examining the molecular mechanisms underlying sex pheromone production in the silkmoth, Bombyx mori, we found that two distinct ACBPs termed pheromone gland ACBP (pgACBP) and midgut ACBP (mgACBP) are specifically expressed in the PG cells during pheromonogenesis (18Matsumoto S. Yoshiga T. Yokoyama N. Iwanaga M. Koshiba S. Kigawa T. Hirota H. Yokoyama S. Okano K. Mita K. Shimada T. Tatsuki S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Northern blot analyses using various tissues also revealed that mgACBP, but not pgACBP, is highly expressed in the midgut during larval feeding stages, suggesting that there are at least two distinct ACBPs with different physiological functions in the moth and that both ACBPs simultaneously participate in sex pheromone production (18Matsumoto S. Yoshiga T. Yokoyama N. Iwanaga M. Koshiba S. Kigawa T. Hirota H. Yokoyama S. Okano K. Mita K. Shimada T. Tatsuki S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In B. mori, the PG cells accumulate a large number of lipid droplets within the cytoplasm just before eclosion (19Fónagy A. Yokoyama N. Okano K. Tatsuki S. Maeda S. Matsumoto S. J. Insect Physiol. 2000; 46: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The lipid droplets contain TGs composed of unsaturated C16 and C18 fatty acids in addition to the pheromone (bombykol, (E,Z)-10,12-hexadecadien-1-ol) precursor, Δ10,12-hexadecadienoic acid, which is present as a major component. These droplets play a significant role in storing the bombykol precursor and eventually releasing it for pheromone production at eclosion in response to the neurohormone designated as pheromone biosynthesis-activating neuropeptide (PBAN) (19Fónagy A. Yokoyama N. Okano K. Tatsuki S. Maeda S. Matsumoto S. J. Insect Physiol. 2000; 46: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Fónagy A. Yokoyama N. Matsumoto S. Arthropod Struct.

Biol. 2002; 32: 1447-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because the PG cells must retain large amounts of pheromone precursors during pheromonogenesis, one of the functions of the ACBPs expressed in the PG seems to be to donate acyl-CoAs for the synthesis of the TGs in the lipid droplets. Apart from these findings, we found that both of the ACBPs are expressed simultaneously in the PG and are up-regulated on the day preceding eclosion (18Matsumoto S. Yoshiga T. Yokoyama N. Iwanaga M. Koshiba S. Kigawa T. Hirota H. Yokoyama S. Okano K. Mita K. Shimada T. Tatsuki S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that there might be some kinds of physiological cues that trigger transcription and thus regulate the expression of the ACBPs in the PG. In this report, we describe the presence, isolation, and characterization of a humoral factor that appears in the hemolymph just before eclosion and that stimulates pgACBP transcription. Present results provide the first evidence that transcription of some ACBPs can be triggered by specific humoral factors. Insects—B. mori eggs (Shuko × Ryuhaku) were purchased from Katakura Kogyo (Matsumoto, Japan), and larvae were raised on an artificial diet as described (22Fónagy A. Matsumoto S. Uchiumi K. Orikasa C. Mitsui T. J. Pestic. Sci. 1992; 17: 47-54Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Bioassays were performed using 5–10 female pupae 3 days before eclosion (day –3). Pupal age was determined based on the morphological characteristics as described (21Matsumoto S. Fónagy A. Yamamoto M. Wang F. Yokoyama N. Esumi Y. Suzuki Y. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 1447-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Chemicals—Para-amidinophenyl-methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (p-APMSF) was purchased from WAKO chemicals (Osaka). 2,3,4,6-Tetra-O-benzyl-d-glucopyranose was purchased from Sigma. Other chemicals used were of the highest grade commercially available. Plasma Preparation—B. mori hemolymph was collected into a chilled microcentrifuge tube containing 0.05% phenylthiourea and 0.5 mm p-APMSF in 0.2 m phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) using the “flushing out” method by injecting 0.1 m phosphate buffer containing 150 mm KCl and 10 mm EDTA (pH 6.0) into the hemocoel (23Hayakawa Y. Jahagirder A.P. Yaguchi M. Downer R.G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16165-16169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For purification, the hemolymph collected from female pupae (day –1) was immediately centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 500 × g to remove hemocytes, and the resulting supernatant (plasma) was mixed with an equal volume of –20°C acetone. Following centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 20,000 × g, the supernatant was passed through an Amicon Ultra PL-5 membrane (Millipore). The pass-through fraction was concentrated with the SpeedVac System (Thermo Savant) and designated as the plasma fraction. Bioassay in Conjunction with RT-PCR—To examine the activity that stimulates transcription of pgACBP, test samples were diluted to 10 μl with phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.5 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.2)) and injected into 5–10 female pupae (day –3). After maintaining for 18 h at 25 °C, the injected pupae were dissected, and their abdominal tips were excised into insect Ringer's solution (35 mm NaCl, 36 mm KCl, 12 mm CaCl2, 16mm MgCl2, 274 mm glucose, and 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)) for preparation of trimmed PGs (24Ozawa R. Matsumoto S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For RT-PCR, total RNA was prepared from trimmed PGs by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA (500 ng) by using the RNA PCR kit (Takara Bio Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Specific oligonucleotide primer pairs (for pgACBP, pgACBP-F1 sense primer (5′-ATCAATATGTCTCTCCAAGAAAAA-3′) and pgACBP-R1 antisense primer (5′-CTTTTATTCTTTGAGGCCGATGGA-3′); for mgACBP, mgACBP-F1 sense primer (5′-CACAAAATGTCTCTCGACGAGCAA-3′) and mgACBP-R1 antisense primer (5′-AATTTATGCGTATTTGGAGTGGAG-3′)) were designed based on their published sequences. PCR conditions consisted of 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Following PCR, 5-μl aliquots were run on a 1.2% agarose gel in TAE buffer. Isolation Procedures—The plasma fraction prepared from 500 female pupae (day –1) was loaded onto a TSK-GEL Amide-80 column (4.6 × 250 mm; Tosoh Co.) and eluted isocratically with 70% CH3CN at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The bioactive fraction that eluted at 12–13 min was then loaded onto a CAPCELL PAK C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm; pore size, 5 μm; Shiseido Co.) and eluted with 5% CH3CN in 0.1% CF3COOH/H2O at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Mass Spectrometry—High resolution electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (HR-ESIMS) was carried out in the positive ion mode using a JEOL JMS-T100LC spectrometer with methanol as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min (internal standard: sodium trifluoroacetate). The purified humoral factor and synthetic β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine were dissolved in water at a concentration of 1 μg/ml, and 10-μl aliquots were subjected to analysis. NMR Analysis—The one-dimensional 1H at 600 MHz and 13C NMR spectra at 150 MHz, and two-dimensional DQF-COSY, HMQC, and HMBC NMR spectra at 25 °C were recorded with a JEOL JNM-ECA600 spectrometer equipped with a Nalorac 3-mm gradient inverse double resonance probe head. The purified humoral factor (100 μg) (as a trifluoroacetate salt) was dissolved in 350 μl of D2O with 0.75% 3-(trimethylsilyl) propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid, sodium salt as the internal reference. 1H NMR (600 MHz, D2O): δ 4.06 (dd, J = 8.1, 5.5 Hz, H-2), 3.26 (dd, J = 15.1, 5.5, H-3a), 3.12 (dd, J = 15.1, 8.1, H-3b), 7.28 (d, J = 8.6, H-5,9), 7.12 (d, J = 8.6, H-6,8), 5.12 (d, J = 7.6, H-1′), 3.56 (dd, J = 9.6, 7.6 Hz, H-2′), 3.61 (dd, J = 9.6, 9.6 Hz, H-3′), 3.49 (dd, J = 9.6, 9.6, H-4′), 3.63 (ddd, J = 9.6, 5.6, 2.5 Hz, H-5′), 3.92 (dd, J = 12.6, 2.4 Hz, H-6a′), 3.75 (dd, J = 12.6, 5.6 Hz, H-6b′). 13C NMR (150 MHz, D2O): δ 176.1 (C-1), 58.4 (C-2), 38.3 (C-3), 132.4 (C-4), 133.8 (C-5,9), 120.0 (C-6,8), 159.0 (C-7), 103.1 (C-1′), 75.9 (C-2′), 78.5 (C-3′), 72.4 (C-4′), 79.0 (C-5′), 63.5 (C-6′). Hydrolysis and Stereochemistry Analysis—The purified humoral factor (100 μg) was hydrolyzed in a vacuum-sealed tube with 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 20 h. dl-Amino acid analysis of the resulting hydrolysates was carried out according to Hayashi and Sasagawa (26Hayashi T. Sasagawa T. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The purified humoral factor (1 mg) was also hydrolyzed with 1 n HCl at 100 °C for 12 h. The resulting hydrolysates were loaded onto a TSK-GEL Amide-80 column and eluted with 70% CH3CN at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The glucose fraction, which eluted at 7–8 min, was evaporated, redissolved in 1.5 ml of water, and then subjected to measurement of its optical rotation with a polarimeter DIP-370 (Jasco, Japan) at a wavelength of 589 nm in a cell with a path length of 10 cm at a precision of 0.001°. Synthesis of β-d-Glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine—An authentic sample of β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine was synthesized from 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-benzyl-d-glucopyranose via stereoselective glycosidation of the corresponding O-glycosylpseudourea (27Horvat S. Varga L. Horvat J. Synthesis. 1986; 1986: 209-211Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) with N-benzyloxycarbonyl-l-tyrosine benzyl ester followed by hydrogenation (H2, 10% Pd/C). N-benzyloxycarbonyl-l-tyrosine benzyl ester was prepared according to Tilak (28Tilak M.A. Tetrahedron Lett. 1968; 9: 6323-6326Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In Vitro Assay—Trimmed PGs were placed in individual wells of a 48-well plate and incubated in the presence or absence of β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine at 25 °C in 200 μl of insect Ringer's solution. After incubation, five trimmed PGs were combined and homogenized on ice in 100 μl of0.2 m phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 0.05% phenylthiourea and 0.5 mm p-APMSF with a glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was further centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 60 min to prepare the cytosolic fraction, which was then used to quantify the amount of β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine present by means of HPLC using a TSK-GEL Amide-80 column as described above. The pgACBP transcript levels following incubation were also measured by RT-PCR as described above. Fluctuation of the β-d-Glucosyl-O-l-Tyrosine Content in the Hemolymph—To measure the fluctuation of the β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine titers in the hemolymph, plasma fractions were prepared daily from fifth instar larvae, and the amount of β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine was quantified by means of HPLC using a TSK-GEL Amide-80 column as described above. β-d-Glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine measurements were performed every 12 h from sample sets that spanned day –4 pupae to day 1 adults. Measurement of the Total Volume of the Hemolymph in the Pupae— Aliquots (10 μl) of Evans Blue (WAKO chemicals) solution (5 mg/ml) were injected into 10 female pupae. After maintaining for 15 min at 25 °C, the hemolymph (20 μl each) was collected into a chilled microcentrifuge tube and diluted 50-fold with H2O, and the absorbance at 610 nm was measured. Presence of a Humoral Factor That Triggers pgACBP Transcription in the PG—In our previous paper, Northern blot analyses revealed that the pgACBP transcript is specific to the PG, where it undergoes significant up-regulation 1 day prior to adult emergence (18Matsumoto S. Yoshiga T. Yokoyama N. Iwanaga M. Koshiba S. Kigawa T. Hirota H. Yokoyama S. Okano K. Mita K. Shimada T. Tatsuki S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This up-regulation within the PG was again confirmed in the present RT-PCR analyses using PGs prepared 3 days and 1 day before eclosion (day –3 and day –1) (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). To examine whether humoral factor(s) present in the hemolymph could stimulate pgACBP transcription, we injected various B. mori plasma samples into day –3 female pupae (Fig. 1A, lanes 3–8). The results indicated that injection of the female plasma taken 1 day prior to eclosion (lane 6) or immediately after eclosion (lane 7) caused a marked increase of the pgACBP transcript at 18 h postinjection. Although this activity in the plasma seemed to gradually increase during pupal development (lanes 4–6), no activity was detected in the plasma taken from either fifth instar larvae or female moths 1 day after eclosion (lanes 3 and 8). Since pgACBP transcripts were detectable as early as 12 h postinjection (Fig. 1B), we elected to monitor the progress of our purification of the plasma humoral factor by assaying pgACBP transcript levels 12 h after injection of the test samples. Isolation of the Humoral Factor in the Female Pupal Hemolymph—Preliminary experiments revealed that the humoral factor in the pupal plasma (day –1) could be recovered in the fraction that not only failed to be precipitated with 50% acetone but that also passed through an Amicon Ultra PL-5 membrane (Millipore), suggesting that the humoral factor was a low molecular weight substance. For purification, we prepared this plasma fraction, which was equivalent to 500 female pupae (day –1), and performed isocratic HPLC separation using a TSK-GEL Amide-80 column (Fig. 2A). The bioactive fraction that eluted from the column at 12–13 min was further purified using a C18 column with the activity recoverable in a single peak that eluted at 5.5 min (Fig. 2B). Structure Elucidation of the Humoral Factor—HR-ESIMS spectral analysis of the purified factor resulted in molecular ions of m/z 366.10 ([M + Na]+), 382.08 ([M + K]+), and 388.09 ([M + 2Na]+), indicating a molecular formula of C15H21NO8. The UV spectrum in H2O showed absorption maxima at 271 and 276 nm. The one-dimensional 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the purified humoral factor showed the presence of a β-glucosyl unit and a tyrosine-like amino acid unit (Fig. 3), results that were supported by two-dimensional DQF-COSY, HMQC, and HMBC NMR experiments (data not shown). Low field chemical shifts of an anomeric proton at 5.12 (d, 7.6 Hz) ppm suggested that the phenolic hydroxyl group of the tyrosine unit was glucosylated. This glucosylation was confirmed by a long range correlation between the anomeric proton and a quaternary carbon at 159.0 ppm. These results indicate that the purified factor is β-glucosyl-O-tyrosine. Further analyses, both amino acid analysis and acid hydrolysis, of the purified factor indicated that the factor is composed of l-tyrosine and d-glucose ([α]589 = +46.7 (c = 0.35, H2O)). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the humoral factor in the plasma is β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine. Biological Activity of Synthetic β-d-Glucosyl-O-l-Tyrosine—To confirm the biological activity of β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine, we synthesized β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine and examined its ability to stimulate transcription of the ACBPs in the PG. When we injected various concentrations of synthetic β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine into day –3 female pupae, the levels of pgACBP mRNA increased in a dose-dependent manner; the transcript was detected at doses of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/pupa (Fig. 4A). These biological activities are consistent with those of the purified humoral factor (data not shown). At these concentrations, more than 1.0 mg/pupa seemed to be required to obtain the comparable level of pgACBP transcript of the untreated day –1 pupa (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Because injection of l-tyrosine and/or d-glucose alone failed to elicit a transcriptional response, even at concentrations of 2.0 mg/pupa, the covalent bond between l-tyrosine and d-glucose is indispensable for biological activity (data not shown). In contrast to the elevation of the pgACBP transcript levels, β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine essentially had no effect on the transcription of mgACBP (Fig. 4B). To examine whether β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine acts directly on the PG cells to stimulate pgACBP transcription, we prepared trimmed PGs from female pupae (day –3) and incubated each PG for 12 h in the presence of β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine at concentrations ranging from 0–5 mg/ml. Similar to the in vivo assays described above, RT-PCR revealed that the levels of pgACBP mRNA in the trimmed PG increased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). These results demonstrate that the humoral factor β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine acts directly on the PG to stimulate pgACBP transcription. In addition, the titer of β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine within the cytosolic fraction of PGs increased proportionately with the concentration of β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine used in the incubations (Fig. 5B). At a concentration of 5.0 mg/ml, the titer in the cytosolic fraction reached a maximum (0.6 μg/PG) at 6 h (Fig. 5B), whereas the pgACBP transcript appeared at 12 h (Fig. 5C). Fluctuation of Hemolymph β-d-Glucosyl-O-l-Tyrosine Titers during Development—The in vivo and in vitro assays described above revealed that β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine in the hemolymph could act on the PG to stimulate pgACBP transcription; however, it required at least 0.5 mg/pupa to exert this activity. To determine whether this concentration of β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine reflects the physiological state and correlates with the hemolymph titer during pheromonogensis, we examined the fluctuation of β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine titers in the hemolymph during development (i.e. from the larval fifth instar to the adult stage) (Fig. 6). Although there was no significant difference in the patterns between female and male, two prominent peaks in the β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine titer appeared during the molting stages; the smaller of the two surges occurred at the larval-pupal molt and reached a maximum level (1 mg/ml) on the day of pupation, whereas the larger pulse occurred during the pupal-adult molt. This second surge began 3–4 days prior to eclosion, reached a maximum of as much as 5 mg/ml at 1 day before eclosion, and then rapidly declined to the lowest level (0.2 mg/ml) within 2 days of emergence. When we measured the total volume of the hemolymph in female pupae (Table I), it was estimated that a single female pupa (day –2) contains, on average, ∼190 μl of hemolymph. This estimation implies that the effective dose of β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine (more than 0.5 mg/pupa) is comparable with the β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine titers around 1 day before eclosion (0.95 mg/pupa). These results therefore indicate that the upsurge of β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine in the hemolymph just before eclosion is indeed responsible for the up-regulation in pgACBP transcription during pheromonogenesis.Table IThe total volume of B. mori pupal hemolymph (mean ± S.D.)Hemolymph volumeaPupae of 1.45-1.55 g were used for measurement.μlDay -3194.6 ± 16.97Day -2194.2 ± 18.38Day -1193.4 ± 11.31a Pupae of 1.45-1.55 g were used for measurement. Open table in a new tab ACBP is a highly conserved 10-kDa N-acetylated polypeptide that is expressed in a wide variety of species ranging from yeast to mammals (29Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Because ACBP binds straight-chain (C14–C22) acyl-CoA esters with high affinity and thereby protects them from hydrolysis (2Mogensen I.B. Schulenberg H. Hansen H.O. Spener F. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 3Rasmussen J.T. Rosendal J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 4Rasmussen J.T. Faergeman N.J. Kristiansen K. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), functionally, ACBP can act as an acyl-CoA carrier or an acyl-CoA pool maker within the cell to increase total cellular acyl-CoA content (9Kragelund B.B.

Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we have demonstrated that two distinct ACBPs are specifically expressed in the PG during pheromonogenesis and undergo up-regulation on the day prior to eclosion in the female B. mori moth (18Matsumoto S. Yoshiga T. Yokoyama N. Iwanaga M. Koshiba S. Kigawa T. Hirota H. Yokoyama S. Okano K. Mita K. Shimada T. Tatsuki S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the PGs of many moth species, various long chain fatty acyl-CoAs participate as precursors or intermediates in the biosynthesis of species-specific sex pheromones (30Tillman J.A. Seyvold S.J. Jurenka R.A. Blomquist G.J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 481-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), suggesting that ACBPs expressed in the PG could possibly function as carriers or cellular deposits for the acyl-CoAs utilized in pheromone biosynthesis. Whereas numerous studies regarding the biochemical properties of the ACBP have been performed using various vertebrate and plant tissues as well as different types of cells in culture, the regulatory mechanisms underlying ACBP gene expression have remained poorly understood; only the involvement of transcription factors such as SREBP and PPARγ has been reported (16Swinnen J.V. Alen P. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19938-19944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 17Helledie T. Grøntved L. Jensen S.S. Kiilerich P. Rietveld L. Albrektsen T. Boysen M.S. Nøhr J. Larsen L.K. Fleckner J. Stunnenberg H.G. Kristiansen K. Mandrup S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26821-26830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the present study, by exploiting the unique sex pheromone production system in the moth PG, we have provided the first evidence that transcription of a specific ACBP is triggered by a hemolymph-based humoral factor. To initiate the present experiments, we hypothesized that there would be a specific physiological cue that triggered ACBP transcription within the PG cells 1 day prior to eclosion. Because insects contain an open circulatory system, the PG is continuously exposed to the hemolymph; consequently, we examined whether the hemolymph 1 day prior to eclosion could stimulate pgACBP transcription and found that a transcriptional activator was indeed present (Fig. 1A). Following purification and structure elucidation by means of HR-ESIMS and NMR analyses, in conjunction with stereochemical analyses using hydrolysates, the active factor in the hemolymph was identified as β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine (Figs. 2 and 3). The validity of the structural determination was confirmed by comparing the purified factor with synthetic β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine. The in vivo assays using day –3 pupae revealed that β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine does stimulate pgACBP transcription but that it requires as much as 1.0 mg/pupa to obtain transcript levels comparable with that observed in the PGs of untreated day –1 pupa (Fig. 4). Quite interestingly, we found that the β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine titer in the hemolymph dramatically rises prior to eclosion and reaches a maximum of 5 mg/ml (about 1 mg/pupa) on the day preceding eclosion (Fig. 6). This relationship between the effective dose of β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine and its upsurge in the hemolymph just before eclosion is consistent with its proposed role in the up-regulation of pgACBP during pheromonogenesis. Furthermore, the in vitro assays using trimmed PG (Fig. 5) indicate that β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine acts directly on the PG to stimulate pgACBP transcription, although the molecular mechanism behind how the β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine signal stimulates the transcription of pgACBP within the PG cells remains to be clarified. In mammals, two functional regulatory elements, a SREBP-binding site and an NFY-binding site, have been identified in the proximal promoter of the human ACBP gene (16Swinnen J.V. Alen P. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19938-19944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that the ACBP gene is a novel PPARγ:retinoid X receptor target gene and that PPARγ:retinoid X receptor activates transcription through an intronic PPAR-response element in both human and rodent ACBP (17Helledie T. Grøntved L. Jensen S.S. Kiilerich P. Rietveld L. Albrektsen T. Boysen M.S. Nøhr J. Larsen L.K. Fleckner J. Stunnenberg H.G. Kristiansen K. Mandrup S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26821-26830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the present experiments, we found that there is a time lag of several hours between the incorporation of β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine into the PG cells and the appearance of the pgACBP transcript (Fig. 5, B and C). This finding suggests that transcription of pgACBP does not result from a direct interaction with β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine itself. We also found that the titer of β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine in the hemolymph rapidly declines following adult emergence (Fig. 6), whereas we had previously reported that the pgACBP transcript level remained high for several days after eclosion (18Matsumoto S. Yoshiga T. Yokoyama N. Iwanaga M. Koshiba S. Kigawa T. Hirota H. Yokoyama S. Okano K. Mita K. Shimada T. Tatsuki S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These results suggest that β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine stimulates pgACBP transcription through a signal transduction cascade that probably includes some as yet unidentified transcription factor similar to SREBP, NFY, and/or PPARγ. The presence of β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine in the hemolymph has been reported in several insects (31Chen P.S. Mitchell H.K. Neuweg M. Insect Biochem. 1978; 8: 276-286Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 32Isobe M. Kondo M. Imai K. Yamashita O. Goto T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1981; 45: 687-692Google Scholar, 33Ahmed R.F. Hopkins T.L. Kramer K.J. Insect Biochem. 1983; 13: 369-374Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 34Psarianos C.G. Marmaras V.J. Vournakis J.N. Insect Biochem. 1985; 15: 129-135Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been demonstrated in the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, that β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine is synthesized in the fat body by the action of a specific β-glucosyltransferase present there (35Ahmad S.A. Hopkins T.L. Kramer K.J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 49-57Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In M. sexta, the regulation of β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine synthesis and hydrolysis is under the control of hormones that regulate molting and metamorphosis; the decline in juvenile hormone titer after the last larval ecdysis initiates β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine synthesis (36Ahmed R.F. Hopkins T.L. Kramer K.J. J. Insect Physiol. 1985; 36: 341-345Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), whereas the major pulse of 20-hydroxyecdysone triggers hydrolysis of β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine by a β-glucosidase in the fat body (33Ahmed R.F. Hopkins T.L. Kramer K.J. Insect Biochem. 1983; 13: 369-374Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In insects, l-tyrosine is an important precursor for the diphenols and quinones that cross-link cuticular proteins during tanning or sclerotization, the process of which results in the hardening and pigmentation of the new cuticle following the molt (33Ahmed R.F. Hopkins T.L. Kramer K.J. Insect Biochem. 1983; 13: 369-374Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Consequently, the function of β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine has long been suggested to serve as a reservoir of l-tyrosine for the eventual incorporation into the newly formed cuticle following the molt and/or metamorphosis. This idea seems to be consistent with the present finding that an increase in the β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine titer occurs, regardless of sex, at the time of pupation and eclosion (Fig. 6). Alternatively, since we have unequivocally demonstrated that β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine triggers pgACBP transcription during pupal-adult metamorphosis in the female moth, our present results also suggest a multifunctional role for β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine. We found that β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine essentially failed to stimulate mgACBP transcription (Fig. 4B). Since we have detected mgACBP transcriptional activation capabilities in a hemolymph fraction other than the β-d-glucosyl-O-l-tyrosine fraction, it is likely that up-regulation of this protein in the PG is under the control of another humoral factor.

https://openalex.org/W2086625588,"We have analyzed the modulation of DNA synthesis on a supercoiled plasmid DNA template by DNA polymerases (pol), minichromosome maintenance protein complex (Mcm), topoisomerases, and the origin recognition complex (ORC) using an in vitro assay system. Antisera specific against the four-subunit pol α, the catalytic subunit of pol δ, and the Mcm467 complex each inhibited DNA synthesis. However, DNA synthesis in this system appeared to be independent of polϵ. Consequently, DNA synthesis in the in vitro system appeared to depend only on two polymerases, α and δ, as well as the Mcm467 DNA helicase. This system requires supercoiled plasmid DNA template and DNA synthesis absolutely required DNA topoisomerase I. In addition, we also report here a novel finding that purified recombinant six subunit ORC significantly stimulated the DNA synthesis on a supercoiled plasmid DNA template containing an autonomously replicating sequence, ARS1."
