https://openalex.org/W2022495797,"The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has used the latest sequencing and analysis methods to identify somatic variants across thousands of tumours. Here we present data and analytical results for point mutations and small insertions/deletions from 3,281 tumours across 12 tumour types as part of the TCGA Pan-Cancer effort. We illustrate the distributions of mutation frequencies, types and contexts across tumour types, and establish their links to tissues of origin, environmental/carcinogen influences, and DNA repair defects. Using the integrated data sets, we identified 127 significantly mutated genes from well-known (for example, mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase, Wnt/β-catenin and receptor tyrosine kinase signalling pathways, and cell cycle control) and emerging (for example, histone, histone modification, splicing, metabolism and proteolysis) cellular processes in cancer. The average number of mutations in these significantly mutated genes varies across tumour types; most tumours have two to six, indicating that the number of driver mutations required during oncogenesis is relatively small. Mutations in transcriptional factors/regulators show tissue specificity, whereas histone modifiers are often mutated across several cancer types. Clinical association analysis identifies genes having a significant effect on survival, and investigations of mutations with respect to clonal/subclonal architecture delineate their temporal orders during tumorigenesis. Taken together, these results lay the groundwork for developing new diagnostics and individualizing cancer treatment. As part of The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer effort, data analysis for point mutations and small indels from 3,281 tumours and 12 tumour types is presented; among the findings are 127 significantly mutated genes from cellular processes with both established and emerging links in cancer, and an indication that the number of driver mutations required for oncogenesis is relatively small. As part of The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer project, these authors present data analysis for point mutations and small indels from more than 3,000 tumours representing 12 tumour types. Among the findings are 127 significantly mutated genes from cellular processes with both established and emerging links to cancer, and an indication that the number of driver mutations required for oncogenesis is relatively small. Additional analyses also identify genes with significant impact on survival and a likely temporal order of mutational events during tumorigenesis."

Deletions of chromosome 22q13.3 cause Phelan–McDermid syndrome (PMDS), a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with autism. Ricardo Dolmetsch and colleagues generated induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from PMDS patients with autism and used them to produce neurons. PMDS neurons have reduced expression of the SHANK3 gene, which encodes a protein found in a structure known as the postsynaptic density, and a defect in excitatory synaptic transmission that can be restored either by increasing SHANK3 or with insulin-like growth factor 1. These findings add to the picture of synaptic deficits observed in autism spectrum disorders, and point to potential mechanisms for restoring them. Phelan–McDermid syndrome (PMDS) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by global developmental delay, severely impaired speech, intellectual disability, and an increased risk of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs)1. PMDS is caused by heterozygous deletions of chromosome 22q13.3. Among the genes in the deleted region is SHANK3, which encodes a protein in the postsynaptic density (PSD)2,3. Rare mutations in SHANK3 have been associated with idiopathic ASDs4,5,6,7, non-syndromic intellectual disability8, and schizophrenia9. Although SHANK3 is considered to be the most likely candidate gene for the neurological abnormalities in PMDS patients10, the cellular and molecular phenotypes associated with this syndrome in human neurons are unknown. We generated induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from individuals with PMDS and autism and used them to produce functional neurons. We show that PMDS neurons have reduced SHANK3 expression and major defects in excitatory, but not inhibitory, synaptic transmission. Excitatory synaptic transmission in PMDS neurons can be corrected by restoring SHANK3 expression or by treating neurons with insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1). IGF1 treatment promotes formation of mature excitatory synapses that lack SHANK3 but contain PSD95 and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors with fast deactivation kinetics. Our findings provide direct evidence for a disruption in the ratio of cellular excitation and inhibition in PMDS neurons, and point to a molecular pathway that can be recruited to restore it."
https://openalex.org/W2074049639,"Optical spectroscopy and imaging of microscopic samples have opened up a wide range of applications throughout the physical, chemical, and biological sciences. High chemical specificity may be achieved by directly interrogating the fundamental or low-lying vibrational energy levels of the compound molecules. Amongst the available prevailing label-free techniques, coherent Raman scattering has the distinguishing features of high spatial resolution down to 200 nm and three-dimensional sectioning. However, combining fast imaging speed and identification of multiple - and possibly unexpected- compounds remains challenging: existing high spectral resolution schemes require long measurement times to achieve broad spectral spans. Here we overcome this difficulty and introduce a novel concept of coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) spectro-imaging with two laser frequency combs. We illustrate the power of our technique with high resolution (4 cm-1) Raman spectra spanning more than 1200 cm-1 recorded within less than 15 microseconds. Furthermore, hyperspectral images combining high spectral (10 cm-1) and spatial (2 micrometers) resolutions are acquired at a rate of 50 pixels per second. Real-time multiplex accessing of hyperspectral images may dramatically expand the range of applications of nonlinear microscopy."

Emerging evidence suggests communication between cancer cells and their microenvironment occurs via exosomes. This study aimed to clarify whether hypoxia affects angiogenic function through exosomes secreted from leukemia cells. We used the human leukemia cell line K562 for exosome-generating cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) for exosome target cells. Exosomes derived from K562 cells cultured under normoxic (20%) or hypoxic (1%) conditions for 24 h were isolated and quantitated by nanoparticle tracking analysis. These exosomes were then cocultured with HUVECs to evaluate angiogenic activity. The exosomes secreted from K562 cells in hypoxic conditions significantly enhanced tube formation by HUVECs compared with exosomes produced in normoxic conditions. Using a TaqMan low-density miRNA array, we found a subset of miRNAs, including miR-210, were significantly increased in exosomes secreted from hypoxic K562 cells. We demonstrated that cancer cells and their exosomes have altered miRNA profiles under hypoxic conditions. Although exosomes contain various molecular constituents such as proteins and mRNAs, altered exosomal compartments under hypoxic conditions, including miR-210, affected the behavior of endothelial cells. Our results suggest that exosomal miRNA derived from cancer cells under hypoxic conditions may partly affect angiogenic activity in endothelial cells.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: 13147-13152Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar); however, the precise mechanism by which tumor progression and angiogenesis are affected has not been fully elucidated. Here we provide data showing that hypoxic tumor cells secrete exosomal miRNA, which enhances tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) due to inhibition of the receptor tyrosine kinase ligand Ephrin-A3. We used human leukemia cell line K562 for exosome-generating cells and HUVECs as exosome target cells. Cells were maintained as described previously (20Umezu T. Ohyashiki K. Kuroda M. Ohyashiki J.H. Leukemia cell to endothelial cell communication via exosomal miRNAs.Oncogene. 2013; 32: 2747-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Pooled HUVECs were purchased from Lonza, Inc. (Allendale, NJ) and cultured in endothelial basal medium (EBM-2; Lonza, Inc.) supplemented with EGM-2 singleQuots and 5% FBS at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 until the third passage. K562 cells were cultured for 24–72 h under hypoxic conditions (1% O2, 5% CO2, 94% N2) in a humidified gas-sorted hypoxic incubator (MCO-5M, Sanyo, Osaka, Japan) using the degassed culture mediums (AIM-V medium, Invitrogen). RPMI8226 (multiple myeloma) and SUDHL4 (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) cell lines were also used for the tube formation assay and miRNA profiling. K562, RPMI8226, and SUDHL4 cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml and cultured for 24 h unless otherwise indicated under hypoxic conditions (1% O2) or normoxic conditions (20% O2) in serum-free AIM-V medium (Invitrogen). The exosomes were purified by Exoquick Exosome Precipitation Solution (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA) as described previously (20Umezu T. Ohyashiki K. Kuroda M. Ohyashiki J.H. Leukemia cell to endothelial cell communication via exosomal miRNAs.Oncogene. 2013; 32: 2747-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Exosome pellets were resuspended with 500 μl of the serum-free AIM-V medium (Invitrogen). For electron microscopy analysis, exosomes were prepared, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at incubation temperature, and placed in a refrigerator to lower temperature to 4 °C. The samples were adsorbed to a 400-mesh carbon-coated grid and immersed in 2% phosphotungstic acid solution (pH 7.0) for 30 s. The samples were observed by transmission electron microscope (JEM-1200EX; JEOL, Ltd., Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV. NTA measurements were performed using the Nanosight LM10 system (Nanosight, Amesbury, UK) equipped with a blue laser (405 nm). Exosomes were illuminated by the laser and their movement under Brownian motion was recorded in 90-s sample videos, which were analyzed with NTA analytical software (version 2.0, Nanosight). We serially diluted all samples with PBS to reach a particle concentration suitable for analysis with NTA (1 × 108 to 2.5 × 109 particles/ml). The capture settings (shutter and gain) and analysis settings were done manually according to the manufacturer's instructions. All analysis settings were kept constant within each experiment. NTAs were averaged within each sample across the video replicates and then averaged across samples to provide total nanoparticle concentrations. The nanoparticle concentration was normalized to cell numbers at the time of harvest. The formation of capillary-like structures was assessed in a 24-well plate using growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences). For this procedure, HUVECs (2 × 104 cells/well) were plated on top of Matrigel (280 μl/well) and treated with exosomes derived from K562 cells cultured under hypoxic conditions (K5621%O2-exosome) or under normoxic conditions (K56220%O2-exosome). After 24 h, cells were visualized under the bright-field microscope (BZ-8000, Keyence, Osaka, Japan). The total tube area was quantified as the mean pixel density obtained from image analysis of five random microscopic fields using ImageJ software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). Isolation of cellular and exosomal miRNAs was performed using the miRNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The cell or exosome pellets were dissolved with 700 μl of QIAzol lysis regent (Qiagen). After a 2-min incubation, 1 μl of 1 nm ath-miR-159 (Hokkaido System Science, Hokkaido, Japan) was added to each aliquot as a spike control for losses in preparation, followed by vortexing for 30 s, and incubation on ice for 10 min. Subsequent phenol extraction and cartridge filtration were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. miRNA profiling in both cells and exosomes was done using a TaqMan low-density miRNA array (Applied Biosystems, Bedford, MA). To identify cellular and exosomal miRNAs universally responding to hypoxic conditions, we also performed miRNA profiles in two additional cell lines derived from hematologic malignancies (RPMI8226, multiple myeloma; SUDHL4, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma). A fixed volume of 3 μl of RNA solution from 50 μl of the elution was used as input in each RT reaction. An RT reaction and preamplification step were set up according to the manufacturers' recommendations. miRNAs were reverse transcribed using the Megaplex Primer Pools (Human Pools A, version 2.1) from Applied Biosystems. RT reaction products from the exosome sample were further amplified using the Megaplex PreAmp Primers (Primers A, version 2.1). The expression profile of miRNAs was determined using the Human TaqMan miRNA Arrays A (Applied Biosystems). RNU6B and a spike control (ath-miR159) were used as an invariant control for the cell and culture medium, respectively. Quantitative RT-PCR was carried out on an Applied Biosystems 7900HT thermal cycler using the manufacturer's recommended program. Finally, all of the raw data from each array were retrieved from the 7900HT and run on Data Assist Software (version 3.1, Applied Biosystems). Pre-mir miRNA precursor (has-miR-210; Applied Biosystems) was labeled with Label IT siRNA Tracker Cy3 Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Mirus, Madison, WI). K562 cells (1 × 105) were transfected with 10 nm of Cy3-labeled pre-mir miRNA precursor using HiPerFect (Qiagen) (K562/Cy3-miR-210). The day after transfection, cells were washed three times with PBS, and the medium was switched to fresh serum-free AIM-V medium (Invitrogen). After incubation for a day, the culture medium was collected and used for purification of exosome fraction by Exoquick (System Biosciences). The exosomes, including Cy3-miR-210, were incubated with 2 μm PKH67 (Sigma Aldrich) for 5 min at 25 °C and washed four times using Amicon Ultra-0.5 (100 kDa, Millipore, Billerica, MA). Donor cells (K562 cells; 1 × 105) or recipient cells (HUVECs; 3 × 104) were transfected with scrambled control (negative control 1, Ambion) or anti-miR-210 miRNA inhibitors (Ambion) using HiPerFect (Qiagen). The following day, after a change to fresh media, cells were cultured under hypoxic conditions for 24 h. The exosomes derived from K5621%O2/anti-miR-210 or K5621%O2/control cells were purified as described previously. Synthetic oligonucleotides bearing the Ephrin-A3 (EFNA3) 3′-UTR with the miR-210 complementary binding site (5′-TTTGTCTTCTGTGAAGACAGGACCTATGCAACGCACAGACACTTTTGGAGACCGT-3′) were cloned into the firefly luciferase reporter plasmid pMIR-Report (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The seed sequence of miR-210 (ACGCACA) is indicated by boldface and underlined type. We also generated the mutated sensor vector that replaced the seed sequence of miR-210 with CATACAC. For measuring luciferase activity, HUVECs were grown in 24-well plates until 50–60% confluence. The Luciferase plasmid (0.1 μg) was co-transfected with 0.01 μg of pMIR-Report β-gal control plasmid (Applied Biosystems) as control for the transfection efficiency. After incubation for a day, HUVECs were treated with the exosome derived from K562 cells cultured under hypoxic conditions (K5621%O2-exosome) or under normoxic conditions (K56220%O2-exosome), and the activity of luciferase and β-gal was assessed after 48 h with the Dual-Light System according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (Roche Diagnostics) and equal amounts of protein were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Immunoblots were probed with antibodies directed against hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α; rabbit polyclonal anti-HIF-1α; 1:500, NB100–134, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), CD63 (rabbit polyclonal anti-CD63; 1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), Ephrin-A3 (sc-733954; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or β-actin (mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin, 1:2500, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). Secondary antibodies were purchased from GE Healthcare. HUVECs were seeded on glass coverslips (Matsunami Glass) and cultured in normoxic conditions (20% O2) with K5621%O2-exosomes or K56220%O2-exosomes. Ephrin-A3 was detected by using polyclonal anti-Ephrin-A3 antibody (sc-1012; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG goat serum (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) were used as secondary antibodies. DAPI (Abbott, Abbott Park, IL) was used for nuclear staining. Analyses were performed with a fluorescent microscope (Biozero BZ-8000; Keyence, Osaka, Japan). Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Two treatment groups were compared by Mann-Whitney U test or Student's t test. Multiple group comparisons were done by analysis of variance. For statistical analysis, GraphPad Prism for Macintosh (version 5c, GraphPad, Inc., La Jolla, CA) was used. Results were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. We first examined the response to hypoxia in K562 cells. The cell growth was measured following 24, 48, and 72 h of normoxic (20% O2) or hypoxic (1% O2) culture. K562 cell growth was not significantly different between normoxia and hypoxia for 24 h, but it was reduced by incubation under hypoxic conditions for 48–72 h (Fig. 1A). The expression of a master regulator of hypoxic response, HIF-1α was remarkably up-regulated in hypoxic conditions after 24 h (Fig. 1B). K562 cells were cultured under hypoxic or normoxic conditions, and the exosome fraction was isolated by Exoquick after 24 h, after which we observed the ultrastructure of exosomes using transmission electron microscopy. The size of exosomes derived from hypoxic K562 cells was similar to the exosomes derived from normoxic K562 cells (50–100 nm in diameter), and each of those vesicles showed the classical cup-shaped appearance (Fig. 1, C and D). We further checked the expression of the exosome marker CD63 by immunoblotting. The expression level of CD63 was not changed when K562 cells were cultured under hypoxic conditions for 24 h (Fig. 1E). To further investigate the size distribution profile of exosomes derived from K562 cells under normoxic conditions (K56220%O2-exosome) and hypoxic conditions (K5621%O2-exosome), we performed NTA using the Nanosight LM10 system. The nanoparticle size distribution of K56220%O2-exosomes was similar to K5621%O2-exosomes when cells were cultured for 24 h; the peaks of particle size were ∼100 nm within the expected size of exosomes (Fig. 1F). When nanoparticle concentrations were normalized to cell numbers at the time of harvest, there were no significant differences observed between K56220%O2-exosomes and K5621%O2-exosomes (Fig. 1G). These results indicate that the size and concentration of exosomes secreted from K562 cells were not affected when cells were exposed to hypoxia for 24 h. In contrast, the nanoparticle size distribution of K56220%O2-exosomes (control) was different from that of K5621%O2-exosomes when cells were exposed to hypoxia for 72 h. We found nanoparticles of various sizes in the control sample; therefore, we could not evaluate the amount of exosome release when cells were cultured for 72 h (data not shown). Consequently, we used the exosomes isolated from culture medium following 24 h of normoxic or hypoxic conditions because culture hypoxic conditions for 24 h affected neither the cancer cell growth nor the amount of exosomes secreted into the culture medium. We next performed endothelial tube formation assays with the exosomes derived from K562 cells following 24 h of normoxic (K5621%O2-exosomes) or hypoxic (K56220%O2-exosomes) conditions. K5621%O2-exosomes remarkably enhanced the tube formation of HUVECs under normoxic conditions (Fig. 2, A and D; **, p < 0.001; *, p < 0.01, respectively) compared with K56220%O2-exosomes (Fig. 2, B and D) or control (HUVECs20%O2; Fig. 2, C and D). We also investigated whether or not K5621%O2-exosomes could affect growth and cell viability of HUVECs; however, we could not find any significant difference in the growth of HUVECs between K5621%O2-exosomes and K56220%O2-exosomes (data not shown). Enhanced tube formation of HUVECs also occurred with exosomes derived from hypoxic RPMI8226 cells (RPMI82261%O2-exosomes) (Fig. 2, E–H). These results indicate that hypoxic cancer exosomes may affect tube formation rather than endothelial cell proliferation. To identify hypoxia-induced exosomal miRNAs, we performed miRNA profiling using the TaqMan low-density array (NCBI, gene expression omnibus (GEO) accession no. GSE45289). Based on the results obtained from the characterization of hypoxic K562 cells and the endothelial tube formation assay, we used the exosomes derived from K562 cells cultured under hypoxic or normoxic conditions for 24 h. The 2(−ΔCt) values of cellular and exosomal miRNAs were ranked with a fold change > 1.5 by hypoxic conditions compared with normoxic conditions (Table 1). Two miRNAs (miR-18b and miR-210) were found among the top 10 up-regulated miRNAs under hypoxic conditions in both cells and exosomes. To clarify whether up-regulation of miR-18b and miR-210 was specific for K562 cells, we performed the miRNA profiles using two additional cell lines. The cellular and exosomal miRNAs with a fold change > 1.5 by hypoxic conditions compared with normoxic conditions were classified according to Ct value (20–25, 25–30, 30–35 cycles) and are shown in supplemental Tables S1 and S2, respectively (GEO accession nos. GSE45387 and GSE45388). Eventually, we found that miR-210 was elevated under hypoxic conditions in both cells and exosomes, in all three cell lines analyzed. Thus, we focused on miR-210 for further study.TABLE 1Top 10 cellular and exosomal miRNAs elevated under hypoxic conditions in K562 cellsRankCellular miRNAExosomal miRNA1hsa-miR-19ahsa-miR-20a2hsa-miR-146–5phsa-miR-243hsa-miR-454hsa-miR-18b4hsa-miR-18bhsa-miR-130b5hsa-miR-574–3phsa-miR-106b6hsa-miR-21hsa-miR-2247hsa-miR-431hsa-miR-2108hsa-miR-345hsa-miR-6529hsa-miR-210hsa-miR-37910hsa-miR-197hsa-miR-185 Open table in a new tab Based on the endothelial tube formation assay, K5621%O2-exosomes containing miR-210 abundantly enhanced the capillary-like structure of HUVECs. To ascertain the association between exosomal miR-210 from K562 cells and angiogenesis under hypoxic conditions, we further investigated whether miR-210 regulated the target factor in HUVECs via exosomes. We first visualized the transport of exosomal miR-210 derived from K562 cells into HUVECs by using the modified method that we reported previously (20Umezu T. Ohyashiki K. Kuroda M. Ohyashiki J.H. Leukemia cell to endothelial cell communication via exosomal miRNAs.Oncogene. 2013; 32: 2747-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). After incubation with PKH67-labeled exosomes derived from K562/Cy3-miR-210 cells, the Cy3-miR-210 signals and PKH67 signals were co-localized in the cytoplasm of HUVECs (Fig. 3, A–F). Next, we performed a luciferase reporter assay to test whether exosomal miR-210 directly regulates the target gene, EFNA3, anti-angiogenic factor, in HUVECs. When HUVECs transduced with the reporter plasmids containing EFNA3 3′-UTR with the miR-210 complementary binding site (sensor vector) were incubated with K5621%O2-exosomes, the firefly luciferase activity was reduced as compared with K56220%O2-exosomes (*, p < 0.05; Fig. 3G). In contrast, the K5621%O2-exosomes did not reduce the luciferase activity using a mutated sensor vector of the miR-210 (Fig. 3H). To demonstrate that exosomal miR-210 is a major player in promoting endothelial tube formation, we performed a knockdown experiment centered on it. We first validated the efficacy of the miR-210 inhibitor using a luciferase reporter assay. When K562 cells were transduced with the sensor vector, miR-210 inhibitor strongly inhibited miR-210 activity in K562 cells cultured under hypoxic conditions (with K562-exosome versus control: *, p < 0.05; anti-miR-210 versus control: #, p < 0.05; Fig. 4A). In contrast, the miR-210 inhibitor did not affect the luciferase activity when a mutated vector of the miR-210 was used (data not shown). The results of NTA suggested that there was no change in the amount of secreted exosomes between K5621%O2/control (K5621%O2 cells transfected with negative control miR) and K5621%O2/anti-miR-210 (K5621%O2 cells transfected with miR-210 inhibitor) (Fig. 4B). In addition to affecting intercellular miR-210, the miR-210 inhibitor disrupted the activity of exosomal miR-210; K5621%O2/anti-miR-210-exosome could not reduce the luciferase activity in HUVECs transduced with the reporter plasmids (with K562-exosome versus control: *, p < 0.05; anti-miR-210 versus negative control: #, p < 0.05; Fig. 4C). Furthermore, the knockdown of miR-210 led to a decrease in endothelial tube formation via exosomes (Fig. 4, D–F, K5621%O2/control-exosome versus K5621%O2/anti-miR-210-exosome). These findings may indicate that exosomal miR-210 plays an important role in endothelial tube formation. However, we could not completely rule out the possibility that the major effect on the HUVECs was likely due to another agent because miR-210 inhibitor had only a modest, albeit significant effect. Additionally, to test whether recipient cells (HUVECs) rely on miR-210 for their response to exosomes, HUVECs20%O2 were directly transfected with miR-210 inhibitor and plated on Matrigel for 24 h. We could not find any significant difference in the tube formation between HUVECs20%O2/anti-miR-210 and HUVECs20%O2/control (Fig. 4, G–I). Finally, we confirmed expression of EFNA3 in HUVECs incubated with K56220%O2-exosomes or K5621%O2-exosomes. The expression of EFNA3 was suppressed by the addition of K5621%O2-exosomes into HUVECs cultured under normoxic conditions (Fig. 5, A–C; *, p < 0.001). We also demonstrated the suppression of EFNA3 expression via K5621%O2-exosomes, as shown by immunoblot (Fig. 5D). The suppressed EFNA3 expression of HUVECs was also found by exosomes derived from hypoxic RPMI8226 cells (RPMI82261%O2-exosomes) (Fig. 5, E–H). We subsequently concluded that miR-210 might be transferred into HUVECs via exosomes as a signal of hypoxic response and might induce the tubulogenesis of HUVECs under normoxic conditions. Tumor cell-derived exosomes and their roles in intercellular communication of the tumor microenvironment is an emerging concept in cancer research (17Webber J. Steadman R. Mason M.D. Tabi Z.

https://openalex.org/W2099939664,"The stochastic evolution of quantum systems during measurement is arguably the most enigmatic feature of quantum mechanics. Measuring a quantum system typically steers it towards a classical state, destroying any initial quantum superposition and any entanglement with other quantum systems. Remarkably, the measurement of a shared property between non-interacting quantum systems can generate entanglement starting from an uncorrelated state. Of special interest in quantum computing is the parity measurement, which projects a register of quantum bits (qubits) to a state with an even or odd total number of excitations. Crucially, a parity meter must discern the two parities with high fidelity while preserving coherence between same-parity states. Despite numerous proposals for atomic, semiconducting, and superconducting qubits, realizing a parity meter creating entanglement for both even and odd measurement results has remained an outstanding challenge. We realize a time-resolved, continuous parity measurement of two superconducting qubits using the cavity in a 3D circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architecture and phase-sensitive parametric amplification. Using postselection, we produce entanglement by parity measurement reaching 77% concurrence. Incorporating the parity meter in a feedback-control loop, we transform the entanglement generation from probabilistic to fully deterministic, achieving 66% fidelity to a target Bell state on demand. These realizations of a parity meter and a feedback-enabled deterministic measurement protocol provide key ingredients for active quantum error correction in the solid state."
https://openalex.org/W2104085121,"Super-luminous supernovae that radiate more than 10(44) ergs per second at their peak luminosity have recently been discovered in faint galaxies at redshifts of 0.1-4. Some evolve slowly, resembling models of 'pair-instability' supernovae. Such models involve stars with original masses 140-260 times that of the Sun that now have carbon-oxygen cores of 65-130 solar masses. In these stars, the photons that prevent gravitational collapse are converted to electron-positron pairs, causing rapid contraction and thermonuclear explosions. Many solar masses of (56)Ni are synthesized; this isotope decays to (56)Fe via (56)Co, powering bright light curves. Such massive progenitors are expected to have formed from metal-poor gas in the early Universe. Recently, supernova 2007bi in a galaxy at redshift 0.127 (about 12 billion years after the Big Bang) with a metallicity one-third that of the Sun was observed to look like a fading pair-instability supernova. Here we report observations of two slow-to-fade super-luminous supernovae that show relatively fast rise times and blue colours, which are incompatible with pair-instability models. Their late-time light-curve and spectral similarities to supernova 2007bi call the nature of that event into question. Our early spectra closely resemble typical fast-declining super-luminous supernovae, which are not powered by radioactivity. Modelling our observations with 10-16 solar masses of magnetar-energized ejecta demonstrates the possibility of a common explosion mechanism. The lack of unambiguous nearby pair-instability events suggests that their local rate of occurrence is less than 6 × 10(-6) times that of the core-collapse rate."

https://openalex.org/W1995319895,"A new protein, Arpin, is identified that inhibits the Arp2/3 complex and controls cell migration by decreasing cell speed and the directional persistence of migration; this inhibitory circuit is under the control of the small GTPase Rac1, and Arpin depletion causes faster lamellipodia protrusion and increased cell migration. Cell migration is powered by branched actin networks generated by the nucleation activity of the Arp2/3 complex. In this study, Alexis Gautreau and colleagues identify a novel protein called Arpin that inhibits the Arp2/3 complex and restricts cell exploration by decreasing cell speed and directional persistence of migration. Arpin thus steers cell migration, and is a prime candidate to fine-tune numerous physiological migration activities biased by diverse cues. Cell migration requires the generation of branched actin networks that power the protrusion of the plasma membrane in lamellipodia1,2. The actin-related proteins 2 and 3 (Arp2/3) complex is the molecular machine that nucleates these branched actin networks3. This machine is activated at the leading edge of migrating cells by Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)-family verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE, also known as SCAR). The WAVE complex is itself directly activated by the small GTPase Rac, which induces lamellipodia4,5,6. However, how cells regulate the directionality of migration is poorly understood. Here we identify a new protein, Arpin, that inhibits the Arp2/3 complex in vitro, and show that Rac signalling recruits and activates Arpin at the lamellipodial tip, like WAVE. Consistently, after depletion of the inhibitory Arpin, lamellipodia protrude faster and cells migrate faster. A major role of this inhibitory circuit, however, is to control directional persistence of migration. Indeed, Arpin depletion in both mammalian cells and Dictyostelium discoideum amoeba resulted in straighter trajectories, whereas Arpin microinjection in fish keratocytes, one of the most persistent systems of cell migration, induced these cells to turn. The coexistence of the Rac–Arpin–Arp2/3 inhibitory circuit with the Rac–WAVE–Arp2/3 activatory circuit can account for this conserved role of Arpin in steering cell migration."

Methods Twenty three adult males completed 4 sessions•wk-1 of resistance training for 16 wk. Muscle biopsies were obtained before and after the training period and acutely 1 and 5 h after the first training session. Serum hormones and cytokines were measured immediately, 15, 30 and 60 minutes following the first and last training sessions of the study. Results Mean fiber area increased by 20% (range: -7 to 80%; P<0.001). Protein content of the AR was unchanged with training (fold change = 1.17 ± 0.61; P=0.19); however, there was a significant correlation between the changes in AR content and fiber area (r=0.60, P=0.023). Phosphorylation of p70S6K was elevated 5 hours following exercise, which was correlated with gains in mean fiber area (r=0.54, P=0.007). There was no relationship between the magnitude of the pre- or post-training exercise-induced changes in free testosterone, GH, or IGF-1 concentration and muscle fiber hypertrophy; however, the magnitude of the post exercise IL-6 response was correlated with muscle hypertrophy (r=0.48, P=0.019). Conclusion Post-exercise increases in circulating hormones are not related to hypertrophy following training. Exercise-induced changes in IL-6 correlated with hypertrophy, but the mechanism for the role of IL-6 in hypertrophy is not known. Acute increases, in p70S6K phosphorylation and changes in muscle AR protein content correlated with muscle hypertrophy implicating intramuscular rather than systemic processes in mediating hypertrophy."

For certain adipogenic experiments, 1 μm rosiglitazone (Thermo Fisher Scientific), a PPARγ agonist, was added to the adipogenic medium. Total RNA, including miRNA, was extracted from ASC by using a mirVana isolation kit (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Reverse transcription was performed using a TaqMan microRNA reverse transcription kit (Invitrogen) and reverse transcriptase primers from the specific TaqMan microRNA assays (Invitrogen). Equal amounts of total RNA (10 ng) were reverse-transcribed with 1 mm dNTPs, 50 units of reverse transcriptase, 4 units of RNase inhibitor, and specific miRNA reverse transcriptase primers in a total volume of 15 μl at 16 °C for 30 min, 42 °C for 30 min, and 85 °C for 5 min.

Mitochondrial dysfunction and adipogenic reduction by prohibitin silencing in 3T3-L1 cells.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e34315Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from ASC at the indicated times using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Isolated RNA was reverse-transcribed with an oligo(dT) primer using an Advantage RT-for-PCR kit (Clontech). Real-time PCR was performed using a LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Applied Science) and a LightCycler real-time thermal cycler (Roche Applied Science). The primer pairs used were 5′-agtggtggctcgctttgatgct-3′ and 5′-gatgatggccgcctttttctgtt-3′ for human PHB, 5′-agcctcatgaagagccttcca-3′ and 5′-tccggaagaaacccttgca-3′ for human PPARγ, 5′-tgtgcagaaatgggatggaaa-3′ and 5′-caacgtcccttggcttatgct-3′ for human aP2, and 5′-ggaagggcaccaccaggagt-3′ and 5′-tgcagccccggacatctaag-3′ for human 18 S rRNA (used as an internal control). The amplified products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 2% E-Gel agarose (Invitrogen) to verify the primer specificity and PCR product size. Lentiviral plasmids pLenti/miR-Control, pLenti/miR-27a, and pLenti/miR-27b were purchased from System Biosciences (Mountain View, CA); pLenti/Luc-UTR/Blank, pLenti/Luc-UTR/PHB, and pLenti/Luc-UTR/PHBmut were purchased from Applied Biological Materials (Richmond, British Columbia, Canada); pLenti/GFP was purchased from Invitrogen; and pLenti/PHB was created in our laboratory. The creation, concentration, titration, and ASC transduction of lentivirus were described previously (22Liu D. Lin Y. Kang T. Huang B. Xu W. Garcia-Barrio M. Olatinwo M. Matthews R. Chen Y.E. Thompson W.E. Mitochondrial dysfunction and adipogenic reduction by prohibitin silencing in 3T3-L1 cells.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e34315Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). ASC transduction efficiency of lentivirus was evaluated by determining GFP expression of Lenti/miR-Control, Lenti/miR-27a, and Lenti/miR-27b by flow cytometry. Briefly, ASC were harvested after transduction of lentivirus for 3 days and analyzed on a Guava EasyCyte flow cytometer (EMD Millipore). The green fluorescence of the measured cell population (events = 5000) was gated using the Guava Express Plus program. Cells were lysed in mammalian protein extraction reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The cell lysates were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% or 4–12% precast BisTris gel (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred from the gel to a nitrocellulose membrane using an iBlot dry blotting system (Invitrogen). Specific proteins were detected using anti-PHB (BioLegend, San Diego, CA), anti-C/EBPβ (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), anti-PPARγ (Cell Signaling), anti-aP2 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), and anti-HSP90 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) primary antibodies. HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) was used as a secondary antibody. Blots were revealed with enhanced chemiluminescent reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Oil Red O (Sigma) staining was performed as described previously (22Liu D. Lin Y. Kang T. Huang B. Xu W. Garcia-Barrio M. Olatinwo M. Matthews R. Chen Y.E. Thompson W.E. Mitochondrial dysfunction and adipogenic reduction by prohibitin silencing in 3T3-L1 cells.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e34315Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Fourteen days after the induction of adipocyte differentiation, ASC in 35-mm dishes were washed with PBS and fixed with 10% formalin. The cells were washed once with 60% isopropyl alcohol and left to dry completely. The cells were then stained with 0.2% Oil Red O for 10 min, rinsed once with 60% isopropyl alcohol, and thoroughly washed four times with water. The dishes were scanned to obtain the pictures. The dye was then extracted with 100% isopropyl alcohol and quantified on a spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) by reading the absorbance at a wavelength of 510 nm. Luciferase activities in ASC were determined using a luciferase assay kit (Applied Biological Materials) and an Lmax microplate luminometer with SoftMax Pro software (Molecular Devices) according to the instructions of the manufacturers. In brief, ASC were transduced with Lenti/miR-Control, Lenti/miR-27a, or Lenti/miR-27b at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 2. The following day, the cells were transduced with Lenti/Luc-UTR/Blank, Lenti/Luc-UTR/PHB, or Lenti/Luc-UTR/PHBmut at m.o.i. = 1. After 2 days of additional incubation, the cells were washed once with PBS. Cell lysis buffer, included in the kit, was added to the cells, followed by incubation at room temperature for 25 min. An equal volume of luciferase assay reagent was added to the cells. The luminescence was measured using a 10-s integration time between 30 min and 1 h after the addition of the assay reagent. Total DNA in ASC was isolated with a DNeasy DNA isolation kit (Qiagen). The DNA levels of the human mitochondrial ND1 (NADH dehydrogenase 1) gene and nuclear 18 S rRNA were determined by real-time PCR quantification. The relative mtDNA content was reflected by the ratio of DNA levels between mitochondrial ND1 and nuclear 18 S rRNA as described previously (26Liou C.W. Lin T.K. Chen J.B. Tiao M.M. Weng S.W. Chen S.D. Chuang Y.C. Chuang J.H. Wang P.W. Association between a common mitochondrial DNA D-loop polycytosine variant and alteration of mitochondrial copy number in human peripheral blood cells.J. Med. Genet. 2010; 47: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial membrane potential of ASC was measured by detecting the accumulation of tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE), a red fluorescent dye, in active mitochondria by flow cytometry. Briefly, ASC were incubated in 200 nmol/liter TMRE at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 20 min. The cells were then washed with PBS once and trypsinized. The red fluorescence of the cell population (events = 10,000) was gated using the Guava Express Plus program in a Guava EasyCyte system. ASC in Lab-Tek chamber slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were stained with 250 nmol/liter MitoTracker (Invitrogen) in serum-free DMEM for 15 min at 37 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions. Images were captured and analyzed using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscopy system (Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL) as described previously (22Liu D. Lin Y. Kang T. Huang B. Xu W. Garcia-Barrio M. Olatinwo M. Matthews R. Chen Y.E. Thompson W.E. Mitochondrial dysfunction and adipogenic reduction by prohibitin silencing in 3T3-L1 cells.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e34315Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Three days post-transduction of ASC in a 96-well plate with Lenti/miR-Control, Lenti/miR-27a, or Lenti/miR-27b, the ATP concentration was measured using an ATP assay system bioluminescence detection kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and the Lmax microplate luminometer with SoftMax Pro software (22Liu D. Lin Y. Kang T. Huang B. Xu W. Garcia-Barrio M. Olatinwo M. Matthews R. Chen Y.E. Thompson W.E. Mitochondrial dysfunction and adipogenic reduction by prohibitin silencing in 3T3-L1 cells.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e34315Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). ROS were detected with the cell-permeable, peroxide-sensitive fluorophore CellROX Orange reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The dye is non-fluorescent while in a reduced state and exhibits bright orange fluorescence upon oxidation by ROS. ASC in a 96-well plate were transduced with Lenti/miR-Control, Lenti/miR-27a, or Lenti/miR-27b and cultured for 3 days. The cells were then incubated in 5 μmol/liter CellROX Orange reagent at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by washing twice with prewarmed PBS. Afterward, the plate was read on a GENios Plus microplate reader with universal reader control and data analysis software (Magellan V3.11, Tecan, San Jose, CA). To ensure that the CellROX Orange reagent was detecting hydrogen peroxide, cells were preincubated with 250 units/ml cell-permeable PEG-catalase (Sigma) at 37 °C for 2 h. The activities of mitochondrial complexes I and IV were determined in whole cell lysates of ASC with complexes I and IV enzyme activity dipstick assay kits (Abcam), respectively, according to our previous description (22Liu D. Lin Y. Kang T. Huang B. Xu W. Garcia-Barrio M. Olatinwo M. Matthews R. Chen Y.E. Thompson W.E. Mitochondrial dysfunction and adipogenic reduction by prohibitin silencing in 3T3-L1 cells.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e34315Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and the manufacturer's instructions. All samples were prepared in a minimum of triplicates. Results from the quantitative studies are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Statistical analyses were performed by one-way analysis of variance, and comparisons between groups were performed using Student's t test. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. Our previous studies have revealed that PHB is essential in adipocyte differentiation (22Liu D. Lin Y. Kang T. Huang B. Xu W. Garcia-Barrio M. Olatinwo M. Matthews R. Chen Y.E. Thompson W.E. Mitochondrial dysfunction and adipogenic reduction by prohibitin silencing in 3T3-L1 cells.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e34315Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To further investigate the regulation of PHB, computational prediction of miRNA families targeting PHB was performed using the TargetScan Database (version Human 6.0). Two miRNAs, hsa-miR-27 and hsa-miR-128, were predicted to be broadly conserved miRNA families among vertebrates targeting human PHB (Fig. 1A). The mRNA level of PHB and the levels of miR-27 and miR-128 were therefore examined in ASC during adipogenesis. The induced expression of adipogenic markers PPARγ and aP2 indicated that an adipogenic model was successfully established. An increase in the mRNA level of PHB was observed (Fig. 1B), which confirmed our previous observation at the protein level of PHB in ASC during adipogenesis (22Liu D. Lin Y. Kang T. Huang B. Xu W. Garcia-Barrio M. Olatinwo M. Matthews R. Chen Y.E. Thompson W.E. Mitochondrial dysfunction and adipogenic reduction by prohibitin silencing in 3T3-L1 cells.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e34315Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition, our data demonstrated that both miR-27a and miR-27b were down-regulated in ASC during adipogenesis (Fig. 1C), which was in accordance with the observation in mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (15Lin Q. Gao Z. Alarcon R.M. Ye J. Yun Z. A role of miR-27 in the regulation of adipogenesis.FEBS J. 2009; 276: 2348-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 17Kim S.Y. Kim A.Y. Lee H.W. Son Y.H.

A deep investigation into the adipogenesis mechanism: profile of microRNAs regulating adipogenesis by modulating the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.BMC Genomics. 2010; 11: 320Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and human ASC (16Karbiener M. Fischer C. Nowitsch S. Opriessnig P. Papak C. Ailhaud G. Dani C. Amri E.Z. Scheideler M. microRNA miR-27b impairs human adipocyte differentiation and targets PPARγ.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 390: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). miR-128 was not detected in ASC before or after adipogenic induction. Similar to our results, miR-128 has been previously reported to be expressed at very low levels or not at all in human ASC using miRNA profiling analysis (28Wang K.H. Kao A.P. Singh S. Yu S.L. Kao L.P. Tsai Z.Y. Lin S.D. Li S.S. Comparative expression profiles of mRNAs and microRNAs among human mesenchymal stem cells derived from breast, face, and abdominal adipose tissues.Kaohsiung J. Med. Sci. 2010; 26: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 29Cho J.A. Park H. Lim E.H. Lee K.W. MicroRNA expression profiling in neurogenesis of adipose tissue-derived stem cells.J. Genet. 2011; 90: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These results suggest that miR-27 is associated with adipogenesis and may be a candidate miRNA family targeting PHB. To investigate the potential effects of miR-27 during adipogenesis, miR-27a and miR-27b were overexpressed using lentiviral constructs (m.o.i. = 2). The transduction efficiency of concentrated lentivirus in ASC was evaluated by detecting GFP expressed by the lentiviral construct using flow cytometry. Because of the high transduction efficiency (always in excess of 85%), no antibiotic selection was required (Fig. 2A). An increase of 3–4-fold in miR-27a/b in transduced ASC confirmed overexpression of miR-27a/b (Fig. 2B). In the adipogenic induction experiments, the protein levels of PHB and adipogenic markers C/EBPβ, PPARγ, and aP2 were decreased upon overexpression of miR-27a or miR-27b (Fig. 2C). Likewise, the mRNA of PHB in ASC was significantly reduced as well (Fig. 2D). The lipid accumulation in ASC was also remarkably attenuated at day 14 (Fig. 2E). These data indicate that miR-27 down-regulates PHB expression and suppresses adipocyte differentiation in ASC. Although hsa-miR-27a and hsa-miR-27b are located at chromosomes 19 and 9, respectively, their mature sequences exhibit a single-nucleotide difference, whereas the seed site sequence is identical. Both are predicted to target the same site of the human PHB 3′-UTR (Fig. 3A). To experimentally validate the targeting effect, a luciferase reporter construct expressing the 3′-UTR of human PHB (Lenti/Luc-UTR/PHB) was created. Another construct expressing the mutated 3′-UTR of PHB (Lenti/Luc-UTR/PHBmut), with a deletion of six nucleotides at the predicted miR-27 target site, was used as a control. Lenti/Luc-UTR/Blank was used as a negative control. Results from co-transduction experiments indicated that the relative luciferase activities in Lenti/Luc-UTR/PHB-treated ASC were significantly inhibited by either miR-27a or miR-27b, whereas the luciferase activities in Lenti/Luc-UTR/PHBmut-treated ASC were unaffected (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that PHB is a direct target of miR-27a and miR-27b in ASC. It has been reported that miR-27 directly targets PPARγ and represses adipogenesis (16Karbiener M. Fischer C. Nowitsch S. Opriessnig P. Papak C. Ailhaud G. Dani C. Amri E.Z. Scheideler M. microRNA miR-27b impairs human adipocyte differentiation and targets PPARγ.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Our previous study revealed that PHB silencing inhibits PPARγ expression and adipocyte differentiation; additionally, an increase in PHB occurs earlier than that in PPARγ during adipogenesis, implying that PHB is located upstream of PPARγ in the signaling transduction pathway of adipogenesis (22Liu D.

https://openalex.org/W2045460860,"The dense glycan coat that surrounds every cell is essential for cellular development and physiological function, and it is becoming appreciated that its composition is highly dynamic. Post-translational addition of the polysaccharide repeating unit [-3-xylose-α1,3-glucuronic acid-β1-]n by like-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (LARGE) is required for the glycoprotein dystroglycan to function as a receptor for proteins in the extracellular matrix. Reductions in the amount of [-3-xylose-α1,3-glucuronic acid-β1-]n (hereafter referred to as LARGE-glycan) on dystroglycan result in heterogeneous forms of muscular dystrophy. However, neither patient nor mouse studies has revealed a clear correlation between glycosylation status and phenotype. This disparity can be attributed to our lack of knowledge of the cellular function of the LARGE-glycan repeat. Here we show that coordinated upregulation of Large and dystroglycan in differentiating mouse muscle facilitates rapid extension of LARGE-glycan repeat chains. Using synthesized LARGE-glycan repeats we show a direct correlation between LARGE-glycan extension and its binding capacity for extracellular matrix ligands. Blocking Large upregulation during muscle regeneration results in the synthesis of dystroglycan with minimal LARGE-glycan repeats in association with a less compact basement membrane, immature neuromuscular junctions and dysfunctional muscle predisposed to dystrophy. This was consistent with the finding that patients with increased clinical severity of disease have fewer LARGE-glycan repeats. Our results reveal that the LARGE-glycan of dystroglycan serves as a tunable extracellular matrix protein scaffold, the extension of which is required for normal skeletal muscle function."
https://openalex.org/W2073518011,"Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a surface-sensitive technique that enhances Raman scattering by molecules adsorbed on rough metal surfaces. It is known that metal nanoparticles, especially gold and silver nanoparticles, exhibit great SERS properties, which make them very attractive for the development of biosensors and biocatalysts. On the other hand, the development of ecofriendly methods for the synthesis of metallic nanostructures has become the focus of research in several countries, and many microorganisms and plants have already been used to biosynthesize metallic nanostructures. However, the majority of these are pathogenic to plants or humans. Here, we report gold nanoparticles with good SERS properties, biosynthesized by Neurospora crassa extract under different environmental conditions, increasing Raman signals up to 40 times using methylene blue as a target molecule. Incubation of tetrachloroauric acid solution with the fungal extract at 60°C and a pH value of a) 3, b) 5.5, and c) 10 resulted in the formation of gold nanoparticles of a) different shapes like triangles, hexagons, pentagons etc. in a broad size range of about 10-200 nm, b) mostly quasi-spheres with some different shapes in a main size range of 6-23 nm, and c) only quasi-spheres of 3-12 nm.

https://openalex.org/W2159522765,"Objective People with coronary heart disease (CHD) are at heightened risk of depression, and this co-occurrence of conditions is associated with poorer outcomes including raised mortality. This study compares the diagnostic accuracy of two depression case finding instruments in CHD patients relative to a diagnostic standard, the revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R). Methods The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale depression subscale (HADS-D) and the CIS-R depression module were administered to 803 patients identified from the CHD registers of GP practices in Greater London. Results Of 730 recruited patients without previously identified depression, 32 (4.4%) met ICD-10 depressive episode criteria according to the CIS-R. For the PHQ-9 and HADS-D lower cut-points than those routinely recommended were associated with improved case identifying properties. The PHQ-9 appeared the superior instrument using a cut-point of ≥8 (sensitivity=94%; specificity=84%). Using categorical scoring the PHQ-9 was 59% sensitive and 95% specific. For the HADS-D using cut-point ≥5, sensitivity was 81% and specificity was 77%. Areas under the curves (AUC) (standard error) were 0.95 (0.01) and 0.88 (0.02) for the PHQ-9 and HADS-D, and 0.91 (0.02) for PHQ-9 using the categorical algorithm. Statistically significant differences between AUCs of the PHQ-9 and the HADS-D favoured the former. Severity ratings compared across measures indicated inconsistency between recommended bandings: the PHQ-9 categorised a larger proportion of participants with mild and moderate depression. Conclusion This is the first large-scale investigation of the accuracy of these commonly used measures within a primary care CHD population. Our results suggest that although both scales have acceptable abilities and can be used as case identification instruments for depression in patients with CHD, the PHQ-9 appeared diagnostically superior. Importantly, optimal cut-off points for depression identification in this population appear to differ from standard values, and severity ratings differ between these measures."
https://openalex.org/W2166118952,"Staphylococcus aureus encodes a remarkable number of virulence factors which may contribute to its pathogenicity and ability to cause invasive disease. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the association between S. aureus invasiveness and bacterial genotype, in terms of the presence of virulence genes and affiliation to clonal complexes. Also, the significance of different virulence genes, mainly adhesins, for the development of infective endocarditis was investigated. DNA microarray technology was used to analyze 134 S. aureus isolates, all methicillin-susceptible, derived from three groups of clinically well-characterized patients: nasal carriers (n=46), bacteremia (n=55), and bacteremia with infective endocarditis (n=33). Invasive isolates were dominant in four of the major clonal complexes: 5, 8, 15, and 25. Of the 170 virulence genes examined, those encoding accessory gene regulator group II (agr II), capsule polysaccharide serotype 5 (cap5), and adhesins such as S. aureus surface protein G (sasG) and fibronectin-binding protein B (fnbB) were found to be associated with invasive disease. The same was shown for the leukocidin genes lukD/lukE, as well as the genes encoding serine protease A and B (splA/splB), staphylococcal complement inhibitor (scn) and the staphylococcal exotoxin-like protein (setC or selX). In addition, there was a trend of higher prevalence of certain genes or gene clusters (sasG, agr II, cap5) among isolates causing infective endocarditis compared to other invasive isolates. In most cases, the presence of virulence genes was linked to clonal complex affiliation. In conclusion, certain S. aureus clonal lineages harboring specific sets of virulence genes seem to be more successful in causing invasive disease."

The contribution of smaller brain size to the IQ and educational disadvantages of EP is unknown. This study aimed (i) to compare brain volumes from multiple brain tissues and structures between EP-born (< 28 weeks) and term-born (≥ 37 weeks) control adolescents, (ii) to explore the relationships of brain tissue volumes with IQ and basic educational skills and whether this differed by group, and (iii) to explore how much total brain tissue volume explains the underperformance of EP adolescents compared with controls.Longitudinal cohort study of 148 EP and 132 term controls born in Victoria, Australia in 1991-92. At age 18, magnetic resonance imaging-determined brain volumes of multiple tissues and structures were calculated. IQ and educational skills were measured using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) and the Wide Range Achievement Test(WRAT-4), respectively.Brain volumes were smaller in EP adolescents compared with controls (mean difference [95% confidence interval] of -5.9% [-8.0, -3.7%] for total brain tissue volume). The largest relative differences were noted in the thalamus and hippocampus. The EP group had lower IQs(-11.9 [-15.4, -8.5]), spelling(-8.0 [-11.5, -4.6]), math computation(-10.3 [-13.7, -6.9]) and word reading(-5.6 [-8.8, -2.4]) scores than controls; all p-values<0.001. Volumes of total brain tissue and other brain tissues and structures correlated positively with IQ and educational skills, a relationship that was similar for both the EP and controls. Total brain tissue volume explained between 20-40% of the IQ and educational outcome differences between EP and controls.EP adolescents had smaller brain volumes, lower IQs and poorer educational performance than controls. Brain volumes of multiple tissues and structures are related to IQ and educational outcomes. Smaller total brain tissue volume is an important contributor to the cognitive and educational underperformance of adolescents born EP."
https://openalex.org/W2044352887,"Laboratory investigations into the amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), have accelerated recently, given the pathogen’s role in causing the global decline and extinction of amphibians. Studies in which host animals were exposed to Bd have largely assumed that lab-maintained pathogen cultures retained the infective and pathogenic properties of wild isolates. Attenuated pathogenicity is common in artificially maintained cultures of other pathogenic fungi, but to date, it is unknown whether, and to what degree, Bd might change in culture. We compared zoospore production over time in two samples of a single Bd isolate having different passage histories: one maintained in artificial media for more than six years (JEL427-P39), and one recently thawed from cryopreserved stock (JEL427-P9). In a common garden experiment, we then exposed two different amphibian species, Eleutherodactylus coqui and Atelopus zeteki, to both cultures to test whether Bd attenuates in pathogenicity with in vitro passages. The culture with the shorter passage history, JEL427-P9, had significantly greater zoospore densities over time compared to JEL427-P39. This difference in zoospore production was associated with a difference in pathogenicity for a susceptible amphibian species, indicating that fecundity may be an important virulence factor for Bd. In the 130-day experiment, Atelopus zeteki frogs exposed to the JEL427-P9 culture experienced higher average infection intensity and 100% mortality, compared with 60% mortality for frogs exposed to JEL427-P39. This effect was not observed with Eleutherodactylus coqui, which was able to clear infection. We hypothesize that the differences in phenotypic performance observed with Atelopus zeteki are rooted in changes of the Bd genome. Future investigations enabled by this study will focus on the underlying mechanisms of Bd pathogenicity."
https://openalex.org/W2073496193,"Background Visfatin is a multifaceted adipokine whose circulating levels are enhanced in different metabolic diseases. Extracellular visfatin can exert various deleterious effects on vascular cells, including inflammation and proliferation. Limited evidence exists, however, on the capacity of human vascular cells to synthesize and release visfatin by themselves, under basal or pro-inflammatory conditions. Methods and Results Intracellular visfatin was detected by Western blot in non-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). However, exposing HUVEC for 18 h to a series of pro-inflammatory stimulus, such as interleukin (IL)-1β (1 to 10 ng/mL), tumor necrosis factor-α (1 to 10 ng/mL) or angiotensin II (10 pmol/L to 1 μmol/L) markedly enhanced intracellular visfatin content. Using IL-1β (10 ng/mL; 18 h), it was determined that the increase in intracellular visfatin, which was paralleled by enhanced visfatin mRNA levels, relied on a signalling mechanism involving both nuclear factor-κB and poly (ADP ribose) polymerase-1 activation. Moreover, IL-1β modified the sub-cellular localization of visfatin; while in non-stimulated HUVEC immunoreactive visfatin predominantly showed an intra-nuclear granular pattern, in IL-1β-inflamed cells an extra-nuclear filamentous staining, co-localising with F-actin fibers and suggesting a secretory pattern, was mainly found. Indeed, IL-1β promoted visfatin secretion, as determined by both ELISA and immunocytochemistry. Conclusions Human endothelial cells synthesize and release visfatin, particularly in response to inflammation. We suggest that the inflamed endothelium can be a source of visfatin, which arises as a local inflammatory mediator and a potential therapeutic target to interfere with vascular inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2073460412,"Recent studies have shown that bone marrow-derived fibroblasts contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the recruitment of bone marrow-derived fibroblasts into the kidney are incompletely understood. Bone marrow-derived fibroblasts express the chemokine receptor - CCR2. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that CCR2 participates in the recruitment of fibroblasts into the kidney during the development of renal fibrosis. Bone marrow-derived collagen-expressing GFP+ fibroblasts were detected in the obstructed kidneys of chimeric mice transplanted with donor bone marrow from collagen α1(I)-GFP reporter mice. These bone marrow-derived fibroblasts expressed PDGFR-β and CCR2. CCR2 knockout mice accumulated significantly fewer bone marrow-derived fibroblast precursors expressing the hematopoietic marker-CD45 and the mesenchymal markers-PDGFR-β or procollagen I in the obstructed kidneys compared with wild-type mice. Furthermore, CCR2 knockout mice displayed fewer bone marrow-derived myofibroblasts and expressed less α-SMA or FSP-1 in the obstructed kidneys compared with wild-type mice. Consistent with these findings, genetic deletion of CCR2 inhibited total collagen deposition and suppressed expression of collagen I and fibronectin. Moreover, genetic deletion of CCR2 inhibits MCP-1 and CXCL16 gene expression associated with a reduction of inflammatory cytokine expression and macrophage infiltration, suggesting a linear interaction between two chemokines/ligand receptors in tubular epithelial cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate that CCR2 signaling plays an important role in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis through regulation of bone marrow-derived fibroblasts.

Mammals express three paralogues: lipins 1, 2, and 3. Loss of lipin 1 in mice inhibits adipogenesis at an early stage of differentiation and results in a lipodystrophic phenotype. The role of lipins at later stages of adipogenesis, when cells initiate the formation of lipid droplets, is less well characterized. We found that depletion of lipin 1, after the initiation of differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells but before the loading of lipid droplets with triacylglycerol, results in a reciprocal increase of lipin 2, but not lipin 3. We generated 3T3-L1 cells where total lipin protein and PAP activity levels are down-regulated by the combined depletion of lipins 1 and 2 at day 4 of differentiation. These cells still accumulated triacylglycerol but displayed a striking fragmentation of lipid droplets without significantly affecting their total volume per cell. This was due to the lack of the PAP activity of lipin 1 in adipocytes after day 4 of differentiation, whereas depletion of lipin 2 led to an increase of lipid droplet volume per cell. We propose that in addition to their roles during early adipogenesis, lipins also have a role in lipid droplet biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1989387587,"Since environmental effects of molecular traits are often questioned we analyze here the molecular effects of cadmium (Cd) on lipid pathways and their effects on tissues development. Lipids are an important energy source for the developing embryo, and accumulate in the ovary and hepatopancreas of decapod crustaceans. The extend of Cd affecting lipid storage and metabolism, is studied here with the freshwater crabs Sinopotamon henanense. Crabs were exposed to water-born Cd at 1.45, 2.9, 5.8 mg/l for 10, 15, and 20 days. With significantly increased Cd accumulation in exposed crabs, lipid content in hepatopancreas and ovary showed a time-dependent and concentration-dependent reduction, being at least one of the reasons for a lower ovarian index (OI) and hepatopancreatic index (HI). After 10-day exposure increased triglyceride (TG) level in hemolymph and up-regulation of pancreatic lipase (PL) activity in the hepatopancreas suggested an increased nutritional lipid uptake. However, two processes led to lower lipid levels upon Cd exposure: an increased utilization of lipids and a down-regulated lipoprotein lipase (LPL) led to insufficient lipid transport. 10-day Cd exposure also triggered the production of β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 2'-phosphate reduced tetrasodium salt hydrate (NADPH), as well as to the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and fatty acids. With increasing exposure time, the crabs at 15 and 20-day exposure contained less lipid and TG, suggesting that more energy was consumed during the exposure time. Meanwhile, the level of NADPH, ATP and the activity of PL, LPL, fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) activity was down-regulated suggesting an impairment of the crab metabolism by Cd in addition to causing a lower lipid level."
https://openalex.org/W1994824666,"Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K) participate in numerous signaling pathways, and control distinct biological functions. Studies using pan-PI3K inhibitors suggest roles for PI3K in osteoclasts, but little is known about specific PI3K isoforms in these cells. Our objective was to determine effects of isoform-selective PI3K inhibitors on osteoclasts. The following inhibitors were investigated (targets in parentheses): wortmannin and LY294002 (pan-p110), PIK75 (α), GDC0941 (α, δ), TGX221 (β), AS252424 (γ), and IC87114 (δ). In addition, we characterized a new potent and selective PI3Kδ inhibitor, GS-9820, and explored roles of PI3K isoforms in regulating osteoclast function. Osteoclasts were isolated from long bones of neonatal rats and rabbits. Wortmannin, LY294002, GDC0941, IC87114, and GS-9820 induced a dramatic retraction of osteoclasts within 15-20 min to 65-75% of the initial area. In contrast, there was no significant retraction in response to vehicle, PIK75, TGX221, or AS252424. Moreover, wortmannin and GS-9820, but not PIK75 or TGX221, disrupted actin belts. We examined effects of PI3K inhibitors on osteoclast survival. Whereas PIK75, TGX221, and GS-9820 had no significant effect on basal survival, all blocked RANKL-stimulated survival. When studied on resorbable substrates, osteoclastic resorption was suppressed by wortmannin and inhibitors of PI3Kβ and PI3Kδ, but not other isoforms. These data are consistent with a critical role for PI3Kδ in regulating osteoclast cytoskeleton and resorptive activity. In contrast, multiple PI3K isoforms contribute to the control of osteoclast survival. Thus, the PI3Kδ isoform, which is predominantly expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin, is an attractive target for anti-resorptive therapeutics."

Here we describe a novel regulatory mechanism affecting RNase R, a 3′ to 5′ exoribonuclease able to act on essentially all RNAs including those with extensive secondary structure. Most RNase R is sequestered on ribosomes in growing cells where it is stable and participates in trans-translation. In contrast, the free form of the enzyme, which is deleterious to cells, is extremely unstable, turning over with a half-life of 2 min. RNase R binding to ribosomes is dependent on transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA)-SmpB, nonstop mRNA, and the modified form of ribosomal protein S12. Degradation of the free form of RNase R also requires tmRNA-SmpB, but this process is independent of ribosomes, indicating two distinct roles for tmRNA-SmpB. Inhibition of RNase R binding to ribosomes leads to slower growth and a massive increase in RNA degradation. These studies indicate a previously unknown role for ribosomes in cellular homeostasis.

https://openalex.org/W2001970096,"Immunosurveillance of tumor cells depends on NKp30, a major activating receptor of human natural killer (NK) cells. The human BCL2-associated athanogene 6 (BAG-6, also known as BAT3; 1126 amino acids) is a cellular ligand of NKp30. To date, little is known about the molecular details of this receptor ligand system. Within the current study, we have located the binding site of NKp30 to a sequence stretch of 250 amino acids in the C-terminal region of BAG-6 (BAG-6(686-936)). BAG-6(686-936) forms a noncovalent dimer of 57-59 kDa, which is sufficient for high affinity interaction with NKp30 (KD < 100 nM). As our most important finding, BAG-6(686-936) inhibits NKp30-dependent signaling, interferon-γ release, and degranulation of NK cells in the presence of malignantly transformed target cells. Based on these data, we show for the first time that BAG-6(686-936) comprises a subdomain of BAG-6, which is sufficient for receptor docking and inhibition of NKp30-dependent NK cell cytotoxicity as part of a tumor immune escape mechanism. These molecular insights provide an access point to restore tumor immunosurveillance by NK cells and to increase the efficacy of cellular therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1978251105,"Class A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are able to form homodimers and/or oligomeric arrays. We recently proposed, based on bioluminescence resonance energy transfer studies with the M3 muscarinic receptor (M3R), a prototypic class A GPCR, that the M3R is able to form multiple, structurally distinct dimers that are probably transient in nature (McMillin, S.

To provide more direct experimental support for this concept, we employed a disulfide cross-linking strategy to trap various M3R dimeric species present in a native lipid environment (transfected COS-7 cells). Disulfide cross-linking studies were carried out with many mutant M3Rs containing single cysteine (Cys) substitutions within two distinct cytoplasmic M3R regions, the C-terminal portion of the second intracellular loop (i2) and helix H8 (H8). The pattern of cross-links that we obtained, in combination with molecular modeling studies, was consistent with the existence of two structurally distinct M3R dimer interfaces, one involving i2/i2 contacts (TM4-TM5-i2 interface) and the other one characterized by H8-H8 interactions (TM1-TM2-H8 interface). Specific H8-H8 disulfide cross-links led to significant impairments in M3R-mediated G protein activation, suggesting that changes in the structural orientation or mobility of H8 are critical for efficient receptor-G protein coupling. Our findings provide novel structural and functional insights into the mechanisms involved in M3R dimerization (oligomerization).

Among the various subclasses of GPCRs, the class A subfamily represents by far the largest subgroup of GPCRs, consisting of ∼670 members in humans (3Lagerström M.C. Schiöth H.B.

Interestingly, a pentameric complex between a rhodopsin dimer and transducin has recently been visualized by transmission electron microscopy single particle reconstructions (12Jastrzebska B.

To better understand how class A GPCRs function at the molecular level, it is essential to identify the structural elements governing the dimerization/oligomerization of this class of receptors. Despite numerous molecular, biochemical, and biophysical studies, many questions remain regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying class A GPCR complex formation. Accumulating evidence suggests that residues located on the “outer” (lipid-facing) surface of the TM helical bundle and various intracellular regions participate in the formation of class A GPCR dimers/oligomers (7Angers S.

However, depending on the specific receptor under investigation, different receptor regions have been implicated in receptor-receptor interactions. As a result, no clear consensus has emerged regarding the relative roles of different TM and extramembranous receptor regions in class A GPCR dimerization. However, such knowledge may prove critical for the development of novel strategies aimed at modulating GPCR dimerization (oligomerization) for therapeutic purposes. For many years, we have used the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M3R) as a model system to investigate different aspects of GPCR function, including the molecular basis of class A GPCR complex formation (for the sake of simplicity, we will refer to receptor dimers and oligomers simply as “receptor dimers” throughout the text). The M3R is a member of the muscarinic receptor family (M1–M5) that preferentially activates G proteins of the Gq family (13Wess J. Molecular biology of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1996; 10: 69-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The existence of M3R dimers has been confirmed by different experimental approaches, including mutant M3R complementation (14Maggio R. Vogel Z. Wess J.

By using a BRET strategy, we recently identified many mutant M3Rs that were impaired in their ability to dimerize (18McMillin S.M. Heusel M. Liu T. Costanzi S. Wess J.

The pattern of mutant receptors exhibiting impaired dimerization, together with molecular modeling studies, suggested the existence of multiple energetically favorable M3R dimers endowed with different geometries. Moreover, our data were in good agreement with a model in which these structurally distinct M3R dimers exist in a dynamic equilibrium (18McMillin S.M. Heusel M. Liu T. Costanzi S. Wess J.

In the present study, we used a disulfide cross-linking strategy to provide additional experimental support for the existence of multiple M3R-M3R interfaces and to further define the receptor regions involved in M3R dimerization. Previous studies examining the molecular basis of class A GPCR dimerization have focused primarily on the role of different TM helices in receptor-receptor interactions. In contrast, in the present study, we tested the potential proximity of two intracellular receptor regions in different M3R dimeric species. These regions were the C-terminal portion of the second intracellular loop (i2 loop) where it links to TM4, and helix 8 (H8), the intracellular helix that follows TM7 (Fig. 1). The primary reason for targeting these two intracellular domains was the outcome of the BRET study by McMillin et al. (18McMillin S.M. Heusel M. Liu T. Costanzi S. Wess J. Structural basis of M3 muscarinic receptor dimer/oligomer formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 28584-28598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this study, we predicted the existence of an M3R dimer, which contains an H8-H8 interface and another dimeric species where the two i2 loops of two M3R protomers are located within close proximity of each other. We systematically subjected residues located with the C-terminal portion of the i2 loop (residues Arg176-Thr180) and H8 (residues Lys548–Thr556) of the M3R to cysteine (Cys) substitution mutagenesis, resulting in 14 mutant M3Rs containing singly Cys residues on the intracellular M3R surface (Fig. 1). To explore the possibility that the targeted sites face each other in an M3R complex, we monitored the ability of the different receptor constructs to undergo cross-link formation (under oxidizing conditions). Importantly, these studies were carried out with receptors being present in a native membrane environment (membranes prepared from transfected COS-7 cells). The cross-linking data that we obtained, combined with molecular modeling studies, provide strong experimental support for the existence of multiple M3R dimers or M3R-M3R interfaces. We also noted that agonist treatment of receptor-expressing cells promoted the proximity of residues located within H8 in an M3R complex that was characterized by an H8-H8 interface. Functional data suggested that this conformational change is required for productive receptor-G protein coupling. The present study provides novel information about the structure and function of M3R dimers. Class A GPCRs share a high degree of structural and functional homology. For this reason, the outcome of the present study should be of broad general relevance. Carbamylcholine chloride (carbachol), atropine sulfate, cupric sulfate (CuSO4), 1,10-phenanthroline, and N-ethylmaleimide were obtained from Sigma.

The M3′(3C)-Xa construct lacks most endogenous Cys residues (except for Cys140, Cys220, and Cys532), all five N-glycosylation sites contained within the extracellular N-terminal domain, and the central portion of the third intracellular loop (Ala274–Lys469; this sequence was replaced with two adjacent factor Xa cleavage sites). Single Cys residues were introduced at specific sites of the M3′(3C)-Xa receptor by using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The entire coding sequences of all mutant M3Rs were sequenced to exclude the presence of any unwanted mutations. All receptor constructs were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, as described in detail previously (20Li J.H. Han S.J. Hamdan F.F. Kim S.K. Jacobson K.A. Bloodworth L.M. Zhang X. Wess J.

Transfected cells were incubated with 1 μm atropine for the last 24 h of culture, to obtain higher receptor densities.

In brief, binding reactions containing ∼10 μg of membrane protein per tube were carried out for 2 h (22 °C) in 1 ml of binding buffer containing 25 mm sodium phosphate and 5 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.4). In saturation binding assays, we employed six different [3H]NMS concentrations (200 to 7,000 pm). [3H]NMS is a hydrophilic, plasma membrane-impermeable muscarinic antagonist. When we used intact cells in the past, we detected similar numbers of [3H]NMS binding sites as compared with whole cell membrane preparations, indicating that [3H]NMS primarily labels cell surface receptors. 3J. Wess, unpublished data. In competition binding assays, we used a fixed concentration of [3H]NMS (500 pm) in the presence of 10 different concentrations of carbachol, the cold competitor. Nonspecific binding was defined as binding observed in the presence of 10 μm atropine. Binding reactions were terminated by rapid filtration over GF/C Brandel filters, followed by three washes (∼4 ml/wash) with ice-cold distilled water. The amount of radioactivity that remained bound to the filters was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Binding data were analyzed by using the nonlinear curve-fitting program Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). To determine whether the different mutant M3Rs retained the ability to couple to G proteins, we studied their ability to mediate agonist-dependent stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Assays were carried out as described in detail previously (20Li J.H. Han S.J. Hamdan F.F. Kim S.K. Jacobson K.A. Bloodworth L.M. Zhang X. Wess J.

In brief, transfected COS-7 cells were split into 12-well plates 24 h after transfection and labeled with myo-[3H]inositol. Assays were carried out by incubating receptor-expressing cells with increasing concentrations of the muscarinic agonist carbachol. Data were analyzed using the nonlinear curve-fitting program Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Disulfide cross-linking studies were carried out as described in detail previously (16Hu J.

In brief, receptor-containing COS-7 cell membranes were incubated with the oxidizing agent, CuPhen (100 μm). Reactions were carried out for 10 min either at room temperature (23 °C) or at 37 °C and then terminated by the addition of EDTA and N-ethylmaleimide (10 mm each), followed by a 10-min incubation on ice. Membrane proteins were then solubilized by incubating samples with 1.2% digitonin (Roche Applied Science) and used either directly for SDS-PAGE or stored at −70 °C until use. Immunoblotting experiments were carried out using published protocols (16Hu J. Thor D. Zhou Y. Liu T. Wang Y. McMillin S.M. Mistry R. Challiss R.A. Costanzi S. Wess J.

In brief, samples containing 20 μg of solubilized membrane protein were incubated with Laemmli loading buffer (30 min at 37 °C) under non-reducing conditions and then loaded onto 10% Tris glycine polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) and run at 135 V in the presence of 0.1% SDS. Immunoblots were probed with a rabbit anti-M3R polyclonal antibody directed against the C-terminal 18 amino acids of the rat M3R (16Hu J. Thor D. Zhou Y. Liu T. Wang Y. McMillin S.M. Mistry R.

In brief, we first generated modified versions of selected Cys-substituted M3R constructs in which the C-terminal recognition sequence for the anti-M3R antibody was replaced with a FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK). COS-7 cells were then co-transfected with the non-tagged and FLAG-tagged version of the same mutant M3R. After treatment of COS-7 cell membranes for 10 min with CuPhen (100 μm), solubilized membrane proteins (∼600 μg) were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with either the anti-M3R antibody or an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ). After this step, 30 μl of protein A-agarose (anti-M3R antibody) or protein A/G-agarose (anti-FLAG antibody) were added, followed by an additional incubation period of 1 h at 4 °C. Bound immunoreactive proteins were eluted and immunoblotting studies were performed with the monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody or the polyclonal anti-M3R antibody, as described in detail previously (16Hu J.

To determine the effect of M3R cross-linking on the efficiency of receptor-G protein coupling, we followed the protocol described by Akam et al. (21Akam E.C. Challiss R.A. Nahorski S.R.

In brief, membranes from COS-7 cells expressing different Cys-substituted mutant M3R constructs were first treated with CuPhen (100 μm; 10 min at 37 °C). Control samples were incubated under the same experimental conditions in the absence of CuPhen. Subsequently, receptor-containing membranes (75 μg of protein) were incubated with the muscarinic agonist, carbachol (1 mm) for 2 min at 30 °C in the presence of 1 nm [35S]GTPγS.

Briefly, the dimer models were built through a systematic revolution of one monomer (the “mobile” monomer) around the other monomer, combined with rotations of the mobile monomer around its axis. Revolution and rotations were performed with increments of 10°. At each revolution step, before the mobile monomer advanced to the next step, a complete rotation of the mobile monomer around its axis was performed. For each rotational step, the two monomers were arranged at a distance that ensured minimum van der Waals energy, calculated according to the OPLS2005 force field. The process was continued until the mobile monomer completed an entire revolution around the other, leading to a total of 1,296 systematically built dimer models. A modified version of the rat M3R lacking most native Cys residues (M3′(3C)-Xa) served as a template for Cys substitution mutagenesis (Fig. 1). The M3′(3C)-Xa construct displays similar ligand binding and G protein coupling properties as the wild-type (WT) M3R, as reported previously (19Zeng"
https://openalex.org/W2120001299,"During the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS), glucuronyl C5-epimerase (Hsepi) catalyzes C5-epimerization of glucuronic acid (GlcA), converting it to iduronic acid (IdoA). Because HS 2-O-sulfotransferase (Hs2st) shows a strong substrate preference for IdoA over GlcA, C5-epimerization is required for normal HS sulfation. However, the physiological significance of C5-epimerization remains elusive. To understand the role of Hsepi in development, we isolated Drosophila Hsepi mutants. Homozygous mutants are viable and fertile with only minor morphological defects, including the formation of an ectopic crossvein in the wing, but they have a short lifespan. We propose that two mechanisms contribute to the mild phenotypes of Hsepi mutants: HS sulfation compensation and possible developmental roles of 2-O-sulfated GlcA (GlcA2S). HS disaccharide analysis showed that loss of Hsepi resulted in a significant impairment of 2-O-sulfation and induced compensatory increases in N- and 6-O-sulfation. Simultaneous block of Hsepi and HS 6-O-sulfotransferase (Hs6st) activity disrupted tracheoblast formation, a well established FGF-dependent process. This result suggests that the increase in 6-O-sulfation in Hsepi mutants is critical for the rescue of FGF signaling. We also found that the ectopic crossvein phenotype can be induced by expression of a mutant form of Hs2st with a strong substrate preference for GlcA-containing units, suggesting that this phenotype is associated with abnormal GlcA 2-O-sulfation. Finally, we show that Hsepi formed a complex with Hs2st and Hs6st in S2 cells, raising the possibility that this complex formation contributes to the close functional relationships between these enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2016790127,"Resource limitation during the juvenile stages frequently results in developmental delays and reduced size at maturity, and dietary restriction during adulthood can affect longevity and reproductive output. Variation in food intake can also result in alteration to the normal pattern of resource allocation among body parts or life-history stages. My primary aim in this study was to determine how varying juvenile and/or adult feeding regimes affect particular female and male traits in the sexually cannibalistic praying mantid Pseudomantis albofimbriata. Praying mantids are sit-and-wait predators whose resource intake can vary dramatically depending on environmental conditions within and across seasons, making them useful for studying the effects of feeding regime on various facets of reproductive fitness. In this study, there was a significant trend/difference in development and morphology for males and females as a result of juvenile feeding treatment, however, its effect on the fitness components measured for males was much greater than on those measured for females. Food-limited males were less likely to find a female during field enclosure experiments and smaller males were slower at finding a female in field-based experiments, providing some of the first empirical evidence of a large male size advantage for scrambling males. Only adult food limitation affected female fecundity, and the ability of a female to chemically attract males was also most notably affected by adult feeding regime (although juvenile food limitation did play a role). Furthermore, the significant difference/trend in all male traits and the lack of difference in male trait ratios between treatments suggests a proportional distribution of resources and, therefore, no trait conservation by food-limited males. This study provides evidence that males and females are under different selective pressures with respect to resource acquisition and is also one of very few to show an effect of juvenile food quantity on adult reproductive fitness in a hemimetabolous insect."
https://openalex.org/W2130955128,"To clarify the potential utility of targeting GRK2/3-mediated desensitization as a means of manipulating airway smooth muscle (ASM) contractile state, we assessed the specificity of GRK2/3 regulation of procontractile and relaxant G-protein-coupled receptors in ASM. Functional domains of GRK2/3 were stably expressed, or siRNA-mediated GRK2/3 knockdown was performed, in human ASM cultures, and agonist-induced signaling was assessed. Regulation of contraction of murine tracheal rings expressing GRK2 C terminus was also assessed. GRK2/3 knockdown or expression of the GRK2 C terminus caused a significant (~30–90%) increase in maximal β-agonist and histamine [phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis] signaling, without affecting the calculated EC50. GRK2 C-terminal expression did not affect signaling by methacholine, thrombin, or LTD4. Expression of the GRK2 N terminus or kinase-dead holo-GRK2 diminished (~30–70%) both PI hydrolysis and Ca2+ mobilization by every Gq-coupled receptor examined. Under conditions of GRK2 C-terminal expression, β-agonist inhibition of methacholine-stimulated PI hydrolysis was greater. Finally, transgenic expression of the GRK2 C terminus in murine ASM enabled ~30–50% greater β-agonist-mediated relaxation of methacholine-induced contraction. Collectively these data demonstrate the relative selectivity of GRKs for the β2AR in ASM and the ability to exploit GRK2/3 functional domains to render ASM hyporesponsive to contractile agents while increasing responsiveness to bronchodilating β-agonist.—Deshpande, D.

https://openalex.org/W2090227503,"Despite intensive research efforts and therapeutic advances over the last few decades, the pediatric neural crest tumor, neuroblastoma, continues to be responsible for over 15% of pediatric cancer deaths. Novel therapeutic options are needed for this tumor. Recently, investigators have shown that mice with syngeneic murine gliomas treated with an engineered, neuroattenuated oncolytic herpes simplex virus-1 (oHSV), M002, had a significant increase in survival. M002 has deletions in both copies of the γ 1 34.5 gene, enabling replication in tumor cells but precluding infection of normal neural cells. We hypothesized that M002 would also be effective in the neural crest tumor, neuroblastoma. We showed that M002 infected, replicated, and decreased survival in neuroblastoma cell lines. In addition, we showed that in murine xenografts, treatment with M002 significantly decreased tumor growth, and that this effect was augmented with the addition of ionizing radiation. Importantly, survival could be increased by subsequent doses of radiation without re-dosing of the virus. Finally, these studies showed that the primary entry protein for oHSV, CD111 was expressed by numerous neuroblastoma cell lines and was also present in human neuroblastoma specimens. We concluded that M002 effectively targeted neuroblastoma and that this oHSV may have potential for use in children with unresponsive or relapsed neuroblastoma."

A primary mechanism for increasing synaptic strength is the trafficking of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) into the postsynapse, a process mediated by GluA1 AMPAR subunit phosphorylation. We have examined the role of converging glutamate and dopamine inputs in regulating biochemical cascades upstream of GluA1 phosphorylation. We focused on the role of Ca2+-permeable AMPARs (CPARs), which lack the GluA2 AMPAR subunit. Under conditions that prevented depolarization, stimulation of CPARs activated neuronal nitric oxide synthase and production of cGMP. CPAR-dependent cGMP production was sufficient to induce synaptic insertion of GluA1, detected by confocal microscopy, through a mechanism dependent on GluA1 Ser-845 phosphorylation.

Simultaneous activation of dopamine D1 receptors and CPARs induced additive increases in GluA1 membrane insertion, but only CPAR stimulation augmented CPAR-dependent GluA1 synaptic insertion. This incorporation into the synapse proceeded through a sequential two-step mechanism; that is, cGMP-dependent protein kinase II facilitated membrane insertion and/or retention, and protein kinase C activity was necessary for synaptic insertion.

CMV-Sp-CD4 was detected by co-expression of CD25/CD134 by flow cytometry after CMV-antigen stimulation.All subjects were CMV sero-positive, 4 had quantifiable CMV-DNA (range 2.3-3.9 log10 copies/mL) at baseline but none had clinically apparent CMV-disease. Baseline CMV-Sp-CD4 response was positive in 40 subjects. Those with CD4 T cell count < 100 cells/µL were less likely to have positive baseline CMV-Sp-CD4 response (P=0.003). Positive baseline CMV-Sp-CD4 response was associated with reduced odds of quantifiable CMV-DNA (P=0.022). Mean CD4 T cell increase at week 96 was 213 cells/µL. This was associated positively with baseline HIV-VL (P=0.001) and negatively with age (P=0.003). The frequency of CMV-Sp-CD4 increased at week 4 (P=0.008), then declined. Those with lower baseline CMV-Sp-CD4 (P=0.009) or CDC category C (P<0.001) had greater increases in CMV-Sp-CD4 at week 4. At week 96, CD4 T cell count was positively (P<0.001) and the frequency of CMV-Sp-CD4 was negatively (P=0.001) associated with the percentage of naïve CD4 T cells.Increases in CMV-Sp-CD4 with ART occurred early and were greater in those with more advanced immunodeficiency.

Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T. An open and closed case for all polymerases.Structure. 1999; 7: R31-R35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). These large motions are also accompanied by smaller reorganizations of key residues during establishment of the pre-catalytic state, and these changes are expected to occur in a specific order during faithful replication of DNA. Discrimination between cognate and noncognate base pairs at the polymerase active site occurs with major contributions at the level of affinity (Kd) and secondarily at the level of nucleotidyl transfer (kpol), although the latter may include steps other than those directly related to catalysis. The induced-fit paradigm for substrate or ligand recognition by proteins has long been employed to describe the mechanisms of catalysis or modes of functional inhibition by small molecules. In the case of DNA polymerases, concerted large and small conformational events are observed upon binding dNTP. It was hypothesized from the early polymerase structures that the large domain movements accompanying dNTP binding (or during product release) could be the rate-limiting step (1Doublié S. Sawaya M.R.

The development of fluorescence-based techniques to observe conformation independent of the chemical reaction suggested that structural changes occurred in at least two discernable phases after nucleotide binding and that the later phase was rate-limiting for correct nucleotide incorporation (4Frey M.W.

Upon binding the DNA duplex, the fingers domain cycles between conformations during incorporation of dNTPs, with few published examples of a fingers domain closing on a mismatched base pair in the absence of a damaged base (16Batra V.K.

Molecular dynamics simulations have shown that in pol β the induced-fit model (18Schlick T. Arora K. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H.

Acc. 2012; 131: 1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) is a multistep process that includes gross changes (domain movements) that are likely the measurable component described above, and subsequent minute changes (side chain conformations after or in conjunction with metal ion binding) that may be considerably slower and not observable in previous fluorescence measurements (19Yang L.

The E295K variant of pol β was first identified in a gastric carcinoma and subsequently found by us in a colon carcinoma (21Iwanaga A. Ouchida M. Miyazaki K. Hori K. Mukai T.

Human POLB gene is mutated in high percentage of colorectal tumors.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 23830-23839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Expression of the E295K variant in mouse mammary epithelial cells induces sister chromatid exchanges and cellular transformation (23Lang T. Dalal S. Chikova A. DiMaio D. Sweasy J.B. The E295K DNA polymerase β gastric cancer-associated variant interferes with base excision repair and induces cellular transformation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 5587-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The mutation lies within the fingers domain of the enzyme proximal to the template strand near the nucleotide-binding pocket. Although E295K possesses significantly reduced polymerase activity, it binds to DNA with an affinity similar to that of wild-type (WT) pol β and has normal 5′-deoxyribose phosphate lyase activity (23Lang T. Dalal S. Chikova A. DiMaio D. Sweasy J.B. The E295K DNA polymerase β gastric cancer-associated variant interferes with base excision repair and induces cellular transformation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 5587-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). E295K is unable to support base excision repair of hypoxanthine and is unable to restore resistance to methylmethane sulfonate in mouse embryo fibroblasts depleted of pol β. In fact, E295K appears to compete with WT pol β for binding to single nucleotide gaps (23Lang T. Dalal S. Chikova A. DiMaio D. Sweasy J.B. The E295K DNA polymerase β gastric cancer-associated variant interferes with base excision repair and induces cellular transformation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 5587-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Accumulation of base excision repair intermediates in cells expressing E295K is likely due to its ability to bind to single nucleotide gaps in place of WT pol β. Because E295K has very low polymerase activity, fewer gaps are filled, resulting in double strand breaks upon collision with the replication fork. This leads to genomic instability and cellular transformation. Here, we structurally demonstrate that, for the E295K variant, the conformational change of the fingers domain is observed only under noncognate conditions, with a nearly closed conformation achieved for the dA:dCTP mismatch. Similarly, NMR studies of this variant previously reported no conformational event under dT:dATP cognate conditions (24Kirby T.W. DeRose E.F. Cavanaugh N.A. Beard W.A. Shock D.D. Mueller G.A. Wilson S.H. London R.E. Metal-induced DNA translocation leads to DNA polymerase conformational activation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: 2974-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The dUMPNPP or dTTP cognate complexes reported here support those initial findings. We show that dCTP inhibits incorporation of the cognate dTTP through equivalent binding affinity but not through increased incorporation of the nucleotide into the DNA. The conformation of residues in the active site is distinct from a cognate base pair complex but shares attributes with those of other mismatches obtained with WT pol β, suggesting that the ground state for the E295K variant is that of a mismatch binding mode. Untagged wild-type (WT) human pol β was subcloned into a modified pET28a vector. The E295K variant was generated using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the WT plasmid followed by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Both WT and E295K plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli Rosetta 2 DE3 (Novagen) and grown in Luria broth (LB). Expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 10 ml of Buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT), plus EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) followed by five rounds of sonication for 30 s each. The soluble fraction was then separated by centrifugation at 19,800 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The sample was passed through a 0.45-μm filter prior to being loaded onto a Hi-Trap heparin (GE Healthcare) column. The protein preparation was separated by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) with a NaCl gradient by mixing Buffer A with Buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT). Fractions containing pol β were subsequently concentrated using centrifugation (Amicon Ultra-15, Millipore) and diluted in Buffer A for further purification by FLPC using a HiTrap SP column (GE Healthcare). Protein fractions were pooled and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining for purity greater than 95%. The samples were concentrated using centrifugation and flash frozen in the presence of 15% glycerol for long term storage (−80 °C). The one-base gapped DNA substrate used for characterization of nucleotide incorporation by pol β is similar to that described in published work (25Berlow R.B. Swain M. Dalal S. Sweasy J.B. Loria J.P.

Crystal structures of human DNA polymerase β complexed with gapped and nicked DNA: evidence for an induced fit mechanism.Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The DNA substrate was created using three separate oligodeoxynucleotides (Keck Oligo Synthesis Resource, Yale University) that were purified on a reverse phase cartridge. Two oligonucleotides (5′- 32P-10-mer primer and 5′-PO4-5-mer downstream) were annealed to the complementary 16-mer template. Oligonucleotides were heated at 95 °C for 10 min, cooled to 23 °C for 60 min, held at 23 °C for 70 min, and then cooled for 1 h at 4 °C. Single-turnover kinetics experiments of WT and E295K were performed at 23 °C in the same buffer used for the crystallographic studies (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 200 mm sodium acetate, pH 9, 14% (w/v) PEG 3350). Experiments with WT pol β characterizing correct insertion of nucleotide opposite template A were carried out on a KinTek RQF-3 Rapid Chemical Quench Flow apparatus. The amount of pol β used for single-turnover experiments was determined by primer extension assay where 50 nm DNA substrate, 10 mm dTTP (correct), and various concentrations of E295K were used. The optimal ratio was determined to be 50:1, protein to DNA. Therefore, 2500 nm of pol β was used in the single-turnover experiments along with 50 nm single-base gapped DNA and various concentrations of dNTP at different times, typically between 60 s and 2 h. Experiments with E295K were conducted manually and required up to 2 h to observe primer extension with correct nucleotide, and up to 96 h with incorrect nucleotide. Nucleotide concentrations varied from 0 to 2,000 μm with WT pol β and 0 to 20,000 μm for E295K. All reactions were quenched with 0.25 m EDTA, and products were separated on a polyacrylamide sequencing gel. Radioactive products were observed with Storm 860 phosphorimager and quantified by ImageQuant software. Data were fitted using Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc) to the single exponential Equation 1 below, [product]=A(1-e-kobst)(Eq. 1) where kobs is the observed rate constant at each concentration of dNTP. Collectively, kobs is plotted against concentration of dNTP and fit to the hyperbolic Equation 2, kobs=kpol[dNTP]Kd[dNTP]+[dNTP](Eq. 2) where kpol is the maximum rate of polymerization, and Kd(dNTP) represents the equilibrium dissociation constant for nucleotide. E295K competition assay was performed at 23 °C in the same buffer used for crystallographic studies and the single-turnover kinetics assay. Both dTTP and dCTP were present in the reaction mixture with a total nucleotide concentration of 10,000 μm. The experiment was conducted manually for up to 1 h and quenched with EDTA after each time point. Radioactive products were separated on a polyacrylamide sequencing gel and quantified using the method described above. Binary complexes of pol β bound to a single nucleotide gapped DNA duplex substrate were similarly prepared as described in Ref. 27Batra V.K. Beard W.A. Shock D.D. Krahn J.M. Pedersen L.C. Wilson S.H.

The oligonucleotides used for crystallization were synthesized by Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX), PAGE-purified, and mixed in a 1:1:1 ratio. Annealing was performed by heating to 95 °C for 10 min, cooling to room temperature, and then placing on ice for 10 min prior to use. The crystallization reservoir contained 12–16% (w/v) PEG 3350 with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 150–300 mm sodium acetate, and crystals were grown at 18 °C. Cryoprotection was achieved by increasing the final PEG 3350 concentration to 20% with addition of 14% ethylene glycol. Ternary complexes containing natural nucleotides were produced by soaking crystals for ∼15 min at 18 °C in cryoprotection solution containing 2 mm dNTP and 20 mm MgCl2. Crystals soaked with the nonhydrolyzable analog dUMPNPP were soaked at 2 mm nucleotide for 2 h. Crystals were flash cooled in liquid nitrogen and collected on a Rigaku RUH-3R rotating anode system utilizing a Mar345 (Marresearch GmbH) image plate. Crystallographic data were processed with HKL2000 (28Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). The binary complex for E295K was solved by isomorphous replacement using a WT binary model (PDB code 3ISB (29Beard W.A. Shock D.D. Batra V.K. Pedersen L.C. Wilson S.H.

The ternary complexes of E295K with dTTP, dATP, or dUMPNPP were solved by isomorphous replacement with the E295K binary complex (Cross R 17:11% on intensities/amplitudes, 29:19%, and 32:22%, respectively). The E295K ternary complex with dCTP was solved by molecular replacement using Phaser (31McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J.

Wilson S.H. Structure and mechanism of DNA polymerase β.Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 361-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). A preliminary model was achieved (R-factor of 42%) from the molecular replacement solution with translation function Z-score of 30.1 and included the palm domain (Z-score 11.3), lyase domain (Z-score 25.6), thumb domain (Z-score 45.3), and the first 8 bp of DNA duplex (Z-score 12.8). All initial stages of model building were performed in the absence of the fingers domain to reduce model bias. As expected for the E295K mutation, disorder is observed for the fingers domain with weak composite omit electron density but adequate residual map prior to model building. Only the binary and dUMPNPP data sets showed unambiguous electron density for the Lys-295 side chain. Away from the active site, the template strand backbone proved difficult to refine due to flexibility at the phosphodiester linkage between positions T(−2) and T(−3), specially for the dUMPNPP structure. This position juxtaposes Tyr-296 and Lys-295 in differing orientations depending on fingers domain conformation. Models were built using Coot (34Emsley P. Cowtan K.

To characterize the biochemical properties of E295K, single-turnover kinetics experiments were performed. The data show that E295K is unusual in that it has a higher affinity for incorrect versus correct dNTP. At the level of Kd(dNTP), E295K has a 260-fold loss in discrimination compared with WT. Discrimination between correct (dTTP) and incorrect (dCTP) incorporation for E295K occurs at the level of kpol, as shown in Table 1. The rate of polymerization for E295K was determined to be 220 times slower for correct incorporation and 1,300-fold slower for incorrect incorporation compared with WT. E295K is 43 times less faithful than WT and is more likely to select incorrect over correct dNTP substrate compared with WT. A similar effect was reported by another group with E295A where a significant increase in the Kd value for cognate base pairs, particularly A:T and T:A, resulted in reduced fidelity for the enzyme (37Kraynov V.S. Showalter A.K. Liu J. Zhong X. Tsai M.D. DNA polymerase β: contributions of template-positioning and dNTP triphosphate-binding residues to catalysis and fidelity.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16008-16015Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Addition of incorrect (dCTP) dNTP to the reaction for E295K results in inhibition of the primer extension activity (Fig. 1). This finding suggests that E295K preferentially binds to incorrect dCTP over correct dTTP. Taken together, these results hinted at possible structural changes within the active site of E295K leading to the binding of the incorrect dCTP, rather than correct dTTP.TABLE 1Single-turnover kinetics at 23 °C for WT and E295K pol β on the one-base gapped DNA 3C2MA (27Batra V.K.

However, the mechanisms underlying cytokine secretion from platelets are undefined. The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) regulates actin polymerization in nucleated hematopoietic cells but has other role(s) in platelets. WASp-null (WASp(-/-)) platelets stimulated with a PAR-4 receptor agonist had increased TGF-β1 release compared with WT platelets; inhibiting WASp function with wiskostatin augmented TRAP-induced TGF-β1 release in human platelets. TGF-β1 release is dissociated from α-granule secretion (P-selectin up-regulation) and occurs more gradually, with ∼10-15% released after 30-60 min. Blockade of Src family kinase-mediated WASp Tyr-291/Tyr-293 phosphorylation increased TGF-β1 release, with no additive effect in WASp(-/-) platelets, signifying that phosphorylation is critical for WASp-limited TGF-β1 secretion. Inhibiting F-actin assembly with cytochalasin D enhanced secretion in WT platelets and further increased TGF-β1 release in WASp(-/-) platelets, indicating that WASp and actin assembly independently regulate TGF-β1 release. A permeabilized platelet model was used to test the role of upstream small GTPases in TGF-β1 release. N17Cdc42, but not Rac1 mutants, increased TGF-β1 secretion and abrogated WASp phosphorylation. We conclude that WASp function restricts TGF-β1 secretion in a Cdc42- and Src family kinase-dependent manner and independently of actin assembly."

https://openalex.org/W2021004572,"Long-term exposure to cigarette smoke (CS) can have deleterious effects on lung epithelial cells including cell death and the initiation of inflammatory responses. CS-induced cell injury can elaborate cell surface signals and cellular byproducts that stimulate immune system surveillance. Our previous work has shown that the expression of ligands for the cytotoxic lymphocyte activating receptor NKG2D is enhanced in patients with COPD and that the induction of these ligands in a mouse model can replicate COPD pathologies. Here, we extend these findings to demonstrate a role for the NKG2D receptor in CS-induced pathophysiology and provide evidence linking nucleic acid-sensing endosomal toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling to COPD pathology through NKG2D activation. Specifically, we show that mice deficient in NKG2D exhibit attenuated pulmonary inflammation and airspace enlargement in a model of CS-induced emphysema. Additionally, we show that CS exposure induces the release of free nucleic acids in the bronchoalveolar lavage and that direct exposure of mouse lung epithelial cells to cigarette smoke extract similarly induces functional nucleic acids as assessed by TLR3, 7, and 9 reporter cell lines. We demonstrate that exposure of mouse lung epithelial cells to TLR ligands stimulates the surface expression of RAET1, a ligand for NKG2D, and that mice deficient in TLR3/7/9 receptor signaling do not exhibit CS-induced NK cell hyperresponsiveness and airspace enlargement. The findings indicate that CS-induced airway injury stimulates TLR signaling by endogenous nucleic acids leading to elevated NKG2D ligand expression. Activation of these pathways plays a major role in the altered NK cell function, pulmonary inflammation and remodeling related to long-term CS exposure."

Our present study indicates that Cdc7 also regulates SM maturation. Knockdown of Cdc7 suppresses TGF-β-induced expression of SM myosin heavy chain, a late marker of SM differentiation. Cdc7 overexpression, on the other hand, enhances SM myosin heavy chain expression. Interestingly, Cdc7 activates the mRNA expression and promoter activity of myocardin (Myocd), a master regulator of SM differentiation, whose transcription is blocked in the initial phase of the differentiation because TGF-β does not induce Myocd mRNA until after the early SM markers are induced. These data suggest that Cdc7 mediates TGF-β-induced SM maturation via activation of Myocd transcription. Mechanistically, Cdc7 physically and functionally interacts with Nkx2.5 to regulate Myocd promoter activity. Cdc7 appears to enhance Nkx2.5 binding to Myocd promoter, leading to Myocd activation.

https://openalex.org/W2078211561,"The bonga shad, Ethmalosa fimbriata, is a West African pelagic species still abundant in most habitats of its distribution range and thought to be only recently affected by anthropogenic pressure (habitat destruction or fishing pressure). Its presence in a wide range of coastal habitats characterised by different hydrodynamic processes, represents a case study useful for evaluating the importance of physical structure of the west African shoreline on the genetic structure of a small pelagic species. To investigate this question, the genetic diversity of E. fimbriata was assessed at both regional and species range scales, using mitochondrial (mt) and nuclear DNA markers. Whereas only three panmictic units were identified with mtDNA at the large spatial scale, nuclear genetic markers (EPIC: exon-primed intron-crossing) indicated a more complex genetic pattern at the regional scale. In the northern-most section of shad’s distribution range, up to 4 distinct units were identified. Bayesian inference as well as spatial autocorrelation methods provided evidence that gene flow is impeded by the presence of deep-water areas near the coastline (restricting the width of the coastal shelf), such as the Cap Timiris and the Kayar canyons in Mauritania and Senegal, respectively. The added discriminatory power provided by the use of EPIC markers proved to be essential to detect the influence of more subtle, contemporary processes (e.g. gene flow, barriers, etc.) acting within the glacial refuges identified previously by mtDNA."

However, the role of sPLA₂-IIA in neuroinflammation is more complicated and remains unclear yet. In the present study, we investigated the effect of sPLA₂-IIA inhibition by specific inhibitor SC-215 on the inflammation in LPS-induced mice cerebral cortex and primary astrocytes. Our results showed that the inhibition of sPLA₂-IIA alleviated the release of PGE₂ by suppressing the activation of ERK1/2, cPLA₂α, COX-2 and mPGES-1. These findings demonstrated that sPLA₂-IIA showed the potential to regulate the neuroinflammation in vivo and in vitro, indicating that sPLA₂-IIA might be a novel target for the treatment of acute neuroinflammation."

We previously reported that the axon guidance molecules EphA4 and EphB2 have largely complementary expression patterns in the developing avian VIIIth nerve. Here, we tested whether inhibition of Eph signaling alters central targeting of VIIIth nerve axons. We first identified the central compartments through which auditory and vestibular axons travel. We then manipulated Eph-ephrin signaling using pharmacological inhibition of Eph receptors and in ovo electroporation to misexpress EphA4 and EphB2. Anterograde labeling of auditory afferents showed that inhibition of Eph signaling did not misroute axons to non-auditory target regions. Similarly, we did not find vestibular axons within auditory projection regions. However, we found that pharmacologic inhibition of Eph receptors reduced the volume of the vestibular projection compartment. Inhibition of EphB signaling alone did not affect auditory or vestibular central projection volumes, but it significantly increased the area of the auditory sensory epithelium. Misexpression of EphA4 and EphB2 in VIIIth nerve axons resulted in a significant shift of dorsoventral spacing between the axon tracts, suggesting a cell-autonomous role for the partitioning of projection areas along this axis. Cochlear ganglion volumes did not differ among treatment groups, indicating the changes seen were not due to a gain or loss of cochlear ganglion cells. These results suggest that Eph-ephrin signaling does not specify auditory versus vestibular targets but rather contributes to formation of boundaries for patterning of inner ear projections in the hindbrain."

https://openalex.org/W2134590280,"Synovial sarcoma is a relatively rare high-grade soft tissue sarcoma that often develops in the limbs of young people and induces the lung and the lymph node metastasis resulting in poor prognosis. In patients with synovial sarcoma, specific chromosomal translocation of t(X; 18) (p11.2;q11.2) is observed, and SS18-SSX fusion protein expressed by this translocation is reported to be associated with pathogenesis. However, role of the fusion protein in the pathogenesis of synovial sarcoma has not yet been completely clarified. In this study, we focused on the localization patterns of SS18-SSX fusion protein. We constructed expression plasmids coding for the full length SS18-SSX, the truncated SS18 moiety (tSS18) and the truncated SSX moiety (tSSX) of SS18-SSX, tagged with fluorescent proteins. These plasmids were transfected in synovial sarcoma SYO-1 cells and we observed the expression of these proteins using a fluorescence microscope. The SS18-SSX fusion protein showed a characteristic speckle pattern in the nucleus. However, when SS18-SSX was co-expressed with tSSX, localization of SS18-SSX changed from speckle patterns to the diffused pattern similar to the localization pattern of tSSX and SSX. Furthermore, cell proliferation and colony formation of synovial sarcoma SYO-1 and YaFuSS cells were suppressed by exogenous tSSX expression. Our results suggest that the characteristic speckle localization pattern of SS18-SSX is strongly involved in the tumorigenesis through the SSX moiety of the SS18-SSX fusion protein. These findings could be applied to further understand the pathogenic mechanisms, and towards the development of molecular targeting approach for synovial sarcoma."
https://openalex.org/W2064587665,"The development of an independent blood supply by a tumor is essential for maintaining growth beyond a certain limited size and for providing a portal for metastatic dissemination. Host-derived endothelial cells (ECs) residing in and compromising the tumor vasculature originate via distinct processes known as sprouting angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. More recently ECs originating directly from the tumor cells themselves have been described although the basis for this phenomenon remains poorly understood. Here we describe in vitro conditions that allow lung and ovarian cancer cells to undergo a rapid and efficient transition into ECs that are indistinguishable from those obtained in vivo. A variety of methods were used to establish that the acquired phenotypes and behaviors of these tumor-derived ECs (TDECs) closely resemble those of authentic ECs. Xenografts arising from co-inoculated in vitro-derived TDECs and tumor cells were also more highly vascularized than control tumors; moreover, their blood vessels were on average larger and frequently contained admixtures of host-derived ECs and TDECs derived from the initial inoculum. These results demonstrate that cancer cells can be manipulated under well-defined in vitro conditions to initiate a tumor cell-to-EC transition that is largely cell-autonomous, highly efficient and closely mimics the in vivo process. These studies provide a suitable means by which to identify and perhaps modify the earliest steps in TDEC generation."

https://openalex.org/W2019420159,"The success of cisplatin (CP) based therapy is often hindered by acquisition of CP resistance. We isolated NSC109268 as a compound altering cellular sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. Previous investigation revealed an enhancement of CP sensitivity by NSC109268 in wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae and CP-sensitive and -resistant cancer cell lines that correlated with a slower S phase traversal. Here, we extended these studies to determine the target pathway(s) of NSC109268 in mediating CP sensitization, using yeast as a model. We reasoned that mutants defective in the relevant target of NSC109268 should be hypersensitive to CP and the sensitization effect by NSC109268 should be absent or strongly reduced. A survey of various yeast deletion mutants converged on the Rad5 pathway of DNA damage tolerance by template switching as the likely target pathway of NSC109268 in mediating cellular sensitization to CP. Additionally, cell cycle delays following CP treatment were not synergistically influenced by NSC109268 in the CP hypersensitive rad5Δ mutant. The involvement of the known inhibitory activities of NSC109268 on 20S proteasome and phosphatases 2Cα and 2A was tested. In the CP hypersensitive ptc2Δptc3Δpph3Δ yeast strain, deficient for 2C and 2A-type phosphatases, cellular sensitization to CP by NSC109268 was greatly reduced. It is therefore suggested that NSC109268 affects CP sensitivity by inhibiting the activity of unknown protein(s) whose dephosphorylation is required for the template switch pathway."
