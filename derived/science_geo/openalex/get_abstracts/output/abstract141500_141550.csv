https://openalex.org/W1963874808,"The copper chaperone for the superoxide dismutase (CCS) gene is necessary for expression of an active, copper-bound form of superoxide dismutase (SOD1) in vivo in spite of the high affinity of SOD1 for copper (dissociation constant = 6 fM) and the high intracellular concentrations of both SOD1 (10 μM in yeast) and copper (70 μM in yeast). In vitro studies demonstrated that purified Cu(I)-yCCS protein is sufficient for direct copper activation of apo-ySOD1 but is necessary only when the concentration of free copper ions ([Cu] free ) is strictly limited. Moreover, the physiological requirement for yCCS in vivo was readily bypassed by elevated copper concentrations and abrogation of intracellular copper-scavenging systems such as the metallothioneins. This metallochaperone protein activates the target enzyme through direct insertion of the copper cofactor and apparently functions to protect the metal ion from binding to intracellular copper scavengers. These results indicate that intracellular [Cu] free is limited to less than one free copper ion per cell and suggest that a pool of free copper ions is not used in physiological activation of metalloenzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2019973925,"A novel potassium channel gene has been cloned, characterized, and associated with cardiac arrhythmia. The gene encodes MinK-related peptide 1 (MiRP1), a small integral membrane subunit that assembles with HERG, a pore-forming protein, to alter its function. Unlike channels formed only with HERG, mixed complexes resemble native cardiac IKr channels in their gating, unitary conductance, regulation by potassium, and distinctive biphasic inhibition by the class III antiarrhythmic E-4031. Three missense mutations associated with long QT syndrome and ventricular fibrillation are identified in the gene for MiRP1. Mutants form channels that open slowly and close rapidly, thereby diminishing potassium currents. One variant, associated with clarithromycin-induced arrhythmia, increases channel blockade by the antibiotic. A mechanism for acquired arrhythmia is revealed: genetically based reduction in potassium currents that remains clinically silent until combined with additional stressors."
https://openalex.org/W2107625881,"Although small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family have been implicated in signaling to the actin cytoskeleton, the exact nature of the linkage has remained obscure. We describe a novel mechanism that links one Rho family member, Cdc42, to actin polymerization. N-WASP, a ubiquitously expressed Cdc42-interacting protein, is required for Cdc42-stimulated actin polymerization in Xenopus egg extracts. The C terminus of N-WASP binds to the Arp2/3 complex and dramatically stimulates its ability to nucleate actin polymerization. Although full-length N-WASP is less effective, its activity can be greatly enhanced by Cdc42 and phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate. Therefore, N-WASP and the Arp2/3 complex comprise a core mechanism that directly connects signal transduction pathways to the stimulation of actin polymerization."

However, in this study, HBV DNA was shown to largely disappear from the liver and the blood of acutely infected chimpanzees long before the peak of T cell infiltration and most of the liver disease. These results demonstrate that noncytopathic antiviral mechanisms contribute to viral clearance during acute viral hepatitis by purging HBV replicative intermediates from the cytoplasm and covalently closed circular viral DNA from the nucleus of infected cells."

https://openalex.org/W2138964904,"Vector magnetic field observations of the martian crust were acquired by the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) magnetic field experiment/electron reflectometer (MAG/ER) during the aerobraking and science phasing orbits, at altitudes between approximately 100 and 200 kilometers. Magnetic field sources of multiple scales, strength, and geometry were observed. There is a correlation between the location of the sources and the ancient cratered terrain of the martian highlands. The absence of crustal magnetism near large impact basins such as Hellas and Argyre implies cessation of internal dynamo action during the early Naochian epoch ( approximately 4 billion years ago). Sources with equivalent magnetic moments as large as 1.3 x 10(17) ampere-meter2 in the Terra Sirenum region contribute to the development of an asymmetrical, time-variable obstacle to solar wind flow around Mars."
https://openalex.org/W2133414177,"A disk-shaped molecule with chiral tails is shown to form long fibers of molecular diameter and micrometer length by self-assembly in chloroform. The molecules are derived from crown ethers and contain a phthalocyanine ring. In the fibers, they have a clockwise, staggered orientation that leads to an overall right-handed helical structure. These structures, in turn, self-assemble to form coiled-coil aggregates with left-handed helicity. Addition of potassium ions to the fibers leaves their structure intact but blocks the transfer of the chirality from the tails to the cores, leading to loss of the helicity of the fibers. These tunable chiral materials have potential in optoelectronic applications and as components in sensor devices."
https://openalex.org/W2008187459,"Exit from mitosis in budding yeast requires a group of essential proteins--including the GTPase Tem1 and the protein phosphatase Cdc14--that downregulate cyclin-dependent kinase activity. We identified a mutation, net1-1, that bypasses the lethality of tem1 delta. NET1 encodes a novel protein, and mass spectrometric analysis reveals that it is a key component of a multifunctional complex, denoted RENT (for regulator of nucleolar silencing and telophase), that also contains Cdc14 and the silencing regulator Sir2. From G1 through anaphase, RENT localizes to the nucleolus, and Cdc14 activity is inhibited by Net1. In late anaphase, Cdc14 dissociates from RENT, disperses throughout the cell in a Tem1-dependent manner, and ultimately triggers mitotic exit. Nucleolar sequestration may be a general mechanism for the regulation of diverse biological processes."

https://openalex.org/W2013167680,"Biomechanical stress is a major stimulus for cardiac hypertrophy and the transition to heart failure. By generating mice that harbor a ventricular restricted knockout of the gp130 cytokine receptor via Cre-loxP-mediated recombination, we demonstrate a critical role for a gp130-dependent myocyte survival pathway in the transition to heart failure. Such conditional mutant mice have normal cardiac structure and function, but during aortic pressure overload, these mice display rapid onset of dilated cardiomyopathy and massive induction of myocyte apoptosis versus the control mice that exhibit compensatory hypertrophy. Thus, cardiac myocyte apoptosis is a critical point in the transition between compensatory cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. gp130-dependent cytokines may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for preventing in vivo heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2069951758,"Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) may play a critical catalytic role in tissue remodeling in vivo, but it is secreted by cells as a stable, inactive zymogen, pro-MMP-9, and requires activation for catalytic function. A number of proteolytic enzymes activate pro-MMP-9 in vitro, but the natural activator(s) of MMP-9 is unknown. To examine MMP-9 activation in a cellular setting we employed cultures of human tumor cells (MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells) that were induced to produce MMP-9 over a 200-fold concentration range (0.03–8.1 nm). The levels of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMPs) in the induced cultures remain relatively constant at 1–4 nm. Quantitation of the zymogen/active enzyme status of MMP-9 in the MDA-MB-231 cultures indicates that even in the presence of potential activators, the molar ratio of endogenous MMP-9 to TIMP dictates whether pro-MMP-9 activation can progress. When the MMP-9/TIMP ratio exceeds 1.0, MMP-9 activation progresses, but through an interacting protease cascade involving plasmin and stromelysin 1 (MMP-3). Plasmin, generated by the endogenous urokinase-type plasminogen activator, is not an efficient activator of pro-MMP-9, neither the secreted pro-MMP-9 nor the very low levels of pro-MMP-9 associated with intact cells. Although plasmin can proteolytically process pro-MMP-9, this limited action does not yield an enzymatically active MMP-9, nor does it cause the MMP-9 to be more susceptible to activation. Plasmin, however, is very efficient at generating active MMP-3 (stromelysin-1) from exogenously added pro-MMP-3. The activated MMP-3 becomes a potent activator of the 92-kDa pro-MMP-9, yielding an 82-kDa species that is enzymatically active in solution and represents up to 50–75% conversion of the zymogen. The activated MMP-9 enhances the invasive phenotype of the cultured cells as their ability to both degrade extracellular matrix and transverse basement membrane is significantly increased following zymogen activation. That this enhanced tissue remodelling capability is due to the activation of MMP-9 is demonstrated through the use of a specific anti-MMP-9 blocking monoclonal antibody.

Degradation of connective tissue extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviation used is: ECM, extracellular matrix; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; TIMP, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.1The abbreviation used is: ECM, extracellular matrix; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; TIMP, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. and dissolution of epithelial and endothelial basement membrane are remodeling processes that occur during tumor invasion and metastasis. A family of proteolytic enzymes that have been functionally linked to these remodeling processes are the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (1Woessner J.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (3072) Google Scholar, 2Matrisian L.M. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). The members of this family are multidomain, zinc-containing, neutral endopeptidases and include the collagenases, stromelysins, gelatinases, and membrane-type metalloproteases (3Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2630) Google Scholar, 4Alexander C.M. Werb Z. Hay E.D. Cell Biology of Extracellular Matrix. Plenum Press, New York1991: 255-295Crossref Google Scholar). Different MMPs can be induced in a variety of embryonic, and adult cell types and distinct subsets are often found to be elevated in tumor tissue and malignant cells in culture (5Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Aznavoorian S. Liotta L.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 541-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar, 6MacDougall J.R. Matrisian L.M.

Each MMP has a preferred substrate specificity toward individual matrix proteins, but there is overlapping specificity within the whole family (3Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2630) Google Scholar, 4Alexander C.M. Werb Z. Hay E.D. Cell Biology of Extracellular Matrix. Plenum Press, New York1991: 255-295Crossref Google Scholar), and thus a few MMPs acting in tandem have the potential to catalyze the complete degradation of the proteinaceous components of the basement membrane and ECM. However, the catalytic manifestations of MMP enzymes are highly regulated. First, the MMPs are expressed as inactive zymogens and require distinct activation processes to convert them to active enzymes (8Springman E.B. Angleton E.L. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 9Corcoran M.S. Hewitt R.E. Kleiner D.E. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Enzyme Protein. 1996; 49: 7-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and second, a family of proteins, the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), are correspondingly widespread in tissue distribution and function as highly effective MMP inhibitors (K i ∼10−10m) (3Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2630) Google Scholar). How the invading tumor cells that utilize the MMP's degradative capacity circumvent these negative regulatory controls is not well understood.Within the cytokine- and oncoprotein-enriched tumor tissue environment, MMP expression more than likely will be up-regulated, and thus the limiting reaction in MMP-mediated tumor invasion may be zymogen activation. Activation of MMP zymogens involves disruption of a coordination bond formed between a highly conserved unpaired cysteine in the amino-terminal propeptide of the pro-MMP molecule and the zinc ion at the active center (8Springman E.B. Angleton E.L. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Disruption of this bond can be mediated by chemical and/or proteolytic mechanisms, often leading to an autoproteolytic event, resulting in the removal of the cysteine-containing propeptide domain, generating a lower molecular weight, catalytically active form of the MMP. If an active MMP is involved in the initial proteolytic step or if an autolytic processing event is part of the final step, then the presence of TIMPs in the surrounding milieu will prevent zymogen activation. MMP activation can occur through intracellular, extracellular, and cell surface-mediated proteolytic mechanisms. Intracellular activation of stromelysin 3 (MMP-11) occurs in the Golgi network and is mediated by the intracellular serine protease furin (10Pei D. Weiss S. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Activation of interstitial collagenase (MMP-1) and stromelysin (MMP-3) occurs extracellularly and can be mediated by the serine protease, plasmin (11He C. Wilhelm S.M. Pentland A.P. Marmer B.L.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5783-5789Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Cell surface activation of an MMP can occur when gelatinase A (MMP-2) is brought into contact with a membrane-associated MMP, MT-1 MMP (13Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinigawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar, 14Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). Interestingly, gelatinase B (MMP-9), a close structural homologue of MMP-2 does not appear to be activated by the same mechanism, as it remains a zymogen under identical cellular conditions where a majority of co-expressed pro-MMP-2 is activated via the cell surface mechanism (15Brown P.D.

While MMP-2 appears to be constitutively expressed by many cell types in culture, MMP-9 expression is induced by cytokines (21Moll U.M. Youngleib G. Rosinski K. Quigley J.P.

Arthritis Rheum. 1996; 39: 1576-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Tumor cell invasion in a number of instances also has been linked with MMP-9 activity (5Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Aznavoorian S. Liotta L.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 541-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar, 6MacDougall J.R. Matrisian L.M.

Furthermore, Muschel and colleagues (28Bernhard E.J. Gruber S.B. Muschel R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4293-4297Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 29Hua J. Muschel R.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5279-5284PubMed Google Scholar) have shown by both transfection and ribozyme-based approaches that MMP-9 is directly involved in tumor metastasis, and more recently MMP-9 activity has been linked with the process of tumor cell intravasation (30Kim J.

Thus in these malignant cell systems, the regulatory controls that maintain MMPs as inactive zymogens were circumvented, since conversion of pro-MMP-9 to active enzyme had clearly occurred.

MMP-3, based onin vitro kinetic and catalytic parameters, appears to be the most efficient activator of pro-MMP-9 (32Ogata Y. Itoh Y. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18506-18511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and may be a natural activator in vivo. It is not clear, however, if MMP-3 will always be present in the tumor tissues where pro-MMP-9 is expressed. Furthermore, even if MMP-3 is available in the tissues, it is produced as a zymogen and also requires activation. In addition, the inhibitory potential of the TIMPs must be circumvented in the tumor tissue to allow for catalytic manifestations of both the activating MMP-3 and the activated MMP-9.To demonstrate a possible tumor-associated mechanism of MMP-9 activation and the circumvention of TIMP-mediated control, we have examined cultures of a breast carcinoma cell line, MDA-MB 231, which expresses both MMP-9 and TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. MDA-MB-231 cultures do not appear to express MMP-2, also a potent gelatinase. Since MMP-9 activation is monitored by the generation of gelatinase activity, the absence of any interfering MMP-2 gelatinase activity in the cultures was critical for quantitating zymogen activation. Our results indicate that MMP-9 produced by the breast tumor cells is a stable zymogen even when exceptionally high levels of MMP-9 are induced and when active plasmin is generated in the cultures. However, when pro-MMP-3 is introduced into the system at concentrations that stoichiometrically exceed the endogenous TIMP levels, plasmin activates the MMP-3 which in turn efficiently processes and activates the pro-MMP-9. The activated MMP-9 contributes significantly to tumor cell-mediated ECM degradation and basement membrane invasion, and the specificity of these mechanisms is demonstrated through the use of neutralizing anti-MMP-9 monoclonal antibodies.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have utilized a cell culture model in an attempt to recapitulate some of the biochemical events that might take place in an invasive tumor when active MMP-9 is generated. A critical feature of the model is that the natural regulators of MMP function, the TIMPs, are present endogenously in nanomolar amounts. A second feature of the model is that it has the capacity to generate an additional protease system, namely the uPA/plasmin cascade, that has been closely linked to the migratory, invasive phenotype (7Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 161-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar) and also linked functionally to the activation of a number of MMPs including MMP-9 (55DeClerck Y.A. Laug W.E. Enzyme Protein. 1996; 49: 72-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Our initial analysis of this culture system (Figs. 1 and 2) illustrates the inherent stability of the pro-MMP-9 zymogen and its apparent resistance to activation even when the levels of MMP-9 are increased by cytokine treatment, when plasminogen is added to the cultures and when active MMP-3 is generated. Since active plasmin was demonstrated to be present in the cultures and at sufficient catalytic levels to activate pro-MMP-3, plasmin did not appear to be an effective activator of pro-MMP-9. However, MMP-3 had been shown in vitro to be an efficient pro-MMP-9 activator (32Ogata Y. Itoh Y. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18506-18511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and the question arose as to why the newly generated MMP-3 did not activate the available pro-MMP-9. Determining the total TIMP (4 nm) present in the cultures and comparing it with the amount of available pro-MMP-9 (0.25 nm) indicated that sufficient TIMP-1 was present to complex all of the pro-MMP-9 and retard its activation. Furthermore, excess TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 also would be present to inhibit the nanomolar levels of the plasmin-activated MMP-3. Even if the newly generated MMP-3 exceeded the TIMP levels, it was possible that pro-MMP-9 at subnanomolar levels tightly complexed with TIMP-1 and in equilibrium with other TIMPs in the cellular milieu was unable to interact efficiently with the excess MMP-3 to progress through activation. Thus the dominating molar excess of the TIMPs was one compelling reason why MMP-9 activation could not progress even in the presence of a potential activator.In order to overcome the suppressive effect of the TIMPs, transfection of MDA-MB-231 cells was employed to up-regulate the MMP-9 levels. The transfected cells were unchanged in terms of expression of all the proteases and protease inhibitors tested (Fig. 3) with the exception of MMP-9, which was increased 200-fold over the parental cultures and 30-fold over that of the PMA-treated cultures. However, overriding the TIMP levels with excess MMP-9 expression was not sufficient by itself to initiate activation of pro-MMP-9. The MMP-9-overexpressing cultures needed to be supplemented with both plasminogen and pro-MMP-3 (Figs. 4and 6). Supplementation with plasminogen alone did not bring about activation, even though active plasmin was generated via the endogenous tumor cell uPA. This result documents the inherent stability of the pro-MMP-9 zymogen in a cellular setting and further indicates that plasmin is not a direct activator of pro-MMP-9 under the cellular conditions employed herein. Studies from other laboratories also had concluded that plasmin was not an efficient activator of pro-MMP-9 (31Okada Y. Gonoji Y. Naka K. Tomita K. Nakanishi I. Iwata K. Yamashita K. Hayakawa T. J.

Supplementation of the transfected cultures with pro-MMP-3 alone also did not yield activated MMP-9, as the pro-MMP-3 in the absence of plasminogen remained a 55-kDa zymogen, further demonstrating that plasmin was responsible for the conversion of 55-kDa pro-MMP-3 to the 45-kDa active MMP-3. When both plasminogen and pro-MMP-3 were added to the cultures, the tumor cell uPA activated the plasminogen, the generated plasmin activated the pro-MMP-3, and then active MMP-3, when it exceeded the concentration of TIMP, converted 92-kDa pro-MMP-9 to 82-kDa active MMP-9.In studies of zymogen activation by proteases, it would seem important to distinguish true enzyme activation from proteolytic conversion of the proenzyme to smaller but catalytically inactive forms. Enzyme activity measurements in solution were critical in the present study, since distinct lower molecular mass forms of MMP-9 were generated upon addition of plasminogen alone or pro-MMP-3 alone (Fig. 6). These processed forms were active in gelatin substrate gels (zymographs) but were not active in solution, and thus true activation of MMP-9 did not occur under these conditions. In addition, a lower molecular mass form of MMP-9 was observed in tumor cell extracts (Fig. 8), and its similar zymographic position to the 82-kDa active MMP-9 suggested that it represented a cell-associated form that had been activated. However, enzyme activity measurements on the isolated cellular MMP-9 indicated that this lower molecular mass form was not an active enzyme but behaved like a zymogen. Other laboratories also have shown that certain lower molecular weight forms of MMP-9 are not enzymatically active (41Ogata Y. Enghild J.J. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3581-3584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,42Shapiro S.D. Fliszar C.J. Broekelmann T.J. Mecham R.P. Senior R.M. Welgus H.G. J. Biol.

(53Toth M. Gervasi D.C. Fridman R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3159-3167PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that a cell-associated 85-kDa species of MMP-9 was active in zymographs but enzymatically inactive in solution. The 85-kDa form represented a different glycosylated variant of pro-MMP-9. Ogata et al.(41Ogata Y. Enghild J.J. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3581-3584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that an 86-kDa processed form of MMP-9 was zymographically active but not enzymatically active in solution. This 86-kDa form represented a species that had been proteolytically processed at the Glu41-Met42 site in pro-MMP-9, 47 residues upstream of the actual activation site.

In some of these studies plasmin was implicated as a direct activator of pro-MMP-9 (57Baramova E.N. Bajou K. Remacle A. L'Hoir C. Knell H.W. Weidle U.H. Noel A. Foidart J.M.

Cancer. 1993; 55: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In the culture system described herein, plasmin indeed can generate lower molecular mass forms of MMP-9 but does not yield activated enzyme. The plasmin involvement in MMP-9 activation in this system is only indirect; it functions within an interacting cascade to generate active MMP-3. This indirect role of plasmin and the apparent requirement for plasminogen in the cascade is more clearly illustrated when already activated MMP-3 is added directly to the tumor cell culture medium (Fig. 7). The requirement for plasminogen and pro-MMP-3 in the cascade is circumvented as active MMP-3 directly generates the 82-kDa MMP-9 and in turn generates significant gelatinase activity.In contrast to the present studies, Mazzieri et al. (52Mazzieri R. Masiero L. Zanetta L. Monea S. Onisto M. Garbisa S. Mignatti P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2319-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), using HT1080 cultures, concluded that plasmin could process and activate pro-MMP-9 (and also pro-MMP-2) in the absence of any detectable MMP-3. The plasmin that appeared to be responsible for this MMP activation was cell surface-activated plasmin, and the gelatinases that were activated were apparently associated with the cell surface. Since most of our studies involve the secreted, soluble pro-MMP-9, which could be readily activated by MMP-3 and could not be activated at all by plasmin, the apparent contrasting results may reflect cell-associated activation versus solution phase activation. However, when the tumor cell-associated MMP-9 was examined (Fig. 8), it was found that little if any active MMP-9 was associated with the cells, that plasmin did not enhance the level of active MMP-9 that became cell-associated, and that when a detectable level of active MMP-9 was found associated with the cells (<1%), the specific requirements for its activation appeared to be the same as that for activation of t"

The nNOS-syntrophin PDZ complex structure revealed that the domains interact in an unusual linear head-to-tail arrangement. The nNOS PDZ domain has two opposite interaction surfaces—one face has the canonical peptide binding groove, whereas the other has a β-hairpin “finger.” This nNOS β finger docks in the syntrophin peptide binding groove, mimicking a peptide ligand, except that a sharp β turn replaces the normally required carboxyl terminus. This structure explains how PDZ domains can participate in diverse interaction modes to assemble protein networks."

In addition, we observed the enhancement of telomerase activity with the pretreatment of Akt kinase <i>in vitro.</i>Thus, these observations suggest that Akt kinase enhances human telomerase activity through phosphorylation of hTERT subunit as one of its substrate proteins."

Signal termination is achieved by the action of the arrestins, which bind to activated, phosphorylated G protein–coupled receptors. We describe here crystallographic studies of visual arrestin in its basal conformation. The salient features of the structure are a bipartite molecule with an unusual polar core. This core is stabilized in part by an extended carboxy-terminal tail that locks the molecule into an inactive state. In addition, arrestin is found to be a dimer of two asymmetric molecules, suggesting an intrinsic conformational plasticity. In conjunction with biochemical and mutagenesis data, we propose a molecular mechanism by which arrestin is activated for receptor binding."
https://openalex.org/W2086696756,"Neurotransmitter exocytosis, a process mediated by a core complex of syntaxin, SNAP-25, and VAMP (SNAREs), is inhibited by SNARE-cleaving neurotoxins. Botulinum neurotoxin E inhibition of norepinephrine release in permeabilized PC12 cells can be rescued by adding a 65 aa C-terminal fragment of SNAP-25 (S25-C). Mutations along the hydrophobic face of the S25-C helix result in SNARE complexes with different thermostabilities, and these mutants rescue exocytosis to different extents. Rescue depends on the continued presence of both S25-C and Ca2+ and correlates with complex formation. The data suggest that Ca2+ triggers S25-C binding to a low-affinity site, initiating trans-complex formation. Pairing of SNARE proteins on apposing membranes leads to bilayer fusion and results in a high-affinity cis-SNARE complex."
https://openalex.org/W2019790163,"The Sir2 protein mediates gene silencing and repression of recombination at the rDNA repeats in budding yeast. Here we show that Sir2 executes these functions as a component of a nucleolar complex designated RENT (re gulator of n ucleolar silencing and t elophase exit). Net1, a core subunit of this complex, preferentially cross-links to the rDNA repeats, but not to silent DNA regions near telomeres or to active genes, and tethers the RENT complex to rDNA. Net1 is furthermore required for rDNA silencing and nucleolar integrity. During interphase, Net1 and Sir2 colocalize to a subdomain within the nucleolus, but at the end of mitosis a fraction of Sir2 leaves the nucleolus and disperses as foci throughout the nucleus, suggesting that the structure of rDNA silent chromatin changes during the cell cycle. Our findings suggest that a protein complex shown to regulate exit from mitosis is also involved in gene silencing."

Axons of VR2-expressing neurons converge onto numerous glomeruli in the accessory olfactory bulb. The pattern of axonal projections is complex and variable. This wiring diagram is substantially different from that of the main olfactory system.

Of interest, the domain structures of Inp52p and Inp53p, and to a lesser extent Inp51p, are analogous to synaptojanin, having a 300-amino acid 5-ptase domain that is flanked by amino- and carboxyl-terminalSAC1-like and proline-rich domains. Although the function ofSAC1-like domains in synaptojanin, the Inp5ps, and Sac1p is unknown, genetic studies have shown that mutations in Sac1p overcome certain actin defects and bypass the requirement for Sec14p, a phosphatidylinositol/phosphatidylcholine transfer protein required for generation of secretory vesicles from Golgi (23Cleves A.E.

Meyer D.I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1377-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Here we report studies aimed at elucidating the unique and overlapping roles of the INP5 gene products. We demonstrate that Inp52p, Inp53p, and synaptojanin have two lipid phosphatase activities, one as a novel polyphosphoinositide phosphatase (PPIPase) and the other as a PI(4,5)P2 5-ptase. Remarkably, we show that these activities are encoded by two autonomous active sites provided by theSAC1-like and 5-ptase domains, respectively. PPIPase activity is biologically relevant because loss of this activity in cells results in significant changes in the levels of certain phosphoinositides. The unique substrate selectivity and regulatory properties of each activity suggests novel hypotheses regarding how individual and/or combinatorial control of PI(4)P, PI(3)P, PI(3,5)P2, and PI(4,5)P2 are intimately involved in the regulation of vesicle trafficking and actin cytoskeleton organization.

Wente (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Open table in a new tab Overexpression of Inp51p, Inp52p, and Inp53p in yeast was achieved on a triple knockout background. Construction of triple mutant strains required deletion ofINP54 in previously reported double mutants (20Stolz L.E. Huynh C.V. Thorner J. York J.D. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1715-1729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TheINP54 coding region was deleted and replaced in a W303 diploid strain with the LEU2 gene by a PCR-based method (20Stolz L.E. Huynh C.V. Thorner J. York J.D. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1715-1729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Haploid inp54 and appropriate haploid double mutants were mated, sporulated, and dissected to yield inp51 inp52 inp54, inp51 inp53 inp54, and inp52 inp53 inp54 triple mutants. Overexpression of Inp5ps was accomplished in triple mutant yeast harboring plasmids containing the coding sequence of each Inp5 under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter. Plasmids were constructed using a PCR-based strategy in which the coding sequences were inserted into pBJ246 (ATCC 777452) to yield pGAL51, pGAL52, and pGAL53. Cells harboring plasmids were grown in CM/ura−containing 2% raffinose to an A 600 of 0.2, induced by the addition of galactose (2% final) for 6 h and harvested. Soluble extracts were prepared from 1 × 108 cells by bead beating in 200 μl of 250 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, supplemented with 25 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 750 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNaVO4. Radiolabeled substrate was either purchased (3H-PI(4,5)P2; NEN Life Science Products) or prepared from steady-state inositol-labeled cells (3H-PI,3H-PI(3)P, 3H-PI(4)P,3H-PI(3,5)P2, and 3H-PI(4,5)P2). Inp51 mutant strains were grown in CM containing 200 μCi/ml ofmyo-[2-3H(N)]inositol over 10 doublings, harvested at log-phase (1 × 108 cells), “stressed” by treatment with 5 mg of zymolyase 20T (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan) for 30 min, and lipids were chloroform/methanol extracted (21Stolz L.E.

Purified 3H-PIP (PI(3)P and PI(4)P) was obtained by separating crude lipids using base-oxalate TLC (29Pignataro O.P. Ascoli M. J. Biol.

Mixed vesicle substrates were prepared by drying total cell or purified lipids under a N2 stream and briefly sonicating in buffer containing RB buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 3 mm EGTA). Detergent micelle substrate was prepared using RBT buffer (RB buffer supplemented with 0.2% Triton X-100). Enzymatic assays were performed in either RB or RBT buffer supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mmMgCl2, and 10 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at 37 °C. Where noted, MgCl2 was omitted to optimize PPIPase activity. Reactions were stopped, extracted with chloroform/methanol, deacylated with methylamine (21Stolz L.E. Kuo W.J. Longchamps J. Sekhon M.K. York J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11852-11861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and analyzed by HPLC (see below). The coding region of INP53 was inserted in-frame into pGEX-3X vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to yield pGEX53. The 5-ptase domain ofINP53 (residues 490–1107) was amplified by PCR and inserted in-frame into pGEX-3X to yield pGEX53–5pt. The SAC1-like domain of INP53 (residues 1–548) was constructed by digestion of pGEX53 with SnaBI and SmaI and religated to produce pGEX53-SAC. The SAC1-like domain of synaptojanin (residues 1–523) was amplified by PCR from a human brain pCMV sport library DNA (Life Technologies, Inc.) and inserted into pGEX-3X yielding pGEXSyn-SAC. Expression of GST fusion proteins was performed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) as described previously (21Stolz L.E. Kuo W.J. Longchamps J. Sekhon M.K. York J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11852-11861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) with the exception that 1 liter of LB medium was used for a 24-h induction at 23 °C, and cells were disrupted by French press. Fusion proteins were purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B chromatography according to manufacturer's directions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Yeast strains were labeled over 10 cell doublings to steady-state in appropriate minimal medium containing [3H]myo-inositol. Lipids were deacylated with methylamine reagent essentially as described (21Stolz L.E. Kuo W.J. Longchamps J. Sekhon M.K. York J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11852-11861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) except that 1 mg of carrier lipid (brain extract, Sigma) was added to improve yield. Glycerophosphoinositols (groPI) were resolved by Partisphere SAX HPLC (Whatman 4.6 × 125 mm). Samples were equilibrated to 10 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 3.5 (AP), applied to column, and eluted using the following gradient: 10 mm AP to 340 mm AP over 15 min, 340 mm AP to 1.02m AP over 7.5 min, and isocratic 1.02 m AP for additional 5 min. Radioactivity was measured using the BetaRAMTM in-line detector (INUS, Tampa, FL). Sequencing of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome reveals four gene products, designated INP5s, that have the canonical catalytic motifs present in all inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases. Previously, we reported that recombinant Inp51p functions as a lipid-selective 5-ptase that converts PI(4,5)P2 to PI(4)P but does not hydrolyze Ins(1,4,5)P3 (21Stolz L.E. Kuo W.J. Longchamps J. Sekhon M.K. York J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11852-11861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We have recently found that Inp54p is also a PI(4,5)P2 lipid selective 5-ptase. 2S. Guo and J. D. York, unpublished observation. These data coupled with published reports that yeast extracts do not have detectable Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-ptase activity (21Stolz L.E. Kuo W.J. Longchamps J. Sekhon M.K. York J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11852-11861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 30Estevez F. Pulford D. Stark M.J. Carter A.N. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 709-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) suggest that the Inp5ps utilize lipid substrates. Candidate D-5 phosphorylated lipid substrates present in yeast include PI(4,5)P2 and the newly discovered osmotic stress-induced PI(3,5)P2 (31Whiteford C.C. Brearley C.A. Ulug E.T. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 32Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Douglas M.R. Sayers L.G. Parker P.J. Michell R.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). To help explain the individual and overlapping cellular functions of the Inp5ps, we characterized their substrate selectivities. In our initial biochemical assays, we used native Inp5 proteins and presented lipid substrate in two distinct contexts: mixed vesicles and detergent micelles. Individual native Inp5ps were overproduced in a yeast strain that lacked the other three 5-ptases (GAL51 in inp52 inp53 inp54, GAL52 in inp51 inp53 inp54, and GAL53 in inp51 inp52 inp54). Total cellular lipids harvested from 3H-inositol-labeled yeast were used to prepare the substrates as a means to approximate the phospholipid stoichiometry and composition encountered in vivo. The abundance of PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,5)P2 candidate substrates was increased 2- and 10-fold by preparing lipids from stressed inp51 mutant strains, resulting in readily detectable 3H-PI, 3H-PI(3)P,3H-PI(4)P, 3H-PI(3,5)P2, and 3H-PI(4,5)P2 (Fig. 1). Individual Inp5ps show distinct substrate selectivities and sensitivity to detergent (Fig. 1). Treatment of mixed vesicle substrate (Fig. 1A) with buffer control or pGAL extract (not shown) yielded identical profiles of groPIs, confirming the absence of background phosphatase activity. Inp51p (pGAL51) treatment of mixed vesicle substrate resulted in a selective reduction in PI(4,5)P2(12,200 versus 9,400 cpm) and a corresponding increase in PI(4)P (6,600 versus 9,800 cpm). The activity was time- and dose-dependent under conditions of 10–40% conversion, and a maximal hydrolysis of 80% was attainable using the mixed vesicle substrate (not shown). Remarkably, treatment of mixed vesicles with Inp52p (pGAL52) or Inp53p (pGAL53) resulted in 80% decreases in all polyphosphoinositides. Strikingly, treatment of substrate prepared as a detergent micelle (Fig. 1B) yielded significantly different activities. Under these conditions, Inp51p did not hydrolyze any of the phosphoinositides. Inp52p and Inp53p converted 100% of the PI(4,5)P2 to PI(4)P; however, they were no longer able to hydrolyze PI(3,5)P2, PI(3)P and PI(4)P. We also tested the three proteins against soluble substrates including inositol 1,4-bisphosphate, Ins(1,4,5)P3, and inositol 1,3,4,5, tetrakisphosphate and found that they did not serve as substrates (not shown). These data suggest that Inp51p is a detergent-sensitive PI(4,5)P2 5-ptase that does not utilize PI(3,5)P2 or PIPs, consistent with our previously published data (21Stolz L.E. Kuo W.J. Longchamps J. Sekhon M.K. York J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11852-11861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In contrast, Inp52p and Inp53p possess two distinct activities: one is a detergent-insensitive PI(4,5)P25-ptase, and the other is a detergent-sensitive polyphosphoinositide 3-/4-/5-phosphatase activity (designated PPIPase). The 5-ptase and PPIPase activities were found to be Mg2+-dependent and -independent, respectively (not shown). To demonstrate that the PPIPase activity of Inp52p and Inp53p was intrinsic and not associated, recombinant Inp53p was produced in bacteria as a GST fusion protein (GST-53) and analyzed (Fig. 2A). Treatment of mixed vesicle substrate with either control (not shown) or GST showed no detectable phosphatase activity. Purified recombinant GST-53 harbored activity that resulted in >60% decreases in all polyphosphoinositides. Treatment of detergent micelle substrate with GST-53 resulted in a 100% decrease in PI(4,5)P2 and a quantitative increase in PI(4)P (not shown). These data are similar to those obtained with native Inp53p and demonstrate that both the PPIPase and 5-ptase activities are intrinsic properties of Inp53p and presumably Inp52p. The unique biochemical properties and substrate selectivity of PPIPase and 5-phosphatase activities suggest that they are separable. Therefore, we separated partially proteolyzed recombinant Inp53p by size exclusion chromatography and assayed individual fractions for PPIPase and 5-ptase activities. This analysis confirmed that these activities are separable (not shown). Furthermore, the PPIPase and 5-ptase activities were detected in fractions eluting as low as 30 and 25 kDa, respectively (not shown). This was intriguing because multiple sequence alignments predict that the SAC1-like and 5-ptase domains are approximately this size. With this in mind, the 5-ptase and SAC1-like domains of INP53 were independently expressed as GST fusion proteins and analyzed (Fig. 2A). Treatment of mixed vesicle substrate with the 5-ptase domain resulted in a 40% decrease in PI(4,5)P2 and a quantitative increase in PI(4)P (GST53–5pt), demonstrating that it encodes a 5-ptase but not PPIPase activity. Remarkably, treatment of mixed vesicles with theSAC1-like domain resulted in >70% reduction in the levels of PI(3,5)P2, PI(4)P, and PI(3)P, whereas PI(4,5)P2 levels did not change (GST53-Sac). Using detergent micellar substrate we found that the PPIPase activity of GST53-Sac was ablated and that the 5-ptase activity of GST53–5pt was stimulated (not shown), recapitulating data observed for the full-length GST53 protein. The PPIPase activity was found to be Mg2+-independent and inhibited by 2 mmCu2+ and Zn2+ (80%) and by Mg2+(20%) (not shown). Addition of DTT markedly increased activity. Together these data demonstrate that both the SAC1-like and 5-ptase domains of Inp53p autonomously fold and are sufficient to encode the intrinsic PPIPase and 5-ptase activities found in Inp53p. The product(s) formed by the PPIPase activity were characterized using purified PIP2 and PIP mixed vesicle substrates (Fig. 2,B and C). Treatment of either lipid substrate with GST protein alone did not produce detectable hydrolytic activity. Full-length GST53 quantitatively hydrolyzed PIP2 to form PI, and no PIP intermediates were detected. Treatment of PIP2 with GST53–5pt protein converted PI(4,5)P2 but not PI(3,5)P2 to PI(4)P. In contrast, GST53-Sac protein hydrolyzed PI(3,5)P2 to PI without producing detectable intermediates and did not utilize PI(4,5)P2. Treatment of PIP with GST alone results in no hydrolytic activity. Addition of GST53-Sac results in conversion of both PI(3)P and PI(4)P to PI. In contrast, PIP is not hydrolyzed by GST53–5pt protein (not shown). To examine whether the SAC1-like domain of human synaptojanin harbors similar PPIPase activity, we expressed this domain as a GST fusion protein. Of interest, although the majority of reports of the biochemical activity of synaptojanin show that it is restricted to a type II 5-ptase, Chung et al. (33Chung J.K. Sekiya F. Kang H.S. Lee C. Han J.S. Kim S.R. Bae Y.S. Morris A.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15980-15985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) reported that purified rat brain synaptojanin exhibits 4-/5-phosphatase activity, which converts PI(4,5)P2 to PI, although it was not determined whether this activity was intrinsic or a co-purifying contaminant such as the polyphosphoinositidase activity reported by Hope and Pike (34Hope H.M. Pike L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23648-23654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of total cell substrate with purified GSTSyn-Sac resulted in >50% decreases in levels of PI(3)P, PI(4)P, and PI(3,5)P2 (not shown). Again, PI(4,5)P2 was not a substrate, consistent with the results obtained using GST53-Sac protein. Treatment of purified 3H-PIP with GSTSyn-Sac results in 50% conversion of both isomers to PI (Fig. 2C). The activity is time- and dose-dependent and has similar biochemical properties to GST53-Sac PPIPase in terms of metal inhibition and DTT stimulation (not shown). The inability of any SAC1-like domains tested to hydrolyze PI(4,5)P2 is surprising because they are able to function as 3-, 4-, and 5-phosphatases. Attempts to detect PI(4,5)P2hydrolytic activity under a variety of conditions, including using commercially available PI(4,5)P2, have reproducibly failed (not shown). Thus, the mechanism by which SAC1-like domains discern their substrates remains uncertain and will be of significant future interest. To ascertain if PPIPase activity of SAC1-like domains was functional in vivo, we examined the phosphoinositide levels in inp52 inp53 mutant strains. Previously, we reported that steady-state levels of PI(4,5)P2 did not change in inp52 inp53 mutants (20Stolz L.E. Huynh C.V. Thorner J. York J.D. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1715-1729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas two-fold increases were detected in inp51 null cells (21Stolz L.E. Kuo W.J. Longchamps J. Sekhon M.K. York J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11852-11861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, these studies were performed using thin layer chromatography system not capable of resolving PI(4,5)P2and PI(3,5)P2. We therefore analyzed3H-inositol lipid levels in wild type and inp52 inp53 mutant strains using a deacylation and HPLC strategy. The levels of PI(4,5)P2, PI(3)P, and PI(4)P were similar in both strains (not shown). However, at early log phase (3 × 106) the levels of PI(3,5)P2 increased 5–7-fold in inp52 inp53 mutant cells (Fig. 3A). It is noteworthy that even at the increased levels, the amount of PI(3,5)P2 was only 30% of the PI(4,5)P2, thereby explaining why this may have been missed in our previous study. Additionally, this difference was not observed at late log and stationary phase. These data are consistent with a role for Inp52p and Inp53p in regulating levels of PI(3,5)P2. Previous work of Kearns et al. (25Kearns B.G. McGee T.P. Mayinger P. Gedvilaite A. Phillips S.E. Kagiwada S. Bankaitis V.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) suggested thatsac1 mutant strains had large increases in mannosyl di-inositol diphosphorylceramide (M[IP]2C). Our biochemical studies and the observation that TLC systems, such as those used in the Kearns study, may not effectively resolve PIPs from M[IP]2C suggested that the M[IP]2C spot may have been misidentified. Therefore, we analyzed the levels of phosphoinositides in sac1 mutant strains using a deacylation/HPLC system. Analysis of groPIs from steady-state labeled CTY182 (wild type) and CTY244 (sac1Δ) strains lipids demonstrate that sac1 mutants exhibit ∼10-, 2.5-, and 2-fold increases in PI(4)P, PI(3,5)P2, and PI(3)P, respectively (Fig. 3B). In contrast, levels of PI(4,5)P2 did not significantly change. We then labeled cells with [3H]serine, which labels ceramide but not PI lipids, and found no changes in any inositol ceramide lipids (not shown). Because inositol ceramides are resistant to cleavage by methylamine, we analyzed the nondeacylatable lipids from inositol labeled cells and again found no differences (not shown). Collectively, these data demonstrate that polyphosphoinositides and not M[IP]2C are regulated by Sac1p PPIPase activity. The dramatic accumulation of PI(4)P in sac1 mutants suggest that Sac1p regulates a major pool of PI(4)P, possibly at the Golgi. Remarkably, despite the 10-fold increases in PI(4)P, the levels of PI(4,5)P2 did not increase, if anything they appear to decrease slightly (Fig. 3B). It is therefore possible that the pool of PI(4)P utilized by Sac1p is different or sequestered from a pool used to make PI(4,5)P2. This may occur through spatial sequestration or by a protein masking as was recently proposed by Stevenson et al. (35Stevenson J.M. Perera I.Y. Boss W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22761-22767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the levels of PI(4,5)P2 may be maintained by feedback mechanisms controlling phosphatase, lipase, and/or kinase activities. It is also noteworthy that upon deletion of Fig4p, another yeastSAC1-like domain-containing protein, only small changes were observed in steady-state phosphoinositide levels (not shown). One explanation may be that the pool of lipid that Fig4p accesses is relatively small or tightly regulated. SAC1-like domains contain a highly conserved sequence motif, RTNCLDCLDRTN (Fig. 4A). Within this sequence is the CX 5R(T/S) motif found in other metal-independent protein and inositol polyphosphate phosphatases including: the tyrosine and dual function protein phosphatases PTP1B and VHR; the inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase family; and the PI(3,4,5)P3 3-phosphatase encoded by the tumor suppressor PTEN (36Maehama T.

These biochemical and sequence similarities indicate a possible evolutionary relationship among these proteins. Additionally, the lack of PPIPase activity in both native and recombinant Inp5p is likely explained by the presence of extensive mutations within this motif to RisafDsiekpN. Most notable are the mutations in the consensus residues C → A, R → K, and (T/S) → P. The assignment of PPIPase activity to SAC1-like domains represents a significant step forward in understanding how its substrates or products may regulate vesicle trafficking, actin organization, and other cellular events as summarized in Fig. 4B. Loss of PPIPase activity in sac1 mutants results in profound changes in the cellular levels of phosphoinositides, especially PI(4)P. In the case of all the “sec14 bypass” mutants, it is thought that the common downstream component is expansion of the diacylglycerol pool (25Kearns B.G. McGee T.P. Mayinger P. Gedvilaite A. Phillips S.E. Kagiwada S. Bankaitis V.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The accumulation of phosphoinositides in sac1 mutants may expand the pool of diacylglycerol directly through Plc1p-mediated turnover of PI(4)P or indirectly through alterations in novel phosphoinositide-regulated lipid metabolic pathways that lead to increased diacylglycerol production. Although the largest metabolic changes are observed in PI(4)P, significant changes are also found in PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2. Thus, it is possible that these lipids regulate events related to diacylglycerol production. The ability of defects in Sac1p and presumably PPIPase activity to overcome defects inact1-1 mutant is intriguing. Much focus has been placed on PI(4,5)P2 in regulating actin cytoskeleton; however, our data indicate levels of this lipid do not significantly change insac1 mutants. Thus we suggest a novel role for PI(4)P, PI(3)P, and/or PI(3,5)P2 in regulating actin organization. Furthermore, our work provides insight into possible roles for PPIPase activity and phosphoinositides in the regulation of ATP transport into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (27Mayinger P. Bankaitis V.A. Meyer D.I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1377-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The fact that Inp52p, Inp53p, and synaptojanin possess both PPIPase and 5-ptase activities is novel and necessitates re-evaluation of the relative roles of PI(4,5)P2 versus PI(4)P, PI(3)P, and PI(3,5)P2 in synaptic and general vesicle trafficking. It is intriguing to speculate as to why the two catalytic domains are found in nature to be tethered or alone (Fig. 4B). One possible reason may be that tethering enables localized substrate hydrolysis. In a concerted model, the 5-ptase domain may hydrolyze PI(4,5)P2 to produce PI(4)P, signal event one, which is then sequentially converted to PI by theSAC1-like domain, signal event two. These events may occur rapidly or slowly awaiting the appropriate regulatory queues. Alternatively, the lipid substrates for 5-ptase and PPIPase activities may be independent and/or localized at different membranes. To this end, each activity may be involved at different steps in vesicle trafficking, for example one during vesicle formation and the other during vesicle docking or fusion. Perhaps PPIPase activity functions to reduce polyanion charge facilitating changes in protein recruitment or by directly reducing anionic lipid-lipid repulsion forces encountered during membrane fusion. Additionally, PPIPase activity may be required to replenish PI stores that are critical for re-initiation of signaling events and general membrane homeostasis. Importantly, the distinct biochemical properties and substrate selectivity of each domain indicate multiple points of potential regulation, thereby enabling combinatorial signaling modes for proteins such as Inp52p, Inp53p, and synaptojanin. Clearly, both 5-ptase and PPIPase activities are important in regulating membrane trafficking. It is interesting that Inp51p and certain alternative splice variants of synaptojanin have lost the PPIPase functional domain. Lastly, our report represents the first description at the molecular level of a PI(3)P 3-phosphatase, a PI(4)P 4-phosphatase, a PI(3,5)P2 3-/5-phosphatase, and collectively a PPIPase. Of significant recent interest is the regulation of PI(3,5)P2. PI(3,5)P2 is transiently present during osmotic stress (32Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Douglas M.R. Sayers L.G. Parker P.J. Michell R.H.

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is an evolutionarily conserved process of cell suicide critical for normal development and elimination of pathogen-infected cells (1Vaux D.L. Strasser A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2239-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Genetic studies in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have identified components of the death pathway that show similarity to large families of mammalian proteins involved in apoptosis (2Metzstein M.M. Stanfield G.M. Horvitz H.R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 410-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, Apaf-1 has been the only CED-4-like cell death protein identified thus far in humans (3Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar). Like CED-4, Apaf-1 contains a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) 1The abbreviation used is: CARD, caspase recruitment domain; NBS, nucleotide-binding site; EST, expressed sequence tag; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; HA, hemagglutinin; β-gal, β-galactosidase.1The abbreviation used is: CARD, caspase recruitment domain; NBS, nucleotide-binding site; EST, expressed sequence tag; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; HA, hemagglutinin; β-gal, β-galactosidase. as its N-terminal effector domain and a centrally located nucleotide-binding site (NBS) domain. The C-terminal region of Apaf-1 lacks homology with CED-4 and is composed of a long WD-40 repeat domain that regulates Apaf-1 activation. Binding of Apaf-1 to cytochrome c in the presence of dATP exposes its N-terminal effector domain, which then mediates a homophillic CARD-CARD interaction with the prodomain of caspase-9, resulting in caspase oligomerization and activation (4Li P.

Biol. 1998; 8: 885-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggests that other CED-4/Apaf-1 family members likely exist in humans to coordinate downstream stress responses. We report here the identity and characterization of a novel human CED-4/Apaf-1 family member that activates NF-κB and apoptotic signaling pathways.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo identify novel human members of the CED-4/Apaf-1 family, we searched Millennium Pharmaceuticals' proprietary data base of expressed sequence tags (EST) for clones having sequence similarity to CARD motifs (6Hofmann K. Bucher P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 155-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). A CARD-encoding EST was identified and used to screen a human umbilical vein endothelial cell cDNA library for full-length clones. A single cDNA of approximately 3.5 kilobases contained an open reading frame encoding a protein of 953 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 108 kDa (Fig. 1A). This molecule was designated CARD4 because it was one of several CARD-containing proteins identified from the EST search. A BLAST search of protein data bases indicated that CARD4 was a new protein with at least three putative functional domains (Fig. 1, A and C). The N-terminal region of CARD4 (residues 14–104) shares significant sequence similarity with CARD motifs found in a variety of apoptotic signaling molecules, including those found in CED-4 and Apaf-1 (Fig. 1B). Contained within the central region of CARD4 (residues 199–398) is a NBS-like domain that shares approximately 33% sequence identity with the putative GTP-binding domain (residues 416–618) of CIITA, a transactivator of major histocompatibility complex class II genes (12Chin K.-C. Li G.G.-X. Ting J.P.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2239-2244Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Within this region of homology are several NBS consensus sequences, including kinase 1a (P-loop), 2, and 3a motifs that are also found within the NBS of CED-4 and Apaf-1 (13van der Biezen E.A. Jones J.D.G. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 226-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of CARD4 (residues 674–950) encodes at least 10 tandem leucine-rich repeats (LRR), a protein interaction motif found in a variety of proteins with diverse functions, including signal transduction (14Kajava A.V.J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 3: 519-527Crossref Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The 28-amino acid consensus sequence derived from the aligned LRRs of CARD4 belongs to the ribonuclease inhibitor-like subfamily of LRRs that are found exclusively in animal intracellular proteins. The CARD/NBS/LRR domain structure of CARD4 justifies its inclusion as a new member of the CED-4/Apaf-1 family of proteins (Fig. 1C). CARD4 is also structurally similar to members of the NBS/LRR class of plant disease resistance gene products whose N-terminal effector domains contain either a leucine zipper motif or a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor homology domain (15Baker B. Zambryski P. Staskawicz B. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Science. 1997; 276: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis revealed CARD4 to be constitutively expressed as a 4.5-kilobase transcript with abundant expression in adult heart, spleen, and lung tissues (Fig. 1D). CARD4 was also found to be expressed in a variety of cancer cell lines and fetal tissues (data not shown).By analogy to CED-4 and Apaf-1 proteins, the N-terminal CARD motif of CARD4 likely functions as an effector domain that mediates specific homophilic interactions with downstream CARD-containing signaling molecules. To gain insight into signaling pathways engaged by CARD4, we used its N-terminal CARD (residues 1–145) as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human breast cDNA library to identify CARD-containing interactors. From approximately 8 million transformants, 12 positive clones showing activation of hisand lacZ reporter genes were identified. Of these 12 interactors, six were partial-length cDNAs of RICK (RIP2, CARDIAK) (7Inohara N. del Paso L. Koseki T. Chen S. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 273: 12296-12300Google Scholar, 8McCarthy J.V. Ni J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16968-16975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 9Thome M. Hofmann K. Burns K. Martinon F. Bodmer J.L. Mattmann C. Tschopp J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 885-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a recently identified serine-threonine kinase that contains a C-terminal CARD motif (Fig. 2A). In similar screens of human prostate and brain cDNA libraries, approximately 30–40% of all positive clones were found to be RICK (data not shown). Interestingly, the CARD of CARD4 shows the most similarity (26% identity) with the corresponding domain in RICK when compared with the family of known CARD motifs (Fig. 1B). This interaction was mediated by the CARD of RICK because this domain alone (residues 435–540) was sufficient for binding to the bait (data not shown). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged RICK expressed in mammalian cells quantitatively coprecipitated CARD4 (Fig. 2B). This association was mediated specifically by the CARD motif of RICK, because CARD4 did not coprecipitate with a truncated form of RICK lacking its CARD (RICK/No CARD). Taken together, these results suggest that CARD4 selectively interacts with RICK through a homophilic CARD-CARD interaction.Figure 2CARD4 interacts with RICK.

B, immunopreciptation of CARD4 by RICK in mammalian cells. 293T cells were transfected with the indicated combination of expression constructs encoding HA-tagged CARD4, Myc-tagged RICK, Myc-tagged RICK/No CARD (residues 1–434), immunoprecipitated (IP) and immunoblotted (WB) with either HA or Myc antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Recent studies have shown that RICK activates NF-κB signaling pathways (8McCarthy J.V. Ni J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16968-16975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 9Thome M. Hofmann K. Burns K. Martinon F. Bodmer J.L. Mattmann C. Tschopp J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 885-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the putative N-terminal effector domain of CARD4 was found to interact with the CARD of RICK, we determined whether CARD4 can activate NF-κB signaling using a luciferase reporter gene directed by an NF-κB-responsive promoter. Expression of CARD4 in 293T cells potently induced NF-κB activity in a concentration-dependent manner; maximum induction of luciferase activity was 40-fold compared with control vector (Fig. 3A). Induction of NF-κB activity was not a general activity of CED-4/Apaf-1 family members because expression of Apaf-1 failed to activate this signaling pathway (Fig. 3B). Although RICK also activates the Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway (Ref. 9Thome M. Hofmann K. Burns K. Martinon F. Bodmer J.L. Mattmann C. Tschopp J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 885-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown), CARD4 expression in 293T cells failed to either induce phosphorylation of Jun N-terminal kinase or activate a luciferase reporter gene with AP-1 promoter elements (data not shown). We next determined the domains of CARD4 that mediate the induction of NF-κB activity (Fig. 3B). A C-terminal truncated mutant (CARD4–518) activated NF-κB at levels comparable with full-length CARD4, demonstrating that the LRR domain was not required for induction. The N-terminal CARD (CARD4-CARD), but not the NBS domain (CARD4-NBS), was found subsequently to be sufficient for induction, establishing the CARD motif as the NF-κB-activating domain of CARD4 (Fig. 3B). Induction of NF-κB activity by RICK is mediated in part by TRAF-6 and NIK kinase (8McCarthy J.V. Ni J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16968-16975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Dominant-negative versions of these molecules (TRAF6-DN and NIK-DN) were also found to inhibit induction when coexpressed with CARD4, suggesting that TRAF-6 and NIK act downstream of CARD4 to activate NF-κB (Fig. 3B). Conversely, coexpression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-XL had no effect on NF-κB induction. Coexpression of the CARD of RICK (RICK-DN) also functioned as a dominant-negative mutant, consistent with this molecule being a potential downstream mediator of CARD4 function.Figure 3Induction of NF-κB activity by CARD4. 293T cells were cotransfected with NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid (pNFκB-Luc, Stratagene), pCMV β-gal, and indicated expression constructs, and relative luciferase activities for each transfection were determined.

C, inhibition of CARD4 induction of NF-κB activity by dominant-negative versions of TRAF-6, NIK and RICK.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Besides having a role in NF-κB signaling, RICK also affects apoptotic signaling pathways by an unknown mechanism, because it increases apoptotic death induced by caspase-8 and caspase-10 and augments the processing of pro-caspase-1 (7Inohara N. del Paso L. Koseki T. Chen S. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 273: 12296-12300Google Scholar, 9Thome M. Hofmann K. Burns K. Martinon F. Bodmer J.L. Mattmann C. Tschopp J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 885-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Confirming the role of RICK as a general activator of caspases, we found that RICK coexpression also increases caspase-9 apoptotic activity (see below), even though RICK does not interact with caspase-9 (7Inohara N. del Paso L. Koseki T. Chen S. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 273: 12296-12300Google Scholar, 9Thome M. Hofmann K. Burns K. Martinon F. Bodmer J.L. Mattmann C. Tschopp J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 885-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether CARD4 coexpression increases apoptotic death induced by caspase-9. 293T cells expressing caspase-9 underwent apoptosis with rounding-up, membrane blebbing, and lifting off from the plate, thereby reducing the number of viable cells (Fig. 4A). In contrast, expression of CARD4, RICK, or Apaf-1 had no effect on cell viability when expressed alone. However, CARD4 coexpression increased the apoptotic death induced by caspase-9 at levels comparable with those observed with either RICK or Apaf-1 (Fig. 4B). This activity was mapped to the N-terminal CARD motif of CARD4 because coexpression of this domain alone was sufficient to increase apoptotic death induced by caspase-9 (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, CARD4 coexpression failed to increase apoptotic death induced by caspase-8, suggesting that the enhancing activity was specific for caspase-9-mediated apoptosis (data not shown).Figure 4CARD4 augmentation of a caspase-9 apoptotic activity. 293T cells were cotransfected with pCMV β-gal and indicated expression constructs.

Our finding that CARD4 interacts with RICK through a homophilic CARD-CARD interaction implicates the serine-threonine kinase as a potential downstream mediator of CARD4 signaling. It is possible, however, that other CARD-containing molecules are responsible for mediating CARD4 function in 293T cells. Although a role for the C-terminal LRRs remains uncertain, it is likely that this domain functions in a manner analogous to the Apaf-1 WD-40 domain to mediate CARD4 activation by upstream signaling molecules. Our finding that CARD4 also displays structural similarity to the NBS/LRR class of plant disease resistance gene products is intriguing. NBS/LRR-containing plant proteins initiate a complex defense response to pathogen infection, including changes in gene expression and localized cell death (15Baker B. Zambryski P. Staskawicz B. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Science. 1997; 276: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Interestingly, tomato resistance response to bacterial speck disease involves both an NBS/LRR protein and a serine-threonine kinase. Recent studies suggest that plant defense mechanisms activated in response to pathogen infection are analogous to the innate immune response of vertebrates and insects (16O'Neil L.A.J. Greene C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). CARD4 may therefore be a component of the innate immune response that transduces upstream stress or pathogen signals to the activation of NF-κB and apoptotic signaling pathways. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is an evolutionarily conserved process of cell suicide critical for normal development and elimination of pathogen-infected cells (1Vaux D.L. Strasser A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2239-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar).

A single cDNA of approximately 3.5 kilobases contained an open reading frame encoding a protein of 953 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 108 kDa (Fig. 1A). This molecule was designated CARD4 because it was one of several CARD-containing proteins identified from the EST search. A BLAST search of protein data bases indicated that CARD4 was a new protein with at least three putative functional domains (Fig. 1, A and C). The N-terminal region of CARD4 (residues 14–104) shares significant sequence similarity with CARD motifs found in a variety of apoptotic signaling molecules, including those found in CED-4 and Apaf-1 (Fig. 1B). Contained within the central region of CARD4 (residues 199–398) is a NBS-like domain that shares approximately 33% sequence identity with the putative GTP-binding domain (residues 416–618) of CIITA, a transactivator of major histocompatibility complex class II genes (12Chin K.-C. Li G.G.-X. Ting J.P.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2239-2244Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Within this region of homology are several NBS consensus sequences, including kinase 1a (P-loop), 2, and 3a motifs that are also found within the NBS of CED-4 and Apaf-1 (13van der Biezen E.A. Jones J.D.G. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 226-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of CARD4 (residues 674–950) encodes at least 10 tandem leucine-rich repeats (LRR), a protein interaction motif found in a variety of proteins with diverse functions, including signal transduction (14Kajava A.V.J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 3: 519-527Crossref Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The 28-amino acid consensus sequence derived from the aligned LRRs of CARD4 belongs to the ribonuclease inhibitor-like subfamily of LRRs that are found exclusively in animal intracellular proteins. The CARD/NBS/LRR domain structure of CARD4 justifies its inclusion as a new member of the CED-4/Apaf-1 family of proteins (Fig. 1C). CARD4 is also structurally similar to members of the NBS/LRR class of plant disease resistance gene products whose N-terminal effector domains contain either a leucine zipper motif or a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor homology domain (15Baker B. Zambryski P. Staskawicz B. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Science. 1997; 276: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis revealed CARD4 to be constitutively expressed as a 4.5-kilobase transcript with abundant expression in adult heart, spleen, and lung tissues (Fig. 1D). CARD4 was also found to be expressed in a variety of cancer cell lines and fetal tissues (data not shown).By analogy to CED-4 and Apaf-1 proteins, the N-terminal CARD motif of CARD4 likely functions as an effector domain that mediates specific homophilic interactions with downstream CARD-containing signaling molecules. To gain insight into signaling pathways engaged by CARD4, we used its N-terminal CARD (residues 1–145) as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human breast cDNA library to identify CARD-containing interactors. From approximately 8 million transformants, 12 positive clones showing activation of hisand lacZ reporter genes were identified. Of these 12 interactors, six were partial-length cDNAs of RICK (RIP2, CARDIAK) (7Inohara N. del Paso L. Koseki T. Chen S. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 273: 12296-12300Google Scholar, 8McCarthy J.V. Ni J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16968-16975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 9Thome M. Hofmann K. Burns K. Martinon F. Bodmer J.L. Mattmann C. Tschopp J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 885-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a recently identified serine-threonine kinase that contains a C-terminal CARD motif (Fig. 2A). In similar screens of human prostate and brain cDNA libraries, approximately 30–40% of all positive clones were found to be RICK (data not shown). Interestingly, the CARD of CARD4 shows the most similarity (26% identity) with the corresponding domain in RICK when compared with the family of known CARD motifs (Fig. 1B). This interaction was mediated by the CARD of RICK because this domain alone (residues 435–540) was sufficient for binding to the bait (data not shown). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged RICK expressed in mammalian cells quantitatively coprecipitated CARD4 (Fig. 2B). This association was mediated specifically by the CARD motif of RICK, because CARD4 did not coprecipitate with a truncated form of RICK lacking its CARD (RICK/No CARD). Taken together, these results suggest that CARD4 selectively interacts with RICK through a homophilic CARD-CARD interaction.Recent studies have shown that RICK activates NF-κB signaling pathways (8McCarthy J.V. Ni J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16968-16975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 9Thome M. Hofmann K. Burns K. Martinon F. Bodmer J.L. Mattmann C. Tschopp J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 885-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the putative N-terminal effector domain of CARD4 was found to interact with the CARD of RICK, we determined whether CARD4 can activate NF-κB signaling using a luciferase reporter gene directed by an NF-κB-responsive promoter. Expression of CARD4 in 293T cells potently induced NF-κB activity in a concentration-dependent manner; maximum induction of luciferase activity was 40-fold compared with control vector (Fig. 3A). Induction of NF-κB activity was not a general activity of CED-4/Apaf-1 family members because expression of Apaf-1 failed to activate this signaling pathway (Fig. 3B). Although RICK also activates the Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway (Ref. 9Thome M. Hofmann K. Burns K. Martinon F. Bodmer J.L. Mattmann C. Tschopp J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 885-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown), CARD4 expression in 293T cells failed to either induce phosphorylation of Jun N-terminal kinase or activate a luciferase reporter gene with AP-1 promoter elements (data not shown). We next determined the domains of CARD4 that mediate the induction of NF-κB activity (Fig. 3B). A C-terminal truncated mutant (CARD4–518) activated NF-κB at levels comparable with full-length CARD4, demonstrating that the LRR domain was not required for induction. The N-terminal CARD (CARD4-CARD), but not the NBS domain (CARD4-NBS), was found subsequently to be sufficient for induction, establishing the CARD motif as the NF-κB-activating domain of CARD4 (Fig. 3B). Induction of NF-κB activity by RICK is mediated in part by TRAF-6 and NIK kinase (8McCarthy J.V. Ni J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16968-16975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Dominant-negative versions of these molecules (TRAF6-DN and NIK-DN) were also found to inhibit induction when coexpressed with CARD4, suggesting that TRAF-6 and NIK act downstream of CARD4 to activate NF-κB (Fig. 3B). Conversely, coexpression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-XL had no effect on NF-κB induction. Coexpression of the CARD of RICK (RICK-DN) also functioned as a dominant-negative mutant, consistent with this molecule being a potential downstream mediator of CARD4 function.Figure 3Induction of NF-κB activity by CARD4. 293T cells were cotransfected with NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid (pNFκB-Luc, Stratagene), pCMV β-gal, and indicated expression constructs, and relative luciferase activities for each transfection were determined.

Koseki T. Chen S. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 273: 12296-12300Google Scholar, 9Thome M. Hofmann K. Burns K. Martinon F. Bodmer J.L. Mattmann C. Tschopp J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 885-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Confirming the role of RICK as a general activator of caspases, we found that RICK coexpression also increases caspase-9 apoptotic activity (see below), even though RICK does not interact with caspase-9 (7Inohara N. del Paso L. Koseki T. Chen S. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 273: 12296-12300Google Scholar, 9Thome M. Hofmann K. Burns K. Martinon F. Bodmer J.L. Mattmann C. Tschopp J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 885-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether CARD4 coexpression increases apoptotic death induced by caspase-9. 293T cells expressing caspase-9 underwent apoptosis with rounding-up, membrane blebbing, and lifting off from the plate, thereby reducing the number of viable cells (Fig. 4A). In contrast, expression of CARD4, RICK, or Apaf-1 had no effect on cell viability when expressed alone. However, CARD4 coexpression increased the apoptotic death induced by caspase-9 at levels comparable with those observed with either RICK or Apaf-1 (Fig. 4B). This activity was mapped to the N-terminal CARD motif of CARD4 because coexpression of this domain alone was sufficient to increase apoptotic death induced by caspase-9 (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, CARD4 coexpression failed to increase apoptotic death induced by caspase-8, suggesting that the enhancing activity was specific for caspase-9-mediated apoptosis (data not shown).Figure 4CARD4 augmentation of a caspase-9 apoptotic activity. 293T cells were cotransfected with pCMV β-gal and indicated expression constructs.

Our finding that CARD4 interacts with RICK through a homophilic CARD-CARD interaction implicates the serine-threonine kinase as a potential downstream mediator of CARD4 signaling. It is possible, however, that other CARD-containing molecules are responsible for mediating CARD4 function in 293T cells. Although a role for the C-terminal LRRs remains uncertain, it is likely that this domain functions in a manner analogous to the Apaf-1 WD-40 domain to mediate CARD4 activation by upstream signaling molecules. Our finding that CARD4 also displays structural similarity to the NBS/LRR class of plant disease resistance gene products is intriguing. NBS/LRR-containing plant proteins initiate a complex defense response to pathogen infection, including changes in gene expression and localized cell death (15Baker B. Zambryski P. Staskawicz B. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Science. 1997; 276: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Interestingly, tomato resistance response to bacterial speck disease involves both an NBS/LRR protein and a serine-threonine kinase. Recent studies suggest that plant defense mechanisms activated in response to pathogen infection are analogous to the innate immune response of vertebrates and insects (16O'Neil L.A.J. Greene C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). CARD4 may therefore be a component of the innate immune response that transduces upstream stress or pathogen signals to the activation of NF-κB and apoptotic signaling pathways. To identify novel human members of the CED-4/Apaf-1 family, we searched Millennium Pharmaceuticals' proprietary data base of expressed sequence tags (EST) for clones having sequence similarity to CARD motifs (6Hofmann K. Bucher P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 155-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2053514414,"The ability of the GroEL chaperonin to unfold a protein trapped in a misfolded condition was detected and studied by hydrogen exchange. The GroEL-induced unfolding of its substrate protein is only partial, requires the complete chaperonin system, and is accomplished within the 13 seconds required for a single system turnover. The binding of nucleoside triphosphate provides the energy for a single unfolding event; multiple turnovers require adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis. The substrate protein is released on each turnover even if it has not yet refolded to the native state. These results suggest that GroEL helps partly folded but blocked proteins to fold by causing them first to partially unfold. The structure of GroEL seems well suited to generate the nonspecific mechanical stretching force required for forceful protein unfolding."

The formation of this sensory map in the accessory olfactory bulb and the survival of vomeronasal organ sensory neurons require the expression of pheromone receptors. In addition, we observe individual glomeruli in the accessory olfactory bulb that receive input from more than one type of sensory neuron.

https://openalex.org/W1973201036,"Articulated digital reconstructions of two diplodocid sauropods revealed cervical poses and feeding envelopes. The necks of Diplodocus and Apatosaurus were nearly straight but gently declined such that the heads, which were themselves angled downward relative to the neck, were close to ground level in their neutral, undeflected posture. Both necks were less flexible than conventionally depicted, and Diplodocus was less capable of lateral and dorsal curvature than Apatosaurus. The results suggest that these sauropods were adapted to ground feeding or low browsing, contrary to the view that diplodocid sauropods were high browsers."
https://openalex.org/W2050372813,"Inferences of the chemical homogeneity of Earth's mantle depend on comparing laboratory-derived equations of state of mantle phases with seismically determined properties of the material in situ. A uniform chemical composition of the entire mantle has been found to be consistent with measurements, to date, of these properties for the end-member MgSiO 3 perovskite phase. New pressure-volume-temperature data for silicate perovskite containing 5 mole percent Al 2 O 3 has yielded different values of the equation of state parameters, with the bulk modulus being significantly smaller at lower mantle conditions than for aluminum-free perovskite, thus requiring adjustments in other components to match seismic observations."

The simulation suggests a variety of competing phases, with a more facile transformation of the molecular phase at high temperatures. Thermodynamically, the most stable carbonate phase at high pressure is predicted to be isostructural to SiO 2 α-quartz (low quartz). A class of carbonates, involving special arrangements of CO 4 tetrahedra, is found to be more stable than all the other silica-like polymorphs."

These genes fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae (UGT51 =YLR189C), Pichia pastoris(UGT51B1), Candida albicans(UGT51C1), and Dictyostelium discoideum(ugt52) were expressed in Escherichia coli. In vitro enzyme assays with cell-free extracts of the transgenicE. coli strains showed that the genes encode UDP-glucose:sterol glucosyltransferases which can use different sterols such as cholesterol, sitosterol, and ergosterol as sugar acceptors. AnS. cerevisiae null mutant of UGT51 had lost its ability to synthesize sterol glucoside but exhibited normal growth under various culture conditions. Expression of eitherUGT51 or UGT51B1 in this null mutant under the control of a galactose-induced promoter restored sterol glucoside synthesis in vitro.

The basis for studies on the functions of sterol glycosides is the assumption that free sterols and sterol glycosides differ physiologically. It is obvious that the attachment of a glycosyl moiety to the sterol backbone alters the physical properties of this lipid. As a result, there are changes in the properties of membranes containing different proportions of free sterols and sterol glycosides. Such changes have been studied with artificial membranes in terms of membrane fluidity, permeability, hydration, and phase behavior (41Grunwald C.

However, we still do not know how free sterols and sterol glycosides differ physiologically in biological membranes and why many eukaryotic organisms synthesize sterol glycosides. One of the main reasons for our limited knowledge in this field is the lack of a genetic approach. The objective of the present work was the isolation and characterization of sterol glycosyltransferase genes from eukaryotic organisms. We expect that genetic manipulation of these genes will facilitate the elucidation of sterol glycoside functions in these organisms.The predominating sugar moiety in sterol glycosides is glucose. Besides plants, UDP-glucose:sterol glucosyltransferase activity was determined by in vitro enzyme assays in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (45Lehle L. Eur. J.

The expression level of sterol glucosyltransferase gene(s) seems to be so low that very sensitive radioactive assays are required to detect enzyme activity in vitro. However, expression is too low for accumulation of a significant amount of SG in vivo suitable for lipid analysis. Another possibility is the existence of a sterol glucoside hydrolase that counteracts the sterol glucosyltransferase keeping the amount of SG very low. Such a hydrolase has been detected in plants (52Kalinowska M. Wojciechowski Z.A. Phytochemistry. 1986; 25: 45-49Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 53Bouvier-Nave P. Benveniste P.

The UGT51 genes fromC. albicans, Pichia pastoris, and UGT52 fromD. discoideum were cloned by either homology probing or PCR-based strategies. Moreover, we identified ergosterol as an in vivo substrate for the sterol glucosyltransferases from S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris. Furthermore, a new glycolipid was identified in S. cerevisiae as the product of the in vivo action of the yeast sterol glucosyltransferase from P. pastoris.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial and Saccharomyces Strains and PlasmidsEscherichia coli strains XL1-Blue (MRF′) (Stratagene), BL21(DE3) (Novagen), TOP10 (Invitrogen), and the vectors pGEM-T (Promega), pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), pET19b (Novagen), and pBAD-TOPO (Invitrogen) were used for cloning and expression of different fragments of the sterol glucosyltransferase genes. Yeast strains used in this study were UTL-7A (MATa, ura3-52, trp1, leu2-3,112) and Δugt51 (MATa, ura3-52, trp1, leu2-3, 112, ugt51::kanMX4; this study). Expression of different UGT genes in S. cerevisiae was performed with pYES2 (Invitrogen) and pGAL4 (this study). For the construction of pGAL4, the XbaI/BamHI fragment of pTerm1 (58Erdmann R.

The GAL1 promoter was excised withXbaI/PvuII and subcloned intoXbaI/HincII-restricted pBluescript KS+. The resulting plasmid was designated pGAL2. Subcloning of theXhoI/SacI fragment of pGAL2 into pYES2.0 resulted in pGAL3. The KpnI/XhoI fragment of pGAL3 comprised the GAL1 promoter, and it was subcloned in front of the CYC1 terminator of pRS316t resulting in pGAL4.Media and Growth of Bacteria and SaccharomycesE. coli was grown in Luria-Bertani broth (LB, Duchefa, Haarlem, The Netherlands).

We isolated a genomic 6359-bp NdeI/SpeI DNA fragment containingUGT51 by restriction digestion of cosmid 9470 DNA that we received from the American Type Culture Collection. This fragment was cloned into pBluescript II KS giving the plasmid pUGT51g. This plasmid was used to clone the open reading frame (ORF) UGT51 into expression vectors for E. coli (pET19b → pUGT51x) and S. cerevisiae (pGAL4 → pUGT51xy). In addition, PCR fragments of UGT51 corresponding to polypeptides with N-terminal or C-terminal deletions of amino acids were cloned into the following plasmids: pN690x, pN722x, pN799x, pC1043x, and pN722xy.C. albicansPCR with genomic DNA of C. albicanswas performed with the primer DW3 5′-GSI WCI VGI GGI GAY GTH CAR CC-3′ and WA3 5′-GTI GTI CCI SHI CCI SCR TGR TG-3′.

Cells were grown at 30 °C in 25 ml of LB medium containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin to an absorbance between 0.5 and 0.8 at 600 nm. Induction was performed by adding 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (for BL21(DE3) with pET19b plasmids) or 0.1% arabinose (for TOP10 with pBAD TOPO plasmids) and further incubation for 2–4 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (10 min, 2000 × g, 20 °C), resuspended in 1–2 ml of buffer (100 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, 15% glycerol, 5 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol, 200 μm Pefabloc (Serva), 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme), and incubated for 5 min at 20 °C. Cells were cooled in an ice bath, and cell disruption was performed by ultrasonication (probe tip, 6 × 10 s). If necessary, a crude membrane fraction was prepared by centrifugation of the cell homogenate at 4 °C for 20 min at 25,000 × g and resuspension of the sediment with buffer. This procedure was repeated once.S. cerevisiaeYeast cells were grown at 30 °C in 100 ml of the defined medium described above to an absorbance (A 600) between 2 and 6. The medium was supplemented with 2% raffinose and 1% galactose (instead of glucose) when the vectors pGAL4 or pYES2 were used. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (10 min, 2000 × g, 20 °C), resuspended in 2 ml of buffer (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 15% glycerol, 5 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol, 200 μm Pefabloc (Serva), 0.5 mg/ml lyticase from Sigma), and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. 2–3 g of glass beads (inner diameter, 0.4 mm) were added, and cells were disrupted by vortexing for 16 × 30 s.Sterol Glucosyltransferase AssayThe assay mixture contained in a total volume of 100 μl the following: 80 μl of E. coli or S. cerevisiaecell homogenate or membrane fraction, respectively, either 10 μl of a solution of 4 mm cholesterol in ethanol (400 μm final concentration) or 8 μl of 500,000 dpm [4-14C]cholesterol in ethanol (final concentration 45 μm, specific activity 1.85 GBq/mmol), and either 100,000 dpm UDP-[U-14C]glucose (final concentration 1.5 μm, specific activity 10.8 GBq/mmol) or 360 μm unlabeled UDP-glucose. After incubating for 2 h at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.9 ml of 0.45% NaCl solution and 4 ml of chloroform/methanol, 2:1. The extracted lipids were separated by thin layer chromatography with chloroform/methanol (85:15, v/v). The radioactivity on the silica gel plate was detected by radioscanning with a BAS-1000 BioImaging Analyzer (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany).Lipid Extraction and AnalysisS. cerevisiae cells were grown at 30 °C on defined, lipid-free media described above. Harvesting of the cells by centrifugation was followed by the extraction of lipids with chloroform/methanol, 1:2, and chloroform/methanol, 2:1. The extracted lipids were separated by thin layer chromatography on silica gel 60 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) with chloroform/methanol, 85:15. Glycolipids were visualized with a spray of α-naphthol/sulfuric acid mixture. For nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, the novel glycolipid was purified by column chromatography on silica gel by elution with acetone. The lipid was acetylated with acetic anhydride in pyridine and subjected to preparative thin layer chromatography in diethyl ether.Mass SpectrometryMass spectrometric analysis of the peracetylated sterol glycoside was carried out with a Hewlett-Packard model 5989 spectrometer using the direct insert probe mode. Temperature was raised from 80 to 325 °C at a rate of 30 °C/min. EI-mass spectra were recorded at 70 eV with an ion source temperature of 200 °C.Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) SpectroscopyNMR spectra of the peracetylated glycoside (200 μg) were recorded at 300 K in CDCl3 (99.96%, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) for 1H NMR at 600 MHz (Avance DRX-600 spectrometer) and for 13C NMR at 90.6 MHz (DPX 360) (Bruker, Germany).

One- and two-dimensional homonuclear (1H, 1H COSY, relayed COSY) and 1H-detected heteronuclear1H,13C multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) experiments were performed using standard Bruker software (XWINNMR, version 1.3).The nucleotide sequences of the sterol glucosyltransferases have been deposited in the GenBankTM data base under accession numbers AF091398 (C. albicans), AF098916 (D. discoideum), and AF091397 (P. pastoris).DISCUSSIONThis work reports the cloning, identification, and characterization of novel UDP-glucose:sterol glucosyltransferases fromS. cerevisiae, C. albicans, P. pastoris, and D. discoideum. We also isolated a sterol glucoside from transgenic S. cerevisiae expressingUGT51B1 from P. pastoris. This is the first report on the structural analysis of a glycosylated sterol fromS. cerevisiae which we identified as ergosterol-β-d-glucoside. These data prove thatUGT51B1 encodes a UDP-glucose:sterol β-d-glucosyltransferase. Combined with in vitro data on the substrate specificities of the identified glucosyltransferases from different organisms, we assume that all the recombinant enzymes that we characterized in this work are sterol β-d-glucosyltransferases. The enzymes show a narrow specificity for the sugar donor using predominantly UDP-glucose. In contrast, the in vitro specificity for the sterol acceptor is broad, pointing to the biosynthesis of glucosyl sterols with different sterol moieties depending on the individual sterol composition of each organism.The isolation of novel sterol glucosyltransferases represents one step in our approach to elucidate the functions of sterol"
https://openalex.org/W2092559486,"The proteoglycans of animal cells typically contain one or more heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate chains. These glycosaminoglycans assemble on a tetrasaccharide primer, -GlcAβ1,3Galβ1,3Galβ1,4Xylβ-O-, attached to specific serine residues in the core protein. Studies of Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants defective in the first or second enzymes of the pathway (xylosyltransferase and galactosyltransferase I) show that the assembly of the primer occurs by sequential transfer of single monosaccharide residues from the corresponding high energy nucleotide sugar donor to the non-reducing end of the growing chain. In order to study the other reactions involved in linkage tetrasaccharide assembly, we have devised a powerful selection method based on induced resistance to a mitotoxin composed of basic fibroblast growth factor-saporin. One class of mutants does not incorporate 35SO4 and [6-3H]GlcN into glycosaminoglycan chains. Incubation of these cells with naphthol-β-d-xyloside (Xylβ-O-Np) resulted in accumulation of linkage region intermediates containing 1 or 2 mol of galactose (Galβ1, 4Xylβ-O-Np and Galβ1, 3Galβ1, 4Xylβ-O-Np) and sialic acid (Siaα2,3Galβ1, 3Galβ1, 4Xylβ-O-Np) but not any GlcA-containing oligosaccharides.

The mutation most likely lies in the structural gene encoding GlcAT-I since transfection of the mutant with a cDNA for GlcAT-I completely restored enzyme activity and glycosaminoglycan synthesis.

The assembly of the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), 1The abbreviation used is: GAG, glycosaminoglycan; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FGF2-SAP, basic fibroblast growth factor-saporin-6 chimera; GlcAT-I, UDP-glucuronic acid:Galβ1,3Gal-R glucuronosyltransferase; GlcAT-P, UDP-glucuronic acid:glycoprotein glucuronosyltransferase; MOPS, 3-[N-morpholino]propanesulfonic acid; XylT, xylosyltransferase; GalT-I, galactosyltransferase I.1The abbreviation used is: GAG, glycosaminoglycan; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FGF2-SAP, basic fibroblast growth factor-saporin-6 chimera; GlcAT-I, UDP-glucuronic acid:Galβ1,3Gal-R glucuronosyltransferase; GlcAT-P, UDP-glucuronic acid:glycoprotein glucuronosyltransferase; MOPS, 3-[N-morpholino]propanesulfonic acid; XylT, xylosyltransferase; GalT-I, galactosyltransferase I. heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, initiates by the transfer of xylose to specific serine residues in core proteins, which then gives rise to the so-called linkage tetrasaccharide, GlcAβ1,3Galβ1,3Galβ1,4Xylβ-O-Ser (1Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1980: 267-271Crossref Google Scholar). In some proteoglycans, the linkage tetrasaccharide undergoes phosphorylation at C-2 of xylose (2Oegema Jr., T.R. Kraft E.L. Jourdain G.W. Van, Valen T.R. J. Biol.

Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1175-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The linkage tetrasaccharide serves as a primer for the formation of heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate chains, which initiate by the attachment of either GlcNAc or GalNAc, respectively (14Rohrmann K. Niemann R. Buddecke E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 15Fritz T.A. Gabb M.M. Wei G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28809-28814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chains then assemble by the alternating addition of GlcA and GlcNAc (heparan sulfate) or GlcA and GalNAc (chondroitin sulfate). During polymerization, the chains undergo a series of modification reactions that include N-deacetylation and N-sulfation of GlcNAc residues, epimerization of some GlcA residues to iduronic acid, and addition of sulfate groups at various positions (1Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1980: 267-271Crossref Google Scholar). The arrangement of sulfated and non-sulfated residues and the uronic acid epimers gives rise to specific binding sites for various protein ligands (reviewed in Refs. 16Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R.

Recent reports claim that multiple copolymerases forming the heparan sulfate backbone may exist as well (29Lind T. Tufaro F. McCormick C. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol.

Since the enzymatic properties of the isozymes may differ in subtle ways (27Liu J. Shworak N.W. Sinay P. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L. Fritze L.M. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol.

In contrast to the amount of information available for these late reactions, relatively little is known about the structure and expression of the transferases that act early in the pathway (1Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1980: 267-271Crossref Google Scholar). Mutational studies of GAG assembly in Chinese hamster ovary cells have shown that mutants in the first two steps (catalyzed by xylosyltransferase (XylT) and galactosyltransferase I (GalT-I)) fail to make both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate chains (38Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 39Esko J.D. Weinke J.L. Taylor W.H. Ekborg G. Rodén L. Anantharamaiah G.

This finding suggests that a single set of enzymes catalyze the biosynthesis of the linkage region, without regard to the eventual composition of the chain. To obtain information about other enzymes involved in linkage region formation, we have developed a powerful selection and screening method to find mutants in these reactions. One new class of mutants does not synthesize glycosaminoglycan chains due to a deficiency of glucuronosyltransferase I (GlcAT-I). Like mutants defective in XylT or GalT-I, the new mutants fail to make both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, suggesting that each of the early steps in linkage region formation is catalyzed by a single isozyme. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CCL-61, Rockville, MD). Mutants pgsA-745 (xylosyltransferase-deficient) and pgsB-761 (galactosyltransferase I-deficient) were characterized previously (38Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar,39Esko J.D. Weinke J.L. Taylor W.H. Ekborg G. Rodén L. Anantharamaiah G. Gawish A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12189-12195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air and 100% relative humidity in Ham's F-12 growth medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 7.5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories), 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 units/ml penicillin G. Defined F-12 medium was prepared from individual components (41Ham R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 53: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), substituting chloride salts for sulfate, and supplemented with fetal bovine serum that had been dialyzed 106-fold against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (42Dulbecco R. Vogt M. J. Exp. Med. 1954; 99: 167-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). Low glucose medium containing 1 mm instead of 10 mmglucose was used for labeling cells with radioactive sugars. Deprivation of the cells for sulfate and glucose in this way had no effect on GAG composition but raised the level of radiolabeling by 10-fold or more. Wild-type CHO cells were mutagenized with ethylmethanesulfonate and frozen under liquid nitrogen (43Esko J.D. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 32: 387-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A portion of cells was thawed, propagated for 3 days, and used to screen for mutants. Approximately 1 × 105 mutagen-treated cells were added to multiple 100-mm diameter tissue culture dishes filled with complete growth medium containing 2 μg/ml FGF2-SAP, a recombinant chimera consisting of FGF2 fused to the plant cytotoxin saporin-6 (Selective Genetics, Inc., La Jolla, (44Lappi D.A. Ying W. Barthelemy I. Martineau D. Prieto I. Benatti L. Soria M. Baird A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12552-12558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 1 day, the cells were overlaid with a stack of polyester disks and glass beads in order to generate colony replicas (43Esko J.D. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 32: 387-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The plates were incubated at 37 °C, and the FGF2-SAP-containing medium was changed every 4 days. Under these conditions, 50–100 colonies arose on each plate after ∼10 days. The disks were then removed from the plates and transferred to a fresh plate containing sulfate-deficient medium supplemented with 10 μCi/ml 35SO4. After 4 h incubation at 37 °C, radiolabeled proteoglycans in each colony were precipitated by incubating the disks in a few milliliters of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The disks were washed by replacing the solution three times with 2% trichloroacetic acid and then water. After staining the colonies with Coomassie Blue (43Esko J.D. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 32: 387-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the disks were dried and exposed to x-ray film (Fuji). Tentative mutants were identified as blue-stained colonies that failed to incorporate35SO4. Candidates were picked from the original master plates using cloning cylinders and trypsin (43Esko J.D. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 32: 387-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). While the disks were being screening, the master plates were stored at 33 °C filled with complete F-12 growth medium supplemented with 2.5 μg/ml Fungizone and 10 units/ml Nystatin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Complementation tests were carried out by cell hybridization (43Esko J.D. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 32: 387-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Approximately 2 × 105cells of each strain were added to individual wells of a 24-well plate along with an equal number of pgsA-745 or pgsB-761 cells. After overnight incubation, the mixed cell monolayers were treated for 1 min with 50% (w/w) polyethylene glycol (M r = 3350) in F-12 medium. The cells were incubated for 1 day, replated in 100 mm-diameter tissue culture dishes to obtain ∼300 colonies per dish, and then overlaid with polyester cloth. The replica-plated colonies were incubated with35SO4 as described above. Complementation was assessed by the appearance of colonies that regained the capacity to incorporate 35SO4 into acid-precipitable material, as judged by autoradiography. Cells were labeled for 24 h with 10 μCi/ml Na35SO4 (25–40 Ci/mg, NEN Life Science Products) in growth medium containing serum or with 10 μCi/ml d-[6-3H]glucosamine HCl (40 Ci/nmol, NEN Life Science Products) in low glucose medium. Radiolabeled GAG chains were isolated as described (45Bame K.J. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8059-8065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed by anion-exchange high pressure liquid chromatography using a 7.5-mm diameter × 7.5-cm column of DEAE-3SW (Tosohaas, Montgomeryville, PA). The column was equilibrated in 10 mmKH2P04 buffer (pH 6.0) containing 0.2% (w/v) Zwittergent 3-12 and 0.2 m NaCl. GAGs were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0.2–1 m) in the same buffer using a flow rate of 1 ml/min and by increasing the NaCl concentration by 10 mm/min. The effluent from the column was monitored for radioactivity with an in-line radioactivity detector (Radiomatic Flo one/beta, Packard Instruments) with sampling rates every 6 s and data averaged over 1 min. CHO cells were grown to near confluence and then incubated with low glucose F-12 medium supplemented with different concentrations of naphthol-β-d-xyloside (46Fritz T.A. Lugemwa F.N. Sarkar A.K. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 300-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 20 μCi/ml d-[6-3H]galactose (34.6 Ci/mmol) (NEN Life Science Products). After 4 h incubation, the medium was collected, centrifuged to remove floating cells, adjusted to 0.5m NaCl, and applied to Sep-Pak Vac C18-cartridges (Waters, 100 mg). The cartridges were washed with 10–25 ml of deionized water, and bound material was eluted with 50% methanol and dried. The cell layers were rinsed three times with PBS and lysed in 0.1 n NaOH. An aliquot was taken for protein assay using a kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as standard. The dried samples were resuspended in 2 mmTris base and separated on a 0.5-ml column of QAE-Sephadex (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 2 mm Tris base and packed into a disposable 1-ml pipette tip. The flow-through and wash fraction (10 ml of 2 mm Tris base) were collected as neutral products (47Roux L. Holojda S. Sundblad G. Freeze H.H. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8879-8889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the bound material (charged products) was eluted with 0.4 m NaCl in 2 mm Tris base. The fractions were desalted and concentrated on Sep-Pak C18cartridges. The oligosaccharides were characterized by treating samples with various enzymes at 37 °C in a final volume of 25–100 μl. Neutral species were incubated for 4 and 24 h with 5 milliunits of β-galactosidase (bovine testes, Oxford Glycosystems) in 0.1m citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 4.0). Charged materials were treated with (i) 10 milliunits of sialidase (Arthrobacter ureafaciens, Oxford Glycosystems) for 16 h in 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0); some samples were desialylated by boiling in 10 mm HCl for 30 min; (ii) 100 units of β-glucuronidase (bovine liver, Sigma) overnight in 100 mmsodium acetate (pH 5.0) buffer containing 0.3 m NaCl and 8 mm d-galactonic acid γ-lactone to inhibit contaminating β-galactosidase activity; and (iii) 1 milliunit of α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (chicken liver, Oxford Glycosystems) overnight in 0.1 m citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 4.0). In some samples, the incubation was adjusted to pH 5.0 and incubated with β-glucuronidase as described above. After enzymatic treatment, samples were boiled for 10 min, dissolved in 200 μl of water, and injected into a reverse phase C18 column (Tosohaas RP18, 4.6 mm × 25 cm) connected to Rainin HPXL solvent delivery system. The column was first washed with water (flow rate 0.5 ml/min) and then with increasing concentrations of acetonitrile in water. Radioactivity in the eluate was monitored by Radiomatic Flo-one Beta detector connected in line to the column. Some samples were analyzed by QAE-Sephadex anion-exchange chromatography FGF2 (0.5 mg, Escherichia coli recombinant material, Selective Genetics, Inc.) was protected with heparin (0.4 mg) in 0.2 m HEPES buffer (pH 8.4) and mixed with biotin hydrazide (Pierce Chemical, Long arm, water-soluble, 40 μg) in a final volume of 0.2 ml. After 2 h at room temperature, 40 μl of 10 mg/ml glycine solution was added to stop the reaction. The sample was diluted with 30 ml of 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 m NaCl and 0.2% bovine serum albumin and loaded onto a 1-ml column of heparin-Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed with 30 ml of buffer and eluted with 2.5 ml of solution adjusted to 3 mNaCl. The sample was desalted on a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Inclusion of125I-FGF2 (∼4 × 105 cpm, Ref. 48Bai X. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17711-17717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) showed that the overall recovery of material was 30–40%. A cDNA for glucuronosyltransferase I (GlcAT-I) was cloned from CHO cells and inserted into pCDNA3 (49Wei G. Bai X.M. Sarkar A.K. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7857-7864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Mutant cells were transfected using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and stable transfectants were selected with geneticin (G418). Drug-resistant colonies were isolated and further characterized by measuring the binding of biotinylated FGF2 in the following way. Cells were detached with 5 mm EDTA in PBS, washed twice with 10 ml of PBS, and resuspended in 0.2 ml of F-12 medium containing ∼0.5 μg/ml biotin-FGF2 and 1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with constant shaking, washed twice with 0.5 ml of cold 20 mm NaH2PO4(pH 7.4) buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, and resuspended in 0.2 ml of buffer containing 5 μg/ml fluorescein/avidin/DCS (Vector Laboratories). After shaking the cells in the dark at 4 °C for 20 min, they were washed and resuspended in cold phosphate buffer. Cell sorting was done on a FACS Star Sorter (Becton Dickinson) and strongly positive clones were picked for further analysis. mRNA was isolated from mutant and wild-type cells using QuickPrep Micro mRNA Purification Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The mRNA was denatured at 65 °C in a solution of 50% (v/v) formamide, 6% (v/v) formaldehyde, and 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0) and separated on a 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel containing 6% (v/v) formaldehyde. The gels were blotted for 18 h onto a Nytran plus nylon membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The blotted RNA was fixed by UV-catalyzed cross-linking and prehybridized for 2 h at 42 °C in a solution containing 50% formamide, 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 5× SSC, 1× Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, 5% dextran sulfate, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. A double-stranded DNA probe was labeled with [32P]dCTP with random oligonucleotide primers (Prime-IT II labeling kit, Stratagene) using the GlcAT-I cDNA (1.5 kilobase pairs) as template (49Wei G. Bai X.M. Sarkar A.K. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7857-7864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and the probe was purified on an Elute-tip (Schleicher & Schuell). Hybridization was carried out overnight at 42 °C in the same buffer as the prehybridization but containing ∼1 × 106 cpm/ml 32P-labeled probe. The membrane was washed twice for 30 min at 42 °C with 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS and then twice for 30 min at 65 °C with 0.2× SSC and 0.1% SDS. Bound probe was visualized on a PhosphorImager (Storm 860, Molecular Dynamics) after overnight exposure. The activities of GlcAT-I was measured in crude cell-free homogenates. Cells were grown to confluence, rinsed three times with cold PBS, and detached with a rubber policeman in 50 μl of solution containing 0.25 msucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Aliquots of the cell extracts were stored at −20 °C. The donor, UDP[1-3H]glucuronic acid, and the substrate, Galβ1,3Galβ-O-naphthalenemethanol, were synthesized as described (49Wei G. Bai X.M. Sarkar A.K. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7857-7864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We have identified previously a number of CHO cell mutants altered in GAG biosynthesis using a “brute force” replica plating technique (43Esko J.D. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 32: 387-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this procedure, cell colonies were grown on plastic tissue culture dishes in the presence of an overlaying disk of polyester cloth. Colonies forming on the plate also developed on the cloth, thus providing two copies of each colony. The cloth “replica” was then incubated in growth medium containing 35SO4, and incorporation of 35SO4 into proteoglycans was measured by autoradiography after acid precipitating radioactive proteoglycans on the disk.

Diabetes. 1995; 44: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). During streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetes, liver C/EBPβ mRNA is increased 3-fold while C/EBPα is decreased (29Bosch F. Sabater J. Valera A. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This change is reverted by insulin treatment in diabetic animals, suggesting that glucagon, glucocorticoids, and possibly insulin action may be expressed in part through C/EBPβ. The hyperglycemia of diabetes results from impaired insulin-dependent glucose utilization and increased hepatic glucose output, via glycogenolysis, and increased gluconeogenesis (30Cryer P.E. Polonsky K.S. Wilson J.D. Foster D.W. Kronenberg H.M. Larsen P.R. Williams: Textbook of Endocrinology. 9th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1998: 939-971Google Scholar). The rate-limiting enzyme for gluconeogenesis, PEPCK (EC 4.1.1.32), is controlled exclusively at the transcription level in response to hormones and metabolites (31Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev.

Glucagon and catecholamines (via cAMP) and glucocorticoids are positive regulators, while insulin, in the presence of glucocorticoids, is a negative signal (for review, see Ref. 31Hanson R.W.

PEPCK gene transcription is regulated by several composite modular units in the promoter/enhancer region, comprising two or more cis-acting DNA elements (33Short J.M. Wynshaw-Boris A. Short H.P.

The transacting factors that bind to these sequences include CREB, AP1, C/EBPs, HNFs, TR, RAR/RXR, and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (see Fig. 3 and Refs. 36Sugiyama T. Scott D.K Wang J.-C.

Indeed, removal of the pituitary gland (44Houssay B.A. Endocrinology. 1942; 30: 884-892Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) or adrenalectomy (45Long C.D.W. Leukins F.D.W. J. Exp. Med. 1936; 63: 465-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) lessens or reverses many of the metabolic abnormalities of diabetic animals, including reducing blood glucose and PEPCK gene expression. At the molecular level, a deletion of the glucocorticoid response modular unit (GRU) of the PEPCK promoter prevents the increase in reporter gene transcription in STZ-diabetic transgenic mice (43Friedman J.E. Yun J.S. Patel Y.M. McGrane M.M. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12952-12957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The diabetic response is also blocked in animals with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU-486 (46Friedman J.E. Sun Y. Ishizuka T. Farrell C.J. McCormack S.E. Herron L.M. Hakimi P. Lechner P. Yun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31475-31481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Glucocorticoid-stimulated PEPCK gene transcription is suggested to involve a cooperation of the GR with factors binding to accessory factor sites AF-1, AF-2, and AF-3, and through interaction of factors binding to the CRE (36Sugiyama T. Scott D.K Wang J.-C. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1487-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). C/EBP isoforms bind to three major sites on the PEPCK gene promoter, the CRE, the P3I site, and the AF-2 element (26–27, 36–37, 47–50, Fig. 3). Because C/EBPβ has been found related to the main signals controlling PEPCK gene expression, we decided to test whether C/EBPβ inactivationin vivo would provide integrative data for understanding glucose homeostasis during diabetes. Our analysis suggests that homozygous c/ebpβ−/− mice display decreased blood lipids and impaired gluconeogenesis in response to diabetes. Our results indicate there is a selective increase in C/EBPβ protein in liver nuclei, which binds with greater affinity to DNA sequences within the PEPCK GRU during STZ-diabetes. In mice with a c/ebpβdeletion, however, the normal induction of PEPCK and Glc-6-Pase during STZ-diabetes is reduced, gluconeogenesis is decreased, and blood glucose is significantly lower. The impairment in gluconeogenesis inc/ebpβ−/− mice during diabetes suggests this transcription factor is an essential mediator of glucocorticoid signaling in the physiological context of the intact mouse. Mice used in this study were obtained by cross-breeding female mice heterozygous for a null mutation of thec/ebpβgene with homozygous malec/ebpβ−/− mice. The generation and mixed genetic background as well as the methods used for genotyping have been described previously by Screpanti et al. (15Screpanti I. Romani L. Musiani P. Modesti A. Fattori E.

Adult male and female c/ebpβ−/−,c/ebpβ+/−, and c/ebpβ+/+ mice were studied at 10–14 weeks of age. Mice were housed in microisolater cages and were maintained on a fixed 12-h light/dark cycle at Case Western Reserve University animal facility. Animals had free access to water and were fed regular animal chow (Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) ad libitum. For experimental diabetes, food was removed overnight, mice received a single streptozotocin intraperitoneal injection (0.2 mg/g STZ in 0.05m citrate, pH 5.0), and food was returned 4 h later. Development of hyperglycemia (> 250 mg%, One Touch II blood glucose meter; Lifescan Inc.) was considered as diabetic state. Animals were sacrificed 3–4 days after STZ treatment. Excised livers were used immediately for nuclear protein extraction or frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 °C. Blood was taken from the tails in the morning, centrifuged, and plasma separated and frozen. Plasma concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids and glucose were measured with diagnostic reagent kits from Wako and Sigma, respectively. Insulin and corticosterone levels in plasma were determined using radioimmunoassay kits from Linco Research (St. Charles, MO) and ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA). Glycogen was extracted from frozen livers by homogenization in 6% perchloric acid, precipitated in ethanol, hydrolyzed by boiling in 1 n HCl, and glucose measured as for plasmas (51Lo S. Russell J.C.

The rate of gluconeogenesis was estimated in vivo in mice deprived of food 4 h (noon) prior to receiving intraperitoneal injection of2H2O (0.4% of body weight), and drinking water was supplemented to 0.4% in 2H2O. Four hours later (8 p.m.), mice were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of a solution containing ketamine HCl (65 mg/kg), acepromazine maleate (2 mg/kg), and xylazine HCl (13 mg/kg) (Henry Schein, Port Washington, NY) and blood collected from the abdominal aorta. Blood samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min, the plasma separated, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until analyzed. Enrichment of 2H at carbon 6 of glucose was assayed by mass spectrometry as hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) formed from formaldehyde by periodate oxidation of the plasma glucose C-6 (52Kalhan S.C. Trivedi R. Singh S. Chandramouli V. Schumann W.C. Landau B.R. J. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 30: 1588-1592Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 μl of plasma was deproteinized, the supernatant passed through columns AG1-X8 in the formate form and AG 50W-X8 in the H+ form, and a neutral effluent evaporated to dryness. Glucose content of the effluent was quantified in an automatic analyzer (53Kadish A.H. Litle R.L. Sternberg J.C. Clin. Chem. 1968; 14: 116-131Crossref Google Scholar). Formaldehyde obtained after periodate oxidation of glucose C-6 was treated with NH4OH to form HMT. The residue after evaporation was taken up in methylene chloride. HMT formed was injected into the gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (HP5985; Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA) without further derivatization. The samples were run with standards of HMT of known deuterium enrichments (0.125–2.0 range). The deuterium enrichment of the samples was calculated in mole percent excess from a linear regression equation of the standard curve. The percent contribution of gluconeogenesis was calculated by comparing the 2H enrichment of glucose with that of body water, as measured in mouse urine by isotopic exchange with [U-13C3]acetone (54Yang D.

Mice were fasted overnight before injecting 5 μCi ofd-[3-3H]glucose (NEN Life Science Products) in 100 μl of saline via tail vein. Blood samples (25 μl) for glucose and radioactivity determinations were obtained at 5, 15, and 30 min from the tip of the tail. Serum was obtained after centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min, and glucose levels were determined using the glucose oxidase method (Sigma). For radioactivity determinations, 10 μl of blood was deproteinized with 200 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid. Samples were centrifuged at 5,000 ×g for 5 min, and the supernatants were evaporated to dryness overnight at 65 °C under a hood. The residue was reconstituted in 200 μl of water, 5 ml of scintillation fluid was added, and the samples were counted in a β-scintillation counter. The rate of hepatic glucose production (HGP) was calculated using steady-state equations (55Hetenyi G. Norwich K. Fed. Proc. 1974; 33: 44SGoogle Scholar). The gluconeogenesis rate during overnight fasting was obtained by multiplying the fraction of plasma glucose derived via gluconeogenesis times HGP. Statistical comparisons between groups were made using Student's t test. Liver nuclear extracts were prepared using the combined livers of 2–4 mice by a slight modification of the method of Gorski et al. (27Nizielski S.E. Arizmendi C. Shteyngarts A.R. Farrell C.J.

Freshly excised livers were minced, homogenized, nuclei pelleted and lysed, and ammonium sulfate-precipitated nuclear proteins recovered by centrifugation. After dialysis, nuclear proteins were quantitated by Bradford (27Nizielski S.E. Arizmendi C. Shteyngarts A.R. Farrell C.J. Friedman J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 39: R1005-R1012Google Scholar), aliquoted, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. All buffers used contained a mixture of proteases and phosphatase inhibitors with the following final concentrations: 1 mg/ml antipain, chymostatin, pepstatin, and leupeptin; 10 mg/ml aprotinin; 2.5 mmbenzamidine; 20 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor; 0.1 mm PMSF; 10 mm sodium fluoride, sodium orthophosphate, and sodium vanadate; and 5 nm Microcystin LR. Double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides containing sequences of the PEPCK promoter: CRE (−94/−77), 5′-CCCCTTACGTCAGAGGCTCTAG-3′ (underlined consensus CRE); P3I (−249/-232), 5′-CTAGACGTTGTGTAAGGACTCA-3′ (underlined C/EBP site homologous sequence); and AF-2 (−420/-406), 5′-GCGGCTGTGGTGTTTTGAAAC-3′(underlined consensus IRS) were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems 380A DNA synthesizer, and gel-purified before use (CWRU Core Laboratory). The annealed double-stranded oligomers were labeled by filling-in the overhanging ends with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase and [α-32P]dCTP, gel-purified, and used at 20,000 cpm/ml in the reaction mixture for nuclear protein binding assay. Binding reactions were carried out as described (27Nizielski S.E. Arizmendi C. Shteyngarts A.R. Farrell C.J. Friedman J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 39: R1005-R1012Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μl of mixture consisted of 3–14 fmol of labeled probe (60,000 cpm), 10 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 50 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) as non-specific competitor. Following 15 min at room temperature, either antisera against C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, CREB, p-CREB, or preimmune serum were added. Binding reactions continued for another 10 min before electrophoresis. Protein-DNA complexes and free probe were resolved on a 20 × 20-cm2 4% acrylamide (55:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) gel in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA at 100 V for 2 h. The gel was dried and exposed to Kodak X-ARO5 film. The specific band intensities were quantitated by optical densitometry using a Digiscan scanner (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) and the autoradiographic signals integrated (27Nizielski S.E. Arizmendi C. Shteyngarts A.R. Farrell C.J. Friedman J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 39: R1005-R1012Google Scholar). The means from these experiments, including total binding and relative amount of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ binding to each separate oligonucleotide, on the same autoradiography were calculated as relative percentage of the control wild-type or C/EBPβ−/− signals integrated in arbitrary units. The values are means of samples in duplicates of three experiments. S.E. were 10–15% of the average values. Total RNA was extracted from mouse liver using the guanidine thiocyanate procedure as described previously (46Friedman J.E. Sun Y. Ishizuka T. Farrell C.J. McCormack S.E. Herron L.M. Hakimi P. Lechner P. Yun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31475-31481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Solutions were made in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water and materials were rinsed in RNase-off solution (CPG Inc.). RNA was purified through gradient centrifugation in cesium chloride, resuspended, and the concentration determined with reference to absorbance at 260 nm (A 260/280 for purity). 20 μg of total RNA were placed in 37% deionized formamide, 0.66 m formaldehyde gel loading solution and size-fractionated by electrophoresis through a 1.4% agarose, 0.66m formaldehyde gel in 1× Mops buffer. RNA was transferred overnight to a GeneScreen Plus membrane (NEN Life Science Products) and cross-linked by vacuum-baking at 80 °C. Prehybridization was done at 65 °C, for 3 h, in Church buffer. Probes used were a nick-translated 32P-labeled cDNA (106dpm × μg−1) for PEPCK (1.1-kilobase pair fragment; kind gift of Dr. R. W. Hanson) and glucose 6-phosphatase (1.25-kilobase pair fragment; kindly provided by Dr. D. Massillon). After hybridization overnight at 65 °C, the filter was washed extensively in 2× sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC)/0.1% SDS at room temperature, and exposed to Kodak BioMax autoradiographic film at −80 °C. For re-probing, the blots were stripped at 80 °C in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS during 15 min or until no counts. The specific band intensities were quantitated by optical densitometry using a Digiscan scanner (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and the autoradiographic signals integrated (27Nizielski S.E. Arizmendi C.

MAGP-2, unlike MAGP-1, contains an RGD motif with potential for integrin binding. To determine if the RGD sequence is active, a series of cell binding assays was performed. MAGP-2 was shown to promote the attachment and spreading of bovine nuchal ligament fibroblasts when coated onto plastic wells in molar quantities similar to those of fibronectin. In contrast, ∼10-fold more MAGP-1 was required to support comparable levels of cell adhesion. The fibroblast binding to MAGP-2 was completely inhibited if the peptide GRGDSP or the MAGP-2-specific peptide GVSGQRGDDVTTVTSET was added to the reaction medium at a 10 μm final concentration. The control peptide GRGESP had no effect on the interaction. These findings indicate that the cell interaction with MAGP-2 is an RGD-mediated event. A monoclonal antibody to human αVβ3 integrin (LM609) almost completely blocked cell attachment to MAGP-2 when added to the medium at 0.5 μg/ml, whereas two monoclonal antibodies specific for the human β1 integrin subunit, 4B4 (blocking) and QE2.E5 (activating), had no effect even at 10 μg/ml. Fetal bovine aortic smooth muscle cells, ear cartilage chondrocytes, and arterial endothelial cells and human skin fibroblasts and osteoblasts were also observed to adhere strongly to MAGP-2. In addition, each cell type was able to spread on MAGP-2 substrate, with the exception of the endothelial cells, which remained spherical after 2 h of incubation. The binding of each cell type was blocked when the anti-αVβ3 integrin antibody was included in the assay, indicating that αVβ3 integrin is the major receptor for MAGP-2 on several cell types. Thus, MAGP-2 may mediate interactions between fibrillin-containing microfibrils and cell surfaces during the development of a variety of tissues.

MAGPs 1The abbreviation used is: MAGPs, microfibril-associated glycoproteins; BSA, bovine serum albumin.1The abbreviation used is: MAGPs, microfibril-associated glycoproteins; BSA, bovine serum albumin. are a two-member family of small structurally related glycoproteins, MAGP-1 (31 kDa) and MAGP-2 (25 kDa), which are specifically associated with fibrillin-containing microfibrils (1Gibson M.A. Hatzinikolas G.

Fibrillin-containing microfibrils (10–12-nm diameter) are important structural components of the extracellular matrix of most connective tissues. In elastic tissues such as arteries, lung, and elastic ligaments, these microfibrils are components of elastic fibers, in association with the elastic protein, elastin. Fibrillin-containing microfibrils can also occur as elastin-free bundles in tissues such as ocular zonule, skeletal muscle, and kidney glomerulus (2Cleary E.G. Gibson M.A. Int. Rev. Connect. Tissue Res. 1983; 10: 97-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Cleary E.G. Gibson M.A. Comper W.D. Extracellular Matrix. 2.

The major structural components of these microfibrils are rod-like 350-kDa glycoproteins named fibrillin-1 and -2, which appear to be arranged as parallel bundles of 4–8 molecules joined in series in a head-to-tail manner (5Kielty C.M.

Fibrillin-1 and -2 have distinct, but overlapping, spatiotemporal tissue distributions, indicating that the microfibrils have structural and functional heterogeneity (9Zhang H. Hu W. Ramirez F. J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). It is unclear if fibrillin-1 and -2 form separate populations of microfibrils or if they can coexist in the same microfibril. Mutations in the genes for fibrillin-1 and -2 have been linked to the heritable connective tissue disorders Marfan syndrome and congenital contractural arachnodactyly, respectively (11Dietz H.C.

In most instances, it is unclear if the protein forms part of the microfibril or is adhered to its surface.There is strong biochemical and immunoelectron microscopic evidence that MAGP-1 and MAGP-2 are covalently linked by disulfide bonding to fibrillin-containing microfibrils within tissues (21Gibson M.A. Kumaratilake J.S. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4590-4598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MAGP-1 co-distributes with most, if not all, fibrillin-1-containing microfibrils and is localized in a specific periodic manner on the beads of the “beads-on-a-string” structure of these microfibrils revealed by the rotary shadowing technique (4Kumaratilake J.S.

This suggests that MAGP-1 may be an integral component of microfibrils of this type. MAGP-2 exhibits more restricted tissue and developmental patterns of distribution, suggesting that MAGP-2 has a more specialized role in microfibril biology (22Gibson M.A. Finnis M.L. Kumaratilake J.S. Cleary E.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 871-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Cloning of MAGP-1 and MAGP-2 revealed that they each contain a characteristic central motif with close sequence similarity between the molecules, including precise alignment of seven cysteine residues (1Gibson M.A. Hatzinikolas G.

It is considered likely that this cysteine-rich region is involved in the interactions of MAGPs with other components of the microfibril. In contrast, the other regions of MAGP-1 and MAGP-2 were found to be very divergent in structure. Evidence indicates that the N-terminal region of MAGP-1 contains binding sequences for tropoelastin and type VI collagen, and it is possible that the glycoprotein functions on the surface of the microfibrils, as an elastin-binding protein during elastinogenesis and as an anchoring protein mediating the interaction of fibrillin-containing microfibrils and type VI collagen microfibrils (25Brown-Augsburger P. Broekelmann T. Mecham L. Mercer R. Gibson M.A. Cleary E.G. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. J. Biol.

In contrast, MAGP-2 lacks these binding characteristics, consistent with MAGP-2 having a function different from that MAGP-1. The N-terminal region of MAGP-2 was found to contain an RGD motif (1Gibson M.A. Hatzinikolas G. Kumaratilake J.S. Sandberg L.B. Nicholl J.K. Sutherland G.R. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1096-1103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), suggesting that the glycoprotein may have integrin binding activity (28Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar, 29Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 697-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (2514) Google Scholar). Using an in vitro cell binding assay, we have now shown that MAGP-2 interacts with a wide range of cell types in an RGD-dependent manner via αVβ3integrin.DISCUSSIONPrevious sequence analysis of human and bovine MAGP-2 showed a conserved RGD-containing sequence (QRGDDVT) to be present in both proteins (1Gibson M.A. Hatzinikolas G.

Surface probability analysis indicated that the sequence was likely to reside on the surface of the MAGP-2 molecule. These observations suggested that the RGD sequence in MAGP-2 might have integrin binding properties. In this study, we have established that a variety of human and bovine cell types do specifically adhere and spread on subpicomole quantities of bovine MAGP-2. Cells that were found to interact with MAGP-2 include fetal bovine nuchal ligament fibroblasts, aortic smooth muscle cells, ear cartilage chondrocytes, and arterial endothelial cells and adult human skin fibroblasts and osteoblasts. The binding could be almost totally inhibited by RGD-containing peptides and by a blocking anti-human αVβ3 integrin monoclonal antibody. Blocking anti-β1 integrin antibodies showed no effect on cell binding to MAGP-2. Overall, the results indicate that αVβ3 integrin is the major receptor for MAGP-2 on all of the cell types shown to adhere to the protein.Integrin αVβ3 is the most promiscuous of the RGD-dependent integrins (29Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 697-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (2514) Google Scholar, 43Horton M.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 721-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). It has been shown to mediate the adhesion and spreading of many cell types on a wide range of matrix macromolecules, including vitronectin, fibronectin, tenascins, thrombospondin, laminin-1, and osteopontin (44Rubin K.

Upon ligand binding, αVβ3integrin forms part of focal adhesion complexes, where it can mediate the interaction of the above matrix components with the actin-containing cytoskeleton, important for cell spreading and migration (43Horton M.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 721-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In addition, there is evidence that the integrin is involved in several other cell signaling pathways (47Laflamme S.E. Homan S.M. Bodeau A.L. Mastrangelo A.M.

(51Saito T. Albelda S.M. Brighton C.T. J. Orthop. Res. 1994; 12: 384-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) detected only very low levels of this integrin on cultured human osteoblasts. Gronthoset al. (49Gronthos S. Stewart K. Graves S.E. Hay S. Simmons P.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1189-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) presented strong evidence that the integrin is present on cultured osteoblastic cells, but that it might be in a non-active form. However, more recently, Wendel et al. (52Wendel M. Sommarin Y. Heinegard D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) showed that the integrin is active on bovine osteoblasts, where it mediates the interaction of the cells with the novel keratan sulfate proteoglycan osteoadherin. Therefore, the observation that MAGP-2 interacts with human osteoblasts via αVβ3integrin is consistent with the above study. It is interesting that, in contrast to other adhering cell types, the arterial endothelial cells adhered to, but did not spread, on MAGP-2 substrate. This observation indicates that the cell behavioral consequences of the αVβ3 integrin-mediated interaction with MAGP-2 are not identical for all adhering cell types. This finding is reminiscent of the study of Joshi et al. (53Joshi P. Chung C.-Y. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 389-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who reported that endothelial cells adhere to tenascin in an RGD-dependent manner, but do not spread on this substrate. The authors suggested that the tenascin may be eliciting or enhancing a signaling function on the endothelial cells. Thus, it is also possible that the interaction of MAGP-2 and αVβ3integrin on such cells serves predominantly as a signaling mechanism rather than facilitating the anchoring and spreading function observed with other cell types.In previous immunolocalization studies, MAGP-2 has been identified with fibrillin-containing microfibrils in fetal tissues such as nuchal ligament, aortic intima, skin, skeletal muscle, and kidney mesangium (22Gibson M.A. Finnis M.L. Kumaratilake J.S. Cleary E.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 871-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These MAGP-2-staining microfibrils were often observed closely adjacent to the surfaces of cells. Therefore, it is likely that MAGP-2 can interact in vivo with several of the cell types examined in this study. It should be noted, however, that MAGP-2 also bound to fetal aortic smooth muscle cells and chondrocytes even though the protein was not identified in the corresponding tissues (22Gibson M.A. Finnis M.L. Kumaratilake J.S. Cleary E.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 871-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In developing nuchal ligament, the period of maximal MAGP-2 expression corresponds to the period of highest fibrillin-1 expression that, in turn, correlates with the early stages of elastinogenesis (22Gibson M.A. Finnis M.L. Kumaratilake J.S. Cleary E.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 871-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 54Mariencheck M.C. Davis E.C. Zhang H. Ramirez F. Rosenbloom J. Gibson M.A. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Connect. Tissue Res. 1995; 31: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this period, nascent elastic fibers consist of bundles of fibrillin-containing microfibrils coated with newly forming elastin, lying closely adjacent and parallel to the extracellular surface of cells (2Cleary E.G. Gibson M.A. Int. Rev. Connect. Tissue Res. 1983; 10: 97-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it has been proposed that the cell directs the deposition and orientation of the elastic fiber components during elastinogenesis, resulting in elastic fibers with tissue-specific morphology, e.g. thick fibers in nuchal ligament, fenestrated lamellae in aorta, and a range of structures from thin elastic fibers to elastin-free microfibrillar bundles in skin (2Cleary E.G. Gibson M.A. Int. Rev. Connect. Tissue Res. 1983; 10: 97-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,3Cleary E.G. Gibson M.A. Comper W.D. Extracellular Matrix. 2. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1996: 95-140Google Scholar).To achieve tissue-specific morphology, these processes are likely to be modulated by variation in the expression and function of intracellular, cell surface-associated, and extracellular proteins. At the cell surface, the elastin receptor has been implicated in elastic fiber assembly (55Mecham R.P. Hinek A. Cleary E.G. Kucich U. Lee S. Rosenbloom J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 56Mecham R.P. Hinek A. Griffin G.L. Senior R.M. Liotta L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16652-16657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that αVβ3 integrin may also be involved in the process through its interaction with fibrillin-1 (39Sakamoto H. Broekelmann T. Cheresh D.A. Ramirez F. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4916-4922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Integrins have already been found to play major roles in the cell-surface organization of fibronectin polymers (57Mosher D.F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 214-222Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The evidence presented here indicates that MAGP-2 may also be involved in cell-surface interaction with fibrillin-containing microfibrils. The presence of an active RGD integrin-binding site on this relatively small microfibril-associated protein suggests that interaction with αVβ3integrin is a major function of the molecule. It is interesting that the location of this RGD motif corresponds to the putative elastin/type VI collagen-binding site on its structural relative MAGP-1, considered to be important for microfibril/matrix interactions (27Finnis M.L. Gibson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22817-22823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The above points, together with the restricted tissue distribution of MAGP-2, suggest that the molecule is involved in modulation of microfibril interactions with cell surfaces in particular tissue environments. Since MAGP-2 has been identified in adult kidney mesangium (22Gibson M.A. Finnis M.L. Kumaratilake J.S. Cleary E.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 871-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), it is evident that the protein has some enduring role in microfibril biology. Rather than being a constitutive structural component of all microfibrils, MAGP-2 may be important for the generation and maintenance of microfibrils and elastic fibers with tissue-specific morphological, physical, and cell biological properties. An intriguing possibility is that, during the above processes, the presence or absence of MAGP-2 on the surface of the microfibrils may influence the interaction of cell-surface αVβ3 integrin with fibrillin-1 within the microfibrils, leading to distinct biological consequences. MAGPs 1The abbreviation used is: MAGPs, microfibril-associated glycoproteins; BSA, bovine serum albumin.1The abbreviation used is: MAGPs, microfibril-associated glycoproteins; BSA, bovine serum albumin. are a two-member family of small structurally related glycoproteins, MAGP-1 (31 kDa) and MAGP-2 (25 kDa), which are specifically associated with fibrillin-containing microfibrils (1Gibson M.A. Hatzinikolas G. Kumaratilake J.S. Sandberg L.B. Nicholl J.K. Sutherland G.R. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1096-1103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 3Cleary E.G. Gibson M.A. Comper W.D. Extracellular Matrix. 2. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1996: 95-140Google Scholar). Fibrillin-containing microfibrils (10–12-nm diameter) are important structural components of the extracellular matrix of most connective tissues. In elastic tissues such as arteries, lung, and elastic ligaments, these microfibrils are components of elastic fibers, in association with the elastic protein, elastin. Fibrillin-containing microfibrils can also occur as elastin-free bundles in tissues such as ocular zonule, skeletal muscle, and kidney glomerulus (2Cleary E.G. Gibson M.A. Int. Rev. Connect. Tissue Res. 1983; 10: 97-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Cleary E.G. Gibson M.A. Comper W.D. Extracellular Matrix. 2.

The major structural components of these microfibrils are rod-like 350-kDa glycoproteins named fibrillin-1 and -2, which appear to be arranged as parallel bundles of 4–8 molecules joined in series in a head-to-tail manner (5Kielty C.M. Shuttleworth C.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 747-760Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 6Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Engvall E. J.

Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Fibrillin-1 and -2 have distinct, but overlapping, spatiotemporal tissue distributions, indicating that the microfibrils have structural and functional heterogeneity (9Zhang H. Hu W. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1165-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 10Zhang H. Apfelroth S.D. Hu W. Davis E.C. Sanguineti C. Bonadio J. Mecham R.P. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). It is unclear if fibrillin-1 and -2 form separate populations of microfibrils or if they can coexist in the same microfibril. Mutations in the genes for fibrillin-1 and -2 have been linked to the heritable connective tissue disorders Marfan syndrome and congenital contractural arachnodactyly, respectively (11Dietz H.C. Ramirez F. Sakai L.Y. Adv. Hum. Genet. 1994; 22: 153-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 12Ramirez F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Despite being the subjects of intensive investigation, the precise molecular composition, architecture, and structural and functional heterogeneity of the microfibrils are still being elucidated (3Cleary E.G.

In addition to MAGP-1 and MAGP-2, these include microfibril-associated proteins 1, 3, and 4 (13Abrams W.R. Ma R.-I. Kucich U. Bashir M.M. Decker S. Tsipouras P. McPherson J.D. Wasmuth J.J.

There is strong biochemical and immunoelectron microscopic evidence that MAGP-1 and MAGP-2 are covalently linked by disulfide bonding to fibrillin-containing microfibrils within tissues (21Gibson M.A. Kumaratilake J.S. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4590-4598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MAGP-1 co-distributes with most, if not all, fibrillin-1-containing microfibrils and is localized in a specific periodic manner on the beads of the “beads-on-a-string” structure of these microfibrils revealed by the rotary shadowing technique (4Kumaratilake J.S.

https://openalex.org/W2060866593,"Sterol regulation of gene expression in mammalian cells is mediated by an interaction between the cholesterol-sensitive sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) and promoter-specific but generic co-regulatory transcription factors such as Sp1 and NF-Y/CBF. Thus, sterol-regulated promoters that require different co-regulatory factors could be regulated independently through targeting the specific interaction between the SREBPs and the individual co-regulatory proteins. In the present studies we demonstrate that transiently expressed yin yang 1 protein (YY1) inhibits the SREBP-mediated activation of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor in a sensitive and dose-dependent manner. The inhibition is independent of YY1 binding directly to the LDL receptor promoter, and we show that the same region of YY1 that interacts in solution with Sp1 also interacts with SREBP. Furthermore, other SREBP-regulated genes that are not co-regulated by Sp1 are either not affected at all or are not as sensitive to the repression. Thus, the specific interaction that occurs between SREBPs and Sp1 to stimulate the LDL receptor promoter is a specific target for inhibition by the YY1 protein, and we provide evidence that the mechanism can be at least partially explained by the ability of YY1 to inhibit the interaction between SREBP and Sp1 in solution in vitro. The LDL receptor is the key gene of cholesterol uptake, and the rate-controlling genes of cholesterol synthesis are stimulated by the concerted action of SREBPs along with coregulators that are distinct from Sp1. Therefore, repression of gene expression through specifically targeting the interaction between SREBP and Sp1 would provide a molecular mechanism to explain how cholesterol uptake can be regulated independently from cholesterol biosynthesis in mammalian cells.

Therefore, repression of gene expression through specifically targeting the interaction between SREBP and Sp1 would provide a molecular mechanism to explain how cholesterol uptake can be regulated independently from cholesterol biosynthesis in mammalian cells. Cholesterol homeostasis in mammals is achieved through a sensitive regulatory circuit that responds to changes in both the need and availability of cellular cholesterol (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar). High levels trigger a classic negative feedback loop that prevents its over accumulation. This negative regulatory process is governed by a conditionally positive mechanism (2Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3028) Google Scholar). Suboptimal cholesterol levels result in the proteolytic release of the membrane-bound precursor forms of the sterol regulatory element-binding transcriptional activator proteins or SREBPs. 1The abbreviation used is: SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; HMG, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl; LDL, low density lipoprotein; YY1, yin yang 1 protein; CMV, cytomegalovirus; GST, glutathione S-transferase; btd, buttonhead; aa, amino acid(s); HSV, herpes simplex virus; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix. Once liberated from their membrane anchor, the mature transcription factors accumulate in the nucleus where they activate genes required for cholesterol uptake and biosynthesis (2Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3028) Google Scholar, 3Osborne T.F. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R172-R174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The SREBP proteins also activate genes of fatty acid metabolism (2Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3028) Google Scholar, 3Osborne T.F. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R172-R174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thus provide a molecular link to coordinate the activation of the two major lipid pathways in mammals. Although there are situations in metabolism where coordinate regulation of fatty acids and cholesterol is essential such as for new cellular membrane synthesis and possibly for the assembly of lipoprotein particles, there are other times where separate regulation is required, for example when excess dietary calories are converted into triglycerides for storage or when cholesterol is needed for the biosynthesis of steroid hormones or bile acids. Recent work has suggested that this may be achieved at least in part through the preferential activation of genes of either fatty acid or cholesterol metabolism by different isoforms of the SREBPs (4Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar,5Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Shimano H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is at least equally important for cells to have a mechanism to selectively activate cholesterol uptake from its endogenous biosynthesis to maintain homeostasis in response to wide fluctuations in the availability of cholesterol in the diet. The SREBP proteins are inefficient transcriptional regulatory proteins by themselves, and they require a coregulatory factor and its associated DNA-binding site to efficiently activate all of the carefully studied SREBP target genes analyzed to date (2Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3028) Google Scholar, 3Osborne T.F. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R172-R174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The identity and binding site location of the coregulatory factor relative to the binding site(s) for SREBP in individual promoters is likely to provide at least part of the mechanistic basis for the independent regulation for individual genes of cholesterol synthetic enzymes versus the LDL receptor. In our search for regulatory proteins that selectively affect either cholesterol uptake or cholesterol synthesis, we report in the current studies that the LDL receptor gene promoter is selectively down-regulated by the yin yang 1 (YY1) protein. YY1 has been characterized as both an activator and repressor of specific gene expression in other systems (6Shi Y. Lee J.S. Galvin K.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F49-F66Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). We specifically demonstrate that the interaction between SREBP and Sp1 that is necessary for the two proteins to synergistically activate the LDL receptor promoter is inhibited by YY1. Along with other recent data these studies provide a regulatory mechanism that could preferentially alter cholesterol uptake with minimal or no effect on cholesterol biosynthesis. CMV-SREBP-1a and CMV-SREBP-2 contain aa 1–490 or aa 1–481 of the full-length human proteins in the CMV-5 expression vector and have been previously described (9Magaña M.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32689-32694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). A prokaryotic expression vector for production of full-length human YY1 as a poly-histidine fusion protein was a gift of Tom Shenk (Princeton University). CMV-YY1 was prepared by excising the YY1 coding sequence and inserting it into the CMV-5 expression vector. YY1 GAL4 fusion proteins were prepared by designing hybridization primers that were subsequently used to amplify specific regions of the YY1 cDNA using CMV YY1 as a template. The YY1 coding fragments were then fused in frame at the carboxyl end of the GAL4 aa 1–147 fragment in the pSG424 expression vector (10Sodowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Amino acids 1–147 of GAL4 contains its DNA-binding and nuclear targeting domains. The CMV expression clones containing the HSV glycoprotein D epitope tag attached to the NH2 terminus followed by the YY1 full-length protein or similarly constructed mutants with deletions in the central B region were prepared by polymerase chain reaction, and a small fragment encoding a methionine residue followed by the HSV antibody epitope sequence was attached at the amino terminus of all of these constructs. GST fusion proteins were constructed by inserting the corresponding coding sequence of YY1 or SREBP into the pGEX2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

HepG2 cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum (v/v) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. CV-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 8% CO2. Lipoprotein-deficient serum was prepared by ultracentrifugation (14Goldstein J. Basu S. Brown M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar), and stock solutions of cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol (Steraloids, Inc.) were prepared in ethanol.

All reporter plasmids and the CMV-β-galactosidase control plasmid were added at 5 μg/60-mm dish of cells. HepG2 cells were plated at 1.75 × 105 cells/60-mm dish and transfected the following day. 4–6 h after transfection, dishes were subjected to a glycerol shock and rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, refed with normal medium, and incubated an additional 24 h prior to harvest. CV-1 cells were plated at 1.25 × 105 cells/60-mm dish and were transfected the following day. 18 h following transfection, cells were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and duplicate dishes were fed with either induced medium (containing lipoprotein-depleted serum) or suppressed medium (lipoprotein-depleted serum containing 10 μg/ml cholesterol and 1 μg/ml of 25-hydroxycholesterol). Cells were harvested after an additional 24 h of incubation. For both CV-1 and HepG2 cells, duplicate dishes were combined during harvest, and cell extracts were prepared by a standard freeze-thaw procedure (13Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Luciferase activities were measured in a luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Monolight 2010) using 20 μl of cell extract and 100 μl of luciferin reagent (Promega, Inc.). The β-galactosidase assays were performed using a standard colorimetric assay with 50 μl of cell extract with 2-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as the substrate (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The luciferase activities in relative light units were divided by the β-galactosidase activities (A 420 nm/h) for each sample to control for variation in transfection efficiency and cell growth. Expression and preparation of GST fusion proteins have been described (12Dooley K.A. Millinder S. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1349-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To a 280-μl slurry of glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma), 1 ml of the crude GST fusion protein extract expressing full-length YY1 protein was bound to glutathione-agarose beads, the bound GST fusion proteins were pelleted in a microcentrifuge, and nonspecifically bound proteins were removed by washing the pellets three times with 1 ml of Z′0.1 buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) 0.5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, 5 mm dithiothreitol. This slurry was divided into 14 equal aliquots in individual microcentrifuge tubes. While these samples were being prepared, recombinant His-tagged SREBP-1a was preincubated with SL2 nuclear extracts from control cells or cells that had been transfected with expression vectors for wild type Sp1 or the Sp1 Δbtd (11Athanikar J.N. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5193-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).

The SL2/SREBP-1a samples were then diluted to 0.3 ml with Z′0.1 buffer and added to the GST-coated glutathione-agarose beads, and samples were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h on a rotating wheel. The reactions were pelleted again and washed three times with 1 ml of Z′0.1 buffer. The specifically bound proteins were sedimented along with the agarose beads, resuspended in sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For the complementary experiment in Fig. 5, 0.1-μl samples of purified Sp1 (from Promega Inc.) were preincubated with increasing amounts of recombinant His-tagged YY1 protein and added to glutathione beads that had been precoated with a GST fusion protein expressing amino acids 321–490 of SREBP-1a. The samples were processed and analyzed by gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis for Sp1 as described below. Samples were analyzed by standard SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (BA83) for 2 h at 300 mA and 4 °C. Filters were blocked with TBS buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl) containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.05% Tween 20 and analyzed for Western blotting using primary antibodies to Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), the HSV epitope (Novagen), or SREBP-1 (IGG-2A4 from ATCC). Following the primary antibody incubation, the appropriate secondary antibody was added, and the bound antibody conjugates were detected with the Super Signal kit from Pierce. Expression from the LDL receptor promoter is dependent on the combined action of the SREBP and Sp1 transcription factors. Normally, SREBPs are nuclear only when cells are sterol depleted. However, transfection of a plasmid designed to encode a constitutively expressed and nuclear-targeted version of the SREBPs results in a dose-dependent activation of the LDL receptor without regard for the sterol status of the cell (13Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 16Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 185-197Crossref Google Scholar). In Fig. 1A we show that when a plasmid expressing the mature forms of either SREBP-1a or -2 is added in transient transfections along with the LDL receptor promoter reporter plasmid, that including an YY1-expressing plasmid results in a dose-dependent inhibition of the SREBP-activated expression. Over the same concentration range YY1 had a modest repressive effect on SREBP activation of the HMG CoA synthase promoter, and activation of the SV40 early promoter was essentially unaffected. Fig. 1B shows results for a similar experiment where activation of the LDL receptor promoter was directly compared with the HMG CoA reductase promoter. Activation of the HMG CoA reductase promoter by exogenously added SREBPs is not as sensitive as the LDL receptor and HMG CoA synthase promoters, and to observe significant activation we had to provide higher levels of added SREBP plasmid (17Millinder-Vallett S. Sanchez H.B. Rosenfeld J.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12247-12253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Even at this level of added SREBP plasmid the LDL receptor promoter was efficiently repressed by YY1, and there was no inhibitory effect at all on the HMG CoA reductase promoter. We have failed to see any effect on the reductase promoter even at 10-fold higher levels of YY1 as that used in this figure (data not shown). As mentioned above, endogenously produced SREBPs only accumulate in the nucleus when cultured cells are depleted of sterols. Under these conditions SREBP-activated promoters are induced. The experiment in Fig. 1C demonstrates that addition of the YY1-expressing plasmid also resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in this induced level of expression from the LDL receptor promoter (Fig. 1C). YY1 had no appreciable effect on the basal level of LDL receptor promoter activity in the absence of co-transfected SREBPs or in sterol replete cells (data not shown). Unlike the LDL receptor promoter that requires both Sp1 and SREBP, the SV40 promoter is activated by Sp1 and not SREBP, and the HMG CoA synthase and reductase promoters are activated by SREBP but not Sp1. Thus, it is likely that the sensitivity of the LDL receptor promoter to inhibition by the co-expression of YY1 is a result of YY1 interfering with the synergistic activation mediated by the combined action of SREBP and Sp1. In an initial attempt to analyze the specificity and potential mechanism for this inhibition, we first evaluated whether an increase in the amount of added SREBP would reverse the inhibitory effect of YY1 (Fig. 1D). Similar to the experiment in Fig. 1A, YY1 inhibited the activation by a small amount of added SREBP-1a (Fig. 1D, bars 1–3). When additional SREBP-expressing plasmid was added on top of the YY1, a dose-dependent reactivation of the LDL receptor promoter was observed (Fig. 1D, bars 4–6). To further analyze the inhibitory effect, we introduced mutations into the YY1 coding sequence to characterize the protein domain(s) that were required. Initially, we prepared three mutant versions as shown in Fig. 2A. In one mutant (ΔA) we deleted the first 82 amino acids, in another (ΔC) we deleted the last 100 amino acids removing the last two zinc finger regions, and in a third mutant we combined the NH2 and COOH truncations to delete both termini. Because the carboxyl-terminal domain contains both the DNA-binding and nuclear targeting functions of YY1 (18Austen M. Lüscher B. Lüscher-Firzlaff J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1709-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), we fused these mutants (as well as the full-length YY1) to the DNA-binding and nuclear targeting domains of the yeast GAL4 protein in an expression vector designed to express GAL4 fusion proteins in mammalian cells from the SV40 promoter (10Sodowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The resulting GAL4-YY1 fusion proteins would be targeted to the nucleus independent of the nuclear targeting elements of YY1. When these GAL4 fusion proteins were transfected into HepG2 cells the construct containing the entire YY1 coding sequence inhibited the SREBP-Sp1-dependent activation of the LDL receptor promoter in a dose-dependent manner, and the control vector that expressed only the GAL4 portion of the protein did not. All three of the YY1 deletion constructs inhibited activation of the LDL receptor, indicating that the region required for inhibition was contained within the central B region. YY1 deletions that lack the carboxyl-terminal two zinc fingers destroy the ability of the resulting protein to bind DNA (28Galvin K.M. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3723-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and there are no GAL4 DNA-binding sites in the LDL receptor promoter; this suggests that YY1 inhibition of the LDL receptor occurs by a novel DNA-independent mechanism. We constructed another set of YY1 deletion constructs to further localize the determinants within the B region that are required for inhibiting the LDL receptor promoter. Because deletion of neither the NH2-terminal A region nor the COOH-terminal C region affected repression, these new deletions left these regions intact and we focused on the central B region. Because the YY1 nuclear targeting region is contained within the C region, we did not have to fuse these new constructs to a heterologous nuclear targeting element. The first new mutant deleted amino acids 84–255, and the second one deleted only amino acids 256–354. These were called B2 (lacking aa 84–255) and B1 (lacking aa 256–354), respectively, and their positions within the YY1 coding sequence are schematically represented in Fig. 3A. Because these mutants were analyzed in a different expression vector that has an HSV antibody epitope added to the fusion proteins, we also reanalyzed the deletion of the entire B region and a version containing the full-length YY1 protein as well. The wild type construct inhibited the SREBP-mediated activation as before; however, none of these additional mutants had any appreciable repressive effect (Fig. 3B). An immunoblotting procedure with an antibody to the HSV epitope tag demonstrated that the mutant proteins were expressed to levels similar to that of the the full-length YY1 fusion protein (Fig. 3C). Thus, inefficient or unstable protein expression cannot account for the inability of the mutant proteins to repress the LDL receptor promoter. The data presented thus far indicate that YY1 inhibits the SREBP-stimulated activity of the LDL receptor promoter through a mechanism that does not require YY1 to be bound to the promoter. Additionally, the repression is dependent on either two separate domains of YY1 or a single domain that overlaps the junction defined by the two B region deletions. Because the repression did not require the DNA-binding domain of YY1, we evaluated whether the repressive effect could be at least partially mediated by solution interactions between YY1 and either SREBP or Sp1.Drosophila SL2 nuclear extracts prepared from cells transfected with an expression vector for human Sp1 were used as a source of Sp1 protein. This was mixed with glutathione-agarose beads that had been preincubated with GST fusion proteins containing different regions of the YY1 protein. The data in Fig. 4 document that Sp1 interacts with YY1 through the region defined in our studies as B2. This is consistent with previous reports that localized the Sp1-interacting region of YY1 to amino acids 298–331 (7Seto E. Lewis B. Shenk T. Nature. 1993; 365: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 8Lee J.-S. Galvin K.M. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6145-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). A more extensive panel of YY1-GST fusion proteins were also used to evaluate the potential interaction between YY1 and SREBP-1a. A recombinant version of SREBP-1a protein corresponding to the mature nuclear transcription factor (aa 1–490) was mixed with glutathione-tethered YY1-GST fusions, and specifically bound protein was detected with an antibody to SREBP-1a (Fig. 4B). SREBP-1a interacted with full-length YY1 (lane 5), the YY1 B fragment (lane 6), and the B2 subdomain (lane 8) but failed to interact with B1 (lane 7) or the GST control (lane 3). The data in Fig. 4Cshow that a recombinant version of SREBP that extends from aa 321–490 and contains the bHLH region but deletes the activation domain and entire amino-terminal domain of SREBP-1a still interacts with the B region of YY1. Thus, the bHLH domain of SREBP-1a and Sp1 interact with the same 100-amino acid B2 region of YY1, and importantly, this region of the YY1 protein is required to inhibit expression of the LDL receptor promoter as well (Figs. 2 and 3). We previously demonstrated that SREBP-1a and Sp1 synergistically activate the LDL receptor promoter through a novel mechanism where SREBP-1a stimulates Sp1 to bind to an adjacent DNA-binding site on the promoter and it requires the buttonhead (btd) domain of Sp1 (11Athanikar J.N. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5193-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 13Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar,19Osborne T.F. LaMorte V.J. Methods. 1998; 16: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We used a GST interaction assay to evaluate whether SREBP and Sp1 were able to interact in solution in the absence of DNA (Fig. 5A). When glutathione-bound beads were premixed with a GST-SREBP-1a fusion construct and subsequently incubated with nuclear extracts from control SL2 cells (lane 4) or SL2 cells that were transfected with a wild type Sp1 expression construct (lane 5) or a mutant Sp1 expression construct with a deletion of the btd domain (lanes 6), only extracts from cells transfected with the full-length protein generated an Sp1 immunoreactive band after electrophoresis of specifically bound proteins. The wild type and Δbtd protein were expressed at similar levels in transfected SL2 cells (compare lanes 1–3). Thus, SREBP-1a and Sp1 interact in the absence of DNA, and this interaction is dependent on the btd domain of Sp1, which is uniquely required for SREBP-Sp1 synergy at the LDL receptor promoter (11Athanikar J.N. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5193-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Because SREBP and Sp1 interact with each other and with a common domain of YY1, we sought to determine whether the bimolecular interactions were mutually exclusive. We first preincubated purified Sp1 with increasing amounts of a purified recombinant version of YY1 (shown in Fig. 5D) prior to the GST assay for SREBP-Sp1 interaction. The results of the immunoblotting protocol demonstrated that YY1 inhibited the interaction between Sp1 and SREBP-1a in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 5B). We also evaluated the ability of recombinant SREBP-1a (shown in Fig. 5D) to inhibit the interaction between YY1 and Sp1. In the experiment shown in Fig. 5C, SL2 nuclear extract from SL2 cells transfected with the Sp1 expression vector was incubated with increasing amounts of recombinant SREBP-1a prior to evaluation of Sp1 interaction with GST-bound YY1 protein. The results demonstrated that in a reciprocal fashion, SREBP-1a inhibited the interaction of Sp1 with the GST-bound YY1 protein (Fig. 5C). The results in Fig. 5C also show that the Sp1 Δbtd mutant protein does not efficiently interact with GST-bound YY1 (lanes 7 and 8). Thus, it is likely that the unique mechanism for YY1-mediated inhibition of the LDL receptor promoter is a result of the ability of YY1 to inhibit the protein-protein interaction between SREBP and Sp1, which is essential for the two proteins to effectively activate the promoter. YY1 is a multifunctional protein that can stimulate mRNA expression through binding to RNA polymerase II initiator elements (20Usheva A. Shenk T. Cell. 1994; 76: 1115-1121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), or it can either activate or repress transcription through interaction with upstream promoter elements (6Shi Y. Lee J.S. Galvin K.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F49-F66Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Different mechanisms have been proposed for YY1 inhibition including occluding the binding of an activator protein to an overlapping recognition site, a possible change in DNA topology induced upon DNA binding by YY1 (21Natesan S. Gilman M.Z. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2497-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and the recruitment of a histone deacetylase, which could lead to a localized decrease in histone acetylation at the YY1 site (22Yang W.M.

YY1 activation of gene expression appears to be complex and multidimensional as well (6Shi Y. Lee J.S. Galvin K.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Although IRAK and IRAK-2 share sequence similarity, IRAK-2 lacks key residues thought to be critical for protein kinase activity. 2E. Vig, M. Green, Y. Liu, D. B. Donner, N. Mukaida, M. G. Goebl, and M. A. Harrington, unpublished observations.This led us to question whether mPLK/IRAK protein kinase catalytic activity is essential in NF-κB activation and IL-1 signaling. Dominant-negative alleles of serine/threonine protein kinases have been generated either by mutating the lysine in protein kinase subdomain II or the aspartic acid in protein kinase subdomain VII (23van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). In mPLK/IRAK, these sites correspond to amino acid residues Lys-239 and Asp-358, respectively. Because mutation of the corresponding lysine residue in other kinases does not inevitably result in loss of catalytic activity (24Chun K.T. Goebl M.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we generated a catalytically inactive kinase by mutating the aspartic acid in protein kinase subdomain VII of mPLK/IRAK. We show here that introduction of a D358N mutation in subdomain VII of mPLK/IRAK abrogates the ability of mPLK/IRAK to induce NF-κB activity. Furthermore, mPLK/IRAKD358N functions as a dominant-negative allele because it inhibits wild-type mPLK/IRAK activity. We have used this mutation to confirm a role for mPLK/IRAK in IL-1 signaling and to identify a role for mPLK/IRAK in the TNF RI signaling pathway. The IL-8-CAT and IL-8-LUC reporter constructs contained bp −1451–+44 of the IL-8 gene (25Mukaida N. Mahe Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21128-21133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) immediately upstream of either the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (pCAT-Basic, Promega, Madison, WI) or the firefly luciferase cDNA (pGL3, Promega). The indicated mPLK cDNAs were subcloned into a mammalian expression vector that placed them under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene promoter (pCMV). The mPLK construct contained the wild-type mPLK cDNA (amino acids 1–711; Ref. 21Trofimova M. Sprenkle A.B. Green M. Sturgill T.W. Goebl M.G. Harrington M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17609-17612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The ΔmPLK cDNA encoded amino acids 33–711. The cimPLK mutant contained a point mutation at amino acid 358 (D358N) and, in in vitro kinase assays, lacked catalytic activity.2 The NIK plasmid construct contained the wild-type NIK cDNA, and ciNIK encoded NIKKK429–430 amino acids (13Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). TRAF2 encoded the wild-type TRAF2 cDNA, ΔTRAF2 encoded amino acids 87–501 (26Hsu H. Shu H.-B. Pan M.-G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar), TRADD encoded the wild-type TRADD cDNA, and ΔTRADD encoded amino acids 102–312 (27Chaudhary P.M. Eby M. Jasmin A. Bookwalter A. Murray J. Hood L. Immunity. 1997; 7: 821-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The full-length mPLK cDNA was tagged with a myc epitope at the carboxyl terminus (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA); full-length NIK cDNA contained a carboxyl-terminal FLAG epitope. Epitope-tagged mPLK and NIK constructs were determined to be biologically active in preliminary studies).2 Human embryonic kidney epithelial cells (293 cell line) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and glutamine. The C3H10T1/2 mouse embryo fibroblast cell line was maintained in Basal's modification of Eagle's media supplemented with glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. For transient transfection assays, C3H10T1/2 mouse embryo fibroblasts were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/60-mm dish, and Ca3(PO4)2 precipitates were used to introduce plasmid constructs into cells as described previously (28Harrington M.A. Konicek B. Song A. Xia X.-L. Fredericks W.J. Rauscher F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21271-21275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To monitor transfection efficiency, precipitates also included a reporter construct containing the luciferase gene under control of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter (Tk-LUC; ATCC, Manassas, VA) or the β-galactosidase gene under control of the Rous sarcoma virus LTR (RSV-βGAL; Ref. 29Edlund T. Walker M.D. Barr P.J. Rutter W.J. Science. 1985; 230: 912-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Cultures were harvested 24 or 48 h after transfection. Individual assays were normalized for luciferase activity when IL-8-CAT reporter construct activity was examined or were normalized for β-galactosidase activity when IL-8-LUC reporter construct activity was examined. Luciferase (Promega, Madison, WI) and β-galactosidase (TROPIX, Inc., Bedford, MA) activities were assayed according to the manufacturer's specifications, and data are presented as a ratio between the IL-8-CAT and Tk-LUC or IL-8-LUC and RSV-βGAL. Data are from two to three independent experiments performed in duplicate or triplicate with similar qualitative results. Monoclonal mouse anti-c-myc antibody was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Eastman Kodak Co. Chromatographically purified mouse IgG was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc.Laboratories (South San Francisco). Bacterially expressed HIS/T7-tagged mPLK was used as an immunogen to raise polyclonal antisera in rabbits (HRP Inc., Denver, PA). Crude antisera were affinity-purified using denatured mPLK protein immobilized on Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The C3H10T1/2 mouse embryo fibroblast cell line was used in the mPLK-TNF RI co-immunoprecipitation assays. Approximately 5 × 105 cells were seeded into 100-mm tissue culture dishes 24 h before treatment with recombinant mouse TNFα (100 units/ml) for 5 or 15 min. Cell monolayers were harvested, and immunocomplexing assays were performed as described below. For the mPLK-NIK co-immunoprecipitation assays, the human embryonic kidney epithelial cells (293 cell line; ATCC) were used. Approximately 2 × 106 cells were seeded into 60-mm tissue culture dishes and grown in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Plasmid constructs encoding myc-tagged mPLK and FLAG-tagged NIK were transfected into cells 16 h later by calcium phosphate precipitation (28Harrington M.A. Konicek B. Song A. Xia X.-L. Fredericks W.J. Rauscher F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21271-21275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 48 h later, cell monolayers were harvested. Cell monolayers were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation (IP) lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and complete protease inhibitors). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and cell lysates were incubated with the indicated immunoprecipitation antibody. After a 16-h incubation at 4 °C, protein A-Sepharose (10% (v/v) slurry) was added to antibody-containing cell lysates, and reactions were subject to an additional 2-h incubation at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes, collected by centrifugation, were washed two times in IP wash buffer (same as lysis buffer, except [Triton X-100] was 0.1%). Washed material was resuspended in Laemmli buffer, denatured, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 8% reducing polyacrylamide gels. Separated proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore) for Western analysis. Membranes were blocked and probed with the indicated primary antisera and HRP-conjugated secondary antibody in KPBS-T (140 mmNaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8 mmNa2HPO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 0.4% Tween 20) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk. Interactions were visualized with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to manufacturer's specifications. Treatment of a variety of cell types with inflammatory cytokines, like IL-1α and TNFα, results in transactivation of genes involved in mediating immune and inflammatory responses, including the IL-8 and E-selectin genes (25Mukaida N. Mahe Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21128-21133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Vassalli P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 411-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1809) Google Scholar). Overexpression of human IRAK induces transactivation of the NF-κB-dependent E-selectin gene promoter (11Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Therefore we first confirmed that overexpression of mPLK, the mouse IRAK homologue, transactivates an NF-κB-dependent gene promoter in mouse cells. Transient transfection of mouse embryo fibroblasts with a mammalian expression vector containing the mPLK cDNA led to approximately a 5-fold increase in the activity of the NF-κB-dependent IL-8 gene promoter (Fig. 1A). This level of mPLK-mediated induction of NF-κB activity is comparable with that detected when IRAK is overexpressed in human cells (11Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with the proposal that mPLK, like its human homologue, IRAK, lies in a signaling pathway upstream of NF-κB. Substitution of an asparagine for an aspartic acid residue (D358N) in the Mg2+-ATP binding site of mPLK created catalytically inactive mPLK protein (cimPLK).2 In contrast to results obtained with mPLK, overexpression of cimPLK did not result in transactivation of the IL-8 gene promoter (Fig. 1A). A catalytically active mPLK mutant lacking the first 33 amino acids corresponding to helix 1 of the putative mPLK/IRAK death domain (ΔmPLK; Ref. 21Trofimova M. Sprenkle A.B. Green M. Sturgill T.W. Goebl M.G. Harrington M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17609-17612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) also did not transactivate the IL-8 gene promoter (Fig. 1A). Thus, mPLK/IRAK catalytic activity and an intact amino-terminal death domain are required for mPLK to induce transactivation of the IL-8 gene promoter. To determine whether cimPLK functions in a dominant-negative manner, mouse embryo fibroblasts were co-transfected with mPLK and cimPLK. In a dose-dependent manner, cimPLK inhibited the ability of mPLK to induce IL-8 promoter activity (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained with ΔmPLK.2 The IL-8 gene promoter, like the E-selectin promoter, contains NF-κB and AP1 cis-acting elements (25Mukaida N. Mahe Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21128-21133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Whitley M.Z. Thanos D. Read M.A. Maniatis T. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6464-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Thus, the observations described above do not define which of these cis-acting elements is activated by mPLK. To verify that the mPLK effect is mediated through NF-κB, the effect of mPLK overexpression on NF-κB-dependent promoters was examined. Like the IL-8 gene promoter, overexpression of mPLK increased E-selectin promoter activity (4-fold; Fig. 1C) and stimulated the activity of a reporter construct under the control of tandem NF-κB sites (see Fig. 3C; Ref.32Hedin K.E. Bell M.P. Kalli K.R. Huntoon C.J. Sharp B.M. McKean D.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5431-5440PubMed Google Scholar). Because the E-selectin and IL-8 promoters also contain binding sites for AP1 family members, we examined whether mPLK affected the activity of an IL-11 promoter construct known to be AP1-dependent (33Yang L. Yang Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32732-32739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although TNFα treatment led to a 4-fold increase in IL-11 promoter activity, overexpression of mPLK had no effect on IL-11 promoter activity (Fig. 1D). These data demonstrate that mPLK/IRAK lies in a signaling pathway upstream of NF-κB. The NF-κB-inducing kinase, NIK, is a component of the type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1RI)-signaling cascade leading to NF-κB activation (13Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether induction of the IL-8 gene promoter by mPLK required NIK. Transfection of mouse embryo fibroblasts with NIK led to an approximate 18-fold increase in IL-8 gene promoter activity (Fig. 2). Co-transfection with cimPLK or ΔmPLK had no effect upon NIK-mediated activation of the IL-8 gene promoter (Fig. 2). Malinin et al. (13Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar) describe a dominant-negative allele of NIK, ciNIK (K429A,K430A), capable of blocking IL-1 or TNFα-induced transactivation of the E-selectin gene promoter. However this construct has no effect on p65-induced E-selectin gene promoter activity. We examined whether ciNIK overexpression would affect the ability of mPLK to induce IL-8 gene promoter activity. Results of these assays suggested that mPLK/IRAK-mediated transactivation of the IL-8 gene promoter requires NIK (Fig. 2). NIK and mPLK/IRAK are thought to mediate activation of NF-κB through the IL-1RI (11Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 13Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). IRAK-2, which lacks conserved residues in key protein kinase subdomains, can also modulate IL-1-induced NF-κB activation (6Muzio M. Ni P. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 278: 1612-1615Crossref Scopus (984) Google Scholar). Therefore we determined whether mPLK/IRAK catalytic activity is necessary for IL-1-dependent activation of the IL-8 gene promoter. Overexpression of wild-type mPLK did not block IL-1 induction of IL-8 gene promoter activity (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, neither cimPLK nor ΔmPLK decreased IL-1 induction of IL-8 promoter activity (Fig. 3A). We therefore examined whether the link between IL-1 and mPLK/IRAK activity in mouse embryo fibroblasts was similar to that described for mPLK/IRAK activity in human cells. Overexpression of amino-terminal IRAK (amino acids 1–208 or 1–215) or IRAK-2 (amino acids 1–96) mutants inhibit IL-1-dependent NF-κB activation in human cells (6Muzio M. Ni P. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 278: 1612-1615Crossref Scopus (984) Google Scholar, 7Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Kopp E. Stadlen A. Chen C. Ghosh S. Janeway C.A. Mol.

Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Therefore we prepared an mPLK mutant that contained only amino-terminal residues 1–156. Overexpression of the mPLK mutant containing only amino-terminal residues 1–156 in mouse embryo fibroblasts blocked IL-1-dependent NF-κB activation.2 This result is consistent with that described for amino-terminal IRAK mutants expressed in human cells (6Muzio M. Ni P. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 278: 1612-1615Crossref Scopus (984) Google Scholar, 7Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Kopp E. Stadlen A. Chen C. Ghosh S. Janeway C.A. Mol.

Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar) and suggests that mPLK activity in mouse cells functions in a manner similar to that proposed for IRAK in human cells. However, when mouse embryo fibroblasts transfected with dominant-negative mPLK/IRAK were treated with IL-1α for varying times, higher levels of IL-8 promoter activity were detected as compared with IL-1-treated fibroblasts transfected with vector alone (Fig. 3B). To confirm that the enhanced response in IL-1-treated cultures overexpressing cimPLK was mediated through NF-κB, transient transfection assays were repeated with a reporter construct containing only NF-κB sites ([NF-κB]3-LUC; Ref. 32Hedin K.E. Bell M.P. Kalli K.R. Huntoon C.J. Sharp B.M. McKean D.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5431-5440PubMed Google Scholar). Trace amounts of [NF-κB]-LUC activity were detected in cultures transfected with either expression vector minus a cDNA insert or with cimPLK. As was seen for IL-8 promoter activity, a 6-h IL-1 treatment increased [NF-κB]3-LUC activity 2-fold, and in cultures transfected with cimPLK, IL-1 treatment increased [NF-κB]3-LUC activity 4-fold. Thus, it appears that NF-κB-dependent signaling through the IL-1RI can be blocked by overexpressing amino-terminal mPLK/IRAK residues or enhanced by overexpressing catalytically inactive mPLK/IRAK. NIK also mediates activation of NF-κB through the TNF RI, which contains a death domain that associates with other death domain-containing proteins during signaling (13Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar, 34Song H.Y. Regnier C.H. Kirschning C.J. Goeddel D.V. Rothe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sci. 1995; 20: 342-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The presence of a death domain motif in mPLK/IRAK (21Trofimova M. Sprenkle A.B. Green M. Sturgill T.W. Goebl M.G. Harrington M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17609-17612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) suggested that mPLK/IRAK may be a component of the TNFα as well as the IL-1-signaling pathways. Treatment of mouse embryo fibroblasts with TNFα results in approximately a 30-fold increase in IL-8 gene promoter activity (Fig. 3C). When mouse embryo fibroblasts transfected with mPLK are treated with TNFα, no additional increase in IL-8 gene promoter activity is observed (Fig. 3C). However, when mouse embryo fibroblasts are transfected with cimPLK or ΔmPLK, TNFα-induced transactivation of the IL-8 gene promoter is decreased (Fig. 3C). The cimPLK- and ΔmPLK-mediated decrease in TNFα-induced activation of the IL-8 gene promoter was dose-dependent; however, overexpression of either cimPLK or ΔmPLK did not completely abrogate a TNF-dependent signal.2 Analysis of cells derived from TNF RI and TNF RII nulligenic animals revealed that TNF-induced NF-κB activity is mediated solely through TNF RI (36Kalb A.

To begin to understand the mechanism that controls this differential gene expression, we have analyzed the levels ofamastin and trans-sialidase mRNAs and the mRNAs encoding members of the 85-kDa glycoprotein gene family, which are differentially expressed in the T. cruzi stages found in the mammalian host. Amastin mRNA is expressed predominantly in intracellular and proliferative amastigotes.trans-Sialidase mRNAs are found mostly in forms undergoing transformation from amastigotes to trypomastigotes inside infected cells, whereas mRNAs encoding the 85-kDa glycoproteins appear only in the infective trypomastigotes released from the cells. The genes coding for these mRNA species are constitutively transcribed in all stages of T. cruzi cells, suggesting that expression is controlled post-transcriptionally during differentiation. Inhibition of transcription by actinomycin D revealed that each mRNA species has a relatively long half-life in stages where it accumulates. In the case of the trans-sialidase and 85-kDa glycoprotein genes, mRNA accumulation was induced by treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide at the stages that preceded the normal accumulation. Therefore, mRNA stabilization may account for mRNA accumulation. mRNA degradation could be promoted by proteins with high turnover, or stabilization could be promoted by forming a complex with the translational machinery at defined times in development.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5945-5956Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Well defined RNA polymerase II initiation sites have not been found, and most genes are transcribed as part of polycistronic units and are processed bytrans-splicing (8Huang J. van der Ploeg L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3180-3190Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 9Tschudi C. Ullu E. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). During processing, capped spliced leader sequence is added to the 5′-end, and a polyadenosine tail is added to the 3′-end of mRNA (10Ullu E. Matthews K.R. Tschudi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), probably ensuring mRNA stability and transport to the cytoplasm (11Sutton R.E. Boothroyd J.C. Cell. 1986; 47: 527-535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In particular, correct splicing and polyadenylation, as well as the existence of specific 3′-untranslated portions of the transcribed genes, have been shown to promote either mRNA stability (12Hotz H.-R. Hartmann C. Huober K. Hug M. Clayton C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3017-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) or an increase in the translational efficiency (13Furger A. Schurch N. Kurath U. Roditi I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4372-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, the nature of controlling factors and how environmental modifications induce differential expression remain obscure.T. cruzi provides an attractive model to study how modifications in the environment induce differential gene expression. In the insect host, the epimastigote form of the parasite proliferates in the gut. In the posterior gut, where the nutrients become scarce, the parasite transforms into metacyclic trypomastigote forms, which are nonproliferative and highly infective to the mammalian host. Within the mammalian host, the parasite proliferates only inside the cell cytoplasm, as amastigote forms. Once the infected cell is full of parasites, and probably deprived of nutrients, the amastigote form transforms into nonproliferative and infective trypomastigote forms, which rupture the cell, escaping to the bloodstream. The differentiation between noninfective and infective forms is related to the shutdown of the proliferative machinery and the expression of a set of genes involved in cell invasion and induction of resistance to host defenses (14Cross G.A.M.

TS is encoded by a family of ∼80 genes that have a common amino-terminal domain, which includes the catalytic portion of the enzyme, and a variable number of 12-amino acid repeats in the carboxyl-terminal region (39Egima C.M. Briones M.R.S. Freitas-Junior L.H.G. Schenkman R.P.F. Uemura H. Schenkman S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).To investigate how expression of the Tc85 and TSgenes is regulated during T. cruzi differentiation, the steady-state levels of mRNA coding for these proteins have been analyzed. This study revealed that the corresponding mRNAs accumulate at different time periods during the differentiation of intracellular amastigotes to extracellular trypomastigotes. The time of accumulation depends on the number of infected parasites per cell, suggesting that interaction with the host cell environment is involved in the control of TS and Tc85 gene expression. To initiate a systematic characterization of the controlling mechanism, the rate of transcription in lysolecithin-permeabilized parasites and the mRNA stability in the presence of transcription and translation inhibitors have been studied.RESULTSThe morphology of T. cruzi stages found during differentiation of intracellular amastigotes to extracellular trypomastigotes is shown in Fig. 1. As the infected cell becomes full of amastigotes (shown in Fig. 1a), intracellular parasites start to elongate, and a clear flagellum can be recognized (Fig. 1b). However, these intermediate forms are morphologically distinct from the released trypomastigotes. They show a migration of the flagellum insertion point (flagellar pocket) to the anterior end of the parasite, as is typical of trypomastigote forms (Fig. 1c). The kinetoplast (mitochondrial DNA) follows the apparent migration of the flagellar pocket and is found at several orientations with respect to the nucleus. Mechanically released intermediate forms do not swim and are clearly different from the other stages. Intermediate forms are also distinct from epimastigotes, which have the kinetoplast in a position similar to intracellular amastigotes (Fig. 1d). To follow the molecular events occurring during this differentiation process, expression of the amastin, TS, and Tc85 genes was studied in typical amastigotes, in intermediate forms, and in trypomastigotes released from infected cells. Trypomastigotes released from over-infected cells were discarded, as they contained round forms, morphologically similar to amastigotes.By measuring the steady-state levels of the transcripts corresponding to amastin, TS, and Tc85 mRNAs in these different stages, we found that amastin mRNA is mainly expressed in intracellular amastigotes, as shown previously (5Teixeira S.M.R. Kirchhoff L.V. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22586-22594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).TS mRNA is mainly expressed in the intermediate forms, and Tc85 mRNA is detected only in extracellular trypomastigotes (Fig. 2). All these mRNAs are weakly expressed in epimastigotes. TubulinmRNA levels are approximately constant in epimastigotes and intermediate forms and slightly reduced in amastigotes and trypomastigotes. The reduced levels of tubulin mRNA in amastigotes may be related to this being a spherical stage; thus, amastigotes contain less tubulin. In released trypomastigotes, the reduced levels of tubulin mRNA may be related to the decrease in the overall amount of mRNA in this differentiated nondividing stage. In fact, large numbers of trypomastigotes have been used to obtain equivalent amounts of total RNA compared with the other stages. When the same number of parasites, instead of the same amount of total RNA or poly(A)+ RNA of each stage, were used in the blot, similar qualitative results were obtained (data not shown). In this case, TS mRNA was found also mainly in intracellular trypomastigotes, and Tc85 mRNA only in extracellular trypomastigotes.Figure 2Steady-state levels of amastin, TS, and Tc85 mRNAs during T. cruzi development. 5 μg of total RNA from epimastigotes (E; equivalent to 1 × 107parasites), intracellular amastigotes (A; equivalent to 2 × 107 parasites), intracellular intermediate forms (IT, equivalent to 1 × 107 parasites), and trypomastigotes (T; equivalent to 4 × 107parasites) was fractionated on formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gels; transferred to nylon membranes; and probed successively with an α/β-tubulin coding sequence, a DNA probe coding foramastin, and a probe coding for the carboxy-terminus repeats repeats of TS. A similar membrane was probed with the catalytic domain of TS and a probe for the Tc85 glycoprotein subfamily.

Under these conditions, nascent RNAs are elongated and processed bytrans-splicing and polyadenylation (50Ullu E. Tschudi C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3319-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3a, transcription occurred intensely in all stages for the TS, amastin, and Tc85 genes. There was no decrease in transcription of the genes that showed diminished steady-state levels, suggesting that these genes are constitutively transcribed to similar extents in all developmental stages. As TS genes are organized in long tandem repeats, with each open reading frame separated by ∼2 kilobases (Fig. 3c), the possibility of transcription along the intergenic region was also examined. As shown in Fig. 3b, comparable levels of transcription were found in coding and noncoding regions ofTS genes. Moreover, no mature mRNA was detected at any stage using the intergenic region to probe Northern blots (data not shown), suggesting that this region probably does not produce stable mRNA.Figure 3TS, Tc85, and amastin genes are constitutively transcribed duringT. cruzi development. Epimastigotes (E), intracellular amastigotes (A), intermediate forms (IT), and trypomastigotes (T) were permeabilized with lysolecithin and incubated with [α-32P]UTP for 30 min as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Total RNA was extracted and used to hybridize to membranes containing 5 μg of the indicated plasmids.a and b show the results of two independent experiments, and c shows the positions of the TS probes relative to the gene. kb, kilobase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Our results indicate that TS genes are highly expressed in the transition forms arising from differentiation between amastigotes to trypomastigotes, just before parasites are released from the infected cell. This finding suggests that the TS gene expression mechanism is associated with the differentiation process. Two possibilities could explain this association: 1) TS gene expression is a programmed event and occurs after a given number of amastigote divisions; and 2) TS gene expression is activated by a mechanism that depends on factors produced by the infected cell. Such factors would become available when a certain degree of infection is reached, and this would induce the accumulation of TSmRNA. To distinguish between these two possibilities, L6E6 cells were infected with increasing numbers of parasites, and after different periods of time, the percentage of intermediate forms and the level ofTS mRNA were measured in the same amount of intracellular parasites. The time of appearance and the prevalence of intermediate forms were dependent on the size of the initial inoculum. The larger the infective load, the sooner intermediate forms were detected, at least 48 h after infection (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the accumulation ofTS mRNA paralleled the accumulation of intermediate forms. This suggests that the switch from amastigote to trypomastigote depends on the parasite burden within the infected cells and does not seem to be programmed by the number of cell divisions of the amastigote forms.Figure 4The time of TS gene expression depends on the degree of cell infection. Subconfluent L6E6 cells in 75-cm2 flasks were infected with 0.5 × 107, 1.0 × 107, and 3.0 × 107 parasites. After 48, 64, and 72 h, intracellular parasites were collected; the total RNA was isolated; and 5 μg of total RNA from each time point was fractionated on formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gels.

Experientia (Basel). 1991; 47: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), was used to study the stability of amastin, TS, and Tc85 mRNAs during intracellular development of the parasite. Amastigote, intermediate, and trypomastigote forms were treated for different incubation periods with actinomycin D, and the amount of each mRNA species was studied by Northern blot analysis. The concentration of actinomycin D used in the experiments is known to block transcription in all stages of T. cruzi (5Teixeira S.M.R. Kirchhoff L.V. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22586-22594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The RNA loaded in each lane corresponded to total RNA isolated from 1 × 108 extracellular trypomastigotes, 3 × 107 amastigotes, or 3 × 107 intermediate forms. As shown in Fig. 5, amastin mRNA was quite stable in amastigotes with a half-life of 2–3 h, whereastubulin mRNA had a shorter half-life (data not shown). Very little TSand Tc85 mRNAs were detected in amastigotes, and therefore, their half-lives could not have been estimated accurately. In contrast, TS mRNA was stable in intermediate forms (half-life longer than 4 h) (Fig. 5b). In this case, tubulin mRNA decayed much faster (half-life of ∼1 h; data not shown).Figure 5Amastin and TS mRNAs are stabilized in amastigotes and intermediate forms. Intracellular amastigotes (a) and intermediate forms (b) were collected from L6E6 myoblasts infected with T. cruzi and incubated without (control (C); ■) or with (♦) 0.1 mg/ml actinomycin D (Act. D) as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” At the indicated times, total RNA was extracted, fractionated on formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gels, and hybridized with the amastin and TS probes containing the repeats.

In the absence of actinomycin D, the level of mRNAs coding for the TS gene decreased, whereas theTc85 mRNA levels were constant in recently released trypomastigotes (Fig. 6). These trypomastigotes were collected no more than 3 h after they were released from the infected cell. When the parasites were incubated in the presence of actinomycin D, Tc85 mRNA was the most stable (half-life of ∼3 h), followed by TS mRNA (half-life of 1.5 h) and tubulin mRNA (half-life of 0.7 h) (Fig. 6). In trypomastigotes collected after 12 h, the levels of TS, Tc85, and tubulinmRNAs rapidly decayed (half-life of ∼0.7 h; data not shown).Figure 6Tc85 mRNA is stabilized in trypomastigote forms. Trypomastigotes were collected from the supernatant of infected cells and incubated with actinomycin D (Act. D; 0.1 mg/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Total RNA was extracted from the drug-treated (♦) or control (C; ■) parasites at the indicated times; fractionated on formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gels; and hybridized with tubulin (a),TS (b), and Tc85 (c) probes.

Wisdom R. Verma I.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 519-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and blocking protein synthesis can reveal at what stage the control is exerted in the gene expression pathway. Thus, we studied the effect of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of polypeptide chain elongation, on the levels of TS and Tc85 mRNAs during intracellular development of T. cruzi. Different parasite stages were incubated in the presence of 250 ng/ml cycloheximide, which blocks protein synthesis in the T. cruzi stages studied (5Teixeira S.M.R. Kirchhoff L.V. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22586-22594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 43Pereira I.S. Astolfi Filho S. Gander E.S. Acta Trop. 1982; 39: 275-279PubMed Google Scholar); after different periods of treatment, the total RNA was extracted, and the amounts ofTS and Tc85 mRNAs were analyzed by Northern blotting. In the amastigote forms, TS (but notTc85) transcripts increased with time in the presence of the drug (Fig. 7, a and b). Tc85 RNA was not detected in amastigotes even after long exposures. In contrast, cycloheximide did not affect the level of TS mRNA, but increased the amount ofTc85 transcripts by a factor of 3 in intermediate forms after 2 h of treatment (Fig. 7, c and d). In intermediate forms, TS RNA was stable. The addition of cycloheximide to recently released trypomastigotes promoted an increase in TS mRNA levels and only a small increase inTc85 mRNA levels (Fig. 7, e and f). Thus, cycloheximide induces strong accumulation of mRNA species mainly in the developmental stages preceding those in which expression of a specific mRNA is maximal.Figure 7A labile protein factor negatively controls the onset of TS and Tc85 gene expression.Intracellular amastigotes (a and b) and intermediate forms (c and d) were collected from infected L6E6 myoblasts. Trypomastigotes (e and f) were collected from the supernatant of infected cells. The parasites were incubated in the absence (control (C); ■) or presence (♦) of cycloheximide (CH; 250 ng/ml). The total RNA was extracted at the indicated times, fractionated on formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gels, and hybridized withTS (a, c, and e) and Tc85 (b, d, and f) probes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONWe have shown that during the intracellular development ofT. cruzi, mRNAs coding for amastin, TS, and Tc85are sequentially expressed during intracellular differentiation of amastigotes to trypomastigotes. Theamastin mRNA level is high in proliferating amastigotes;TS mRNA is found mainly in the intermediate forms undergoing transformation from amastigotes to trypomastigotes; and Tc85 mRNA is observed only in extracellular trypomastigote forms. Fig. 8schematically represents a model for the timing of the expression of these three genes. It is noteworthy that TS gene expression anticipates the expression of Tc85, suggesting that these two proteins act at different times, despite the fact that both have been implicated in cell invasion. It is important to note that the amount of mRNA may not reflect directly the level of protein or enzymatic activity. Nevertheless, TS might be mostly required at the moment the parasite is released from the infected cell, whereas Tc85 may be important for the adhesion to new host cells, as suggested before (25Abuin G. Colli W. de Souza W. Alves M.J.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 35: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 54Pereira M.E.A. Wyler D. Modern Parasite Biology. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1990: 64-78Google Scholar). This hypothesis agrees with findings that recently released parasites are poorly invasive, and invasion competence is acquired after a certain time (55Boschetti M.A. Piras M.M. Henriquez D. Piras R.

IκBβ was present in the nucleus of HIV-1-infected cells and participated in the ternary complex formation with NF-κB and DNA. In contrast to uninfected cells, the addition of recombinant glutathione S-transferase-IκBα protein to preformed NF-κB·DNA complexes from HIV-1-infected cell extracts did not completely dissociate the complexes, suggesting that IκBβ may protect NF-κB complexes from IκBα-mediated dissociation.

In addition, co-transfection studies with an NF-κB-dependent reporter construct demonstrated that IκBβ co-expression partially alleviated inhibition of NF-κB-mediated gene expression by IκBα, implying that IκBβ can maintain transcriptionally active NF-κB·DNA complexes. Furthermore, constitutive phosphorylation of IκBα was observed.

Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5613) Google Scholar, and 16Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2943) Google Scholar). In most cells, NF-κB is found sequestered in the cytoplasm by inhibitory IκB proteins. Several IκB proteins have been identified including IκBα, IκBβ, and most recently, IκBε (17Whiteside S.T. Epinat J. Rice N.R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The precursor proteins p100 and p105 can also serve as functional IκB molecules, retaining NF-κB in the cytoplasm although their regulation is less well understood. Serine phosphorylation of IκBα at Ser-32 and Ser-36 represents the critical regulatory signal leading to ubiquitin-dependent, proteosome-mediated degradation of IκB, which allows NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus and activate NF-κB-dependent genes. Recently, several groups have identified the IκB kinase complex (IKK) (18Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T.

Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar), a multisubunit complex that phosphorylates both IκBα and IκBβ (24Maniatis T. Science. 1997; 278: 818-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 25Stancovski I. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 91: 299-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Several pathways of NF-κB activation are thought to converge at the level of IKK activation, implicating this complex as a critical regulator of NF-κB transcriptional regulation. The multimeric IKK complex includes two subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, which are responsible for phosphorylating IκB molecules. Several other components of the IKK complex have been identified including the regulatory subunit NEMO (NF-κB essential modulator, also called IKKγ) (26Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 27Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar) and a scaffolding protein, IKAP (IKK-associated protein) (28Cohen L. Henzel W.J. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), which binds the IKK subunits and, together with NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), assembles them into an active kinase complex. The IKK complex is rapidly stimulated by TNFα, IL-1, and PMA, although the mechanism of activation requires further elucidation. Recently, NIK was found to activate IKKα directly (29Ling L. Cao Z. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3792-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), confirming earlier reports that NIK co-expression leads to IKKα phosphorylation (19Régnier C. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). MEKK-1 has also been found tightly associated in the IKK complex (21Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J.W. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1858) Google Scholar) and has been shown to stimulate IKK activity (30Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Further studies are required to determine whether these kinases are essential upstream regulators of IKK activity. Rapid resynthesis of IκBα establishes an autoregulatory loop whereby NF-κB activation is self-limited. Unlike IκBα, IκBβ is not an NF-κB-regulated gene and is not rapidly resynthesized after inducer-mediated degradation (31Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Several inducers, however, result in persistent NF-κB activation, which has been associated with the additional release of NF-κB from IκBβ complexes and its resynthesis in a hypophosphorylated form that sustains NF-κB activation (32Suyang H. Phillips R. Douglas I. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Phillips R.J. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4390-4396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hypophosphorylated IκBβ can bind NF-κB without masking its nuclear localization signal (32Suyang H. Phillips R. Douglas I. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus acting as a chaperone for NF-κB nuclear entry and preventing its sequestration by IκBα. Recently, two isoforms of IκBβ that differ in their C-terminal PEST domain as a consequence of alternative splicing have been identified in human cells (34Hirano F. Chung M. Tanaka H. Maruyama N. Maruyana N. Makino I. Moore D. Scheidereit C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2596-2607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The larger protein, approximately 43 kDa, is homologous to the murine IκBβ, whereas the 41-kDa form is unique to human cells. The 43-kDa protein degrades upon stimulation and enters the nucleus when hypophosphorylated, whereas the 41-kDa protein is resistant to degradation by several inducers and is found only in the cytoplasm (34Hirano F. Chung M. Tanaka H. Maruyama N. Maruyana N. Makino I. Moore D. Scheidereit C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2596-2607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, the mechanism underlying constitutive activation of NF-κB in HIV-1-infected myeloid cells has been examined. We demonstrate that the association of nuclear IκBβ with NF-κB·DNA complexes maintains persistent NF-κB·DNA binding activity, and we show that the IKK complex is constitutively activated in HIV-1-infected cells. Constitutive IKK activity and protection of NF-κB·DNA activity from IκBα-mediated dissociation by nuclear IκBβ may explain the persistent NF-κB-dependent gene activation observed in HIV-1-infected cells. Promonocytic U937 and HIV-1-infected U9-IIIB cells, as well as myelomonoblastic PLB-985 and HIV-1-infected PLB-IIIB cells (infected with HIV strain IIIB), were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% Fetal Clone I (Hyclone), 2 mm l-glutamine, and 20 μg/ml gentamicin (Schering Canada). Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were cultured in modified Eagle's medium (α-MEM) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (Biomedia Canada), 2 mm l-glutamine, and 20 μg/ml gentamicin. IκBα human cDNA bearing a 22-amino acid C-terminal truncation in the PEST domain (IκB-Δ4, which inhibits NF-κB binding as efficiently as wild type) was subcloned into pGEX 2T as described previously (35Lin R. Beauparlant P. Makris C. Meloche S. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1401-1409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GST·IκBα-(1-55) and GST·IκBα-(1-55) (S32A/S36A) were a kind gift from Antonis Koromilas. DH5α bacteria expressing GST·proteins were grown in Luria broth, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 10% Triton in phosphate-buffered saline, and sonicated. Protein was recovered using Sepharose 4B glutathione beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with 20 mm GSH (Calbiochem) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Isolation purity and quantity were confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Coomassie Blue staining, and a visual comparison with bovine serum albumin standards. Nuclear extracts were prepared from untreated cells or cells treated for varying times with one of the following inducers: TNFα (10 ng/ml, R & D Systems), PMA (50 ng/ml, Sigma), or IL-1β (5 ng/ml, R & D Systems). An electrophoretic mobility shift assay was carried out using an NF-κB32P-labeled probe corresponding to the PRDII region of the IFN-β promoter (5′-GGAAATTCCGGGAAATTCC-3′) as described (5D'Addario M. Wainberg M.A. Hiscott J. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1222-1229PubMed Google Scholar). In supershift experiments, the antibody (36Garoufalis E. Kwan I. Lin R. Mustafa A. Pepin N. Roulston A. Lacoste J. Hiscott J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4707-4715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and its corresponding peptide where indicated (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), were incubated with 5 μg of nuclear extract for 20 min. Poly(dI·dC) (5 μg) was added for an additional 10 min followed by incubation with labeled probe for 20 min. All steps were carried out at room temperature. In other experiments in which GST fusion proteins were used, nuclear extracts were incubated with poly(dI·dC) for 10 min and then incubated with labeled probe for 20 min. Increasing amounts of GST·IκBα Δ4 (10 ng/μl) were added for an additional 20 min. The resulting protein-DNA complexes were resolved by a 5% Tris/glycine gel and exposed to x-ray film. To demonstrate the specificity of protein-DNA complex formation, 125-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was added to the nuclear extract before adding the labeled probe. Whole cell extracts were prepared by resuspending the cells in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and examined by Western blot analysis as described previously (12DeLuca C. Roulston A. Koromilas A. Wainberg M.A. Hiscott J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5183-5193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IκBβ antibodies C20 (recognizes the 43-kDa isoform) and G20 (recognizes both the 43- and 41-kDa forms) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The phosphoserine 32 IκBα antibody was purchased from New England Biolabs, and the monoclonal IκBα antisera MAD-10B was a kind gift from Ron Hay (37Jaffray E. Wood K.M. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2166-2172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The α-tubulin antibody was obtained from ICN and the actin antisera from Sigma. The ECL-Western blotting detection system (NEN Life Science Products) was used according to manufacturer's instructions to visualize the specific signals. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were transfected in 100-mm plates by the calcium phosphate DNA precipitate transfection method. Each plate was transfected with 7 μg of NF-κB CAT (PRDII element of the IFNβ gene linked to CAT) and either 4 μg of pSVK3-IκBα and 4 μg of pSVK3 empty vector, with 4 μg of pSVK3-IκBα and 4 μg of pSVK3-IκBβ, or 8 μg of empty vector. Cells were incubated with precipitate for 12 h after which time they were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fed with fresh medium. Cells were maintained for an additional 36 h and stimulated with PMA (50 ng/ml) for the last 24, 16, or 8 h of the transfection. CAT activity was determined using 100 μg of total cell extract assayed for 2 h at 37 °C. Quantitation of activities was performed using NIH Image 1.60 software. The fold activation reported is the average of a minimum of three experiments with error bars representing the standard deviation. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Pellets were resuspended in TNN buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 0.5 mmspermine, 0.15 mm spermidine, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mm NaVO4) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Supernatants were removed after centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C) and assayed for protein concentration. 150–300 μg of protein extract was incubated with 5 μl of IKKα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 2 μl of normal rabbit serum for 2 h while rotating at 4 °C. 20 μl of protein A-conjugated Sepharose beads, washed three times with TNN buffer, were added to the mixture and incubated with rotation at 4 °C for an additional hour. Beads were pelleted (1000 rpm) and washed once with TNN and twice with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml chymostatin, 5 μg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin, and 1 mm each dithiothreitol, NaF, and NaVO4). Beads were resuspended in 20 μl of kinase mix containing 2 μg of GST·IκBα-(1–55) or IκBα-(1–55) (S32A/S36A) and 0.5 μCi of γ-ATP and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. 20 μl of 2× SDS loading dye was added to each reaction, boiled for 5 min, and separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was fixed and Coomassie-stained (5% acetic acid, 10% ethanol, Coomassie Blue dye). It was subsequently destained (5% acetic acid, 10% ethanol), dried, and exposed to film for 1–3 h at −80 °C. Previous studies demonstrated that myeloid cell lines PLB-985 and U937 acquire constitutive NF-κB·DNA binding activity upon HIV-1 infection (9Bachelerie F. Alcami J. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.-L. Nature. 1991; 350: 709-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 10Roulston A. D'Addario M. Boulerice F. Caplan S. Wainberg M. Hiscott J. J. Exp.

Pelletier N. Wainberg M.A. Hiscott J. Virology. 1998; 244: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Analysis of this complex revealed that the DNA binding activity was composed predominantly of RelA and p50 heterodimers with a minor contribution by c-Rel and p50 heterodimers (10Roulston A. D'Addario M. Boulerice F. Caplan S. Wainberg M. Hiscott J. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Roulston A. Beauparlant P. Rice N.R. Hiscott J. J.

To investigate the possibility that IκBβ may be involved in maintaining this persistent activation, nuclear extracts prepared from HIV-1-infected PLB-IIIB and U9-IIIB cells were analyzed for DNA binding levels by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Analysis of NF-κB·DNA binding activity, using an IκBβ-specific antibody that recognized the 43-kDa isoform of IκBβ, demonstrated that IκBβ protein was a part of the DNA binding complex (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 10) and could be detected in cells stimulated with TNFα or IL-1β for 6 h (Fig. 1A, lanes 5 and 7). Preincubation with the cognate peptide recognized by the IκBβ antibody demonstrated the specificity of antibody recognition (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 11), whereas incubation with excess unlabeled NF-κB probe competed the NF-κB-specific complexes (Fig. 1A, lane 8). Similar experiments using IκBα did not produce a shifted complex (data not shown), suggesting that IκBβ was uniquely present in HIV-1-infected cells. Uninfected PLB-985 and U937 cells stimulated with TNFα or PMA for 18 h (Fig. 1B, lanes 9,14, and 16), but not cells treated for shorter times (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 5), likewise exhibited an NF-κB·DNA binding complex that could be supershifted with IκBβ antibody. Induction of PLB-IIIB cells with TNFα or PMA for 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, or 18 h revealed that IκBβ remained part of the DNA binding complex over the course of induction (Fig. 1C and data not shown). The presence of IκBβ in the nuclear compartment of HIV-1-infected myeloid cells was confirmed by biochemical fractionation. Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from PLB-IIIB and PLB-985 cells stimulated with TNFα or PMA were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted for IκBβ. Whereas IκBβ was present in the cytoplasm and nucleus of HIV-1-infected cells (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 6), IκBβ was predominantly cytoplasmic in noninfected PLB-985 cells (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 6). IκBβ was present in the nucleus of HIV-1-infected cells after stimulation with TNFα or PMA (Fig. 2A,lanes 7–10), and low levels were also detected in stimulated PLB-985 cells (Fig. 2B, lanes 7–10). Nuclear extracts were shown to be free of cytoplasmic contamination by reprobing with α-tubulin antibody (Fig. 2, A and B, lower panels). Similar results were obtained with U937 and U9-IIIB cells (data not shown). Because previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that NF-κB·DNA complexes are sensitive to dissociation by IκBα (38Zabel U. Baeuerle P.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 255-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 39Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thompson J. Rodriguez M.S. Bachelerie F. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the possibility that IκBβ protects NF-κB·DNA complexes from IκBα dissociation was evaluated. The NF-κB·DNA binding complex from HIV-1-infected U9-IIIB cells was resistant to GST·IκBα-mediated dissociation (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–3). Furthermore, GST·IκBα did not reduce NF-κB binding to levels lower than those observed in unstimulated HIV-1-infected cells (Fig. 3A, lanes 4–15). Similar results were obtained with PLB-IIIB cells (Fig. 3B), suggesting this phenomenon was a property of HIV-1-infected myeloid cells. In contrast, NF-κB·DNA complexes from TNFα- or PMA-stimulated PLB-985 and U937 cells were completely dissociated by GST·IκBα (Fig. 3,C and D, lanes 2, 3, 5, and 6). Next, nuclear extracts were immunodepleted of IκBβ using an IκBβ-specific antibody and analyzed for NF-κB·DNA binding. Incubation of PMA-stimulated U9-IIIB nuclear extracts with GST·IκBα reduced the amount of NF-κB·DNA binding complexes but did not completely dissociate NF-κB binding activity (Fig. 4A, lanes 1–6). In contrast, extracts immunodepleted for IκBβ were sensitive to GST·IκBα-mediated dissociation (Fig. 4A, lanes 9–14). In this case, levels of NF-κB binding were reduced to the levels observed in uninfected U937 cells (Fig. 3D), indicating that IκBβ played a role in maintaining NF-κB·DNA binding activity in infected cells. Furthermore, the use of control serum for the immunodepletion step did not increase the sensitivity of the protein-DNA complex to IκBα-mediated dissociation (Fig. 4A, lanes 7 and 8), indicating that the effect was specific. Similar results were obtained with untreated and PMA-induced PLB-IIIB cells (Fig. 4B). Like U9-IIIB cells, IκBβ-depleted PLB-IIIB extracts were sensitive to GST·IκBα-mediated dissociation of NF-κB·DNA binding activity (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 2 and 4 withlanes 6 and 8), indicating that nuclear IκBβ maintained IκBα-insensitive NF-κB·DNA binding activity in HIV-1-infected cells. Supershift analysis further revealed that similar NF-κB·DNA binding complexes were present before and after IκBβ immunodepletion in PMA-stimulated (Fig. 4C, lanes 1–4 and 9–12) and TNFα-stimulated (Fig. 4C,lanes 5–8 and 13–16) U9-IIIB (Fig. 4C) and PLB-IIIB (data not shown) cells, arguing against the specific immunodepletion of an IκBα-insensitive NF-κB complex. Next, a series of co-transfection experiments were performed to determine whether IκBβ co-expression affected NF-κB-mediated transcription and to examine whether IκBβ blocked the inhibitory effect of IκBα. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were transfected with an NF-κB-driven CAT reporter plasmid and empty vector or reporter plasmid and pSVK3-IκBα and/or pSVK3-IκBβ expression plasmids. PMA (50 ng/ml) was added for 0, 8, 16, or 24 h, and transactivation was assessed by comparing CAT activity levels. PMA-stimulated cells transfected with both IκBα and IκBβ partially alleviated the IκBα-mediated repression of transcription (Fig. 5, compare 24-h IκBα, IκBα and IκBβ, and pSVK3 levels) and exhibited a 50% increase in NF-κB-dependent expression compared with cells transfected with IκBα alone (Fig. 5). This result indicated that IκBβ expression partially reversed the inhibitory effects of IκBα and increased NF-κB-mediated transcription. The regulation of IκBβ protein turnover was investigated next. Antibodies recognizing the 43-kDa isoform or both the 43- and 41-kDa isoforms were used to analyze the rate of IκBβ basal turnover and stimulus-induced degradation. U937 and U9-IIIB cells were treated with cycloheximide alone or with different inducers for 0, 2, 6, or 8 h. The 43-kDa isoform of IκBβ exhibited faster constitutive turnover in HIV-1-infected U9-IIIB cells (compare Fig. 6,A and C to B and D,lanes 1–4) and also degraded more quickly following IL-1β (compare Fig. 6, A and C to B and D, lanes 9–12) or PMA (compare Fig. 6,A and D, lanes 5–8) stimulation. TNFα stimulation led to rapid degradation of 43-kDa IκBβ in both infected and uninfected cells (Fig. 6, B and C,lanes 5–8). The faster migrating 41-kDa form was not degraded in U9-IIIB or U937 cells (Fig. 6, C and D, respectively, lower bands). Thus, the dynamic state of degradation and resynthesis of the 43-kDa form of IκBβ may result in the continuous production of hypophosphorylated IκBβ, the form previously shown to shield DNA-bound NF-κB from the effects of IκBα (32Suyang H. Phillips R. Douglas I. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40McKinsey T.A. Chu Z.L. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22377-22380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because IκBα (12DeLuca C. Roulston A. Koromilas A. Wainberg M.A. Hiscott J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5183-5193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and IκBβ turnover are increased in HIV-1-infected cells and the constitutive NF-κB·DNA binding in HIV-1-infected myeloid cells disappears when oxidant signaling pathways are interrupted (15DeLuca C. Kwon H.J. Pelletier N. Wainberg M.A. Hiscott J. Virology. 1998; 244: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether the IκB kinase was constitutively active in HIV-1-infected cells. When an antibody that recognizes the phosphoserine 32 of IκBα was used, HIV-1-infected U9-IIIB and PLB-IIIB cells, but not their uninfected counterparts, contained high levels of phosphorylated IκBα in the presence or absence of inducer (Fig. 7A, top panel, lanes 4–6 and 10–12). Stimulation of uninfected cells with TNFα or PMA for 10 min resulted in the appearance of phosphorylated IκBα in U937 (Fig. 7A, top panel, lanes 2 and 3) and PLB-985 (Fig. 7A, lanes 8 and 9) cells. This blot was reprobed with monoclonal IκBα antibody (middle panel) to confirm IκBα turnover. As expected, TNFα stimulation led to degradation of IκBα in all cell lines (Fig. 7A, middle panel, lanes 2, 5, 8, and 11). IκBα levels in PMA-stimulated cells were not reduced (Fig. 7A, middle panel, lanes 3,6, 9, and 12), although phosphorylated IκBα was detected, reflecting the longer kinetics of PMA induced IκBα degradation. As described previously, an IκBα immunoreactive band of approximately 30 kDa in size was also detected in PLB-985 cells (12DeLuca C. Roulston A. Koromilas A. Wainberg M.A. Hiscott J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5183-5193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 30-kDa IκBα was also recognized by the phosphoserine-specific IκBα antibody (Fig. 7A, top panel, lower arrow) and degraded similarly to IκBα (Fig. 7A, middle panel), suggesting tha"
https://openalex.org/W2139198235,"Desensitization is a ubiquitous response of guanine nucleotide-binding protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) characterized by the waning of effector activity despite continued presence of agonist. Binding of an arrestin to the activated, often phosphorylated GPCR triggers desensitization. We reported for the luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor (LH/CG R) that β-arrestin tightly bound to porcine ovarian follicular membranes mediates agonist-dependent desensitization of LH/CG R-stimulated adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity (Mukherjee, S., Palczewski, K., Gurevich, V. V., Benovic, J. L., Banga, J. P., and Hunzicker-Dunn, M. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.96, 493–498). We now show that addition of a synthetic peptide corresponding to the entire third intracellular loop (3i) of the LH/CG R completely and specifically reverses desensitization of AC activity, with an ED50 of 10 μm but does not modulate basal, hCG-stimulated, or forskolin-stimulated AC activities. β-Arrestin binds selectively to the 3i peptide coupled to activated Sepharose. Desensitization of LH/CG R-stimulated AC activity is rescued when the 3i peptide is preincubated with exogenous β-arrestin. These results show that endogenous β-arrestin participates in cell-free desensitization of agonist-dependent LH/CG R-stimulated AC activity in follicular membranes by interacting directly with the 3i loop of the receptor, thereby preventing Gs activation. Desensitization is a ubiquitous response of guanine nucleotide-binding protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) characterized by the waning of effector activity despite continued presence of agonist. Binding of an arrestin to the activated, often phosphorylated GPCR triggers desensitization. We reported for the luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor (LH/CG R) that β-arrestin tightly bound to porcine ovarian follicular membranes mediates agonist-dependent desensitization of LH/CG R-stimulated adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity (Mukherjee, S., Palczewski, K., Gurevich, V. V., Benovic, J. L., Banga, J. P., and Hunzicker-Dunn, M. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.96, 493–498). We now show that addition of a synthetic peptide corresponding to the entire third intracellular loop (3i) of the LH/CG R completely and specifically reverses desensitization of AC activity, with an ED50 of 10 μm but does not modulate basal, hCG-stimulated, or forskolin-stimulated AC activities. β-Arrestin binds selectively to the 3i peptide coupled to activated Sepharose. Desensitization of LH/CG R-stimulated AC activity is rescued when the 3i peptide is preincubated with exogenous β-arrestin. These results show that endogenous β-arrestin participates in cell-free desensitization of agonist-dependent LH/CG R-stimulated AC activity in follicular membranes by interacting directly with the 3i loop of the receptor, thereby preventing Gs activation.

A hyperdesensitized state characterized by ∼80% desensitization can be achieved by preincubating follicular membranes in the presence of 8% ethanol (31Ekstrom R.C. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 2578-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This hyperdesensitized state of the LH/CG R retains dependence on GTP and agonist for development as well as its ability to be reversed by GDPβS, and like LH/CG R desensitization in the absence of ethanol is unaffected by addition of exogenous Gβγ or by sequestration of endogenous Gβγ (32Lamm M.L.G.

Disruption of β-arrestin binding to the LH/CG R with monoclonal arrestin antibodies that recognize common epitopes on all arrestins specifically blocks agonist-dependent LH/CG R desensitization, and this effect is reversed by a synthetic peptide corresponding to the antibody-binding site on β-arrestin (34Mukherjee S. Palczewski K. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Banga J.P. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Moreover, addition of purified recombinant β-arrestin to follicular membranes mimics desensitization by reducing agonist-dependent AC activity to nearly basal levels, with an ED50 value of 0.1 nm (34Mukherjee S. Palczewski K. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Banga J.P. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The sites on the ligand-activated, phosphorylated GPCRs with which arrestins interact have been investigated using purified light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin and synthetic peptides to cytoplasmic domains of rhodopsin (35Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V. Schepers T. Hamm H.E. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3226-3232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Results showed that arrestin bound with highest affinity to the third intracellular (3i) loop as well as to portions of the second intracellular (2i) loop and the C-terminal tail of rhodopsin. Consistent with this result, arrestins were shown to bind with high affinity to recombinant 3i subdomains of the m2- and m3-muscarinic and α2A/D-adrenergic receptors fused to glutathioneS-transferase (36Wu G. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17836-17842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Based on our evidence that endogenous β-arrestin participates in desensitization of the LH/CG R, in this report we sought to determine whether the putative 3i loop of the LH/CG R could compete with LH/CG R for endogenous β-arrestin and reverse agonist-dependent LH/CG R desensitization. Visual arrestin was purified from bovine retinas (37Palczewski K. Hargrave P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4201-4206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); recombinant β-arrestin was expressed and purified (38Gurevich V.V. Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. Onorato J.J. J.

CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; remaining sources are as described previously (34Mukherjee S. Palczewski K. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Banga J.P. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A partially purified membrane fraction enriched in AC activity was isolated from porcine ovarian follicles (34Mukherjee S. Palczewski K. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Banga J.P. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Proc.

Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using BSA as standard. For the two-stage desensitization reaction, reagents (in 20 μl) for stage 1 desensitization reaction (BSA or hCG at 10 μg/ml in 8% ethanol, 25 mm 1, 3 bis-[tris(hydroxymethyl)-methylamino]propane, pH 7.2, 10 μm GTP, 0.4 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 0.2 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 20 mmphosphocreatine, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmATP (or if indicated AMP-PNP), and 1 mm[3H]cAMP (∼20,000 cpm)) were added to follicular membranes (∼30 μg in 20 μl, preincubated with water or indicated synthetic peptide), and incubation was for 40 min at 30 °C. An assay for AC activity (stage 2) was immediately performed at 30 °C for 5 min with addition of a 10-μl volume containing 100 μmGTP, [α-32P]ATP (∼5 μCi, 100–200 cpm/pmol), and 10 μg/ml BSA or hCG. When only the AC assay was conducted (and stage 1 was omitted), complete reaction mix was added to membranes (in a 30-μl volume, such that final incubation volume was 50 μl). Reaction was stopped (23Ekstrom R.C. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 956-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and [32P]cAMP was purified and quantified (24Bockaert J.

Final concentrations of reagents in a 50-μl reaction volume are indicated throughout. 50 mg of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B was swollen in 1 mm HCl, coupled overnight (4 °C) to 0.1 mg/ml indicated synthetic LH/CG peptide in 0.1 m NaHC03 (pH 8.3) containing 0.5m NaCl, then washed to remove unbound peptide, incubated 2 h in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), washed with 0.1m acetate buffer (pH 4.0) containing 0.5 mNaCl, washed with 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.5m NaCl, equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl (buffer A), and incubated with 0.2 ml of 0.2 mg/ml recombinant β-arrestin 1 h at room temperature. Sepharose was then washed with buffer A; proteins were eluted with 0.25 ml of 3× SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to Hybond for Western blot analysis using arrestin antibody (Transduction Laboratory) (34Mukherjee S.

Results (means ± S.E.) were analyzed using Student's t test (p < 0.05) (41Bender F.E. Douglass L.W. Kramer A. Statistical Methods for Food and Agriculture. AVI Publishing Co., Inc., Westport, CT1982Google Scholar). Experiments were conducted to determine whether synthetic peptides (Fig. 1) corresponding to the entire 2i and 3i cytoplasmic loops or the N-terminal portion of the cytoplasmic tail (4i) of the porcine LH/CG R (1Loosfelt H. Misrahi M. Atger M. Salesse R. Vuhai-Luuthi M.T. Jolivet A. Guiochon-Mantel A. Sar S. Jallal B. Garnier J. Milgrom E. Science. 1989; 245: 525-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) could competitively disrupt agonist-dependent desensitization of AC activity in porcine ovarian follicular membranes. To this end, membranes were first preincubated (30 min at 4 °C) with/without synthetic LH/CG R peptides and then subjected to the stage 1 incubation (40 min at 30 °C) under conditions which do promote (plus hCG) or do not promote (minus hCG) desensitization, followed by a 5-min AC assay. Agonist-dependent hyperdesensitization of LH/CG R-stimulated AC activity was readily demonstrated in membranes incubated with hCG, GTP, and 8% ethanol during the stage 1 desensitization incubation (Fig. 2A, compare hatchedwith solid bars). Preincubation of follicular membranes with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the LH/CG R 3i loop resulted in a concentration-dependent rise in hCG-stimulated AC activity when hCG was present in stage 1 of the desensitization reaction (Fig. 2A, compare hatched bars) and a corresponding reduction in the percentage of desensitization of hCG-stimulated AC activity (Fig. 2B). The ED50 for LH/CG R 3i peptide to increase hCG-stimulated AC activity was 10 μm. Concentrations of LH/CG R 3i greater than 20 μm were less effective and, at 114 μm, no longer reversed desensitization (Fig. 2C). In contrast to its effect on desensitization of agonist-dependent AC activity, when the desensitization (stage 1) incubation was omitted, the LH/CG R 3i peptide over the same concentration range did not affect basal or hCG-stimulated AC activities and only minimally (∼10%) reduced forskolin-stimulated AC activities (Fig. 2D). Like the entire 3i loop of the LH/CG R, a peptide (3iTM6) corresponding to the C-terminal 12 residues of 3i through the N-terminal 8 residues of transmembrane domain (TM) 6 also reversed desensitization by preventing the hCG-dependent fall in hCG-stimulated AC activity (Fig. 2E). The concentration dependence for LH/CG R 3iTM6 was very similar to that of LH/CG R 3i. The maximum effect of LH/CG R 3iTM6 was seen at 20 μm, and 3iTM6 peptide was ineffective at 114 μm (not shown). LH/CG R 3iTM6 did not significantly (p > 0.05) affect basal or hCG-stimulated AC activities in a 5-min AC assay (Fig. 2F). To determine whether the effect of the LH/CG R 3i peptide on agonist-dependent LH/CG R desensitization was specific, the effects of LH/CG R peptides corresponding to the entire 2i loop or the N terminus of 4i were tested. A synthetic peptide containing the 20 amino acids of 3i randomly scrambled was also tested. Neither LH/CG R loops 2i (Fig. 2G) nor the N terminus of 4i (Fig. 2E) nor follicle-stimulating hormone receptor 3i loop (not shown) at 15 μm affected agonist-dependent LH/CG R desensitization. Higher concentrations of LH/CG R 2i also did not modulate hCG-desensitized AC activity (Fig. 2C). A peptide corresponding to N-terminal 20 amino acids of the LH/CG R (located in the extracellular domain) also did not modulate agonist-dependent LH/CG R desensitization (Fig. 2H). Scrambled 3i peptide did not modulate agonist-dependent LH/CG R desensitization (Fig. 2I) and did not affect basal or hCG-stimulated AC activities in a 5-min AC assay (not shown). Based on our previous evidence that agonist-dependent desensitization of the LH/CG R is mediated, at least in part, by the binding of endogenous β-arrestin to the LH/CG R (34Mukherjee S. Palczewski K. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Banga J.P. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the endogenous β-arrestin is binding primarily to the 3i loop of the LH/CG R. To determine whether β-arrestin could bind directly to the 3i loop of the LH/CG R, synthetic peptides corresponding to the LH/CG R 3i or 2i loops or a peptide containing amino acids of the 3i loop randomly scrambled were coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose. The ability of recombinant β-arrestin to bind to Sepharose-coupled peptides was then evaluated. β-Arrestin bound only to authentic LH/CG R 3i synthetic peptide and not to LH/CG R 2i or a 3i scrambled peptide (Fig. 3). If the synthetic peptide corresponding to the 3i loop of the LH/CG R is blocking agonist-dependent LH/CG R desensitization by binding to the endogenous membrane-associated β-arrestin, then saturation of the LH/CG R 3i synthetic peptide with an exogenous arrestin should free endogenous β-arrestin and thereby revive agonist-dependent LH/CG R desensitization. Results in Fig. 4A show that when the 3i LH/CG R peptide (at 7.5 μm) was incubated with 0.2 μm visual arrestin (4C, 30 min) and then membranes were added and preincubation was continued for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by the two-stage desensitization reaction, agonist-dependent desensitization of LH/CG R was rescued to levels seen in the water control (Fig. 4A, comparehatched bars). Equivalent results were obtained when 3i LH/CG R peptide was incubated with 40 nm β-arrestin (Fig. 4B). In agreement with previous results (34Mukherjee S. Palczewski K. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Banga J.P. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), addition of unopposed β-arrestin reduced full hCG-stimulated AC activity (Fig. 4B, solid bars) to levels seen with hCG in stage 1 (Fig. 4B, hatched bars). These results comprise the first report, to our knowledge, of the ability of a synthetic peptide corresponding to the 3i loop of a GPCR to reverse completely agonist-dependent desensitization of effector AC activity. This result was anticipated, based on evidence that arrestin binds primarily to the 3i loop of phosphorylated, light-activated rhodopsin (35Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V. Schepers T. Hamm H.E.

However, in contrast to these receptors, β-arrestin binding to the porcine follicular membrane LH/CG R and consequent desensitization of agonist-dependent LH/CG R-stimulated AC activity appear to be independent of LH/CG R phosphorylation, based on the occurrence of desensitization and ethanol-induced hyperdesensitization in the presence of the ATP phosphorylation antagonist AMP-PNP (23Ekstrom R.C.

Recombinant β-arrestin binds directly to a synthetic peptide corresponding to the 3i loop of the LH/CG R and not to peptides corresponding to the 2i loop or scrambled 3i. Moreover, reversal of agonist-dependent LH/CG R desensitization is specific for the 3i loop of the LH/CG R. These results suggest that membrane-bound follicular β-arrestin binds predominately to the 3i loop of the LH/CG R to functionally uncouple the activated LH/CG R from Gs, perhaps by displacing Gs. Although it is well established for a number of GPCRs that the 3i loop comprises the primary binding site for Gs (48O'Dowd B.F. Hnatowich M. Regan J.W. Leader W.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Synthetic peptides corresponding to the lower portion of TM6 and to C-terminally extended TM6 peptides containing point mutations that promote constitutive LH/CG R activation (5Kosugi S. Mori T.

In summary, our results show that endogenous β-arrestin binding to the C-terminal portion of the 3i loop of the LH/CG R promotes desensitization of LH/CG R-stimulated AC activity by blocking receptor activation of Gs in a physiological membrane model. A synthetic peptide corresponding to the 3i loop of the LH/CG R prevented development of desensitization of AC activity apparently by displacing β-arrestin from the receptor but did not uncouple receptor-stimulated activation of Gs. These results suggest that a synthetic peptide corresponding to the putative 3i loop of the LH/CG R may be used to enhance signaling of LH/CG R by preventing desensitization, whereas β-arrestin replacement has the potential to decrease signaling of overactive LH/CG Rs. Synthetic peptides to other GPCRs that interfere with arrestin binding are therefore predicted to block desensitization of effector activities as well as other receptor responses to arrestins, including receptor sequestration and possibly down-regulation.

Mutation ofSAC1, a gene of unknown function, restores secretory flow in sec14-1 ts strains. The existing model for the bypass of the sec14-1 ts defect bysac1-22 involves stimulation of sphingolipid biosynthesis and, in particular, the synthesis of mannosyl-diinositolphosphoryl-ceramide with concomitant increases in Golgi diacylglycerol levels.

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an important model system for determining the molecular mechanisms of eukaryotic intracellular protein transport. Of particular interest is the yeast secretory pathway in which SEC genes essential for protein secretion by S. cerevisiae have been identified (1Novick P. Field C. Schekman R. Cell. 1980; 21: 205-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). These genes were discovered as conditional lethal mutations that interrupt secretory flow at specific points along the secretory pathway. Biochemical and functional identification of the SEC gene products has increased the understanding of mechanisms involved in the yeast secretory pathway. The yeast SEC14 gene is required for the formation of transport vesicles from the Golgi (2Bankaitis V.A. Malehorn D.E. Emr S.D. Greene R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which its encoded protein, Sec14p, facilitates this process is not precisely known. When conditional lethal mutant sec14-1 tsstrains are shifted to nonpermissive temperatures, protein secretion halts (1Novick P. Field C. Schekman R. Cell. 1980; 21: 205-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Sec14p is a phosphatidylinositol transfer protein with the ability to transfer both phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine between membranes (2Bankaitis V.A. Malehorn D.E. Emr S.D. Greene R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). A unique protein in S. cerevisiae, Sec14p, is set apart from other phospholipid transfer proteins by its ability to interact specifically with the Golgi (3Cleves A.E. McGee T.P. Whitters E.A. Champion K.M. Aitken J.R. Dowhan W. Goebl M. Bankaitis V.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 789-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), an association that is required for secretory competence in yeast (4Skinner H.B. Alb Jr., J.G. Whitters E.A. Helmkamp Jr., G.M. Bankaitis V.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4775-4784Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Sec14p is proposed to have a sensor function that maintains a critical phosphatidylinositol to phosphatidylcholine ratio required for vesicle formation at the Golgi (3Cleves A.E. McGee T.P. Whitters E.A. Champion K.M. Aitken J.R. Dowhan W. Goebl M. Bankaitis V.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 789-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). To further understand the mechanism of SEC14 action in the secretory pathway, suppressor mutants ofsec14-1 ts were identified (3Cleves A.E. McGee T.P. Whitters E.A. Champion K.M. Aitken J.R. Dowhan W. Goebl M. Bankaitis V.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 789-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Characterization of the genes defective in these mutants revealed that genes of three of six gene complementation groups identified were involved in the CDP-choline pathway for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. Apparently, inhibition of phosphatidylcholine synthesis through the CDP-choline pathway leads to efficient bypass of sec14-1 ts, probably by altering phospholipid composition of the Golgi membrane. Other suppressors of sec14-1 ts are mutations of the SAC1 gene (5Cleves A.E. Novick P.J. Bankaitis V.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2939-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Originally identified as a suppressor ofact1 alleles when mutated, SAC1 encodes an integral membrane protein that is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi (6Whitters E.A. Cleves A.E. McGee T.P. Skinner H.B. Bankaitis V.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Generally, SAC1 mutations lead to a cold-sensitive phenotype and inositol auxotrophy. However, mutants with the sac1-22 allele do not display inositol auxotrophy, despite an inositol requirement for its bypass ofsec14-1 ts. Sac1p has significant homology with the noncatalytic domains of the yeast and mammalian polyphosphoinositide 5-phosphatases (7Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 427-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), but its function is not known. Phospholipase D activity was recently shown to be essential for bypass of the sec14-1 ts phenotypes in several bypass mutants, but not for normal secretion (8Xie Z. Fang M. Rivas M.P. Faulkner A.J. Sternweis P.C. Engebrecht J.A. Bankaitis V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12346-12351Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 9Sreenivas A. Patton-Vogt J.L. Bruno V. Griac P. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16635-16638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The formation of phosphatidic acid from phospholipase D-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine has been implicated in this process. This is supported by results showing that phosphatidic acid promotes Golgi vesicle formation in a mammalian cell system (10Siddhanta A. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17995-17998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Kearns et al. (11Kearns B.G. McGee T.P. Mayinger P. Gedvilaite A. Phillips S.E. Kagiwada S. Bankaitis V.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) suggested thatsec14-1ts bypass by sac1-22 occurs by increasing the amount of diacylglycerol (DAG) 1The abbreviation used is: DAG, diacylglycerol; M(IP)2C, mannosyl-diinositolphosphoryl-ceramide; MIPC, mannosyl-inositolphosphoryl-ceramide; PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; PtdIns(4)P, PtdIns 4-phosphate; PtdIns(3)P, PtdIns 3-phosphate, PtdIns (4,5)P2, PtdIns, 4,5-bisphosphate; SC, synthetic complete; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. in the Golgi through stimulated sphingolipid biosynthesis. This model was based on an apparent 6-fold increase in the cellular levels of mannosyl-diinositolphosphoryl-ceramide (M(IP)2C). M(IP)2C synthesis occurs in the Golgi with the transfer of phosphorylinositol from phosphatidylinositol to mannosyl-monoinositolphosphoryl-ceramide (MIPC) to yield a molar equivalent of DAG (12Becker G.W. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 747-754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sac1-22 bypass was perturbed by heterologous expression of Escherichia coli DAG kinase, presumably due to the conversion of DAG to phosphatidic acid. The recent identification of IPT1 as M(IP)2C synthase (13Dickson R.C. Nagiec E.E. Wells G.B. Nagiec M.M. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29620-29625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) allowed us to test the role of M(IP)2C production in the bypass of sec14-1 ts bysac1-22.IPT1 was also recently found to be identical to SYR4, a gene necessary for yeast growth inhibition by the bacterial metabolite syringomycin E. 2S. D. Stock, D. A. Young, J. A. Radding, and J. Y. Takemoto, manuscript in preparation. In this work, we report that disruption of IPT1 has no effect on the bypass, indicating that M(IP)2C production is not important in thesac1-22 suppression of sec14-1 ts. Instead, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P) is shown to increase in the sec14-1 ts sac1-22bypass mutants, suggesting a role for this lipid in Golgi-localized secretory pathway events. S. cerevisiae strains used in this work were CTY182 (MATaura3-52Δhis3-200 lys2-801) (2Bankaitis V.A. Malehorn D.E. Emr S.D. Greene R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), CTY1-1A (MATaura3-52 Δhis3-200 lys2-801 sec 14-1 ts) (2Bankaitis V.A. Malehorn D.E. Emr S.D. Greene R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), CTY165 (MATaura3-52 Δhis3-200 ade2-101 sec14-1 ts sac1-22) (11Kearns B.G. McGee T.P. Mayinger P. Gedvilaite A. Phillips S.E. Kagiwada S. Bankaitis V.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), and CTY-SR (CTY165 Δipt1::URA3, this work). Cells were typically grown in synthetic complete (SC) media as described by Kaiser et al. (15Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). For lipid analyses, cells were grown in synthetic minimal medium (16Sherman F. Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. 194. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991: 3-21Google Scholar). The IPT1 disruptant strain CTY-SR was constructed by the one-step disruption method (17Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar). The IPT1 disruption construct described elsewhere2 was made by replacing a 1-kilobasePvuII-PvuII fragment, which included the 5′ portion of IPT1, with a 1.1-kilobase URA3fragment. This construct was linearized and used to transform CTY165. Disruptants were selected on SC-ura, and IPT1 disruption was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Ten-ml cultures grown in SC medium at 28 °C were harvested at an optical density between 0.5 and 1 at 600 nm, washed once in SC low-glucose medium (1 mmglucose), resuspended into 10 ml of low-glucose medium, and split into two 5-ml cultures. Low-glucose cultures were incubated at either 28 °C or 37 °C for 1 h. Secretory indices were determined by assaying the total and secreted invertase activity as described by Westphal et al. (18Westphal V. Marcusson E.G. Winther J.R. Emr S.D. van den Hazel H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11865-11870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Sphingolipid extractions were modified from the methods described by Smith and Lester (19Smith S. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3395-3405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Steady-state measurements of sphingolipid levels were conducted by growing 20-ml cultures for 18–24 h at 28 °C in the presence of 200 μCi of H332PO4. Growth was terminated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 5%. Cells were washed twice with 1 ml of H2O and freeze-dried overnight. Dried cells were resuspended in 1 ml of H2O and extracted by the addition of 1.4 ml of ethanol:diethyl ether:pyridine (15:5:1) for 30 min at 57 °C. Debris was pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was removed to a fresh tube. After drying under N2, lipids were resuspended in 1 ml of solvent A (chloroform:methanol:water (16:16:5 v/v/v)), and glycerophospholipids were deacylated by the addition of 1 ml of 0.2 n NaOH in methanol and incubation at 30 °C for 45 min. One ml of 5% EDTA was added, and samples were neutralized by the addition of 0.2 ml of 1 n acetic acid. Lipids were then extracted with 1 ml of chloroform and dried under N2. Lipids were resuspended in 0.1 ml of solvent A and analyzed by thin layer chromatography on 1-mm Silica Gel G plates (Analtech, Newark, DE) treated with 2.5% EDTA (pH 7.2) and developed in chloroform:methanol:4.2 n ammonium hydroxide (9:7:2 v/v/v). Radiolabeled lipids were identified by autoradiography and quantified by scraping relevant spots followed by liquid scintillation counting. The identities of inositolphosphoryl-ceramide, MIPC, and M(IP)2C were confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (Utah State University Biotechnology Center). Steady-state and pulse analyses of DAG levels were measured by labeling cells with [14C]acetate (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA). Steady-state labeling was conducted by adding 5 μCi of [14C]acetate to 20-ml cultures and growing the cells for 18–24 h at 28 °C. Pulse labeling was done by adding 40 μCi of [14C]acetate to 20-ml cultures, with an optical density at 600 nm between 0.7 and 0.8, for 20 min at 28 °C. DAG extraction was done as described by Buttke and Pyle (20Buttke T.M. Pyle A.L. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 152: 747-756PubMed Google Scholar). The total lipid fractions from 14C pulse-labeled and steady-state-labeled cells were extracted with 2 ml of methanol under reflux for 1 h, followed by the addition of 4 ml of chloroform and incubation at room temperature for 18 h. Phases were separated by the addition of 1.2 ml of 0.1 m potassium chloride. The chloroform phase was removed to a fresh tube and dried under N2. Labeled lipids were suspended in 100 μl of chloroform and separated by thin layer chromatography with the solvent petroleum ether:diethyl ether:acetic acid (85:15:1 v/v/v).14C-labeled lipids were detected by autoradiography, scraped, and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Nonlabeled DAG and other lipid standards were detected by charring after spraying with 50% sulfuric acid. Cells were grown at 26 °C for 18 h in synthetic defined minimal media supplemented with 1 mm myo-inositol in the presence of 40 μCi/ml H332PO4 (ICN Pharmaceuticals) as performed in the work of Kearns et al. (11Kearns B.G. McGee T.P. Mayinger P. Gedvilaite A. Phillips S.E. Kagiwada S. Bankaitis V.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Total lipids were extracted from 20 A 590 units of each cell culture as described for sphingolipid analysis without deacylation. Dried lipids were suspended in 400 μl of solvent A and separated by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography as described above and visualized by autoradiography. The relevant lipid spot was scraped from plates and extracted three times with 500 μl of solvent A, dried under N2, and processed for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis as described below. Yeast cells were grown at 26 °C in synthetic minimal media supplemented with 100 μm myo-inositol and 5 μCi/mlmyo-[3H]inositol (23 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA) to a mid-log phase. Lipids were extracted as described under “Quantification of Sphingolipids.” Deacylation was carried out by the method of Serunian et al. (21Serunian L.A. Auger K.R. Cantley L.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Dried glycerophosphoinositols were subjected to anion exchange chromatography using a Whatman Partisil 5 SAX column (25 cm × 4.6 mm; Whatman Inc., Clifton, NJ) on a Beckman System Gold HPLC system. The column was pre-equilibrated with 10 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 3.8. A portion of each sample (2.5 × 106 cpm) was applied to the column, washed with 5 ml of 10 mm ammonium phosphate (pH 3.8), and eluted with a 40-ml linear gradient from 10 mm to 0.7 m ammonium phosphate (pH 3.8) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. [32P]Glycerophosphoinositol 3-phosphate and [32P]glycerophosphoinositol 4-phosphate standards were generated by in vitro phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol with α-[32P]ATP followed by deacylation. For the production of PtdIns(3)P, an extract enriched in PtdIns 3-kinase was prepared from a 25–30% ammonium sulfate precipitate of a yeast cytosolic fraction of strain TVY614 (22Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar) carrying a multicopy plasmid of the VPS15 gene (pJSY324.15) (23Stack J.H. Herman P.K. Schu P.V. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2195-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and the VPS34 gene (pPHY52) (24Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6742-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The PtdIns 4-kinase source was a crude cell extract from a yeast strain (PHY102) that lacks the VPS34 gene (24Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6742-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The glycerophosphoinositol 3,5-bisphosphate peak was identified as a species that increased 16-fold by osmotic stress (1 m NaCl for 20 min; data not shown) (25Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Douglas M.R. Sayers L.G. Parker P.J. Michell R.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). [3H]Glycerophosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate was generated by deacylation of [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2 (NEN Life Science Products). The proposed involvement of M(IP)2C synthesis in the sac1-22 bypass ofsec14-1 ts prompted us to disruptIPT1, the structural gene for M(IP)2C synthase, in strain CTY165 (sec14-1 ts sac1-22). If increased M(IP)2C synthesis in this strain promotes bypass, then disruption of IPT1 should alleviate the bypass. A disruption strain was obtained by transforming CTY165 with a linearized ipt1::URA3 construct. After transformation, disruptants were selected on SC-ura plates. Three Ura+ transformants were randomly selected and found to be resistant to syringomycin E (1.0 μg/ml), which is characteristic of mutants that lack M(IP)2C.2 Disruption was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. One strain, CTY-SR, was selected and used for the remaining studies. To examine the effect ofIPT1 disruption, strains CTY182 (wild type), CTY1-1A (sec14-1 ts), CTY165 (sec14-1 ts sac1-22), and CTY-SR (sec14-1 ts sac1-22Δipt1) were streaked onto minimal medium plates with or without myo-inositol (0.1 mm) and incubated at permissive (28 °C) and nonpermissive (37 °C) temperatures (Fig. 1). All strains grew with and without inositol at 28 °C. CTY1-1A (sec14-1 ts) did not grow in either case at 37 °C, as expected, whereas CTY182 (wild type) CTY165 (sec14-1ts sac1-22), and CTY-SR (sec14-1ts sac1-22Δipt1) grew at 37 °C with inositol, but only CTY182 was able to grow at 37 °C on medium lacking inositol. These phenotypes are characteristic of the myo-inositol requirement forsac1-22 bypass of sec14-1 ts and demonstrate that disruption of IPT1 does not abolish the bypass. Secretory indices were determined for each strain by assaying whole cell and secreted invertase activities at 28 °C and 37 °C (Fig. 2). All strains showed similar levels of invertase secretion at 28 °C. At 37 °C, strains CTY182 (wild type) and CTY165 (sec14-1 ts sac1-22) had similar secretory indices, secretion was impeded in strain CTY1-1A (sec14-1 ts), and strain CTY-SR (sec14-1 ts sac1-22Δipt1) showed a slightly enhanced secretory index. The results confirm the growth phenotypes of these strains, showing thatIPT1-encoded M(IP)2C synthesis is not involved in the sac1-22 bypass of thesec14-1 ts secretory defect. The above observation thatIPT1 disruption did not influence sac1-22suppression of sec14-1 ts prompted a re-examination of the sphingolipid levels in the relevant strains. Strains CTY182 (wild type), CTY1-1A (sec14-1 ts), CTY165 (sec14-1 ts sac1-22), and CTY-SR (sec14-1 ts sac1-22Δipt1) were steady-state labeled with H332PO4 to quantify sphingolipids. Quantification of M(IP)2C levels in strains CTY182 (wild type), CTY1-1A (sec14-1 ts), and CTY165 (sec14-1 ts sac1-22) revealed similar degrees of 32P incorporation into M(IP)2C (in cpm per mg dry weight of cells: 836 ± 356 (n = 3), 1080 ± 516 (n = 3), and 853 ± 341 (n = 3), respectively), and, as expected, CTY-SR (sec14-1 ts sac1-22Δipt1) did not produce M(IP)2C (Fig. 3). Differences were observed in the relative MIPC levels. CTY1-1A (sec14-1 ts) had higher cellular levels of MIPC (29% of total sphingolipids) compared with the isogenic wild type strain CTY182 (15% of total sphingolipids) and the sac1-22 bypass strain CTY165 (7.5% of total sphingolipids) (Fig. 3). These results show that the sac1-22bypass of sec14-1 ts does not involve increased M(IP)2C production. The above finding that M(IP)2C levels are unchanged in the CTY165 (sec14-1 ts sac1-22) bypass strain prompted us to revisit the effects of thesac1-22 mutation on the cellular levels of inositol-containing lipids. Strains CTY1-1A (sec14-1 ts) and CTY165 (sec14-1 ts sac1-22) were grown at permissive temperature in the presence of [32P]phosphate, and the total lipids were extracted and analyzed by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography (Fig. 4). A preferential increase in the level of a phosphate-containing lipid that resembled a diphosphoinositide (26Talwalkar R.T. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 306: 412-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) was observed in extracts of strain CTY165 (sec14-1 ts sac1-22). To identify this lipid, it was isolated from the silica matrix of the thin layer chromatographic plates, extracted, deacylated, and subjected to anionic exchange HPLC analyses (21Serunian L.A. Auger K.R. Cantley L.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). Comparisons to authentic glycerophosphoinositol standards indicated that the lipid was PtdIns(4)P. To confirm this identification, lipid extracts were prepared from cultures of strains grown in the presence ofmyo-[3H]inositol and deacylated, and the glycerophosphoinositols were identified by anionic exchange HPLC analyses (Fig. 5). A HPLC peak that co-eluted with glycerophosphoinositol derived from PtdIns(4)P was 8-fold more abundant in the CTY165 (sec14-1 ts sac1-22) samples as compared with the CTY1-1A (sec14-1 ts) samples. The only other significant difference detected between the two strains was a 60% reduction in the glycerophosphoinositol derived from PtdIns(4,5)P2 in strain CTY165.Figure 5Phosphoinositide levels of strains CTY1-1A and CTY165. Ten-ml cultures of strains CTY1-1A (○) and CTY165 (x) were labeled with 5 μCi/ml [3H]inositol at 26 °C overnight. Lipids were extracted and deacylated, and extracts containing 2.5 × 106 cpm were subjected to anion exchange chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lipid extracts from 10-ml cultures of strains CTY1-1A and CTY165 contained 4 × 106 and 5.6 × 106 cpm, respectively. Fractions (0.3 ml each) were collected from 15 to 45 ml. Counts of fractions 61–80 are shown in a different scale in the inset. gPI(3)P, glycerophosphoinositol 3-phosphate; gPI(4)P, glycerophosphoinositol 4-phosphate; gPI(3,5)P2, glycerophosphoinositol 3,5-bisphosphate;gPI(4,5)P2, glycerophosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. The chromatograms of deacylated lipids from CTY182 were indistinguishable from CTY1-1A (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the current model for sac1-22suppression of sec14-1 ts, bulk DAG levels are hypothesized to increase as a result of elevated M(IP)2C synthesis (11Kearns B.G. McGee T.P. Mayinger P. Gedvilaite A. Phillips S.E. Kagiwada S. Bankaitis V.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, the results presented above show that M(IP)2C levels do not increase with sac1-22suppression. To reconcile this discrepancy, the effects ofIPT1 disruption and sac1-22 suppression ofsec14-1 ts on DAG production were determined. Cultures of strains CTY182 (wild type), CTY1-1A (sec14-1 ts), CTY165 (sec14-1 ts sac1-22), and CTY-SR (sec14-1 ts sac1-22Δipt1) were incubated with [14C]acetate continually (steady-state labeling) or for a 20-min interval (pulse labeling) before harvesting the cells. Total lipid extracts were separated by thin layer chromatography, and DAG was identified by comparison to an authentic standard. With steady-state labeling, no significant differences in DAG levels were observed between the four strains (data not shown). With pulse labeling, strains CTY182 (wild type), CTY1-1A (sec14-1 ts), and CTY165 (sec14-1 ts sac1-22) showed similar rates of net DAG production, but CTY-SR (sec14-1 ts sac1-22Δipt1) produced approximately one-third less DAG (Fig. 6). The main conclusion of our work is that M(IP)2C synthesis, which is coupled to DAG production, is not involved in the bypass of sec14-1 ts by sac1-22. This was determined by assessing the consequences of disruptingIPT1, the gene that encodes the M(IP)2C synthase, and also by examining the cellular levels of M(IP)2C and DAG as a function of the bypass. These conclusions differ from those of Kearns et al. (11Kearns B.G. McGee T.P. Mayinger P. Gedvilaite A. Phillips S.E. Kagiwada S. Bankaitis V.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), who previously reported increases in both M(IP)2C and DAG in the sec14-1 ts sac1-22 bypass mutant. It is clear that in the previous report, M(IP)2C was misidentified. A re-evaluation in the present work of alterations in lipid composition caused by the sac1-22 bypass mutation revealed that the amount of a single phosphoinositol-containing lipid species, PtdIns(4)P, was preferentially elevated rather than M(IP)2C. Our analyses, however, did reveal an increase in the relative level of MIPC in CTY1-1A (sec14-1 ts) at permissive temperature (Fig. 3). This could be due to product inhibition of Ipt1p by accumulated M(IP)2C in the Golgi compartment caused by a defect in the secretory pathway that is nonetheless partially functional at permissive temperature. Alleviation of this defect bysac1-22 would account for the lowered MIPC levels observed in strain CTY165 (sec14-1 ts sac1-22). However, why the MIPC levels of strain CTY165 were lower than those of strain CTY182 (wild type) (Fig. 3) remains unexplained. It is premature to assign a specific role to PtdIns(4)P in theSEC14-dependent protein secretory pathway. The observed increased amounts of this lipid (Figs. 4 and 5) are only correlated with the sec14-1 ts sac1-22bypass. Nevertheless, the potential importance of PtdIns(4)P in the bypass is consistent with several observations that link phosphatidylinositol transfer protein function and phosphoinositide production. For example, it has been demonstrated that mammalian phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins are co-factors for phosphoinositide production by PtdIns kinases that participate in signaling and membrane traffic (27Wirtz K.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In assays for certain signaling or trafficking processes, Sec14p can substitute for mammalian phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (28Jones S.M. Alb Jr., J.G. Phillips S.E. Bankaitis V.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 2477-2485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). It is worth noting that Sac1p has significant similarity to a noncatalytic domain of mammalian polyphosphoinositide 5-phosphatases (7Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 427-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and Sac1p may conceivably be a novel phosphatase that regulates PtdIns(4)P levels. If so, Sac1p inactivation would lead to elevated levels of PtdIns(4)P, which, in turn, may compensate for insufficient PtdIns(4)P production due to a defective Sec14p. In numerous studies of phosphoinositide roles in membrane traffic, PtdIns(4)P is typically regarded as a precursor to PtdIns(4,5)P2 (32Martin T.F.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). However, the present finding that PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels are lowered in thesec14-1 ts sac1-22 bypass emphasizes the potential importance of PtdIns(4)P, rather than PtdIns(4,5)P2, in SEC14-dependent secretion. In support of the significance of PtdIns(4)P in trafficking, Matsuoka et al. (14Matsuoka K. Orci L. Amherdt M. Bednarek S.Y. Hamamoto S. Schekman R. Yeung T. Cell. 1998; 93: 263-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) reported that either PtdIns(4)P or PtdIns(4,5)P2 promoted the binding of coat proteins to liposomes in an in vitro assay for COPII-coated vesicle formation. Roles for phospholipase D and phosphatidic acid in the bypass have been suggested recently (8Xie Z. Fang M. Rivas M.P. Faulkner A.J. Sternweis P.C. Engebrecht J.A. Bankaitis V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12346-12351Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 9Sreenivas A. Patton-Vogt J.L. Bruno V. Griac P. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16635-16638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). How the presently observed increases in PtdIns(4)P relate to phospholipase D function and phosphatidic acid production in the Golgi secretory machinery is not clear. However, it is conceivable that all of these elements are coordinately regulated in yet unknown ways to allow efficient operation of theSEC14-dependent secretory pathway. We also examined the effect of IPT1 disruption on DAG production after both steady-state and pulse labeling of cells with [14C]acetate. The pulse-labeling experiments revealed that rates of DAG production were reduced by one-third in the strain CTY-SR (sec 14-1 ts sac1-22 Δipt1) compared with the CTY182 (wild type), CTY1-1A (sec14-1 ts), or CTY165 (sec14-1 ts sac1-22) strains. The decrease in DAG production with IPT1 disruption is plausible because elimination of M(IP)2C synthase, which is coupled to phosphorylinositol transfer from PtdIns, would eliminate a source of cellular DAG. Steady-state and pulse labeling of DAG did not reveal an increase in DAG levels in strain CTY165 as reported previously (11Kearns B.G. McGee T.P. Mayinger P. Gedvilaite A. Phillips S.E. Kagiwada S. Bankaitis V.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This discrepancy between the previous work of Kearns et al.(11Kearns B.G. McGee T.P. Mayinger P. Gedvilaite A. Phillips S.E. Kagiwada S. Bankaitis V.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and the present work remains unresolved. However, the present findings are consistent with results reported by Sreenivas et al. (9Sreenivas A. Patton-Vogt J.L. Bruno V. Griac P. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16635-16638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), who found no difference in the DAG levels of other bypass mutants of sec14-1 ts. Furthermore, becauseIPT1 disruption leads to lower DAG production levels despite the retention of the sec14-1 ts bypass phenotype, our results suggest that an increase in DAG levels is not essential for suppression by sac1-22. Taken together, the present findings raise concerns about certain features of the proposed mechanisms of sac1-22-mediated bypass of sec14-1 ts (11Kearns B.G. McGee T.P. Mayinger P. Gedvilaite A. Phillips S.E. Kagiwada S. Bankaitis V.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). DAG production through sphingolipid metabolism and M(IP)2C biosynthesis does not appear to play a role in the bypass. Instead, another lipid, PtdIns(4)P, is revealed to be of potential importance toSEC14-dependent secretion. However, insight into the mechanisms of the role of PtdIns(4)P in the secretion pathway will require further investigation. We thank Shinya Sonobe for technical help and V. A. Bankaitis for supplying strains CTY182, CTY1-1A, and CTY165 and for discussions."

Recent genetic studies have identified two HNF-1β mutations, R177X and A263fsinsGG, in subjects with a monogenic form of type 2 diabetes. Despite the defects being in the same gene, diverse severities of disease are observed in the affected subjects. To investigate the molecular mechanism by which mutations might cause various phenotypic features, wild type and mutant proteins were transiently expressed in insulin-producing (MIN6) and hepatic (HepG2) cells. Luciferase reporter assay showed that both mutations resulted in a marked reduction of transactivation activity. Because their dimerization activity was found to be intact by the yeast two-hybrid system, it was possible that they were dominant-negative to wild type activity. When co-expressed with wild type, both of the mutants significantly decreased wild type activity in HepG2 cells. In contrast, although A263fsinsGG functioned similarly in MIN6 cells, R177X failed to affect wild type activity in this cell line. Immunohistochemical analysis of the mutants suggests that this functional divergence might be generated by the modification of nuclear localization. These results suggest that HNF-1β mutations may impair pancreatic β-cell function by loss-of-function and dominant-negative mechanisms.

Noninsulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus is a genetic disorder characterized by elevated plasma glucose levels due to an absolute or relative deficiency of insulin. Recent progress in modern genetics research makes precise localization of disease genes within the genome possible, and this is especially relevant in the study of monogenic diseases. Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) 1The abbreviation used is: MODY, maturity onset diabetes of the young; GLUT2, glucose transporter type 2; HNF, hepatocyte nuclear factor; HA, hemagglutinin; DOTAP, N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate. is a monogenic form of type 2 diabetes characterized by onset usually under 25 years of age and autosomal dominant inheritance (1Fajans S.S.

In this context, the HNF-1β gene was also screened for mutations in subjects with early onset type 2 diabetes/MODY, and two mutations of R177X and A263fsinsGG were found in two Japanese families (12Horikawa Y. Iwasaki N. Hara M. Furuta H. Hinokio Y. Cockburn B.N. Linder T. Yamagata K. Ogata M. Tomonaga O. Kuroki H. Kasahara T. Iwamoto Y. Bell G.I. Nat.

HNF-1β is a protein of 557 amino acids comprising three functional domains: a dimerization domain (residues 1–32), a DNA-binding domain with a POU subdomain and a homeosubdomain (residues 88–178 and 229–299, respectively), and a transactivation domain (residues 314–557) (9Mendel D.B. Hansen L.P. Graves M.K. Conley P.B. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1042-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 10Rey-Campos J. Chouard T. Yaniv M.

The A263fsinsGG frameshift mutation due to insertion of a GG dinucleotide also generates a truncated mutation of 264 amino acids that lacks a third helix structure at the C terminus of the homeodomain and the entire transactivation domain. Interestingly, although the same gene is mutated, differing clinical features including diverse severity and inconsistency of onset age of diabetes are observed in these families (12Horikawa Y. Iwasaki N. Hara M. Furuta H. Hinokio Y. Cockburn B.N. Linder T. Yamagata K. Ogata M. Tomonaga O. Kuroki H. Kasahara T. Iwamoto Y. Bell G.I. Nat.

Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1354-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In this study, the molecular mechanisms by which mutations in the HNF-1β gene might cause diabetes and generate the diverse phenotypic features were addressed by functional analysis of the mutant proteins. The mutations were generated by polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis and cloned in pSP72 (Promega, Madison, WI) to generate the pSP-R177X and pSP-A263fsinsGG and also in the expression vector pCMV-6b to generate the pCMV-R177X and pCMV-A263fsinsGG. Wild type HNF-1β was also cloned in pSP72 and pCMV6b to generate pSP-WT and pCMV-WT, respectively. For luciferase reporter assay, the promoter region (nucleotides −1296/+312) of the human gene for GLUT2 (14Takeda J. Kayano T. Fukumoto H. Bell G.I. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 773-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), a liver and pancreatic β-cell glucose transporter, was cloned in the pGL3-Basic Reporter vector (Promega) to generate the pGL3-GT2. The consensuscis-element for HNF-1α/-1β binding locates at nucleotide −1030 of the promoter region of the GLUT2 gene. For immunohistochemical analysis, the nucleotide sequence encoding the HA epitope of YPYDVPDYA was introduced in frame at the 3′ end of the sequence for R177X, A263fsinsGG, and wild type in the expression vector to generate the pCMV-R177X-HA, pCMV-A263fsinsGG-HA, and pCMV-WT-HA, respectively. For verification of dimerization activity, yeast two-hybrid analysis (15Field S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4875) Google Scholar) was performed to monitor interaction of the mutant protein with wild type. The entire coding region of the wild type and mutant proteins were fused to the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding and transcriptional activation domains in pAS2–1 and pACT2 (CLONTECH), respectively. HepG2 and MIN6 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10 and 15% fetal calf serum, respectively. Cells were transfected with the liposomal DOTAP/nucleic acid mixture including 5 μg of DOTAP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 333 ng of pGL3-GT2, 0–96 ng of pCMV-WT, pCMV-R177X, and pCMV-A263fsinsGG, and 17 ng of pRL (Renillaluciferase)-SV40. Luciferase reporter assay was performed using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Renilla luciferase activity was used to normalize transfection efficiencies among experiments. Wild type and mutant proteins were prepared by in vitro transcription and translation with pSP-WT, pSP-R177X, and pSP-A263fsinsGG using a TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For electrophoretic mobility shift assay, in vitrotranslated products of the mutant and wild type proteins were incubated in a 20-μl reaction containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 0.3 pmol of32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (10,000 cpm) of 5′-ACCTCAGTAAAGATTAACCATCA-3′. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 × TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 45 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA). The gel was then dried and exposed to x-ray film for autoradiography. Verification of two-hybrid interactions of wild type and mutant proteins was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the yeast strain YRG-2 was transformed by electroporation with the above bait and prey constructs in pAS2–1 and pACT2, respectively. The yeast competent cells used were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Cotransformation mixtures were plated on synthetic dropout medium (SD/-Trp/-Leu/-His) and incubated at 30 °C for several days to select for colonies expressing interacting hybrid proteins. If the target protein interacts with a test protein, a functional GAL4 activator is reconstituted, and the expression of theHIS3 reporter gene is activated. For qualitative blue/white screening of the His+-cotransformants, colony lift β-galactosidase filter assay was performed. MIN6 and HepG2 cells were transfected with the pCMV-R177X-HA, pCMV-A263fsinsGG-HA, and pCMV-WT-HA and grown on the slide containing appropriate medium. After 48 h of culture, cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in the primary antibody at 37 °C for 30 min. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated in the fluorescence-labeled secondary antibody at 37 °C for 30 min. Localization of fusion proteins within the cells was analyzed using fluorescence microscopy. The mouse anti-HA primary antibody and secondary antibody of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Nuclear DNA was stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. To investigate the molecular mechanism by which HNF-1β mutations cause impaired glucose tolerance, transactivation activities of R177X and A263fsinsGG were analyzed in liver cell and pancreatic β-cell lines by luciferase reporter assay using the promoter of the human gene for GLUT2, which mediates facilitative glucose transport in these tissues. Wild type HNF-1β bound to the cis-element and efficiently increased reporter gene activity directed by transcription from the GLUT2 gene promoter in HepG2 and MIN6 cells (Figs. 1 and 2A). When the region from −1056 to −1026 containing the cis-element for binding was deleted from the promoter segment, the reporter activity was significantly reduced (85 ± 4%, p < 0.001). However, the deleted reporter construct still represented a significant increase of activity mediated by wild type HNF-1β, suggesting that GLUT2 gene expression could also be indirectly regulated by other transcription factors whose expression is up-regulated by HNF-1β. When the HNF-1β mutations of R177X and A263fsinsGG were expressed, a marked reduction of transactivation activity of the mutant proteins was observed both in MIN6 and HepG2 cells.Figure 2A, transactivation activity of wild type (WT) and mutant proteins. pGL3-GT2 and each test plasmid were cotransfected into MIN6 and HepG2 cells. The relative luciferase activity (Firefly/Renilla luciferase) of each construct at 0, 6, 12, and 24 ng for MIN6 cells and at 0, 24, 48, and 96 ng for HepG2 cells was measured by four independent experiments.

To determine whether A263fsinsGG may compete with wild type to bind the target DNA sequence to diminish normal activity, the electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed, resulting in no DNA binding activity in A263fsinsGG (Fig. 1A). Because the C terminus of the helix-turn-helix motif of Drosophila homeodomain proteins has been shown to be necessary to confer the DNA binding specificity (16Treisman J. Gonczy P. Vashishtha M. Harris E. Desplan C. Cell. 1989; 59: 553-562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), the third helix structure of the DNA-binding domain of human HNF-1β, in which 21 amino acids are looped out of the turn between helix 2 and helix 3 unlike other homeodomain proteins (8Mendel D.B. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 677-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also appears to be crucial for DNA binding. Because the dimerization domain at the N terminus is retained in both mutations, the nonfunctional truncated proteins may form a heterodimer with wild type HNF-1β and so interfere with the normal function. To test this possibility, dimerization activity of the mutants was examined using the yeast two-hybrid system (15Field S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4875) Google Scholar). The bait and prey DNA constructs were introduced into the same host cells to verify mutual interaction. When either pAS2-WT (bait) or pACT2-WT (prey) for wild type was introduced into the cells with a counter vector, no reporter activity was observed, suggesting that HNF-1β alone does not have an autonomous function that activates GAL4 gene expression. When both pAS2–1-WT and pACT2-WT were introduced together, the efficient growth of transformants in the selection medium and blue color formation by β-galactosidase assay were observed, indicating that the specific HNF-1β dimerization should be readily detected by the two-hybrid system. Using this method, the dimerizing activity of A263fsinsGG and R177X was examined in relation to wild type, resulting in efficient growth of cotransformants in the selection medium and generation of β-galactosidase activity (TableI). The positive interaction of each mutation with wild type was confirmed by switching the test molecules in bait and prey constructs.Table IVerification of dimerization activity of wild type and mutant proteinsPreyBaitpAS2–1HNF-1βR177XA263fsinsGGpACT2−−−−HNF-1β−+++R177X−+±NDA263fsinsGG−+ND+Dimerization activity of the HNF-1β mutants was examined using yeast two-hybrid system. − indicates no growth of cotransformants in the selection media (SD/−Trp/−Leu/−His). + indicates the efficient growth of the cotransformants in the selection media and the generation of positive β-galactosidase activity. ± indicates the efficient growth of the cotransformants in the selection medium but extremely weak generation of β-galactosidase activity. pAS2–1 and pACT2 are bait and prey plasmid vectors, respectively.

To determine whether A263fsinsGG or R177X acts as a dominant-negative regulator, varied amounts (molar ratio, 1:1 to 1:2 in MIN6 cells and 1:0.5 to 1:2 in HepG2 cells) of the mutant constructs were expressed together with wild type, and the luciferase reporter activity driven by the GLUT2 gene promoter was measured (Fig. 2B). When equimolar amounts of DNA for the wild type and each mutant were transfected into HepG2 cells, both of the mutations significantly reduced wild type activity. With increasing amounts of mutant DNA, both of the mutations were also found to reduce normal activity, suggesting that A263fsinsGG and R177X both function as a dominant-negative regulator in hepatic cells. Interestingly, however, when the mutations were expressed in MIN6 cells, although A263fsinsGG also similarly reduced wild type activity in this cell line, R177X failed to affect wild type activity, suggesting that A263fsinsGG and R177X function differently in pancreatic β-cells. To determine whether a difference in intracellular localization of mutant proteins could affect transcription activity, localization of HA-tagged proteins within the HepG2 and MIN6 cells was examined by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3). Strong signals for A263fsinsGG and wild type were similarly observed only in the nucleus in both cells. In contrast, the distribution of R177X within the cells was found to be differently patterned and markedly modified among the cells. In MIN6 cells, 90% of the cells transfected with R177X showed strong signals only in the cytoplasm, whereas the other 6 and 4% of the cells showed relatively weak signals in both nucleus and cytoplasm or only in the nucleus, respectively; 50–100 cells in two experiments were counted to estimate the frequency of each pattern. On the other hand, 92% of the transfected HepG2 cells showed strong staining in the nucleus (nucleus only, 19%; nucleus and cytoplasm, 73%). The other 8% of the cells showed only cytoplasmic staining. Although the frequency of nuclear or cytoplasmic staining varied to some extent in two experiments, the general patterns of intracellular localization were similar. The modified localization of R177X within the cells might be due to lack of a short stretch of basic residues (residues 229–237) in the POU domain, which has been suggested as a nuclear localization signal (16Treisman J. Gonczy P. Vashishtha M. Harris E. Desplan C. Cell. 1989; 59: 553-562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar,17Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1986; 2: 367-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Liver and pancreatic β-cells play a central role in regulation of glucose homeostasis by glucose uptake and disposal and insulin secretion, respectively, in response to the levels of plasma glucose. Because expression of the genes involved in such liver- and β-cell-specific function is regulated by a tissue-specific subset of transcription factors, molecular defects of these factors could lead to the development of impaired glucose tolerance. In this study, the HNF-1β mutations of R177X and A263fsinsGG were found to have markedly reduced activity of transactivation of the human GLUT2 gene in liver or pancreatic β-cell lines. These results are consistent with the contribution of the mutations in the development of diabetes in patients with the mutation. Because a functional loss of GLUT2 has been suggested to be responsible for hyperglycemia and relative hypoinsulinemia in the fed state in patients with Fanconi-Bickel syndrome and early onset diabetes in mice lacking GLUT2 (18Santer R. Schneppenheim R. Dombrowski A. Gotze H. Steinmann B. Schaub J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 324-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 19Guillam M.-T. Hummler E. Schaerer E. Wu J.-Y. Birnbaum M.J. Beermann F. Schmidt A. Deriaz N. Thorens B. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), the decreased expression of GLUT2, which could be generated by HNF-1β mutations, might be involved in the pathogenesis of hyperglycemia in patients in concert with other target gene defects. In this regard, further identification of the target genes of HNF-1β, which are expressed in pancreatic β-cells and liver, is important to better understand the pathogenesis of HNF-1β-deficient diabetes. The present study also shows that the two mutations function differently in pancreatic β-cells, possibly due to the difference of intracellular localization of the protein. Because the DNA binding activity of wild type is found to be reduced in the presence of A263fsinsGG (Fig. 1C), mutation in pancreatic β cells could interfere with the wild type regulation of target gene expression. Accordingly, the differing functional properties of the mutations in pancreatic β-cells may explain, at least in part, the differing severity of insulin secretion deficiency in the affected subjects. However, because only two mutations have so far been reported, further identification of families with the mutation will be necessary to understand to what extent these distinct molecular behaviors could account for differing clinical features in patients. Because the primary structures of HNF-1β and HNF-1α, which recognize the same DNA sequence, are highly related and the tissues that express these proteins are mostly overlapped except lung and ovary (6Frain M.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1435-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), the structure and function relationships in HNF-1β may also apply to HNF-1α. The possible nuclear localization sequence of HNF-1β, which is absent in R177X, is also found in HNF-1α (residues 197–205), so the modification of nuclear targeting could be observed in HNF-1α mutations involved in this region (20Yamada S.

Accordingly, functional analysis of the HNF-1β mutations should be helpful to clarify the molecular mechanism of impaired insulin secretion not only in HNF-1β-deficient diabetes but also in the related form of HNF-1α-deficient diabetes.

https://openalex.org/W2018704517,"Heat shock transcription factor (HSF) mediates the stress-induced expression of heat shock protein genes (<i>hsp</i>). However, HSF is required for normal cell function even in the absence of stress and is important for cell cycle progression, but the mechanism that mediates these effects of HSF is unknown. Here, it is shown that a member of the HSF family, HSF2, interacts with the PR65 (A) subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). HSF2 binding to PR65 blocks its interaction with the catalytic subunit, due to competition between HSF2 and catalytic subunit for the same binding site in PR65. In addition, overexpression of HSF2 stimulates PP2A activity in cells, indicating the relevance of HSF2 as a regulator of PP2A <i>in vivo</i>. These results identify HSF2 as a dual function protein, capable of regulating both <i>hsp</i> expression and PP2A activity. This could function as a mechanism by which<i>hsp</i> expression is integrated with the control of cell division or other PP2A-regulated pathways."

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1291-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). In cell extracts, TBP is associated with several polypeptides, the so-called TBP-associated factors (TAFs) (2Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 769-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 3Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). The main complex of TBP and TAFs (TAFIs) required for transcription by RNA polymerase I is called SL1; however, a different complex (TAFIIs) is required for transcription by RNA polymerase II and is called TFIID. TBP also associates with RNA polymerase III-specific TAFs (TAFIIIs) forming the TFIIIB transcription factor. TBP is one of the most conserved proteins during the eukaryotic evolution and consists of two direct repeats encompassing the C-terminal two-thirds of the polypeptide which are highly conserved in all known TBPs (4Peterson M.G. Tanase N. Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Science. 1990; 248: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 5Hoffmann A. Sinn E. Yamamoto T. Wang J. Roy E. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1990; 346: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). For long time it was thought that eukaryotic cells contain a single TBP that mediates transcription by all three RNA polymerases. However, a few years ago a Drosophila gene product highly homologous to TBP was cloned that has been called TBP-related factor (dTRF) (6Crowley T.E. Hoey T. Liu J.-K. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Tjian R. Nature. 1993; 361: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Biochemical analyses have shown that TRF can form a stable complex with TFIIA and TFIIB on a TATA-containing promoter and substitute for TBP in directing transcription in vitro by RNA polymerase II (7Hansen S.K. Takada S. Jacobson R.H. Lis J.T. Tjian R. Cell. 1997; 91: 71-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In cell extracts TRF is associated with a novel set of TAFs (nTAFs) forming large multiprotein complexes.In situ hybridization experiments have revealed that TRF mRNA is expressed in the central nervous system and in primary spermatocytes in adults (6Crowley T.E. Hoey T. Liu J.-K. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Tjian R. Nature. 1993; 361: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Immunostaining experiments using anti-TRF antibodies showed that TRF protein is expressed in most of the early embryo (until developmental stage 13); however, during embryonic development becomes restricted to cells of the nervous system and gonads. Immunofluorescence of Drosophila polytene chromosomes has shown that TRF protein is associated with a few sites on the chromosome (7Hansen S.K. Takada S. Jacobson R.H. Lis J.T. Tjian R. Cell. 1997; 91: 71-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In an effort to analyze whether mammalian cells contain homologues of TBP, we have identified and cloned a mammalian TBP-related factor (mTRF) from mouse embryos and human cells that shows considerable amino acid sequence similarity to TBP and Drosophila TRF. Recombinant mTRF can bind to the TATA box and substitute for TBP in directing transcription by RNA polymerase II. To identify homologues to TBP, we searched the expressed sequence tag (EST) data base of GenBankTM by using the TBLASTN program and the amino acid sequence of human TBP and Schizosaccharomyces pombe TBP as a probe (8Altschul S.F. Thomas L.D. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipmann D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58751) Google Scholar). Several ESTs were identified that encode different portions of a protein with significant homology to the C-terminal portion of human TBP and Drosophila TRF. The human ESTs encoding the different portions of the polypeptide homologous to TBP (accession numbersAA281228, W26331, AA448144, and AA412574) were overlapped to obtain a complete open reading frame (ORF). EST AA412574 was obtained from the IMAGE consortium through Research Genetics and sequenced further. The ORF contained in the cDNA was identified using the ORF Finder program at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. ESTs of mouse origin (accession numbers AA798230, AA840611, AA821478, and W89738) encoding a similar polypeptide were overlapped, and the ORF was predicted as described above. The ORF of mTRF was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides designed from the sequence obtained from the data base. The oligonucleotide primer encoding the N terminus of the protein contained a NdeI restriction site and the one encoding the C terminus contained a BamHI site. The human ORF was amplified from cDNA purified from a HeLa cDNA library in Lambda ZAP (Stratagene), and the mouse ORF was amplified from embryo cDNA (Marathon ready cDNA, CLONTECH). The amplified fragment was digested with NdeI and BamHI restriction enzymes and cloned in-frame into the NdeI and BamHI sites of a bacterial expression vector (pET15b, Novagen), which adds a His6 tag at the N terminus of the polypeptide. Positive clones were sequenced using the Sequenase version 2 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). All our attempts to express human TRF in bacteria were negative, and only mouse TRF could be expressed. Mouse TRF in pET15b was expressed in BL21(DE3). Bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertoni medium at 37 °C to an A 600 of 0.6, and the production of recombinant protein was induced with 0.5 mm IPTG and grown for an additional period of 4 h. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by mild sonication at 4 °C in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 500 mm KCl, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mmimidazole, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation and loaded onto a 1-ml column of nitriloacetic-acid-agarose containing immobilized Ni2+ ions (Ni2+-NTA-agarose, Qiagen). The column was washed with 10 column volumes of lysis buffer supplemented with 20 mmimidazole and eluted with 10-ml linear gradient of imidazole (0.02–0.3m) in lysis buffer. Fractions containing recombinant mouse TRF were detected by Western blot with monoclonal antibodies against the His6 tag (CLONTECH), pooled, and dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mmKCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1m EDTA, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Transcription reactions and product analyses were performed as described previously (9Maldonado E. Ha I. Cortes P. Weis L. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6335-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Reactions mixtures (40 μl) were incubated at 30 °C for 45 min and contained 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 8 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm ammonium sulfate, 12% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 20,000, RNase T1 (2 units), 0.6 mm ATP, 0.6 mm CTP, and 15 μm[α-32P]UTP, and 0.3 μg of supercoiled pML(C2AT) template DNA, which contains the MLP promoter fused to a G-less cassette (10Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4394-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Transcription factors added to the reactions were: recombinant TFIIA (30 ng), recombinant TFIIB (20 ng), recombinant TFIIF (30 ng), recombinant TFIIE (20 ng), TFIIH purified from HeLa nuclear extract, and affinity purified RNA polymerase II (50 ng). The transcription factors were purified as described (11Maldonado E. Drapkin R. Reinberg D. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 72-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Mouse TRF or recombinant TBP was added as indicated in the figure legends. The reaction products were separated on a 4% polyacrylamide/urea gel. Gels were dried and exposed overnight to Kodak MS x-ray films. DNA binding assays were performed as described (9Maldonado E. Ha I. Cortes P. Weis L. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6335-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The protein components, as indicated in the figure legends, were incubated with 0.1–1 ng (approximately 5000 cpm) of labeled DNA probe containing the Ad-MLP sequences from −40 to +20 for 30–45 min at 30 °C. The complexes formed were separated by electrophoresis through a 4% polyacrylamide gel containing Tris borate-EDTA buffer (1× TBE; pH 8.2, 40 mm Tris, 40 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with 4% (v/v) of glycerol. Electrophoresis was performed at 100 V until the bromphenol blue dye reached the bottom of the gel. The gels were dried and exposed overnight to x-ray films. To identify mammalian genes encoding proteins homologous to TBP, we used the BLAST server at the National Center for Biotechnology Information to screen the nonredundant GenBankTM EST data base by querying with the amino acid sequence of human TBP. Several ESTs from mouse and human encoding different portions a protein with homology to TBP were found. The nucleotide sequence of the ESTs contained a ORF of 558 base pairs that encodes a polypeptide of 186 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 20.5 kDa. The polypeptide shows significant homology to the amino acid sequence of the C-terminal domain of all the TBP proteins that have been cloned at the present (64% similar and 41% identical) and to Drosophila TRF (60% similar and 38% identical; Fig. 1). Both ORFs from mouse and human encode a identical protein (Fig. 1, compare mTRF and hTRF). To test the biochemical activities of mTRF, we inserted the amplified mouse ORF into an expression vector, and the recombinant protein was produced in bacteria. Fig. 2Ashows that a protein of M r 25,000 is produced upon induction with IPTG (lanes 2 and 3). The molecular mass of the recombinant protein is slightly higher than the predicted size. This protein was purified by Ni2+-NTA-agarose chromatography (Fig. 2B,lane 3), and its identity was confirmed by Western blot analysis using antibodies against the His6 tag epitope (Fig. 2C, lane 2). One of the characteristics of TBP is to bind to the TATA boxes and form stable complexes with TFIIA and TFIIB on the promoter (4Peterson M.G. Tanase N. Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Science. 1990; 248: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 9Maldonado E. Ha I. Cortes P. Weis L. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell.

To investigate the possibility that mTRF could bind the TATA box of the promoter, we performed gel retardation experiments using the Ad-MLP TATA box. Fig. 3A (lanes 2 and 3) shows that yeast or human TBP form a stable complex on the TATA box in the presence of recombinant human TFIIA. As reported earlier (9Maldonado E. Ha I. Cortes P. Weis L. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6335-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) human TBP (Fig. 3A, lane 5) or yeast TBP (data not shown) does not form a stable complex in TBE gels in the absence of TFIIA. However, in contrast to TBP, mTRF binds strongly to the TATA box in the absence of TFIIA (Fig. 3A, lane 4), and its binding is not enhanced further by TFIIA (lanes 7 and 8). The binding of TRF is specific for the TATA box, because it can be competed by an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide containing the TATA box (data not shown). To analyze the effect of TFIIB on the binding of mTRF to the TATA box, we carried out the gel retardation experiment described in Fig. 3B. Human TBP in the presence of TFIIB forms a complex (Fig. 3B, lanes 2, 3, and 4); however, TFIIB by itself does not (Fig. 3B, lane 5). As indicated in Fig. 3A, mTRF by itself binds strongly to the TATA box (Fig. 3B, lane 6), forming a high molecular weight complex. The complex was dependent on the amount of mTRF, since a smaller amount of mTRF does not form a complex (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 6 and 9). Mammalian TRF in the presence of TFIIB also forms complexes (lanes 7 and 8), but in contrast to human TBP, it forms at least two different complexes. Those complexes are dependent on the presence of TFIIB, because an equal amount of mTRF alone does not produce a complex (lane 9). It is known that the C-terminal domain of TBP is sufficient for TATA binding and basal transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II (4Peterson M.G. Tanase N. Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Science. 1990; 248: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 5Hoffmann A. Sinn E. Yamamoto T. Wang J. Roy E. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1990; 346: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The great similarity between TBP and mTRF and the ability of mTRF to bind to the TATA box and to form complexes with TFIIB on the promoter DNA suggest that mTRF can substitute for TBP inin vitro transcription. To study this possibility, we carried out transcription reactions reconstituted with affinity purified RNA polymerase II, recombinant transcription factors, and either TBP or mTRF using as a template the Ad-MLP. Fig. 4 shows that our reconstituted system in the absence of TBP gave no detectable transcription (lane 1); however, as expected, human or yeast TBP (lanes 2and 5) can direct transcription from the Ad-MLP. When mTRF was added in place of TBP (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4), we obtained a good level of transcription, although slightly lower than that obtained with TBP. Those results strongly suggest that mTRF can replace TBP in directing transcription by RNA polymerase II from the Ad-MLP. It is well known that TBP can support basal transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II; however, it cannot support activated transcription in the absence of TAFs and coactivators in an assay reconstituted with recombinant or highly purified transcription factors and RNA polymerase II. We have also examined the possibility that mTRF could support activated transcription in the absence of TAFs. However, in our system mTRF is not able to support activated transcription using recombinant transcription factors, highly purified TFIIH, affinity purified RNA polymerase II, and the acidic activator Gal4-VP16 (data not shown). This analysis indicates that mTRF can support basal transcription initiation, but it cannot support activated transcription in the absence of TAFs or additional cofactors. In this study, we report the cloning and expression of a protein homologous to TBP that we called mTRF. Our results allow us to conclude that mTRF binds to the TATA box, forms complexes with TFIIB, and is able to substitute for TBP in directing basal transcription by RNA polymerase II. Mammalian TRF is highly homologous to the C-terminal domain of TBP and also shows the two-directed repeated domain structure, and the high degree of homology suggests that it can fold into the same structure as TBP (15Burley S.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 16Hori R. Carey M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 124-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian TRF, like TBP, is unable to support activated transcription by Gal4-VP16 in our reconstituted transcription system, which lacks TAFs and coactivators. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that mTRF could support activated transcription in the presence of TAFs, coactivators, or mediator-like activities similar to those described in the yeast and human RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (17Kim Y.-J.

Nature. 1996; 381: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) Although it was thought that eukaryotic cells contain a single TBP, it has recently been reported that Drosophila cells contain a TBP-like molecule TRF (6Crowley T.E. Hoey T. Liu J.-K. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Tjian R. Nature. 1993; 361: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Drosophila TRF is highly homologous to TBP, and based in amino acid sequence comparison it has been proposed that both proteins most likely bind similar TATA sequences on the promoter DNA (7Hansen S.K. Takada S. Jacobson R.H. Lis J.T. Tjian R. Cell. 1997; 91: 71-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 16Hori R. Carey M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 124-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical analyses ofDrosophila TRF have revealed that it interacts with both TFIIA and TFIIB, binds to the TATA box of several promoters, and is able to support transcription by RNA polymerase II in place of TBP (7Hansen S.K. Takada S. Jacobson R.H. Lis J.T. Tjian R. Cell. 1997; 91: 71-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).In vivo, Drosophila TRF localizes in the central nervous system and male reproductive organs (6Crowley T.E. Hoey T. Liu J.-K. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Tjian R. Nature. 1993; 361: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In polytene chromosomes TRF is located in a small number of chromosomal sites (7Hansen S.K. Takada S. Jacobson R.H. Lis J.T. Tjian R. Cell. 1997; 91: 71-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In cell extracts TRF is complexed with its own set of novel TAFs (designed nTAFs) (6Crowley T.E. Hoey T. Liu J.-K. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Tjian R. Nature. 1993; 361: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 7Hansen S.K. Takada S. Jacobson R.H. Lis J.T. Tjian R. Cell. 1997; 91: 71-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Based on those results it has been postulated that Drosophila TRF is a cell-specific transcription factor that directs the transcription of a subset of neuron-specific genes (7Hansen S.K. Takada S. Jacobson R.H. Lis J.T. Tjian R. Cell. 1997; 91: 71-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar,20Buratowsky S. Cell. 1997; 91: 13-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The function of mTRF could be similar to that of DrosophilaTRF in directing transcription from a small subset of genes in a cell- or tissue-specific fashion. Alternatively, it is also possible that mTRF may play a more general role in the expression of cellular genes. A scan from the available EST data base shows that mTRF is expressed in tissues such as testis, brain, retina, mammary gland, placenta, liver, spleen, and lung. It is also expressed in cells such macrophage, B-cells, and HeLa cells. These data suggest that mTRF may have a more general pattern of expression than dTRF. Mammalian TRF may also be complexed with its own set of TAFs that can confer to mTRF-specific promoter or activator functions, as it has been postulated forDrosophila TRF. Our preliminary observations suggest that mTRF in HeLa cell extracts is part of a multiprotein complex, because it elutes from gel filtration columns with an apparent molecular mass of greater than 200 kDa, as detected by Western blot analysis. 2E. Maldonado, unpublished results. The molecular cloning of mTRF will allow us to determine its biochemical composition and functions. It will also allow us to determine whether it is expressed in a cell- or tissue-specific fashion. We do not rule out the possibility that mTRF, like TBP, may also play role in RNA polymerase I and III transcription, or it could use a novel set of basal factors for directing transcription from selected promoters. Because homologues of TBP have been found, it seems plausible that there could be homologues of the other general transcription factors as well.

In both cases the relative increase as a function of temperature in f′ is larger in calcium-F-actin than in magnesium-F-actin in the range of 5–40 °C, which indicates that both the intramonomer and the intermonomer flexibility of the actin filaments are larger in calcium-F-actin than those in magnesium-F-actin. The intermonomer flexibility was proved to be larger than the intramonomer one in both the calcium-F-actin and the magnesium-F-actin. The distance between Gln41 and Cys374 residues was found to be cation-independent and did not change during polymerization at 21 °C. The steady-state fluorescence anisotropy data of fluorophores attached to the Gln41 or Cys374 residues suggest that the microenvironments around these regions are more rigid in the magnesium-loaded actin filament than in the calcium-loaded form.

The tension generation in the striated muscle is performed through a series of chemical reactions by cyclic interaction of myosin with ATP and actin, and at least six intermediates are proposed for actomyosin ATPase in solution (1Stein L.A.

Springer-Verlag, New York1987: 3-16Google Scholar). On a cellular level in supramolecular complexes where stabilizing forces may modulate the hydrolysis process, some contribution from actin flexibility and dynamics to the contraction process cannot be excluded. This statement is supported by earlier and recent suggestions about the role of actin during the force development in muscle (4Wakabayashi K. Sugimoto Y. Tanaka H. Ueno Y. Takezawa Y. Amemiya Y. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 2422-2435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Flexural rigidity experiments suggested that the actin filament was extensible (5Oosawa F. Biorheology. 1977; 14: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These findings were supported by electron microscopic measurements on the sarcomere in rigor fibers (6Suzuki S. Sugi H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1983; 81: 531-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The extensibility of the thin filaments was also suggested by the changes of the spacings of the x-ray diffraction pattern during contraction (4Wakabayashi K. Sugimoto Y. Tanaka H. Ueno Y. Takezawa Y. Amemiya Y. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 2422-2435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 7Huxley H.E. Stuart A. Sosa H. Irving T. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 2411-2421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Actin filaments were shown to be elastic and extensible by measuring the stiffness of the actin-tropomyosin complex with in vitronanomanipulation (8Kojima H. Ishijima A. Yanagida T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12962-12966Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Polarization studies using fluorescent phalloidine on skinned rabbit psoas fibers have demonstrated that the generation of force was associated with a conformational change in the actin filament (9Prochniewicz-Nakayama C. Yanagida T. Oosawa F. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1663-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The sliding of actin filaments is diminished by the cross-linking of actin subunits (10Prochniewicz E. Yanagida T. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Egelman et al. (11Egelman E.H. Francis N. DeRosier D. Nature. 1982; 298: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and later the workgroup in DeRosier's laboratory (12Stokes D.L. DeRosier D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1005-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) emphasized the existence of variations in the twist along the axes of isolated filaments, which increases the fluctuations of approximately 10° in the azimuthal angle between adjacent monomers. The fluctuations, bending and twisting motions, are modulated by myosin and actin-binding proteins (13Thomas D.D. Seidel J.C. Gergely J. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 132: 257-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 14Galazkiewicz B. Belágyi J. Dabrowska R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The tighter binding of myosin to actin reduces the torsional motion of a small section of F-actin, as reported by standard transfer-EPR measurements (13Thomas D.D. Seidel J.C. Gergely J. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 132: 257-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 15Mossakowska M. Belágyi J. Strzelecka-Golaszewska H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 175: 557-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The change of the orientation of spin labels on F-actin during interaction with heavy meromyosin was also reported (10Prochniewicz E. Yanagida T. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 16Yanagida T. Nakase M. Nishiyama K. Oosawa F. Nature. 1984; 307: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). It is also known that the actin monomers undergo conformational changes or slight rotation during contraction (17Yagi Y. Matsubara I. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The large free energy change caused by binding of the myosin head to actin is also able to generate conformational change in actin (18Geeves M.A. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Experimental evidences suggest that the exchange of the bound cation can also modify the dynamic and conformational state of the actin filament. Cation-dependent changes in the mobility of the N-terminal segment (first 21 amino acids) of actin were observed performing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments (19Heintz D. Kany H. Kalbitzer H.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12686-12693Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The torsional rigidity of actin filaments is sensitive to the nature of the bound cation, since this parameter is larger in calcium-F-actin than in magnesium-F-actin (20Yasuda R. Miyata H. Kinosita Jr., K. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Orlova and Egelman (21Orlova A. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) have shown that the bending flexibility of filaments polymerized from magnesium-actin is approximately four times larger than in the case of calcium-F-actin. Contrary to these data, other laboratories found no essential change in the filament flexibility using dynamic light scattering measurements (22Scharf R.E. Newman J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1253: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) or various other techniques to determine the persistence length of the filaments (23Isambert H. Venier P. Maggs A.C. Fattoum A.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 559-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The direct measurement of the flexibility of single actin filaments corroborates this latter conclusion (20Yasuda R. Miyata H. Kinosita Jr., K. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Using fluorescence methods Miki et al. (25Miki M. Wahl P. Auchet J.-C. Biophys. Chem. 1982; 16: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) observed that the binding of Ca2+ to actin increased the mobility of the fluorophore attached to Cys374. The results of our spectroscopic experiments indicated that filaments polymerized in the presence of Ca2+ were more flexible than the filaments of magnesium-actin (26Hild G. Nyitrai M. Belágyi J. Somogyi B. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 3015-3022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The recently published actin powerstroke model was based on the length changes in actin filaments, which require conformational transitions in each monomer (27Schutt C.E. Rozycki M.D. Chick J.K. Lindberg U. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 12s-18sPubMed Google Scholar). During the ATP hydrolysis cycle the myosin heads can adopt more than one conformation in interaction with actin, and the multiple modes of binding can relate to different actin conformations. Recently, the negative experimental results of the rotating cross-bridge model have led to suggestions of a more complex model of the muscle contraction. This model involves large scale conformational changes of myosin head in the light chain-binding domain that rotates relative to the actin-binding portion of the catalytic domain (28Huxley A.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1974; 243: 1-43Crossref Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 29Thomas D.D. Ramachandran S. Roopnarine O. Hayden D.W. Ostap M.E. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 135s-141sAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 30Cook R. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 21: 53-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The closure of the cleft on the actin-binding domains, which follows the release of the Pi, results in a specific interaction between the two proteins, and this interaction might be modulated by the actual dynamic and conformational states of both proteins. Although there are strong indications that actin is an active part of the contracting system, we are still far from understanding the details of the biological function of this abundant protein. The lack of complete understanding of the function of the actin in the contracting system can emphasize the importance of further investigations dealing with this matter. The principal aim of this study was to characterize the effect of divalent cations on the internal flexibility and the conformational states of actin filaments using the method of fluorescence resonance energy transfer. According to the fluorescence resonance energy transfer data presented in this paper, the calcium-F-actin is proved to be more flexible than the magnesium-F-actin in either the intermonomer or the intramonomer protein flexibility. The intermonomer flexibility is larger than the intramonomer one, regardless of the nature of the bound cation. In accordance with these flexibility data the steady-state anisotropy experiments indicate that the microenvironments of the Gln41 and Cys374 residues are more rigid in the Mg2+-saturated filaments than in calcium-F-actin. KCl, MgCl2, CaCl2, Tris,N-(iodoacetyl)-N′-(5-sulfo-1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine (IAEDANS), 1The abbreviation used is: IAEDANS, N-(iodoacetyl)-N′-(5-sulfo-1-naphthyl)-ethylenediamine; FC, fluorescein cadaverine; IAF, 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein; G-actin, monomeric actin; F-actin, actin filament. quinine (hemisulfate salt), dimethylformamide, guinea pig liver transglutaminase (TGase), and EGTA were obtained from Sigma. Iodoacetamide 5-fluorescein (IAF) and fluorescein cadaverine (FC) were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) and α-mercaptoethanol were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany); the Bradford protein assay reagent was purchased from Bio-Rad (München, Germany), and NaN3 was from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Acetone-dried powder of rabbit skeletal muscle was obtained as described by Feuer et al. (31Feuer G. Molnár F. Pettkó E. Straub F.B. Hung. Acta Physiol. 1948; I: 150-163Google Scholar). Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was prepared according to the method of Spudich and Watt (32Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stored in 2 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.2 mm ATP, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 0.1 mm α-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% NaN3 (buffer A). Labeling of the Cys374 residue (Fig. 1A) with IAEDANS was performed as described earlier (33Miki M. dos Remedios C.G. Barden J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and F-actin (2 mg/ml) was incubated with 10-fold molar excess of IAEDANS for 1 h at room temperature. Labeling of the same residue in separate samples with IAF was carried out in the following way: monomeric actin (2 mg/ml) was mixed with the 10-fold molar excess of IAF over the protein and incubated for 3–4 h at room temperature. Then the actin was polymerized for 12–16 h at 4 °C. After the labeling procedures, the samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. The pellets were dissolved in buffer A and dialyzed overnight against buffer A (in the case of IAF-labeled actin the dialyzing buffer contained 1% (v/v) dimethylformamide as well). The Gln41 residue (Fig. 1A) was modified with FC by the use of the procedure of Takashi (34Takashi R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 938-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and G-actin was incubated with 10-fold molar excess of the dye in the presence of 1 mg/ml TGase. The labeling was carried out for 16 h at 4 °C. Unbound FC was removed similarly as described in the case of IAEDANS and IAF labeling procedures. The G-actin concentration was determined with a Shimadzu UV-2100 spectrophotometer by using the absorption coefficient of 0.63 mg ml−1 cm−1 at 290 nm (35Houk W.T. Ue K. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 62: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In the case of IAEDANS-labeled G-actin the measured absorbance at 290 nm was corrected for the contribution of the fluorescence label (using A (290 nm) = 0.21 × A (336 nm) for the bound IAEDANS). Relative molecular mass of 42,300 Da was used for monomeric actin (36Elzinga M. Collins J.H. Kuehl W.M. Adelstein R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2687-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Occasionally, the actin concentration was also determined by using Bradford (Coomassie Blue) protein assay reagent (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). The assay was calibrated as described by the manufacturer using unlabeled monomeric actin. The concentrations determined according to the two methods were identical within the limits of experimental error. The concentration of the IAEDANS, IAF, and FC in the protein solution was determined by using the absorption coefficient of 6100m−1 cm−1 at 336 nm (38Hudson E.N. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4154-4161Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), 77,000m−1 cm−1 at 496 nm (39Takashi R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5164-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and 75,500 m−1 cm−1 at 493 nm (40Lorand L. Parameswaran K.N. Velasco P.T. Hsu L.K.-H. Siefring Jr., G.E. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), respectively. The extent of labeling for IAEDANS, IAF, and FC was determined to be 0.83 ± 0.02, 0.55 ± 0.04, and 0.8 ± 0.03, respectively. Studying the intermonomer flexibility, part of the actin sample was labeled with the donor molecule (IAEDANS), and the remaining part was modified separately with the acceptor (IAF). After the labeling procedure, the two samples were mixed to obtain the molar ratio of the donor labeled and not donor labeled (acceptor labeled and unlabeled) monomers of minimum 1:10 (Fig. 1B). In order to measure the intramonomer flexibility, the actin monomer was double-labeled (i.e.labeled with both the donor (IAEDANS) and the acceptor (FC)). Then the solution of labeled actin was mixed with a solution of unlabeled actin monomers to adjust the labeled:unlabeled actin ratio to a minimum of 1:10 (Fig. 1C). After the appropriate mixture of labeled and unlabeled actin monomers the polymerization process was initiated. Magnesium-G-actin was obtained according to the method of Strzelecka-Golaszewska et al. (41Strzelecka-Golaszewska H. Moraczewska J. Khaitlina S.Y. Mossakowska M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The solution of calcium-G-actin was dialyzed exhaustively against buffer A in which the concentration of CaCl2 was decreased to 50 μm. EGTA and MgCl2 were added and adjusted to final concentrations of 0.2 and 0.1 mm, respectively. The sample was stirred at room temperature for 10 min. Polymerization of either calcium-G-actin or magnesium-G-actin was initiated by the addition of 100 mm KCl and 2 mm of the appropriate cation (CaCl2 or MgCl2) to the solutions of calcium-G-actin or magnesium-G-actin, respectively. The samples were incubated at room temperature for 2 h, then dialyzed overnight against the appropriate polymerization buffer (buffer A supplemented with 100 mm KCl and 2 mm divalent cation, while in the case of magnesium-actin, the buffer also contained 0.1 mmEGTA). The concentration of actin was between 30 and 40 μm, unless stated otherwise. The fluorescence emission spectra of the donor were recorded at temperatures ranging between 5 and 40 °C with a Perkin-Elmer LS50B luminescence spectrometer in the presence and the absence of the appropriate acceptor (FC in the experiments dealing with intramonomer flexibility and IAF in the study of intermonomer flexibility). The excitation wavelength for the IAEDANS was 360 nm. The slits were set to 3 nm in both the excitation and emission paths. The spectra were corrected for the inner filter effect as described earlier (42Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy: Instrumentation for Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 43-47Google Scholar). To calculate fluorescence resonance energy transfer efficiency (see Equation 2), the under-curve areas of these emission spectra were calculated between 380 and 460 nm. In this wavelength range, the contribution of the acceptor (either the FC or the IAF) to the measured fluorescence is negligible. The steady-state fluorescence anisotropy of the donor and acceptor molecules was calculated from the polarized emission components (F VV, F VH,F HV, and F HH, where the subscripts indicate the orientation of the excitation and emission polarizers) as follows,r=(FVV−GFVH)/(FVV+2GFVH)(Eq. 1) where G =F HV/F HH. In the case of actin-bound IAEDANS, the excitation wavelength was 360 nm, and the emission wavelength was 460 nm, while for the fluorescein derivatives the excitation monochromator was set to 493 nm, and the emission was measured at 520 nm. The slits were set to 3 nm. In these experiments the concentration of the actin was decreased to 5 μmafter the polymerization by diluting the sample with the appropriate buffer. In this way the depolarizing effect of light scattering was reduced to a negligible level. The corrected fluorescence emission spectra of IAEDANS-F-actin was recorded in the absence of the acceptor at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm to obtain the fluorescence quantum yield of the donor molecule. The quantum yield of quinine sulfate (0.53 in 0.1 nH2SO4) was used as a reference (43Kouyama T. Kinosita Jr., K. Ikegami A. Biophys. J. 1985; 47: 43-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To test the reversibility of the temperature-induced changes in fluorescence, the samples were re-measured by cooling back the solution to the initial low temperature (7 °C) or repeating the measurements after overnight dialysis. The errors of the measured data presented in this paper are mean ± S.E. calculated from the results of three to five independent experiments. The transfer efficiency of the fluorescence resonance energy transfer occurring between a single donor and single acceptor can be calculated from the fluorescence intensities as follows,E={1−((FDA/cDA)/(FD/cD))}/β(Eq. 2) where F DA and F Dare the fluorescence intensities of the donor molecule in the presence and the absence of the acceptor, respectively; β symbolizes the acceptor/monomer molar ratio. c D and c DA are the concentrations of the donor molecule in the samples indicated by the subscripts. By knowing the fluorescence energy transfer efficiency (E), it is possible to determine the distance (R) between the donor and acceptor molecules from the following equation:E=Ro6/(Ro6+R6)(Eq. 3) where Ro is the Förster's critical distance defined as the donor-acceptor distance where the fluorescence resonance energy transfer efficiency is 50%. The use of Equation 3requires the calculation of R o as follows,Ro6=(8.79×10−11)n−4κ2ΦDJ(Eq. 4) where n is the refractive index of the medium, κ2 characterizes the relative orientation of the donor and acceptor molecules, ΦD is the fluorescence quantum yield of the IAEDANS in the absence of acceptor, and J is the overlap integral given in m−1cm−1 nm4. The overlap integral (J) is defined as follows,J=∫FD(λ)εA(λ)λ4dλ/∫FD(λ)dλ(Eq. 5) where F D(λ) is the corrected fluorescence emission spectra of the donor, and εA(λ) is the molar extinction coefficient of the acceptor. The temperature profile of the normalized energy transfer parameter f (defined as the ratio of the transfer efficiency and the fluorescence quantum yield of the donor in the presence of acceptor) is proportional to the mean value of the energy transfer rate constant, <k ti>, which has been shown to be an appropriate parameter for monitoring intramolecular fluctuations and/or conformational changes of a macromolecule (44Somogyi B. Matkó J. Papp S. Hevessy J. Welch G.R. Damjanovich S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3403-3411Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar),f=〈E〉/〈ΦDA〉=〈kti/kf〉=C〈Ri−6κi2〉(Eq. 6) where ΦDA is the fluorescence quantum yield of the donor in the presence of acceptor, and k f is the rate constant of the fluorescence emission. According to earlier publications the value of k f is fairly constant under a wide variety of experimental conditions (see e.g.Ref. 45Badley R.A. Teale F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 44: 71-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), therefore here its value is taken as constant. The subscript “i” indicates the value of the given parameter for thei th population, taking a momentary picture, and C is a constant involving the refractive index (n) and the overlap integral (J), which were assumed to be constant (44Somogyi B. Matkó J. Papp S. Hevessy J. Welch G.R. Damjanovich S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3403-3411Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of this parameter to temperature is able to provide information regarding the flexibility of the protein matrix between the two fluorophores. It should be noted that f is sensitive to changes in the donor-acceptor distance originating from any kind of intramolecular motions. Thus, the temperature profile of this parameter provides information about the average flexibility of the protein matrix located between the two labels. The method was developed for systems where the energy transfer occurred between a single donor and a single acceptor (44Somogyi B. Matkó J. Papp S. Hevessy J. Welch G.R. Damjanovich S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3403-3411Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, in the present experiments dealing with intermonomer energy transfer, one should take into account that the donor can transfer energy to acceptors located on more than one neighboring actin protomers,i.e. the transfer is directed to a multiple acceptor system. Considering the helical structure of the actin filament, it seems reasonable that the acceptor population can be divided into two characteristically different groups: 1) acceptors on the closest protomer in the single-started genetic helix and 2) acceptors affecting the fluorescence of the donor from the double-started long-pitch helix. It is also assumed that acceptors on more distant protomers are not efficient in the reduction of the donor fluorescence. Accordingly, the donor-acceptor system can be described with two different equilibrium donor-acceptor distance distributions. It could be easily shown by using simple mathematical transformations that the measured normalized energy transfer parameter of the system having a single donor interacting with two different groups of acceptor molecules is the sum of the normalized energy transfer efficiencies characterized by the individual donor-acceptor systems (see also Ref. 46Gennis R.B. Cantor C.R. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 2509-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar),f=f1+f2(Eq. 7) Considering that the value of the fluorescence quantum yield is proportional to the fluorescence intensity measured at a given wavelength, it is usually more convenient to determine the value of thef′, which is defined as follows (44Somogyi B. Matkó J. Papp S. Hevessy J. Welch G.R. Damjanovich S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3403-3411Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar),f′=〈Ei〉/FDA=C′〈Ei〉/〈ΦDi〉(Eq. 8) where F DA is the fluorescence intensity of the donor in the presence of acceptor, and C′ is a constant that is proportional to the C used in Equation6. The actin monomer has one high-affinity and three or more lower-affinity (i.e. intermediate- and low-affinity) cation-binding sites (see Ref. 47Estes J.E. Selden L.A. Kinosian H.J. Gershman L.C. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1992; 13: 272-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar for review). It is very likely thatin vivo the high-affinity site is occupied by Mg2+, and the Mg2+ and K+ ions compete for the lower-affinity binding sites (47Estes J.E. Selden L.A. Kinosian H.J. Gershman L.C. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1992; 13: 272-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The ion composition of the buffer that was used in this study to prepare magnesium-F-actin can be considered as a reasonable model for the free ion concentrations of Mg2+ and K+ in the cytosol (47Estes J.E. Selden L.A. Kinosian H.J. Gershman L.C. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1992; 13: 272-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This preparation resulted in a magnesium-F-actin that contains Mg2+ at the high-affinity binding site and probably either Mg2+ or K+ at the lower-affinity sites. According to earlier publications the type of the cation at the lower-affinity binding sites might have an important biological effect (48Zimmerle C.T. Patane K. Frieden C. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6545-6552Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The calcium-actin filaments were polymerized in the presence of millimolar concentration (2 mm) of CaCl2. Following this procedure the Ca2+ in calcium-F-actin, similar to the Mg2+ in magnesium-F-actin samples, occupies the high-affinity binding site and probably competes with the K+ for the lower-affinity binding sites. In the present work we explored the differences between flexibilities of filaments polymerized from calcium-actin and magnesium-actin by investigating separately the intermonomer and the intramonomer flexibilities. To examine intermonomer flexibilities the donor IAEDANS and the acceptor IAF are attached to different actin protomers within the filament. The relatively low donor ratio in these samples (compared with that of actin without the donor) assures that there is no acceptor in the actin filament, which is in resonance transfer with two donor molecules (see Fig. 1B). Accordingly, in these experiments one is dealing with a single donor-multiple acceptor system (see “Materials and Methods”). In a different experimental setup, the double labeling of the actin monomer makes it possible to study intramonomer flexibility within the actin filament. In this case it was necessary to dilute the samples with unlabeled actin to exclude the possibility of interaction between donor and acceptor molecules located on neighboring protomers. Considering the atomic model of the actin filament (49Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar), it is very likely that the 10-fold dilution of the double labeled actin monomers with unlabeled monomers accurately separates the labeled monomers within the double helix of actin filaments (Fig. 1C). The experiments designed to monitor the reversibility of the temperature-induced changes in the fluorescence parameters gave evidence that the changes were reversible. The distance between the donor (IAEDANS at Cys374) and acceptor (FC at Gln41) molecules is 4.46 ± 0.07 nm and 4.49 ± 0.06 nm in the Ca2+- and Mg2+-loaded forms of the monomer, respectively, indicating that the exchange of the bound cation does not influence the relative position of the Gln41 and Cys374residues in the acti"

The clustering of mutations in the carboxyl-terminal nonhelical NC1 domain in Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (SMCD) suggests a critical role for NC1 in collagen X structure and function. In vitrocollagen X DNA expression, using T7-driven coupled transcription and translation, demonstrated that although α1(X) containing normal NC1 domains can form electrophoretically stable trimers, engineered SMCD NC1 missense or premature termination mutations prevented the formation of electrophoretically stable homotrimers or heterotrimers when co-expressed with normal α1(X). To allow the detection of more subtle interactions that may interfere with assembly but not produce SDS-stable final products, we have developed a competition-basedin vitro co-expression and assembly approach. Our studies show that α1(X) chains containing SMCD mutations reduce the efficiency of normal α1(X) trimer assembly, indicating that interactions do occur between mutant and normal NC1 domains, which can impact on the formation of normal trimers. This finding has important implications for the molecular pathology of collagen X mutations in SMCD. Although we have previously demonstrated haploinsufficiency as one in vivo mechanism (Chan, D., Weng, Y. M., Hocking, A. M., Golub, S., McQuillan, D. J., and Bateman, J. F. (1998)J. Clin. Invest. 101, 1490–1499), the current study suggests dominant interference is also possible if the mutant protein is expressed in vivo. Furthermore, we establish that a conserved 13-amino acid aromatic motif (amino acids 589–601) is critical for the interaction between the NC1 domains, suggesting that this region may initiate assembly and the other NC1 mutations interfered with secondary interactions important in folding or in stabilizing the assembly process.

The collagens are an extensive protein family defined by the characteristic triple helix motif formed from three α-chain subunits and the ability to associate into precise extracellular supramolecular assemblies (1Kielty C.M.

By analogy with the fibrillar collagens, the NC1 domain would be expected to associate and initiate trimerization (7Brass A. Kadler K.E. Thomas J.T. Grant M.E. Boot-Handford R.P.

In vitro expression and assembly studies have also shown that collagen X trimers can form rapidly via NC1 interactions, which are stable to the dissociative conditions of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in the presence of urea (9Chan D.

These strong NC1 interactions are likely to be largely hydrophobic in nature (8Barber R.E. Kwan A.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 11Schmid T.M. Linsenmayer T.F. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The critical importance of the NC1 domain in collagen X molecular assembly and function has also been highlighted by the characterization of mutations in patients with Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (SMCD) (MIM 156500) (12Chan D. Jacenko O. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 13Wallis G.A. Rash B. Sykes B. Bonaventure J. Maroteaux P. Zabel B. Wynne-Davies R. Grant M.E. Boot-Handford R.P. J. Med. Genet. 1996; 33: 450-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although these mutations include amino acid substitutions, nonsense mutations and deletions resulting in predicted protein truncation, in vitro expression, and assembly studies suggested that a common molecular defect is that the SMCD mutations compromise NC1 association and prevent the formation of stable collagen X homotrimers (9Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 10Chan D. Weng Y.M. Hocking A.M. Golub S. McQuillan D.J. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13566-13572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These data suggested that SMCD resulted from a functional haploinsufficiency of assembly-competent α1(X). The haploinsufficiency model was further supported by the characterization of an SMCD premature termination mutation that led to mutant mRNA instability and a total absence of the α1(X) mutant allele mRNA in patient growth plate cartilage tissue (14Chan D. Weng Y.M. Graham H.K. Sillence D.O. Bateman J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1490-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, although the in vitro assembly data with other SMCD NC1 mutations demonstrated that the formation of electrophoretically stable NC1 mutant homotrimers was prevented, these experiments did not exclude the possibility that weaker or transient interactions may occur that could impact on the formation of the collagen X trimer. Indeed, trace amounts of heterotrimer assembly were detected with some α1(X) NC1 missense mutants expressed in vitro (10Chan D. Weng Y.M. Hocking A.M. Golub S. McQuillan D.J. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13566-13572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), suggesting that some NC1 mutations may allow mutant/normal heterotrimer assembly or interfere with the efficiency of normal α1(X) assembly and could thus exert a dominant negative effect on collagen X assembly. Collagen X interactions in in vitro expression studies have been assessed by their stability to the denaturing conditions of SDS-PAGE, conditions under which assemblies of other collagen types are not stable. To overcome the obvious limitations of assessing potentially biologically important interactions in this harsh system, we have developed a competition-based approach, which is designed to allow the assessment of such SDS-stable assemblies, as well as weaker interactions that may interfere with assembly but not produce SDS-stable final products. We have used this in vitroco-expression and assembly assay to examine in detail the molecular consequences of SMCD mutations and to further dissect the role of NC1 domains in the assembly process. Our studies show that α1(X) chains containing SMCD mutations can interfere with the efficiency of normal α1(X) assembly during in vitro co-expression, demonstrating the potential of these mutations to exert a dominant negative effect if the mutant protein is expressed in vivo.Furthermore, our studies demonstrate that deletion of the 13-amino acid conserved aromatic motif (7Brass A. Kadler K.E. Thomas J.T. Grant M.E. Boot-Handford R.P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 126-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) completely abrogates the ability of the α1(X) NC1 to interact with other normal or mutant chains, identifying this domain as a crucial sequence in collagen X assembly. The production of full-length α1(X) cDNA expression constructs containing specific SMCD NC1 missense mutations (G618V, 2Amino acid sequence assignment numbers are from the translation start site (32Thomas J.T.

Three additional nonsense mutations at amino acid positions 610, 650, and 666 were generated using PCR to produce sequential protein truncations of the NC1 domain from the carboxyl terminus (see “Results and Discussion”). The terminations at positions 650 and 666 closely resemble nonsense mutations in SMCD patients reported at positions 651 (15McIntosh I. Abbott M.H. Francomano C.A. Hum. Mutat. 1995; 5: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and 665 (16McIntosh I. Abbott M.H. Warman M.L. Olsen B.R. Francomano C.A. Hum. Mol.

Antisense primers, [email protected], [email protected], and [email protected] (TableI), were designed to incorporate a stop codon at the appropriate position with an additional overhang sequence to include an AflII site for the ease of cloning. These primers were paired with a sense primer, BX1 (Table I), to amplify fragments of 118, 331, and 379 base pairs using a normal human full-length collagen X cDNA construct (pTM1-h10wt) as the template (9Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The PCR reactions were performed in 50 μl of 10 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, and 0.75 μm of each of the primers. The reactions were carried out using the GeneAmp PCR system 2400 (Perkin-Elmer). Cycle one was performed at 96 °C for 2 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min and then followed by 25 cycles at 96 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The reaction was terminated at 72 °C for 1 min. The resultant fragments were digested with EcoNI and AflII. EcoNI is an endogenous site within the PCR fragment, whereas AflII is an introduced site in the PCR product 3′ to the termination codon. The appropriate restriction fragments were purified and cloned into the unique EcoNI and AflII sites of pTM1-h10wt. In the construct with a termination codon at position 650, the codon for the amino acid at position 649 was changed from CAG (Gln) to CCT (Pro) to facilitate cloning. All constructs were sequenced to ensure that there were no PCR errors.Table INormal and mutant PCR primers for site-directed mutagenesisPrimersPrimer sequence (5′ to 3′)aSequences in bold are the annealing sequences in the PCR reactions.Primer locationbSequence assignment numbers are from the transcription start site (33).Orientation[email protected]TGCATGCATCTTA AACATGAGTCCCTTcThis primer contains an overhang sequence with an engineered stop codon (underlined sequence) and an Af II restriction enzyme site.1831–1817Antisense[email protected]TGCATGCATCTTAAGGGTCATTTTCTGTcThis primer contains an overhang sequence with an engineered stop codon (underlined sequence) and an Af II restriction enzyme site.2041–2029Antisense[email protected]TGCATGCATCTTAAG AGGAGTATAGGcThis primer contains an overhang sequence with an engineered stop codon (underlined sequence) and an Af II restriction enzyme site.2091–2079AntisenseBX1CAGGGGGTAACAGGAATGCC1726–1745SenseHX1TAAAGGGGATCCAGGAAGTC1491–1510SenseHX6CTTTTCAGCCTACCTCCATA2235–2216AntisenseAΔ-1GTCATGCCTGAG AGGACTGGAATCdSequences shown in italics are the overlapping sequences in secondary PCRs.1654–1665, 1849–1860SenseAΔ-2GATTCCAGTCCT CTCAGGCATGAC1860–1849, 1665–1654AntisenseBΔ-1AGGACTGGAATC CACGTGCATGTG1849–1860, 1990–1911SenseBΔ-2CACATGCACGTG GATTCCAGTCCT1911–1990, 1860–1849AntisenseCΔ-1TACCACGTGCAT GTCCACTCCTCT1897–1908, 2098–2109SenseCΔ-2AGAGGAGTGGA CATGCACGTGGTA2109–2098, 1908–1897Antisensea Sequences in bold are the annealing sequences in the PCR reactions.b Sequence assignment numbers are from the transcription start site (33Reichenberger E.

The mutant primer sets and their relative positions are shown in Table I. Primer sets AΔ-1 and AΔ-2, BΔ-1 and BΔ-2, and CΔ-1 and CΔ-2 were designed to delete regions A,B, and C, respectively. The PCR reactions were carried out as described above. Two independent PCR products were first produced by using HX1 (sense) with primer set 2 (AΔ-2, BΔ-2, or CΔ-2; antisense) and by using HX6 (antisense) with primer set 1 (AΔ-1, BΔ-1 or CΔ-1; sense) with each of the mutant primer sets in the primary round of PCR using pTM1-h10wt (5 ng) as a template. After purification, the appropriate fragment pairs were mixed and used as templates in the second round of overlapping PCR with primers HX1 and HX6. The recombinant mutant PCR fragments were digested withBamHI and NsiI, purified, and cloned into corresponding sites within pTM1-h10wt. All mutant constructs were sequenced to ensure there were no PCR errors. Cell-free transcription/translation was performed as described previously in the presence or absence of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes (Promega) using the TNT T7 polymerase coupled transcription and translation system (Promega) (9Chan D.

The conditions were modified by reducing the amount of added plasmid DNA (25–50 ng), and the reaction volume of 6.25 μl was labeled with 5 μCi of translation gradel-[35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products). Co-translation experiments were performed in the presence of microsomal membranes by aliquoting 5.25 μl from a master mix containing 25 ng/5.25 μl of control plasmids, which were either the wt full-length α1(X) or an assembly-competent helix deletion (helixΔ) α1(X) reporter construct (10Chan D.

To these reactions, 1 μl containing 0, 6.25, 12.5, or 25 ng of NC1 mutant plasmids or a luciferase control plasmid (Promega) were added prior to transcription and translation at 30 °C for 90 min. Reactions were terminated by adding 40 μl of sample buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, containing 2% SDS (w/v), 2 m urea, 10 mmdithiothreitol, and 20% sucrose (w/v)) (9Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G.

In some experiments, a sample buffer with milder denaturation properties was used (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, containing 0.5% SDS (w/v) and 20% sucrose (w/v)). Samples were incubated at room temperature for 10 min prior to electrophoresis on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C for 16 h in the absence of urea. Radioactive bands were imaged and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Although the characterization of collagen X mutations in SMCD clearly demonstrates that it is an important component in cartilage development and growth, the precise molecular role of type X in the hypertrophic cartilage extracellular matrix remains elusive (12Chan D.

Detailed ultrastructural analysis of cartilage fromCol10a1-null mice revealed subtle changes in the normal distribution of proteoglycans and cartilage matrix vesicles in the growth plate, suggesting that the collagen X matrix plays a role in the organization of cartilage matrix structure during remodeling and mineralization (18Kwan K.M.

The molecular interactions that initiate collagen X assembly and facilitate the formation of the functional extracellular assemblies are not yet well characterized. The definition of the effects of SMCD mutations on protein assembly in vitro has provided information on homotrimer assembly and identified the NC1 domain to be critical for the initiation of assembly (9Chan D.

Furthermore, because SMCD is a heterozygous dominant disorder, important information is also missing about the effect of mutant collagen X expression on the assembly and function of the normal collagen X expressed in the growth plate cartilage. To explore the consequences of NC1 mutations on collagen X homotrimer assembly and assembly with normal chains to form heterotrimers, a range of SMCD mutations was studied by co-expression and assembly in vitro. In addition to point mutations G618V and Y598D (9Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 10Chan D. Weng Y.M. Hocking A.M. Golub S. McQuillan D.J. Bateman J.F. J. Biol.

In conjunction with a previously identified nonsense mutation, [email protected] (14Chan D. Weng Y.M. Graham H.K. Sillence D.O. Bateman J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1490-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these termination mutations allowed us to explore the possible effect of sequentially truncated proteins on collagen X assembly to address whether NC1 microdomains important for assembly are identified by the concentration of SMCD amino acid substitution mutations at residues 589–601, 614–618, and 644–652 (Fig. 1). To study the contribution of other NC1 domains in assembly, three in-frame deletions (AΔ, BΔ, and CΔ) were produced (Fig. 1). Region A (amino acids 525–584) represents a variable region that differs between species (19Elima K. Eerola I. Rosati R. Metsaranta M. Garofalo S. Perala M. de Crombrugghe B. Vuorio E. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), in which no mutations have been identified. Regions B (amino acids 589–601) and C (amino acids 604–667) are conserved regions in the NC1 domain containing SMCD mutations. Region B also corresponds to the conserved 13-amino acid aromatic motif proposed by Brasset al. (7Brass A. Kadler K.E. Thomas J.T. Grant M.E. Boot-Handford R.P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 126-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) to have functional importance in trimer association. In vitro transcription and cell-free translation demonstrated that the mutant plasmid constructs generated in the current study ([email protected], [email protected], [email protected], AΔ, BΔ, and CΔ) were translated into α1(X) chains of molecular weight consistent with the introduced premature terminations or deletions when compared with the normal (wt) α1(X) chains (Fig. 2). In the presence of canine microsomal membranes, translocation of pre-α1(X) chains into the microsomes was demonstrated by the removal of the signal peptide, which resulted in smaller α1(X) chains for wt α1(X) chains and helixΔ α1(X) chains (Fig. 2) and for all the mutant α1(X) chains (data not shown). This efficient translocation of normal and several SMCD α1(X) mutations (Y598D, G618V, Y632X, 1952delC, and 1963del10) has been demonstrated previously (10Chan D. Weng Y.M. Hocking A.M. Golub S. McQuillan D.J. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13566-13572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Under these conditions the wt α1(X) chains and helixΔ α1(X) chains containing normal NC1 domains assembled efficiently into homotrimers that were electrophoretically stable (Fig. 2) (9Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 10Chan D. Weng Y.M. Hocking A.M. Golub S. McQuillan D.J. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13566-13572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast, all the α1(X) chains containing NC1 mutations (Y598D, G618V, Y632X, [email protected], [email protected], [email protected], AΔ, BΔ, and CΔ) did not form electrophoretically stable mutant homotrimers (Fig. 2). In addition, co-translational expression studies also demonstrated that all these NC1 mutant chains also did not associate stably with chains containing a normal NC1 domain to form heterotrimers that were detectable electrophoretically (Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). To determine whether the relatively harsh denaturing conditions of the preparation for electrophoresis (2% SDS and 2 m urea) masked the detection of mutant α1(X) assembly, the analyses were repeated using sample loading buffer containing 0.5% SDS and no urea under nonreducing conditions. Care was taken to ensure that the samples were kept at room temperature or below during preparation and electrophoresis. Even under these mild sample preparation conditions no electrophoretically stable mutant homotrimer or mutant/normal heterotrimer formation was detected (data not shown). These results are also consistent with previous translation experiments carried out with other SMCD NC1 mutant α1(X) chains (1952delC and 1963del10) (10Chan D. Weng Y.M. Hocking A.M. Golub S.

Expression of the Ptn gene is tightly regulated in a temporally and cell-type-specific manner during development (5Silos-Santiago I. Yeh H.J. Gurrieri M.A. Guillerman R.P. Li Y.S. Wolf J. Snider W. Deuel T.F. J. Neurobiol. 1996; 32: 283-296Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast, Ptn gene expression in adults is constitutive and limited to fewer cell types than in development, such as selective populations of neurons and glia (5Silos-Santiago I. Yeh H.J.

Cells transformed byPtn develop into highly vasculized, aggressive tumors when implanted into the nude mouse and characteristically have significant disarray of cytoskeletal structure. Furthermore, thePtn mRNA is highly expressed in a significant proportion of samples from different human tumors and in about one-fourth of over 40 human tumor cell lines of different origins (7Fang W. Hartmann N. Chow D.T. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25889-25897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Tsutsui J. Kadomatsu K. Matsubara A. Hamanoue S. Takao S. Shimazu H.

PTN is highly expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells, a cell line derived from a highly malignant human breast cancer that constitutively expresses high levels of the endogenous Ptn gene. A truncated mutant of PTN constitutively expressed in these cells reverted the transformed phenotype of the breast cancer cell (12Zhang N. Zhong R. Wang Z.Y. Deuel T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16730-16736Google Scholar), establishing the importance of endogenous PTN signaling in maintaining the malignant phenotype of these cells. To pursue the molecular basis of PTN signaling in transformation, we constructed and tested a series of mutantPtn molecules to establish domains required for transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. We now report that an internal domain within PTN residues 41–64 is required to transform NIH 3T3 cells. We also report the interesting finding that either the N- or C-terminal lysine-rich domain is essential to enable residues 41–64 to initiate transformation and that the potency of PTN to transform is regulated by two 5-amino acid internal “repeats.” The human Ptn cDNA encodes an ∼18 kDa protein of 168 amino acids before cleavage of a 32-amino acid signal peptide (Fig. 1). We constructed 11 mutant humanPtn genes using PCR and “transformer” site-directed mutagenesis (CLONTECH, San Francisco, CA) (Fig. 1). The mutant genes were cloned into theKpnI/EcoRI site downstream of the SV40 early promoter in the eukaryotic expression vector pAGE103 (11Chauhan A.K. Li Y.S. Deuel T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), which consists of basic elements including the origin of replication, a polyadenylation splicing signal, and the neomycin-resistance gene driven by the thymidine kinase promoter. The mutant PTN proteins, PTN 1–122 (Δ123–136), PTN 1–64 (Δ65–136), and PTN 1–40 (Δ41–136) are C-terminal deletions of the PTN 136 amino acid protein. Two internal repeated amino acid sequences (GAECK) were identified at residues 41–45 and 64–68 of PTN. PTN Δ65–68 and PTN Δ42–45/Δ65–68 were constructed to ablate one or both of the two internal repeats. PTN Lys-91 → Asn/Arg-92 → Gln mutations were introduced into WT Ptn by site-directed mutagenesis. PTN 40–136 (Δ1–40), PTN 69–136 (Δ1–68), and PTN 101–136 (Δ1–100) were constructed as N-terminal deletions of human PTN. PTN 13–122 (Δ1–12, Δ123–136) was created to delete both N- and C-terminal polylysine clusters. All of the Ptn constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing (see Fig. 1). NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum. The cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 per 100-mm dish and transfected 24 h later by calcium phosphate precipitation (11Chauhan A.K. Li Y.S. Deuel T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Transfectants selected with G418 at an active strength of 700 μg/ml media were changed every three days until colony appeared, and clonal cell lines were established from expansion of single colonies. Colonies with high levels of PTN expression were pooled and analyzed. Total cellular RNAs were isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate method and analyzed as described previously (12Zhang N. Zhong R. Wang Z.Y. Deuel T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16730-16736Google Scholar). To establish rates of cell growth, 1 × 105 of clonally selected cells were seeded in triplicate onto 35-mm dishes, trypsinized, and counted using a hemocytometer at 24 and 48 h. For focus formation assays, 2 × 105 cells for each construct were plated in triplicate onto 60-mm dishes, stained with crystal violet, photographed after 16 days, and counted. Anchorage-independent growth in soft agar was carried out as described previously (11Chauhan A.K. Li Y.S. Deuel T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 104 of cells representative of each of the stably transfected Ptnconstructs were suspended in 3 ml of (0.35% w/v) agar containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% calf serum and overlaid onto a 0.7% (w/v) agar solution in two 60-mm dishes. After 16 days, colonies of >20 cells were scored as positive using an inverted microscope equipped with a measuring grid. Tumor formation in 6-week-old female athymic nude mice (strain nu/nu; Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) was tested by injecting subcutaneously 2 × 106 cells suspended in 200 μl of sterile phosphate-buffered saline into each flank. Animals with tumors were monitored daily starting at 10 days. After 6 weeks, selected animals were sacrificed, and tumor size was measured in two perpendicular diameters. The amino acid sequences of WT PTN and mutant proteins are illustrated in Fig. 1. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with WT or mutantPtn expression plasmids (11Chauhan A.K. Li Y.S. Deuel T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and the expression levels of each stably transfected cell line were determined by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2). Each of the mutant and WT cDNA transcripts was readily detected. However, the levels of expression of PTN 1–40 and PTN 101–136 were low compared with others, perhaps resulting from mRNA instability. Exogenous PTN and PTN mutants expressed in the transfected cells lines were also detected in cell lysates and conditioned media by Western blot analysis (data not shown). The growth rate of each of the stably transfected NIH 3T3 cells were then determined. The rate of growth of cells transfected with PTN 1–122, PTN 1–64, PTN Δ65–68, PTN Δ42–45/Δ65–68, PTN Lys-91 → Asn/Arg-92 → Gln, PTN 41–136, and WT PTN increased nearly 1.5-fold at 24 h and >2-fold at 48 h relative to the control NIH 3T3 cells (transfected with the empty vector). Cells lines transfected with PTN 1–40, PTN 69–136, PTN 101–136, and PTN 13–122 grew at a rate similar to that of the control cells. In focus forming assays, cell lines derived from WT PTN, PTN 1–122, PTN 1–64, PTN 41–136, PTN Δ42–45, PTN Δ65–68, PTN Δ42–45/Δ65–68, and PTN Lys-9 → Asn/Arg-92 → Gln grew more rapidly than control NIH 3T3 cells. At confluence, they had grown to a density ∼2-fold higher than that of control or NIH3T3 cells stably expressing the mutant cDNAs PTN 1–40, PTN 69–136, PTN 101–136, and PTN 13–122. However, the more rapidly growing cells grew in clusters, and cell numbers were difficult to quantitate after 3 days. The cells were highly refractile and spindled-shaped in appearance (data not shown). After 16 days, foci were readily observed in cultures of these cells (Fig. 3), whereas foci were not detected in cultures of NIH 3T3 cells expressing PTN 1–40, PTN 69–136, PTN 101–136, or PTN 13–122 or in control cells. The number of foci on each dish were counted (TableI) and compared with the control cells. The foci in cells expressing PTN 1–122, PTN Δ65-Δ68, PTN Lys-91 → Asn/Arg-92 → Gln, and PTN 41–136 were readily detected but somewhat reduced in number in comparison with WT PTN 1–136. Foci were not found in cultures expressing PTN 1–40, PTN 69–136, PTN 101–136, and PTN 13–122. Interestingly, an increase in numbers of foci was observed in cells expressing PTN 1–64 and PTN Δ42–45/Δ65–68, indicating that loss of the C-terminal residues 65–136 or deletion of the two internal repeat sequences enhance the transformation potency of PTN ∼2-fold in focus forming assays.Table IFocus formation and growth in soft agar of NIH 3T3 cells transfected with Ptn or its mutantsTransfectionFocus formationColonies formed in soft agar assayfoci/dish% Total cellspAGE103 vector alone∼50WT PTN (1–136)∼275∼5.7PTN 1–122 (1–132)∼251∼4.3ΔHuPtn-3 (1–64)∼531∼8.2PTN 1–40 ΔHuPtn-4 (1–40)∼20PTN Δ65–68∼218∼4.9PTN Δ42–45/Δ65–68∼489∼8PTN Lys-91 → Asn/Arg-92 → Gln∼234∼5.2PTN 41–136∼192∼4.8PTN 69–136∼30PTN 101–136∼10PTN 13–122∼10NIH 3T3 cells were stably transfected with human PTN (WT), PTN 1–122, PTN 1–64, PTN Δ65–68, PTN Δ42–45/Δ65–68, PTN Lys-91 → Asn/Arg-92 → Gln, PTN 41–136, PTN 69–136, PTN101–136, and PTN13–122 constructs or pAGE 103 vector alone as a control as described under “Materials and Methods” and grown in the presence of Geneticin (G418) (0.7 mg/ml) for 3 weeks.

To test tumor formation in nude mice, cells were implanted in flanks of athymic nude mice. Mice were examined daily, starting 10 days after injections, and tumors were measured at 6 weeks. Of the cells tested, NIH 3T3 cells expressing PTN 1–122, PTN 1–64, PTN Δ42–45/Δ65–68, and WT PTN developed readily detectable tumors within 2 weeks (Table II). NIH 3T3 cells transfected with the empty vector alone or cDNAs encoding PTN 69–136 or PTN 13–122 did not. After 6 weeks, the tumors observed in the animals injected with the NIH 3T3 cells expressing PTN or its mutants were examined. Surprisingly, significantly larger tumors were found at sites of injection of NIH 3T3 cells expressing WT PTN and PTN 1–122 when compared with PTN, PTN 1–64, and the largest tumors were observed in PTN from which the two internal repeats were deleted.Table IITumor formation in athymic nude mice of clonal NIH 3T3 cell lines transfected with WT Ptn or its mutant gene constructs or pAGE 103 vector aloneCell lineSize of the tumormm2NIH 3T3/PAGE 1030NIH 3T3/WT PTN145 ± 14NIH 3T3/PTN 1–122149 ± 11NIH 3T3/PTN 1–64108 ± 12NIH 3T3/PTN Δ42–45/Δ65–68198 ± 12NIH 3T3/PTN 69–1360NIH 3T3/PTN 13–1220Four animals per group were injected with 2 × 106cells/site.

Open table in a new tab Four animals per group were injected with 2 × 106cells/site. Tumors were measured 6 weeks after the injection of cells. The tumor size was calculated from the product of perpendicular diameters of tumors. In this study, we tested different domains of PTN to determine which domains are required for transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. It was established that amino acid residues 41–64 of PTN are required for transformation; none of the mutant PTN proteins that lacked PTN residues 41–64 transformed NIH 3T3 cells. Although the PTN receptor has not been identified, the results suggest that residues 41–64 contain a critical domain for signaling. A surprising finding was the requirement of either but not both the N- or C-terminal lysine-rich domains together with PTN 41–64 to transform NIH 3T3 cells, indicating that these domains support a similar functional role in transformation by PTN. These two domains may function in a different way than PTN residues 41–64 because the amino acid sequence of these two domains differs significantly. However, both domains have a strong net positive charge, suggesting they may interact with the receptor or an associated second “low affinity” receptor through electrostatic forces but are unlikely to signal active site-mediated receptor functions. Recently, N-syndecan has been implicated as a PTN binding protein (13Raulo E. Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. Nolo R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12999-13004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), however, the binding of N-syndecan to PTN is not specific to PTN because basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) competes for the PTN binding sites, and the glycosaminoglycan chains alone in N-syndecan bind both PTN and bFGF (13Raulo E. Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. Nolo R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12999-13004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). N-syndecan functions as a low affinity receptor and appears to regulate binding of bFGF to its high affinity receptor (14Walker A. Turbull J.E. Gallager T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 26: 931-935Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 15Cernousov M.A. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16810-16814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It seems possible that our results are consistent with a similar model in which the N and C termini of PTN facilitate the binding of PTN residues 41–64 to sites on a high affinity receptor. A surprising result of these experiments is the difference of NIH 3T3 cells expressing PTN 1–64 in focus and colony formation compared with tumor formation. The ability of PTN 1–64 to strongly induce focus and colony formation suggests a role of the C-terminal domain in loss of contact inhibition and anchorage independence. PTN residues 65–136 may contain a domain favoring tumor growth in vivo, such as tumor angiogenesis. The Ptn gene is highly expressed in breast cancers and melanomas and constitutively expressed in cell lines derived from these tumors. Ptn gene expression is not detectable in melanocytes and normal breast cells (7Fang W. Hartmann N. Chow D.T. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25889-25897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Chauhan A.K. Li Y.S. Deuel T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), suggesting that PTN signally has an important role in neoplastic growth. This view was strongly supported when introduction of a dominant negative PTN effector reversed the malignant phenotype of a human breast cancer cell line that constitutively expresses the Ptn gene. Our findings provide a structural basis for further studies on the functions of PTN in transformation in breast cancer and other human tumors. Our findings also provide a molecular model system to dissect the functional responses in tumors constitutively expressing PTN. We conclude that the potential of PTN to induce transformation is mediated by several functional domains. Residues 41–64 of PTN constitute an essential domain necessary for PTN-mediated transformation, whereas the C- and N-terminal lysine-rich domains function nearly equally to support residues 41–64 in PTN-dependent transformation, perhaps through a “docking” function to appropriately position PTN with its receptor. Two internal duplicates of PTN negatively regulate PTN transformation."

In redox-poised preparations, there is a significant spin-spin interaction between the reduced E m,7 = −120 mV [4Fe-4S] cluster of DmsB and the Mo(V) of the Mo-bisMGD of DmsA. This interaction is significantly modified in a DmsA-C38S mutant that contains a [3Fe-4S] cluster in DmsA, suggesting that the [3Fe-4S] cluster is in close juxtaposition to the vector connecting the Mo(V) and the E m,7 = −120 mV cluster of DmsB. In a DmsA-R77S mutant, the interaction is eliminated, indicating the importance of this residue in defining the interaction pathway.

DmsABC is a complex [Fe-S]-molybdoenzyme comprising a molybdenum cofactor-containing catalytic subunit (DmsA, 87.4 kDa) (2Cammack R. Weiner J.H.

Chem. 1993; 268: 3238-3244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DmsA and DmsB comprise a catalytic dimer anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane by DmsC (9Sambasivarao D. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5935-5943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cofactor extracts released from DmsABC have been shown to contain molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide (MGD) (3Rothery R.A. Simala Grant J.L. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2057-2063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of sequence comparisons (see below), the cofactor is almost certainly present in the form of Mo-bisMGD in the intact holoenzyme. DmsABC is a member of an emerging family of bacterial complex [Fe-S]-molybdoenzymes that includes the E. coli formate dehydrogenases (FdnGHI and FdoGHI) (10Berg B.L. Li J. Heider J. Stewart V. J.

Each member of this family has a molybdenum cofactor-containing catalytic subunit (assumed to be Mo-bisMGD (16Schindelin H. Kisker C. Hilton J. Rajagopalan K.V. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 272: 1615-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 17Hilton J.C. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)), a four-[Fe-S] cluster-containing electron transfer subunit, and a hydrophobic membrane anchor subunit. The various prosthetic groups of these enzymes catalyze overall reactions that involve the transfer of two electrons through the electron transfer subunit to or from a quinol-binding site associated with the membrane anchor subunit (6Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3247-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 18Magalon A. Rothery R.A. Giordano G. Blasco F. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5037-5045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The use of EPR spectroscopy to study the interactions between the prosthetic groups in wild-type and appropriately mutagenized enzymes may yield important information on the electron transfer pathway through the [Fe-S] clusters of the electron transfer subunit to the Mo-bisMGD cofactor of the catalytic subunit. In DmsABC, two of the [4Fe-4S] clusters of DmsB appear to be thermodynamically competent to transfer electrons from menaquinol (MQH2, reduced midpoint potential at pH 7Em,7 = −70 mV) to the Mo-bisMGD of DmsA (Em,7 values as follows: Mo(IV/V) = −175 mV; Mo(V/VI) = −15 mV (19Trieber C.A. Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27339-27345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)), and these have Em,7 values of −50 and −120 mV, respectively (2Cammack R. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8410-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 6Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3247-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that there is a significant conformational link between theEm,7 = −50 mV [4Fe-4S] cluster and a single menaquinol (MQH2) binding site associated with His-65 of DmsC (6Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3247-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 20Zhao Z. Weiner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20758-20763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This was established by using the MQH2 analog 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide to elicit an EPR line shape change on a genetically engineered [3Fe-4S] cluster in a DmsB-C102S mutant (4Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8296-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 6Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3247-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this mutant, theEm,7 = −50 mV cluster is replaced by a high potential [3Fe-4S] cluster, and therefore a role for theEm,7 = −50 mV [4Fe-4S] cluster of the wild-type enzyme can be envisioned in electron transfer from MQH2. The other cluster that appears to be thermodynamically competent to participate in catalytic electron transfer is theEm,7 = −120 mV cluster. It has been demonstrated that there is a strong spin-spin interaction between this cluster and the Em,7 = −50 mV cluster of the wild-type enzyme, consistent with both of them being part of an eight-iron (2[4Fe-4S]) ferredoxin motif (2Cammack R. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8410-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 6Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3247-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This pair may provide a conduit for electron flow through DmsB to the Mo-bisMGD of DmsA. The two remaining low potential clusters of DmsB (Em,7 = −240 and −330 mV) may play a role in defining the overall structure of this subunit in a manner similar to that suggested for the low potential [4Fe-4S] clusters of E. coli nitrate reductase A (21Guigliarelli B. Magalon A. Asso M. Bertrand P. Frixon C. Giordano G. Blasco F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4828-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and fumarate reductase (22Kowal A.T. Werth M.T. Manadori A. Cecchini G. Schröder I. Gunsalus R.P. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12284-12293Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Evidence exists to suggest a pathway of electron transfer from DmsB to the Mo-bisMGD of DmsA. The microwave power saturation properties of the Mo-bisMGD Mo(V) EPR spectrum are sensitive to the redox state of theEm,7 = −120 mV [4Fe-4S] cluster of DmsB (2Cammack R. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8410-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). DmsA also contains a vestigial [4Fe-4S] cluster binding motif close to its N terminus, which, when appropriately mutagenized, can be made to bind an engineered [3Fe-4S] cluster with an Em,7 of approximately 178 mV (23Trieber C.A. Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4620-4626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This motif has been shown to be involved in physiological electron transfer from the [4Fe-4S] clusters of DmsB to the Mo-bisMGD cofactor of DmsA (24Trieber C.A. Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7103-7109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the vestigial [4Fe-4S] cluster binding motif may be on the electron transfer pathway from the Em,7 = −120 mV cluster of DmsB to the Mo-bisMGD of DmsA. It would therefore be interesting to determine if the presence of an engineered DmsA [3Fe-4S] cluster has any effect on the observed interaction between the Mo-bisMGD and theEm,7 = −120 mV [4Fe-4S] cluster of DmsB. The structures of three proteins that have significant sequence similarity to DmsA have been solved. These are the Me2SO reductases from Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Rhodobacter capsulatus (16Schindelin H. Kisker C. Hilton J. Rajagopalan K.V. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 272: 1615-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 25Schneider F. Löwe J. Huber R. Schindelin H. Kisker C. Knäben J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 53-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and the formate dehydrogenase H (FdhF) from E. coli (26Boyington J.C. Gladyshev V.N. Khangulov S.V. Stadtman T.C. Sun P.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). In each case, the molybdenum cofactor is a Mo-bisMGD. Given the sequence similarity between these proteins and DmsA (35–41% similar, 25–32% identical), it is almost certain that the latter contains a Mo-bisMGD cofactor as well. The structure of FdhF is particularly relevant, since it contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster coordinated by its N-terminal Cys group. This cluster has been proposed to have an important role in the electron transfer pathway from formate to the artificial electron acceptor benzyl viologen (26Boyington J.C. Gladyshev V.N. Khangulov S.V. Stadtman T.C. Sun P.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Significant differences in the sequence of the N-terminal Cys groups have been identified between the bacterial molybdoenzyme catalytic subunits that contain a [4Fe-4S] cluster and those that do not (23Trieber C.A. Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4620-4626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). EPR evidence exists to place E. coliFdhF and Paracoccus denitrificans (formerlyThiosphaera pantotropha) periplasmic nitrate reductase (NapA) in the former group (27Breton J. Berks B.C. Reilly A.

Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4620-4626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 29Magalon A. Asso M. Guigliarelli B. Rothery R.A. Bertrand P. Giordano G. Blasco F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7363-7370Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the structure of FdhF (26Boyington J.C. Gladyshev V.N. Khangulov S.V. Stadtman T.C. Sun P.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), it is significant that there is a Lys residue located between the [4Fe-4S] cluster and one of the pterins of the Mo-bisMGD. This residue is highly conserved in the group of enzymes that contain a [4Fe-4S] cluster coordinated by the N-terminal Cys group of the catalytic subunit (23Trieber C.A. Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4620-4626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the group that has the Cys group but no [4Fe-4S] cluster, this residue is replaced by an Arg (Arg-77 of DmsA and Arg-98 of NarG). When DmsA-R77 is mutagenized to Ser, electron transfer from the [4Fe-4S] clusters of DmsB to the Mo-bisMGD of DmsA is blocked (24Trieber C.A. Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7103-7109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It would therefore be interesting to test the effect of the DmsA-R77S mutation on the Mo(V)-[4Fe-4S] cluster interaction. In this paper, we describe the interactions observed by EPR that involve the Mo-bisMGD cofactor, the E m,7= −120 mV [4Fe-4S] cluster of DmsB, and engineered [3Fe-4S] clusters of appropriately mutagenized DmsA and DmsB. In the absence of detailed crystallographic data, these studies provide important information on the interactions between the prosthetic groups of DmsABC as well as on the electron transfer pathway from MQH2 to Me2SO. The E. coli strain and plasmids used in this study are listed in TableI. pDMS170 bears the wild-typedmsABC operon behind an fnr-dependent promoter and was generated by ligating the 4.8-kilobase pairEcoRI–SalI fragment from pDMS223 (4Rothery R.A.

All routine cloning work was carried out essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

All plasmids were transformed into E. coli HB101. pDMS170 was used to express the wild-type DmsABC used in this study and is functionally equivalent to the plasmid pDMS160 used in previous studies (4Rothery R.A.

Cells were harvested and washed in 100 mm MOPS and 5 mmEDTA (pH 7.0). Membranes were prepared by French pressure cell lysis and differential centrifugation as described previously (4Rothery R.A.

Membranes were used at a protein concentration of approximately 30 mg ml−1, and the following redox dyes were added to a final concentration of 50 μm: quinhydrone, 2,6-dichloroindophenol, 1,2-naphthoquinone, toluylene blue, phenazine methosulfate, thionine, duroquinone, methylene blue, resorufin, indigotrisulfonate, indigodisulfonate, anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid, phenosafranine, benzyl viologen, and methyl viologen. All samples were prepared in 3-mm internal diameter quartz EPR tubes and were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen-chilled ethanol before being stored under liquid nitrogen until use. Spectra were recorded using a Bruker ESP300 EPR spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR-900 flowing helium cryostat. Instrument conditions and temperatures were as described in the individual figure legends. Microwave power saturation data were fitted to the equation,S=KP/(1+P/P1/2)0.5b(Eq. 1) where S is the signal height, K is a proportionality factor, P is the microwave power,P½ is the microwave power for half-saturation, and b is the inhomogeneity parameter (35Innes J.B.

Fig. 1 shows Mo(V) EPR spectra recorded at 75 K of membranes containing the wild-type (Fig. 1A), DmsA-C38S (Fig. 1B), and DmsA-R77S (Fig. 1C) mutant forms of DmsABC. All three spectra appear to be essentially identical, with g values of approximately 1.984, 1.980, and 1.960 (g1, g2, and g3), suggesting that neither the DmsA-C38S nor the DmsA-R77S mutation has any significant effect on the immediate coordination sphere of the molybdenum of the Mo-bisMGD cofactor. Fig. 2A shows Mo(V) potentiometric titrations of wild-type and DmsA-C38S mutant DmsABC. For the wild-type enzyme, plots of the intensity of the g = 1.980 peak-troughversus E h can be fitted to twoEm,7values of −3 ± 3 mV (Mo(V/VI)) and −148 ± 14 mV (Mo(IV/V)) (three determinations), in reasonable agreement with previously reported values (19Trieber C.A. Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27339-27345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the case of the DmsA-C38S mutant, plots of the g = 1.980 peak-trough versus E h can be fitted to twoEm,7 values of −5 ± 4 mV (Mo(V/VI)) and −128 ± 13 mV (Mo(IV/V)) (three determinations), indicating that the mutation and/or the presence of the DmsA [3Fe-4S] cluster has a minor effect on the Mo(IV/V) couple (a ΔEm,7 of approximately +20 mV). Fig. 2B shows the effect of the DmsA-R77S mutation on the Em,7 values of the Mo-bisMGD cofactor. The plots can be fitted to twoEm,7 values of −27 ± 3 mV (Mo(V/VI)) and −149 ± 10 mV (Mo(IV/V)) (three determinations). In this case, the mutation has a minor effect on the Mo(V/VI) couple (a ΔEm,7 of approximately −24 mV). Given their lack of effect on the Mo(V) EPR line shape and their minor electrochemical effects, it is unlikely that the two DmsA mutations cause gross changes in the overall structure of DmsABC. Cammack and Weiner (2Cammack R. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8410-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) originally identified an enhancement of the spin relaxation of the Mo(V) species of wild-type DmsABC that was consistent with it being due to an interaction between the Mo(V) and the reduced Em,7 = −120 mV cluster. Fig. 3A shows microwave power saturation curves recorded at various redox potentials for the g = 1.98 peak-trough of the Mo(V) spectrum at 30 K. As the potential is reduced, the data can be fitted to two components, a saturable noninteracting component (dominant at high E h) and a nonsaturable component (dominant at low E h). The fraction of noninteracting Mo(V) decreases with decreasingE h with an apparent n = 1Em,7 of −140 mV (Fig. 3B). Given that the fraction of noninteracting Mo(V) at each E h is obtained from log-log plots of the microwave power saturation data, the observed E h of −140 mV is in reasonable agreement with the published Em,7of −120 mV for one of the [4Fe-4S] clusters of DmsB (2Cammack R. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8410-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 6Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3247-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with (i) the interacting [4Fe-4S] cluster being theEm,7 = −120 mV cluster and (ii) theEm,7 = −50 mV cluster not contributing independently to this interaction. Fig. 4shows microwave power saturation curves for wild-type, DmsA-C38S, and DmsA-R77S DmsABC at potentials of approximately −20 and −150 mV. In the DmsA-C38S mutant, the microwave power saturation curve of theE h = −20 mV Mo(V) signal is essentially identical to that of wild-type DmsABC, saturating with a singleP½ of 1.2 mW. In contrast to the wild type, atE h = −155 mV the Mo(V) signal saturates as an apparent single component with a P½ of 2.0 mW and an inhomogeneity parameter (b) of 0.8. When microwave power saturation curves are recorded using redox poised samples (betweenE h = −20 mV and E h = −180 mV),b decreases to a lower limit of approximately 0.8 as theEm,7 = −120 mV [4Fe-4S] cluster becomes reduced (data not shown). Potentiometric studies indicate that theEm,7 values of the DmsB [4Fe-4S] clusters (including the Em,7 = −120 mV cluster) remain unaltered in the DmsA-C38S mutant (23Trieber C.A. Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4620-4626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of the [3Fe-4S] cluster appears to significantly modulate the interaction between the Em,7 = −120 mV cluster of DmsB and the Mo(V) of the Mo-bisMGD cofactor of DmsA. In the DmsA-R77S mutant, the microwave power saturation curve of theE h = −18 mV sample is again very similar to that of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 4). In this case, theP½ is estimated to be 1.4 mW. However, atE h = −146 mV, the saturation curve is essentially identical to that observed at −18 mV, indicating that the DmsA-R77S mutation eliminates the magnetic interaction between the Mo(V) and Em,7 = −120 mV cluster of DmsB. EPR spectra recorded at 12 K of redox-poised samples indicate that there is no detectable shift of the midpoint potential of theEm,7 = −120 mV cluster in the DmsA-R77S mutant (data not shown). When the potential dependence of the microwave power saturation curves are investigated, greater than 95% of the Mo(V) saturates with a low P½, even at potentials as low as −200 mV (data not shown). Because of the disappearance of the Mo(V) signal at low E h, it was not possible to investigate the effect of reduction of the two lowest potential [4Fe-4S] clusters (the Em,7 = −240 and −330 mV clusters) on the microwave power saturation properties or line shape of the Mo(V) spectrum. Me2SO reductase fromRh. sphaeroides can be prepared in a glycerol-inhibited form by reduction followed by reoxidation in the presence of high concentrations of glycerol (32Finnegan M.G. Hilton J. Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson M.K. Inorg. Chem. 1993; 32: 2616-2617Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 33George G.N. Hilton J. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 1113-1117Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The Mo-bisMGD of this form of the enzyme remains in the Mo(V) state under oxidizing conditions. In order to investigate potential interactions between the molybdenum and the DmsA [3Fe-4S] cluster in the DmsA-C38S mutant, we generated membrane preparations containing glycerol-inhibited wild-type and mutant DmsABC. Fig. 5A shows EPR spectra recorded at 75 K of the glycerol-inhibited forms of both wild-type (Fig. 5A, i) and DmsA-C38S mutant (Fig. 5A, ii) DmsABC. Glycerol-inhibited enzyme (33George G.N. Hilton J. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 1113-1117Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar) was prepared by oxidation of dithionite-reduced enzyme in the presence of 50% (v/v) glycerol. In both cases, the EPR spectrum has g values (g1, g2, and g3) of 1.986, 1.978, and 1.959. Thus, the spectrum of the glycerol-inhibited form of Mo(V) is slightly more rhombic than the noninhibited form (cf.Fig. 1), allowing resolution of the g1 peak from the g2 peak-trough. Except for a slight broadening of the g2 peak-trough in the glycerol-inhibited DmsA-C38S mutant (Fig. 5A, ii), there appears to be little effect elicited on the glycerol-inhibited Mo(V) spectrum by the presence of a [3Fe-4S] cluster in DmsA. The estimated P½ values for the Mo(V) signals of the glycerol-inhibited wild-type and DmsA-C38S DmsABC are 0.6 and 0.9 mW, respectively (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that there is no significant enhancement of the spin relaxation of the glycerol-inhibited Mo(V) caused by the presence of an engineered [3Fe-4S] cluster in DmsA. The redox state of the DmsA [3Fe-4S] cluster was verified by recording spectra at 12 K, and under the conditions used to generate the glycerol-inhibited samples it was found to be in the oxidized S = ½ state."
