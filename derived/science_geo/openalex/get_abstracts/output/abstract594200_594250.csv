https://openalex.org/W2752047512,"Value orientations used to explain or justify conservation have been rooted in arguments about how much and in what context to emphasize the intrinsic versus instrumental value of nature. Equally prominent are characterizations of beliefs known as the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP), often used to help explain pro-environmental behaviour. A recent alternative to these positions has been identified as 'relational value'-broadly, values linking people and ecosystems via tangible and intangible relationships to nature as well as the principles, virtues and notions of a good life that may accompany these. This paper examines whether relational values are distinct from other value orientation and have potential to alleviate the intrinsic-instrumental debate. To test this possibility, we sought to operationalize the construct-relational values-by developing six relational statements. We ask: 1) Do the individual statements used to characterize relational values demonstrate internal coherence as either a single or multi-dimensional construct? 2) Do relational value statements (including those strongly stated) resonate with diverse populations? 3) Do people respond to relational value statements in a consistently different way than NEP scale statements? Data for this work is drawn from an online panel of residents of northeastern US (n = 400), as well as a sample of Costa Rican farmers (n = 253) and tourists in Costa Rica (n = 260). Results indicate relational values are distinct as a construct when compared to the NEP."
https://openalex.org/W2751279829,"The availability of pollen in agricultural landscapes is essential for the successful growth and reproduction of honey bee colonies (Apis mellifera L.). The quantity and diversity of collected pollen can influence the growth and health of honey bee colonies, but little is known about the influence of landscape structure on pollen diet. In a field experiment, we rotated 16 honey bee colonies across 16 agricultural landscapes, used traps to collect samples of collected pollen and observed intra-colonial dance communication to gain information about foraging distances. DNA metabarcoding was applied to analyze mixed pollen samples. Neither the amount of collected pollen nor pollen diversity was related to landscape diversity. However, we found a strong seasonal variation in the amount and diversity of collected pollen in all sites independent of landscape diversity. The observed increase in foraging distances with decreasing landscape diversity suggests that honey bees compensated for lower landscape diversity by increasing their pollen foraging range in order to maintain pollen amount and diversity. Our results underscore the importance of a diverse pollen diet for honey bee colonies. Agri-environmental schemes aiming to support pollinators should focus on possible spatial and temporal gaps in pollen availability and diversity in agricultural landscapes."
https://openalex.org/W2750792525,"Objective To evaluate the use of ultrasound coupled with machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for automated or semi-automated classification of myositis. Methods Eighty subjects comprised of 19 with inclusion body myositis (IBM), 14 with polymyositis (PM), 14 with dermatomyositis (DM), and 33 normal (N) subjects were included in this study, where 3214 muscle ultrasound images of 7 muscles (observed bilaterally) were acquired. We considered three problems of classification including (A) normal vs. affected (DM, PM, IBM); (B) normal vs. IBM patients; and (C) IBM vs. other types of myositis (DM or PM). We studied the use of an automated DL method using deep convolutional neural networks (DL-DCNNs) for diagnostic classification and compared it with a semi-automated conventional ML method based on random forests (ML-RF) and “engineered” features. We used the known clinical diagnosis as the gold standard for evaluating performance of muscle classification. Results The performance of the DL-DCNN method resulted in accuracies ± standard deviation of 76.2% ± 3.1% for problem (A), 86.6% ± 2.4% for (B) and 74.8% ± 3.9% for (C), while the ML-RF method led to accuracies of 72.3% ± 3.3% for problem (A), 84.3% ± 2.3% for (B) and 68.9% ± 2.5% for (C). Conclusions This study demonstrates the application of machine learning methods for automatically or semi-automatically classifying inflammatory muscle disease using muscle ultrasound. Compared to the conventional random forest machine learning method used here, which has the drawback of requiring manual delineation of muscle/fat boundaries, DCNN-based classification by and large improved the accuracies in all classification problems while providing a fully automated approach to classification."
https://openalex.org/W2753074298,"Novel 2D Ti3C2Tx (MXene)-reinforced polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanofibers have been successfully fabricated by an electrospinning technique. The high aspect ratio, hydrophilic surfaces, and metallic conductivity of delaminated MXene nanosheet render it promising nanofiller for high performance nanocomposites. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) were used to improve the mechanical properties of the nanofibers. The obtained electrospun nanofibers had diameter from 174 to 194 nm depending on ratio between PVA, CNC and MXene. Dynamic mechanical analysis demonstrated an increase in the elastic modulus from 392 MPa for neat PVA fibers to 855 MPa for fibers containing CNC and MXene at 25°C. Moreover, PVA nanofibers containing 0.14 wt. % Ti3C2Tx exhibited dc conductivity of 0.8 mS/cm conductivity which is superior compared to similar composites prepared using methods other than electrospinning. Improved mechanical and electrical characteristics of the Ti3C2Tx /CNC/PVA composites make them viable materials for high performance energy applications."
https://openalex.org/W2751720941,"In developing countries, children under the age of five years who live in slums are highly vulnerable to diarrhea. However, there is a paucity of information on the relationship between sanitation facilities and hygienic conditions to acute diarrhea among under-five children in slum areas of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Therefore, this study examines the sanitation facilities and hygienic conditions in the slums of Addis Ababa and identifies the main factors significantly associated with acute diarrhea among children aged 0-50 months in those slums.A community-based cross-sectional household survey was carried out between September and November 2014, that then served as the baseline survey of a longitudinal study. For this survey, 697 children aged 0-50 months were recruited from two slum districts in Addis Ababa. A pre-tested structured questionnaire and an observational checklist were used for data collection. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify sanitation facilities and hygiene-related factors that were significantly associated with acute diarrhea by controlling potential confounding effects of selected socio-demographic factors. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to quantify the strength of association.The prevalence of acute diarrhea among children aged 0-50 months in the study area was 11.9% and 94.6% of the sanitation facilities were unimproved. Sharing of a sanitation facility by six or more households (AOR = 4.7; 95% CI: 2.4-9.4), proximity of sanitation facilities within 15 meters of homes (AOR = 6.6; 95% CI: 2.5-17.0), presence of feces (AOR = 3.9; 95% CI: 1.5-10.3) and flies (AOR = 2.5; 95% CI: 1.3-5.0) on the floor of and/or around sanitation facilities, and presence of uncollected garbage inside house compounds (AOR = 3.2; 95% CI: 1.2-8.4) were significantly associated with acute diarrhea.This study reveals the slum environment to be high risk for diarrhea due to close proximity of sanitation facilities to homes, sharing of sanitation facilities, and poor hygiene of the sanitation facilities and housing compounds. We recommend the development of a comprehensive diarrheal disease prevention program that focuses on improving the cleanliness of the sanitation facilities and housing compounds. Increasing the number of improved sanitation facilities at an appropriate distance from houses is also essential in order to reduce the number of households that share one latrine."
https://openalex.org/W2752707026,"Emergence of vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) strains has led to great concern in global public health in both developing and developed countries. This study investigated distribution and molecular characterization of VRSA strains in Tehran's hospitals using a combination of molecular typing methods.A total of 1789 S. aureus isolates obtained between 2014 and 2017 and were characterized using antibiogram, SCCmec typing, spa typing, and multilocus-sequence typing. Resistance to vancomycin was determined by E-test method. After confirmation of the isolated VRSA strain, genetic analysis was performed by evaluating vanA and vanB genes presence.The presence of resistance (ermA, ermB, ermC, mupA, msrA, msrB, tetM, ant (4΄)-Ia, aac (6΄)-Ie/aph (2˝), aph (3΄)-IIIa) and toxin (etb, eta, pvl, tst) encoding genes was investigated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique.Of all S. aureus tested isolates, four isolates were confirmed as VRSA isolates and two isolates confirmed as VISA isolates. ST5- SCCmec II/t002 and ST239-SCCmec III/t037 strains had MIC values of 512μg/ml, ST239-SCCmec III/t037 and ST8-SCCmecIV/t008 strains had MIC values of 64μg/ml and ST22-SCCmec IV/t790 and ST239-SCCmec III/t030 strains had MIC values ≥ 8 μg/ml. pvl-encoding gene was confirmed in ST8-SCCmecIV/t008 and ST22-SCCmec IV/t790 strains. The isolates differed in the carriage of resistance and toxin encoding genes.The study revealed the existence of VRSA strains in capital of Iran, Tehran. To our knowledge, this is the first report of ST239-SCCmec III/t037 as VRSA strain. These findings support the need for future surveillance studies on VRSA strains to keep the emergence and transmission of these isolates to a minimum."
https://openalex.org/W2753615940,"Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors are powerful tools to study cancer biology. However, the ability of PDX tumors to model the biological and histological diversity of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is not well known. In this study, we subcutaneously implanted 133 primary and metastatic PDAC tumors into immunodeficient mice. Fifty-seven tumors were successfully engrafted and even after extensive passaging, the histology of poorly-, moderately-, and well-differentiated tumors was maintained in the PDX models. Moreover, the fibroblast and collagen contents in the stroma of patient tumors were recapitulated in the corresponding PDX models. Analysis of the clinicopathological features of patients revealed xenograft tumor engraftment was associated with lymphovascular invasion (P = 0.001) and worse recurrence-free (median, 7 vs. 16 months, log-rank P = 0.047) and overall survival (median, 13 vs. 21 months, log-rank P = 0.038). Among successful engraftments, median time of growth required for reimplantation into new mice was 151 days. Reflective of the inherent biological diversity between PDX tumors with rapid (<151 days) and slow growth, differences in their growth were maintained during extensive passaging. Rapid growth was additionally associated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.022). The association of lymphovascular invasion and lymph node metastasis with PDX formation and rapid growth may reflect an underlying biological mechanism that allows these tumors to adapt and grow in a new environment. While the ability of PDX tumors to mimic the cellular and non-cellular features of the parental tumor stroma provides a valuable model to study the interaction of PDAC cells with the tumor microenvironment, the association of successful engraftment with adverse clinicopathological features suggests PDX models over represent more aggressive forms of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2461147385,"Homophily, the tendency of individuals to associate with others who share similar traits, has been identified as a major driving force in the formation and evolution of social ties. In many cases, it is not clear if homophily is the result of a socialization process, where individuals change their traits according to the dominance of that trait in their local social networks, or if it results from a selection process, in which individuals reshape their social networks so that their traits match those in the new environment. Here we demonstrate the detailed temporal formation of strong homophily in academic achievements of high school and university students. We analyze a unique dataset that contains information about the detailed time evolution of a friendship network of 6,000 students across 42 months. Combining the evolving social network data with the time series of the academic performance (GPA) of individual students, we show that academic homophily is a result of selection: students prefer to gradually reorganize their social networks according to their performance levels, rather than adapting their performance to the level of their local group. We find no signs for a pull effect, where a social environment of good performers motivates bad students to improve their performance. We are able to understand the underlying dynamics of grades and networks with a simple model. The lack of a social pull effect in classical educational settings could have important implications for the understanding of the observed persistence of segregation, inequality and social immobility in societies."
https://openalex.org/W2751053337,"Integrating sex and gender in health research is essential to produce the best possible evidence to inform health care. Comprehensive integration of sex and gender requires considering these variables from the very beginning of the research process, starting at the proposal stage. To promote excellence in sex and gender integration, we have developed a set of metrics to assess the quality of sex and gender integration in research proposals. These metrics are designed to assist both researchers in developing proposals and reviewers in making funding decisions. We developed this tool through an iterative three-stage method involving 1) review of existing sex and gender integration resources and initial metrics design, 2) expert review and feedback via anonymous online survey (Likert scale and open-ended questions), and 3) analysis of feedback data and collective revision of the metrics. We received feedback on the initial metrics draft from 20 reviewers with expertise in conducting sex- and/or gender-based health research. The majority of reviewers responded positively to questions regarding the utility, clarity and completeness of the metrics, and all reviewers provided responses to open-ended questions about suggestions for improvements. Coding and analysis of responses identified three domains for improvement: clarifying terminology, refining content, and broadening applicability. Based on this analysis we revised the metrics into the Essential Metrics for Assessing Sex and Gender Integration in Health Research Proposals Involving Human Participants, which outlines criteria for excellence within each proposal component and provides illustrative examples to support implementation. By enhancing the quality of sex and gender integration in proposals, the metrics will help to foster comprehensive, meaningful integration of sex and gender throughout each stage of the research process, resulting in better quality evidence to inform health care for all."
https://openalex.org/W2751942010,"The identification of metal ion binding sites is important for protein function annotation and the design of new drug molecules. This study presents an effective method of analyzing and identifying the binding residues of metal ions based solely on sequence information. Ten metal ions were extracted from the BioLip database: Zn2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Na+, K+ and Co2+. The analysis showed that Zn2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, and Co2+ were sensitive to the conservation of amino acids at binding sites, and promising results can be achieved using the Position Weight Scoring Matrix algorithm, with an accuracy of over 79.9% and a Matthews correlation coefficient of over 0.6. The binding sites of other metals can also be accurately identified using the Support Vector Machine algorithm with multifeature parameters as input. In addition, we found that Ca2+ was insensitive to hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity information and Mn2+ was insensitive to polarization charge information. An online server was constructed based on the framework of the proposed method and is freely available at http://60.31.198.140:8081/metal/HomePage/HomePage.html."
https://openalex.org/W2752692511,"Background Honokiol, a compound extracted from Magnolia officinalis, has antifungal activities by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and triggering apoptosis in Candida albicans. However, the mechanism of honokiol-induced oxidative stress is poorly understood. The present investigation was designed to determine the specific mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generation component. Methods/results We found that honokiol induced mitochondrial ROS accumulation, mainly superoxide anions (O2•−) measured by fluorescent staining method. The mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I (C I) inhibitor rotenone completely blocked O2•− production and provided the protection from the killing action of honokiol. Moreover, respiratory activity and the C I enzyme activity was significantly reduced after honokiol treatment. The differential gene-expression profile also showed that genes involved in oxidoreductase activity, electron transport, and oxidative phosphorylation were upregulated. Conclusions The present work shows that honokiol may bind to mitochondrial respiratory chain C I, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, accompanied by increased cellular superoxide anion and oxidative stress. General significance This work not only provides insights on the mechanism by which honokiol interferes with fungal cell, demonstrating previously unknown effects on mitochondrial physiology, but also raises a note of caution on the use of M. officinalis as a Chinese medicine due to the toxic for mitochondria and suggests the possibility of using honokiol as chemosensitizer."

The oldest closed system U/Th age comes from around 21 mm above the pelvis defining the terminus ante quem for the pelvis to 11311±370 y BP. However, the skeleton might be considerable older, probably as old as 13 ky BP as indicated by the speleothem stable isotope data.

https://openalex.org/W2751392054,"Signs, prompts, and symbols are a common means to change behavior in our society. Understanding the psychological mechanisms by which signage influences behavior is a critical first step to achieve the desired outcome. In the current research, we propose a theoretical model of sign-to-behavior process. The model suggests that when one encounters a sign, it is encoded to construct an action representation (comprehension process), which is then acted on unless its enactment is inhibited (decision process). We test the implications of the model in two studies. In support of our hypothesis, for unfamiliar signs, clarity of purpose predicts perceived effectiveness of a sign; however, for familiar signs, clarity of purpose does not matter. Insights gained from the studies will help to design effective signs. Practical implications of the model are discussed, and future research directions are outlined."
https://openalex.org/W2751608437,"Background Maternal and neonatal morbidities and mortalities have received much attention over the years in sub-Saharan Africa; yet addressing them remains a profound challenge, no more so than in the nation of Ghana. This study focuses on finding explanations to the conditions which lead to maternal and neonatal morbidities and mortalities in rural Ghana, particularly the Upper West Region. Method Mixed methods approach was adopted to investigate the medical and non-medical causes of maternal and neonatal morbidities and mortalities in two rural districts of the Upper West Region of Ghana. Survey questionnaires, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions were employed to collect data from: a) 80 expectant mothers (who were in their second and third trimesters, excluding those in their ninth month), b) 240 community residents and c) 13 healthcare providers (2 district directors of health services, 8 heads of health facilities and 3 nurses). Result Morbidity and mortality during pregnancy is attributed to direct causes such urinary tract infection (48%), hypertensive disorders (4%), mental health conditions (7%), nausea (4%) and indirect related sicknesses such as anaemia (11%), malaria, HIV/AIDS, oedema and hepatitis B (26%). Socioeconomic and cultural factors are identified as significant underlying causes of these complications and to morbidity and mortality during labour and the postnatal period. Birth asphyxia and traditional beliefs and practices were major causes of neonatal deaths. Conclusion These findings provide focused targets and open a window of opportunity for the community-based health services run by Ghana Health Service to intensify health education and promotion programmes directed at reducing risky economic activities and other cultural beliefs and practices affecting maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2751920678,"Food-related choices have an important impact on health. Food preparation methods may be linked to diet and health benefits. However, the factors influencing people’s food choices, and how they are shaped by food preparation experiences, are still not fully understood. We aimed to study home food preparation practices, experiences and perceptions amongst adults in North East England. A matrix was used to purposively sample participants with diverse socio-demographic characteristics. Participants developed photographic food diaries that were used as prompts during semi-structured interviews. Data were analysed using the Framework Method. Interviews were conducted with 18 adults (five men and 13 women), aged approximately 20 to 80 years, to reach data saturation. Participants’ practices varied widely, from reliance on pre-prepared foods, to preparing complex meals entirely from basic ingredients. Key themes emerged regarding the cook (identity), the task (process of cooking), and the context (situational drivers). Resources, in terms of time, money and facilities, were also underpinning influences on food preparation. Participants’ practices were determined by both personal motivations to cook, and the influence of others, and generally reflected compromises between varied competing demands and challenges in life. Most people appeared to be overall content with their food preparation behaviour, though ideally aspired to cook more frequently, using basic ingredients. This often seemed to be driven by social desirability. Home food preparation is complex, with heterogeneous practices, experiences and perceptions both between individuals and within the same individual over time, according to shifting priorities and circumstances. Generalisability of these findings may be limited by the regional participant sample; however the results support and build upon previous research. Focussing interventions on life transition points at which priorities and circumstances change, with careful targeting to stimulate personal motivation and social norms, may prove effective in encouraging home food preparation."
https://openalex.org/W2752207205,"Despite a large number of ecological studies that document diversity loss resulting from anthropogenic disturbance, surprisingly few consider how disturbance affects temporal patterns of diversity that result from seasonal turnover of species. Temporal dynamics can play an important role in the structure and function of biological assemblages. Here, we investigate the temporal diversity patterns of bee faunas in Southern California coastal sage scrub ecosystems that have been extensively fragmented by urbanization. Using a two-year dataset of 235 bee species (n = 12,036 specimens), we compared 1-ha plots in scrub fragments and scrub reserves with respect to three components of temporal diversity: overall plot-level diversity pooled over time (temporal gamma diversity), diversity at discrete points in time (temporal alpha diversity), and seasonal turnover in assemblage composition (temporal beta diversity). Compared to reserves, fragments harbored bee assemblages with lower species richness and assemblage evenness both when summed across temporal samples (i.e., lower temporal gamma diversity) and at single points in time (i.e., lower temporal alpha diversity). Bee assemblages in fragments also exhibited reduced seasonal turnover (i.e., lower temporal beta diversity). While fragments and reserves did not differ in overall bee abundance, bee abundance in fragments peaked later in the season compared to that in reserves. Our results argue for an increased awareness of temporal diversity patterns, as information about the distinct components of temporal diversity is essential both for characterizing the assemblage dynamics of seasonal organisms and for identifying potential impacts of anthropogenic disturbance on ecosystem function through its effects on assemblage dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2753577819,"With the rapid expansion of internet, the complex networks has become high-dimensional, sparse and redundant. Besides, the problem of link prediction in such networks has also obatined increasingly attention from different types of domains like information science, anthropology, sociology and computer sciences. It makes requirements for effective link prediction techniques to extract the most essential and relevant information for online users in internet. Therefore, this paper attempts to put forward a link prediction algorithm based on non-negative matrix factorization. In the algorithm, we reconstruct the correlation between different types of matrix through the projection of high-dimensional vector space to a low-dimensional one, and then use the similarity between the column vectors of the weight matrix as the scoring matrix. The experiment results demonstrate that the algorithm not only reduces data storage space but also effectively makes the improvements of the prediction performance during the process of sustaining a low time complexity."
https://openalex.org/W2750830688,"Hemicelluloses, such as xyloglucan, xylan and mannans, consist of a heterogeneous array of plant-derived polysaccharides that form the plant cell wall. These polysaccharides differ from each other in their structure and physiochemical properties, but they share a β-(1,4)-linked sugar backbone. Hemicelluloses can be hydrolyzed by plant-cell-wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs), which are widely distributed in phytopathogenic microbes. Recently, it has become apparent that phytophagous beetles also produce their own PCWDEs. Our previous work identified genes encoding putative mannanases belonging to the subfamily 10 of glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 5 (GH5_10) in the genomes of the leaf beetle, Gastrophysa viridula (Chrysomelidae, Chrysomelinae; one gene), and of the bean beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus (Chrysomelidae, Bruchinae; four genes). In contrast to proteins from other GH5 subfamilies, GH5_10 proteins are patchily distributed within the tree of life and have so far hardly been investigated. We addressed the following questions: Are beetle-derived GH5_10s active PCWDEs? How did they evolve? What is their physiological function? Using heterologous protein expression and enzymatic assays, we show that the G. viridula GH5_10 protein is an endo-β-1,4-mannanase. We also demonstrate that only one out of four C. maculatus GH5_10 proteins is an endo-β-1,4-mannanase, which has additional activity on carboxymethyl cellulose. Unexpectedly, another C. maculatus GH5_10 protein has evolved to use xylan instead of mannans as a substrate. RNAi experiments in G. viridula indicate (i) that the sole GH5_10 protein is responsible for breaking down mannans in the gut and (ii) that this breakdown may rather be accessory and may facilitate access to plant cell content, which is rich in nitrogen and simple sugars. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that coleopteran-derived GH5_10 proteins cluster together with Chelicerata-derived ones. Interestingly, other insect-derived GH5_10 proteins cluster elsewhere, suggesting insects have several independent evolutionary origins."
https://openalex.org/W2751060031,"Individual level response to natural and anthropogenic disturbance represents an increasingly important, but as yet little understood, component of animal behavior. Disturbance events often alter habitat, which in turn can modify behaviors of individuals in affected areas, including changes in habitat use and associated changes in social structure. To better understand these relationships, we investigated aspects of habitat selection and social connectivity of a small passerine bird, the red-backed fairywren (Malurus melanocephalus), before vs. after naturally occurring fire disturbance in Northern Territory, Australia. We utilized a social network framework to evaluate changes in social dynamics pre- vs. post-fire. Our study covered the non-breeding season in two consecutive years in which fires occurred, and individuals whose habitat was affected and those that were not affected by fire. Individuals in habitat affected by fires had stronger social ties (i.e. higher weighted degree) after fires, while those that were in areas that were not affected by fire actually had lower weighted degree. We suggest that this change in social connections may be linked to habitat. Before fires, fairywrens used habitat that had similar grass cover to available habitat plots randomly generated within our study site. Fire caused a reduction in grass cover, and fairywrens responded by selecting habitat with higher grass cover relative to random plots. This study demonstrates how changes in habitat and/or resource availability caused by disturbance can lead to substantive changes in the social environment that individuals experience."

In this study, we examined the therapeutic effects of TMSC in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model. TMSC were injected in DSS-induced colitis mice via intraperitoneal injection twice (TMSC[x2]) or four times (TMSC[x4]). Control mice were injected with either phosphate-buffered saline or human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Body weight, stool condition and disease activity index (DAI) were examined daily. Colon length, histologic grading, and mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-17 and tumor necrosis factor α, and anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10, IL-11 and IL-13, were also measured. Our results showed a significant improvement in survival rates and body weight gain in colitis mice injected with TMSC[x2] or TMSC[x4]. Injection with TMSC also significantly decreased DAI scores throughout the experimental period; at the end of experiment, almost complete reversal of DAI scores to normal was found in colitis mice treated with TMSC[x4]. Colon length was also significantly recovered in colitis mice treated with TMSC[x4]. However, histopathological alterations induced by DSS treatment were not apparently improved by injection with TMSC. Finally, treatment with TMSC[x4] significantly reversed the mRNA levels of IL-1β and IL-6, although expression of all pro-inflammatory cytokines tested was induced in colitis mice. Under our experimental conditions, however, no apparent alterations in the mRNA levels of all the anti-inflammatory cytokines tested were found. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that multiple injections with TMSC produced a therapeutic effect in a mouse model of DSS-induced colitis."
https://openalex.org/W2753479964,"Background After a subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), continuing impairment is common and may impact the person’s life. There is a lack of knowledge regarding long-term consequences experienced. Purpose To explore experiences of the care and rehabilitation as well as the consequences and strategies used to cope with everyday life six years post SAH. Methods An explorative interview study with a qualitative design. Individual interviews, with open ended questions, using an interview guide were performed with sixteen participants (mean age 63, 8 men, 8 women) six years post SAH. Data was analyzed according to a descriptive thematic analysis, and themes were discovered inductively. Results Two major themes from the analysis, both including four sub-themes, were identified; these themes were consequences of the SAH and coping strategies. Participants were grateful to have survived the SAH and most were satisfied with their acute medical care. If discharged directly from the neurosurgical unit participants can feel abandoned. In contrast, participants who were referred to a rehabilitation clinic felt supported and informed. Cognitive problems, such as impaired memory and mental fatigue, were reported as still present six years post SAH. Coping strategies were; receiving support from family, society, employers, or technical equipment. At work, talking to colleagues and to taking breaks were common. Participants described hiding their symptoms from employers and friends, as well as trying to continue doing tasks in the same manner as prior to the SAH. If this was not possible, some refrained from doing these tasks. They went through a mourning process, fear, and worries. Conclusions Participants reported several long-term consequences which impacted on their daily lives post SAH, and different coping strategies were used to cope with these problems. Participants reported lack of awareness regarding the consequences of SAH and stressed the importance of structured multidisciplinary follow-ups, which mostly is missing."
https://openalex.org/W2750804903,"Vaccines are arguably the most important means of pandemic influenza mitigation. However, as during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, mass immunization with an effective vaccine may not begin until a pandemic is well underway. In the U.S., state-level public health agencies are responsible for quickly and fairly allocating vaccines as they become available to populations prioritized to receive vaccines. Allocation decisions can be ethically and logistically complex, given several vaccine types in limited and uncertain supply and given competing priority groups with distinct risk profiles and vaccine acceptabilities. We introduce a model for optimizing statewide allocation of multiple vaccine types to multiple priority groups, maximizing equal access. We assume a large fraction of available vaccines are distributed to healthcare providers based on their requests, and then optimize county-level allocation of the remaining doses to achieve equity. We have applied the model to the state of Texas, and incorporated it in a Web-based decision-support tool for the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS). Based on vaccine quantities delivered to registered healthcare providers in response to their requests during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, we find that a relatively small cache of discretionary doses (DSHS reserved 6.8% in 2009) suffices to achieve equity across all counties in Texas."

Gastric Helicobacter pylori colonization leads to iron deficiency anemia (IDA), especially in children and adolescents. However the pathogenesis is poorly understood.


Objective 
We sought to identify specific H. pylori genes involved in IDA development, by comparing bacterial genome-wide expression profiling in patients affected or not.


Methods 
H. pylori were isolated from four children with IDA and four from matched controls without IDA. Based on these isolates, cDNA microarrays under iron-replete or depleted conditions were systematically performed to compare gene expression profiles at the whole genome level. Real-time reverse-transcription (RT-) PCR and protein assays were performed for further assessing the profile differentiation of the identified H. pylori IDA-associated genes.


Results 
We identified 29 and 11 genes with significantly higher or lower expression in the IDA isolates compared to non-IDA isolates, respectively. Especially notable were higher expression of sabA gene encoding sialic acid-binding adhesin in the IDA isolates, which was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR study. Moreover, iron-depletion in vitro led to up-regulation of fecA1 and frpB1 genes and down-regulation of pfr, as predicted. Known iron-regulated genes such as fur, pfr, fecA, and feoB did not significantly differ between both groups. The IDA isolates had significantly higher expression of vacuolating cytotoxin gene vacA than non-IDA isolates, consistent with the results of VacA protein assays. There were no significant differences in bacterial growth value between IDA and non-IDA isolates.


Conclusions 
It is likely that H. pylori carrying high expression of sabA causes IDA, especially in children and adolescents who have increased daily iron demand. In addition, it is possible that several host-interactive genes, including vacA, may play a synergistic role for sabA in IDA development."

While it has been demonstrated that hemocyanin from some mollusks can induce potent immune response and is therefore undergoing clinical trials to be used in anti-tumor immunotherapy, little is currently known about how hemocyanin from arthropods affect tumors. In this study we investigated the anti-tumor activity of hemocyanin from Litopenaeus vannamei on Sarcoma-180 (S180) tumor-bearing mice model. Eight days treatment with 4mg/kg bodyweight of hemocyanin significantly inhibited the growth of S180 up to 49% as compared to untreated. Similarly, histopathology analysis showed a significant decrease in tumor cell number and density in the tissues of treated mice. Moreover, there was a significant increase in immune organs index, lymphocyte proliferation, NK cell cytotoxic activity and serum TNF-α level, suggesting that hemocyanin could improve the immunity of the S180 tumor-bearing mice. Additionally, there was a significant increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and a decrease in the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) in serum and liver, which further suggest that hemocyanin improved the anti-oxidant ability of the S180 tumor-bearing mice. Collectively, our data demonstrated that L. vannamei hemocyanin had a significant antitumor activity in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2752384376,"Understanding collective behavior of moving organisms and how interactions between individuals govern their collective motion has triggered a growing number of studies. Similarities have been observed between the scale-free behavioral aspects of various systems (i.e. groups of fish, ants, and mammals). Investigation of such connections between the collective motion of non-human organisms and that of humans however, has been relatively scarce. The problem demands for particular attention in the context of emergency escape motion for which innovative experimentation with panicking ants has been recently employed as a relatively inexpensive and non-invasive approach. However, little empirical evidence has been provided as to the relevance and reliability of this approach as a model of human behaviour.This study explores pioneer experiments of emergency escape to tackle this question and to connect two forms of experimental observations that investigate the collective movement at macroscopic level. A large number of experiments with human and panicking ants are conducted representing the escape behavior of these systems in crowded spaces. The experiments share similar architectural structures in which two streams of crowd flow merge with one another. Measures such as discharge flow rates and the probability distribution of passage headways are extracted and compared between the two systems.Our findings displayed an unexpected degree of similarity between the collective patterns emerged from both observation types, particularly based on aggregate measures. Experiments with ants and humans commonly indicated how significantly the efficiency of motion and the rate of discharge depend on the architectural design of the movement environment.Our findings contribute to the accumulation of evidence needed to identify the boarders of applicability of experimentation with crowds of non-human entities as models of human collective motion as well as the level of measurements (i.e. macroscopic or microscopic) and the type of contexts at which reliable inferences can be drawn. This particularly has implications in the context of experimenting evacuation behaviour for which recruiting human subjects may face ethical restrictions. The findings, at minimum, offer promise as to the potential benefit of piloting such experiments with non-human crowds, thereby forming better-informed hypotheses."

This study compares detection rates, genotype distribution and viral loads of different enteric viral agents in HIV-1 seropositive (n = 200) and HIV-1 seronegative (n = 125) children hospitalized with DD in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Except for group A rotavirus (RVA), which were detected through enzyme immunoassay, the other enteric viruses (norovirus [NoV], astrovirus [HAstV], adenovirus [HAdV] and bocavirus [HBoV]) were detected through PCR or RT-PCR. A quantitative PCR was performed for RVA, NoV, HAstV, HAdV and HBoV. Infections with NoV (19% vs. 9.6%; p<0.001), HBoV (14% vs. 7.2%; p = 0.042) and HAdV (30.5% vs. 14.4%; p<0.001) were significantly more frequent among HIV-1 seropositive children. RVA was significantly less frequent among HIV-1 seropositive patients (6.5% vs. 20%; p<0.001). Similarly, frequency of infection with HAstV was lower among HIV-1 seropositive children (5.5% vs. 12.8%; p = 0.018). Among HIV-1 seropositive children 33 (16.5%) had co-infections, including three enteric viruses, such as NoV, HBoV and HAdV (n = 2) and NoV, HAstV and HAdV (n = 2). The frequency of infection with more than one virus was 17 (13.6%) in the HIV-1 negative group, triple infection (NoV + HAstV + HBoV) being observed in only one patient. The median viral load of HAstV in feces was significantly higher among HIV-1 positive children compared to HIV-1 negative children. Concerning children infected with RVA, NoV, HBoV and HAdV, no statistically significant differences were observed in the medians of viral loads in feces, comparing HIV-1 seropositive and HIV-1 seronegative children. Similar detection rates were observed for RVA, HAstV and HAdV, whilst NoV and HBoV were significantly more prevalent among children with CD4+ T lymphocyte count below 200 cells/mm3. Enteric viruses should be considered an important cause of DD in HIV-1 seropositive children, along with pathogens more classically associated with intestinal infections in immunocompromised hosts."

The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic role of PROX1 expression in gastric cancer.We evaluated PROX1 expression in gastric cancer by immunohistochemistry of tumor-tissue microarrays including tumor specimens from 283 patients who underwent surgery at Helsinki University Hospital. We investigated the association of PROX1 expression with clinicopathologic variables and patient survival.Cytoplasmic PROX1 reactivity was high in 56 (20.5%) and low in 217 (79.5%) cases. Low PROX1 immunostaining associated with diffuse cancer type (p = 0.002). In subgroup analysis, PROX1 was a significant marker of better prognosis in patients aged under 66 (p = 0.007), in those with intestinal cancer (p = 0.025), among men (p = 0.019), and in tumors of less than 5 cm diameter (p = 0.030). Patients with high PROX1 expression had a cancer-specific 5-year survival of 65.6% (95% CI 52.7-78.5), compared to 37.1% (95% CI 30.2-44.0) for those with low expression (p = 0.004, log-rank test). This result remained significant in multivariable analysis (HR = 0.56; 95% CI 0.35-0.90; p = 0.017).In gastric cancer, high cytoplasmic PROX1 expression is an independent marker of better prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2753824670,"Much of the literature on recovery focuses on the economy, the physical environment and infrastructure at a macro level, which may ignore the personal experiences of affected individuals during recovery. This paper combines internal factors at a micro level and external factors at a macro level to model for understanding perception of recovery (PoR). This study focuses on areas devastated by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China. With respect to three recovery-related aspects (house recovery condition (HRC), family recovery power (FRP) and reconstruction investment (RI)), structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied. It was found that the three aspects (FRP, HRC and RI) effectively explain how earthquake affected households perceive recovery. Internal factors associated with FRP contributed the most to favourable PoR, followed by external factors associated with HRC. Findings identified that for PoR the importance of active recovery within households outweighed an advantageous house recovery condition. At the same time, households trapped in unfavourable external conditions would invest more in housing recovery, which result in wealth accumulation and improved quality of life leading to a high level of PoR. In addition, schooling in households showed a negative effect on improving PoR. This research contributes to current debates around post-disaster permanent housing policy. It is implied that a one-size-fits-all policy in disaster recovery may not be effective and more specific assistance should be provided to those people in need."
https://openalex.org/W2751978798,"Background Dengue is a vector-borne disease transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. It is considered an important public health problem in many countries worldwide. However, only a few studies have been conducted on primates and domestic animals that could potentially be a reservoir of dengue viruses. Since domestic dogs share both habitats and vectors with humans, this study aimed to investigate whether domestic dogs living in different ecological settings in dengue endemic areas in Thailand could be naturally infected with dengue viruses. Methodology/Principal findings Serum samples were collected from domestic dogs in three different ecological settings of Thailand: urban dengue endemic areas of Nakhon Sawan Province; rubber plantation areas of Rayong Province; and Koh Chang, an island tourist spot of Trat Province. These samples were screened for dengue viral genome by using semi-nested RT-PCR. Positive samples were then inoculated in mosquito and dog cell lines for virus isolation. Supernatant collected from cell culture was tested for the presence of dengue viral genome by semi-nested RT-PCR, then double-strand DNA products were double-pass custom-sequenced. Partial nucleotide sequences were aligned with the sequences already recorded in GenBank, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed. In the urban setting, 632 domestic dog serum samples were screened for dengue virus genome by RT-PCR, and six samples (0.95%) tested positive for dengue virus. Four out of six dengue viruses from positive samples were successfully isolated. Dengue virus serotype 2 and serotype 3 were found to have circulated in domestic dog populations. One of 153 samples (0.65%) collected from the rubber plantation area showed a PCR-positive result, and dengue serotype 3 was successfully isolated. Partial gene phylogeny revealed that the isolated dengue viruses were closely related to those strains circulating in human populations. None of the 71 samples collected from the island tourist spot showed a positive result. Conclusions/Significance We concluded that domestic dogs can be infected with dengue virus strains circulating in dengue endemic areas. The role of domestic dogs in dengue transmission needs to be further investigated, i.e., whether they are potential reservoirs or incidental hosts of dengue viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2751344887,"We present a novel elastic network model, lmcENM, to determine protein motion even for localized functional motions that involve substantial changes in the protein's contact topology. Existing elastic network models assume that the contact topology remains unchanged throughout the motion and are thus most appropriate to simulate highly collective function-related movements. lmcENM uses machine learning to differentiate breaking from maintained contacts. We show that lmcENM accurately captures functional transitions unexplained by the classical ENM and three reference ENM variants, while preserving the simplicity of classical ENM. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a large set of proteins covering different motion types. Our results suggest that accurately predicting a ""deformation-invariant"" contact topology offers a promising route to increase the general applicability of ENMs. We also find that to correctly predict this contact topology a combination of several features seems to be relevant which may vary slightly depending on the protein. Additionally, we present case studies of two biologically interesting systems, Ferric Citrate membrane transporter FecA and Arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase."
https://openalex.org/W2752315098,"It is often a difficult task to accurately segment brain magnetic resonance (MR) images with intensity in-homogeneity and noise. This paper introduces a novel level set method for simultaneous brain MR image segmentation and intensity inhomogeneity correction. To reduce the effect of noise, novel anisotropic spatial information, which can preserve more details of edges and corners, is proposed by incorporating the inner relationships among the neighbor pixels. Then the proposed energy function uses the multivariate Student's t-distribution to fit the distribution of the intensities of each tissue. Furthermore, the proposed model utilizes Hidden Markov random fields to model the spatial correlation between neigh-boring pixels/voxels. The means of the multivariate Student's t-distribution can be adaptively estimated by multiplying a bias field to reduce the effect of intensity inhomogeneity. In the end, we reconstructed the energy function to be convex and calculated it by using the Split Bregman method, which allows our framework for random initialization, thereby allowing fully automated applications. Our method can obtain the final result in less than 1 second for 2D image with size 256 × 256 and less than 300 seconds for 3D image with size 256 × 256 × 171. The proposed method was compared to other state-of-the-art segmentation methods using both synthetic and clinical brain MR images and increased the accuracies of the results more than 3%."
https://openalex.org/W2752994671,"Mitotic prophase chromosome condensation plays an essential role in nuclear division being therefore regulated by highly conserved mechanisms. However, degrees of chromatin condensation in prophase-prometaphase cells may vary along the chromosomes resulting in specific condensation patterns. We examined different condensation patterns (CPs) of prophase and prometaphase chromosomes and investigated their relationship with genome size and distribution of histone H4 acetylated at lysine 5 (H4K5ac) in 17 plant species. Our results showed that most species with small genomes (2C < 5 pg) (Arachis pusilla, Bixa orellana, Costus spiralis, Eleutherine bulbosa, Indigofera campestris, Phaseolus lunatus, P. vulgaris, Poncirus trifoliata, and Solanum lycopersicum) displayed prophase chromosomes with late condensing terminal regions that were highly enriched in H4K5ac, and early condensing regions with apparently non-acetylated proximal chromatin. The species with large genomes (Allium cepa, Callisia repens, Araucaria angustifolia and Nothoscordum pulchellum) displayed uniformly condensed and acetylated prophase/prometaphase chromosomes. Three species with small genomes (Eleocharis geniculata, Rhynchospora pubera, and R. tenuis) displayed CP and H4K5ac labeling patterns similar to species with large genomes, whereas a forth species (Emilia sonchifolia) exhibited a gradual chromosome labeling, being more acetylated in the terminal regions and less acetylated in the proximal ones. The nucleolus organizer chromatin was the only chromosomal region that in prometaphase or metaphase could be hyperacetylated, hypoacetylated or non-acetylated, depending on the species. Our data indicate that the CP of a plant chromosome complement is influenced but not exclusively determined by nuclear and chromosomal DNA contents, whereas the CP of individual chromosomes is clearly correlated with H4K5ac distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2753847212,"Objective Investigate a combination of two clinically tested drugs, the NR2B antagonist Radiprodil and the A2A antagonist Tozadenant in the MPTP-treated marmoset model of Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Background In PD, there remains a need for the development of non-dopaminergic drugs to effectively treat the motor symptoms without the induction of L-Dopa-induced motor complications. Methods Clinically relevant doses of Radiprodil and Tozadenant were given both alone and in combination without the addition of L-Dopa, and the antiparkinsonian efficacy of the treatments was assessed in a primate model of PD. Results When compared to the drugs tested alone, the drug combination led to a significant increase of motor activity and an improvement of motor disability in MPTP-treated marmosets. In addition, the motor restoration brought about by the combination was almost completely devoid of dyskinesia. Interestingly, treated primates were not overstimulated, but were able to move normally when motivated by the exploration of novel objects. Conclusion We have demonstrated in a primate model that, the “Radiprodil/Tozadenant” combination significantly improves motor activity, extending previous results obtained in unilaterally lesioned 6-OHDA-rats. The strength of the preclinical data accumulated so far suggests that the use of such an A2A and NR2B antagonist combination could bring significant motor improvement to PD patients, without inducing the motor complications induced by L-Dopa therapy. Although encouraging, these preclinical data need to be confirmed in the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W4243845063,"Objective Tumor cells that escape local tissue control can convert inflammatory cells from tumor suppressors to tumor promoters. Moreover, soluble immune-modulating factors secreted from the tumor environment can be difficult to identify in patient serum due to their low abundance. We used an alternative strategy to infer a metastatic signature induced by sera of cervical cancer patients. Methods Sera from patients with local and metastatic cervical cancer were used to induce a disease-specific transcriptional signature in cultured, healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). An empirical Bayesian method, EBarrays, was used to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes with a target false discovery rate of <5%. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software was used to detect the top molecular and cellular functions associated with the DE genes. IPA and in silco analysis was used to pinpoint candidate upstream regulators, including cancer-related microRNAs (miRNAs). Results We identified enriched pathways in the metastatic cervical group related to immune surveillance functions, such as downregulation of engulfment, accumulation, and phagocytosis of hematopoietic cells. The predicted top upstream genes were IL-10 and immunoglobulins. In silco analysis identified miRNAs predicted to drive the transcriptional signature. Two of the 4 miRNAs (miR-23a-3p and miR-944) were validated in a cohort of women with local and metastatic cervical cancer. Conclusions This study supports the use of a cell-based assay that uses PBMC “reporters” to predict biologically relevant factors in patient serum. Further, disease-specific transcriptional signatures induced by patient sera have the potential to differentiate patients with local versus metastatic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2751560730,"Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been shown to increase long-term temporal stability of fish communities and enhance ecosystem resilience to anthropogenic disturbance. Yet, the potential ability of MPAs to buffer effects of environmental variability at shorter time scales remains widely unknown. In the tropics, the yearly monsoon cycle is a major natural force affecting marine organisms in tropical regions, and its timing and severity are predicted to change over the coming century, with potentially severe effects on marine organisms, ecosystems and ecosystem services. Here, we assessed the ability of MPAs to buffer effects of monsoon seasonality on seagrass-associated fish communities, using a field survey in two MPAs (no-take zones) and two unprotected (open-access) sites around Zanzibar (Tanzania). We assessed the temporal stability of fish density and community structure within and outside MPAs during three monsoon seasons in 2014–2015, and investigated several possible mechanisms that could regulate temporal stability. Our results show that MPAs did not affect fish density and diversity, but that juvenile fish densities were temporally more stable within MPAs. Second, fish community structure was more stable within MPAs for juvenile and adult fish, but not for subadult fish or the total fish community. Third, the observed effects may be due to a combination of direct and indirect (seagrass-mediated) effects of seasonality and, potentially, fluctuating fishing pressure outside MPAs. In summary, these MPAs may not have the ability to enhance fish density and diversity and to buffer effects of monsoon seasonality on the whole fish community. However, they may increase the temporal stability of certain groups, such as juvenile fish. Consequently, our results question whether MPAs play a general role in the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning under changing environmental conditions in tropical seagrass fish communities."
https://openalex.org/W2751694437,"Host innate immunity is one of the factors that determines the resistance of insects to their entomopathogens. In the research reported here we studied whether or not phenoloxidase (PO), a key enzyme in the melanogenesis component of humoral immunity of insects, plays a role in the protection of Lymantria dispar larvae from infection by L. dispar multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus. We studied two types of viral infection: overt and covert. The following lines of investigation were tested: i) the intravital individual estimation of baseline PO activity in haemolymph plasma followed by virus challenging; ii) the specific inhibition of PO activity in vivo by peroral treatment of infected larvae with phenylthiourea (PTU), a competitive inhibitor of PO; iii) the evaluation of PO activity in the haemolymph plasma after larval starvation. Starvation is a stress that activates the covert infection to an overt form. All of these experiments did not show a relationship between PO activity in haemolymph plasma of L. dispar larvae and larval susceptibility to baculovirus. Moreover, starvation-induced activation of covert viral infection to an overt form occurred in 70 percent of virus-carrying larvae against the background of a dramatic increase of PO activity in haemolymph plasma in the insects studied. Our conclusion is that in L. dispar larvae PO activity is not a predictor of host resistance to baculovirus."
https://openalex.org/W2751598803,"Alloreactive CD8+ T-cells mediate the curative graft-versus-leukaemia effect, the anti-viral immunity and graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Thus, immune reconstitution with CD8+ T-cells is critical for the outcome of patients after allogeneic SCT. Certain miRNAs such as miR-146a or miR-155 play an important role in the regulation of post-transplant immunity in mice. While some miRNAs e.g. miR-423 or miR-155 are regulated in plasma or full blood during acute GvHD also in man, the relevance and expression profile of miRNAs in T-cells after allogeneic SCT is unknown. miR-625-3p has recently been described to be overexpressed in colorectal malignancies where it promotes migration, invasion and apoptosis resistance. Since similar regulative functions in cancer and T-cells have been described for an increasing number of miRNAs, we assumed a role for the cancer-related miR-625-3p also in T-cells. Here, we studied miR-625-3p expression selectively in CD8+ T-cells both in vitro and during immune reconstitution after allogeneic SCT in man. T-cell receptor stimulation lead to miR-625-3p upregulation in human CD8+ T-cells in vitro. Maintenance of elevated miR-625-3p expression levels was dependent on ongoing T-cell proliferation and was abrogated by withdrawal of interleukin 2 or the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Finally, miR-625-3p expression was analyzed in human CD8+ T-cells purified from 137 peripheral blood samples longitudinally collected from 74 patients after allogeneic SCT. miR-625-3p expression was upregulated on day 25 and on day 45, i.e. during the early phase of CD8+ T-cell reconstitution after allogeneic SCT and subsequently declined with completion of CD8+ T-cell reconstitution until day 150. In conclusion, this study has shown for the first time that miR-625-3p is regulated in CD8+ T-cells during proliferation in vitro and during early immune reconstitution after allogeneic SCT in vivo. These results warrant further studies to identify the targets and function of miR-625-3p in CD8+ T-cells and to analyze its predictive value for an effective immune reconstitution."
https://openalex.org/W2752385323,"Our main aim was to elucidate the molecular mechanism responsible for the development and metastasis of colorectal cancer. Furthermore, we also identified the key genes participating in this molecular mechanism and stimulating the progression of colorectal cancer. In our experiment, the ANOS1 gene showed up-regulated expression levels continuously, whereas the methylation level showed downregulated levels when the colorectal cancer progressed through the four clinical stages of development and metastasis. We obtained this information by analyzing the expression profile data and methylation data of ANOS1 gene in colorectal cancer. This phenomenon indicates that ANOS1 gene shows continuous activation during the progression of colorectal cancer. According to the results of survival analysis, the expression of ANOS1 gene is closely related to the overall survival rate of patients (p = 0.003); moreover, the expression of ANOS1 gene is also strongly associated with the disease-specific survival rate (p = 0.001). When the expression of ANOS1 gene is high, the survival rate is low in patients. When the expression of ANOS1 gene is low, the survival rate of patients is high. To elucidate the possible molecular mechanism of ANOS1, we performed GSEA enrichment analysis based on the expression value of ANOS1 gene. We found that gene with an up-regulated expression was mainly involved in Wnt signaling pathway; these up-regulated genes were present in the group of high ANOS1 expression. Although several genes were involved in Wnt signaling pathway, CTHRC1 gene was of higher occurrence frequency. By co-expression analysis, we found that both expression value and expression extent of CTHRC1 were associated with ANOS1. All these results indicate that ANOS1 possibly promotes the activation of Wnt signaling pathway with its co-expression partner CTHRC1. Thus, ANOS1 and CTHRC1 genes promote the development and metastasis of colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2752742379,"The induction of Programmed Cell Death (PCD) requires the activation of complex responses involving the interplay of a variety of different cellular proteins, pathways, and processes. Uncovering the mechanisms regulating PCD requires an understanding of the different processes that both positively and negatively regulate cell death. Here we have examined the response of normal as well as PCD resistant yeast cells to different PCD inducing stresses. As expected cells expressing the pro-survival human 14-3-3β/α sequence show increased resistance to numerous stresses including copper and rapamycin. In contrast, other stresses including iron were more lethal in PCD resistant 14-3-3β/α expressing cells. The increased sensitivity to PCD was not iron and 14-3-3β/α specific since it was also observed with other stresses (hydroxyurea and zinc) and other pro-survival sequences (human TC-1 and H-ferritin). Although microscopical examination revealed little differences in morphology with iron or copper stresses, cells undergoing PCD in response to high levels of prolonged copper treatment were reduced in size. This supports the interaction some forms of PCD have with the mechanisms regulating cell growth. Analysis of iron-mediated effects in yeast mutant strains lacking key regulators suggests that a functional vacuole is required to mediate the synergistic effects of iron and 14-3-3β/α on yeast PCD. Finally, mild sub-lethal levels of copper were found to attenuate the observed inhibitory effects of iron. Taken together, we propose a model in which a subset of stresses like iron induces a complex process that requires the cross-talk of two different PCD inducing pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2753920933,"Objective The relationship of socioeconomic position with the use of health services may have changed with the emergence of the economic crisis. This study shows that relationship before and during the economic crisis, in Germany and in Spain. Methods Data from the 2006 and 2011 Socio-Economic Panel carried out in Germany, and from the 2006 and 2011 National Health Surveys carried out in Spain were used. The health services investigated were physician consultations and hospitalization. The measures of socioeconomic position used were education and household income. The magnitude of the relationship between socioeconomic position and the use of each health services was estimated by calculating the percentage ratio by binary regression. Results In Germany, in both periods, after adjusting for age, sex, type of health insurance and need for care, subjects belonging to the lower educational categories had a lower frequency of physician consultations, while those belonging to the lower income categories had a higher frequency of hospitalization. In the model comparing the two lower socioeconomic categories to the two higher categories, the percentage ratio for physician consultation by education was 0.97 (95%CI 0.96–0.98) in 2006 and 0.96 (95%CI 0.95–0.97) in 2011, and the percentage ratio for hospitalization by income was 1.14 (95%CI 1.05–1.25) in 2006 and 1.12 (95%CI 1.03–1.21) in 2011. In Spain, no significant socioeconomic differences were observed in either period in the frequency of use of these health services in the fully adjusted model. Conclusion The results suggest that the economic crisis did not alter accessibility to the health system in either country, given that the socioeconomic pattern in the use of these health services was similar before and during the crisis in both countries."
https://openalex.org/W2739662088,"Heterothermy, the ability to allow body temperature (Tb) to fluctuate, has been proposed as an adaptive mechanism that enables large ungulates to cope with the high environmental temperatures and lack of free water experienced in arid environments. By storing heat during the daytime and dissipating it during the night, arid-adapted ungulates may reduce evaporative water loss and conserve water. Adaptive heterothermy in large ungulates should be particularly pronounced in hot environments with severely limited access to free water. In the current study we investigated the effects of environmental temperature (ambient, Ta and soil, Ts) and water stress on the Tb of wild, free-ranging Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx) in two different sites in Saudi Arabia, Mahazat as-Sayd (MS) and Uruq Bani Ma’arid (UBM). Using implanted data loggers wet took continuous Tb readings every 10 minutes for an entire calendar year and determined the Tb amplitude as well as the heterothermy index (HI). Both differed significantly between sites but contrary to our expectations they were greater in MS despite its lower environmental temperatures and higher rainfall. This may be partially attributable to a higher activity in an unfamiliar environment for translocated animals in UBM. As expected Tb amplitude and HI were greatest during summer. Only minor sex differences were apparent that may be attributable to sex-specific investment into reproduction (e.g. male-male competition) during rut. Our results suggest that the degree of heterothermy is not only driven by extrinsic factors (e.g. environmental temperatures and water availability), but may also be affected by intrinsic factors (e.g. sex and/or behaviour)."
https://openalex.org/W2752449178,"This paper presents a modelling framework to evaluate travel delay of all vehicles influenced by moving bottlenecks on highways. During the derivation of analytical formulas, the arrival of slow vehicles was approximated by a Poisson process based on the assumption that they occupied a constant low proportion of the traffic stream. The mathematical analysis process was developed from moving bottlenecks with the same velocity to those with multiple different velocities, and the closed-form expression of expected average travel delay was obtained by utilizing kinematic-wave moving bottleneck theory, gap acceptance theory, probability theory and renewal theory. Model validation and parameters sensitive analysis were conducted by simulation relying on the open source database of US highway 10. The maximum passing rate and the macroscopic parameters of initial traffic state with maximum delay could be found by means of approximate formulas. The proposed modeling framework can be applied for evaluating impacts of slow vehicles on highway operation quantifiably, based on which traffic managements like truck prohibited period decision and speed or lane restriction could be made more scientifically."
https://openalex.org/W2751119865,"We evaluated the incidence of all-cause and malaria-specific clinic visits during follow-up of a recent trial of iron therapy. In the main trial, Ugandan children 6–59 months with smear-confirmed malaria and iron deficiency [zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP > = 80 μmol/mol heme)] were treated for malaria and randomized to start a 27-day course of oral iron concurrently with (immediate group) or 28 days after (delayed group) antimalarial treatment. All children were followed for the same 56-day period starting at the time of antimalarial treatment (Day 0) and underwent passive and active surveillance for malaria and other morbidity for the entire follow-up period. All ill children were examined and treated by the study physician. In this secondary analysis of morbidity data from the main trial, we report that although the incidence of malaria-specific visits did not differ between the groups, children in the immediate group had a higher incidence rate ratio of all-cause sick-child visits to the clinic during the follow-up period (Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) immediate/delayed = 1.76; 95%CI: 1.05–3.03, p = 0.033). Although these findings need to be tested in a larger trial powered for malaria-specific morbidity, these preliminary results suggest that delaying iron by 28 days in children with coexisting malaria and iron deficiency is associated with a reduced risk of subsequent all-cause illness."

Methods In this retrospective cohort study, the incidence of antenatal rubella seronegativity in our parturients managed in1997-2015 was analysed by their age from ≤16 to 25 years, and the effect of year of birth was determined adjusting for confounding factors including teenage status, obstetric history, anthropometric factors, and health parameters including anaemia, thalassaemia trait and hepatitis B carrier status. Results Among the 12743 gravidae, the 6103 gravidae born after 1983 had overall higher rubella seronegativity (9.1% versus 4.4%, OR 2.061, 95% CI 1.797–2.364), with significant difference (p = 0.006) and inverse correlation (p<0.001) with age, in contrast to the 6640 gravidae born in/before 1983 whom there was significant difference (p = 0.027) but a positive correlation (p = 0.008) with age. For each year of age, the former had significantly higher incidence of rubella seronegativity except for those of ≤16 years. Regression analysis confirmed that birth after 1983 was independently associated with rubella seronegativity (aOR 2.207, 95% CI 1.902–2.562). Conclusion There was a significant trend between rubella seronegativity with age in young gravidae, but the pattern was opposite between gravidae born after versus in/before 1983, with the former having a higher incidence of seronegativity at all ages. Young women covered by the two-dose rubella immunisation programme have a paradoxically higher incidence of rubella seronegativity."
https://openalex.org/W2752043293,"Lymphedema, a swelling of the extremity, is a debilitating morbidity of cancer treatment. Current clinical evaluation of lymphedema is often based on medical history and physical examinations, which is subjective. In this paper, the authors report an objective, quantitative 2D strain imaging approach using a hybrid deformable registration to measure soft-tissue stiffness and assess the severity of lymphedema.The authors have developed a new 2D strain imaging method using registration of pre- and post-compression ultrasound B-mode images, which combines the statistical intensity- and structure-based similarity measures using normalized mutual information (NMI) metric and normalized sum-of-squared-differences (NSSD), with an affine-based global and B-spline-based local transformation model. This 2D strain method was tested through a series of experiments using elastography phantom under various pressures. Clinical feasibility was tested with four participants: two patients with arm lymphedema following breast-cancer radiotherapy and two healthy volunteers.The phantom experiments have shown that the proposed registration-based strain method significantly increased the signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratio under various pressures as compared with the commonly used cross-correlation-based elastography method. In the pilot study, the strain images were successfully generated for all participants. The averaged strain values of the lymphedema affected arms were much higher than those of the normal arms.The authors have developed a deformable registration-based 2D strain method for the evaluation of arm lymphedema. The initial findings are encouraging and a large clinical study is warranted to further evaluate this 2D ultrasound strain imaging technology."

Previous studies have indicated that NAFLD has an adverse effect on the quality of life, but information is lacking about the impact of NAFLD on female sexual dysfunction. The aim of this study was to determine the association between NAFLD and female sexual dysfunction in premenopausal women.This retrospective study consisted of premenopausal women who were sexually active and visited the outpatient clinic for a routine health check-up between January 2010 and December 2011. Based on the examination of the liver ultrasound scan, the study population was divided into 2 groups: cases with NAFLD and normal controls (cases without NAFLD). The female sexual function was compared between the two groups of cases. For the assessment of sexual function, a female sexual function index (FSFI) questionnaire was used.Four hundred seventy women were included, and the prevalence of NAFLD and female sexual dysfunction were 67/470 (14.3%) and 238/470 (50.6%), respectively. Cases with NAFLD had a lower total FSFI score and higher rate of female sexual dysfunction than the normal control [median score of total FSFI (interquartile range): 24.7 (21.9-27.8) in NAFLD vs. 26.7 (23.7-29.8) in normal control, p<0.005; the female sexual dysfunction: 64.2% in NAFLD vs. 48.4% in normal control, p<0.05]. This difference in female sexual dysfunction between the two groups remained significant after adjustment.NAFLD is associated with female sexual dysfunction in premenopausal women."
https://openalex.org/W2750996516,"Aphid species feeding on lettuce occupy distinct feeding sites: the lettuce aphid Nasonovia ribisnigri prefers to feed on heart leaves, whereas the potato aphid Macrosiphum euphorbiae feeds only on outer leaves. The aphid parasitoid Aphelinus abdominalis, known to be able to regulate M. euphorbiae on many crops, has recently been indicated as a promising biocontrol candidate also for use against N. ribisnigri, a major pest of lettuce. This study therefore examined A. abdominalis parasitization preference between N. ribisnigri and M. euphorbiae and its ability to parasitize aphids feeding on different parts of lettuce plants. In addition, life history traits of A. abdominalis on these aphid species were investigated. In no-choice laboratory experiments on leaf discs and 24 h exposure, A. abdominalis successfully parasitized 54% and 60% of the offered N. ribisnigri and M. euphorbiae, respectively, with no significant difference. In the corresponding choice experiment, however, A. abdominalis had a tendency for a significantly higher preference for M. euphorbiae (38%) compared to N. ribisnigri (30%). Growth chamber experiments on whole plants demonstrated that A. abdominalis was able to parasitize aphids, regardless of their feeding locations on lettuce plants. However, aphid feeding behavior had a significant effect on the parasitization rate. A. abdominalis parasitized significantly higher percentages of M. euphorbiae or N. ribisnigri when aphids were exposed separately to parasitoids on whole lettuce plants as compared with N. ribisnigri exposed only on heart leaf. A significant preference of A. abdominalis for M. euphorbiae compared to N. ribisnigri was also observed in the growth chamber choice experiment. A high percentage of adult emergence (> 84%) and female-biased sex ratio (> 83%) were found irrespective of the aphid species."
https://openalex.org/W2752035300,"To generate and evaluate an indicator of the health system's performance in the area of maternal and reproductive health in Colombia.An indicator was constructed based on variables related to the coverage and utilization of healthcare services for pregnant and reproductive-age women. A factor analysis was performed using a polychoric correlation matrix and the states were classified according to the indicator's score. A path analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between the indicator and social determinants, with the maternal mortality ratio as the response variable.The factor analysis indicates that only one principal factor exists, namely ""coverage and utilization of maternal healthcare services"" (eigenvalue 4.35). The indicator performed best in the states of Atlantic, Bogota, Boyaca, Cundinamarca, Huila, Risaralda and Santander (Q4). The poorest performance (Q1) occurred in Caqueta, Choco, La Guajira, Vichada, Guainia, Amazonas and Vaupes. The indicator's behavior was found to have an association with the unsatisfied basic needs index and women's education (β = -0.021; 95%CI -0031 to -0.01 and β 0.554; 95%CI 0.39 to 0.72, respectively). According to the path analysis, an inverse relationship exists between the proposed indicator and the behavior of the maternal mortality ratio (β = -49.34; 95%CI -77.7 to -20.9); performance was a mediating variable.The performance of the health system with respect to its management of access and coverage for maternal and reproductive health appears to function as a mediating variable between social determinants and maternal mortality in Colombia."
