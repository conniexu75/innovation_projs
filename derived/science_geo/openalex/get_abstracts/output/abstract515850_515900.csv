Using a data set on the past and current status of brown bears ( Ursus arctos ), Eurasian lynx ( Lynx lynx ), gray wolves ( Canis lupus ), and wolverines ( Gulo gulo ) in European countries, we show that roughly one-third of mainland Europe hosts at least one large carnivore species, with stable or increasing abundance in most cases in 21st-century records. The reasons for this overall conservation success include protective legislation, supportive public opinion, and a variety of practices making coexistence between large carnivores and people possible. The European situation reveals that large carnivores and people can share the same landscape."

Using vibrational Stark effect spectroscopy, we found that the active site of the enzyme ketosteroid isomerase (KSI) exerts an extremely large electric field onto the C=O chemical bond that undergoes a charge rearrangement in KSI’s rate-determining step. Moreover, we found that the magnitude of the electric field exerted by the active site strongly correlates with the enzyme’s catalytic rate enhancement, enabling us to quantify the fraction of the catalytic effect that is electrostatic in origin. The measurements described here may help explain the role of electrostatics in many other enzymes and biomolecular systems."

The role of the H3.3K27M mutation in tumorigenesis is not fully understood. Here, we use a human embryonic stem cell system to model this tumor. We show that H3.3K27M expression synergizes with p53 loss and PDGFRA activation in neural progenitor cells derived from human embryonic stem cells, resulting in neoplastic transformation. Genome-wide analyses indicate a resetting of the transformed precursors to a developmentally more primitive stem cell state, with evidence of major modifications of histone marks at several master regulator genes. Drug screening assays identified a compound targeting the protein menin as an inhibitor of tumor cell growth in vitro and in mice."

Although much is known about the principal growth mechanisms of monometallic shaped nanocrystals, the anisotropic growth of shaped alloy nanocrystals is still poorly understood. Using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, we reveal an element-specific anisotropic growth mechanism of platinum (Pt) bimetallic nano-octahedra where compositional anisotropy couples to geometric anisotropy. A Pt-rich phase evolves into precursor nanohexapods, followed by a slower step-induced deposition of an M-rich (M = Ni, Co, etc.) phase at the concave hexapod surface forming the octahedral facets. Our finding explains earlier reports on unusual compositional segregations and chemical degradation pathways of bimetallic polyhedral catalysts and may aid rational synthesis of shaped alloy catalysts with desired compositional patterns and properties."

Here, we report the design of a membrane-spanning, four-helical bundle that transports first-row transition metal ions Zn 2+ and Co 2+ , but not Ca 2+ , across membranes. The conduction path was designed to contain two di-metal binding sites that bind with negative cooperativity. X-ray crystallography and solid-state and solution nuclear magnetic resonance indicate that the overall helical bundle is formed from two tightly interacting pairs of helices, which form individual domains that interact weakly along a more dynamic interface. Vesicle flux experiments show that as Zn 2+ ions diffuse down their concentration gradients, protons are antiported. These experiments illustrate the feasibility of designing membrane proteins with predefined structural and dynamic properties."

Here we report an artificial metallo-β-lactamase, constructed via the self-assembly of a structurally and functionally unrelated, monomeric redox protein into a tetrameric assembly that possesses catalytic zinc sites in its interfaces. The designed metallo-β-lactamase is functional in the Escherichia coli periplasm and enables the bacteria to survive treatment with ampicillin. In vivo screening of libraries has yielded a variant that displays a catalytic proficiency [( k cat / K m )/ k uncat ] for ampicillin hydrolysis of 2.3 × 10 6 and features the emergence of a highly mobile loop near the active site, a key component of natural β-lactamases to enable substrate interactions."

We constructed a set of promoters in Escherichia coli in which promoter strength, transcription factor binding strength, and transcription factor copy numbers are systematically varied, and used messenger RNA (mRNA) fluorescence in situ hybridization to observe how these changes affected variability in gene expression. Our parameter-free models predicted the observed variability; hence, the molecular details of transcription dictate variability in mRNA expression, and transcriptional noise is specifically tunable and thus represents an evolutionarily accessible phenotypic parameter."

Using an ultrafast electronic-vibrational-vibrational pulse-sequence, we demonstrate how the outcome of light-induced ET can be radically altered by mode-specific infrared (IR) excitation of vibrations that are coupled to the ET pathway. Picosecond narrow-band IR excitation of high-frequency bridge vibrations in an electronically excited covalent trans -acetylide platinum(II) donor-bridge-acceptor system in solution alters both the dynamics and the yields of competing ET pathways, completely switching a charge separation pathway off.

Here, we show that T reg cells can render self-reactive human CD8 + T cells anergic (i.e., hypoproliferative and cytokine hypoproducing upon antigen restimulation) in vitro, likely by controlling the costimulatory function of antigen-presenting cells. Anergic T cells were naïve in phenotype, lower than activated T cells in T cell receptor affinity for cognate antigen, and expressed several coinhibitory molecules, including cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4). Using these criteria, we detected in healthy individuals anergic T cells reactive with a skin antigen targeted in the autoimmune disease vitiligo. Collectively, our results suggest that T reg cell–mediated induction of anergy in autoimmune T cells is important for maintaining self-tolerance."

https://openalex.org/W2140038854,"Introduction Evolution and design of protein complexes are frequently viewed through the lens of amino acid mutations at protein interfaces, but we showed previously that residues distant from interfaces are also commonly involved in the evolution of alternative quaternary structures. We hypothesized that in these protein families, the difference in oligomeric state is due to a change in intersubunit geometry. The indirect mutations would act by changing protein conformation and dynamics, similar to the way in which allosteric small molecules introduce functional conformational change. We refer to these substitutions as “allosteric mutations.” Rationale In this work, we investigate the mechanism of action of allosteric mutations on oligomeric state in the PyrR family of pyrimidine operon attenuators. In this family, an entirely sequence-conserved helix that forms a tetrameric interface in the thermophilic ortholog (BcPyrR) switches to being solvent-exposed in the mesophilic ortholog (BsPyrR). This results in a homodimeric structure in which the two subunits are clearly rotated relative to their orientation in the tetramer. What is the origin of this rotation and the change in quaternary structure? To dissect the role of the 49 substitutions between BsPyrR and BcPyrR, we used ancestral sequence reconstruction in combination with structural and biophysical methods to identify a set of allosteric mutations that are responsible for this shift in conformation. We compared the conformational changes introduced by the mutations to the protein motion during allosteric regulation by guanosine monophosphate (GMP). Results We identified 11 key mutations controlling oligomeric state, all distant from the interfaces and outside ligand-binding pockets. We confirmed the role of these allosteric mutations by engineering a shift in oligomeric state in an inferred ancestral PyrR protein (intermediate in sequence between the extant orthologs). We further used the inferred ancestral states and their mutants to show that the allosteric mutations are part of a downhill adaptation of the PyrR proteins to lower temperatures. We compared the x-ray crystal structures of ancestral and engineered PyrR proteins to the free and GMP-bound structure of the mesophilic BsPyrR, which shifts its equilibrium from dimer to tetramer upon ligand binding. Binding of the allosteric molecule introduces a change in intersubunit geometry that is equivalent to the evolutionary difference in intersubunit geometry between the dimeric and tetrameric homologs. We further find that the difference in oligomeric state is coupled to the difference in intrinsic dynamics of the dimers. Finally, we used the residue-residue contact network approach to show that the residues corresponding to the allosteric mutations undergo large contact rewiring when the intersubunit geometry and, in turn, oligomeric state change, either by GMP binding or by the introduction of allosteric mutations. Conclusion We show that evolution employs the intrinsic dynamics of this protein to toggle a conformational switch in a manner similar to that of small molecules. Shifting the relative populations of different states by subtle modifications is a process central to protein function and, as shown here, also to protein evolution. This suggests that we can learn from evolution and design proteins with multiple conformational states."

To elucidate the cause of these changes, e.g. trimer-trimer contacts or surfactant-induced structural perturbations, we compared the CD spectra and fluorescence kinetics of LHCII aggregates, artificial and native LHCII-lipid membranes, and LHCII solubilized in different detergents or trapped in polymer gel. By this means we were able to identify CD spectral changes specific to LHCII-LHCII interactions, at (−)-437 and (+)-484 nm, and changes specific to the interaction with the detergent n-dodecyl-β-maltoside (β-DM) or membrane lipids, at (+)-447 and (−)-494 nm. The latter change is attributed to the conformational change of the LHCII-bound carotenoid neoxanthin, by analyzing the CD spectra of neoxanthin-deficient plant thylakoid membranes. The neoxanthin-specific band at (−)-494 nm was not pronounced in LHCII in detergent-free gels or solubilized in the α isomer of DM but was present when LHCII was reconstituted in membranes composed of phosphatidylcholine or plant thylakoid lipids, indicating that the conformation of neoxanthin is sensitive to the molecular environment. Neither the aggregation-specific CD bands, nor the surfactant-specific bands were positively associated with the onset of fluorescence quenching, which could be triggered without invoking such spectral changes. Significant quenching was not active in reconstituted LHCII proteoliposomes, whereas a high degree of energetic connectivity, depending on the lipid:protein ratio, in these membranes allows for efficient light harvesting.

Southern Ocean sediments reveal a spike in authigenic uranium 127,000 years ago, within the last interglacial, reflecting decreased oxygenation of deep water by Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). Unlike ice age reductions in AABW, the interglacial stagnation event appears decoupled from open ocean conditions and may have resulted from coastal freshening due to mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet. AABW reduction coincided with increased North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) formation, and the subsequent reinvigoration in AABW coincided with reduced NADW formation. Thus, alternation of deep water formation between the Antarctic and the North Atlantic, believed to characterize ice ages, apparently also occurs in warm climates."

PFTs perturb the plasma membrane integrity to disrupt ion homeostasis of the host cell or to facilitate the entry of toxic components. They are secreted as soluble proteins and adopt a membrane-inserted conformation on the target membrane. Importantly, toxin oligomerization seems to be a general prerequisite for pore formation. According to the α-helical or β-sheet structure of the membrane-integrated domains, they are classified as α-PFTs or β-PFTs, respectively. The best studied pores are those formed by β-barrels, like α-hemolysin (3.Song L. Hobaugh M.R. Shustak C. Cheley S. Bayley H. Gouaux J.E.

One problem is that most studies with PFTs have been performed under equilibrium conditions using artificial lipid bilayers. The stoichiometry and assembly mechanism of PFTs in the natural context of the target host membrane, as well as the dynamic nature of the oligomerization process leading to cell death, remain largely unexplored. Here, we visualized individual, fluorescently labeled EqtII molecules on the plasma membrane of living cells by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy (16.Schmidt T. Schütz G.J.

We found that in cells EqtII exists in a dynamic equilibrium of multiple oligomeric species including significant populations of monomers, dimers, tetramers, and hexamers. Based on our experimental data and on mathematical analysis of the temporal distribution of species, a new model is proposed by which EqtII assembly proceeds via sequential condensation of dimers formed by the association of toxin monomers on the cell surface. Interestingly, a mutant version of EqtII with lowered hemolytic activity followed a distinct oligomerization pathway, which demonstrates the functional relevance of the molecular steps involved in toxin assembly. In contrast to previous models, our data suggest a toxic mechanism by which membrane permeabilization would be simultaneously induced by oligomers of variable stoichiometry. eqtII gene, introduced in the pET21a+ expression plasmid, was purchased from Entelchon (Bad Abbach, Germany). The EqtII-R126C single mutant was obtained by replacing the corresponding residue by Cys. EqtII wild type and EqtII-R126C were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-RIPL cells and purified by combining cation-exchange chromatography in SP-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) and gel filtration chromatography in a Superdex 200 HP column (GE Healthcare). The single cysteine mutant of EqtII-L26C, provided by G. Anderluh, was obtained and purified as described in Malovrh et al. (27.Malovrh P. Viero G. Serra M.D. Podlesek Z. Lakey J.H. Macek P.

The separation of the labeled protein from excess free dye was achieved with a 10DG gel filtration column (Bio-Rad). Labeling efficiency was determined to be 76% (EqtII-R126C) or 86% (EqtII-L26C) by fluorescence spectroscopy with a Specord S100 (Analytik Jena, Jena, Germany). The hemolytical activity of wild type EqtII, mutants, and labeled proteins was assessed turbidimetrically at 600 nm by using a microplate reader (Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany). A erythrocyte suspension was prepared using pooled fresh human red blood cells collected intravenously from at least four healthy volunteers. Cells were washed by repeated centrifugation (14,000 × g, 5 min), the cell pellet was resuspended in Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 145 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and finally diluted to an apparent absorbance of 0.1. Proteins were 2-fold serially diluted in a flat-bottom 96-well microplates in a final volume of 100 μl of TBS. The hemolysis reaction was started by adding the same volume of red blood cells. Hemolysis was recorded for 10 min with intermittent shaking. The hemolytic activity (HA) was calculated after 5 min as a function of protein concentration as follows:HA5min(%)A0−AtA0−Apt×100(Eq 1) where At, A0, and Apt represent the absorbance at 5 min, at time 0, and in the presence of an excess of protein, respectively. COS1 cells were cultured in DMEM (high glucose; Sigma) with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) at 37 °C and in the presence of 5% CO2. All cells were regularly passaged at subconfluence and plated at 2–5 × 104 cells/ml density. For imaging experiments, the cells were seeded in LabTek chambers (Nunc). Experiments were carried out 24 or 48 h after seeding. Single molecule images were acquired using a total internal reflection microscope equipped with an EMCCD camera (Andor iXon3 DU-897), a Nikon Apo TIRF ×60 oil immersion objective (NA 1.49), and a 561-nm diode laser. The cells were maintained at 37 °C during the whole experiment and imaged in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 20 mm trehalose, 15 mm glucose, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.9 mm MgSO4, and 0.5 mm CaCl2. After single cells were selected and focused using bright field, fluorescently labeled EqtII was added. Movies were acquired with an exposure time of 200 ms at different times after toxin addition. Particles were detected and tracked using the u-track software (18.Jaqaman K. Loerke D. Mettlen M. Kuwata H. Grinstein S. Schmid S.L. Danuser G. Robust single-particle tracking in live-cell time-lapse sequences.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). The detection parameters used were as follows: psf σ-2.5, integration window-3, and αLocMax-0.2. Tracking was constrained to the particles that were present in at least 10 consecutive frames. The particles detected and tracked were subjected to further analysis using Matlab (Mathworks) and Origin8.5. For each particle trajectory, the two-dimensional mean square displacement (MSD) for every time interval was calculated according to Refs. 19.Kusumi A. Sako Y. Yamamoto M.

The diffusion coefficient was calculated by fitting the data of MSD versus time lag (Δt) to diffusion models. In case of simple two-dimensional Brownian motion, the MSD is related to the diffusion coefficient D by,MSD(Δt)=4DΔt(Eq 3) and for subdiffusion the relationship is given by,MSD(Δt)=〈rc2〉[1−A1exp(−4A2Dt/〈rc2〉)](Eq 4) where rc2 is the confinement size, and A1 and A2 are constants determined by the confined geometry (22.Saxton M.J. Jacobson K. Single-particle tracking: applications to membrane dynamics.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 373-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar). To calibrate the fluorescence signal in the TIRF microscope, we acquired movies of single Alexa 488 or Alexa 555 molecules dried on a coverslip under the same conditions as in the cell experiments. The decrease in fluorescence intensity of single photobleaching steps (n = 25) (Fig. 4, B and C) followed a normal distribution and was fitted with a Gaussian curve that provided the average fluorescence signal of one Alexa 488 or Alexa 555 molecule and the error of the estimation. This value was comparable with that obtained in similar experiments using EqtII labeled with Alexa 488 or Alexa 555 (EqtII-Al488, Eqt-L26C-Al555) dried on a coverslip or in lipid bilayers. Movies were acquired under the same conditions used for cells until all the particles were photobleached. Because EqtII does not diffuse in the lipid bilayers, we observed mostly monomers. Monomer value was used to calculate the fluorescence signal corresponding to dimers, trimers, tetramers, etc. (Fig. 4C) (16.Schmidt T. Schütz G.J. Gruber H.J. Schindler H. Local stoichiometries determined by counting individual molecules.Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 4397-4401Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The calibration was repeated prior to every experiment to avoid artifacts due to changes in the microscope setup. Moreover, the brightness of the least bright particle imaged from cells was also comparable. The individual particles were detected and the fluorescence intensity of each particle was estimated by fitting a two-dimensional Gaussian and averaging from the beginning of the movie until they are photobleached (Fig. 4, A and B). By fitting a Gaussian curve to the distribution of fluorescence intensities, the mean intensity μ and standard deviation σ of a single fluorophore was calculated. With μ and σ, the fluorescence intensity of N colocalized fluorophores can be given by μN = Nμ1 ± N1/2 σ1 (Fig. 4C). The number of Gaussians that can be fitted to the distribution of fluorescence intensity was estimated according to Ref. 16.Schmidt T. Schütz G.J. Gruber H.J. Schindler H. Local stoichiometries determined by counting individual molecules.Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 4397-4401Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar and,Nmax=(μ1/σ1)2(Eq 5) Nmax is 4 for our data, so we restricted our fittings to four species in EqtII-L26C-Al555 and calculated the corresponding μ and σ values. In the case of EqtII-Al488 we fitted up to hexamers, but only four species were detected after labeling correction. For determining the stoichiometry of EqtI, ∼500 individual particles were detected and analyzed for each time point. As the fluorescence signal of the different species is expected to be the same at all measured times, the distribution of the fluorescence intensity of all the particles at all time points was globally fitted with a sum of four Gaussians using obtained μ and σ values. The Gaussian model used for the fit is given by,φ(i)=∑n=1NmaxAn×1σ2πe−(i−μ⋅n)22(σ⋅n)2(Eq 6) where ϕ(i) is the frequency of particles having intensity i, n is the component number, and An is the area under the curve of component n. The area A under the curve of each component was used to estimate the percentage of occurrence of each species and at each time point as described in Ref. 23.Calebiro D. Rieken F. Wagner J.

U.S.A. 2013; 110: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar. All percentage values mentioned here were corrected considering that 76% of the protein is fluorescent. We modeled the kinetics of EqtII oligomerization with a simple model based on mass action kinetics. The system is represented by a set of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with reaction rate constants used as fitting parameters. Numerical integration and fitting was performed in COPASI 4.11 (24.Hoops S. Sahle S. Gauges R. Lee C. Pahle J. Simus N. Singhal M. Xu L. Mendes P. Kummer U. COPASI: a COmplex PAthway SImulator.Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 3067-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar). We estimated the total area concentration of EqtII molecules on the cell surface by counting all the individual particles in a cell, taking into account the stoichiometry of each particle and dividing by the observed membrane area. In the best fit for EqtII-Al488, we obtained a sum of squared residuals of 1.7 × 10−5 [particles/μm2]2 (1.1 × 10–3 [particles/μm2]2 for EqtII-L26C-Al555). This corresponds to an averaged uncertainty of 1.2 × 10–3 particles/μm2 (8.3 × 10–3 particles/μm2 for EqtII-L26C-Al555) for each concentration curve. The model for EqtII-Al488 is represented by 4 coupled ODEs originating from mass action kinetics.dx1dt=−2k1x12+2k−1x2(Eq 7) dxdt=k1x12−k−1x2−2k2x22+2k−2x4−k3x2x4+k−3x6(Eq 8) dx4dt=k2x22−k−2x4−k3x2x4+k−3x6(Eq 9) dx6dt=k3x2x4−k−3x6(Eq 10) The ODEs for EqtII-L26C-Al555 are,dx1dt=−2k1x12+2k−1x2−k2x1x2+k−2x3−k3x1x3+k−3x4(Eq 11) dx2dt=k1x12−k−1x2−k2x1x2+k−2x3−2k4x22+2k−4x4(Eq 12) dx3dt=k2x1x2−k−2x3−k3x1x3+k−3x4(Eq 13) dx4dt=k3x1x3−k−3x4+k4x22−k−4x4(Eq 14) χi stands for the concentration of species i (monomers, dimers, trimers, and tetramers). In this model, the total number of monomeric EqtII molecules is conserved. For single molecule tracking studies we produced EqtII single cysteine mutants, as wild type EqtII does not possess any Cys. This is essential to know exactly the amount of fluorophores we have per protein molecule. We replaced a single residue at positions 26 or 126 by Cys to obtain two mutants with different activities. Position 126 is located near the C terminus, which is distant from the regions of the proteins involved in membrane binding or pore formation (7.Hong Q. Gutierrez-Aguirre I. Barlic A. Malovrh P. Kristan K. Podlesek Z. Macek P. Turk D. Gonzalez-Manas J.M. Lakey J.H. Anderluh G.

Neither the mutation nor the labeling at position 126 affected protein activity (Fig. 1) as described previously by Anderluh and co-workers (25.Anderluh G. Barlic A. Krizaj I. Menestrina G. Gubensěk F. Macek P. Avidin-FITC topological studies with three cysteine mutants of equinatoxin II, a sea anemone pore-forming protein.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Conversely, mutation at position 26 is located in the N-terminal α-helix, which directly participates in pore formation (8.Kristan K. Podlesek Z. Hojnik V. Gutiérrez-Aguirre I. Guncar G. Turk D. González-Mañas J.M. Lakey J.H. Macek P. Anderluh G. Pore formation by equinatoxin, a eukaryotic pore-forming toxin, requires a flexible N-terminal region and a stable β-sandwich.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46509-46517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the EqtII N-terminal α-helix must be inserted prior to oligomerization to allow an efficient pore formation (26.Rojko N. Kristan K.Č. Viero G. Žerovnik E. Maček P. Dalla Serra M. Anderluh G. Membrane damage by an α-helical pore-forming protein, Equinatoxin II, proceeds through a succession of ordered steps.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 23704-23715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Activity of the EqtII-L26C mutant was dramatically reduced in comparison with the wild type protein, but partially recovered activity when labeled (Fig. 1). Such an effect of labeling on protein activity was also obtained by Malovrh et al. (27.Malovrh P. Viero G. Serra M.D. Podlesek Z. Lakey J.H. Macek P. Menestrina G. Anderluh G.

Chem. 2003; 278: 22678-22685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). As free Alexa 555 does not have hemolytic activity (at least under our experimental conditions), it seems like labeling might induce some conformational change in EqtII-L26C, which allowed repairing the pore-formation ability. Moreover, the activity of EqtII-L26C-Al555 reproduces all the important events described for the wild type (6.García-Sáez A.J. Buschhorn S.B. Keller H. Anderluh G. Simons K. Schwille P. Oligomerization and pore formation by equinatoxin II inhibit endocytosis and lead to plasma membrane reorganization.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 37768-37777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), thus this mutant allowed us to study the oligomerization process with slower kinetics. In the hemolytic assay, each mutant showed the same behavior when changing the dye (Alexa 488 or Alexa 555) (data not shown). Thus we concluded that there is no effect of the dye in toxin aggregation or membrane interaction, which made EqtII-Alexa 488 and EqtII-L26C-Alexa 555 suitable for our study. Upon binding to the target cell, EqtII induces the formation of immobile raft-like domains where the toxin is localized (6.García-Sáez A.J. Buschhorn S.B. Keller H. Anderluh G. Simons K. Schwille P. Oligomerization and pore formation by equinatoxin II inhibit endocytosis and lead to plasma membrane reorganization.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 37768-37777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, the dynamic behavior of the individual EqtII molecules within these domains and on the remaining membrane remains unknown. To investigate the mobility of the individual EqtII particles in the plasma membrane, we performed single molecule tracking experiments. We used EqtII labeled with Alexa 488 at a single Cys introduced at residue 126 (EqtII-Al488) (see “Experimental Procedures”), which retains its hemolytic activity (Fig. 1). Prior to toxin addition, an area containing individual cells was selected and focused using bright field microscopy. Then, we added the fluorescently labeled toxin at a final concentration of 10 nm to COS-1 cells and acquired movies in the TIRF mode. This is the optimal concentration at which we have a significant number of particles and the cell is alive for long enough to follow particle dynamics. Under our experimental conditions, the cells died in a couple of minutes, but was enough to record the toxin diffusion at 1 min. The evanescent wave generated under TIRF illumination ensured that only the molecules bound to the plasma membrane in contact with the coverslip glass were excited (Fig. 2A). As the oligomerization kinetic takes place in the time frame of cell death and we observed labeled proteins in the cells surface adhered to the glass, toxin molecules in free solution are able to access such regions of the plasma membrane from the water interface between the adherent cells and the glass, and as a consequence this population can be considered as representative for EqtII effect (28.Sergé A. de Keijzer S. Van Hemert F. Hickman M.R. Hereld D. Spaink H.P. Schmidt T. Snaar-Jagalska B.E. Quantification of GPCR internalization by single-molecule microscopy in living cells.Integr. Biol. 2011; 3: 675-683Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Single molecules of EqtII-Al488 appeared as bright spots diffusing in a dark background (Fig. 2B). We tracked individual particles of EqtII over consecutive images in time-lapse experiments. Fig. 3A shows representative trajectories of EqtII-Al488 particles from movies acquired 1 min after toxin addition. The MSD analysis, as well as the histogram of diffusion coefficients, showed that almost all EqtII-Al488 particles exhibited subdiffusion (Fig. 3, B and C), which fit best to confined diffusion with an averaged apparent diffusion coefficient of 0.36 ± 0.07 μm2 s−1. To analyze the stoichiometry of single EqtII molecules, we performed a brightness analysis of the individual particles that has been established and successfully used to determine the stoichiometry of other membrane protein complexes, including β-pore-forming toxins (29.Thompson J.R.

The first five seconds in the life of a clathrin-coated pit.Cell. 2012; 150: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). To this aim, we calibrated the fluorescence signal in the TIRF microscope prior to each experiment (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 4). We characterized the fluorescence signal of EqtII-Al488 monomers via photobleaching analysis and Gaussian fitting to the histogram of the distribution of fluorescence intensities measured. Based on these values, we calculated the expected brightness of higher oligomers. Then, we calculated the brightness of individual EqtII-Al488 particles in the membrane of living COS-1 cells by fitting with a two-dimensional Gaussian (Fig. 2C) and plotted the intensity distribution as a histogram (Fig. 2D). Visual inspection of the broad distribution of fluorescence intensities indicates the presence of species brighter than monomers. We fitted the histogram of fluorescence intensities with a linear combination of Gaussian curves corresponding to the brightness calculated for the different oligomeric forms (16.Schmidt T.

https://openalex.org/W2028622779,"The structure of Earth’s magnetosphere is poorly understood when the interplanetary magnetic field is northward. Under this condition, uncharacteristically energetic plasma is observed in the magnetotail lobes, which is not expected in the textbook model of the magnetosphere. Using satellite observations, we show that these lobe plasma signatures occur on high-latitude magnetic field lines that have been closed by the fundamental plasma process of magnetic reconnection. Previously, it has been suggested that closed flux can become trapped in the lobe and that this plasma-trapping process could explain another poorly understood phenomenon: the presence of auroras at extremely high latitudes, called transpolar arcs. Observations of the aurora at the same time as the lobe plasma signatures reveal the presence of a transpolar arc. The excellent correspondence between the transpolar arc and the trapped closed flux at high altitudes provides very strong evidence of the trapping mechanism as the cause of transpolar arcs."

https://openalex.org/W2087968576,"Neutrophils are capable of switching from integrin-dependent motility on two-dimensional substrata to integrin-independent motion following entry into the confined three-dimensional matrix of an afflicted tissue. However, whether integrins still maintain a regulatory role for cell traction generation and cell locomotion under the physical confinement of the three-dimensional matrix is unknown, and this is challenging to deduce from motility studies alone. Using three-dimensional traction force microscopy and a double hydrogel sandwich system, we determined the three-dimensional spatiotemporal traction forces of motile neutrophils at unprecedented resolution and show, for the first time, that entry into a highly confined space (2.5D) is a sufficient trigger to convert to integrin-independent migration. We find that integrins exert a significant regulatory role in determining the magnitude and spatial distribution of tractions and cell speed on confined cells. We also find that 90% of neutrophil tractions are in the out-of-plane axis, and this may be a fundamental element of neutrophil traction force generation."

The protein products of KRIT1 and CCM2 (Krev interaction trapped 1 (KRIT1) and cerebral cavernous malformations 2 (CCM2), respectively) directly interact with each other. Disease-associated mutations in KRIT1 and CCM2 mostly result in loss of their protein products, although rare missense point mutations can also occur. From gene sequencing of patients known or suspected to have one or more CCMs, we discover a series of missense point mutations in KRIT1 and CCM2 that result in missense mutations in the CCM2 and KRIT1 proteins. To place these mutations in the context of the molecular level interactions of CCM2 and KRIT1, we map the interaction of KRIT1 and CCM2 and find that the CCM2 phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain displays a preference toward the third of the three KRIT1 NPX(Y/F) motifs. We determine the 2.75 Å co-crystal structure of the CCM2 PTB domain with a peptide corresponding to KRIT1NPX(Y/F)3, revealing a Dab-like PTB fold for CCM2 and its interaction with KRIT1NPX(Y/F)3. We find that several disease-associated missense mutations in CCM2 have the potential to interrupt the KRIT1-CCM2 interaction by destabilizing the CCM2 PTB domain and that a KRIT1 mutation also disrupts this interaction.

https://openalex.org/W1987269580,"Secretion of proteins into the membrane-cell wall space is essential for cell wall biosynthesis and pathogenicity in Gram-positive bacteria. Folding and maturation of many secreted proteins depend on a single extracellular foldase, the PrsA protein. PrsA is a 30-kDa protein, lipid anchored to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane. The crystal structure of Bacillus subtilis PrsA reveals a central catalytic parvulin-type prolyl isomerase domain, which is inserted into a larger composite NC domain formed by the N- and C-terminal regions. This domain architecture resembles, despite a lack of sequence conservation, both trigger factor, a ribosome-binding bacterial chaperone, and SurA, a periplasmic chaperone in Gram-negative bacteria. Two main structural differences are observed in that the N-terminal arm of PrsA is substantially shortened relative to the trigger factor and SurA and in that PrsA is found to dimerize in a unique fashion via its NC domain. Dimerization leads to a large, bowl-shaped crevice, which might be involved in vivo in protecting substrate proteins from aggregation. NMR experiments reveal a direct, dynamic interaction of both the parvulin and the NC domain with secretion propeptides, which have been implicated in substrate targeting to PrsA. Background: PrsA is a foldase for secreted proteins and pathogenicity factors in Gram-positive bacteria. Results: Crystallographic, enzymatic, and NMR spectroscopic analysis provide insights to PrsA function. Conclusion: Substrate peptides interact around a unique crevice generated by PrsA dimerization via its chaperone-like domain. Significance: The comprehensive characterization of PrsA promotes its utilization as foldase and drug target."
https://openalex.org/W1973154697,"Background Pulmonary hypertension (PH) was recently recognized as a common complication of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) that causes an increased risk of mortality. Epidemiological data for this disorder in earlier stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its association with cardiovascular (CV) morbidity are scarce. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 2,351 Chinese CKD patients with complete clinical records and echocardiography data between Jan 2008 and May 2012. The patients were divided into the following 6 groups: CKD Stages 1–4; Stage 5 for those not on or initiated on hemodialysis for <3 months; and Stage 5D for the patients undergoing hemodialysis for ≥3 months. The prevalence of PH and CV morbidity was investigated, and their association was evaluated with a logistic regression model. Results PH was detected in 426 patients (18.1%). Mild, moderate and severe PH was diagnosed in 12.1%, 4.9% and 1.1% of the patients, respectively. Severe PH was detected in CKD Stages 5 and 5D. CV morbidity was found in 645 patients (27.4%). Compared with the non-PH group, the PH group had a higher risk for cardiac disease but not for cerebrovascular disease risk. PH severity was associated with cardiac morbidity risk [odds ratio (95% CI) for mild PH: 1.79 (1.30–2.47); moderate PH: 2.75 (1.73–4.37); severe PH: 3.90 (1.46–10.42)]. Conclusions Our study showed for the first time the epidemiology profile of PH across the spectrum of CKD. Mild-to-moderate PH occurs with more frequency in advanced CKD, and severe PH is scarce in non-ESRD CKD. PH in CKD is associated with cardiac but not cerebrovascular disease, with increasing cardiac morbidity seen with increasing PH severity. Evidence from prospective studies addressing PH in this population is needed to predict cardiac events."

We have shown that c-psbA4, one of the five psbA orthologs in this cyanobacterium, is exclusively expressed during nighttime. Remarkably, the corresponding D1 isoform has replacements of a number of amino acids that are essential ligands for the catalytic Mn4CaO5 metal center for water oxidation by PSII. At least 30 cyanobacterial strains, most of which are known to have nitrogen fixing abilities, have similar psbA orthologs. We expressed the c-psbA4 gene from Cyanothece 51142 in a 4E-3 mutant strain of the model non-nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, which lacks any psbA gene. The resultant strain could not grow photoautotrophically. Moreover, these Synechocystis 6803 cells were incapable of PSII-mediated oxygen evolution. Based on our findings, we have named this physiologically relevant, unusual D1 isoform sentinel D1.

Structure of bacteriophage SPP1 tail reveals trigger for DNA ejection.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3720-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The tail of Bacillus subtilis phage SPP1 includes two TTPs, gp17.1 (19.1 kDa) and gp17.1* (28.3 kDa), that share a common N-terminal sequence (11Auzat I. Dröge A. Weise F. Lurz R. Tavares P. Origin and function of the two major tail proteins of bacteriophage SPP1.Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 70: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A programmed translational frameshift of gene 17.1 leads to the production of gp17.1*, which contains an additional C-terminal domain as compared with gp17.1. In the wild-type phage, approximately one gp17.1* for every 3 eq of gp17.1 is incorporated into the tail structure. However, a virion coding for only gp17.1 is viable and infectious, demonstrating that the additional domain present in gp17.1* is dispensable for virion assembly and function. Here, we observe by electron microscopy (EM) that recombinant gp17.1 alone forms tubes constituted by stacked rings of TTP subunits with a helical organization similar to the one found in tails of SPP1 virions but with variable lengths. NMR and FTIR analyses show that gp17.1 adopts a partially folded structure in its monomeric form and undergoes further structural changes to build a β-sheet-rich helical tube. From EM and bioinformatics results, we propose a first model for the phage noncontractile tail TTP tube. A PCR fragment spanning from gene 16.1 to the end of gene 17.1 without a stop codon (coordinates 9641–11,011 of the SPP1 genome sequence, accession code X97918.2) was obtained by amplification of SPP1 wild-type DNA using oligonucleotides 5:pIA6For and 6:pIA6Rev 17.1 (Table 1). The sequence of oligonucleotide 6 replaces the rare proline codons CCC at the end of gene 17.1 by more abundant CCG or CCT codons, and it also codes for a noncleavable C-terminal hexahistidine tag. The purified PCR fragment product was cleaved with EcoRI and HindIII and inserted into the pPT25 shuttle vector (11Auzat I. Dröge A. Weise F. Lurz R. Tavares P. Origin and function of the two major tail proteins of bacteriophage SPP1.Mol.

This vector was used for the first production trials of gp17.1 with a noncleavable C-terminal hexahistidine tag, further named gp17.1SPP1.TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used in this work Open table in a new tab To increase the protein production yield, we further used a synthetic gene optimized for expression in Escherichia coli inserted into a pETM-13 vector (GeneScript, Piscataway, NJ). This gene also coded for gp17.1 with a noncleavable C-terminal hexahistidine tag. The only amino acid sequence difference between gp17.1SPP1 and gp17.1 is an extra glycine residue in position 2 in gp17.1. gp17.1Δ (gp17.1 deleted from loop 40–56) was similarly overproduced from a synthetic gene inserted in a pETM-13 vector. Plasmids were transformed into BL21Star (DE3) cells (Stratagene) and selected on kanamycin media at all stages.

E. coli BL21(DE 3) freshly transformed with plasmid pIA6 was grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth supplemented with erythromycin (30 μg ml−1) and chloramphenicol (10 μg ml−1) until reaching an absorbance at 600 nm of 1. The culture was then diluted 10-fold into a minimal medium containing (15NH4)2SO4 as the sole nitrogen source supplemented with the same antibiotics. Recombinant hexahistidine-tagged gp17.1 proteins were constitutively produced overnight at 37 °C. Pelleted bacteria were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton, 10 mm MgSO4) and disrupted by sonication. Crude extracts were centrifuged at 4 °C twice for 20 min at 27,000 × g, and gp17.1 proteins were purified by metal-chelating chromatography. The supernatant was loaded onto a 5-ml Hi-Trap Ni-NTA column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with buffer A (20 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl). The column was washed with increasing concentrations of buffer B (buffer A with 1 m imidazole) and the protein eluted at 250 mm imidazole. The eluate was dialyzed against a 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 150 mm NaCl buffer and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Vivaspin 20, 10-kDa molecular mass cutoff). At this step, the protein, further named gp17.1SPP1, was more than 95% pure as assessed by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration was determined by measurement of the UV absorbance at 280 nm, with an extinction coefficient of 18,910 m−1 cm−1. The purified protein was then characterized using solution-state NMR by recording 1H-15N HSQC and 1H-15N NOE experiments at 25 °C and 700 MHz (Fig. 1, A and B) as described below. gp17.1SPP1 was also analyzed using fluorescent-based thermal shift assay with a SYPRO Orange dye as a fluorescent probe (Invitrogen) (Fig. 1C). Reactions were carried out in duplicate in a 96-well fast PCR plate with 5 μg of protein in a final volume of 20 μl. The temperature gradient was performed in the range of 25-95 °C at a 3 °C min−1 rate on an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast real time PCR system. Fluorescence was recorded as a function of temperature in real time (excitation wavelength, 488 nm; emission spectrum, 500-660 nm), and the melting temperature was calculated with the ABI SDS2.4 software as the maximum of the derivative of the resulting denaturation curves. E. coli BL21(DE3) strains transformed with the pETM-13 vectors coding for gp17.1 and gp17.1Δ were grown at 37 °C to an absorbance of 1.5, induced with 0.25 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and incubated at the same temperature overnight. Uniformly (>98% for 15N and 13C and >70% for 2H) 15N-labeled, 15N/13C-labeled, and 15N/13C/2H-labeled proteins were produced in minimal media containing 0.5 g/liter 15NH4Cl and 2 g/liter [12C6]glucose or [13C6]glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources. For triple labeling, cells were first grown in LB at 37 °C overnight, then diluted 25-fold in a 99.9% 2H2O-based M9 minimal medium, and incubated at 37 °C overnight, and finally diluted 50-fold in the same deuterated minimal medium, induced with 0.25 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown overnight at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl and 8 m urea to solubilize inclusion bodies, and lysed by sonication. After addition of benzonase and 10 mm MgCl2, cells were centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 1 h on a rotor JLA25.50 (∼48,000 × g). Hexahistidine-tagged proteins were purified on about 7 ml of Ni-NTA resin (GE Healthcare) in denaturing conditions with 8 m urea, 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 (buffer A). The resin was washed with buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl and 50 mm imidazole. Proteins were then refolded using a urea gradient from 8 to 0 m and eluted in buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl and 500 mm imidazole. gp17.1 exhibited a denaturation temperature similar to that of gp17.1SPP1 (55 °C against 55.5 °C) in the fluorescent-based thermal shift assay (data not shown). For liquid-state NMR spectroscopy, the gp17.1 and gp17.1Δ proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, NaCl from concentrations 100 to 500 mm depending on the sample, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm PMSF overnight. They were concentrated using ultracentrifugation in Vivaspin 5000 (Vivascience). The final samples consisted of the 15N-labeled, 15N/13C-labeled, or 15N/13C/2H-labeled proteins at a concentration of 8–10 mg/ml (0.4–0.5 mm) in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, NaCl from 150 to 500 mm depending on the sample, 1 mm EDTA, and 90% H2O, 10% D2O. For solid-state NMR (ssNMR) spectroscopy, the 15N,13C-labeled gp17.1 protein was dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm PMSF overnight. Tube formation was obtained through incubation in this buffer at 37 °C for 1 week. Before NMR experiments, the tubes were dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% D2O was added to the sample. To follow gp17.1 assembly into tubes, gp17.1 and mixtures of gp17.1 with gp17.1Δ were loaded in denaturing conditions (8 m urea, 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5) on a Ni-NTA column, eluted by adding 500 mm imidazole to the buffer, and refolded by overnight dialysis against 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. Proteins were concentrated by ultracentrifugation in Vivaspin 5000 (Vivascience) to concentrations of 0.5 to 8 mg/ml (0.025–0.4 mm). They were then run through size exclusion chromatography (SEC) in a Superdex 200 16/60 HR column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and 50 mm NaCl. Fractions corresponding to monomeric proteins were pooled and used for FTIR and EM assays. Analytical SEC and multiangle static light scattering (SEC-MALS) experiments were performed with a 2 mg/ml (0.1 mm) gp17.1 sample injected on a Shodex KW-804 column initially calibrated with BSA. The column was pre-equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and 50 mm NaCl. SEC experiments were also performed with gp17.1, gp17.1Δ, and gp17.1 mixed with gp17.1Δ. Mixtures corresponded to 1:3, 1:6, and 1:12 mass ratios of gp17.1Δ/gp17.1 monomers. All mixed samples were prepared from a defined amount of purified monomeric gp17.1Δ added to the supernatant of bacteria producing gp17.1 for which the yield of gp17.1 was well determined. The mixture was purified in denaturing conditions (8 m urea) on a Ni-NTA column as described above, dialyzed against a refolding buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl) overnight, and injected on a Superdex 200 16/60 HR column calibrated before use. The two- and three-dimensional 1H/15N/13C/2H NMR experiments were performed at 25 °C on Bruker DRX600 and DRX700 spectrometers equipped with triple resonance TCI cryoprobes. All data were processed with Topspin 1.3 (Bruker Biospin, Germany) and analyzed using Sparky3 (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, University of California, San Francisco). First two-dimensional 15N-1H HSQC spectra were recorded on gp17.1SPP1 (Fig. 1, A and B). To obtain higher production yields, we then used an optimized gene for overproduction of gp17.1 in E. coli and purified it in the same buffer used for gp17.1SPP1 studies. At a concentration higher than 6 mg/ml (0.3 mm), the NMR signal corresponding to the monomeric protein disappeared within a week. Screening different buffer conditions showed that increasing salt concentrations slowed down this process. Therefore, the following NMR analyses of gp17.1 were carried out in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl. Comparison of the two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra recorded on gp17.1SPP1 in the presence of 150 mm NaCl and on gp17.1 in the presence of 500 mm NaCl showed overlapping NMR spectra, confirming that the two proteins adopt the same three-dimensional conformation in this range of salt concentrations. All reported experiments were then carried out using the refolded protein gp17.1 in 500 mm NaCl. Three-dimensional HNCO, HNCA, HNCACO, HNCOCA, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HBHA(CO)NH, and 15N- and 13C-edited 1H-1H NOESY experiments were recorded on 15N/13C-labeled samples. Three-dimensional HNCO, HNCA, HNCACO, HNCOCA, HNCACB, HNCOCACB, NNHN, and NCONHN experiments were recorded on 15N/13C/2H-labeled samples. These experiments were analyzed to assign the backbone resonances of gp17.1. The assigned chemical shifts were submitted to Predator (16Berjanskii M.V. Neal S. Wishart D.S. PREDATOR: a web server for predicting protein torsion angle restraints.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: W63-W69Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) to identify the gp17.1 secondary structure elements. gp17.1 tubes were obtained by incubation at 37 °C of the refolded protein in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm PMSF overnight. Tubes were spun down at 20,000 × g by centrifugation, and the pellet was transferred into a 3.2-mm zirconia rotor. All proton-driven spin diffusion (PDSD) experiments were conducted using a 3.2-mm triple resonance (1H,13C, and 15N) probe head at a static magnetic field of 18.8 tesla corresponding to 800 MHz 1H resonance frequency (Bruker Biospin). All experiments were performed at a magic angle spinning rate of 10 kHz at −20 °C with SPINAL 64 (17Fung B.M. Khitrin A.K. Ermolaev K. An improved broadband decoupling sequence for liquid crystals and solids.J Magn. Reson. 2000; 142: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar) 1H decoupling during evolution and detection periods. The liquid state NMR chemical shift-based cross-peaks were generated using the program FANDAS (18Gradmann S. Ader C. Heinrich I. Nand D. Dittmann M. Cukkemane A. van Dijk M. Bonvin A.M. Engelhard M. Baldus M. Rapid prediction of multi-dimensional NMR data sets.J. Biomol. NMR. 2012; 54: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and were analyzed with Sparky3. The average chemical shifts of the amino acid residues in a β-structure were obtained from the work of Wang and Jardetsky (19Wang Y. Jardetzky O. Probability-based protein secondary structure identification using combined NMR chemical-shift data.Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Tentative assignments were obtained using a combination of two-dimensional correlation experiments that included two-dimensional 13C,13C PDSD correlations obtained using under weak coupling conditions (20Seidel K. Lange A. Becker S. Hughes C.E. Heise H. Baldus M. Protein solid-state NMR resonance assignments from (13C,13C) correlation spectroscopy.Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics. 2004; 6: 5090-5093Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar) with spin diffusion times of 30 and 150 ms to encode intra-residue and sequential effects, respectively. The 15N,13C experiments were recorded using a SPECIFIC-CP (21Baldus M. Petkova A.T. Herzfeld J. Griffin R.G. Cross polarization in the tilted frame: assignment and spectral simplification in heteronuclear spin systems.Mol. Physics. 1998; 95: 1197-1207Crossref Scopus (461) Google Scholar) time of 3 ms. Two-dimensional 15N,13Cα-Cx and two-dimensional 15N,13C′-Cx were recorded with 13C-13C mixing times of 50 ms, respectively. Protein solution spectra were measured at 4 cm−1 resolution with a Bruker IFS 66 spectrophotometer equipped with a 45° N ZnSe attenuated total reflection attachment. After elution from the gel filtration column in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and 50 mm NaCl, gp17.1 was lyophilized. For the FTIR experiments, gp17.1 samples were suspended in D2O and concentrated to about 3 mg/ml (0.15 mm). The concentrator flow-through was used as the reference buffer sample for measuring buffer signal. FTIR spectra of the protein sample and its corresponding buffer solution were initially recorded just after dissolution in D2O. Thereafter, spectra of both protein and buffer samples were recorded every 24 h to follow tube formation from 0 to 16 days. The protein sample was maintained at 37 °C between spectra acquisitions. Spectra of both protein and buffer samples were recorded with an average of 30 scans. The buffer spectra were subsequently subtracted from the protein spectra. Each spectrum was normalized to the area between 1530 and 1750 cm−1. To follow gp17.1 tube assembly, EM images of gp17.1 were obtained by transmission electron microscopy of negative-staining samples. About 5 μl of the sample solution was applied on a carbon-coated Formvar copper grid (Agar Scientific). After 2 min, the sample droplet was blotted with filter paper, and 5 μl of 0.5% phosphotungstic acid stain was applied onto the grid. After 2 min, the excess of staining solution was blotted with filter paper and then the grid was rinsed with deionized water and dried. Samples were imaged in a transmission electron microscope JEOL MET 1400 (120 kV) equipped with a CCD camera SC100 Orius at ×10,000 to 30,000 magnification. To assess helical parameters of the gp17.1 tubes, images of samples negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate were taken on a Tecnai F20, and data were recorded using a Gatan Ultrascan 4000 4 × 4 camera at a magnification of ×80,000. Determination of the contrast transfer function was done for each CCD image using CTFFIND3 (22Mindell J.A. Grigorieff N. Accurate determination of local defocus and specimen tilt in electron microscopy.J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 142: 334-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Segments of tubes were selected manually using BOXER (EMAN (23Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. EMAN: semiautomated software for high-resolution single-particle reconstructions.J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar)). Images were corrected for the CTF effects using Spider on the cut-out segments. Selected particles (segments) were normalized to an average density of zero and the same standard deviation of 1 for all images. All segments were aligned to the vertical rectangle and subjected to multivariate statistical analysis and classification (24van Heel M. Do single (ribosome) molecules phase themselves?.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2001; 66: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Class averages contained ∼10 images/class, and their diffraction patterns were analyzed. The classes that produced the most symmetrical diffraction patterns were analyzed further. The maxima intensities on a layer line are defined by a distance R from the meridian and radius r of the virus that was described by a Bessel function J of order n: Jn(2πRr) (25Stewart M. Computer image processing of electron micrographs of biological structures with helical symmetry.J. Electron Microsc. Tech. 1988; 9: 325-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The values of Bessel function orders were determined, and the parameters of the tube helix were defined using the selection rule for the helical symmetry as described in Stewart (25Stewart M. Computer image processing of electron micrographs of biological structures with helical symmetry.J. Electron Microsc. Tech. 1988; 9: 325-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The distance between gp17.1 rings was determined from the positions of layer lines in the diffraction patterns, and the angle of rotation around the tube axis between the rings was derived from the helical parameters of the tube. Search for the gp17.1 fold was done using the HHpred server (26Söding J. Biegert A. Lupas A.N. The HHpred interactive server for protein homology detection and structure prediction.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W244-W248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2643) Google Scholar), which identified four structural homologs. N-terminal gp17.1 residues 1–138 were predicted to adopt the fold of the N-terminal domain of the TTP gpV of phage λ (PDB code 2K4Q) with a probability of 99%.

https://openalex.org/W2018306020,"Deleted in Liver Cancer 1 (DLC1) is a RHO GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that negatively regulates RHO. Through its GAP activity, it modulates the actin cytoskeleton network and focal adhesion dynamics, ultimately leading to suppression of cell invasion and metastasis. Despite its presence in various structural and signaling components, little is known about how the activity of DLC1 is regulated at focal adhesions. Here we show that EGF stimulation activates the GAP activity of DLC1 through a concerted mechanism involving DLC1 phosphorylation by MEK/ERK and its subsequent dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and inhibition of focal adhesion kinase by MEK/ERK to allow the binding between DLC1 and PP2A. Phosphoproteomics and mutation studies revealed that threonine 301 and serine 308 on DLC1, known previously to be mutated in certain cancers, are required for DLC1-PP2A interaction and the subsequent activation of DLC1 upon their dephosphorylation. The intricate interplay of this MEK/ERK-focal adhesion kinase-DLC1-PP2A quartet provides a novel checkpoint in the spatiotemporal control of cell spreading and cell motility."
https://openalex.org/W2094162029,"Aquatic plants are phylogenetically well dispersed across the angiosperms. Reproductive and other life-history traits of aquatic angiosperms are closely associated with specific growth forms. Hydrophilous pollination exhibits notable examples of convergent evolution in angiosperm reproductive structures, and hydrophiles exhibit great diversity in sexual system. In this study, we reconstructed ancestral characters of aquatic lineages based on the phylogeny of aquatic angiosperms. Our aim is to find the correlations of life form, pollination mode and sexual system in aquatic angiosperms. Hydrophily is the adaptive evolution of completely submersed angiosperms to aquatic habitats. Hydroautogamy and maleflower-ephydrophily are the transitional stages from anemophily and entomophily to hydrophily. True hydrophily occurs in 18 submersed angiosperm genera, which is associated with an unusually high incidence of unisexual flowers. All marine angiosperms are submersed, hydrophilous species. This study would help us understand the evolution of hydrophilous pollination and its correlations with life form and sexual system."
https://openalex.org/W2110125271,"The applicability of species-specific primers to study feeding interactions is restricted to those ecosystems where the targeted prey species occur. Therefore, group-specific primer pairs, targeting higher taxonomic levels, are often desired to investigate interactions in a range of habitats that do not share the same species but the same groups of prey. Such primers are also valuable to study the diet of generalist predators when next generation sequencing approaches cannot be applied beneficially. Moreover, due to the large range of prey consumed by generalists, it is impossible to investigate the breadth of their diet with species-specific primers, even if multiplexing them. However, only few group-specific primers are available to date and important groups of prey such as flying insects have rarely been targeted. Our aim was to fill this gap and develop group-specific primers suitable to detect and identify the DNA of common taxa of flying insects. The primers were combined in two multiplex PCR systems, which allow a time- and cost-effective screening of samples for DNA of the dipteran subsection Calyptratae (including Anthomyiidae, Calliphoridae, Muscidae), other common dipteran families (Phoridae, Syrphidae, Bibionidae, Chironomidae, Sciaridae, Tipulidae), three orders of flying insects (Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Plecoptera) and coniferous aphids within the genus Cinara. The two PCR assays were highly specific and sensitive and their suitability to detect prey was confirmed by testing field-collected dietary samples from arthropods and vertebrates. The PCR assays presented here allow targeting prey at higher taxonomic levels such as family or order and therefore improve our ability to assess (trophic) interactions with flying insects in terrestrial and aquatic habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2057609975,"Psychosocial stress has been long known to have deleterious effects on health. Nevertheless, an exposure to moderate stressors enhances resilience and promotes health benefits. Male and female organisms differ in many aspects of health and disease. The aim of this study was to investigate antioxidant activity and oxidative damage in saliva in a psychosocial stress paradigm in men and women. Here, we show that an acute stressor of moderate strength augments antioxidant activity and decreases oxidative damage in whole saliva of young people. An examination stress caused a significant increase of catalase activity, accompanied by a decrease of levels of oxidized proteins. Levels of thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances did not increase at stress, indicating that lipid peroxidation was not activated. The stress-induced alterations were more manifested in young women compared to young men. Thus, antioxidant protective mechanisms are more activated by a moderate stressor in young women than in young men."
https://openalex.org/W2017768101,"Deficiencies of vitamin A and iron affect a significant portion of the world's population, and efforts to characterize patterns of these deficiencies are hampered by a lack of measurement tools appropriate for large-scale population-based surveys. Vitamin A and iron are not easily measured directly, so reliable proxy markers for deficiency status have been identified and adopted. Measurement of inflammatory markers is necessary to interpret vitamin A and iron status markers, because circulating levels are altered by inflammation. We developed a multiplex immunoassay method for simultaneous measurement of five markers relevant to assessing inflammation, vitamin A and iron status: α-1-acid glycoprotein, C-reactive protein, retinol binding protein 4, ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor. Serum and plasma specimens were used to optimize the assay protocol. To evaluate assay performance, plasma from 72 volunteers was assayed using the multiplex technique and compared to conventional immunoassay methods for each of the five markers. Results of the new and conventional assay methods were highly correlated (Pearson Correlations of 0.606 to 0.991, p<.0001). Inter-assay imprecision for the multiplex panel varied from 1% to 8%, and all samples fell within the limits of quantification for all assays at a single dilution. Absolute values given by the multiplex and conventional assays differed, indicating a need for further work to devise a new standard curve. This multiplexed micronutrient immunoassay technique has excellent potential as a cost effective tool for use in large-scale deficiency assessment efforts."

Neurosci. 2014; 34: 5083-5088Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Gliomedin is a type II transmembrane protein, and in addition to its C-terminal OLF domain, it harbors an extracellular collagen-like domain, which mediates gliomedin trimerization (8Maertens B. Hopkins D. Franzke C.W. Keene D.R. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Greenspan D.S. Koch M. Cleavage and oligomerization of gliomedin, a transmembrane collagen required for node of Ranvier formation.J. Biol.

A conserved postsynaptic transmembrane protein affecting neuromuscular signaling in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2191-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In vivo, gliomedin is processed proteolytically, and the extracellular OLF domain can be released either with or without the collagen domain (7Eshed Y. Feinberg K. Carey D.J. Peles E. Secreted gliomedin is a perinodal matrix component of peripheral nerves.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 8Maertens B. Hopkins D. Franzke C.W. Keene D.R.

Chem. 2007; 282: 10647-10659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The OLF domain is also glycosylated (8Maertens B. Hopkins D. Franzke C.W. Keene D.R. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Greenspan D.S. Koch M. Cleavage and oligomerization of gliomedin, a transmembrane collagen required for node of Ranvier formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10647-10659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), although the exact sites and nature of glycosylation have not been determined. The ∼250-residue OLF domain was first discovered in the early 1990s (12Yokoe H. Anholt R.R. Molecular cloning of olfactomedin, an extracellular matrix protein specific to olfactory neuroepithelium.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 4655-4659Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). All members of the OLF protein family contain an extracellular OLF domain (13Anholt R.R. Olfactomedin proteins: central players in development and disease.Front. Cell Dev. Biol. 2014; 2: 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). OLF domains are mediators of extracellular protein interactions, and they play roles in diverse processes, such as nervous system development, intercellular adhesion, and cell cycle regulation (14Tomarev S.I. Nakaya N. Olfactomedin domain-containing proteins: possible mechanisms of action and functions in normal development and pathology.Mol. Neurobiol. 2009; 40: 122-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Although the structure of the OLF domain has remained unknown, it can be predicted to consist largely of β-structure. The OLF domain of myocilin was suggested to form a six-bladed β-propeller structure (15Dismuke W.M. McKay B.S. Stamer W.D. Myocilin, a component of a membrane-associated protein complex driven by a homologous Q-SNARE domain.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 3606-3613Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), but no experimental data have backed up this prediction. Due to its direct disease linkage, the most widely studied OLF family member is myocilin, mutations in which cause primary open-angle glaucoma in humans (16Resch Z.T. Fautsch M.P. Glaucoma-associated myocilin: a better understanding but much more to learn.Exp. Eye Res. 2009; 88: 704-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 17Tamm E.R.

Identification of a gene that causes primary open angle glaucoma.Science. 1997; 275: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). Myocilin is also involved in myelination, especially in the optic nerve (19Kwon H.S. Nakaya N. Abu-Asab M. Kim H.S. Tomarev S.I.

Kaufman P.L. Hernandez M.R. Expression of myocilin/TIGR in normal and glaucomatous primate optic nerves.Exp. Eye Res. 2001; 73: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The sequence identity between the OLF domains of gliomedin and myocilin is only 22%, however, suggesting that they do not carry out overlapping functions. An interaction between gliomedin and myocilin has also been reported (20Kwon H.S. Johnson T.V. Joe M.K. Abu-Asab M. Zhang J. Chan C.C. Tomarev S.I. Myocilin mediates myelination in the peripheral nervous system through ErbB2/3 signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 26357-26371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We determined the high-resolution crystal structure of the OLF domain from gliomedin. The structure presents an unusual β-propeller fold, and it can be used both to understand the involvement of gliomedin in neurological development and disease and to obtain information on disease-related mutations in related OLF family members, such as myocilin. The OLF domain of rat gliomedin (residues 260–543; sequence numbering includes the signal sequence) was recombinantly expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells (23Han H. Kursula P. Expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary x-ray crystallographic analysis of the extracellular olfactomedin domain of gliomedin.Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Commun. 2014; 70: 1536-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Purification consisted of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography, His tag cleavage using tobacco etch virus protease, and size-exclusion chromatography (23Han H. Kursula P. Expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary x-ray crystallographic analysis of the extracellular olfactomedin domain of gliomedin.Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Commun. 2014; 70: 1536-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The OLF domain was predicted by sequence analysis to lie at the very C terminus, whereas the N-terminal boundary of the domain was difficult to pinpoint. The domain selected for expression and structural studies ranged from the end of the collagen-like domain close to the C terminus. This construct provided a good yield of crystallizable recombinant protein. CD spectroscopy was used to confirm the folding state of the purified gliomedin OLF domain. Spectra were measured on an Applied Photophysics Chirascan-plus instrument at +20 °C in a buffer containing 1.8 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 7 mm NaCl. The protein concentration was 0.5 mg/ml, and the cuvette path length was 0.5 mm. Synchrotron small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) data were obtained on the SWING beamline at the SOLEIL Synchrotron (Paris, France). The gliomedin OLF domain (6 mg/ml) was injected onto an Agilent SEC-3 size-exclusion column using an Agilent HPLC system and eluted with 0.1 m Tris (pH 7.5) and 400 mm NaCl. The eluate was directed to the SAXS flow-through capillary cell, and scattering data were collected online. Frames corresponding to the main peak were selected and averaged using FoxTrot. Following data processing, further analyses were performed with the ATSAS package (24Petoukhov M.V. Franke D. Shkumatov A.V. Tria G. Kikhney A.G. Gajda M. Gorba C. Mertens H.D. Konarev P.V.

Crystallogr. 2012; 45: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar) was used in conjunction with the crystal structure to build the fragments not visible in the crystal. Highly concentrated pure gliomedin OLF domain (23 mg/ml) in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 100 mm NaCl was used for crystallization. After 3 days of incubation at 293 K, crystals were observed in 0.1 m CHES (pH 9.5) containing 20% PEG 8000. The crystals were picked up in a LithoLoop (Molecular Dimensions), briefly immersed in mother liquor supplemented with 20% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data for these orthorhombic native crystals were collected on the ID23-1 beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France). Data collection for the monoclinic crystal form was reported previously (23Han H. Kursula P. Expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary x-ray crystallographic analysis of the extracellular olfactomedin domain of gliomedin.Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Commun. 2014; 70: 1536-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). For experimental phasing, a large number of derivatives using heavy metal compounds and halides were prepared and tested. Eventually, a strong anomalous signal was observed from a single crystal soaked in K2PtCl4. Single-wavelength anomalous dispersion data were collected on beamline 14.1 at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin/Berliner Elektronen-Speicherring Gesellschaft für Synchrotronstrahlung (HZB/BESSY, Berlin, Germany). All diffraction data were processed with XDS (26Kabsch W. Automatic processing of rotation diffraction data from crystals of initially unknown symmetry and cell constants.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3225) Google Scholar). The structure was solved using the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion protocol of Auto-Rickshaw, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) Hamburg automated crystal structure determination platform (27Panjikar S. Parthasarathy V. Lamzin V.S. Weiss M.S. Tucker P.A.

Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The input diffraction data were prepared and converted for use in Auto-Rickshaw using programs of the CCP4 suite (28Winn M.D. Ballard C.C. Cowtan K.D. Dodson E.J. Emsley P. Evans P.R. Keegan R.M.

Estimated substructure structure factor amplitude values were calculated using SHELXC (29Sheldrick G.M. Experimental phasing with SHELXC/D/E: combining chain tracing with density modification.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Based on an initial analysis of the data, the maximum resolution for substructure determination and initial phase calculation was set to 2.61 Å. Heavy atoms were found with SHELXD (30Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Substructure solution with SHELXD.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar), and the correct hand for the substructure was determined using ABS (31Hao Q. ABS: a program to determine absolute configuration and evaluate anomalous scatterer substructure.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2004; 37: 498-499Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and SHELXE (32Sheldrick G.M. Macromolecular phasing with SHELXE.Z. Kristallogr. 2002; 217: 644-650Crossref Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Initial phases were calculated after density modification using SHELXE (32Sheldrick G.M. Macromolecular phasing with SHELXE.Z. Kristallogr. 2002; 217: 644-650Crossref Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry operator was found using RESOLVE (33Terwilliger T.C. Maximum-likelihood density modification.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar). Density modification, phase extension, and non-crystallographic symmetry averaging were performed with dm (34Cowtan K. “dm”: an automated procedure for phase improvement by density modification.in: Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. Vol. 31. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United Kingdom1994: 34-38Google Scholar). Two chains of 242 residues each were thereafter automatically built using ARP/wARP (35Morris R.J. Zwart P.H.

The partially refined structure was then used as a template for molecular replacement against a native high-resolution data set in a different space group. The structure was further refined using PHENIX and manually built using Coot (40Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Features and development of Coot.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The final coordinates and original structure factors were deposited in the Protein Data Bank with codes 4D77 (orthorhombic) and 4D7C (monoclinic). Homologous structures were searched using PDBeFold (41Krissinel E. Henrick K. Secondary-structure matching (SSM), a new tool for fast protein structure alignment in three dimensions.Acta Crystallogr.

A homology model for the myocilin OLF domain was constructed based on sequence alignment between myocilin and gliomedin using SWISS-MODEL (47Biasini M. Bienert S. Waterhouse A. Arnold K. Studer G.

SWISS-MODEL: modelling protein tertiary and quaternary structure using evolutionary information.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: W252-W258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3624) Google Scholar). Gliomedin contains an N-terminal transmembrane domain, a collagen-like segment, and a C-terminal OLF domain (Fig. 1A). The structure of the rat gliomedin OLF domain was solved by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing using a crystal derivatized with platinum, and the structure was refined to 1.49 Å resolution using native data (Table 1). The OLF domain structure is composed of a five-bladed β-propeller (Fig. 1B), and each blade contains four β-strands (strands a–d). The overall dimensions of the OLF domain are ∼30 × 40 × 40 Å. Like other β-propellers, the OLF domain is disc-shaped. The propeller circle is closed by insertion of the first N-terminal β-strand into the framework of the last propeller blade (Fig. 1B), which is a common mechanism in β-propeller proteins, also termed Velcro closure (48Fülöp V. Jones D.T. β Propellers: structural rigidity and functional diversity.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 715-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The structure also contains three short α-helices. The longest of these helices is located in a loop between β-strands c and d of blade 1. Interestingly, normal mode analysis of the structure suggests that this helix is highly mobile, and there may be significant motions between blades 1 and 5 (data not shown). In general terms, normal mode analysis allows the identification of potential low-frequency, large-amplitude, concerted motions in a protein structure. A schematic representation of the OLF domain topology is shown in Fig. 1C.TABLE 1Crystallographic data collection and refinementData setPt-SADNativeNative 2Data collection Beamline14.1 (BESSY)ID23-1 (ESRF)ID23-2 (ESRF) Wavelength (Å)1.0710.9540.873 Unit cell parametersa = 45.5, b = 100.7, c = 59.3 Å; β = 90.05°a = 45.8, b = 62.5, c = 88.3 Åa = 37.6, b = 141.7, c = 46.0 Å; β = 110.6° Space groupP21P212121P21 Resolution (Å)aThe values in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell.50-2.01 (2.06-2.01)50-1.48 (1.52-1.48)50-1.45 (1.49-1.45) No. of reflections63,785 (4753)42,999 (3127)78,451 (5723) Rmerge (%)4.3 (32.0)4.6 (193.2)9.9 (101.7) 〈I/σI〉10.4 (2.6)18.3 (1.0)8.4 (1.3) Completeness (%)90.4 (89.5)99.9 (99.9)98.7 (97.4) Redundancy1.5 (1.5)6.5 (6.3)3.7 (3.6) CC1/2 (%)bCC1/2 is the correlation coefficient between two random half-data sets (69).99.7 (82.7)100.0 (31.7)99.7 (48.0) Wilson B factor (Å2)37.031.420.6Refinement Rwork/Rfree (%)13.7/16.317.3/21.2 Root mean square deviation Bond lengths (Å)0.0070.015 Bond angles1.2°1.0° MolProbity score (percentile)cValidation was carried out using MolProbity (70).1.14 (98th)1.32 (94th) Ramachandran most favored (%)cValidation was carried out using MolProbity (70).97.297.0 Ramachandran outliers (%)cValidation was carried out using MolProbity (70).0.40.4 Average B factor (Å2), protein, solvent34.3/42.220.7/29.2 Protein chains/asymmetric unit212 Protein Data Bank code4D774D7Ca The values in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell.b CC1/2 is the correlation coefficient between two random half-data sets (69Karplus P.A.

Open table in a new tab The common fold of a β-propeller structure contains 4–10 antiparallel four-stranded β-sheets (49Chen C.K. Chan N.L. Wang A.H. The many blades of the β-propeller proteins: conserved but versatile.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2011; 36: 553-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Upon close inspection, the OLF domain five-bladed fold lacks a regular 5-fold symmetry and appears twisted. Indeed, blades 1–4 are actually arranged according to a hexagonal setting (Fig. 1C). The remaining blade 5, which contains both the N and C termini, actually takes up the space that would be filled by two blades in a six-bladed β-propeller. This arrangement is certainly unexpected and unusual, and it distinguishes the OLF domain from both five- and six-bladed β-propellers, also explaining difficulties in correctly predicting the OLF domain structure. Structural homology searches using different algorithms with the gliomedin OLF domain produced rather poor hits to β-propeller structures, and both five- and six-bladed structures were detected. However, when only blades 1–4 were used in searches, better fits were obtained toward six-bladed structures. This further highlights the loss of 5-fold symmetry in the OLF domain and confirms the 6-fold symmetry obeyed by the first four blades. Superpositions on symmetric five- and six-bladed structures further proved this arrangement (Fig. 2). To obtain an insight into possible functionally important sites on the gliomedin OLF domain surface, we analyzed its surface properties. The electrostatic surface of the gliomedin OLF domain shows a high positive charge on"

The results so obtained are re-stated by making use of inverse transformation which yields it in terms of original variables. It is observed that the proposed algorithm is highly efficient and appropriate for fractional PDEs and hence can be extended to other complex problems of diversified nonlinear nature."

Given the ethnic differences and developmental changes, our study aims to investigate the potential impacts of GSTM1/GSTT1genotypes on the development of ATDH in Han Chinese children treated with anti-tuberculosis therapy. Methods Children receiving anti-tuberculosis therapy with or without evidence of ATDH were considered as the cases or controls, respectively. The GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotyping were performed using the polymerase chain reaction. Results One hundred sixty-three children (20 cases and 143 controls) with a mean age of 4.7 years (range: 2 months-14.1 years) were included. For the GSTM1, 14 (70.0%) cases and 96 (67.1%) controls had homozygous null mutations. For the GSTT1, 13 (65.0%) cases and 97 (67.8%) controls had homozygous null mutations. Neither the GSTM1, nor the GSTT1 polymorphism was significantly correlated with the occurrence of ATHD. Conclusion Ourresults did not support the GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms as the predictors of ADTH in Chinese Han children treated with anti-tuberculosis drugs. An age-related association between pharmacogenetics and ATHD need to be confirmed in the further study."

Cardiac Kv activity is indispensable where even minimal reductions in function can extend action potential duration, prolong QT intervals, and ultimately contribute to life-threatening arrhythmias. Diseases such as congenital disorders of glycosylation often cause significant cardiac phenotypes that can include arrhythmias. Here we investigated the impact of reduced sialylation on ventricular repolarization through gene deletion of the sialyltransferase ST3Gal4. ST3Gal4-deficient mice (ST3Gal4−/−) had prolonged QT intervals with a concomitant increase in ventricular action potential duration. Ventricular apex myocytes isolated from ST3Gal4−/− mice demonstrated depolarizing shifts in activation gating of the transient outward (Ito) and delayed rectifier (IKslow) components of K+ current with no change in maximum current densities. Consistently, similar protein expression levels of the three Kv isoforms responsible for Ito and IKslow were measured for ST3Gal4−/− versus controls. However, novel non-enzymatic sialic acid labeling indicated a reduction in sialylation of ST3Gal4−/− ventricular Kv4.2 and Kv1.5, which contribute to Ito and IKslow, respectively. Thus, we describe here a novel form of regulating cardiac function through the activities of a specific glycogene product. Namely, reduced ST3Gal4 activity leads to a loss of isoform-specific Kv sialylation and function, thereby limiting Kv activity during the action potential and decreasing repolarization rate, which likely contributes to prolonged ventricular repolarization.

Conclusion: Individual glycogene products serve unique roles in affecting cardiac voltage-gated K+ channel activity.

Glycosylation is a ubiquitous cellular process that involves the coordinated activities of hundreds of glycosylation-related gene (glycogene) products (1Montpetit M.L. Stocker P.J. Schwetz T.A.

Glycans serve a number of important physiological roles including cell-to-cell communication and adhesion, trafficking, protein folding and stability, and receptor-ligand binding among other functions. Additionally, there is increasing evidence that glycans can significantly modulate electrical excitability (for review, see Ref. 9Ednie A.R. Bennett E.S. Modulation of voltage-gated ion channels by sialylation.Compr. Physiol. 2012; 2: 1269-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This effect on electrical signaling likely involves the carbohydrate residue sialic acid, which is unique in that it bears a negative charge at physiologic pH originating from a carboxylic acid at its C1 carbon (10Chen X. Varki A. Advances in the biology and chemistry of sialic acids.ACS Chem. Biol. 2010; 5: 163-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar).

Kass R.S. Molecular physiology of cardiac repolarization.Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 1205-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Kv can be heavily glycosylated and through these glycan structures provide linkage sites for the typically terminally linked sialic acid residue. The effect of sialic acids on electrical excitability likely originates, at least in part, from their negative charge contributing to an extracellular surface potential that modulates the voltage sensors of Kv causing the channels to gate at less depolarized membrane potentials (9Ednie A.R.

Electrical signaling is vital to normal cardiac function, as it contributes to muscle contraction and maintains rhythmicity. Deviations in Kv activity specifically can affect cardiac conduction by altering the AP duration and the QT interval, which can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias (16Abbott G.W.

Sialyltransferases are a family of ∼20 glycogene products that are responsible for attaching sialic acids to lipids and/or glycoproteins, each with their own substrate specificities (19Takashima S. Characterization of mouse sialyltransferase genes: their evolution and diversity.Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2008; 72: 1155-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). β-Galactoside α-2,3-sialyltransferase 4 (ST3Gal4) is a sialyltransferase responsible for adding sialic acids to terminal galactose residues of glycoproteins through an α-2,3 linkage. ST3Gal4 can sialylate both N- and O-linked glycoprotein structures (19Takashima S. Characterization of mouse sialyltransferase genes: their evolution and diversity.Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2008; 72: 1155-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It was reported previously that mice homozygous for a ST3Gal4 null-transgene (ST3Gal4−/−) demonstrated an increased susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias (20Ednie A.R. Horton K.K. Wu J. Bennett E.S. Expression of the sialyltransferase, ST3Gal4, impacts cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel activity, refractory period, and ventricular conduction.J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2013; 59: 117-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The electrical dysfunction was attributed to a depolarizing shift in ventricular voltage-gated Na+ channel (Nav) gating and an increased rate of recovery from fast inactivation of ST3Gal4−/− Nav that likely contributed to the observed decrease in cellular and ventricular refractory periods. The effect on Nav activity was likely caused by a direct reduction in the number of sialic acids attached to tetrodotoxin-resistant Nav α-subunits without any apparent remodeling of Nav expression or distribution. Here we sought to question whether and how deletion of the ST3Gal4 gene could affect ventricular repolarization in the adult mouse heart. The rate of cardiac repolarization is impacted by inactivation of Nav and activity of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (Cav) and other various transporters/exchangers but is affected primarily through the action of several Kv isoforms (11Nerbonne J.M. Kass R.S. Molecular physiology of cardiac repolarization.Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 1205-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). In mouse ventricular myocytes, Kv activity can be ascribed to three kinetically distinct K+ current (IK) types: a rapidly inactivating transient current type (Ito), a more slowly inactivating but rapidly activating delayed rectifier current type (IKslow), and a sustained non-inactivating current (ISS) (21Brunet S. Aimond F. Li H. Guo W. Eldstrom J. Fedida D. Yamada K.A. Nerbonne J.M. Heterogeneous expression of repolarizing, voltage-gated K+ currents in adult mouse ventricles.J. Physiol. 2004; 559: 103-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Ito and IKslow are thought to be conducted through a combination of at least three putative Kv isoforms: Kv4.2, Kv1.5, and Kv2.1 (22Li H. Guo W. Yamada K.A. Nerbonne J.M. Selective elimination of I(K,slow1) in mouse ventricular myocytes expressing a dominant negative Kv1.5α subunit.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ.

Physiol. 2004; 286: H368-H374Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). There is some evidence of a role for Kv4.3; however, genetic ablation of the corresponding gene had no impact on mouse ventricular IK or repolarization, suggesting a minimal contribution from this isoform (24Niwa N. Wang W. Sha Q. Marionneau C. Nerbonne J.M. Kv4.3 is not required for the generation of functional Ito,f channels in adult mouse ventricles.J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2008; 44: 95-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Kv4.2 and Kv2.1 were shown to possess O-linked glycans with no N-linked sites, whereas the Kv1.5 isoform contains one putatively occupied N-linked site, and it is unknown whether there are occupied O-linked sites (12Schwetz T.A. Norring S.A. Bennett E.S. N-Glycans modulate K(v)1.5 gating but have no effect on K(v)1.4 gating.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1798: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 14Schwetz T.A.

Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 293: C152-C161Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Molecularly, ISS is likely conducted predominately through non-voltage-dependent channels of the “two-pore” type (K2P) (27Gurney A. Manoury B. Two-pore potassium channels in the cardiovascular system.Eur. Biophys. J. 2009; 38: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As described below, deletion of the ST3Gal4 gene causes a reduction in sialic acid levels attached to Kv4.2 and Kv1.5 channel protein and significantly affects Kv gating, causing an effective reduction in IK (Ito and IKslow) during the AP with a concomitant prolongation of the QT interval. These studies begin to elucidate the roles of individual glycogene products and how, through the process of glycosylation, they may contribute to a complex network of cardiac regulation in normal and pathologic conditions. All animals, chemicals, reagents, enzymes, and animal tissue were stored, used, and disposed of following guidelines outlined in the product literature, as established by the National Institutes of Health and approved through the University of South Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The creation and characterization of the ST3Gal4−/− mouse, generously provided by Dr. Jamey Marth, was performed previously by others (28Ellies L.G. Ditto D. Levy G.G. Wahrenbrock M. Ginsburg D. Varki A. Le D.T. Marth J.D. Sialyltransferase ST3Gal-IV operates as a dominant modifier of hemostasis by concealing asialoglycoprotein receptor ligands.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 10042-10047Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Genotyping was performed as described previously (20Ednie A.R. Horton K.K. Wu J. Bennett E.S. Expression of the sialyltransferase, ST3Gal4, impacts cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel activity, refractory period, and ventricular conduction.J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2013; 59: 117-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Myocytes were isolated from the left ventricular apex (LVA) of ST3Gal4−/− and wild type (WT) mice (homozygous for the normal ST3Gal4 gene) between 12 and 14 weeks of age as described previously (20Ednie A.R. Horton K.K. Wu J. Bennett E.S. Expression of the sialyltransferase, ST3Gal4, impacts cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel activity, refractory period, and ventricular conduction.J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2013; 59: 117-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The left ventricular apex was selected because of the relative homogeneity of IK in that region of the mouse heart (21Brunet S. Aimond F. Li H. Guo W. Eldstrom J. Fedida D. Yamada K.A. Nerbonne J.M. Heterogeneous expression of repolarizing, voltage-gated K+ currents in adult mouse ventricles.J. Physiol. 2004; 559: 103-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Myocytes were stored in a high K+ solution at room temperature and used between 1 and 4 h following the isolation. Whole-cell, patch clamp recording was performed as described previously (20Ednie A.R. Horton K.K. Wu J. Bennett E.S. Expression of the sialyltransferase, ST3Gal4, impacts cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel activity, refractory period, and ventricular conduction.J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2013; 59: 117-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). An extracellular recording solution was used to record IK and consisted of (in millimoles/liter (mm)) 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, 136 NaCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 0.25 CdCl2 (to block voltage-sensitive Ca2+ current), 5.4 KCl, and 0.02 tetrodotoxin (to block voltage-sensitive Na+ current), pH 7.4. Patch pipettes were filled with an intracellular recording solution that consisted of (in mm): 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, 1 magnesium triphosphate, 5 glucose, 135 KCl, and 4 K2 adenosine 5′-triphosphate, pH 7.2. Patch pipettes had mean series resistances of 2.3 ± 0.2 megohms (MΩ) and 2.6 ± 0.2 MΩ for WT and ST3Gal4−/−, respectively (n = 15–19, p = 0.3). Immediately prior to seal formation, the solid/liquid junction offset was zeroed manually using the pipette offset on an Axopatch 200B amplifier with β set to 0.1. Following seal formation of at least one gigaohm (GΩ), the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp method was obtained. Cell size and input resistance were determined by integrating the capacitance of the cell following a 25-ms, 10-mV step in voltage from a holding potential of −70 mV and were not different between groups (WT, 178.2 ± 11.0 pF/6.7 ± 0.5 MΩ; ST3Gal4−/−, 207.2 ± 15.7 pF/7.4 ± 0.4 MΩ; n = 15–19 and p = 0.3/0.2, respectively). The seal resistances, measured as the amount of current required by the amplifier to maintain a holding potential of −70 mV following attainment of whole-cell configuration, were 1.6 ± 0.5 and 1.3 ± 0.6 GΩ for WT and ST3Gal4−/− myocytes, respectively (n = 15–19, p = 0.7); cells were not used if seal resistance was below 750 mΩ. After measuring the cell size, series resistance and capacitance were minimized manually and compensated to a minimum value of 80%. All electrophysiological studies compared function between STGal4−/− and WT control ventricular apex myocytes under identical conditions. Thus, all voltage shifts caused by series resistance, leak, and junction potentials were identical and were ignored. Voltage-gated Ca2+ currents (ICa) were recorded by substituting K+ in the extracellular and intracellular recording solutions with tetraethyl ammonium chloride and cesium chloride, respectively, raising the extracellular recording solution CaCl2 concentration to 1 mm, and omitting the CdCl2. To record action potentials in current clamp mode, the same solutions described above (for recording IK) were used with the following exceptions: the extracellular recording solution CaCl2 concentration was raised to 1 mmol/liter and CdCl2 and tetrodotoxin were omitted. Voltage and current clamp protocols were written and executed using Axon Clampex 10.2, and the intracellular recording solution was allowed to dialyze for 5 min following cell rupture. Analog signals recorded by the amplifier were low pass-filtered at 5 kHz and then digitized at a rate of 50 kHz using a Digidata 1440A analog/digital interface connected to a personal computer. Cells were held at −70 mV and then depolarized by a series of voltage steps beginning at −50 mV and ending at 50 mV for 4.5 s in 10-mV increments. Each voltage step was separated by 15 s. The decaying portion of each current trace was fit with the following bi-exponential function, f(t)=lKslowe−t/π1+ltoe−t/π2+lSS(Eq. 1) where IKslow is the amplitude of the slowly inactivating portion of each current trace, t is the time in ms, τ1 is the time it takes IKslow to inactivate 1 exponential unit, Ito is the amplitude of the rapidly inactivating portion of each current trace, τ2 is the time in ms it takes Ito to inactivate one exponential unit, and ISS is the amplitude of the non-inactivating portion of each current trace. This method, as a means to delineate the different IK values in the mouse ventricle, was described by others previously (21Brunet S. Aimond F. Li H. Guo W. Eldstrom J. Fedida D. Yamada K.A. Nerbonne J.M. Heterogeneous expression of repolarizing, voltage-gated K+ currents in adult mouse ventricles.J. Physiol. 2004; 559: 103-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The amplitudes of each kinetic component, derived from the above equation, for each current trace were divided by the cell capacitance to report current density as A/F, or the current was divided by the driving force using the following equation to determine conductance (G), G=I/(V−Vrev)(Eq. 2) where I is the current at each test potential, V is the test potential, and Vrev is the Nernst equation-derived reversal potential at ∼22 °C (−82.8 mV). Conductance-voltage relationships were fit with a Boltzmann equation of the form, =[1+(e−((V−Va)/Ka))]−1(Eq. 3) where Gmax is the maximum theoretical conductance, Va is the voltage of half-activation, and Ka is the slope of the Boltzmann fit for activation. Gmax, Va, and Ka for each cell and current type (kinetic component), determined by fitting the single cell data to a single Boltzmann distribution, were used to determine the mean parameter values among cells as listed in Table 1. Also, Gmax was used to normalize the cellular data. To compare conductance, Gmax was normalized to cell size for each current type from each cell to report conductance density in nanosiemens/pF.TABLE 1The mean ± S.E. IK and AP parameters Open table in a new tab To measure the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation (SSI), cells were held at −70 mV and subjected to conditioning voltage pulses ranging from −110 to 0 mV in 10-mV increments for 10 s. Following the conditioning pulses, the cells were depolarized to 40 mV for 4.5 s. Each sweep was separated by 15 s. The decaying portion of each current trace elicited from each voltage step to 40 mV was fit with a bi-exponential function as described above. The maximum amplitudes of each current type (kinetic components) from each current trace were normalized to their corresponding maximum values from the first step to 40 mV. The data were fit with either a single Boltzmann equation for Ito or a double Boltzmann equation for IKslow, =[1+(e−((Vcond−Vi)/Ki))]−1(Eq. 4) =[1+(e−((Vcond−Vi1)/Ki1))+(1+(e−((Vcond−Vi2)/Ki2))]−1(Eq. 5) where I/Imax is the ratio of each current to the maximum current, Vcond is the potential of each conditioning pulse, Vi1 and Vi2 are the voltages of half-inactivation, and Ki1 and Ki2 are the slopes of the Boltzmann fits for inactivation as described previously (29Aimond F. Kwak S.P. Rhodes K.J. Nerbonne J.M. Accessory Kvβ1 subunits differentially modulate the functional expression of voltage-gated K+ channels in mouse ventricular myocytes.Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The Vi and Ki (Ito) and the Vi1, Vi2, Ki1, and Ki2 (IKslow) for each cell and for each current type were determined by fitting the single cell data to a single (Ito) or double (IKslow) Boltzmann distribution and were used to determine the mean parameter values among cells as listed in Table 1. The time constants of inactivation were recorded from the bi-exponential fit as described above used to calculate current densities and conductance-voltage (G-V) values. IKslow is represented by τ1, and Ito is represented by τ2, where τ is the time in ms it takes for the current to inactivate 1 exponential unit. Cells were held at a membrane potential of −70 mV and depolarized to 40 mV for 10 s. The cells were returned to −70 mV for a range of intervals (10–5000 ms) and then depolarized to 40 mV for 4.5 s. Each pulse was separated by 15 s. The maximum current elicited by the second 40-mV test pulse was normalized to the maximum current elicited by the initial pulse to 40 mV for each sweep and plotted as the fraction of current versus time. The fractional current versus time curve for each cell was fit with a standard bi-exponential function to determine the slow and fast time constants of recovery from inactivation. Cells were held at −70 mV then depolarized by a series of voltage steps beginning at −40 mV and ending at 50 mV for 500 ms in 10-mV increments. To inactivate any Nav not blocked by tetrodotoxin, each test pulse was preceded by a 50-ms prepulse to −40 mV. The voltage steps were separated by 15 s. Each cell was also subjected to a pulse protocol identical to that described above without the prepulse; the prepulse had no significant impact on the current other than to inactivate residual Nav. The maximum negative current at each test pulse was divided by capacitance for each cell and averaged. To calculate conductance, the maximum negative current was divided by the driving force as described above, but the reversal potential was determined empirically for each cell (35 or 45 mV). G-V relationships were fit with a single Boltzmann function as described above to determine activation gating parameters. To measure ICa SSI, cells were held at −70 mV and subjected to conditioning voltage pulses ranging from −70 to 20 mV in 10-mV increments for 400 ms. Following the conditioning pulses, the cells were depolarized to 20 mV for 400 ms. Each sweep was separated by 15 s. The maximum negative amplitude from each current trace was normalized to the maximum value from the first step to 20 mV. The data were fit with a single Boltzmann equation as described above. Following cell rupture, the membrane potential was measured. Cells were injected with square pulses of positive current for a duration of 4 ms with an initial current step of 100 pA followed by subsequent current steps with a delta of 50 pA.

Two studies published in Cell and Genome Research now independently report the identification of hundreds of microexons. Alternative splicing of some microexons is regulated by neuronal-specific RNA-binding proteins and modifies the function of proteins involved in neurogenesis, with misregulation linked to autism. Microexons are frequently underestimated in transcriptome analyses. Two studies published in Cell and Genome Research now independently report the identification of hundreds of microexons. Alternative splicing of some microexons is regulated by neuronal-specific RNA-binding proteins and modifies the function of proteins involved in neurogenesis, with misregulation linked to autism. Nearly all human multi-exonic genes undergo alternative splicing (AS) to produce more than one mature mRNA, thus greatly expanding transcriptomic complexity and functional diversity (Nilsen and Graveley, 2010Nilsen T.W. Graveley B.R. Nature. 2010; 463: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar). Precise annotation of all AS events is essential for better understanding this repertoire under both physiological and pathological conditions, but the combinatorial aspect of this problem has been a major challenge. This problem is exacerbated in the case of microexons, exons less than 51 nt, which have often been overlooked because their short length makes them computationally difficult to identify. Microexons are thought to be unfavorable for splicing because they lack sufficient exonic splicing enhancers and they are so short that the splicing machinery cannot physically assemble at both the 3′ and 5′ splice sites (Black, 1991Black D.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 389-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, Blencowe, 2000Blencowe B.J. Trends Biochem.

Now, two independent papers by Irimia et al., 2014Irimia M. Weatheritt R.J. Ellis J. Parikshak N.N. Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis T. Babor M. Quesnel-Vallières M. Tapial J. Raj B.

To assess the contribution of microexons to the transcriptome, Irimia et al., 2014Irimia M. Weatheritt R.J. Ellis J. Parikshak N.N. Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis T. Babor M. Quesnel-Vallières M. Tapial J.

They show that the regulation of microexons is highly dynamic during neuronal differentiation (Figure 1). Strikingly, although microexons represent only 1% of AS observed, they constitute up to one-third of all conserved neural-regulated AS between human and mouse. The inclusion in the final transcript of most identified neural microexons is regulated by a brain-specific factor, nSR100, which binds to intronic enhancer UGC motifs close to the 3′ splice sites. Of particular interest, these microexons are enriched for lengths that are multiples of 3 nt and are thus highly likely to produce alternative protein isoforms if included or excluded from the final transcript. The authors further provide several lines of evidence, both computational and experimental, to demonstrate that inclusion of microexons can modulate the function of interaction domains of proteins involved in neurogenesis (Figure 1). Interestingly, misregulation of neural-specific AS microexons is observed in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Li et al., 2015Li Y.I. Sanchez-Pulido L. Haerty W. Ponting C.P. Genome Res. 2015; (Published online December 18, 2014)https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.181990.114Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar approach the issue in a different way. They treat microexons as insertions between annotated splice junctions to retrieve a set of microexons that are shorter than 51 nt, including both constitutively spliced (CS) and AS microexons, from more than 900 human and mouse samples, nearly half of which were from brain tissues. The authors find that AS microexons are evolutionarily conserved and exhibit tissue-specific inclusion. Furthermore, they show that AS of microexons mediated by specific RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), such as RBFox and PTBP1, may alter protein sequences, thus leading to changes in protein-protein interactions. In contrast to CS microexons that possess strong cis elements to enhance splicing (Li et al., 2015Li Y.I. Sanchez-Pulido L. Haerty W. Ponting C.P. Genome Res. 2015; (Published online December 18, 2014)https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.181990.114Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), AS microexons require additional interactions with the splicing machinery, which are usually enhanced by RBPs. Interestingly, many brain-specific microexons might be regulated by a single RBP acting as a master splicing regulator. For instance, Irimia et al., 2014Irimia M. Weatheritt R.J. Ellis J. Parikshak N.N. Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis T. Babor M. Quesnel-Vallières M. Tapial J. Raj B. O’Hanlo D. et al.Cell. 2014; 159 (this issue): 1511-1523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar demonstrate that neural-specific factor nSR100 promotes the AS of very short microexons during neurogenesis (Figure 1), and Li et al., 2015Li Y.I. Sanchez-Pulido L. Haerty W. Ponting C.P. Genome Res. 2015; (Published online December 18, 2014)https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.181990.114Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar confirm that most brain-specific microexons are enhanced by tissue-specific RBFox proteins. It is noteworthy that RBFox1-dependent AS has been implicated in ASD (Voineagu et al., 2011Voineagu I. Wang X. Johnston P. Lowe J.K. Tian Y. Horvath S. Mill J. Cantor R.M. Blencowe B.J. Geschwind D.H. Nature. 2011; 474: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). These two new reports focus on different trans-acting factors, and questions remain, including the extent of the overlap of these two data sets and whether these distinct splicing regulators act independently or in concert to regulate AS of microexons in the brain. In addition, it will be of interest to identify other RBPs or master RBPs that can regulate AS microexons in different tissues or under different conditions. Beyond the discovery of these surprising rules for the regulation of microexon splicing, it is of particular significance that these two studies (Irimia et al., 2014Irimia M. Weatheritt R.J. Ellis J. Parikshak N.N. Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis T. Babor M. Quesnel-Vallières M. Tapial J. Raj B.

Whereas many microexons introduce short stretches of amino acids that alter protein-protein interactions, others may introduce novel charged regions or new platforms for posttranslational modification. Not all lead necessarily to changes on the protein surface—one might envision that some microexon AS results in subtle alterations in protein folding or catalytic function. Furthermore, microexons can change the properties of the mRNA, altering its structure, stability, or subcellular location. Given the myriad ways that microexons can exert their influence, it is likely that they may have tissue-specific functions in other organs, and their mis-regulation may correlate with disease, as was observed for neuronal-specific microexons and ASD (Irimia et al., 2014Irimia M. Weatheritt R.J. Ellis J. Parikshak N.N. Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis T. Babor M. Quesnel-Vallières M. Tapial J. Raj B. O’Hanlo D. et al.Cell. 2014; 159 (this issue): 1511-1523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Also, as neural-specific microexon splicing is highly conserved during evolution at both the levels of genomic sequence and tissue-specific inclusion pattern (Irimia et al., 2014Irimia M. Weatheritt R.J. Ellis J. Parikshak N.N. Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis T. Babor M. Quesnel-Vallières M. Tapial J. Raj B.

https://openalex.org/W2095003528,"SFS is a non-anchored protein of Streptococcus equi subspecies equi that causes upper respiratory infection in horses. SFS has been shown to bind to fibronectin (FN) and block interaction of FN with type I collagen. We have characterized interactions of a recombinant 60-mer polypeptide, R1R2, with FN. R1R2 contains two copies of collagen-like 19-residue repeats. Experiments utilizing various FN fragments and epitope-mapped anti-FN monoclonal antibodies located the binding site to 8-9FNI modules of the gelatin-binding domain. Fluorescence polarization and competitive enzyme-linked assays demonstrated that R1R2 binds preferentially to compact dimeric FN rather than monomeric constructs containing 8-9FNI or a large dimeric FN construct that is constitutively in an extended conformation. In contrast to bacterial peptides that bind 2–5FNI in addition to 8-9FNI, R1R2 did not cause conformational extension of FN as assessed by a conformationally sensitive antibody. Equilibrium and stopped-flow binding assays and size exclusion chromatography were compatible with a two-step binding reaction in which each of the repeats of R1R2 interacts with one of the subunits of dimeric FN, resulting in a stable complex with a slow koff. In addition to not binding to type I collagen, the R1R2·FN complex incorporated less efficiently into extracellular matrix than free FN. Thus, R1R2 binds to FN utilizing features of compact soluble FN and in doing so interferes with the organization of the extracellular matrix. A similar bivalent binding strategy may underlie the collagen-FN interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1988606957,"BST-2/tetherin is a cellular host factor capable of restricting the release of a variety of enveloped viruses, including HIV-1. Structurally, BST-2 consists of an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane domain, an ectodomain, and a C-terminal membrane anchor. The BST-2 ectodomain encodes three cysteine residues in its N-terminal half, each of which can contribute to the formation of cysteine-linked dimers. We previously reported that any one of the three cysteine residues is sufficient to produce functional BST-2 dimers. Here we investigated the importance of cysteine positioning on the ectodomain for functional dimerization of BST-2. Starting with a cysteine-free monomeric form of BST-2, individual cysteine residues were reintroduced at various locations throughout the ectodomain. The resulting BST-2 variants were tested for expression, dimerization, surface presentation, and inhibition of HIV-1 virus release. We found significant flexibility in the positioning of cysteine residues, although the propensity to form cysteine-linked dimers generally decreased with increasing distance from the N terminus. Interestingly, all BST-2 variants, including the one lacking all three ectodomain cysteines, retained the ability to form non-covalent dimers, and all of the BST-2 variants were efficiently expressed at the cell surface. Importantly, not all BST-2 variants capable of forming cysteine-linked dimers were functional, suggesting that cysteine-linked dimerization of BST-2 is necessary but not sufficient for inhibiting virus release. Our results expose new structural constraints governing the functional dimerization of BST-2, a property essential to its role as a restriction factor tethering viruses to the host cell."

Although the neural mechanism for automatically detecting one's own body instability is an important consideration, there have thus far been few functional neuroimaging studies because of the restrictions placed on participants' movements. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neural substrate underlying whole body instability, based on the self-recognition paradigm that uses video stimuli consisting of one's own and others' whole bodies depicted in stable and unstable states. Analyses revealed significant activity in the regions which would be activated during genuine unstable bodily states: The right parieto-insular vestibular cortex, inferior frontal junction, posterior insula and parabrachial nucleus. We argue that these right-lateralized cortical and brainstem regions mediate vestibular information processing for detection of vestibular anomalies, defensive motor responding in which the necessary motor responses are automatically prepared/simulated to protect one's own body, and sympathetic activity as a form of alarm response during whole body instability."

To investigate the function of the SRPN2 hinge insertion, we developed three SRPN2 variants in which the hinge regions are either constitutively expelled or inserted and analyzed their structure, thermostability, and inhibitory activity. We determined that constitutive hinge expulsion resulted in a 2.7-fold increase in the rate of CLIPB9Xa inhibition, which is significantly lower than previous observations of allosteric serpin activation. Furthermore, we determined that stable insertion of the hinge region did not appreciably decrease the accessibility of the RCL to CLIPB9.

Hematopoietic stem cells are tightly controlled by a network of CDK inhibitors that govern proliferation and prevent stem cell exhaustion. Loss of Inca1 led to an increased number of short-term hematopoietic stem cells in older mice, but Inca1 seems largely dispensable for normal hematopoiesis. On the other hand, Inca1-deficiency enhanced cell cycling upon cytotoxic stress and accelerated bone marrow exhaustion. Moreover, AML1-ETO9a-induced proliferation was not sustained in Inca1-deficient cells in vivo. As a consequence, leukemia induction and leukemia maintenance were severely impaired in Inca1−/− bone marrow cells. The re-initiation of leukemia was also significantly inhibited in absence of Inca1−/− in MLL—AF9- and c-myc/BCL2-positive leukemia mouse models. These findings indicate distinct functional properties of Inca1 in normal hematopoietic cells compared to leukemia initiating cells. Such functional differences might be used to design specific therapy approaches in leukemia."

Designing a biodiversity monitoring program is a difficult task that requires making decisions that often lack consensus due to budgetary constrains. As monitoring programs require long-term investment, they also require strong and continuing support from all interested parties. As such, stakeholder consultation is key to identify priorities and make sound design decisions that have as much support as possible. Here, we present the results of a consultation conducted to serve as an aid for designing a large-scale biodiversity monitoring program for the province of Québec (Canada). The consultation took the form of a survey with 13 discrete choices involving tradeoffs in respect to design priorities and 10 demographic questions (e.g., age, profession). The survey was sent to thousands of individuals having expected interests and knowledge about biodiversity and was completed by 621 participants. Overall, consensuses were few and it appeared difficult to create a design fulfilling the priorities of the majority. Most participants wanted 1) a monitoring design covering the entire territory and focusing on natural habitats; 2) a focus on species related to ecosystem services, on threatened and on invasive species. The only demographic characteristic that was related to the type of prioritization was the declared level of knowledge in biodiversity (null to high), but even then the influence was quite small."
