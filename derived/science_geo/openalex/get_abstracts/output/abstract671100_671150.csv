https://openalex.org/W3139074260,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants were first identified in the United Kingdom and South Africa, respectively, and have since spread to many countries. These variants harboring diverse mutations in the gene encoding the spike protein raise important concerns about their immune evasion potential. Here, we isolated infectious B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 strains from acutely infected individuals. We examined sensitivity of the two variants to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies present in sera and nasal swabs from individuals infected with previously circulating strains or who were recently vaccinated, in comparison with a D614G reference virus. We utilized a new rapid neutralization assay, based on reporter cells that become positive for GFP after overnight infection. Sera from 58 convalescent individuals collected up to 9 months after symptoms, similarly neutralized B.1.1.7 and D614G. In contrast, after 9 months, convalescent sera had a mean sixfold reduction in neutralizing titers, and 40% of the samples lacked any activity against B.1.351. Sera from 19 individuals vaccinated twice with Pfizer Cominarty, longitudinally tested up to 6 weeks after vaccination, were similarly potent against B.1.1.7 but less efficacious against B.1.351, when compared to D614G. Neutralizing titers increased after the second vaccine dose, but remained 14-fold lower against B.1.351. In contrast, sera from convalescent or vaccinated individuals similarly bound the three spike proteins in a flow cytometry-based serological assay. Neutralizing antibodies were rarely detected in nasal swabs from vaccinees. Thus, faster-spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants acquired a partial resistance to neutralizing antibodies generated by natural infection or vaccination, which was most frequently detected in individuals with low antibody levels. Our results indicate that B1.351, but not B.1.1.7, may increase the risk of infection in immunized individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3139036184,"Most human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 recognize the spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain and block virus interactions with the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. We describe a panel of human mAbs binding to diverse epitopes on the N-terminal domain (NTD) of S protein from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donors and found a minority of these possessed neutralizing activity. Two mAbs (COV2-2676 and COV2-2489) inhibited infection of authentic SARS-CoV-2 and recombinant VSV/SARS-CoV-2 viruses. We mapped their binding epitopes by alanine-scanning mutagenesis and selection of functional SARS-CoV-2 S neutralization escape variants. Mechanistic studies showed that these antibodies neutralize in part by inhibiting a post-attachment step in the infection cycle. COV2-2676 and COV2-2489 offered protection either as prophylaxis or therapy, and Fc effector functions were required for optimal protection. Thus, natural infection induces a subset of potent NTD-specific mAbs that leverage neutralizing and Fc-mediated activities to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection using multiple functional attributes."
https://openalex.org/W3139184535,"Tn7-like transposons have co-opted CRISPR systems, including class 1 type I-F, I-B, and class 2 type V-K. Intriguingly, although these CRISPR-associated transposases (CASTs) undergo robust CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-guided transposition, they are almost never found in sites targeted by the crRNAs encoded by the cognate CRISPR array. To understand this paradox, we investigated CAST V-K and I-B systems and found two distinct modes of transposition: (1) crRNA-guided transposition and (2) CRISPR array-independent homing. We show distinct CAST systems utilize different molecular mechanisms to target their homing site. Type V-K CAST systems use a short, delocalized crRNA for RNA-guided homing, whereas type I-B CAST systems, which contain two distinct target selector proteins, use TniQ for RNA-guided DNA transposition and TnsD for homing to an attachment site. These observations illuminate a key step in the life cycle of CAST systems and highlight the diversity of molecular mechanisms mediating transposon homing."
https://openalex.org/W3138813354,"To establish functional neural circuits in the brain, synaptic connections are refined by neural activity during development, where active connections are maintained and inactive ones are eliminated. However, the molecular signals that regulate synapse refinement remain to be elucidated. When we inactivate a subset of neurons in the mouse cingulate cortex, their callosal connections are eliminated through activity-dependent competition. Using this system, we identify JAK2 tyrosine kinase as a key regulator of inactive synapse elimination. We show that JAK2 is necessary and sufficient for elimination of inactive connections; JAK2 is activated at inactive synapses in response to signals from other active synapses; STAT1, a substrate of JAK2, mediates inactive synapse elimination; JAK2 signaling is critical for physiological refinement of synapses during normal development; and JAK2 regulates synapse refinement in multiple brain regions. We propose that JAK2 is an activity-dependent switch that serves as a determinant of inactive synapse elimination."
https://openalex.org/W3139980241,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in North, Central, and South America has become the epicenter of the current pandemic. We have suggested previously that the infection rate of this virus might be lower in people living at high altitude (over 2,500 m) compared to that in the lowlands. Based on data from official sources, we performed a new epidemiological analysis of the development of the pandemic in 23 countries on the American continent as of May 23, 2020. Our results confirm our previous finding, further showing that the incidence of COVID-19 on the American continent decreases significantly starting at 1,000 m above sea level (masl). Moreover, epidemiological modeling indicates that the virus transmission rate is lower in the highlands (&gt;1,000 masl) than in the lowlands (&lt;1,000 masl). Finally, evaluating the differences in the recovery percentage of patients, the death-to-case ratio, and the theoretical fraction of undiagnosed cases, we found that the severity of COVID-19 is also decreased above 1,000 m. We conclude that the impact of the COVID-19 decreases significantly with altitude."
https://openalex.org/W3137212402,"Recent advances in neuroscience have positioned brain circuits as key units in controlling behavior, implying that their positive or negative modulation necessarily leads to specific behavioral outcomes. However, emerging evidence suggests that the activation or inhibition of specific brain circuits can actually produce multimodal behavioral outcomes. This study shows that activation of a receptor at different subcellular locations in the same neuronal circuit can determine distinct behaviors. Pharmacological activation of type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptors in the striatonigral circuit elicits both antinociception and catalepsy in mice. The decrease in nociception depends on the activation of plasma membrane-residing CB1 receptors (pmCB1), leading to the inhibition of cytosolic PKA activity and substance P release. By contrast, mitochondrial-associated CB1 receptors (mtCB1) located at the same terminals mediate cannabinoid-induced catalepsy through the decrease in intra-mitochondrial PKA-dependent cellular respiration and synaptic transmission. Thus, subcellular-specific CB1 receptor signaling within striatonigral circuits determines multimodal control of behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3149941439,"Dysfunction of the lymphatic system is associated with a wide range of disease phenotypes. The restoration of dysfunctional lymphatic vessels has been hypothesized as an innovative method to rescue healthy phenotypes in diseased states including neurological conditions, metabolic syndromes, and cardiovascular disease. Compared to the vascular system, little is known about the molecular regulation that controls lymphatic tube morphogenesis. Using synthetic hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels as a chemically and mechanically tunable system to preserve lymphatic endothelial cell (LECs) phenotypes, we demonstrate that low matrix elasticity primes lymphatic cord-like structure (CLS) formation directed by a high concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C). Decreasing the substrate stiffness results in the upregulation of key lymphatic markers, including PROX-1, lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE-1), and VEGFR-3. Consequently, higher levels of VEGFR-3 enable stimulation of LECs with VEGF-C which is required to both activate matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and facilitate LEC migration. Both of these steps are critical in establishing CLS formation in vitro. With decreases in substrate elasticity, we observe increased MMP expression and increased cellular elongation, as well as formation of intracellular vacuoles, which can further merge into coalescent vacuoles. RNAi studies demonstrate that MMP-14 is required to enable CLS formation and that LECs sense matrix stiffness through YAP/TAZ mechanosensors leading to the activation of their downstream target genes. Collectively, we show that by tuning both the matrix stiffness and VEGF-C concentration, the signaling pathways of CLS formation can be regulated in a synthetic matrix, resulting in lymphatic networks which will be useful for the study of lymphatic biology and future approaches in tissue regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3144554272,"Constitutively expressed by innate immune cells, the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) initiates host immune responses and drives pathogenic responses in infectious, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases. Dendritic cells (DCs) express high levels of MIF, but the role of MIF in DC function remains poorly characterized. As migration is critical for DC immune surveillance, we investigated whether MIF promoted the migration of DCs. In classical transwell experiments, MIF−/− bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) or MIF+/+ BMDCs treated with ISO-1, an inhibitor of MIF, showed markedly reduced spontaneous migration and chemotaxis. CD74−/− BMDCs that are deficient in the ligand-binding component of the cognate MIF receptor exhibited a migration defect similar to that of MIF−/− BMDCs. Adoptive transfer experiments of LPS-matured MIF+/+ and MIF−/− and of CD74+/+ and CD74−/− BMDCs injected into the hind footpads of homologous or heterologous mice showed that the autocrine and paracrine MIF activity acting via CD74 contributed to the recruitment of DCs to the draining lymph nodes. Mechanistically, MIF activated the Src/PI3K signaling pathway and myosin II complexes, which were required for the migration of BMDCs. Altogether, these data show that the cytokine MIF exerts chemokine-like activity for DC motility and trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W3138029987,"Approximately 250 million people worldwide are chronically infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and are at increased risk of developing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The HBV genome persists as covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which serves as the template for all HBV mRNA transcripts. Current nucleos(t)ide analogs used to treat HBV do not directly target the HBV cccDNA genome and thus cannot eradicate HBV infection. Here, we report the discovery of a unique G-quadruplex structure in the pre-core promoter region of the HBV genome that is conserved among nearly all genotypes. This region is central to critical steps in the viral life cycle, including the generation of pregenomic RNA, synthesis of core and polymerase proteins, and genome encapsidation; thus, an increased understanding of the HBV pre-core region may lead to the identification of novel anti-HBV cccDNA targets. We utilized biophysical methods (circular dichroism and small-angle X-ray scattering) to characterize the HBV G-quadruplex and the effect of three distinct G to A mutants. We also used microscale thermophoresis to quantify the binding affinity of G-quadruplex and its mutants with a known quadruplex-binding protein (DHX36). To investigate the physiological relevance of HBV G-quadruplex, we employed assays using DHX36 to pull-down cccDNA and compared HBV infection in HepG2 cells transfected with wild-type and mutant HBV plasmids by monitoring the levels of genomic DNA, pregenomic RNA, and antigens. Further evaluation of this critical host-protein interaction site in the HBV cccDNA genome may facilitate the development of novel anti-HBV therapeutics against the resilient cccDNA template."
https://openalex.org/W3142774786,"Background Physical housing and household composition have an important role in the lives of individuals and drive health and social outcomes, and inequalities. Most methods to understand housing composition are based on survey or census data, and there is currently no reproducible methodology for creating population-level household composition measures using linked administrative data. Methods Using existing, and more recent enhancements to the address-data linkage methods in the SAIL Databank using Residential Anonymised Linking Fields we linked individuals to properties using the anonymised Welsh Demographic Service data in the SAIL Databank. We defined households, household size, and household composition measures based on adult to child relationships, and age differences between residents to create relative age measures. Results Two relative age-based algorithms were developed and returned similar results when applied to population and household-level data, describing household composition for 3.1 million individuals within 1.2 million households in Wales. Developed methods describe binary, and count level generational household composition measures. Conclusions Improved residential anonymised linkage field methods in SAIL have led to improved property-level data linkage, allowing the design and application of household composition measures that assign individuals to shared residences and allow the description of household composition across Wales. The reproducible methods create longitudinal, household-level composition measures at a population-level using linked administrative data. Such measures are important to help understand more detail about an individual’s home and area environment and how that may affect the health and wellbeing of the individual, other residents, and potentially into the wider community."
https://openalex.org/W3136269923,"We identified a genetic variant, an 8-residue appendage, of the α345 hexamer of collagen IV present in patients with glomerular basement membrane diseases, Goodpasture's disease and Alport syndrome, and determined the long-awaited crystal structure of the hexamer. We sought to elucidate how variants cause glomerular basement membrane disease by exploring the mechanism of the hexamer assembly. Chloride ions induced in vitro hexamer assembly in a composition-specific manner in the presence of equimolar concentrations of α3, α4, and α5 NC1 monomers. Chloride ions, together with sulfilimine crosslinks, stabilized the assembled hexamer. Furthermore, the chloride ion-dependent assembly revealed the conformational plasticity of the loop-crevice-loop bioactive sites, a critical property underlying bioactivity and pathogenesis. We explored the native mechanism by expressing recombinant α345 miniprotomers in the cell culture and characterizing the expressed proteins. Our findings revealed NC1-directed trimerization, forming protomers inside the cell; hexamerization, forming scaffolds outside the cell; and a Cl gradient-signaled hexamerization. This assembly detail, along with a crystal structure, provides a framework for understanding hexamer dysfunction. Restoration of the native conformation of bioactive sites and α345 hexamer replacement are prospective approaches to therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W3150589570,"As runoff patterns shift with a changing climate, it is critical to effectively communicate current and future flood risks, yet existing flood hazard maps are insufficient. Modifying, extending, or updating flood inundation extents is difficult, especially over large scales, because traditional floodplain mapping approaches are data and resource intensive. Low-complexity floodplain mapping techniques are promising alternatives, but their simplistic representation of process falls short of capturing inundation patterns in all situations or settings. To address these needs and deficiencies, we formalize and extend the functionality of the Height Above Nearest Drainage (i.e., HAND) floodplain mapping approach into the probHAND model by incorporating an uncertainty analysis. With publicly available datasets, the probHAND model can produce probabilistic floodplain maps for large areas relatively rapidly. We describe the modeling approach and then provide an example application in the Lake Champlain Basin, Vermont, USA. Uncertainties translate to on-the-ground changes to inundated areas, or floodplain widths, in the study area by an average of 40%. We found that the spatial extent of probable inundation captured the distribution of observed and modeled flood extents well, suggesting that low-complexity models may be sufficient for representing inundation extents in support of flood risk and conservation mapping applications, especially when uncertainties in parameter inputs and process simplifications are accounted for. To improve the accuracy of flood hazard datasets, we recommend investing limited resources in accurate topographic datasets and improved flood frequency analyses. Such investments will have the greatest impact on decreasing model output variability, therefore increasing the certainty of flood inundation extents."
https://openalex.org/W3138344661,"Diseases of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), such as Goodpasture's disease (GP) and Alport syndrome (AS), are a major cause of chronic kidney failure and an unmet medical need. Collagen IVα345 is an important architectural element of the GBM that was discovered in previous research on GP and AS. How this collagen enables GBM to function as a permselective filter and how structural defects cause renal failure remain an enigma. We found a distinctive genetic variant of collagen IVα345 in both a familial GP case and four AS kindreds that provided insights into these mechanisms. The variant is an 8-residue appendage at the C-terminus of the α3 subunit of the α345 hexamer. A knock-in mouse harboring the variant displayed GBM abnormalities and proteinuria. This pathology phenocopied AS, which pinpointed the α345 hexamer as a focal point in GBM function and dysfunction. Crystallography and assembly studies revealed underlying hexamer mechanisms, as described in Boudko et al. and Pedchenko et al. Bioactive sites on the hexamer surface were identified where pathogenic pathways of GP and AS converge and, potentially, that of diabetic nephropathy (DN). We conclude that the hexamer functions include signaling and organizing macromolecular complexes, which enable GBM assembly and function. Therapeutic modulation or replacement of α345 hexamer could therefore be a potential treatment for GBM diseases, and this knock-in mouse model is suitable for developing gene therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3136273607,"The formation of UV-induced DNA damage and its repair are influenced by many factors that modulate lesion formation and the accessibility of repair machinery. However, it remains unknown which genomic sites are prioritized for immediate repair after UV damage induction, and whether these prioritized sites overlap with hotspots of UV damage. We identified the super hotspots subject to the earliest repair for (6-4) pyrimidine–pyrimidone photoproduct by using the eXcision Repair-sequencing (XR-seq) method. We further identified super coldspots for (6-4) pyrimidine–pyrimidone photoproduct repair and super hotspots for cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer repair by analyzing available XR-seq time-course data. By integrating datasets of XR-seq, Damage-seq, adductSeq, and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer-seq, we show that neither repair super hotspots nor repair super coldspots overlap hotspots of UV damage. Furthermore, we demonstrate that repair super hotspots are significantly enriched in frequently interacting regions and superenhancers. Finally, we report our discovery of an enrichment of cytosine in repair super hotspots and super coldspots.

Nucleotide excision repair is a versatile repair pathway that removes a variety of bulky and helix-distorting lesions caused by DNA-damaging agents, such as UV, cisplatin, and benzo(a)pyrene (1Wood R.D.

It has two subpathways: global repair, which repairs DNA lesions throughout the whole genome, and transcription-coupled repair (TCR), which preferentially removes DNA lesions from the transcribed strand (TS) of transcriptionally active genes (3Mellon I.

Carcinogen susceptibility is regulated by genome architecture and predicts cancer mutagenesis.EMBO J. 2017; 36: 2829-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). From the perspective of 3D genome organization, UV susceptibility generally is inversely correlated with chromatin accessibility (31Garcia-Nieto P.E. Schwartz E.K. King D.A. Paulsen J. Collas P. Herrera R.E. Morrison A.J. Carcinogen susceptibility is regulated by genome architecture and predicts cancer mutagenesis.EMBO J. 2017; 36: 2829-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). At the nucleosome level, however, CPDs favor the outward-facing rotation setting in a nucleosome, and (6-4)PPs tend to form in nucleosome linker regions (12Mao P. Smerdon M.J. Roberts S.A. Wyrick J.J. Chromosomal landscape of UV damage formation and repair at single-nucleotide resolution.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Photobiol. 2017; 93: 216-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This is because the outward-facing rotation setting in a nucleosome has conformational flexibility to accommodate a CPD, and such flexibility does not alter the DNA structure dramatically. In contrast, (6-4)PP formation requires greater DNA structure distortion; the nucleosome structure has no conformational flexibility for a (6-4)PP, except in linker regions. Depending on the nature of the individual transcription factor and the DNA-damaging agent, binding of a transcription factor to DNA may stimulate, inhibit, or have no effect on DNA damage formation (14Hu J.

For repair of UV damage, the accessibility of repair machinery plays an important role. Repair occurs earlier in open chromatin regions than in repressed regions (29Adar S. Hu J. Lieb J.D. Sancar A.

We compared UV damage maps with repair maps and found that UV-induced DNA damage, measured with low depth of coverage, is uniformly distributed at a large-scale level and that the overall repair in the human genome is heterogeneous (14Hu J.

A recent study reported CPD hyper hotspots located near genes in human melanocytes and fibroblasts and suggested that these hyper hotspots may drive direct physiological changes rather than cause rare mutations (15Premi S.

Despite recent progress in DNA damage formation and repair research, it is still unknown which genomic sites are prioritized for repair immediately after UV irradiation and whether those prioritized sites overlap hotspots of DNA damage. Furthermore, determining which genomic sites are subject to nucleotide excision repair at very late stages of damage removal will offer additional insight into the question. In this study, we sought to identify these genomic sites. We performed (6-4)PP XR-seq at 1 min and 2 min after UV treatment and integrated previously published data, which include (6-4)PP XR-seq ranging from 5 min to 4 h (11Hu J. Adar S. Selby C.P.

Chem. 2019; 294: 18092-18098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) following UV irradiation. Using these methods, we identified repair super hotspots and super coldspots for (6-4)PPs and repair super hotspots for CPDs. By comparing these repair super hotspots and super coldspots with other high-throughput sequencing datasets that measure UV damage formation, we showed that neither repair super hotspots nor super coldspots overlap hotspots of UV damage. Moreover, we demonstrated that repair super hotspots are significantly enriched in both frequently interacting regions (FIREs) and superenhancers. We also found an enrichment of cytosine in both repair super hotspots and super coldspots. Our findings suggest that both local chromatin structures (e.g., transcription factor binding and previously assembled repair machinery members in the proximity of super hotspots) and large-scale chromatin features make it feasible for DNA damage to be rapidly removed in repair super hotspots. This effective integrity maintenance at repair super hotspots may confer a selective advantage. To identify which genomic sites are prioritized for nucleotide excision repair immediately after UV irradiation and which sites are subject to repair only at the latest stage of DNA damage removal, we designed an experimental and analytical framework to systematically investigate excision repair kinetics and UV damage formation over a time course. Removal of (6-4)PP occurs mainly through global repair and is completed within 4 h after UV irradiation (29Adar S. Hu J. Lieb J.D. Sancar A.

However, the removal of CPD requires both global repair and TCR, and the entire process takes days to complete (11Hu J. Adar S. Selby C.P. Lieb J.D. Sancar A.

We have shown that global repair dominates CPD removal in the first 12 min after UV irradiation in normal human skin fibroblast 1 (NHF1) cells, and then at later time points, TCR also facilitates CPD removal (22Deger N. Yang Y. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Sancar A. Selby C.P. Drosophila, which lacks canonical transcription-coupled repair proteins, performs transcription-coupled repair.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 18092-18098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To avoid the confounding effects of transcription levels and TCR, we chose to focus on global repair of CPD and thus identified prioritized genomic sites for CPD repair in the first 12 min after UV irradiation. Figure 1A shows an outline of the experimental design we used to measure excision repair kinetics and UV damage formation. Specifically, we performed (6-4)PP XR-seq at 1 and 2 min after 20 J/m2 UV treatment in NHF1 and adopted previous NHF1 XR-seq data for (6-4)PP repair at 5 min, 20 min, 1 h, 2 h, and 4 h (11Hu J.

Chem. 2019; 294: 18092-18098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Refer to Table S1 for detailed XR-seq sample information. Damage-seq for both (6-4)PPs and CPDs at 0 min in NHF1 cells (14Hu J. Adebali O. Adar S. Sancar A. Dynamic maps of UV damage formation and repair for the human genome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2017; 114: 6758-6763Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) was also included to determine the distribution of initial UV damage formation. Because release and degradation of excision products occur simultaneously and XR-seq does not measure the absolute number of excision products over time intervals (11Hu J. Adar S. Selby C.P. Lieb J.D. Sancar A.

Chem. 2013; 288: 20918-20926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), it is necessary to perform XR-seq as early as possible to identify genomic sites that are subject to excision repair immediately after UV treatment. To determine the earliest time point and the optimal number of cells suitable for (6-4)PP XR-seq, we first performed in vivo excision assay at 0 and 2 min in NHF1 cells (Fig. 1B). As shown in Figure 1B, the primary excision products, ranging from 23 to 30 nt, can be seen at 2 min, but there are no degradation products at this time point and no signal at 0 min after UV treatment. Based on this excision assay, we performed the (6-4)PP XR-seq at 1 and 2 min to identify genomic sites subject to immediate repair after UV treatment. Analyses of the two biological replicates for (6-4)PP XR-seq show high reproducibility (Fig. S1). As expected, length distribution and nucleotide frequency for reads from (6-4)PP XR-seq (1 and 2 min) and CPD XR-seq (12 min) are in agreement with previously reported data (Fig. S2) (11Hu J. Adar S. Selby C.P. Lieb J.D. Sancar A. Genome-wide analysis of human global and transcription-coupled excision repair of UV damage at single-nucleotide resolution.Genes Dev. 2015; 29: 948-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Moreover, the TS/(TS + nontranscribed strand [NTS]) repair ratios in (6-4)PP XR-seq (1 min and 4 h) are on par with that in CPD XR-seq (12 min), indicating that the vast majority of DNA damage is removed by global repair by these time benchmarks (Fig. S3) (14Hu J. Adebali O. Adar S. Sancar A. Dynamic maps of UV damage formation and repair for the human genome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2017; 114: 6758-6763Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 22Deger N. Yang Y. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Sancar A. Selby C.P. Drosophila, which lacks canonical transcription-coupled repair proteins, performs transcription-coupled repair.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 18092-18098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Using genome-wide repair data from XR-seq, we performed principal component (PC) analysis (36Jolliffe I.T. Cadima J. Principal component analysis: A review and recent developments.Philos. Trans. A Math. Phys. Eng. Sci. 2016; 374: 20150202Crossref PubMed Scopus (2493) Google Scholar) on the top 2000 highly variable genes to generate a low-dimensional representation of the data (Fig. 1C). PC analysis is a dimension reduction technique that extracts underlying structure of the data. It finds a sequence of linear combinations of the features/genes, as PCs, which have maximal variance. The first and second PCs (shown as PC1 and PC2 in Fig. 1C) are uncorrelated so that they can be uniquely estimated. Since TCR does not significantly contribute to the repair of the majority of (6-4)PPs in NHF1 cells, the first and second PCs do not differ between the TS and NTS repair. Importantly, a reconstructed repair trajectory lines up well with the time points, suggesting that repair pattern differs over the time course (Fig. 1C). We developed a computational framework to identify the early repair and late repair genomic sites by using time-course XR-seq data. Briefly, we first segmented the genome into consecutive bins of 50 bp long, then identified bins containing a significantly higher number of reads at early and late time points using a thresholding approach on the downsampled reads (Fig. S4). Figure 1D shows the distributions of read counts per genomic bin across all samples; we note enrichment of both early repair at 1 min and late repair at 4 h. In total, we identified 331 early repair genomic sites for (6-4)PP repair and 192 early repair genomic sites for CPD repair; we identified 105 late repair genomic sites for (6-4)PP repair (Tables S2–S4). These identified genomic sites are clusters of excision products, and we define the earliest-repair sites as repair super hotspots and the latest-repair sites as super coldspots. While this method was effective in identifying the top few hundred repair hotspots and coldspots, we also normalized and tested repair enrichment with a more rigorous Poisson log linear model (37Witten D.M. Classification and clustering of sequencing data using a Poisson model.Ann. Appl. Stat. 2011;"

Design This is a service evaluation adopting a qualitative approach. Setting Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted between 6 and 22 May 2020, 2 months after the introduction of the UK COVID-19 Action Plan, allowing GPs to adapt to the new changes and reflect on their impact. Participants Fourteen GPs working in NWL were interviewed, until data saturation was reached. Outcome measures The impact of COVID-19 policies on the management and safety of complex elderly patients in primary care from the GPs’ perspective. Results Participants’ average experience was fourteen years working in primary care for the NHS. They stated that COVID-19 policies have affected primary care at three levels, patients’ behaviour, work conditions, and clinical practice. GPs reflected on the impact through five major themes; four of which have been adapted from the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ) framework, changes in primary care (at the three levels mentioned above), involvement of GPs in policy making, communication and coordination (with patients and in between medical teams), stressors and worries; in addition to a fifth theme to conclude the GPs’ suggestions for improvement (either proposed mitigation strategies, or existing actions that showed relative success). A participant used an expression of “infodemic” to describe the GPs’ everyday pressure of receiving new policy updates with their subsequent changes in practice. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all levels of the health system in the UK, particularly primary care. Based on the GPs’ perspective in NWL, changes to practice have offered opportunities to maintain safe healthcare as well as possible drawbacks that should be of concern."

Although counseling related to the resumption of postpartum sexual intercourse is a key component of postpartum sexual health, it is not widely addressed during the postnatal period. Thus, this study aimed to assess the early resumption of postpartum sexual intercourse and its associated risk factors among married postpartum women who visited public hospitals of Jimma zone, Southwest Ethiopia, for child immunization services.The facility-based cross-sectional study design was undertaken, and a systematic random sampling technique was carried out to select 330 participants. Data were collected using a pretested interviewer-administered questionnaire from August to September 2019. Obtained data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. A bivariate analysis was used to determine the significance of the association. Variables that showed association in the bivariate analysis at p-value <0.2 were fitted into a multivariable logistic regression model to control for confounders, and the significance of association was determined at p-value <0.05 with a 95% confidence interval (CI).Approximately 53.9% of the respondents practiced early resumption of postpartum sexual intercourse. Factors such as low income (AOR = 0.19 (95% CI = 0.10-.37)), monogamous marriage 3.78(1.32-10.79), practicing sexual intercourse during pregnancy (AOR = 4.55 (95% CI = 1.29-15.97)), a cesarean delivery (AOR = 0.06 95%CI = (0.03-0.15)) and use of contraceptives (AOR = 3.7(95%CI = 1.92-7.14)) were significantly associated with early resumption of postpartum sexual intercourse.The findings of this study suggested that, most postpartum mothers resumed sexual intercourse during the early postpartum period and its associated risk factors include low income, monogamous marriage, practicing sexual intercourse during pregnancy, cesarean delivery, and use of contraceptives. Discussion with couples about postpartum sexual health during the antenatal and postnatal period is crucial to prevent unwanted pregnancies and adverse health outcomes."

This technology allows to define composition and orientation of the chains in the trimer (Fig. 2). The α345, α543, α343, and α545 NC1 single-chain NC1 trimers carrying the signal peptide for secretion (Fig. S1) were transiently expressed in expiCHO cells. Total cell lysates and media were analyzed for the presence of protein of interest using Western blotting (Fig. S2). Only α345 and α545 constructs were detected in the media, whereas α543 and α343 were exclusively trapped within the cells, indicating misfolding problem. Although α545 was partially secreted to the medium, the required partner, α343, was trapped within the cells. Coexpression of α343 and α545 did not rescue secretion of α343. Collectively, the single-chain α345 NC1 trimer represents native composition and orientation of chains. This is also supported by previous studies where association of individual α4 or α5 NC1 monomers with the α3 chain was selectively blocked by the mAbs (7Borza D.B. Bondar O. Todd P. Sundaramoorthy M.

The single-chain α345 NC1 trimer produced recombinantly in stably transfected HEK293 cells was purified to homogeneity (Fig. S3) and crystallized in the presence of sodium chloride. The crystal structure was solved at the 1.76 Å resolution with a single polypeptide chain per asymmetric unit (Table S1). It has the designed orientation of α chains in the order of α3-to-α4-to-α5 (Figs. 2 and 3). The atomic structure is homologous to the crystal structure of the α121 NC1 domain (5Pedchenko V. Bauer R.

Least-square superpositions of whole α345 and α121 trimers and individual chains revealed no significant variations between corresponding Cα atoms (overall r.m.s.d. 0.67 Å) (Table S2). Remarkably, α4 chain has the highest r.m.s.d. value of 2.03 Å when superposed with the α2 chain, although still in the range for highly homologous proteins (12Kufareva I. Abagyan R. Methods of protein structure comparison.Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 857: 231-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Most of the structural difference is due to presence of two extra residues, which is unique for α4 chain, within the bottom loop, making a contact with the adjacent α5 chain (Fig. 3). Superposition of α3 and α5 chains with corresponding α1 chains has only 0.55 Å and 0.54 Å r.m.s.d. values, which are typical even for identical proteins (12Kufareva I. Abagyan R. Methods of protein structure comparison.Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 857: 231-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Structures of α3 and α5 chains in the α345 NC1 trimer are also identical to the crystal structures observed in α3 and α5 homotrimers/homohexamers, r.m.s.d. of 0.55 to 0.60 Å for α3 and 0.58 Å for α5 (Table S3). Nevertheless, NC1 domains demonstrate sufficient plasticity by forming α2 homotetramer/homo-octamer and α4 homohexamer/homododecamer upon crystallization (13Casino P. Gozalbo-Rovira R. Rodriguez-Diaz J. Banerjee S. Boutaud A. Rubio V. Hudson B.G. Saus J. Cervera J. Marina A. Structures of collagen IV globular domains: Insight into associated pathologies, folding and network assembly.IUCrJ. 2018; 5: 765-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), although for the price of ∼20% and ∼10% of their inner sequences being unstructured. Superposition of the α4 structure of the α345 trimer with the structured part of α4 in the artefactual α4 homohexamer/homododecamer has r.m.s.d. values in the range 4.50 to 4.74 Å, pointing to significant variations even for the structured part (Table S3). High homology and identity of the structures of α3, α4, and α5 chains in the α345 NC1 trimer with the α1 and α2 chains in the NC1 trimer and with α3 and α5 chains in homotrimers/homohexamers also verifies the correct design of the artificial linkers connecting α3-to-α5 and α4-to-α5. All C4 subdomain linkers, native and artificially introduced, are well structured (Fig. 3C), related by a pseudohexagonal symmetry and have comparable atomic displacement factors (Fig. S8 in Supporting Section 3), which further verifies the design of artificial linkers. Analysis of the crystal structure of the single-chain α345 NC1 trimer reveals an unexpected pairing of chains at the hexamer interface. In the crystal structures of the α121 NC1, the pairing follows the rule even–even and odd–odd, that is, α2–α2 and α1–α1, which is consistent with covalent sulfilimine cross-linking of these pairs (8Vanacore R. Ham A.J. Voehler M. Sanders C.R. Conrads T.P. Veenstra T.D. Sharpless K.B. Dawson P.E. Hudson B.G. A sulfilimine bond identified in collagen IV.Science. 2009; 325: 1230-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Based on sulfilimine cross-linking analysis of the GBM α345 hexamer, the expected chain pairs were α3–α5 and α4–α4 (7Borza D.B. Bondar O. Todd P. Sundaramoorthy M. Sado Y. Ninomiya Y. Hudson B.G. Quaternary organization of the goodpasture autoantigen, the alpha 3(IV) collagen chain.

Chem. 2002; 277: 40075-40083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), although in the crystal structure, we observed α3–α3 and α4–α5 pairs. Thus, the present crystal structure of the α345 hexamer demonstrates a labile nature of a trimer–trimer orientation in the hexamer before sulfilimine cross-linking. Presumably, during crystallization process, only one particular form was selected as compatible with a given crystal packing. In support of this labile nature of the hexamer are the crystal structures of α3 and α5 homohexamers, which demonstrated alternative pairs of chains in hexamers (13Casino P. Gozalbo-Rovira R. Rodriguez-Diaz J. Banerjee S. Boutaud A. Rubio V. Hudson B.G. Saus J. Cervera J. Marina A. Structures of collagen IV globular domains: Insight into associated pathologies, folding and network assembly.IUCrJ. 2018; 5: 765-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). How nature selects one particular orientation before covalent cross-linking by sulfilimine bonds remains to be explored. In conclusion, our single-chain NC1 trimer method allowed for determination of the α345 hexamer crystal structure, a major goal that has been pursued by scientists for decades. Despite rotational mismatch of the crystallized hexamer, we discovered a set of twelve Cl- ions at the trimer–trimer interface (Fig. 4) having the same geometry as in the α121 hexamer (5Pedchenko V. Bauer R. Pokidysheva E.N. Al-Shaer A. Forde N.R. Fidler A.L. Hudson B.G. Boudko S.P. A chloride ring is an ancient evolutionary innovation mediating the assembly of the collagen IV scaffold of basement membranes.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 7968-7981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). All 12 Cl- at the trimer–trimer interface have comparable electron densities (Fig. S4) and atomic displacement factors in the range from 19.1 to 19.7 Å2, like the core residues of the polypeptide chain (Fig. 8). Together, the 12 ions form a chloride ring at the hexamer interface (Fig. 5). Analogously to the Cl- ions in the α121 hexamer, these ions form two structurally different groups (Figs. 5, S4, and Table S4). Geometry and residue specificity of Cl- coordination are identical between α345 and α121, with only one exception, that is, two-thirds of group 1 ions (four ions per hexamer) are not coordinated by the salt bridge to the arginine residue of the opposite trimer, rather identical arginine within the same trimer coordinates respective ions (Cl- ions #1–2). Potentially, the absence of these salt bridges might impact the hexamer stability of the crystallized form. The other two Cl- ions (#3) in group 1 have ‘classical’ geometry observed in the α121 hexamer with the arginine residues from the opposite trimer involved in the coordination (5Pedchenko V. Bauer R.

EA and EB loops in the α3 chain are shown in yellow and orange, respectively. 12 chloride ions (blue spheres) form a Cl- ring at the interface between two α345 trimers (left and right). B, chloride ion coordination for group 1 chloride. Group 1 chloride are responsible for introducing intramolecular salt bridges utilizing chloride coordinating Arg (R76, R300, and R525 in α3, α4, and α5 respectively). Coloring for group 1 chloride is blue shown as blue spheres, while carbon atom coloring in NC1 chains is light red for α3, light blue for α4, and light green for α5. C, chloride ion coordination for group 2 chloride. Group 2 chloride are responsible for directly bridging trimeric protomers in the collagen IV hexamer, and unlike group 1 chloride, are available for interaction with PEG molecules (PG4 and PGE). Coloring for group 2 chloride is cyan, while carbon atom coloring in PEG molecules (PG4 and PGE) is white. Chloride interactions from one NC1 molecule are shown as white dashes, while interactions from the opposite molecule are shown as black dashes. Carbon atom coloring for NC1 chains is the same as above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Chloride ions of group 2 are located in pockets and also interact with PEG molecules used for crystallization (Fig. 6C and Table S4). Although those interactions are nonspecific and weak, they point to possibility to modulate chloride binding and the hexamer assembly by specifically developed agents, which might become drugs. In summary, like the α121 hexamer, the α345 hexamer possesses two groups of chloride ions at the trimer–trimer interface forming a 12-ion ring critical for hexamer assembly and stability. The crystal structure of the α345 hexamer reveals several crevices, pockets, and inner cavities, which are large enough to accommodate small molecules (Fig. 6, A and B). Under crystallization conditions used, we observe not only chloride ions, which are physiologically relevant and critical for the hexamer assembly, but also multiple PEG molecules. As discussed earlier, the chloride ions of group 2 are sitting at the bottom of pockets, which are also occupied by PEG molecules. Chloride ions of group 2 are localized in small inner cavities, which additionally contain several structured water molecules (Fig. 6C). The central inner cavity going from one trimer to another through the hexamer interface accommodates multiple structured PEG molecules but would accommodate much larger molecules if present during protein folding or the hexamer assembly. We also found crevices between chains and between C4 subdomains within each chain. The crevices between chains are wider and occupied by PEG molecules (Fig. 6B). The crevices are close enough to the inner cavity and potentially there is a communication between these structures under physiological conditions. In support of this molecular channel is the presence of PEG molecules in the inner cavity, although the protein used for crystallization has been already in the hexamer form (addressed below). Thus, even for the fully assembled hexamer there is a mechanism of penetration of ligands into the inner cavity. The outer surface of the α345 hexamer represents a complex landscape with multiple hills and valleys. We found multiple PEG molecules interacting with the surface and some of them having contacts with two adjacent chains (Fig. S5). There are surface-exposed loops on the α345 hexamer (Fig. 7) that encompass the EA and EB regions of GP immunoreactivity (14Netzer K.O. Leinonen A. Boutaud A. Borza D.B. Todd P. Gunwar S.

The EA and EB loops (Fig. 7) demonstrate elevated mean square displacement values (Fig. 8), which reflect increased dynamic mobility of the loops. The EA loop of α5 chain is involved in crystal packing, thus having relatively lower B values (Fig. 8). Mutation analysis showed evolutionary pressure on the loop sequences, particularly on the EA loop in α2-α5 chains (Fig. S6), supporting the functional importance of these loops. One of the crevices is located between EA and EB hypoepitope loops forming loop-crevice-loop (LCL) regions at the apexes of the α345 hexamer and is juxtaposed with the T-cell receptor epitopes (18Ooi J.D.

It is located at the apex of the α3NC1 monomer, in juxtaposition with EA and EB hypoepitope loops (Fig. 9). To assess Z-appendage flexibility, a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed on the appendage in the context of a model of the α3 chain NC1 monomer. To sample all possible orientations of the appendage, 1000 initial conformations were originally generated by high-temperature MD. Each of those was extended for an additional 1 ns of simulation time at the physiological temperature, resulting in 1 μs of total MD sampling. Cysteines were reduced. Clustering analysis of the Z-appendage residues from all 1000 trajectories (using a 7 Å r.m.s.d. cutoff) revealed 134 conformational families. Within two of those 134 clusters, we found multiple conformations of the Z-appendage that had the cysteine residue positioned adjacent to the EA or EB loop disulfides. Two such conformations are shown in Figure 9, B and C. In these two conformations, the mutant cysteine is near the WT EA/EB cysteines that form an intraloop disulfide. These conformations suggest that the appendage cysteine residue may form alternative disulfides. Interference with disulfide formation and disturbing other interactions within the monomer can lead to a conformational change of the monomer and influence assembly of the hexamer. In conclusion, the Z-appendage can assume multiple conformations and its free thiol group can participate in a number of reactions including those with EA and EB epitope loops. Solving the crystal structure of the α345 hexamer allowed for 3D mapping of known Alport variants. The maps of Alport variants in the α3, α4, and α5 chains of collagen IV and their localizations within 3D structures of the α3, α4, and α5NC1 domains are shown in Figure 10 (for additional details, see Figs. S7–S9). The analysis reveals two classes of NC1 variants, that is, truncating and nontruncating. Potentially, both classes are amenable to protein replacement therapy and the nontruncating class also presents a possibility for development of small-molecule therapies. The descriptions for each variant are provided in the top part of Figs. S7–S9, according to the human genome variation society nomenclature (21den Dunnen J.T. Dalgleish R. Maglott D.R. Hart R.K.

Mutat. 2016; 37: 564-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). The Zurich variant of the α3NC1 domain stands out among other Alport variants as it results in a C-terminal extension of protein polypeptide chain producing an 8-amino acid Z-appendage as shown in Fig. S7; a variant analogous to the Zurich variant producing a 74-amino acid appendage has been identified in α5NC1 (Fig. S9). The α345 hexamer possesses multiple surface-exposed lysine (Lys) and arginine (Arg) residues (Fig. 11) that can be targeted by hyperglycemia-derived reactive carbonyl products to form stable adducts that underlie DN pathogenesis, including Lys–Lys and Lys–Arg crosslinks (22Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Maillard reaction products in tissue proteins: New products and new perspectives.Amino Acids. 2003; 25: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). There are 78 surface-exposed Lys and Arg side chains in the hexamer. Importantly, six of these residues in the α3NC1 domain and four in the α5NC1 domain are adjacent to or located on the respective EA and EB hypoepitopes (Fig. 11). The crystal structure of the α345 hexamer provided a framework to interpret a role that the Z-appendage, a representative AS variant, played in AS and as a possible structural risk factor for GP, as described in Pokidysheva et al.

They have evolved to carry out several distinct and specialized metabolic functions in a wide variety of bacteria. Their outer shell is constructed from thousands of tessellating protein subunits, encapsulating enzymes that carry out the internal metabolic reactions. The shell proteins are varied, with single, tandem and permuted versions of the PF00936 protein family domain comprising the primary structural component of their polyhedral architecture, which is reminiscent of a viral capsid. While considerable amounts of structural and biophysical data have been generated in the last 15 years, the existing functionalities of current resources have limited our ability to rapidly understand the functional and structural properties of microcompartments (MCPs) and their diversity. In order to make the remarkable structural features of bacterial microcompartments accessible to a broad community of scientists and non-specialists, we developed MCPdb: The Bacterial Microcompartment Database ( https://mcpdb.mbi.ucla.edu/ ). MCPdb is a comprehensive resource that categorizes and organizes known microcompartment protein structures and their larger assemblies. To emphasize the critical roles symmetric assembly and architecture play in microcompartment function, each structure in the MCPdb is validated and annotated with respect to: (1) its predicted natural assembly state (2) tertiary structure and topology and (3) the metabolic compartment type from which it derives. The current database includes 163 structures and is available to the public with the anticipation that it will serve as a growing resource for scientists interested in understanding protein-based metabolic organelles in bacteria."

Previously we demonstrated that PRC2, which catalyzes the methylation of histone H3K27, has an essential function in TGF-β-induced epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) of lung and pancreatic cancer cell lines. Since the cooperative activities of PRC1 and PRC2 are thought to be important for transcriptional repression in EMT program, we investigated the role of KDM2B, a member of PRC1 complex, on TGF-β-induced EMT in this study. Knockdown of KDM2B inhibited TGF-β-induced morphological conversion of the cells and enhanced cell migration and invasion potentials as well as the expression changes of EMT-related marker genes. Overexpression of KDM2B influenced the expression of several epithelial marker genes such as CDH1, miR200a, and CGN and enhanced the effects of TGF-β. Mechanistic investigations revealed that KDM2B specifically recognized the regulatory regions of CDH1, miR200a, and CGN genes and induced histone H2AK119 monoubiquitination as a component of PRC1 complex, thereby mediating the subsequent EZH2 recruitment and histone H3K27 methylation process required for gene repression. Studies using KDM2B mutants confirmed that its DNA recognition property but not its histone H3 demethylase activity was indispensable for its function during EMT. This study demonstrated the significance of the regulation of histone H2A ubiquitination in EMT process and provided the possibility to develop novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W3136390108,"Dysregulation of the developmentally important Notch signaling pathway is implicated in several types of cancer, including breast cancer. However, the specific roles and regulation of the four different Notch receptors have remained elusive. We have previously reported that the oncogenic PIM kinases phosphorylate Notch1 and Notch3. Phosphorylation of Notch1 within the second nuclear localization sequence of its intracellular domain (ICD) enhances its transcriptional activity and tumorigenicity. In this study, we analyzed Notch3 phosphorylation and its functional impact. Unexpectedly, we observed that the PIM target sites are not conserved between Notch1 and Notch3. Notch3 ICD (N3ICD) is phosphorylated within a domain, which is essential for formation of a transcriptionally active complex with the DNA-binding protein CSL. Through molecular modeling, X-ray crystallography, and isothermal titration calorimetry, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of N3ICD sterically hinders its interaction with CSL and thereby inhibits its CSL-dependent transcriptional activity. Surprisingly however, phosphorylated N3ICD still maintains tumorigenic potential in breast cancer cells under estrogenic conditions, which support PIM expression. Taken together, our data indicate that PIM kinases modulate the signaling output of different Notch paralogs by targeting distinct protein domains and thereby promote breast cancer tumorigenesis via both CSL-dependent and CSL-independent mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3145738913,"Rational Increased maternal health literacy (MHL) has contributed considerably to maternal and child health outcomes in many countries. Malnutrition, and low coverage of child vaccination and breastfeeding are major health concerns in Laos, but there is little insight into mothers’ literacy on these issues. The aim of this study was to identify the level of MHL of Lao mothers and to explore factors influencing it, in order to provide evidence that can inform policies and planning of health services. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a questionnaire on health literacy (ability to access, understand, appraise and apply health-related information) in relation to care during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period. We interviewed 384 mothers with children aged under five years; 197 from urban and 187 from rural areas. Descriptive and inferential statistics were applied to analyze the data. Results Overall, MHL of Lao mothers was very low in both urban and rural areas; 80% of mothers had either inadequate or problematic MHL, while only 17.4% had sufficient and 3.5% excellent MHL. The MHL scores were significantly higher in urban than in rural areas. One third of mothers found it very difficult to access, understand, appraise and apply information on mother and child (MCH). Health personnel were the main source of MCH information for the mothers. Years of schooling, own income, health status, and number of ANC visits significantly predicted a higher level of MHL (R square = 0.250; adjusted R square = 0.240, P = &lt;0.001). Conclusions MHL of Lao mothers was inadequate in both urban and rural areas. Socio-demographics and key practices of the mothers were significantly associated with a better level of MHL. Health education on MHL to mothers in both urban and rural areas needs attention, and could best be done by improving the quality of health providers’ provision of information."

HC-030031-treated AR mice had markedly reduced type-2 inflammation in nasal mucosa and ameliorated-nose-scratching events than AR mice received vehicle. HC-030031 treatment also dramatically reduced leucocyte numbers and IL-8 level in the BAL fluid, inhibited lower airway remodeling and fibrosis, and nearly abolished BHR. HC-0300031 treatment significantly inhibited the upregulated number of TRPA1 expressing nasal epithelial cells and TRPA1 expressing sensory neurons, leading to downregulation of SP in both upper and lower airways.

In bacteria, one of the most important and ubiquitous second messenger is the small molecule cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP). While the biosynthesis, degradation, and regulatory pathways controlled by c-di-GMP are well characterized, the mechanisms through which c-di-GMP controls these processes are not entirely understood. Herein we present the report of a c-di-GMP sensing sensor histidine kinase PdtaS (Rv3220c), which binds to c-di-GMP at submicromolar concentrations, subsequently perturbing signaling of the PdtaS-PdtaR (Rv1626) two-component system. Aided by biochemical analysis, genetics, molecular docking, FRET microscopy, and structural modelling, we have characterized the binding of c-di-GMP in the GAF domain of PdtaS. We show that a pdtaS knockout in Mycobacterium smegmatis is severely compromised in growth on amino acid deficient media and exhibits global transcriptional dysregulation. The perturbation of the c-di-GMP-PdtaS-PdtaR axis results in a cascade of cellular changes recorded by a multiparametric systems’ approach of transcriptomics, unbiased metabolomics, and lipid analyses."
https://openalex.org/W3150421191,"Mitochondrial Tu translation elongation factor (TUFM or EF-Tu) is part of the mitochondrial translation machinery. It is reported that TUFM expression is reduced in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD), suggesting that TUFM might play a role in the pathophysiology. In this study, we found that TUFM protein level was decreased in the hippocampus and cortex especially in the aged APP/PS1 mice, an animal model of AD. In HEK cells that stably express full-length human amyloid-β precursor protein (HEK-APP), TUFM knockdown or overexpression increased or reduced the protein levels of β-amyloid protein (Aβ) and β-amyloid converting enzyme 1 (BACE1), respectively. TUFM-mediated reduction of BACE1 was attenuated by translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) or α-[2-[4-(3,4-Dichlorophenyl)-2-thiazolyl]hydrazinylidene]-2-nitro-benzenepropanoic acid (4EGI1), and in cells overexpressing BACE1 constructs deleting the 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR). TUFM silencing increased the half-life of BACE1 mRNA, suggesting that RNA stability was affected by TUFM. In support, transcription inhibitor Actinomycin D (ActD) and silencing of nuclear factor κB (NFκB) failed to abolish TUFM-mediated regulation of BACE1 protein and mRNA. We further found that the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant TEMPO diminished the effects of TUFM on BACE1, suggesting that reactive oxygen species (ROS) played an important role. Indeed, cellular ROS levels were affected by TUFM knockdown or overexpression, and TUFM-mediated regulation of apoptosis and Tau phosphorylation at selective sites was attenuated by TEMPO. Collectively, TUFM protein levels were decreased in APP/PS1 mice. TUFM is involved in AD pathology by regulating BACE1 translation, apoptosis, and Tau phosphorylation, in which ROS plays an important role."
https://openalex.org/W3140241274,"Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) is an emerging technology for biomedical applications, exemplified by its antimicrobial and antineoplastic potentials. On the contrary, acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) has been a long-standing potent mitogen for cells from various origins. In this study, we are the first to develop a multimodal treatment combining the aforementioned physicochemical and pharmacological treatments and investigated their individual and combined effects on wound healing, angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and osteogenesis. This work was performed at the tissue, cellular, protein, and gene levels, using histochemical staining, flow cytometry, ELISA, and PCR, respectively. Depending on the type of target tissue, various combinations of aforementioned methods were used. The results showed that the enhancement on would healing and angiogenesis by CAP and aFGF were synergistic. The former was manifested by increased murine fibroblast proliferation and reduced cutaneous tissue inflammation, whereas the latter by upregulated proangiogenic markers in vivo, for example, CD31, VEGF, and TGF-β, and downregulated antiangiogenic proteins in vitro, for example, angiostatin and angiopoietin-2, respectively. In addition, aFGF outperformed CAP during neurogenesis, which was evidenced by superior neurite outgrowth, while CAP exceeded aFGF in osteogenesis which was demonstrated by more substantial bone nodule formation. These novel findings not only support the fact that CAP and aFGF are both multipotent agents during tissue regeneration, but also highlight the potential of our multimodal treatment combining the individual advantages of CAP and aFGF. The versatile administration route, that is, topical and/or systemic, might further broaden its applications."
https://openalex.org/W3143698923,Label-free and gentle separation of cell stages with desired target properties from mixed stage populations are a major research task in modern biotechnological cultivation process and optimization of micro algae. The reported microfluidic sorter system (MSS) allows the subsequent investigation of separated subpopulations. The implementation of a viability preserving MSS is shown for separation of late stage 1 Haematococcus pluvialis (HP) cells form a mixed stage population. The MSS combines a three-step flow focusing unit for aligning the cells in single file transportation mode at the center of the microfluidic channel with a pure hydrodynamic sorter structure for cell sorting. Lateral displacement of the cells into one of the two outlet channels is generated by piezo-actuated pump chambers. In-line decision making for sorting is based on a user-definable set of image features and properties. The reported MSS significantly increased the purity of target cells in the sorted population (94%) in comparison to the initial mixed stage population (19%).
https://openalex.org/W3137570653,"Previous work has suggested that highly positively charged protein segments coded by rare codons or poly (A) stretches induce ribosome stalling and translational arrest through electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged ribosome exit tunnel, leading to inefficient elongation. This arrest leads to the activation of the Ribosome Quality Control (RQC) pathway and results in low expression of these reporter proteins. However, the only endogenous yeast proteins known to activate the RQC are Rqc1, a protein essential for RQC function, and Sdd1, a protein with unknown function, both of which contain polybasic sequences. To explore the generality of this phenomenon, we investigated whether the RQC complex controls the expression of other proteins with polybasic sequences. We showed by ribosome profiling data analysis and western blot that proteins containing polybasic sequences similar to, or even more positively charged than those of Rqc1 and Sdd1, were not targeted by the RQC complex. We also observed that the previously reported Ltn1-dependent regulation of Rqc1 is posttranslational, independent of the RQC activity. Taken together, our results suggest that RQC should not be regarded as a general regulatory pathway for the expression of highly positively charged proteins in yeast.

Taken together, our results suggest that RQC should not be regarded as a general regulatory pathway for the expression of highly positively charged proteins in yeast. The first study to propose that the translation of positive amino acids could lead to translational stalling was published in 2008 by Lu and Deutsch (1Lu J. Deutsch C. Electrostatics in the ribosomal tunnel modulate chain elongation rates.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 384: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). It was already known that the ribosomal exit tunnel, a narrow passage through which the nascent peptide passes as soon as it is synthesized, is negatively charged (2Lu J. Kobertz W.R. Deutsch C. Mapping the electrostatic potential within the ribosomal exit tunnel.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 1378-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and that the translation of the poly (A) tail from constructs lacking a stop codon, which leads to the incorporation of lysine residues (the codon AAA translates into lysine), causes translational repression (3Frischmeyer P.A. van Hoof A. O’Donnell K. Guerrerio A.L. Parker R. Dietz H.C.

Translation of aberrant mRNAs lacking a termination codon or with a shortened 3′-UTR is repressed after initiation in yeast.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1584-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This knowledge led to the hypothesis that a high concentration of positively charged residues inside the exit tunnel could slow translation rates due to the presence of electrostatic interactions. Using a cell-free approach, Lu and Deutsch, 2008, demonstrated that the presence of lysine or arginine repeats in a protein sequence is sufficient to decrease translation rates. They observed that the presence of as few as four nonconsecutive arginines in the construct was already enough to diminish the translational speed, while an equal concentration of negatively charged or uncharged residues did not affect translation rates. This phenomenon was also observed with lysines and was independent of codon choice suggesting that the retardation effect was explicitly caused by the charge itself, not by the amino acid structure or tRNA availability (1Lu J. Deutsch C. Electrostatics in the ribosomal tunnel modulate chain elongation rates.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 384: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The ejection of nascent proteins out of the ribosome exit tunnel is also modulated by electrostatic interactions (6Nissley D.A. Vu Q.V. Trovato F. Ahmed N. Jiang Y. Li M.S. O’Brien E.P.

Rqc1 and Ltn1 also recruit Cdc48 and its cofactors, Npl4 and Ufd1, which uses the energy from ATP hydrolysis to extract the stalled ubiquitylated polypeptide from the 60S subunit leaving the 60S subunit free to engage in another round of translation (8Defenouillère Q.

However, recent studies on the global analysis of disome formation suggested that collisions are relatively common, and most of these events are resolved without translation termination (30Zhao T.

Disome-seq reveals widespread ribosome collisions that promote cotranslational protein folding.Genome Biol. 2021; 22: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). What determines whether a collision event will become a target of RQC or not is still an open question, but the disome structure, the time required to resume translation, and exposure of an empty A site seem to play an important role in this decision (31Goldman D.H.

These adaptations are thought to result in fewer ribosomes per transcript, which would avoid ribosome collisions at the stalling-prone segments, thus preventing RQC activation. In addition to the action as a salvage pathway for ribosomes stuck in unproductive translation events, it was suggested that the RQC pathway could regulate the endogenous expression of transcripts containing stalling features. This idea was put forward by an observation that Rqc1 levels increase with the deletion of ASC1, HEL2, LTN1, or RQC2, suggesting that Rqc1 protein expression could be controlled by RQC activity, providing negative feedback for the system (7Brandman O.

Rqc1 contains a well-conserved K/R polybasic sequence in its N-terminal that, when substituted by alanine residues, led to increased protein expression. Based on these data, it was suggested that the RQC complex regulates Rqc1 protein levels through its polybasic sequence during Rqc1 translation (7Brandman O. Stewart-Ornstein J. Wong D. Larson A.

More recently, the protein Sdd1, which has a polybasic sequence in its C-terminal, has been reported as another target of the RQC complex. Similar to Rqc1, the protein expression of Sdd1 was increased with the deletion of proteins of the RQC complex or with mutations that substitute the positively charged residues from its polybasic sequence to alanine residues (26Matsuo Y. Tesina P. Nakajima S. Mizuno M. Endo A. Buschauer R. Cheng J. Shounai O. Ikeuchi K. Saeki Y. Becker T. Beckmann R. Inada T. RQT complex dissociates ribosomes collided on endogenous RQC substrate SDD1.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2020; 27: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, polybasic sequences usually are RQC activators if coded by rare codons or poly-A-stretches, as recently revised in Requião et al., 2020 (37Requião R.D. Barros G.C. Domitrovic T. Palhano F.L. Influence of nascent polypeptide positive charges on translation dynamics.Biochem. J. 2020; 477: 2921-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Indeed, the polybasic sequence of SDD1 contains a CGA-CGA inhibitory codon pair (ICP) and a short poly (A) tract (26Matsuo Y. Tesina P. Nakajima S. Mizuno M. Endo A. Buschauer R. Cheng J. Shounai O. Ikeuchi K. Saeki Y. Becker T. Beckmann R. Inada T. RQT complex dissociates ribosomes collided on endogenous RQC substrate SDD1.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2020; 27: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which may explain its inhibitory property, but the polybasic sequence of Rqc1, regardless of the codon composition, is thought to be sufficient for translation termination and RQC recruitment (7Brandman O. Stewart-Ornstein J. Wong D. Larson A. Williams C.C. Li G.-W. Zhou S. King D. Shen P.S. Weibezahn J. Dunn J.G. Rouskin S. Inada T. Frost A. Weissman J.S. A ribosome-bound quality control complex triggers degradation of nascent peptides and signals translation stress.Cell. 2012; 151: 1042-1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In summary, the influence of polybasic sequences, either alone or combined with poly (A) sequences or ICP, on RQC recruitment is not yet fully established. In order to answer if other endogenous proteins with polybasic sequences would be subjected to RQC regulation, we first performed a bioinformatics screening to identify the yeast proteins containing polybasic sequences (sequences with the highest concentrations of K/R of the yeast proteome). Then, we analyzed previously published ribosome profiling experiments (26Matsuo Y. Tesina P. Nakajima S. Mizuno M. Endo A. Buschauer R. Cheng J. Shounai O. Ikeuchi K. Saeki Y. Becker T. Beckmann R.

Cell. 2020; 79: 588-602.e6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) to access the impact of polybasic sequences on the translation of these proteins. Ribosome profiling is based on the deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments (42Ingolia N.T. Brar G.A. Rouskin S. McGeachy A.M. Weissman J.S. The ribosome profiling strategy for monitoring translation in vivo by deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments.Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7: 1534-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). During translation, each ribosome encloses a portion of mRNA, protecting it against RNase digestion. This enclosure allows protected fragments to be sequenced, generating a map, at nucleotide resolution, of ribosomal occupancy on transcribed mRNAs. This map can report the occurrence of ribosome pausing or stalling, revealed by the accumulation of deep sequencing reads at specific positions of the transcript. We observed that polybasic sequences led to slower ribosome movement during translation and an increase in disome formation. However, we could not detect signatures of severe ribosome stalling, such as the presence of short (20–22 nt) mRNA fragments, which indicates empty A site in ribosomes (43Tesina P. Lessen L.N. Buschauer R. Cheng J. Wu C.C.-C. Berninghausen O. Buskirk A.R. Becker T. Beckmann R. Green R. Molecular mechanism of translational stalling by inhibitory codon combinations and poly(A) tracts.EMBO J. 2019; 39e103365PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggested that polybasic sequences of endogenous proteins do not necessarily lead to RQC complex activation, as previously described (37Requião R.D. Barros G.C. Domitrovic T. Palhano F.L. Influence of nascent polypeptide positive charges on translation dynamics.Biochem. J. 2020; 477: 2921-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). To confirm that these sequences cannot hamper the translation of endogenous proteins, we selected genes containing extremely positively charged segments, and without altering their original promoter or their 5’ UTR, we tested their protein expression in yeast strains deleted for RQC components. In this experimental setting, we could not observe an increase in their steady-state protein levels, which is usually observed with reporters containing stalling sequences. These results suggest that RQC activity does not downregulate translation of endogenous proteins with polybasic sequences in general. Our data indicate that polybasic sequences of endogenous proteins are sufficient to slow ribosome movement, but are not sufficient to induce the recruitment of the RQC complex. In the case of Rqc1, we could detect its upregulation in the ltn1Δ background, but its levels were unperturbed when the complex was disabled at upstream steps (asc1Δ, hel2Δ) or at the CATylation step (rqc2Δ). An important observation was that the deletion of LTN1 increased the expression of the full-length Rqc1, suggesting that this regulation could not be coupled to a putative stalling event at a polybasic sequence located at the N-terminal. The half-life of Rqc1 protein was much shorter in wt cells when compared with lnt1Δ cells. These results are inconsistent with the current model of Rqc1 being regulated by the RQC complex. Based on these data, we conclude that the RQC machinery is mostly dedicated to recycling ribosomes involved in aberrant mRNA translation and plays a small role in controlling endogenous levels of polybasic proteins under normal growth conditions. Moreover, we propose that Rqc1 regulation by Ltn1 is a posttranslational event, independent of the RQC activity. Our first step was to find endogenous yeast proteins containing sequences with different arrangements of polybasic sequences. We selected four distinct but possibly overlapping architectures, covering most of polybasic sequence variations analyzed in previous studies: (a) sequences of eight or more lysines/arginines residues (K/R) in a window of ten amino acids, (b) six or"
https://openalex.org/W3138133790,"Cognitive dysfunction after surgery under general anesthesia is a well-recognized clinical phenomenon in the elderly. Physiological effects of various anesthetic agents have been studied at length. Very little is known about potential effects of anesthesia on brain structure. In this study we used Diffusion Tensor Imaging to compare the white matter microstructure of healthy control subjects under sevoflurane anesthesia with their awake state. Fractional Anisotropy, a white mater integrity index, transiently decreases throughout the brain during sevoflurane anesthesia and then returns back to baseline. Other DTI metrics such as mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity and radial diffusivity were increased under sevoflurane anesthesia. Although DTI metrics are age dependent, the transient changes due to sevoflurane were independent of age and sex. Volumetric analysis shows various white matter volumes decreased whereas some gray matter volumes increased during sevoflurane anesthesia. These results suggest that sevoflurane anesthesia has a significant, but transient, effect on white matter microstructure. In spite of the transient effects of sevoflurane anesthesia there were no measurable effects on brain white matter as determined by the DTI metrics at 2 days and 7 days following anesthesia. The role of white matter in the loss of consciousness under anesthesia will need to be studied and MRI studies with subjects under anesthesia will need to take these results into account."
https://openalex.org/W3144555261,"CD44 is a transmembrane glycoprotein, the phosphorylation of which can directly trigger intracellular signaling, particularly Akt protein, for supporting cell growth, motility and invasion. This study examined the role of CD44 on the progression of Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) using metabolic profiling to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the Akt signaling pathway. Our results show that the silencing of CD44 decreases Akt and mTOR phosphorylation resulting in p21 and Bax accumulation and Bcl-2 suppression that reduces cell proliferation. Moreover, an inhibition of cell migration and invasion regulated by CD44. Similarly, the silencing of CD44 showed an alteration in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), e.g. an upregulation of E-cadherin and a downregulation of vimentin, and the reduction of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 signal. Interestingly, a depletion of CD44 leads to metabolic pathway changes resulting in redox status modification and Trolox (anti-oxidant) led to the recovery of the cancer cell functions. Based on our findings, the regulation of CCA progression and metastasis via the redox status-related Akt signaling pathway depends on the alteration of metabolic profiling synchronized by CD44."
https://openalex.org/W3147926998,"Children with Down syndrome (DS) are susceptible to two blood disorders, transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM) and Down syndrome-associated acute megakaryocytic leukemia (DS-AMKL). Mutations in GATA binding protein 1 ( GATA1 ) have been identified as the cause of these diseases, and the expression levels of the resulting protein, short-form GATA1 (GATA1s), are known to correlate with the severity of TAM. On the other hand, despite the presence of GATA1 mutations in almost all cases of DS-AMKL, the incidence of DS-AMKL in TAM patients is inversely correlated with the expression of GATA1s. This discovery has required the need to clarify the role of GATA1s in generating the cells of origin linked to the risk of both diseases. Focusing on this point, we examined the characteristics of GATA1 mutant trisomy-21 pluripotent stem cells transfected with a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible GATA1s expression cassette in a stepwise hematopoietic differentiation protocol. We found that higher GATA1s expression significantly reduced commitment into the megakaryocytic lineage at the early hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) stage, but once committed, the effect was reversed in progenitor cells and acted to maintain the progenitors. These differentiation stage-dependent reversal effects were in contrast to the results of myeloid lineage, where GATA1s simply sustained and increased the number of immature myeloid cells. These results suggest that although GATA1 mutant cells cause the increase in myeloid and megakaryocytic progenitors regardless of the intensity of GATA1s expression, the pathways vary with the expression level. This study provides experimental support for the paradoxical clinical features of GATA1 mutations in the two diseases."

Here, we describe the biochemical properties of testes (αT)-catenin, an α-catenin isoform critical for cardiac function and how intramolecular interactions regulate vinculin-binding autoinhibition. Isothermal titration calorimetry showed that αT-catenin binds the β-catenin–N-cadherin complex with a similar low nanomolar affinity to that of αE-catenin. Limited proteolysis revealed that the αT-catenin M-region adopts a more open conformation than αE-catenin. The αT-catenin M-region binds the vinculin N-terminus with low nanomolar affinity, indicating that the isolated αT-catenin M-region is not autoinhibited and thereby distinct from αE-catenin. However, the αT-catenin head (N- and M-regions) binds vinculin 1000-fold more weakly (low micromolar affinity), indicating that the N-terminus regulates the M-region binding to vinculin.

Despite a growing awareness of its importance in human disease, the molecular properties and ligand interactions of αT-catenin remain poorly understood. Our previous work revealed that αT-catenin, unlike mammalian αE-catenin, is a monomer in the solution that can bind to F-actin with low micromolar affinity in the absence of tension. F-actin binding is also not allosterically regulated, as the β-catenin–αT-catenin complex binds to F-actin with the same affinity as the αT-catenin monomer (38Wickline E.D. Dale I.W. Merkel C.D. Heier J.A. Stolz D.B. Kwiatkowski A.V. AlphaT-catenin is a constitutive actin-binding alpha-catenin that directly couples the Cadherin.Catenin complex to actin filaments.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 15687-15699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Single-molecule pulling experiments have shown the αT-catenin M-region to be mechanoresponsive as it unfurls in a force range similar to αE-catenin (47Pang S.M. Le S. Kwiatkowski A.V. Yan J. Mechanical stability of alphaT-catenin and its activation by force for vinculin binding.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2019; 30: 1930-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Here we show that αT-catenin associates with the components of the cadherin–catenin complex with an affinity similar to αE-catenin in vitro, revealing that they may compete with one another for binding β-catenin at the plasma membrane. We also show that the M-region of αT-catenin is not autoinhibited and can bind the vinculin N-terminus in the absence of tension with strong affinity. Unlike αE-catenin, however, when the N-terminus of αT-catenin is attached to the M-region, the affinity for vinculin drops significantly. This indicates that interdomain interactions between the N-terminus and the M-region of αT-catenin regulate its interaction with vinculin. We measured the recruitment of vinculin to cell–cell contacts and found that, despite the distinct mechanism of regulation, recruitment of vinculin is still tension dependent. Our findings indicate that the way in which tension regulates vinculin binding differs between αE-catenin and αT-catenin. We postulate that this mechanism is important for the ability of αT-catenin to build specific and distinct molecular complexes at AJs. We characterized the interaction between αT-catenin and β-catenin by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) using purified recombinant proteins. We used the head region (comprising the N- and M-domains) of αT-catenin (aa 1–659, Fig. 1A) for these experiments because it is more stable than full-length αT-catenin and yields sufficiently high protein concentrations for ITC. Past studies revealed that the αE-catenin head region (aa 1–651) binds β-catenin and the β-catenin–E-cadherin tail complex with a similar affinity to full-length αE-catenin (12Pokutta S. Choi H.J.

We observed that the αT-catenin head binds β-catenin with a dissociation constant ∼250 nM (Fig. 1B; Table 1). The affinity of αT-catenin for β-catenin is an order of magnitude weaker than the association of αE-catenin or αN-catenin for β-catenin (15–20 nM; (12Pokutta S. Choi H.J. Ahlsen G. Hansen S.D.

We tested if the N-cadherin tail (Ncadcyto) influences the αT-catenin–β-catenin interaction by titrating the β-catenin–Ncadcyto complex into αT-catenin head (Fig. 1C). The affinity of this interaction was 5 to 6 nM (Table 1), indicating that αT-catenin binds to the cadherin–β-catenin complex an order of magnitude more strongly than to β-catenin alone. This affinity is similar to the 1- to 2-nM affinity observed between the cadherin tail–β-catenin complex and αE-catenin or αN-catenin (12Pokutta S. Choi H.J. Ahlsen G. Hansen S.D. Weis W.I.

Full-length αT-catenin is primarily a monomer in the solution, although it does have homodimerization potential in vitro (38Wickline E.D. Dale I.W. Merkel C.D. Heier J.A. Stolz D.B. Kwiatkowski A.V.

The best evidence for dimerization potential comes from a point mutation linked to arrhythmogenic ventricular cardiomyopathy in humans, V94D, that renders αT-catenin an obligate homodimer (38Wickline E.D.

Analytical size-exclusion chromatography of αT-catenin WT N1-N2 and V94D N1-N2 revealed that WT N1-N2 eluted as a single monomer species (Fig. 2A, blue line), whereas the V94D mutant eluted as a dimer species (Fig. 2A, red line). We then analyzed the oligomeric state of the αT-catenin N-terminus by cross-linking. Increasing concentrations of αT-catenin N1-N2 were incubated with or without the cross-linker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) at 4 °C or 37 °C and the resulting products analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As expected, the αT-catenin N1-N2 migrated as a 25-kDa protein in the absence of a cross-linker (Fig. 2B). Incubation with BS3 did not affect migration at low concentrations, although at higher concentrations (4 and 8 μM), larger species were detected at both temperatures. In contrast, αT-catenin V94D N1-N2 ran as 50-kDa protein in the presence of BS3 at all concentrations tested (Fig. 2C), indicating a cross-linked dimer. We conclude that the αT-catenin N terminus, similar to full-length protein, is primarily a monomer in the solution. We then teste"

Conditions signaling the need for new blood vessel growth, such as hypoxia and low extracellular pH, increase VEGF–fibronectin interactions. These interactions can be further fine-tuned through changes in the availability of the VEGF-binding sites on fibronectin, regulated by conformational changes induced by heparin and heparan sulfate chains within the extracellular matrix. These interactions may alter VEGF bioavailability, generate gradients, or alter the way VEGF is recognized by and activates its cell-surface receptors. Here, using equilibrium and kinetic studies, we discovered that fibronectin can also interact with the extracellular domain of the VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2). The VEGFR2-binding sites on fibronectin show great similarity to the VEGF-binding sites, as they were also exposed upon heparin-induced conformational changes in fibronectin, and the interaction was enhanced at acidic pH. Kinetic parameters and affinities for VEGF and VEGFR2 binding to fibronectin were determined by surface plasmon resonance measurements, revealing two populations of fibronectin-binding sites for each molecule. Our data also suggest that a VEGF/VEGFR2/fibronectin triple complex may be formed by VEGF or VEGFR2 first binding to fibronectin and subsequently recruiting the third binding partner. The formation of such a complex may lead to the activation of distinct angiogenic signaling pathways, offering new possibilities for clinical applications that target angiogenesis.

The formation of such a complex may lead to the activation of distinct angiogenic signaling pathways, offering new possibilities for clinical applications that target angiogenesis. Fibronectin is a major protein of the extracellular matrix, with the ability to interact with a multitude of cell surface and matrix components such as integrins, collagen, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, as well as many growth factors (1Singh P.

The molecular dance of fibronectin: Conformational flexibility leads to functional versatility.Biomacromolecules. 2019; 20: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It plays a crucial role in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from the preexisting vasculature. Fibronectin null mice die early during embryonic development because of severe vascular defects (3George E.L. Baldwin H.S. Hynes R.O. Fibronectins are essential for heart and blood vessel morphogenesis but are dispensable for initial specification of precursor cells.Blood. 1997; 90: 3073-3081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in many in vivo and in vitro systems of sprouting angiogenesis, fibronectin is essential for tip cell migration (4Stenzel D. Lundkvist A. Sauvaget D. Busse M.

Additionally, fibronectin can bind vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a major regulator of angiogenesis, and directly influence its signaling output (7Mitsi M. Hong Z. Costello C.E.E.

Nugent M.A. Extracellular matrix stiffness modulates VEGF calcium signaling in endothelial cells; individual cell and population analysis.Integr. Biol. 2015; 7: 1011-1025Crossref Google Scholar). Alternative splicing generates several VEGF isoforms, containing a basic domain of increasing length, which interacts with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (10Holmes D.I.R. Zachary I. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family: Angiogenic factors in health and disease.Genome Biol. 2005; 6: 209Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Traditionally, long VEGF isoforms (e.g., VEGF206) with high heparin affinity have been considered matrix-bound, whereas the shorter isoforms (e.g., VEGF121), lacking the heparin-binding domain, have been considered completely soluble. Early studies showed that each VEGF isoform has the ability to stimulate angiogenesis in vivo, but the morphology and density of the resulting vascular network were aberrant unless the correct balance between all isoforms was maintained (11Grunstein J. Masbad J.J. Hickey R. Giordano F. Johnson R.S. Isoforms of vascular endothelial growth factor act in a coordinate fashion to recruit and expand tumor vasculature.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7282-7291Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). However, heparan sulfate proteoglycans are not the only extracellular matrix components interacting with VEGF. Fibronectin is a major binding partner for VEGF isoforms that are considered soluble (VEGF121) or exhibiting medium affinity for heparan sulfate proteoglycans (VEGF165) (7Mitsi M. Hong Z. Costello C.E.E.

The 12th-14th type III repeats of fibronectin function as a highly promiscuous growth factor-binding domain.Faseb J. 2010; 24: 4711-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Thus, when considering VEGF function, our definition of matrix-bound VEGF should be expanded to include interactions with fibronectin as well as heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Earlier studies showed that the VEGF-binding sites on fibronectin are cryptic and become exposed upon conformational changes induced by heparin (7Mitsi M. Hong Z. Costello C.E.E. Nugent M.A. Heparin-mediated conformational changes in fibronectin expose vascular endothelial growth factor binding sites.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 10319-10328Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The mechanism of heparin action in this case is fundamentally different from the known allosteric effects of heparin on other proteins, such as antithrombin and FGF, as it does not involve the formation of a ternary complex between VEGF, fibronectin, and heparin (14Mitsi M. Forsten-Williams K. Gopalakrishnan M. Nugent M.A. A catalytic role of heparin within the extracellular matrix.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 34796-34807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Instead, the fast kinetics of the heparin–fibronectin interaction allow for a structural catalysis to take place, whereby substoichiometric amounts of heparin, given enough time, can change the conformation of fibronectin within the entire matrix, by sequential binding to and releasing from neighboring fibronectin molecules. In a physiologic setting, this could be observed locally in the extracellular matrix through the action of heparan sulfate proteoglycans or alternatively, through heparin secreted by mast cells upon inflammation or any other appropriate stimulus. Consequently, such heparin/heparan sulfate-mediated changes in fibronectin conformation within the extracellular matrix will increase VEGF binding and alter its angiogenic potential. The fact that VEGF binding to the extracellular matrix is an important determinant of its biological output (15Akerman S. Fisher M. Daniel R.A. Lefley D. Reyes-Aldasoro C.C. Lunt S.J. Harris S.

However, it has been shown that matrix-bound VEGF, at the same effective amounts as soluble VEGF, in the absence of gradients activates distinct downstream signaling pathways (20Chen T.T. Luque A.

VEGF signals upon binding to cell-surface cognate receptors (VEGFRs), which belong to the family of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) and they regulate a large number of physiological processes in vascular biology (22Stuttfeld E. Ballmer-Hofer K. Structure and function of VEGF receptors.IUBMB Life. 2009; 61: 915-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). There are three known isoforms of VEGFR encoded by different genes: VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and VEGFR3. They are mainly expressed in endothelial cells and, although they share a similar overall architecture, they have significant differences in cellular localization, ligand specificity, structure, and function. VEGFR1 seems to act mostly as a decoy receptor, regulating ligand availability and the signaling strength of VEGFR2, while VEGFR3 functions are limited almost exclusively to the lymphatic system (23Roskoski Jr., R. VEGF receptor protein-tyrosine kinases: Structure and regulation.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 375: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). VEGFR2, on the other hand, is the major player in blood endothelial cell biology; it is considered one of the central players in regulating angiogenesis in a number of physiological and pathological conditions, such as embryonic development, wound healing, and cancer growth and metastasis (24Ferrara N. VEGF-A: A critical regulator of blood vessel growth.Eur. Cytokine Netw. 2009; 20: 158-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Canonical VEGF signal transduction proceeds via dimerization of VEGFR2 and propagation of conformational changes, which are not yet fully understood, but eventually lead to a precise juxtaposition and activation of the intracellular kinase domain of the receptors (22Stuttfeld E. Ballmer-Hofer K. Structure and function of VEGF receptors.IUBMB Life. 2009; 61: 915-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a series of tyrosine residues in the intracellular part of VEGFR2 become phosphorylated, initiating various signaling cascades. There is evidence that VEGFR2 signaling is modulated by various coreceptors, including integrins that interact with extracellular matrix components. Thus, matrix-bound VEGF could recruit different coreceptors to the VEGF/VEGFR2 complex, leading to distinct VEGFR2 activation patterns (25Grünewald F.S. Prota A.E. Giese A. Ballmer-Hofer K.

Role of alphavbeta3 integrin in the activation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2.Embo J. 1999; 18: 882-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Indeed, the distinct phosphorylation profile of VEGFR2 activated by immobilized VEGF involves β1 integrin-induced VEGFR2 clustering (20Chen T.T. Luque A. Lee S. Anderson S.M. Segura T. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Anchorage of VEGF to the extracellular matrix conveys differential signaling responses to endothelial cells.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 188: 595-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and numerous studies suggest extensive cross talk between αvβ3 and α5β1 integrins—the major fibronectin receptors—and VEGFR2 (29Byzova T.V. Goldman C.K. Pampori N. Thomas K.A. Bett A. Shattil S.J. Plow E.F. A mechanism for modulation of cellular responses to VEGF: Activation of the integrins.Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 851-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, complex formation between VEGF and fibronectin could bring together VEGFR and integrins into a large signaling complex leading to distinct pathway activation. The early recognition of the importance of angiogenesis for cancer growth and metastasis (30Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Angiogenesis in cancer and other diseases.Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (6991) Google Scholar), led to the development of several cancer therapeutic approaches that target the VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling axis (31Teleanu R.I. Chircov C. Grumezescu A.M. Teleanu D.M. Tumor angiogenesis and anti-angiogenic strategies for cancer treatment.J. Clin. Med. 2019; 9: 84Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, despite great promise from initial studies, their clinical outcome has been at best meagre, accompanied by severe side effects (32Lupo G. Caporarello N. Olivieri M. Cristaldi M. Motta C. Bramanti V. Avola R. Salmeri M. Nicoletti F. Anfuso C.D. Anti-angiogenic therapy in cancer: Downsides and new pivots for precision medicine.Front. Pharmacol. 2017; 7: 519Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although the ineffectiveness of antiangiogenic therapies cannot be ascribed to a single factor, considering the complexity of the biology and clinical manifestation of cancer, it certainly highlights the need to draw a more complete picture of the mechanisms underlying VEGFR2 activation and signaling. In particular, targeting specifically matrix-bound VEGF and the interactions that hold the VEGF/VEGFR2 complex together may offer exciting new opportunities for the design of more specific and effective drugs (33Finley S.D. Popel A.S. Predicting the effects of anti-angiogenic agents targeting specific VEGF isoforms.AAPS J. 2012; 14: 500-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important for both basic research and clinical applications to understand the dynamic interactions between VEGF, VEGFR2, and fibronectin. In this study, we discovered that the catalytic effect of heparin on fibronectin structure exposes also binding sites for the extracellular domain (ECD) of VEGFR2. Equilibrium and kinetic studies revealed that ECD binding and VEGF binding to fibronectin followed a very similar pattern and were enhanced at acidic pH. We found that the affinity of ECD for fibronectin was higher than that of VEGF. Furthermore, VEGF and ECD could bind simultaneously to fibronectin. Such binding events could influence the activation of VEGF/VEGFR2 complexes, as well as the formation of higher-order complexes with other cell-surface receptors and extracellular matrix proteins, regulating angiogenesis in health and disease. To study the interactions between fibronectin and the angiogenic factors VEGF165 (termed VEGF for simplicity) and ECD in a simple and fast way that would not require protein labeling, we developed an ELISA-based solid-phase binding assay. Fibronectin was adsorbed on 96-well plates and allowed to interact with the ligand (VEGF or ECD) until equilibrium was reached. The fraction of the ligand that was specifically bound to fibronectin was then extracted with a solution of high ionic strength (5 M NaCl), adsorbed onto a second 96-well plate, and detected using a primary antibody against the ligand and a corresponding HRP-labeled secondary antibody. The signal was detected by luminescence. The ligand extraction step was necessary because of the high levels of VEGF nonspecific binding, which could not be reduced by blocking agents either added in the binding buffer or adsorbed on the plate. The steps for the assay optimization are described in Figs. S1–S6. Using this assay, we evaluated the binding of VEGF and ECD to surface-immobilized fibronectin. VEGF binding followed the same pattern as previously reported, with higher binding occurring at acidic pH only after fibronectin was treated with heparin (Fig. 1A). The measured values reflect the VEGF fraction specifically bound to fibronectin, since no VEGF was extracted from the naked substrate or from adsorbed bovine serum albumin (BSA). Interestingly, a very similar binding pattern was observed with ECD (Fig. 1B). For both ligands, significant binding was observed at pH 5.5 after incubating the surface-immobilized fibronectin with heparin. Thus, we chose this condition to further analyze the protein interactions. Dose–response experiments showed that ECD binding to surface-immobilized fibronectin reached saturation at significantly lower concentrations than those for VEGF, suggesting that ECD binds to fibronectin with higher affinity than VEGF (Fig. 1, C and D). This conclusion is further reinforced if we consider that the binding was performed with equal masses for the two ligands, which, given the difference in molecular weight between VEGF (45 kDa) and ECD (83 kDa), means lower molarity for ECD. We did not attempt to calculate affinities at this stage, because of the many intermediate assay steps between the binding event and the final measurement. However, we observed significantly lower luminescence values for ECD than for VEGF (Fig. 2). These differences could originate from different recognition of VEGF and ECD by the primary antibody and/or different degrees of adsorption of the two proteins. Indeed, calibration curves revealed different signals for the same amount of VEGF and ECD, which depended on both the ionic strength of the buffer and the protein concentration (Fig. S6). Taken all this into account, it appears that ECD possesses higher affinity for fibronectin than VEGF, but the absolute amount of VEGF and ECD bound to fibronectin cannot be determined by this experimental setup. Since VEGF and ECD bind to fibronectin following a very similar pattern, we wanted to elucidate whether they share the same binding sites and if their binding is mutually exclusive. To do so, we compared the combined binding of VEGF and ECD to fibronectin when they were added simultaneously or sequentially, using an anti-His antibody that can recognize both ligands (as they both contain a His-tag; see Experimental Procedures) or an anti-VEGFR2 antibody that recognizes specifically ECD (Fig. 2). We confirmed that both the anti-His and anti-VEGFR2 antibodies could detect their respective ligands when bound individually to fibronectin. When both VEGF and ECD were added to fibronectin, the signal detected by the anti-His antibody was always higher than if VEGF or ECD was added alone, irrespectively of the order of ligand addition, suggesting that their binding to fibronectin is not mutually exclusive. The anti-VEGFR2 antibody detected the presence of ECD under all conditions, except when ECD was added before VEGF. Since no binding scenario predicts the complete absence of ECD under this condition (Fig. S7), this result suggests that when fibronectin-bound ECD is allowed to interact with VEGF as well, the epitope for this particular antibody is masked. The only possibility consistent with all these observations is that VEGF and ECD are likely to share binding sites on fibronectin, and when bound to fibronectin, they retain their ability to recognize each other and lead to the formation of a VEGF/ECD/fibronectin triple complex (Fig. S7). Both VEGF and ECD could be released from fibronectin by changing the pH from 5.5 to 7.5, even if the ionic strength of the extraction solution was not increased (Fig. 3A). Indeed, gradually increasing the ionic strength of the extraction buffer did not result in higher release (Fig. S8). This suggests that the interaction depends on pH-sensitive amino acids. The release was very fast, occurring within a few minutes after buffer change. Interestingly, longer extraction times led to a decrease in the amount of released VEGF or ECD (Fig. 3B), which may be the result of ligand readsorption (Fig. S8). Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of VEGF and ECD were acquired at pH 7.5 and pH 5.5 (Fig. 4). The ionic strength of the buffer prevented data collection below 205 nm, and at low ionic strength buffers, the structure of VEGF was altered, suggesting significant unfolding (Fig. S9). Therefore, the spectra could not be subjected to structure deconvolution with certainty, especially, since both VEGF and ECD are beta-sheet dominated and the CD spectra of beta-sheet proteins show significant variability, rendering their deconvolution problematic (34Micsonai A. Wien F. Kernya L. Lee Y.H. Goto Y. Réfrégiers M. Kardos J. Accurate secondary structure prediction and fold recognition for circular dichroism spectroscopy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015; 112: E3095-E3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). However, the spectra at pH 7.5 and 5.5 were very similar, suggesting that the pH does not cause a major change in the protein secondary structure. If there is a pH-sensitive conformational change of VEGF and ECD, it should be slight or local. Therefore, it is more likely that the increased binding observed at pH 5.5 would depend on the protonation state of critical amino acids in the binding site rather than large conformational changes. We decided to further study this point, by computing the pH dependance of the protonation state of surface amino acids for both the ligands (VEGF and ECD) and the domain of fibronectin where the binding is likely to happen (FNIII 12–14) (7Mitsi M. Hong Z. Costello C.E.E. Nugent M.A. Heparin-mediated conformational changes in fibronectin expose vascular endothelial growth factor binding sites.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 10319-10328Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Based on the known structures of VEGF and ECD, we calculated the pKa values of surface-exposed amino acids (35Wang L. Zhang M. Alexov E. DelPhiPKa web server: Predicting pKa of proteins, RNAs and DNAs.Bioinformatics. 2016; 32: 614-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and we identified several residues with a pKa value between 5.5 and 7.5, whose protonation state would change between these two pH values (Table 1) and thus, could belong to the fibronectin-binding sites on each molecule. In the case of ECD, most of the candidate residues were His residues, which often function as pH sensors (36Watanabe H. Yoshida C. Ooishi A. Nakai Y. Ueda M. Isobe Y. Honda S.

Chem. 2009; 284: 12373-12383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Whereas for ECD almost all candidate residues seem to be free of interactions with the ligand, the majority of the pH-sensitive residues on VEGF were on the receptor-binding domain and were involved in interactions in the VEGF dimer or between VEGF and the receptor, leaving free of interactions only a His residue at the C-terminal domain of VEGF. However, since full-length structures are lacking for both VEGF and ECD, these results should be interpreted with caution since prediction of pKa values is very sensitive to the local environment of the amino acid (39Di Russo N.V. Estrin D.A. Martí M.A. Roitberg A.E. pH-dependent conformational changes in proteins and their effect on experimental pK(a)s: The case of Nitrophorin 4.PLoS Comput.

Because of the pH sensitivity of His residues, we would like to mention that experiments with nontagged VEGF conducted in an earlier study showed the same binding profile (7Mitsi M. Hong Z. Costello C.E.E. Nugent M.A. Heparin-mediated conformational changes in fibronectin expose vascular endothelial growth factor binding sites.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 10319-10328Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Moreover, His-tagged VEGF-E showed no binding to heparin-treated fibronectin at acidic pH (data not shown). These observations support the conclusion that the His tag in the recombinant proteins used in this study is unlikely to affect the enhanced binding observed at acidic pH.Table 1Surface-exposed amino acid residues on VEGF and ECD predicted to change protonation state between pH 7.5 and 5.5Protein domainResiduepKaProtonation probabilityFree of interactionspH 5.5pH 7.5VEGFReceptor-binding domainArg236.820.9940.074NoLys846.460.9730.017NoHis866.330.9630.012NoGlu936.370.9670.015NoHeparin-binding domainHis1255.960.8470.002YesECDDomain1–domain2 linkerArg1226.460.9800.020YesHis1336.520.9800.020YesDomain2Arg1766.350.9700.010YesGlu2016.370.9700.010YesDomain3His2326.330.9600.010Yes"

Methods A prospective, observational study was undertaken from September 2017 to December 2017. Data on socio-demographic features, aetiology of trauma, type of ocular injury pre-referral pathway and treatment of ocular trauma was collected as the exposure variables. The main outcome variable was best corrected visual acuity at 8 weeks following initial visit. Results A total of 102 patients (103 eyes) with ocular trauma were recruited with loss of follow up of 11 participants at 8 weeks following recruitment. The most affected age group were children under 11 years old (35.3%), followed by young adults of age between 21–30 years (22.5%). The male-to-female ratio for ocular injury was 2.8:1. Most participants had closed globe injuries (n = 72, 70.6%), with over half the population injured by blunt objects (n = 62, 60.8%). Furthermore, among the adult population, majority (n = 19 38%) were injured on the road during assaults (n = 24, 48%), while most paediatric injuries (n = 32, 61.5%) occurred at home during play. The incidence of monocular blindness was 25.3% at eight weeks after the first presentation. Factors that were associated with monocular blindness on multivariate analysis were living in rural areas and open globe injuries. Conclusion Ocular trauma led to monocular blindness in a quarter of the study population. There is need for preventive education of ocular injuries at both family and community level."

The literature revealed that Knowledge of ORS packet or pre-packaged liquids is a very important and critical factor for the utilization of ORS during the management of diarrhea.We used the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey data, which is the fourth survey conducted by the Central Statistical Agency. A total weighted sample of 7590 reproductive-age women who gave birth within five years preceding the survey was used. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was done to assess factors associated with knowledge of ORS packet or pre-packaged liquids. Arc GIS version 10.3 and Kuldorff's SaTScan version 9.6 software were used for the spatial analysis.In the multilevel analysis maternal education, media exposure, residence, community illiteracy level, and region were significantly associated with knowledge of ORS packet or pre-packaged liquids. Besides, knowledge of ORS packet or pre-packaged liquids for the management of diarrhea was not random in Ethiopia (with Moran's Index = 0.46 and p-value <0.001), and the primary clusters spatial window was located in SNNPR, most parts of the Oromia region, and eastern parts of the Gambela region.In this study knowledge of ORS packet or pre-packaged liquids was not random across the country. Lack of formal education, lack of media exposure, being from a rural area, and being from communities with a higher illiteracy level was associated with lower odds of knowledge of ORS packet or pre-packaged liquids. Therefore, special emphasis should be given to these high-risk groups and the hot spot regions (SNNPR, most parts of the Oromia region, and eastern parts of the Gambela region). Moreover, distributing information through different media regarding ORS packet or pre-packaged liquids is necessary."

This newborn ecosystem is related to the sustainable development of hydropower projects, and has become a new problem to be studied urgently. Taking WLFZs in the Huangdeng, Xiaowan and Nuozhadu Reservoirs in the Lantsang River Basin as study areas, this study used multi-spectral remote-sensing field data obtained with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to ascertain the species types, coverage, distribution characteristics, dominant species and pioneer species of naturally restored vegetation. The considered data were subjected to UAV data processing, vegetation classification using multi-spectral images and a geographic information system (GIS) terrain-distribution analysis. Results show that: Polygonum Plebeium, Cynodon dactylon, Xanthium sibiricum, Ageratum conyzoides, Eleusine indica, Digitaria sanguinalis and Verbena officinalis are the dominant species of vegetation that could be naturally restored in the WLFZ; the vegetation coverage and the number of species are significantly positively correlated with the age and restoration periods of the WLFZ; the vegetation coverage of each study area increases at first, and then decreases, as a function of elevation; gentle slopes about 0–25°are more suitable for vegetation restoration. This study provides first-hand data on the natural restoration of vegetation in WLFZs, and gives a useful reference for its ecological restoration as a consequence of hydropower cascade development in the Lantsang River Basin. Finally, the study demonstrates that light UAV remote sensing is an attractive choice for investigating vegetation in reservoir WLFZs."

Blood indicators of immune responses were assessed from samples collected before 0 (W0), and 3 (W3), and 6 weeks (W6) after pigs transfer to their respective hygiene of housing conditions. Plasma haptoglobin concentrations and blood neutrophil granulocyte numbers were greater in poor than in good hygiene of housing conditions at W3. Plasma concentrations of total immunoglobulin G were greater ( p = 0.04) in poor than in good hygiene of housing conditions at W6. At W6, pigs were fitted with an intravenous catheter for serial blood samplings. Low-RFI pigs had greater insulin ( p &lt; 0.001) and lower triglyceride ( p = 0.04) average plasma concentrations than HRFI pigs in both conditions. In poor hygiene of housing conditions, the peaks of insulin and glucose were observed earlier and that of insulin was greater in LRFI than in HRFI pigs. Irrespective of genetic line, average plasma concentrations of histidine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, threonine, valine, and alanine were greater in poor compared with good hygiene of housing conditions. Only HRFI pigs had greater lysine, asparagine, proline, and tyrosine plasma concentrations in poor than in good hygiene of housing conditions. Conversely, arginine, tryptophan, proline, and tyrosine plasma concentrations were lower only for LRFI pigs housed in poor hygiene conditions. Our results suggest that, contrary to HRFI, LRFI pigs increase or maintain their utilization of tryptophan, arginine, and lysine when housed in poor hygiene conditions. This indicates that this difference may contribute to the better capacity of LRFI to cope with poor hygiene of housing conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3151554162,"With increasing livestock numbers, competition and avoidance are increasingly shaping resource availability for wild ungulates. Shifts in the dietary niche of wild ungulates are likely and can be expected to negatively affect their fitness. The Mongolian Gobi constitutes the largest remaining refuge for several threatened ungulates, but unprecedentedly high livestock numbers are sparking growing concerns over rangeland health and impacts on threatened ungulates like the Asiatic wild ass (khulan). Previous stable isotope analysis of khulan tail hair from the Dzungarian Gobi suggested that they graze in summer but switch to a poorer mixed C3 grass / C4 shrub diet in winter, most likely in reaction to local herders and their livestock. Here we attempt to validate these findings with a different methodology, DNA metabarcoding. Further, we extend the scope of the original study to the South Gobi Region, where we expect higher proportions of low-quality browse in the khulan winter diet due to a higher human and livestock presence. Barcoding confirmed the assumptions behind the seasonal diet change observed in the Dzungarian Gobi isotope data, and new isotope analysis revealed a strong seasonal pattern and higher C4 plant intake in the South Gobi Region, in line with our expectations. However, DNA barcoding revealed C4 domination of winter diet was due to C4 grasses (rather than shrubs) for the South Gobi Region. Slight climatic differences result in regional shifts in the occurrence of C3 and C4 grasses and shrubs, which do not allow for an isotopic separation along the grazer-browser continuum over the entire Gobi. Our findings do not allow us to confirm human impacts upon dietary preferences in khulan as we lack seasonal samples from the South Gobi Region. However, these data provide novel insight into khulan diet, raise new questions about plant availability versus preference, and provide a cautionary tale about indirect analysis methods if used in isolation or extrapolated to the landscape level. Good concordance between relative read abundance of C4 genera from barcoding and proportion of C4 plants from isotope analysis adds to a growing body of evidence that barcoding is a promising quantitative tool to understand resource partitioning in ungulates."
https://openalex.org/W3138188841,"Excess circulating human growth hormone (hGH) in vivo is linked to metabolic and growth disorders such as cancer, diabetes, and acromegaly. Consequently, there is considerable interest in developing antagonists of hGH action. Here, we present the design, synthesis, and characterization of a 16-residue peptide (site 1-binding helix [S1H]) that inhibits hGH-mediated STAT5 phosphorylation in cultured cells. S1H was designed as a direct sequence mimetic of the site 1 mini-helix (residues 36-51) of wild-type hGH and acts by inhibiting the interaction of hGH with the human growth hormone receptor (hGHR). In vitro studies indicated that S1H is stable in human serum and can adopt an α-helix in solution. Our results also show that S1H mitigates phosphorylation of STAT5 in cells co-treated with hGH, reducing intracellular STAT5 phosphorylation levels to those observed in untreated controls. Furthermore, S1H was found to attenuate the activity of the hGHR and the human prolactin receptor, suggesting that this peptide acts as an antagonist of both lactogenic and somatotrophic hGH actions. Finally, we used alanine scanning to determine how discrete amino acids within the S1H sequence contribute to its structural organization and biological activity. We observed a strong correlation between helical propensity and inhibitory effect, indicating that S1H-mediated antagonism of the hGHR is largely dependent on the ability for S1H to adopt an α-helix. Taken together, these results show that S1H not only acts as a novel peptide-based antagonist of the hGHR but can also be applied as a chemical tool to study the molecular nature of hGH-hGHR interactions."

Microcomputed tomography demonstrated that BGLAP-Cre;RosaNotch3 and Dmp1-Cre;RosaNotch3 mice of both sexes exhibited an increase in trabecular bone and in connectivity, with a decrease in cortical bone and increased cortical porosity. Histological analysis revealed a decrease in osteoclast number and bone resorption in trabecular bone and an increase in osteoclast number and void or pore area in cortical bone of RosaNotch3 mice. Bone formation was either decreased or could not be determined in Cre;RosaNotch3 mice. NOTCH3 activation in osteoblasts inhibited Alpl (alkaline phosphatase) and Bglap (osteocalcin) and induced Tnfsf11 (RANKL) and Tnfrsf11b (osteoprotegerin) mRNA, possibly explaining the trabecular bone phenotype.

NOTCH3 activation in osteoblasts inhibited Alpl (alkaline phosphatase) and Bglap (osteocalcin) and induced Tnfsf11 (RANKL) and Tnfrsf11b (osteoprotegerin) mRNA, possibly explaining the trabecular bone phenotype. However, NOTCH3 induced Tnfsf11 and suppressed Tnfrsf11b in osteocytes, possibly explaining the cortical porosity. In conclusion, basal NOTCH3 is dispensable for skeletal homeostasis, whereas activation of NOTCH3 in osteoblasts/osteocytes inhibits osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption in cancellous bone but increases intracortical remodeling and causes cortical porosity. Notch receptors (NOTCH1 to 4) determine cell fate and function in a variety of cell lineages including those present in bone tissue (1Fortini M.E.

Interactions of specific regions of the extracellular domain of Notch with ligands of the Jagged and Delta-like families lead to the exposure of the negative regulatory region (NRR) and its cleavage by ADAM metalloproteases and the γ-secretase complex (5Sanchez-Irizarry C.

Although Notch receptors are activated following interactions with their ligands, a degree of basal activation is possible, particularly in the case of NOTCH3 (13Choy L. Hagenbeek T.J. Solon M.

Although the four Notch receptors share structural and functional properties, each receptor retains its own identity. This is in part because of their preferential expression in certain cellular environments, interactions with specific Notch ligands, and various degrees of basal activation (3Canalis E. Notch in skeletal physiology and disease.Osteoporos.Int. 2018; 29: 2611-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).

Although NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 have been studied extensively for their effects on bone remodeling, less is known regarding the role of NOTCH3 in skeletal physiology. Recently, we created a mouse model harboring a Notch3 mutation designed to reproduce the functional outcome of lateral meningocele syndrome and termed Notch3em1Ecan (synonym Notch3tm1.1Ecan) (16Canalis E.

Notch3em1Ecan mice exhibit a modest NOTCH3 gain of function, osteopenia, and high bone remodeling indicating that NOTCH3 plays a role in skeletal metabolism. However, to establish the function of NOTCH3 in bone, it is important to define the consequences of wildtype NOTCH3 activation on the skeleton and to determine the skeletal phenotype of mice harboring a Notch3 inactivation. In the present work, we attempted to define the role of NOTCH3 by establishing the consequences of its misexpression on bone remodeling. For this purpose, we obtained Notch3 null and RosaNotch3 mice, where a loxP-flanked STOP cassette was cloned into the Rosa26 locus upstream of sequences coding for the Notch3 NICD (20Lafkas D. Rodilla V. Huyghe M. Mourao L. Kiaris H. Fre S. Notch3 marks clonogenic mammary luminal progenitor cells in vivo.J. Cell Biol. 2013; 203: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because Notch3 is expressed by osteoblasts/osteocytes, RosaNotch3 mice were crossed with transgenics expressing Cre under the control of the bone gamma-carboxyglutamate protein (BGLAP, osteocalcin) or the dentin matrix protein 1 (Dmp1) promoter (21Zhang M.

DMP1-targeted Cre expression in odontoblasts and osteocytes.J. Dent. Res. 2007; 86: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The phenotype of mice misexpressing NOTCH3 was established by microcomputed tomography (μCT) and histomorphometry and possible mechanisms involved were explored. To study the consequences of the inactivation of Notch3 in the skeleton, we obtained global Notch3 null mice from the Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Centers (MMRC) and examined their phenotype following intercrosses of heterozygous Notch3−/+ mice. Although the intent was to compare Notch3−/− with littermate sex-matched wildtype controls, the yield of the expected genotype (25%) and sex-matching made littermate comparisons not always possible, so that it was necessary to compare mice from different but related litters. Notch3−/− mice had a healthy appearance, and their weight and femoral length were comparable with those of control mice (Fig. 1). Notch3 mRNA levels in tibiae from Notch3−/− mice were undetectable. Femoral microarchitecture, determined by μCT, of 1- and 4-month-old male Notch3−/− mice revealed no differences in trabecular or cortical bone when compared with control sex-matched mice of the same age (Table 1, Fig. 2). μCT of 1-month-old female mice revealed no alterations in either cancellous or cortical bone when compared with control mice (Table 1). Femoral bone microarchitecture of 4-month-old female Notch3−/− mice demonstrated a modest decrease in trabecular thickness and density of material in cancellous bone and a mild decrease in cortical bone thickness and area.Table 1Femoral microarchitecture assessed by microcomputed tomography of 1- and 4-month-old Notch3 null male and female mice and sex- and age-matched controlsMales1 Month4 MonthsControlNotch3−/−ControlNotch3−/−Distal femur trabecular bonen = 6n = 5n = 9n = 5 Bone volume/total volume (%)7.1 ± 1.56.9 ± 0.79.1 ± 2.88.9 ± 0.8 Trabecular separation (μm)250 ± 21258 ± 28222 ± 11216 ± 16 Trabecular number (1/mm)4.1 ± 0.33.9 ± 0.34.5 ± 0.24.6 ± 0.3 Trabecular thickness (μm)31 ± 231 ± 139 ± 637 ± 2 Connectivity density (1/mm3)208 ± 27209 ± 17159 ± 20184 ± 33 Structure model index2.4 ± 0.12.4 ± 0.12.2 ± 0.42.2 ± 0.1 Density of material (mg HA/cm3)759 ± 26747 ± 32871 ± 13856 ± 22Femoral midshaft cortical bonen = 7n = 5n = 10n = 6 Bone volume/total volume (%)97.0 ± 1.795.8 ± 4.699.9 ± 0.199.9 ± 0.0 Porosity (%)3.0 ± 4.74.2 ± 4.60.1 ± 0.160.1 ± 0.0 Cortical thickness (μm)77 ± 371 ± 5171 ± 10167 ± 7 Total area (mm2)1.4 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.21.7 ± 0.21.6 ± 0.1 Bone area (mm2)0.3 ± 0.10.3 ± 0.10.7 ± 0.10.7 ± 0.1 Periosteal perimeter (mm)4.1 ± 0.14.0 ± 0.34.6 ± 0.24.5 ± 0.1 Endocortical perimeter (mm)3.6 ± 0.13.5 ± 0.23.5 ± 0.23.4 ± 0.1 Density of material (mg HA/cm3)927 ± 32905 ± 581188 ± 201179 ± 40 p Moment of inertia (mm4)0.126 ± 0.020.103 ± 0.020.321 ± 0.070.288 ± 0.04Females1 Month4 MonthsControlNotch3−/−ControlNotch3−/−Distal femur trabecular bonen = 9n = 9n = 7n = 5 Bone volume/total volume (%)6.4 ± 0.96.8 ± 1.24.1 ± 0.63.3 ± 1.0 Trabecular separation (μm)282 ± 26268 ± 27311 ± 34332 ± 40 Trabecular number (1/mm)3.6 ± 0.33.8 ± 0.43.3 ± 0.43.0 ± 0.4 Trabecular thickness (μm)32 ± 132 ± 235 ± 331 ± 1aSignificantly different between control and Notch3−/−, p < 0.05 by unpaired t test.

Values means ± SD. To determine whether NOTCH3 had a direct effect in cells of the osteoblast lineage, bone marrow stromal cells from Notch3 null and control mice were isolated and cultured to confluence (5–7 days) prior to study (day 0). The inactivation of Notch3 did not result in appreciable changes in the Notch target genes Hey1, Hey2, and HeyL or in the expression of Notch1, Notch2, and Notch4 when compared with control cultures (Fig. 3). mRNA levels of Alpl and Bglap (osteocalcin) were stable throughout the culture period, and Alpl, Bglap, Tnfsf11 (RANKL), and Tnfrsf11b (osteoprotegerin) were not significantly different between Notch3−/− mice and controls. In addition, there was a modest increase in mineralized nodules as control cultures progressed but no difference in the formation of mineralized nodules in cultures from Notch3 null mice when compared with controls (Fig. 3). Because Notch3 is prominently expressed by osteocytes and because these cells play a major role in the regulation of bone remodeling through the RANKL/osteoprotegerin axis, we examined for the expression of Notch target genes and Tnfsf11 and Tnfrsf11b in osteocyte-rich preparations from Notch3−/− and control mice (15Zanotti S. Canalis E. Parathyroid hormone inhibits Notch signaling in osteoblasts and osteocytes.Bone. 2017; 103: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Xiong J. O'Brien C.A.

The osteocyte: An endocrine cell and more.Endocr. Rev. 2013; 34: 658-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). The inactivation of Notch3 did not alter the expression of the Notch target genes Hey1, Hey2, HeyL, or Hes1 and did not have an effect on Tnfsf11 (RANKL) or Tnfrsf11b (osteoprotegerin) mRNA levels compared with control wildtype cells (not shown). To induce the conditional activation of NOTCH3 in cells of the osteoblast lineage, homozygous RosaNotch3 mice were mated with heterozygous BGLAP-Cre or Dmp1-Cre mice so that approximately half of the pups would express NOTCH3 NICD (Cre+;RosaNotch3) and approximately half would serve as controls (RosaNotch3). Cre-mediated recombination of loxP sites flanking the STOP cassette was documented in extracts from tibiae of 1-month-old mice. The general appearance of BGLAP-Cre;RosaNotch3 or Dmp1-Cre;RosaNotch3 was normal, and their weight and femoral length were not significantly different from those of control littermates (Figs. 4 and 5).Figure 5Weight, femoral length, validation of loxP recombination, and representative microcomputed tomography images of 1-month-old male and female Dmp1-Cre;RosaNotch3 mice.

The trabecular and cortical bone of the distal metaphyses of BGLAP-Cre;RosaNotch3 and Dmp1-Cre;RosaNotch3 mice were not clearly distinguishable, suggesting defective or delayed bone corticalization (25Walker E.C.

At mid-diaphysis, cortical bone volume and cortical thickness were decreased and the cortex appeared porous in BGLAP-Cre;RosaNotch3 and Dmp1-Cre;RosaNotch3 mice of both sexes (Tables 2 and 3, Figs. 4 and 5). Polar moment of inertia was decreased in Dmp1-Cre;RosaNotch3 mice, suggesting decreased bone strength, although the effect was significant only in male mice, and it was not observed in BGLAP-Cre;RosaNotch3 mice (26Bagi C.M.

There were no major sex differences in the phenotype observed, and skeletal microarchitecture was affected similarly in male and female BGLAP-Cre;RosaNotch3 and Dmp1-Cre;RosaNotch3 mice. There was a distortion of the normal skeletal microarchitecture in both cortical and cancellous compartments of experimental mice. However, periosteal perimeter, width, and anteroposterior length of the metaphysis of BGLAP-Cre;RosaNotch3 and Dmp1-Cre;RosaNotch3 mice were not different from controls (Tables 2 and 3).Table 2Femoral microarchitecture and dimensions assessed by microcomputed tomography of 1-month-old BGLAP-Cre;RosaNotch3 male and female mice and sex-matched littermate controlsTrabecular and cortical boneMalesFemalesControl n = 9Cre+/−;RosaNotch3 n = 6Control n = 12Cre+/−;RosaNotch3 n = 7Distal femur trabecular bone Bone volume/total volume (%)13.0 ± 2.622.4 ± 3.9bSignificantly different between control and Cre+/−;RosaNotch3, p < 0.05 by unpaired t test.9.7 ± 1.623.5 ± 7.2bSignificantly different between control and Cre+/−;RosaNotch3, p < 0.05 by unpaired t test.

https://openalex.org/W3140731355,"Although an aberrant reduction in pancreatic β-cell mass contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetes, the mechanism underlying the regulation of β-cell mass is poorly understood. Here, we show that diacylglycerol kinase δ (DGKδ) is a key enzyme in the regulation of β-cell mass. DGKδ expression was detected in the nucleus of β-cells. We developed β-cell-specific DGKδ knockout (βDGKδ KO) mice, which showed lower blood glucose, higher plasma insulin levels, and better glucose tolerance compared to control mice. Moreover, an increased number of small islets and Ki-67-positive islet cells, as well as elevated cyclin B1 expression in the islets, were detected in the pancreas of βDGKδ KO mice. DGKδ knockdown in the β-cell line MIN6 induced significant increases in bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and cyclin B1 expression. Finally, we confirmed that streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia and β-cell loss were alleviated in βDGKδ KO mice. Thus, suppressing the expression or enzymatic activity of DGKδ that functions as a suppressor of β-cell proliferation could be a novel therapeutic approach to increase β-cell mass for the treatment of diabetes."

We present the first carriage study in children in Buenos Aires, Argentina, considering 2017 as a transition year. Aims: to assess the rate of Nm carriage, to determine genogroup, clonal complex and outer membrane protein distribution, to determine carriage risk factors by age. Methods Cross-sectional study including children 1–17 yrs, at Ricardo Gutiérrez Children’s Hospital in Buenos Aires 2017. Oro-pharyngeal swabs were taken and cultured within a short time after collection. Genogroup was determined by PCR and clonal complex by MLST. Categorical variables were analyzed. Results A total of 1,751 children were included. Group 1: 943 children 1–9 yrs, 38 Nm were isolated; overall carriage 4.0%. Genogroup distribution: B 26.3%, W 5.3%, Y 2.6%, Z 5.3%, other groups 7.9% and capsule null (cnl) 52.6%. Participating in extracurricular activities was the only independent predictor of Nm carriage. Group 2: 808 children 10–17 yrs, 76 Nm were isolated; overall carriage 9.4%. Genogroup distribution: B 19.7%, C 5.3%, W 7.9%, Y 9.2%, Z 5.3%, other groups 7.9% and cnl 44.7%. Independent predictors of carriage: attending pubs/night clubs and passive smoking (adjusted OR: 0.55, 95%CI = 0.32–0.93; p = 0.025). Conclusions Overall carriage was higher in 10–17 yrs. The isolates presenting the cnl locus were prevalent in both age groups and genogroup B was the second most frequent."
https://openalex.org/W3150001307,"Previous research has shown that challenge and hindrance job demands show different effects on employees' wellbeing and performance. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that employees' subjective appraisal of job demands as challenges and hindrances may vary: they can be appraised as challenges or hindrances or both. Subjective appraisal of job demands was found to be also related to employees' wellbeing and productivity. However, little is known about predictors of the appraisals of job demands made by employees. The aim of the study was to identify predictors of such appraisals among job and individual resources. Cross-sectional research was carried out among 426 IT, healthcare and public transport employees. COPSOQ II scales were used to measure job demands (emotional, quantitative, cognitive demands, work pace and role conflicts) and job resources (influence at work, possibilities for development, vertical and horizontal trust), single questions were used to measure employees' subjective appraisals of job demands as hindrances and challenges, and PCQ was used to measure psychological capital. Multiple hierarchical regression analyses showed that only horizontal trust predicted the appraisal of job demands as challenges, and vertical trust predicted the appraisal of job demands as hindrances among four analysed job resources. Individual resource-psychological capital-predicted only the appraisal of job demands as challenges. Control variables-occupation, age and job demands also played a significant role in predicting the appraisal of job demands. Implications and future directions are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3151186571,"Background Survivors of stroke are often deconditioned and have limited opportunities for exercise post-rehabilitation. Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR), a structured exercise program offered post-cardiac event in the United States (U.S.), may provide an opportunity for continued exercise. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of integrating survivors of stroke into an existing, hospital-based CR program through an assessment of (1) recruitment, uptake and retention, (2) adherence and fidelity, (3) acceptability and (4) safety. Methods A mixed methods design combined a single group, pre-post design, pilot feasibility study with an imbedded qualitative inquiry. Survivors of stroke were recruited into a standard 12-week, 36 visit CR program. Results Fifty-three survivors were referred, 29 started and 24 completed the program. Program uptake rate was 55% and completion rate was 83%. Eleven completers and one non-completer participated in the qualitative interviews. Program completers attended an average of 25.25 (SD 5.82) sessions with an average of 38.93 (SD 5.64) exercise minutes per session while reaching targeted rate of perceived exertion levels. Qualitative themes included perceived benefits of an individualized program in a group setting, positive interactions with qualified staff, opportunities for socialization, and regular monitoring and staff attentiveness promoting feelings of safety. Conclusions Survivors of stroke were able to meet Medicare standard dosage (frequency and session duration) and rate of perceived intensity goals, and perceived the program as needed regardless of their mobility limitations or previous exercise experience. Primary challenges included managing referrals and uptake. Results support feasibility and benefit for survivors to integrate into U.S. CR programs."
https://openalex.org/W3145556129,"The inhibitory signaling of CD200 receptor 1 (CD200R) has been attributed to its NPxY signaling motif. However, NPxY-motifs are present in multiple protein families and are mostly known to mediate protein trafficking between subcellular locations rather than signaling. Therefore, we investigated whether additional motifs specify the inhibitory function of CD200R. We performed phylogenetic analysis of the intracellular domain of CD200R in mammals, birds, bony fish, amphibians and reptiles. Indeed, the tyrosine of the NPxY-motif is fully conserved across species, in line with its central role in CD200R signaling. In contrast, P295 of the NPxY-motif is not conserved. Instead, a conserved stretch of negatively charged amino acids, EEDE279, and two conserved residues P285 and K292 in the flanking region prior to the NPxY-motif are required for CD200R mediated inhibition of p-Erk, p-Akt308, p-Akt473, p-rpS6 and LPS-induced IL-8 secretion. Altogether, we show that instead of the more common NPxY-motif, CD200R signaling can be assigned to a unique signaling motif in mammals defined by: EEDExxPYxxYxxKxNxxY."
https://openalex.org/W3138982380,"House dust mites (HDMs) are a potent allergen source that are commonly found in human living environments. While HDMs are known to induce allergic diseases in humans, such as asthma, its other biological activities related to human health are less understood. Our laboratory recently purified the HDM protein PDI (protein disulfide isomerase). In this study, we assess the role of PDI in contributing to immune regulation. Using mass spectrometry, we analyzed the complexes of DEC205 and HDM extracts, and the role of PDI in the induction of tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs) was assessed in human cell culture experiments and verified in a murine model. We found that more than 20 HDM-derived proteins, including PDI, bound to DCs by forming complexes with DEC205. Additionally, DEC205-mediated the endocytosis of PDI. HDM-derived PDI (HDM-PDI) promoted Foxp3 expression in DCs. HDM-PDI-primed DCs also showed tolerogenic properties that induced regulatory T cell development, indicating that the primed DCs were tolerogenic DCs. Our results suggested that the PDI/DEC205/TIEG1/Foxp3 signal pathway activation was involved in the HDM-PDI-induced Foxp3 expression in DCs. Finally, we found that HDM-PDI competitively counteracted the Th2 cytokines to restore DC’s tolerogenicity, and administration of HDM-PDI could suppress experimental asthma.

These findings demonstrate that HDM-PDI has translational potential to be used in the treatment of immune disorders such as asthma. The immune tolerance indicates a condition that the immune system in the body does not respond to immune stimulation that should be. It is extremely important to maintain the immune tolerance system function properly in the body as it plays a crucial role in the maintenance of the homeostasis in the body. Many immune cells, such as tolerogenic dendritic cells (TolDC), regulatory T cells (Treg), and regulatory B cells (Breg), and cytokines, such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and interleukin (IL)-10, have been recognized in association with immune tolerance (1Alroqi F.J. Chatila T.A. T regulatory cell Biology in health and disease.Curr. Allergy Asthma Rep. 2016; 16: 27Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The dysfunctional immune tolerance system is involved in many diseases, for example, the Treg deficiency elicits autoimmunity and heritable diseases of immune dysregulation (1Alroqi F.J. Chatila T.A. T regulatory cell Biology in health and disease.Curr. Allergy Asthma Rep. 2016; 16: 27Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This mirrors an important fact that it has not fully understood the induction and maintenance of immune tolerance in the body. House dust mite (HDM) extensively distributes to human living environment. It is well known that HDM is the major allergen of allergic asthma (2Wilson J.M. Platts-Mills T.A.E. Home environmental Interventions for House dust mite.J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. Pract. 2018; 6: 1-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). HDM can induce aberrant Th2 response, the latter further induces specific IgE production to sensitize mast cells; re-exposure to specific antigens induces mast cells to release allergic mediators to trigger asthma attacks (2Wilson J.M. Platts-Mills T.A.E. Home environmental Interventions for House dust mite.J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. Pract. 2018; 6: 1-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, besides being allergens to induce allergic diseases, other features of HDM related to human health are less understood. Our previous studies show that one of HDM components, phthalein proline cis/trans isomerase peptidyl-prolylisomerases (Pplase), has immune suppressive effects on airway allergic response (3Wang H. Mo L. Xiao X. An S. Liu X. Ba J. Wu W. Ran P. Yang P. Liu Z. Pplase of Dermatophagoides farinae promotes ovalbumin-induced airway allergy by modulating the functions of dendritic cells in a mouse model.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 43322Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), suggesting not all the HDM components are allergens, some of them may be of benefit to human beings. Thus, in the present study, we assessed the effects of HDM-derived factors on regulating DC activities. We found that the HDM-derived PDI (protein disulfide isomerase) could induce TolDCs. PDI is an enzyme that catalyzes disulfide formation and isomerization. With disulfide bonds, PDI contributes to individual protein stable or proteins joined covalently with each other in a mechanism of chemically cross-linked specific cysteines (4Wilkinson B. Gilbert H.F. Protein disulfide isomerase.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1699: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). PDI is associated with cancer pathology (5Stopa J.D. Zwicker J.I. The intersection of protein disulfide isomerase and cancer associated thrombosis.Thromb. Res. 2018; 164: S130-S135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), vascular inflammation (6Cho J. Protein disulfide isomerase in thrombosis and vascular inflammation.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2013; 11: 2084-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), or immune disorder pathogenesis (7Hoffman S.M. Chapman D.G. Lahue K.G. Cahoon J.M. Rattu G.K. Daphtary N. Aliyeva M. Fortner K.A. Erzurum S.C. Comhair S.A. Woodruff P.G. Bhakta N. Dixon A.E. Irvin C.G. Janssen-Heininger Y.M. et al.Protein disulfide isomerase-endoplasmic reticulum resident protein 57 regulates allergen-induced airways inflammation, fibrosis, and hyperresponsiveness.J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2016; 137: 822-832.e827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The present study expanded the above findings about PDI by showing that HDM-derived PDI (PDI, in short) has immune regulatory effects. It is a consensus that HDM is the major source of allergen to trigger allergic asthma (2Wilson J.M. Platts-Mills T.A.E. Home environmental Interventions for House dust mite.J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. Pract. 2018; 6: 1-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). DCs play a central role in the initiation of the immune response. Thus, it is of significance to further elucidate the interaction between HDM and DCs. To this end, we isolated DCs from healthy human blood samples (Fig. 1A). DCs were cultured in the presence of HDM extracts for 3 h. The DCs were harvested; proteins were extracted from the cells and analyzed by immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-HDM pAb as a bait, followed by using anti-mouse Ab as the IP Ab. The IP complexes were purified and analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). The MS results (Fig. 1B) showed that 27 HDM-derived proteins formed the complexes with DEC205 protein (Table S1 in supplementary materials), in which 25 allergens have been characterized by previous studies (references are presented in the table); one is PPlase that we characterized previously (3Wang H. Mo L. Xiao X. An S. Liu X. Ba J. Wu W. Ran P. Yang P. Liu Z. Pplase of Dermatophagoides farinae promotes ovalbumin-induced airway allergy by modulating the functions of dendritic cells in a mouse model.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 43322Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar); another is the PDI (Table S1). As Haffman et al reported that ERp57 (one of PDI phenotypes) levels were significantly increased in airway epithelial cells of asthma patients and mice with experimental airway allergy and proposed that ERp57 plays a role in the pathogenesis of airway allergy (7Hoffman S.M. Chapman D.G. Lahue K.G. Cahoon J.M. Rattu G.K. Daphtary N. Aliyeva M. Fortner K.A. Erzurum S.C. Comhair S.A. Woodruff P.G. Bhakta N. Dixon A.E. Irvin C.G. Janssen-Heininger Y.M. et al.Protein disulfide isomerase-endoplasmic reticulum resident protein 57 regulates allergen-induced airways inflammation, fibrosis, and hyperresponsiveness.J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2016; 137: 822-832.e827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we assessed the interaction between HDM-derived PDI and human DCs. Based on the gene sequence (Table S3) we reported in our previous studies (8Chan T.F. Ji K.M. Yim A.K. Liu X.Y. Zhou J.W. Li R.Q. Yang K.Y. Li J. Li M. Law P.T. Wu Y.L. Cai Z.L. Qin H. Bao Y. Leung R.K. et al.The draft genome, transcriptome, and microbiome of Dermatophagoides farinae reveal a broad spectrum of dust mite allergens.J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2015; 135: 539-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), we asked a biotech company (Sangon Biotech Inc, Shanghai, China) to produce the PDI protein through the molecular cloning approach with the E. coli system (the recombinant protein quality was verified by the company; the sequence verification is shown in Table S3) to be used in the present study. The PDI was used to coat ELISA plates to assess the PDI-specific IgE levels in serum samples obtained from 30 asthma patients who sensitized to HDM as shown by skin test (Table S2). The results showed that none of the 30 serum samples had detectable PDI-specific IgE (Fig. 1C). The results suggest that HDM-derived PDI is not an allergen. We further found that PDI formed a complex with DEC205 in DCs by co-IP assay, in which both DEC205 and PDI could be precipitated by either anti-DEC205 Ab or anti-PDI Ab (Fig. 1, D and E). To corroborate the results, we isolated DEC205+ DCs (Fig. 1, F and G) from healthy human blood samples to expose to FITC-labeled PDI in the culture for 3 h. We observed that PDI bound more than 50% DEC205+ DCs (Fig. 1, H and I), but not CD4+ T cells (Fig. 1, J and K); the binding was abolished by knocking down DEC205 in DCs (Fig. 1, H, I and L). The results suggest that PDI may modulate DC’s properties. We then tested if HDM-derived PDI could induce airway allergy. BALB/c mice were immunized with PDI/Alum following established procedures (9Zhang H.P. Sun Y.X. Lin Z. Yang G. Liu J.Q. Mo L.H. Geng X.R. Song Y.N. Zeng H.T. Zhao M. Li G.S. Liu Z.G. Yang P.C. CARsomes inhibit airway allergic inflammation in mice by inducing antigen-specific Th2 cell apoptosis.Allergy. 2020; 75: 1205-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). As compared with mice immunized with the ovalbumin (OVA)/Alum procedures, which show asthma-like symptoms, including airway hyperresponsiveness, high levels of serum specific IgE (sIgE), IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, high major basic protein (MBP) in BALF (bronchoalveolar lavage fluids), high frequency of eosinophil in BALF, and airway epithelial barrier dysfunction, which did not occur in mice immunized with PDI/Alum (Fig. 2). The data confirm that HDM-derived PDI is not an allergen. We then tested if PDI modulated DC’s properties. DEC205+ DCs were isolated from healthy human blood samples and exposed to PDI in the culture for 3 days. We found that the Foxp3 and TGF-β expression in DCs was markedly induced by PDI as well as by CpG (a positive control (10Volpi C. Fallarino F. Pallotta M.T. Bianchi R. Vacca C. Belladonna M.L. Orabona C. De Luca A. Boon L. Romani L. Grohmann U. Puccetti P. High doses of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides stimulate a tolerogenic TLR9-TRIF pathway.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 3, A–F). We also observed that exposure to CpG induced the expression of other immune tolerogenic factors, including PDL1, IDO, and IL-10, in DCs, but not in PDI-stimulated DCs (Fig. 3, G–L). Since the TGF-β expression indicates the tolerogenic feature of DCs (11Esebanmen G.E. Langridge W.H.R. The role of TGF-beta signaling in dendritic cell tolerance.Immunol. Res. 2017; 65: 987-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the results suggest that exposure to PDI induces TolDCs. To verify this, CD4+ CD25- T cells were isolated from the naïve mouse spleen and cocultured with PDI-primed DCs for 3 days. As analyzed by flow cytometry (FCS), coculture with PDI-primed DCs markedly increased the expression of Foxp3 and TGF-β in CD4+ T cells (Fig. 3, M–O). The results indicate that PDI-primed DCs can induce regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation. These Tregs showed immune-suppressive effects on CD4+ T cell proliferation (Fig. 3, P–Q). The data demonstrate that PDI can induce TolDCs, the latter induces Tregs. TIEG1 is associated with the Foxp3 expression in T cells (12Peng D.J. Zeng M. Muromoto R. Matsuda T. Shimoda K. Subramaniam M. Spelsberg T.C. Wei W.Z. Venuprasad K. Noncanonical K27-linked polyubiquitination of TIEG1 regulates Foxp3 expression and tumor growth.J. Immunol. 2011; 186: 5638-5647Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We wondered if TIEG1 was also involved in the PDI-induced Foxp3 expression in DCs. To this end, after exposure to PDI, DC protein extracts were analyzed by co-IP with anti-TIEG1 Ab or anti-PDI Ab as a bait. The results showed that a complex of PDI/TIEG1 was detected in the extracts by using either anti-PDI Ab or anti-TIEG1 Ab as the IP Ab (Fig. 4, A and B). Further analysis showed that the phosphorylated TIEG1 levels were upregulated in DCs by PDI exposure (Fig. 4C). The increase in TIEG1 was detected in the Foxp3 promoter (Fig. 4D). Depletion of TIEG1 also abolished the PDI-induced TolDC development. The results indicate that the DEC205/PDI/TIEG1 signal pathway is required in the PDI-induced TolDC development. IL-4 plays a central role in Th2-dominant inflammation such as asthma. In a synergistic manner, IL-4 and TGF-β induce the IL-9 production; the latter also plays an important role in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases (13Koch S. Sopel N. Finotto S. Th9 and other IL-9-producing cells in allergic asthma.Semin. Immunopathol. 2017; 39: 55-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We wondered if IL-4 could cooperate with the TGF-β in TolDCs to initiate the IL-9 production within the cells that compromise the TolDC properties. To this end, we exposed TolDCs to IL-4 in the culture. We found that IL-4 prevented the TGF-β production by TolDCs, instead, IL-4 induced TolDCs to produce IL-9, which was abolished by the depletion of DEC205 (Fig. 5A). The results suggest that IL-4 contacts TolDCs via DEC205 to induce the IL-9 production that prompted us to add PDI to the TolDC culture first, then IL-4. As expected, the IL-4 addition did not induce TolDCs to produce IL-9 (Fig. 5B). The results indicate that the PDI-occupying DEC205 can block IL-4 to bind DEC205 in DCs, suggesting a competitive relation between IL-4 and PDI in binding DEC205 on DC. PDI alone did not induce the IL-9 expression in DCs (Fig. 5B). Adding IL-4 to the TolDC culture first, then adding PDI in a ratio of 1:10 or 1:100 (IL-4:PDI; wt:wt), to the culture, no apparent inhibitory effects were found on the IL-9 production by TolDCs. However, increase in the dosage of PDI to 1:1000 showed inhibitory effects on the IL-9 production (Fig. 5C) as well as restored the TGF-β production (Fig. 5D). The results suggest that PDI may be used to restore the TolDCs’ function in allergic diseases by recovering DCs’ immune tolerogenic functions. Finally, we developed a mouse model of asthma (Fig. 6A). The mice showed asthma-like symptoms, including hyperresponsiveness in the airways. High levels of specific IgE, Th2 cytokines, major basic proteins, high frequency of eosinophils in BALF (Figs. 6, S1 and S2), and increase in the epithelial barrier permeability. Administration of PDI (Fig. 6A) efficiently attenuated the asthma symptoms, restored TolDCs and Tregs in the lungs, which was abolished by depletion of DCs (Figs. 6, S1–S3). The results demonstrate that PDI can alleviate experimental asthma. This study found a previously undescribed phenomenon that HDM-derived PDI contributed to immune regulation by activating the PDI/DEC205/TIE2 signal pathway to induce the Foxp3 expression in DCs. Since Foxp3 is the transcription factor of TGF-beta, the latter is a critical effective factor of immune regulation, the data suggest that the interaction between PDI and DCs can confer DCs the immune tolerogenic properties. Indeed, PDI-primed DCs could induce Treg generation. Administration of PDI efficiently alleviated the experimental asthma. Our previous work showed that more than 20,000 active genes were identified in HDM (8Chan T.F. Ji K.M. Yim A.K. Liu X.Y. Zhou J.W. Li R.Q. Yang K.Y. Li J. Li M. Law P.T. Wu Y.L. Cai Z.L. Qin H. Bao Y. Leung R.K. et al.The draft genome, transcriptome, and microbiome of Dermatophagoides farinae reveal a broad spectrum of dust mite allergens.J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2015; 135: 539-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Among these gene products, over 20 allergens have been identified (14Cui Y. Wang Q. Jia H. Consideration of methods for identifying mite allergens.Clin. Transl Allergy. 2018; 8: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Thus, the functions of majority of HDM body components have not been fully characterized yet. In fact, not all the HDM-derived proteins are allergens; some components may have different functions. For example, the HDM-derived PPlase protein has the immune-suppressive function (3Wang H. Mo L. Xiao X. An S. Liu X. Ba J. Wu W. Ran P. Yang P. Liu Z.

Thus, it is worthy to further characterize the properties of those unanalyzed HDM-derived proteins. We found that DEC205 molecule mediated the interaction between PDI and DCs. DEC205 is an endocytic receptor on DCs and thymus epithelial cells (15Jiang W. Swiggard W.J. Heufler C. Peng M. Mirza A. Steinman R.M. Nussenzweig M.C. The receptor DEC-205 expressed by dendritic cells and thymic epithelial cells is involved in antigen processing.Nature. 1995; 375: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Some exogenous molecules can bind DEC205 to regulate DC’s activities. For example, DEC205 can mediate the effects of cartilage proteoglycan on modulating DC’s activities to elicit the immune regulatory activities that alleviate experimental arthritis (16Spiering R. Margry B. Keijzer C. Petzold C. Hoek A. Wagenaar-Hilbers J. van der Zee R. van Eden W. Kretschmer K. Broere F. DEC205+ dendritic cell-Targeted tolerogenic Vaccination promotes immune tolerance in experimental Autoimmune arthritis.J. Immunol. 2015; 194: 4804-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). By MS approach, we found over 20 HDM-derived proteins bound to DEC205 including PDI, among which the known allergens have been described (14Cui Y. Wang Q. Jia H. Consideration of methods for identifying mite allergens.Clin. Transl Allergy. 2018; 8: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) except PDI. By employing the serum obtained from asthma patients with HDM sensitization as well as tested in a murine model, we found that PDI was not an allergen as no PDI-specific IgE was detectable in the HDM-specific IgE positive serum and PDI could not induce experimental airway allergy. We in turn found that PDI had immune regulatory activities. By exposing naïve DCs to PDI in the culture, both Foxp3 and TGF-β were detected in those DCs. Since TGF-β is an important immune regulatory cytokine (17Sanjabi S. Oh S.A. Li M.O. Regulation of the immune response by TGF-β: From Conception to autoimmunity and Infection.Cold Spring Harb Perspect. Biol. 2017; 9: a022236Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), the data indicate that PDI can induce TolDCs. This was verified by further experimental data that the PDI-induced TolDCs could generate Tregs. Although many studies found that IL-10-producing DCs were TolDCs, TGF-β-producing DCs were also found as a fraction of TolDC that was detailed by a review paper (11Esebanmen G.E. Langridge W.H.R. The role of TGF-beta signaling in dendritic cell tolerance.Immunol. Res. 2017; 65: 987-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The TGF-β-producing TolDCs naturally exist in the body; such as a portion of mesentery lymph node–derived CD103+ DCs express TGF-β; their immune regulatory functions can be promoted by retinoic acid, a dietary metabolite (18Coombes J.L. Siddiqui K.R. Arancibia-Cárcamo C.V. Hall J. Sun C.M. Belkaid Y. Powrie F. A functionally specialized population of mucosal CD103+ DCs induces Foxp3+ regulatory T cells via a TGF-beta and retinoic acid-dependent mechanism.J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 1757-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar). The TGF-β-producing TolDCs also can be induced, such as exposure to TGF-β can induce CD14+ monocytes with granulocyte–monocyte colony stimulating factor, IL-4, and TGF-β to TGF-β-producing TolDCs (19Abediankenari S. Ghasemi M. Generation of immune inhibitory dendritic cells and CD4+T regulatory cells inducing by TGF-beta.Iran J. Allergy Asthma Immunol. 2009; 8: 25-30PubMed Google Scholar). Our data provide a novel mechanism for TGF-β-producing TolDCs by exposing DEC205+ DCs to PDI in the culture. Our data show that PDI promotes the Foxp3 expression in DCs. The key point in the induction of TGF-β expression is that the Foxp3 expression must be activated first as Foxp3 is the transcription factor of TGF-β (20Kanamori M. Nakatsukasa H. Okada M. Lu Q. Yoshimura A. Induced regulatory T cells: Their development, Stability, and Applications.Trends Immunol. 2016; 37: 803-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The present data show that PDI has such a function; by inducing TIEG1, the transcription factor of Foxp3, phosphorylation, PDI activates the Foxp3 expression in DCs. PDI has multiple functions. Fox examples, it activates platelets to promote thrombosis and induces vascular inflammation (6Cho J. Protein disulfide isomerase in thrombosis and vascular inflammation.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2013; 11: 2084-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). PDI is also associated with the survival, proliferation, and metastasis of several cancers (21Lee E. Lee D.H. Emerging roles of protein disulfide isomerase in cancer.BMB Rep. 2017; 50: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These features need to be considered in further investigations in PDI studies. The data show that IL-4 and PDI competently bind DEC205 to modulate TolDC’s activities. Exposure to IL-4 induces TolDCs to produce IL-9 instead of TGF-β. IL-9 is one of the Th2 cytokines that plays a role in the pathogenesis of Th2 pattern inflammation such as allergic asthma (13Koch S. Sopel N. Finotto S. Th9 and other IL-9-producing cells in allergic asthma.Semin. Immunopathol. 2017; 39: 55-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). IL-4 in synergy with TGF-β initiates the IL-9 expression (13Koch S. Sopel N. Finotto S. Th9 and other IL-9-producing cells in allergic asthma.Semin. Immunopathol. 2017; 39: 55-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). TolDCs produce TGF-β. Thus, it is logical that exposure to IL-4 induces TolDCs to produce IL-9. Fortunately, such a status can be modulated by exposing the TolDCs to higher PDI concentrations. This suggests that administration of PDI may restore DC’s tolerogenic function in certain environment such as allergic asthma. Indeed, this inference was verified by an experimental asthma model. Administrating PDI efficiently alleviated airway allergic inflammation in a mouse model via restoring TolDC and Treg numbers in the lungs. One of the previous studies indicates that human airway epithelial cells also express PDI (7Hoffman S.M. Chapman D.G. Lahue K.G. Cahoon J.M. Rattu G.K. Daphtary N. Aliyeva M. Fortner K.A. Erzurum S.C. Comhair S.A. Woodruff P.G. Bhakta N. Dixon A.E. Irvin C.G. Janssen-Heininger Y.M. et al.Protein disulfide isomerase-endoplasmic reticulum resident protein 57 regulates allergen-induced airways inflammation, fibrosis, and hyperresponsiveness.J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2016; 137: 822-832.e827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The levels of PDI are increased in airway epithelial cells of asthma patients. The paper suggests that PDI contributes to fibrosis in the airway tissues. Depletion of the PDI expression could not induce airway allergy in mice (7Hoffman S.M. Chapman D.G. Lahue K.G. Cahoon J.M. Rattu G.K. Daphtary N. Aliyeva M. Fortner K.A. Erzurum S.C. Comhair S.A. Woodruff P.G. Bhakta N. Dixon A.E. Irvin C.G. Janssen-Heininger Y.M. et al.Protein disulfide isomerase-endoplasmic reticulum resident protein 57 regulates allergen-induced airways inflammation, fibrosis, and hyperresponsiveness.J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2016; 137: 822-832.e827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), whereas our data show that PDI can alleviate experimental asthma. Such a difference between this report and the present study may be because that study and our project focus on different cell types. Hoffman et al observed PDI in airway epithelial cells; the present study investigated into the role of PDI in regulating DC’s tolerogenic properties. On the other hand, the similarity of PDI amino acid sequence between HDM and human is 27% (AAC50401.1) and 44% (CAA89996.1), respectively; the molecular structures are different between HDM PDI and human PDI. Furthermore, we treated mice with PDI by nasal instillation, which resulted in improvement of the epithelial barrier function. The fact demonstrates that exposure to PDI does not impair the airway epithelial barrier function; instead, it makes it better. It should be mentioned that there are several subtypes of PDI in mammals; some of them can promote the development of allergic disorders such as asthma (7Hoffman S.M. Chapman D.G. Lahue K.G. Cahoon J.M. Rattu G.K. Daphtary N. Aliyeva M. Fortner K.A. Erzurum S.C. Comhair S.A. Woodruff P.G. Bhakta N. Dixon A.E. Irvin C.G. Janssen-Heininger Y.M. et al.Protein disulfide isomerase-endoplasmic reticulum resident protein 57 regulates allergen-induced airways inflammation, fibrosis, and hyperresponsiveness.J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2016; 137: 822-832.e827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The present study shows a PDI from HDM. By analyzing the amino acid sequence of PDI between HDM and human, the similarity is 44%. This may be the basis of functional difference between the HDM-derived PDI and human PDI. In summary, the present data show that HDM-derived PDI can contribute to immune tolerance by inducing TolDCs and restoring TolDCs’ functions in an allergic environment. Administration of PDI can efficiently alleviate experimental airway allergy. The data suggest that PDI may have translation potential for the treatment of airway allergy. The use of human tissues and animals in the present study was approved by the Human and Animal Ethical Committee at Shenzhen University. The human studies were abided by the Declaration of Helsinki principles. Peripheral blood samples (20 ml per person) were obtained from human subjects by ulnar vein puncture. Mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from blood samples by the gradient Percoll density centrifugation. PBMCs were stained with fluorochrome-labeled Abs of CD45, CD11c, and CD103. CD11c+ CD103+ DCs were purified by FCS. Purity of isolated DCs was greater than 96% as assessed by FCS. The DCs were used in further experiments. Following established procedures (22Lin J. Huang N. Li J. Liu X. Xiong Q. Hu C. Chen D. Guan L. Chang K. Li D. Tsui S.K. Zhong N. Liu Z. Yang P.C. Cross-reactive antibodies against dust mite-derived enolase induce neutrophilic airway inflammation.Eur. Respir. J. 2021; 57: 1902375Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), BALB/c mice were immunized with ovalbumin (OVA; 0.1 mg/mouse in 0.1 ml Alum) through subcutaneous injection on the back skin on day 0 and day 7, respectively. The mice were boosted by nasal instillation with OVA solution (50 μl per nostril; 5 mg/ml) daily from day 14 to day 23. Mice were sacrificed on day 23. The asthma symptoms were assessed with the procedures as we reported previously. Asthma mice were treated with PDI solution (5 mg/ml) through nasal instillation (50 μl/nostril) daily from day 24 to day 30. Mice were challenged with OVA (50 mg/ml) via nasal instillation (50 μl/nostril) followed by asthma symptom assessment. Mice were peritoneal injection with diphtheria toxin (DT; 0.5 μg/mouse) in 0.1 ml saline. The injection was repeated once 2 days later. Each experimental group consisted of six mice. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate (the average of three readouts was used as one datum). The data are presented as mean ± SEM. The difference between two groups was determined by the Student’s t-test. ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test or Bonferroni test was performed for multiple comparisons. p < 0.05 was set as a significant criterion.

https://openalex.org/W3142017860,"1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] plays a role in calcium homeostasis but can also exert immunomodulatory effects. In lungs, characterized by a particular immunosuppressive environment primarily due to the presence of alveolar macrophages (AM), 1,25(OH)2D3 has been shown to favor the immune response against pathogens. Here, we explored the ability of aerosolized 1,25(OH)2D3 to locally promote an anti-tumor phenotype in alveolar macrophages (AM) in the treatment of lung metastases.Cytotoxicity assay has been used to assess the capability of AM, in vitro treated of not with 1,25(OH)2D3, to stimulate NK cells. Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay has been used to assess the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on MC-38 and B16 tumor cells in vitro growth. 1,25(OH)2D3 was aerosolized in immunocompetent mouse models to evaluate the effect of local administration of 1,25(OH)2D3 on in vivo growth of MC-38 and B16 tumor cells within lungs and on infiltrating immune cells.In vitro incubation of naïve AM with 1,25(OH)2D3 improved their ability to stimulate NK cell cytotoxicity. In vivo aerosolized 1,25(OH)2D3 significantly reduced the metastatic growth of MC-38 colon carcinoma, a tumor histotype that frequently metastasizes to lung in human. Immune infiltrate obtained from digested lungs of 1,25(OH)2D3-treated mice bearing MC-38 metastases revealed an increased expression of MHCII and CD80 on AM and an up-modulation of CD69 expression on effector cells that paralleled a strong increased ability of these cells to kill MC-38 tumor in vitro.Together, these data show that aerosol delivery can represent a feasible and novel approach to supplement 1,25(OH)2D3 directly to the lungs promoting the activation of local immunity against cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3150103459,"Root growth potential (RGP) is a popular physiological indicator used to evaluate seedling vigor. However, the time scale used in the RGP test is the order of days, which leads to poor performance of the RGP method. We propose an optical interference method, called statistical interferometry, to measure minute root elongation at a sub-nanometer scale, which can decrease the time used in measuring RGP. The time scale of this method is also 10 4 times less than that of the RGP method. Because we can measure the length of root elongation continuously, we can compute the root elongation rate (RER), which is the variety of the length of root elongation per second. Continuous monitoring can help determine the quality of Masson pine seedling as soon as possible. To show the effectiveness of our proposed method, we designed an experiment, in which we applied different water stresses to our collected Masson pine seedlings and acquired two groups of pines, representing two different qualities: one stressed by water and one not. After measuring the RER of the groups in our experiments, we found that RER is interrelated with the quality of seedlings."
https://openalex.org/W3150201483,"Dinoroseobacter shibae living in the photic zone of marine ecosystems is frequently exposed to oxygen that forms highly reactive species. Here, we analysed the adaptation of D. shibae to different kinds of oxidative stress using a GeLC-MS/MS approach. D. shibae was grown in artificial seawater medium in the dark with succinate as sole carbon source and exposed to hydrogen peroxide, paraquat or diamide. We quantified 2580 D. shibae proteins. 75 proteins changed significantly in response to peroxide stress, while 220 and 207 proteins were differently regulated by superoxide stress and thiol stress. As expected, proteins like thioredoxin and peroxiredoxin were among these proteins. In addition, proteins involved in bacteriochlophyll biosynthesis were repressed under disulfide and superoxide stress but not under peroxide stress. In contrast, proteins associated with iron transport accumulated in response to peroxide and superoxide stress. Interestingly, the iron-responsive regulator RirA in D. shibae was downregulated by all stressors. A rirA deletion mutant showed an improved adaptation to peroxide stress suggesting that RirA dependent proteins are associated with oxidative stress resistance. Altogether, 139 proteins were upregulated in the mutant strain. Among them are proteins associated with protection and repair of DNA and proteins (e. g. ClpB, Hsp20, RecA, and a thioredoxin like protein). Strikingly, most of the proteins involved in iron metabolism such as iron binding proteins and transporters were not part of the upregulated proteins. In fact, rirA deficient cells were lacking a peroxide dependent induction of these proteins that may also contribute to a higher cell viability under these conditions."
