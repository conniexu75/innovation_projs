Ding et al. document the timing, tempo, and mode by which the world's most species-rich alpine flora, that of the Tibet-Himalaya-Hengduan region, was assembled. Alpine assemblages in the region are older than previously thought, with lineages tracing their alpine ancestry to the early Oligocene—older than any other modern alpine system. Alpine species diversified faster during periods of orogeny and intensification of the Asian monsoon, and the Hengduan Mountains—the most species-rich area in this region—played a key biogeographic role as the location of the earliest pulse of alpine diversification in the Oligocene.

https://openalex.org/W3046742184,"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 using RT–PCR and other advanced methods can achieve high accuracy. However, their application is limited in countries that lack sufficient resources to handle large-scale testing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we describe a method to detect SARS-CoV-2 in nasal swabs using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and machine learning analysis. This approach uses equipment and expertise commonly found in clinical laboratories in developing countries. We obtained mass spectra from a total of 362 samples (211 SARS-CoV-2-positive and 151 negative by RT–PCR) without prior sample preparation from three different laboratories. We tested two feature selection methods and six machine learning approaches to identify the top performing analysis approaches and determine the accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 detection. The support vector machine model provided the highest accuracy (93.9%), with 7% false positives and 5% false negatives. Our results suggest that MALDI-MS and machine learning analysis can be used to reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 in nasal swab samples. SARS-CoV-2 is reliably detected in nasal swab samples using mass spectrometry and machine learning analysis."

Kusano et al. derived physics-based thresholds for the onset of large solar flares and show how they can be predicted from routine solar observations (see the Perspective by Veronig). They tested their method using observations of the Sun from 2008 to 2019. In most cases, the method correctly identifies which regions will produce large flares within the next 20 hours, although there are some false positives and false negatives. The method also provides the exact location where each flare will begin and limits on how powerful it will be. Accurate predictions of solar flares could improve forecasts of space weather conditions around Earth. Science , this issue p. 587 ; see also p. 504"
https://openalex.org/W3046300502,"Ultra-processed food consumption has been associated with several health outcomes such as obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and cancer. The deleterious nutrient profile of these products, and the presence of food additives, neoformed contaminants and contact materials such as phthalates and bisphenol may be some of the potential pathways through which ultra-processed food influences disease outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine the association between dietary contribution of ultra-processed foods and urinary biomarker concentrations of parent compounds or their metabolites including Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (ΣDEHP), Di-isononyl phthalate (ΣDiNP), Monocarboxynonyl phthalate (mCNP), Mono (3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (mCPP), Monobenzyl phthalate (mBzP), Bisphenol A (BPA), Bisphenol F (BPF) and Bisphenol S (BPS), in the US. Participants from the cross-sectional 2009–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, aged 6+ years, with urinary measures and with one 24-hour dietary recall were included in the study. Ultra-processed foods were identified based on the NOVA classification system, a four-group food classification based on the extent and purpose of industrial food processing. Linear regression was used to compare average urinary creatinine-standardized concentrations across quintiles of energy contribution of ultra-processed foods. Models incorporated survey sample weights and were adjusted for different sociodemographic and life-style variables. Adjusted geometric means of ΣDiNP, mCNP, mCPP, mBzP and BPF increased monotonically from the lowest to the highest quintile of ultra-processed food consumption. As both phthalates/bisphenol and ultra-processed foods have been previously associated with insulin resistance, diabetes, general/abdominal obesity and hypertension, our results suggest the possibility of contact materials in ultra-processed foods as one link between ultra-processed food and these health outcomes. Future studies could confirm findings and further explore these mechanisms of action."
https://openalex.org/W3046323739,"Diffusion magnetic resonance images may suffer from geometric distortions due to susceptibility induced off resonance fields, which cause geometric mismatch with anatomical images and ultimately affect subsequent quantification of microstructural or connectivity indices. State-of-the art diffusion distortion correction methods typically require data acquired with reverse phase encoding directions, resulting in varying magnitudes and orientations of distortion, which allow estimation of an undistorted volume. Alternatively, additional field maps acquisitions can be used along with sequence information to determine warping fields. However, not all imaging protocols include these additional scans and cannot take advantage of state-of-the art distortion correction. To avoid additional acquisitions, structural MRI (undistorted scans) can be used as registration targets for intensity driven correction. In this study, we aim to (1) enable susceptibility distortion correction with historical and/or limited diffusion datasets that do not include specific sequences for distortion correction and (2) avoid the computationally intensive registration procedure typically required for distortion correction using structural scans. To achieve these aims, we use deep learning (3D U-nets) to synthesize an undistorted b0 image that matches geometry of structural T1w images and intensity contrasts from diffusion images. Importantly, the training dataset is heterogenous, consisting of varying acquisitions of both structural and diffusion. We apply our approach to a withheld test set and show that distortions are successfully corrected after processing. We quantitatively evaluate the proposed distortion correction and intensity-based registration against state-of-the-art distortion correction (FSL topup). The results illustrate that the proposed pipeline results in b0 images that are geometrically similar to non-distorted structural images, and more closely match state-of-the-art correction with additional acquisitions. In addition, we show generalizability of the proposed approach to datasets that were not in the original training / validation / testing datasets. These datasets included varying populations, contrasts, resolutions, and magnitudes and orientations of distortion and show efficacious distortion correction. The method is available as a Singularity container, source code, and an executable trained model to facilitate evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W3046253915,"This paper proposes a dynamic model to describe and forecast the dynamics of the coronavirus disease COVID-19 transmission. The model is based on an approach previously used to describe the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic. This methodology is used to describe the COVID-19 dynamics in six countries where the pandemic is widely spread, namely China, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and the USA. For this purpose, data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) are adopted. It is shown how the model can be used to forecast new infection cases and new deceased and how the uncertainties associated to this prediction can be quantified. This approach has the advantage of being relatively simple, grouping in few mathematical parameters the many conditions which affect the spreading of the disease. On the other hand, it requires previous data from the disease transmission in the country, being better suited for regions where the epidemic is not at a very early stage. With the estimated parameters at hand, one can use the model to predict the evolution of the disease, which in turn enables authorities to plan their actions. Moreover, one key advantage is the straightforward interpretation of these parameters and their influence over the evolution of the disease, which enables altering some of them, so that one can evaluate the effect of public policy, such as social distancing. The results presented for the selected countries confirm the accuracy to perform predictions."
https://openalex.org/W3046363785,"The introduction and establishment of nonindigenous species (NIS) through global ship movements poses a significant threat to marine ecosystems and economies. While ballast-vectored invasions have been partly addressed by some national policies and an international agreement regulating the concentrations of organisms in ballast water, biofouling-vectored invasions remain largely unaddressed. Development of additional efficient and cost-effective ship-borne NIS policies requires an accurate estimation of NIS spread risk from both ballast water and biofouling. We demonstrate that the first-order Markovian assumption limits accurate modeling of NIS spread risks through the global shipping network. In contrast, we show that higher-order patterns provide more accurate NIS spread risk estimates by revealing indirect pathways of NIS transfer using Species Flow Higher-Order Networks (SF-HON). Using the largest available datasets of non-indigenous species for Europe and the United States, we then compare SF-HON model predictions against those from networks that consider only first-order connections and those that consider all possible indirect connections without consideration of their significance. We show that not only SF-HONs yield more accurate NIS spread risk predictions, but there are important differences in NIS spread via the ballast and biofouling vectors. Our work provides information that policymakers can use to develop more efficient and targeted prevention strategies for ship-borne NIS spread management, especially as management of biofouling is of increasing concern."
https://openalex.org/W3046555159,"To examine changes in U.S. medical school basic science faculty over the last 20 years (1998-2018), we undertook an observational study utilizing data from the American Association of Medical Colleges Faculty Roster. Rank (Instructor, Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and Professor), sex (Female), and race/ethnicity (Asian, Black or African American, Hispanic, Latino, Spanish Origin, or Multiple Race-Hispanic, and White) were analyzed; this reflected a population of 14,047 (1998) to 18,601 (2018) faculty. Summary percent of faculty in various gender, race/ethnicity origin categories were analyzed across years of the study using regression models. We found that females (24.47% to 35.32%) were underrepresented at all timepoints and a minority of faculty identified as Black or African American (1.57% to 1.99%), Hispanic, Latino, Spanish Origin, or Multiple Race-Hispanic (3.03% to 4.44%), or Asian (10.90% to 20.41%). The largest population at all time points was White Male Professors (30.53% to 20.85%), followed by White Male Associate Professors (15.67% to 9.34%), and White Male Assistant Professors (13.22% to 9.75%). Small statistically significant increases were observed among female faculty and faculty at multiple ranks who identified as Black or African American or Hispanic, Latino, Spanish Origin, or Multiple Race-Hispanic. We then completed secondary analyses looking at the interaction of race/ethnicity and Gender. We found: (1) a significant increase (p<0.0001) in both genders who identify as Asian although males had a higher rate of increase (6 point difference, p<0.0001); (2) a significant increase for Black or African American females (P<0.01) not found among males; (3) significant increases (p<0.0001) among both genders of faculty who identify as Hispanic, Latino, Spanish Origin, or Multiple Race-Hispanic although females had an approximately 1% higher rate of increase; and (4) among faculty who identify as White, males had a significant decrease (p<0.0001) while females demonstrated an increase (p<0.0001)."
https://openalex.org/W3046477501,"Stress-induced exhaustion disorder (SED) is a primary cause for sickness absence among persons with mental health disorders in Sweden. Interventions involving the workplace, and supporting communication between the employee and the supervisor, are proposed to facilitate return to work (RTW). The aim of this study was to explore experiences of persons with SED who participated in a dialogue-based workplace intervention with a convergence dialogue meeting performed by a rehabilitation coordinator.A qualitative design based on group interviews with 15 persons with SED who participated in a 24-week multimodal rehabilitation program was used. The interviews were analyzed with the methodology of grounded theory.The analysis resulted in a theoretical model where the core category, restoring confidence on common ground, represented a health promoting process that included three phases: emotional entrance, supportive guidance, and empowering change. The health promoting process was represented in participant experiences of personal progress and safety in RTW.The intervention built on a health-promoting pedagogy, supported by continuous guidance from a rehabilitation coordinator and structured convergence dialogue meetings that enhanced common communication and collaboration with the supervisor and others involved in the RTW process. The intervention balanced relationships, transferred knowledge, and changed attitudes about SED among supervisors and colleagues in the workplace. The inclusion of a rehabilitation coordinator in the intervention was beneficial by enhancing RTW and bridging the gaps between healthcare, the workplace, and other organizational structures. In addition, the intervention contributed to a positive re-orientation towards successful RTW instead of an endpoint of employment. In a prolonged process, a dialogue-based workplace intervention with convergence dialogue meetings and a rehabilitation coordinator may support sustainable RTW for persons with SED."
https://openalex.org/W3046543061,"The pollution of the natural environment, especially the world’s oceans, with conventional plastic is of major concern. Biodegradable plastics are an emerging market bringing along potential chances and risks. The fate of these materials in the environment and their possible effects on organisms and ecosystems has rarely been studied systematically and is not well understood. For the marine environment, reliable field test methods and standards for assessing and certifying biodegradation to bridge laboratory respirometric data are lacking. In this work we present newly developed field tests to assess the performance of (biodegradable) plastics under natural marine conditions. These methods were successfully applied and validated in three coastal habitats (eulittoral, benthic and pelagic) and two climate zones (Mediterranean Sea and tropical Southeast Asia). Additionally, a stand-alone mesocosm test system which integrated all three habitats in one technical system at 400-L scale independent from running seawater is presented as a methodological bridge. Films of polyhydroxyalkanoate copolymer (PHA) and low density polyethylene (LD-PE) were used to validate the tests. While LD-PE remained intact, PHA disintegrated to a varying degree depending on the habitat and the climate zone. Together with the existing laboratory standard test methods, the field and mesocosm test systems presented in this work provide a 3-tier testing scheme for the reliable assessment of the biodegradation of (biodegradable) plastic in the marine environment. This toolset of tests can be adapted to other aquatic ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W3046245083,"The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) remains the most effective treatment for morbidly obese patients to lower body weight and improve glycemic control. There is recent evidence that the mycobiome (fungal microbiome) can aggravate disease severity in a number of diseases including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and hepatitis; moreover, a dysbiotic fungal microbiota has been reported in the obese. We characterized fungal and bacterial microbial composition in fecal samples of 16 morbidly obese patients before and three months after RYGB surgery and compared with nine healthy controls. We found that RYGB surgery induced a clear alteration in structure and composition of the gut fungal and bacterial microbiota. Beta diversity analysis revealed significant differences in bacterial microbiota between obese patients before surgery and healthy controls (P < 0.005) and a significant, unidirectional shift in RYGB patients after surgery (P < 0.001 vs. before surgery). In contrast, there was no significant difference in fungal microbiota between groups but individually specific changes after RYGB surgery. Interestingly, RYGB surgery induced a significant reduction in fungal alpha diversity namely Chao1, Sobs, and Shannon diversity index (P<0.05, respectively) which contrasts the trend for uniform changes in bacteria towards increased richness and diversity post-surgery. We did not observe any inter-kingdom relations in RYGB patients but in the healthy control cohort and there were several correlations between fungi and bacteria and clinical parameters (P<0.05, respectively) that warrant further research. Our study identifies changes in intestinal fungal communities in RYGB patients that are distinct to changes in the bacterial microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W3046471568,"The diffusion of next-generation sequencing technologies has revolutionized research and diagnosis in the field of rare Mendelian disorders, notably via whole-exome sequencing (WES). However, one of the main issues hampering achievement of a diagnosis via WES analyses is the extended list of variants of unknown significance (VUS), mostly composed of missense variants. Hence, improved solutions are needed to address the challenges of identifying potentially deleterious variants and ranking them in a prioritized short list. We present MISTIC (MISsense deleTeriousness predICtor), a new prediction tool based on an original combination of two complementary machine learning algorithms using a soft voting system that integrates 113 missense features, ranging from multi-ethnic minor allele frequencies and evolutionary conservation, to physiochemical and biochemical properties of amino acids. Our approach also uses training sets with a wide spectrum of variant profiles, including both high-confidence positive (deleterious) and negative (benign) variants. Compared to recent state-of-the-art prediction tools in various benchmark tests and independent evaluation scenarios, MISTIC exhibits the best and most consistent performance, notably with the highest AUC value (> 0.95). Importantly, MISTIC maintains its high performance in the specific case of discriminating deleterious variants from benign variants that are rare or population-specific. In a clinical context, MISTIC drastically reduces the list of VUS (<30%) and significantly improves the ranking of “causative” deleterious variants. Pre-computed MISTIC scores for all possible human missense variants are available at http://lbgi.fr/mistic."
https://openalex.org/W3046238896,"Opioids play a critical role in acute postoperative pain management. Our objective was to develop machine learning models to predict postoperative opioid requirements in patients undergoing ambulatory surgery. To develop the models, we used a perioperative dataset of 13,700 patients (≥ 18 years) undergoing ambulatory surgery between the years 2016–2018. The data, comprising of patient, procedure and provider factors that could influence postoperative pain and opioid requirements, was randomly split into training (80%) and validation (20%) datasets. Machine learning models of different classes were developed to predict categorized levels of postoperative opioid requirements using the training dataset and then evaluated on the validation dataset. Prediction accuracy was used to differentiate model performances. The five types of models that were developed returned the following accuracies at two different stages of surgery: 1) Prior to surgery—Multinomial Logistic Regression: 71%, Naïve Bayes: 67%, Neural Network: 30%, Random Forest: 72%, Extreme Gradient Boost: 71% and 2) End of surgery—Multinomial Logistic Regression: 71%, Naïve Bayes: 63%, Neural Network: 32%, Random Forest: 72%, Extreme Gradient Boost: 70%. Analyzing the sensitivities of the best performing Random Forest model showed that the lower opioid requirements are predicted with better accuracy (89%) as compared with higher opioid requirements (43%). Feature importance (% relative importance) of model predictions showed that the type of procedure (15.4%), medical history (12.9%) and procedure duration (12.0%) were the top three features contributing to model predictions. Overall, the contribution of patient and procedure features towards model predictions were 65% and 35% respectively. Machine learning models could be used to predict postoperative opioid requirements in ambulatory surgery patients and could potentially assist in better management of their postoperative acute pain."
https://openalex.org/W3046626666,"Introduction Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and retention in treatment programs are required for successful virologic suppression and treatment outcomes. As the number of adolescents living with HIV continues to increase globally, more information about adherence and retention patterns during and through transition from child- to adult-centered care is needed to ensure provision of a high level of care and inform development of targeted interventions to improve patient outcomes in this vulnerable population. In this analysis, we sought to describe long-term trends in adherence, retention, and virologic suppression in adolescents receiving ART at a pediatric HIV clinic in Nigeria through transition to the adult clinic. Setting The Jos University Teaching Hospital, United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)-funded HIV clinic in Jos, Plateau State, Nigeria. Methods We conducted a retrospective observational longitudinal evaluation of data that had been collected during the course of care in a large pediatric ART program in Nigeria. We used descriptive statistics to define our patient population and quantify retention from ART initiation through adolescence and transition to adult-centered care. Logistic regression was used to evaluate predictors of loss to follow-up. We used medication possession ratio (MPR) to quantify adherence for each year a patient was on ART. To evaluate adherence and virologic suppression, we measured the proportion of patients with ≥95% MPR and the proportion with virologic suppression (viral load ≤400 copies/mL) within each age cohort, and used bivariate analyses to examine any association between MPR and VL suppression for all person-years observed. Results A total of 476 patients received at least one dose of ART as an adolescent (ages 10–19 years). The proportions of patients lost to follow-up were: 11.9% (71/597) prior to adolescence, 19.1% (31/162) during adolescence, and 13.7% (10/73) during transition to adult-centered care. While over 80% of patients had ≥95% medication adherence in all age groups, their viral load suppression rates through adolescence and post-transition were only 55.6%–64.0%. For patients that successfully transitioned to adult-centered care, we observed 87.7% (50/57) retention at month 12 post-transition, but only 34.6% (9/26) viral load suppression. Conclusions Our evaluation found considerable proportions of adolescents lost to follow-up throughout the ART program cascade. We also found discrepancies between the proportions of patients with ≥95% MPR and the proportions with VL suppression, suggesting that true medication adherence in this population may be poor. Significant attention and targeted interventions to improve retention and adherence focused on adolescents are needed in order for global programs to achieve 90-90-90 goals."
https://openalex.org/W3046272984,"Background Compared with those without dementia, older patients with dementia admitted to acute care settings are at higher risk for triad combination of polypharmacy (PP), potentially inappropriate medication (PIM), and drug-drug interaction (DDI), which may consequently result in detrimental health. The aims of this research were to assess risk factors associated with triad combination of PP, PIM and DDI among hospitalized older patients with dementia, and to assess prevalence and characteristics of PP, PIM and DDI in this population. Methods In this retrospective cross-sectional study, 416 older inpatients diagnosed with dementia and referred for specialist geriatric consultation at a tertiary hospital in Brisbane, Australia during 2006–2016 were enrolled. Patients were categorized into two groups according to their exposure to the combination of PP, PIM and DDI: ‘triad combination’ and ‘non-triad combination’. Data were collected using the interRAI Acute Care (AC) assessment instrument. Independent risk factors of exposure to the triad combination were evaluated using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Results Overall, 181 (43.5%) were classified as triad combination group. The majority of the population took at least 1 PIM (56%) or experienced at least one potential DDI (76%). Over 75% of the participants were exposed to polypharmacy. The most common prescribed PIMs were antipsychotics, followed by benzodiazepines. The independent risk factors of the triad combination were the presence of atrial fibrillation diagnosis and higher medications use in cardiac therapy, psycholeptics and psychoanaleptics. Conclusions The exposure to triad combination of PP, PIM and DDI are common among people with dementia as a result of their vulnerable conditions and the greater risks of adverse events from medications use. This study identified the use of cardiac therapy, psycholeptics and psychoanaleptics as predictors of exposure to PP, PIM and DDI. Therefore, use of these medications should be carefully considered and closely monitored. Furthermore, comprehensive medication reviews to optimize medication prescribing should be initiated and continually implemented for this vulnerable population."
https://openalex.org/W3046693562,"Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) mostly affects obese women in childbearing age, leading to frustrating headache and permanent visual impairment. The exact etiology of this condition is poorly understood, and the population at risk and clinical presentation seems to be homogeneous. However, little attention has been paid to the clinical features of IIH patients with anemia. We herein performed a retrospective observational study by using the data of patients with presumed IIH who were referred to the neurology department of Beijing Tongren Hospital from January 2014 to August 2019 to describe the clinical features and radiological findings in patients with IIH and anemia, and compared these with those without anemia. The patients were divided into two groups based on the presence of anemic diseases. Clinical data including demographic characteristics, clinical features, past medical history, laboratory and neuroradiological findings, diagnoses, treatments and prognosis of these patients were reviewed and compared in both the groups. A total of 153 patients with IIH were enrolled, which included 22 cases with anemia (mean age, 33.23±9.68 years; 19 [86.36%] female) and 131 cases without anemia (mean age 37.11±11.56 years; 97 [74.05%] female). In the anemia group, 19/22 cases had iron deficiency anemia and 3/22 had renal anemia. Compared with patients in the non-anemia group, IIH patients with anemia had a shorter disease course, and tended to present pulsatile tinnitus and transverse sinus stenosis (TSS), faster and better prognosis after treatments for correcting anemia and reducing intracranial pressure. Our findings highlighted the importance of obtaining full blood counts in IIH patients with subacute onset, and provided appropriate and prompt treatments if proven anemic in order to bring better outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3046445095,"Many studies on the coexistence of wildlife with livestock have focused primarily on similar-sized species. Furthermore, many of these studies have used dietary overlap as a measure of potential competition between interacting species and thus lack the important link between dietary overlap and any negative effects on a particular species–a prerequisite for competition. Consequently, the mechanisms that drive interspecific interactions between wildlife and cattle are frequently overlooked. To address this, we used an experimental setup where we leveraged different cattle stocking rates across two seasons to identify the drivers of interspecific interactions (i.e. competition and facilitation) between smaller-bodied oribi antelope and cattle. Using direct foraging observations, we assessed dietary overlap and grass regrowth, and also calculated oribi nutritional intake rates. Ultimately, we found that cattle compete with, and facilitate, smaller-bodied oribi antelope through bottom-up control. Specifically, cattle facilitated oribi during the wet season, irrespective of cattle stocking density, because cattle foraging produced high-quality grass regrowth. In contrast, during the dry season, cattle and oribi did not co-exist in the same areas (i.e. no direct dietary overlap). Despite this, we found that cattle foraging at high densities during the previous wet season reduced the dry season availability of oribi’s preferred grass species. To compensate, oribi expanded their dry season diet breadth and included less palatable grass species, ultimately reducing their nutritional intake rates. Thus, cattle competed with oribi through a delayed, across-season habitat modification. We show that differences in body size alone may not be able to offset competitive interactions between cattle and wildlife. Finally, understanding the mechanisms that drive facilitation and competition are key to promoting co-existence between cattle and wildlife."
https://openalex.org/W3046855321,"There has been rapidly accelerating interest in the utilization of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as non-invasive methods for rapid point-of-care medical diagnostics. There is widespread variation in analytical methods and protocols, with little understanding of the effects of sample storage on VOC profiles. This study aimed to determine the effects on VOC profiles of different storage times, at room temperature, prior to freezing, of sealed urine samples from healthy individuals. Analysis using Field Asymmetric Ion Motility Spectrometry (FAIMS) determined the alterations in VOC and total ion count profiles as a result of increasing room temperature storage times. Results indicated that increasing exposure time to room temperature prior to freezing had a threefold effect. Firstly, increased urinary VOC profile variability, with a plateau phase between 12 and 48 hours, before further degradation. Secondly, an increase in total ion count with time exposed to room temperature. Finally, a deterioration in VOCs with each sample run during the analysis process. This provides new insight into the effect of storage of urine samples for VOC analysis using FAIMS technology. Results of this study provide a recommendation for a 12-hour maximum duration at room temperature prior to storage."

We studied the effect of maternal environment (salt and salt+heat) on progeny DU (dry indehiscent fruit) focusing on pericarp properties of Anastatica hierochuntica. Stressed plants displayed increased seed abortion and low level and rate of germination. Hydrated pericarps released antimicrobial factors and allelopathic substances that inhibit germination of heterologous species. Proteome analysis of dead pericarps revealed hundreds of proteins, among them nucleases, chitinases and proteins involved in reactive oxygen species detoxification and cell wall modification. Salt treatment altered the composition and level of proteins stored in the pericarp. We observed changes in protein profile released from seeds of salt-treated plants with a notable increase in a small anti-fungal protein, defensin. The levels of phytohormones including IAA, ABA and salicylic acid were reduced in dead pericarps of stressed plants. The data presented here highlighted the predominant effects of maternal environment on progeny DUs of the desert plant A. hierochuntica, particularly on pericarp properties, which in turn might affect seed performance and fate, soil fertility and consequently plant biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W3046454063,"Self-harm and mental health are inter-related issues that substantially contribute to the global burden of disease. However, measurement of these issues at the population level is problematic. Statistics on suicide can be captured in national cause of death data collected as part of the coroner’s review process, however, there is a significant time-lag in the availability of such data, and by definition, these sources do not include non-fatal incidents. Although survey, emergency department, and hospitalisation data present alternative information sources to measure self-harm, such data do not include the richness of information available at the point of incident. This paper describes the mental health and self-harm modules within the National Ambulance Surveillance System (NASS), a unique Australian system for monitoring and mapping mental health and self-harm. Data are sourced from paramedic electronic patient care records provided by Australian state and territory-based ambulance services. A team of specialised research assistants use a purpose-built system to manually scrutinise and code these records. Specific details of each incident are coded, including mental health symptoms and relevant risk indicators, as well as the type, intent, and method of self-harm. NASS provides almost 90 output variables related to self-harm (i.e., type of behaviour, self-injurious intent, and method) and mental health (e.g., mental health symptoms) in the 24 hours preceding each attendance, as well as demographics, temporal and geospatial characteristics, clinical outcomes, co-occurring substance use, and self-reported medical and psychiatric history. NASS provides internationally unique data on self-harm and mental health, with direct implications for translational research, public policy, and clinical practice. This methodology could be replicated in other countries with universal ambulance service provision to inform health policy and service planning."
https://openalex.org/W3046663442,"Although a number of modifiable and non-modifiable causes were implicated in arterial stiffness, its pathogenesis remains elusive, and very little is known about aortic elasticity in supraventricular arrhythmias. The potential role of disturbed kynurenine metabolism in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease has been recently suggested. Thus, we studied the correlations of aortic stiffness and echocardiographic parameters with biochemical markers and serum level of kynurenic acid (KYNA), an endothelial derivative of tryptophan, formed along the kynurenine pathway, among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).Study cohort comprised 100 patients with persistent AF (43 females/57 males). Arterial stiffness index (ASI), structural and functional indices of left atrium (LA) and left ventricle (LV) were evaluated electrocardiographically. Biochemical analyses included the measurements of serum KYNA (HPLC) and of the selected markers of lipids and glucose metabolism, thyroid status, kidney function, inflammation and coagulation.KYNA (β = 0.389, P = 0.029), homocysteine (β = 0.256, P = 0.40), total cholesterol (β = 0.814; P = 0.044), LDL (β = 0.663; P = 0.44), TSH (β = 0.262, P = 0.02), fT3 (β = -0.333, P = 0.009), fT4 (β = -0.275, P = 0.043) and creatinine (β = 0.374, P = 0.043) were independently correlated with ASI. ASI was also independently associated with LV end-systolic diameter (LVEDd; β = 1.751, P = 0.045), midwall fractional shortening (mFS; β = -1.266, P = 0.007), ratio mFS/end-systolic stress (mFS/ESS; β = -0.235, P = 0.026), LV shortening fraction (FS; β = -0.254, P = 0.017), and LA volume index (LAVI; β = 0.944, P = 0.022).In patients with AF, aortic stiffness correlated positively with KYNA, biochemical risk factors of atherosclerosis and with the indices of diastolic dysfunction of LV and LA. Revealed relationship between ASI and KYNA is an original observation, suggesting a potential role of disturbed kynurenine metabolism in the pathogenesis of arterial stiffening. KYNA, synthesis of which is influenced by homocysteine, emerges as a novel, non-classical factor associated with ASI in patients with AF."
https://openalex.org/W3046779953,"Background Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections have many negative health outcomes (e.g., diarrhea, nutritional deficiencies) that can also exacerbate poverty. These infections are generally highest among low-income populations, many of which are also undergoing market integration (MI; increased participation in a market-based economy). Yet the direct impact of MI-related social and environmental changes on STH infection patterns is poorly understood, making it unclear which lifestyle factors should be targeted to better control disease spread. This cross-sectional study examines if household infrastructure associated with greater MI is associated with lower STH burdens among Indigenous Ecuadorian Shuar. Methods Kato-Katz fecal smears were used to determine STH infection status and intensity (n = 620 participants; 308 females, 312 males, aged 6 months—86 years); Ascaris lumbricoides (ascarid) and Trichuris trichiura (whipworm) were the primary infection types detected. Structured interviews assessing lifestyle patterns (e.g., measures of household infrastructure) measured participant MI. Multilevel regression analyses and zero-inflated negative binomial regression models tested associations between MI measures and STH infection status or intensity, controlling for individual and community characteristics. Results Participants residing in more market-integrated households exhibited lower infection rates and intensities than those in less market integrated households. Parasite infection status and T. trichiura infection intensity were lower among participants living in houses with wood floors than those with dirt floors, while individuals using well or piped water from a spring exhibited lower A. lumbricoides infection intensities compared to those using river or stream water. Unexpectedly, latrine type was not significantly related to STH infection status or intensity. These results suggest that sources of exposure differ between the two helminth species. Conclusions This study documents associations between household measures and STH infection among an Indigenous population undergoing rapid MI. These findings can help healthcare programs better target interventions and reduce STH exposure among at-risk populations."

Methods We retrospectively reviewed 40 eyes with DME and massive hard exudates treated with either PPV with ILM peeling (vitrectomy group, 21 eyes) or nonsurgical treatment with anti-vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF) and/or steroids (nonsurgical group, 19 eyes). Changes in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT) and resolution of macular hard exudates were compared between the two groups. Results After treatment, CRT decreased steadily in the vitrectomy group but fluctuated in the nonsurgical group. Compared with eyes in the nonsurgical group, eyes in the vitrectomy group had better visual improvement (P < 0.05 at 6 and 12 months and the final visit) and greater decrease in CRT (P < 0.05 at 3 and 6 months and the final visit) after adjustment for baseline BCVA. Hard exudates resolved more rapidly in the vitrectomy group than in the nonsurgical group, with 94.1% versus 47.4% eyes showing significant absorption after 6 months of the treatment (P = 0.003). In the vitrectomy group, 62% eyes did not require any further injections for treating DME after the operation. Conclusions PPV with ILM peeling resulted in rapid resolution of hard exudates with significant anatomical and functional improvement in DME with massive hard exudates."
https://openalex.org/W3046269893,"Animal models are vital to the study of transfusion and development of new blood products. Post-transfusion recovery of human blood components can be studied in mice, however, there is a need to identify strains that can best tolerate xenogeneic transfusions, as well as to optimize such protocols. Specifically, the importance of using immunodeficient mice, such as NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice, to study human transfusion has been questioned. In this study, strains of wild-type and NSG mice were compared as hosts for human transfusions with outcomes quantified by flow cytometric analyses of CD235a+ erythrocytes, CD45+ leukocytes, and CD41+CD42b+ platelets. Complete blood counts were evaluated as well as serum cytokines by multiplexing methods. Circulating human blood cells were maintained better in NSG than in wild-type mice. Lethargy and hemoglobinuria were observed in the first hours in wild-type mice along with increased pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, tumor necrosis factor α, keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC or CXCL1), and interleukin-6, whereas NSG mice were less severely affected. Whole blood transfusion resulted in rapid sequestration and then release of human cells back into the circulation within several hours. This rebound effect diminished when only erythrocytes were transfused. Nonetheless, human erythrocytes were found in excess of mouse erythrocytes in the liver and lungs and had a shorter half-life in circulation. Variables affecting the outcomes of transfused erythrocytes were cell dose and mouse weight; recipient sex did not affect outcomes. The sensitivity and utility of this xenogeneic model were shown by measuring the effects of erythrocyte damage due to exposure to the oxidizer diamide on post-transfusion recovery. Overall, immunodeficient mice are superior models for xenotransfusion as they maintain improved post-transfusion recovery with negligible immune-associated side effects."
https://openalex.org/W3046296151,"Vocal folds are a viscoelastic multilayered structure responsible for voice production. Vocal fold epithelial damage may weaken the protection of deeper layers of lamina propria and thyroarytenoid muscle and impair voice production. Systemic dehydration can adversely affect vocal function by creating suboptimal biomechanical conditions for vocal fold vibration. However, the molecular pathobiology of systemically dehydrated vocal folds is poorly understood. We used an in vivo rabbit model to investigate the complete gene expression profile of systemically dehydrated vocal folds. The RNA-Seq based transcriptome revealed 203 differentially expressed (DE) vocal fold genes due to systemic dehydration. Interestingly, function enrichment analysis showed downregulation of genes involved in cell adhesion, cell junction, inflammation, and upregulation of genes involved in cell proliferation. RT-qPCR validation was performed for a subset of DE genes and confirmed the downregulation of DSG1, CDH3, NECTIN1, SDC1, S100A9, SPINK5, ECM1, IL1A, and IL36A genes. In addition, the upregulation of the transcription factor NR4A3 gene involved in epithelial cell proliferation was validated. Taken together, these results suggest an alteration of the vocal fold epithelial barrier independent of inflammation, which could indicate a disruption and remodeling of the epithelial barrier integrity. This transcriptome provides a first global picture of the molecular changes in vocal fold tissue in response to systemic dehydration. The alterations observed at the transcriptional level help to understand the pathobiology of dehydration in voice function and highlight the benefits of hydration in voice therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3046444979,"In this preregistered study, we investigated whether the statistical power of a study is higher when researchers are asked to make a formal power analysis before collecting data. We compared the sample size descriptions from two sources: (i) a sample of pre-registrations created according to the guidelines for the Center for Open Science Preregistration Challenge (PCRs) and a sample of institutional review board (IRB) proposals from Tilburg School of Behavior and Social Sciences, which both include a recommendation to do a formal power analysis, and (ii) a sample of pre-registrations created according to the guidelines for Open Science Framework Standard Pre-Data Collection Registrations (SPRs) in which no guidance on sample size planning is given. We found that PCRs and IRBs (72%) more often included sample size decisions based on power analyses than the SPRs (45%). However, this did not result in larger planned sample sizes. The determined sample size of the PCRs and IRB proposals (Md = 90.50) was not higher than the determined sample size of the SPRs (Md = 126.00; W = 3389.5, p = 0.936). Typically, power analyses in the registrations were conducted with G*power, assuming a medium effect size, α = .05 and a power of .80. Only 20% of the power analyses contained enough information to fully reproduce the results and only 62% of these power analyses pertained to the main hypothesis test in the pre-registration. Therefore, we see ample room for improvements in the quality of the registrations and we offer several recommendations to do so."
https://openalex.org/W3046558624,"Western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is a major pest of corn in the United States. Transgenic corn expressing insecticidal proteins derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is an important tool used to manage rootworm populations. However, field-evolved resistance to Bt threatens this technology. In areas where resistance is present, resistant individuals may travel from one field to a neighboring field, spreading resistance alleles. An important question that remains to be answered is the extent to which greater-than-expected root injury (i.e., >1 node of injury) to Cry3Bb1 corn from western corn rootworm is associated with rootworm abundance, root injury, and levels of resistance in neighboring fields. To address this question, fields with a history of greater-than-expected injury to Cry3Bb1 corn (focal fields) and surrounding fields (< 2.2 km from focal fields) were examined to quantify rootworm abundance, root injury, and resistance to Cry3Bb1 corn. Additionally, use of Bt corn and soil insecticide use for the previous six years were quantified for each field. Resistance to Cry3Bb1 was present in all fields assayed, even though focal fields had grown more Cry3 corn and less non-Bt corn than surrounding fields. This finding implies that some movement of resistance alleles had occurred between focal fields and surrounding fields. Overall, our data suggest that resistance to Cry3Bb1 in the landscape has been influenced by both local rootworm movement and field-level management tactics."
https://openalex.org/W3046690307,"When humans are administered continuous and predictable perturbations of stance, an adaptation period precedes the steady state of balancing behaviour. Little information is available on the modulation of adaptation by vision and perturbation frequency. Moreover, performance of supra-postural tasks may modulate adaptation in as yet unidentified ways. Our purpose was to identify differences in adaptation associated to distinct visual tasks and perturbation frequencies. Twenty non-disabled adult volunteers stood on a platform translating 10 cm in antero-posterior (AP) direction at low (LF, 0.18 Hz) and high frequency (HF, 0.56 Hz) with eyes open (EO) and closed (EC). Additional conditions were reading a text fixed to platform (EO-TP) and reading a text stationary on ground (EO-TG). Peak-to-peak (PP) displacement amplitude and AP position of head and pelvis markers were computed for each of 27 continuous perturbation cycles. The time constant and extent of head and pelvis adaptation and the cross-correlation coefficients between head and pelvis were compared across visual conditions and frequencies. Head and pelvis mean positions in space varied little across conditions and perturbation cycles but the mean head PP displacements changed over time. On average, at LF, the PP displacement of the head and pelvis increased progressively. Adaptation was rapid or ineffective with EO, but slower with EO-TG, EO-TP, EC. At HF, the head PP displacement amplitude decreased progressively with fast adaptation rates, while the pelvis adaptation was not apparent. The results show that visual tasks can modulate the adaptation rate, highlight the effect of the perturbation frequency on adaptation and provide evidence of priority assigned to pelvis stabilization over visual tasks at HF. The effects of perturbation frequency and optic flow and their interaction with other sensory inputs and cognitive tasks on the adaptation strategies should be investigated in impaired individuals and considered in the design of rehabilitation protocols."

https://openalex.org/W3046231585,"The palm family (Arecaceae) is of high ecological and economic value, yet identification in the family remains a challenge for both taxonomists and horticulturalists. The family consists of approximately 2600 species across 181 genera and DNA barcoding may be a useful tool for species identification within the group. However, there have been few systematic evaluations of DNA barcodes for the palm family. In the present study, five DNA barcodes (rbcL, matK, trnH-psbA, ITS, ITS2) were evaluated for species identification ability across 669 samples representing 314 species and 100 genera in the Arecaceae, employing four analytical methods. The ITS gene region was found to not be a suitable barcode for the palm family, due in part, to low recovery rates and paralogous gene copies. Among the four analyses used, species resolution for ITS2 was much higher than that achieved with the plastid barcodes alone (rbcL, matK, trnH-psbA), and the barcode combination ITS2 + matK + rbcL gave the highest resolution among all single barcodes and their combinations, followed by ITS2 + matK. Among 669 palm samples analyzed, 110 samples (16.3%) were found to be misidentified. The 2992 DNA barcode sequences generated in this study greatly enriches the existing identification toolbox available to plant taxonomists that are interested in researching genetic relationships among palm taxa as well as for horticulturalists that need to confirm palm collections for botanical garden curation and horticultural applications. Our results indicate that the use of the ITS2 DNA barcode gene region provides a useful and cost-effective tool to confirm the identity of taxa in the Palm family."
https://openalex.org/W3046075803,"Abstract MLL undergoes multiple distinct chromosomal translocations to yield aggressive leukemia with dismal outcomes. Besides their well-established role in leukemogenesis, MLL fusions also possess latent tumor-suppressive activity, which can be exploited as effective cancer treatment strategies using pharmacological means such as proteasome inhibitors (PIs). Here, using MLL-rearranged xenografts and MLL leukemic cells as models, we show that wild-type MLL is indispensable for the latent tumor-suppressive activity of MLL fusions. MLL dysfunction, shown as loss of the chromatin accumulation and subsequent degradation of MLL, compromises the latent tumor suppression of MLL-AF4 and is instrumental for the acquired PI resistance. Mechanistically, MLL dysfunction is caused by chronic PI treatment-induced epigenetic reprogramming through the H2Bub-ASH2L-MLL axis and can be specifically restored by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, which induce histone acetylation and recruits MLL on chromatin to promote cell cycle gene expression. Our findings not only demonstrate the mechanism underlying the inevitable acquisition of PI resistance in MLL leukemic cells, but also illustrate that preventing the emergence of PI-resistant cells constitutes a novel rationale for combination therapy with PIs and HDAC inhibitors in MLL leukemias."
https://openalex.org/W3046670700,"Different consumer groups accept new energy vehicles sequentially from the perspective of innovation diffusion theory, and the early adopter group has recently been identified. By assuming that the density of early adopters is increasing at minimum acceptable quality thresholds, this paper proposes a vertical quality differentiation model of product R&D with product subsidies. The impact of product subsidies on the R&D investment of new energy vehicle firms is discussed. We show that the early adopters' characteristics may affect the stagnant marginal R&D investment of new energy vehicle firms by increasing sales, which determines the impact mechanism of product subsidies. For firms with decreasing marginal R&D investments, insufficient R&D investments result from financial constraints. If insufficient R&D resources deter firms from conducting R&D, substantial unit subsidies invariably incentivize firms to spend their entire R&D budget. Firms with increasing marginal R&D investments, insufficient R&D profits, or financial constraints are prevented from increasing R&D investment. Product subsidies generally have a crowding-in effect on firms not subject to financial constraints, and this effect increases with the unit subsidy. However, the existence of a crowding-in effect may require sufficiently large unit subsidies. In both situations, product subsidies cannot modulate financial constraints if the firm has spent its entire R&D budget. In the first situation, we also show that product subsidies should be replaced by a funding support policy. In contrast, the second situation shows that a funding support policy should be coordinated with product subsidies."
https://openalex.org/W3046897834,"According to Silvan Tomkins’ polarity theory, ideological thought is universally structured by a clash between two opposing worldviews. On the left, a humanistic worldview seeks to uphold the intrinsic value of the person; on the right, a normative worldview holds that human worth is contingent upon conformity to rules. In this article, we situate humanism and normativism within the context of contemporary models of political ideology as a function of motivated social cognition, beliefs about the social world, and personality traits. In four studies conducted in the U.S. and Sweden, normativism was robustly associated with rightist (or conservative) self-placement; conservative issue preferences; resistance to change and acceptance of inequality; right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation; system justification and its underlying epistemic and existential motives to reduce uncertainty and threat; and a lack of openness, emotionality, and honesty-humility. Humanism exhibited the opposite relations to most of these constructs, but it was largely unrelated to epistemic and existential needs. Humanism was strongly associated with preferences for equality, openness to change, and low levels of authoritarianism, social dominance, and general and economic system justification. We conclude that polarity theory possesses considerable potential to explain how conflicts between worldviews shape contemporary politics."
https://openalex.org/W3046412466,"Patient-reported experience measures (PREMs) are central to inform on the responsiveness of health systems to citizens' health care needs and expectations. At their current form, PREMs do not reflect the weights that patients assign to varying aspects of the care experience. We aimed to investigate patients' preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for attributes of the care experience in outpatient settings.A discrete choice experiment was conducted among a representative sample of the general adult population of Hungary (n = 1000). Choice set attributes and levels were defined based on OECD's standardized PREMs (e.g. a doctor spending enough time in consultation, providing easy to understand explanations, giving opportunity to ask questions, and involving in decision making) and a price attribute. Conditional and mixed logit analyses were conducted. WTP estimates were computed in preference and WTP space.The respondents most preferred attribute was that of a doctor spending enough time in consultation, followed by involvement in decision making. Moreover, waiting times had a less important effect on respondents' choice preference compared with aspects of the doctor-patient relationship. Estimates in the WTP space varied from €4.38 (2.85-5.90) for waiting an hour less at a doctor's office to €36.13 (32.07-40.18) for a consultation where a doctor spends enough time with a patient relative to a consultation where a doctor does not.A preference-based PREMs approach provide insight on the value patients assign to different aspects of their care experience. This can inform the decisions of policy-makers and other stakeholders to coordinate efforts and resource allocation in a more targeted manner, by acting on attributes of the care experience that have a greater impact on the implementation of patient-centered care."
https://openalex.org/W3046915050,"Proprioception acquires a crucial role in estimating the configuration of our body segments in space when visual information is not available. Proprioceptive accuracy is assessed by asking participants to match the perceived position of an unseen body landmark through reaching movements. This task was also adopted to study the perceived hand structure by computing the relative distances between averaged proprioceptive judgments (hand Localization Task). However, the pattern of proprioceptive errors leading to the misperceived hand structure is unexplored. Here, we aimed to characterize this pattern across different hand landmarks, having different anatomo-physiological properties and cortical representations. Furthermore, we sought to describe the error consistency and its stability over time. To this purpose, we analyzed the proprioceptive errors of 43 healthy participants during the hand Localization Task. We found larger but more consistent errors for the fingertips compared to the knuckles, possibly due to poorer proprioceptive signal, compensated by other sources of spatial information. Furthermore, we found a shift (overlap effect) and a temporal drift of the hand perceived position towards the shoulder of origin, which was consistent within and between subjects. The overlap effect had a greater influence on lateral compared to medial landmarks, leading to the hand width overestimation. Our results are compatible with domain-general and body-specific spatial biases affecting the proprioceptive localization of the hand landmarks, thus the apparent hand structure misperception."
https://openalex.org/W3046921363,"We recently reported the development of a fully-human, CD3-binding bispecific antibody for immunotherapy of malignant glioma. To translate this therapeutic (hEGFRvIII-CD3- bi-scFv) to clinical trials and to help further the translation of other similar CD3-binding therapeutics, some of which are associated with neurologic toxicities, we performed a good laboratory practice (GLP) toxicity study to assess for potential behavioral, chemical, hematologic, and pathologic toxicities including evaluation for experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). To perform this study, male and female C57/BL6 mice heterozygous for the human CD3 transgene (20/sex) were allocated to one of four designated groups. All animals were administered one dose level of hEGFRvIII-CD3 bi-scFv or vehicle control. Test groups were monitored for feed consumption, changes in body weight, and behavioral disturbances including signs of EAE. Urinalysis, hematologic, and clinical chemistry analysis were also performed. Vehicle and test chemical-treated groups were humanely euthanized 48 hours or 14 days following dose administration. Complete gross necropsy of all tissues was performed, and selected tissues plus all observed gross lesions were collected and evaluated for microscopic changes. This included hematoxylin-eosin histopathological evaluation and Fe-ECR staining for myelin sheath enumeration. There were no abnormal clinical observations or signs of EAE noted during the study. There were no statistical changes in food consumption, body weight gain, or final body weight among groups exposed to hEGFRvIII-CD3 bi-scFv compared to the control groups for the 2- and 14-day timepoints. There were statistical differences in some clinical chemistry, hematologic and urinalysis endpoints, primarily in the females at the 14-day timepoint (hematocrit, calcium, phosphorous, and total protein). No pathological findings related to hEGFRvIII-CD3 bi-scFv administration were observed. A number of gross and microscopic observations were noted but all were considered to be incidental background findings. The results of this study allow for further translation of this and other important CD3 modulating bispecific antibodies."

This study examines how supervisory bodies dealing with ongoing trials respond to external challenges of the past two decades and engage in institutional work to maintain, repair, or improve the Dutch regulatory regime.International and national regulatory documents were analyzed and interviews (n = 27) were conducted with various actors, including public supervisory bodies, hospital staff, and boards of directors.In the Netherlands, EU harmonization directed at centralizing and coordinating the regulatory regime for good clinical trial practice in Member States has paradoxically led to further fragmentation. The resulting ambiguity and inefficiency remained largely unresolved until a serious incident in a university hospital became a catalyst to clarify both the interconnected responsibilities and working relationships of various supervisory bodies. New legislation and regulatory methods were implemented, and actors outside the legislative framework became active in the field in order to strengthen supervision of ongoing trials, further multiplying yet also aligning with existing regulatory regimes.Public supervision of ongoing trials is fragmented in the Netherlands because the responsibilities and resources are unevenly distributed. In countries like the Netherlands, public supervisory bodies must do a great deal of institutional work to align with new EU regulations and still safeguard their traditional regulatory mechanisms that protect human safety. However, national regulatory traditions also offer new opportunities to strengthen the quality assurance of clinical trials."

Data were collected through a self-questionnaire or extracted from medical records. Determinants of highest knowledge were identified using logistic regression.Of the 2069 women included in the study, 827 (40%) did not know that influenza can lead to severe adverse outcomes for the mother, and 960 (46%) did not know about possible severe adverse outcomes for the baby. Two hundred and one women (9.8%) stated that the vaccine was ""contraindicated"" or ""unnecessary"" during pregnancy. Only 205 women (17%) had been vaccinated during a previous pregnancy. Determinants of the highest level of knowledge were age over 24, a high educational level, previous influenza vaccination, nulliparity, and the recommendation of vaccination by a healthcare professional.Recommending vaccination during pregnancy appears to increase knowledge about influenza and its vaccine among pregnant women."

https://openalex.org/W3046326298,"Endothelial cilia are found in a variety of tissues including the cranial vasculature of zebrafish embryos. Recently, endothelial cells in the developing mouse retina were reported to also possess primary cilia that are potentially involved in vascular remodeling. Fish carrying mutations in intraflagellar transport (ift) genes have disrupted cilia and have been reported to have an increased rate of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), potentially due to disruption of the sonic hedgehog (shh) signaling pathway. However, it remains unknown whether the endothelial cells forming the retinal microvasculature in zebrafish also possess cilia, and whether endothelial cilia are necessary for development and maintenance of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB). In the present study, we found that the endothelial cells lining the zebrafish hyaloid vasculature possess primary cilia during development. To determine whether endothelial cilia are necessary for BRB integrity, ift57, ift88, and ift172 mutants, which lack cilia, were crossed with the double-transgenic zebrafish strain Tg(l-fabp:DBP-EGFP;flk1:mCherry). This strain expresses a vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as a tracer in the blood plasma, while the endothelial cells forming the vasculature are tagged by mCherry. The Ift mutant fish develop a functional BRB, indicating that endothelial cilia are not necessary for early BRB integrity. Additionally, although treatment of zebrafish larvae with Shh inhibitor cyclopamine results in BRB breakdown, the Ift mutant fish were not sensitized to cyclopamine-induced BRB breakdown."

Treatment of human hepatic stellate cell line LX2 with or without 5μM INH for 24 to 72 hours was performed to look into content of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), activity of NADPH oxidase (NOX) and intracellular oxidative stress. Protein level as well as mRNA expression of alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and collagen1A1 (COL1A1) were assessed by western blot and real time PCR. In some experiments pyrazole (PY) was pre-treated to LX2 cells to induce CYP2E1 prior to INH treatment. CYP2E1 level as well as NOX activity was gradually increased with INH treatment in LX2 cells till 72 hours. Following 72 hours of INH exposure, intracellular glutathione (GSH) level was found to be reduced compared to control (p<0.01) and showed expression of α-SMA, indicating activation of HSC. We could not found any change in collagen expression in this experimental study. Pyrazole (PY) pre-treatment to LX2 cells caused significant increase in cellular CYP2E1 content associated with increase of NOX, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and expression of α-SMA and collagen1 after INH exposure. CYP2E1 is present in insignificant amount in HSCs and INH treatment could not induce collagen expression, although altered cellular oxidant levels was observed. But in LX2 cells when CYP2E1 was over-expressed by PY, INH administration provokes oxidative stress mediated stellate cells activation along with collagen type I expression."

By combining the chromosome conformation capture (3C) and biotinylated dCas9 system, we previously established a method CAPTURE-3C-seq to unbiasedly identify high-resolution and locus-specific long-range DNA interactions. Here we present the statistical model and a flexible pipeline, C3S, for analysing CAPTURE-3C-seq or similar experimental data from raw sequencing reads to significantly interacting chromatin loci. C3S provides all steps for data processing, quality control and result illustration. It can automatically define the bin size based on the binding peak of the dCas9-targeted regions. Furthermore, it supports the analysis of intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions for different mammalian cell types. We successfully applied C3S across multiple datasets in human K562 cells and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) for detecting known and new chromatin interactions at multiple scales. Integrative and topological analysis of the interacted loci at the human β-globin gene cluster provides new insights into mechanisms in developmental gene regulation and network structure in local chromosomal architecture.

In addition, the biogenesis of miRNA is a multistep process involving various proteins, although the complete pathway remains to be elucidated. Therefore, identification of molecules that can specifically modulate each step will help understand the mechanism of gene suppression. To date, several AGO2 inhibitors have been identified. However, these molecules were identified through a single screening method, and no studies have specifically evaluated a combinatorial strategy. Here, we demonstrated a combinatorial screening (SCR) approach comprising an in silico molecular docking study, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis, focusing on the strong binding between the 5'-terminal phosphate of RNA and the AGO2 middle (MID) domain. By combining SPR and NMR, we identified binding modes of amino acid residues binding to AGO2. First, using a large chemical library (over 6,000,000 compounds), 171 compounds with acidic functional groups were screened using in silico SCR. Next, we constructed an SPR inhibition system that could analyze only the 5'-terminal binding site of RNA, and nine molecules that strongly bound to the AGO2 MID domain were selected. Finally, using NMR, three molecules that bound to the desired site were identified. The RISC inhibitory ability of the ""hit"" compounds was analyzed in human cell lysate, and all three hit compounds strongly inhibited the binding between double-stranded RNA and AGO2."

I was sitting in a professor's office, interviewing for a postdoc position, when the topic suddenly shifted from my science to my womb. I paused, unsure how to respond. I didn't feel my personal life was any of the professor's business. But I was interested in the position, and I worried that I might not get it if I refused to answer. So I told him details about my personal life that I never imagined sharing with a stranger.



> “The entire ordeal has left me feeling helpless.” 

That interview was in Japan, where his question—I've since learned—isn't unusual. But I'm not from Japan. I grew up in Taiwan, and it was unusual for me.

I wished I told him I thought his line of questioning was inappropriate. I worried he'd ask the same question to other interviewees in the future and make them feel just as uncomfortable. It was also demoralizing to be judged based on the odds that I would have children. “Shouldn't my academic accomplishments be the only thing that matters?” I fumed.

At first, I told myself it was a one-off incident, an unlucky break with that particular professor. Then I got called to interview for a postdoc position at another institution in Japan. I was excited because it was at a top university and I thought it would be good for my career. But midway through the interview, a warning bell started to ring in my mind when the faculty member asked, “Do you live with your family?” Flustered, I responded, “Yes, I live with my family.” He pressed further: “Do you have kids?” Once again, I didn't dare refuse to answer, so I found myself opening up about my personal life.

I received an offer for one of those positions, but I turned it down because I didn't want to work in an environment where I risked being judged differently for my parental status or for being a woman. I am still trying to secure a second postdoc, and I fear I will face the same question again.

At the time of those incidents, I didn't feel I could do anything about them, beyond complaining to friends and colleagues. But when I told my current postdoc adviser about my second interview, she was furious. She told me I could seek help from the university's harassment counselor and report the case.

With the help of the counselor, I sent a letter to the dean and department chair who oversee the second faculty member, describing what happened. I told them that I wanted all the employees in the department to go through bias training on a regular basis to learn about inappropriate questions and behavior. I had no plans to work there, but I wanted to ensure that other employees and interviewees had a discrimination-free work environment.

They sent a reply 20 days later. The dean thanked me for raising the issue, and the department chair told me he would consider arranging training, but he didn't commit to any specific steps. The chair said the professor who made the comment was sorry his questions offended me, but that they weren't asked because of my gender—he asks every interviewee the same questions.

Unfortunately, the law is on his side: If he asks the questions of men and women, then they aren't against the law in Japan. That's frustrating for me because I don't think they are appropriate questions to ask anyone, regardless of their gender.

The entire ordeal has left me feeling helpless. I lost out on a potential postdoc opportunity. And when I complained about what I perceived to be unfair treatment, I didn't receive any assurances that the situation would change for the next scientist who interviews for a position.

In many countries, interviewers are taught not to ask interviewees about their home life. Where those kinds of questions are more culturally accepted, as in Japan, I'd argue that universities have a responsibility to push back against norms and ensure that job candidates are treated equally during the interview process. If they fail to do that, they'll risk driving away good candidates.

Above all, I want decision-makers to build a discrimination-free environment for all scientists. I hope that, one day, no interviewee will have to hear the question, “Do you plan to have children?”"
https://openalex.org/W3046665267,"In our daily life, we often interact with objects using both hands raising the question the question to what extent information between the hands is shared. It has, for instance, been shown that curvature adaptation aftereffects can transfer from the adapted hand to the non-adapted hand. However, this transfer only occurred for dynamic exploration, e.g. by moving a single finger over a surface, but not for static exploration when keeping static contact with the surface and combining the information from different parts of the hand. This raises the question to what extent adaptation to object shape is shared between the hands when both hands are used in static fashion simultaneously and the object shape estimates require information from both hands. Here we addressed this question in three experiments using a slant adaptation paradigm. In Experiment 1 we investigated whether an aftereffect of static bimanual adaptation occurs at all and whether it transfers to conditions in which one hand was moving. In Experiment 2 participants adapted either to a felt slanted surface or simply be holding their hands in mid-air at similar positions, to investigate to what extent the effects of static bimanual adaptation are posture-based rather than object based. Experiment 3 further explored the idea that bimanual adaptation is largely posture based. We found that bimanual adaptation using static touch did lead to aftereffects when using the same static exploration mode for testing. However, the aftereffect did not transfer to any exploration mode that included a dynamic component. Moreover, we found similar aftereffects both with and without a haptic surface. Thus, we conclude that static bimanual adaptation is of proprioceptive nature and does not occur at the level at which the object is represented."

The effectiveness of these systems depends on their usability and extent of use by their intended audiences. We conducted an online survey of academics and government professionals in the United States to compare their species occurrence data needs and their perceptions and use of web-based species occurrence information systems. Our results indicate that although views and perceptions held by academics and government professionals about the importance, usefulness, and ease of use of these information systems tend to be similar, there were differences in their use of species occurrence data and web-based species occurrence information systems. The baseline information obtained in this study will help inform future directions for improvements in species occurrence information systems."
