https://openalex.org/W2924359886,"The interplay between an evolving cancer and a dynamic immune microenvironment remains unclear. Here we analyse 258 regions from 88 early-stage, untreated non-small-cell lung cancers using RNA sequencing and histopathology-assessed tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte estimates. Immune infiltration varied both between and within tumours, with different mechanisms of neoantigen presentation dysfunction enriched in distinct immune microenvironments. Sparsely infiltrated tumours exhibited a waning of neoantigen editing during tumour evolution, indicative of historical immune editing, or copy-number loss of previously clonal neoantigens. Immune-infiltrated tumour regions exhibited ongoing immunoediting, with either loss of heterozygosity in human leukocyte antigens or depletion of expressed neoantigens. We identified promoter hypermethylation of genes that contain neoantigenic mutations as an epigenetic mechanism of immunoediting. Our results suggest that the immune microenvironment exerts a strong selection pressure in early-stage, untreated non-small-cell lung cancers that produces multiple routes to immune evasion, which are clinically relevant and forecast poor disease-free survival."
https://openalex.org/W2923034350,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative tauopathy that is associated with repetitive head impacts or exposure to blast waves. First described as punch-drunk syndrome and dementia pugilistica in retired boxers1-3, CTE has since been identified in former participants of other contact sports, ex-military personnel and after physical abuse4-7. No disease-modifying therapies currently exist, and diagnosis requires an autopsy. CTE is defined by an abundance of hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons, astrocytes and cell processes around blood vessels8,9. This, together with the accumulation of tau inclusions in cortical layers II and III, distinguishes CTE from Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies10,11. However, the morphologies of tau filaments in CTE and the mechanisms by which brain trauma can lead to their formation are unknown. Here we determine the structures of tau filaments from the brains of three individuals with CTE at resolutions down to 2.3 Å, using cryo-electron microscopy. We show that filament structures are identical in the three cases but are distinct from those of Alzheimer's and Pick's diseases, and from those formed in vitro12-15. Similar to Alzheimer's disease12,14,16-18, all six brain tau isoforms assemble into filaments in CTE, and residues K274-R379 of three-repeat tau and S305-R379 of four-repeat tau form the ordered core of two identical C-shaped protofilaments. However, a different conformation of the β-helix region creates a hydrophobic cavity that is absent in tau filaments from the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. This cavity encloses an additional density that is not connected to tau, which suggests that the incorporation of cofactors may have a role in tau aggregation in CTE. Moreover, filaments in CTE have distinct protofilament interfaces to those of Alzheimer's disease. Our structures provide a unifying neuropathological criterion for CTE, and support the hypothesis that the formation and propagation of distinct conformers of assembled tau underlie different neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2922659455,"In condensed matter systems, chiral topological nodes are robust band crossing points in momentum space that carry nonzero Chern numbers. The chirality is manifested by the presence of surface Fermi arcs connecting the projections of nodes with opposite Chern numbers. In addition to the well-known Weyl nodes, theorists have proposed several other types of chiral topological nodes in condensed matter systems, but the direct experimental evidence of their existence is still lacking. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we reveal two types of new chiral nodes, namely the spin-1 nodes and charge-2 Dirac nodes, at the band crossing points near the Fermi level in CoSi, the projections of which on the (001) surface are connected by topologically protected surface Fermi arcs. As these chiral nodes in CoSi are enforced at the Brillouin zone (BZ) center and corner by the crystalline symmetries, the surface Fermi arcs connecting their projections form a non-contractible path traversing the entire (001) surface BZ, in sharp contrast to pairs of Weyl nodes with small separation. Our work marks the first experimental observation of chiral topological nodes beyond the Weyl nodes both in the bulk and on the surface in condensed matter systems."
https://openalex.org/W2923815109,"The quantum behaviour of electrons in materials is the foundation of modern electronics and information technology1-11, and quantum materials with topological electronic and optical properties are essential for realizing quantized electronic responses that can be used for next generation technology. Here we report the first observation of topological quantum properties of chiral crystals6,7 in the RhSi family. We find that this material class hosts a quantum phase of matter that exhibits nearly ideal topological surface properties originating from the crystals' structural chirality. Electrons on the surface of these crystals show a highly unusual helicoid fermionic structure that spirals around two high-symmetry momenta, indicating electronic topological chirality. The existence of bulk multiply degenerate band fermions is guaranteed by the crystal symmetries; however, to determine the topological invariant or charge in these chiral crystals, it is essential to identify and study the helicoid topology of the arc states. The helicoid arcs that we observe on the surface characterize the topological charges of ±2, which arise from bulk higher-spin chiral fermions. These topological conductors exhibit giant Fermi arcs of maximum length (π), which are orders of magnitude larger than those found in known chiral Weyl fermion semimetals5,8-11. Our results demonstrate an electronic topological state of matter on structurally chiral crystals featuring helicoid-arc quantum states. Such exotic multifold chiral fermion semimetal states could be used to detect a quantized photogalvanic optical response, the chiral magnetic effect and other optoelectronic phenomena predicted for this class of materials6."
https://openalex.org/W2923787428,"Mutations in epigenetic pathways are common oncogenic drivers. Histones, the fundamental substrates for chromatin-modifying and remodelling enzymes, are mutated in tumours including gliomas, sarcomas, head and neck cancers, and carcinosarcomas. Classical 'oncohistone' mutations occur in the N-terminal tail of histone H3 and affect the function of polycomb repressor complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2). However, the prevalence and function of histone mutations in other tumour contexts is unknown. Here we show that somatic histone mutations occur in approximately 4% (at a conservative estimate) of diverse tumour types and in crucial regions of histone proteins. Mutations occur in all four core histones, in both the N-terminal tails and globular histone fold domains, and at or near residues that contain important post-translational modifications. Many globular domain mutations are homologous to yeast mutants that abrogate the need for SWI/SNF function, occur in the key regulatory 'acidic patch' of histones H2A and H2B, or are predicted to disrupt the H2B-H4 interface. The histone mutation dataset and the hypotheses presented here on the effect of the mutations on important chromatin functions should serve as a resource and starting point for the chromatin and cancer biology fields in exploring an expanding role of histone mutations in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2925222192,"In Gram-negative bacteria, lipopolysaccharide is essential for outer membrane formation and antibiotic resistance. The seven lipopolysaccharide transport (Lpt) proteins A–G move lipopolysaccharide from the inner to the outer membrane. The ATP-binding cassette transporter LptB2FG, which tightly associates with LptC, extracts lipopolysaccharide out of the inner membrane. The mechanism of the LptB2FG–LptC complex (LptB2FGC) and the role of LptC in lipopolysaccharide transport are poorly understood. Here we characterize the structures of LptB2FG and LptB2FGC in nucleotide-free and vanadate-trapped states, using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. These structures resolve the bound lipopolysaccharide, reveal transporter–lipopolysaccharide interactions with side-chain details and uncover how the capture and extrusion of lipopolysaccharide are coupled to conformational rearrangements of LptB2FGC. LptC inserts its transmembrane helix between the two transmembrane domains of LptB2FG, which represents a previously unknown regulatory mechanism for ATP-binding cassette transporters. Our results suggest a role for LptC in achieving efficient lipopolysaccharide transport, by coordinating the action of LptB2FG in the inner membrane and Lpt protein interactions in the periplasm. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of LptB2FGC, in nucleotide-free and vanadate-trapped states, reveal the mechanism of lipopolysaccharide extraction from the inner membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and a role for LptC in efficient lipopolysaccharide transport."
https://openalex.org/W2923686899,"Gram-negative bacteria are surrounded by an inner cytoplasmic membrane and by an outer membrane, which serves as a protective barrier to limit entry of many antibiotics. The distinctive properties of the outer membrane are due to the presence of lipopolysaccharide1. This large glycolipid, which contains numerous sugars, is made in the cytoplasm; a complex of proteins forms a membrane-to-membrane bridge that mediates transport of lipopolysaccharide from the inner membrane to the cell surface1. The inner-membrane components of the protein bridge comprise an ATP-binding cassette transporter that powers transport, but how this transporter ensures unidirectional lipopolysaccharide movement across the bridge to the outer membrane is unknown2. Here we describe two crystal structures of a five-component inner-membrane complex that contains all the proteins required to extract lipopolysaccharide from the membrane and pass it to the protein bridge. Analysis of these structures, combined with biochemical and genetic experiments, identifies the path of lipopolysaccharide entry into the cavity of the transporter and up to the bridge. We also identify a protein gate that must open to allow movement of substrate from the cavity onto the bridge. Lipopolysaccharide entry into the cavity is ATP-independent, but ATP is required for lipopolysaccharide movement past the gate and onto the bridge. Our findings explain how the inner-membrane transport complex controls efficient unidirectional transport of lipopolysaccharide against its concentration gradient."
https://openalex.org/W2925034948,"The essential but enigmatic functions of sleep1,2 must be reflected in molecular changes sensed by the brain's sleep-control systems. In the fruitfly Drosophila, about two dozen sleep-inducing neurons3 with projections to the dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) adjust their electrical output to sleep need4, via the antagonistic regulation of two potassium conductances: the leak channel Sandman imposes silence during waking, whereas increased A-type currents through Shaker support tonic firing during sleep5. Here we show that oxidative byproducts of mitochondrial electron transport6,7 regulate the activity of dFB neurons through a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) cofactor bound to the oxidoreductase domain8,9 of Shaker's KVβ subunit, Hyperkinetic10,11. Sleep loss elevates mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in dFB neurons, which register this rise by converting Hyperkinetic to the NADP+-bound form. The oxidation of the cofactor slows the inactivation of the A-type current and boosts the frequency of action potentials, thereby promoting sleep. Energy metabolism, oxidative stress, and sleep-three processes implicated independently in lifespan, ageing, and degenerative disease6,12-14-are thus mechanistically connected. KVβ substrates8,15,16 or inhibitors that alter the ratio of bound NADPH to NADP+ (and hence the record of sleep debt or waking time) represent prototypes of potential sleep-regulatory drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2923675576,"In the study of balance and postural control the (Single) Inverted Pendulum model (SIP) has been taken for a long time as an acceptable paradigm, with the implicit assumption that only ankle rotations are relevant for describing and explaining sway movements. However, more recent kinematic analysis of quiet standing revealed that hip motion cannot be neglected at all and that ankle-hip oscillatory patterns are characterized by complex in-phase and anti-phase interactions, suggesting that the SIP model should be substituted by a DIP (Double Inverted Pendulum) model. It was also suggested that DIP control could be characterized as a kind of optimal bi-axial active controller whose goal is minimizing the acceleration of the global CoM (Center of Mass). We propose here an alternative where active feedback control is applied in an intermittent manner only to the ankle joint, whereas the hip joint is stabilized by a passive stiffness mechanism. The active control impulses are delivered to the ankle joint as a function of the delayed state vector (tilt rotation angle + tilt rotational speed) of a Virtual Inverted Pendulum (VIP), namely a pendulum that links the ankle to the CoM, embedded in the real DIP. Simulations of such DIP/VIP model, with the hybrid control mechanism, show that it can reproduce the in-phase/anti-phase interaction patterns of the two joints described by several experimental studies. Moreover, the simulations demonstrate that the DIP/VIP model can also reproduce the measured minimization of the CoM acceleration, as an indirect biomechanical consequence of the dynamic interaction between the active control of the ankle joint and the passive control of the hip joint. We suggest that although the SIP model is literally false, because it ignores the ankle-hip coordination, it is functionally correct and practically acceptable for experimental studies that focus on the postural oscillations of the CoM."

https://openalex.org/W2924566717,"Mangroves are an important ecosystem-based protection against cyclonic storm surge. As the surge moves through the mangrove forest, the tree roots, trunks, and leaves obstruct the flow of water. Damage to adjacent coastal lands is attenuated mainly by reducing (i) surge height, which determines the area and depth of inundation and (ii) water flow velocity. But the extent of mangrove protection depends on the density of tree plantings and the diameter of trunks and roots, along with an array of other forest characteristics (e.g., floor shape, bathymetry, spectral features of waves, and tidal stage at which waves enter the forest). Making efficient use of mangroves' protective capacity has been hindered by a lack of location-specific information. This study helps to fill that gap by estimating reduction in storm surge height and water flow velocity from mangroves at selected sites in cyclone-prone, coastal Bangladesh. A hydrodynamic model for the Bay of Bengal, based on the MIKE21FM system, was run multiple times to simulate the surge of cyclone Sidr (2007) at the Barisal coast. Estimates of surge height and water flow velocity were recorded first without mangroves and then with mangroves of various forest widths and planting densities, including specific information on local topography, bathymetry, and Manning's coefficients estimated from species' root and trunk systems. The results show a significant reduction in water flow velocity (29-92%) and a modest reduction in surge height (4-16.5 cm). These findings suggest that healthy mangroves can contribute to significant savings in rehabilitation and maintenance costs by protecting embankments from breaching, toe-erosion, and other damage."
https://openalex.org/W2924483711,"Conventional generators in power grids are steadily substituted with new renewable sources of electric power. The latter are connected to the grid via inverters and as such have little, if any rotational inertia. The resulting reduction of total inertia raises important issues of power grid stability, especially over short-time scales. With the motivation in mind to investigate how inertia reduction influences the transient dynamics following a fault in a large-scale electric power grid, we have constructed a model of the high voltage synchronous grid of continental Europe. To assess grid stability and resilience against disturbance, we numerically investigate frequency deviations as well as rates of change of frequency (RoCoF) following abrupt power losses. The magnitude of RoCoF’s and frequency deviations strongly depend on the fault location, and we find the largest effects for faults located on the support of the slowest mode—the Fiedler mode—of the network Laplacian matrix. This mode essentially vanishes over Belgium, Eastern France, Western Germany, northern Italy and Switzerland. Buses inside these regions are only weakly affected by faults occuring outside. Conversely, faults inside these regions have only a local effect and disturb only weakly outside buses. Following this observation, we reduce rotational inertia through three different procedures by either (i) reducing inertia on the Fiedler mode, (ii) reducing inertia homogeneously and (iii) reducing inertia outside the Fiedler mode. We find that procedure (iii) has little effect on disturbance propagation, while procedure (i) leads to the strongest increase of RoCoF and frequency deviations. This shows that, beyond absorbing frequency disturbances following nearby faults, inertia also mitigates frequency disturbances from distant power losses, provided both the fault and the inertia are located on the support of the slowest modes of the grid Laplacian. These results for our model of the European transmission grid are corroborated by numerical investigations on the ERCOT transmission grid."
https://openalex.org/W2922632604,"The non-canonical NF-κB signalling cascade is essential for lymphoid organogenesis, B cell maturation, osteoclast differentiation, and inflammation in mammals1,2; dysfunction of this system is associated with human diseases, including immunological disorders and cancer3–6. Although expression of NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK, also known as MAP3K14) is the rate-limiting step in non-canonical NF-κB pathway activation2,7, the mechanisms by which transcriptional responses are regulated remain largely unknown. Here we show that the sine oculis homeobox (SIX) homologue family transcription factors SIX1 and SIX2 are integral components of the non-canonical NF-κB signalling cascade. The developmentally silenced SIX proteins are reactivated in differentiated macrophages by NIK-mediated suppression of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Consequently, SIX1 and SIX2 target a subset of inflammatory gene promoters and directly inhibit the trans-activation function of the transcription factors RELA and RELB in a negative feedback circuit. In support of a physiologically pivotal role for SIX proteins in host immunity, a human SIX1 transgene suppressed inflammation and promoted the recovery of mice from endotoxic shock. In addition, SIX1 and SIX2 protected RAS/P53-driven non-small-cell lung carcinomas from inflammatory cell death induced by SMAC-mimetic chemotherapeutic agents (small-molecule activators of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway). Our findings identify a NIK–SIX signalling axis that fine-tunes inflammatory gene expression programs under both physiological and pathological conditions. Non-canonical NF-κB is regulated by a negative feedback loop involving NIK-mediated activation of SIX1 and SIX2."
https://openalex.org/W2952786818,"Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD), the most common congenital heart defect, is characterized by a hole in the septum between the right and left ventricles. The pathogenesis of VSD is unknown in most clinical cases. There is a paucity of data relevant to epigenetic changes in VSD. The placenta is a fetal tissue crucial in cardiac development and a potentially useful surrogate for evaluating the development of heart tissue. To understand epigenetic mechanisms that may play a role in the development of VSD, genome-wide DNA methylation assay on placentas of 8 term subjects with isolated VSD and no known or suspected genetic syndromes and 10 unaffected controls was performed using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip assay. We identified a total of 80 highly accurate potential CpGs in 80 genes for detection of VSD; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC) 1.0 with significant 95% CI (FDR) p-values < 0.05 for each individual locus. The biological processes and functions for many of these differentially methylated genes are previously known to be associated with heart development or disease, including cardiac ventricle development (HEY2, ISL1), heart looping (SRF), cardiac muscle cell differentiation (ACTC1, HEY2), cardiac septum development (ISL1), heart morphogenesis (SRF, HEY2, ISL1, HEYL), Notch signaling pathway (HEY2, HEYL), cardiac chamber development (ISL1), and cardiac muscle tissue development (ACTC1, ISL1). In addition, we identified 8 microRNAs that have the potential to be biomarkers for the detection of VSD including: miR-191, miR-548F1, miR-148A, miR-423, miR-92B, miR-611, miR-2110, and miR-548H4. To our knowledge this is the first report in which placental analysis has been used for determining the pathogenesis of and predicting VSD."
https://openalex.org/W2925117958,"Background Anemia during pregnancy is a major public health problem globally with multiple causes including inadequate dietary intakes. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of nutrition education on nutritional knowledge, hemoglobin level and dietary intake of anemic pregnant women. Materials and methods A quasi-experimental study was conducted among 115 mild to moderately anemic pregnant women attending ante natal clinics. Pregnant women were consecutively enrolled and assigned to receive nutrition education and diet plan in intervention group (n = 58) and general education only in control group (n = 57). The nutrition education was given to pregnant women on individual basis at the time of enrollment and follow-ups were done through biweekly phone calls and every 4 weeks during ANC visits. Baseline data were collected using semi-structure questionnaire for interview and hemoglobin level was also measured. Data were collected after 10 weeks of nutrition education intervention. Independent sample t-test was used to compare differences between the two groups. Results Out of 115 pregnant women enrolled, 107 completed the study (Intervention: 53; Control: 54). At the end of the nutrition education intervention and iron rich food based diet plan, the change in hemoglobin level was significantly high in the intervention over control group [0.56±0.40gm/dl vs. 0.16±0.82gm/dl, p = 0.002]. The change in the maternal nutritional knowledge score on anemia and iron rich foods was significantly high in the intervention over control group [8.26±4.57 vs. 1.05±6.59, p<0.001].Consumption of iron rich food was significantly high in the intervention group (P<0.05). Conclusion Provision of nutrition education and iron rich food based diet plan was significantly associated with improved hemoglobin levels, improved dietary intake and nutritional knowledge on anemia and iron rich foods."
https://openalex.org/W2924249028,"Background and objectives Adherence to antiretroviral treatment is a key challenge for paediatric HIV care. Among children and adolescents living with HIV, lower levels of adherence have been reported compared to adults. Individual, caregiver-, health services-related and sociocultural factors were shown to impact on these outcomes. Study objectives were to assess adherence in a paediatric population in rural Tanzania comparing two measurement methods, and to investigate the association between virologic suppression and demographic, clinical, drug- and family-related factors. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among children and adolescents enrolled in Bukumbi HIV Care and Treatment Clinic (Misungwi district, Mwanza region) in the north of Tanzania, where the HIV prevalence is 7.2%. Adherence was measured through viral load and pill count. Kappa statistics assessed the level of agreement between the methods; bivariate and multivariable analyses identified factors independently associated with virologic suppression. Results N = 72 participants (n = 49 children; n = 23 adolescents) with a median age of eight years were enrolled. 62.5% and 65.3% of the individuals presented an optimal adherence according to viral load and pill count respectively, but among 40% viral load results diverged from the pill count method. In multivariable analysis, living outside Misungwi district and having CD4 counts above 500/μl were significantly associated with optimal adherence. Conclusion Children and adolescents living with HIV in Mwanza show high rates of suboptimal adherence. The poor agreement between pill count and viral load results raises concerns about the interpretation of these measurements in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2951007456,"The association between GRE scores and academic success in graduate programs is currently of national interest. GRE scores are often assumed to be predictive of student success in graduate school. However, we found no such association in admission data from Vanderbilt's Initiative for Maximizing Student Diversity (IMSD), which recruited historically underrepresented students for graduate study in the biomedical sciences at Vanderbilt University spanning a wide range of GRE scores. This study avoids the typical biases of most GRE investigations of performance where primarily high-achievers on the GRE were admitted. GRE scores, while collected at admission, were not used or consulted for admission decisions and comprise the full range of percentiles, from 1% to 91%. We report on the 32 students recruited to the Vanderbilt IMSD from 2007-2011, of which 28 completed the PhD to date. While the data set is not large, the predictive trends between GRE and long-term graduate outcomes (publications, first author publications, time to degree, predoctoral fellowship awards, and faculty evaluations) are remarkably null and there is sufficient precision to rule out even mild relationships between GRE and these outcomes. Career outcomes are encouraging; many students are in postdocs, and the rest are in regular stage-appropriate career environments for such a cohort, including tenure track faculty, biotech and entrepreneurship careers."

Mammalian oocytes and early embryos are mitochondria rich, but mitochondrial dynamics during preimplantation embryo development is not well-studied. To investigate whether PINK1 is required for mitochondrial dynamics in porcine preimplantation embryos, gene knockdown and inhibitors were used, and mitochondrial dynamics were observed by transmission electron microscopy. PINK1 knockdown significantly impaired blastocyst formation and quality, induced mitochondrial elongation and swelling, and reduced mitochondrial DNA copy number. PINK1 knockdown–induced mitochondrial elongation caused mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and ATP deficiency, significantly increasing autophagy and apoptosis.

ME/CFS patients (n = 14) and matched sedentary controls (n = 11) were subjected to cardiopulmonary exercise on 2 consecutive days and followed up to 7 days post-exercise, and longitudinal whole blood samples analyzed by RNA-seq. Although ME/CFS patients showed significant worsening of symptoms following exercise versus controls, with 8 of 14 ME/CFS patients showing reduced oxygen consumption () on day 2, transcriptome analysis yielded only 6 differentially expressed gene (DEG) candidates when comparing ME/CFS patients to controls across all time points. None of the DEGs were related to immune signaling, and no DEGs were found in ME/CFS patients before and after exercise. Virome composition (P = 0.746 by chi-square test) and number of viral reads (P = 0.098 by paired t-test) were not significantly associated with PEM.

https://openalex.org/W2925254053,"Activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is associated with tissue fibrosis, and inhibition of p38 MAPK can attenuate the progression of fibrosis. We aimed to investigate whether p38 MAPK activity in kidney tissue confirmed by immunohistochemical staining is associated with renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis in chronic kidney disease patients with IgA nephropathy. We collected kidney biopsy specimens from 341 IgA nephropathy patients and 15 control patients to identify the clinical and histopathological factors associated with kidney tubulointerstitial fibrosis and to find an association between kidney phosphorylated p38 immunoactivity and pathological grading. In addition, we aimed to investigate whether the anti-fibrotic effect of p38 MAPK inhibition can be identified by assessing the immunostaining intensity of phosphorylated p38 in kidney tissue. A renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis model was introduced using 7-week-old C57BL/6 mice subjected to unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). The p38 MAPK inhibitor SB-731445 was injected intraperitoneally every day for 7 days, and changes in renal fibrosis-associated markers were investigated. Assessment of kidney biopsy specimens from IgA nephropathy patients revealed that the degree of interstitial fibrosis was significantly associated with the tissue immunoactivity of phosphorylated p38. High-grade interstitial fibrosis was associated with a low glomerular filtration rate, high proteinuria, and high-grade histopathological changes, including tubular atrophy, interstitial inflammation, and glomerular sclerosis. In a mouse UUO model, renal protein expression of COL1 and phosphorylated p38 were significantly increased, and the protein expression of COL1 and phosphorylated p38 decreased in mice administered 10 mg/kg/day p38 MAPK inhibitor. We found that kidney interstitial fibrosis is associated with increased immunoactivity of phosphorylated p38 in a UUO mouse model and in human IgA nephropathy patients and that the anti-fibrotic effect of p38 MAPK inhibition can be confirmed using immunohistochemical staining for phosphorylated p38 in kidney tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2924336763,"This study introduces a new method to understand how added load affects human performance across a broad range of athletic tasks (ten obstacles) embedded in an outdoor obstacle course. The method employs an array of wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) to wirelessly record the movements of major body segments to derive obstacle-specific metrics of performance. The effects of load are demonstrated on (N = 22) participants who each complete the obstacle course under four conditions including unloaded (twice) and with loads of 15% and 30% of their body weight (a total of 88 trials across the group of participants). The IMU-derived performance metrics reveal marked degradations in performance with increasing load across eight of the ten obstacles. Overall, this study demonstrates the significant potential in using this wearable technology to evaluate human performance across multiple tasks and, simultaneously, the adverse effects of body-borne loads on performance. The study addresses a major need of military organizations worldwide that frequently employ standardized obstacle courses to understand how added loads influence warfighter performance. Importantly, the findings and conclusions drawn from IMU data would not be possible using traditional timing metrics used to evaluate task performance."
https://openalex.org/W2923142038,"Large survey databases for aging-related analysis are often examined to discover key factors that affect a dependent variable of interest. Typically, this analysis is performed with methods assuming linear dependencies between variables. Such assumptions however do not hold in many cases, wherein data are linked by way of non-linear dependencies. This in turn requires applications of analytic methods, which are more accurate in identifying potentially non-linear dependencies. Here, we objectively compared the feature selection performance of several frequently-used linear selection methods and three non-linear selection methods in the context of large survey data. These methods were assessed using both synthetic and real-world datasets, wherein relationships between the features and dependent variables were known in advance. In contrast to linear methods, we found that the non-linear methods offered better overall feature selection performance than linear methods in all usage conditions. Moreover, the performance of the non-linear methods was more stable, being unaffected by the inclusion or exclusion of variables from the datasets. These properties make non-linear feature selection methods a potentially preferable tool for both hypothesis-driven and exploratory analyses for aging-related datasets."
https://openalex.org/W2922653804,"Introduction The relation between TV viewing and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is controversial; prior work focused exclusively on whether TV viewing of disaster events constitutes a traumatic stressor that causes PTSD. This study evaluates a possible bidirectional relation between PTSD and TV viewing in community-dwelling women. Methods Data are from the PTSD subsample of the Nurses’ Health II study, an ongoing prospective study of women aged 24–42 years at enrollment and who have been followed biennially (N = 50,020). Trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms (including date of onset) were assessed via the Brief Trauma Questionnaire and the Short Screening Scale for DSM-IV PTSD. Average TV viewing was reported at 5 times over 18 years of follow-up. Linear mixed models assessed differences in TV viewing patterns by trauma/PTSD status. Among women with trauma/PTSD onset during follow-up (N = 14,374), linear spline mixed models assessed differences in TV viewing patterns before and after PTSD onset. Results Women with high PTSD symptoms reported more TV viewing (hours/wk) compared to trauma-unexposed women at all follow-up assessments (β = 0.14, SE = 0.01, p < .001). Among the women who experienced trauma during follow-up, significant increases in TV viewing (hours/day) prior to onset of high PTSD symptom levels were evident (β = 0.15, SE = 0.02, p < .001). Conclusions TV viewing following trauma exposure may be a marker of vulnerability for developing PTSD and also a consequence of having PTSD. High TV viewing levels may be linked with ineffective coping strategies or social isolation, which increase risk of developing PTSD."
https://openalex.org/W2922862741,"Lung inflammation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of many respiratory diseases that are in need of new therapeutic strategies. Previously, we showed that inhibition of α/β–hydrolase domain 6 (ABHD6) decreased macrophage activation and exerted anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, we thought to assess the effects of ABHD6 inhibition in a mouse model of acute lung injury (ALI) induced by intratracheal administration of lipopolysaccharides. ABHD6 inhibition with N-methyl-N-{[3-(4-pyridinyl)phenyl]methyl}-carbamic acid 4′-(aminocarbonyl)(l,1′-biphenyl)-4-yl ester (WWL70) decreases most of the hallmarks of ALI, including neutrophil infiltration, cytokine secretion, and protein extravasation. mRNA expression of proinflammatory markers in the cells recovered in the bronchoalveolar lavage was also decreased. Interestingly, ABHD6 inhibition was more efficient than monoacylglycerol lipase inhibition by 4-nitrophenyl-4-[dibenzo(d)(14)dioxol-5-yl(hydroxy)methyl]piperidine-1-carboxylate. We also studied ABHD6 inhibition on primary alveolar macrophages and neutrophils to explore their potential implication in the effects of ABHD6 inhibition in vivo. Moreover, we quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry the levels of reported substrates of ABHD6 [i.e., 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and lysophospholipids]. The potential implication of these lipid mediators in the effects of WWL70 was further investigated on primary alveolar macrophages. Taken together, these data support ABHD6 inhibition as an interesting anti-inflammatory strategy in acute lung inflammation and assess the possible contribution of 2-AG and lysophospholipids in the observed effects.—Bottemanne, P., Paquot, A., Ameraoui, H., Alhouayek, M., Muccioli, G.

https://openalex.org/W2925157136,"While access to safe sanitation is a global issue, there are large disparities in access. Women living in informal settlements, in particular, are disproportionately affected by lack of access to sanitation. Without adequate sanitation, these women may resort to unsafe strategies to manage their sanitation needs, but limited research has focused specifically on this issue. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from women in the Mathare informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya in 2016. A latent class analysis (LCA) using the quantitative data yielded five distinct sanitation profiles (SP) among women in Mathare. In-depth interviews and sanitation walks with women added further detail about the characteristics of and motivations underlying each profile. Women’s sanitation profiles in these settlements are complex. A majority of women in this study utilized an unsafe method of disposal at least once in a 24-hour period that increased their risk of direct exposure to waste and harmful pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2924701589,"Low plasma CsA concentrations (<300–350 ng/mL) early following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is associated with an increased risk of developing acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD). Nevertheless, the current optimal target trough concentration for CsA following HSCT is considered to be 200–400 ng/mL. Here, we performed a retrospective analysis of a homogeneous group of 129 patients who received HSCT after non-myeloablative conditioning, and we analyzed the impact of CsA trough concentration measured during the first four weeks (CsA W1-4) on the incidence aGvHD, relapse-free survival (RFS), non-relapse mortality (NRM), overall survival (OS), and toxicity. The 180-day incidence of grade II-IV aGvHD was 25% (32/129 patients). In multivariate analysis the incidence of grade II-IV aGvHD was significantly lower among patients with a CsA W1-4 concentration ≥350 ng/mL compared to patients with a concentration <350 ng/mL (18% versus 38%, respectively; P = 0.007), with a hazard ration (HR) of 0.38 (95% CI: 0.19–0.77). In contrast, we found no correlation between CsA trough concentration and RFS, NRM, or OS. Moreover, we found an increased incidence of hypomagnesemia at higher CsA concentrations, but no difference in the incidence of acute renal toxicity, hepatic toxicity, or electrolyte imbalance. Interestingly, 30% of patients experienced hyponatremia with no apparent cause other than the use of CsA, with urinalysis suggesting SIADH as the underlying cause. Our findings suggest that a CsA trough concentration of 350–500 ng/mL might be more appropriate in the first month following non-myeloablative HSCT."
https://openalex.org/W2922709184,"Routine general anesthesia is considered to be safe in healthy individuals. However, pre-clinical studies in mice, rats, and monkeys have repeatedly demonstrated that exposure to anesthetic agents during early post-natal periods can lead to acute neurotoxicity. More concerning, later-life defects in cognition, assessed by behavioral assays for learning and memory, have been reported. Although the potential for anesthetics to damage the neonatal brain is well-documented, the clinical significance of the pre-clinical models in which damage is induced remains quite unclear. Here, we systematically evaluate critical physiological parameters in post-natal day 7 neonatal mice exposed to 1.5% isoflurane for 2-4 hours, the most common anesthesia induced neurotoxicity paradigm in this animal model. We find that 2 or more hours of anesthesia exposure results in dramatic respiratory and metabolic changes that may limit interpretation of this paradigm to the clinical situation. Our data indicate that neonatal mouse models of AIN are not necessarily appropriate representations of human exposures."
https://openalex.org/W2923063327,"We aimed to investigate the relationship between pesticide exposure and cognitive decline in a rural South Korean population. From July 2015 to December 2017, 200 randomly selected Korean Farmers Cohort study participants were recruited and of these, 169 participants were analyzed. Pesticide exposure was investigated using a standardized questionnaire, and the Korean-Montreal Cognitive Assessment (K-MoCA) was conducted. Cognitive decline was more frequent among those directly exposed to pesticides (P = 0.057). Pesticide exposure and cognitive decline were positively correlated in the group with direct exposure versus no exposure (crude odds ratio [OR], 2.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-6.04); this relationship was insignificant after adjustment (adjusted OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 0.57-3.92). There was a significant difference in the K-MoCA scores for each group based on pesticide exposure (P = 0.003). When we stratified by age, differences in the K-MoCA scores depending on the degree of pesticide exposure in the those aged 60 to 69 years were identified. Overall, there was a tendency towards an association between pesticide exposure and cognitive decline in rural Korean adult farmers. In our study, chronic pesticide exposure tended to have a greater impact in certain age group (60-69 years) than in those under 60 and over 70."
https://openalex.org/W2923077661,"Cancer progression results from a complex interplay between tumor cells and the extracellular milieu. In breast carcinoma, the stromal microenvironment has been suggested to play a major role in promoting tumor growth, progression, and invasion. The stroma of 154 resected specimens of invasive breast carcinoma of no special type was quantified using a digital image analyzer. Statistical analyses were performed between the quantity of stroma and survival, as well as between progression-free survival and clinicopathological data. Levels of myofibroblastic stroma varied from 0–46%, with a median of 15.1% and a standard deviation of 7.5. The myofibroblastic stromal reaction was statistically greater in grade 2 and 3 tumors (p = 0.029). Furthermore, there was a trend for worse progression-free survival in the group of node-negative tumors with strong smooth-muscle actin stromal expression (Log rank = 0.075). The present study demonstrates that the myofibroblastic reaction of breast invasive carcinoma of no special type is not merely a passive reaction, but seems to be an integral part of the neoplastic process by facilitating tumor progression and invasion. Additional, larger studies on mechanisms of stromal change are needed and may potentially lead to novel treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2949916791,"The pathogenesis of thymic epithelial tumors remains poorly elucidated. The PIK3/Akt/mTOR pathway plays a key role in various cancers; interestingly, several phase I/II studies have reported a positive effect of mTOR inhibitors in disease control in thymoma patients. A major limit for deciphering cellular and molecular events leading to the transformation of thymic epithelial cells or for testing drug candidates is the lack of reliable in vitro cell system. We analyzed protein expression and activation of key players of the Akt/ mTOR pathway namely Akt, mTOR, and P70S6K in eleven A, B and AB thymomas as well as in normal thymuses. While only Akt and phospho-Akt were expressed in normal thymuses, both Akt and mTOR were activated in thymomas. Phospho-P70S6K was expressed in all thymic tumors whatever their subtypes, and absent in normal thymus. Interestingly, we report the activation of Akt, mTOR and P70S6 proteins in primary thymic epithelial cells maintained for short period of time after their derivation from seven AB and B thymomas. Finally, we showed that rapamycin (100 nM) significantly reduced proliferation of thymoma- derived epithelial cells without inducing cell death. Our results suggest that the activation of the Akt/ mTOR pathway might participate to the cell proliferation associated with tumor growth. Ultimately, our data enhance the potential role of thymic epithelial cells derived from tissue specimens for in vitro exploration of molecular abnormalities in rare thymic tumors."

In this study, the presence of AAV NAb was investigated in cats, which serve as a larger and outbred animal model for the prediction of gene therapy outcomes in humans but also in cats.Serum/plasma samples from 230 client-owned Swiss cats and 20 specified pathogen-free cats were investigated for NAb to AAV1, AAV2, AAV5, AAV6, AAV7, AAV8 and AAV9 using in vitro transduction inhibition and a beta-galactosidase assay. NAb to all tested AAV serotypes were found. Of the client-owned cats, 53% had NAb to one or more of the AAV serotypes. NAb (≥1:10) were found at frequencies of 5% (AAV6) to 28% (AAV7). The highest titers were found against AAV7 (≥1:160). The NAb prevalence to AAV2, AAV7 and AAV9 differed geographically. Regarding titers ≥1:10 against single AAV serotypes, age, breed and sex of the cats were not associated with the NAb prevalence. Cats with titers ≥1:20 against AAV2 and titers ≥1:40 against AAV7 were significantly younger than cats with low/no titers, and purebred cats were significantly more likely than non-purebred cats to have NAb to AAV2 (≥1:40). Additionally, regarding NAb to all AAV combined, female cats were significantly more likely than male cats to have NAb titers ≥1:40. Preliminary data using AAV-DJ indicated that less pre-existing NAb to the hybrid AAV-DJ can be expected compared to the wild-type AAV serotypes. AAV NAb will need to be taken into account for future in vivo gene therapy studies in cats."
https://openalex.org/W2924286435,"Men in sub-Saharan Africa have lower rates of HIV testing and are less likely to initiate treatment compared to women. Service delivery dimensions are a key factor in facilitating engagement along the HIV treatment continuum for men and women, yet male specific overall perceptions of the service delivery environment have received little attention in West Africa. This study draws on qualitative data collected in Côte d’Ivoire to explore provider-level and structural factors affecting men’s engagement in HIV testing and treatment through interviews and focus group discussions conducted with health workers and men living with HIV (some on ART) or whose HIV status was unknown. Factors influencing decisions to test or initiate treatment were considered in terms of perceived benefits and costs. Men described costs at the interpersonal (client-provider) level, such as unwanted disclosure or stigma, which were weighed against the potential for social support and clinical guidance. Likewise, fear of unwanted disclosure operated at the facility level, as the layout of facilities sometimes grouped clients living with HIV together. Notably, the benefits men described from engaging in HIV testing and care all operated at the interpersonal level and none at the facility level. In light of the fact that provider- and facility-level factors influenced the perceptions and experiences of men along the treatment continuum, we offer recommendations to reduce barriers to testing and engagement in care related to service delivery."
https://openalex.org/W2924777570,"High Intensity Functional Training (HIFT) is a unique fitness method that promotes an active lifestyle and has seen exponential and continual growth over the last two decades. Motivation to exercise is likely to change over time as individuals’ motives to initiate exercise may be different than those which motivate them to maintain an exercise program. The purpose of this study was to examine the motivational factors reported by individuals who actively engage in HIFT with varying length of participation and competition levels. 737 adults (32.4 ± 8.2 years) with more than three-months of HIFT experience completed an online version of the Exercise Motivation Inventory (EMI-2) survey. Those who had greater length of participation reported more motives associated with relatedness (i.e., affiliation, competition) and enjoyment, while those with less HIFT participation were more motivated by body-related variables (i.e., weight management). Further, motivational variables (e.g., social recognition, affiliation, challenge) varied depending on whether or not individuals had competed in an online qualifier. Understanding these differences in motivation may aid in exercise promotion, initiation, and adherence, and moreover promote long-term physical and mental health benefits."
https://openalex.org/W2925117191,"Introduction Chronic respiratory disease is a common cause of morbidity in children with HIV infection. We investigated longitudinal lung function trends among HIV-infected children, to describe the evolution of lung disease and assess the effect of anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Methods Prospective follow-up of two cohorts of HIV-infected children, aged 6 to 16 years, in Harare, Zimbabwe; one group were ART-naïve at enrolment, the other established on ART for a median of 4.7-years. Standardised spirometric assessments were repeated over a 2-year follow-up period. Forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were expressed as Global Lung Initiative defined z-scores (FEV1z and FVCz). Linear mixed-effects regression modelling of lung function was performed, with co-variate parameters evaluated by likelihood ratio comparison. Results We included 271 ART-naïve and 197 ART-established children (median age 11 years in both groups) incorporating 1144 spirometric assessments. Changes in FEV1 and FVC were associated with age at ART initiation and body mass index for both cohorts. Our models estimate that ART initiation earlier in life could prevent a deterioration of 0.04 FVCz/year. In the ART-naïve cohort, likelihood ratio comparison suggested an improvement in 0.09 FVCz/year during the two years following treatment initiation, but no evidence for this among participants established on ART. Conclusion Early ART initiation and improved nutrition are positively associated with lung function and are important modifiable factors. An initial improvement in lung growth was seen in the first 2-years following ART initiation, although this did not appear to be sustained beyond this timeframe."
https://openalex.org/W2925139973,"A Box-Behnken designed study was completed to predict growth performance, carcass characteristics and plasma hormone and metabolite levels as influenced by dietary energy, amino acid densities and starch to lipid ratios in male broiler chickens. The design comprised three dietary energy densities (11.25, 12.375 and 13.5 MJ/kg), three digestible lysine concentrations (9.2, 10.65 and 12.1 g/kg) and three starch to lipid ratios (4.5, 12.25 and 20.0) in broiler diets based on maize and soybean meal. Each of thirteen dietary treatments was offered to 10 replicates of 15 birds per replicate floor pen or a total of 1,950 Ross 308 male broiler chickens from 21 to 35 days post-hatch. Increasing dietary energy decreased feed intake with a quadratic relationship between feed intake and dietary standardised ileal digestible (SID) Lys concentrations, where increasing SID Lys initially increased and then depressed feed intake. Increasing dietary amino acid density increased body weight gain and carcass weight; however, dietary energy did not influence body weight gain, carcass and breast meat weight. Feed efficiency was positively influenced by energy and amino acid densities but negatively influenced by starch to lipid ratios and energy and amino acids had more pronounced impacts than starch to lipid ratios. This study indicated that both energy and amino acid densities regulate feed intakes in broiler chickens. Body weight gain of modern broiler chickens is more responsive to amino acid densities; nevertheless, dietary energy density continues to play an important role in protein utilisation, as reflected in significantly reduced plasma uric acid levels."
https://openalex.org/W2925322680,"Background and objectives This study explored whether, for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), changes to the 24-hour composition of physical activity (PA), sedentary behaviour (SB) and sleep were associated with changes in symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL); and how time re-allocations between these behaviours were associated with changes in outcomes. Methods This study pools data on people with COPD drawn from two previous studies: a randomised controlled trial of cognitive behavioural therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation and a usual care cohort. Participants recalled behaviours and completed symptom and HRQoL assessments at baseline (T0) and four months (T1). Linear mixed-effects models (pooled control/intervention samples) predicted changes in outcomes from T0 to T1 with a change to the 24-hour behaviour composition; compositional isotemporal substitution predicted change in outcomes when re-allocating time between behaviours. Results Valid data were obtained for 95 participants (forced expiratory volume in one second %predicted = 49.6±15.3) at T0 and T1. A change in the 24-hour behaviour composition was associated with a change in anxiety (p<0.01) and mastery (p<0.01), but not breathlessness, depression or fatigue. When modelling time re-allocation with compositional isotemporal substitution, more time re-allocated to higher intensity PA or sleep was associated with favourable changes in outcomes; re-allocating time to SB or light PA was associated with unfavourable changes in outcomes. The direction of association, however, could not be determined. Conclusion To improve the overall health and wellbeing of people with COPD, intervention approaches that optimise the composition of PA, SB and sleep may be beneficial."
https://openalex.org/W4245001234,"Testosterone is associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease. This study evaluated cardiac remodeling 60 days after myocardial infarction (MI) in rats with testosterone deficiency. One week after castration, the animals underwent myocardial infarction. Rats were divided into four groups: orchidectomized (OCT); orchidectomized and infarcted (OCT+MI), MI and control (Sham). The myocyte cross-sectional area and the papillary muscle contractility were evaluated 8 weeks after MI. The coronary bed was perfused with Biodur E20 resin to evaluate the neovascularization after MI. Data were expressed as mean ± SEM followed by ANOVA. Castration reduced myocyte hypertrophy when compared to Sham and myocardial infarction alone as well as preserved the contraction force and activation time after myocardial infarction. After beta-adrenergic stimulation, activation and relaxation kinetics were less impaired in the OCT+MI group than in the MI group. Contraction force was preserved in the OCT+MI group after beta-adrenergic stimulation. Multiple scanning electronic microscope images were obtained to characterize changes in the coronary arteries. Capillary density index was increased in the MI and OCT+MI groups compared with control. The MI and OCT+MI groups were characterized by irregular vessel arrangements with distorted shape, abrupt changes in vessel direction, as well as abrupt changes in diameter after bifurcations when compared to Sham and OCT. The results indicated that testosterone deficiency attenuates adverse cardiac remodeling after MI. Novel findings in this study were that testosterone deficiency in rats, induced by castration, changes the later remodeling after MI, when compared with non castrated rats. The absence of this androgenous hormone seems to be benefic against pathological hypertrophy."

https://openalex.org/W2922889008,"Causal inference—the process of deciding whether two incoming signals come from the same source—is an important step in audiovisual (AV) speech perception. This research explored causal inference and perception of incongruent AV English consonants. Nine adults were presented auditory, visual, congruent AV, and incongruent AV consonant-vowel syllables. Incongruent AV stimuli included auditory and visual syllables with matched vowels, but mismatched consonants. Open-set responses were collected. For most incongruent syllables, participants were aware of the mismatch between auditory and visual signals (59.04%) or reported the auditory syllable (33.73%). Otherwise, participants reported the visual syllable (1.13%) or some other syllable (6.11%). Statistical analyses were used to assess whether visual distinctiveness and place, voice, and manner features predicted responses. Mismatch responses occurred more when the auditory and visual consonants were visually distinct, when place and manner differed across auditory and visual consonants, and for consonants with high visual accuracy. Auditory responses occurred more when the auditory and visual consonants were visually similar, when place and manner were the same across auditory and visual stimuli, and with consonants produced further back in the mouth. Visual responses occurred more when voicing and manner were the same across auditory and visual stimuli, and for front and middle consonants. Other responses were variable, but typically matched the visual place, auditory voice, and auditory manner of the input. Overall, results indicate that causal inference and incongruent AV consonant perception depend on salience and reliability of auditory and visual inputs and degree of redundancy between auditory and visual inputs. A parameter-free computational model of incongruent AV speech perception based on unimodal confusions, with a causal inference rule, was applied. Data from the current study present an opportunity to test and improve the generalizability of current AV speech integration models."

Some decades ago many authors, in the absence of other available indicators, used to rely on certain measures of human capital such as years of schooling, enrollment rates, or literacy. In this paper, we show that the predictive power of years of education as a proxy for human capital started to dwindle in 1990 when the schooling of nations began to be homogenized. We developed a structural equation model that estimates a metric of human capital that is less sensitive than average years of education and remains as a significant predictor of economic growth when tested with both cross-section data and panel data."
https://openalex.org/W2925097842,"We used a retrospective cohort study to measure the impact of caring for children on female Australian researchers. Our aim was to see whether caring for children was associated with reduced outputs and collaboration. Women were randomly selected for inclusion if they published a first author paper in one of three Australian journals during 2007 to 2015, women who did not publish during this time were not included. One-hundred and sixty women were approached and 95 (59%) completed a survey on their history of caring for children. Two key outcomes were the women’s publication and citation counts, which were accessed from Scopus. We also examined the number of authors, affiliations and countries on their published papers, as a reduction in these numbers could indicate an impaired ability to collaborate. We examined the probability of being first or last author as a measure of esteem. There was a small increase in publication counts after the first child that was reversed after the second child. Average citations counts declined after children, particularly after the second child. There was some evidence of a reduced collaboration with overseas collaborators after the first child. The probability of being the last author increased after the second child. Three women were identified as statistically influential and all three had children and were in the top 10% of overall publications and citations. After removing these women the estimated changes in outcomes were noticeably different for most of the outcomes. The repeated presence of statistically influential women shows that it may be impossible to find an “average impact” of caring for children when considering research output. Adjustments may need to be made individually, with women explaining how caring for children has altered their career."
https://openalex.org/W2949918167,"Applications of quantitative network analysis to functional brain connectivity have become popular in the last decade due to their ability to describe the general topological principles of brain networks. However, many issues arise when standard statistical analysis techniques are applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) connectivity maps. Frequently, summary measures of these maps, such as global efficiency and clustering coefficients, collapse the changing structures of graph topology from many scales to one. This can result in a loss of whole-brain spatio-temporal pattern information that may be significant in association and prediction analyses. Drawing from the electrical engineering field, the resistance perturbation distance is a quantification of similarity between graphs on the same vertex set that has been shown to identify changes in dynamic graphs, such as those from fMRI, while not being computationally expensive or result in a loss of information. This work proposes a novel kernel-based regression scheme that incorporates the resistance perturbation distance to better understand the association with biological phenotypes from fMRI using both simulated and real datasets."

Clinicians lack a clinical tool to identify impairments in stair negotiation and to assist their decision making regarding treatment plans to improve stair performance and safety. We developed a new tool called the Step Test Evaluation of Performance on Stairs (STEPS) that is designed to assess stair performance and safety in neurological populations.This study aimed to determine interrater and intrarater reliability of STEPS and its concurrent content validity to various clinical balance and mobility measures using individuals with Huntington's disease (HD) as the first test population.Forty individuals with HD (mean age 50.35) participated. Three observers rated live performances of the STEPS (interrater reliability) and seven observers rated videotaped performances twice (intrarater reliability). STEPS scores correlated with clinical mobility and balance test scores.Excellent inter- and intrarater reliability (ICCs = 0.91 and 0.89 respectively) and good internal consistency (α = 0.83) were found. Better STEPS performance correlated with better performance on co-administered motor and mobility measures and Stair Self-Efficacy scores. Per multivariable regression analysis, the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale modified motor score and descent time were significant predictors of STEPS performance.The STEPS tool is easy to administer, requires no special devices and can be completed in less than five minutes. In the HD test population, it shows high reliability and validity making it a potentially useful tool for assessing maneuverability and safety on stairs in HD. The results suggest that the STEPS tool warrants further study to determine STEPS cut-off values for fall prediction in HD and may prove useful as an assessment tool for other neurological disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2924827356,"The forces that arise from the actin cortex play a crucial role in determining the membrane deformation. These include protrusive forces due to actin polymerization, pulling forces due to transient attachment of actin filaments to the membrane, retrograde flow powered by contraction of actomyosin network, and adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Here we present a theoretical model for membrane deformation resulting from the feedback between the membrane shape and the forces acting on the membrane. We model the membrane as a series of beads connected by springs and determine the final steady-state shape of the membrane arising from the interplay between pushing/pulling forces of the actin network and the resisting membrane tension. We specifically investigate the effect of the gel dynamics on the spatio-temporal deformation of the membrane until a stable lamellipodium is formed. We show that the retrograde flow and the cross-linking velocity play an essential role in the final elongation of the membrane. Interestingly, in the simulations where motor-induced contractility is switched off, reduced retrograde flow results in an increase in the rate and amplitude of membrane protrusion. These simulations are consistent with experimental observations that report an enhancement in protrusion efficiency as myosin II molecular motors are inhibited."

The nurses and midwives being the first point of contact play a central role in addressing these problems. This study was conducted to assess the knowledge and utilization of the technologies (misoprostol, anti-shock garment and magnesium sulphate) in the reduction of maternal mortality amongst the Primary Health Care (PHC) nurses and midwives in Lagos State, Nigeria. In addition, the availability of the technologies in the flagship Primary Health Centres (PHCs) was assessed.This was a cross-sectional study among all the nurses and midwives at the flagship PHCs in Lagos state and a total of 230 were eventually studied. Data was collected using a self-administered, structured questionnaire and a checklist. Descriptive and inferential statistics were applied. Level of significance was set at 5% (p<0.05).All the respondents were aware of the technologies but most (73.9%) had poor knowledge of them. Majority (74.8%) of the respondents had good knowledge of maternal mortality and its major causes. Most, 81.3% of the respondents have administered misoprostol, 37.0% magnesium sulphate while 52.2% have administered anti shock garment. Out of the 57 flagship PHCs, 27 (47.4%) had magnesium sulphate, 42 (73.7%) had misoprostol and 52 (91.2%) had anti-shock garments in their facilities. Respondents who were double qualified (nurse/midwife) had significantly better knowledge of maternal mortality and its major causes (p = 0.009) than the other cadres. Longer years of experience (p = 0.019), training in the use of misoprostol (p = 0.020) and training in the use of magnesium sulphate (p = 0.001) significantly improved knowledge of the technologies.Respondents had good knowledge of maternal mortality and its major causes and poor knowledge of the technologies for maternal mortality reduction, despite the trainings attended. Of the three technologies considered, misoprostol was the most commonly used. Periodic refresher courses for the training and retraining of PHC nurses and midwives on the technologies for maternal mortality reduction is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2924778608,"Prevalence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the US increased by 74% from 2000 to 2013. To investigate the role of the broader environment on ESRD survival time, we evaluated average distance to the nearest hospital by county (as a surrogate for access to healthcare) and the Environmental Quality Index (EQI), an aggregate measure of ambient environmental quality composed of five domains (air, water, land, built, and sociodemographic), at the county level across the US. Associations between average hospital distance, EQI, and survival time for 1,092,281 people diagnosed with ESRD between 2000 and 2013 (age 18+, without changes in county residence) from the US Renal Data System were evaluated using proportional-hazards models adjusting for gender, race, age at first ESRD service date, BMI, alcohol and tobacco use, and rurality. The models compared the average distance to the nearest hospital (<10, 10-20, >20 miles) and overall EQI percentiles [0-5), [5-20), [20-40), [40-60), [60-80), [80-95), and [95-100], where lower percentiles are interpreted as better EQI. In the full, non-stratified model with both distance and EQI, there was increased survival for patients over 20 miles from a hospital compared to those under 10 miles from a hospital (hazard ratio = 1.14, 95% confidence interval = 1.12-1.15) and no consistent direction of association across EQI strata. In the full model stratified by average hospital distance, under 10 miles from a hospital had increased survival in the worst EQI strata (median survival 3.0 vs. 3.5 years for best vs. worst EQI, respectively), however for people over 20 miles from a hospital, median survival was higher in the best (4.2 years) vs worst (3.4 years) EQI. This association held across different rural/urban categories and age groups. These results demonstrate the importance of considering multiple factors when studying ESRD survival and future efforts should consider additional components of the broader environment."
https://openalex.org/W2923309490,"Action errors can put older adults at risk of injury. Our study is the first to investigate whether older adults are more prone than younger adults to making 'ironic' motor errors (i.e., actions they have been instructed not to perform), or over-compensatory motor errors (e.g., moving more to the right when instructed not to move to the left). We also investigated whether error patterns change under cognitive load, and assessed whether age effects in the ability to inhibit a prohibited action are comparable to the age decrements found in the ability to inhibit a natural perception-action coupling in the Simon task. Sixty-four older (Mean = 70.64 years, SD = 5.81) and 39 younger (Mean = 28.74 years, SD = 16.39) adults completed an avoidant instruction line-drawing task (with and without cognitive load), and the Simon task. Older adults showed significantly slower inhibition times than younger adults on the Simon task, as expected, and in line with previous research. Surprisingly, however, older adults outperformed younger adults on the avoidant instruction task, producing fewer ironic and over-compensatory errors, and they performed similarly to the younger adults under cognitive load. Age-related decrements on the Simon but not the avoidant instruction task suggests that the two different types of motor tasks involve different subtypes of inhibition which likely recruit independent cognitive processes and neural circuitry in older age. It is speculated that the older adults' superior ability to inhibit a prohibited action could be the result of age-related changes in distractibility."
https://openalex.org/W2952412892,"Multiscale signal processing techniques such as wavelet filtering have proved to be particularly successful in predicting exon sequences. Traditional wavelet predictor is domain filtering, and enforces exon features by weighting nucleotide values with coefficients. Such a measure performs linear filtering and is not suitable for preserving the short coding exons and the exon-intron boundaries. This paper describes a prediction framework that is capable of non-linearly processing DNA sequences while achieving high prediction rates. There are two key contributions. The first is the introduction of a genomic-inspired multiscale bilateral filtering (MSBF) which exploits both weighting coefficients in the spatial domain and nucleotide similarity in the range. Similarly to wavelet transform, the MSBF is also defined as a weighted sum of nucleotides. The difference is that the MSBF takes into account the variation of nucleotides at a specific codon position. The second contribution is the exploitation of inter-scale correlation in MSBF domain to find the inter-scale dependency on the differences between the exon signal and the background noise. This favourite property is used to sharp the important structures while weakening noise. Three benchmark data sets have been used in the evaluation of considered methods. By comparison with four existing techniques, the prediction results demonstrate that: the proposed method reveals at least improvement of 4.1%, 50.5%, 25.6%, 2.5%, 10.8%, 15.5%, 11.1%, 12.3%, 9.2% and 2.4% on the exons length of 1-24, 25-49, 50-74, 75-99, 100-124, 125-149, 150-174, 175-199, 200-299 and 300-300+, respectively. The MSBF of its nonlinear nature is good at energy compaction, which makes it capable of locating the sharp variations around short exons. The direct scale multiplication of coefficients at several adjacent scales obviously enhanced exon features while the noise contents were suppressed. We show that the non-linear nature and correlation-based property achieved in proposed predictor is greater than that for traditional filtering, which leads to better exon prediction performance. There are some possible applications of this predictor. Its good localization and protection of sharp variations will make the predictor be suitable to perform fault diagnosis of aero-engine."
https://openalex.org/W2924102549,"Recent research has suggested that visual discrimination and detection may be enhanced during movement preparation and execution, respectively. The current study examined if visual perceptual processing is augmented prior to or during a movement through the use of an Inspection Time (IT) task. The IT task involved briefly presenting (e.g., 15-105 ms) a ""pi"" figure with differing leg lengths, which was then immediately masked for 400 ms to prevent retinal afterimages. Participants were subsequently required to choose which of the two legs was longer. In Experiment 1, participants (n = 28) completed the IT task under three movement conditions: no-movement (NM), foreperiod (FP), and peak velocity (PV). In the NM condition, participants solely engaged in the IT paradigm. In the FP condition, the IT stimulus was presented prior to movement execution when response planning was expected to occur. Finally, in the PV condition, participants made a rapid movement to a target, and the IT stimulus was presented when their limb reached peak velocity. In Experiment 2, participants (n = 18) also performed the IT task in the PV and NM condition; however, vision of the limb's motion was made available during the PV trials (PV-FV) to investigate the potential influence of visual feedback on IT performance. Results showed no significant differences in performance in the IT task between the NM and FP conditions, suggesting no enhancement of visual processing occurred due to response preparation (Experiment 1). However, IT performance was significantly poorer in the PV condition in comparison to both the NM and FP conditions (Experiment 1), and was even worse when visual feedback was provided (Experiment 2). Together, these findings suggest that visual perceptual processing is degraded during execution of a fast, goal-directed movement."
