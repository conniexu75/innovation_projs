https://openalex.org/W2127316404,"The purification and characterization of a replication-dependent chromatin assembly factor (CAF-I) from the nuclei of human cells is described. CAF-I is a multisubunit protein that, when added to a crude cytosol replication extract, promotes chromatin assembly on replicating SV40 DNA. Chromatin assembly by CAF-I requires and is coupled with DNA replication. The minichromosomes assembled de novo by CAF-I consist of correctly spaced nucleosomes containing the four core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, which are supplied in a soluble form by the cytosol replication extract. Thus, by several criteria, the CAF-I-dependent chromatin assembly reaction described herein reflects the process of chromatin formation during DNA replication in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2055948417,"A hyper-recombination mutation was isolated that causes an increase in recombination between short repeated delta sequences surrounding the SUP4-omicron gene in S. cerevisiae. The wild-type copy of this gene was cloned by complementation of one of its pleiotropic phenotypes, slow growth. DNA sequence of the clone revealed a 656 amino acid open reading frame capable of encoding a protein homologous to the bacterial type I topoisomerase. No homology was detected with previously identified eukaryotic topoisomerases. Construction of double mutants with either of the two known yeast topoisomerase genes revealed synergistic effects on growth suggesting overlapping functions. Expression of bacterial topoisomerase I in yeast can fully complement the slow growth defect of a null mutation. We have named this locus TOP3 and suggest that it defines a novel eukaryotic topoisomerase gene."
https://openalex.org/W2076497575,"Transfection of cDNA expression vectors encoding either MyoD1 or myogenin into 10T1/2 cells converts them to myogenic cells. We show that transfection of 10T1/2 cells with the MyoD1 cDNA activates expression of endogenous MyoD1 mRNA, indicating that MyoD1 is subject to positive autoregulation. This activation of endogenous MyoD1 mRNA was also observed in Swiss 3T6 cells, but not in several other fibroblast or adipoblast cell lines transfected with the MyoD1 cDNA. In addition, transfection of the MyoD1 cDNA leads to activation of myogenin expression, and transfection of the myogenin cDNA leads to activation of MyoD1 expression. Thus, MyoD1 and myogenin appear to function in a positive autoregulatory loop that could either: account for or contribute to the stability of myogenic commitment; or amplify the level of expression of both MyoD1 and myogenin above a critical threshold that is required for activation of the myogenic program."
https://openalex.org/W2050719029,"A 47-kilodalton neutrophil cytosol factor (NCF-47k), required for activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase superoxide (O2-.) production, is absent in most patients with autosomal recessive chronic granulomatous disease (AR-CGD). NCF-47k cDNAs were cloned from an expression library. The largest clone predicted a 41.9-kD protein that contained an arginine and serine-rich COOH-terminal domain with potential protein kinase C phosphorylation sites. A 33-amino acid segment of NCF-47k shared 49% identity with ras p21 guanosine triphosphatase activating protein. Recombinant NCF-47k restored O2-. -producing activity to AR-CGD neutrophil cytosol in a cell-free assay. Production of active recombinant NCF-47k will enable functional regions of this molecule to be mapped."
https://openalex.org/W1595007859,"Damage to the bases in DNA produced by the hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase system in the presence of iron ions was studied. The base products in DNA were measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with selected ion monitoring after acidic hydrolysis of DNA and trimethylsilylation. Products identified were cytosine glycol, thymine glycol, 5,6-dihydroxycytosine, 4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine, 8-hydroxyadenine, 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine, and 8-hydroxyguanine. These are typical hydroxyl radical-induced products of the bases in DNA. 2,6-Diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine was the major product, followed by 8-hydroxyguanine, in DNA treated with hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase/Fe3+-EDTA. The use of Fe3+ did not cause as much damage to the bases in DNA as did the use of Fe3+-EDTA. In both systems, the formation of the products was inhibited by superoxide dismutase, catalase, dimethyl sulfoxide, mannitol, and desferrioxamine, but inhibitions were much stronger in the systems containing EDTA. Hence formation of hydroxyl radicals by a superoxide radical-assisted Fenton reaction is proposed to account for the results obtained. 2,6-Diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine, 5,6-dihydroxycytosine, 4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine, and 8-hydroxyguanine were proposed as the products in DNA to measure if one aims to measure DNA products as indices of oxidative DNA damage involving hydroxyl radicals in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1981922425,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) oriP contains two components, a dyad symmetry element and a direct repeat element, that, in the presence of EBV nuclear antigen 1, are necessary and sufficient for plasmid replication. We have examined the replicative forms generated by EBV oriP using 2D gel electrophoresis. The patterns obtained from an oriP plasmid in a transfected cell line indicate that the site of initiation of DNA replication is at or very near the dyad symmetry element, while the direct repeats contain a replication fork barrier and the termination site. Thus, replication from oriP proceeds in a predominantly undirectional manner. The patterns obtained from cells immortalized by EBV suggest that replication from oriP proceeds similarly in the viral genome."
https://openalex.org/W1564186686,"We have recently described a monoclonal antibody (1F8) that recognizes a form of glucose transporter unique to fat and muscle (James, D. E., Brown, R., Navarro, J., and Pilch, P. F. (1988) Nature 333, 183–185), tissues that respond acutely to insulin by markedly increasing their glucose uptake. Here, we report that rat adipocytes possess two immunologically distinct glucose-transporters: one recognized by 1F8, and one reactive with antibodies raised against the human erythrocyte glucose transporter. Immunoadsorption experiments indicate that these glucose transporters reside in different vesicle populations and that both transporter isoforms translocate from intracellular sites to the plasma membrane in response to insulin. The insulin-regulatable transporter resides in a unique vesicle that comprises 3% or less of the low density microsomes of fat cells and has a limited protein composition that does not include the bulk of another translocatable protein, the insulin-like growth factor II receptor. Immunoprecipitation with 1F8 of microsomal glucose transporters photoaffinity labeled with [3H]cytochalasin B brings down 90% of the label. Similarly, immunoprecipitation with 1F8 of glucose transporters from insulin-stimulated plasma membranes photolabeled with 3-[125I]iodo-4-azidophenethylam-ido-7-O-succinyldeacetyl-forskolin, another transporter-selective reagent, results in 75% of the labeled transporter localized in the immunoprecipitate. Thus, insulin action involves the combined effect of translocation from at least two vesicle pools each containing different glucose transporters. The 1F8-reactive transporter comprises the majority of the total transporter pool that is responsible for the insulin-induced increase in glucose transporter number."
https://openalex.org/W1981004390,"The association between the retinoblastoma protein (p105-RB) and either the large T antigen of SV40 or the E1A proteins of adenovirus is thought to be an important step in transformation by these viral oncogenes. E1A and large T antigen share a small region of amino acid homology that is necessary for high affinity binding with p105-RB. Mutations of this homology region were shown to reduce drastically the frequency of transformation mediated by the E1A or large T oncogenes. Previously, this small region in E1A was shown to be sufficient for interaction with a second cellular protein of 107,000 daltons (107K). Here we show that in human cells, the large T antigens of SV40 or JC virus also form complexes with 107K. Demonstration of complexes between 107K and the large T antigens of SV40 and JC virus suggests that these associations may represent another component of a common mechanism for transformation between adenoviruses and polyoma viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2095816327,"Linear retroviral DNA, the major precursor to the integrated provirus of the murine leukemia viruses, contains a mixture of two structures at its ends: some termini are full-length and blunt, and some have recessed 3' strands. A temporal study of the end structures showed that the proportion of the DNA with recessed ends increases during the course of infection, and suggests that the blunt ends are precursors to the recessed ends. We have examined the DNA structures of the ends of retroviral mutants defective in the integration (IN) function. The results show that the formation of the recessed ends requires the presence of IN. Finally, we have analyzed the structures at the ends of mutant genomes with alterations in the terminal DNA sequence. The exact position of the recessed 3' end can be recessed one, two, or four nucleotides relative to the 5' end. In all cases the position of the recessed 3' end correlates perfectly with, and thus presumably determines, the site of joining to the target DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1585635925,"Abstract In both NIH3T3 cells and HepG2 cells, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptors possess two beta-subunits that display different electrophoretic mobilities. Increasing concentrations of IGF-I stimulated the phosphorylation of both beta-subunits to a similar extent, whereas insulin stimulated the phosphorylation of both subunits only at elevated concentrations. Both beta-subunits were immunoprecipitated with p5, an insulin receptor-specific anti-peptide antibody, or with A410, a polyclonal anti-insulin receptor antisera. However, if the tetrameric IGF-I receptor was first dissociated into alpha-beta heterodimers with 1 mM dithiothreitol, only the lower molecular weight beta-subunit was immunoprecipitated. These results suggested that p5 and A410 specifically recognized the lower molecular weight beta-subunit but immunoprecipitated the higher molecular weight beta-subunit because it was present in the same disulfide linked tetramer. Similarly, alpha-IR-3, an antibody specific for the alpha-subunit of the IGF-I receptor, immunoprecipitated both types of beta-subunit from the intact tetramer but only the higher molecular weight beta-subunit from the dissociated heterodimers, suggesting that there are two types of alpha-subunits in the same tetramer and that the alpha-subunit recognized by alpha-IR-3 is only associated with the higher molecular weight beta-subunit. Tryptic phosphopeptide maps of the lower molecular weight beta-subunit of IGF-I receptor were different from the higher molecular weight beta-subunit, but were similar to those of the insulin receptor beta-subunit. Thus, by immunochemical cross-reactivity and structural criteria, the lower molecular weight beta-subunit of the IGF-I receptor was similar to the beta-subunit of insulin receptor. These data suggest that there exists a species of IGF-I receptor that is a hybrid composed of an insulin receptor alpha-beta heterodimer and an IGF-I receptor alpha-beta heterodimer. The existence of such a hybrid receptor could have important functional consequences."
https://openalex.org/W2009512836,"The signaling pathways by which β-adrenergic agonists modulate voltage-dependent cardiac sodium currents are unknown, although it is likely that adenosine 3′5′-monophosphate (cAMP) is involved. Single-channel and whole-cell sodium currents were measured in cardiac myocytes and the signal transducing G protein Gs was found to couple β-adrenergic receptors to sodium channels by both cytoplasmic (indirect) and membrane-delimited (direct) pathways. Hence, Gs can act on at least three effectors in the heart: sodium channels, calcium channels, and adenylyl cyclase. The effect on sodium currents was inhibitory and was enhanced by membrane depolarization. During myocardial ischemia the sodium currents of depolarized cells may be further inhibited by the accompanying increase in catecholamine levels."
https://openalex.org/W1596708629,"Abstract Measurement of fura-2 fluorescence and 45Ca2+ uptake was used to evaluate Ca2+ influx in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) stimulated by bradykinin (BK). The BK-stimulated influx pathway was characterized with respect to its 1) sensitivity to extracellular Ca2+, 2) inhibition by membrane depolarization, and 3) permeability to Ba2+ and Sr2+. The results indicate that the activity of the influx pathway is a saturable function of extracellular Ca2+ and that membrane depolarization inhibits Ca2+ influx by changing the apparent affinity and maximal capacity of the pathway for Ca2+. Fura-2 fluorescence was used to compare the profiles for BK-stimulated changes in cytosolic Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+ (Ca2+i, Ba2+i, and Sr2+i). Addition of Ca2+ and Sr2+ to Ca2+-depleted cells in the presence of BK produced a transient increase in Ca2+i and Sr2+i. Following the peak of the response, Ca2+i and Sr2+i declined within 2 min to a steady elevated level. Blockade of influx by the addition of La3+ at the peak of the response to Ca2+ and Sr2+ immediately reduced Ca2+i and Sr2+i to basal levels. Addition of Ba2+ to Ca2+-depleted cells in the presence of BK produced an increase in Ba2+i which continued to rise with time to a steady level. Addition of La3+ after Ba2+, however, did not reduce Ba2+i. These results suggest that 1) Ca2+ and Sr2+ (but not Ba2+) are sequestered by intracellular mechanisms and that the declining phase of the Ca2+ and Sr2+ response reflects a time and divalent cation-dependent inactivation of the influx pathway. The inactivation of the influx pathway was further demonstrated by measuring the kinetics of BK-stimulated 45Ca2+ uptake into BAECs. The results of these experiments demonstrate that BK stimulates a 100- to 150-fold increase in Ca2+ permeability of the BAEC but that the influx pathway turns off or inactivates within 2 min. The magnitude of the flux, the voltage sensitivity, and the ability to conduct Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+ are suggestive of a channel mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2093002075,"Phage Mu transposition is initiated by the Mu DNA strand-transfer reaction, which generates a branched DNA structure that acts as a transposition intermediate. A critical step in this reaction is formation of a special synaptic DNA-protein complex called a plectosome. We find that formation of this complex involves, in addition to a pair of Mu end sequences, a third cis-acting sequence element, the internal activation sequence (IAS). The IAS is specifically recognized by the N-terminal domain of Mu transposase (MuA protein). Neither the N-terminal domain of MuA protein nor the IAS is required for later reaction steps. The IAS overlaps with the sequences to which Mu repressor protein binds in the Mu operator region; the Mu repressor directly inhibits the Mu DNA strand-transfer reaction by interfering with the interaction between MuA protein and the IAS, providing an additional mode of regulation by the repressor."

https://openalex.org/W1646353701,"Abstract Neuromodulin (p57, GAP-43, F1, B-50) is a major neural-specific, calmodulin binding protein found in brain, spinal cord, and retina that is associated with membranes. Phosphorylation of neuromodulin by protein kinase C causes a significant reduction in its affinity for calmodulin (Alexander, K. A., Cimler, B. M., Meirer, K. E., and Storm, D. R. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 6108-6113). It has been proposed that neuromodulin may function to bind and concentrate calmodulin at specific sites within neurons and that activation of protein kinase C causes the release of free calmodulin at high concentrations near its target proteins. It was the goal of this study to determine whether bovine brain contains a phosphoprotein phosphatase that will utilize phosphoneuromodulin as a substrate. Phosphatase activity for phosphoneuromodulin was partially purified from a bovine brain extract using DEAE-Sephacel and Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration chromatography. The neuromodulin phosphatase activity was resolved into two peaks by Affi-Gel Blue chromatography. One of these phosphatases, which represented approximately 60% of the total neuromodulin phosphatase activity, was tentatively identified as calcineurin by its requirement for Ca2+ and calmodulin (CaM) and inhibition of its activity by chlorpromazine. Therefore, bovine brain calcineurin was purified to homogeneity and examined for its phosphatase activity against bovine phosphoneuromodulin. Calcineurin rapidly dephosphorylated phosphoneuromodulin in the presence of micromolar Ca2+ and 3 microM CaM. The apparent Km and Vmax for the dephosphorylation of neuromodulin, measured in the presence of micromolar Ca2+ and 2 microM CaM, were 2.5 microM and 70 nmol Pi/mg/min, respectively, compared to a Km and Vmax of 4 microM and 55 nmol Pi/mg/min, respectively, for myosin light chain under the same conditions. Dephosphorylation of neuromodulin by calcineurin was stimulated 50-fold by calmodulin in the presence of micromolar free Ca2+. Half-maximal stimulation was observed at a calmodulin concentration of 0.5 microM. We propose that phosphoneuromodulin may be a physiologically important substrate for calcineurin and that calcineurin and protein kinase C may regulate the levels of free calmodulin available in neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1989224311,"The molecular basis for membrane association of pp60v-src, the transforming protein of Rous sarcoma virus, was investigated in a cell-free system. Newly synthesized pp60v-src polypeptide, produced by in vitro translation of src mRNA, rapidly bound to plasma membranes. Binding was saturable and dependent on the presence of myristate at the amino terminus of pp60v-src. Prior treatment of membranes with heat or trypsin greatly decreased subsequent binding of pp60v-src. Membrane binding of pp60v-src was competed by a myristylated peptide containing the first 11 amino acids of the mature src sequence, but not by non-myristylated src peptide or other myristylated peptides. The specificity, saturability, and competitive nature of pp60v-src binding provide evidence for the existence of a src receptor in the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1972500298,"Replication of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) depends upon the viral TAT protein. TAT stimulates gene expression via a target response sequence (TAR) located within the HIV-1 LTR. As TAR is located in the transcribed region it could act as a signal in either the DNA, the RNA, or both. To test whether TAT acts on transcription and/or posttranscriptionally, we produced TAT in yeast and monitored its activity after microinjection into the nucleus or cytoplasm of Xenopus oocytes. The TAT protein stimulated TAR-dependent expression, but this activation was not inhibited by transcriptional inhibitors. Furthermore, TAR-containing RNA, produced in vitro, was ""activated"" by TAT after coinjection into oocytes. This activation only occurred, however, when the RNA was injected into the nucleus and not into the cytoplasm. Our data indicate, therefore, that in the Xenopus system TAT acts on presynthesized RNA and that the nucleus is involved in this action."
https://openalex.org/W1488600025,"The induction of cyclic GMP formation in target tissues, i.e. vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells, by atrial natriuretic factor is followed by its egression into plasma and urine. Since the extracellular appearance of this cyclic nucleotide is used as a marker of atrial natriuretic factor's biological activity, the present study was designed to investigate the characteristics of its egression to the extracellular fluid. In contrast to cyclic AMP, whose profile of egression in time closely follows its intracellular levels, cyclic GMP egression begins with the intracellular decline but continues for a prolonged period, even accumulating for up to 24 h in the extracellular medium. The relative egression of cyclic GMP decreases slightly in the presence of phosphodiesterase inhibitors. On the other hand, the process is sensitive to temperature, inhibited by such agents as probenecid, and occurs against a gradient of 7 orders of magnitude. Large increases of cyclic AMP, as induced by forskolin, can effectively compete for the cyclic GMP transport system, resulting in a 3-fold rise in intracellular cyclic GMP levels, which corresponds to a 3-fold decline of extracellular accumulation. Although the biological significance of cyclic GMP egression is unknown, the results of this study suggest that the process may be one of the significant contributors to the control of cyclic GMP levels in the cell with potential physiological consequences."
https://openalex.org/W2038154593,"The pyrimidine analog 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR) competes with thymidine for incorporation into DNA. Substitution of BUdR for thymidine does not significantly affect cell viability but does block cell differentiation in many different lineages. BUdR substitution in a mouse myoblast line blocked myogenic differentiation and extinguished the expression of the myogenic determination gene MyoD1. Forced expression of MyoD1 from a transfected expression vector in a BUdR-substituted myoblast overcame the block to differentiation imposed by BUdR. Activation of BUdR-substituted muscle structural genes and apparently normal differentiation were observed in transfected myoblasts. This shows that BUdR blocks myogenesis at the level of a myogenic regulatory gene, possibly MyoD1, not by directly inhibiting the activation of muscle structural genes. It is consistent with the idea that BUdR selectively blocks a class of regulatory genes, each member of which is important for the development of a different cell lineage."
https://openalex.org/W1608853443,"Abstract Palmitylation of vesicular stomatitis virus G and Sindbis virus E1 glycoproteins has been studied in relation to the transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi complex. Incubation of infected cells at 15 degrees C prevents the transport of newly synthesized membrane proteins from the ER to the Golgi (Saraste, J., and Kuismanen, E. (1984) Cell 38, 535-549). In these conditions, also palmitylation of G protein and of E1 glycoprotein is blocked. When the transport is restored by increasing the temperature, palmitylation occurs quickly and is followed by the complete trimming of peripheral mannose residues due to mannosidase I (a putative cis-Golgi function). Immunofluorescence analysis showed that the G glycoprotein accumulated at 15 degrees C in structures distinct from both ER and Golgi. These studies suggest that transport from the ER to the cis-Golgi involves intermediate compartments."
https://openalex.org/W1501642560,"Abstract Antibodies to a rat liver membrane glycoprotein with an Mr of 115,000 (nonreduced) inhibited the attachment of rat hepatocytes and primary rat heart fibroblasts to both collagen and fibronectin. The Mr 115,000 glycoprotein cross-reacted immunologically with the beta 1-chain of the rat hepatocyte fibronectin receptor (HFNR), and the two proteins showed identical peptide maps after proteolytic cleavage. It was concluded that the Mr 115,000 protein was similar or identical to the beta 1-chain of Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-directed matrix receptors. Although collagen type I contains several RGD sequences, the attachment of hepatocytes and fibroblasts to collagen type I was not inhibited by the synthetic peptide GRGDTP in concentrations that blocked adhesion to fibronectin. Furthermore, hepatocytes adhered equally well to collagen fragments, generated by cyanogen bromide cleavage, lacking RGD sequences as to fragments containing this sequence. Antibodies to the Mr 115,000 protein inhibited the adhesion of hepatocytes to both types of collagen fragments. Taken together, these data indicate the presence of collagen receptors that share the beta-subunit with the HFNR but that are not directed to RGD sequences. Tentative alpha-chains of the collagen matrix receptor complex were isolated by immunoprecipitation of surface 125I-labeled fibroblast membrane proteins purified by affinity chromatography on immobilized collagen type I. Data are presented indicating that proteins with Mr around 145,000 and 170,000 (nonreduced) are associated in noncovalently linked complexes with the Mr 115,000 protein. These complexes have affinity for collagen and thus have properties expected for integrin-like collagen receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1565973710,"The preparation of clearly delineated plasmalemma (PM) and endosomal subcellular fractions from rat liver has allowed us to compare insulin receptor (IR) kinase activity at the cell surface and in hepatic endosomes (ENs) as a function of dose and time after injected insulin. Tyrosine kinase activity in PM and ENs was measured, after solubilization and partial purification by wheat germ agglutinin chromatography (lectin-purified), using poly(Glu: Tyr) as substrate. Following the injection of a subsaturating dose of insulin (1.5 e/100 g body weight), lectin-purified receptor showed peak activation at 30 s in PM and at 2 min in ENs. As observed previously (Khan, M. N., Savoie, S., Bergeron, J. J. M., and Posner, B. I. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 8462-8472) autophosphorylation activity was also augmented following insulin injection. In a pattern virtually identical to that of exogenous kinase activity, autophosphorylation attained peak activity at 30 s in PM and at 2 min in ENs. The time course of IR autophosphorylation in intact membranes was very similar to that observed for lectin purified receptors and was seen with an injected insulin dose as low as 150 ng/100 g body weight. Phosphatase treatment of the solubilized endosomal receptor abolished its enhanced activity. Hence, insulin treatment led to in vivo receptor phosphorylation which was reflected in the enhancement of both tyrosine kinase and autophosphorylation activities. Significant differences in the phosphorylation activities of PM and ENs were observed. Phosphoamino acid analyses revealed that the activated IR of intact PM was autophosphorylated in vitro, at both serine (55%) and tyrosine (45%) residues; whereas the activated IR of intact ENs was phosphorylated in vitro exclusively on tyrosine autophosphorylation specific activity for the activated IR of ENs was 3- to 4-fold that of the IR of PM. This was observed for the lectin purified IRs as well as for IRs of intact cell fractions. The reduced level of IR autophosphorylation in PM was not due to occlusion of tyrosine acceptor sites by prior in vivo phosphorylation. The rapidity with which activated IR accumulates in ENs as well as the sensitivity of endosomal IR kinase to activation by injected insulin are consistent with the endosomal apparatus serving a physiologically significant site for the regulation of transmembrane signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1655647265,"Abstract Extracellular ATP and other purinergic agonists were found to inhibit cAMP accumulation by depressing adenylate cyclase as an and/or to stimulate arachidonate release in association with phospholipase C or A2 activation and Ca2+ mobilization as in FRTL-5 cells. The stimulatory actions of a group of P2-agonists represented by ATP were partially inhibited by the pretreatment of the cells with islet-activating protein (IAP), pertussis toxin, even when an about 41-kDa membrane protein(s) was completely ADP-ribosylated. Only the IAP-sensitive part of the stimulatory actions was antagonized by 1,3-diethyl-8-phenylxanthine (DPX), an adenosine antagonist. GTP and 8-bromoadenosine 5'-triphosphate (Br-ATP) at two to three orders of higher concentrations than ATP also exerted the stimulatory actions, although they were entirely insensitive to both IAP and DPX. Ligand binding experiments with, [35S]ATP gamma S and [3H]DPX showed that ATP occupies both DPX-sensitive and insensitive receptor sites, whereas GTP does only ATP-displaceable DPX-insensitive sites. Thus, lack of sensitivity of GTP action to DPX was associated with its inability to occupy the DPX-sensitive sites. Adenosine 5'-O-(1-thiotriphosphate) (ATP alpha S), adenosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (ADP beta S) and P1-agonists such as AMP and N6-(L-2-phenylisopropyl-adenosine (PIA) did not show any stimulatory action. Nevertheless, the agonists remarkably enhanced the stimulatory actions of GTP or Br-ATP. Such permissive actions of PIA and others were sensitive to both IAP and DPX, as were shown for a part of the stimulatory actions of ATP as well as the of both PIA and ATP. We conclude that an IAP substrate G-protein(s) which mediates the inhibitory action of purinergic agonists via a DPX-sensitive purinergic receptor(s) may not directly link to the phospholipase C or A2 system but enhance the system which links to a DPX-insensitive P2-receptor, in an indirect or permissive manner."
https://openalex.org/W1523561547,"DNA topoisomerase I from the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe was overproduced using the cloned genes. Extracts from cells overproducing DNA topoisomerase I were prepared and incubated with 32P-labeled DNA. Alkali was used to trap the topoisomerase I-DNA covalent intermediate. Most of the DNA was digested with nuclease, and the resultant 32P-labeled topoisomerase I was subjected to cleavage with cyanogen bromide or formic acid. From the molecular weights of the resultant labeled peptides and by comparison of the amino acid sequences derived from the cloned genes, we were able to deduce that the active site tyrosine of eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I is very near the carboxyl terminus, at amino acid 771 for S. pombe and 727 for S. cerevisiae. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to change tyrosine 727 of S. cerevisiae topoisomerase I to a phenylalanine. The resulting mutant topoisomerase I protein lost all DNA relaxation activity and rendered cells resistant to the topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin. The amino acid sequence of human topoisomerase I has significant similarity to the two yeast topoisomerase I sequences. Based on this similarity, we infer that tyrosine 723 is the active site tyrosine of human enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2081267992,"We have shown previously that genes activated by the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) enhancer or promoter in mouse myeloma cells are extinguished upon fusion of the myeloma with a mouse T cell lymphoma. Here we show that the conserved octamer sequence shared by the IgH enhancer and promoter, when multimerized to form a tissue-specific enhancer, can also render a gene extinguishable under the same experimental conditions. Extinction, however, is not correlated with either absence of the tissue-specific transcription factor OTF-2 or loss of its ability to bind the octamer sequence. It was also found that extinction mediated by the IgH enhancer is dominant to transcriptional activation by the SV40 enhancer. We propose, therefore, that the T cell-negative regulator responsible for IgH gene extinction does not simply prevent IgH enhancer activation but interferes with gene expression more directly, perhaps by disrupting the transcription complex established as a result of tissue-specific enhancer activation."
https://openalex.org/W1480256271,"The mouse wild type and four mutant regulatory type I (RI) subunits were expressed in Escherichia coli and subjected to kinetic analyses. The defective RI subunits had point mutations in either cAMP-binding site A (G200/E), site B (G324/D, R332/H), or in both binding sites. In addition, a truncated form of RI which lacked the entire cAMP-binding site B was generated. All of the mutant RI subunits which bound [3H]cAMP demonstrated more rapid rates of cAMP dissociation compared to the wild type RI subunit. Dissociation profiles showed only a single dissociation component, suggesting that a single nonmutated binding site was functional. The mutant RI subunits associated with purified native catalytic subunit to form chromatographically separable holoenzyme complexes in which catalytic activity was suppressed. Each of these holoenzymes could be activated but showed varying degrees of cAMP responsiveness with apparent Ka values ranging from 40 nM to greater than 5 microM. The extent to which the mutated cAMP-binding sites were defective was also shown by the resistance of the respective holoenzymes to activation by cAMP analogs selective for the mutated binding sites. Kinetic results support the conclusions that 1) Gly-200 of cAMP-binding site A and Gly-324 or Arg-332 of site B are essential to normal conformation and function, 2) activation of type I cAMP-dependent protein kinase requires that only one of the cAMP-binding sites be functional, 3) mutational inactivation of site B (slow exchange) has a much more drastic effect than that of site A on increasing the Ka of the holoenzyme for cAMP, as well as in altering the rate of cAMP dissociation from the remaining site of the free RI subunit.

Basal, insulin-stimulated, and IGF I-stimulated receptor phosphorylation and tyrosine kinase activity are severalfold higher in partially purified receptor preparations from fetal muscle in comparison with equal numbers of receptors from adult muscle. There are distinct insulin and IGF I receptors with Mr 95,000 beta subunits in adult muscle, as evidenced by hormone dose-response curves, immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies, binding to insulin and IGF I affinity columns, and analysis of tryptic phosphopeptides. In addition to these two receptor species, fetal muscle contains a receptor with a Mr 105,000 beta subunit. The fetal receptor is structurally more closely related to the IGF-I receptor than the insulin receptor on the basis of its precipitation with specific antibodies, binding to an IGF I affinity column, and tryptic phosphopeptide map. The fetal receptor does not appear to bind insulin but, unlike the IGF-I receptor, its phosphorylation is stimulated by low physiological concentrations of both insulin and IGF I. This could be explained by the cross-phosphorylation of fetal receptors by activated insulin receptors. Expression of the fetal receptor is highest in the fetus and decreases markedly during the first 2 weeks of postnatal life. The fetal receptor appears to account for the high tyrosine kinase activity of fetal muscle and may be an important mediator of responses to both insulin and IGF I early in development."
https://openalex.org/W1525040827,"Abstract Using the spin trap, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-1-oxide (DMPO) and an excess of dimethyl sulfoxide, we previously reported that in the absence of an exogenous iron catalyst, human neutrophils will not generate hydroxyl radical, manifested as the catalse-inhibitable methyl radical spin-trapped adduct, 2,2,5-trimethyl-1-pyrrolidinyloxy (DMPO-CH3) (Britigan, B. E., Rosen, G. M., Chai, Y., and Cohen, M. S. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 4426-4431). However, superoxide destroys the preformed hydroxyl radical spin-trapped adduct, 2,2-dimethyl-5-hydroxy-1-pyrrolidinyloxy (DMPO-OH), and DMPO-CH3. The present study was undertaken to better resolve the limits of sensitivity of the spin-trapping method. Photolytically generated DMPO-CH3 and DMPO-OH slowly decomposed in the presence of a low flux (1 microM/min) of enzymatically (xanthine/xanthine oxidase)-generated superoxide, but more rapid decomposition of these adducts occurred with higher superoxide flux (5 microM/min). Inclusion of cysteine markedly increased the rate of DMPO-OH and DMPO-CH3 decomposition, masking the effect of superoxide alone. The addition of varying concentrations of superoxide dismutase did not lead to increased formation of DMPO-OH or DMPO-CH3, as should have occurred if these adducts were being destroyed by superoxide. As a positive control, we employed an iron-supplemented system with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated neutrophils or xanthine/xanthine oxidase to generate DMPO-CH3. Addition of superoxide dismutase increased the magnitude of DMPO-CH3, primarily by increasing the rate of hydrogen peroxide formation, and to a lesser extent by prolonging the half-life of DMPO-CH3. Although spin-trapped adducts can be destroyed by a high concentration of superoxide, or by lower concentrations of superoxide in the presence of thiol-containing compounds, our results demonstrate that such decomposition does not interfere with the ability of the spin-trapping method to detect hydroxyl radical generated by human neutrophils. These data do not support the capacity of neutrophils to generate hydroxyl radical in the absence of an exogenous Haber-Weiss catalyst."

Here we report the sequence of this gene and the identification of CrtI as a membrane protein of approximate Mr 60,000. Mutant strains with 5-fold lower or 10-fold higher levels of CrtI with respect to wild type have only small differences in their carotenoid content, indicating that the cellular concentration of CrtI is not a limiting factor in carotenoid biosynthesis. However, a correlation was found between the levels of CrtI and the formation of a photosynthetic antenna system."

https://openalex.org/W1563738514,"Leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis at the replication fork of bacteriophage T7 DNA requires the helicase and primase activities of the gene 4 protein. Gene 4 protein consists of two colinear polypeptides of 56- and 63-kDa molecular mass. We have demonstrated previously that the 56-kDa protein possesses helicase but lacks primase activity (Bernstein, J. A., and Richardson, C. C. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 85, 396–400). The 63-kDa gene 4 protein has now been purified from extracts of T7-infected cells. The preparation contains 5–10% contaminating 56-kDa protein, as shown by Western analysis using polyclonal antibodies to the purified 56-kDa protein. The 63-kDa protein catalyzes DNA-dependent dTTP hydrolysis and has helicase activity; both specific activities are similar to those determined for the 56-kDa protein. The 63-kDa protein efficiently synthesizes sequence-specific di-, tri-, and tetraribonucleotides and stimulates the elongation of tetraribonucleotides by T7 DNA polymerase. Although the 56-kDa protein alone lacks primase activity, it enhances the primase activity of the 63-kDa protein 4-fold. This stimulation can be accounted for by a similar increase in the amount of primers synthesized by the 63-kDa protein in the presence of the 56-kDa protein."
https://openalex.org/W1578044243,"Abstract A neutral sphingomyelinase which cleaves phosphorylcholine from sphingomyelin at a pH optima of 7.4 was purified 440-fold to apparent homogeneity from normal human urine concentrate employing Sephadex G-75 column chromatography, preparative isoelectric focusing, and sphingosylphospholcholine CH-Sepharose column chromatography. The enzyme is composed of a single polypeptide whose apparent molecular weight is 92,000. Analytical isoelectric focusing revealed that the pI of this enzyme is 6.5. Purified neutral sphingomyelinase was devoid of beta-galactosidase and beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity originally present in the urine concentrate. The purified neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) had low levels of phospholipase A1 and A2 activity when phosphatidylcholine was used as a substrate and detergents were included in the assay mixture. However, it had no phospholipase activity toward phosphatidylglycerol and sphingomyelin at pH 4.5 irrespective of the presence or absence of detergents. Monospecific polyclonal antibodies raised against N-SMase immunoprecipitated approximately 70% of N-SMase activity from urine, human kidney proximal tubular cells, and partially purified membrane-bound N-SMase from these cells. Western immunoblot assays revealed that the monospecific polyclonal antibody against urinary N-SMase recognized both the urinary N-SMase and the membrane-bound N-SMase. Because this enzyme is distinct biochemically and immunologically as compared to acid sphingomyelinase (EC 3.1.4.12), we would like to assign it an enzyme catalog number of EC 3.1.4.13. The availability of N-SMase and corresponding antibody will be useful in studying various aspects of this enzyme in biological systems."
https://openalex.org/W1485826168,"Abstract The expression of the genes encoding cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme (SCC) and steroid 11 beta-hydroxylase (11 beta-OHase) was examined in Y1 mouse adrenocortical tumor cells and in derivative cell lines defective in cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. Y1 cells expressed both genes constitutively, and treatment with 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP) increased expression 5-10-fold. In three independent protein kinase mutants, expression of SCC and 11 beta-OHase was impaired to degrees dependent upon the severity of defect in cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. In Kin-2, the least impaired mutant clone, basal expression of SCC was the same as in Y1 cells. Treatment of Kin-2 with 8-Br-cAMP increased SCC RNA to the levels seen in stimulated Y1 cells. In contrast, clone Kin-8, the most severe mutant, expressed markedly diminished basal and 8-Br-cAMP-stimulated levels of SCC mRNA. Kin-7 had basal and 8-Br-cAMP-stimulated levels of SCC mRNA which were intermediate to Kin-2 and Kin-8. None of the Kin mutants constitutively expressed detectable levels of 11 beta-OHase transcripts, and only Kin-2 responded to treatment with 8-Br-cAMP with increased expression of 11 beta-OHase; however, the time course of induction in Kin-2 was significantly delayed. The disparate patterns of expression of SCC and 11 beta-OHase in the Kin mutants suggest that these genes differ in their absolute requirement for cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. Experiments also were performed in which Kin-7 and Kin-8 mutants were restored to cAMP-responsive states by transfection with genes encoding normal sub-units of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. These phenotypic revertants recovered 8-Br-cAMP-inducible expression of SCC and 11 beta-OHase. These results strongly support the hypothesis that impaired expression of steroidogenic enzymes in the Kin mutants results directly from defects in cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1993621372,"The Gin DNA-inversion system of bacteriophage Mu normally requires a substrate containing two inverted recombination sites (gix) and an enhancer sequence on the same supercoiled DNA molecule. The reaction mechanism was investigated by separating these sites on catenated rings. Catenanes with the gix sites on one circle and the enhancer on the other recombined efficiently. Thus, the enhancer was fully functional even though it was located in trans to the gix sites. Multiple links between the rings are required for recombination. Multiply linked catenanes with gix sites on separate circles, one of which contained the enhancer, were also efficient substrates. Knotted constructs carrying directly repeated gix sites were recombined. Catenated and knotted substrates must also be supercoiled. These experiments eliminate simple tracking or looping models as explanations for why the enhancer and gix sites must be in cis with standard substrates. Rather, the Gin synaptic complex requires the three sites to be mutually intertwined in a right-handed fashion with a unique polarity of the gix sites. This geometry is achieved by branching of the DNA substrate and requires the energy and structure of supercoiling, catenation, or knotting."
https://openalex.org/W1911366696,"From medium conditioned by 3T3 cells, we had previously purified to apparent homogeneity a novel inhibitory diffusible factor of 45 kDa (IDF45), and then determined the amino-terminal sequence. IDF45 prevented reversibly the growth of chick embryo fibroblast (CEF). In these cells, DNA synthesis stimulated by 1% serum was 50% inhibited in the presence of 45 ng/ml (1 nM) IDF45. In the present article, we show that, in CEF, DNA synthesis stimulated by IGF-I was 100% inhibited in the presence of purified IDF45. Furthermore, the 45-kDa protein (IDF45) was, after Western blotting, able to bind IGF-I. The inhibitory effect of IDF45 upon serum stimulation did not seem to be the result of its inhibitory activity upon IGF-I stimulation, since stimulation by IGF-I and serum were additive. Moreover, it was possible to dissociate the two inhibitory effects: when added to v-src transformed CEF, IDF45 was able to 100% inhibit stimulation induced by IGF-I and was unable to significantly decrease stimulation induced by serum, as was previously observed. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that IDF45 has two distinct functions, one of which was to bind IGF-I and the other to inhibit serum stimulation. Indeed, it was impossible to separate the two functions when IDF45 was purified by cation exchange fast protein liquid chromatography, a method very different from reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography previously used for purification to apparent homogeneity of IDF45. On the other hand, if the IGF binding activity and inhibitory activity effect upon serum stimulation were carried by two different proteins, the presence of IGF-I (in conditions where most of the 45-kDa proteins were bound to IGF-I) should not have affected the activity of the molecule inhibiting serum stimulation. However, we observed the contrary: when IDF45 was bound to IGF-I, it lost its inhibitory effect upon stimulation induced by serum. This suggests that the two activities occurred on the same protein and that IDF45 is a bifunctional protein."
https://openalex.org/W1583987899,"Abstract The regulation of gelsolin levels during differentiation of the murine embryonal carcinoma cell line, PC-13, was investigated using nucleic acid and immunological probes. A cDNA clone, Mu-319, which contained the entire coding sequence for the cytoplasmic form of murine gelsolin was isolated using a polyclonal antibody. Gelsolin was detected in several cell lines but was not detectable in three undifferentiated embryonal carcinoma cell lines. Levels of gelsolin mRNA increased 10-fold during the differentiation of the murine embryonal carcinoma cell line, PC-13. Differentiation of PC-13 was accompanied by changes in cell shape, from small indistinct cells to large flat cells. The accumulation of gelsolin mRNA in PC-13 cells began 12-24 h after addition of the differentiation-inducing agents. In comparison, 2-5A-dependent RNase activity showed a 40-fold increase beginning after 24 to 36 h and c-fos mRNA were shown to increase about 9-fold beginning 36 to 60 h after induction of differentiation. The levels of gelsolin per se, as determined by immunoreactivity were also shown to increase with differentiation of PC-13 cells. These results suggest that gelsolin may play a role in the restructuring of actin filaments which accompanies the dramatic changes in cell shape during differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1846485340,"Abstract The location of the active site of the membrane-bound anticoagulant complex of thrombin and thrombomodulin has been determined relative to the membrane surface using fluorescence energy transfer. Thrombin was reacted with 5-(dimethylamino)-1-naphthalenesulfonylglutamylglycylarginyl chloromethyl ketone (DEGR-CK) to yield DEGR-thrombin, an analogue of thrombin with a fluorescent dye covalently attached to its active site. When DEGR-thrombin was titrated with thrombomodulin that had been reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles containing octadecylrhodamine, singlet-singlet energy transfer was observed between the donor dyes, each in an active site of a DEGR-thrombin bound to thrombomodulin, and the acceptor dyes at the outer surface of the phospholipid bilayer. The extent of energy transfer reached a maximum when DEGR-thrombin and thrombomodulin were equimolar in the sample, as expected for the formation of a 1:1 complex between thrombin and thrombomodulin. This energy transfer was dependent upon the binding of DEGR-thrombin to thrombomodulin because no energy transfer was observed with vesicles that lacked thrombomodulin, and the extent of energy transfer was reduced greatly by the addition of excess unmodified nonfluorescent thrombin to compete with DEGR-thrombin for binding to the thrombomodulin. From the dependence of the energy transfer upon the acceptor density and assuming kappa 2 = 2/3, the distance of closest approach between a dye in the active site of the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex and a dye at the membrane surface was determined to average 66 A (65 +/- 3 A for phosphatidylcholine vesicles without and 67 +/- 5 A for those with 20% phosphatidylserine). This distance was also insensitive to the presence or absence of Ca2+. These direct measurements indicate that the active site of the membrane-bound thrombin-thrombomodulin complex is located far above the phospholipid surface, that the peptide bond cleaved during the activation of protein C is situated about 66 A above the membrane, that the thrombin binding site thrombomodulin is positioned more than 45 A above the membrane, ant that thrombin, with a diameter near 40 A, is not positioned alongside thrombomodulin near the membrane to form the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex but is instead bound on top of thrombomodulin."
https://openalex.org/W1498770776,"Abstract FRTL5 rat thyroid cells possess separate high affinity receptors for insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF I) that undergo beta-subunit phosphorylation upon interaction with the specific ligand. Phosphorylation is rapid and dose-dependent and occurs primarily on tyrosine residues. Within 2 min, both insulin and IGF I also give rise to a Mr 175,000 phosphoprotein (pp175) that can be immunoprecipitated by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (alpha-Tyr(P]. Phosphorylation of pp175 occurs on serine and threonine as well as tyrosine residues. When FRTL5 cells are solubilized with 1% Triton X-100, alpha-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitates phosphorylated insulin and IGF I receptors but little pp175 from the Triton-soluble fraction. After treatment of the Triton-insoluble portion with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 100 degrees C, pp175 can be identified by immunoprecipitation with alpha-Tyr(P). The fraction of FRTL5 cells that remains after extraction of an attached monolayer with 1% Triton for 5 min at 22 degrees C contains most of the cytoskeleton and also nuclei. Extraction of this 32P-labeled cytoskeleton preparation with sodium dodecyl sulfate followed by alpha-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitation results in almost complete recovery of the pp175 content of the cells. When a nuclear fraction was prepared from FRTL5 cells by differential centrifugation, pp175 was not found in the nuclear pellet from labeled cells, but greater than 80% of pp175 was recovered in the supernatant. We conclude that pp175 is a common substrate for insulin and IGF I receptor kinases which, in FRTL5 cells, is associated with the cytoskeleton. It is suggested that phosphorylation of proteins associated with cytoskeletal elements could be involved in insulin and IGF I action in cells."
https://openalex.org/W1568498906,"Abstract Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and a polyclonal antiserum were produced against a kainic acid receptor (KAR) purified from frog brain. Several of the mAb and the antiserum immunoprecipitated [3H]kainic acid binding activity from solubilized preparations of frog brain and labeled a group of proteins on immunoblots that migrated at Mr = 48,000. These results confirm that the ligand binding subunit of the frog brain KAR is contained in the Mr = 48,000 proteins. Immunoblots from different frog tissues demonstrated that the antibody reactivity was highly concentrated in the frog nervous system with no detectable immunoreactivity observed in non-neuronal tissues. The purified KAR was radioiodinated and subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. A series of proteins was detected at Mr = 48,000 with isoelectric points from 5.5 to 6.3. The anti-KAR mAb and the antiserum reacted with the same group of proteins from frog whole brain after separation by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Peptide maps of the 125I-labeled KAR separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the group of proteins clustered at Mr = 48,000 is homologous. mAb KAR-B1 reacted on immunoblots with a protein in rat brain with a Mr = 99,000. This protein comigrated with an unreduced form of the KAR in frog brain. It was present in rat cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum but was not detected in thalamus, globus pallidus, or brain stem, nor was it detected in rat non-neuronal tissues. The presence of the Mr = 99,000 immunoreactive polypeptide in discrete areas of rat brain suggests that this protein may be part of a mammalian KAR or a related receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1561901907,"Previous work from this laboratory has shown that glucocorticoids and (Sp)-cAMPS, a cyclic AMP analogue, stimulate the accumulation of angiotensinogen mRNA in isolated hepatocytes. The present study demonstrated that glucocorticoids stimulate the accumulation of a novel, 2.25-kilobase transcript of the angiotensinogen gene, both in isolated hepatocytes and in the intact liver. (Sp)-cAMPS was synergistic with dexamethasone in causing the accumulation of the larger species of RNA in hepatocytes, but had no effect by itself. Primer extension analysis and S1 mapping experiments proved that the 2.25-kilobase angiotensinogen RNA consisted of two larger forms of angiotensinogen RNA extended at their 5' ends. The novel transcripts are generated by the use of two new transcription initiation sites in the angiotensinogen gene, located at nucleotide positions -328 and -386 relative to the start site at position +1 used in the absence of hormone. A consensus TATA box is found at the expected position 25-30 nucleotides upstream from the start site at position -328, and another TATA-like sequence is found 25-30 nucleotides upstream from the start site at -386. In addition, two consensus glucocorticoid response elements occur upstream from the initiation sites. The larger angiotensinogen RNAs do not appear to code for a novel form of the angiotensinogen protein. It appears that glucocorticoids can direct transcription from a second promoter in the angiotensinogen gene and that this promoter is absolutely dependent on the hormone. To date, this situation appears to be unique to the angiotensinogen gene."
https://openalex.org/W1580810224,"Abstract We previously purified an activity from meiotic cell extracts of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that promotes the transfer of a strand from a duplex linear DNA molecule to complementary circular single-stranded DNA, naming it Strand Transfer Protein alpha (STP alpha) (Sugino, A., Nitiss, J., and Resnick, M. A. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85, 3683-3687). This activity requires no nucleotide cofactor but is stimulated more than 10-fold by the addition of yeast single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (ySSBs). In this paper, we describe the aggregation and strand transfer of double-stranded and single-stranded DNA promoted by STP alpha and ySSB. There is a good correlation between the aggregation induced by various DNA-binding proteins (ySSBs, DBPs and histone proteins) and the stimulation of STP alpha-mediated DNA strand transfer. This implies that the stimulation by ySSBs and other binding proteins is probably due to the condensation of single-stranded and double-stranded DNA substrates into coaggregates. Within these coaggregates there is a higher probability of pairing between homologous double-stranded and single-stranded DNA, favoring the initiation of strand transfer. The aggregation reaction is rapid and precedes any reactions related to DNA strand transfer. We propose that condensation into coaggregates is a presynaptic step in DNA strand transfer promoted by STP alpha and that pairing between homologous double- and single-stranded DNA (synapsis) occurs in these coaggregates. Synapsis promoted by STP alpha and ySSBs also occurs between covalently closed double-stranded DNA and single-stranded linear DNA as well as linear double-stranded and linear single-stranded DNAs in the absence of any nucleotide cofactors."
https://openalex.org/W1631036353,"Abstract We have previously shown that purified T4 DNA topoisomerase promotes illegitimate recombination between two lambda DNA molecules, or between lambda and plasmid DNA in vitro (Ikeda, H. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 83, 922-926). Since the recombinant DNA contains a duplication or deletion, it is inferred that the cross-overs take place between nonhomologous sequences of lambda DNA. In this paper, we have examined the sequences of the recombination junctions produced by the recombination between two lambda DNA molecules mediated by T4 DNA topoisomerase. We have shown that there is either no homology or there are 1-5-base pair homologies between the parental DNAs in seven combinations of lambda recombination sites, indicating that homology is not essential for the recombination. Next, we have shown an association of the recombination sites with the topoisomerase cleavage sites, indicating that a capacity of the topoisomerase to make a transient double-stranded break in DNA plays a role in the illegitimate recombination. A consensus sequence for T4 topoisomerase cleavage sites, RNAY decreases NNNNRTNY, was deduced. The cleavage experiment showed that T4 topoisomerase-mediated cleavage takes place in a 4-base pair staggered fashion and produces 5'-protruding ends."

Antisera against synthetic oligopeptides were used to map the resultant fragments in order to identify protease-sensitive regions of the channel's structure in its native membrane environment. Antibodies to the amino terminus labeled major fragments of Mr approximately 130,000 and 90,000 and lesser amounts of other peptides as small as Mr approximately 12,000. Antisera to epitopes within the carboxyl-terminal half of the primary sequence recognized two fragments of Mr approximately 110,000 and 78,000. Individual antisera also selectively labeled smaller polypeptides in the most extensively cleaved preparations. The immunoreactivity patterns of monoclonal antibodies previously raised against the purified channel were then surveyed. The binding sites for one group of monoclonals, including several that recognize subtype-specific epitopes in the channel structure, were localized within a 12-kDa fragment near the amino terminus. The distribution of carbohydrate along the primary structure of the channel was also assessed by quantitating {sup 125}I-wheat germ agglutinin and 125I-concanavalin A binding to the proteolytic peptides. Most of the carbohydrate detected by these lectins was located between 22 and 90 kDa from themore » amino terminus of the protein. No lectin binding was detected to fragments arising from carboxyl-terminal half of the protein. These results were analyzed in terms of current models of sodium channel tertiary structure.

https://openalex.org/W1575794923,"When intact HeLa cells were incubated at 45 degrees C, there was progressive inactivation of proline endopeptidase. Rapid loss of the enzyme did not occur in extracts maintained at 45 degrees C. Since Western blots of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels showed no decrease in the immunoreactive 70-kDa proline endopeptidase band, its in vivo disappearance apparently results from irreversible denaturation or modification. Loss of proline endopeptidase activity was paralleled by reduced degradation of injected ubiquitin and bovine serum albumin. In contrast, proteolysis of injected lysozyme or pancreatic trypsin inhibitor was barely affected. Electrophoretic analysis of ubiquitin or bovine serum albumin retrieved from heated HeLa cells showed that the injected proteins were intact. Thus, the presence of proline endopeptidase appears to be required for initial cleavage of these two substrates, but it has not been shown that the enzyme is directly responsible. Selective stabilization of a subset of the injected proteins does, however, demonstrate the existence of distinct proteolytic pathways in HeLa cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W1595967728,"Abstract Mouse BC3H1 myocytes were incubated with 32Pi before acetylcholine receptors were solubilized, immunoprecipitated, and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. More than 90% of the 32P found in the receptor was bound to the delta subunit. Two phosphorylation sites in this subunit were resolved by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography after exhaustive proteolysis of the protein with trypsin. Sites 1 and 2 were phosphorylated to approximately the same level in control cells. The divalent cation ionophore, A23187, increased 32P in site 1 by 40%, but did not affect the 32P content of site 2. In contrast, isoproterenol increased 32P in site 2 by more than 60%, while increasing 32P in site 1 by only 20%. When dephosphorylated receptor was incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP and the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, the delta subunit was phosphorylated to a maximal level of 1.6 phosphates/subunit. Approximately half of the phosphate went into site 2, with the remainder going into a site not phosphorylated in cells. The alpha subunit was phosphorylated more slowly, but phosphorylation of both alpha and delta subunits was blocked by the heat-stable protein inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Phosphorylation of the receptor was also observed with preparations of phosphorylase kinase. In this case phosphorylation occurred in the beta subunit and site 1 of the delta subunit, neither of which were phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The rate of receptor phosphorylation by phosphorylase kinase was slow relative to that catalyzed by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Therefore, it can not yet be concluded that phosphorylase kinase phosphorylates the beta subunit and the delta subunit site 1 in cells. However, the results strongly support the hypothesis that phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase accounts for phosphorylation of the alpha subunit and the delta subunit site 2 in response to elevations in cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W1580931688,"Neurospora crassa endo-exonuclease, an enzyme implicated in recombinational DNA repair, was found previously to have a distributive endonuclease activity with a high specificity for single strand DNA and a highly processive exonuclease activity. The activities of endo-exonuclease on double strand DNA substrates have been further explored. Endo-exonuclease was shown to have a low bona fide endonuclease activity with completely relaxed covalently closed circular DNA and made site-specific breaks in linear double strand DNA at a low frequency while simultaneously generating a relatively high level of single strand breaks (nicks) in the DNA. Sequencing at nicks induced by endo-exonuclease in pBR322 restriction fragments showed that the highest frequency of nicking occurred at the mid-points of two sites with the common sequence, p-AGCACT-OH. In addition, sequencing revealed less frequent nicking at identical or homologous hexanucleotide sequences in all other 54 cases examined where these sequences either straddled the break site itself or were within a few nucleotides on either side of the break site. The exonucleolytic action of endo-exonuclease on linear DNA showed about 100-fold preference for acting in the 5' to 3' direction. Removal of the 5'-terminal phosphates substantially reduced this activity, internal nicking, and the ability of endo-exonuclease to generate site-specific double strand breaks. On the other hand, nicking of the dephosphorylated double strand DNA with pancreatic DNase I stimulated the exonuclease activity by almost 5-fold, but no stimulation was observed when the DNA was nicked by Micrococcal nuclease. Thus, 5'-p termini either at double strand ends or at nicks in double strand DNA are entry points to the duplex from which endo-exonuclease diffuses linearly or tracks in the 5' to 3' direction to initiate its major endo- and exonucleolytic actions. The results are interpreted to show how it is possible for endo-exonuclease to generate single strand DNA for switching into a homologous duplex either at a nick or while remaining bound at a double strand break in the DNA. Such mechanisms are consistent with current models for recombinational double strand break repair in eukaryotes."
