https://openalex.org/W1557061892,"Abstract Mice were fasted overnight, and the following morning the the animals were tube-fed (a) a complete amino acid mixture, (b) the same mixture devoid of one essential amino acid (tryptophan, threonine, isoleucine, or methionine), (c) a single essential amino acid (l-tryptophan, l-threonine, l-isoleucine, or l-methionine), or (d) nothing. All animals were killed 1 hour after the feeding. Postmitochondrial supernatants of liver homogenates were prepared and used for determination of protein synthesis in vitro, or, after addition of deoxycholate, for direct sucrose density gradient analyses. The polyribosome patterns of the livers of all the groups fell generally into one of two basic patterns: A, a shift of polyribosomes toward lighter aggregates, particularly monosomes, and a concomitant decrease of heavier aggregates, or B, a shift toward heavier aggregates with fewer monosomes. All groups fed l-tryptophan alone or amino acid mixtures which contained tryptophan, whether complete or incomplete with respect to other amino acids, showed the B polyribosome pattern, while the fasted controls, the tryptophan-devoid group, or the other single amino acid groups had the A pattern. The A pattern was associated with a low level of incorporation of 14C-leucine or 14C-phenylalanine into protein in vitro, while mice with the B pattern had a considerably enhanced level of incorporation. Four milligrams of l-tryptophan, but not equimolar amounts of single compounds structurally related to tryptophan, induced an increase in stimulation of hepatic protein synthesis, which changed little with higher levels of tryptophan. l-Tryptophan rapidly reached the liver and induced enhanced hepatic protein synthesis within 5 to 10 min, reached its peak effect by 1 hour, then began to decrease within 2 hours, and returned to control fasted levels within 4 to 6 hours. Animals fasted for longer periods (40 and 64 hours) rather than overnight (16 hours), adrenalectomized mice, and mice pretreated with actinomycin D, when tubefed l-tryptophan, showed enhanced hepatic protein synthesis as well as the B polyribosome profile response. Incubation in vitro with microsomal and supernatant fractions revealed results similar to those found with postmitochondrial supernatants and indicated that the microsomes of the tryptophan-fed animals accounted for the main increase in hepatic protein synthesis. Administration of 14C-leucine intraperitoneally to tryptophan-fed mice revealed a small but significant increase in hepatic protein synthesis in vivo over that in control fasted mice. The results indicate that dietary tryptophan plays a special role in the regulation of polyribosome aggregation and protein synthesis in the liver."
https://openalex.org/W1584642454,"Abstract This study establishes facts required to deduce the structures of the several higher oxidation states of protoheme proteins. Low temperature optical spectra (15–77°K) are correlated with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra (1.4°K) of horseradish peroxidase and its derivatives. These include the high spin and low spin forms of ferri-horseradish peroxidase, the ferro- and ferri-horseradish peroxidase cyanides, ferro-horseradish peroxidase, oxyperoxidase, carbon monoxide-ferro-horseradish peroxidase, Compound I, and Compound II of horseradish peroxidase. Solutions of ferri-horseradish peroxidase, prepared at pH 7.0 to 8.4, exhibit optical and magnetic spectra which can be ascribed to a single paramagnetic species, high spin heme iron. The EPR signal indicates that the heme of peroxidase exists in an environment which has lower symmetry than axial. Solutions of ferri-peroxidase prepared at pH 11.4 exhibit optical and EPR spectra which can be ascribed to low spin heme iron. The optical spectrum of oxyperoxidase shows little change with temperature, indicating that it is not an equilibrium mixture of species whose relative abundance is affected by temperature. EPR spectra of oxyperoxidase show no signal attributable to oxyperoxidase and therefore it is probably diamagnetic, as is oxyhemoglobin. The wave length maxima of the low temperature optical spectrum of oxyperoxidase are the same as those of the low temperature spectrum of the low spin (alkaline) form of ferri-peroxidase. Similarly, the wave length maxima of the low temperature optical spectrum of oxymyoglobin coincide with those of the low temperature spectrum of low spin (alkaline) ferri-myoglobin. Optical spectra of both Compound I and Compound II of horseradish peroxidase change little with temperature, indicating that neither of these compounds is an equilibrium mixture of species whose relative abundance is affected by temperature. EPR spectra at 1.4°K of Compounds I and II of peroxidase show no signals attributable to the compounds."

The combination of flavor and illness produced as conditioned decrement in consumption, but that of size and illness did not. Conversely, the combination of size and pain produced an inhibition of eating, but flavor and pain did not. Apparently, effective associative learning depends on central neural convergence of the paired afferent input."
https://openalex.org/W1554023844,"δ-Aminolevulinic acid dehydratase catalyzes the condensation of 2 molecules of δ-aminolevulinic acid to a pyrrole, porphobilinogen. This synthesis requires an aldol condensation, the elimination of the elements of water, and the formation of a Schiff base. Our data are consistent with the following mechanism as catalyzed by the enzyme of Rhodopseudomonas spheroides. One molecule of δ-aminolevulinic acid forms a Schiff base with the enzyme. This is followed by a nucleophilic attack, by the enzyme-δ-aminolevulinic acid anion intermediate, onto the carbonyl carbon atom of a 2nd δ-aminolevulinic acid molecule. The resulting aldol loses the elements of water, and the free amino group of the 2nd molecule of the substrate displaces the amino group of the enzyme by a transimination or transaldimination, thus forming porphobilinogen. Although both levulinic acid and ethyl levulinate form Schiff bases with the enzyme, only the free acid acts as a competitive inhibitor of δ-aminolevulinic acid. The affinity of the substrate for the enzyme is dependent on the ease of forming a Schiff base, and is also dependent on the formation of an ionic bond between the carboxyl group of the substrate and a positive charge on the enzyme at a particular distance away from the Schiff base linkage. Furthermore, the formation of heterologous pyrroles was demonstrated between levulinic acid or from its ester with δ-aminolevulinic acid. Since these pyrroles can only be formed if the levulinic acid or its ester is in Schiff base linkage with the enzyme, one can predict that the molecule of δ-aminolevulinic acid which gives rise to the acetic acid side chain in porphobilinogen is the molecule which was in Schiff base linkage with the enzyme, whereas the other molecule was either at another site or came from solution."

https://openalex.org/W1597831921,"Abstract This paper presents studies on the characterization of the protein component of mammalian erythrocyte membranes. Exhaustive lipid extraction of the membrane results in a glycoprotein residue containing greater than 90% of the total membrane protein. The composition of this membrane preparation is presented. Several methods have been developed to solubilize this protein. The protein is soluble in formic acid and sodium dodecyl sulfate solutions. After total succinylation of the protein, complete solubility is achieved in aqueous solutions at neutral pH. A new method for completely solubilizing the unmodified membrane protein in urea and guanidine hydrochloride solutions at neutral pH in the absence of detergent is presented. This method depends on initial solubilization of the membrane protein in phenol. End group analysis, electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation, and chromatography in these solvent systems reveal the protein in membranes to be a heterogeneous collection of proteins, many in the molecular weight range near 50,000. The membrane preparation and the solvent systems described will be valuable in the characterization of the individual protein molecules present in the membrane. These studies are now in progress."
https://openalex.org/W1588519390,"Abstract The observed equilibrium constant for the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and inorganic phosphate has been calculated as a function of pH and pMg (-log (Mg2+)) at 25°, along with the numbers of moles of H+ and Mg2+ produced per mole of ATP hydrolyzed. This equilibrium constant has also been calculated as a function of pMg and pCa (-log (Ca2+)) at a constant pH of 7.4, along with the numbers of moles of Mg2+ and Ca2+ produced per mole of ATP hydrolyzed. The productions of inorganic phosphate, H+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ are linked through the acid dissociations and metal ion binding of ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate. Recalculation of earlier chemical equilibrium data has led to ΔG0'298 = -9500 cal mole-1 in the absence of magnesium ions, -8600 cal mole-1 at pMg = 2, and -8800 cal mole-1 at pMg = 3, at 25°, pH 7, and 0.2 ionic strength for the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and inorganic phosphate. In limiting cases, the inkage may be seen to result from certain simple reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1520679419,"In this paper we present probable structures for derivatives of horseradish and cytochrome c peroxidases and also propose a simple scheme which encompasses the molecular structures and electronic configurations of the derivatives of these and other protoheme proteins in the oxidation states from II to VI. Four lines of evidence are used to define the structures of the heme groups and their associated ligands. These are: low temperature optical spectra in the visible region, electron paramagnetic resonance spectra taken at 1.5°K, the oxidation state of the compounds, and proof of the identity of the ligands in position 6 of the heme iron atom. Only the ferrous and ferric forms of heme iron are needed to describe all of these compounds, and higher oxidation states of the iron atom need not be invoked. A nomenclature describing the electronic configuration of the heme and its associated ligands is presented, which specifies for each compound, the d electron configuration of the heme, the structure of the sixth ligand of the heme iron atom, and the oxidation state of the compound. The electronic configuration of the iron, ferrous or ferric, is not necessarily related to the oxidation state of the compound. An extension of our reasoning leads us to conclude that the electronic configurations of oxyhemoglobin, oxymyoglobin, and oxyperoxidase are the same, and that the oxygenation reaction involves the migration of an electron from the ferrous heme iron to the oxygen molecule. In consequence, the heme iron atoms of these compounds are formally in the ferric low spin state, and the oxygen molecules in the sixth ligand positions each carry 3 oxidizing eq."
https://openalex.org/W2155638944,"Abstract Phosphoglucose isomerase (d-glucose-6-phosphate ketol-isomerase, EC 5.3.1.9) from rabbit skeletal muscle has been subjected to a detailed kinetic study of the effect of pH and temperature on the Michaelis constants, the maximal velocities, the dissociation constant for the competitive inhibitor 6-phosphogluconate, and the equilibrium constant of the reaction. A coupled pH-stat assay was established as being suitable for measurement of initial velocities in the forward direction between pH 6.0 and 10.0; analogously, the validity of a coupled spectrophotometric assay of the reverse reaction was demonstrated for the range of pH 6.0 to 9.5. Graphical and computer analysis of Km and Vmax data, obtained with these assays as a function of pH, suggest the participation in isomerase catalysis of two ionizable groups in the enzyme with average pK values of 6.75 and 9.3, at 30°. From the change in pK with temperature, values of 7,700 and 16,000 cal per mole, respectively, have been calculated for the heats of ionization for these two groups. These data are considered to be consistent with the involvement of both an imidazole group of histidine and an e-amino group of lysine. Analysis of Ki data for 6-phosphogluconate, obtained as a function of pH for the forward and the reverse reaction, showed no pK at alkaline pH; this has been interpreted as suggesting that the e-amino group of lysine is not involved in the binding of 6-phosphogluconate to the enzyme. On the basis of this evidence, a dual function mechanism is proposed in which the protonated e-amino nitrogen first catalyzes the opening of the hexose ring structure to yield the straight chain form of hexose 6-phosphate, which then undergoes isomerization via formation of an enediol intermediate, with the nonprotonated nitrogen of the imidazole group participating as a base catalyst in this second step."
https://openalex.org/W1511370992,"Abstract δ-Aminolevulinic acid dehydratase from Rhodopseudomonas spheroides, an enzyme which catalyzes the synthesis of the pyrrole, porphobilinogen, from 2 molecules of δ-aminolevulinic acid, has been purified 300- to 400-fold. The protein exhibits many of the characteristics of an allosteric enzyme. A plot of enzymatic activity versus substrate concentration yields a sigmoidal curve with an activity of about one-half that found in the presence of allosteric activators at high substrate concentrations. The allosteric effectors are monovalent cations, potassium, lithium, rubidium, and ammonium. A similar plot in the presence of these activators yields a hyperbolic saturation curve. Furthermore, the addition of K+ ions causes an association of the enzyme to form an equilibrium mixture of three enzymatically active species, a monomer, a dimer, and a trimer. The monomer, with a molecular weight of approximately 250,000, is the only species found on a sedimentation analysis in a sucrose gradient at very low concentrations of the above monovalent metallic cation. Sodium ions, on the other hand, do not fully activate the enzyme, as compared with the other alkali metal ions, whereas magnesium ions activate the enzyme to Vmax of about 80% of that found with K+, Li+, Rb+, and NH4+ ions. Manganese ions at low concentrations activate the enzyme but become inhibitory at higher concentrations. The enzymatic activity is markedly inhibited by protoporphyrin and by hemin."
https://openalex.org/W1589677189,"Abstract The dissociation of normal human oxyhemoglobin has been studied by gel filtration under conditions of neutral pH and moderate ionic strength, with the use of both integral boundaries, formed between solution and solvent, and finite difference boundaries, formed between solution and solution. The experimental data obtained have been treated by nonlinear least squares procedures to estimate the relevant parameters with their associated standard errors. For this purpose, theoretical equations have been derived for two models, firstly a simple dimer-tetramer reversible equilibrium, and secondly a monomer-dimer-trimer-tetramer reversible equilibrium. In both models the dependence on concentration of the elution volume of the individual species has been taken into account."

The metaphase block induced by nitrous oxide was dependent on pressure and was reversible. Exposure of HeLa cells to nitrous oxide had no significant effect on the synthesis of DNA, RNA, or protein. The progress of cells through the mitotic cycle was also unaffected. A high degree of mitotic synchrony was obtained in suspension cultures of HeLa cells treated with thymidine during exponential growth, resuspended in fresh medium, and then exposed to nitrous oxide."
https://openalex.org/W1564178578,"Abstract Creatine entry into the rat extensor digitorum longus muscle in vitro is inhibited by β-guanidinopropionic acid, β-guanidinoethanesulfonic acid, N-ethylguanidinoacetic acid, γ-guanidinobutyric acid, and guanidinoacetic acid (listed in order of effectiveness) but not by various amino acids or other compounds that lack an amidine group. β-Guanidinopropionic acid, when administered as 1% of the diet, also inhibits the entry of radioactively labeled creatine into skeletal muscle in vivo. In a study of the effects of three of the inhibitory compounds on the kinetics of creatine entry into the extensor digitorum longus muscle in vitro, each was found to compete with creatine for interaction with the transport site. From this study the Km and Vmax of creatine entry are 0.5 mm and 0.6 mmole per liter of intracellular water per hour, respectively; and the Ki values are 0.2 mm for β-guanidinopropionic acid, 1.0 mm for N-ethylguanidinoacetic acid, and 3.0 mm for guanidinoacetic acid. In a complementary study, β-guanidinopropionic acid was found to enter the extensor digitorum longus muscle by a saturable process with a Km of 0.2 mm and a Vmax of 0.6 mmole per liter of intracellular water per hour. Further, β-guanidinopropionic acid entry is competitively inhibited by creatine (Ki, 0.6 mm) and by guanidinoacetic acid (Ki, 3.3 mm). These data are evidence that creatine enters skeletal muscle via a novel transport site specifically adapted to interact with an amidine group."

https://openalex.org/W1587839003,"Abstract An enzyme is described that was observed in extracts of rat and bovine pituitary glands. This enzyme, named dipeptidyl arylamidase II, catalyzes the cleavage of the dipeptide moiety from Lys-Ala-β-naphthylamide at pH 5.5, but not from monoamino acid arylamides. Dipeptidyl arylamidase II exhibits no metal, halide, or sulfhydryl dependences, and its specificity is restricted to substrates having an unsubstituted NH2-terminus. Lower but significant rates of hydrolysis were also exhibited at pH 5.5 on the β-naphthylamides of Arg-Ala and Leu-Ala, with only traces of activity on the arylamides of Ala-Ala, Gly-Pro, and Ser-Met. No activity was detected on the β-naphthylamides of benzylodicarbonyl-Lys-Ala, Lys-Lys, Arg-Arg, Gly-Arg, Gly-Phe, Ser-Tyr, or His-Ser. Cations were exceptionally inhibitory to the hydrolysis of Lys-Ala-β-naphthylamide by dipeptidyl arylamidase II, and the sensitivity of the enzyme increased with the size of the cation: Li+ l Na+ l K+ l Tris l puromycin aminonucleoside l puromycin. A 50 mm concentration of Tris, pH 5.5, in the assay system gave a 96% inhibition of arylamidase II activity, while puromycin at 1 mm gave a 76% inhibition. A Km of 1.1 x 10-5 m was determined for the hydrolysis of Lys-Ala-β-naphthylamide at pH 5.5 at 37°. The inhibition by cations was competitive for all cations tested, with Ki values at pH 5.5 and 37° of 1.8 x 10-3 m for Na+, 3.2 x 10-4 m for Tris, 1.9 x 10-5 m for puromycin, and 3.0 x 10-5 m for puromycin aminonucleoside. Dipeptidyl arylamidase II activity was detected in tissues other than pituitary; thyroid, spleen, and kidney were relatively rich sources, whereas liver, pancreas, and serum were poor. The hydrolysis of Lys-Ala-β-naphthylamide at pH 5.5 by all tissues tested showed the same sensitivity to Tris ions. As indicated by studies with sucrose homogenates of fresh rat pituitary glands, and with subcellular fractions prepared by differential and density gradient centrifugation, dipeptidyl arylamidase II was located, along with acid phosphatase, in pituitary lysosomes. However, unlike acid phosphatase, arylamidase II appeared to be located almost exclusively in the lysosomes, and exhibited a functional latency of about 91 to 95%. Ser-Tyr arylamidase (dipeptidyl arylamidase I) was also found to be lysosomal, whereas Arg-Arg arylamidase (dipeptidyl arylamidase III) was cytoplasmic. The aminopolypeptidase and dipeptidase activities measured on Lys- and Arg-β-naphthylamide were predominantly (90 to 95%) cytoplasmic."
https://openalex.org/W1520129123,"Abstract The intracellular site of hepatic cholesterol and cholesterol ester synthesis was investigated in rats which had been given an intravenous injection of 2-14C-mevalonate. The distributions of 14C-squalene, 14C-lanosterol, 14C-cholesterol, and 14C-cholesterol ester among the liver subcellular fractions were determined and were compared with the distributions of DNA as marker for nuclei, and of marker enzymes for mitochondria, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membranes, and soluble components. The comparison shows that during conversion of mevalonic acid to cholesterol ester in vivo the above intermediates and product are, in the main, bound to the endoplasmic reticulum, indicating this to be the major site of cholesterol and cholesterol ester synthesis from squalene. The major part of the endogenous cholesterol, cholesterol ester, and phospholipid was also associated with the endoplasmic reticulum. Subfractionation of the microsomes showed that 14C-lipids formed from 2-14C-mevalonate are bound to both granular and agranular endoplasmic reticulum membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1537295851,"Abstract The time courses of the radioactive labels in subcellular fractions from cerebral cortex of mature rats following intraventricular injection of 14C-orotate and 3H-leucine were followed from 4 hours to 12 weeks. Special attention was directed to fractions obtained from nerve endings by sucrose gradient centrifugation. After initial transients, the declines in radioactive labels usually followed first order kinetics from 2 to 12 weeks. Within experimental error, the τ values for RNA in all fractions except the nuclear were the same, i.e. 12 ± 1 days. The value of τ in days for protein labels included: mitochondria, 20; synaptic vesicles, 21; synaptic membranes, 21; nerve ending soluble protein, 22; cell body soluble, 16; ribosomes, 12. The nuclei included long lived components (τ g 40 days) of both RNA and protein. These results indicate that both synaptic vesicles and the adjacent membranes are in a dynamic steady state with respect to protein synthesis, but there is no evidence that vesicles are appreciably broken down as a consequence of electrical activity of the neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1572949728,"A series of experiments was performed to test the proposal of others that citrate cleavage enzyme (EC 4.1.3.8) regulates the rate of fatty acid synthesis in rat liver. The results show that, in recovery from fasting, fatty acid synthesis increased markedly without change in citrate cleavage enzyme activity. After the administration of alloxan, fatty acid synthesis decreased prior to any change in citrate cleavage enzyme. Substitution of a high carbohydrate, low fat diet resulted in large increases in citrate cleavage enzyme activity without concomitant change in lipogenesis. The addition of purified citrate cleavage enzyme from rat liver to the fatty acid-synthesizing system from fasted animals did not restore fatty acid synthesis. It was concluded that citrate cleavage enzyme does not play a primary regulatory role in fatty acid synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1570207437,"Abstract 1. Puromycin dihydrochloride inhibited uptake of α-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB), 1-aminocyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid, and α,γ-diaminobutyric acid by intact diaphragm muscle from male rats weighing 60 to 90 g when the antibiotic was added to the system in vitro 120 and 180 min before the addition of the substrate. 2. In the absence of insulin, this inhibitory response was also produced by cycloheximide, but not by the aminonucleoside of puromycin or actinomycin D. In the presence of insulin, AIB uptake was inhibited by actinomycin D and the aminonucleoside of puromycin as well as by puromycin dihydrochloride and cycloheximide, the degree of inhibition paralleling inhibition of l-lysine incorporation into protein. 3. The antibiotics shown to inhibit amino acid transport did not change tissue water spaces, oxygen consumption, the concentration of α-amino nitrogen in the incubation medium, or the diffusion constant for AIB (Kd). 4. In diaphragm muscle from rats weighing 60 to 90 g, incubation with puromycin for 180 min reduced subsequent stimulation of AIB transport by insulin. In muscle from animals weighing 220 to 250 g, stimulation by insulin was completely abolished by puromycin. 5. These studies show that puromycin inhibits the synthesis of a rapidly turning over protein or proteins involved in the transport of AIB. The results suggest that insulin stimulates amino acid transport in two distinct ways: by increasing the affinity of the carrier mechanism for amino acids; and by initiating the synthesis of a specific protein or proteins which enhances transport."

At low substrate concentrations, the reaction rate is greater with l-cystine than with any of the other substances tested, including d-cystine, diacetyl-l-cystine, l-cystine diamide, l-cystinyldiglycine, l-homocystine, and β-hydroxyethyl disulfide."
https://openalex.org/W1486417225,"Abstract δ-Aminolevulinic acid dehydratase of Rhodopseudomonas spheroides, which catalyzes the synthesis of the pyrrole, porphobilinogen, associates into an equilibrium mixture of three protein species, a monomer, dimer, and trimer in the presence of potassium, rubidium, or ammonium ions; whereas in the absence of these monovalent cations, only the monomer can be found. Sedimentation analysis in a sucrose gradient, containing 0.05 m potassium ions, of the isolated monomer or dimer revealed the establishment of a new equilibrium mixture of the three protein species. However, the isolated dimer recentrifuged in a sucrose gradient, free of potassium ions, dissociated into the monomer. The substrate, δ-aminolevulinic acid, which has a cooperative effect on the enzyme activity, appears also to cause some degree of association of the monomer. Sodium and magnesium ions, at concentrations which activate the enzyme to an activity of about 50 and 80%, respectively, of that found with potassium ions, do not promote an association of the monomer. The monomer can be dissociated by 1 m urea and by dialysis into subunits the molecular weight of which is about one-half of that of the monomer, and these subunits can be reassociated into monomer, dimer, and trimer in the presence of potassium ions. The kinetics of urea inhibition is competitive with the substrate, and sedimentation analysis in a sucrose gradient containing both urea and substrate revealed that the subunit is either associated into the monomer by the substrate or the monomer is not completely dissociated into its subunits by urea in the presence of high concentrations of substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1481536411,"The spontaneous reaction between thiosulfate and cyanide and the rhodanese catalysis of that same reaction have been studied as a function of temperature and dielectric constant, and the activation parameters for the rate-determining steps of both reactions have been determined. Thermodynamic parameters for the dissociation of the rhodanese-thiosulfate complex have also been obtained. From a comparison of the values for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction with those for the spontaneous process, it has been possible to propose a more detailed mechanism for rhodanese catalysis. This mechanism involves binding of thiosulfate to a metal ion in the enzyme, with complex formation requiring a conformational change in the protein. In the metal ion-thiosulfate complex there is an electronic shift away from the planetary sulfur atom of thiosulfate, with resultant stretching and weakening of the sulfur-sulfur bond. This bond is then more susceptible to the attack by a strong enzymic nucleophil which effects the cleavage. Rupture of the sulfur-sulfur bond appears to be accompanied by a second conformational change."
https://openalex.org/W1490458250,"One of the 4 methionine residues in ribonuclease A, the one at position 29, is exposed to the solvent when the protein is in its native conformation. Under such conditions, this residue can be alkylated by CH3I to yield a fully active monomethyl derivative. The rate of alkylation, measured chromatographically by the disappearance of ribonuclease A, is constant between pH 2.5 and pH 5.0. At pH 2.5, ribonuclease A is converted quantitatively into S-methylmethionine-29 ribonuclease, which can be separated by chromatography on IRC-50. The structure of the methylated protein was established by isolating and characterizing peptides derived from the 14C-labeled methyl derivative after enzymatic and chemical cleavage. Key techniques were chemical cleavage with cyanogen bromide, followed by isolation of the labeled peptides on Sephadex rather than by ion exchange chromatography. Since minor components are not overlooked in a separation based only on size, the confidence with which it can be said that S-methylmethionine-29 ribonuclease is a homogeneous derivative rests primarily on the specific radioactivity of the peptide containing methionine-29, irrespective of yield. At least 92% of the molecules of ribonuclease in the chromatographic peak are alkylated on methionine-29."
https://openalex.org/W1604021928,"1. A procedure is presented for large scale fractionation of arginine-rich histones by exclusion chromatography. With this method, 2 to 3.5 g of histone Fractions 2a and 3 were fractionated. The two fractions contained the same histone components, but they differed in the amounts of each component. 2. In histone Fraction 2a, the glycine-rich, arginine-rich (GAR) histone accounted for approximately 70% of the protein present. This histone was obtained in a highly purified form after exclusion chromatography was repeated once, as shown by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, amino acid analysis, and peptide maps. Rechromatography of this product on Sephadex G-25 provided a GAR histone which was 96% pure. A quantity of GAR histone of 1 g was readily isolated by this procedure. 3. In histone Fraction 3, the arginine-rich, lysine-rich (AL) histone accounted for approximately 60% of the protein present. Rechromatography of the AL histone on Sephadex G-100 followed by rechromatography on Sephadex G-25 and Sephadex G-200 yielded a product approximately 96% pure.

The decarboxylase is selectively distributed on the 39 and 48 S ribosomes. The 48 S species can be maintained at 1 x 10-3 m Mg++, while more slowly sedimenting species appear at lower Mg++ concentrations. The nature and significance of the binding of the enzyme to the ribosomes are not known. The decarboxylase has sufficient catalytic activity to account for the rate of succinate decarboxylation observed with whole cells of M. lactilyticus and is operative at the optimum pH of the over-all succinate pathway. This pathway is postulated to occur through the following sequence of coupled reactions, in which DBC stands for 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazolylcobamide."

They have been prepared in 65% yield by gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 at pH 8.1 in the presence of 10-4 m diisopropyl phosphofluoridate, filtration through diethylaminoethyl cellulose at pH 9, and equilibrium chromatography on sulfoethyl Sephadex at pH 5.4. The major component, Porcine Inhibitor I, has a chemical molecular weight of 6024 and contains 56 residues per molecule: Asp4, Thr6, Ser6, Glu7, Pro5, Gly4, Ala1, Cys6, Val4, Ile3, Leu2, Tyr2, Lys4, Arg2. The minor component, Porcine Inhibitor II, contains 1 residue each fewer of glutamic acid, threonine, serine, and proline. The amino-terminal amino acid sequences, Thr-Ser-Pro-Gln-Arg-Glx-Ala and Arg-Glx-Ala (where Glx denotes glutamyl or glutaninyl), have been determined for Porcine Inhibitors I and II. It is likely that Inhibitor II is equivalent to residues 5 through 56 of Inhibitor I. The inhibitor isolated from bovine pancreatic juice (Greene, L. J., Rigbi, M., and Fackre, D. S., J. Biol. Chem., 241, 5610 (1966)) contains 56 amino acid residues and has the amino-terminal sequence Asn-Ile-Leu-Gly-Arg-Glu-Ala. There are a minimum of eight differences in amino acid sequence when Porcine Inhibitor I is compared with bovine inhibitor. The polypeptides are homogeneous by equilibrium chromatography, electrophoresis, and amino acid analysis, and also on the basis of the stoichiometry of their interaction with trypsin. The preparations appear to contain small amounts of dimer not in rapid equilibrium with monomer. The monomer molecular weights, determined by equilibrium centrifugation, and the minimum molecular weights, determined from the stoichiometry of the interactions with trypsin, are consistent with the chemical molecular weights calculated from amino acid composition. The inhibitors are secreted in the pancreatic juice in the free form (not combined with trypsin) and together are equivalent to 0.1% of the total protein in pancreatic juice. The relative concentrations are 4:1 for Inhibitors I and II, respectively. Burck, Cerwinsky, and Grinnan (Abstracts of the American Chemical Society Meeting, Chicago, September 1967, p. C-22) have prepared a fraction containing both inhibitors from acid extracts of porcine pancreas, and Fritz et al. (Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem., 348, 405 (1967)) have isolated a porcine inhibitor containing 53 residues of similar composition and properties. A partial purification of prekallikrein was achieved when porcine pancreatic juice was filtered on Sephadex G-75."
https://openalex.org/W1552766903,"The amino acid composition of several preparations of spinach ferredoxin was determined, and the most reliable composition was concluded to be: Lys4, His1, Arg1, Trp1, Asp13, Thr8, Ser7, Glu13, Pro4, Gly6, Ala9, Cys5, Val7, Met0, Ile4, Leu8, Tyr4, Phe2, (NH3)6. The total number of amino acid residues is 97. The molecular weight of spinach ferredoxin was determined by gel filtration, amino acid composition, and terminal amino acid analyses. The values ranged from 11,100 to 11,900. The amino-terminal sequence was determined by a modified Edman degradation procedure and Sanger's dinitrofluorobenzene method to be Ala–Ala–Tyr–Lys–Val–Thr–Leu. The carboxyl-terminal sequence was determined by the carboxypeptidase A procedure to be Leu–Thr–Ala."
https://openalex.org/W1648276370,"Abstract The kinetics of the reactions of human hemoglobin with carbon monoxide and oxygen has been studied in photochemical and rapid mixing experiments over a large range of hemoglobin concentration. When the reaction is initiated by rapid removal of the ligand from ligand-bound hemoglobin, the kinetics of the combination of hemoglobin with CO shows a marked concentration dependence in both the photochemical and the rapid mixing experiments. In dilute hemoglobin solutions (below 10-5 m in heme), dissociation of the ligand from oxyhemoglobin or carbonmonoxyhemoglobin is followed by slow changes (half-time of the order of seconds) in the properties of the system. These results lead to the following picture, which is also consistent with other as yet unexplained aspects of hemoglobin kinetics. (a) Ligand-bound hemoglobin dissociates reversibly into single chain molecules at concentrations below 10-5 m. (b) Deoxygenated hemoglobin has a much lower tendency to dissociate into single chain molecules, and there is no appreciable dissociation even at concentrations of the order of 10-6 to 10-7 m. (c) The association of deoxygenated α and β chains is a relatively slow process. Therefore, after sudden dissociation of the ligand from dilute hemoglobin solutions, the properties of the system, for a brief time, are those of a mixture of deoxygenated hemoglobin and deoxygenated α and β chains. (d) The properties of the single chain molecules obtained by dilution of ligand-bound hemoglobin are the same as those of isolated α and β hemoglobin chains as obtained by preparative procedures."
https://openalex.org/W1488457300,"Studies of chemically reacting systems of macromolecules by conventional transport experiments are subject to inherent ambiguities. These uncertainties often prohibit an unequivocal determination of the explicit reactions which give rise to the average properties being measured. Such difficulties may be circumvented with molecular sieve chromatography in which subunit dissociation curves are obtained on columns of different gel porosity. From such data, procedures are described for enumeration of components in a complex reaction mixture and for determination of their molecular size distribution. For a system having k components data must be obtained on at least 2k − 1 columns of different porosity to obtain the weight fractions of all components in the system. If the equilibria are shifted by variation in some parameter, such as total concentration, and the distributions are determined at various resulting states of the equilibria, it is possible to calculate stoichiometries between all components and to determine the equilibrium constants for the system. Additional information that can be obtained with these procedures includes the weight average degree of polymerization and the molecular weight of monomer. These procedures depend on the fact that molecular sieve partition coefficients are linearly independent functions of both the molecular size and calibration constants (porosity) of the gel. Experimental data are presented in support of this linear independence. Feasibility of the mathematical procedures has been shown by calculations carried out for a hypothetical dissociation reaction in which random errors have been applied to the ideal dissociation curves, and the resulting data have been used to calculate the stoichiometry and equilibrium constant for the reaction. In order to minimize the effort involved in multiple column experiments and to obtain an overdetermined system for calculations, the methods can be extended to a single column in which an arbitrary gradient of gel porosity is established. The basic features of this molecular sieve gradient chromatography technique are outlined and its potential use in determining molecular size distributions has been described. These methods are applicable to multicomponent systems in which the various species are in rapidly reversible equilibrium, in slow equilibrium, or are noninteracting. The use of columns having more than one gel porosity provides a stringent test for the assumption that the column bed material does not itself perturb the chemical equilibria being studied."
https://openalex.org/W1540668902,"Abstract Low concentrations of 1,3-diphosphoglyceric acid (1,3-di-PGA) stimulated phosphoglucomutase in the reaction without added glucose 1,6-diphosphate. The concentration for half-maximal stimulation was about 5 x 10-6 m. The response to 1,3-di-PGA passed through a maximum value at 1 x 10-5 m. Low concentrations of glucose-1,6-di-P showed stimulatory effects additive with the effects of low concentrations of 1,3-di-PGA. With glucose-1,6-di-P near or above its Km, 1,3-di-PGA above 2 x 10-7 m was inhibitory. The inhibition by 1,3-di-PGA appeared competitive with glucose-1,6-di-P when glucose 1-phosphate was 3.3 mm; the Ki was about 5 x 10-6 m. The stimulatory influence of 1,3-di-PGA has tentatively been attributed to its overcoming of glucose-1-P inhibition and to the likelihood that it phosphorylates dephosphoenzyme. 1,3-Di-PGA generated in situ or added as a purified reactant in the presence of glucose monophosphate and phosphoglucomutase promoted production of glucose-1,6-di-P that did not parallel the over-all mutase reaction. Glucose-1,6-di-P therefore did not accumulate merely as a function of increased mutase turnover, but presumably owing to displacement from the enzyme by 1,3-di-PGA. Hydroxylamine markedly inhibited glucose-1,6-di-P production. Commercial preparations of yeast 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGA-kinase) used for generating 1,3-di-PGA in situ contained phosphoglucomutase as a contaminant. After PGA-kinase was freed of phosphoglucomutase by gel filtration, glucose-1,6-di-P production was totally dependent on separately added phosphoglucomutase. 2,3-Diphosphoglyceric acid and 3-phosphoglyceric acid inhibited the mutase reaction competitively with glucose-1,6-di-P. The Ki values were about 5 x 10-5 m and 5 x 10-4 m, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1550793979,"Abstract Proton relaxation rate (PRR) studies indicated that there was little direct interaction between manganous ion and adenylate kinase. However, a large enhancement of the PRR of water was observed in the presence of ATP; for the enzyme combined with manganous-ATP complex rather than directly with the metal ion. Thus adenylate kinase is similar to creatine kinase but not to pyruvate kinase, with respect to the formation of the ternary enzyme-metal-substrate complex. The enhancement of the PRR of the ternary complex, MnATP-adenylate kinase, was determined to be 35 at 25 Mc per sec, pH 8.0, and 24°. The dissociation constant of MnATP2- from the ternary complex was determined to be 0.5 x 10-4 m from the PRR data. A combination of PRR measurements and of free manganese determinations by electron paramagnetic resonance was used to determine the dissociation constant for MnATP2- and also for the free nucleotide from the enzyme. Values of 0.9 x 10-4 m and 0.3 x 10-4 m, respectively, were obtained. These agree reasonably with previous results from kinetic and thermodynamic data. The enhancement factors, et, of the PRR of the ternary complexes of adenylate kinase with the manganese complexes of a number of nucleoside triphosphates were determined. The order of et was found to be: MnATP (35) g Mn-2'-dATP (20) g MnGTP (8) g MnITP (5) g MnCTP (4) and MnUTP (4) at 24°. Also, a value of 8 for the ternary complex formed between adenylate kinase, manganous ion, and tripolyphosphate was obtained. A comparative kinetic study was carried out with these compounds with manganous ion as activator. For the purine nucleotides the order of maximum velocities was ATP g 2'-dATP g GTP g ITP. The correlation between et and the maximum velocities could be interpreted in part as indicative of some graded degree of conformational change induced in the protein by these substrates. This correlation could not be extended to the pyrimidine nucleotides, and tripolyphosphate did not give a measurable velocity. A temperature study of the variation of the PRR for the ternary complexes formed with adenylate kinase and MnATP2- and Mn-2'-dATP2- was carried out over the range 2–42°. The PRR increased with increasing temperature for both complexes, which is characteristic of a chemical exchange-dominated process."
https://openalex.org/W1639679922,"Abstract Partial hepatectomy in the rat is known to cause rises in the rates of incorporation by subcellular liver preparations of 3H-puromycin into nascent peptide and 14C-leucine into protein. The operation has also been shown to be followed by a rise in the rate of liver protein synthesis in vivo. The kinetics of the three rises after partial hepatectomy are the same, suggesting that the changes are interrelated. The effects of actinomycin D on the rises were studied. When the antibiotic (5 µg per hour) was given immediately after partial hepatectomy, it blocked the appearance of the rises in vitro and in vivo and, as a function of dose, affected the three changes in an indistinguishable manner. When actinomycin (10 µg per hour) was given to partially hepatectomized animals after the rises had occurred, the reactivities in vitro and in vivo were gradually reduced to the normal levels. The halfway points in the return to the normal levels were at 4 hours from the time of the first injection of the antibiotic."
https://openalex.org/W1485464478,"Various facets of the syntheses by human reticulocytes of the δ polypeptide chain found in hemoglobin A2 and the β polypeptide chain (βs) of hemoglobin S were compared. Although the quantity of δ chains is 0.03 that of βs chains in the mature erythrocytes of the individuals studied, the rate of synthesis of δ chains is 0.005 that of βs chains in reticulocytes. Thus, the rate of synthesis of δ chains declines earlier or faster than the rate of synthesis of βs chains during erythroid cell maturation. We calculate the time required to synthesize a δ polypeptide chain to be no greater than 4 times the assembly time of the βs chain. On the other hand, the estimated concentration of δ messenger RNA is 0.003 to 0.06 that of βs messenger RNA. Thus, a relative deficiency of δ messenger RNA may account entirely for the difference in synthesis rates of βs and δ polypeptide chains."
https://openalex.org/W1530336911,"The activity levels of thymidylate kinase and deoxycytidylate deaminase in Chang human liver cells in tissue culture were measured during a normal 5-day growth cycle. The activity of both enzymes showed considerable variations during different phases of growth, being high in rapidly proliferating and low in nonproliferating cultures. Data are presented which indicate that deoxycytidylate deaminase as well as thymidylate kinase is subject to feedback inhibition by deoxythymidine nucleotides. The activity levels of thymidylate kinase, deoxycytidylate deaminase, and deoxythymidine kinase were measured in cultures treated with various selective inhibitors of deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis. The inhibitors were used in concentrations which were sufficient to arrest cell multiplication. Treatment of the liver cells with amethopterin, mitomycin C, or high concentrations of deoxythymidine did not affect the activities of thymidylate kinase and deoxycytidylate deaminase. Hydroxyurea had no effect on the levels of these enzymes during the first 24 hours after addition, whereas after 48 hours the enzyme activities were considerably lower in the treated than in the untreated cultures. A marked increase in deoxythymidine kinase activity was observed in amethopterin-treated cultures, an effect which could be prevented by actinomycin D. The activity levels of kinases responsible for the phosphorylation of deoxyadenosine, deoxyguanosine, and deoxycytidine were not stimulated. Inhibition of growth by hydroxyurea was likewise associated with a strong increase in deoxythymidine kinase activity, an effect which was inversely related to the growth rate of the cell cultures. The hydroxyurea-induced rise in the kinase level could be prevented by puromycin and actinomycin D, but not by deoxynucleosides exogenously supplied. Deoxythymidine kinase activity was also found to increase when cell growth was inhibited by high concentrations of deoxythymidine, whereas treatment with mitomycin C did not affect the enzyme level."
https://openalex.org/W1659057644,"Abstract The structure of deer hemoglobin III, associated with sickling of the erythrocytes of Florida white tailed deer, is compared with that of deer hemoglobin V, the presence of which precludes sickling of erythrocytes under appropriate conditions, by peptide mapping and amino acid analysis techniques. Peptide mapping techniques, including combined specific color reactions, have been utilized to relate hemoglobin peptides in the deer hemoglobins to those of several species for which the amino acid sequence is known. Certain structural regions of the α and β polypeptide chains of deer hemoglobin are closely homologous to the corresponding regions in the α and β chains of these other species, as illustrated by a graph based upon the peptide mapping studies and known sequences. The tryptic peptide mapping pattern of the α chains of deer hemoglobins III and V is nearly identical with that of the sheep α chains from the three polymorphic sheep hemoglobins. In contrast to the similarity of the α chains of these two species, the β chains exhibited numerous inter- and intraspecies differences. However, the marked variations of the β chains among the polymorphic hemoglobins of the ruminants are largely confined to distinct regions of these β chains. Although the significance of a linear comparison of the homologous regions is not apparent, the relationship of these regions is clarified by use of a three-dimensional model."
https://openalex.org/W1534374174,"Abstract The complexes of defined oligoadenylic acids with polyuridylic acid have been investigated by observing their release from hydroxylapatite columns as a function of temperature. The temperature of release is a function of the chain length of the oligonucleotide, the presence of Mg++ ion, and the presence or absence of terminal phosphates on the oligonucleotide. This method provides a convenient way of characterizing the thermal stability of trace amounts or labeled oligonucleotide-polynucleotide complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1547149646,"Rat kidney mitochondria, in the presence of ATP, Pi, and magnesium ions, converted pyruvate and bicarbonate to malate, fumarate, and citrate and, in the presence of glutamate, also to aspartate. The addition of fluorocitrate strongly inhibited pyruvate utilization and 14CO2 incorporation into organic acids. The inhibition of 14CO2 incorporation into organic acids in the presence of fluorocitrate appeared to be caused by malonyl coenzyme A produced by fluorocitrate stimulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. This inhibition by fluorocitrate of 14CO2 incorporation was reversed by carnitine, acetylcarnitine, acylcarnitines, isocitrate, α-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, and glutamate, but not by citrate, β-hydroxybutyrate, or caprylate. The ratio of carnitine to fluorocitrate determined the degree of reversal of this inhibition. The reversal of inhibition by carnitine or acylcarnitine resulted in greatly increased citrate formation, with nearly all of the 14CO2 being incorporated into citrate, and in nearly complete inhibition of malate synthesis. Fluorocitrate inhibited oxidation of citrate. In the presence of tricarboxylic cycle intermediates, the incorporation of bicarbonate-14C into malate was greatly increased. With fluorocitrate in the system, the incorporation of radioactive bicarbonate into malate in the presence of α-ketoglutarate and succinate did not change, but decreased in the presence of fumarate."
https://openalex.org/W1508724119,"Abstract A dinitrophenyl derivative of human hemoglobin has been prepared and purified, in which the only site of reaction is the NH2 terminus of the α chain. Evidence for this comes from two sources: first, the identification of all of the tryptic peptides having absorption at 355 mµ; second, from experiments with 14C-labeled 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene which show that the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1 dinitrophenylgroup per αβ subunit. Competition experiments with iodoacetamide show that 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene does not react with the reactive sulfhydryl group on the β chain. This single substitution leads to quite drastic physical and functional changes. The modified hemoglobin has an increased oxygen affinity, an n value of 1 in the Hill equation, and no Bohr effect. In all dissociating solvents tested, the dinitrophenyl-hemoglobin is more highly associated than native hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1543619525,"Abstract This paper describes experiments designed to show the linkage of the two chains in the αβ dimer. The approach has been a kinetic one. If modification of one chain leads to conformational change in the other, this should be detectable as a difference in the reaction velocities of functional groups on the unsubstituted chain. We studied three derivatives of human hemoglobin; one was modified in the α chain and two in the β chain. Substitution at the NH2 terminus of the α chain with 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene leads to a total loss of cooperative interactions as judged by oxygenation parameters. In this derivative, the —SH group of cysteine 93β reacts more rapidly with N-ethylmaleimide than does the —SH group of unmodified hemoglobin. The effect of deoxygenation upon the reactivity of the 93β —SH is abolished. There is no change in the reactivity of cysteine 93β with iodoacetamide or 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). The COOH termini of the α and β chains of the dinitrophenyl-carbonmonoxyhemoglobin are digested more slowly with carboxypeptidase B and A, respectively. When the primary substitution is made on the β chain at cysteine 93, the effects upon the α chain are less marked and depend on the substituent: N-ethylmaleimide has more potent effects than iodoacetamide. The N-ethylmaleimide derivative has a partial loss of cooperative interactions, as determined by oxygenation properties, while the iodoacetamide derivative shows normal oxygen binding except for an increased oxygen affinity. N-ethylmaleimide substitution at —SH 93β allows faster digestion of the α chain COOH terminus, but alkylation with iodoacetamide has no effect. Neither modification alters the reactivity of the NH2 terminus of the α chain to 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. Intrachain effects are produced by both substituents: substitution with N-ethylmaleimide slows and with iodoacetamide speeds the digestion of the β chain by carboxypeptidase A. Since modification of either chain of the dimer changes the reactivity of widely separated groups, a general conformational change must occur. The degree of change in the kinetics of the groups tested correlates with the degree of disruption of functional properties. These experiments show the close interaction of the two chains in the αβ dimer and are further evidence that the αβ dimer is the fundamental unit of both structure and function."

https://openalex.org/W1504954359,"Native and iodinated thyroglobulin and human serum albumin were allowed to react with N-acetyl imidazole under mild conditions, and the degree of O-acetylation of protein tyrosyl and iodotyrosyl residues was estimated by spectrophotometric titration. In both proteins, almost all of the diiodotyrosyl residues, whether formed in vitro or in vivo, react with N-acetyl imidazole. In contrast, more than half of the monoiodotyrosyl residues are unreactive. The increase in the thyroxine to triiodothyronine ratio in thyroglobulin with increasing iodine content can be explained by the rapid increase in the diiodotyrosine to monoiodotyrosine ratio that occurs above a few tenths per cent iodine, and by the greater reactivity of the diiodotyrosyl residues."
https://openalex.org/W1614736976,"Abstract An enzyme, phosphoramidate-ADP phosphotransferase, has been isolated from dried bakers' yeast. We have previously shown that phosphoramide, N-phosphorylglycine, and N-phosphohistidine can act as phosphate donors. Phosphoiodohistidine was shown also to function as a phosphate donor and the enzyme was stereospecific for the l form of this compound. The following compounds acted as phosphate acceptors in this system in decreasing order of activity: ADP, dADP, GDP, CDP, TDP, dCDP, TDP, UDP. When phosphoramide was used as a donor, the pH maximum was 7.0 to 7.2. When phosphoiodohistidine was used as the donor, a double pH maximum with peaks at 6.9 and 7.8 was noted. The Arrhenius energy of activation was determined to be 12.2 kcal per mole. Apparent Km values were 1.15 x 10-4 m for ADP and 1.39 x 10-4 m for phosphoramide. Mg++ ions were not required and were found to be inhibitory with either phosphoiodohistidine or phosphoramide as the donor. A wide variety of other possible inhibitors was checked. Compounds which affect sulfhydryl groups on enzymes were shown to inhibit this enzyme. Known inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation, oligomycin and sodium azide, were also shown to inhibit enzymatic activity. However 2,4-dinitrophenol had no effect. With the use of 32P-labeled phosphoramide, an enzyme-32P-protein was isolated by diethylaminoethyl cellulose chromatography. This intermediate was capable of transfering labeled phosphate to ADP to form AT32P."
