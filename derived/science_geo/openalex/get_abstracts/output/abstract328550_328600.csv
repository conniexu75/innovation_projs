https://openalex.org/W2078750907,"The year 1970 has been suggested as a starting date for the ""third age of quantum chemistry,"" in which theory takes on not only qualitative but also quantitative value. In fact, each of the years 1960, 1970, 1972, and 1977 is of historical value in the unraveling of the structure and energetics of the CH(2) molecule, methylene. What took place for methylene, namely the establishment of credibility for theory, has subsequently taken place for many other molecules. Three important roles for quantitative theory are outlined: (i) theory precedes experiment; (ii) theory overturns experiment, as resolved by later experiments; and (iii) theory and experiment work together to gain insight that is afforded independently to neither. Several examples from each of the three classes are given."

The highest concentrations of dissolved gaseous mercury occurred in cooler, nutrient-rich waters that characterize equatorial upwelling and increased biological productivity at the sea surface. The surface waters were supersaturated with respect to elemental mercury; a significant flux of elemental mercury to the atmosphere is predicted for the equatorial Pacific. When normalized to primary production on a global basis, the ocean effluxes of mercury may rival anthropogenic emissions of mercury to the atmosphere."

They are widely used as ion exchangers and sorbents and in hydrocarbons conversion catalysis and separations. Recent zeolite research has focused on widening the scope of synthetic procedures, on further exploiting zeolites in commercial processes, and on applying modern characterization techniques to unraveling the complexities of zeolite structural properties."
https://openalex.org/W2059818368,"Coarse and fine suspended particulate organic materials and dissolved humic and fulvic acids transported by the Amazon River all contain bomb-produced carbon-14, indicating relatively rapid turnover of the parent carbon pools. However, the carbon-14 contents of these coexisting carbon forms are measurably different and may reflect varying degrees of retention by soils in the drainage basin."
https://openalex.org/W2013042947,"Large changes in the concentration of sulfide around a hydrothermal vent in the Gal√°pagos Rift provide direct evidence for the consumption of sulfide by the organisms of the vent community. These changes were detected with a new chemical analyzer capable of measuring silicate, sulfide, oxygen, and temperature on the sea floor at depths of 2500 meters. More than 10,000 measurements showed systematic variations in the sulfide and oxygen concentrations due to biogenic oxidation of sulfide in the hydrothermal solutions. Silicate concentration was highly correlated with temperature, but different trends were observed at different locations."
https://openalex.org/W2027061816,"Glycerol-derived membrane lipids are essentially absent in the thermophilic bacterium Thermomicrobium roseum. A series of straight chain and internally methyl-branched 1,2-diols of carbon numbers C(18) to C(23) were found to replace glycerolipids in this bacterium. Fatty acids were present but were ester-linked to the diols or amide-linked to polar heads groups and not to glycerol. This thermophile has evolved the integration of diols as a novel approach for the construction of its cytoplasmic membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2080530612,"X-ray diffraction studies have been carried out on alkali halide samples 10 micrometers in diameter (volume 10(-9) cubic centimeter) subjected to megabar pressures in the diamond anvil cell. Energy-dispersive techniques and a synchrotron source were used. These measurements can be used to detect crystallographic phase transitions. Cesium iodide was subjected to pressures of 95 gigapascals (fractional volume of 46 percent) and rubidium iodide to pressures of 89 gigapascals (fractional volume of 39 percent). Cesium iodide showed a transformation from the cubic B2 phase (cesium chloride structure) to a tetragonal phase and then to an orthorhombic phase, which was stable to 95 gigapascals. Rubidium iodide showed only a transition from the low-pressure cubic B1 phase (sodium chloride structure) to the B2 phase, which was stable up to 89 gigapascals."
