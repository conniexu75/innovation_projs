https://openalex.org/W1641544182,"Gene duplication is an important source of evolutionary novelty. Most duplications are of just a single gene, but Ohno proposed that whole-genome duplication (polyploidy) is an important evolutionary mechanism. Many duplicate genes have been found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and these often seem to be phenotypically redundant. Here we show that the arrangement of duplicated genes in the S. cerevisiae genome is consistent with Ohno's hypothesis. We propose a model in which this species is a degenerate tetraploid resulting from a whole-genome duplication that occurred after the divergence of Saccharomyces from Kluyveromyces. Only a small fraction of the genes were subsequently retained in duplicate (most were deleted), and gene order was rearranged by many reciprocal translocations between chromosomes. Protein pairs derived from this duplication event make up 13% of all yeast proteins, and include pairs of transcription factors, protein kinases, myosins, cyclins and pheromones. Tetraploidy may have facilitated the evolution of anaerobic fermentation in Saccharomyces."
https://openalex.org/W1613446635,"The functionally conserved proteins CBP and p300 act in conjunction with other factors to activate transcription of DNA. A new factor, p/CIP, has been discovered that is present in the cell as a complex with CBP and is required for transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors and other CBP/p300-dependent transcription factors. The highly related nuclear-receptor co-activator protein NCoA-1 is also specifically required for ligand-dependent activation of genes by nuclear receptors. p/CIP, NCoA-1 and CBP all contain related leucine-rich charged helical interaction motifs that are required for receptor-specific mechanisms of gene activation, and allow the selective inhibition of distinct signal-transduction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1566245339,"Most mutations are likely to be deleterious, and so the spontaneous mutation rate is generally held at a very low value1. Nonetheless, evolutionary theory predicts that high mutation rates can evolve under certain circumstances2,3,4. Empirical observations have previously been limited to short-term studies of the fates of mutator strains deliberately introduced into laboratory populations of Escherichia coli5,6,7, and to the effects of intense selective events on mutator frequencies in E. coli8. Here we report the rise of spontaneously originated mutators in populations of E. coli undergoing long-term adaptation to a new environment. Our results corroborate computer simulations of mutator evolution in adapting clonal populations4, and may help to explain observations that associate high mutation rates with emerging pathogens9 and with certain cancers10."
https://openalex.org/W1565881767,"The adenovirus E1A and SV40 large-T-antigen oncoproteins bind to members of the p300/CBP transcriptional coactivator family. Binding of p300/CBP is implicated in the transforming mechanisms of E1A and T-antigen oncoproteins. A common region of the T antigen is critical for binding both p300/CBP and the tumour suppressor p53 (ref. 1), suggesting a link between the functions of p53 and p300. Here we report that p300/CBP binds to p53 in the absence of viral oncoproteins, and that p300 and p53 colocalize within the nucleus and coexist in a stable DNA-binding complex. Consistent with its ability to bind to p300, E1A disrupted functions mediated by p53. It reduced p53-mediated activation of the p21 and bax promoters, and suppressed p53-induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. We conclude that members of the p300/CBP family are transcriptional adaptors for p53, modulating its checkpoint function in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and its induction of apoptosis. Disruption of p300/p53-dependent growth control may be part of the mechanism by which E1A induces cell transformation. These results help to explain how p53 mediates growth and checkpoint control, and how members of the p300/CBP family affect progression from G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1550165896,"Because most newly arising mutations are neutral or deleterious, it has been argued that the mutation rate has evolved to be as low as possible, limited only by the cost of error-avoidance and error-correction mechanisms. But up to one per cent of natural bacterial isolates are 'mutator' clones that have high mutation rates. We consider here whether high mutation rates might play an important role in adaptive evolution. Models of large, asexual, clonal populations adapting to a new environment show that strong mutator genes (such as those that increase mutation rates by 1,000-fold) can accelerate adaptation, even if the mutator gene remains at a very low frequency (for example, 10[-5]). Less potent mutators (10 to 100-fold increase) can become fixed in a fraction of finite populations. The parameters of the model have been set to values typical for Escherichia coli cultures, which behave in a manner similar to the model in long-term adaptation experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1758367192,"Turner's syndrome is a sporadic disorder of human females in which all or part of one X chromosome is deleted. Intelligence is usually normal but social adjustment problems are common. Here we report a study of 80 females with Turner's syndrome and a single X chromosome, in 55 of which the X was maternally derived (45,X[m]) and in 25 it was of paternal origin (45,X[p]). Members of the 45,X[p] group were significantly better adjusted, with superior verbal and higher-order executive function skills, which mediate social interactions. Our observations suggest that there is a genetic locus for social cognition, which is imprinted and is not expressed from the maternally derived X chromosome. Neuropsychological and molecular investigations of eight females with partial deletions of the short arm of the X chromosome indicate that the putative imprinted locus escapes X-inactivation, and probably lies on Xq or close to the centromere on Xp. If expressed only from the X chromosome of paternal origin, the existence of this locus could explain why 46,XY males (whose single X chromosome is maternal) are more vulnerable to developmental disorders of language and social cognition, such as autism, than are 46,XX females."
https://openalex.org/W1548972556,"The tumour suppressor p53 is a transcriptional regulator whose ability to inhibit cell growth is dependent upon its transactivation function1,2,3. Here we demonstrate that the transcription factor CBP, which is also implicated in cell proliferation and differentiation4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14, acts as a p53 coactivator and potentiates its transcriptional activity. The amino-terminal activation domain of p53 interacts with the carboxy-terminal portion of the CBP protein both in vitro and in vivo. In transfected SaoS-2 cells, CBP potentiates activation of the mdm-2 gene by p53 and, reciprocally, p53 potentiates activation of a Gal4-responsive target gene by a Gal4(1–147)–CBP(1678–2441) fusion protein. A double point mutation that destroys the transactivation function of p53 also abolishes its binding to CBP and its synergistic function with CBP. The ability of p53 to interact physically and functionally with a co-activator (CBP) that has histone acetyltransferase activity15,16 and with components (TAFs)17,18 of the general transcription machinery indicates that it may have different functions in a multistep activation pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2166982025,"Dendritic cells form a system of highly efficient antigen-presenting cells. After capturing antigen in the periphery, they migrate to lymphoid organs where they present the antigen to T cells. Their seemingly unique ability to interact with and sensitize naive T cells gives dendritic cells a central role in the initiation of immune responses and allows them to be used in therapeutic strategies against cancer, viral infection and other diseases. How they interact preferentially with naive rather than activated T lymphocytes is still poorly understood. Chemokines direct the transport of white blood cells in immune surveillance. Here we report the identification and characterization of a C-C chemokine (DC-CK1) that is specifically expressed by human dendritic cells at high levels. Tissue distribution analysis demonstrates that dendritic cells present in germinal centres and T-cell areas of secondary lymphoid organs express this chemokine. We show that DC-CK1, in contrast to RANTES, MIP-1alpha and interleukin-8, preferentially attracts naive T cells (CD45RA+). The specific expression of DC-CK1 by dendritic cells at the site of initiation of an immune response, combined with its chemotactic activity for naive T cells, suggests that DC-CK1 has an important rule in the induction of immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W1647404354,"The actin cytoskeleton is regulated by GTP-hydrolysing proteins, the Rho GTPases, which act as molecular switches in diverse signal-transduction processes. Various bacterial toxins can inactivate Rho GTPases by ADP-ribosylation or glucosylation. Previous research has identified Rho proteins as putative targets for Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factors 1 and 2 (CNF1 and 2). These toxins induce actin assembly and multinucleation in culture cells. Here we show that treatment of RhoA with CNF1 inhibits the intrinsic GTPase activity of RhoA and completely blocks GTPase activity stimulated by the Rho-GTPase-activating protein (rhoGAP). Analysis by mass spectrometry and amino-acid sequencing of proteolytic peptides derived from CNF1-treated RhoA indicate that CNF1 induces deamidation of a glutamine residue at position 63 (Gln 63) to give constitutively active Rho protein."
https://openalex.org/W1495826882,"Pathogenic Escherichia coli are responsible for a variety of diseases, including diarrhoea, haemolytic uraemic syndrome, kidney infection, septicaemia, pneumonia and meningitis. Toxins called cytotoxic necrotizing factors (CNFs) are among the virulence factors produced by uropathogenic (CNF1) or enteropathogenic (CNF2) E. coli strains that cause diseases in humans and animals, respectively. CNFs induce an increase in the content of actin stress fibres and focal contacts in cultured cells. Effects of CNFs on the actin cytoskeleton correlated with a decrease in the electrophoretic mobility of the GTP-binding protein Rho and indirect evidence indicates that CNF1 might constitutively activate Rho. Here we show that CNF1 catalyses the deamidation of a glutamine residue at position 63 of Rho, turning it into glutamic acid, which inhibits both intrinsic GTP hydrolysis and that stimulated by its GTPase-activating protein (GAP). Thus, this deamidation of glutamine 63 by CNF1 leads to the constitutive activation of Rho, and induces the reorganization of actin stress fibres. To our knowledge, CNF1 is the first example of a bacterial toxin acting by deamidation of a specific target protein."
https://openalex.org/W2338151994,"The biosynthesis of penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics in microorganisms requires the formation of the bicyclic nucleus of penicillin. Isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS), a non-haem iron-dependent oxidase, catalyses the reaction of a tripeptide, delta-(L-alpha-aminoadipoyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine (ACV), and dioxygen to form isopenicillin N and two water molecules. Mechanistic studies suggest the reaction is initiated by ligation of the substrate thiolate to the iron centre, and proceeds through an enzyme-bound monocyclic intermediate. Here we report the crystal structure of IPNS complexed to ferrous iron and ACV, determined to 1.3 A resolution. Based on the structure, we propose a mechanism for penicillin formation that involves ligation of ACV to the iron centre, creating a vacant iron coordination site into which dioxygen can bind. Subsequently, iron-dioxygen and iron-oxo species remove the requisite hydrogens from ACV without the direct assistance of protein residues. The crystal structure of the complex with the dioxygen analogue, NO and ACV bound to the active-site iron supports this hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W1511501308,"The Rab family of low-molecular-mass GTP-binding proteins are thought to guide membrane fusion between a transport vesicle and the target membrane, and to determine the specificity of docking. The docking and fusion of vesicles is, however, a complex multistep reaction, and the precise point at which Rab proteins act in these sequential processes is unknown. In brain, the Rab protein Rab3A is specific to synaptic vesicles, whose exocytosis can be monitored with submillisecond resolution by following synaptic transmission. We have now determined the precise point at which Rab3A acts in the sequence of synaptic vesicle docking and fusion by using electrophysiological analysis of neurotransmitter release in Rab3A-deficient mice. Unexpectedly, the size of the readily releasable pool of vesicles is normal, whereas Ca2+-triggered fusion is altered in the absence of Rab3A in that a more-than-usual number of exocytic events occur within a brief time after arrival of the nerve impulse."
https://openalex.org/W2134951983,"It is commonly assumed that certain features are so elementary to the visual system that they require no attentional resources to be perceived. Such ‘preattentive’ features are traditionally identified by visual search performance1,2,3, in which the reaction time for detecting a feature difference against a set of distractor items does not increase with the number of distractors. This suggests an unlimited capacity for the perception of such features. We provide evidence to the contrary, demonstrating that detection of differences in a simple feature such as orientation is severely impaired by additionally imposing an attentionally demanding rapid serial visual presentation task involving letter identification. The same visual stimuli exhibit non-increasing reaction time versus set-size functions. These results demonstrate that attention can be critical even for the detection of so-called ‘preattentive’ features."
https://openalex.org/W1578346366,"Glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neurturin (NTN) are two structurally related, potent survival factors for sympathetic, sensory and central nervous system neurons. GDNF mediates its actions through a multicomponent receptor system composed of a ligand-binding glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked protein (designated GDNFR-alpha) and the transmembrane protein tyrosine kinase Ret. In contrast, the mechanism by which the NTN signal is transmitted is not well understood. Here we describe the identification and tissue distribution of a GPI-linked protein (designated NTNR-alpha) that is structurally related to GDNFR-alpha. We further demonstrate that NTNR-alpha binds NTN (K[d] approximately 10 pM) but not GDNF with high affinity; that GDNFR-alpha binds to GDNF but not NTN with high affinity; and that cellular responses to NTN require the presence of NTNR-alpha. Finally, we show that NTN, in the presence of NTNR-alpha, induces tyrosine-phosphorylation of Ret, and that NTN, NTNR-alpha and Ret form a physical complex on the cell surface. These findings identify Ret and NTNR-alpha as signalling and ligand-binding components, respectively, of a receptor for NTN and define a novel family of receptors for neurotrophic and differentiation factors composed of a shared transmembrane protein tyrosine kinase and a ligand-specific GPI-linked protein."
https://openalex.org/W2048968441,"The goal of this study was to compare single channel water and glycerol permeabilities of mammalian aquaporins (AQP) 1–5 and the major intrinsic protein of lens fiber (MIP). Each of the six cloned cDNAs from rat was left untagged or was epitope-tagged with c-Myc or FLAG at either the N or C terminus so that results would not depend on epitope identity or location. The constructs were expressed in Xenopus oocytes for measurement of osmotic water permeability (P f ), [3H]glycerol uptake, and protein expression. Each of the 30 epitope-tagged constructs was expressed strongly at the oocyte plasma membrane. The 10-min uptake of [3H]glycerol was increased significantly (range of 4.5–8-fold over control) in oocytes expressing untagged AQP3 (GLIP) and each of the four tagged AQP3 constructs; [3H]glycerol uptake was not increased in oocytes expressing AQP1, AQP2, AQP4, AQP5, or MIP. In oocytes microinjected with 5 ng of cRNA, average P f values (in cm/s × 10−3) were 0.67 ± 0.06 (control), 19 ± 2 (AQP1), 10 ± 1 (AQP2), 8 ± 2 (AQP3), 29 ± 1 (AQP4), 10 ± 1 (AQP5), and 1.3 ± 0.2 (MIP), and they were relatively insensitive to the presence, identity, or location of the epitope tag. P f values were not affected by protein kinase A or C activation. After normalization for plasma membrane expression by immunoprecipitation of microdissected plasma membranes, single channel water permeabilities (p f, referenced to the AQP1 p f of 6 × 10−14cm3/s) were (in cm3/s × 10−14) 3.3 ± 0.2 (AQP2), 2.1 ± 0.3 (AQP3), 24 ± 0.6 (AQP4), 5.0 ± 0.4 (AQP5), and 0.25 ± 0.05 (MIP); p f values were insensitive to epitope identity and location. These results indicate very different intrinsic water permeabilities for the mammalian aquaporin homologs, with thep f value for AQP4 remarkably higher than those for the others. The p f values establish limits on aquaporin tissue densities required for physiological function and suggest significant structural and functional differences among the aquaporins.

In the case of AQP1, where purification to homogeneity has been possible, measurement of “per channel” or “single channel” water permeability (p f ) indicates that each AQP1 monomer has a relatively lowp f of ∼6 × 10−14cm3/s (27Van Hoek A.N.

This relatively low p f requires the presence of very high densities of AQP1 water channels in membranes (>103/μm2, compared with generally <1 ion channel/μm2) to confer significantly increased water permeability. No information is available aboutp f for the other aquaporins because purification and reconstitution have not been accomplished. Most studies of aquaporin function have concluded that AQP1, AQP2, AQP4, and AQP5 are selective for transport of water without passage of ions, protons, urea, and glycerol, whereas Abrami et al.

Physiol. 1995; 430: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) reported that AQP1 may transport small polar non-electrolytes in addition to water. It is difficult to compare these investigations because the levels of protein expression at the plasma membrane have not been quantified. The principal goal of this study was to determine quantitatively the single channel water and glycerol permeabilities of mammalian AQP1–5 and MIP. A second goal was to examine whether activators of protein kinases A and C regulate the water permeabilities of these proteins, a controversial issue that has received recent attention (see “Discussion”). Our strategy was to utilize epitope tagging to detect oocyte plasma membrane expression of each protein with similar efficiencies. Single channel water permeabilities were determined from ratios of measured oocyte permeabilities to plasma membrane expression levels. The principal findings were that significant glycerol permeability was found only for AQP3 and that single channel water permeabilities differed widely for the aquaporins. Phosphorylation by protein kinase A or C did not affect MIP- or aquaporin-mediated water permeability. The considerable heterogeneity in water channel function of the aquaporin family proteins was an unexpected finding with interesting implications for water channel structure and physiology. Full-length cDNAs encoding rat AQP1–5 and MIP, without and with epitope tags, were subcloned into oocyte expression plasmid S65T (which contains an upstreamXenopus α-globin enhancer sequence) (18Zhang R. Skach W. Hasegawa H. Van Hoek A.N. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The epitope-tagged constructs encoded fusion proteins consisting of each full-length aquaporin with 10 amino acids of the human c-Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL, nucleotides GAACAAAAGCTGATTTCTGAAGAAGACCTG) (30Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar) or 8 amino acids of the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK, nucleotides GACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAG) (31Chubet R.G. Brizzard B.L. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) at either the N or C terminus. Tagged AQP4 cDNAs were first prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplification using the following primers (engineered BglII and EcoRI restriction sites are underlined): 5′-c-Myc/AQP4 sense, 5′-GAAGATCTAGCATGGAACAAAAGCTGATTTCTGAAGAAGACCTGGGATCCATGGTGGCTTTCAAAGGCGTCTGGACTCAAGC; 5′-FLAG/AQP4 sense, 5′-GAAGATCTAGCATGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAGGGATCCATGGTGGCTTTCAAAGGCGTCTGGACTCAAGC; 3′-TAA/AQP4 antisense, 5′-GGAATTCTTATCTAGATACAGAAGATAATACCTCTCCA; 3′-c-Myc/AQP4 antisense, 5′-GGAATTCTTACAGGTCTTCTTCAGAAATCAGCTTTTGTTCTCTAGAGGATCCCACACTCTCCATCTCCACGGCTCCC; and 3′-FLAG/AQP4 antisense, 5′-GGAATTCTTACTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCTCTAGAGGATCCCACACTCTCCATCTCCACGGCTCCC. Polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned into plasmid S65T at BglII and EcoRI sites. The plasmids (pSP64T-N-c-Myc, pSP64T-C-c-Myc, pSP64T-N-FLAG, and pSP64T-C-FLAG) not containing AQP4 were isolated by restriction digestion withBamHI or BglII and XbaI and used for subcloning of cDNAs encoding the other aquaporins (see below). Full-length cDNAs encoding AQP1–3, AQP5, and MIP were polymerase chain reaction-amplified using the following primers (engineeredBamHI, BglII, or BclI andXbaI restriction sites are underlined): AQP1 sense, 5′-CGGGATCCATGGCCAGCGAGTTAAAGAAGA-3′ AQP1 antisense, 5′-GCTCTAGATTTGGGCTTCATCTCCACCCTG-3′ AQP2 sense, 5′-CGAGATCTATGTGGGAACTCAGATCCATAG-3′ AQP2 antisense, 5′-GCTCTAGAGGCCTTGCTGCCGCGAGGCAGG-3′ AQP3 sense, 5′-CGGGATCCATGAACCGTTGCGGGGAGATGC-3′ AQP3 antisense, 5′-GCTCTAGAGATCTGCTCCTTGTGCTTCATG-3′ AQP5 sense, 5′-CGGGATCCATGAAAAAGGAGGTGTGCTCCCTTG-3′ AQP5 antisense, 5′-GCTCTAGAGTGTGCCGTCAGCTCGATGGTC-3′ MIP sense, 5′-CTTGATCAATGTGGGAACTTCGGTCTGCCTCCT-3′ and MIP antisense, 5′-GCTCTAGACAATGTCTGAATTCCATTGAT-3′. Templates were cDNAs prepared from rat kidney (AQP1–3), brain (AQP4), lung (AQP5), or lens (MIP). Each of the cDNAs contains engineeredBglII, BamHI, or BclI andXbaI restriction sites for insertion into the tagged vectors described above. Complementary RNA was transcribedin vitro using SP6 polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 5 μg of plasmid DNA in a 100-μl volume at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence of diguanosine triphosphate (1 A 250unit; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Plasmid DNA was digested with RNase-free DNase (Invitrogen), extracted with phenol/chloroform, and precipitated twice in ethanol. The cRNA was suspended in distilled water for oocyte injection. In vitro transcribed cRNA was added to a rabbit reticulocyte lysate mixture containing [35S]methionine (32Skach W. Shi L.-B. Calayag M.C. Frigeri A. Lingappa V.R. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 803-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Microsomes prepared from dog pancreas were added in some experiments at the start of translation to a final concentration of 8 A 280 units. Translation was performed at 24 °C for 1 h. Samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, EN3HANCE fluorography, and autoradiography. Stage V and VI oocytes from Xenopus laevis were isolated and defolliculated with collagenase (type IA, Sigma; 1 mg/ml for 2–4 h at 20 °C) in Barth's buffer (200 mosm). Oocytes were microinjected with 50-nl samples of cRNA (0–200 ng/μl) and incubated at 18 °C for 24–27 h. Osmotic water permeability (P f ) was measured from the time course of oocyte swelling at 10 °C in response to a 1.5- or 5-fold dilution of the extracellular Barth's buffer with distilled water (33Zhang R. Logee K. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15375-15378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oocyte P f was calculated from the initial rate of swelling (d(V/V o )/dt) by the relationP f = (d(V/V o )/dt)/((S/V o )V w (osmout− osmin)), where S/V o = 50 cm−1, V w = 18 cm3/mol, and osmout − osmin = 190 mosm. In some experiments, oocytes were incubated with forskolin or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 15–30 min at room temperature prior to water permeability measurements. Uptake of [3H]glycerol (200 mCi/mmol) was carried out as described previously (5Ma T. Frigeri A. Hasegawa H. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21845-21849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Groups of 10 oocytes were incubated in 200 μl of Barth's buffer containing 20 μCi of the radiolabeled glycerol (nonradioactive glycerol was added to give a 1 mmfinal concentration) at room temperature. After 0 or 10 min, oocytes were washed rapidly three times in ice-cold Barth's buffer, and individual oocytes were dissolved in 5% SDS for scintillation counting. Results are reported as percentage uptake assuming an oocyte aqueous volume of 0.25 μl, after subtraction of the 0 time contribution from surface binding (generally <5%). Metabolic labeling was performed by incubating groups of 10 oocytes for 24 h at 18 °C in 100 μl of Barth's buffer containing 50 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Corp.). Oocytes were gently washed three times in ice-cold Barth's buffer, and plasma membrane complexes were peeled from the surface of the oocytes with fine forceps and collected. Membranes were disrupted in 1 ml of homogenization buffer (7.5 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) by vigorous vortexing and repeated pipetting. Cellular debris was pelleted at 750 × g for 5 min, and the membranes were then pelleted at 16,000 × g for 30 min. Membrane pellets were solubilized in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm β-octyl glucoside for 1 h and incubated with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 1 h at 4 °C with continuous rocking. The beads were pelleted at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was incubated with primary antibody (1:300) for 1 h and then with a rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody for 1 h. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads were added, pelleted, and washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate, and 1% Triton X-100. The proteins were released from the beads in 30 μl of SDS loading buffer and resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were soaked in 15% (w/v) 2,5-diphenyloxazole in Me2SO for 30 min, dried, and exposed to Hyperfilm (Amersham Corp.) at −70 °C for 3–10 days. Groups of 10–20 oocytes were immersed in fixation solution (4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 m sucrose) for 4 h. Oocytes were cryoprotected overnight in phosphate-buffered saline containing 30% sucrose, embedded in ornithine carbamoyltransferase compound, and frozen in dry ice/ethanol. Sections (∼6-μm thickness) were stained with c-Myc or FLAG antibody (1:500) for 1 h and with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:50; Boehringer Mannheim) for 30 min as described previously (34Shi L. Skach W. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10417-10422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding rat AQP1–5 and MIP were epitope-tagged at the N or C terminus with the c-Myc or FLAG sequence, and the untagged and tagged constructs were subcloned into an oocyte expression vector. The constructs were confirmed by sequence analysis and characterized initially by cell-free translation. Fig. 1 shows representative cell-free translation results for the C-terminal c-Myc (A) and FLAG (B) epitope-tagged constructs. Each construct was translated efficiently. Protein sizes were as expected from prior translation and immunoblot studies after correction for the small c-Myc (1.2 kDa) or FLAG (1.0 kDa) epitope. As found previously, AQP1–3 and AQP5 were partially glycosylated, whereas AQP4 and MIP were not. Similar cell-free translation profiles were obtained for the N-terminal tagged constructs and after immunoprecipitation of each of the 24 tagged cDNAs with c-Myc or FLAG antibody (data not shown). Functional measurements were made in Xenopus oocytes after microinjection of 5 ng of each cRNA and a 24–27-h incubation at 18 °C. All 24 epitope-tagged constructs and the six untagged constructs were tested. Fig. 2 A shows representative measurements of osmotic water permeability by oocyte swelling, and Fig. 2 B summarizes averaged results. For each of the constructs tested, a consistent rank order of water permeabilities was found, with P f for AQP4 > AQP1 > AQP5 > AQP2 ∼ AQP3 ≫ MIP. The water permeability of MIP-expressing oocytes was small, but was significantly greater than that of control (water-injected) oocytes. The water permeability values were relatively insensitive to the presence, location, and identity of the epitope tag (see below). For an equal quantity of injected cRNA, AQP4-expressing oocytes had the greatest water permeability; however, these results cannot be interpreted in terms of intrinsic water permeability per aquaporin monomer because of possible differences in expression among the various proteins. Fig. 3 shows a summary of 10-min glycerol uptake measurements in oocytes from the same groups used for the water transport measurements. Glycerol uptake was remarkably increased compared with control in oocytes expressing untagged AQP3 as well as each of the four tagged AQP3 constructs. Glycerol uptake was not increased significantly above control in oocytes expressing AQP1, AQP2, AQP4, AQP5, or MIP. Experiments were next carried out to determine the protein expression levels of AQP1–5 and MIP in Xenopus oocytes microinjected with 5 ng of each cRNA. Several complementary approaches were used, including immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblot analysis. Fig. 4 shows representative immunofluorescence data for oocytes expressing the C-terminal c-Myc epitope. Immunofluorescence in oocytes expressing each of the tagged proteins was clearly above control, with qualitatively the greatest expression of AQP1 and the least expression of AQP4. However, the staining efficiency and specificity of the monoclonal antibodies were inferior to polyclonal AQP1 and AQP4 antibodies used previously for measurement of plasma membrane aquaporin expression (34Shi L. Skach W. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10417-10422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were not suitable for quantitative analysis. Quantitative analysis of aquaporin plasma membrane expression was accomplished by inclusion of [35S]methionine in the incubation solution followed by oocyte plasma membrane microdissection and immunoprecipitation. Fig. 5 shows autoradiograms of immunoprecipitated proteins labeled with each of the epitopes (c-Myc or FLAG) at their C or N termini. The relative expression levels of AQP1–5 and MIP were in qualitative agreement with the data in Fig. 4, with strong expression of AQP1 and the least expression of AQP4. Below each lane is given the averaged P f values measured in the same oocytes that were blotted. These values are needed to compute single channel water permeabilities (see below). Control measurements were carried out to confirm the suitability and linearity of the immunoprecipitation method. Oocytes were microinjected with different amounts (0–10 ng) of cRNA encoding AQP1 tagged at its N terminus with the c-Myc epitope. P f was measured by the swelling assay, and plasma membrane expression was measured by densitometry of autoradiograms of immunoprecipitated protein. The AQP1 protein was immunoprecipitated with AQP1 antibody or c-Myc antibody. Fig. 6 A shows a representative autoradiogram of the immunoprecipitated proteins with different amounts of microinjected cRNA. Fig. 6 B shows a comparison of oocyteP p versus the amount of immunoprecipitated protein (by densitometry of autoradiograms). There was a nearly linear relationship between plasma membrane water permeability and relative amount of 35S-labeled AQP1 in immunoprecipitations performed with the AQP1 and c-Myc antibodies. They intercept of the line was just above zero because of the non-zero base-line water permeability of control oocytes. The strategy to determine single channel water permeabilities (p f, in units of cm3/s) involves taking ratios of oocyte P f to integrated band intensity and normalizing the ratios to that for untagged AQP1, which has a knownp f (AQP1) of 6 × 10−14cm3/s (27Van Hoek A.N. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18267-18269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), pf(AQPx)tagy=pf(AQP1)PAQP1tagy/IBAQP1tagy(Ab AQP1)PAQP1no tag/IBAQP1no tag(Ab AQP1)× PAQPxtagy/IBAQPxtagy(Aby)PAQP1tagy/IBAQP1tagy(Aby)Equation 1 wherep f (AQP x )tag y is the single channel water permeability (cm3/s) of AQPx with tag y (y is N- or C-terminal c-Myc or FLAG),P f (AQP x )tag y is the water permeability (cm/s) of oocytes expressing AQPxwith tag y, and IBAQP x tag y (Ab z) is the integrated band intensity (arbitrary units) of immunoprecipitated proteins from oocytes expressing AQPxwith tag y using antibody z. The normalization is done in two steps. The first bracketed term in Equation 1 compares water permeabilities of untagged AQP1 to those of each of the four tagged AQP1 constructs. (AQP1 antibody is used because untagged AQP1 cannot be immunoprecipitated with c-Myc or FLAG antibody.) The second bracketed term compares water permeabilities of AQPx with tag y to that of AQP1 with tag y. (Immunoprecipitations were done with antibody y). Fig. 7 A shows an autoradiogram of the AQP1 proteins immunoprecipitated with AQP1 antibody along with corresponding measured P f values. Fig. 7 B summarizes the deduced p f values referenced to that for untagged AQP1. The values did not differ significantly among the AQP1 constructs; the first bracketed term in Equation 1 will thus be taken as unity. Fig. 8 A summarizes the single channel water permeabilities of each of the four tagged constructs (N- or C- terminal c-Myc or FLAG) of AQP1–5 and MIP. The p f values were computed using Equation 1, in which the second bracketed term was deduced from experiments as in Fig. 5. The results show a considerable variation in p f values among the aquaporins (see “Discussion”). Notably, p f for each of the proteins was relatively insensitive to the identity and location of the epitope tag. To investigate whether the intrinsic water permeabilities of AQP1–5 and MIP are regulated by phosphorylation, effects of activators of protein kinases A and C were studied (Fig. 8). Utilizing activators and incubation conditions that have been established to effectively phosphorylate proteins in oocytes (35Hasegawa H. Skach W. Baker O. Calayag M.C. Lingappa V. Verkman A.S. Science. 1992; 258: 1477-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), the protein kinase activators did not affect P f for any of the proteins. Incubation of oocytes with the cell-permeable protein kinase A inhibitor (R p)-cAMP-S (0.1 mm, 15 min) also did not affect P f values (data not shown). These results indicate that the single channel water permeabilities reported in Fig. 8 A are insensitive to the action of the major cellular protein kinases. The goal of this study was to compare single channel water and glycerol permeabilities of the six principal mammalian aquaporin homologs. Because purified functional aquaporins have not been available except for AQP1, our strategy was to engineer epitope tags"

Peptides terminating at amino acid 42 are believed to be the major player in sporadic AD as well as familial AD (FAD).

By using two independent methods we demonstrate intracellular Aβ1–42 as well as Aβx-42 but less Aβx-40 and Aβ1–40 in kidney 293 cells stably transfected with wild type β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) or the FAD-associated Val/Gly mutation. Moreover, retention of βAPP within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by treatment with brefeldin A does not block the cleavage at amino acid 42 but results in an increased production of all species of Aβ terminating at amino acid 42. This indicates that the cleavage after amino acid 42 can occur within the ER. Treatment of cells with monensin, which blocks transport of (βAPP) within the Golgi causes a marked accumulation of intracellular Aβx-42 and Aβx-40. Therefore these experiments indicate that the γ-secretase cleavage of Aβ after amino acid 42 can occur within the ER and later within the secretory pathway within the Golgi.

Neurol. 1995; 37: 287-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In contrast to the generation of Aβ terminating at amino acid 40, which predominantly occurs at or close to the cell surface (3Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18295-18298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 8Haass C. Hung A.Y. Schlossmacher M.G. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), very little is known about the subcellular localization of the γ-secretase cleavage resulting in the generation of Aβ peptides ending at amino acid 42. Since this proteolytic cleavage is very important for initiating the pathological events finally resulting in AD as well as FAD detailed knowledge about its cellular mechanism is required for potential therapeutic strategies involving inhibition of Aβ42 production. Kidney 293 cells stably transfected with wt βAPP or the Val/Gly mutation were generated and grown as described (7Haass C. Schlossmacher M.G. Hung A.Y. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Mellon A. Ostaszewski B.L.

Fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1% glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin was added to a confluent monolayer of cells in a 15-cm culture dish. Conditioned media were collected after 18 h. Cell lysates were prepared in 1 ml of lysis buffer as described (20Weidemann A. König G. Bunke D. Fischer P. Salbaum M. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K.

Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated as described (7Haass C. Schlossmacher M.G. Hung A.Y. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Mellon A. Ostaszewski B.L. Lieberburg I. Koo E.H. Schenk D. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J.

Cell lysates from metabolically labeled kidney 293 cells stably expressing wt βAPP or βAPP with the Val/Gly mutation were immunoprecipitated with antibody C7 (8Haass C. Hung A.Y. Schlossmacher M.G. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3021-3024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) raised to the last 20 C-terminal amino acids of βAPP. Immunoprecipitates were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamid gels. Immunoprecipitated full-length βAPP (N′- andN′/O′-glycosylated βAPP) was quantitated by phosphorimaging. To identify intracellular Aβ a postnuclear supernatant from metabolically labeled kidney 293 cells transfected with wt βAPP was separated by density gradient centrifugation. We then immunoprecipitated potential intracellular Aβ with the polyclonal antibody 3926, which recognizes all species of Aβ, including p3. Interestingly, we observed intracellular Aβ but no p3 in fractions 9–14 (Fig. 1). The lack of p3 is consistent with the knowledge that the γ-secretase cleavage generating this peptide occurs at or close to the cell surface, which results in the immediate secretion of p3 (8Haass C. Hung A.Y. Schlossmacher M.G. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3021-3024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of intracellular Aβ suggests its production early within the secretory pathway. However, this experiment does not discriminate Aβ terminating at amino acid 40 (Aβ40) or amino acid 42 (Aβ42). To discriminate Aβ40 from Aβ42 species we monitored intracellular as well as secreted Aβ terminating at amino acid 42 or amino acid 40 by using a previously established ELISA assay (12Suzuki N.

To detect all species of Aβ generated, we specifically detected Aβ peptides beginning with Asp1 (Aβ1–40, Aβ1–42) but also Aβ peptides beginning at alternative cleavage sites (Aβx-40, Aβx-42) which are abundant in kidney 293 cells and might play an important role during the disease (4Saido T.C.

As shown in Fig. 2, Aβ peptides terminating at amino acid 42 are indeed detected within lysates of cells stably transfected with wt βAPP. To prove if we indeed detect intracellular Aβ42, we analyzed cell lysates and conditioned media from cells stably transfected with the V717G mutation, which is known to cause an enhanced production of Aβ 42 (3Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18295-18298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 12Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.D. Odaka A. Otvos jr., L. Eckman C. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1994; 264: 1336-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). Indeed, much higher amounts of Aβ peptides terminating at amino acid 42 were detected in cell lysates from cells stably expressing the βAPP Val/Gly mutation (Fig.2). This is consistent with data published previously showing that mutations at position 717 of βAPP increase the levels of Aβ42 secreted into culture media (12Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.D. Odaka A. Otvos jr., L. Eckman C. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1994; 264: 1336-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). These results therefore support the specificity of the ELISA for measuring intracellular Aβ42. Aβ terminating at amino acid 40 appears to be under the detection limit of the ELISA (Fig. 2), which might be due to the fact that it is secreted immediately after γ-secretase cleavage on the cell surface (8Haass C. Hung A.Y. Schlossmacher M.G. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3021-3024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, Aβ40 could be present in a biochemically modified form or bound to another protein, which inhibits its detection using our ELISA or extraction protocol. In conditioned media all species of Aβ peptides were detected (Fig. 2). Again, cells transfected with the βAPP Val/Gly mutation secreted more Aβ peptides (Aβ1–42 as well as Aβx-42) terminating at amino acid 42 as compared with wt transfected cells (Fig. 2), which is consistent with data published by Suzuki et al. (12Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.D. Odaka A. Otvos jr., L. Eckman C. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1994; 264: 1336-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the increased secretion of Aβ species terminating at amino acid 42 by cells transfected with the βAPP Val/Gly mutation appears to be compensated partially by reduced levels of Aβ40 species (Fig. 2). In conditioned media higher levels of Aβ peptides terminating at amino acid 40 as of those terminating at amino acid 42 were detected ruling out that the ELISA is particularly sensitive for the detection of Aβ42. Therefore, although higher levels of total Aβ terminating at amino acid 40 are detected within conditioned media only Aβx-42/Aβ1–42 could be demonstrated within cell lysates indicating that the proteolytic cleavages after amino acid 40 and amino acid 42 occur by different cellular mechanisms. Since the cell lines expressing the βAPP Val/Gly mutation produced significantly elevated levels of Aβ terminating at amino acid 42, these cells were used to determine the subcellular site of the γ-secretase cleavage at amino acid 42. The detection of intracellular Aβ (Figs. 1 and 2) indicates that at least a subpopulation of Aβ peptides are generated early during protein trafficking. We therefore accumulated βAPP within the ER by treating cells with BFA and searched for intracellular as well as secreted Aβ species. Consistent with previous results (8Haass C. Hung A.Y. Schlossmacher M.G. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3021-3024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Busciglio J. Gabuzda D.H. Matsudaira P. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2092-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), secretion of all types of Aβ was strongly reduced (Fig.3 A). In cell lysates BFA did not inhibit intracellular production of Aβ1–42/x-42 but even caused an increase of these peptides (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, BFA treatment did not cause a detectable accumulation of intracellular Aβ1–40 or Aβx-40 (Fig. 3 A). To prove intracellular accumulation of Aβ42 peptides by an independent method, kidney 293 cells stably expressing βAPP Val/Gly were metabolically labeled in the presence and absence of BFA, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody BC05. As shown in Fig. 3 B, Aβ terminating at amino acid 42 accumulated after BFA treatment within cell lysates. Moreover, consistent with the data in Fig. 1 we did not detect p3, although large amounts of p3 terminating at amino acid 42 are known to be produced in kidney 293 cells (26Citron M. Diehl T. Gordon G. Biere A. Seubert P. Selkoe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13170-13175Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). This is again consistent with the finding that the γ-secretase cleavage generating p3 occurs predominantly at or close to the cell surface (8Haass C. Hung A.Y. Schlossmacher M.G. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3021-3024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the immunoprecipitation independently proves the accumulation of intracellular Aβ peptides terminating after amino acid 42. We also treated cells with monensin, which is known to inhibit βAPP trafficking late within the secretory pathway (21Gabuzda D. Busciglio J. Chen L.B. Matsudaira P. Yankner B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13623-13628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As BFA, monensin blocks secretion of all types of Aβ (Fig. 4), which is consistent with previous findings (8Haass C. Hung A.Y. Schlossmacher M.G. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3021-3024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gabuzda D. Busciglio J. Chen L.B. Matsudaira P. Yankner B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13623-13628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, monensin causes a significant intracellular accumulation of Aβx-42 as well as Aβx-40 (Fig. 4). Due to the prolonged treatment with monensin (18 h versus 4 h with BFA), the total amount of both peptides is significantly higher as compared with BFA treatment (Fig. 3 A). Since Aβx-40 is not increased upon BFA treatment this indicates that the γ-secretase cleavage after amino acid 40 can occur within the Golgi but not within the ER. The latter observation is consistent with the data presented by Koo and Squazzo (19Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Gabuzda et al. (21Gabuzda D. Busciglio J. Chen L.B. Matsudaira P. Yankner B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13623-13628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showing that small amounts of Aβ peptides are generated prior to reinternalization. Based on our data, these peptides appear to represent alternatively cleaved Aβ peptides. The data in Figs. 3 and 4 suggest that the proteolytic cleavage at amino acid 42 can occur at least to some extend within the ER and the Golgi network. To further prove that endosomal/lysosomal processing of βAPP is not a prerequisite for Aβ42 formation we treated cells transfected with the βAPP Val/Gly mutation with increasing concentrations of NH4Cl to inhibit vesicular acidification. As shown in Fig.5 A NH4Cl treatment did not inhibit intracellular Aβ1–42 generation but even caused a dose-dependent increase in the generation of Aβx-42. This indicates not only that endosmal lysomal processing is not a prerequisite for Aβ42 generation but might also suggest that Aβ42 could be degraded within endosomes and lysosomes. Moreover, inhibition of reinternalization by expressing the Y687A βAPP mutation (19Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by deleting the entire cytoplasmic tail (Ref.8Haass C. Hung A.Y. Schlossmacher M.G. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3021-3024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; data not shown) also did not inhibit intracellular generation of Aβ42 peptides (Fig. 5 B). These results therefore indicate that endosomal/lysosomal targeting of βAPP is not a prerequisite for Aβ42 generation. Our results suggest that Aβ peptides can be cleaved at their C termini by distinct proteolytic mechanisms located within different subcellular compartments of kidney 293 cells. The identification of a novel cell biological mechanism for Aβ42 generation in peripheral cells might also be relevant for neuronal cells. This is supported by the observations that all βAPP and PS mutations elevate Aβ42 production in peripheral cells, primary neurons, as well as in human brain and brains from transgenic mice overexpressing PS or βAPP mutations (14Tanzi R. Kovacs D. Kim T.-W. Moir R. Guenette S. Wasco W. Neurobiol. Dis. 1996; 3: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 15Haass C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 687-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, cellular toxicity appears to be restricted to neuronal cells as observed in the AD brain (3Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18295-18298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). The γ-secretase cleaving at amino acid 40 predominantly occurs close to or at the cell surface (8Haass C. Hung A.Y. Schlossmacher M.G. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3021-3024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the protease cleaving at position 42 can act within the ER and Golgi. This is consistent with the recent finding that the γ-secretase cleavage at position 40 and 42 can be inhibited differentially with the protease inhibitor MDL 28170 (26Citron M. Diehl T. Gordon G.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28655-28659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Moreover, as discussed by Tischer and Cordell (28Tischer E. Cordell B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21914-21919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) the cleavage at position 42 might be facilitated within the ER and early Golgi, because the lower membrane thickness may allow proteases located on the cytoplasmic site of the ER to cleave at position 42, a hypothesis supported by our data. Our results also indicate that alternative N-terminal cleavages might occur preferentially within the secretory pathway. Moreover, β-secretase appears to be active to some extend within the ER as well. Most of the alternative N-terminal cleavages (Aβx-40/42) are detected with antibody BNT77, which identifies an epitope between amino acids 11–16. This might suggest that most of the Aβx-40/42 species detected in the ELISA represent alternatively cleaved Aβ peptides starting at Glu11. Indeed, relatively high levels of this truncated Aβ peptide were previously detected in media of kidney 293 cells expressing βAPP (7Haass C. Schlossmacher M.G. Hung A.Y. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Mellon A.

Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3021-3024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This peptide might also play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD as well (4Saido T.C. Iwatsubo T. Mann D.M. Shimada H. Ihara Y. Kawashima S. Neuron. 1995; 14: 457-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The cleavage at position 42 within the ER and Golgi is of particular interest, since mutant PS proteins are known to cause enhanced production of the long form of Aβ (14Tanzi R. Kovacs D. Kim T.-W.

One should therefore assume that the pathological action of the mutant PS proteins occurs to some extend within the ER and Golgi, which is supported by our findings that the proteolytic cleavage of Aβ at amino acid 42 occurs within the same compartments where the PS proteins were located previously. Moreover, the detection and accumulation of intracellular Aβ terminating at amino acid 42 leads to the possibility that the toxic effects of this highly amyloidogenic peptide are exerted prior to its secretion. This might lead to neuronal cell death as well as the generation of a nidus for further Aβ aggregation, which is then followed by amyloid plaque formation. Interestingly, intracellular amyloid fibers were recently detected in transgenic mice developing the typical pathological lesions found in human AD brains (33Masliah E. Sisk A. Mallory M. Mucke L. Schenk D. Games D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5795-5811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such a putative mechanism might also solve the apparent discrepancy that Aβ42 levels determined in biological fluids do not reach the critical concentration required for aggregation, since intracellular accumulation of Aβ42 could very well lead to high local concentrations of Aβ42 sufficient for its precipitation. We would like to thank Dr. Selkoe for the gift of antibody C7."

GDNF signals through a receptor complex consisting of the receptor tyrosine kinase Ret and a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked receptor termed GDNFR-α9,10,11,12,13. Here we report the cloning of a new GPI-linked receptor termed NTNR-α that is homologous with GDNFR-α and is widely expressed in the nervous system and other tissues. By using microinjection to introduce expression plasmids into neurons, we show that coexpression of NTNR-α with Ret confers a survival response to neurturin but not GDNF, and that coexpression of GDNFR-α with Ret confers a survival response to GDNF but not neurturin. Our findings indicate that GDNF and neurturin promote neuronal survival by signalling through similar multicomponent receptors that consist of a common receptor tyrosine kinase and a member of a GPI-linked family of receptors that determines ligand specificity."

Tβ4 has been identified as a factor involved in the differentiation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured on Matrigel. Here we have used various in vitro and in vivo migration assays to demonstrate the role of Tβ4 in endothelial cell migration. Our results demonstrate that Tβ4 acts as a chemoattractant for endothelial cells, stimulating the migration of HUVECs in Boyden chambers four- to sixfold over that observed with media alone. Of the primary cell types tested, only human coronary artery cells responded to Tβ4 treatment, suggesting that the migration activity of Tβ4 was endothelial cell-specific. Tβ4 significantly accelerated the rate of migration into the scratch wounded area of a HUVEC monolayer. Tβ4 treatment also increased the production of matrix metalloproteinases that may degrade the basement membrane during angiogenesis. Additional experiments using subcutaneously implanted Matrigel showed that Tβ4 stimulated cell migration in vivo. These results provide the first direct evidence that Tβ4 has chemoattractive activity and promotes angiogenesis by stimulating the migration of endothelial cells.—Malinda, K. M., Goldstein, A.

https://openalex.org/W2149437926,"Most national and international agencies producing population projections avoid addressing explicitly the issue of uncertainty. Typically, they provide either a single projection or a set of low, medium and high variants1,2, and only very rarely do they give these projections a probabilistic interpretation. Probabilistic population projections have been developed for specific industrialized countries, mostly the United States, and are based largely on time-series analysis3. On a global level, time-series analysis is not applicable because there is a lack of appropriate data, and for conceptual reasons such as the structural discontinuity caused by the demographic transition4,5,6. Here we report on a new probabilistic approach that makes use of expert opinion on trends in fertility, mortality and migration, and on the 90 per cent uncertainty range of those trends in different parts of the world. We have used simulation techniques to derive probability distributions of population sizes and age structures for 13 regions of the world up to the year 2100. Among other things, we find that there is a probability of two-thirds that the world's population will not double in the twenty-first century."

In a Manin-Darby canine kidney cell model for ischemia-reperfusion/hypoxia-reoxygenation injury which employs inhibitors of glycolysis (2-deoxy-d-glucose) and oxidative phosphorylation (antimycin A), transepithelial electrical resistance, a measure of TJ integrity, dropped rapidly, correlating well with declining ATP levels. Although immunocytochemical studies revealed only subtle changes in the distribution of the TJ proteins, zonula occludens (ZO)-1, ZO-2, and cingulin, examination of the Triton X-100 solubilities of these proteins, an indicator of cytoskeletal association, revealed a striking shift of all three TJ proteins into the insoluble pool, consistent with increased cytoskeletal interaction during ATP depletion. In addition, rate-zonal centrifugation analysis of a detergent-soluble fraction showed an increase in the amount of ZO-1 and ZO-2 in high density fractions following ATP depletion, providing further evidence for association of TJ proteins into a large complex possibly involving the cytoskeleton. Analysis of immunoprecipitation data from [35S]methionine-labeled cells revealed that ATP depletion led to the association of a 240-kDa protein with the ZO-1-containing complex. Western blots of this protein immunoprecipitated with anti-ZO-1 antibodies confirmed its identity as fodrin, a protein believed to link membrane and other proteins to the actin-based cytoskeleton.

These lesions have been reproduced in cell culture models for hypoxia-reoxygenation injury using agents that deplete cellular ATP, which has allowed for the analysis of molecular mechanisms underlying ischemic injury (15Canfield P.E.

Although mechanistic insights into the disruption of the actin-based cytoskeleton are beginning to emerge, little is known about the biochemical basis of the disruption of the TJ after ischemic insult or how the TJ reassembles during recovery of epithelial cells from ischemic injury.The biochemical basis of the disassembly and reassembly of the TJ has, however, been studied in MDCK cells in a model in which extracellular calcium is manipulated: the “calcium switch” (8Stuart R.O.

When the TJ disassembles in this model under low calcium conditions, transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) is lost, and TJ proteins internalize or are diffusely distributed near the cell surface. In this model, TJ proteins become more extractable with detergent-salt solutions, suggesting a weakening of interactions with the cytoskeleton, and ZO-1, ZO-2, and p130 are found in a complex which sometimes contains other phosphoproteins (8Stuart R.O. Nigam S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6072-6076Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar).

However, in cell culture models for hypoxia-reoxygenation, these issues have not been examined in the same biochemical detail as with low extracellular calcium and the calcium switch. Using physiological, immunocytochemical, and biochemical techniques, we have now explored the behavior of TJ proteins in a MDCK cell model for hypoxia-reoxygenation which employs antimycin A and 2-deoxy-d-glucose (15Canfield P.E. Geerdes A.M. Molitoris B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F1038-F1045PubMed Google Scholar, 22Doctor R.B. Bacallao R. Mandel L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1803-C1811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and compared this model with the calcium switch model. We demonstrate that the biochemical changes observed during TJ disassembly after ATP depletion are very different from those observed when cells are subjected to low calcium conditions. In this model, TJ disassembly is accompanied by the association of TJ proteins into very large complexes, movement of at least three TJ proteins into an insoluble pool, and an increased association of the ZO-1-containing complex with the membrane protein-anchoring cytoskeletal protein, fodrin. Our results provide insights into the molecular pathogenesis of epithelial dysfunction resulting from ischemic insult.DISCUSSIONPrevious studies of ischemia in vivo and ATP depletionin vitro have demonstrated a disruption of the actin-based cytoskeleton (14Fish E.M.

Defrain M. Chien A. Hinshaw D. Athey B. Meixner W. Venkatachalam M.A. Weinberg J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 39: F39-F52Google Scholar). This conceivably could lead to altered polarity of membrane proteins (e.g.Na+,K+-ATPase, Figs. 4 and 8) and loss of the permeability barrier in epithelial cells (13Molitoris B.A. Nelson W.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 14Fish E.M. Molitoris B.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 1580-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 16Mandel L.J. Bacallao R. Zampighi G. Nature. 1993; 361: 552-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). As the TJ closely associates with the cytoskeleton, the functional loss of TER after ATP depletion seen by us and others could also be accounted for by cytoskeletal alterations (1Anderson J.M. Balda M.S. Fanning A.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 772-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 11Itoh M. Yonemura S. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). To clarify the mechanisms of TJ disassembly underlying ATP depletion in epithelial cells, we examined an interaction between TJ proteins and cytoskeleton biochemically and morphologically. In these studies, we have shown that after the decline in TER which occurs concomitantly with a decline in cellular ATP levels (Fig. 1), three TJ proteins (ZO-1, ZO-2, and cingulin) become extremely insoluble (Figs. 5, 6, and 8), and those that can be solubilized are found in very large molecular mass complexes (Fig. 9) even though all three TJ proteins remain largely localized to the lateral surface of the plasma membrane (Figs. 2, 3, 4). ATP depletion leads the ZO-1-containing complex of TJ proteins to associate, either directly or indirectly, with the actin-associated cytoskeletal protein, fodrin (Figs. 11 and 12). Most of these changes appear to be largely reversible even after 3 h of ATP depletion (Figs. 1 and 8).Recent reports suggest that alterations of the actin-based cytoskeleton after ischemic insult and ATP depletion might be induced via intracellular calcium changes (37Nurko S. Sogabe K. Davis J.A. Roeser N.F. Defrain M. Chien A. Hinshaw D. Athey B. Meixner W. Venkatachalam M.A. Weinberg J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 39: F39-F52Google Scholar, 38Weinberg J.M. Davis J.A.

Invest. 1994; 93: 1922-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It is possible that these changes in intracellular calcium also contribute to the changes in biochemical behavior of TJ proteins and their cytoskeletal association which we have observed after ATP depletion. However, a high intracellular calcium alone is insufficient to explain such an association, at least not under conditions in which the TJ is neither being assembled nor disassembled. For example, when intracellular calcium is manipulated with cell-permeant chelators or calcium ionophores in the absence of ATP depletion, there is no increase in the extractability of TJ proteins (data not shown). Still, changes in intracellular calcium might play an important role in stabilizing TJ protein-cytoskeletal interactions after TJ disassembly in the face of ATP depletion; likewise, the ion could play a regulatory role in the weakening of these interactions during reassembly after ATP repletion. There is precedence for such a view; in the calcium switch, changes in intracellular calcium concentration have been linked, at least indirectly, to the solubility properties of TJ proteins (19Stuart R.O. Sun A. Bush K.T. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13636-13641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In this latter model for TJ disassembly and reassembly, the reassembly of the TJ involves a heterotrimeric G protein (20Denker B.M. Saha C. Khawaja S. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25750-25753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), regulated intracellular calcium stores (18Stuart R.O. Sun A. Panichas M. Hebert S.C. Brenner B.M.

A. 1995; 92: 6072-6076Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). It will therefore be interesting to determine in future studies whether the reassembly of the TJ after ATP depletion-repletion is likewise dependent on classical signaling mechanisms.Fodrin, a non-erythroid spectrin, serves to link a number of membrane proteins to the cytoskeleton network (41Nelson W.J. Hammerton R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 42Nelson W.J. Shore E.M. Wang A.Z. Hammerton R.W. J.

Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Spectrin, as well as ankyrin, has been reported to colocalize with junctional proteins in polarized epithelial cells (32Bennett V. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 4: 1029-1065Crossref Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 44Beck K.A. Nelson W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1263-C1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data indicate that after ATP depletion, the relative fraction of fodrin near the TJ increases. Although we were able to coimmunoprecipitate fodrin with the ZO-1-containing complex, it remains unclear whether this association is direct or indirect. Nevertheless, our results indicate that the strength of interactions between the TJ and cytoskeleton is dynamic, particularly in the context of epithelial cell ischemic injury, and we propose that a key step in this process is the association of TJ proteins with fodrin and/or other cytoskeletal proteins, an association that could be regulated by specific signaling mechanisms involving calcium and/or protein phosphorylation. Agents that interfere with this association may be of therapeutic use in the setting of ischemic injury. The epithelial intercellular permeability barrier is maintained largely by the tight junction (TJ) 1The abbreviations used are: TJ, tight junction; ZO-1, zonula occludens 1; ZO-2, zonula occludens 2; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; TER, transepithelial electrical resistance; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: TJ, tight junction; ZO-1, zonula occludens 1; ZO-2, zonula occludens 2; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; TER, transepithelial electrical resistance; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Although mechanistic insights into the disruption of the actin-based cytoskeleton are beginning to emerge, little is known about the biochemical basis of the disruption of the TJ after ischemic insult or how the TJ reassembles during recovery of epithelial cells from ischemic injury. The biochemical basis of the disassembly and reassembly of the TJ has, however, been studied in MDCK cells in a model in which extracellular calcium is manipulated: the “calcium switch” (8Stuart R.O.

When the TJ disassembles in this model under low calcium conditions, transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) is lost, and TJ proteins internalize or are diffusely distributed near the cell surface. In this model, TJ proteins become more extractable with detergent-salt solutions, suggesting a weakening of interactions with the cytoskeleton, and ZO-1, ZO-2, and p130 are found in a complex which sometimes contains other phosphoproteins (8Stuart R.O. Nigam S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6072-6076Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). When extracellular calcium is raised, reassembly of the TJ appears to proceed by classical signaling pathways involving a heterotrimeric G protein, regulated intracellular calcium stores (18Stuart R.O.

TJ proteins resort to the apico-lateral surface of the plasma membrane, TER develops, and TJ proteins become more resistant to detergent-salt extractions (8Stuart R.O. Nigam S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Superficially, what is known about the behavior of the TJ in MDCK monolayers after ATP depletion and repletion resembles the disassembly of the TJ in low calcium conditions and its reassembly when external calcium is raised. However, in cell culture models for hypoxia-reoxygenation, these issues have not been examined in the same biochemical detail as with low extracellular calcium and the calcium switch. Using physiological, immunocytochemical, and biochemical techniques, we have now explored the behavior of TJ proteins in a MDCK cell model for hypoxia-reoxygenation which employs antimycin A and 2-deoxy-d-glucose (15Canfield P.E. Geerdes A.M. Molitoris B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F1038-F1045PubMed Google Scholar, 22Doctor R.B. Bacallao R. Mandel L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1803-C1811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and compared this model with the calcium switch model. We demonstrate that the biochemical changes observed during TJ disassembly after ATP depletion are very different from those observed when cells are subjected to low calcium conditions. In this model, TJ disassembly is accompanied by the association of TJ proteins into very large complexes, movement of at least three TJ proteins into an insoluble pool, and an increased association of the ZO-1-containing complex with the membrane protein-anchoring cytoskeletal protein, fodrin. Our results provide insights into the molecular pathogenesis of epithelial dysfunction resulting from ischemic insult. DISCUSSIONPrevious studies of ischemia in vivo and ATP depletionin vitro have demonstrated a disruption of the actin-based cytoskeleton (14Fish E.M. Molitoris B.A. N. Engl. J.

This conceivably could lead to altered polarity of membrane proteins (e.g.Na+,K+-ATPase, Figs. 4 and 8) and loss of the permeability barrier in epithelial cells (13Molitoris B.A. Nelson W.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 14Fish E.M. Molitoris B.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 1580-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 16Mandel L.J. Bacallao R. Zampighi G. Nature. 1993; 361: 552-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). As the TJ closely associates with the cytoskeleton, the functional loss of TER after ATP depletion seen by us and others could also be accounted for by cytoskeletal alterations (1Anderson J.M. Balda M.S. Fanning A.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 772-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 11Itoh M. Yonemura S. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). To clarify the mechanisms of TJ disassembly underlying ATP depletion in epithelial cells, we examined an interaction between TJ proteins and cytoskeleton biochemically and morphologically. In these studies, we have shown that after the decline in TER which occurs concomitantly with a decline in cellular ATP levels (Fig. 1), three TJ proteins (ZO-1, ZO-2, and cingulin) become extremely insoluble (Figs. 5, 6, and 8), and those that can be solubilized are found in very large molecular mass complexes (Fig. 9) even though all three TJ proteins remain largely localized to the lateral surface of the plasma membrane (Figs. 2, 3, 4). ATP depletion leads the ZO-1-containing complex of TJ proteins to associate, either directly or indirectly, with the actin-associated cytoskeletal protein, fodrin (Figs. 11 and 12). Most of these changes appear to be largely reversible even after 3 h of ATP depletion (Figs. 1 and 8).Recent reports suggest that alterations of the actin-based cytoskeleton after ischemic insult and ATP depletion might be induced via intracellular calcium changes (37Nurko S. Sogabe K. Davis J.A. Roeser N.F. Defrain M. Chien A. Hinshaw D. Athey B. Meixner W. Venkatachalam M.A. Weinberg J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 39: F39-F52Google Scholar, 38Weinberg J.M. Davis J.A.

Invest. 1994; 93: 1922-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It is possible that these changes in intracellular calcium also contribute to the changes in biochemical behavior of TJ proteins and their cytoskeletal association which we have observed after ATP depletion. However, a high intracellular calcium alone is insufficient to explain such an association, at least not under conditions in which the TJ is neither being assembled nor disassembled. For example, when intracellular calcium is manipulated with cell-permeant chelators or calcium ionophores in the absence of ATP depletion, there is no increase in the extractability of TJ proteins (data not shown). Still, changes in intracellular calcium might play an important role in stabilizing TJ protein-cytoskeletal interactions after TJ disassembly in the face of ATP depletion; likewise, the ion could play a regulatory role in the weakening of these interactions during reassembly after ATP repletion. There is precedence for such a view; in the calcium switch, changes in intracellular calcium concentration have been linked, at least indirectly, to the solubility properties of TJ proteins (19Stuart R.O. Sun A. Bush K.T. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13636-13641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In this latter model for TJ disassembly and reassembly, the reassembly of the TJ involves a heterotrimeric G protein (20Denker B.M. Saha C. Khawaja S. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25750-25753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), regulated intracellular calcium stores (18Stuart R.O. Sun A. Panichas M. Hebert S.C. Brenner B.M.

It will therefore be interesting to determine in future studies whether the reassembly of the TJ after ATP depletion-repletion is likewise dependent on classical signaling mechanisms.Fodrin, a non-erythroid spectrin, serves to link a number of membrane proteins to the cytoskeleton network (41Nelson W.J. Hammerton R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 42Nelson W.J. Shore E.M. Wang A.Z. Hammerton R.W. J.

Spectrin, as well as ankyrin, has been reported to colocalize with junctional proteins in polarized epithelial cells (32Bennett V. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 4: 1029-1065Crossref Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 44Beck K.A. Nelson W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1263-C1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data indicate that after ATP depletion, the relative fraction of fodrin near the TJ increases. Although we were able to coimmunoprecipitate fodrin with the ZO-1-containing complex, it remains unclear whether this association is direct or indirect. Nevertheless, our results indicate that the strength of interactions between the TJ and cytoskeleton is dynamic, particularly in the context of epithelial cell ischemic injury, and we propose that a key step in this process is the association of TJ proteins with fodrin and/or other cytoskeletal proteins, an association that could be regulated by specific signaling mechanisms involving calcium and/or protein phosphorylation. Agents that interfere with this association may be of therapeutic use in the setting of ischemic injury.

https://openalex.org/W1506678536,"The Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) negatively regulate Rho-family GTPases. The inhibitory activity of GDI derives both from an ability to bind the carboxy-terminal isoprene of Rho family members and extract them from membranes, and from inhibition of GTPase cycling between the GTP- and GDP-bound states. Here we demonstrate that these binding and inhibitory functions of rhoGDI can be attributed to two structurally distinct regions of the protein. A carboxy-terminal folded domain of relative molecular mass 16,000 (M[r] 16K) binds strongly to the Rho-family member Cdc42, yet has little effect on the rate of nucleotide dissociation from the GTPase. The solution structure of this domain shows a beta-sandwich motif with a narrow hydrophobic cleft that binds isoprenes, and an exposed surface that interacts with the protein portion of Cdc42. The amino-terminal region of rhoGDI is unstructured in the absence of target and contributes little to binding, but is necessary to inhibit nucleotide dissociation from Cdc42. These results lead to a model of rhoGDI function in which the carboxy-terminal binding domain targets the amino-terminal inhibitory region to GTPases, resulting in membrane extraction and inhibition of nucleotide cycling."

The Doc2α-Mid and Munc13-1-Did deletion mutants were not co-immunoprecipitated with the respective partner proteins. The co-immunoprecipitation of full-length Munc13-1 with Doc2α from PC12 cells was markedly enhanced when the cells were stimulated by TPA or high K+ in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, which induced Ca2+-dependent exocytosis (Fig.3 a).

With the C1 domain deletion mutant, the co-immunoprecipitation of full-length Munc13-1 with Doc2α was observed even without the stimulation of PC12 cells by high K+ or TPA. Consistent with these cell level experiments, the interactions of in vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled Munc13-1 and the recombinant GST-tagged Doc2α-Mid-containing region were also stimulated by TPA or PDBu in a cell-free binding assay system (Fig. 3 b).

For this experiment, we took advantage of the GH coexpression assay system of PC12 cells (12Wick P.F. Senter R.A. Parsels L.A. Uhler M.D. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10983-10989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this system, human GH and a sample to be tested were coexpressed. Expressed GH is known to be stored in dense core vesicles and to be released in response to high K+ and TPA in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (13Schweitzer E.S. Kelly R.B. J.

The Northern blot analysis indicated that both Doc2α and Munc13-1 were expressed in PC12 cells (data not shown). Overexpression of Doc2α enhanced not only the high K+-induced GH release (4Orita S. Sasaki T. Komuro R. Sakaguchi G. Maeda M. Igarashi H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7257-7260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) but also the TPA-induced GH release (Fig. 4). Overexpression of Munc13-1-Did reduced both the high K+- and TPA-induced GH release. Co-expression with Doc2α suppressed this reduction.Figure 4Involvement of the Doc2α-Munc13-1 interactions in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis from PC12 cells.

These results, together with the earlier findings that PE directly interacts with the C1 domain of unc-13 (5Maruyama I.N. Brenner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5729-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar,7Kazanietz M.G. Lewin N.E. Bruns J.D. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), indicate that the binding of PE to the C1 domain of Munc13-1 causes the Doc2α-Munc13-1 interactions. We have moreover shown here that the Doc2α-Munc13-1 interactions are observed in intact PC12 cells and enhanced during the high K+ or TPA-induced Ca2+-dependent exocytosis,and that these interactions are observed even without the stimulation of PC12 cells by high K+ or TPA when the C1 domain deletion mutant of Munc13-1 is used. These results, together with the earlier findings that high K+ induces DAG formation (15Wakade T.D. Bhave S.V. Bhave A.S. Malhotra R.K. Wakade A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6424-6428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggest that the Doc2α-Munc13-1 interactions are induced by DAG produced during Ca2+-dependent exocytosis through the C1 domain of Munc13-1. Finally, we have demonstrated by use of the GH co-expression assay system of PC12 cells that Doc2α and Munc13-1 functionally interact with each other during Ca2+-dependent exocytosis.Many systems and components are implicated in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis, such as neurotransmitter release. These includeN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor/SNAP/SNARE, Rab, protein kinase C, and Ca2+-binding protein systems (for reviews see Refs. 16Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar and 17Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4018) Google Scholar). Of these systems, the SNARE system is implicated in docking of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane through the v-SNARE (vesicle-associated membrane protein)-t-SNARE (syntaxin and SNAP-25) interactions (for a review see Ref. 18Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar). InC. elegans, unc-13 belongs to a group of genes defined by mutations with a paralytic phenotype and accumulation of acetylcholine (19Hosono R. Kamiya Y. Neurosci. Lett. 1991; 128: 243-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), suggesting that Munc13-1 is also involved in neurotransmitter release in mammals. Doc2α is involved in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis from PC12 cells (4Orita S. Sasaki T. Komuro R. Sakaguchi G. Maeda M. Igarashi H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7257-7260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Munc13-1 is located on the presynaptic plasma membrane (6Brose N. Hofmann K. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25273-25280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), and Doc2α is concentrated on synaptic vesicles (1Orita S. Sasaki T. Naito A. Komuro R. Ohtsuka T. Maeda M. Suzuki H. Igarashi H. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Our present results together with these earlier findings suggest that the Doc2α-Munc13-1 system is another docking machinery controlled by DAG. It has recently been shown that Munc13-1 interacts directly with syntaxin (20Betz A. Okamoto M. Benseler F. Brose N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2520-2526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and that Munc18, a mammalian homologue of C. elegans unc-18 (21Hata Y. Slaughter C.A. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), directly interacts with Doc2 (22Verhage M. Vries K.J. Röshol H. Burbach J.P. Gispen W.H. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 453-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Munc18 directly interacts with syntaxin, and Munc18 is dissociated from syntaxin when syntaxin forms a complex with vesicle-associated membrane protein and SNAP-25 (23Pevsner J. Hsu S.-C. Braun J.E.A. Calakos N. Ting A.E. Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Therefore, the Doc2-Munc13 and Doc2-Munc18 systems may function in cooperation with syntaxin in docking process. It is likely that the mutual interactions among syntaxin, Munc18, Munc13, and Doc2, play a crucial role in docking process. It is important to examine the effects of the DAG-induced Doc2-Munc13 interactions on the Doc2-Mun18, Mun13-syntaxin, and Munc18-syntaxin interactions.Another recent analysis indicates that PE increases the size of the readily releasable pool of secretory granules in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells (24Gillis K.D. Mößner R. Neher E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1209-1220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this action of PE is mediated through protein kinase C, but the properties of Munc13-1 suggest that it is a better candidate for this action of PE. Moreover, because Doc2α and Munc13-1 interact with Ca2+, they may serve as Ca2+ sensors for Ca2+-dependent exocytosis in cooperation with other Ca2+-binding proteins. Many proteins having two C2 domains have been identified. These include Doc2 (1Orita S. Sasaki T. Naito A. Komuro R. Ohtsuka T. Maeda M. Suzuki H. Igarashi H. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), Munc13 (6Brose N. Hofmann K. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25273-25280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), synaptotagmin (25Perin M.S. Fried V.A. Mignery G.A. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1990; 345: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), and rabphilin-3A (26Shirataki H. Kaibuchi K. Sakoda T. Kishida S. Yamaguchi T. Wada K. Miyazaki M. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2061-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), all of which are implicated in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis. The C2 domain of PKC has been shown to interact with membrane PL, particularly phosphatidylserine, in the presence of Ca2+ (for a review see Ref. 27Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar). The precise role of Ca2+ in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis still remains unclear, but it could be speculated that the proteins having two C2 domains constitute a big complex to form a scafold-like structure and play a critical role in the fusion process in cooperation with Ca2+ and membrane PL in addition to the docking process. We have isolated Doc2 as a novel protein having two C2 domains that interact with Ca2+ and PL 1The abbreviations used are: PL, phospholipid; PE, phorbol ester; DAG, diacylglycerol; aa, amino acids; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; PDBu, 4β-phorbol dibutyrate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PSS, physiological salt solution; GH, growth hormone; SNAP, solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein; SNARE, SNAP receptor. 1The abbreviations used are: PL, phospholipid; PE, phorbol ester; DAG, diacylglycerol; aa, amino acids; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; PDBu, 4β-phorbol dibutyrate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PSS, physiological salt solution; GH, growth hormone; SNAP, solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein; SNARE, SNAP receptor.(1Orita S.

We have moreover shown that overexpression of the N-terminal fragment of Doc2α or its C-terminal fragment including the C2 domains in PC12 cells inhibits Ca2+-dependent exocytosis (4Orita S.

Expressed GH is known to be stored in dense core vesicles and to be released in response to high K+ and TPA in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (13Schweitzer E.S. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14Komuro R. Sasaki T. Takaishi K. Orita S. Takai Y. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The Northern blot analysis indicated that both Doc2α and Munc13-1 were expressed in PC12 cells (data not shown). Overexpression of Doc2α enhanced not only the high K+-induced GH release (4Orita S. Sasaki T. Komuro R. Sakaguchi G. Maeda M. Igarashi H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7257-7260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) but also the TPA-induced GH release (Fig. 4). Overexpression of Munc13-1-Did reduced both the high K+- and TPA-induced GH release. Co-expression with Doc2α suppressed this reduction.Figure 4Involvement of the Doc2α-Munc13-1 interactions in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis from PC12 cells.

Screening of 1 × 106 transformants yielded nine independent positive clones that interacted with Doc2α. The seven positive clones had cDNA inserts ranging from 2.0 to 3.1 kilobase pairs, all of which encoded the parts of the sequences corresponding to 840–1743 aa residues of Munc13-1, except that the isolated clones containing the C-terminal portion of Munc13-1 lacked the sequences corresponding to 1560–1578 aa residues of Munc13-1 (6Brose N. Hofmann K. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25273-25280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). This region might be subjected to alternative splicing. The minimum regions of the Doc2α-Munc13-1 interactions were 851–1461 aa residues of Munc13-1 (Munc13-1-Did = Doc2α-interacting domain of Munc13-1) (Fig. 1 a) and 13–37 aa residues of Doc2α (Doc2α-Mid =Munc13–1-interacting domain of Doc2α) (Fig. 1 b). Doc2β also interacted with Munc13-1 (Fig. 1 c). Munc13-2 also interacted with Doc2α and Doc2β. Doc2α-Mid showed striking sequence homology to Doc2β-Mid (92% identity). Munc13-1-Did also showed striking sequence homology to Munc13-2-Did (81% identity). These interactions were estimated by the yeast two-hybrid system. The Doc2α-Munc13-1 interactions were confirmed by the binding ofin vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled Doc2α and Munc13-1 to GST-tagged recombinant Munc13-1-Did and the GST-tagged Doc2α Mid-containing region, respectively (Fig.2, a and b). The Doc2α-Mid and Munc13-1-Did deletion mutants did not interact with the respective partner proteins. The Doc2α-Munc13-1 interactions were furthermore confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation from cultured PC12 cells ofmyc-tagged full-length Munc13-1 and HA-tagged full-length Doc2α and of myc-tagged Munc13-1-Did and HA-tagged full-length Doc2α (Fig. 2, c and d). The Doc2α-Mid and Munc13-1-Did deletion mutants were not co-immunoprecipitated with the respective partner proteins. The co-immunoprecipitation of full-length Munc13-1 with Doc2α from PC12 cells was markedly enhanced when the cells were stimulated by TPA or high K+ in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, which induced Ca2+-dependent exocytosis (Fig.3 a). However, the co-immunoprecipitation was not enhanced when the cells were stimulated by TPA or high K+ in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (data not shown). The TPA-induced or high K+-induced co-immunoprecipitation was not observed with the Did deletion mutant of Munc13-1. With the C1 domain deletion mutant, the co-immunoprecipitation of full-length Munc13-1 with Doc2α was observed even without the stimulation of PC12 cells by high K+ or TPA. Consistent with these cell level experiments, the interactions of in vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled Munc13-1 and the recombinant GST-tagged Doc2α-Mid-containing region were also stimulated by TPA or PDBu in a cell-free binding assay system (Fig. 3 b). The Doc2α-Munc13-1 interactions were not observed with the Doc2α-Mid and Munc13-1-Did deletion mutants of the respective proteins irrespective of the presence or absence of TPA (data not shown). It was finally examined whether the Doc2α-Munc13-1 interactions are functionally relevant for Ca2+-dependent exocytosis. For this experiment, we took advantage of the GH coexpression assay system of PC12 cells (12Wick P.F. Senter R.A. Parsels L.A. Uhler M.D. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10983-10989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this system, human GH and a sample to be tested were coexpressed. Expressed GH is known to be stored in dense core vesicles and to be released in response to high K+ and TPA in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (13Schweitzer E.S. Kelly R.B. J.

The Northern blot analysis indicated that both Doc2α and Munc13-1 were expressed in PC12 cells (data not shown). Overexpression of Doc2α enhanced not only the high K+-induced GH release (4Orita S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7257-7260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) but also the TPA-induced GH release (Fig. 4). Overexpression of Munc13-1-Did reduced both the high K+- and TPA-induced GH release. Co-expression with Doc2α suppressed this reduction. DISCUSSIONWe have shown here that Doc2α interacts with Munc13-1in a cell-free system and that these interactions are stimulated by PE. These results, together with the earlier findings that PE directly interacts with the C1 domain of unc-13 (5Maruyama I.N. Brenner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5729-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar,7Kazanietz M.G. Lewin N.E. Bruns J.D. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), indicate that the binding of PE to the C1 domain of Munc13-1 causes the Doc2α-Munc13-1 interactions. We have moreover shown here that the Doc2α-Munc13-1 interactions are observed in intact PC12 cells and enhanced during the high K+ or TPA-induced Ca2+-dependent exocytosis,and that these interactions are observed even without the stimulation of PC12 cells by high K+ or TPA when the C1 domain deletion mutant of Munc13-1 is used. These results, together with the earlier findings that high K+ induces DAG formation (15Wakade T.D. Bhave S.V. Bhave A.S. Malhotra R.K. Wakade A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6424-6428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggest that the Doc2α-Munc13-1 interactions are induced by DAG produced during Ca2+-dependent exocytosis through the C1 domain of Munc13-1. Finally, we have demonstrated by use of the GH co-expression assay system of PC12 cells that Doc2α and Munc13-1 functionally interact with each other during Ca2+-dependent exocytosis.Many systems and components are implicated in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis, such as neurotransmitter release. These includeN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor/SNAP/SNARE, Rab, protein kinase C, and Ca2+-binding protein systems (for reviews see Refs. 16Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar and 17Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4018) Google Scholar). Of these systems, the SNARE system is implicated in docking of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane through the v-SNARE (vesicle-associated membrane protein)-t-SNARE (syntaxin and SNAP-25) interactions (for a review see Ref. 18Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar). InC. elegans, unc-13 belongs to a group of genes defined by mutations with a paralytic phenotype and accumulation of acetylcholine (19Hosono R. Kamiya Y. Neurosci. Lett. 1991; 128: 243-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), suggesting that Munc13-1 is also involved in neurotransmitter release in mammals. Doc2α is involved in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis from PC12 cells (4Orita S. Sasaki T. Komuro R. Sakaguchi G. Maeda M. Igarashi H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7257-7260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Munc13-1 is located on the presynaptic plasma membrane (6Brose N. Hofmann K. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25273-25280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), and Doc2α is concentrated on synaptic vesicles (1Orita S. Sasaki T. Naito A. Komuro R. Ohtsuka T. Maeda M. Suzuki H. Igarashi H. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Our present results together with these earlier findings suggest that the Doc2α-Munc13-1 system is another docking machinery controlled by DAG. It has recently been shown that Munc13-1 interacts directly with syntaxin (20Betz A. Okamoto M. Benseler F. Brose N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2520-2526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and that Munc18, a mammalian homologue of C. elegans unc-18 (21Hata Y. Slaughter C.A. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), directly interacts with Doc2 (22Verhage M. Vries K.J. Röshol H. Burbach J.P. Gispen W.H. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 453-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Munc18 directly interacts with syntaxin, and Munc18 is dissociated from syntaxin when syntaxin forms a complex with vesicle-associated membrane protein and SNAP-25 (23Pevsner J. Hsu S.-C. Braun J.E.A. Calakos N. Ting A.E. Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Therefore, the Doc2-Munc13 and Doc2-Munc18 systems may function in cooperation with syntaxin in docking process. It is likely that the mutual interactions among syntaxin, Munc18, Munc13, and Doc2, play a crucial role in docking process. It is important to examine the effects of the DAG-induced Doc2-Munc13 interactions on the Doc2-Mun18, Mun13-syntaxin, and Munc18-syntaxin interactions.Another recent analysis indicates that PE increases the size of the readily releasable pool of secretory granules in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells (24Gillis K.D. Mößner R. Neher E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1209-1220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this action of PE is mediated through protein kinase C, but the properties of Munc13-1 suggest that it is a better candidate for this action of PE. Moreover, because Doc2α and Munc13-1 interact with Ca2+, they may serve as Ca2+ sensors for Ca2+-dependent exocytosis in cooperation with other Ca2+-binding proteins. Many proteins having two C2 domains have been identified. These include Doc2 (1Orita S. Sasaki T. Naito A. Komuro R. Ohtsuka T. Maeda M. Suzuki H. Igarashi H. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), Munc13 (6Brose N. Hofmann K. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol.

Biol. 1993; 13: 2061-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), all of which are implicated in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis. The C2 domain of PKC has been shown to interact with membrane PL, particularly phosphatidylserine, in the presence of Ca2+ (for a review see Ref. 27Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar). The precise role of Ca2+ in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis still remains unclear, but it could be speculated that the proteins having two C2 domains constitute a big complex to form a scafold-like structure and play a critical role in the fusion process in cooperation with Ca2+ and membrane PL in addition to the docking process. We have shown here that Doc2α interacts with Munc13-1in a cell-free system and that these interactions are stimulated by PE. These results, together with the earlier findings that PE directly interacts with the C1 domain of unc-13 (5Maruyama I.N. Brenner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2152344629,"It has been shown that inhibition of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase blocks neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells stimulated with nerve growth factor. To further assess the role of PI 3-kinase, the active form of PI 3-kinase was expressed in PC12 cells by the adenovirus mediated introduction of a site-specific recombinase, Cre. After expression of the active PI 3-kinase, elevation of the levels of PI 3,4-diphosphate and PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate as well as formation of neurite-like processes was observed. The process formation was inhibited by wortmannin, a selective inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, which suggests that a high activity of PI 3-kinase was responsible for the formation of these processes. The processes lacked accumulation of F-actin and GAP43 at the growth cone, which suggests that the processes were incomplete compared with neurites. Instead, the bundling of microtubules was enhanced, which suggests that organization of the microtubules might be driving the process of elongation in the cells expressing the active PI 3-kinase. Induction of active PI 3-kinase resulted in activation of Jun N-terminal kinase but not of mitogen-activated protein kinase or protein kinase B/Rac protein kinase/Akt. These results suggest that PI 3-kinase is involved in neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells and that activation of Jun N-terminal kinase cascade may be involved in the cell response.

The PC12, rat pheochromocytoma cell line provides a useful model system for the differentiation of neuronal cells. They respond to nerve growth factor (NGF) 1The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; MAP, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; JNK, Jun N-terminal kinase; PKB, protein kinase B. 1The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; MAP, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; JNK, Jun N-terminal kinase; PKB, protein kinase B. with growth arrest and exhibit typical characteristics of neuronal cells (1Halegoua S. Armstrong R.C. Kremer N.E. Curr. Topics Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 165: 119-170PubMed Google Scholar). After stimulation with NGF, a number of signaling pathways are activated, including the Ras-MAP kinase, phospholipase C, and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase cascades (2Chao M.V. Cell. 1992; 68: 995-997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In the setting of multiple activation of signaling pathways, it has been suggested that sustained activation of MAP kinase in particular is involved in the differentiation (3Muroya K. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 277-281PubMed Google Scholar, 4Qiu M.-S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Indeed, constitutive activation of MAP kinase by activated Ras or MAP kinase kinase results in full differentiation of the cells (5Noda M. Ko M. Ogura A. Liu D.-G. Amano T. Takano T. Ikawa Y. Nature. 1985; 318: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 6Guerrero I. Wong H. Pellicer A. Burstein D.E. J.

Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar). Besides this, we have shown that PI 3-kinase activity is required for neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (8Kimura K. Hattori S. Kabuyama Y. Shizawa Y. Takayanagi J. Nakamura S. Toki S. Matsuda Y. Onodera K. Fukui Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18961-18967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results suggested that the PI 3-kinase activity was required especially for the neurite elongation. The analysis of the levels of phosphoinositides in NGF-treated PC12 cells revealed that PI 3-kinase was strongly activated immediately after NGF treatment, and this activity declined rapidly. However, even long after the burst of PI 3-kinase activation, levels of the products of PI 3-kinase remained slightly higher than that of unstimulated cells (8Kimura K. Hattori S. Kabuyama Y.

The PI 3-kinase activated by NGF stimulation consists of two subunits, p85 and p110 (9Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). The regulatory subunit, p85, contains one SH3 domain and two SH2 domains, which may be involved in interaction with other proteins. The p85 subunit binds to p110 through the region between the two SH2 domains of p85 (iSH2) (10Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Fry M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M.

Biol. 1994; 14: 2675-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). P110 is the catalytic subunit, and p85 binding is necessary to achieve full catalytic activity. The addition of iSH2 to the N-terminal region of p110 through a bridge of glycine residues constitutively activates PI 3-kinase (12Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar).We constructed a similar expression vector to analyze the effect of expression of the active PI 3-kinase in the cells. We attempted to establish stable cell lines expressing active PI 3-kinase; however, we have been unable to obtain such a cell line, perhaps due to the cell responses following the expression of the active PI 3-kinase. In this paper, we report establishment of cell lines for expression of the active PI 3-kinase by using the “Adex” system (13Kanegae Y. Lee G. Sato Y. Tanaka M. Nakai M. Sakaki T. Sugano S. Saito I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3816-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). In this system, the active PI 3-kinase gene was introduced to PC12 cells as a silent form with a stuffer of the neomycin resistance gene located between the CAG promoter (cytomegalovirus IE enhancer + chicken β-actin promoter + rabbit β-globin poly(A) signal) and the PI 3-kinase gene withloxP sequences in both ends. The stuffer is then cleaved out by a sequence-specific recombinase, Cre, by infection of the cells with an adenovirus coding for the recombinase (AxCANCre) to make the PI 3-kinase gene active. Expression of the PI 3-kinase gene was completely absent to allow the introduction of the toxic gene and recombination of the gene was very efficient, which made it possible to carry out the biochemical experiments.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe two cell lines, PC12Cre12 and PC12Cre20, were infected with adenoviruses. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the BD110 protein was detected at 24 h after infection, whereas the cells infected with AxCANLacZ, a control virus carrying β-galactosidase instead of Cre, did not produce the protein. Consistent with this, recombination of the gene to induce the BD110 protein was detected in the PCR analysis (Fig. 1 D).The levels of 3′-phosphorylated phosphoinositides were examined. The levels of PI 3-phosphate, PI 3,4-diphosphate, and PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate in AxCANCre-infected cells were 0.47, 0.66, and 0.31% of the total lipids, respectively, at 36 h after infection, whereas those in AxCANLacZ-infected cells were 0.27, 0.27, and 0.09. The elevation of levels of these phospholipids was higher than those in NGF-treated cells (the maximam level of PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate in NGF-treated cells was about 0.2% of total phospholipids (8Kimura K. Hattori S. Kabuyama Y. Shizawa Y. Takayanagi J. Nakamura S. Toki S. Matsuda Y. Onodera K. Fukui Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18961-18967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). These results suggest that PI 3-kinase activity is super-activated in the cells expressing the BD110 protein by Cre/loxP system.Morphological change of PC12Cre12 and PC12Cre20 cells after infection with AxCANCre was observed. After 2–3 days, they extended the processes (Fig. 2, A and B), whereas those infected with AxCANLacZ did not. We found that more than 40% of the cells bore processes and most of the rest cells responded to the AxCANCre infection to change cell shapes with the shorter processes. This indicates that the efficiency of infection was quite high. To confirm that the process formation was due to elevation of PI 3-kinase activity, the cells were treated with wortmannin, a selective inhibitor of PI 3-kinase (19Okada T. Sakuma L. Fukui Y. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3563-3567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanai N. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25846-25856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The process formation was completely blocked (Fig. 2 A, h and k), indicating that high PI 3-kinase activity is responsible for the process formation. We were able to maintain the cells bearing the processes more than 3 weeks. The BD110 protein was present even after cultivation for 3 weeks, suggesting that the BD110 protein did not affect the cell viability. However, the growth of the cells were somewhat slower after induction of the gene expression. This might explain why we were not able to obtain the BD110 expressing cells. Stimulation of the BD110 expressing cells with NGF resulted in formation of complete neurites longer than those induced without BD110 expression, suggesting that superactivation of PI 3-kinase enhances neurite elongation (data not shown).The processes induced by active PI 3-kinase were histochemically different from those induced by NGF treatment. It appeared that the tips of the processes were somewhat thinner than those induced by NGF and the growth cones were missing in the former. To view this in greater detail, we analyzed the reorganization of F-actin, microtubules, and GAP43 in the cells (Fig. 3). To synchronize the cell response, cells were treated with wortmannin for 48 h to allow the myc-BD110 protein to express in the absence of any effective PI 3-kinase activity. Subsequently, wortmannin was removed to uninhibit PI 3-kinase. After 3 h, cells altered their morphology with early outgrowth, and they extended processes rapidly after incubation for another 3 h in the absence of wortmannin. Accumulation of F-actin at the periphery of neurite growth cones induced by NGF was observed (Fig. 3, upper part). The processes formed by the induction of the BD110 protein did not show the accumulation of F-actin, suggesting that filopodia were not formed. In cultured neurons, GAP43 is localized in axons and growth cones (21Meiri K.F. Willard M. Johnson M.I. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2571-2581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Skene J.H. Jacobson R.D.

GAP43 was co-localized with F-actin at growth cones in NGF-stimulated PC12 cells. In contrast, GAP43 did not accumulate at the growth cone in BD110-expressing cells (Fig. 3, lower part). Instead, GAP43 was found in the cell body as granules. Microtubules stained more densely in BD110-expressing cells than in NGF-treated cells (Fig. 3, upper part). Treatment with colchicine, an inhibitor of polymerization of tubulin, inhibited the process formation, suggesting that this rich microtubule organization may be involved in this cell response (data not shown). It has been shown that microtubule depolymerization causes neurite retraction (25Heidemann S.R. Joshi H.C. Schechter A. Fletcher J.R. Bothwell M. J. Cell. Biol. 1985; 100: 916-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 26Joshi H.C. Chu D. Buxbaum R.E. Heidemann S.R. J. Cell. Biol. 1985; 101: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and inhibition of actin polymerization leads to tubulin expansion to lead abnormal outgrowth of neurites (26Joshi H.C. Chu D. Buxbaum R.E. Heidemann S.R. J. Cell. Biol. 1985; 101: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 27Forscher P. Smith S.J. J.

Our finding is consistent with these observations. It is possible that PI 3-kinase controls process elongation by regulating the organization of the cytoskeleton. The processes did not have the GAP43 antigen at the tips, suggesting that they were incomplete as neurites. In addition to the PI 3-kinase cascade, activation of other pathways such as MAP kinase and phospholipase C cascades, which are also activated by NGF stimulation, may be required for formation of complete neurites.Figure 3Staining of the cells for F-actin, microtubules, and GAP43 antigen. Cells were infected with AxCANCre and incubated for 48 h to allow the BD110 protein to express in the presence of 100 nm wortmannin. At 9 h after removal of wortmannin, cells were fixed and stained for F-actin, microtubules, and GAP43. For the controls, cells incubated for 36 h after NGF stimulation were also shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The signal transduction events following activation of PI 3-kinase were assessed. It has been suggested that PKB and JNK function downstream of PI 3-kinase (29Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 30Minden A.

Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar). MAP kinase was also a candidate that might be activated by PI 3-kinase, because activation of MAP kinase by NGF stimulation was partially inhibited by wortmannin (8Kimura K. Hattori S. Kabuyama Y. Shizawa Y. Takayanagi J. Nakamura S. Toki S. Matsuda Y. Onodera K. Fukui Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18961-18967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We examined activity of these three enzymes after expression of the BD110 protein. We detected activation JNK by NGF stimulation. The JNK activity was also higher in BD110-expressing cells than in the cells infected with the control virus, confirming that JNK is downstream of PI 3-kinase (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, MAP kinase activity was not elevated in BD110-expressing cells, although activation of MAP kinase was clearly seen after NGF stimulation (Fig. 4 B). This result suggests that the activity of MAP kinase is not controlled by the PI 3-kinase pathway. We also tested PKB. PKB was immunoprecipitated with anti-PKB antibody, and the kinase activity was analyzed using core histone as a substrate. Basal activity was readily detectable, but no further activation was seen after NGF stimulation. Consistent with this finding, no activation of the PKB was observed in BD110-expressing cells (Fig. 4 C). PKB might be regulated by the mechanism different from PI 3-kinase cascade such as phosphorylation in PC12 cells (33Andjelkovich M. Jakubowicz T. Cron P. Ming X.-F. Han J.-W. Hemmings B.A. Proc.

The cells were infected with AxCANCre or with AxCANLacZ (multiplicity of infection = 25) and incubated for the periods indicated in the figure.

A., in press.Google Scholar). The activation of JNK1 was clearly detected although that of JNK2 was rather subtle. The activation of PKB was not detected, which could be due to the high protein level and the extremely high basal activity of PKB in our PC12 cells. NGF stands for treatment of the cells with NGF (20 ng/ml) for the periods indicated in the figure.Cre, infection with AxCANCre;+ LacZ, infection with AxCANLacZ.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We have explored the effect of microinjection of the expression vector for the BD110 protein.2 Microinjected PC12 cells also extended processes with a rich network of microtubules. In this system, inhibition of MAP kinase and PKB cascades did not block process formation, whereas dominant negative mutants of Rac and SEK1/SAPK did, suggesting that the pathway to JNK through Rac is involved in the process formation.2 These findings are consistent with the result that JNK, not but MAP kinase and PKB, is activated by the induction of the BD110 protein in PC12 cells. The PC12, rat pheochromocytoma cell line provides a useful model system for the differentiation of neuronal cells. They respond to nerve growth factor (NGF) 1The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; MAP, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; JNK, Jun N-terminal kinase; PKB, protein kinase B. 1The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; MAP, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; JNK, Jun N-terminal kinase; PKB, protein kinase B. with growth arrest and exhibit typical characteristics of neuronal cells (1Halegoua S. Armstrong R.C. Kremer N.E. Curr. Topics Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 165: 119-170PubMed Google Scholar). After stimulation with NGF, a number of signaling pathways are activated, including the Ras-MAP kinase, phospholipase C, and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase cascades (2Chao M.V. Cell. 1992; 68: 995-997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In the setting of multiple activation of signaling pathways, it has been suggested that sustained activation of MAP kinase in particular is involved in the differentiation (3Muroya K. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 277-281PubMed Google Scholar, 4Qiu M.-S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Indeed, constitutive activation of MAP kinase by activated Ras or MAP kinase kinase results in full differentiation of the cells (5Noda M. Ko M. Ogura A. Liu D.-G. Amano T. Takano T. Ikawa Y. Nature. 1985; 318: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 6Guerrero I. Wong H. Pellicer A. Burstein D.E. J.

Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar). Besides this, we have shown that PI 3-kinase activity is required for neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (8Kimura K. Hattori S. Kabuyama Y. Shizawa Y. Takayanagi J. Nakamura S. Toki S. Matsuda Y. Onodera K. Fukui Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18961-18967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results suggested that the PI 3-kinase activity was required especially for the neurite elongation. The analysis of the levels of phosphoinositides in NGF-treated PC12 cells revealed that PI 3-kinase was strongly activated immediately after NGF treatment, and this activity declined rapidly. However, even long after the burst of PI 3-kinase activation, levels of the products of PI 3-kinase remained slightly higher than that of unstimulated cells (8Kimura K. Hattori S. Kabuyama Y.

The PI 3-kinase activated by NGF stimulation consists of two subunits, p85 and p110 (9Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). The regulatory subunit, p85, contains one SH3 domain and two SH2 domains, which may be involved in interaction with other proteins. The p85 subunit binds to p110 through the region between the two SH2 domains of p85 (iSH2) (10Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Fry M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M.

Biol. 1994; 14: 2675-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). P110 is the catalytic subunit, and p85 binding is necessary to achieve full catalytic activity. The addition of iSH2 to the N-terminal region of p110 through a bridge of glycine residues constitutively activates PI 3-kinase (12Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). We constructed a similar expression vector to analyze the effect of expression of the active PI 3-kinase in the cells.

The elevation of levels of these phospholipids was higher than those in NGF-treated cells (the maximam level of PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate in NGF-treated cells was about 0.2% of total phospholipids (8Kimura K.

In contrast, MAP kinase activity was not elevated in BD110-expressing cells, although activation of MAP kinase was clearly seen after NGF stimulation (Fig. 4 B). This result suggests that the activity of MAP kinase is not controlled by the PI 3-kinase pathway. We also tested PKB. PKB was immunoprecipitated with anti-PKB antibody, and the kinase activity was analyzed using core histone as a substrate. Basal activity was readily detectable, but no further activation was seen after NGF stimulation. Consistent with this finding, no activation of the PKB was observed in BD110-expressing cells (Fig. 4 C). PKB might be regulated by the mechanism different from PI 3-kinase cascade such as phosphorylation in PC12 cells (33Andjelkovich M. Jakubowicz T. Cron P. Ming X.-F. Han J.-W. Hemmings B.A. Proc.

The cells were infected with AxCANCre or with AxCANLacZ (multiplicity of infection = 25) and incubated for the periods indicated in the figure. The activities of JNK (A), MAP kinase (B), and PKB (C) were analyzed (36Konishi, M., Matsuzaki, H., Tanaka, M., Takemura, Y., Kuroda, S., Ono, Y., and Kikkana, U. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The activation of PKB was not detected, which could be due to the high protein level and the extremely high basal activity of PKB in our PC12 cells.

In this system, inhibition of MAP kinase and PKB cascades did not block process formation, whereas dominant negative mutants of Rac and SEK1/SAPK did, suggesting that the pathway to JNK through Rac is involved in the process formation.2 These findings are consistent with the result that JNK, not but MAP kinase and PKB, is activated by the induction of the BD110 protein in PC12 cells. The two cell lines, PC12Cre12 and PC12Cre20, were infected with adenoviruses. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the BD110 protein was detected at 24 h after infection, whereas the cells infected with AxCANLacZ, a control virus carrying β-galactosidase instead of Cre, did not produce the protein. Consistent with this, recombination of the gene to induce the BD110 protein was detected in the PCR analysis (Fig. 1 D). The levels of 3′-phosphorylated phosphoinositides were examined. The levels of PI 3-phosphate, PI 3,4-diphosphate, and PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate in AxCANCre-infected cells were 0.47, 0.66, and 0.31% of the total lipids, respectively, at 36 h after infection, whereas those in AxCANLacZ-infected cells were 0.27, 0.27, and 0.09. The elevation of levels of these phospholipids was higher than those in NGF-treated cells (the maximam level of PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate in NGF-treated cells was about 0.2% of total phospholipids (8Kimura K. Hattori S. Kabuyama Y. Shizawa Y. Takayanagi J. Nakamura S. Toki S. Matsuda Y. Onodera K. Fukui Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18961-18967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). These results suggest that PI 3-kinase activity is super-activated in the cells expressing the BD110 protein by Cre/loxP system. Morphological change of PC12Cre12 and PC12Cre20 cells after infection with AxCANCre was observed. After 2–3 days, they extended the processes (Fig. 2, A and B), whereas those infected with AxCANLacZ did not. We found that more than 40% of the cells bore processes and most of the rest cells responded to the AxCANCre infection to change cell shapes with the shorter processes. This indicates that the efficiency of infection was quite high. To confirm that the process formation was due to elevation of PI 3-kinase activity, the cells were treated with wortmannin, a selective inhibitor of PI 3-kinase (19Okada T. Sakuma L. Fukui Y. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3563-3567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanai N. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25846-25856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The process formation was completely blocked (Fig. 2 A, h and k), indicating that high PI 3-kinase activity is responsible for the process formation. We were able to maintain the cells bearing the processes more than 3 weeks. The BD110 protein was present even after cultivation for 3 weeks, suggesting that the BD110 protein did not affect the cell viability. However, the growth of the cells were somewhat slower after induction of the gene expression. This might explain why we were not able to obtain the BD110 expressing cells. Stimulation of the BD110 expressing cells with NGF resulted in formation of complete neurites longer than those induced without BD110 expression, suggesting that superactivation of PI 3-kinase enhances neurite elongation (data not shown). The processes induced by active PI 3-kinase were histochemically different from those induced by NGF treatment. It appeared that the tips of the processes were somewhat thinner than those induced by NGF and the growth cones were missing in the former. To view this in greater detail, we analyzed the reorganization of F-actin, microtubules, and GAP43 in the cells (Fig. 3). To synchronize the cell response, cells were treated with wortmannin for 48 h to allow the myc-BD110 protein to express in the absence of any effective PI 3-kinase activity. Subsequently, wortmannin was removed to uninhibit PI 3-kinase. After 3 h, cells altered their morphology with early outgrowth, and they extended processes rapidly after incubation for another 3 h in the absence of wortmannin. Accumulation of F-actin at the periphery of neurite growth cones induced by NGF was observed (Fig. 3, upper part). The processes formed by the induction of the BD110 protein did not show the accumulation of F-actin, suggesting that filopodia were not formed. In cultured neurons, GAP43 is localized in axons and growth cones (21Meiri K.F. Willard M. Johnson M.I. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2571-2581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Skene J.H. Jacobson R.D.

GAP43 was co-localized with F-actin at growth cones in NGF-stimulated PC12 cells. In contrast, GAP43 did not accumulate at the growth cone in BD110-expressing cells (Fig. 3, lower part). Instead, GAP43 was found in the cell body as granules. Microtubules stained more densely in BD110-expressing cells than in NGF-treated cells (Fig. 3, upper part). Treatment with colchicine, an inhibitor of polymerization of tubulin, inhibited the process formation, suggesting that this rich microtubule organization may be involved in this cell response (data not shown). It has been shown that microtubule depolymerization causes neurite retraction (25Heidemann S.R. Joshi H.C. Schechter A. Fletcher J.R. Bothwell M. J. Cell. Biol. 1985; 100: 916-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 26Joshi H.C. Chu D. Buxbaum R.E. Heidemann S.R. J. Cell. Biol. 1985; 101: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and inhibition of actin polymerization leads to tubulin expansion to lead abnormal outgrowth of neurites (26Joshi H.C. Chu D.

Our finding is consistent with these observations. It is possible that PI 3-kinase controls process elongation by regulating the organization of the cytoskeleton. The processes did not have the GAP43 antigen at the tips, suggesting that they were incomplete as neurites. In addition to the PI 3-kinase cascade, activation of other pathways such as MAP kinase and phospholipase C cascades, which are also activated by NGF stimulation, may be required for formation of complete neurites. The signal transduction events following activation of PI 3-kinase were assessed. It has been suggested that PKB and JNK function downstream of PI 3-kinase (29Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A.

MAP kinase was also a candidate that might be activated by PI 3-kinase, because activation of MAP kinase by NGF stimulation was partially inhibited by wortmannin (8Kimura K. Hattori S. Kabuyama Y.

Results show, for the first time, that the melatonin receptor mRNA is expressed in both the thymus and spleen. Moreover, the melatonin receptor mRNA was expressed in all the lymphocyte subpopulations (CD4+, CD8+, double positive, double negative, and B cells) studied from the rat thymus. The Southern blot analysis with the melatonin receptor probe and sequence data also showed the identity of the DNA fragments in thymus, spleen, and the lymphocyte subpopulations studied. The melatonin receptor fragments amplified from rat brain, thymus, and spleen share identical nucleotide sequences with the rat Mella-melatonin receptor subtype. No signal was obtained with primers used to amplify the rat Mel1b-melatonin receptor subtype in both thymus and spleen. Finally, the melatonin receptor mRNA transcript distribution throughout the rat thymus was examined. Using digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probe to the specific melatonin receptor mRNA, examination of the whole thymus revealed a clear hybridization signal in both cortex and medulla. Melatonin receptor gene expression in the thymus and spleen supports the notion of the immunomodulatory role of melatonin.—Pozo, D., Delgado, M., Fernandez-Santos, J. M., Calvo, J. R., Gomariz, R.

https://openalex.org/W2059807289,"Human neutrophils express two interleukin (IL)-8 receptors, CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR) 1 and CXCR2. IL-8 with changes to the NH2-terminal ELR motif can block IL-8-induced neutrophil functions (Moser, B., Dewald, B., Barella, L., Schumacher, C., Baggiolini, M., and Clark-Lewis, I. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 7125–7128). We have now examined the effect of NH2-terminally modified analogs of IL-8, GROα, and PF4 on CXCR1 and CXCR2 independently. Using stable Jurkat transfectants expressing either CXCR1 or CXCR2, it was shown that analogs derived from IL-8 bound both IL-8 receptors with similar affinity and could block IL-8-induced Ca2+ mobilization. By contrast, analogs of GROα and PF4, (R)GROα and (R)PF4, bound only CXCR2 with high affinity and blocked Ca2+ mobilization induced only via CXCR2. The differential effect on CXCR1 and CXCR2 was also demonstrated in studies with isolated neutrophils. Thus (R)GROα and (R)PF4 inhibited only the GROα but not the IL-8-stimulated elastase release, and these two analogs had no effect on IL-8-elicited superoxide generation, a response that is mediated by CXCR1 but not by CXCR2. These results show that CXCR2 selective receptor antagonists can be generated based upon the secondary binding determinants of GROα and PF4. They also highlight the primary importance of CXCR1 in chemokine-mediated release of granule enzymes and superoxide generation. The selective antagonists described may be used in future studies on IL-8 receptor signaling to define distinct steps leading to various functional responses induced in neutrophils via CXCR1 and CXCR2.

This pro-inflammatory protein belongs to a large family of structurally related chemotactic cytokines, termed chemokines, that are subdivided into two distinct groups, CXC chemokines, for which the first two cysteines are separated by one amino acid, and CC chemokines, for which these cysteines are adjacent (2Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar). Structure-function studies have demonstrated that the NH2-terminal sequence of IL-8 is essential for receptor binding and neutrophil activation. In particular, deletion or mutagenesis of the three residues, Glu4-Leu5-Arg6 (ELR motif), which immediately precede the first cysteine, leads to complete loss of biological activity (3Hébert C.A. Vitangcol R.V. Baker J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18989-18994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Clark-Lewis I. Schumacher C. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23128-23134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ELR motif is a characteristic feature of all CXC chemokines that act via IL-8 receptors. Besides IL-8 the members of this group include GROα, GROβ, GROγ, NAP-2, ENA-78, and GCP-2 (2Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar). Two high affinity IL-8 receptors, which according to revised nomenclature are now termed CXCR1 and CXCR2 instead of either IL-8R1 and 2 or IL-8RA and B, have previously been identified on human neutrophils (5Holmes W.E. Lee J. Kuang W.-J. Rice G.C. Wood W.I. Science. 1991; 253: 1278-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar, 6Murphy P.M. Tiffany H.L. Science. 1991; 253: 1280-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). These receptors belong to the G-protein-coupled seven transmembrane segment class (2Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv.

Both receptors bind IL-8 with high affinity (K d 0.5–3 nm); however, only CXCR2 binds the other neutrophil-activating and ELR motif-bearing chemokines with high affinity (8Moser B.

CXCR1 and CXCR2 share a high degree of sequence similarity within the membrane spanning domains but differ significantly within the extracellular and intracellular loops and the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains. These observations suggest that the two receptors not only possess distinct ligand-binding properties but also could transduce different post-receptor signals. The development of molecules that selectively block these receptors could lead to useful tools for the characterization of IL-8 receptor signaling. Previously we demonstrated that NH2-terminal truncation of IL-8 and amino acid modification of the ELR motif can lead to IL-8 receptor antagonists (1Moser B. Dewald B. Barella L. Schumacher C. Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7125-7128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we have examined NH2-terminally modified analogs of IL-8, GROα, and PF4 for inhibition of neutrophil function and selective binding to CXCR1 or CXCR2 bearing cells. Using this approach chemokine antagonists were identified that discriminate between the two IL-8 receptors and selectively block their function.

Antagonists were added 60 s before the stimulus. Human neutrophils were isolated from buffy coats of donor blood, supplied by the Swiss Central Laboratory Blood Transfusion Service, SRK, as described previously (17Peveri P. Walz A. Dewald B. Baggiolini M. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 1547-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Chemokine-mediated elastase release was assessed using cytochalasin-B (5 μg/ml)-pretreated neutrophils stimulated with either IL-8 or GROα in the presence or absence of an IL-8 receptor antagonist (10–10,000 nm) (17Peveri P. Walz A. Dewald B. Baggiolini M. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 1547-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Superoxide production was determined using a superoxide dismutase-inhibitable cytochrome c reduction assay (18Jones O.T.G. Hancock J.T. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 222-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, 106 cells/ml of Krebs-Ringer buffer were stimulated at 37 °C, and the reduction of cytochrome c(80 μm horse heart, type III) was monitored at 550–540 nm. Cells were treated with varying concentrations of antagonist and 60 s later stimulated with 25 nm IL-8. The production of superoxide was quantified using an extinction coefficient of 19.1 mm−1 × cm−1 (18Jones O.T.G. Hancock J.T. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 222-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells transfected with cDNA corresponding to either CXCR1 or CXCR2 have previously been shown to transmit signals for the mobilization of cytosolic free Ca2+, chemotaxis, and the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase in response to IL-8 (13Loetscher P. Seitz M. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar,14Jones S.A. Moser B. Thelen M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I both transfected receptors have similar affinity for IL-8 with K d values ranging between 5 and 10 nm. The number of binding sites expressed on the two cell types is also similar, 13,300 ± 3,500 and 16,000 ± 4,500 per cell for CXCR1 and CXCR2 transfectants, respectively. These results indicate that Jurkat cells expressing either CXCR1 or CXCR2 are suitable for the characterization of specific IL-8 receptor antagonists. NH2-terminally modified analogs of IL-8 had previously been shown to antagonize the effects of IL-8 on human neutrophils (1Moser B. Dewald B. Barella L. Schumacher C. Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7125-7128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here the effect of several truncated CXC chemokines on CXCR1 and CXCR2 was tested to establish potential receptor preferences. The derivatives used are listed in Table I. (R)IL-8,NMeLeu designates an IL-8 analog with anN-methylated leucine at position 25, a modification that prevented dimer formation in IL-8(4–72) (12Rajarathnam K. Sykes B.D. Kay C.M. Dewald B. Geiser T. Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I. Science. 1994; 264: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The monomeric analog was similar in efficacy as (R)IL-8. (ELR)PF4 is a previously described variant of PF4 with the NH2-terminal sequence preceding the first cysteine replaced by ELR. In contrast to native PF4, (ELR)PF4 has potent neutrophil activating properties (19Clark-Lewis I. Dewald B. Geiser T. Moser B. Baggiolini M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3574-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Competition binding studies performed with the transfectants showed that (R)IL-8, (R)IL-8,NMeLeu, and (AAR)IL-8 compete equally well for 125I-IL-8 binding to CXCR1 and CXCR2, although (AAR)IL-8 appears to possess a slightly higher affinity for CXCR2 than CXCR1. This is consistent with the behavior of IL-8, which binds with high affinity to both receptors. In contrast, (R)GROα and (R)PF4 competed for 125I-IL-8 binding to CXCR2, with K d values comparable to those observed for (R)IL-8 but were unable to displace 125I-IL-8 from CXCR1 (Table I and Fig. 1). The agonist (ELR)PF4 bound with high affinity to CXCR2 only. This indicates binding to CXCR2 but not to CXCR1. In this respect the PF4 analogs are similar to the GRO proteins. All the antagonists that we have examined here possess an arginine residue immediately preceding the first cysteine (Table I). This arginine is essential for the agonist activity of IL-8 and cannot be substituted with other amino acids (19Clark-Lewis I. Dewald B. Geiser T. Moser B. Baggiolini M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3574-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). IL-8 analogs in which the integrity of the arginine in the ELR has been lost no longer bind to receptors. This has also been demonstrated with the PF4 agonist or antagonist that as shown here bind only CXCR2. We therefore conclude that the RCXC motif is required for the binding of the antagonists to both receptors and that a second binding domain determines the selectivity for CXCR1 or CXCR2. In agreement with this suggestion, evolutionary distance analysis of CXC chemokines, based upon sequence comparisons, shows that GROα and PF4, the parent molecules of (R)GROα and (R)PF4 which are selective for CXCR2, are more closely related to each other than to IL-8 (19Clark-Lewis I. Dewald B. Geiser T. Moser B. Baggiolini M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3574-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Evidence for the involvement of the secondary binding domain in receptor selectivity was also obtained in recent structure-activity studies using mutations of human and rabbit IL-8 and mutants of IL-8 and GROα (20Schraufstätter I.U.

To demonstrate the receptor preference of the modified derivatives at the level of signaling and to establish their antagonistic properties, the effects on IL-8-mediated Ca2+ mobilization were determined. Fura-2-loaded Jurkat transfectants were treated with increasing concentrations (50–1000 nm) of the analog under test and were then stimulated with 50 nm IL-8. Addition of the analogs elicited no [Ca2+] i response, as shown for (R)GROα and (AAR)IL-8 in Fig. 2 A, indicating that they lack agonistic effects. The subsequent response to IL-8, however, was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by all analogs when CXCR2-transfected cells were used, which is consistent with their action as antagonists. In CXCR1 transfectants no inhibition was observed with (R)GROα and (R)PF4 confirming their selectivity for CXCR2 (Fig. 2). A characteristic response of neutrophils stimulated by IL-8 and related chemokines is the release of granule enzymes (17Peveri P. Walz A. Dewald B. Baggiolini M. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 1547-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 22Walz A. Dewald B. von Tscharner V. Baggiolini M. J. Exp.

Chem. 1993; 268: 15419-15424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This process can be elicited by stimulation via CXCR1 or CXCR2 (24Jones S.A. Wolf M. Qin S.X. Mackay C.R. Baggiolini M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6682-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). We have determined the effect of the analogs on the release of elastase by neutrophils stimulated with IL-8 (10 nm) or GROα (30 nm). At 30 nm, GROα acts exclusively via CXCR2 (10Schumacher C. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10542-10546Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Treatment of the neutrophils with (AAR)IL-8, (R)IL-8,NMeLeu, (R)GROα, or (R)PF4 alone did not stimulate elastase release (data not shown); however, all four antagonists markedly inhibited the release induced by GROα (Fig.3). In contrast, only (AAR)IL-8 and (R)IL-8,NMeLeu inhibited the response mediated by IL-8. These results demonstrate that (R)PF4 and (R)GROα selectively block CXCR2 and that stimulation of CXCR1 alone is sufficient for mediating exocytosis induced by IL-8. This observation is in agreement with our recent finding that CXCR2-specific monoclonal antibodies block elastase release in response to GROα but not in response to IL-8 (24Jones S.A. Wolf M. Qin S.X. Mackay C.R. Baggiolini M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6682-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). IL-8 induces superoxide production in human neutrophils through the activation of the NADPH oxidase (25Thelen M. Peveri P. Kernen P. von Tscharner V. Walz A. Baggiolini M. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2702-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 26Thelen M. Dewald B. Baggiolini M. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 797-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). By measuring the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c, we found that the rate of superoxide production in response to 25 nmIL-8 could be inhibited by prior addition of (AAR)IL-8 or (R)IL-8,NMeLeu. In contrast no effect was observed with (R)PF4 and (R)GROα which act on CXCR2 (Fig. 4). We have previously shown that the generation of superoxide in response to IL-8 is mediated only by CXCR1 (24Jones S.A. Wolf M. Qin S.X. Mackay C.R. Baggiolini M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6682-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The present data extend this observation and emphasize the primary role of CXCR1 in the activation of the respiratory burst. Moreover, the results suggest that antagonists can be used to selectively block neutrophil functions; for example (R)GROα does not affect the respiratory burst but inhibits other activities, as described above. The results of this study show that receptor antagonists can be generated that are selective both at the receptor and functional level. (R)GROα and (R)PF4 are selective antagonists for CXCR2, the receptor that has high affinity for all neutrophil-activating chemokines. Since both antagonists discriminate between the two IL-8 receptors, as shown for superoxide production and elastase release, they can be used to further investigate the differences in the signal transduction pathways of CXCR1 and CXCR2 in neutrophils. As a next step it will be important to find antagonists that are specific for CXCR1. Our results indicate that such antagonists would allow the selective inhibition of the respiratory burst without affecting other neutrophil responses like chemotaxis and granule enzyme release. Furthermore, by combining specific antagonists with signal transduction inhibitors, it may be possible to selectively control the functions of neutrophils.

High affinity sodium-coupled neurotransmitter transport plays a major role in the maintenance of low synaptic levels of the transmitter (for a review, see Ref. 1Kanner B.I. Schuldiner S. CRC Crit.

Direct proof of this has been obtained recently for the dopamine transporter, using homozygous mice in which this transporter was disrupted (2Giros B. Jaber M. Jones S.R. Wightman R.M. Caron M.G.

It is the prototype of a large superfamily of sodium- and chloride-dependent transporters of neurotransmitters.

Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 265-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). GAT-1 catalyzes the electrogenic transport of GABA with one chloride and two sodium ions (6Keynan S.

Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Using site-directed mutagenesis we have attempted to identify amino acid residues of GAT-1 involved in substrate binding. Since GABA is a zwitterionic molecule and the cosubstrates are charged species, we have changed the charged and conserved residues likely to be located in the membrane. This revealed that arginine 69 is critical for transport (9Pantanowitz S. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3222-3225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although we also identified a critical negatively charged residue, glutamate 101 (10Keshet G. Bendahan A. Su H. Mager S. Lester H.A. Kanner B.I. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), it is not clear that it is located in the membrane. Other residues that may interact with positively charged substrates, such as sodium ions or the amino group of the neurotransmitter, are aromatic amino acids, which could do so by virtue of their π electrons (11Sussman J.L.

In a previous study we have modified the tryptophan residues of GAT-1 thought to be located in the membrane (14Kleinberger-Doron N. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3063-3067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Even though two important tryptophans were identified, it is now clear that they are not directly involved in substrate binding (15Mager S. Kleinberger-Doron N. Keshet G. Davidson N. Kanner B.I.

In this study we have modified the tyrosine residues of GAT-1, which are thought to be located in the membrane and are conserved throughout the superfamily. We have identified one residue, tyrosine 140, which is critical for transport and does not tolerate replacement to other aromatic residues. Transporters in which the residue is replaced by phenylalanine (Y140F) or tryptophan (Y140W) still exhibit sodium and chloride binding but appear to be impaired selectively in the binding of GABA. The stringent conservation of the tyrosine suggests that it may interact with a moiety common to all substrates of the family, namely the amino group.

Size standards (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) were run in parallel and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Reconstitution of transport was done as follows. For each experiment infected/transfected cells from two large wells (35-mm diameter) were used for each mutant. They were washed twice with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and taken up in a small volume of phosphate-buffered saline using a rubber policeman. To 35 μl of this suspension were added (in this order) 15 μl of 0.1m KPi (pH 7.5) and 10 μl of 20% cholic acid (neutralized by NaOH). After 10 min of incubation on ice, the mixture was reconstituted with asolectin/brain lipids using spin columns, and transport was measured exactly as described (23Radian R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

The cDNAs encoding GAT-1 and the mutants Y140F and Y140W were subcloned in the oocyte expression vector pOG, which contains a 5′-untranslated Xenopus β-globin sequence and a 3′-poly(A) signal). Capped cRNAs transcribed from these constructs were injected into stage V–VI Xenopus oocytes (50 ng/oocyte), and membrane currents were recorded 2–3 days later (15Mager S. Kleinberger-Doron N.

In substitution experiments sodium ions were replaced with equimolar choline or lithium, and chloride was replaced by acetate. Two microelectrode voltage clamp recordings were performed at 22 °C with a Geneclamp 500 interfaced to an IBM-compatible PC using a Digidata 1200 A/D controlled using the pCLAMP 6.0 program suite (Axon Instruments). The data were acquired at 2 kHz and low pass filtered at 1 kHz. Microelectrodes were filled with 3 m KCl solution and had resistances of <1 megohm. In Cl− substitution experiments, a 3 m KCl-agar bridge connected the recording chamber to a 3 m KCl reservoir containing an Ag/AgCl electrode. Records shown are typical and representative of experiments done with four or five independent oocytes. Blockade by SKF 100330A was reversible but required extensive washout periods (>5 min). Fig. 1 shows the position of the 12 conserved tyrosine residues, predicted to be located in the membrane according to the theoretical topological model (4Guastella J. Nelson N. Nelson H. Czyzyk L.

Tyrosine residues 72, 86, 140, 309, and 475 located in respective transmembrane domains I, II, III, VI, and X, are totally conserved in all known members of the superfamily. The others are mostly aromatic in the majority of the transporters. Using site-directed mutagenesis each of these residues was changed to serine. After the mutations were verified by sequencing, the mutant cDNAs were expressed in HeLa cells using the recombinant vaccinia/T7 virus (18Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar) as described (19Keynan S. Suh Y.-J. Kanner B.I. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1974-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The results of sodium-dependent [3H]GABA transport of the mutants are shown in Fig. 2. Replacement of each of the five residues 241, 246, 248, 296, and 432 by serine results in transporters that exhibit significant activity. Because of the very different nature of the side chains of tyrosine and serine, we conclude that these five residues are not essential for sodium- and chloride-dependent GABA transport. It is of interest to note that all of the fully conserved tyrosines are included in the remaining seven in which replacement by serine severely compromises transport. Each of these seven tyrosines was then also changed to the other aromatic amino acids, phenylalanine and tryptophan. The results are shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that in six out of the seven cases at least one of the aromatic replacement mutants exhibits significant transport of [3H]GABA. Only in the case of tyrosine 140 are both replacement mutants, Y140F and Y140W, totally devoid of any detectable transport activity. These mutations were subcloned back into the wild type background. Sequencing of the subcloned mutant cDNA fragments from both sides was then performed to ensure that only the indicated mutation had occurred without any additional changes. Reexamination of the subcloned Y140F and Y140W transporters showed that their phenotype, lack of detectable sodium-dependent [3H]GABA transport, was maintained (not shown).d,l-[3,4-3H]Nipecotic acid, a ring constrained analog of GABA, is also transported by wild type GAT-1 in a sodium-dependent fashion but not by Y140F- and Y140W-GAT-1 transporters (data not shown).Figure 5Sodium-dependent transient currents mediated by wild type (wt) and mutant transporters. Transient currents were recorded in the presence and the absence of sodium (choline substitution) in oocytes expressing wild type (panel A) and Y140F (panel C) and Y140W (panel D) transporters as well as in noninjected oocytes (panel B). The voltage was jumped from a holding potential of −30 mV to potentials ranging from −120 to +30 mV. The duration of each pulse was 500 ms. Following reperfusion with sodium solutions after choline, complete recovery of the transient currents was observed (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 1Hypothetical secondary structure of the GAT-1 transport protein.

Wild type GAT-1 and Y140F- and Y140W-GAT-1 mutant transporters were expressed in HeLa cells, labeled with [35S]methionine, and immunoprecipitated by an antibody raised against a peptide located in the carboxyl terminus of GAT-1. The transporter is detected in three major forms: a monomer running as a band of ∼65 kDa, a more abundant dimer, and a high molecular mass aggregate (Fig. 4, lane 1). In addition, a faster running minor band can be visualized (Fig. 4) which corresponds to the transporter that has not been glycosylated (20Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). No transporter is detected in HeLa cells transfected with the vector alone (Fig. 4,lane 2). In contrast each of the two mutants, Y140F- and Y140W-GAT-1, express high transporter levels (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4). Because the mutants still produce normal transporter levels it is possible that they are targeted inefficiently to the plasma membrane. One would expect that cells expressing a mistargeted mutant transporter that is intrinsically active would have cryptic transport activity. Detergent extraction of the cells expressing such a transporter followed by reconstitution of the solubilized proteins is likely to yield transport activity even if they were originally residing in internal membranes. In fact, such cryptic transport activity has been observed using this assay with some mutants of GAT-1 (14Kleinberger-Doron N. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3063-3067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kanner B.I. Bendahan A. Pantanowitz S. Su H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and of the glutamate transporter GLT-1 (26Zhang Y. Pines G. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19573-19577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both mutant transporters remain completely void of activity after solubilization and reconstitution, in contrast to the wild type (data not shown). The above results indicate that mutant transporters Y140F and Y140W have an intrinsic defect in the transport process itself. We used an electrophysiological approach monitoring partial reactions of the translocation cycle to pinpoint the defect in the mutant transporters. One such reaction is the binding of sodium to the transporter, which can be monitored as a sodium-dependent transient current observed after changing the membrane potential (8Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 15Mager S. Kleinberger-Doron N. Keshet G. Davidson N. Kanner B.I. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5405-5414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is exemplified in Fig. 5. Oocytes expressing GAT-1 are held at a membrane potential of −30 mV in a sodium-containing medium. Subsequently the membrane potential is jumped to a range of potentials varying from +30 mV (Fig. 5 A, upper trace) to −120 mV (Fig. 5 A, lower trace). In oocytes expressing GAT-1, slow current relaxations (time constants 70–130 ms) were observed following voltage jumps, and these transient currents were greatly attenuated by replacement of sodium with choline (Fig.5 A). These currents are distinct from the rapidly decaying membrane capacitance and are presumed to reflect transporter-mediated charge movements associated with sodium binding (8Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 15Mager S. Kleinberger-Doron N. Keshet G. Davidson N. Kanner B.I. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5405-5414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Uninjected control oocytes did not display this slow sodium-dependent relaxation (Fig. 5 B). Analogous sodium-dependent transient currents were also observed in oocytes expressing the GAT-1 mutant Y140F and Y140W transporters (Fig. 5, C andD). In oocytes expressing the mutant transporter Y140W, the sodium-dependent transient current displayed slightly faster relaxation, with time constants ranging from 40–80 ms, whereas the relaxation times of the Y140F mutant were unchanged from wild type GAT-1. In addition to sodium, chloride ion also interacted with both the mutant wild type transporters. As reported previously (15Mager S. Kleinberger-Doron N. Keshet G. Davidson N. Kanner B.I. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5405-5414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), wild type GAT-1 exhibits a GABA-independent and lithium-dependent leak current that is increased by the presence of chloride ions (Fig.6). An analogous lithium-dependent current was observed in oocytes expressing the Y140F and Y140W mutant transporters, and this current was increased in the presence of chloride (Fig. 6). These results demonstrate that the mutant transporters Y140F and Y140W retain both the lithium-dependent leak current and the ability to bind chloride seen in the wild type transporter. The sodium-dependent charge movements induced by voltage jumps are inhibited by nontransported GABA analogs (8Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). This is exemplified for wild type GAT-1 (Fig. 7 A), which shows the transient current blocked by SKF 100330A at 30 μm, a concentration 2 orders of magnitude above its apparent K i for blocking GABA transport (27Ali F.E. Blondinell W.E. Dandridge P.A. Frazer J.S. Garvey E. Girrard G.R. Kaiser C. Ku T.W. Lafferty J.J. Moonsammy G.I. Oh H.-J. Rush J.A. Settler P.E. Stringer D.D. Vinslavsky J.W. Volpe B.W. Yunger L.M. Zishle C.L. J. Med. Chem. 1985; 28: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, 30 μm SKF 100330A blocked 98.0 ± 0.4% (n = 3) of the off charge movement induced by stepping from −120 to −30 mV (Fig. 8 A). In contrast, SKF 100330A was significantly less efficacious at blocking the charge movements in the Y140F transporter, 33.9 ± 7.2% (n = 3), as illustrated in Figs. 7 and 8, panels C. Increasing the concentration of the inhibitor to 100 μm blocked 63% of the charge movement (n= 2). This difference in potency was even greater in the Y140W mutant, in which 100 μm SKF 100330A blocked only 1.9 ± 1.0% (n = 4) of the charge movement (Figs. 7 and 8,panels D). GABA itself, when added in a sodium chloride-containing medium, induces a steady-state transport current in the wild type (Fig.9 A). In agreement with the tracer flux data (Fig. 3), GABA is not able to induce a transport current in the mutants (Fig. 9, B and C). Moreover, it is not even capable of inhibiting a transient current (Fig. 9, B andC). Thus, not only is GABA not transported by the mutant transporters, it is not even able to bind to them. In this paper we have identified a tyrosine residue, which is critical for sodium- and chloride-dependent GABA recognition and transport. Out of the 12 conserved residues, tyrosine 140 is the only one that does not tolerate replacement to either phenylalanine or tryptophan (Fig. 3). This is neither due to reduced synthesis (Fig. 4) nor to reduced targeting (Figs. 5, 6, 7). The electrophysiological (Figs. 5, 6, 7, 8) data clearly show the presence of sodium-dependent transient currents and chloride-dependent leak currents of lithium, strongly indicating that the mutant transporters are localized in the plasma membrane and that the structural elements critical for forming the transporter pore are intact. They strongly point to a defective GABA binding in the mutants. Not only are GABA and nipecotic acid not transported, GABA is not able to suppress the capacitative transient sodium current in Y140F- and Y140W-GAT-1 as it does in the wild type (Fig. 9). This is also supported by the total inability of SKF 100330A to suppress the clearly existent sodium transient in Y140W-GAT-1 (Figs.5 D, 7 D, and 8 D). This compound is a derivative of the GABA analog guvacine to which via the nitrogen atom a diphenylbutenyl group has been attached (27Ali F.E. Blondinell W.E. Dandridge P.A. Frazer J.S. Garvey E. Girrard G.R. Kaiser C. Ku T.W. Lafferty J.J. Moonsammy G.I. Oh H.-J. Rush J.A. Settler P.E. Stringer D.D. Vinslavsky J.W. Volpe B.W. Yunger L.M. Zishle C.L. J. Med. Chem. 1985; 28: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The observation that the blocker still has some effect, albeit diminished, on the transient current of Y140F-GAT-1 indicates that the mutation does not cause a sterical alteration of the binding pocket for GABA. Although far from clear, its limited ability to interact with Y140F, but not with Y140W-GAT-1, could perhaps be due to an interaction of one of the phenyl groups of SKF 100330A with the introduced phenylalanine at the 140 position. In view of the total conservation of the tyrosine residue in the superfamily of transporters, it is tempting to speculate that it interacts with a structural element common to all of the transported solutes. This would be the amino group that is common to both kinds of substrates: amino acids and biogenic amines. In fact, a mutant form of the serotonin transporter in which the equivalent tyrosine (tyrosine 176) was replaced with cysteine has decreased affinity for both serotonin and cocaine. Moreover, residual binding of a cocaine analog to this mutant is blocked by chemical modification of the cysteine at position 176. 3J.-G. Chen and G. Rudnick, personal communication. The fact that Y140F-GAT-1 is totally void of transport (Figs. 3 and 9 B) suggests that it is the oxygen atom, which is critical perhaps via the formation of a hydrogen bond with an amine hydrogen. Several amino acid residues/regions of the transporters have been implicated in neurotransmitter binding. Tryptophan 222 of GAT-1 is one example (14Kleinberger-Doron N. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3063-3067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but recent data indicate a highly reducedV max of GABA transport but an increased affinity for it in tryptophan 222 mutants. 4S. Mager, unpublished results. The extracellular loops of GAT-1 also have been implicated (28Tamura S. Nelson H. Tamura A. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28712-28715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), but it is very possible that they function as a selectivity filter. In the dopamine transporter it has been suggested that aspartic acid 79 located in the postulated first transmembrane domain and serines 356 and 359 located in seventh are involved in binding of the amine (29Kitayama S. Shimada S. Xu H. Markham L. Donovan D.M. Uhl G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7782-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). These residues are conserved among the three biogenic amine transporters, and it is possible, but not proven, that in these cases they play, together with tyrosine 140, a role in neurotransmitter binding. At this time it not possible to speculate on which other residues might be involved in the liganding of GABA or other transmitters. The theoretical model of the topology (4Guastella J. Nelson N. Nelson H. Czyzyk L. Keynan S. Miedel M.C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kanner B.I. Science. 1990; 249: 1303-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar) may not be in harmony with novel experimental data (20Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 30Olivares L. Aragon C. Gimenez C. Zafra F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1211-1217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Until the topology is firmly resolved, it is impossible to know which other group might be located close by tyrosine 140. It is also difficult to speculate on the identity of residues interacting with the carboxyl group of GABA. One possibility is that the determinants on some of the external loops are involved (28Tamura S. Nelson H. Tamura A. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28712-28715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These are located in the carboxyl-terminal half of the transporter. Interestingly, studies with chimeric biogenic amine transporters indicate that regions involved in the recognition of the biogenic amines are located in transmembrane domains 5–8 and even more toward the carboxyl terminus (31Buck K.J. Amara S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12584-12588Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 32Buck K.J. Amara S.G. Mol.

It is anticipated that further mutagenesis studies focusing on these regions may shed further light on the determinants for neurotransmitter binding."

Cyclic nucleotides are second messengers involved in a variety of cellular responses to hormones, light, and neurotransmitters. Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) 1The abbreviations used are: PDE, phosphodiesterase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; HA, influenza hemagglutinin; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s). play a role in signal transduction by regulating the cellular concentrations of cyclic nucleotides (reviewed in Ref. 1Beavo J.A.

In addition to the diverse properties of the seven known families of cyclic nucleotide PDEs, PDEs of various families exhibit extensive isozyme diversity, which is derived from the existence of several genes within a family and is compounded by extensive alternative mRNA splicing most prevalent and well documented in the cases of the cAMP-specific PDEs (PDE4) and the calcium, calmodulin-regulated PDEs (PDE1; Refs. 1Beavo J.A.

While the functional consequences of this diversity are not fully understood, differences in tissue-specific expression and alternative splicing patterns have profound effects not only on tissue distribution of PDEs, but also on their subcellular localization, their kinetic properties, and on their sensitivity to cofactors (1Beavo J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar, 6Hansen R.S. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14636-14645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sharma R.K.

Six of the PDE families were identified biochemically as activities fractionated from various tissues and cultured cell lines (1Beavo J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar). The seventh family of PDEs consists of a single gene encoding a high affinity cAMP-specific PDE, named HCP1 (designatedPDE7A). PDE7A was isolated in a genetic screen for complementation of defects of yeast cells deficient in cAMP PDEs (5Michaeli T. Bloom T.J. Martins T. Loughney K. Ferguson K. Riggs M. Rodgers L. Beavo J.A. Wigler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12925-12932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical characterization demonstrated the high affinity cAMP-specific PDE activity of PDE7A and its insensitivity to potent selective inhibitors of known PDE families. The presence of PDE7A-like activities in cell lines derived from T cells, and their absence from cell lines derived from B cells, was subsequently noted (21Ichimura M. Kase H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Coupled with its distinct amino acid sequence, these biochemical and pharmacologic properties established PDE7A as a member of a novel, uncharacterized, PDE family. Among adult human tissues PDE7A is most abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle, and its mRNA is detectable in most tissues examined thus far (5Michaeli T. Bloom T.J. Martins T. Loughney K. Ferguson K. Riggs M. Rodgers L. Beavo J.A. Wigler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12925-12932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 3.8-kb PDE7A mRNA is expressed in skeletal muscle and heart, and a 4.2-kb mRNA is found in the brain, lung, kidney, and pancreas. The HCP1 cDNA isolated in the yeast screen is a partial clone derived from the 4.2-kb mRNA species found in human U118 glioblastoma cells. We report the isolation of a human PDE7A cDNA derived from the skeletal muscle mRNA and the identification ofPDE7A-encoded proteins. This skeletal muscle mRNA encodes an N-terminal alternatively spliced PDE7A isoform. We demonstrate that alternative splicing regulates the subcellular localization of PDE7A-encoded proteins. A human skeletal muscle cDNA library (Clontech) was screened using established procedures (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 46-52Google Scholar) with nick-translated [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probe derived from the 5′ end ofHCP1 (0.4-kb NotI-BglII fragment) and mixed with a 150 trace of the 0.3-kbBglII-EcoRI fragment of HCP1. Three classes of overlapping clones, which together span the entirePDE7A2 open reading frame and the polyadenylated 3′-untranslated region, were isolated (represented by HSM4, -7, and -14). The inserts from these phage isolates were subcloned into pKS (Stratagene) and were subjected to bidirectional fluorescent dideoxy chain termination nucleotide sequencing using the ABI373A automated sequencer. A 1.5-kb DNA fragment of the HSM7 cDNA was cloned into the yeast expression vector pAD4Δ, containing the ADH1 promoter, a 2 μ replication origin, and the LEU2 selectable marker (pADHSM7). The nucleotide sequence of HSM7 (HSPDE7A2) was submitted to GenBank™. Fetal tissues were obtained from the late first and second trimester terminations of pregnancy and were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen at the time of harvesting. This study was approved by the Committee on Clinical Investigations of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and written informed consent was obtained from all mothers for the donation of fetal tissues. Total tissue RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and established methods (23Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63189) Google Scholar). Ten μg of RNA was fractionated on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred onto a nylon membrane (GeneScreen Plus, NEN Life Science Products). Hybridization was performed at 42 °C using nick-translated [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probes under hybridization conditions, stringent washing procedures, and probe stripping protocols described by Michaeli et al. (5Michaeli T. Bloom T.J. Martins T. Loughney K. Ferguson K. Riggs M. Rodgers L. Beavo J.A. Wigler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12925-12932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were first hybridized to a 1.2-kb NotI-EcoRIHCP1 fragment probe, and after probe stripping to a 0.75-kbPstI-XbaI human GAPDH fragment probe. Blots were subjected to autoradiography onto X-Omat film and onto a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and were quantitated using the NIH Image program. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on 5 μg of RNA prepared from human fetal tissues according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Controls lacking reverse transcriptase were included in the reactions. To verify the structure of the 5′ end of the PDE7A2 mRNA the following oligonucleotides were used: for reverse transcription, oligo(dT); 724 (GGCCTGAGTAACATCCGC) (nt 752); and 22-1-9 (AGAGACAGACACTTCAAT) (nt 390). Oligonucleotides used for PCR amplification were: the 5′ oligonucleotide 7+2 (GGGATCACTGTTGGAAGG) (nt 2–19) was used in all reactions, and it was paired with the following 3′ oligonucleotides: oligonucleotide 7-1 (AGAGACAGACACTTCAAT) (nt 140) to give a 139-bp PCR product and with oligonucleotide 250 (GGCCTGAGTAACATCCGC) (nt 278) to give a 277-bp PCR product. As a positive control the 5′ oligonucleotide 256 (nt 284) was paired with oligonucleotide 724 (nt 752) to give a 469-bp PCR product. To determine the presence of the PDE7A1 and -2 mRNAs in RNA prepared from fetal tissues by reverse transcriptase PCR the following oligonucleotides were used: the 3′ oligonucleotide 22-1-9 was used in all reactions, and it was paired with the 5′ PDE7A2oligonucleotide 7+2 to give a 391-bp PCR product specific toPDE7A2 and with the 5′ PDE7A1 oligonucleotide 22Met1 (5Michaeli T. Bloom T.J. Martins T. Loughney K. Ferguson K. Riggs M. Rodgers L. Beavo J.A. Wigler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12925-12932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to give a 311-bp PCR product specific toPDE7A1. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum was generated against a 15-amino acid-long synthetic peptide derived from the C terminus of PDE7A (CELNSQLLTQENRLS, Cys added for coupling) which was coupled to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin. This antiserum detects both PDE7A splice variants. Anti-PDE7A antibodies were purified from serum by affinity chromatography on a PDE7A peptide-Sepharose 4B column. Four independent sets of various fetal tissues were homogenized in extraction buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin A, and 10 mm benzamidine. Following low speed clarification (1000 × g) the homogenates were fractionated to soluble and particulate fractions by high speed centrifugation at 100,000 × g. The particulate fraction was washed with 2 ml of extraction buffer and fractionated by low and high speed centrifugation as above. Lactate dehydrogenase assays demonstrated that the soluble fractions of skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, and lung contained 95–98%, and those of brain extracts contained 85%, of the total cellular lactate dehydrogenase activity. The soluble fractions of skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, and lung contained 75–85% of the cellular 57-kDa PDE7A protein. The soluble fractions of brain extracts contained 55%, while particulate brain fractions contained 45% of the 57-kDa PDE7A protein. Sixty to one-hundred twenty μg of protein samples were fractionated by 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (NEN Life Science Products). Membranes were processed as described previously for detection with125I-protein A (24Michaeli T. Field J. Ballester R. O'Neill K. Wigler M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3039-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and according to the specifications provided with the ECL detection system (Amersham Corp.). Briefly, after blocking membranes were probed with 1:500 dilution of affinity-purified anti-PDE7A antibodies or with anti-PDE7A antibodies that were preincubated with one μg of the PDE7A C-terminal peptide. Washed membranes were subsequently incubated with either125I-protein A or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies. Total yeast cell extracts were prepared as described (5Michaeli T. Bloom T.J. Martins T. Loughney K. Ferguson K. Riggs M. Rodgers L. Beavo J.A. Wigler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12925-12932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PDE activity was determined with variable concentrations of cAMP or of cGMP as a substrate as described previously (25Colicelli J. Birchmeier C. Michaeli T. O'Neill K. Riggs M. Wigler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3599-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Cyclic AMP or cGMP concentrations ranged from 2 × 10−8 to 5 × 10−6m. Each data point represents measurements of initial rates at a suitable enzyme dilution. Extracts of 10DAB cells bearing the HSM7 expression vector (ADHSM7) as well as control extracts of cells bearing the empty expression vector pAD4Δ were assayed. The cAMP PDE activity of PDE7A2 at 5 × 10−7m cAMP was only marginally affected (±20%) when assayed in the presence of 10−7 to 10−4m cGMP or in the presence of 10−8 to 10−4m rolipram (Biomol). To gain insight into the structure of the 3.8-kb PDE7A mRNA, we isolated a human skeletal muscle PDE7A cDNA using a probe encompassing the 5′ end of the HCP1 coding region. One class of cDNAs isolated in this screen, represented by HSM7, contained novel 5′ sequences that provide an initiator methionine and an N terminus, which is distinct from the one previously reported forHCP1 (Fig. 1). The initiator methionine of HSM7 is preceded by an in-frame termination codon at position −123. The sequence of the HSM7 5′ end was confirmed by reverse transcriptase PCR analysis of fetal skeletal muscle RNA, which was followed by determination of the DNA sequence of the amplified product (see “Experimental Procedures”). While the 5′ end and the N terminus of HSM7 are unique, the remainder of the HSM7 sequence is identical to that of HCP1 throughout the coding region, the 3′-untranslated region, and the polyadenylation site. Thus, human skeletal muscle PDE7A mRNA, represented by the 3.1-kb HSM7 cDNA, and the glioblastoma cell-derived transcript represented by HCP1, are alternatively spliced transcripts ofPDE7A. The published HCP1 transcript is therefore designated HSPDE7A1, and the skeletal muscle splice variant HSM7 is designated HSPDE7A2.Figure 1Structure of the human skeletal musclePDE7A mRNAs and proteins.

Amino acids that are unique to the skeletal muscle PDE7A2 protein are indicated in bold. A sequence derived from repeats found in PDE7A1 (HCP1) is underlined.B, a schematic representation of the two PDE7AmRNAs and their encoded proteins is shown. The mRNAs are depicted in bold lines, and the encoded PDE7A1 and -2 proteins are depicted above and below the mRNAs, respectively.M indicates initiator methionine; ter indicates a termination codon. The location of short repeats (R), and of the catalytic domain, is indicated by labeled boxes and the locations of splice junctions by dashed lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HSM7 (PDE7A2) contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of 456 residues with a predicted molecular mass of 52.7 kDa. The 20 N-terminal residues of PDE7A2 are unique to the skeletal muscle isozyme, are hydrophobic, and contain potential sites of myristoylation (glycine residue two) and of palmitoylation (cysteine residue eight). Both PDE7A-encoded proteins contain a potential cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site (serine 58 of PDE7A2). PDE7A1 (HCP1) has two N-terminal repeats each containing a cAMP-dependent protein kinase pseudosubstrate site, but the PDE7A2 alternative splice preserves only one of these sites (Fig. 1 B). Thus, while alternative splicing may contribute to post-translational modifications unique to PDE7A2, both PDE7A-encoded proteins contain motifs that may involve complex interactions with the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The expression of PDE7A during early human development was examined by analyzing RNA obtained from fetal tissues. In contrast to the strong predominance of a 3.8-kb mRNA in the adult skeletal muscle, fetal tissues contained comparable amounts of PDE7A RNA, which was composed of both its 4.2- and 3.8-kb mRNAs (Fig. 2). Reverse transcriptase PCR analysis, which distinguished between thePDE7A1 and -2 transcripts, demonstrated the presence of the two independent, alternatively spliced PDE7AmRNAs in the examined fetal tissues (Fig. 3). Thus, it is unlikely that the 3.8-kb PDE7A RNA found in these tissues is a degradation product of the 4.2-kb PDE7A RNA. Normalization of the combined amounts of the two PDE7AmRNAs to those of the housekeeping gene GAPDH mRNA, indicated that PDE7A mRNAs were 2–3-fold more abundant in the brain than in the heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and lung (Fig.2). Heart and skeletal muscle contained significant amounts of bothPDE7A mRNAs with a relative predominance of the 3.8-kb mRNA, while brain, kidney, and lung contained primarily the 4.2-kbPDE7A mRNA. Thus, both the tissue distribution and the relative abundance of the two PDE7A mRNAs differ considerably among adult and fetal human tissues.Figure 3Reverse transcriptase PCR analysis of alternatively spliced PDE7A transcripts in fetal tissues. Five μg of total RNA prepared from human fetal skeletal muscle (lanes 1, 6, 7, and 12), heart (lanes 2 and 8), brain (lanes 3 and9), kidney (lanes 4 and 10), and lung (lanes 5 and 11) were subjected to reverse transcriptase PCR analysis in the presence (lanes 1–5 and7–11), and in the absence (lanes 6 and12), of reverse transcriptase as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Oligonucleotides specific to the 5′ ofPDE7A1 (lanes 1–6) and of PDE7A2(lanes 7–12), and a common 3′ oligonucleotide, were used to amplify the PDE7A1 (311-bp product) and PDE7A2 (391-bp product) mRNAs present in these tissues (oligonucleotides are depicted under “Experimental Procedures”). Amplified DNA products were fractionated on a 1.4% Nusieve (3:1) agarose gel, stained, and visualized. DNA molecular weight markers in bp are depicted on theleft-hand side (M).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify the proteins encoded by the two PDE7A mRNAs, we analyzed the expression of PDE7A proteins in yeast and in human fetal tissues on Western blots (Figs. 4 and 5). PDE7A proteins were immunodetected with an anti-PDE7A antiserum raised against a C-terminal peptide common to both PDE7A-encoded proteins. To assess the specificity of the antibodies and the molecular weights of PDE7A-encoded proteins, we examined the expression of PDE7A1 and -2 in yeast and in fetal kidney (Fig. 4). Specific PDE7A-encoded proteins were immunodetected in yeast cells bearing PDE7A expression plasmids and in fetal kidney (Fig. 4 A). The detection of PDE7A proteins by anti-PDE7A antibodies was blocked by preincubation of the antibodies with a C-terminal peptide of PDE7A, thereby demonstrating the specificity of the protein bands detected by the anti-PDE7A antibodies (Fig.4 B). The PDE7A1 protein expressed in yeast contained an N-terminal tag derived from influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and migrated as a 59 kDa protein. A smaller PDE7A protein, which migrated as a 57-kDa protein, was found in the soluble fraction of human fetal kidney, as expected for the native, untagged, PDE7A1 protein (Fig.4 A). The PDE7A2 product expressed in yeast migrated as a 50-kDa protein, indicating that, as predicted by its sequence, the PDE7A2 product is smaller than that of PDE7A1. An N-terminally tagged HA-PDE7A2 product was immunodetected with anti-PDE7A and with anti-HA antibodies as a 52-kDa protein, demonstrating that the 50-kDa PDE7A protein is the full-length product of the PDE7A2 cDNA expressed in yeast (not shown). These observations demonstrate thatPDE7A1 encodes a protein with an apparent mobility of 57 kDa and that the PDE7A2 cDNA we isolated encodes a protein with an apparent mobility of 50 kDa. To identify PDE7A-encoded proteins and their subcellular localization in fetal tissues, we analyzed the soluble and the particulate fractions of human brain, heart, kidney, lung, and skeletal muscle. A representative subcellular distribution of PDE7A proteins of fetal tissues is depicted in Fig. 5. Immunodetection of PDE7A proteins on Western blots demonstrated that both the soluble and particulate fractions of human brain, heart, kidney, lung, and skeletal muscle contained a 57-kDa PDE7A protein, while a 50-kDa PDE7A protein was present only in the particulate fractions of the heart and skeletal muscle. The fraction of particulate 57-kDa PDE7A protein was significantly higher than the fraction of lactate dehydrogenase activity detected in particulate fractions, suggesting that the localization of the 57-kDa PDE7A to soluble and particulate fractions is not due to cross-contamination (see “Experimental Procedures”). In agreement with the distribution of PDE7A mRNA in fetal tissues, and on the basis of the apparent molecular weights of PDE7A1 and -2 proteins expressed in yeast, it appears that the 57-kDa protein found in the soluble and particulate fractions of all five fetal tissues is the PDE7A1 product, and the particulate 50-kDa protein of heart and skeletal muscle is the PDE7A2 product. The localization of PDE7A2 to particulate fractions is consistent with the hydrophobicity of its N terminus. Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that the PDE7A1 gene product has an apparent mobility of 57 kDa and is located mostly to soluble cellular fractions, and that thePDE7A2 gene product has an apparent mobility of 50 kDa and is located to particulate cellular fractions. To analyze the biochemical properties of PDE7A2 we prepared crude cell extracts from transformants of the PDE-deficient yeast strain 10DAB bearing a PDE7A2expression plasmid. PDE assays were performed as detailed under “Experimental Procedures” using cAMP as a substrate. Measurable cAMP PDE activity was detected in extracts of 10DAB cells expressing PDE7A2, but not in extracts of 10DAB cells bearing an expression vector that lacked an insert (not shown). The effect of substrate concentration on the velocity of cAMP hydrolysis was determined. TheK m deduced from the linear and the double-reciprocal Lineweaver-Burke plots was 0.1 ± 0.01 μm cAMP, and the calculated V max was 0.0135 ± 0.001 nmol/min·mg (±standard deviation, Fig. 6). PDE7A2 did not hydrolyze cGMP, and its cAMP PDE activity was not significantly affected by the presence of a wide range of concentrations of cGMP or of the PDE4-specific inhibitor rolipram (see “Experimental Procedures”). These observations demonstrate that PDE7A2 is a high affinity cAMP-specific PDE with kinetic and pharmacologic properties characteristic of PDE7 and distinct from those of PDE3 and 4. Comparable amounts of PDE7A1 and -2 were present in yeast extracts (Fig. 4 A), and it therefore appears that theK m and V max values of PDE7A2 were roughly 2-fold lower than those of PDE7A1, the high affinity cAMP-specific PDE we characterized previously (5Michaeli T.

Thus, alternative splicing of PDE7A predominant in human skeletal muscle and heart tissues produced small effects on the kinetic properties of PDE7A and drastic effects on its subcellular localization. Molecular cloning of cDNAs encoding cyclic nucleotide PDEs demonstrated their extensive isozyme diversity, derived from the existence of multiple gene families and from complex splicing patterns within some PDE families (1Beavo J.A.

Isozyme diversity within the newly isolated high affinity cAMP-specific PDE family, PDE7, is due to the existence of two PDE7A mRNAs. Of these two mRNAs, PDE7A2 is the most prevalent PDE7AmRNA in adult human tissues with abundant expression in skeletal muscle and detectable expression in the heart (5Michaeli T. Bloom T.J. Martins T. Loughney K. Ferguson K. Riggs M. Rodgers L. Beavo J.A. Wigler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12925-12932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further the understanding of PDE7, we isolated a cDNA encoding the humanPDE7A skeletal muscle isoform (designatedHSPDE7A2). The structure of the PDE7A2 cDNA indicates that the skeletal muscle isoform is a 5′ splice variant ofPDE7A with a novel N terminus. The alternative splice ofPDE7A2 directs its localization to a particulate cellular fraction. The PDE7A2 mRNA encodes a variant PDE7 protein with a novel, hydrophobic, 20-residue-long N terminus. We examined the PDE7A2 product in human fetal tissues and as a recombinant protein in yeast and identified the PDE7A2 product as a protein with an apparent mobility of 50 kDa. In agreement with the expression ofPDE7A2 mRNA in fetal skeletal muscle and heart, and consistent with the hydrophobicity of its N terminus, the PDE7A2 protein is found in the particulate fractions of fetal skeletal muscle and heart. PDE7A2 is a high affinity cAMP-specific PDE possessing aK m of 0.1 μm toward its substrate. Thus, in comparison with the properties of the high affinity cAMP-specific PDE, PDE7A1 (HCP1), alterative splicing yields only small effects on the kinetic properties of PDE7A isozymes, but has a dramatic effect on their subcellular localization. The analysis of PDE7A2-encoded proteins expressed in yeast and in fetal tissues demonstrated that although the HSM7 cDNA isolated in this study is incomplete, it contains the entire coding region of PDE7A2. A similar analysis of the expression of PDE7A1 proteins demonstrated that PDE7A1 encodes a protein with an apparent mobility of 57 kDa. These observations strongly suggest that the incomplete PDE7A1 cDNA we previously isolated contains the complete coding region of PDE7A1 (5Michaeli T. Bloom T.J. Martins T. Loughney K. Ferguson K. Riggs M. Rodgers L. Beavo J.A. Wigler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12925-12932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, this study identifies the complete coding regions, and the protein products, of PDE7A1 and PDE7A2. The mRNAs of both PDE7A1 and -2 contain long 5′-untranslated regions of up to 1.1 and 0.7 kb, respectively, that may regulate their expression. In light of the persistent difficulties in cloning of the 5′-untranslated region of the PDE7A1mRNA, the identification of the PDE7A gene products provides a strong basis for studies of PDE7A function. Analyzes of PDE activities of skeletal muscle do not detail the presence of PDE7-like, high affinity cAMP-specific PDE activities, although the expression of cAMP-specific PDEs (PDE4) has been demonstrated (26Hidaka H. Yamaki T. Ochiai Y. Asano T. Yamabe H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 484: 398-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 27Ball E.H. Seth P.K. Sanwal B.D. J. Biol.

Our analysis of PDE7A2 expression demonstrated a strong and direct correlation between the amounts ofPDE7A RNA and proteins in several fetal tissues, including the skeletal muscle. Thus, at least in fetal tissues, translational regulation of PDE7A2 is not a plausible cause for the inability to detect PDE7 like activities in skeletal muscle. Rather, it is possible that PDE7-like activities could not be detected in skeletal muscle, and perhaps also in B cells, because only soluble fractions were analyzed, thereby precluding the detection of PDE7A2 activity. Future studies of PDE activities of particulate fractions of skeletal muscle are required to address these issues. Compartmentalization of cellular proteins is integral to signal transduction. In cAMP signaling, compartmentalization of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase to particulate cellular fractions via the interactions of its regulatory subunit with anchor proteins has been demonstrated in many cell types (reviewed in Refs.32Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-479PubMed Google Scholar, 33Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 34Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Compartmentalization of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase is required for cAMP-mediated regulation of glutamate receptor channels (35Rosenmund C. Carr D.W. Bergeson S.E. Nilaver G. Scott J.D. Westbrook G.L. Science. 1994; 368: 853-856Google Scholar). In the case of PDE7A, alternative splicing determines the subcellular localization of its protein products without drastically affecting their kinetic properties. While the association of PDE7A2 with particulate fractions can be mediated via hydrophobicity and modifications of its N terminus, the mechanism of partitioning of PDE7A1 between particulate and soluble fractions, most pronounced in the brain, is not clear. As PDE7A1 may be tethered to particulate fractions via protein-protein interactions, its partitioning may be due to the existence of different cell types within a tissue, which either lack, or express different, anchor proteins. Although the functional consequences of the compartmentalization of PDE7A activities are not known, similar effects of N-terminal splicing variability has been demonstrated for PDE4A (10Bolger G.B. McPhee I. Houslay M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1065-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Three alternatively spliced PDE4A products exhibit 2–5-fold differences in theirV max values and small differences in theirK m values and in their sensitivity to the PDE4-specific inhibitor, rolipram. However, these three alternatively spliced PDE4A products vary considerably in their subcellular distribution by being completely, mostly, and weakly particulate (PDE4A1, -8, and -5, respectively). Thus, as is the case for the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, compartmentalization of PDEs via structural changes that are the product of alternative splicing or via dynamic modifications and protein-protein interactions may be fundamental to the performance of isozyme-specific roles in cellular signaling. The relatively even distribution of PDE7A RNA among human fetal tissues is in sharp contrast to the predominance and overabundance of the PDE7A2 mRNA in the adult skeletal muscle (5Michaeli T. Bloom T.J. Martins T. Loughney K. Ferguson K. Riggs M. Rodgers L. Beavo J.A. Wigler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12925-12932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike adult tissues, several fetal tissues contain bothPDE7A1 and -2 mRNAs, perhaps as a result of their expression in different cell types within the tissue. The dramatic reduction of PDE7A expression throughout development observed in most tissues and its persistence and predominance in adult skeletal muscle strongly suggest that the expression of PDE7A is regulated throughout development. Additional studies are required to determine whether the fluctuations in PDE7A mRNA levels are reflected in its activities and to evaluate their functional significance in development. However, a specialized role for PDE7A in muscle signal transduction is suggested by the restricted expression of its splice variant PDE7A2 to adult skeletal muscle and heart and its predominance in fetal skeletal muscle and heart, tissues in which cAMP plays modulatory physiological and developmental roles. During the review of this manuscript, similar observations on PDE7A1 of T cells were published by Bloom and Beavo (Bloom, T. J., and Beavo, J. A. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 14188–14192.

Cellular RNAs do not exist as a free form but as an RNA-protein complex. The proteins that directly associate with RNA are thought to play important roles in the regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level (1Atwater J.A. Wisdom R. VermaI I.M. Annu.

In eukaryotic cells, proteins that bind to RNA polymerase II transcripts include both heterogeneous nuclear RNA-binding proteins and cytoplasmic mRNA-binding proteins. Heterogeneous nuclear RNA-binding proteins bind pre-mRNAs and are associated with them during the processing events required for the formation of mature mRNA (1Atwater J.A. Wisdom R. VermaI I.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 519-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Once mRNAs are transported to the cytoplasm, they form cytoplasmic mRNA-binding protein complexes (2Bandziulis R.J. Swanson M.S. Dreyfuss G. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic mRNA-binding proteins seem to regulate translation, localization, or stability of mRNA (3Hargrove J.L. Hulsey M.G. Beale E.G. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). At present, many RNA-binding proteins have been isolated and characterized (4Sachs A.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 413-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 5Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar), but their functions have not been fully understood. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the SSD1 gene has been first characterized to suppress the sit4 mutation defective in a protein phosphatase subunit (6Sutton A. Immanuel D. Arndt K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2133-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Not only in this case, but also in many other cases, SSD1 has been isolated as a single copy suppressor of mutation defective in RPC31encoding a subunit of RNA polymerase III (7Stettler S. Chiannilkulchai N. Denmat S.H. Lalo D. Lacroute F. Sentenac A. Thuriaux P. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1993; 239: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), in PDE2encoding the cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase (8Wilson R.B. Brenner A.A. White T.B. Engler M.J. Gaughran J.P. Tatchell K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3369-3373Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), in BCK1encoding mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (9Costigan C. Gehrung S. Snyder M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1162-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), inMPK1 encoding mitogen-activated protein kinase (10Lee K.S. Irie K. Gotoh Y. Watanabe Y. Araki H. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3067-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), or in G1 cyclin (11Cvrckova F. Nasmyth K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5277-5286Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These reports indicate that SSD1is involved in many systems. Sutton et al. also reported that there are two alleles of the SSD1 gene; one is calledssd1-d (dead) and the other is called SSD1-V(viable). They described that SSD1-V could suppress the double mutations of ssd1-d and sit4 (6Sutton A. Immanuel D. Arndt K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2133-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). We have also isolated the SSD1 gene as the MCS1 gene involved in stable maintenance of the minichromosome (12Uesono Y. Fujita A. Toh-e A. Kikuchi Y. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 143: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). TheSSD1/MCS1 gene product was detected as a ∼160-kDa protein in certain wild type strains bearing SSD1-V, such as KA31 or RAY-3A, whereas a protein of this size was not detected in another wild type strain bearing ssd1-d, such as YPH499 (7Stettler S. Chiannilkulchai N. Denmat S.H. Lalo D. Lacroute F. Sentenac A. Thuriaux P. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1993; 239: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that SSD1-V is simply a wild type gene andssd1-d is a defective gene. However, the functions ofSSD1 have not yet been clarified. In recent years, it has been reported that SSD1 has a weak but significant similarity with dis3 + ofSchizosaccharomyces pombe (6Sutton A. Immanuel D. Arndt K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2133-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 13Kinoshita N. Goebl M. Yanagida M. Mol. Cell.

Genet. 1995; 28: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), vacB of Shigella flexneri (15Tobe T. Sasakawa C. Okada N. Honma Y. Yoshikawa M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6359-6367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cyt4 of Neurospora crassa(16Turcq B. Dobinson K.F. Serizawa N. Lambowitz A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1676-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), zam of Synechocytosis PCC 6803 (17Beuf L. Bedu S. Cami B. Joset F. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 27: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), andrnb of Escherichia coli (18Zilhao R. Camelo L. Arraiano C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Some of these genes are known, or implied, to be involved in the modification of RNAs: 1)cyt4 is required for the mitochondrial rRNA splicing and processing reaction; 2) DSS1 is a multicopy suppressor of the disruptant of SUV3 encoding a putative RNA helicase-like protein; 3) the vacB mutation reduces the level of the virulence antigens, IpaB, IpaC, IpaD, and VirG, at the post-transcriptional level; and 4) the RNase II encoded byrnb has a 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease activity. However, there have been no reports describing direct interaction with RNA in these gene products, except for RNase II of E. coli. Here we report the biochemical characterization and cellular localization of the Ssd1 protein. RAY-3A (MATa ura3 leu2 trp1 his3) and YRM1H (RAY-3A ssd1Δ::HIS3) were used for the ribonuclease assay, nucleotide binding studies, metabolic labeling with [32P]orthophosphate, and sucrose gradient fractionation of cell extract. KA31–2A (MATa ura3 leu2 trp1 his3) (19Irie K. Takase M. Lee K.S. Levin D.E. Araki H. Matsumoto K. Oshima Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3076-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) and YKM1H (KA31–2Assd1Δ::HIS3) were used for testing growth rates and for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. The SSD1disruption was performed by using pYK907 plasmid as described previously (12Uesono Y. Fujita A. Toh-e A. Kikuchi Y. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 143: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Culture media, including YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) and synthetic minimal SD (0.7% yeast nitrogen base without amino acid and 2% glucose) with amino acid supplements, were prepared according to Rose et al. (20Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: Alaboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). SRaf contained 0.7% Difco yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% raffinose, and appropriate supplements. Plasmid pFK4 was constructed by inserting the 6-kilobase BamHI fragment bearing theSSD1 gene derived from the original clone, pFK2CU (12Uesono Y. Fujita A. Toh-e A. Kikuchi Y. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 143: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), into pUC13. For overexpression of the SSD1 gene, a plasmid pSSD1.0 was made as follows. pYES2 (Invitrogen), a high copy number plasmid carrying the URA3 marker and the inducibleGAL1 promotor, was digested with HindIII, and the DNA ends were made flush with a Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, digested with BamHI, and then ligated with the 5.2-kilobaseHpaI-BamHI fragment bearing the SSD1gene derived from pFK4. Translational initiation of Ssd1.0p is started at the ATG at position 52 in the open reading frame of SSD1. Therefore, Ssd1.0p expressed from pSSD1.0 plasmid encodes the protein lacking 17 amino acids of the N terminus. pSSD1.1 was constructed as follows. After pSSD1.0 was digested with XhoI andHindIII, the DNA ends were made flush and ligated. pSSD1.2 was constructed by digestion of pSSD1.0 with XbaI, and the resulting large fragment was recircularized. Plasmid pFK1CU or plasmid pFK5EU contains SSD1 on YCUp4 or YEUp3 vector (constructed by Fujita), respectively (12Uesono Y. Fujita A. Toh-e A. Kikuchi Y. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 143: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). YRM1H cells carrying pYES2, pSSD1.0, pSSD1.1, or pSSD1.2 were grown in SRaf-Ura to early log phase and transferred to SRaf-Ura containing 0.5% galactose followed by incubation at 30 °C for 4 h. For the preparation of cellular extract, 5 × 107 cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with ice-cold lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, and antipain). Cells were resuspended in 150 μl of lysis buffer and lysed by shaking four times with an equal amount of glass beads for 30-s intervals. An additional 200 μl of lysis buffer was added, and mixtures were shaken again for 30 s. Extract was pipetted out and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min to remove cell debris. Immunoprecipitation of each Ssd1p derivative, gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting experiments were performed as described previously (6Sutton A. Immanuel D. Arndt K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2133-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). An RNA binding experiment was carried out by incubating the electroblotted proteins with 32P-labeled RNA as described previously (21Lee F.-J.S. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15080-15087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled total RNA were prepared from yeast cells by using PUREscriptTM RNA isolation kits (Gentra system Co., Ltd), and treated with RNase-free DNase (Sigma). Yeast cells of YRM1H carrying pFK1CU or YCUp4 were grown in SD-Ura to midlog phase at 25 °C. Early log phase cells of YRM1H carrying pSSD1.0 grown in SRaf-Ura were transferred to SRaf-Ura containing 0.5% galactose or 2% glucose and incubated for 4 h at 25 °C. Cellular extracts (200 μl) were prepared from approximately 5 × 107 cells as described above, and immunoprecipitations were performed using 20 μl of anti-Ssd1p antibody, as described previously (6Sutton A. Immanuel D. Arndt K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2133-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitants were washed twice with buffer for measurement of exoribonuclease and resuspended in 75 μl of the same buffer, and exoribonuclease assays were carried out. The assays of exoribonuclease were based on the release of acid-soluble radioactivity from [3H]poly(rA) or 32P-labeled total RNA according to the procedure as described previously (27Noguchi E. Hayashi N. Azuma Y. Seki T. Nakamura M. Nakashima N. Yanagida M. He X. Mueller U. Sazer S. Nishimoto T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5595-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 28Piedade J. Zilhãbo R. Arraiano C.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 127: 187-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Stevens A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3080-3085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For preparation of yeast lysates, RAY-3A cells were grown in YPD to midlog phase, and early log phase cells of YRM1H carrying pSSD1.0, pSSD1.1, or pSSD1.2 were grown in SRaf-Ura containing 0.5% galactose for 4 h at 25 °C. Approximately 1 × 108 cells were lysed by shaking with glass beads in 300 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, and antipain), an additional 200 μl of binding buffer was added, and cellular extracts were prepared by glass beads shearing as described above. Using this extract, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) chromatography, and ribohomopolymer (Sigma) binding assay, were performed as described previously (22Matunis M.J. Matunis E.L. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6114-6123Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy of yeast cells was performed with a modification of previously published procedures (23Pringle J.R. Preston R.A. Adams A.E.M. Stearns T. Drubin D.G. Haarer B.K. Jones E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 31: 357-435Google Scholar). KA31–2A cells carrying pFK5EU, a multicopy plasmid carrying the SSD1 gene, were grown to early log phase in SD-Ura, and formaldehyde was directly added to a final concentration of 5%. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, cells were washed twice with 100 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.5, and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer S (100 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5, 1.2 m sorbitol) containing 20 μg of zymolyase 100T (Seikagaku) and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Cells were rinsed twice with buffer S and twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin. Cells were resuspended in 200 μl of the same buffer containing 2 μl of anti-Ssd1p antiserum (100:1) and incubated for 4 h at 30 °C. Cells were applied to polylysine-coated glass slides for 0.5 h and washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were incubated with the same buffer containing fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (100:1) for 1 h at 30 °C. Samples were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline and added with 0.5 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. For the preparation of low salt extract, approximately 3 × 108 early log phase cells were lysed by vortexing with glass beads in 400 μl of standard extraction buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, and antipain). Cell debris were removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 5,000 × g. Then one half (150 μl) of the supernatant was incubated with RNase A (10 μg/ml) plus micrococcal nuclease (200 μg/ml) at 30 °C for 30 min, and the other half (150 μl) was incubated under the same conditions without enzyme (24Liang S. Hitomi M. Hu Y. Liu Y. Tartakoff A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5139-5146Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Each sample was layered onto 12 ml of a continuous 10–30% sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm in a Beckman SW-40 rotor for 18 h at 4 °C. For a polysome preparation, 1.5 × 108 early log phase cells were treated with cycloheximide and were processed as described previously (25Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). For the preparation of extract that contains decaying polysome, 1.5 × 108 midlog phase cells were collected, and cell extracts were prepared by glass bead shearing (26Kraig E. Haber J. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 144: 1098-1112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were fractionated through a continuous 15–50% sucrose gradient by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman SW-40 rotor for 2.5 h at 4 °C. A 254 of the gradient fraction was monitored using the Pharmacia FPLC system and Buchler Auto Densi-Flow IIC. It has been reported that the Ssd1 protein shows weak similarity with the Cyt4 protein, which is related to a mitochondrial RNA splicing and processing factor of N. crassa (16Turcq B. Dobinson K.F. Serizawa N. Lambowitz A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1676-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Another report demonstrated the conserved domains in several proteins involving not only Cyt4p but also RNase II, a 3′ to 5′ exoribonuclease, encoded by rnb of E. coli (14Dmochowska A. Golik P. Stepien P.P. Curr. Genet. 1995; 28: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared the amino acid sequence of Ssd1p with those of other proteins. Computer search analysis using the GENETYX program (Software Development Co., Ltd.) revealed that Ssd1p has similarities with SpDis3p of S. pombe (23.1% identity in 565 amino acids ofSsd1p), ScDis3p of S. cerevisiae (24.2% identity in 505 amino acids) (27Noguchi E. Hayashi N. Azuma Y. Seki T. Nakamura M. Nakashima N. Yanagida M. He X. Mueller U. Sazer S. Nishimoto T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5595-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), Dss1p of S. cerevisiae (12.4% identity in 290 amino acids), Cyt4p of N. crassa (21.0% identity in 372 amino acids), VacB of Shigella flexneri(20.1% identity in 387 amino acids), and Rnb of E. coli(20.9% identity in 373 amino acids). The homology search demonstrated that similarities are restricted to the C-terminal half of Ssd1p and that three conserved domains exist in this region (Fig.1 A). The first domain of Ssd1p was located around a region from 689 to 785 (domain 1; D1), the second was a region from 880 to 910 (domain 2; D3), and the last was a region from 983 to 1014 (domain 3; D3) in Ssd1p. Of these domains, domain 3 is the most highly conserved among these proteins (Fig. 1 B). In addition to the proteins shown in Fig. 1, the protein predicted from the sequence of F48E8.6of Caenorhabditis elegans (BLAST network service) also has these domains. These findings indicate that domains 1, 2, and 3 are conserved from prokaryote to eukaryote. To test whether these conserved domains are necessary for the function of SSD1 or not, we constructed several SSD1 derivatives (Fig.2 A). SSD1.0, encoding a protein lacking 17 amino acids of the N terminus of Ssd1p expressed under theGAL1 promotor on a multicopy vector (see “Materials and Methods”), could complement the temperature sensitivity of YKM1H, thessd1 disruptant of the KA31–2A strain; probably, it was expressed from the GAL1 promotor on SRaf medium containing glucose. This result indicated that SSD1.0 encoded a functional protein (Fig. 2 B, left panel, 37 °C). In contrast to this, the gene lacking both domains 2 and 3 (SSD1.1) or all of domains 1, 2, and 3 (SSD1.2) could not complement the temperature sensitivity of YKM1H (Fig. 2 B, left panel, 37 °C). To our surprise, overexpression ofSSD1.0 in the existence of galactose inhibited the growth of YKM1H at 25 °C, while SSD1.1 or SSD1.2 did not (Fig. 2 B, right panel). Thus, the SSD1 gene requires the region including domains 2 and 3 for its function. In the case of dis3 + of S. pombe, a similar result indicating that the most conserved region is necessary for its activity has been described previously (13Kinoshita N. Goebl M. Yanagida M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5839-5847Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The growth-inhibited cells did not show any characteristic morphology. This growth inhibition was more remarkable in the strain KA31 or W303 than in another wild type strain, RAY-3A (data not shown). Since the sequence of Ssd1p has similarity with that of the RNase II of E. coli as described above, we tested whether Ssd1p had an exoribonuclease activity. The immunoprecipitants were prepared by using anti-Ssd1p antibody from the lysates of the wild type, the ssd1 disruptant, and theSSD1-overexpressing cells. Using these immunoprecipitants, we examined an ability of Ssd1p to degrade 3H-labeled poly(rA) or 32P-labeled total RNA extracted from yeast cells under the following several assay conditions of RNase II ofE. coli (28Piedade J. Zilhãbo R. Arraiano C.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 127: 187-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 5′ to 3′ exoribonuclease (Xrn1p) of S. cerevisiae (29Stevens A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3080-3085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or mitochondrial 3′ to 5′ exoribonuclease ofS. cerevisiae (30Min J. Heuertz R.M. Zassenhaus H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7350-7357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we were unable to detect any exoribonuclease activity with these immunoprecipitants. We next examined whether Ssd1p could bind RNA in vitro. Ssd1.0p and derivatives from it were immunoprecipitated from extracts of yeast cells overexpressing each SSD1 derivative using anti-Ssd1p antibody and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose filter after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular masses of Ssd1.0p, Ssd1.1p, and Ssd1.2p were about 160, 120, and 95 kDa, respectively, when detected by immunoblotting analysis (Fig.3, left panel). The molecular weights of Ssd1.0p, Ssd1.1p, and Ssd1.2p deduced from amino acid sequences were 140, 95, and 76 kDa, respectively, suggesting that all of these proteins are modified and that the modified regions may reside in the N-terminal half of Ssd1p, which does not show any significant similarity with other proteins. The filter was incubated with32P-labeled total RNA extracted from yeast cells. Only Ssd1.1p of 120 kDa lacking both D2 and D3 could bind to32P-labeled RNA, while Ssd1.0p and Ssd1.2p could not (Fig.3, right panel). This result indicates that Ssd1.1p can associate with RNA directly without any binding proteins and that the region containing D1 is necessary for RNA binding. The reason why Ssd1.0p did not bind to RNA is unclear at this moment. We cannot exclude a possibility that native Ssd1.0p and Ssd1.2p can bind RNA; therefore, it is important to test whether the native Ssd1p has an ability to bind RNA. To detect an ability of native Ssd1p to bind polynucleotide, we carried out DNA-cellulose chromatography. The same amount of extracts from the yeast cells overexpressing Ssd1.0p or its derivatives was mixed with dsDNA- and ssDNA-cellulose in 0.1 or 1.0 m NaCl, and proteins were eluted with 2 m NaCl. Ssd1.0p was able to bind to ssDNA at 0.1 m NaCl (Fig. 4 A, lane 1) but not to dsDNA efficiently (Fig. 4 A, lane 7), whereas Ssd1.2p lacking all conserved domains weakly bound ssDNA but not dsDNA (Fig.4 A, lanes 3, 4, 9, and10). Thus, Ssd1.0p has an ability to bind single-stranded DNA, and the conserved regions seem to be necessary for interaction. However, Ssd1.1p lacking the most highly conserved region, domain 3, could bind ssDNA more efficiently than Ssd1.0p (Fig. 4 A,lanes 1 and 5). These results indicate that Ssd1p can bind ssDNA without the most highly conserved region, as seen in the case of Fig. 3, and that a region, other than the conserved regions, may bind ssDNA. Interestingly, Ssd1.1p could bind dsDNA as well as ssDNA (Fig. 4 A, lane 11), suggesting that the region including both domains 2 and 3 is necessary for specific binding to single-stranded polynucleotides. To further characterize the RNA binding property of Ssd1p, we examined whether Ssd1p or its derivatives was bound to four ribohomopolymers. This binding assay has been successful in distinguishing the specificities of a variety of RNA-binding proteins (22Matunis M.J. Matunis E.L. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6114-6123Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Extracts from the wild type cells were mixed with poly(rA)-, poly(rU)-, poly(rG)-, and poly(rC)-agarose in 0.1 or 1.0 m NaCl. The ribohomopolymer-binding proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer. Basically, Ssd1p bound efficiently to the all kinds of ribohomopolymers in 0.1 m NaCl, whereas it bound to poly(rA) more efficiently than to the other polynucleotides under a high salt condition (Fig. 4 B, top). The same result was obtained, using the extract of cells overproducing Ssd1.0p (Fig.4 B, middle). Ssd1.1p lacking both domains 2 and 3 seemed to bind efficiently with poly(rU) in 1.0 m NaCl (Fig. 4 B, bottom). This finding suggests that the poly(rA)-specific binding of Ssd1p may depend on the region including both domains 2 and 3. It is important to determine the localization of Ssd1p because the nucleic acid-binding proteins exert their functions in their respective compartments. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-Ssd1p antibody was carried out to determine the subcellular localization of Ssd1p. To facilitate detection of the immunofluorescence, the SSD1 gene was cloned on a multicopy YEUp3 vector (pFK5EU) to overexpressSSD1 in cells. The affinity-purified anti-Ssd1p antibody revealed an intense signal in cytoplasm and a weak signal in the nucleus in the ssd1 disruptant cells (YKM1H) carrying pFK5EU. The signal was always observed in the cytoplasm, irrespective of budded or unbudded cells (Fig. 5, A andC), indicating that Ssd1p mainly stays in the cytoplasm throughout the cell cycle. As a reference, signals were not observed in the ssd1 disruptant cells carrying YEUp3 vector (Fig.5 E). These observations suggest that Ssd1p may associate with RNA in the cytoplasm but not DNA or RNA in the nucleus; therefore, Ssd1p may play some roles in the stability or turnover of cytoplasmic RNA rather than its maturation. To know whether Ssd1p can associate with cellular RNA or not, low salt extracts prepared from the wild type cells were fractionated on a 10–30% continuous sucrose density gradient, and each fraction was analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-Ssd1p antibody. Ssd1p showed a broad distribution in fractions 7–19 (Fig. 6, upper panel). However, after treatment of extracts with RNase A and micrococcal nuclease, Ssd1p was mainly sedimented in the upper fractions 7 and 8, where the monomeric Ssd1 protein (160 kDa) was expected to sediment (Fig. 6, lower panel). The fact that Ssd1p in the extract treated with nuclease also sedimented in the faster sedimenting fractions indicates that some population of Ssd1p may form complexes with certain protein or nucleic acids. Thus, we presumed that Ssd1p associated with RNA in vivo. Cytoplasmic mRNAs exist either in translationally active form or translationally inactive form. In mammalian cells, the histone mRNA degradation occurs at the 3′ terminus and appears to be catalyzed by a polyribosome-associated 3′ to 5′ exoribonuclease. In fact, Caruccioet al. (31Caruccio N. Ross J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31814-31821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has purified a polyribosome-associated 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease in human cells. In yeast, it has been reported that some of RNA-binding proteins, like Pab1p and Pub2p, are associated with actively translating mRNAs, while Pub1p is not (32Anderson J.T. Paddy M.R. Swanson M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6102-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To test whether Ssd1p was associated with polyribosomal mRNAs, cellular RNAs were fractionated by sucrose gradient centrifugation. The distribution of Ssd1p in the gradient was determined by immunoblot analysis. In cycloheximide-treated extract in which polyribosomes accumulated, Ssd1p was distributed from 80 S to the top fraction. A small amount of the protein was distributed in polyribosome fractions (Fig. 7 A). A similar distribution pattern of Ssd1p was obtained when extract without cycloheximide treatment was analyzed (Fig. 7 B). This result indicates that Ssd1p is not stably associated with actively translated mRNA. mRNA stability influences gene expression by affecting mRNA abundance and the rate at which mRNA accumulates or disappears when the transcription rate changes. In S. cerevisiae, it has been known that there are two major pathways for mRNA degradation. One is the so-called deadenylation-dependent pathway, and the other is the deadenylation-independent pathway (33Muhlrad D. Paker R. Nature. 1994; 370: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 34Beelman C.A. Stevens A. Caponigro G. LaGrandeur T.E. Hatfield L. Fortner D.M. Paker R. Nature. 1996; 382: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Both degradation pathways require XRN1 encoding a 5′ to 3′ exoribonuclease (35Kenna M. Stevens A. McCammon M. Douglas M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 36Larimer F.W. Stevens A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1990; 95: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 37Masison D.C. Blanc A. Ribas J.C. Carrol K. Sonenberg N. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2763-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the study using the xrn1 mutant showed the existence of 3′ to 5′ exoribonuclease (33Muhlrad D. Paker R. Nature. 1994; 370: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In mitochondria of S. cerevisiae, an NTP-dependent 3′ to 5′ exoribonuclease has also been isolated and characterized (30Min J. Heuertz R.M. Zassenhaus H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7350-7357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Min J. Zassenhaus H.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6245-6253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the gene encoding 3′ to 5′ exoribonuclease of cytoplasm has not been identified yet. There are no reports identifying a gene encoding a 3′ to 5′ exoribonuclease, except for rnb of E. coli. The SGD (Saccharomyces Genome Data base) project revealed that three Saccharomyces genes, DSS1,YOL021C/ScDIS3, and SSD1, encode domains showing weak similarities with RNase II of E. coli. These gene products may be candidates of the 3′ to 5′ exoribonuclease of S. cerevisiae. However, we could not detect exoribonuclease activity of Ssd1p using poly(rA) or total RNA as a substrate. Highly purified preparations of mitochondrial 3′ to 5′ exoribonuclease of S. cerevisiae have shown to form a complex and require NTP-dependent RNA helicase for its activity (30Min J. Heuertz R.M. Zassenhaus H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7350-7357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Margossian S.P. Li H. Zassenhaus H.P. Butow R.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 199-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It contains three major polypeptides estimated to be 75, 90, and 110 kDa, which is predicted to be the gene product of DSS1 (29Stevens A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3080-3085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the Dis3 protein of S. pombe has also reported to be part of a 250–350-kDa oligomer (13Kinoshita N. Goebl M. Yanagida M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5839-5847Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, Ssd1p may also need another component for an exoribonuclease activity. As shown in Fig. 6, most of Ssd1p was in monomeric fraction after treatment with RNase, and a small fractions of Ssd1p remained as stable complexes. Ssd1p may form a stable complex not only with proteins but also with certain RNA molecules, and formation of such a complex may be necessary for expressing exoribonuclease activity. Post-translational modification of Ssd1p also may contribute to the expression of exoribonuclease activity; Ssd1p is phosphorylated in vivo (12Uesono Y. Fujita A. Toh-e A. Kikuchi Y. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 143: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), suggesting that the yet unidentified ribonuclease activity of Ssd1p may be tightly regulated by a certain protein kinase. Ssd1.1p, lacking the highly conserved region domain 3, could bind RNA more efficiently than Ssd1.0p as shown in Fig. 3, therefore, domain 3 seems to inhibit the association of Ssd1p with RNA. If Ssd1p is exoribonuclease, domain 3 may be necessary for its exoribonuclease activity rather than RNA binding, because the SSD1 gene requires domain 3 for its entire function as shown in Fig. 2. The major known RNA-binding motifs (5Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar) are not seen in the sequence of Ssd1p. Interestingly, the region necessary for interaction with RNA seems to be a region having domain 1 showing a weak similarity but not a region having highly conserved domain 3. Therefore, the region containing domain 1 of Ssd1p may be a new RNA binding motif. The DSS1 gene has been isolated as a multicopy suppressor of the disruptant of SUV3, encoding putative RNA helicase, involved in mitochondrial RNA metabolism. It has been reported that the amino terminus of Dss1p is predicted to have a mitochondrial targeting sequence and that the dss1 disruptant is viable but does not grow in a glycerol medium (14Dmochowska A. Golik P. Stepien P.P. Curr. Genet. 1995; 28: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). From these findings, Dss1p seems to localize in mitochondria. On the other hand, the ScDis3p of S. cerevisiae shows a high identity with the SpDis3p of S. pombe throughout the length (27Noguchi E. Hayashi N. Azuma Y. Seki T. Nakamura M. Nakashima N. Yanagida M. He X. Mueller U. Sazer S. Nishimoto T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5595-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), while Ssd1p and Dss1p show low identities. In addition, Noguchi et al. (27Noguchi E. Hayashi N. Azuma Y. Seki T. Nakamura M. Nakashima N. Yanagida M. He X. Mueller U. Sazer S. Nishimoto T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5595-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) have also reported that ScDIS3 was able to rescue the dis3mutant of S. pombe, while Kinoshita et al. (13Kinoshita N. Goebl M. Yanagida M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5839-5847Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) have reported that SSD1 could not. These findings indicate that ScDIS3, but not SSD1, is a counterpart ofdis3 + of S. pombe. Thedis3 + gene product of S. pombelocalizes mainly in the nucleus (13Kinoshita N. Goebl M. Yanagida M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5839-5847Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), suggesting that theScDIS3 gene product localizes in nucleus. Intracellular localization of Dss1p and ScDis3p is in a clear contrast to that of Ssd1p, which was mainly localized in the cytoplasm as shown in Fig. 5. These observations suggest an interesting possibility that these three proteins of S. cerevisiae having similarity with RNase II ofE. coli, Dss1p, ScDis3p, and Ssd1p associate with mitochondrial RNA, nuclear RNA, and cytoplasmic RNA, respectively. The fact that Ssd1p was mainly localized in cytoplasm suggests that the target of Ssd1p could be RNA in cytoplasm including rRNA, mRNA, or others. It has been reported that the cyt4 mutant inN. crassa had several defects including maturation of rRNA in mitochondria (40Garriga G. Bertrand H. Lambowitz A.M. Cell. 1984; 36: 623-634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, rRNA prepared from the ssd1disruptant did not show any remarkable difference in its maturation or concentration, in comparison with rRNA prepared from wild type cells (data not shown). In addition, Ssd1p was not cofractionated either with ribosomes or with polysomes, as shown in Fig. 7. Thus, the target of Ssd1p does not seem to be rRNA. We could not detect Ssd1p in UV-cross-linked polyadenylated RNA-RNPs (data not shown). Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate direct interaction of Ssd1p with mRNA. Immunoblotting analysis using anti-Ssd1p antibody recognizing its N-terminal region revealed that the Ssd1-d2 protein in W303 used as wild type strain was detected as an 83-kDa protein (data not shown). This protein may be a C-terminal truncated protein lacking all of the domain 1, 2, and 3 regions, suggesting that the Ssd1-d2 protein may also be a nonfunctional protein. The Ssd1-d protein of another wild type strain, YPH499, was also the same size as that of W303 (data not shown). These results suggest that a ssd1-d mutation is widely spread among many laboratories' strains. The ssd1-dmutation results in a subtle phenotype, such as caffeine-sensitive (6Sutton A. Immanuel D. Arndt K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2133-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and leaky temperature-sensitive. However, when it is combined with another mutation such as sit4, the double mutation causes a severer temperature-sensitive phenotype (synthetic lethal) than either of the single mutations (6Sutton A.

Mutations that show synthetic lethality withssd1-d seem to be involved in the transcriptional regulation of certain genes: 1) sit4 (41Fernandez-Sarabia M.J. Sutton A. Zhong T. Arndt K.T.

These genetic characteristics displayed by thessd1 mutation, in addition to the fact that Ssd1p is a cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein, suggest that SSD1 may be involved in the expression of various genes at the post-transcriptional level by controlling RNA metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2143069218,"In human T-lymphocytes the Src family protein tyrosine kinase p59 fyn associates with three phosphoproteins of 43, 55, and 85 kDa (pp43, pp55, and pp85). Employing a GST-Fyn-Src homology 2 (SH2) domain fusion protein pp55 was purified from lysates of Jurkat T-cells. Molecular cloning of the pp55 cDNA reveals that the pp55 gene codes for a so far nondescribed polypeptide of 359 amino acids that comprises a pleckstrin homology domain, a C-terminal SH3 domain, as well as several potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites, among which one fulfills the criteria to bind Src-like SH2 domains with high affinity.

Full-Text PDF Open Access T-lymphocyte activation is initiated following recognition of antigenic peptides in the context of autologous major histocompatibility complex molecules by the clonotypic T-cell receptor (TCR). 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T-cell receptor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HPLC, reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PH, pleckstrin homology; PI, phosphatidylinositol; SH2 and SH3, Src homology 2 and 3; PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase. The activation of cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and the phosphorylation of a limited number of intracellular and transmembrane proteins on tyrosine residues represent the earliest events that are detectable following engagement of the TCR. p56 lck and p59 fyn, two Src family PTKs are activated as a result of TCR-triggering (1Danielian S.

Whereas the role of Lck during T-cell activation and T-cell development is well documented, the precise function of Fyn in signaling processes in T-lymphocytes remains to be defined. A role for Fyn has been established during T-cell development, as well as during the initiation of the TCR-mediated signaling cascade. Thus it was shown that transition from immature double positive thymocytes (CD4+ CD8+) to mature single positive cells (CD4+ CD8− or CD4−CD8+) during T-cell maturation is accompanied by an increase in TCR expression and a concomitant elevation of the expression level of p59 fyn (4Cooke M.P. Abraham K.M. Forbush K.A. Perlmutter R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 281-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Furthermore, increased expression of Fyn transcripts in thymocytes of transgenic mice leads to the production of cells exerting enhanced capacity to respond to TCR engagement. Conversely, overexpression of a catalytically inactive form of Fyn substantially inhibits TCR-mediated activation in otherwise normal thymocytes (4Cooke M.P. Abraham K.M. Forbush K.A. Perlmutter R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 281-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Finally, the disruption of the Fyn gene by homologous recombination in mice results in animals exhibiting a specific lymphoid defect: thymocytes of Fyn knock-out mice are unresponsive to stimulation through the TCR, whereas peripheral T-cells reacquire significant signaling capabilities (5Appleby M.W. Gross J.A. Cooke M.P. Levin S.D. Qian X. Perlmutter R.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 751-763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 6Stein P.L. Lee H.-M. Rich S. Soriano P. Cell. 1992; 70: 741-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). These observations suggest a critical role for Fyn in TCR signaling during late stages of thymocyte development. However, it remains to be established whether the normal responses of peripheral T-cells in Fyn-deficient mice reflect outgrowth of clones that no longer require Fyn activity or where Fyn function has been compensated by another PTK. The involvement of Fyn in the activation of peripheral T-cells initially emerged from the observation that Fyn associates with the TCR-CD3 complex (7Sarosi G.A. Thomas P.M. Egerton M. Phillips A.F.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23642-23647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, mature T-cell lines underexpressing p59 fyn have been shown to exhibit TCR signaling defects, namely a reduction of protein phosphorylation on tyrosine residues or a lower mobilization of calcium following TCR-CD3 activation when compared with wild type cells (9Lee S.-K. Shaw A. Maher S.E. Bothwell A.L.M. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1621-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 10Rigley K. Slocombe P. Wahid S. Mandair K. Bebbington C. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1136-1145PubMed Google Scholar). In other studies, overexpression of a constitutively active form of Fyn was shown to up-regulate the sensitivity of a T-cell hybridoma toward TCR binding (11Davidson D. Chow L.M.L. Fournel M. Veillette A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1483-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In addition, increasing evidence supports a role for Fyn in the recruitment and activation of the ZAP70 kinase during T-cell activation (12Chan A.C. Iwashima M. Turck C.W. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 71: 649-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 13Iwashima M. Irving B.A. van Oers N.S.C. Chan A.C. Weiss A.

A major challenge in understanding the role(s) of p59 fyn during T-cell activation will be to define its functional interactions with other cellular proteins. Until now, a limited number of proteins have been shown to interact with p59 fyn through its SH2 and/or SH3 domain. Among these are the PI 3-kinase (15Pleiman C.M. Hertz W.M. Cambier J.C.

In this paper, we describe the purification and molecular cloning of a 55-kDa phosphoprotein (pp55) that interacts with Fyn in vivo. pp55 is a novel polypeptide of 359 amino acids that contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a C-terminal SH3 domain, as well as several potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites, among which at least one is highly homologous to the phosphotyrosine-containing sequence (YEEI) that has previously been shown to bind to SH2 domains of Src kinases with high affinity. By Northern blot analysis we demonstrate that pp55 is preferentially expressed in lymphatic tissues. In vitro binding studies show that pp55 selectively binds to Src kinase SH2 domains. Therefore the protein was termed SKAP55 ( s rc kinase-associatedphosphoprotein of 55 kDa). Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 2% glutamin (Life Technologies, Inc.), in 7% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. Resting human T-lymphocytes were prepared from heparinized blood of healthy donors as described previously (23Schraven B. Samstag Y. Altevogt P. Meuer S.C. Nature. 1990; 345: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Anti-p56 lck and anti-p59 fyn antisera (kindly provided by Dr. A. Veillette, McGill Cancer Center, McGill University, Montreal, Canada) were used at a 1:100 (v/v) dilution in immunoprecipitation experiments. The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) and used at 1 μg/ml for immunoblot analysis. A polyclonal antiserum directed against SKAP55 was raised in rabbits immunized with a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 49–74 and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, as described previously (24Schraven B. Schoenhaut D. Bruyns E. Koretzky G. Eckerskorn C. Wallich R. Kirchgessner H. Sakorafas P. Labkovsky B. Ratnofsky S. Meuer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29102-29111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Large scale purification of proteins interacting with the SH2 domain of Fyn was performed using a GST-Fyn-SH2 fusion protein as described previously (20Marie-Cardine A. Kirchgessner H. Eckerskorn C. Meuer S.C. Schraven B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3290-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Precipitated proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining of the gel. Prior to electrophoresis the precipitates were spiked with an in vitro radiolabeled Fyn immunoprecipitate obtained from resting T-lymphocytes to allow the localization of proteins of interest. The protein spot corresponding to SKAP55 was cut out from the gels and subjected to digestion using endoproteinase-Lys-C (Boehringer Mannheim). The generated peptides were separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and subjected to amino acid microsequencing (25Eckerskorn C. Mewes W. Goretski H. Lottspeich F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to the sequenced peptides (namely, 5′-AARGGNGCNCARGARCTNGA-3′ and 5′-TTYTGCCAYTCRCTNCCRAA-3′) were synthesized and used in polymerase chain reactions to amplify Jurkat cells cDNA. The resulting fragment was sequenced and used further as a probe to screen a λ ZAP cDNA library derived from human blood (Stratagene). The DNA sequence of the positive clones was determined by standard DNA sequencing of both strands. Two Northern blot filters containing approximately 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA/lane from various human tissues (CLONTECH) were hybridized with a radiolabeled probe corresponding to nucleotides 298–325 of clone 5.2 according to the manufacturer's procedures. Freshly prepared human resting T-lymphocytes (40 × 106) were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mmsodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) at 4 °C for 1 h. Post-nuclear lysates were subjected to anti-p56 lck or anti-p59 fyn immunoprecipitation and when necessary subjected toin vitro kinase assay as described previously (20Marie-Cardine A. Kirchgessner H. Eckerskorn C. Meuer S.C. Schraven B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3290-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Alternatively, SH2 domains from various signaling molecules expressed as GST fusion protein were used (20Marie-Cardine A. Kirchgessner H. Eckerskorn C. Meuer S.C. Schraven B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3290-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Precipitated proteins were released using 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer supplemented with 8m urea and separated by means of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis or by conventional SDS-10% PAGE. Western blots analysis was performed using standard procedures that have been described elsewhere (20Marie-Cardine A. Kirchgessner H. Eckerskorn C. Meuer S.C. Schraven B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3290-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify proteins that interact with p59 fyn, Nonidet P-40 lysates of freshly prepared resting human T-lymphocytes were subjected to immunoprecipitation using specific antisera directed against p59 fyn and p56 lck . The proteins that co-precipitate with each kinase were subsequently resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and subjected to anti-phosphotyrosine Western blotting. Fig.1 A demonstrates that under these experimental conditions three tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with apparent molecular masses of 43, 55, and 85 kDa are detectable in the Fyn immunoprecipitate. The same proteins are phosphorylated in an in vitro kinase assay of a Fyn immunoprecipitate prepared from resting T-cells (Fig. 1 B). In addition, the 55- and 85-kDa proteins are also precipitated by a recombinant Fyn-SH2 domain from Nonidet P-40 lysates of Jurkat cells (Fig. 1 C), suggesting that their interaction with Fyn could be mediated via the SH2 domain of the kinase. In contrast to Fyn, the anti-Lck precipitate consists of a unique protein spot that corresponds to p56 lck (Fig.1 D). Furthermore, none of the Fyn-associated phosphoproteins was found to associate with the third Src PTK expressed in T-lymphocytes, p62 yes (not shown). These data suggest a selective association between Fyn and tyrosine phosphorylated pp43, pp55, and pp85 and further corroborate the idea of differential compositions of the Fyn and Lck complexes in human T-lymphocytes as suggested by others and us (20Marie-Cardine A. Kirchgessner H. Eckerskorn C. Meuer S.C. Schraven B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3290-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21da Silva A.J. Janssen O. Rudd C.E. J. Exp.

Because none of the Fyn-associated proteins described above was identified by antibodies or antisera directed against known signaling molecules expressed in human T-lymphocytes, we attempted their purification and molecular characterization. To this end a GST-Fyn-SH2 fusion protein coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads was employed to precipitate tyrosine phosphorylated polypeptides from lysates of pervanadate-treated Jurkat T-cells. Whereas the amounts of pp43 and pp85 were below the level of detection under these conditions, high amounts of the 55-kDa Fyn-associated protein (pp55) were obtained. The Coomassie spots corresponding to pp55 were excised from the gels, digested with endoproteinase-Lys-C, purified by HPLC, and subjected to microsequencing. Amino acid sequence was obtained from two peptides (Fig. 2). Combinations of degenerate oligonucleotides deduced from these two peptides were used in polymerase chain reactions on Jurkat cDNA and led to the isolation of a ∼100-base pair fragment. This fragment was used to screen a λ ZAP cDNA library from human blood, which resulted in the identification of several cDNA clones. Fig. 2 shows the DNA sequence, determined from both strands, of the longest clone (clone 5.2). DNA sequencing of the remaining clones indicated that they were derived from the same gene as clone 5.2. The cDNA sequence was further confirmed by sequencing the products resulting from 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends experiments performed on human leukocyte cDNA (not shown). As shown in Fig. 2, clone 5.2 contains a 1542-base pair cDNA insert with an open reading frame that starts at nucleotide 71 and terminates at nucleotide 1150. The cDNA sequence codes for a 359-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 41.3 kDa, which also contains the two peptides that were identified by microsequencing of purified pp55. Transfection of Jurkat cells with pp55 cDNA resulted in the overexpression of a 55-kDa protein that co-migrates with the endogenously expressed pp55 (not shown), suggesting that conformational effects and/or post-translational modifications could influence the mobility of pp55 in SDS-PAGE. Using a polyclonal pp55 antiserum, a constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated protein of 55 kDa is precipitated from lysates of resting human T-lymphocytes (Fig.3, A and B). Perhaps more importantly, analysis of a Fyn immunoprecipitate by means of anti-pp55 Western blotting revealed that the 55-kDa phosphoprotein that co-precipitates with p59 fyn in resting T-lymphocytes exactly co-migrates with pp55 (Fig. 3, compare C and D). Collectively these data demonstrate that clone 5.2 represents a full-length cDNA clone coding for the Fyn-associated pp55 molecule. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of pp55 with all available data bases showed that the pp55 cDNA encodes a so far not described protein that contains a PH domain (residues 106–205), a C-terminal SH3 domain (amino acids 300–356), and several putative phosphorylation sites (Fig. 2). Importantly, one potential tyrosine phosphorylation site is part of the peptide sequence268EDIYEVL274, which would be predicted to bind to isolated SH2 domains of Src PTKs with high affinity based on its homology with the EXXYXXL motif (28Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar). To further assess this possibility we investigated the capacity of SH2 domains derived from p56 lck, p59 fyn, p56 lyn, p60 src, PI 3-kinase, ZAP70, Syk, c-abl, Shc, SLP-76, and Grb2 to bind to endogenously expressed pp55. To this end the individual SH2 domains were expressed as GST fusion proteins, coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads, and incubated with a Nonidet P-40 lysate of Jurkat T-cells. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-pp55 antiserum. Fig. 4 demonstrates that pp55 preferentially binds to the isolated SH2 domains of Fyn, Lyn, Src and Lck, whereas no signal is obtained when the SH2 domains of PI 3-kinase, ZAP70, Syk, Shc, SLP-76, Grb2, or c-abl are used for precipitation. Due to the highly selective interaction with Src-like SH2 domains, we termed the protein SKAP55. The finding that SKAP55 equally binds to the isolated Fyn and Lck SH2 domains whereas it is not detectable as a tyrosine phosphorylated protein in Lck immunoprecipitates (see Fig. 1) obtained from resting T-lymphocytes resembles the situation we have previously reported for α-tubulin (20Marie-Cardine A. Kirchgessner H. Eckerskorn C. Meuer S.C. Schraven B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3290-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). SKAP55 mRNA expression was determined by Northern blot analysis employing poly(A)+ RNA obtained from a variety of primary human tissues. Fig. 5 A shows that the 1.5-kilobase SKAP55 transcript is highly expressed in thymocytes and peripheral blood lymphocytes and to a lesser extent in spleen cells. A positive signal was also detected in testis at a slightly higher molecular mass. This could indicate the existence of an alternatively spliced form of pp55 or of a highly related gene expressed in this organ. The latter possibility is supported by our finding that hybridization of human genomic DNA with a full-length SKAP55 cDNA probe results in appearance of several distinct bands (not shown). No SKAP55-specific transcript was observed in any of the other tissues that were analyzed (Fig. 5 A). These data show that pp55 is preferentially expressed in lymphatic organs. Among transformed cells of hematopoietic origin SKAP55 was exclusively detected in Fyn-SH2 precipitates prepared from lysates of Jurkat cells but not in precipitates obtained from the erythroleukemic cell line K562, the Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell line LAZ-509 and the myeloid cell lines HL60 and U937 (Fig. 5 B). Identical results as shown here for Fyn-SH2 precipitates were obtained when whole cell lysates were probed with SKAP55 antibodies (not shown), supporting the idea that SKAP55 is preferentially expressed in T-lymphocytes. In summary we have identified and cloned a novel cytoplasmic protein, SKAP55, which is preferentially expressed in human T-lymphocytes where it specifically interacts with the protein-tyrosine kinase p59 fyn . The presence of a PH domain and a SH3 domain suggests that SKAP55 is capable of interacting with several other intracellular proteins and thus could represent a novel adaptor protein involved in Fyn-mediated signaling. The constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation and Fyn-association of SKAP55 in nonstimulated T-lymphocytes further could suggest that SKAP55 exerts its signaling function even in the absence of external stimuli. Consistent with this assumption is that we have so far observed no alterations in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of SKAP55 or in its association with Fyn following short time stimulation of T-lymphocytes through the TCR-CD3 complex. Vanadate treatment of T-lymphocytes, which is believed to concomitantly activate PTKs and inhibit protein-tyrosine phosphatases, also not alters the tyrosine phosphorylation status of SKAP55 or its association with Fyn (not shown). However, the quality of the signal that is mediatedvia SKAP55 as well as potential modifications of this signal during T-cell activation have to be determined in further studies. In addition it will be of importance to identify the 43- and the 85-kDa phosphoproteins, which also constitutively associate with Fyn in T-lymphocytes. We thank Drs. S. Ratnofsky, S. Fischer, and J. Wienands for kindly providing the GST-SH2 domain constructs and Dr. T. Gibson for help in the identification of the PH domain. C. Schwarz is thanked for technical assistance."

We have shown previously that activated CaM-KIV can activate the mitogen-activated protein kinases (Enslen, H., Tokumitsu, H., Stork, P. J. S., Davis, R. J., and Soderling, T. R. (1996) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.</i> 93, 10803–10808), and the present paper describes a novel regulatory cross-talk between cAMP kinase (PKA) and CaM-KK. PKA gave rapid phosphorylation <i>in vitro</i> and in cells of recombinant CaM-KK, resulting in 50–75% inhibition of CaM-KK activity, part of which was due to suppression of CaM-binding by phosphorylation of Ser<sup>458</sup> in the CaM-binding domain. However, the Ser<sup>458</sup> → Ala mutant, or a truncation mutant in which the CaM-binding and autoinhibitory domains were deleted, was still partially suppressed by PKA-mediated phosphorylation. The second inhibitory site was identified as Thr<sup>108</sup> by site-specific mutagenesis. Treatments of COS-7, PC12, hippocampal, or Jurkat cells with the PKA activators forskolin or isoproterenol gave 30–90% inhibition of either endogenous or transfected CaM-KK and/or CaM-KIV activities. These results demonstrate that the CaM kinase cascade is negatively regulated in cells by the cAMP/PKA pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2090305070,"Rho regulates cytoskeletal actin structure and integrin-mediated cell adhesion. Rho also has a role in cell growth regulation and is required for cell transformation by oncogenic Ras. Recently, it has been demonstrated that Rho can activate transcription from the c-fos serum response element (SRE). This raised the possibility that functions required for Rho-mediated cell transformation might overlap with those involved in transcriptional regulation. Here we show that RhoB can activate the SRE and can synergize in cell transformation with constitutively activated Raf-CAAX.

The Rho family GTP-binding proteins, whose members include Rho, Rac, and CDC42, have been shown to influence a number of cellular processes including motility, adhesion, and proliferation (1Takaishi K.

Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The signaling pathways responsible for these diverse effects are currently an area of intense research (6Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Early studies have established that a major function of Rho proteins is the regulation of cytoskeletal actin architecture with different Rho family members inducing distinct cellular actin structures (reviewed in Ref. 6Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Recent work has indicated that Rho proteins can promote cell growth and transformation (reviewed in Ref. 7Symons M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). One protein that is likely to have a physiological role is RhoB. Unlike most members of the Rho family, RhoB is a growth factor- and oncogene-induced immediate early gene product that is regulated during the cell cycle (8Jahner D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3682-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 9Zalcman G. Closson V. Linares-Cruz G. Lerebours F. Honore N. Tavitian A. Olofsson B. Oncogene. 1995; 1085: 1935-1945Google Scholar). While weakly oncogenic on its own, RhoB is required for the initiation and maintenance of transformation by oncogenic Ras (10Lebowitz P.F. Davide J.P.

Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2289-2296PubMed Google Scholar). Additional support for a role in cell transformation is provided by evidence that RhoB is a critical target of farnesyltransferase inhibitors (10Lebowitz P.F. Davide J.P. Prendergast G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6613-6622Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 12Lebowitz P. Sakamuro D. Prendergast G.C. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 708-713PubMed Google Scholar,13Lebowitz P. Casey P.J.

Oliff A. Kohl N.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 175-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying the transformation-promoting effects of RhoB are unknown. Recently, work on the closely related RhoA protein showed that it can stimulate transcription through the serum response element (SRE) 1The abbreviations used are: SRE, serum response element; SRF, serum response factor; HA, hemaglutinin; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. (15Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar), a regulatory sequence found in the c-fos promoter and many other mitogen-regulated promoters (16Treisman R.

This finding raised the possibility that the transforming capabilities of RhoB might be mediated by its transcriptional effects. For this reason, we were interested in determining whether RhoB could also activate the SRE and, if so, whether this activity overlapped with its cell transforming functions. Like other Ras superfamily proteins, Rho proteins are post-translationally prenylated at their C terminus (18Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 19Marshall C.J. Science. 1993; 259: 1865-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Prenylation involves the covalent thioether linkage of either a farnesyl or geranylgeranyl moiety to the C-terminal cysteine residue of Rho and is likely critical for proper membrane localization and some protein-protein interactions (18Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 19Marshall C.J. Science. 1993; 259: 1865-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). It is generally thought that Rho proteins, as well as other Ras superfamily small GTP-binding proteins, require prenylation to function. In this study, we report that while prenylation is essential to Rho transformation potential, the modification is not required for activation of SRF-mediated transcription. Our work suggests a divergence in Rho pathways leading to transformation and SRE transcription. HA-RhoBV14 has been described previously (10Lebowitz P.F. Davide J.P. Prendergast G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6613-6622Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 11Prendergast G.C. Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Kurzawa H. Lebowitz P.F. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2289-2296PubMed Google Scholar). Standard polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis techniques were used to generate the C193S mutant HA-RhoBVS, the T37A mutant HA-RhoBVA, and HA-RhoAV14. All constructs were expressed from the cytomegalovirus enhancer/promoter-containing vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The SRE reporter construct, 3D.ACAT, was a gift from R. Treisman (Imperial Cancer Research Fund Laboratories). The SRE sequences present in this reporter are as follows: aattGGATGTCCATATTAGGACATCT, where linker sequences are lowercase and SRF sites are bold (15Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). The Raf-CAAXconstruct was a gift of M. Symons (Onyx Pharmaceuticals). NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and transfected using a modified calcium phosphate method (25Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). For foci assays, 5 × 105 cells were transfected with plasmids as indicated in the figure legends and passaged into three dishes the day after transfection. Cell foci were scored 12–14 days later by fixing with methanol and staining with crystal violet. COS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. COS cells were transfected by a modified DEAE-dextran method (26Margolin J.F. Friedman J.R. Meyer W.K. Vissing H. Thiesen H.J. Rauscher F.J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4509-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin, and leupeptin (25Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were clarified by microcentrifugation and quantitated by Bradford assay. Total cellular protein (50 μg) was fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and analyzed as described (27Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The anti-HA antibody, 12CA5, was used at 2.5 μg/ml. A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody was used at a 1:5000 dilution to detect 12CA5 bound to Western blots (Boehringer Mannheim). Antibody complexes were detected by a chemiluminescence kit using reagents and a protocol provided by the vendor (Pierce). NIH3T3 cells (4 × 105/10-cm dish) were transfected by a modified calcium phosphate method with plasmid indicated in the figure legends. Cells were transfected with 6 μg of 3D.ACAT, 6 μg of Rho constructs or vector, and 2 μg of CMV-βgal (to normalize for transfection efficiency). Total amount of DNA was brought up to 25 μg with sonicated salmon sperm DNA. The cells were harvested and lysed using 1 × reporter lysis buffer using a protocol provided by the vendor (Promega). The β-galactosidase activity in cell lysates was determined by mixing 150 μl of lysate and 150 μl of 2 × assay buffer (120 mm Na2HPO4, 80 mm NaH2PO4, 2 mmMgCl2, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1.33 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside) and incubating at 37 °C for 15–30 min. After this time, 500 ml of 1m Na2CO3 was added, and the absorbance at OD420 was measured. To determine relative CAT activity, normalized amounts of cell lysate were incubated at 37 °C with 0.2 mg/ml n-butyryl-CoA and 24 μm (50 μCi/mmol) [14C]chloramphenicol in a total volume of 125 μl. [14C]Chloramphenicol was extracted from reactions with ethyl acetate, fractionated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and detected by fluorography. CAT activity on TLC plates was quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). It has previously been shown that RhoA, Rac1, and CDC42 can activate the SRE of the c-fos promoter in a manner that depends upon SRF but not the associated ternary complex factor (15Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar, 16Treisman R. Trends Biochem.

Although RhoB is ∼85% identical to RhoA, it has a radically different subcellular localization; while RhoA is localized primarily in the plasma membrane and cytosol, RhoB is localized in internal vesicles and the nuclear membrane (9Zalcman G. Closson V. Linares-Cruz G. Lerebours F. Honore N. Tavitian A. Olofsson B. Oncogene. 1995; 1085: 1935-1945Google Scholar, 10Lebowitz P.F. Davide J.P. Prendergast G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6613-6622Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar,20Adamson P. Paterson H.F. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). 2G. C. Prendergast, unpublished results. Thus despite the similarity between RhoA and RhoB, it was not entirely clear whether RhoB would also be able to activate SRF-mediated transcription. To investigate this question, we examined the ability of an activated form of RhoB, HA-RhoBV14, to activate SRF in NIH3T3 cells. Rho-specific activation of SRF was monitored by employing the CAT reporter plasmid 3D.ACAT, which contains three c-fos-derived SRF-binding sites but lacks the adjacent elements for ternary complex factor binding that are commonly found at SREs (15Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). In this assay, there was a >15-fold increase in transcriptional activation by HA-RhoBV14 compared with vector, an activity that was comparable with that of HA-RhoAV14 (see Fig.1 A). We, therefore, concluded that despite differences in cellular localization, both RhoB and RhoA communicate with the SRE. To further analyze RhoB activation of SRF-mediated transcription, HA-RhoBV14 constructs were generated that included point mutations in either the prenylation acceptor site or the effector domain; both mutations were predicted to cause a loss of Rho activity. The CAAX motif mutation C193S abolishes prenylation of the protein and eliminates the normal localization of RhoB to cytoplasmic vesicles and the nuclear membrane (10Lebowitz P.F. Davide J.P. Prendergast G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6613-6622Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 20Adamson P. Paterson H.F. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar).2 Since prenylation is believed to be necessary for the physiological function of Ras superfamily proteins, the activated, unprenylated mutant, designated RhoBVS, would be predicted to be nonfunctional. The effector mutant, designated RhoBVA, was engineered to contain a T37A mutation in the putative effector domain of RhoB. An analogous effector mutation in RhoA has been demonstrated to eliminate its stress fiber-inducing activity (21Paterson H.F. Self A.J. Garrett M.D. Just I. Aktories K. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar); thus, this mutation would also be expected to destroy physiological RhoB functions. A dominant negative RhoB mutant, designated RhoBN19, has been described previously (11Prendergast G.C. Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Kurzawa H. Lebowitz P.F. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2289-2296PubMed Google Scholar); this construct encodes a protein that preferentially binds GDP and has been shown to inhibit Rho function likely by competing for upstream activators (11Prendergast G.C. Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Kurzawa H. Lebowitz P.F. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2289-2296PubMed Google Scholar). Western analysis demonstrated that each mutant protein accumulated to similar levels in transiently transfected COS cells (see Fig. 2). NIH3T3 cells were cotransfected with 3D.ACAT and RhoB expression vectors to test the ability of the RhoB mutants to activate transcription via SRF. Interestingly, while the effector mutation in RhoBVA abolished SRF activation, the prenylation mutation in RhoBVS had no effect (see Fig. 1 B). The RhoBVA result indicated that Rho effector functions are required for RhoB to activate SRF, similar to RhoA (15Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). Consistent with physiological activation, GTP binding was also required to activate SRF, because the dominant inhibitory RhoB mutant, RhoBN19, lacked activity. The RhoBVS result indicated that unprenylated forms of RhoB can also activate SRF. We concluded that effector functions, but not prenylation, are required for RhoB to induce SRE-mediated transcription. The ability of RhoBVS to activate transcription raised the prospect that the cell transforming functions of RhoB might also be prenylation-independent. To test this possibility, we compared the transformation capabilities of HA-RhoBVS, HA-RhoBVA, and HA-RhoBV14 in focus formation assays. RhoBV14 potentiates focus formation by oncogenic Ras (11Prendergast G.C. Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Kurzawa H. Lebowitz P.F. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2289-2296PubMed Google Scholar), but the ∼2-fold activity in this type of experiment was too weak for a significant comparison of RhoB mutant activities (data not shown). Therefore, we turned instead to a Rho-Raf cooperation assay, which has been used successfully to examine the transforming potential of activated RhoA (22Qiu R.-G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 23Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Kinch M.S. Burridge K. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). This assay is based on a strong synergism which occurs when cells are cotransfected with activated RhoA and a Raf construct, Raf-CAAX, which are each quite weakly transforming on their own. Raf-CAAX includes a C-terminal CAAX motif that allows it to be prenylated and to associate constitutively with the plasma membrane; this modification confers a weak Ras-independent transforming ability (24Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). In this assay, we observed that RhoBV14 synergistically transformed NIH3T3 cells with Raf-CAAX (see Fig. 3 A). As expected, the effector mutation in RhoBVA abolished cooperation with Raf-CAAX (see Fig. 3 B). In addition, the prenylation mutation in RhoBVS eliminated its ability to cooperate with Raf-CAAX, despite the fact that this mutant could activate SRF. We concluded that prenylation of RhoB is necessary for its transforming functions but not its transcriptional effects. The finding of an prenylation-independent Rho function is notable given the widely held assumption that prenylation of Rho is necessary for its physiological functions. One possible interpretation is that SRF-mediated transcriptional activation is not a true physiological function of RhoB. However, since effector function and GTP-binding status were critical to RhoB activation of SRF-mediated transcription, another interpretation is that there exists a Rho-mediated effect on SRF, which is mechanistically novel. In addition to demonstrating a prenylation-independent RhoB activity, our results indicate that Rho transcriptional activation of the SRE is clearly insufficient for transformation. The finding that RhoBVS can activate transcription but is unable to transform argues that other RhoB pathways must be required for transformation. A number of potential Rho-binding proteins and functions have been defined which might be critical to transformation ability; future study should define potential transforming roles soon (reviewed in Ref. 6Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). While we have shown that SRF-mediated transcriptional activation is not sufficient for transformation, it is not yet clear if it is necessary. Further mutational analysis is required to determine the importance of various Rho functions in transformation. For provision of reagents, we thank R. Treisman (Imperial Cancer Research Fund Laboratories) for the SRE reporter plasmid 3D.ACAT and M. Symons (Onyx Pharmaceuticals) for the Raf-CAAX expression vector. We thank P. Lieberman, J.

https://openalex.org/W1975671269,"To identify genes necessary for sphingolipid synthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae we developed a procedure to enrich for mutants unable to incorporate exogenous long chain base into sphingolipids. We show here that a mutant strain, AG84-3, isolated by using the enrichment procedure, makes sphingolipids from endogenously synthesized but not from exogenously supplied long chain base. A gene termed LCB3 (YJL134W, GenBank designation X87371x21), which complements the long chain base utilization defect of strain AG84-3, was isolated from a genomic DNA library. The gene is predicted to encode a protein with multiple membrane-spanning domains and a COOH-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositiol cleavage/attachment site. Deletion of thelcb3 gene in a wild type genetic background reduces the rate of exogenous long chain base incorporation into sphingolipids and makes the host strain more resistant to growth inhibition by long chain bases. Only one protein in current data bases, the S. cerevisiae open-reading frame YKR053C, whose function is unknown, shows homology to the Lcb3 protein. The two proteins are not, however, functional homologs because deletion of theYKR053C open reading frame does not impair long chain base utilization or enhance resistance of cells to growth inhibition by long chain bases. Based upon these data we hypothesize that the Lcb3 protein is a plasma membrane transporter capable of transporting sphingoid long chain bases into cells. It is the first candidate for such a transporter and the first member of what appears to be a new class of membrane-bound proteins.

It is the first candidate for such a transporter and the first member of what appears to be a new class of membrane-bound proteins. Sphingolipids comprise a diverse group of complex lipids found primarily in the plasma membrane of all known eukaryotes. Knowledge of the structures and functions of sphingolipids has expanded at an increasing rate, but much less is known about the enzymes and genes needed for synthesis of sphingolipids. In one approach to identify sphingolipid biosynthetic genes, our laboratory devised a unique procedure for isolating mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiaedefective in sphingolipid synthesis. As described here, this approach led to the isolation and characterization of a strain defective in the incorporation of exogenous sphingoid long chain bases into sphingolipids. Synthesis of the long chain base component of sphingolipids (Fig.1) begins with the condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA to yield 3-ketosphinganine. This essentially irreversible reaction is catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase (3-ketosphinganine synthase (EC 2.3.1.50); for review, see Ref. 1Merrill Jr., A.H. Jones D.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), encoded by theLCB1 (2Buede R. Rinker-Schaffer C. Pinto W.J. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4325-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and LCB2 (3Nagiec M.M. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7899-7902Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) genes. The 3-ketosphinganine is converted to the long chain base sphinganine (dihydrosphingosine) which is N-fatty-acylated to yield dihydroceramide. Dehydrogenation of dihydroceramide in animals yields ceramide containing the long chain base sphingosine, which is rapidly converted to sphingolipids by the addition of polar components to the 1-hydroxyl group. The predominant ceramides in fungi and plants containN-α-hydroxyfatty-acylphytosphingosine (4Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 253-272PubMed Google Scholar) formed by undefined hydroxylation reactions. Phytosphingosine (PHS) 1The abbreviations used are: PHS, phytosphingosine; IPC, inositol phosphorylceramide; MIPC, mannose-inositol-P-ceramide; M(IP)2C, mannose-(inositol-P)2-ceramide; SLC, sphingolipid compensatory; kb, kilobase(s); PI, phosphatidylinositol. lacks the 4,5-double bond found in sphingosine and has instead an hydroxyl group at the 4 position (Fig.1). In S. cerevisiae and other fungi the 1-hydroxyl of phytoceramide is modified by addition of myo-inositol phosphate to form IPC which is then mannosylated to yield mannose-inositol-P-ceramide (MIPC). The final step in S. cerevisiae sphingolipid synthesis is the addition of inositol-P to MIPC to yield the major sphingolipid mannose-(inositol-P)2-ceramide (M(IP)2C; Refs.5Smith S.W. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3395-3405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Steiner S. Smith S. Waechter C.J. Lester R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We describe here a rationale and procedure for isolating mutants defective in synthesis of intermediates formed between 3-ketosphinganine and MIPC (Fig. 1). The procedure was designed to avoid the potential problems of growth inhibition and killing of cells by the buildup of a sphingolipid intermediate. It is known that exogenous N-acetyl-sphingosine (C2-ceramide) inhibits growth of S. cerevisiae cells (8Fishbein J.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Bielawska A. Garrett S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9255-9261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Nickels J.T. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 382-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), as does exogenous PHS. 2M. Skrzypek, R. L. Lester, and R. C. Dickson, manuscript in preparation. Growth inhibition and killing were avoided by using a sphingolipid compensatory (SLC) strain that can grow without making sphingolipids, unlike normal yeast strains that require sphingolipids for growth and viability (10Dickson R.C. Wells G.B. Schmidt A. Lester R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2176-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). SLC strain 7R6 carries two mutations, a deletion of the LCB1 gene and a point mutation that creates the suppressor gene SLC1-1 (11Nagiec M.M. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22156-22163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of exogenous long chain base, the suppressor gene causes cells to make novel glycerophospholipids that compensate for one or more functions of sphingolipids essential for vegetative growth (12Lester R.L. Wells G.B. Oxford G. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 845-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lcb1 mutation blocks the first committed step in sphingolipid synthesis, so no toxic sphingolipid intermediate should accumulate when cells are grown on medium lacking a long chain base. Thus if an SLC strain becomes mutated in, for example, the ceramide synthase gene (Fig. 1) the mutant strain should continue to grow without making sphingolipids because of the SLC1-1suppressor gene and should not accumulate a toxic long chain base intermediate because of the lcb1 mutation. The mutant derivative of 7R6 described here has an impaired ability to incorporate exogenous long chain bases into sphingolipids because of a mutation in the LCB3 gene (long chainbase). The Lcb3 protein is predicted to have several membrane-spanning domains, suggesting that it is a membrane-bound transporter or a facilitator of long chain base uptake. It is structurally but not functionally homologous to another yeast protein of unknown function. The Lcb3 protein is not homologous to any other predicted protein, thus it appears to be the first member of a new class of membrane-bound proteins with a potential transporter function. S. cerevisiae strains used in these studies are described in Table I. Culture conditions have been described previously (13Nagiec M.M. Nagiec E.E. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L.

The library was transformed (16Gietz R.D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 8: 1425Crossref Scopus (2895) Google Scholar) into strain AG84-3, and Leu+ transformants were selected on minimal agar plates lacking leucine, buffered with 50 mm sodium succinate, pH 5.5, and incubated at 30 °C for 10 days. About 15,000 transformants were tested by replica plating for colonies able to grow at 37 °C on defined agar plates lacking leucine and sodium succinate but containing 25 μm PHS. These conditions permitted growth of the parental strain 7R6 but restricted growth of the mutant derivative AG84-3. One out of 15 colonies that grew under these conditions contained a plasmid, pJAB15-1, with a 6.5-kb insert, which, when isolated by transformation into Escherichia coli and retransformed into strain AG84-3, gave transformants able to grow at 37 °C in the presence of PHS. The DNA sequence of a portion of the yeast insert was determined and compared with the GenBank data base using the BLAST algorithm (17Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70762) Google Scholar). Predicted restriction sites were used to subclone portions of the insert, carrying the complementing activity, into pRS315, yielding a 2.4-kb SpeI-MscI DNA fragment containing only one large open reading frame, YJL134W. Other subclones failed to complement. The lcb3-Δ1 deletion allele has the 522 base pairs between the BamHI and the NsiI sites of theLCB3 coding region replaced with pRS305 (LEU2, 15) to give MPRS305. MPRS305 was constructed by cloning a 3.1-kbPstI-BamHI DNA fragment from pJAB15-1, containing the promoter and 5′ end of the LCB3 gene, into pRS305 cut with the same restriction endonucleases. The resulting plasmid was cut with PstI and MscI and ligated with a 1-kbNsiI-MscI DNA fragment, containing the 3′-coding and flanking region of LCB3, obtained from pJAB15-1. Digestion of MPRS305 with MscI gives a linear DNA fragment with ends homologous to the 5′- and 3′-noncoding region ofLCB3. Yeast strains carrying the lcb3-Δ1 allele were made by transformation with this linear molecule followed by selection for Leu+ cells. Replacement of LCB3 by the deletion allele was verified by Southern blotting. A wild type allele of LCB3 was tagged at the HpaI site, located about 0.8 kb upstream of the LCB3 coding region, with the S. cerevisiae LEU2-selectable marker gene. The tagged allele was transformed into Leu− yeast cells as a 3.6-kb MscI DNA fragment with selection for Leu+ cells. Construction of pLCB1-5 began by inserting the S. cerevisiae ADE2 gene as a PstI-SpeI DNA fragment into pRS315 (15Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cut with the same restriction endonucleases. The resulting plasmid was cut with NaeI and SacI and ligated to the LCB1 gene obtained from pTZ18-LCB1 (2Buede R. Rinker-Schaffer C. Pinto W.J. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4325-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) as anNruI-SacI DNA fragment. A 2.3-kb DNA fragment containing the YKR053C open reading frame was made from genomic DNA by using the polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pRS315 as an EcoRI-PstI fragment to give pJAB2. Strain 7R6 was grown overnight in PYED (1% yeast extract (Difco), 2% Bacto-Peptone (Difco), 2% glucose, 50 mmsodium succinate (pH 5.0), inositol (50 mg/liter), and potassium phosphate monobasic (0.5 g/liter)) plus 25 μm PHS (referred to here as the medium) and then mutagenized with ethylmethanesulfonate to give 20% killing (18Pinto W.J. Srinivasan B. Shepherd S. Schmidt A. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2565-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenized cells were diluted to an absorbance at 600 nm (A 600) of 0.4 with medium, incubated with shaking at 30 °C for 7 h, during which time the A 600 increased to 2.5, centrifuged, resuspended in 2 ml of medium, and sonicated using a microtip (Heat Systems-Ultrasonic) for 2 min to disrupt clumped cells. One ml of cells was layered on 4 ml of 30% sodium diatriazoate (18Pinto W.J. Srinivasan B. Shepherd S. Schmidt A. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2565-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and centrifuged at 10 °C in a Sorvall RT6000B centrifuge for 4 min at 2,000 rpm. Most cells were at the interface, but a faint pellet of dense cells was present at the bottom of the tube. The liquid was aspirated, and the cell pellet was carefully resuspended in 0.5 ml of medium to avoid mixing with cells stuck to the side of the tube. Resuspended pellets from two tubes were mixed and recentrifuged on 30% sodium diatriazoate. The cell pellet was resuspended in medium, and about 500 cells were spread on PYED plates containing 25 μm PHS. Two days later only about 15 colonies/plate were visible, suggesting that only 3% of the dense cells were viable. Sphingolipid synthesis was measured by growing cells to saturation at 30 °C in PYED, diluting to anA 600 of 0.1 with fresh PYED medium containing 10 μg/ml of inositol and 10 μCi/mlmyo-[2-3H]inositol (20 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN), and grown at 30 °C overnight to an A 600 of 1. Cells were washed with 25 ml of 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 5.5, by centrifugation and resuspended in the same buffer at 50A 600 units/ml. A reaction containing 0.4 ml of 0.5% tergitol, 0.4 ml of 0.5 m sodium succinate, pH 5.5, 0.1 ml of 40% glucose, and 10 μl of 2.5 mm PHS in 95% ethanol was initiated by addition of 0.2 ml of the radiolabeled cells. At time 0 a 0.2-ml sample and at the indicated times a 0.5-ml sample of radiolabeled cells were treated with trichloroacetic acid at a final concentration of 5% for 20 min at 0 °C. Cells were centrifuged, washed three times with 1 ml of 5% tricholoracetic acid and finally with water. Cell pellets were extracted with 1 ml of 95% ethanol, water, diethyl ether, pyridine, concentrated NH4OH (15:15:5:1:0.018, v/v) for 60 min at 60 °C (19Hanson B.A. Lester R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 309-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After centrifuging while warm, a 0.5-ml sample of the supernatant fluid was evaporated under a stream of N2, dissolved in 1 ml of monomethylamine reagent, and heated for 60 min at 52 °C to deacylate the acylester phospholipids (20Clarke N.G. Dawson R.M.C. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The sample was dried and dissolved in 0.5 ml of chloroform:methanol:water (16:16:5). Qualitative analysis of 25-μl samples was carried out by silica gel thin layer chromatography on 20-cm Whatman LK5 plates developed with chloroform, methanol, 4.2n NH4OH (9:7:2). Radioactivity was measured by using a BioScan apparatus. Alternatively, quantification of radioactive products was achieved by ascending chromatography of 5-μl samples on Whatman SG-81 paper washed with EDTA (21Steiner M.R. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 222-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and developed with chloroform, methanol, 4.2 n NH4OH (9:7:2). The lanes were cut into 1-cm zones and counted in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. Cells were pregrown in nonradioactive minimal medium lacking leucine as described in protocol 1, resuspended at anA 600 of 0.5/ml in fresh medium containing 10 μg/ml inositol and 20 μCi/mlmyo-[2-3H]inositol, and aerated at 30 °C for the indicated times. Sphingolipids were processed and quantified after chromatography on Whatman SG-81 paper as described in protocol 1. Cells were grown to anA 600 of 0.8 in PYED medium at 30 °C, 2.5A 600 units of cells were centrifuged in a 50-ml plastic centrifuge tube, resuspended in 4 ml of medium containing 1% peptone (Difco), 1% yeast extract (Difco), 0.05% tergitol, 0.01 mg/ml inositol, 0.1% KH2PO4, 2% glucose, 50 mm sodium succinate, pH 5.5, 0.91 μm[3H]sphinganine, 0.65 μm[3H]sphinganine, or 0.59 μm[3H]sphinganine plus 40 μmdl-sphinganine (see text for the concentration used), and shaken at 30 °C. The resuspension medium was prepared by drying the sphinganine in the plastic tube under a stream of N2, adding the other ingredients, and sonicating in a water bath for 2 min to disperse the sphinganine uniformly. At 2 and 4 h, 0.25 ml of 100% trichloroacetic acid was added per tube to stop the reaction. The samples were transferred to small glass tubes containing 50A 600 units of nonradioactive carrier cells, centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min, and washed once with 3 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid and three times with 3 ml of water. Lipids were extracted with ethanol:water:diethyl ether:pyridine:concentrated NH4OH, processed, and dissolved in 0.5 ml of chloroform:methanol:water as described in protocol 1. Samples were chromatographed on a 0.5-ml bed of AG-X4 (acetate form, Bio-Rad) packed in a Pasteur pipette. The column was packed in water, equilibrated in methanol, and eluted with 3 ml of chloroform:methanol:water (16:16:5) followed by dilution of sphingolipids with 4 ml of the same solvent containing 0.4n NH4OH. The latter eluate was dried and dissolved in 0.5 ml of chloroform:methanol:water (16:16:5), and 10-μl portions were chromatographed on SG-81 paper and analyzed as described for protocol 1. Cells were grown overnight in minimal medium at 30 °C and diluted with fresh medium so that following addition of an inhibitory compound the final concentration was 1–2 × 10−4/ml, and the culture volume was 200 μl/microtiter well. Inhibitory compounds were tested in 2-fold dilution series in covered microtiter plates incubated without shaking at 30 °C for 40 h. The minimum inhibitory concentration is the lowest concentration of inhibitor yielding no visible cell pellet. Cells were grown to an A 600 of 0.6–0.8 at 30 °C in minimal medium, centrifuged, resuspended in medium lacking tergitol at an A 600 of 5 units/ml, and diluted into 7.2 ml of minimal medium containing 0.056% tergitol and 11.11 μm [3H]sphinganine (4,000 cpm/nmol) in a 50-ml plastic tube that was incubated with shaking at 30 °C. At various times duplicate 0.5-ml samples were diluted into 5 ml of ice-cold dilution buffer (0.02 m cyclodextrin (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), 0.05% tergitol, 10 μm sphinganine), filtered (0.4-μm pore size, Nucleopore Corp., Pleasanton, CA) to separate cells from the free radioisotope, and washed on the filter with 3 × 5 ml of ice-cold dilution buffer. Radioactivity on the filter was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Strain AG84-3 was isolated by using the procedure described under “Experimental Procedures” to enrich for strains defective in sphingolipid synthesis. Briefly, when SLC strains like 7R6 are fed PHS they make sphingolipids and have a normal buoyant density. If, however, a mutation has blocked sphingolipid synthesis the density of the cell should increase because sphingolipids will not be made in the presence of PHS. Using this strategy, SLC cells having a higher density following growth in the presence of PHS were enriched, and putative mutants were screened to differentiate those specifically defective in sphingolipid synthesis from those defective in other lipid biosynthetic pathways which might also affect cell density. The screen was based upon the observation that strain 7R6 cannot grow at low pH when it lacks sphingolipids (no PHS present in the medium) but can grow when allowed to make sphingolipids (PHS present in the medium) (22Patton J.L. Srinivasan B. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7180-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, about 100 mutants unable to grow on PYED plates at pH 4.1 either in the presence or absence of 25 μm PHS were identified. Mutants specifically defective in sphingolipid synthesis rather than glycerophospholipid synthesis were identified by looking for decreased incorporation of [3H]inositol into inositol-containing sphingolipids relative to phosphatidylinositol (PI) (23Zweerink M.M. Edison A.M. Wells G.B. Pinto W. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25032-25038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By this assay strain AG84 appeared to be specifically defective in sphingolipid synthesis. It became necessary during the course of our experiments to transform AG84 with plasmid DNA. However, the strain transformed poorly, less than 10 transformants/μg of plasmid DNA. To obtain a derivative of AG84 with enhanced transformability we selected derivatives that could grow on PYED plates at 37 °C. The rationale for this approach was to isolate a more stress-tolerant strain that would resist killing during the transformation procedure. Several 37 °C-resistant derivatives were tested for transformability, and one, AG84-3, was used for all studies presented here. Synthesis of inositol-containing sphingolipids in AG84-3 cells was measured using an in vivo radiolabeling procedure. Cells were cultured overnight, without PHS to prevent sphingolipid synthesis, but with [3H]inositol to label PI, a substrate for synthesis of IPC and M(IP)2C. Cells were separated from unincorporated radioisotope and incubated with or without PHS in a buffered solution containing glucose. The parental strain 7R6, but not the presumptive mutant strain AG84-3, should exhibit a PHS-dependent transfer of the radiolabel from PI to ceramide to yield [3H]IPC and to [3H]MIPC to yield [3H]M(IP)2C. Parental strain 7R6 behaved as expected because the amount of 3H-labeled sphingolipids synthesized was linearly dependent upon the concentration of PHS in the reaction (Fig. 2). In contrast, AG84-3 cells made no detectable sphingolipids during a 1-h (Fig. 2) or a 3-h (data not shown) incubation in the presence of 2.5 μmPHS. At 25 μm PHS, AG84-3 cells made sphingolipids, but at a lower level than 7R6 cells at both the 1-h (Fig. 2) and the 3-h time point (data not shown). Both strains showed deacylation products near the origin derived from deacylation of PI, indicating that synthesis of PI was normal (data not shown). From these data we conclude that AG84-3 cells have a defect in sphingolipid synthesis, specifically, they are less effective in transferring inositol-P from PI to ceramide to form IPC and to MIPC to form M(IP)2C (see Fig. 1). This behavior could be due to a defect in uptake of PHS from the culture medium, in synthesis of ceramide, or in transfer of inositol-P from PI to ceramide and MIPC. To differentiate between a defect in PHS uptake and a defect in the biosynthetic pathway, a wild type copy of LCB1, encoding a subunit of serine palmitoyltransferase (Fig. 1), was introduced into strain AG84-3 (deleted for lcb1) on a plasmid, and sphingolipid synthesis was measured. If AG84-3 is defective in the transport of PHS then the LCB1 gene should restore sphingolipid synthesis because the strain will be able to make endogenous PHS, whereas the gene will not restore sphingolipid synthesis if the strain is defective in a later step in the biosynthetic pathway. Cells were cultured with [3H]inositol but not with PHS, and the amount of radiolabeled sphingolipids was measured as a function of time. AG84-3 cells (lcb1) carrying the LCB1 gene on a plasmid were able to synthesize sphingolipids as well as the parental strain 7R6 (LCB1) (Fig. 3). We conclude from these data that strain AG84-3 has a defect either in the uptake of PHS from the culture medium or in the intracellular transport of PHS to the site of ceramide synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum. A gene enabling strain AG84-3 to grow under restrictive conditions, 37 °C in the presence of 25 μm PHS, was isolated from a genomic library and designated LCB3. The rate of PHS incorporation into sphingolipids was measured in AG84-3 cells transformed with a centromeric vector carrying the cloned LCB3 gene to determine if the gene restored the incorporation rate to normal. Two different isolates of AG84-3 transformed with the LCB3 gene behaved identically and showed a rate of sphingolipid synthesis similar to strain 7R6, the parent of AG84-3 (Fig. 2). We conclude from these data that the LCB3 gene complements the defect in sphingolipid synthesis in AG84-3 cells and restores the rate of PHS incorporation into sphingolipids to the wild type level seen in 7R6 cells. LCB3 is predicted to encode a protein of 409 amino acids which lacks similarity to any known protein. It does show 53% amino acid identity (Fig. 4) to another S. cerevisiae open reading frame, YKR053C, whose predicted amino acid sequence also shows no similarity to any known protein or sequence motif. By one method (24Eisenberg D. Schwarz E. Komaromy M. Wall R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 125-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar) there are eight predicted transmembrane helices in the Lcb3 protein, and four of these (indicated in Fig. 4) are also predicted to be membrane-associated by two other methods (25Rao M.J.K. Argos P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 869: 197-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 26Klein P. Kanehisa M. DeLisi C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 815: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Based on these predictions, the Lcb3 protein is most likely a membrane-bound protein having at least four and perhaps as many as eight transmembrane helices. Both the Lcb3 protein and the protein predicted to be encoded by open reading frame YKR053C have a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositiol cleavage/attachment site at their COOH terminus (Fig. 4). At this point we wanted to verify that mutation of the lcb3gene and not some other gene, whose defect could be compensated indirectly by the LCB3 gene, was responsible for the sphingolipid synthesis defect in strain AG84-3. Segregation of the putative lcb3 mutant gene by tetrad analysis was not possible because strain AG84-3 does not sporulate when mated to another strain mutated in lcb1 and carrying the SLC1-1suppressor gene (a strain like parental strain 7R6 but of the opposite mating type). Instead of tetrad analysis, two other approaches were used to verify that the reduced rate of PHS incorporation into sphingolipids is due to inactivation of the lcb3 gene in A"
https://openalex.org/W1993251454,"Retroviral integrases are composed of three independently folding domains whose organization relevant to one another is largely unknown. As an approach to understanding its structure, we have investigated the effect of the required metal cofactor(s), Mn<sup>2+</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup>, on the conformation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase (IN) using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that are specific for each of these three domains. Upon the addition of increasing concentrations of the divalent cations to immobilized HIV-1 IN in ELISA assays, binding of mAbs specific for either the C-terminal domain or for an epitope in the catalytic core domain was lost, whereas binding of an N terminus-specific mAb was unaffected. Size exclusion chromatography of a nonaggregating derivative of HIV-1 IN showed that the oligomeric state of the protein did not change under conditions in which recognition of the core and C terminus-specific mAbs was lost. Preincubation with Mn<sup>2+</sup> increased the resistance of HIV-1 IN to proteolytic digestion and produced a digestion pattern that was significantly different from that observed with the apoprotein. A derivative that lacked the N-terminal domain, IN(50–288), exhibited the same metal-dependent changes observed with the full-length protein, whereas the isolated catalytic core domain IN(50–212) did not. From this we conclude that the metal-induced conformational change comprises a reorganization of the core and C-terminal domains. Preincubation with Mn<sup>2+</sup> increased the specific activity of HIV-1 IN 5-fold. Enzymatic activity was inhibited by the conformation-sensitive C terminus-specific mAb, but this inhibition was reduced greatly if the enzyme was first preincubated with metal ions. Thus, it appears that apo-HIV-1 IN exists predominantly in an inactive conformation that is converted into a catalytically competent form upon the addition of metal ions."
https://openalex.org/W2022853312,"The effect of activated human K-ras on cell cycle proteins was studied by use of a stable MCF-7 transfectant expressing inducible activated K-ras under the control of a tetracycline (Tet)-responsive promoter. Induction of activated K-ras by Tet withdrawal accelerated cell growth and entry into S-phase. To understand the mechanism(s) by which activated K-ras exerts its effect on the cell cycle, expression of both cell cycle stimulatory proteins as well as cell cycle inhibitors was examined. Upon induction of activated K-ras, several cell cycle stimulators were up-regulated, including cyclins A, D3, and E, and the E2F family of transcription factors, which was accompanied by increased cyclin A-associated kinase activity and E2F transcriptional activity, respectively. Up-regulation of cyclin A occurred at the transcriptional level and in a serum-dependent manner. Furthermore, induction of activated K-ras down-regulated p27Kip1 and up-regulated p53. Up-regulation of p53 was correlated with enhanced p53 transactivation and accompanied by up-regulation of p21Waf1 and Gadd 45, two p53 effectors and negative cell cycle regulators. In addition, activated K-ras up-regulates bcl-2 but has no effect on bax or bcl-x expression. Taken together, these data indicate that activated K-ras affects the cell cycle by modulating both positive and negative cell cycle regulatory pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2161457179,"We have reconstituted fusion between phagosomes and lysosomes in streptolysin O-permeabilized J774-E macrophages. Fusion was assessed by measuring the delivery of avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase pre-internalized into lysosomes to phagosomes containing biotinylated β-glucuronidase-conjugated paramagnetic beads (1–2 μm). Fusion was dependent on energy and exogenously supplied cytosol. Phagosome-lysosome fusion was greatly inhibited when microtubules were depolymerized by nocodazole treatment, suggesting that fusion occurs via microtubule-dependent transport.

Phagocytosis is mediated by binding of organisms or large particles to plasma membrane receptors on phagocytes followed by internalization. After internalization (1Greenberg S. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 93-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), newly formed phagosomes containing microorganisms or particles mature into acidic and protease-rich phagolysosomes, where microorganisms or materials phagocytosed are killed and/or degraded. Maturation of phagosomes involves multiple membrane fusion and budding events and the apparent recruitment of multiple proteins from the cytosol (2Beron W. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Mayorga L. Stahl P.D.

Recently, in vitro reconstitution assays have been used to develop an understanding of the mechanisms that regulate fusion during vesicular transport.

Phagosome-endosome fusion is also sensitive to GTPγS, the non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue, suggesting a role for GTP binding proteins in the fusion process. Desjardins et al. have reported that Rab5 is present on early phagosomes isolated following phagocytosis of latex beads while Rab7 has been detected on late phagosomes (5Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Alvarez-Dominguez et al. (6Alvarez-Dominguez C. Barbieri A.M. Beron W. Wandinger-Ness A. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13834-13843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) have shown that Rab5 is required for phagosome-endosome fusion. Several heterotrimeric G proteins have also been found to localize to early phagosomes containing IgG-coated Staphylococcus aureus or latex beads (7Beron W. Colombo M.I. Mayorga L.S. Stahl P.D. Arch.

Using in vitro reconstitution assays, both Rab5 and Gαs, a subunit of trimeric G proteins, have been shown to regulate early phagosome-early endosome fusion (6Alvarez-Dominguez C. Barbieri A.M.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying membrane fusion in late steps of phagocytic pathway, viz. phagosome-lysosome fusion, are poorly studied. To dissect the molecular mechanisms involved in the process of phagosome-lysosome fusion, we developed an in vitroreconstitution assay using SL-O permeabilized J774-E macrophages. The assay is based on content mixing between phagosomes and lysosomes. Biotinylated-β-glucuronidase-conjugated particles and avidin-HRP or mannose-BSA colloidal gold were used as probes for phagosomes and lysosomes, respectively. Formation of avidin-HRP·biotin complexes on the phagosomal particles or localization of colloidal gold in compartments containing phagocytic particles results from fusion between phagosomes and lysosomes. The data indicate that fusion is dependent on energy and exogenously supplied cytosol and that fusion is inhibited by nocodazole, indicating a role for microtubules. In addition, our data indicate that Rab proteins and NSF are required for fusion between phagosomes and lysosomes. J774-E, a murine macrophage cell line, was grown in minimal essential medium containing Earle's salts and 10% fetal calf serum. β-Glucuronidase was isolated from rat preputial glands as described (9Diaz R. Mayorga L. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). His6-tagged Rab3A-GDI was purified on Ni2+-agarose according to the manufacturer instructions (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Purified SL-O was obtained from S. Bhakdi (University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany) (10Bhakdi S. Weller U. Walev I. Martin E. Jonas D. Palmer M. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1993; 182: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Anti-NSF, 4A6, a mouse IgM monoclonal antibody, was a generous gift from James E. Rothman (Sloan-Kettering Memorial Cancer Center, New York), and the recombinant NSF wild type was kindly provided by Sidney W. Whiteheart (University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated with avidin (avidin-HRP) and avidin were obtained from Pierce. All other chemicals were from Sigma. β-Glucuronidase was coupled to carboxylated paramagnetic polystyrene particles (particle diameter of 1–2 μm; Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA) using a water-soluble carbodiimide (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDAC)). Particles were washed with MES buffer (pH 6.0, 50 mm), and after incubating particles (1 ml; 2.5% solids) with β-glucuronidase (1 ml; 1 mg/ml) in MES buffer (pH 6.0, 50 mm) for 15 min at room temperature, EDAC (15 mg) was added very slowly. The pH was adjusted to 6.5 ± 0.2 with dilute NaOH, and the mixture was incubated for 15 h at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by incubation for 30 min at room temperature in MES buffer, pH 6.5, containing glycine (100 mm). Particles were washed three times with phosphate-buffed saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and resuspended in PBS. Subsequently, β-glucuronidase-conjugated magnetic particles were biotinylated with NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer recommendations. Particles (5% solids) were washed in 50 mm sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.5, resuspended in the same buffer, and incubated with NHS-LC-biotin (0.27 mg/ml; 30 min at room temperature). The particles were then washed three times with PBS supplemented with 1% BSA and stored in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 1% BSA, 0.1% NaN3, and 5% glycerol. 107particles bound approximately 25 ng of avidin-HRP. Prior to ligand uptake, J774-E cells (1 × 106/well) were cultured overnight, washed, and resuspended in cold HBSA (Hank's balanced solution buffered to pH 7.4 with 10 mm Hepes, 10 mm TES, and BSA (10 mg/ml).) Avidin-HRP (125 μg/ml) was internalized for 30 min at 37 °C following prebinding for 60 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed twice with cold HBSA. Internalized avidin-HRP was chased for 70 min at 37 °C for transport to lysosomes (11Diaz R. Colombo M.I. Koval M. Mayorga L. Stahl P.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 56: 223-232PubMed Google Scholar). Mannan (1 mg/ml) was added to avoid possible reinternalization of avidin-HRP recycled to the extracellular media. After washing, the cells were allowed to bind biotinylated-β-glucuronidase-conjugated particles (20 particles/cell, at 4 °C for 60–90 min). After phagocytosis (5 min; 37 °C), cells were cooled and washed with cold HBSA (2 ×) and cold SL-O binding buffer (115 mm KOAc, 25 mm Hepes, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.9 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4). Activated SL-O (1.27 μg/ml) was added for 30 min at 4 °C. SL-O (1 mg/ml in Hepes (25 mm); pH 7.2, BSA (1 mg/ml), and dithiothreitol (2 mm)) was activated for 30 min at 37 °C and diluted with binding buffer. After SL-O binding, cells were washed twice with binding buffer and permeabilization was carried out for 5 min at 37 °C in fusion buffer (115 mm KOAc, 25 mm Hepes, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol containing an ATP-depleting system (2.5 mm glucose and 12.5 units/ml hexokinase), and avidin (100 μg/ml) to minimize fusion during SL-O treatment and to scavenge biotinylated particles on the cell surface, respectively. SL-O (1.27 μg/ml) was sufficient to permeabilize 70–80% of J774-E cells, as assessed by the release of lactate dehydrogenase (M r 135,000), a cytosolic marker. Under these conditions, release of HRP loaded in early endosomal or lysosomal compartments and β-hexosaminidase (an endogenous lysosomal marker) was < 5% of cell content. After permeabilization, cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C to deplete cytosol, gently washed twice with fusion buffer and incubated in 200 μl of fusion buffer or gel-filtered cytosol (4 mg/ml) supplemented with an ATP-regenerating system (4Mayorga L.S. Bertini F. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6511-6517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Alvarez-Dominguez C. Barbieri A.M. Beron W. Wandinger-Ness A. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13834-13843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). After 30 min at 4 °C, cells were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C to allow fusion to occur. The preparations were cooled to 4 °C and lysed in solubilization buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.2% methylbenzethonium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% BSA, 0.15m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) in the presence of avidin (200 μg/ml) as scavenger. Avidin-HRP·biotinylated-particle complexes were washed 4 times with solubilization buffer by using a magnet, and the HRP enzymatic activity associated with the particles was measured at 490 nm using 0.75 mg/mlO-phenylenediamine and 0.006% H2O2as substrates in sodium acetate (50 mm), pH 5.0. Values are expressed as percentage of control cytosol-dependent fusion. Total HRP activity recoverable on biotin-β glucuronidase magnetic beads was determined by lysing cells in the absence of scavenger. In fusion assays following lysis in the presence of scavenger (200 μg/ml avidin), 30–50% of the total precipitable HRP activity was routinely recovered on magnetic beads. Colloidal gold particles (20 nm of diameter) were coated with mannose-BSA (4Mayorga L.S. Bertini F. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6511-6517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To follow fusion in permeabilized cells, ligand-coated gold particles (20 nm) and biotinylated β-glucuronidase-conjugated particles (1–2 μm) were used as lysosome and phagosome markers, respectively. Experimental procedures were exactly as described for the biochemical fusion assay. After incubation, the cells were washed twice with HB-EGTA buffer (250 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EGTA, 20 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.0), scraped off with a rubber policeman, fixed, and processed for electron microscopy (4Mayorga L.S. Bertini F. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6511-6517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitation was carried out by counting gold distribution in 20 permeabilized cells for each set of experimental conditions. Cytosol from J774-E macrophages was prepared as described previously (9Diaz R. Mayorga L. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stored at −80 °C. Cytosol preparations included a protease inhibitor mixture, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. NSF-depleted cytosol was prepared as described previously (12Goda Y. Pfeffer S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cytosol and NSF-depleting cytosol were gel filtered through Sephadex G-25 spin columns equilibrated in fusion buffer immediately before use, and protein concentrations were measured using the Bio-Rad protein reagent and BSA as a standard. Cytosol depleted permeabilized cells were incubated in fusion buffer for 30 min at 25 °C in the presence or absence of Rab-GDI (10 μm) and GDP (100 μm). The cells were washed twice with fusion buffer and then incubated for 45 min at 37 °C in fusion buffer supplemented with gel-filtered cytosol and an ATP-regenerating system in the presence or absence of Rab-GDI (10 μm). To follow removal of Rab proteins by Rab-GDI, treated cells were washed once with fusion buffer, lysed in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and the membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C using standard procedures. Rab5 was detected using 4F11, an anti-Rab5 mouse IgG2a monoclonal antibody (6Alvarez-Dominguez C. Barbieri A.M. Beron W. Wandinger-Ness A. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13834-13843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and developed with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG by the ECL detection system (Amersham Corp). Fig. 1 A shows fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes. Both exogenous cytosol and an ATP regenerating system are required to obtain maximal fusion activity. Cytosol-dependent fusion was proportional to the concentration of cytosol. Background activity, fusion in the absence of added cytosol, was approximately 30% of fusion in the presence of cytosol (4 mg/ml) and was subtracted from the data shown in Fig.1 A. When an ATP depleting system was added in the presence of exogenous cytosol, about 50% inhibition of fusion activity was observed (Fig. 1, A and B). Alternatively, substituting ATPγS, a nonhydrolyzable analogue of ATP, for ATP completely prevented cytosol-dependent fusion (Fig.1 B), indicating that ATP hydrolysis is required for fusion. It is possible that the depletion of ATP was incomplete and/or that during the depletion process, some fusion events that were already underway were allowed to go to completion. In addition, nocodazole inhibited cytosol-dependent fusion. In some experiments, nocodazole had an additional inhibitory effect on cytosol-independent fusion, expressed as negative values in Fig. 1 B. Monomeric and heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins play key roles in regulating many intracellular transport processes (13Pfeffer S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 14Helms J.B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Addition of GTPγS (50 μm) to permeabilized cells inhibited cytosol-dependent fusion by about 50% (Fig.1 C). Maximal inhibition occurred at GTPγS (1 mm) (Fig. 1 C). These results suggest that GTP hydrolysis regulates fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes. We also examined the reconstitution of phagosome-lysosome fusion in the permeabilized cells by electron microscopy. As shown in Fig.2, the permeabilization of cells by SL-O allowed us to better visualize the membrane structures of intracellular organelles. Both phagosomes and lysosomal compartments containing 20-nm colloidal gold particles remained intact. We first determined whether fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes in permeabilized cells required cytosol. In the absence of exogenous cytosol, fusion was low (Fig. 2 A). Quantitation of gold distribution in 20 permeabilized cells indicated that 16% of phagosomes were gold-positive. Incubation of the permeabilized cells with cytosol (4 mg/ml) and an ATP regenerating system resulted in the colocalization of 20 nm of gold with phagocytic particles in larger vesicles (Fig. 2 B). Approximately 64% of phagosomes were gold-positive when the experiment was carried out under complete conditions. When permeabilized cells were treated with GTPγS (1 mm) in the presence of cytosol (4 mg/ml) and an ATP regenerating system, 19% of the 20-nm colloidal gold particles were colocalized in the compartments containing phagocytic particles (Fig. 2 C). These results are consistent with those obtained with the biochemical fusion assay (Fig. 1 A-C) and indicates that GTPγS inhibits fusion.Figure 2Morphological characterization of of phagosome-lysosome fusion in SL-O permeabilized cells. For morphological experiments, mannose-BSA-coated colloidal gold (20 nm) was used instead of avidin-HRP as in Fig. 1. The pulse-chase experiment was exactly as described in Fig. 1.

Cell. 1995; 81: 571-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), we tested the effect of Rab-GDI in the in vitro phagosome-lysosome fusion assay. Permeabilized cells were incubated with 10 μm Rab-GDI in the presence of GDP (100 μm) for 30 min at 25 °C. At this temperature, very little fusion was observed (data not shown). After treatment, cells were washed to remove Rab·Rab-GDI complexes and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C in the presence of Rab-GDI (10 μm) to allow fusion to occur. As shown in Fig.3 A, cytosol-dependent fusion was inhibited by about 60%. When different amounts of Rab-GDI were added to the assay, we found that as little as 5 μm Rab-GDI was effective (∼10%) in blocking cytosol-dependent fusion (data not shown). Pretreatment with GDP alone did not inhibit cytosol-dependent fusion (Fig. 3 A). Under the same conditions, we also measured the removal of Rab proteins from the permeabilized cells by Rab-GDI using Rab5 as an indicator. As shown in Fig. 3 B, Rab5 was substantially released from membranes by Rab-GDI treatment in the presence of GDP but not in the absence of GDP. To examine the functional involvement of NSF (N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)-sensitive cytosolic factor) in phagosome-lysosome fusion, we tested the effect of a monoclonal IgM antibody (4A6) that recognizes native NSF. When permeabilized cells were pre-treated with anti-NSF IgM antibody (100 μg/ml) in the presence of cytosol and ATP, cytosol-dependent fusion was almost completely inhibited (Fig. 4). The inhibition by anti-NSF IgM antibody was dose-dependent. Fusion was inhibited by about 40% by addition of 10 μg/ml anti-NSF IgM (data not shown). Addition of recombinant NSF wild type restored 50% of total fusogenic activity in anti-NSF IgM antibody-treated permeabilized cells. We have also observed that NSF-depleted cytosol did not substantially support fusion activity (39.2 ± 4.3% of total fusion activity), whereas control IgM-treated cytosol supported 80.7 ± 7.7% of total fusion activity. These results indicate that NSF is required for phagosome-lysosome fusion, as in other homotypic and/or heterotypic fusion processes (16Diaz R. Mayorga L.S. Weidman P.J. Rothman J.E. Stahl P.D.

Fusion between phagosomes and lysosomes is of interest particularly with regard to the mechanism by which pathogenic microorganisms survive inside phagosomes by interfering with membrane fusion (19Garcia-del Portillo F. Finlay P.B. Trends Microbiol. 1995; 3: 373-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Generally, newly formed phagosomes fuse with endocytic organelles and lysosomes in vivo. In previous studies, we have shown that fusion of early phagosomes with early endosomes can be reconstituted in vitro using a cell-free system (2Beron W. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Mayorga L. Stahl P.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 100-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 4Mayorga L.S. Bertini F. Stahl P.D. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) has been studied in vitro; however, neither the fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes nor its regulation has been investigated by in vitroreconstitution. Here we developed an in vitro reconstitution assay for phagosome-lysosome fusion using SL-O-permeabilized J774-E macrophages. The assay is based on the high affinity binding of avidin-HRP, previously loaded into lysosomes, to the surface of internalized particles bearing biotinylated-β-glucuronidase, a mannosylated glycoprotein internalized via the macrophage mannose receptor. We cannot completely rule out possible fusion of phagosomes with late endosomes; however, previous studies have shown that a 30-min pulse and a 70-min chase prior to permeabilization is more than sufficient to place the bulk of our probe in the dense lysosomal compartment (11Diaz R. Colombo M.I. Koval M. Mayorga L. Stahl P.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 56: 223-232PubMed Google Scholar). Morphological studies with colloidal gold confirmed the biochemical observations reported. A recent paper by Tjelleet al. showed that colloidal gold is transported to a lysosomal compartment in J774 macrophages (21Tjelle T.E. Brech A. Juvet L.K. Griffiths G. Berg T. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2905-2914PubMed Google Scholar). Their published images of gold-laden lysosomes are quite similar to ours. Our results show that phagosome-lysosome fusion is dependent on energy and exogenously supplied cytosol, in agreement with requirements observed for other membrane fusion events (4Mayorga L.S. Bertini F. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6511-6517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Diaz R. Mayorga L. Stahl P.D. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1373-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Desjardinset al. and Blocker et al. have shown that transfer of lamp 2 or HRP (preloaded into lysosomal compartments) into phagosomes containing latex beads is inhibited when microtubules are depolymerized by nocodazole (5Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 23Blocker A. Severin F.F. Habermann A. Hyman A.A. Griffiths G. Burkhardt J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3803-3811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Our data show that nocodazole inhibits phagosome-lysosome fusion in vitro. In fact, nocodazole was a more potent inhibitor than ATPγS in our assay. This may be due, in part, to an effect of the drug on phagosome-lysosome fusion in the remaining intact cells. Since intracellular movement of some organelles occurs along microtubules (24Rickard J.E. Kreis T.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 178-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), these results suggest that phagosomes also move along microtubules and that this movement is required for subsequent fusion with lysosomes. When permeabilized cells were pre-incubated with GTPγS, phagosome-lysosome fusion was substantially inhibited, suggesting that one or more GTPases are involved in the process. Moreover, our data show that Rab-GDI inhibits fusion between phagosomes and lysosomes. Since Rab-GDI is known to inhibit several vesicular transport pathways by removal of Rab proteins from intracellular membranes (13Pfeffer S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 15Ikonen E. Tagaya M. Ullrich O. Montecucco C. Simons K. Cell. 1995; 81: 571-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), this finding suggests the involvement of at least one Rab GTPase in phagosome-lysosome fusion. It is well known that Rab5 is localized on early endosomes and functions in fusion among early endosomes (25Gorvel J.-P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J. Cell. 1991; 64: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 26Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M.

Cell. 1990; 62: 317-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar) and regulates transport steps between early endosomes and late endosomes/lysosomes (30Feng Y. Press B.

Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1227-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and in yeast, between late endosomes and vacuoles (equivalent to lysosomes in mammalian cells) (32Schimmoller F. Riezman H. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 823-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or possibly fusion between vacuoles (17Mayer A. Wickner W. Haas A. Cell. 1996; 85: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Similarly, in the phagocytic pathway, Rab5 is present on early phagosomes and Rab7 is present on late phagosomes (5Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). In addition, it was recently demonstrated that Rab5 regulates early phagosome-early endosome fusion in an in vitro reconstituted cell-free system (6Alvarez-Dominguez C. Barbieri A.M. Beron W. Wandinger-Ness A. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13834-13843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). All these observations indicate similar functional roles for each of the Rab proteins in both the phagocytic and endocytic pathway. However, further study is needed to clarify which Rab proteins are in fact involved in the fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes. NSF, an ATPase required for transport events at multiple stages of the secretory pathway (33Beckers C.J.M. Block M.R. Glick B.S. Rothman J.E. Balch W.E. Nature. 1989; 339: 397-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 34Whiteheart S.W. Kubalek E.W. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 64-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), is also required for transport along the endocytic and phagocytic pathways. For example, fusion among early endosomes (9Diaz R. Mayorga L. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Diaz R. Mayorga L.S. Weidman P.J.

Cell. 1994; 5: 773-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), between late endosomes and lysosomes (20Mullock B.M. Perez J.H. Kuwana T. Gray S.R. Luzio J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and between early phagosomes and early endosomes (4Mayorga L.S. Bertini F. Stahl P.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13834-13843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) is inhibited by NEM or by antibodies against NSF, suggesting that these processes are regulated by NSF. In addition, recent studies using NSF mutants revealed that two distinct mutations in the first ATP-binding domain that affect either ATP binding or hydrolysis inhibit intra-Golgi transport (37Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) and fusion among early endosomes (18Colombo M.I. Taddese M. Whiteheart S.W. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18810-18816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the present study, we provide evidence that hydrolysis of ATP is required for phagosome-lysosome fusion, suggesting the requirement for an ATPase. We also found that both NEM (data not shown) and antibodies against NSF inhibit fusion and that addition of recombinant NSF wt partially restores the fusogenic activity in the presence of antibodies. These results indicate that NSF is in fact required for phagosome-lysosome fusion. Since several lines of evidence suggest that NSF functions as a general component of membrane docking/fusion machinery together with SNAPs and SNAREs (38Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 39Mellman I. Cell. 1995; 82: 869-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), it is possible that NSF·SNAP·SNARE complexes are involved in phagosome-lysosome fusion. In this regard, it has been shown that the SNARE proteins, syntaxin 2, 3, and 4, are present on the phagosomal membranes (35Hackam D.J. Rotstein O.D. Bennett M.K. Klip A. Grinstein S. Manolson M.F. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4377-4383PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies, perhaps using in vitro fusion assays, may delineate the role played by the NSF·SNAP·SNARE machinery in phagosome-lysosome fusion. In conclusion, we have developed a biochemical assay to reconstitute fusion between phagosomes and lysosomes in SL-O-permeabilized cells. Using this system, we found that fusion is dependent on energy and exogenously supplied cytosol and is inhibited by nocodazole, suggesting that fusion occurs via microtubule-dependent transport. In addition, rab proteins and NSF are required for fusion between phagosomes and lysosomes. The results indicate that phagosome-lysosome fusion requires components similar to that of other intracellular vesicular transport.

The mRNA levels for eight genes were investigated to determine the effect of vibrational force on mRNA expression. The mRNA levels of two growth-related protooncogenes, c-fos and c-myc, were up-regulated significantly within 30 min after vibration, whereas those of osteocalcin as well as transforming growth factor-β1 were decreased significantly within 3h after vibration. No changes were detected in the levels of β-actin, histone H4, or cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 after vibration. No basal levels of cyclooxygenase-2 expression were detected. In addition, the extracellular concentrations of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a potent autocrine/paracrine growth factor in bone, were not significantly altered after vibration most likely due to the serum deprivation state of the osteoblasts. In comparison with the gravitational launch profile, vibrational-induced changes in gene expression were greater both in magnitude and number of genes activated. Taken together, these data suggest that the changes in mRNA expression are due to a direct mechanical effect of the vibrational force on the osteoblast cells and not to changes in the local PGE2 concentrations. The finding that launch forces induce gene expression is of utmost importance since many of the biological experiments do not dampen vibrational loads on experimental samples. This lack of dampening of vibrational forces may partially explain why 1-G onboard controls sometimes do not reflect 1-G ground controls. These data may also suggest that scientists use extra ground controls that are exposed to launch forces, have these forces dampened on launched samples, or use facilities such as Biorack that provide an onboard 1-G centrufuge in order to control for space shuttle launch forces.—Tjandrawinata, R.

CRKL is most similar to CRK II in that both contain two SH3 domains, whereas CRK I contains only one SH3 domain as a result of alternative splicing (18Matsuda M. Tanaka S. Nagata S. Kojima A. Kurata T. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3482-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that the N-terminal SH3 domain of CRKL binds directly to a proline-rich region in the C terminus of BCR-ABL, and this direct binding can be disrupted by deletion of this region (19Heaney C. Kolibaba K. Bhat A. Oda T. Ohno S. Fanning S. Druker B.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 297-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this deletion mutant of BCR-ABL remains transformation competent, and CRKL is tyrosine-phosphorylated and binds to BCR-ABL through indirect interactions in cells expressing this deletion mutant (19Heaney C. Kolibaba K. Bhat A. Oda T. Ohno S. Fanning S. Druker B.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 297-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the candidates for mediating indirect binding of CRKL and BCR-ABL is c-CBL. c-CBL is the cellular homolog of v-CBL, the transforming protein of the Cas NS-1 retrovirus that induces pre-B cell lymphomas and myeloid leukemias in mice (20Langdon W.Y.

The effects of deletion of this domain on complex formation between c-CBL, BCR-ABL, and CRKL are reported. The 32Dcl3 cell line (30Greenberger J.S. Sakakeeny M.A. Humphries R.K. Eaves C.J.

Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (UBI) and 15% WEHI-3B conditioned media as a source of interleukin-3. Sublines of 32Dc13 expressing p210BCR-ABL, the SH2 domain deletion of ABL (ΔSH2), a tyrosine kinase inactive mutant of BCR-ABL, and a deletion of a proline-rich region in the C terminus of ABL that mediates direct binding of CRKL to ABL (ΔP1,P2) were generated as described previously (16Oda T.

K562 cells are a BCR-ABL-positive leukemic cell line (32Lozzio C.B. Lozzio B.B. Blood. 1975; 45: 321-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that was cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Full-length p210BCR-ABL and the kinase domain of ABL were cloned into a modified version of the pBluBac vector (InVitrogen). This vector, pBluBac3C (gift of R. Maurer, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR) contains a 12CA5 antibody binding site, a hexa-histidine sequence for Ni-Sepharose purification, a factor X cleavage site, and a BamHI cloning site. Full-lengthBCR-ABL was modified to remove untranslated 5′ sequences and was cloned in-frame into the BamHI site of pBluBac3C. The kinase domain of ABL was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using a BCR-ABL plasmid as the template. The 5′ primer was 5′ CAGCGGATCCAAAGCGCAACAAGCCC 3′, and the 3′ primer was 5′ TACTAGGATCC TTATCAGGATTCCTGGAACATTGT 3′. TheBamHI restriction site is underlined, and the stop codons are in italics. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested withBamHI, ligated into pBluBac3C, and sequenced to confirm that no errors were generated from the polymerase chain reaction amplification. The full-length BCR-ABL and the ABL kinase domain were transfected into Sf9 cells as described (InVitrogen). Propagation, identification, and isolation of plaques, generation of high titer stocks, and infection of Sf9 cells for expression were performed as described (33Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.M. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar). Both the full-length BCR-ABL and the kinase domain were shown to be of correct predicted size and functional by an immune complex kinase assay. For large scale production of BCR-ABL and the ABL kinase domain, Sf9 cells were grown in Grace's insect media (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 0.33% yeastolate, 0.33% lactalbumin hydrolysate, and 50 mg/ml gentamicin, at 27 °C in spinner flasks to a density of 1–2 × 106 cells/ml. The cells were infected with plaque-purified virus at a multiplicity of infection of 2 and harvested 72 h post-infection in the case of BCR-ABL and 48 h post-infection in the case of kinase domain-infected cells. Rabbit polyclonal antisera against CRKL were generated against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 204–225 of CRKL. This antiserum was used exclusively for immunoblotting experiments. For other experiments, anti-CRKL antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies recognizing p120 CBL, ABL proteins (24–11 and K-12), and anti-GST were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-hemagglutinin antibody 12CA5 was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. The anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody, 4G10, was generated using KLH-phosphotyramine as the immunogen and was used as described (34Druker B.J. Mamon H.J. Roberts T.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 321: 1383-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 35Kanakura Y. Druker B. Cannistra S.A. Furukawa Y. Torimoto Y. Griffin J.D. Blood. 1990; 76: 706-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) containing 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The 32D lysates were normalized in preliminary experiments by immunoblotting for c-ABL, and these amounts were used for subsequent experiments. Normalized lysates were either immunoprecipitated with 25 μl of CRKL or ABL antisera followed by SDS-PAGE or were analyzed as whole cell lysates by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF, Immobilon-P, Millipore) membranes in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 192.5 mm glycine, 20% MeOH for 4 h at 0.45 A. Residual binding sites were blocked by incubation in TBS (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 60 min at 25 °C. The blots were incubated for 4–16 h at room temperature with primary antibody. Antibody reactions were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Sf9 lysates expressing ABL kinase or full-length BCR-ABL were bound to 12CA5 antibody at 4 °C for 6–8 h with Protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and then incubated with 32D, 32Dp210, or K562 lysates for 4 h. The beads were then washed three more times with PBS before being boiled in SDS-sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The GST-CRKL constructs were previously described (19Heaney C. Kolibaba K. Bhat A. Oda T. Ohno S. Fanning S. Druker B.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 297-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GST-ABL SH2, GST-ABL SH3, and GST-ABLSH2, SH3 were gifts from W. Haser (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston). GST-fusion constructs were expressed in isopropylthio-β-d-galactosidase-induced Escherichia coli (DH-5α). The GST-fusion proteins were isolated from sonicated bacterial lysates using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia). Coomassie-stained gels of the GST-fusion proteins were used to normalize for the expression of the various GST-fusion proteins. Between 2.5 and 5 μg of GST-fusion proteins were incubated with 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads in bacterial lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 16 mmNa2HPO4, 4 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.3) containing 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. The beads were washed four times in ice-cold PBS and incubated for 4 h with normalized cell lysates. The beads were washed three times with PBS and boiled in SDS-sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes for immunoblot analysis. Purified GST, GST-ABL SH2, and GST-ABL SH3 fusion proteins were used for this assay. PVDF membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% non-fat dry milk. The blots were washed twice in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with either GST only or GST-ABL SH2 or SH3 fusion proteins (at 2 mg/ml) in binding buffer (25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.20, 150 mmNaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 2.5 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, 1% non-fat milk, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 mg/ml aprotinin). Bound GST protein was detected by incubation with anti-GST antibody diluted 1:500 in binding buffer excluding milk, dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. Antibody reactions were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence. The blots were washed for 1 h in PBS-T between each of the steps. Previous studies have demonstrated that p120 c-CBL is tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells expressing activated ABL oncoproteins, including BCR-ABL. Furthermore, BCR-ABL and c-CBL form a complex as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation (26de Jong R. ten Hoeve J. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. J. Biol.

These results were confirmed in 32D cells expressing p210BCR-ABL and in K562 cells, a BCR-ABL-positive cell line derived from a chronic myelogenous leukemia patient (32Lozzio C.B. Lozzio B.B. Blood. 1975; 45: 321-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1shows that c-CBL is tyrosine-phosphorylated in BCR-ABL expressing cells but not in control, interleukin-3-dependent 32D cells. A number of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins co-immunoprecipitate with c-CBL in BCR-ABL-expressing cells, including proteins of relative molecular mass of 210, 170, 135–140, 68–70, and 56 kDa (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, BCR-ABL is present in c-CBL immunoprecipitates, and c-CBL is present in ABL immunoprecipitates. The tyrosine phosphorylation of c-CBL and association with BCR-ABL is dependent on ABL kinase activity as it is not seen in cells expressing a tyrosine kinase inactive mutant of BCR-ABL (Fig. 3).Figure 3Direct binding of the ABL SH2 domain to tyrosine-phosphorylated CBL. CBL immunoprecipitates (I.P.) from lysates of the indicated cells were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were incubated with bacterially expressed ABL SH2 domain, and binding was detected with a GST antibody (A). No binding was detected using GST alone or the ABL SH3 domain (data not shown). The immunoblot was stripped and reprobed with CBL antisera (B) or anti-phosphotyrosine (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The data presented above demonstrated that c-CBL and BCR-ABL co-immunoprecipitate, and this association requires tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL. To assist in localization of a possible binding sequence of BCR-ABL to CBL, full-length BCR-ABL and the kinase domain of ABL were expressed in the baculovirus system, tagged with an N-terminal hemagglutinin (12CA5) epitope. 12CA5 immunoprecipitates from lysates of SF9 cells infected with these constructs were incubated with lysates from K562 cells and analyzed for c-CBL binding. As shown in Fig. 2 A, full-length BCR-ABL but not the kinase domain was capable of binding to c-CBL. No binding of c-CBL to the full-length BCR-ABL was seen using lysates from 32D cells, again suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of c-CBL is required for binding to BCR-ABL and that the binding of c-CBL to BCR-ABL requires a domain outside of the kinase domain of ABL. A possibility raised by the data presented above is that c-CBL may be binding to the SH2 domain of ABL in a phosphotyrosine-dependent fashion. To test this, bacterially expressed GST-fusion proteins containing the ABL SH2 or SH3 domains were evaluated for their ability to bind c-CBL from cellular lysates. As seen in Fig. 2, Band C, the ABL SH2 but not ABL SH3 domain was capable of binding CBL from BCR-ABL lysates but not from 32D cells. Although these experiments suggested that the SH2 domain of ABL was binding tyrosine-phosphorylated CBL, these experiments could not determine whether the interaction was direct or indirect. To assess whether the SH2 domain of ABL could bind directly to CBL, a gel overlay assay was performed. c-CBL immunoprecipitates from 32D and BCR-ABL-expressing cells were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes. The membranes were incubated with GST-ABL SH2 or SH3 domains, and binding was detected with a GST antiserum. The data presented in Fig. 3 show that equal amounts of c-CBL were immunoprecipitated from all cells examined and that the ABL SH2 domain binds directly to c-CBL. This binding of c-CBL to the ABL SH2 domain is only seen under conditions where c-CBL is tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 3). We and others (16Oda T. Tamura S. Matsuguchi T. Griffin J.D. Druker B.J. Leukemia ( Baltimore ). 1995; 9: 295-301PubMed Google Scholar, 36Ilaria R.L.J. Van Etten R.A. Blood. 1995; 86: 3897-3904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37McWhirter J.R. Galasso D.L. Wang J.Y.J. Mol.

This mutant remains capable of rendering myeloid cells factor-independent for growth but is defective in fibroblast transformation assays. Myeloid cells expressing this mutant were examined for defects in c-CBL tyrosine phosphorylation or BCR-ABL association. As shown in Fig. 1, c-CBL is tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells expressing the SH2 domain mutant of BCR-ABL and also co-immunoprecipitates with BCR-ABL. The data for the SH2 domain deletion of BCR-ABL and its interaction with c-CBL are reminiscent of data that we had obtained for CRKL and ABL interactions (19Heaney C. Kolibaba K. Bhat A. Oda T. Ohno S. Fanning S. Druker B.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 297-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We previously mapped a direct binding site for the N-terminal SH3 domain of CRKL to a proline-rich region in the C terminus of ABL. Deletion of this region in BCR-ABL did not result in an obvious transformation defect. In cells expressing this mutant (p210ΔP1,P2) CRKL remained tyrosine-phosphorylated and was present in a complex with BCR-ABL as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. A variety of evidence suggested that another protein was mediating an indirect interaction of CRKL and BCR-ABL in this mutant cell line (19Heaney C. Kolibaba K. Bhat A. Oda T. Ohno S. Fanning S. Druker B.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 297-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A possible explanation of these data is that CBL and CRKL form a complex in BCR-ABL-expressing cells. To determine whether CBL and CRKL interact, CRKL immunoprecipitates followed by CBL immunoblots orvice versa were performed. As shown in Fig.4, these two proteins form a complex in cells expressing kinase active BCR-ABL but not in control 32D cells or cells expressing a kinase inactive BCR-ABL. Co-immunoprecipitation is also seen in cells expressing the proline deletion mutant of BCR-ABL-ΔP1, P2, and the SH2 domain deletion (Fig. 4). Using various GST-CRKL constructs, we have shown that c-CBL binds to the SH2 domain of CRKL, and this interaction is dependent on c-CBL tyrosine phosphorylation (19Heaney C. Kolibaba K. Bhat A. Oda T. Ohno S. Fanning S. Druker B.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 297-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using a gel overlay assay with GST-CRKL constructs, we find that the CRKL SH2 domain is capable of binding directly to c-CBL under conditions where c-CBL is tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 5).Figure 5Direct binding of the CRKL SH2 domain to tyrosine-phosphorylated CBL. CBL immunoprecipitates (I.P.) from lysates of the indicated cells were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were incubated with bacterially expressed CRKL SH2 domain, and binding was detected with a GST antibody (A). No binding was detected using GST alone or the CRKL SH3 domain (data not shown). The immunoblot was stripped and reprobed with CBL antisera (B) or anti-phosphotyrosine (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The data presented thus far are consistent with a model of BCR-ABL interactions shown in Fig. 6 A. In this model, BCR-ABL interacts directly and indirectly with both CRKL and CBL. That is, BCR-ABL interacts directly through its SH2 domain with tyrosine-phosphorylated CBL, and tyrosine-phosphorylated CBL also interacts with the SH2 domain of CRKL. Similarly a proline-rich region of BCR-ABL interacts directly with CRKL which in turn interacts with CBL. From this model, several predictions are possible. Using a GST-CRKL SH3 N-terminal domain, we would expect to see binding of BCR-ABL from lysates of cells expressing BCR-ABL. However, no binding should be seen using lysates of cells expressing the proline-rich deletion mutant of BCR-ABL (ΔP1,P2). As seen in Fig.7 A, this is the observed result confirming this site as a binding site between BCR-ABL and the SH3 domain of CRKL. Consistent with a lack of binding of BCR-ABL from the ΔP1, P2 mutant to the SH3 domain of CRKL, no binding of CBL is seen when lysates from 32Dp210ΔP1, P2-expressing cells are analyzed for binding to the GST-CRKL SH3 construct (Figs. 6 B and 7 C). However, using the SH2 domain of CRKL, some binding of BCR-ABL was seen from cells expressing BCR-ABL or the ΔP1, P2 mutant (Fig.7 B). This could be explained by our model with CBL binding to the SH2 domain of CRKL and presumably through another tyrosine residue also binding to BCR-ABL (Fig. 6 A). To confirm these findings, lysates of BCR-ABL cells were run over various GST-CRKL fusion proteins and analyzed for CBL binding (Fig. 7 C). In these experiments, the SH3 domain of CRKL bound to CBL from lysates of cells expressing full-length BCR-ABL. This would be expected as the SH3 domain of CRKL would interact with BCR-ABL which through its SH2 domain interacts with CBL. A prediction of this model would be that this interaction would be abolished if lysates from cells expressing the SH2 domain deletion of BCR-ABL were used in this experiment. As seen in Fig. 7 C, this prediction was confirmed as is modeled in Fig.6 C.Figure 7Binding of BCR-ABL proteins to bacterially expressed CRKL. Lysates from 32D, 32Dp210, or 32Dp210ΔP1,P2 cells were analyzed for binding to (A) GST-CRKL SH3n or (B) GST-CRKL SH2. Bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. ABL proteins were detected using the 24–21 ABL monoclonal antibody. The 32Dp210 and 32Dp210ΔP1,P2 lysates were normalized for BCR-ABL expression prior to this analysis.C, lysates from 32Dp210, 32Dp210ΔSH2, or 32Dp210ΔP1,P2 cells were analyzed for binding to the indicated GST-CRKL construct. The GST-CRKL SH3 contains both the N- and C-terminal SH3 domains of CRKL, and consistently less binding to this construct is seen as compared with the N-terminal SH3 domain alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this article we have demonstrated a direct interaction between c-CBL and BCR-ABL. Our data show that the kinase domain of ABL is not capable of binding to c-CBL, whereas a full-length BCR-ABL does, suggesting that a domain outside of the kinase is required for binding of c-CBL to BCR-ABL. The interaction of BCR-ABL and c-CBL only occurs under conditions where c-CBL is tyrosine-phosphorylated, implying that tyrosine-phosphorylated c-CBL may bind to the SH2 domain of ABL. Direct binding of the SH2 domain of ABL to c-CBL was confirmed using a gel overlay assay and again this binding only occurred in lysates where tyrosine phosphorylation of c-CBL has been demonstrated. Despite the direct interaction of c-CBL with the SH2 domain of BCR-ABL, deletion of the SH2 domain of BCR-ABL did not result in an alteration in the complex formation of BCR-ABL and c-CBL. This suggests that another site of direct interaction between c-CBL and BCR-ABL exists or that another protein mediates an indirect interaction of c-CBL and BCR-ABL. Numerous proteins have been shown to interact with BCR-ABL, and many have been shown to be tyrosine-phosphorylated in BCR-ABL expressing cells. Besides c-CBL, these proteins include rasGAP (31Druker B. Okuda K. Matulonis U. Salgia R. Roberts T. Griffin J.D. Blood. 1992; 79: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), GRB-2 (39Pendergast A.M.

In addition to binding to the SH2 domain of ABL, c-CBL was shown to bind to the SH2 domain of CRKL. c-CBL is also known to bind to the SH2 domain of the 85-kDa subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, FYN, LCK, and phospholipase C-γ (23Fukazawa T.

Binding of c-CBL to the SH3 domain of GRB-2 has also been demonstrated; however, this association decreases when c-CBL is tyrosine-phosphorylated (23Fukazawa T. Reedquist K.A. Trub T. Soltoff S.

Uemura N. Durstin M.A. Pisick E. Xu G. Li J.L. Prasad K.V. Griffin J.D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 839-846PubMed Google Scholar). Since many of these proteins also bind to BCR-ABL, they are candidates for mediating the indirect interaction of CBL with BCR-ABL. A model of the potential interactions of these proteins with each other and BCR-ABL is presented in Fig. 6. Consistent with this model, c-CBL immunoprecipitates from BCR-ABL cells not only contain BCR-ABL but also contain CRKL (29Sattler M. Salgia R. Okuda K. Uemura N. Durstin M.A. Pisick E. Xu G. Li J.L. Prasad K.V. Griffin J.D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 839-846PubMed Google Scholar). As supported by our data, tyrosine-phosphorylated c-CBL binds to the SH2 domain of ABL in BCR-ABL and to the SH2 domain of CRKL. Thus, c-CBL interacts both directly and indirectly with BCR-ABL. That is, tyrosine-phosphorylated CBL interacts directly with BCR-ABL by binding to the SH2 domain of ABL. CBL also interacts indirectly with BCR-ABL through CRKL. We have shown previously that a proline-rich region of BCR-ABL interacts directly with CRKL (19Heaney C. Kolibaba K. Bhat A. Oda T. Ohno S. Fanning S. Druker B.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 297-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and as shown here, the SH2 domain of CRKL interacts with c-CBL, thus allowing an indirect interaction of BCR-ABL and CBL. A prediction of this model would be that BCR-ABL should be capable of binding to the GST-SH2 domain of CRKL by virtue of tyrosine-phosphorylated CBL binding to BCR-ABL and the SH2 domain of CRKL. This prediction was confirmed in our GST-fusion protein experiments. Similarly, the SH3 domain of CRKL bound CBL from lysates of cells expressing full-length BCR-ABL as the SH3 domain of CRKL binds to BCR-ABL which binds through its SH2 domain to c-CBL. This interaction was abolished in cells expressing the SH2 domain deletion of BCR-ABL as modeled in Fig. 6 C. It is possible that more complicated complexes occur or that proteins other than CRKL mediate an indirect interaction between CBL and BCR-ABL. For example, the SH2 domain of GRB-2 is known to bind to Tyr-177 of BCR-ABL, and the SH3 domain of GRB-2 has been shown to bind to CBL (23Fukazawa T. Reedquist K.A. Trub T. Soltoff S. Panchamoorthy G. Druker B. Cantley L. Shoelson S.E. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19141-19150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We have not seen any defect in tyrosine phosphorylation of c-CBL in cells expressing the tyrosine to phenylalanine mutant of BCR-ABL that abolishes binding of BCR-ABL to GRB-2 (data not shown). However, this mutant would be expected to bind c-CBL through an intact SH2 domain. As tyrosine-phosphorylated CBL also binds to the SH2 domain of CRKL, it is possible that GRB-2 binding to BCR-ABL allows CRKL to associate with BCR-ABL through this interaction with CBL. Given the multitude of complexes induced by BCR-ABL, combinations of mutants (e.g. Tyr-177 to Phe with a deletion of the SH2 domain and a deletion of proline-rich sequences in the C terminus of ABL) will be required to determine the roles of various signaling proteins in BCR-ABL transformation. Results of these experiments may not allow an assessment of the requirement of an individual protein for transformation by BCR-ABL as these mutants might abolish complex formation of several proteins with BCR-ABL. Assessment of the role of individual proteins may require the use of cell lines generated from mice lacking some of these signaling proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2317224850,"The urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (u-PAR) facilitates extracellular matrix degradation in part by accelerating plasmin formation at the cell surface. We previously reported that u-PAR expression is elevated in colon cancer cell lines characterized by their in vitro invasive capacity. Since, u-PAR expression is increased by a variety of growth factors, which signal through the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/ERK2), we determined if these mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) regulate u-PAR expression in two cultured colon cancer cell lines. An in-gel kinase assay showed that ERK1 activity was considerably higher in RKO cells, which display > or = 10(5) receptors/cell, than the GEO cells which have approximately 10(4) urokinase receptors per cell. The expression of either an ERK-inactivating phosphatase (CL100), or a kinase-defective ERK1, decreased the activity of a u-PAR promoter-driven CAT reporter in RKO cells. Immune complex kinase assays indicated that the constitutive ERK1 activity in RKO cells was largely a result of an activated MEK1. Further, treatment of RKO cells with a specific inhibitor (PD 098059) of MEK1 activation, which diminished ERK1 activity, reduced the amount of urokinase specifically bound to the cell surface and this was associated with reduced laminin degradation. The expression of a dominant negative c-Raf-1 also reduced u-PAR promoter activity suggesting that MEK1 activation involved an activator at, or upstream, of this serine-threonine kinase. Transfection of the u-PAR-deficient GEO cells with a constitutively activated MEK1 expression construct up-regulated u-PAR promoter activity. Similarly treatment of GEO cells with a phosphatase inhibitor (sodium vanadate) caused a dose-dependent increase in ERK1 activity which paralleled increased cell surface binding of urokinase. Taken together, these data suggest that elevated u-PAR expression, in at least a sub-population of colon cancer, is partly a consequence of a constitutively activated ERK-1-dependent signaling cascade."
https://openalex.org/W1982072199,"We have previously shown that stimulation of 32D cl3 cells with interleukin (IL)-3 results in the activation of three src-like tyrosine kinases, fyn, hck, and lyn. The β subunit of the IL-3 receptor co-immunoprecipitated with hck in lysates of both unstimulated and IL-3-stimulated cells; however, the β subunit did not precipitate with either fyn or lyn. The association of these three kinases with the β subunit of the IL-3 receptor was further investigated using bacterial fusion proteins encoding the unique, SH3, and SH2 domains of these three kinases. Fusion proteins of both hck and fyn bound to a 150-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein present in lysates of IL-3-stimulated cells. This protein was identified as the β subunit of the IL-3 receptor by immunoblotting with an anti-β antibody. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing the SH2 domain of hck bound to the β subunit although the amount of β subunit that bound to the SH2 domain alone was only 30% of that which bound to the fusion protein containing the unique, SH3, and SH2 domains. This indicates that the SH2 domain is one of the motifs involved in binding hck to the β subunit. A GST fusion protein encoding a 236-amino acid region of the cytoplasmic tail of the β subunit, which contained four tyrosine residues, bound to hck and fyn. Binding to both proteins was dramatically increased when the GST-β fusion protein was tyrosine-phosphorylated. Far Western blot analysis was used to demonstrate the binding of the unique, SH3, and SH2 domains of hck to this 236-amino acid region of the β subunit; tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein increased the binding of both the unique region and the SH2 domain probes. These data indicate that binding of hck to the β subunit is mediated by both phosphotyrosine-dependent and -independent mechanisms.

Investigations with cell lines lacking specific Janus family members have indicated that they are critical in stimulating proliferation in response to some cytokines (22Watling D. Guschin D.

Therefore, the precise role of src-like kinases in cytokine-mediated signaling events and cytokine-mediated proliferation has not yet been determined. We have been investigating the activation of src-like kinases in signal transduction by the IL-3 1The abbreviations used are: IL-3, interleukin-3; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GST-pβ, the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of GST-β PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ECL, enhanced chemiluminescence lighting. receptor. Following IL-3 stimulation of the murine myeloid cell line 32D cl3, we have observed the activation of three src-like kinases: fyn, hck, and lyn (11Anderson S.M. Jorgensen B. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1660-1670PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic activation of each kinase was rapid and transient. Over-expression of these three kinases in 32D cl3 cells resulted in an elevated level of tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity. Over-expression of c-src in the same cells, however, did not result in the activation of this kinase, suggesting specificity in which src-like kinases are activated by the IL-3 receptor (11Anderson S.M. Jorgensen B. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1660-1670PubMed Google Scholar). In our previous studies, we observed the apparent association of hck with a 150-kDa protein that became tyrosine-phosphorylated following stimulation of cells with IL-3 (11Anderson S.M. Jorgensen B. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1660-1670PubMed Google Scholar). Although we suggested that this protein might represent the β subunit of the IL-3 receptor, this was not proven by immunoblotting. There are at least five proteins with molecular masses between 120,000 and 150,000 Da that become phosphorylated on tyrosine residues following IL-3 stimulation. These proteins include cbl (24Anderson S.M. Burton E.A. Koch B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 739-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), JAK2 (12Silvennoinen O.

The latter two proteins migrate near the upper region of the 120–150,000 Da molecular mass range with a migration pattern similar to that observed in our previous study (11Anderson S.M. Jorgensen B. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1660-1670PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that the β subunit co-immunoprecipitates with hck but not with fyn or lyn, that fusion proteins encoding the unique, SH3, and SH2 domains of either hck or fyn bound to the β subunit, and that hck and fyn bind to a specific region of the receptor in both phosphotyrosine-dependent and -independent manners. The potential role for this binding in regulation of kinase activation and signaling mechanisms is discussed. The 32D cl3 cell line was obtained from Dr. Joel Greenberger (University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA) and was maintained as described (29Greenberger J.S. Sakakeeny M.A. Humphries K.C. Eaves C.J. Eckner R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2931-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). All media components were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Recombinant murine IL-3 was obtained from Collaborative Biotechnology (Bedford, MA). Generation and characterization of the 32D/fyn and 32D/hck cell lines is described elsewhere (11Anderson S.M. Jorgensen B. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1660-1670PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterial expression vectors encoding different regions of fyn, hck, or lyn coupled to glutathione S-transferase (GST) were either constructed for this study or were provided by other investigators. The following expression vectors were obtained from Dr. John Cambier (National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Diseases, Denver, CO): FYN-(1–255), FYN-SH2, FYN-SH3, and FYN-(1–27) (30Crews C.M. Erikson R.L. Cell. 1993; 74 (abstr.): 215-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). GST-HCK-(1–61) was obtained from Dr. Clifford Lowell (University of California, San Francisco, CA) (31Lowell C.A. Soriano P. Varmus H.E. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The following GST fusion proteins were prepared for this study. GST-FYN, GST-HCK, GST-LYN, GST-HCK-SH3, and GST-HCK-SH2. The unique, SH3, and SH2 domains of fyn, hck, and lyn were amplified by PCR and cloned into GEX-2T. The primers and insertion sites for each construction are as follows. FYN was inserted between theBamHI and EcoRI sites (sense primer 5′-GAAGATCTGGCCTGTGTGCAATGTAAG-3′, antisense primer 5′-GAGAATTCGGCCACAAAGAGTGTCAC-3′); HCK was inserted between theBamHI and EcoRI sites (sense primer 5′-GAAGATCTAAGTCCAAGTTCCTCCAG-3′, antisense primer 5′-GAGAATTCCCCGTCGTTCCCCTTCTT-3′); and LYN was inserted between the BamHI and EcoRI sites (sense primer 5′-GAAGATCTGGATGTATTAAATCAAAA-3′, antisense primer 5′-GAGAATTCGGCCACCACAATGTCACC-3′). The SH3 domain of hck was amplified by PCR (sense primer 5′-CAGATCTATTACCAGGCCATTCACCA-3′, antisense primer 5′-GAATCCAGAGAGTCAACGCGGGCGAC-3′), ligated to the pCR2 cloning vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), and plasmid DNA purified. The vector was then cut with BglII and EcoRI and ligated into pGEX-3X at the BamHI and EcoRI sites to generate GST-HCK-SH3. The SH2 domain of hck was amplified by PCR (sense primer 5′-GTTAGATCTATGGAGACAGAGGAGTGGTT-3′, antisense primer 5′-GAGAATTCCCCGTCGTTCCCCTTCTT-3′), ligated into pCR2, and plasmid DNA purified. The SH2 domain was released by digestion withBglII and EcoRI and ligated into theBamHI sites and EcoRI sites of pGEX-4T3 to generate GST-HCK-SH2. GST fusion proteins encoding different regions of the cytoplasmic tail of the murine βc subunit were prepared by cloning a 702-base pair fragment of AIC2B (kindly provided by Dr. A. Miyajima, DNAX Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA), from amino acids 481 to 716, into GEX-3X and is referred to as β-702. This fragment contains four tyrosine residues (Tyr529, Tyr595, Tyr630, and Tyr710). The GEX expression vectors were either introduced into competent DH5α bacteria or into TKB1 or TKX1 bacteria (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The latter two strains of bacteria contain an inducible elk1 tyrosine kinase and allow for the production of tyrosine-phosphorylated bacterial fusion proteins. Expression of GST-fusion proteins in DH5α was induced as follows. Individual colonies picked from plates were grown in 50 ml of Luria Broth overnight. The cultures were diluted 1:20 and grown for 2 h, after which isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added at a final concentration of 0.1 mm. The cultures were then grown for an additional 4 h before protein purification. Expression of the fusion proteins in TKB1 or TKX1 cells was accomplished as follows. Colonies picked from plates were grown in 100 ml of Luria Broth overnight. Cultures were diluted 1:10 and allowed to grow for 2 h, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. After an additional 2 h, indoleacrylic acid was added at a final concentration of 53 μm, and the cultures allowed to grow for 2 h. Both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated proteins were purified by the same means. Briefly, bacteria were pelleted at 6,000 rpm for 10 min in a Beckman JA10 rotor. The pelleted cells were resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA) containing 100 units/ml aprotinin and lysed by sonication. To aid in protein solubilization, Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1% and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 9,500 rpm for 10 min. Supernatants were incubated with 2 ml of a 50% slurry of glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were isolated by centrifugation, and washed with lysis buffer three times. The fusion protein was removed from the beads by the addition of free reduced glutathione. Excess glutathione was removed from the isolated fusion protein by centrifugation using Centrex UF-2 10 K Spin Columns (Schleicher & Schuell). Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Agarose-conjugated 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) was loaded onto Poly-Prep columns (Bio-Rad) and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Concentrated fusion protein was added to the column and eluted with 100 mm phenyl phosphate in phosphate-buffered saline. Column fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the peak fractions were concentrated using Centrex UF2 columns (Schleicher and Schuell). This step also served to remove the free phenyl phosphate. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (11Anderson S.M. Jorgensen B. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1660-1670PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to fyn and anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 coupled to agarose beads were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Antibodies to hck and GST were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Additional antibodies to fyn and lyn were obtained from Transduction Laboratory (Lexington, KY). A polyclonal antibody to GST-β was raised in rabbits and affinity purified. A monoclonal antibody to GST-β was also prepared by conventional hybridoma technology. Monoclonal antibody 377C2 was used in these studies. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electro-transferred to Immobilon membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Immunoblotting was conducted as described using the enhanced chemiluminescence lighting (ECL) system according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Life Sciences Inc.). Cell extracts were prepared from either unstimulated or IL-3-stimulated 32D cl3 cells by lysing in RIPA (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with 100 units/ml aprotinin and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) and by removing particulate matter by centrifugation for 30 min at 13,000 rpm in a refrigerated Savant microfuge. Each binding assay contained the lysate from 2 × 107 cells. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The GST proteins were then added directly to the clarified lysates and allowed to incubate for 1 h at 4 °C. The concentration of GST fusion protein added varied in each study, and the amount used in each experiment is indicated in each figure legend. The complexed proteins were isolated by the addition of 50 μl of glutathione-agarose beads for 30 min, and the protein complexes were washed three times with RIPA buffer with aprotinin. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted as described. Far Western blot analysis was conducted by running proteins of interest on an SDS gel, transferring the proteins to Immobilon, and probing the filter with a biotinylated bacterial fusion protein. Complexes were visualized by probing with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham) and performing the ECL protocol. All procedures were as described for immunoblotting, and biotinylation was accomplished with a kit from Amersham used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In our previous studies, we examined the activation of src-like kinases following IL-3 stimulation of 32D cl3 cells (11Anderson S.M. Jorgensen B. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1660-1670PubMed Google Scholar). In those studies, we observed that a 150-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein co-immunoprecipitated with hck in anti-hck immunoprecipitates. The size of this protein suggested to us that it might represent the β subunit of the IL-3 receptor; however, this was not demonstrated by immunoblotting due to the poor quality of the anti-β antibody preparations available at that time. Since that time, we have prepared an anti-β subunit monoclonal antibody for use in immunoblotting studies. Furthermore, it has recently become clear that there are at least two other proteins with molecular masses of 140–150,000 Da that become tyrosine-phosphorylated following IL-3 stimulation. These proteins include SHIP (27Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A. Tsai S. Carlberg K. Aebersold R. Rohrschneider L.R. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 1084-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 32Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Baltimore D. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 2736-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) and CAS.2 To confirm that the 150-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein that associates with hck was the β subunit, we again performed immunoprecipitation studies. Nonimmune serum and antibodies directed against hck, fyn, and lyn were added to lysates from unstimulated and IL-3-stimulated 32D cl3 cells. These immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-β subunit antibody 377C2. As shown in Fig. 1, the anti-hck antisera precipitates a protein of 150 kDa from lysates of unstimulated and stimulated 32D cl3 cells (Fig.1, compare lanes 3–4 with 9–10). Based upon the reactivity of this protein with the anti-β monoclonal antibody, this protein represents the β subunit of the IL-3 receptor. The anti-hck antisera immunoprecipitated approximately 2- or 3-fold more β subunit from the lysates of IL-3-stimulated cells compared with the amount of the protein that co-precipitated with hck from lysates of unstimulated cells, as determined by densitometry. Conversely, this protein did not appear in immunoprecipitates using nonimmune, anti-fyn, or anti-lyn sera. These data confirm our previous hypothesis that the β subunit of the IL-3 receptor co-immunoprecipitates with hck but not with fyn or lyn. These new results also indicate that hck may be associated with the β subunit in the absence of IL-3 stimulation (Fig. 1, lane 3). This possibility was not explored in our previous work and suggests that hck may be constitutively associated with the IL-3 receptor. To further explore this association between src-like kinases and the β subunit, we utilized GST-fusion proteins encoding the unique, SH3, and SH2 domains of hck, fyn, and lyn to determine whether they bound to any tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in IL-3-stimulated 32D cl3 cells. GST, GST-HCK, GST-FYN, or GST-LYN were added to lysates of IL-3-stimulated 32D cl3 cells at a final concentration of 2 μm. A specific set of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were observed to bind to GST-HCK, GST-FYN, and GST-LYN; however, none of these proteins bound to GST alone (Fig.2 A, compare lane 1 with2–4). Of greatest interest was the 150-kDa band present inlanes 2 and 3 of Fig. 2 A. While this band most likely comprises several proteins, its size suggests that it may contain the β subunit of the IL-3 receptor. Several other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were also observed to bind, including a protein of 120 kDa that bound to both GST-HCK and GST-LYN but to a lesser extent to GST-FYN in this study (Fig.2 B). This protein is the cbl protooncogene, based upon its size and immunoblotting studies (24Anderson S.M. Burton E.A. Koch B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 739-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition, a protein of approximately 56 kDa was noted to bind to both GST-HCK and GST-FYN but not to GST-LYN (data not shown). Based upon its apparent molecular mass and immunoblotting studies, this protein appears to be the SH2-containing adapter protein Shc (data not shown). To investigate whether the 150-kDa band contains the β subunit, immunoblotting was performed using a monoclonal antibody directed against the β subunit of the IL-3 receptor. Lysates of unstimulated and IL-3 stimulated cells were used in a binding assay with the GST, GST-HCK, GST-FYN, or GST-LYN fusion proteins, and the bound proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis with the anti-β antibody. A major band of 150 kDa was observed to bind to GST-HCK and GST-FYN in lysates of IL-3-stimulated cells but not in lysates of unstimulated cells (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3–6). This band co-migrated with the 150-kDa band present in whole cell lysates of both unstimulated and stimulated cells (Fig. 2 B, lanes 9 and 10). This protein was not observed to bind to either GST or GST-LYN fusion proteins regardless of whether lysates of unstimulated or stimulated cells were used in the binding reactions. The amount of β subunit that bound to GST-FYN was only 50% of that which bound to GST-HCK. This clearly indicates that the β subunit of the IL-3 receptor is among the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins present in lysates of IL-3-stimulated cells that bind to GST-HCK and GST-FYN. A major mechanism for interaction with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins is by means of SH2 domains, which are known to bind to phosphotyrosine residues in a sequence-specific context. To investigate whether the SH2 domains of hck and fyn are involved in the binding of these proteins to the β subunit, binding studies were conducted with a series of bacterial fusion proteins containing individual domains of either hck or fyn. Proteins included in this study were GST-HCK (which spans amino acids 1–255), GST-HCK-(1–61) (which spanned amino acids 1–61, including most of the unique region), GST-HCK-SH3, GST-HCK-SH2, GST-FYN, GST-FYN-(1–27), GST-FYN-SH3, and GST-FYN-SH2. The 150-kDa band corresponding to the β subunit bound only to the GST-HCK and GST-HCK-SH2 fusion proteins. The amount of the β subunit that bound to GST-HCK-SH2 was only 30% of that which bound to GST-HCK (Fig. 3, top panel; fourth and tenth lanes). This indicates that the SH2 domain of hck can bind to the tyrosine-phosphorylated β subunit on its own; however, high affinity binding of GST-HCK to the β subunit may require the interaction of multiple domains of HCK with the β subunit. In contrast to the results obtained with hck, it appears that the binding of fyn to the β subunit is more complex and requires multiple regions of fyn. Although GST-FYN, which includes the unique, SH3, and SH2 domains, bound the β subunit, none of the individual domains bound to the β subunit (Fig. 3, bottom panel). Therefore, unlike hck, no single domain can be identified as mediating binding to the β subunit. The above studies clearly suggest that the binding of hck to the β subunit involves recognition of phosphorylated tyrosine residues by the SH2 domain of this kinase. To provide further support that the β subunit was capable of binding to hck and fyn, we prepared a GST fusion protein encoding a region of the β subunit that contains four tyrosine residues. This region is immediately C-terminal to the box 1 sequence and spans amino acids 481 to 716 of the mouse βc subunit. This fusion protein was prepared in both nonphosphorylated and tyrosine-phosphorylated versions by growing the cells in bacteria that contain an inducible elk tyrosine kinase. Approximately 50% of the GST-pβ purified from TKB1 bacteria was tyrosine-phosphorylated (data not shown); therefore, the GST-pβ protein used in these studies was subjected to anti-phosphotyrosine immunoaffinity purification to ensure that all the protein was phosphorylated on at least one tyrosine residue. Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting indicated that there was no detectable phosphotyrosine in the GST-β fusion protein prepared in DH5α bacteria (see Fig. 5below). Cell lysates were prepared from 32D cl3 cells, and the amount of hck that bound to GST-β and GST-pβ (tyrosine-phosphorylated GST-β) quantitated by immunoblot analysis with anti-hck antibody. Both GST-β and GST-pβ bound to hck; however, there was an approximate 20-fold increase in the amount of hck bound to GST-pβ compared with the amount bound to GST-β, as determined by densitometric measurements of the band intensities (Fig.4 A). The fact that hck was observed to bind to both GST-β and GST-pβ indicates that there are phosphotyrosine-dependent and -independent interactions between hck and the β subunit. The addition of GST-β protein to anti-fyn or anti-hck immunoprecipitates, in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, did not result in the phosphorylation of GST-β (data not shown). Therefore, we do not believe that the binding of hck to GST-β reflects the fact that the GST-β fusion protein may have been phosphorylated by hck or other src-like kinases.Figure 4A tyrosine-phosphorylated fusion protein containing a region of the β subunit can bind to hck and fyn in solution. Cell lysates from 32D cl3 cells (A) and 32D/fyn (B) cells, which overexpress fyn (11Anderson S.M. Jorgensen B. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1660-1670PubMed Google Scholar), were prepared from cells that had been cultured overnight in the absence of IL-3. GST, GST-β, or GST-pβ (the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of GST-β) were added to the cell lysates at a final concentration of 2 μm in panel A and 10 μm inpanel B. The bound proteins were isolated as described and resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The immunoblots were probed with anti-hck (panel A) or anti-fyn (panel B) antibodies.

https://openalex.org/W2019684813,"We incorporated 3H-labeled thymidine, deoxycytidine, or cytidine into dNTPs and DNA of exponentially growing CEM cells. G1 and S phase cells were separated by centrifugal elutriation, and the size and specific activity of dNTP pools were determined to study the cell cycle-dependent regulation of specific dNTP synthesizing enzymes in their metabolic context. With [3H]thymidine, we confirm the earlier demonstrated S phase specificity of thymidine kinase. Incorporation of radioactivity from [5-3H]deoxycytidine into dCTP occurred almost exclusively in G1 cells. During S phase, de novo synthesis by ribonucleotide reductase was switched on, resulting in a 70-fold dilution of [3H]dCTP, confirming that ribonucleotide reductase is an S phase-specific enzyme, whereas deoxycytidine kinase is not. [5-3H]Cytidine appeared in dCTP almost to the same extent in G1 as in S phase, despite the S phase specificity of ribonucleotide reductase. During S phase, DNA replication greatly increased the turnover of dCTP, requiring a corresponding increase in ribonucleotide reductase activity. During G1, the enzyme maintained activity to provide dNTPs for DNA repair and mitochondrial DNA synthesis. The poor incorporation of isotope from deoxycytidine into DNA earlier led to the suggestion that the nucleoside is used only for DNA repair (Xu, Y-Z., Peng, H., and Plunkett, W. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 631–637). The poor phosphorylation of deoxycytidine in S phase provides a better explanation.

In mammalian cells, many of the enzymes required for the production of dNTPs are regulated during the cell cycle such that their activities increase during S phase, the time of DNA replication (1Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar).

Conversely, deoxycytidine kinase (8Arnér E.S. Eriksson S. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1995; 67: 155-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) is constitutively active, and also thymidylate synthase undergoes only minor variations during the cell cycle (9Rode W. Scanlon K.J. Moroson B.A. Bertino J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1305-1311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the activity of enzymes belonging to the de novo pathway as well as enzymes of the salvage pathway may either vary greatly or not at all during the cell cycle. This picture comes largely from experiments in which the activity of enzymes was measured either directly in cell extracts or by an in situ assay in intact cells. The latter method is of greater physiological relevance. It involves incubation of cells in culture with highly radioactive ribo- or deoxyribonucleosides, usually followed by an analysis of the time-dependent flow of isotope through the nucleotide pools into nucleic acids and, in appropriate cases, into excretion products in the medium.

Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 114-120PubMed Google Scholar) affecting enzymes of dNTP synthesis influence the flow of isotope and can give information about the normal process. Two major pitfalls of this technology are all too often neglected (1Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar): (i) heterogeneity in the cell population under study and (ii) changes in the specific radioactivity of the dNTP pools. The two factors may combine and distort the result to a point where they are misinterpreted (14Plucinski T.M. Fager R.S. Reddy G.P.V. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 114-120PubMed Google Scholar). This was first recognized in experiments with Chinese hamster ovary cells (15Leeds J.M. Mathews C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 532-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and further studied in more detail with V79 (16Bianchi V. Pontis E. Reichard P. Exper. Cell Res. 1992; 199: 120-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and CEM (13Bianchi V. Ferraro P. Borella S. Bonvini P. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16677-16683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cells. Consider a population of cycling cells in culture in which the DNA is labeled from a nucleoside. Fig. 1 shows the series of reactions that, after the entry of a labeled nucleoside into the cell, transform the nucleoside into a labeled dNTP prior to incorporation into DNA. A deoxyribonucleoside, such as thymidine or deoxycytidine, is transformed directly via three phosphorylation steps, whereas a ribonucleoside, such as cytidine, is first phosphorylated to CDP, followed by reduction to dCDP by ribonucleotide reductase, and finally phosphorylated to dCTP. The radioactive nucleotides mix with nucleotides synthesized de novo, resulting in dilution of radioactivity. The specific radioactivity of a dNTP pool thus depends not only on the efficiency with which the nucleoside is transformed to the dNTP but also on the rate at which the dNTP is synthesized de novo. An additional important consideration is the rate with which the dNTP is removed, either by its catabolism or by its utilization for DNA synthesis. The specific activity of the dNTP gives an indication of the relative activities of all these processes. The dilution factor may vary widely between cells inside or outside S phase. Deoxycytidine kinase, the enzyme that phosphorylates not only deoxycytidine but also deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine, is not cell cycle-regulated (8Arnér E.S. Eriksson S. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1995; 67: 155-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The nucleosides are therefore phosphorylated to the same extent in S phase and in G1 or G2cells. In contrast, the de novo synthesis of unlabeled dNTPs via ribonucleotide reductase proceeds at a faster rate during S phase when this enzyme is turned on (5Eriksson S. Gräslund A. Skog S. Thelander L. Tribukait B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11695-11700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Björklund S. Skog S. Tribukait B. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5452-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 7Johansson E. Skogman E. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30162-30167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The dilution of isotope from deoxycytidine to dCTP is therefore much larger in S phase. In an asynchronous cell population, the measured specific activity of the dCTP pool is an average for dCTP from all cells. DNA replication utilizes only the pool of S phase cells that has a lower value. Calculating the rate of DNA replication from the average specific activity then gives too low a value (17Nicander B. Reichard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1347-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The situation differs for thymidine, since thymidine kinase is cell cycle-regulated and increases in S phase. In this case, the average specific activity of dTTP in a cycling population is close to that of S phase cells (17Nicander B. Reichard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1347-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To obtain true measurements of the turnover of dNTP pools in relation to DNA replication, one must use cells whose stage in the cell cycle is defined. To achieve this, previous studies used cells synchronized by isoleucine (18Leeds J.M. Slabaugh M.B. Mathews C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3442-3450Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar) or serum starvation (19Spyrou G. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 960-964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or they employed inhibitors of DNA replication (9Rode W. Scanlon K.J. Moroson B.A. Bertino J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1305-1311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were then analyzed at different times after the release of the block as they moved more or less synchronously through the cell cycle. In a different approach, cells from an asynchronous population can be separated by centrifugal elutriation (20Sanderson R.J. Bird K.E. Methods Cell Biol. 1977; 15: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 21Kauffman M.G. Noga S.J. Kelly T.J. Donnenberg A.D. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and then analyzed for specific cell cycle-related activities. With this method, cells are separated according to size into fractions enriched in small G1 cells, larger S phase cells, or still larger G2 cells. Some overlap occurs, but by analyzing separate subpopulations with various proportions of G1 and S phase cells, valuable information can be obtained on enzyme activities in specific phases of normal cells. In the present work, we combined centrifugal elutriation with the use of radioactive nucleosides to define the pool sizes and specific activities of dNTPs in G1 and S cells labeled from thymidine, deoxycytidine, or cytidine. CEM cells from exponentially growing cultures labeled from nucleosides were separated, and subpopulations enriched in different phases of the cell cycle were obtained. The specific activities of appropriate pyrimidine dNTP pools of G1 and S phase cells were determined, and the rate of DNA replication was calculated from the incorporation of isotope into DNA. 3H-Labeled nucleosides were obtained from Amersham Life Science, Inc., with the following specific activities (in Ci/mmol): [3H-methyl]thymidine, 20; [5-3H]deoxycytidine, 26; [5-3H]cytidine, 28. One μCi corresponded to 1.12 million cpm in our liquid scintillation counter. 32P-Labeled dATP (for pool determinations) was also from Amersham. The human T lymphoblasts CEM CCL 119 line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. These cells are considered to be diploid but contain about 5% polyploid cells. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum, glutamine, and antibiotics, at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Under these conditions, the population doubling time was 24 h. Absence of Mycoplasma contamination in the cultures was ascertained periodically with a kit based on the detection of Mycoplasma-specific rRNA (Gen-probe Inc., San Diego, CA). For the experiments, cultures were started by inoculating 0.2 × 106 cells/ml in fresh medium. After 48 h, the cells were counted, and about 150 × 106 cells were transferred without change of medium to a 225-cm2flask, returned to the incubator, and incubated with the radioactive precursor for the appropriate time. The cells were handled in a climatized room at 37 °C to minimize interference with cell metabolism. Tritiated thymidine, deoxycytidine, and cytidine were used at 0.1 μm final concentration at the specific activities supplied by the manufacturers. At the end of the incubations, replicate samples of 1–2 × 106 cells were taken as controls and immediately processed for extraction of the soluble nucleotide pool and the macromolecular fraction, while the remaining cell suspension was separated by elutriation to obtain populations of cells enriched in different phases of the cell cycle. The cell suspension was chilled on ice, and cells were collected by centrifugation in a refrigerated centrifuge (10 min at 500 × g) and then resuspended in 8 ml of ice-cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum. They were immediately injected in the elutriation chamber of a Beckman Avanti J-25 high performance centrifuge equipped with a JE-6B rotor and a standard chamber and a Cole-Parmer system model 7553-75 pump. The centrifuge was run continuously at 2500 rpm. Eight separate fractions were collected by pumping ice-cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal calf serum through the chamber at increasing flow rates (18, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, and 30 ml/min). The first two fractions were 50 ml each, and the others were 100 ml. The first and last fractions were discarded. The latter contained a high percentage of polyploid cells. Each elutriated fraction was immediately centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 500 × g, and the sedimented cells were suspended in 5 ml of cold Hanks' saline, sedimented again by 5-min centrifugation at 300 × g, and resuspended in 5 ml of cold saline. Cells were counted in a Coulter Z1 counter, portions (106 cells) were taken for flow cytometric analysis and autoradiography, and the rest was used for nucleotide pool and DNA analyses. The distribution of cells in the different phases of the cell cycle was determined by flow cytometry in an Epics-Elite flow cytometer (Coulter), equipped with a 488-nm argon ion laser running at 15 milliwatts. The percentage of S phase cells was also measured by autoradiography, since flow cytometry did not score very early S phase cells whose DNA content had only increased minimally. The slides were prepared as described previously (22Ferraro P. Bianchi V. Biasin M.R. Celotti L. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 199: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), covered with autoradiographic emulsion (K2 Ilford, Eastman Kodak Co.), exposed for 15 days at 4 °C in the dark, developed, fixed, and stained with 10% Giemsa. Labeling indexes were determined by counting 1500 cells/slide. The values from autoradiography, rather than from flow cytometry, were used for the calculations of S phase. Extraction of the soluble nucleotide pool and determination of dNTP pool size and specific activity were performed as described (23Hellgren D. Nilsson S. Reichard Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 88: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 24Sherman P.A. Fyfe J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Substances interfering with the analyses in experiments involving labeling from cytidine were removed by acid treatment (11Bianchi V. Pontis E. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16037-16042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of CTP in the cells labeled from cytidine was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography on Partisil-10 SAX, using isocratic elution with 0.4m NH4H2PO4, pH 2.9 (25Tanaka K. Yoshioka A. Tanaka S. Wataya Y. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 139: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The dNTP determinations gave the size and specific activity of dNTP pools of subpopulations enriched with respect to G1, S, or G2 cells. They did not give the values of pure cell cycle populations. Such values could be calculated from data sets of elutriated enriched subpopulations as shown by the following example; two fractions devoid of G2 cells (fractions 1–5 in Fig. 2) were used for two sets of two equations. The first set served to determine pool sizes in S phase (a) and G1 (b) from the following equation that uses the experimental data obtained from one subpopulation rich in G1 cells (e.g. fraction 2 in Fig. 2) and one rich in S phase cells (e.g. fraction 5 in Fig. 2): (a × % cells in S) + (b × % cells in G1) = 100 × dNTP pool sizedet. Oncea and b are known, the second two-equation system can be solved to determine x (the specific activity in S) and y (the specific activity in G1): (a × x × % cells in S) + (b × y × % cells in G1) = 100 × dNTPsize × specific activitydet. Values of a, b, x, and yobtained by combining the data from different pairs of elutriated cell populations were averaged. The specific activity for the dNTP pools of S phase cells could then be used to measure the true rate of DNA synthesis. The cells remaining after extraction of the soluble pool with methanol were dissolved in 1 ml of 0.3 m NaOH, and the radioactivity in DNA was determined (10Nicander B. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5376-5381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of DNA synthesis is expressed as pmol of dNMP incorporated per min by dividing the increase in radioactivity (cpm/min) during a time window by the averaged specific activity (cpm/pmol) of the dNTP during the same window. Cytidine and deoxycytidine were labeled with tritium in the 5-position of the pyrimidine ring. The isotope equilibrates with water during the methylation of dUMP to dTMP, and the label is therefore not incorporated into thymine of DNA. Thymidine and deoxycytidine are both efficiently phosphorylated to deoxynucleotides by mammalian cells, more so than purine deoxynucleosides, which are rapidly degraded by catabolic enzymes. In lymphoid cells, deoxycytidine kinase is highly expressed, and these cells phosphorylate deoxycytidine more actively than most other cell types (8Arnér E.S. Eriksson S. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1995; 67: 155-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). However, in exponentially growing CEM cells, the incorporation of radioactivity from deoxycytidine into DNA is low compared with that of thymidine (Table I). The cultures were incubated for either 30 or 60 min with the labeled deoxynucleoside, after which time the incorporation of radioactivity into DNA and dCTP or dTTP was measured. Whereas the specific activity of dCTP labeled from deoxycytidine is 5–6-fold higher than that of dTTP labeled from thymidine, the incorporation is reversed, with 5 times more radioactivity in DNA in the presence of thymidine. When these data are used to calculate the rate of DNA synthesis from the apparent incorporation of each dNMP into DNA during the time window as described under “Experimental Procedures,” the value in the deoxycytidine experiment is only 5% compared with the thymidine experiment. Table I also gives the results from a parallel experiment in which dCTP and DNA were labeled from radioactive cytidine via thede novo pathway. The rate of DNA synthesis is now close to that found in the thymidine experiment.Table IRate of DNA replication calculated from the specific activity of dNTPs in cycling cellsPrecursordNTPDNARadioactivityRate of synthesiscpm/pmolcpm/min/10 6 cellspmol/min/10 6 cellsThymidine115032002.8Deoxycytidine61507300.12Cytidine91015001.6 Open table in a new tab The poor incorporation of deoxycytidine into DNA agrees with previous data (10Nicander B.

A. 1983; 80: 1347-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It suggests compartmentation of the dCTP pool, either intracellular or intercellular. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we separated CEM cells, labeled during exponential growth from nucleosides, by centrifugal elutriation to determine separately the labeling of S phase and G1 cells. The procedure gives subpopulations of cells enriched in different phases of the cell cycle. Each can then be analyzed separately, and the results can be used to calculate dNTP pool sizes and specific activities of G1 and S phase cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 2 shows results concerning cell distribution among different cycle phases in the various subpopulation determined by flow cytometry and autoradiography. In this experiment, the cells were labeled for 60 min with thymidine, but closely similar separations were obtained in all other experiments reported here. G1 cells dominated in fractions 1 and 2, and S phase cells dominated in fractions 4–6, with fraction 3 taking an intermediate position (Fig. 2). G2 cells started to appear in fractions 5 and 6 and were abundant in fraction 7. For our calculations, we always paired two fractions with opposite extreme values for G1 and S phase cells and lacking G2cells. Fraction 1 often contained too few cells to give reliable results. The discrepancy in the amount of S phase cells determined by flow cytometry and autoradiography was expected. The latter method always gave a larger proportion of S phase cells. The effect was much more pronounced in the early fractions that contain small cells than in later ones with larger cells. A correlation between the two methods is given in Fig. 3 with data from several experiments using either labeled thymidine or deoxycytidine. The same correlation was found with both labeled nucleosides, although cells in the deoxycytidine experiments were less intensely labeled, suggesting that the two deoxynucleosides labeled the same cell population. In the equations described under “Experimental Procedures,” we used the values from autoradiography, since they include all S phase cells. Since only subfractions lacking G2 cells were used, the fraction of G1 cells could be calculated by the difference. In the cytidine experiment, autoradiography was not feasible, since cytidine is extensively incorporated into RNA. Fig. 3 was used to correct the data from flow cytometry. Incubations were carried out with a 0.1 μm concentration of each highly labeled nucleoside for two time periods (30 and 60 min for deoxynucleosides, 60 and 120 min for cytidine). The two time points served to measure the increase of isotope in DNA from which we calculated the rate of DNA synthesis. The time window was chosen such that the specific activity of the dNTP approached a steady-state value. Cells were immediately separated by centrifugal elutriation into fractions such as shown in Fig. 2, and the dNTP pools of the subpopulations were analyzed. Cell isolation involved a series of centrifugations in the cold, and we cannot rule out some breakdown of dNTPs during this process. This would not affect determinations of specific activities but would influence measurements of pool sizes. A portion of the cells before elutriation, representing the exponentially growing culture was used to determine isotope incorporation into DNA. Fig. 4 shows results of dNTP pool analyses in fractions from CEM cells separated by elutriation after 60 min of incubation with tritiated thymidine (Fig.4 A) or deoxycytidine (Fig. 4 B) or 120 min with cytidine (Fig. 4 C). Subpopulations are numbered as in Fig.2. Similar results were obtained in each experiment also at the earlier time point (data not shown). All fractions were analyzed by flow cytometry, and in the thymidine and deoxycytidine experiments also by autoradiography, to determine the distribution of cells along the cell cycle. These data, which are not shown here, were used for the equations to calculate pool sizes and specific activities. In Fig. 4 A (thymidine experiment) the specific activity of dTTP increased progressively from the early fractions rich in G1 cells to later ones, rich in S phase cells. The size of the dTTP pool also increased. In Fig. 4 B (deoxycytidine experiment) the specific activity of dCTP follows the opposite pattern; a progressive decline occurs from high values in the first fractions to a minimum in the S phase-rich fractions 4 and 5. The size of the dCTP pool increased only marginally or not at all, which differs from the behavior of the dCTP pool in the cytidine experiment (see below). In this experiment, fraction 1 also contained sufficient cells to be used for our calculations. Fraction 5, on the other hand, contained 25% G2 cells and was excluded. In Fig. 4 C (cytidine experiment) the specific activity of dCTP shows small variations and increases at most 20% from the G1 phase-rich fraction 2 to the S phase-rich fractions 3–5. Fraction 5 again contained too many G2 cells to be used for the calculations. Comparing Fig. 4, B andC, we note that the dCTP pool is more heavily labeled from deoxycytidine than from cytidine, 20 times more in fraction 2 (G1 cells), and 5 times more in fraction 5 (S phase cells), reflecting the large dilution of radioactivity in CTP by de novo synthesis from nonlabeled precursors. The size of the CTP pool did not vary between fractions 2 and 5, and its specific activity was within experimental error the same as that of dCTP, both after 60 and 120 min (data not shown). Note also that the size of the dCTP pool in the cytidine experiment was smaller than in the deoxycytidine experiment. In the latter case, the dCTP pool was expanded due to the presence of deoxycytidine in the medium. In separate experiments not involving elutriation, the addition of as little as 0.1 μm deoxycytidine to the medium of CEM cells led to a 50% expansion of the dCTP pool after 1 h (data not shown). A final difference concerning dCTP is the 3-fold increase in pool size moving from fraction 2 to 5 in Fig. 4 C, demonstrating the presence of a larger dCTP pool in S phase cells. Fig. 4 gives only data from the later time point, but similar results were found with each of the three nucleosides also at the earlier time point (data not shown). The data from the individual elutriated fractions were used to calculate the size and specific activity of dNTP pools of G1 and S phase cells. For all calculations, we used pairs of subpopulations, with one member containing a majority of G1 cells and the other a majority of S phase cells. Subpopulations with more than 8% G2 cells were excluded. Table II uses the data from the thymidine experiment for such a calculation. A comparison of the results obtained from the two combinations of pairs shows good agreement for S phase cells but larger variations for G1 cells. It is, however, evident that the specific activity of dTTP is approximately 10 times higher in S phase than in G1, both after 30 and 60 min. This result agrees with the well known S phase specificity of thymidine kinase. It is also clear that the pool had not yet reached a steady state after 30 min, since its specific activity was 50% higher after 60 min. This, together with the low specific activity of the pool shows that CEM cells phophorylate thymidine poorly compared with 3T6 (10Nicander B. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5376-5381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or 3T3 cells (26Spyrou G. Reichard P. Mutation Res. 1988; 200: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The pool size of dTTP is 2.5–3.5-fold larger in S phase than in G1. In the nonseparated cycling cells, most of dTTP is therefore present in S phase cells. As a consequence, the specific activity of dTTP in cycling cells is close to"

A series of truncated and hybrid proteins were constructed and analyzed within a family of PKS subunits, designated aromatases/cyclases (ARO/CYCs).

Polyketides, a large family of structurally diverse natural products, possess a broad range of biological activities, including antibiotic and pharmacological properties. These natural products are produced by a number of different bacteria and fungi that express enzyme complexes known as polyketide synthases (PKSs). 1The abbreviations used are: PKS, polyketide synthase; ARO/CYC, aromatase/cyclase; KR, ketoreductase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. Biosynthetic and molecular genetic studies have demonstrated that PKSs are structurally and mechanistically related to fatty acid synthases. Both classes of synthases are multifunctional enzymes that catalyze repeated decarboxylative condensations between acylthioesters (usually acetyl, propionyl, malonyl, or methylmalonyl). Unlike typical fatty acid synthases, PKSs introduce structural variability into the product by varying the extent of a reductive cycle comprising of a ketoreduction, dehydration, and enoylreduction on each β-keto group of the polyketide chain. Furthermore, PKSs also control chain folding by catalyzing one or more regiospecific cyclizations in the nascent polyketide chain (1Hutchinson C.R. Fujii I. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 201-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 2Hopwood D.A. Sherman D.H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 37-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3O'Hagan D.

Inspired by the structural diversity and pharmaceutical relevance of these products, the molecular recognition features of PKSs have been targets of intensive analysis and manipulation via genetic engineering. The recent development of a host vector system in Streptomyces coelicolor enabled the efficient construction and expression of recombinant PKSs (9McDaniel R. Ebert-Khosla S. Hopwood D.A. Khosla C.

In the process a series of heuristics have been proposed and used to engineer recombinant PKS gene clusters to generate novel polyketides in a predictive manner (17McDaniel R. Ebert-Khosla S. Hopwood D.A. Khosla C. Nature. 1995; 375: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 19Kramer P.J. Zawada R.J.X. McDaniel R. Hutchinson C.R. Hopwood D.A. Khosla C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 635-639Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, even with this design capability, our understanding of the mechanisms by which aromatic PKSs control their molecular recognition features is extremely limited and remains hampered by the absence of structural information on these protein complexes. The situation could potentially be ameliorated by taking advantage of the existence of numerous allelic forms of every PKS subunit, each of which shares a high degree of sequence similarity with the others (1Hutchinson C.R. Fujii I. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 201-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Here we used sequence comparisons to design and study a series of truncated and fusion proteins. Each aromatic PKS (for example, see Fig. 1) contains a set of three essential subunits referred to as the minimal PKS (15McDaniel R. Ebert-Khosla S. Fu H. Hopwood D.A. Khosla C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11542-11546Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In addition, most aromatic PKSs also include auxiliary subunits such as a ketoreductase (KR), an aromatase/cyclase (ARO/CYC), and other cyclases. ARO/CYCs are a particularly interesting family of subunits, since they exhibit the following features: (a) They occur in two architectural forms. Members of one subset, hereafter referred to as didomain ARO/CYCs, consist of ∼300 amino acid residues; whereas members of the other subset, the monodomain ARO/CYCs, consist of ∼150 residues. The N-terminal halves of didomain ARO/CYCs exhibit a high degree of sequence similarity to the monodomain proteins (20Sherman D.H. Bibb M.J. Simpson T.J. Johnson D. Malpartida F.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1810-1820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to a lesser extent to their C-terminal halves (22Bibb M.J. Sherman D.H. Omura S. Hopwood D.A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 142: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) (Fig.3). (b) Didomain ARO/CYCs catalyze the aromatization of the first six-membered carbocyclic ring derived from polyketide backbones that have undergone a C-9 reduction (Fig.2) (16McDaniel R. Ebert-Khosla S. Hopwood D.A. Khosla C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 10855-10859Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). (c) Monodomain ARO/CYCs alter the folding pattern of the nascent polyketide backbone by catalyzing a C-9/C-14 aldol condensation instead of the more typical C-7/C-12 condensation (18McDaniel R. Hutchinson C.R. Khosla C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 6805-6810Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 23Shen B. Summers R.G. Wendtpienkowski E. Hutchinson C.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 6811-6821Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Additionally, they have also been implicated to possess aromatase activity (18McDaniel R. Hutchinson C.R. Khosla C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 6805-6810Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). (d) Didomain ARO/CYCs exhibit a hierarchy with respect to their substrate specificity for polyketides of different chain lengths (17McDaniel R. Ebert-Khosla S. Hopwood D.A. Khosla C. Nature. 1995; 375: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). For example, an ARO/CYC from a decaketide synthase (e.g. the griseusin (gris) PKS) catalyzes aromatization of octaketide, nonaketide, or decaketide substrates, whereas an octaketide ARO/CYC (e.g. the actinorhodin (act) ARO/CYC) only recognizes octaketide substrates.Figure 1Proposed biosynthetic pathway catalyzed by the actinorhodin (act) PKS (biosynthetic intermediates are purely hypothetical). After biosynthesis of the full polyketide chain by the “minimal” PKS, which includes a ketosynthase/putative acyl transferase (KS/AT), chain length factor (CLF), and acyl carrier protein (ACP), the nascent octaketide chain undergoes ketoreduction (catalyzed by the KR), aromatization of the first ring (catalyzed by the didomain ARO/CYC), and a second cyclization (catalyzed by the second ring cyclase (CYC2)). In the absence of some of these subunits, shunt products are produced.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3“Domain” sequence alignments of the actinorhodin (act) and griseusin (gris) didomain ARO/CYCs and the tetracenomycin (tcm) monodomain ARO/CYC.

Likewise, the N-terminal domain of the gris ARO/CYC consisted of residues 1–148, and the C-terminal domain consisted of residues 149–320. The monodomain portion of tcmN was defined as residues 1–169, as in an earlier study (21Summers R.G. Wendt-Pienkowski E. Motamedi H. Hutchinson C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1810-1820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All segments were amplified with the following designed sequences (5′ to 3′): aPstI restriction site, a ribosome binding site (AGGAGGA), anNdeI restriction site overlapping the start codon, the natural coding sequence, a stop codon, and an EcoRI restriction site. 5′ segments also included an NdeI restriction site immediately upstream of the stop codon. Thus, each fragment represented a gene by itself. In addition, wild-type or hybrid genes could be constructed by fusing different 5′ and 3′ fragments together at the NdeI site. In turn, these genes were inserted into either pSEK21 (which carries the act minimal PKS and theact ketoreductase) or pSEK23 (which carries thetcm minimal PKS and the act ketoreductase) immediately downstream of the minimal PKS gene set as described previously (15McDaniel R.

The structure determination of RZ53 (compound 7, 15 mg/liter in CH999/pRZ53 cultures) is described here. To evaluate the function of the N- and C-terminal halves of the didomain ARO/CYCs and to test whether they do indeed fold into separate domains, recombinant gene clusters were constructed in which the putative domains of the act and gris ARO/CYCs were expressed as separate polypeptides in conjunction with either theact (octaketide producer) or tcm (decaketide producer) minimal PKS and the act KR (TableI). Earlier studies have established that the presence of SEK34 (2) or SEK43 (6) are indicative of the existence of first ring aromatase activity in a 16- or 20-carbon polyketide producing strain respectively (16McDaniel R. Ebert-Khosla S. Hopwood D.A. Khosla C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 10855-10859Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 17McDaniel R. Ebert-Khosla S. Hopwood D.A. Khosla C. Nature. 1995; 375: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Neither the N-terminal (CH999/pRZ50, pRZ77, and pRZ78) nor the C-terminal (CH999/pRZ51, pRZ73, and pRZ74) domains of the act orgris ARO/CYC showed substantial aromatase activity when expressed alone. The extract from CH999/pRZ50 (N-terminal domain ofact ARO/CYC) exhibited an HPLC peak characteristic for SEK34, but the product yields were inadequate for NMR analysis. Anin vitro assay with 14C-labeled malonyl CoA of this strain also supported the production of SEK34. 2R. J. X. Zawada and C. Khosla, unpublished observation. (Unexpectedly, the grisC-terminal domain alone led to the formation of a novel product, RZ53 (7) (see below).) However, when the N- and C-terminal domains were co-expressed as separate polypeptides (CH999/pRZ64, pRZ79, and pRZ80), SEK34 (2) was produced by CH999/pRZ64 and pRZ79, whereas SEK43 (6) was produced by CH999/pRZ80, suggesting that the domains can associate productively with themselves and/or the PKS complex. It should be noted that the biosynthesis of comparable amounts of mutactin by CH999/pRZ64 and RM20b by CH999/pRZ80 implies that domain disconnection leads to only partial aromatase activity in these two strains. As summarized above, didomain ARO/CYCs exhibit an interesting hierarchy with respect to their recognition of polyketide chain length. To dissect the structural basis for this property, a set of recombinant PKS gene clusters containing hybrid genes derived from the act and gris ARO/CYCs was constructed. The results described in Table II show that ARO/CYC proteins containing the N-terminal domain of the gris subunit (CH999/pRZ54, pRZ55, and pRZ61) catalyzed the aromatization of both octaketide and decaketide substrates. In contrast, those containing the N-terminal domain of the act subunit (CH999/pRZ52, pRZ53, and pRZ71) recognized only octaketide subunits. Thus, chain length recognition appears to reside exclusively within the N-terminal domain of didomain ARO/CYCs. As mentioned above, the N-terminal domains of the didomain ARO/CYCs exhibit significant sequence similarity to the monodomain ARO/CYCs, which suggested that the monodomain ARO/CYC may be able to replace the N-terminal domain. To investigate this hypothesis, hybrid proteins where the monodomain ARO/CYC portion of thetcmN protein was inserted in place of the N-terminal domain of the act and gris ARO/CYCs were constructed. As summarized in Table III, none of these hybrids displayed functional didomain ARO/CYC activity, indicating that the monodomain ARO/CYCs cannot substitute for the N-terminal domain of the didomain ARO/CYCs. During the course of the above studies it was observed that, although the C-terminal domain of the gris ARO/CYC could not catalyze first ring aromatization by itself, its co-expression with thetcm minimal PKS and the act ketoreductase (CH999/pRZ74) led to the production of a relatively abundant new metabolite that was not formed in the presence of the grisN-terminal domain alone (CH999/pRZ78) or the act N- or C-terminal domains alone (CH999/pRZ50 and pRZ51, respectively). Indeed, production of this metabolite was also observed in strains containing the act/gris and tcm/grishybrid proteins (CH999/pRZ53 and pRZ65, respectively). Likewise, because this metabolite was also produced by CH999/pRZ80, which contains partial aromatase activity, but not in CH999/pRZ61, which exhibits full aromatase activity, its production is the result of the presence of the gris C-terminal domain in a context, where it is unable to participate in first ring aromatase activity. (Upon more sensitive analysis, this new metabolite was also observed in strains CH999/pRZ71 and pRZ57 (>1 wt% of total polyketide products); however, its production levels in these strains were more than an order of magnitude lower than the production levels in their counterpart strains, CH999/pRZ53 and pRZ65 (∼10 wt% of total polyketide products), respectively.) The structure of this new metabolite, designated RZ53 (7) (Fig. 4), was solved using a combination of NMR (TableIV), mass spectroscopy, and isotope labeling analysis. The chemical shifts were remarkably similar to those of corresponding atoms in RM20 (3) (9McDaniel R. Ebert-Khosla S. Hopwood D.A. Khosla C. Science. 1993; 262: 1546-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) except for the absence of a methylene and a carbonyl signal. Sodium [1,2-13C]acetate feeding experiments confirmed that the carbon chain of RZ53 was derived from nine acetate units. The coupling constants calculated from the13C NMR spectrum of the enriched RZ53 sample also facilitated peak assignment. High resolution fast atom bombardment gave a molecular weight of 282.0897, which is consistent with C17H14O4 MW (282.0892). Thus, RZ53, a novel “unnatural” natural product, is the first known nonaketide to be produced by the tcm PKS.Table IV1 H (400 MHz) and 13 C (100 MHz) NMR data from RZ53 (7)Carbon4-aCarbons are labeled according to their number in the polyketide backbone (Fig. 4).13C δJcc1H δ (m, J HH(Hz), area)ppmHzppm219.12.12 (s, 3H)3152.875.44104.776.56.22 (s, 1H)5129.960.86116.061.46.88 (d, 7.0, 1H)7132.357.97.48 (dd, 8.0, 8.0, 1H)8121.557.58.96 (d, 8.6, 1H)9132.952.210117.654.811159.074.61299.274.36.42 (s, 1H)13163.363.814106.762.615191.339.31649.639.72.66 (d, 16, 1H)17101.945.97.131827.645.81.61 (s, 3H)4-a Carbons are labeled according to their number in the polyketide backbone (Fig. 4). Open table in a new tab Without any direct insight into their structures, some cognizance into the structural basis of several properties of the didomain ARO/CYC has been acquired via domain truncation and replacement. Our studies demonstrate that the N-terminal domain is responsible for the variability observed in the polyketide chain length recognition by the ARO/CYC. This variability could either arise due to differences in the substrate binding pockets of individual subunits, or it may reflect differential affinities for the minimal PKS subunits themselves. Given the availability of cell-free systems for polyketide biosynthesis (28Pieper R. Luo G. Cane D.E. Khosla C. Nature. 1995; 378: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar,29Carreras C.W. Pieper R. Khosla C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5158-5159Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), further in vitro analysis could shed light on this question. In the course of these studies, we also obtained structural insights into yet another interesting attribute of these enzymes, their ability to influence the chain length specificity of the minimal PKS within a window of one acetate unit. Specifically, we have established that it is the C-terminal domain of the didomain ARO/CYC that is responsible for this trait. This is not the first report of auxilary subunits influencing the chain length specificity of the minimal PKS. Recent studies of the frenolicin (fren) PKS showed that both theact KR and tcmN can modulate the relative distribution of 16-carbon and 18-carbon polyketide products (19Kramer P.J. Zawada R.J.X. McDaniel R. Hutchinson C.R. Hopwood D.A. Khosla C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 635-639Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A similar phenomenon has also been reported in the case of thewhiE PKS (30Yu, T. W. (1995) Physical and Functional Studies of Polyketide Synthesis Genes of Streptomyces. Ph.D. Thesis, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK.Google Scholar), which produces 22-carbon and 24-carbon backbones. However, until now it has been assumed that these observations are peculiar to PKSs that exhibit relaxed chain length specificity in nature, because at least the frenolicin producer,S. roseofulvus, is known to produce both 16- and 18-carbon natural products with very similar structures (31Iwai Y. Kora A. Takahashi Y. Hayashi T. Awaya J. Masuma R. Oiwa R. Omura S. J. Antibiot. 1978; 31: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 32Tsuzuki K. Iwai Y. Omura S. J. Antibiot. 1986; 39: 1343-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In contrast, neither the naturally occurring PKS from S. glaucescens nor any engineered PKS containing the core tcm subunits has yielded an 18-carbon product thus far. Our new findings therefore provide the clearest evidence that certain auxiliary PKS subunits can not only control the folding, reduction, and aromatization of the nascent chain but can also secondarily influence the chain length of the final product by plus or minus one acetate unit. The hypothesized didomain nature of the act andgris ARO/CYCs (22Bibb M.J. Sherman D.H. Omura S. Hopwood D.A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 142: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) was verified by expressing the proposed domains as separate proteins and demonstrating that they can associate productively to manifest the properties attributed to an intact didomain ARO/CYC. However, because neither domain exhibited significant aromatase activity when expressed alone, it appears that both domains must work in concert to aromatize the first ring. Furthermore, fusion proteins between the monodomain ARO/CYC portion of tcmN and the C-terminal domains of the act or the grisARO/CYC disclosed that although there is good sequence homology between monodomain ARO/CYCs and N-terminal domains, monodomain ARO/CYCs are incapable of executing the role(s) of the N-terminal domain in the aromatization of the reduced first ring. In summary, the utility of deletion and domain swapping analysis between different alleles of the aromatic PKS subunits has been demonstrated. In conjunction with in vitro studies, higher resolution gene shuffling should yield further insights into the mechanistic basis for ARO/CYC function and specificity and may even give rise to additional ARO/CYC subunits with novel properties."

Only treatment of hepatocytes with interleukin-1β (IL-1) was effective, resulting in a marked decrease in GSTs. Steady-state mRNA levels of rGSTA2 and M1 were strongly down-regulated by IL-1 in a dose-dependent manner after a 24-h exposure while rGSTP1 mRNA level was increased by a 48-h treatment. Similar effects of IL-1 were observed at the protein level. The response to IL-1 appeared to be specific for each subunit within GST gene families. In addition, IL-1 strongly suppressed the induction of rGSTA2 by 3-methylcholanthrene, oltipraz (a synthetic derivative of 1,2-dithiole-3-thione), and phenobarbital and that of rGSTM1 by oltipraz and phenobarbital, whereas it was ineffective on rGSTP1 induction by these compounds. Using in vitro nuclear run-on transcription assay and Northern blot analysis of α-amanitin-treated cells, IL-1-mediated rGSTM1 mRNA decrease was found to result from mRNA destabilization. These results provide the first demonstration that IL-1 regulates some major GST subunits in hepatocytes by a post-transcriptional mechanism.

Steady-state mRNA levels of rGSTA2 and M1 were strongly down-regulated by IL-1 in a dose-dependent manner after a 24-h exposure while rGSTP1 mRNA level was increased by a 48-h treatment. Similar effects of IL-1 were observed at the protein level. The response to IL-1 appeared to be specific for each subunit within GST gene families. In addition, IL-1 strongly suppressed the induction of rGSTA2 by 3-methylcholanthrene, oltipraz (a synthetic derivative of 1,2-dithiole-3-thione), and phenobarbital and that of rGSTM1 by oltipraz and phenobarbital, whereas it was ineffective on rGSTP1 induction by these compounds. Using in vitro nuclear run-on transcription assay and Northern blot analysis of α-amanitin-treated cells, IL-1-mediated rGSTM1 mRNA decrease was found to result from mRNA destabilization. These results provide the first demonstration that IL-1 regulates some major GST subunits in hepatocytes by a post-transcriptional mechanism. The response of organisms to inflammation and infection is characterized by a number of changes that include release of proinflammatory cytokines, increased secretion of some plasma proteins in the liver, referred to as acute phase proteins (1Bauman H. Gauldie J. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 74-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), and impairment of drug metabolism capacity (2Andus T. Bauer J. Gerok W. Hepatology. 1991; 13: 364-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 3Renton K.W. Caldwell J. Jacoby W.B. Biological Basis of Detoxication. Academic Press, New York1983: 307-324Crossref Google Scholar). Several in vivo andin vitro studies have shown that administration of proinflammatory cytokines results in the decrease of hepatic drug metabolism and various cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 1The abbreviations used are: CYP, cytochrome P-450; CDNB, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene; DCNB, 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene; GST,: glutathioneS-transferase; HPLC: high performance liquid chromatography; IFNα, interferon α IL, interleukin; MC, 3-methylcholanthrene; OPZ, oltipraz; PB, phenobarbital; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TGFβ, transforming growth factor β TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α. -related activities (4Renton K.W.

Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 707-715PubMed Google Scholar). The detoxication of many drugs and carcinogens is due to the combined effects of mixed function oxygenation, brought about mainly by the CYPs and conjugation of the oxidized products by enzymes such as the glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), NADPH:quinone oxido-reductase, epoxide hydrolases, sulfotransferases, and UDP-glucuronyl-transferases (6Williams R.T. Fed. Proc. 1967; 26: 1029-1039PubMed Google Scholar). Little is known about the effects of cytokines on conjugating enzymes. We are chiefly concerned with the GSTs that catalyze the conjugation of glutathione to a wide range of electrophiles and thus play a key role in the protection of cells from toxic and carcinogenic electrophiles as well as from lipid hydroperoxides generated by an oxidative stress (7Mosialou E. Elkstrôm G. Adang A.E.P. Morgenstern R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 1645-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). GSTs belong to a supergene family consisting of four main multigene families,i.e. alpha, mu, pi, and theta (8Mannervik B. Danielson U.H. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 23: 283-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar). In the rat, the GST alpha class is composed of subunits A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5; the GST mu class contains subunits M1, M2, M3, M5, and M6;, the GST pi is represented only by subunit P1; and GST theta class comprises subunits T1, T2, and T3 (9Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3267) Google Scholar). The level of expression of GSTs is a crucial factor in determining the sensitivity of cells to a broad spectrum of toxic chemicals, and induction of GSTs by environmental compounds (drugs or diet) is thought to represent an important mechanism of protection against carcinogens in rodents (10Kensler T.W. Egner P.A. Dolan P.M. Groopman J.D. Roebuck B.D. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 4271-4277PubMed Google Scholar). The present study was conducted to determine whether several cytokines, used at a concentration known to affect plasma protein patterns and CYPs, could modulate the constitutive and inducible expression of GSTs. To investigate the effects of different cytokines (IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, interferon (IFN) α and γ, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)) separately, we used rat hepatocytes in primary culture in the absence or presence of these cytokines and analyzed the expression of rat GST subunits at both the mRNA and protein levels. We present the first evidence that IL-1, a major proinflammatory cytokine, regulates some subunits of different classes of GSTs. Because the levels of GSTs in the organism may determine the potential for detoxication of xenobiotics, it is important to analyze the effects of both positive and negative regulators of GST gene expression. Besides health status, exogenous chemicals may greatly influence GST-mediated drug detoxication capacity of the liver. As observed for CYPs (5Abdel-Razzak Z. Loyer P. Fautrel A. Gautier J.C.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we found that IL-1 decreased induction of some GST subunits by 3-methylcholanthrene (MC, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon), phenobarbital (PB, a barbiturate), and oltipraz (OPZ, a synthetic derivative of 1,2-dithiole-3-thione). Human recombinant IL-1, IL-6, TNFα, IFNα, and recombinant mouse IL-2 were purchased from Genzyme (Cambridge, UK). Rat IL-4 was from Immungenex (Los Angeles, CA). Human recombinant IFNγ was kindly provided by Roussel Uclaf (Romainville, France). Platelet-derived human TGFβ was purchased from British Biotech (Oxon, UK). Culture media and fetal calf serum were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Paisley, UK). Collagenase, MC, PB, bovine serum albumin, and bovine insulin were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). OPZ was kindly supplied by Dr G. Jolles (Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Antony, France). All other compounds were readily available commercial products. Adult hepatocytes were obtained after perfusion of male rat (Sprague-Dawley, 150–200 g) liver with a collagenase solution as described previously (13Guguen C. Guillouzo A. Boisnard M. Le Cam A. Bourel M. Biol. Gastro-Enterol. 1975; 8: 223-231PubMed Google Scholar). Cell viability was estimated by the trypan blue exclusion test and was found to range between 85 and 90%. Cells were seeded at a density of 107/80-cm2 flask in 10 ml of standard medium consisting of 75% minimum essential medium and 25% medium 199, containing 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 μg/ml bovine insulin, and 10% fetal calf serum. 4 h after hepatocyte seeding, serum-free medium containing 1 μm hydrocortisone hemisuccinate and 10 mm nicotinamide was added to the cultures. The medium was then changed daily. The cytokines were added to culture media at the following concentrations: IL-1, 100 units/ml; IL-2, 5 ng/ml; IL-4, 5 ng/ml; IL-6, 50 units/ml; IL-10, 50 units/ml; IFN α and γ, 50 units/ml; TNFα, 50 units/ml; and TGFβ, 0.1 ng/ml. All these recombinant cytokines were known to be effective on CYP expression and/or acute-phase protein production in rat hepatocyte primary cultures (5Abdel-Razzak Z. Loyer P. Fautrel A. Gautier J.C. Corcos L. Turlin B. Beaune P. Guillouzo A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 707-715PubMed Google Scholar, 14Guillouzo A. Loyer P. Abdel-Razzak Z. Delers F. Fautrel A. Guguen-Guillouzo C. Clement B. Guillouzo A. Cellular and Molecular Aspects of Cirrhosis. 216. Les Editions INSERM, Paris1992: 61-67Google Scholar). The cytokines and the three xenobiotic inducers (PB, MC, and OPZ) were added 24 h after cell seeding and at each daily renewal of the culture medium. MC and OPZ were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide before addition to the culture medium at the final concentration of either 5 μmMC or 50 μm OPZ in 0.2% dimethyl sulfoxide (v/v). PB was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 3.2 mm. Control cultures received the same concentration of vehicle. GST activities were determined in cell lysates as described by Habig and Jakoby (15Habig W.H. Jacoby W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 218-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) with adaptation for a centrifugal analyzer (COBAS BIO) using the following substrates: 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), a substrate for most GST subunits, and 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene (DCNB), a substrate mainly for rGSTM1. All these activities were related to total cellular or cytosolic proteins determined by the method of Bradford (16Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) adapted for use on a centrifugal analyzer. Hepatocyte monolayers were washed with 0.1 m PBS. Total RNA was extracted by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (17Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). 10 μg of total RNAs were subjected to electrophoresis in a denaturing 6% (v/v) formaldehyde, 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel, and transferred onto hybond-N nylon filters (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL). For dot blots, dilutions of each RNA sample in a denaturing buffer (3 × SSC, 2.2 mformaldehyde) were absorbed onto hybond-N nylon membranes by suction. The integrity and relative amounts of RNA were assessed by methylene blue staining of the membrane. Prehybridization and hybridization were performed according to Church and Gilbert (18Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar). Membranes were washed with 3 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min and then twice with 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 10 min. Rat GSTA2-, A3-, A4-, M1-, and T1-specific cDNA probes were generated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using total RNA isolated from rat liver. The amplified cDNAs corresponding to highly divergent sequences of the rat GST genes were located between nucleotides 602 and 746, 602 and 786, 704 and 953, 474 and 711, and 176 and 243, for rGSTA2, A3, M1, A4 and T1, respectively. Sequencing of the GST cDNA products obtained demonstrated identity to the corresponding rat GST sequences previously published (19Telakowski-Hopkins C.A. Rothkopf G.S. Pickett C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 83: 9393-9397Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 20Ding G.J.-F. Lu A.Y.H. Pickett C.B. J. Biol.

Since JT9L (a rat GSTM2 cDNA) might cross-hybridize with mRNA encoding subunit M1 (the other major mu class subunit), it was digested by EcoRI andEcoRV to obtain a more specific fragment of subunit M2 cDNA sequence. cDNA probes were 32P-labeled by random priming using a Rediprime DNA labeling system (Amersham). An oligonucleotide specific for the 18 S ribosomal RNA was32P-labeled and used as control, as described previously (23Chan Y.-L. Gutell R. Noller H.F. Wool I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 224-230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Relative mRNA amounts were determined by densitometry and integration of unsatured signals (Densylab, Microvision Instruments, Evry, France). The cytosolic GST fraction was prepared from hepatocytes at 4 °C according to the method of Kispert et al. (24Kispert A. Meyer D.J. Lalor E. Coles B. Ketterer B. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 789-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were homogenized in buffer A (150 mm KCl, 50 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0). Samples were applied directly to a column ofS-linked glutathione-agarose equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A, and the GSTs were then eluted with buffer B (5 mm glutathione and 5 mmhexyl-glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.1). The GST subunit composition was determined by reverse-phase HPLC using a 12-μm particle size column (Rainin Instrument Co., Inc., Woburn. MA) and a flow rate of 1 ml/min. GST subunits were quantified from the absorbance at 240 nm (25Meyer D.J. Harris J.M. Gilmore K.S. Coles B. Kensler T.W. Ketterer B. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). One hundred million hepatocytes were rinsed with PBS, and the cells were scraped off by using ice-cold PBS. Nuclei were prepared essentially as described by Shapiro (26Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W.W. Keller M. DNA ( N. Y. ). 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) except that they were purified on a 2 m sucrose cushion. Briefly, the nuclear pellet resuspended in 2 m sucrose was layered on a 2 m sucrose cushion and then centrifuged at 40,000 rpm in an SW41 rotor at 4 °C for 1 h. Nuclear run-on transcription was assayed as described by Antras-Ferry et al. (27Antras-Ferry J. Robin P. Robin D. Forest C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). About 50 × 106 cpm were hybridized per membrane. Specific probes used were β-actin, albumin and rGSTA2, M1, and P1. The aspecific signal was detected by hybridization to the pGEM plasmid. Numerical values are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Student's t test was used. Significance was set at a limit of < 5% for the test. The specific sets of comparisons are described in the legends of the figures. The effects of IL-1 (100 units/ml), IL-2 (5 ng/ml), IL-4 (5 ng/ml), IL-6 (50 units/ml), IL-10 (50 units/ml), IFN α and γ (50 units/ml), TNFα (50 units/ml), and TGFβ (0.1 ng/ml) were investigated on GST activities of primary rat hepatocytes. At the concentrations used, none of the cytokines was cytotoxic regardless of the experimental condition. Activities measured with CDNB, a substrate for most GSTs, or DCNB, a substrate for rGSTM1, were decreased in the presence of IL-1 in the medium while these activities remained unaffected in the presence of other cytokines (Fig. 1). In the presence of IL-1, GST activities measured with CDNB were 66 and 53% of control values at 48 and 72 h, respectively (p < 0.01). The DCNB activity decreased to 22 and 28% of corresponding controls after 48 and 72 h of treatment, respectively (p < 0.01). To determine the mechanism involved in the decrease of GST activity by IL-1, we analyzed the expression of several GST subunits in the absence or presence of 100 units/ml IL-1 after 8, 12, and 24 h of treatment. The steady-state mRNA levels were measured by Northern analysis or dot blotting and hybridization with specific cDNA probes for rGSTA2, A3, and A4 (α class), M1 and M2 (μ class), P1 (π class) and T1 (θ class). A strong decrease of rGSTA2 and M1 mRNA levels was observed after 12 h of treatment with IL-1 and maintained at 24 h (17 and 27% of control values at 24 h,p < 0.001) (Fig. 2). No effect of IL-1 on rGSTP1 mRNA was evidenced before 48 h of treatment. The mRNA levels of the other GST subunits were unaffected by this treatment (data not shown). To determine whether IL-1 acted in a dose-dependent manner, we treated hepatocyte cultures with the following three different concentrations of IL-1: 20, 100, and 300 units/ml (Fig.3). The dose-response analysis was performed after 24 h of treatment for mRNAs encoding rGSTA2 and M1 and after 48 h of treatment for the mRNA encoding rGSTP1. 24 h after cell seeding, the basal expression of rGSTA2 and M1 mRNAs was decreased in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of IL-1. IL-1 already had an inhibitory effect on rGSTA2 and M1 mRNAs at the lowest concentration (20 units/ml). When compared with corresponding controls, IL-1 at 20 units/ml caused a 4- and 3-fold decrease of rGSTA2 and M1 mRNAs, respectively. In contrast, after 48 h of treatment, the expression of rGSTP1 transcripts was increased by 6-fold with 20 units/ml IL-1 and 13-fold with 100 units/ml. Quantitative analysis of individual subunits was made possible by HPLC (Fig.4). Hepatocytes treated by 100 units/ml IL-1 for 72 h were compared with their control counterparts. As observed for mRNAs, IL-1 caused an important decrease (44%) in rGSTM1 protein while the levels of other subunits were unchanged. To determine the effect of IL-1 on GST mRNA induction by xenobiotics, accumulation levels of rGSTA2, M1, and P1 mRNA were determined following 24, 48, and 72 h of treatment with MC, OPZ, or PB in the absence or presence of the cytokine. Results from one of four hybridization experiments are shown in Fig. 5 A. The three types of inducers increased mRNA levels of rGSTA2 and P1 while only OPZ and PB increased rGSTM1 mRNA levels. Statistical analyses showed significant differences in GST expression in cells treated for 48 h with xenobiotics as compared with cells treated with both inducers and IL-1. In OPZ-treated hepatocytes, incubation with IL-1 resulted in a 47 and 45% decrease of the steady-state mRNA levels for rGSTA2 and M1, respectively (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5 B). PB induction of rGSTA2 mRNAs was decreased by 36% in the presence of IL-1 (although the effect was not significant throughout the four experiments p < 0.068). PB induction of rGSTM1 was decreased by 41% (p < 0.05). The effect of IL-1 on MC-induced rGSTA2 was not significant but showed a trend toward a decrease (p < 0.078). The cytokine was uneffective on rGSTP1 mRNA induction by the xenobiotics. The effect of IL-1 on the inducible expression of GSTs was confirmed by HPLC (Fig. 6). IL-1 blocked induction of rGSTM1 by OPZ and PB at 72 h while that of rGSTP1 was unaffected. To determine whether changes in steady-state mRNA levels of rGSTA2, M1, and P1 by IL-1 were due to changes in the rate of gene transcription, nuclear run-on assays were performed with nuclei from IL-1-treated hepatocytes. Dot blots representative of the transcriptional activity are shown in Fig.7. A 12-h exposure of hepatocytes to 100 units/ml of IL-1 was uneffective on either GST gene transcription. As expected, albumin gene transcription was reduced with IL-1 treatment. In contrast, rGSTA2 and rGSTP1 gene transcription was increased after 4 h of treatment with MC and OPZ and after 12 h of treatment with PB. As observed for the basal levels of rGSTA2, M1, and P1 gene transcription, concomitant treatment with IL-1 failed to antagonize the transcriptional activation brought about by MC and OPZ after 4 h and by PB after 12 h of treatment (data not shown). Actin gene transcription rate, included as a control, was not affected by these treatments. These observations suggested that the regulation of GST expression by IL-1 could be the consequence of a change in the mRNA stability rather than in the rate of gene transcription. To demonstrate a post-transcriptional regulation of rGSTM1 mRNA by IL-1, the level of this mRNA was determined in control and IL-1-treated cells in the presence of α-amanitin (Fig. 8). 48 h after seeding, cells were treated for 28 h with α-amanitin (2 μg/ml) in the absence or presence of 100 units/ml IL-1. Under these conditions, α-amanitin did not appear to be cytotoxic to the cells since no morphological alteration of the cultures was detected by light microscopic examination. At various time intervals, total RNA was prepared and analyzed by Northern blot. The mRNA half-life was determined from the slope of the semilogarithmic plot of mRNA band intensity versus time. The decay of rGSTM1 mRNA level in IL-1-treated cells was considerably faster than that of control cells. In cells exposed to α-amanitin, the rGSTM1 RNA exhibited a half-life superior to 30 h versus 15–20 h in cells treated with both α-amanitin and IL-1. These observations strongly suggest that IL-1 enhances the degradation of this transcript. Regulation of GSTs by cytokines has still received limited attention. Only an increase of hGSTA1 and A2 by IL-4 in human hepatocytes (28Langouët S. Corcos L. Abdel-Razzak Z. Loyer P. Ketterer B. Guillouzo A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 793-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and a significant suppression of some GST subunits by IFNα/β in the mouse liver have been reported (29Adams D.J. Balkwill F.R. Griffin D.B. Hayes J.D. Lewis A.D. Wolf C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4888-4892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we provide the first evidence that IL-1 can directly affect the expression of some major GST genes in rodent hepatocytes. In addition, we demonstrate that the response of each GST subunit to IL-1 is highly specific within gene families. IL-1 is known to down-regulate the constitutive expression of several genes such as albumin, lipoprotein lipase, and CYPs but, in most cases, IL-1 stimulates the expression of a variety of other genes including acute-phase ones (30Dinarello C.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1314-1325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This cytokine regulates most of the genes by a transcriptional mechanism involving members of the C/EBP family, HNF1, AP1, and NF-κB transcription factors (31Muegge K. Williams T.M. Kant J. Karin M. Chiu R. Schmidt A. Siebenlist U. Young H.A. Durum S. Science. 1989; 24: 249-251Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 32Baumann H. Morella K.K. Campos S.P. Cao Z. Jahreis G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19744-19751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Croston G.E. Cao Z. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16514-16517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, IL-1 signal transduction pathways in hepatocytes are still unknown. We bring here the first demonstration that the GST regulation by IL-1 is controlled predominantly by a post-transcriptional mechanism. This conclusion is based on comparison of steady-state mRNA levels of rGSTA2, M1, and P1 with the transcription rates of their respective genes. Our results show that, despite variations in mRNA contents in response to IL-1, the transcription rates of these genes remained unchanged. The action of IL-1 on steady-state mRNA levels observed only after 12 h of treatment and the rGSTM1 decrease in experiments using α-amanitin are important arguments favoring the idea that this cytokine primarily acts at the post-transcriptional level on GST mRNA stability. There was no previous report showing that GSTs can be regulated by similar mechanisms except for hGSTP1 mRNA half-life, which was increased by ethacrynic acid in human colon carcinoma cell lines (34Morrow C.S. Chiu J. Cowan K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10544-10550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Little is known about how IL-1 might decrease mRNA half-life. One could suggest that IL-1 decreases the stability of rGSTA2 and M1 by altering the activity or cellular content of specific factors involved in their mRNA stability. Such a post-transcriptional mechanism has been demonstrated in synovial fibroblasts for the regulation of collagenase mRNA by IL-1 (35Vincenti M.P. Coon C.I. Lee O. Binkerhoff C.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4818-4827Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, in this case, this cytokine increased the stability of this transcript by reversing the destabilizing effects of sequences located in the 3′-untranslated regions. Further investigations of the 3′-untranslated regions of rGSTA2 and M1 mRNAs should inform on the presence of sequences possibly involved in the regulation of these transcripts by IL-1. Other studies reported a post-transcriptional down-regulation of ferritin and C-reactive protein by IL-1, as a consequence of reduced mRNA translation (36Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar,37Ganter G. Arcone R. Toniatti C. Morrone G. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3373-3379Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In contrast to rGSTA2 and M1, rGSTP1 is strongly up-regulated after a 48-h treatment with IL-1. The rGSTP1 is not expressed in adult rat liver but is de novo expressed in vitro (38Vandenberghe Y. Morel F. Pemble S. Taylor J.B. Rogiers V. Ratanasavanh D. Vercruysse A. Ketterer B. Guillouzo A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 372-376PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, rGSTP1 dramatically increases in hepatic preneoplasic lesions (39Pemble S.E. Taylor J.D. Ketterer B. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The increased rGSTP1 levels found in these lesions would increase the resistance of these cells to cytotoxic insults. The reason for the inducibility of liver rGSTP1 in vitro is unknown. However, since in cultured hepatocytes the reexpression of subunit P1 is inhibited by dimethyl sulfoxide (38Vandenberghe Y. Morel F. Pemble S. Taylor J.B. Rogiers V. Ratanasavanh D. Vercruysse A. Ketterer B. Guillouzo A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 372-376PubMed Google Scholar), this suggests a possible correlation between the expression and IL-1 induction of subunit P1 and its high glutathione peroxidase activity. Moreover, it was demonstrated that in cells treated with IL-1 for 24 h, there was a marked increase in the intracellular content of hydroperoxides (40Kayanoki Y. Fujii J. Suzuki K. Kawata S. Matsuzawa Y. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15488-15492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a result of an increased exposure to reactive oxygen species after IL-1 treatment, cultured hepatocytes could respond by increasing their glutathione peroxidase activity. Although many groups have investigated the effects of inducers on GST gene expression, nothing is known concerning how this process might be modulated by the physiological status of an organism. Recently, we demonstrated that rat hepatocytes in primary culture are a good model to study the effect of inducers on both GST gene expression and GST enzyme activity (41Langouët S. Morel F. Meyer D.J. Fardel O. Corcos L. Ketterer B. Guillouzo A. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated the induction of GST mRNAs and proteins by three inducers, PB, MC, and OPZ, in the presence or absence of IL-1. The results clearly demonstrate that the induction of rGSTA2 and M1 mRNAs and proteins by these inducers is dramatically reduced by IL-1. Using run-on experiments, we demonstrate that MC, OPZ, and PB rapidly activate the transcriptional activity of the rGSTA2 and P1 genes. The underlying mechanisms of induction are well known and may involve different sequences located in the 5′-flanking regions of GST genes, except for rGSTM1 which remains unexplored. Thus, the 5′-flanking region of the rGSTA2 gene contains at least two regulatory elements, a “xenobiotic responsive element” that contributes to part of the responsiveness to planar aromatic compounds such as MC (42Fujisawa A. Sogawa K. Yamana M. Fugii-Kuriyama Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 4179-4191Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and an “antioxidant-responsive element” (43Rushmore T.H. Morton M.R. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11632-11639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that has been shown to be involved in the stimulation by phenolic antioxidants and dithiolethiones such as OPZ. The decrease of rGSTA2 and M1 induction by chemicals could be explained by the shorter half-life of mRNA in the presence of IL-1 but also by an inhibition of transcriptional factors that are required for induction. However, the fact that IL-1 represses the induction of rGSTA2 by either MC or OPZ, which act mainly via the xenobiotic responsive element or the antioxidant responsive element sequence, respectively, suggests that the IL-1 blockade might be independent of the transcriptional mechanisms involved in these inductions. Moreover, our results indicate that IL-1 does not block the induced level of transcription. In addition, we show that the inhibitory effect of IL-1 appears only after 48 h. To precisely define the effect of IL-1, we performed kinetic studies on cells pretreated for 48 h with the inducers (data not shown). Under these conditions, GST expression has already reached a steady state of induced mRNA levels, but IL-1-triggered inhibition was observed after 12 h of treatment. That the IL-1 suppressive effect on GST-induced mRNA levels follows the same kinetics as on the basal mRNA levels might reflect the fact that IL-1 primarily acts on mRNA accumulation levels rather than on GST transcription. This lag in IL-1 action, in addition to the absence of effect of IL-1 on GST transcription either under basal or induced conditions, strongly supports the idea that IL-1 primarily acts on GST by a negative post-transcriptional mechanism. Finally by contrast with rGSTA2 and M1, rGSTP1 induction by xenobiotics was not affected by IL-1. Because the expression of many hepatic CYPs and several GSTs is decreased by some cytokines, studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon in vivo are of importance at both a pharmacological and a toxicological viewpoint. In addition to the production of cytokines during inflammation, some cytokines are being used as immunotherapeutic agents for the treatment of chronic inflammation (viral hepatitis B and C), cancer, and some other diseases (44Bollag W.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 56: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Since studies indicate that cytokines reduced hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes, altered therapeutic and/or toxic effects of co-administered agents might be expected. Furthermore, the modulation of carcinogen-inactivating GST expression by cytokines may bear relevance to the process of chemical carcinogenesis and may contribute to interindividual variations in cancer susceptibility. In recent years, considerable attention has been paid to the development of chemointervention strategies involving induction of GSTs (45Prochaska H.J. Santamaria A.B. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2394-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). For example, OPZ has been proposed as a good candidate for chemoprotection because of its ability to prevent against aflatoxin B1-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in the rat (9Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3267) Google Scholar). It has been assumed that aflatoxin B1 is also a human hepatocarcinogen and a powerful cocarcinogen in combination with hepatitis B virus, which is often endemic in communities exposed to aflatoxin B1 (46Yeh F.H. Yu M.C. Mo C.C. Luo C. Tong M.J. Henderson B.E. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 2506-2509PubMed Google Scholar). If our results are confirmed in cultured human hepatocytes, questions would arise about the therapeutic interest of OPZ in the context of inflammation. Because of the ability of certain cytokines to decrease CYPs and GSTs, our results support the idea that the balance between activation and detoxication of carcinogens and other chemicals can be strongly modified during the process of inflammation.

A homologous sequence 399QDCW402that occurs in the P-loops of Na+ channels was shown earlier to be important for ion gating. Mutant sodium pumps were expressed in yeast and subsequently investigated for their behavior toward ouabain, Na+, K+, and ATP. Native enzyme and D884A, D884R, D885A, D885E, or D885R mutants all bind ouabain in the presence of phosphate and Mg2+. TheK D values determined from Scatchard analysis are in the range 5–8 nm for the native enzyme and the D884A, D885E, or D885A mutants, and 15.7 ± 2.04 and 30.1 ± 4.32 nm for mutants D884R and D885R, respectively. This ouabain binding is reduced in the presence of K+ in a similar way for both native or mutant sodium pumps with relative affinities (K 0.5) for K+ ranging from 1.4 to 3.7 mm. Ouabain binding in the presence of 100 μm ATP is promoted by Na+ withK 0.5 = 1.64 ± 0.01 mm for the native enzyme and K 0.5 = 8.6 ± 1.35 mm for the D884R mutant. The K 0.5values of the two enzymes for ATP are 0.66 ± 0.16 μm and 1.1 ± 0.12 μm, respectively. Ouabain binding as a function of Na+ concentration, on the other hand, is very low for the D885R mutant, even at an ATP concentration of 2 mm. Phosphate or eosin, however, are recognized by this mutant enzyme, so that a major conformational change within the ATP-binding site appears unlikely.The inability of the D885R mutant to bind ouabain in the presence of Na+ and ATP could be explained by assuming that the M7/M8 connecting extracellular loop, which also contains the mutated amino acids, is invaginated within the plane of the plasma membrane and possibly involved in acceptance and/or release of Na+ ions coming from cytosolic areas of the protein. In this case, the placement of an additional positive charge might repel Na+ ions and interrupt their flow, thus not allowing the enzyme to assume the proper conformational state for ouabain binding. Such invaginated hydrophilic protein structures, such as the P-loops of Na+ and K+ channels, are already known and have been shown to participate in ion conduction.

Such invaginated hydrophilic protein structures, such as the P-loops of Na+ and K+ channels, are already known and have been shown to participate in ion conduction. The sodium pump from plasma membranes of animal cells is an oligomeric enzyme that consists of an α and a β subunit. The enzyme hydrolyzes ATP to actively transport Na+ ions out of the cell and K+ ions into the cell. Ouabain and other cardioactive steroids inhibit ATP hydrolysis and the transport of ions. The amino acids or the membrane spans involved in the formation of the ionophoric part of the sodium pump are not yet known although in several investigations mutations of single amino acids from the membrane spans of the α subunit were shown to affect interactions of the enzyme with ions. Additional experiments, however, demonstrate that the β subunit also affects the behavior of the enzyme toward the transported ions. Based on today's knowledge, interaction of α and β subunits does not seem to occur between their transmembrane spans but rather between extracellular sequences of the two subunits. A hydrophilic sequence of 26 amino acids of the sodium pump α subunit, localized between its M7 and M8 membrane spans (1Lemas M.V. Hamrick M. Takeyasu K. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8255-8259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was shown earlier to interact with an extracellular part of the β subunit (2Hamrick M. Renaud K.J. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24367-24373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since ionophore formation is generally accepted to occur by interactions of membrane spans, the finding that an extracellular interaction of hydrophilic areas of the two proteins affects behavior of the enzyme toward the transported ions might appear rather unexpected. Nevertheless, participation of extracellularly localized sequences in ion conduction has been demonstrated with voltage-dependent Na+ or K+ channels (3Kirsch G.E. Pascual J.M. Shieh C.-C. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 1804-1813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 4Tomaselli G.F. Chiamvimonvat N. Nuss H.B. Balser J.R. Perez-Garcia M.T. Xu R.H. Orias D.W. Backx P.H. Marban E. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 1814-1827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In these channels, a so-called “P-loop” structure (pore-forming loop) that is formed by a hydrophilic extracellular part of the channel protein is proposed to invaginate into the membrane bilayer, being surrounded by the hydrophobic membrane spans of the protein (5Guy H.R. Durell S.R. Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1995; 50: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar). This amphiphilic behavior of the P-loop, interactions with membrane spans and the water surface, is possibly the basis for the control of Na+ or K+ fluxes through the membrane-spanning protein of Na+ or K+ channels. Similar mechanisms have been proposed for the “hour-glass” structure of aquaporin (6Jung J.S. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Guggino W.R. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14648-14654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a recent investigation from this laboratory dealing with the transmembrane topology of α and β subunits of the sodium pump, a structure similar to the P-loop of Na+ or K+channels was proposed to be formed between the M7 and M8 membrane spans of the α subunit (7Fiedler B. Scheiner-Bobis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29312-29320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the proposed model, this structure also contains the 26 amino acids known to interact with the β subunit. A sequence comparison of the hydrophilic loop localized between M7 and M8 spans of the α subunit with the P-loops of K+ or Na+ channels reveals a considerable degree of homology, implying that single amino acids within this sequence might also participate in ion recognition or conduction by the sodium pump. In a first attempt to investigate our hypothesis about a possible participation of this region in ion recognition and to expand our knowledge about the formation of the ionophoric part of the pump, the amino acids Asp884 or Asp885 from the protein loop between M7 and M8 were each altered to Ala, Glu, or Arg. These amino acids from the motif 884DDRW887 have their homologous counterparts in the P-loops of Na+channels from skeletal muscle (399QDYW402) or heart (399QDCW402). The sodium pump mutants were expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and their properties toward Na+ or K+ ions were investigated. The results obtained indicate a possible involvement of Asp884 and Asp885 in the release of Na+ to the extracellular space and allow us to conclude that single amino acids within the structure between the M7 and M8 membrane spans of the α subunit are important in ion recognition and conduction by the sodium pump. For transformation of yeast strain 20B12 (8Chen C.Y. Oppermann H. Hitzeman R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 8951-8970Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) the shuttle vector pCGY1406αβ was used (9Horowitz B. Eakle K.A. Scheiner-Bobis G. Randolph G.R. Chen C.Y. Hitzeman R.A. Farley R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4189-4192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For DNA manipulation in Escherichia coli strains DH5α F′ (Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) the plasmid pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used. Conditions for cell growth and media are described elsewhere (9Horowitz B. Eakle K.A. Scheiner-Bobis G. Randolph G.R. Chen C.Y. Hitzeman R.A. Farley R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4189-4192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the production of mutants from the postulated P-loop-like structure between the 7th and 8th membrane spans of the α subunit the plasmid LPSKH 5–7 was constructed using pBluescript® II SK(+). The original plasmid was digested with SacI and KpnI to remove a part of the multiple cloning site. A new multiple cloning site containing aMunI and a BglII restriction site was ligated into the SacI/KpnI overhangs. Afterward, the vector was linearized by MunI/BglII digestion. A 585-base pair MunI/BglII fragment from pCGY1406αβ that contains the cDNA coding for the sequence between the 5th membrane domain and the terminal sequence of the predicted P-loop-like structure of the α subunit was ligated into the same restriction sites of the modified pBluescript® II SK(+). This new plasmid, denoted LPSKH 5–7, was used as a template for the induction of mutations by inverse PCR (10Hemsley A. Arnheim N. Toney M.D. Cortopassi G. Galas D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6545-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Five different forward primers were used in a PCR to induce mutations of Asp844 or Asp845 (Table I). The reverse primer (5′-GACGTGGAAGACAGCTATGGGCAG-3′) generates aBbvII restriction site used for restriction analysis by inducing a silent mutation (underlined; Table I). Each of the forward primers was incubated at a concentration of 1 μm in the appropriate buffer with 1 μm reverse primer, 1 ng of LPSKH 5–7, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 units of Tfl-polymerase (Biozym, Oldendorf, Germany), and 0.2 mm dNTPs. The total volume of the reaction was 100 μl. After 18 cycles of PCR the amplified DNA was isolated by electrophoresis on a preparative 1% agarose gel and purified by JETSORB (Genomed, Bad Oeynhausen, Germany). After isolation from the gel, DNA fragments were treated for 15 min at 20 °C with 4 units of T4 DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in a volume of 20 μl to remove the dA overhangs added by Tfl-polymerase. Thereafter the plasmid was circularized and used for transformation of bacteria and for sequencing (11Sanger F. Nickler S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52250) Google Scholar). The correctMunI/BglII 585-base pair fragments that contained the mutations were then ligated into the originalMunI/BglII sites of the pCGY1406αβ yeast vector and used for bacteria or yeast transformations. For DNA manipulations standard protocols were used (12Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. S., and Maniatis, T.

Thereafter the cell suspension was transferred into 1 liter of YNB supplemented with all amino acids except tryptophan (13Rose, M. D., Winston, F., and Hieter, P.

Cells were centrifuged and washed twice with H2O. Breaking of the cells occurred under the conditions described previously through the use of a bead-beater (14Wang K. Farley R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3577-3580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microsomes were isolated as described (9Horowitz B. Eakle K.A. Scheiner-Bobis G. Randolph G.R. Chen C.Y. Hitzeman R.A.

(15Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Before use in experiments, microsomes were centrifuged in a bench-top centrifuge at 13,000 × g for 5 min and washed with 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. This procedure was repeated twice and the pellet was suspended in Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Protein concentration was determined again and adjusted to 1 mg/ml. Due to this last washing procedure, the sodium or potassium content in the protein suspension was less than 0.05 mm, as assessed by flame photometry. A total of 250 μg of microsomal protein was incubated to equilibrium (60 min) at 30 °C with various concentrations of [3H]ouabain (Amersham, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom; 48 mCi/mmol) in 5 mm PO4 (Tris form), 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The final volume of each incubation mixture was 250 μl. Thereafter the protein was pelleted at room temperature by centrifugation for 2 min at 13,000 × g in a bench-top centrifuge. The pellet was washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold water and centrifuged again under the same conditions. The protein pellet was then dissolved in 250 μl of 1 m NaOH at 70 °C for 15 min, and after neutralization with 250 μl of 1 m HCl, the amount of bound [3H]ouabain in the pellet was determined by scintillation counting. Nonspecifically bound [3H]ouabain was determined in the presence of excess nonradioactive ouabain (3 mm). Maximum ouabain binding (B max) and dissociation constants (K D ) were calculated from a Scatchard plot (16Scatchard G. Ann. Rev. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17746) Google Scholar). Microsomes from yeast cells expressing either the native enzyme or mutants D884A, D884R, D885A, D885E, or D885R were incubated at a concentration of 1 mg/ml for 5 min at 30 °C with 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 nm [3H]ouabain and various concentrations of ATP (Tris form) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The final volume of each sample was 250 μl. Afterward microsomes were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 2 min and the pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of H2O at 4 °C. Bound [3H]ouabain was determined as described for the Scatchard analysis protocol. A total of 125 μg of the microsomal protein isolated from yeast cells expressing either native enzyme or mutants D884A, D884R, D885A, or D885R was incubated at 30 °C for 5 min in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with 50 nm[3H]ouabain, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, and various concentrations of NaCl. The total volume of each sample was 250 μl. Bound [3H]ouabain was determined as described above. Nonspecifically bound [3H]ouabain was determined in the absence of ATP or in the presence of 3 mm nonradioactive ouabain. A total of 125 μg of the microsomal protein was incubated in 250 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing, 50 nm [3H]ouabain, 5 mm MgCl2, and various concentrations of PO4 (Tris form), pH 7.4. Incubation was carried out for 60 min at room temperature. Bound [3H]ouabain was determined as described above. The reduction of the binding of [3H]ouabain by K+ was measured by incubating 125 μg of the microsomal protein in 250 μl of 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm PO4 (Tris form), pH 7.4, 50 nm [3H]ouabain, 5 mm MgCl2, and various concentrations of KCl. Incubation was carried out for 60 min at room temperature. Bound [3H]ouabain was determined as described above. Microsomal protein from yeast cells expressing either native or the D885R mutant sodium pumps was incubated at a concentration of 50 μg/ml in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmNaCl, and 5 μm eosin Y (Sigma). Membranes from nontransformed yeast cells were used in a control experiment. Fluorescence was measured in a Hitachi 3000P fluorometer using an excitation wavelength of 530 nm and monitoring the emission at 545 nm. The band passes for the excitation or the emission light were each 5 nm. After the addition of 12.5 μm ouabain changes in fluorescence were monitored every 5 min. During this process samples were continuously stirred at room temperature. In itsE 2 state, Na+,K+-ATPase becomes phosphorylated from inorganic phosphate in the presence of Mg2+ (E 2-P; SchemeFS1). Ouabain binds with high affinity to thisE 2-P form of the enzyme, producing a stable (E*2-P·ouabain) complex (17Skou J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) that can be easily detected when radioactive ouabain is used. By keeping all other parameters constant, ouabain binding can be measured as a function of ouabain concentration. From a Scatchard plot it is then possible to determine the affinity and the maximal binding capacity of the enzyme for ouabain. Membranes from yeast cells expressing native Na+,K+-ATPase or any of the mutants bind [3H]ouabain with high affinity under these conditions (Table II). Fig. 1 shows a representative experiment. From Scatchard analyses performed in triplicate aK D of 5.67 ± 1.51 nm was determined for the E*2-P·ouabain complex with native enzyme microsomes. Similar K D values were obtained with microsomes containing the D884A, D885A, or D885E mutants (Table II). In comparison with these values, 3- and 5-fold higherK D values of 15.7 ± 2.04 and 30.1 ± 4.32 nm were determined for the formation of the same complex with microsomes containing either D884R or D885R mutants of the sodium pump, respectively (Fig. 1 and Table II). Maximum ouabain binding was similar with all membrane preparations. In the representative experiment depicted in Fig. 1, maximum ouabain binding was 1.6 nm with microsomes containing native sodium pumps and 1.4 or 1.3 nm with membranes containing D884R or D885R mutants, respectively.Table IIDissociation constants and relative affinities determined for native and mutant sodium pumpsK D, ouabain (nm)K 0.5, ATP (μm)K 0.5, Pi(μm)K 0.5, Na+(mm)K 0.5, K+(mm)Native5.67 ± 1.510.66 ± 0.1645.1 ± 0.981.64 ± 0.013.70 ± 0.75D884A6.64 ± 1.030.89 ± 0.13ND2-aND, not determined.2.15 ± 1.36NDD884R15.7 ± 2.041.01 ± 0.12ND8.60 ± 1.351.90 ± 0.44D885E8.39 ± 3.100.98 ± 0.10NDNDNDD885A5.04 ± 0.361.09 ± 0.0550.5 ± 7.651.60 ± 0.67NDD885R30.1 ± 4.32∞2-b∞, very low affinity.153 ± 11.8∞1.39 ± 0.34K D values for ouabain and K 0.5values for phosphate are from three different experiments (mean ± S.E.).

The amount of the E*2-P·ouabain complex decreases as a function of the K+ concentration (Scheme FS1; Refs. 17Skou J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholarand 18Scheiner-Bobis G. Fahlbusch K. Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, using radioactive ouabain it is possible to elucidate the relative affinity of the sodium pump for K+by determining the amount of E*2-P·ouabain complex formed at various K+ concentrations. In the absence of K+, yeast membranes from cells expressing the native Na+,K+-ATPase bound 1.2 pmol of ouabain/mg of protein in the presence of Mg2+ and phosphate (Fig. 2). Microsomes from cells expressing mutants D884R or D885R bound 0.75 or 0.68 pmol/mg, respectively. As expected, K+ caused a concentration-dependent reduction of the amount of ouabain bound by all types of membranes. TheK 0.5 values for K+ causing the observed half-maximal reduction of theE*2-P·ouabain complex were similar for the native enzyme and for D884R or D885R mutants, ranging between 1.4 and 3.7 mm (Fig. 2, inset; Table II). Na+,K+-ATPase (E 1) becomes phosphorylated from ATP in the presence of Mg2+ and Na+(E 1∼P). The phosphorylated enzyme occludes Na+ ions [E 1∼P(3Na+)] and transports them out of the cell. After Na+ is released, theE 1∼P form is converted to theE 2-P form, which binds [3H]ouabain and forms the stable complex ([E*2-P·ouabain]). This partial reaction of the Na+,K+-ATPase, known as “front-door phosphorylation,” includes a transport step for Na+(Scheme FS2) (17Skou J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). If, for this reaction, all other components are kept at constant concentrations, the formation ofE*2-P·ouabain as a function of the Na+ or ATP concentration can be measured using radioactive ouabain. Microsomes isolated from yeast cells expressing the native Na+,K+-ATPase incorporated [3H]ouabain as a function of the Na+concentration in the presence of Mg2+ and ATP. Maximal binding of [3H]ouabain was 0.78 pmol/mg protein (Fig.3). Na+ ions promoted binding of [3H]ouabain with K 0.5 = 1.64 ± 0.01 mm. Similar results were obtained with membranes containing the D884A or the D885A mutants (Table II). Like these enzymes, the D884R mutant of the sodium pump also bound ouabain as a function of the Na+ concentration (Fig. 3), but the relative affinity for Na+ was considerably reduced. TheK 0.5 for Na+ promotion of ouabain binding was 8.6 ± 1.35 mm and therefore significantly higher than the K 0.5 determined with the native enzyme. Maximal binding of ouabain to the D884R mutant was 0.65 pmol/mg protein (Fig. 3). Under the same conditions, however, ouabain binding to microsomes containing the D885R mutant of the pump was not sensitive to Na+ (Fig. 3), so that a calculation ofK 0.5 was not meaningful. An increase in [3H]ouabain binding was not detected even at rather high (50–500 mm) Na+ ion concentrations (not shown). To investigate whether this lack of ouabain binding to the D885R mutant was due to a decreased affinity of the mutant for Na+ or to a decreased apparent affinity of this enzyme for ATP, measurement of ouabain incorporation was repeated with various ATP concentrations in the presence of 50 mm NaCl. ATP promotion of ouabain binding to microsomes from yeast expressing the D885R mutant of the enzyme was very low (Fig. 4) and could not be used to calculate the K 0.5 value of the reaction. Use of ATP concentrations as high as 2 mm (not shown) did not result in a considerable increase in ouabain binding for this mutant. Fig. 4, however, also demonstrates that ouabain binding to microsomes containing either native or D884R mutant Na+,K+-ATPase was promoted by ATP withK 0.5 values of 0.66 ± 0.16 or 1.01 ± 0.12 μm, respectively. Table II summarizes the results obtained from three experiments with microsomes isolated from various clones. ATP promoted in all cases the binding of ouabain with aK 0.5 of roughly 1 μm. Based on the reaction shown in Scheme FS1, ouabain binding in the presence of Mg2+ can be analyzed as a function of inorganic phosphate concentration. As shown in Table II, inorganic phosphate (Tris form) promoted [3H]ouabain binding to membrane preparations containing either native or mutant sodium pumps. Based on three similar experiments involving membranes isolated from various yeast clones, phosphate was found to promote the binding of ouabain to membranes containing native sodium pumps with aK 0.5 of 45.1 ± 0.98 μm(Table II). A similar K 0.5 value of 50.5 ± 7.65 μm was obtained with membranes containing the D885A mutant. The K 0.5 value of 153 ± 11.8 μm obtained with membranes containing the mutant D885R is approximately 3-fold higher than the K 0.5 values obtained with the native enzyme or the D885A mutants. Eosin binding experiments were performed to investigate whether the D885R mutant retains an ATP-binding site capable of recognizing ATP. Eosin, like its covalently binding analog fluorescein isothiocyanate (19Farley R.A. Faller L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3899-3901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Scheiner-Bobis G. Antonipillai J. Farley R.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9592-9599Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), has been shown in a series of experiments to bind within the ATP-binding site of the Na+,K+-ATPase with high affinity and to display all characteristics of an ATP analog (21Skou J.C. Esmann M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 647: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 22Skou J.C. Esmann M.

Binding to the ATP-binding site causes an increase in fluorescence, which is inhibited or reversed by ouabain (22Skou J.C. Esmann M. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A similar behavior was observed upon incubation of yeast membranes that contain native Na+,K+-ATPase. The initial fluorescence decreased by addition of ouabain in a time-dependent manner with τ1/2 = 3.14·min−1 (Fig.5). Similarly, a decrease in fluorescence was also observed with membranes containing the D885R mutant with a τ1/2 = 1.98·min−1 (Fig. 5). When membranes from nontransformed yeast cells were used in an analogous experiment, no decrease in fluorescence was observed (Fig. 5). A direct comparison of the P-loops of voltage-sensitive Na+ channels from skeletal or heart muscle with the hydrophilic part of the sodium pump α subunit that is located between its M7 and M8 membrane spans reveals a homology in primary structure of about 50% (Fig. 6). Since within these peptides an area of 17 amino acids is 60% homologous (Fig. 6), coincidence appears very unlikely. Within these homologous peptides, Trp402 from the motif 399QDCW402 was shown earlier to be important for the gating of voltage-gated Na+ channels from human skeletal muscle (4Tomaselli G.F. Chiamvimonvat N. Nuss H.B. Balser J.R. Perez-Garcia M.T. Xu R.H. Orias D.W. Backx P.H. Marban E. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 1814-1827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In a recent investigation based on mutagenesis experiments, Asp400 is thought to be localized within the mouth of the pore and to participate in the formation of the selectivity filter of Na+ channels (24Yamagishi T. Ranjan R. Marban E. Tomaselli G.F. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: A262Google Scholar). A homologous motif is present in the P-loop of the equivalent channel from heart muscle (399QDYW402) and within the hydrophilic loop of the sodium pump α subunit (884DDRW887) that connects M7 and M8 membrane spans. This obvious homology leads to the question of whether amino acids within this motif might also be essential for Na+ recognition/conduction by the sodium pump. Comparison of these three sequences reveals that t"

Impaired phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) represents another mechanism incriminated for cell death. We used an unsophisticated perinatal asphyxia model to study heart protein kinases PKC and cyclin dependent kinase (CDK). Tissue pH, ATP, the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathion peroxidase, lipid peroxidation products, carbonyls, and aromatic hydroxylation were also tested. Electron spin resonance was applied to demonstrate the possible presence of radical adducts. An ELISA method was used to determine cell death. PKC activity and mRNA decreased with the length of the asphyctic periods and were paralleled by CDK and pH, whereas cell death gradually increased. No evidence was found for the involvement of active oxygen species or a radical adduct, and no energy depletion was observed. We conclude that impaired protein phosphorylation and/or acidosis may play a role in the pathobiochemistry of death from perinatal asphyxia in the rat."
https://openalex.org/W1597110487,"By high throughput sequencing, we have identified a cDNA encoding a polypeptide related to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placenta growth factor (PlGF) in the VEGF/PDGF gene family. It is designated vascular endothelial growth factor 2 (VEGF-2). Similar to VEGF, expression of VEGF-2 mRNA is abundant in vascular smooth muscle cells and several highly vascularized tissues. VEGF-2 protein is expressed as a secreted 52 kDa precursor as well as the 30 kDa amino-terminal and 27 kDa carboxy-terminal cleavage products. The latter two cleavage products are linked via a disulfide bridge (or bridges) and can be copurified. Using copurified 30 and 27 kDa proteins, the effect of VEGF-2 on growth of several cell types, including vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, was determined. Our results demonstrate that VEGF-2 protein stimulates the growth of human vascular endothelial cells but inhibits growth of human aortic smooth muscle cells induced by platelet-derived growth factor. These studies establish VEGF-2 as a novel regulator for growth of vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W2080829228,"A wide variety of N-methylpyridinium and quinolinium cationic inhibitors of mitochondrial complex I was synthesized to develop potent and specific inhibitors acting selectively at one of the two proposed ubiquinone binding sites of this enzyme (Gluck, M.

Chem. 269, 3167–3174).N-Methyl-2-n-dodecyl-3-methylquinolinium (MQ18) inhibited electron transfer of complex I at under μmorder regardless of whether exogenous or endogenous ubiquinone was used as an electron acceptor. The presence of tetraphenylboron (TPB−) potentiated the inhibition by MQ18 in a different way depending upon the molar ratio of TPB− to MQ18. In the presence of a catalytic amount of TPB−, the inhibitory potency of MQ18 was remarkably enhanced, and the extent of inhibition was almost complete. The presence of equimolar TPB−partially reactivated the enzyme activity, and the inhibition was saturated at an incomplete level (∼50%). These results are explained by the proposed dual binding sites model for ubiquinone (cited above). The inhibition behavior of MQ18 for proton pumping activity was similar to that for electron transfer activity. The good correlation of the inhibition behavior for the two activities indicates that both ubiquinone binding sites contribute to redox-driven proton pumping. On the other hand,N-methyl-4-[2-methyl-3-(p-tert-butylphenyl)]propylpyridinium (MP6) without TPB− brought about approximately 50% inhibition at 5 μm, but the inhibition reached a plateau at this level over a wide range of concentrations. Almost complete inhibition was readily obtained at low concentrations of MP6 in the presence of TPB−. Thus MP6 appears to be a selective inhibitor of one of the two ubiquinone binding sites. With a combined use of MP6 and 2,3-diethoxy-5-methyl-6-geranyl-1,4-benzoquinone, we also provided kinetic evidence for the existence of two ubiquinone binding sites.

Among the inhibitors, positively charged neurotoxic N-methylphenylpyridinium (MPP+) and its analogues exhibit unique inhibitory action (6Gluck M.R. Krueger M.J. Ramsay R.R. Sablin S.O. Singer T.P.

This notion is supported by the existence of two EPR-detectable species of complex I-associated ubisemiquinones (10Vinogradov A.D. Sled V.D. Burbaev D.S. Grivennikova V.G. Moroz J.A. Ohnishi T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and by circumstantial evidence derived from studies on other types of complex I inhibitors (11Gutman M. Mersmann M. Luthy J.

Thus MPP+ analogues are useful probes with which to characterize the structural and mechanistic features of the ubiquinone reduction site of complex I. However, MPP+ analogues synthesized to date have certain limitations when they are used as a complex I inhibitor. For instance, the inhibition by MPP+ analogues requires very high concentrations (approximate mm order) compared with classical inhibitors, and there has been no specific inhibitor that acts selectively at one of the two proposed binding sites. In particular, the latter point seems to be unusual since if indeed there are two distinct binding sites, it is unlikely that their structural properties are completely identical. In addition, considering that proton pumping machinery would be close to the ubiquinone binding site which is a part of the membrane-embedded segment of the enzyme (15Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2822-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 16Yagi T. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16150-16155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hofhaous G. Weiss H. Leonard K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1027-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), it remained to be defined whether the two MPP+(inevitably ubiquinone) binding sites contribute to proton pumping. To overcome these problems and advance the usefulness of MPP+analogues, potent and specific inhibitors acting selectively at one of the two MPP+ binding sites are earnestly required. In the present study, we synthesized a wide variety ofN-methylpyridinium and quinolinium cationic inhibitors (Fig. 1) to develop such a candidate. In searching through our compound sets, we found some very potent and unique inhibitors. Analysis of the inhibition behaviors of these compounds provided strong support for the existence of the two ubiquinone binding sites in complex I and revealed that both sites contribute to redox-driven proton pumping. Moreover, this study identified for the first time a potent inhibitor that exhibits highly selective inhibition against one of the two binding sites.Figure 1Structure of N-methylpyridinium and quinolinium analogues synthesized in this study.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Antimycin A and oligomycin were purchased from Sigma.

MP10 was prepared using ethyl iodide in place of methyl iodide. All of the pyridinium and quinolinium salts were purified by recrystallization from CH2Cl2/Et2O at least three times. Bovine heart submitochondrial particles (SMP) were prepared by the method of Matsuno-Yagi and Hatefi (22Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14424-14427Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) using a sonication medium containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm succinate, 1.5 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and stored in a buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) at −78 °C. SMP containing a pH probe pyranine in the internal compartment were prepared as for ordinary SMP, except that the sonication medium contained 1 mm pyranine. After sonicated particles were collected by centrifugation in a Beckman type 50Ti rotor for 45 min at 43,000 rpm, the pellet was washed twice in buffer A containing 0.25 msucrose, 50 mm KCl, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and suspended by homogenization in the same buffer at 30–40 mg of protein/ml. Untrapped pyranine was removed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 equilibrated with buffer A. The filtration was done at 4 °C, and the particles were collected by centrifugation as described above. The sediments were finally suspended in buffer A. The NADH oxidase activity was followed spectrometrically with a Shimadzu UV-3000 at 340 nm (ε = 6.2 mm−1cm−1) at 25 °C. The reaction medium contained 0.25m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The final mitochondrial protein concentration was 30 μg of protein/ml. The reaction was started by adding 50 μm NADH. The NADH-Q1oxidoreductase activity was determined following NADH oxidation at 25 °C in the same reaction medium in the presence of 50 μm Q1, 0.2 μm antimycin A, 0.2 μm MOA-stilbene, and 2 mm KCN. For the assays with SMP containing pyranine, the reaction medium contained 0.25m sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 10 mmMgSO4, 50 μm Q1, 0.2 μm antimycin A, 0.2 μm MOA-stilbene, 2 mm KCN, and 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Unless otherwise noted, SMP were incubated with inhibitors for 5 min before starting the reaction. When the incubation time was extended to 30 or 120 min, SMP and a definite concentration of inhibitor were preincubated in test tubes at 3 ml of total volume with 30 μg of protein/ml on ice. The test tubes were put into a thermostatic water bath (25 °C) 5 min before starting the reaction to revert the temperature to 25 °C, and a 2.5-ml aliquot was placed in a spectrometer cuvette. The proton pumping activity of complex I was determined with SMP containing pyranine by monitoring changes in the fluorescence intensity of pyranine, which reflects acidification in the internal compartment of SMP, at 510 nm (excited at 460 nm) with a Shimadzu RF-5000 at 25 °C. The reaction medium and final mitochondrial protein concentration were the same as those for the electron transfer experiments, except that the reaction medium contained 0.2 μm oligomycin and 0.2 μm valinomycin. The inhibition of NADH-Q1 oxidoreductase activity by newly synthesized pyridinium and quinolinium derivatives was examined using SMP. Throughout this study, Q1 was mainly used as an electron acceptor since this quinone is considered to be an ideal exogenous substrate for complex I assay (23Fato R. Estornell E. Bernardo S.D. Pallotti F. Castelli G.P. Lenaz G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2705-2716Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The I50 values obtained by inhibitor alone are listed in TableI with that of MPP+ as control. The inhibitory potencies varied widely depending upon structure. TheN-methylpyridiniums possessing an undecyloxy group (MP7, MP8, and MP9) appeared to be potent inhibitors regardless of substitution positions on the pyridinium ring. Replacement of a methyl group of MP7 by an ethyl group retained the activity (MP7versus MP10). The inhibitory potencies of these compounds were much stronger than those of original MPP+ and its simple alkyl analogues (6Gluck M.R. Krueger M.J. Ramsay R.R. Sablin S.O. Singer T.P. Nicklas W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3167-3174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ramsay R.R. Krueger M.J. Youngster S.K. Singer T.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Replacing the pyridinium ring by the quinolinium ring slightly enhanced the activity (MP1 versusMQ11, and MP7 versus MQ17). In this case as well, variation in substitution positions did not significantly affect the activity (MQ18 versus MQ19). These results along with the fact thatN-benzylpyridiniums retain activity (24Murphy M.P. Krueger M.J. Sablin S.O. Ramsay R.R. Singer T.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) indicated that the steric requirement for the binding of MPP+ analogues to complex I is not so severe. This conclusion is consistent with the notion that the ubiquinone reduction site is spacious enough to accommodate a variety of structurally different inhibitors in a dissimilar manner, as claimed from the studies on other types of complex I inhibitors (3Friedrich T.

To understand the mechanisms underlined in this regulation in normal human cells, we have analysed in vivo protein-DNA interactions at the Cyclin A locus in primary T lymphocytes. Stimulation of purified T lymphocytes by a combination of monoclonal antibodies directed at CD2 and CD28 adhesion molecules gives rise to a long lasting proliferation in the absence of accessory cells. Cyclin A was observed after 4 days of costimulation with anti CD2 + CD28 whereas stimulation by anti CD2 or anti CD28 alone was not effective. In vivo genomic DMS footprinting revealed upstream of the major transcription initiation sites, the presence of at least three protein binding sites, two of which were constitutively occupied. They bind in vitro respectively ATF-1 and NF-Y proteins. The third site was occupied in quiescent cells or in cells stimulated by anti CD2 or anti CD28 alone. The mitogenic combination of anti CD2 + anti CD28 released the footprint as cells were committed to proliferation. Consistent with theses results, nuclear extracts prepared from quiescent cells formed a specific complex with this element, whereas extracts prepared from cells treated with anti CD2 + anti CD28 failed to do so after cells entered a proliferative state."
https://openalex.org/W2335345452,"The net distribution of eukaryotic transcription factors between the cytoplasm and the nucleus provides an effective mechanism for controlling gene expression. We have utilized cis-acting signals for both nuclear import and nuclear export to experimentally manipulate the distribution of the v-Rel oncoprotein between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The respective abilities of the v-Rel oncoprotein to localize to the nucleus in chicken embryo fibroblasts, to activate kappaB-dependent transcription in yeast, and to transform avian lymphoid cells were each markedly reduced by the fusion of a cis-acting nuclear export signal onto v-Rel. Our results demonstrate that a threshold nuclear function of v-Rel is required for manifestation of its oncogenic properties. In contrast, while increased expression of the avian IkappaB-alpha protein was able to prevent nuclear localization of v-Rel in chicken embryo fibroblasts, coexpression of IkappaB-alpha with v-Rel in the target cell for v-Rel mediated transformation did not reduce the ability of v-Rel to transform avian lymphoid cells or alter the distribution of v-Rel between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in v-Rel-transformed cells. Our results suggest that the ability of IkappaB-alpha to inhibit nuclear localization of v-Rel is affected by cell-type specific differences between fibroblasts and lymphoid cells."
