Results presented here show that bile acids are physiological ligands for the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), an orphan nuclear receptor. When bound to bile acids, FXR repressed transcription of the gene encoding cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis, and activated the gene encoding intestinal bile acid–binding protein, which is a candidate bile acid transporter. These results demonstrate a mechanism by which bile acids transcriptionally regulate their biosynthesis and enterohepatic transport."

Physiological concentrations of free and conjugated chenodeoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid, and deoxycholic acid activated the farnesoid X receptor (FXR; NR1H4), an orphan nuclear receptor. As ligands, these bile acids and their conjugates modulated interaction of FXR with a peptide derived from steroid receptor coactivator 1. These results provide evidence for a nuclear bile acid signaling pathway that may regulate cholesterol homeostasis."

The lovastatin biosynthesis cluster contains two type I polyketide synthase genes. Synthesis of the main nonaketide-derived skeleton was found to require the previously known iterative lovastatin nonaketide synthase (LNKS), plus at least one additional protein (LovC) that interacts with LNKS and is necessary for the correct processing of the growing polyketide chain and production of dihydromonacolin L. The noniterative lovastatin diketide synthase (LDKS) enzyme specifies formation of 2-methylbutyrate and interacts closely with an additional transesterase (LovD) responsible for assembling lovastatin from this polyketide and monacolin J."

The most frequent mutation is a 4,977-base pair deletion also called the common deletion, which is increased in photoaged skin. Oxidative stress may play a major role in the generation of large scale mtDNA deletions, but direct proof for this has been elusive. We therefore assessed whether the common deletion can be generated in vitro through UV irradiation and whether reactive oxygen species are involved in this process. Normal human fibroblasts were repetitively exposed to sublethal doses of UVA radiation and assayed for the common deletion employing a semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction technique. There was a time/dose-dependent generation of the common deletion, attributable to the generation of singlet oxygen, since the common deletion was diminished when irradiating in the presence of singlet oxygen quenchers, but increased when enhancing singlet oxygen half-life by deuterium oxide. The induction of the common deletion by UVA irradiation was mimicked by treatment of unirradiated cells with singlet oxygen produced by the thermodecomposition of an endoperoxide.

The most frequent and best characterized mutation in mtDNA is a deletion of 4,977 base pairs in length, also called the common deletion. This common deletion is considered to be a marker for mutations in the mitochondrial genome, and substantial efforts have been made to elucidate the mechanism by which it is generated. A modified slip-replication mechanism has been proposed (9Shoffner J.M. Lott M.T. Voljavec A.S. Soueidan S.A. Costigan D.A. Wallace D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, oxidative stress induced by solar radiation may also be responsible for the increased frequency of mtDNA mutations in photoaged human skin (14Birch-Machin M.A. Tindall M. Turner R.

Evidence for a direct link between reactive oxygen species and the generation of large deletions of the mitochondrial genome, however, has not yet been provided. In the present study we demonstrate that the common deletion can be generated under defined conditions in human dermal fibroblasts through repetitive UVA irradiation. By employing this in vitro model we provide evidence that UVA radiation-induced mtDNA deletions are caused by the generation of singlet oxygen. Human normal skin fibroblasts were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Life Technologies GmbH, Eggenstein, Germany) containing 15% fetal calf serum (Greiner, Frickenhausen, Germany), 0.1% l-glutamine, 2.5% NaHCO3, and 1% streptomycin/amphotericin B in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were kept in 10-cm culture dishes for culture and irradiation. For UVA irradiation, medium was replaced by PBS, lids removed, and cells were exposed to radiation from a UVASUN 5000 Biomed irradiation device (Mutzhas, Munich, Germany). The emission was filtered with UVACRYL (Mutzhas) and UG1 (Schott Glaswerke, Munich, Germany) and consisted of wavelengths greater than 340 nm. The UVA output was determined with a UVAMETER (Mutzhas) and found to be approximately 70 milliwatts/cm2 UVA at a tube-to-target distance of 30 cm. In order to generate the common deletion, cells were irradiated three times daily with 8 J/cm2 UVA for 4 consecutive days and checked for viability by trypan blue exclusion. Cells were then aliquoted 1:1 with one aliquot stored at −80 °C until extraction of mtDNA. The other aliquot was plated to a 10-cm culture dish for ongoing culture and irradiation as indicated. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma except for sodium azide (Merck) and applied as described previously (23Grether-Beck S. Olaizola-Horn S. Schmitt H. Grewe M. Jahnke A. Johnson J.P. Briviba K. Sies H. Krutmann J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14586-14591Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Vitamin E (as α-tocopheryl succinate) was dissolved in ethanol and added to cells 24 h before irradiation at a concentration of 25 μm. For irradiation in the presence of heavy water, deuterium oxide (99.9 atom %2H) was used at a final concentration of 95% in PBS (24Wlaschek M. Briviba K. Stricklin G.P. Sies H. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 194-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Singlet oxygen was generated by thermal decomposition of the endoperoxide of the disodium salt of 3,3′-(1,4-naphthylidene)dipropionate (NDPO2). Cells were incubated with 0.3 mm NDPO2 in PBS for 1 h in the dark at 37 °C, which yielded singlet molecular oxygen and 3,3′-(1,4-naphthylidene)dipropionate (NDP) (25DiMascio P. Sies H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 2909-2914Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This singlet oxygen system was shown to be well suited for use in cell cultures, because it is water-soluble and nontoxic for these cells up to 40 mm for 1-h incubation (24Wlaschek M. Briviba K. Stricklin G.P. Sies H. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 194-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Infrared emission of singlet oxygen was measured with a liquid nitrogen-cooled germanium photodiode detector (model EO-817L, North Coast Scientific, Santa Rosa, CA) as described previously (25DiMascio P. Sies H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 2909-2914Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The rate of singlet oxygen generation was monitored by the formation of NDP. Fifteen minutes after addition of NDPO2, the rate of singlet oxygen generation was 1 μm/min. Total cellular DNA was extracted from normal human fibroblasts employing the QIAamp Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). For estimation of mtDNA content, PCR with primers C1 and C2 was carried out, amplifying a product of 247 base pairs in length. Amplification of fragments representing the common deletion was carried out as described previously (20Berneburg M. Gattermann N. Stege H. Grewe M. Vogelsang K. Ruzicka T. Krutmann J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1997; 66: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 26Gattermann N. Berneburg M. Heinisch J. Aul C. Schneider W. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1995; 9: 1704-1710PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, primer oligonucleotides (A1/A2) were designed to anneal outside the common deletion. During DNA amplification the polymerase extension time was designed to be too short for the amplification of wild-type PCR-products only allowing the efficient amplification of the shorter and deleted mtDNA-fragments. To increase sensitivity and specificity a secondary, nested PCR was performed (B1/B2) from the primary PCR product. Linear amplification conditions for each primer pair used were determined as described in detail previously (27Henninger H.P. Hoffmann R. Grewe M. Schulze-Specking A. Decker K. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Amplification was found to be linear up to 31 cycles for primers C1/C2 and A1/A2 and up to 30 cycles for B1/B2. Therefore primary PCR (primers A1/A2 and C1/C2) was carried out in 100-μl reaction volume with 0.1–0.3 μg of genomic DNA and 0.5 unit of Taq polymerase. Primer and nucleotide concentrations were 1 and 400 μm, respectively. For PCR, initial denaturation (94 °C, 4 min) was followed by 28 cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 1 min), annealing (58 °C, 1 min), and extension (72 °C, 45 s). A 2-μl aliquot of the primary reaction was entered into reamplification (B1/B2) with the same PCR conditions except concentration of dNTPs (40 μm/dNTP), an annealing temperature of 68 °C, and a further decrease in the extension time to 30 s. Polymerase chain reaction was carried out in a Perkin-Elmer DNA Thermocycler 480 (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany), primer oligonucleotides were generated by MWG-Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). The following sequences and nucleotide positions (shown in parentheses) are according to Andersonet al. (28Anderson S. Nature. 1981; 290: 457-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (7644) Google Scholar): A1, 5′ GCA GTA ATA TTA ATAATT TTC ATG 3′ (7293–7316); A2, 5′ CTA GGG TAG AAT CCG AGT ATG TTG 3′ (13928–13905); B1, 5′ TGA ACC TAC GAG TAC ACC GA 3′ (7901–7920); B2, 5′ GGG GAA GCG AGG TTG ACC TG 3′ (13650–13631); C1, 5′ ATG CTT GTA GGA CAT AAT AA 3′ (219–238); C2, 5′ AGT GGG AGG GGA AAA TAA TA3′ (466–447). Amplification products were visualized in a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide (0.25 μg/ml). Products were quantified by ion-exchange chromatography connected to an on-line ultraviolet spectrophotometer (Gynkotek, Germering, Germany), which allowed exact quantification of amplification products at 260 nm (27Henninger H.P. Hoffmann R. Grewe M. Schulze-Specking A. Decker K. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar,29Grewe M. Gyufko K. Schöpf E. Krutmann J. Lancet. 1994; 343: 25-26Abstract PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), and quantification of deleted mtDNA was carried out as described previously (20Berneburg M. Gattermann N. Stege H. Grewe M. Vogelsang K. Ruzicka T. Krutmann J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1997; 66: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The amplification product generated by primer pair C1 and C2 represents a segment of the mtDNA (30Kogelnik A.M. Lott M.T. Brown M.D. Navathe S.B. Wallace D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 112-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), carrying no known mutations of the mtDNA. Thus, it served as a reference fragment representing the overall amount of mtDNA molecules present in the cultured cells. Values determined for PCR products representing the common deletion were normalized to values of the reference fragments of the same cell lines. To confirm their identity, PCR products were subjected to diagnostic digestion with the restriction enzyme XbaI (New England Biolabs GmbH, Schwalbach, Germany). In order to determine the maximal UVA dose that allows sublethal repetitive irradiation, normal human fibroblasts were exposed to UVA doses of 0, 4, 8, and 16 J/cm2 three times daily (Fig.1). Repetitive irradiation with 16 J/cm2 induced cell death, whereas irradiation with doses of 0, 4, and 8 J/cm2 had no effect on cell viability. In the subsequent experiments cells were therefore exposed to repetitive doses of 8 J/cm2. Amplification of total DNA extracts from normal human fibroblasts with primer oligonucleotides C1/C2 by PCR yielded the expected fragment of 247 base pairs in all experiments. The amplification of this fragment confirmed the effective extraction of mtDNA and served as a reference fragment for subsequent quantification (Fig.2 a). Nested PCR of fibroblasts exposed to repetitive UVA irradiations followed by ion-exchange chromatography showed no signal for the common deletion after 12 irradiations. Exposure of cells to 24 irradiations yielded the first detectable signal (Fig. 2, b and c), and maximal induction was observed after an irradiation of cells for 36 times. Sham-irradiated control cells showed no increase of the common deletion at any of the irradiation intervals. Digestion of PCR products with the restriction enzyme XbaI confirmed the identity of the amplified fragments (data not shown). The role of singlet oxygen as a mediator of UVA radiation effects has been shown for several systems (31Modak S.B. Tyrrell R.M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4505-4510PubMed Google Scholar, 32Scharffetter-Kochanek K. Wlaschek M. Briviba K. Sies H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 304-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the present study, reagents capable of quenching (sodium azide, vitamin E) or enhancing (deuterium oxide) singlet oxygen effects were examined for their capacity to affect UVA radiation-induced generation of the common deletion. As shown in Fig.3, repetitive irradiation of fibroblasts in the presence of sodium azide significantly suppressed the induction of the common deletion in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, suppression of UVA-mediated mtDNA mutagenesis was also observed when cells were treated with vitamin E during UVA radiation exposure. Moreover, irradiation of normal fibroblasts in the presence of deuterium oxide (D2O) resulted in a slight but consistent increase of signal intensity for the common deletion when compared with cells exposed to UVA radiation alone (Fig.4).Figure 4Singlet oxygen mediation of UVA effect.Coincubation of irradiated cells with D2O: for UVA irradiation of fibroblasts, in the presence of heavy water, medium was replaced with deuterium oxide (99.9 atom % 2H) at a final concentration of 95% in PBS. After irradiation, D2O was removed again, and cells were kept in normal medium. Generation of singlet oxygen by NDPO2: unirradiated cells were treated with singlet oxygen generated by thermal decomposition of the endoperoxide of the disodium salt of NDPO2, 0.3 mm in PBS for 1 h in the dark at 37 °C, and yielded singlet molecular oxygen and NDP. The rate of singlet oxygen generation was monitored by the formation of NDP. Fifteen min after addition of NDPO2, the steady-state rate of singlet oxygen generation was 1 μm/min. Control cells were stimulated with NDP, which had been generated by thermal decomposition from the same batch of NDPO2 used in these same experiments.

Therefore it was assessed whether these UVA radiation-induced effects could be mimicked by stimulating unirradiated cells with singlet oxygen generated via thermal decomposition of NDPO2 (23Grether-Beck S. Olaizola-Horn S. Schmitt H. Grewe M. Jahnke A. Johnson J.P. Briviba K. Sies H. Krutmann J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14586-14591Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 25DiMascio P. Sies H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 2909-2914Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, incubation of cells with NDPO2 led to the induction of the common deletion in normal human fibroblasts parallel to the observed UVA induced mutagenesis, whereas incubation with NDP did not generate a signal for the common deletion. Large scale deletions of mitochondrial DNA such as the common deletion are thought to play a central role in aging of human tissues. Analysis of the mechanism by which the common deletion is generated in human cells during the normal aging process would require an assay system allowing the generation of mitochondrial mutations under standardized conditions and in a reproducible manner by exposing relevant target cells to physiologically occurring oxidative stress. In the present study we have therefore assessed whether it is possible to generate mitochondrial DNA mutations in cultured human dermal fibroblasts by exposing them in vitro to UVA radiation. The assay system is based on the following. Chronically sun-exposed human skin has a higher content of mtDNA mutations than sun-protected skin, and a role for mtDNA mutations in photoaging of human skin has been proposed (14Birch-Machin M.A. Tindall M. Turner R. Haldane F. Rees J.L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 149-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 20Berneburg M. Gattermann N. Stege H. Grewe M. Vogelsang K. Ruzicka T. Krutmann J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1997; 66: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 22Yang J.-H. Lee H.-C. Wei Y.-H. Arch Dermatol. Res. 1995; 287: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Comparative analysis of the epidermalversus dermal compartment of photoaged skin revealed that the common deletion is almost exclusively present in dermal cells (14Birch-Machin M.A. Tindall M. Turner R. Haldane F. Rees J.L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 149-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, in the present study, dermal fibroblasts were used and exposed to UVA radiation, which can penetrate into the dermis at significant dose levels. The UVA radiation doses employed for in vitroirradiation of fibroblasts are of physiological relevance, since they are similar to those administered to human skin during the course of a 15–30-min sun exposure on a summer day at noon at the northern latitude of 30–35° (33Frederick J.E. Alberts A.D. Urbach F. Biological Responses to Ultraviolet A Radiation. Valdenmar, Overland Park, KS1992: 7-18Google Scholar). Human cells are capable of repairing damage to mtDNA induced by reactive oxygen species (34Driggers W.J. LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22042-22045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. Beecham E.J. Stevnsner T. Wassermann K. Bohr V.A. Carcinogenesis. 1992; 13: 1967-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), and therefore an irradiation regimen has been developed that shifts the steady-state in cells between irradiation-induced damage and ongoing repair toward the damage side. By employing this protocol, it has indeed been possible to reproducibly generate the common deletion in human fibroblasts under standard conditions (Fig. 2). A possible explanation for this could be that cells harboring the common deletion show a selective growth advantage, thus leading to increasing amounts of this deletion. It has been described, however, that there are selection mechanisms in cells containing large scale mtDNA deletions that lead to a growth disadvantage rather than an a growth advantage (26Gattermann N. Berneburg M. Heinisch J. Aul C. Schneider W. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1995; 9: 1704-1710PubMed Google Scholar, 36Bourgeron T. Chretien D. Rotig A. Munnich A. Rustin P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19369-19376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore it is very unlikely that the observed increase of the common deletion is simply due to differences in growth. Furthermore, the induction of the common deletion was a function of the number of UVA radiation exposures given to cells, indicating that it resulted from cumulative photodamage. We therefore propose that UVA radiation-induced generation of the common deletion in human dermal fibroblasts, as described here, represents a novelin vitro model to study the mechanism (i) by which the common deletion is generated in human cells in general and (ii) by which UVA radiation contributes to aging in particular. It has been proposed that oxidative stress is responsible for the generation of mitochondrial DNA mutations in human cells (5Beckman K.B. Ames B.N. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 547-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3142) Google Scholar), but a direct link between reactive oxygen species and large scale deletions of mtDNA has thus far been elusive. Here we have demonstrated that UVA radiation causes the generation of the common deletion in human fibroblasts through an oxidative mechanism that depends on the generation of singlet oxygen. Evidence for the involvement of singlet oxygen in biological processes is based on the use of quenchers to diminish singlet oxygen-mediated effects, on strategies that allow extension of the half-life of singlet oxygen to enhance singlet oxygen-mediated effects, and on the use of singlet oxygen-generating systems. By employing these three different strategies we here provide evidence that generation of the common deletion in human dermal fibroblasts through repetitive UVA irradiation critically depends on the generation of singlet oxygen. Formation of mitochondrial DNA mutations is thought to occur by misannealing of direct repeats situated in thed-loop (Scheme FS1) during replication of mtDNA, thereby leading to excluded loops (9Shoffner J.M. Lott M.T. Voljavec A.S. Soueidan S.A. Costigan D.A. Wallace D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7952-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). In order to complete the deletion process, single strand breaks need to be generated to permit exonucleolytic degradation of the looped-out DNA. Based on the present study we propose a model in which singlet oxygen generation is responsible for base damage and subsequent strand break formation. In DNA, guanosines represent the prime targets for modification by UVA, and singlet oxygen (37Floyd R.A. West M.S. Eneff K.L. Schneider J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 273: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 38Devasagayam T.P. Steenken S. Obendorf M.S. Schulz W.A. Sies H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6283-6289Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and G stretches are extremely susceptible to modification (39Ito K. Kawanishi S. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 1307-1312PubMed Google Scholar, 40Sies H. Schulz W.A. Steenken S. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1996; 32: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 41Arkin M.R. Stemp E.D. Pulver S.C. Barton J.K. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 389-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In mtDNA, replication is started at the replication origin of the heavy strand (OH) generating thed-loop (Scheme FS1), which after misannealing leads to the excluded loop (9Shoffner J.M. Lott M.T. Voljavec A.S. Soueidan S.A. Costigan D.A. Wallace D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7952-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The heavy strand contains several guanosine stretches of 3 to 5 bases of which many are in direct proximity to the direct repeats. Therefore it is tempting to speculate that the required strand breaks are indeed generated in this excluded loop via singlet oxygen. Our studies identify a previously unrecognized biological function of singlet oxygen. In addition, they demonstrate that oxidative stress is indeed responsible for the generation of large scale deletions of mitochondrial DNA in human cells that have been exposed to UVA radiation, which induces tissue aging under normally occurring conditions. In previous studies, singlet oxygen was found to mediate other UVA radiation-induced biological effects as well. In particular, UVA radiation-induced expression of metalloproteinases I, II, and III expression in human dermal fibroblasts was mediated through the generation of singlet oxygen (24Wlaschek M. Briviba K. Stricklin G.P. Sies H. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 194-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases in human skin fibroblasts is thought to be partially responsible for the decreased content of collagen fibers in photoaged human skin. Furthermore recent findings indicate that singlet oxygen is linked with the in vivo UVA action spectrum, which is responsible for photoaging of mouse skin (42Hanson K.M. Simon J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10576-10578Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Taken together with the present observation that UVA radiation-induced singlet oxygen is capable of generating mitochondrial DNA mutations in UVA-irradiated dermal fibroblasts, it is possible that the generation of singlet oxygen in human skin is of central importance for photoaging. Singlet oxygen quenching may thus represent an effective strategy to protect human skin from photoaging.

Data are also presented that the activation of NADPH oxidase requires that β-amyloid peptides be in fibrillary state, is inhibited by inhibitors of tyrosine kinases or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and by dibutyryl cyclic AMP, and is potentiated by interferon-γ or tumor necrosis factor-α.

Data are also presented that the activation of NADPH oxidase requires that β-amyloid peptides be in fibrillary state, is inhibited by inhibitors of tyrosine kinases or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and by dibutyryl cyclic AMP, and is potentiated by interferon-γ or tumor necrosis factor-α.

The major component of the senile plaques is the β-amyloid protein (Aβ), a 39–43-amino acid peptide, derived from a larger transmembrane glycoprotein called β-amyloid precursor protein (1Haass C. Selkoe D.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 1039-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). The Aβ of the senile plaques consists of fibrils that are 4–10 nm in diameter and exhibit green birefringence under polarized illumination when stained with Congo Red. According to spectroscopic and x-ray diffraction studies, the amyloid fibril assembly is correlated with the adoption of a β-sheet structure (2Glenner G.G. N. Engl. J.

https://openalex.org/W2093465143,"Assembly of solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins between two opposing membranes is thought to be the key event that initiates membrane fusion. Many new SNARE proteins have recently been localized to distinct intracellular compartments, supporting the view that sets of specific SNAREs are specialized for distinct trafficking steps. We have now investigated whether other SNAREs can form complexes with components of the synaptic SNARE complex including synaptobrevin/VAMP 2, SNAP-25, and syntaxin 1. When the Q-SNAREs syntaxin 2, 3, and 4, and the R-SNARE endobrevin/VAMP 8 were used in various combinations, heat-resistant complexes were formed. Limited proteolysis revealed that these complexes contained a protease-resistant core similar to that of the synaptic complex. All complexes were disassembled by the ATPaseN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein and its cofactor α-SNAP. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that major conformational changes occur during assembly, which are associated with induction of structure from unstructured monomers. Furthermore, no preference for synaptobrevin was observed during the assembly of the synaptic complex when endobrevin/VAMP 8 was present in equal concentrations. We conclude that cognate and non-cognate SNARE complexes are very similar with respect to biophysical properties, assembly, and disassembly, suggesting that specificity of membrane fusion in intracellular membrane traffic is not due to intrinsic specificity of SNARE pairing.

They possess a homologous domain of approximately 60 amino acids referred to as the SNARE motif (7Weimbs T. Mostov K. Seng H.L. Hofmann K. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 260-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The best characterized SNAREs are those mediating exocytosis of synaptic vesicles in neurons. They include the vesicle protein synaptobrevin (also referred to as VAMP) and the membrane proteins SNAP-25 and syntaxin 1. In vitro, these proteins form a stable ternary complex that is reversibly dissociated by the soluble ATPase NSF in conjunction with soluble cofactors termed SNAPs (8Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W.

Assembly and disassembly of SNAREs has recently been investigated in detail by several laboratories (5Rizo J. Südhof T.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 6Weis W.I. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 328-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 10Katz L. Hanson P.I. Heuser J.E.

It is generally believed that it is the formation of a ternary complex between complementary SNAREs residing on the membranes destined to fuse (“trans” complexes) that drives the fusion reaction. After fusion, the complexes are disassembled by NSF and SNAPs and thus re-energized for another round of membrane fusion. According to the original SNARE hypothesis (1Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar), each fusion step in membrane trafficking would be mediated by a unique set of SNAREs. These would function only in one fusion step and be excluded from others. This specificity was thought to be caused by the intrinsic affinity of SNAREs for each other, i.e. only cognate SNAREs were thought to bind to each other. Recently, however, it has become clear that at least some SNAREs can function in multiple trafficking steps such as the yeast proteins Sed5p and Vti1p (13Fischer von Mollard G. Nothwehr S.F. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1511-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 14Götte M. Fischer von Mollard G.

Acta. 1998; 1404: 9-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these proteins apparently participate in the formation of several different SNARE complexes, suggesting that they are able to pair with more than one set of partners. SNARE complex assembly is mediated by the SNARE motifs of the participating proteins which form a protease-resistant core domain (16Fasshauer D. Eliason W.K. Brünger A.T. Jahn R.

Biol. 1998; 5: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The transmembrane regions of syntaxin and synaptobrevin are directly adjacent to the SNARE motifs, aligned at one end of the core domain (18Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E.

Biol. 1998; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These features, together with the heat stability of the complex (21Fasshauer D. Otto H. Eliason W.K. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28036-28041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), led to the proposal that the SNAREs “zipper up” during assembly, forcing the transmembrane domains into close proximity and thus pull the fusing membranes together (3Hanson P.I. Heuser J.E. Jahn R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 4Hay J.C. Scheller R.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The energy released during assembly would thus be used to overcome the energy barrier separating the two membranes (21Fasshauer D. Otto H. Eliason W.K. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28036-28041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The central domain of the synaptic SNARE complex is represented by a 12-nm-long bundle consisting of four parallel α-helices that are wound around each other (24Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). The interacting amino acids form distinct layers perpendicular to the axis of the four helix bundle, which are similar to those found in typical coiled-coils. These layers are formed by hydrophobic amino acid side chains with the exception of an ionic layer in the middle which consists of three glutamine residues, contributed by syntaxin and the two SNARE-motifs of SNAP-25, and one arginine residue, contributed by synaptobrevin (24Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). The striking conservation of the glutamine (Q) and arginine (R) throughout the entire SNARE superfamily led us to reclassify SNAREs into Q- and R-SNAREs (25Fasshauer D. Sutton R.B. Brünger A.T. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15781-15786Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic layers in the four helix bundle are also conserved whereas residues exposed at the surface are much more variable. The ability to form four helix bundles is probably the essential feature of the SNAREs that is conserved among the entire superfamily (25Fasshauer D. Sutton R.B. Brünger A.T. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15781-15786Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Given the high degree of core residue conservation the question arises if SNARE pairing is as specific as previously assumed. Numerous side-chain interactions were observed at the surface of the synaptic SNARE complex, particularly between SNAP-25 and syntaxin (24Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar), which involve non-conserved residues (25Fasshauer D. Sutton R.B. Brünger A.T. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15781-15786Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). It is not known to which extent these interactions contribute to the overall stability of the SNARE complex or to the kinetics of SNARE assembly. Since the overall sequence homology between more distant members of the SNARE superfamily is relatively low, such interactions may contribute to pairing specificity. If, however, the surface interactions of the SNARE complex do not exert a decisive influence on complex assembly and stability, one would predict that complexes form not only between cognate but also between non-cognate SNAREs. If complex formation is indeed indiscriminatory, then one must look elsewhere for explaining the specificity of membrane fusion events. In order to address this issue, we have investigated whether different SNAREs can form complexes, and if so, whether these complexes resemble the neuronal SNARE complex. In our experiments, we have focused on complexes containing either closely related or distant relatives of the neuronal SNAREs. Our results show that all SNAREs investigated here can be combined in arbitrary composition to yield complexes of very similar biophysical properties. All complexes have a high α-helical content, contain a protease-resistant core domain, are heat-stable, and are disassembled by NSF. Furthermore, the distant synaptobrevin relative, endobrevin/VAMP 8, is not discriminated from synaptobrevin upon assembly with the neuronal SNAREs SNAP-25 and syntaxin 1. NSF and α-SNAP in pQE-9 plasmids encoding for His6-tagged fusion proteins were kindly provided by S. Whiteheart and J. E. Rothman (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York). Syntaxin 1A (residues 1–265) in the pET22b vector encoding for a factor Xa cleavable COOH-terminal His6fusion protein was kindly provided by A. T. Brünger (Yale University, New Haven, CT). The recombinant protein fragments were derived from cDNAs encoding for rat synaptobrevin 2 and rat syntaxin 1A (kindly provided by R. H. Scheller, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA) and for SNAP-25A (kindly provided by T. C. Südhof, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Recombinant light chain of botulinum neurotoxin E (BoNT/E) was a generous gift of H. Niemann (Institut für Biochemie, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Hannover, Germany). Rat endobrevin was amplified by PCR using primers annealing outside of the coding region based on sequence information from Expressed Sequence Tag data base. cDNA from rat liver, lung, and kidney was used as a template. The PCR product was subcloned into pBS vector and sequenced. All constructs derived from the three different tissues were identical. The rat endobrevin amino acid sequence was 99% identical to mouse endobrevin (26Wong S.H. Zhang T. Xu Y. Subramaniam V.N. Griffiths G. Hong W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1549-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 27Advani R.J. Bae H.R. Bock J.B. Chao D.S. Doung Y.C. Prekeris R. Yoo J.S. Scheller R.H. J. Biol.

Postnuclear supernatant was generated by centrifugation at 1000 ×g for 10 min and solubilized in extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm PMSF, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100) at a final protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 60 min. After transfer of the supernatant to a fresh tube, immunoprecipitations were conducted for 2 h at 4 °C with a monoclonal antibody against synaptobrevin (69.1) (28Edelmann L. Hanson P.I. Chapman E.R. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) or a serum against endobrevin (residues 1–74) that was raised in rabbits. The serum against endobrevin had been affinity-purified. Antibodies were bound to Protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min, sedimented, and washed eight times with extraction buffer. The supernatants were precipitated according to Wessel and Flügge (29Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates and 10% of the precipitated supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using the antibody described above for endobrevin, 69.1 for synaptobrevin, and the monoclonal antibody HPC-1 for syntaxin-1 (30Barnstable C.J. Hofstein R. Akagawa K. Brain Res. 1985; 352: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Coding sequences were amplified by PCR using primers with appropriate restriction sites for subsequent subcloning into the desired plasmid. The sequence encoding for the cytoplasmic region of rat endobrevin (residues 1–74) was subcloned into pGEX-KG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) viaBamHI and EcoRI restriction sites resulting in a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST). The cytoplasmic domains of rat syntaxin 2 (1–265), syntaxin 3 (1–260), and syntaxin 4 (1–273) were subcloned into the pHO2c vector (21Fasshauer D. Otto H. Eliason W.K. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28036-28041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) viaNdeI and EcoRI restriction sites resulting in fusion proteins carrying a carboxyl-terminal His6 tag. In order to obtain better expression, rat SNAP-25A was subcloned into the vector pET28a (Novagen) via NheI and XhoI restriction sites resulting in an amino-terminal His6 tag. In addition, four cysteines (Cys-84, -85, -90, and -92) were replaced by serines by the overlapping primer method of Higuchi (31Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Ehrlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13517) Google Scholar). No difference in structural and binding properties to the cysteine containing SNAP-25 construct (21Fasshauer D. Otto H. Eliason W.K. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28036-28041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) was observed (data not shown). GST-endobrevin (residues 1–74) was purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose beads essentially as described (20Fasshauer D. Bruns D. Shen B. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4582-4590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). After purification, the GST tag was cleaved by thrombin. Fusion proteins containing His6 tags (syntaxin 1 (1–265), pET22b; syntaxin 1 (180–262), pET28a (24Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar); syntaxin 2 (1–265), pHO2c; syntaxin 3 (1–260), pHO2c; syntaxin 4 (1–273), pHO2c, SNAP-25A, pET28a; synaptobrevin 2 (1–96), pET28a (24Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar)) were purified by Ni2+-Sepharose as described (16Fasshauer D. Eliason W.K. Brünger A.T. Jahn R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10354-10362Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar,21Fasshauer D. Otto H. Eliason W.K. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28036-28041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). After elution from the affinity matrices, all recombinant proteins were dialyzed against standard buffer and further purified by ion exchange chromatography using Mono-Q or Mono-S columns on an FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After loading, the proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (standard buffer). The peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed against standard buffer containing 100 mm NaCl. The eluted proteins were about 95% pure, as determined by SDS gel electrophoresis. All binary and ternary complexes were purified using a Mono-Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) after overnight assembly of the purified monomers. Protein concentrations were determined by absorption at 280 nm and the Bradford assay (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The purified ternary complexes were subjected to limited digestion in standard buffer containing 100 mm NaCl using proteinase K in a ratio of 1:100 (w:w) protease:protein complex at 25 °C for 5 min. For analysis by SDS-PAGE, PMSF-containing SDS sample buffer was added. For analysis by size-exclusion chromatography on a HR-10/30 Superdex-200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by multi-angle laser light scattering (MALLS), the reaction was stopped by adding 1 mmPMSF and placing the samples on ice. Ternary complexes were disassembled by addition of 3 μm NSF, 11 μm α-SNAP, 2 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm ATP in standard buffer for 40 min at 30 °C in the presence of 1.5 μmBoNT/E light chain. The reaction was stopped by heating the samples for 5 min at 95 °C in SDS-sample buffer. As controls, the reaction was carried out either in absence of NSF and α-SNAP, or the ATPase activity of NSF was abolished by replacing MgCl2 with 10 mm EDTA. As an assay for disassembly, cleavage of SNAP-25 by BoNT/E was monitored using Tricine electrophoresis for fragment separation. For immunodetection of SNAP-25, the monoclonal antibody Cl 71.1 (33Walch-Solimena C. Blasi J. Edelmann L. Chapman E.R. Fischer von Mollard G. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) was used. Far UV CD spectra were obtained by averaging over 5–50 scans using steps of 0.2 nm with a scan rate of 50 nm/min on a Jasco model J-720 upgraded to a J-715U equipped with a 6-Position Peltier Effect Cell Changer. Measurements were performed in Hellma quartz cuvettes with path lengths of 0.1 cm. All CD spectra were recorded after reaching equilibrium following an overnight incubation at 4 °C in the standard buffer. To evaluate changes of the CD spectrum attributable to complex formation, the spectra were compared with the theoretically noninteracting sum of the individual spectra using the equation [θ]sum = Σi cini[θ]i/Σi cini, whereci are the respective concentrations of the proteins, ni are the respective numbers of amino acid residues, and [θ]i are the mean residue ellipticities of the individual proteins. For thermal melts, the ellipticity at 220 nm was measured between 25 and 95 °C with a temperature increment of 30 °C/h. Routinely, SDS-PAGE was carried out as described by Laemmli (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). When testing for SDS resistance, samples were solubilized in SDS sample buffer (final concentrations: 60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 3% β-mercaptoethanol) and incubated at room temperature (not boiled) or 95 °C (boiled) for 5 min before analysis on a 15% polyacrylamide gel. For analysis of the constituents of the protease-resistant core complex, Tricine gel electrophoresis (16.5% T, 6% C) was used (35Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Size-exclusion chromatography was performed on a HR-10/30 Superdex-200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in standard buffer containing 150 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The elution profiles were monitored by UV absorption at 280 nm, light scattering at 632.8 nm, and differential refractometry. Light scattering and differential refractometry were carried out using the Dawn and Optilab instruments, respectively, of Wyatt Technology Corp. Analysis was carried out as described by Astra software (36Wyatt P. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1993; 272: 1-40Crossref Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). For each sample, 100 μl of protein solution (between 0.5 and 1 mg/ml protein) was loaded. Thedn/dc value (change of solution refractive index with respect to a change in concentration of the molecules being investigated) is fairly constant for proteins (37Wen J. Arakawa T. Philo J.S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) and was set to 0.189 for the analysis of the light scattering data. Four different SNARE proteins were examined for their ability to form complexes with the SNAREs involved in neuronal exocytosis. These included syntaxin 2, syntaxin 3, and syntaxin 4, three relatives of syntaxin 1 that exhibit a similar domain structure (38Bennett M.K. Garcia-Arraras J.E. Elferink L.A. Peterson K. Fleming A.M. Hazuka C.D. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 863-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), and are significantly homologous within the SNARE motifs (Fig.1 A). The homology is not limited to the amino acids participating in core interactions but includes residues on the surface. Despite their differential tissue distribution and intracellular localization, these syntaxins are probably involved in fusions of transport vesicles with the plasma membrane and thus may interact physiologically with the neuronal SNAREs in certain cell types. As the fourth example, we chose the R-SNARE endobrevin/VAMP 8, a distant relative of synaptobrevin, which is localized to endosomal compartments (26Wong S.H. Zhang T. Xu Y. Subramaniam V.N. Griffiths G. Hong W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1549-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 27Advani R.J. Bae H.R. Bock J.B. Chao D.S. Doung Y.C. Prekeris R. Yoo J.S. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10317-10324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Within the SNARE motif, only the amino acids of the core layers are partially conserved, with much less similarity in the rest of the sequence (Fig.1 A). For the binding experiments, all proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The proteins were mixed in various combinations and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE for the formation of SDS-resistant complexes. It was shown previously that the synaptic SNARE complex is resistant to SDS, a feature widely used for monitoring complex formation (39Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Of the eight SNARE combinations, six formed SDS-resistant complexes, as demonstrated by the appearance of protein bands with apparent molecular masses corresponding to ternary complexes (Fig. 1 B). No SDS-resistant complex was observed with the combinations SNAP-25/endobrevin/syntaxin 3 and syntaxin 4, respectively. However, complex formation was detected when the samples were analyzed by non-denaturing PAGE or size exclusion chromatography (data not shown, see also below). For further analysis, we chose three representative complexes including endobrevin/syntaxin 1/SNAP-25, synaptobrevin 2/syntaxin 4/SNAP-25, and endobrevin/syntaxin 3/SNAP-25. These complexes were purified by ion exchange chromatography and then subjected to limited proteolysis. Previously, it was shown that the core domain of the synaptic SNARE complex, i.e. the region of the interacting SNARE motifs, is protease-resistant, whereas non-interacting SNARE motifs are efficiently cleaved (16Fasshauer D. Eliason W.K. Brünger A.T. Jahn R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10354-10362Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 17Poirier M.A. Xiao W. Macosko J.C. Chan C. Shin Y.K. Bennett M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 a, digestion of all three complexes with proteinase K yielded a fragment migrating at about 16 kDa and a group of bands migrating between 8 and 14 kDa. When the digests of the endobrevin/syntaxin 1/SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin 2/syntaxin 4/SNAP-25 complexes were not heated prior to electrophoresis, a single SDS-resistant band was visible instead of the group of 8–14-kDa bands whereas the 16-kDa band remained unchanged (Fig. 2 B). This result precisely corresponds to the observations made previously for the synaptic SNARE complex (16Fasshauer D. Eliason W.K. Brünger A.T. Jahn R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10354-10362Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and indicates that the 16-kDa represents the NH2-terminal domain of the respective syntaxins, whereas the 8–14-kDa bands represent the complex-forming SNARE motifs. These findings suggest that protease-resistant core domains are formed that are very similar to that of the synaptic complex. No such SDS-resistant band containing the 8–14-kDa SNARE motifs was observed with the endobrevin/syntaxin 3/SNAP-25 complex (data not shown). Therefore, we have analyzed the digest of this complex by size-exclusion chromatography. Fig. 2 C shows that a single major peak eluted from the column which contained a group of 8–14-kDa bands (presumably representing the core complex forming SNARE motifs). The 16-kDa band (presumably representing the NH2-terminal domain of syntaxin 3) was well separated and eluted at a position corresponding to a smaller molecular mass (Fig. 2 C). The first peak eluting from the column was further analyzed by MALLS, a procedure allowing for a direct determination of the molecular mass irrespective of the shape of the complex (36Wyatt P. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1993; 272: 1-40Crossref Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). The procedure resulted in a molecular mass of 41.3 (± 0.7) kDa, which is similar to that of the core of the synaptic SNARE complex (16Fasshauer D. Eliason W.K. Brünger A.T. Jahn R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10354-10362Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). A similar elution profile was obtained when the digest of the SDS-resistant synaptobrevin 2/syntaxin 4/SNAP-25 complex was separated (Fig. 2 C). This indicates that these complexes contain the four SNARE motifs in a 1:1:1:1 stoichiometry. As outlined above, the synaptic complex is represented by an extended bundle of four α-helices yielding a characteristic α-helical spectrum in CD measurements.

Eukaryotic cells rapidly and reversibly halt protein synthesis in response to a variety of stresses including virus infection and cytotoxic chemical injury (1Duncan R.F. Hershey J.W. Arch. Biochem.

This fundamental homeostatic mechanism is thought to involve the phosphorylation of the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF2α), 1The abbreviations used are: eIF2α, α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor-2; As, sodium arsenite; IL-3, interleukin-3; PKR, double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase; TG, thapsigargin; ds, double-stranded; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HA, hemagglutinin which regulates protein synthesis rate at translational initiation. Phosphorylation of eIF2α increases the stability of complexes formed between eIF2 and eIF2B, a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor. eIF2B converts eIF2-GDP to eIF2-GTP binary complex, which further forms a ternary complex with a Met-tRNA and becomes associated with the 40 S ribosomal subunit to initiate translation of mRNA. Because eIF2B exists in cells in relatively low molar quantities with respect to eIF2, phosphorylation of only a limited amount (i.e. 20–25%) of eIF2α is apparently sufficient to sequester virtually all of the eIF2B, resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis (3Proud C.G.

In interferon-treated cells, virus infection leads to activation of PKR by autophosphorylation, followed by eIF2α phosphorylation and inhibition of protein synthesis (5Clemens M.J. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 139-172Google Scholar, 6Mathews M.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 505-548Google Scholar). Thus, protein synthesis inhibition occurring after virus infection is thought to be due to the direct activation of PKR by dsRNA species. However, the mechanism of eIF2α phosphorylation in the absence of infection is not clear. We previously reported that in interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent cells, IL-3 deprivation induced activation of PKR in close association with a decreased rate of total protein synthesis (7Ito T. Jagus R. May W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7455-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that stresses such as Ca2+ depletion from the endoplasmic reticulum, sodium arsenite, or hydrogen peroxide treatments rapidly induce PKR activation (8Prostko C.R. Dholakia J.N. Brostrom M.A. Brostrom C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6211-6215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 9Srivastava S.P. Davies M.V. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24995-25002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It was suggested that although PKR is activated by dsRNAin vitro, a dsRNA-independent activation mechanism may exist in cells because it is difficult to envision that such diverse stresses are likely to rapidly change the intracellular levels of dsRNA species. Thus a novel cellular regulator of PKR was sought. By screening a mouse cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid interacting cloning system, we discovered a PKR-associating protein RAX. RAX appears to be a mouse homologue of PACT, a recently isolated direct activator for PKR (11Patel R.C. Sen G.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4379-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). We now find that RAX can activate PKR in the absence of dsRNA in a cell-free system as reported for PACT. However, results here indicate that the RAX-PKR association and any resulting cellular activation of PKR may be regulated by an unique, stress-induced signaling mechanism featuring RAX phosphorylation. Using polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis, the mouse PKR cDNA (12Icely P.L. Gros P. Bergeron J.J. Devault A. Afar D.E. Bell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16073-16077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was first mutated at lysine 271 to arginine to generate the catalytically inactive PKR(K271R), the mouse equivalent to human PKR(K296R) mutant (13Meurs E.F. Galabru J. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Hovanessian A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), and then subcloned into pGBT9 (CLONTECH). A random primed NFS/N1.H7 cell cDNA library was generated in pGAD10 (CLONTECH). The yeast two-hybrid screening of the cDNA library was performed according to the Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System protocol (CLONTECH). A 405-base pair mouse RAX cDNA fragment (nucleic acid positions 943–1348) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and radiolabeled using the Prime-A-Probe kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). A mouse multiple tissue blot was obtained fromCLONTECH, and hybridization was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction. The RAX cDNA was cloned into pRSET vector (Invitrogen) to generate a polyhistidine-tagged RAX and used to transform Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Novagen, Madison, WI). The protein was induced and partially purified with TALON metal affinity resin according to the manufacturer's instruction (CLONTECH). The fraction containing RAX was incubated with poly(I·C)-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the protein was dissociated by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and further purified by SDS-PAGE. The gel slice containing the recombinant RAX was used to immunize a rabbit to raise anti-RAX antiserum (COVANCE Research Products Inc., Denver, PA). The murine IL-3-dependent NFS/N1.H7 cells (14Boswell H.S. Mochizuki D.Y. Burgess G.S. Gillis S. Walker E.B. Anderson D. Williams D.E. Exp. Hematol. 1990; 18: 794-800PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% WEHI-3B cell conditioned medium as described previously (7Ito T. Jagus R. May W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7455-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged RAX cDNA was subcloned into the expression vector pcDEF3 (15Goldman L.A. Cutrone E.C. Kotenko S.V. Krause C.D. Langer J.A. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 1013-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and transfected into NFS/N1.H7 cells by electroporation. The clones stably expressing HA-RAX were selected as described previously (16Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Cells (1 × 107) were treated with 1 mm sodium arsenite (Sigma), 1 mm hydrogen peroxide (Sigma), or 1 μm thapsigargin (Calbiochem) and lysed in 1 ml of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 20 mm sodium molybdate, 20 μg/ml chymostatin, and 1 μm microcystin-LR). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed using anti-PKR antibody (Ab-1) or anti-HA antibody (12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using protein A-agarose beads, as described previously (7Ito T. Jagus R. May W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7455-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For metabolic labeling, cells were incubated with 0.1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphoric acid (ICN) at 1 × 107 cells/ml in phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium for 2 h. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as described (17Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). 5 μg of polyhistidine-tagged RAX was incubated with 30 μl of poly(I·C)-agarose, native DNA-cellulose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), or poly(C)-agarose (Sigma) beads in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times before boiling in Laemmli buffer. The eluted protein was loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel followed by Coomassie Blue R-250 staining. The phosphorylation state of eIF2α in NFS/N1.H7 cells was analyzed by vertical slab isoelectric focusing and immunoblotting essentially as described previously (7Ito T. Jagus R. May W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7455-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 18Maurides P.A. Akkaraju G.R. Jagus R. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). After treatment, cells (3 × 106) were lysed in 100 μl of buffer A. The acetone-precipitated extract (100 μg) was subjected to the isoelectric focusing and immunoblotting using ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a rabbit eIF2α polyclonal antibody raised against a KLH-coupled synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 298–315 of human eIF2α. For analysis of RAX phosphorylation, Bio-lyte 6/8 (Bio-Rad) and 10 mm ethylenediamine (Sigma) were used for the ampholytes and the cathode buffer, respectively. Before transfer, the gel was treated with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 10 mmdithiothreitol for 30 min at room temperature to enhance the elution efficiency. PKR was freshly isolated from the exponentially growing NFS/N1.H7 cells by immunoaffinity purification using anti-PKR antibody (Ab-2) (7Ito T. Jagus R. May W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7455-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). PKR was recovered by competitive elution with the synthetic peptide (7Ito T. Jagus R. May W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7455-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The HA-RAX was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody as described above and was recovered from the immunocomplex by competitive elution with 1 mg/ml HA peptide (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After dialysis against Tris-buffered saline, the purified HA-RAX was quantitated by immunoblotting using bacterially expressed RAX as a reference. Samples were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in 50 μl of reaction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 0.1 μg of rabbit reticulocyte eIF2α). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%), and 32P incorporation was quantitated by auroradiography or directly measured by InstantImager™ (Packard, Meriden, CT). Cells (1.5 × 106) were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline and lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmEDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100). The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was treated with 1 μg of RNase A and 40 μg of proteinase K for 2 h at 37 °C, respectively. The DNA was precipitated with 0.5 m NaCl and 50% isopropanol at −70 °C and analyzed by electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel containing 10 μg/ml ethidium bromide. To identify novel cellular proteins that could potentially interact with and modulate PKR, we screened a mouse IL-3-dependent NFS/N1.H7 cell cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid interactive cloning system (20Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar). As bait, the mouse PKR(K271R), which is deficient in kinase activity (13Meurs E.F. Galabru J. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Hovanessian A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), was used because wild type PKR inhibits yeast growth (21Chong K.L. Feng L. Schappert K. Meurs E. Donahue T.F. Friesen J.D. Hovanessian A.G. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). From 4 × 106 yeast transformants screened, eight positive clones were obtained. The sequence analysis revealed that six clones are derived from the same novel gene. Clone c35 contained the longest (1080 base pairs) cDNA and encoded a putative 313-amino acid polypeptide terminated by TAG stop codon (Fig.1 A). This gene is referred to as RAX (PKR-associated protein X). Further 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends studies using poly(A) RNA from NFS/N1.H7 cells showed that full-length RAX cDNA is 1.6 kilobases. Computer search (BLAST) analysis indicated that both cDNA and amino acid sequences of RAX are highly homologous to those of human PACT (95 and 98% identity, respectively), a recently identified PKR-associating protein (11Patel R.C. Sen G.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4379-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). The striking similarity suggests that RAX is a murine counterpart of PACT. RAX also has significant homology to two other dsRNA-binding proteins, including a Xenopus dsRNA-binding protein Xlrbpa (22Eckmann C.R. Jantsch M.F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 239-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (69% homology) and the mammalian TAR-RNA-binding protein (23Gatignol A. Buckler-White A. Berkhout B. Jeang K.T. Science. 1991; 251: 1597-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and its murine counterpart, Prbp (24Lee K. Fajardo M.A. Braun R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3023-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) (60% homology). As featured in these proteins, RAX also contains three dsRNA-binding motifs arranged in tandem whose function is not yet clear (25St. Johnston D. Brown N.H. Gall J.G. Jantsch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10979-10983Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). As predicted, recombinant RAX was able to specifically bind dsRNA because virtually no binding to DNA or single-stranded RNA was observed (Fig.1 B). Northern blot analysis of poly(A) RNA prepared from mouse tissues showed that RAX mRNA is expressed in all tissues tested (Fig.1 C). Furthermore, an polyclonal antibody raised against recombinant RAX recognized a 35-kDa protein in the lysates from cell lines derived from different species including mouse NIH3T3, IL-3-dependent NFS/N1.H7, rat pheochromocytoma PC-12, and monkey COS7 cells (Fig. 1 D). The migration at the 35-kDa position on SDS-PAGE gel corresponds well with a calculated molecular mass of RAX (34 kDa). Importantly, an increased signal was observed in COS7 cells after transfection of RAX cDNA, indicating that the 35-kDa immunoreactive protein is RAX. The 35-kDa band was detected in human HeLa and MCF-7 cell lysates, indicating that the antibody can react with human PACT (Fig. 1 D). These results indicate that RAX/PACT is an ubiquitously expressed and well conserved gene between the species. To investigate the biological function of RAX, we first transfected HA epitope-tagged RAX into IL-3-dependent NFS/N1.H7 cells (14Boswell H.S. Mochizuki D.Y. Burgess G.S. Gillis S. Walker E.B. Anderson D. Williams D.E. Exp. Hematol. 1990; 18: 794-800PubMed Google Scholar) and obtained more than 10 clones that stably express different levels of HA-RAX (Fig. 2 A). There was no significant correlation between the expression levels of HA-RAX and the cell growth rate, suggesting that overexpression of RAX is not growth suppressive in these cells in the presence of IL-3 (Fig.2 B). Interestingly, however, we found that HA-RAX overexpression accelerates cell apoptosis following withdrawal of IL-3 (Fig. 2, C and D). This apoptosis promoting effect appears to be dependent on the expression levels of the exogenous HA-RAX protein because high expressing clones form fragmented internucleosomal DNA faster than the low expressing clones or vector controls. These results suggest that RAX has a pro-apoptotic function that may be suppressed in the presence of growth factor. Results from the yeast two-hybrid assay suggest that RAX can bind to PKR. To examine the effects of RAX on PKR activity, an in vitro reconstitution kinase assay was developed using proteins isolated from mammalian cells. HA-RAX was immunopurified from exponentially growing cells (clone 13; Fig. 2). The purified HA-RAX contained no associated kinase activity, indicating that any potentially associated PKR was removed during purification (Fig.3 A, first lane). PKR was purified separately from exponentially growing parental NFS/N1.H7 cells. We found that HA-RAX could potently activate PKR as indicated by eIF2α phosphorylation and PKR autophosphorylation in the absence of dsRNA (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, if suboptimum amounts of dsRNA are added to the reaction, RAX synergistically activates PKR (Fig. 3 B). Thus, we find HA-RAX purified from growing cells can activate PKR in vitro. However, overexpression of HA-RAX apparently does not affect the growth of NFS/N1.H7 cells in the presence of IL-3, suggesting that the overexpressed RAX in vivo may not be activating cellular PKR efficiently under the growing condition. In support of this notion, co-immunoprecipitation studies using anti-PKR and anti-HA reveal that the RAX-PKR association is barely detected in exponentially growing cells even when highly expressed as in the case with clone 13 (i.e. expresses approximately 5–10-fold more than the endogenous level) (Fig. 4 A). However, an increase in the association occurs when the cells are deprived of IL-3 for 2.5 h, a time by which protein synthesis is significantly inhibited by PKR activation (7Ito T. Jagus R. May W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7455-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover, more dramatic and rapid RAX-PKR association is observed when the cells are exposed to various chemical stresses including sodium arsenite (As), H2O2, or thapsigargin (TG), an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticular Ca2+-ATPase (Fig. 4 A), agents known to potently inhibit protein synthesis (1Duncan R.F. Hershey J.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 256: 651-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 10Brostrom C.O. Prostko C.R. Kaufman R.J. Brostrom M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24995-25002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Importantly, the total amount of HA-RAX in the cell lysate is not affected by any of these stress treatments, confirming that any increased association is not due to increased RAX expression (Fig.4 A, lower panel). Furthermore, as previously reported (2Proud C.G. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1992; 32: 243-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 7Ito T. Jagus R. May W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7455-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 26Brostrom C.O. Brostrom M.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 79-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), the stress treatments were also found to induce phosphorylation of eIF2α, clearly indicating that PKR, its physiologic kinase, has been activated (Fig. 4 B). Significantly, any eIF2α phosphorylation cannot be detected in growing transfected cells, indicating that the simple overexpression of exogenous RAX is not sufficient to activate PKR and inhibit growth.Figure 4Stress-induced RAX-PKR association and activation of PKR . A, cells (clone 13, 1 × 107) were incubated with 1 mm As or 1 μm TG or 1 mm H2O2for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence of IL-3. Alternatively, cells were deprived from IL-3 for 2.5 h. PKR was immunoprecipitated (IP) from the cell lysate using anti-PKR antibody or preimmune serum (Pre), and the associated RAX was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using anti-HA antibody (upper panel). Aliquots of whole cell lysate were also examined without immunoprecipitation (lower panel).B, the phosphorylation status of eIF2α at each point inpanel A was analyzed by vertical slab isoelectric focusing and immunoblotting as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These results suggest that RAX can directly bind to and activate PKR following application of stress conditions. The rapid RAX-PKR association observed after the stress treatments raised the possibility that RAX may be post-translationally modified as a result of any stress signal evoked by the treatments. Isoelectricfocusing analysis revealed that exponentially growing NFS/N1.H7 cells contain only a single species of RAX with an approximate pI of 8.6 (Fig.5 A). Interestingly, IL-3 deprivation or treatment of cells with As or TG induced the prominent acidification of RAX to pI 8.3 (Fig. 5 A). A similar RAX mobility shift was also observed when HA-RAX expressing cells were either treated with As, TG, or H2O2 or deprived of IL-3 (Fig. 5 B). HA-RAX was more acidic (i.e.pI 7.8) than RAX due to the acidic nature of the HA peptide sequence and was shifted to pI 7.5 following stress treatments. When HA-RAX was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate and treated with alkaline phosphatase before loading onto the gel, the TG-induced, shifted band was no longer observed whereas migration of RAX purified from growing cells did not change after alkaline phosphatase treatment (Fig.5 C). These findings indicate that growing, unstimulated cells contain only the nonphosphorylated RAX, whereas the stress treatments induced phosphorylation of RAX. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that RAX is exclusively phosphorylated on serine residue(s) following As treatment or IL-3 deprivation (Fig. 5 D). Both RAX and eIF2α phosphorylation were detected within 3 min after treatment with TG and As. Significantly, however, phosphorylation of RAX begins and is maximal before that of eIF2α, indicating that RAX phosphorylation precedes PKR activation (Fig.6 A). Because PKR was unable to directly phosphorylate HA-RAX in vitro (Fig. 3), RAX does not appear to be a substrate for PKR. To test whether cellular RAX could be phosphorylated by PKR after its association, we examined whether 2-aminopurine, a selective inhibitor for PKR (27Farrell P.J. Balkow K. Hunt T. Jackson R.J. Trachsel H. Cell. 1977; 11: 187-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 28Zinn K. Keller A. Whittemore L.A. Maniatis T. Science. 1988; 240: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), could affect RAX phosphorylation. Results revealed that the eIF2α phosphorylation caused by IL-3 deprivation was potently inhibited by 2-aminopurine but had little or no effect on RAX phosphorylation (Fig.6 B). These results therefore suggest that RAX is phosphorylated by stress-activated, 2-aminopurine-resistant serine protein kinase(s) before it activates PKR. The paradigm for PKR activation following viral infection indicates that dsRNA activates this important regulator of protein synthesis, but the mechanism of activation in the absence of viral infection is not clear. Several studies have shown that various stress stimuli can induce eIF2α phosphorylation (2Proud C.G. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1992; 32: 243-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 26Brostrom C.O. Brostrom M.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 79-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), indicating that activation of PKR may occur as a result of stress signaling, but whether dsRNA is involved is not known. Our results indicate that RAX may be a direct, stress-sensitive activator of PKR. The high sequence similarity between mouse RAX and human PACT suggests that RAX is a mouse homologue of PACT, which was recently identified using a similar interactive cloning strategy (11Patel R.C. Sen G.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4379-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the in vitrostudies with purified RAX indicate that RAX, like PACT, can directly activate PKR, confirming that PKR can be activated by cellular proteins in the absence of dsRNA. The current model of PKR activation holds that two molecules of PKR bind to a single dsRNA molecule, thereby leading to homodimerization, which results in autophosphorylation via transphosphorylation (5Clemens M.J. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 139-172Google Scholar). RAX-mediated autophosphorylation and activation of PKR indicates that RAX may also bind two PKR molecules to cause homodimerization of PKR. We also found that RAX can synergistically activate PKR in the presence of dsRNA (Fig. 3), indicating an unique mechanism. Although further studies are required, the potential for a functionally synergistic interaction between RAX and dsRNA with respect to PKR activationin vivo is considered high because PKR is associated with ribosomes where dsRNA species may be abundant (5Clemens M.J. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 139-172Google Scholar, 29Zhu S. Romano P.R. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14434-14441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). PKR activation leads to protein synthesis inhibition and decreased cell growth (5Clemens M.J. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 139-172Google Scholar, 21Chong K.L. Feng L. Schappert K. Meurs E. Donahue T.F. Friesen J.D. Hovanessian A.G. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 30Lee S.B. Esteban M. Virology. 1994; 199: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Because RAX can efficiently activate PKR, RAX-PKR association during cell growth must be tightly regulated to prevent inadvertent activation of PKR. Co-immunoprecipitation studies suggest that the RAX-PKR interaction can be enhanced by stress signals. The mechanism, however, remains unknown. We found a significant correlation between PKR activity and the phosphorylation state of RAX after various stress treatments. Because RAX phosphorylation clearly precedes PKR activation, these data support the idea that the post-translational modification of RAX may be involved in the RAX-PKR association and activation of PKR in vivo. Phosphoamino acid analysis shows that only serine is phosphorylated, indicating that RAX is the substrate for a stress-activated serine/threonine kinase. Arsenite, thapsigargin, hydrogen peroxide, and IL-3 withdrawal all have been reported to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase subfamily that includes c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase and p38 kinase (31Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 32Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). Whether RAX is a substrate for these kinases will require further studies. Interestingly, RAX in growing cells is not heavily phosphorylated (Fig.5), but even unphosphorylated RAX can apparently activate PKR in vitro (Fig. 3). Therefore, these results suggest that RAX phosphorylation per se is not required for PKR activation but may potentially regulate the RAX-PKR association and affect PKR activation, possibly by altering the affinity or accessibility of RAX to PKR. However, the precise regulatory role for RAX phosphorylation and the mechanism by which RAX can activate PKR remains to be elucidated. Because PKR is a ribosomal protein (29Zhu S. Romano P.R. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14434-14441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 33Wu S. Kumar K.U. Kaufman R.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13816-13826Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), one possibility is that phosphorylation may facilitate ribosomal localization of RAX and thereby association with PKR. Another is that phosphorylated RAX may have a higher affinity for PKR binding than certain PKR inhibitory molecules such as p58 (34Lee T.G. Tang N. Thompson S. Miller J. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2331-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and TAR-RNA-binding protein (35Park H. Davies M.V. Langland J.O. Chang H.W. Nam Y.S. Tartaglia J. Paoletti E. Jacobs B.L. Kaufman R.J.

Identification of the phosphorylation site(s) and subsequent site-directed mutagenesis analysis of RAX are required to test these possibilities. Patel and Sen (11Patel R.C. Sen G.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4379-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) have reported that transient transfection of the PACT cDNA increased the level of eIF2α phosphorylation (about 2-fold) in HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells, and the establishment of cell lines stably overexpressing PACT was unsuccessful. On this basis it was concluded that simple overexpression of PACT activates PKR and suppresses cell growth. By contrast, RAX can be overexpressed (more than 10-fold) in IL-3-dependent NFS/N1.H7 cells with no effect on PKR activity or cell growth, at least in the presence of IL-3. Although the reason for the discrepancy between PACT and RAX with respect to cell growth is not yet clear, it could be due to the different cell types tested. RAX, in the absence of IL-3, accelerates apoptosis in direct proportion to the expression levels (Fig.2 B). Therefore, it seems likely that growth factors such as IL-3 may, at least in part, potently suppress stress signals (e.g. stress kinase activity) by inhibiting the association between RAX and PKR. It will therefore be important to determine whether PACT can be overexpressed in NFS/N1.H7 cells and not result in cell death in the presence of IL-3. In addition to PKR, another stress-sensitive eIF2α kinase, termed PERK (36Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar) or PEK (37Shi Y. Vattem K.M. Sood R. An J. Liang J. Stramm L. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7499-7509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has been recently cloned. PERK is associated with endoplasmic reticulum and can be activated by endoplasmic reticulum stresses such as thapsigargin. However, PERK is not activated by cytoplasmic stresses including arsenite, ultraviolet irradiation, and heat shock (36Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar). In fact, our recent data indicate that neither arsenite nor IL-3 deprivation activates PERK in NFS/N1.H7 cells. 2T. Ito, D. Ron, and W. S. May, unpublished data. Thus, some stresses may activate only PKR, whereas some may activate both eIF2α kinases through different mechanisms. In summary, we propose that RAX is part of a novel stress-activated signaling pathway that features inhibition of protein synthesis that occurs as a result of the direct interaction between RAX and PKR. Because PKR activation has been implicated in apoptosis and the stresses applied here can all induce cell apoptosis, activated RAX appears to be a potent negative regulator of cell growth and survival.

Cells were cultivated at a dilution rate of 0.10 h−1 under various nutrient-limited conditions (anaerobically glucose- or nitrogen-limited or aerobically glucose-, galactose-, fructose-, ethanol-, or nitrogen-limited), or at dilution rates ranging between 0.05 and 0.38 h−1 in aerobic glucose-limited cultures. Transcription ofHXT1–HXT7 was correlated with the extracellular glucose concentration in the cultures. Transcription of GAL2, encoding the galactose transporter, was only detected in galactose-limited cultures. SNF3 and RGT2, two members of the HXT family that encode glucose sensors, were transcribed at low levels. HXT8–HXT17 transcripts were detected at very low levels. A consistent relationship was observed between the expression of individual HXT genes and the glucose transport kinetics determined from zero-transinflux of 14C-glucose during 5 s. This relationship was in broad agreement with the transport kinetics of Hxt1–Hxt7 and Gal2 deduced in previous studies on single-HXT strains. At lower dilution rates the glucose transport capacity estimated from zero-trans influx experiments and the residual glucose concentration exceeded the measured in situ glucose consumption rate. At high dilution rates, however, the estimated glucose transport capacity was too low to account for the in situ glucose consumption rate.

Carrier-mediated hexose transport across the plasma membrane is an essential step in the utilization of hexoses by Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1Lagunas R. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 104: 229-242Crossref Google Scholar). Based on measurements of zero-transinflux of radioactive glucose into washed cells, two kinetically distinguishable transport systems have been described: a low affinity system (K m ≈ 10–50 mm) expressed by cells growing in media with a high glucose concentration, and a high affinity system (K m ≈ 1–3 mm) expressed by cells in low glucose media (2Bisson L.F. Fraenkel D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1730-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 3Walsh M.C. Smits H.P. Scholte M. van Dam K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 953-958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells growing in low glucose media often display both a high affinity component and a low affinity component (2Bisson L.F. Fraenkel D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1730-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar).Genetic studies and analysis of the S. cerevisiae genome have implicated the HXT family of homologous genes in encoding the hexose transporters expressed by this yeast. The 20 members of this family include HXT1–HXT17,GAL2 (encoding the galactose transporter), andSNF3 and RGT2 (encoding putative sensors of high and low glucose concentrations, respectively) (4Kruckeberg A.L. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 166: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The glucose transport kinetics of some individual HXT gene products have been analyzed in genetically modified yeast strains; it was found that a strain with null mutations in HXT1–HXT7 (thehxt null strain) was not able to grow on various concentrations of glucose (5Reifenberger E. Freidel K. Ciriacy M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). When these seven HXT genes were expressed individually as single chromosomal copies in thehxt null strain, they were all able to confer growth on glucose or fructose medium with the exception of HXT5. However, the growth properties of the single-HXT strains differed on media with different glucose concentrations, suggesting that the genes are regulated differently in response to glucose or that they encode transporters with different affinities for glucose (5Reifenberger E. Freidel K. Ciriacy M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar).Thus far, regulation of individual HXT genes or subsets of the HXT gene family has been studied by various means, including immunodetection, mRNA analysis, and expression ofHXT promoter-lacZ fusions (6Özcan S.

In such cultures, rapid changes occur in substrate availability (e.g. from sugar excess to sugar depletion), metabolite concentrations (e.g.ethanol accumulation), pH, and oxygen tension. Moreover, the substrate affinity of glucose transport changes during batch growth on glucose (3Walsh M.C. Smits H.P. Scholte M. van Dam K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 953-958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to batch cultivation, chemostat cultivation allows for studies on effects of specific environmental parameters because each parameter can be varied independently (15Pirt S.J. Principles of Microbe and Cell Cultivation. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 29-41Google Scholar). In particular, the specific growth rate μ (defined as the relative biomass increase in time) can be easily manipulated, because it is numerically equal to the dilution rate (D) in steady state chemostat cultures. By selecting appropriate nutrient limitation regimes and specific growth rates, chemostat cultivation permits studies on glucose transport in cells grown under steady state conditions, both under sugar limitation and in the presence of excess sugar (16Weusthuis R.A. Pronk J.T. van den Broek P.J.A. van Dijken J.P. Microbiol.

Glucose transport kinetics were determined for cells grown at a fixed specific growth rate under different nutrient limitations and for cells from aerobic glucose-limited chemostat cultures grown at various specific growth rates. Transcription of all 20 HXT genes was studied by Northern analysis of RNA isolated from these cultures. This approach enabled a comparison of the expression of the individual HXT genes with the glucose transport kinetics of the cultures, taking into account the kinetic characteristics of the transporter proteins inferred from earlier studies with single-HXT strains (17Reifenberger E.

https://openalex.org/W2028494050,"The Tax oncoprotein of human T cell leukemia virus type 1 constitutively activates transcription factor NF-κB by a mechanism involving Tax-induced phosphorylation of IκBα, a labile cytoplasmic inhibitor of NF-κB. To trigger this signaling cascade, Tax associates stably with and persistently activates a cellular IκB kinase (IKK) containing both catalytic (IKKα and IKKβ) and noncatalytic (IKKγ) subunits. We now demonstrate that IKKγ enables Tax to dock with the IKKβ catalytic subunit, resulting in chronic IκB kinase activation. Mutations in either IKKγ or Tax that prevent formation of these higher order Tax·IKK complexes also interfere with the ability of Tax to induce IKKβ catalytic function in vivo. Deletion mapping studies indicate that amino acids 1–100 of IKKγ are required for this Tax targeting function. Together, these findings identify IKKγ as an adaptor protein that directs the stable formation of pathologic Tax·IKK complexes in virally infected T cells."

Fibronectin is a large (440-kDa) glycoprotein composed of two nearly identical covalently linked subunits found in the extracellular matrix of many tissues. Each subunit is composed of multiple homologous domains termed fibronectin types I, II, and III in an array analogous to a “string of beads” (1Petersen T.E. Thogerson H.C. Skorstengaard K.

Two major classes of fibronectin have been described, cellular fibronectin and plasma fibronectin, which differ in the inclusion or exclusion of the alternatively spliced domains A, B, and V. Plasma fibronectin is produced by hepatocytes, lacks A and B domains, but possesses the V domain in one subunit; cellular fibronectin is produced by a number of cell types and contains various combinations of A, B, and V (4Sekiguchi K.

Fibronectin is thought to be crucial for making the primitive extracellular matrix and for cellular adhesion, migration, and differentiation (7Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag, New York, NY1990Crossref Google Scholar). Underscoring the importance of fibronectin, gene knockout leads to early embryonic lethality (8George E.L. Georges-Labouesse E.N. Patel-King R.S. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. Development. 1993; 119: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of a fibronectin molecule is diagrammed in Fig.1 as a scale model with an integrin and the cell membrane. The molecule is composed primarily of 15 fibronectin type III (FN-III) domains plus the alternatively spliced A and B domains, which are also type III. Following the nomenclature of Leahyet al. (3Leahy D.J. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), we will use the abbreviation FN7–10 to designate the segment containing FN-III domains 7 through 10. Other segments will be named accordingly. FN7–14+A will indicate that the segment includes domain A (at its natural location between FN11 and -12). The conformation of plasma fibronectin is dependent upon the pH and ionic environment (9Alexander Jr., S.S. Colonna G. Edelhoch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1501-1505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Williams E.C. Janmey P.A. Ferry J.D. Mosher D.F. J. Biol.

At physiological pH and salt concentrations and at lower ionic strength, plasma fibronectin exists in a compact conformation that sediments at 10–13.5 S. However, at increased pH or salt concentration, plasma fibronectin undergoes a reversible expansion to produce an extended conformation sedimenting at 6–8 S (9Alexander Jr., S.S. Colonna G.

This expansion occurs without any significant changes in secondary or tertiary structure (12Markovic Z. Lustig A. Engel J. Richter H. Hormann H. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1983; 364: 1795-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 13Lai C.-S. Tooney N.M. Ankel E.G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6393-6397Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Erickson and Carrell (11Erickson H.P. Carrell N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14539-14544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used rotary shadowing electron microscopy to show that the fibronectin molecule in the extended conformation appeared as an extended thin strand with a few bends, whereas in the compact conformation the strand was substantially more bent and folded upon itself. These images of the fibronectin molecule in the two conformations provide the basis for understanding the transition. The transition between fibronectin's extended and compact conformations requires a flexibility in the links between domains as well as ionic interactions to generate the compact conformation. Erickson and Carrell (11Erickson H.P. Carrell N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14539-14544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) originally proposed that all the links between FN-III domains were more or less flexible and that the important ionic interactions occurred at domain interfaces. An alternative model postulates that most of the links between FN-III domains are rigid but that there are a few specific hinge regions where the molecule can bend, leading to specific bonding of one segment of the fibronectin dimer to another segment on the same or opposite subunit (10Williams E.C.

Plasma fibronectin contains a number of cryptic activities revealed after proteolysis or through the use of recombinant fragments. For example, a 75-kDa fragment containing the central cell binding domain had a higher apparent affinity for cells (presumably the integrin receptors) than did intact plasma fibronectin (17Akiyama S.K. Hasegawa E. Hasegawa T. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13256-13260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, cell spreading was enhanced for large fragments (146 kDa, 113 kDa, or 75 kDa) from the central region of plasma fibronectin, relative to intact plasma fibronectin (18Hayashi M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3332-3340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These experiments were performed under physiological pH and salt concentrations (150 mm), conditions in which plasma fibronectin is in a compact conformation (19Rocco M. Aresu O. Zardi L. FEBS Lett. 1984; 178: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), suggesting that the compact conformation of plasma fibronectin suppresses its biological activity. Given the large amount of fibronectin in blood, perhaps fibronectin's compact conformation curbs the wanton activation of integrins on circulating blood cells and endothelial cells. Some isoforms of cellular fibronectin contain the alternatively spliced A domain. Expression of A is up-regulated during embryogenesis, wound healing, and tumor progression (7Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag, New York, NY1990Crossref Google Scholar). Manabe et al. (20Manabe R. Oh-e N. Maeda T. Fukuda T. Sekiguchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) showed that inclusion of A augmented the binding of fibronectin to α5β1 integrin as well as the spreading of cells on fibronectin. The activity of A was only realized in the context of intact fibronectin because the isolated A domain had no augmentation activity. These data suggested that A produced a conformational change in the compact form of fibronectin that exposed the integrin binding site. We sought to determine the domain(s) responsible for plasma fibronectin's compact conformation. We show here that FN12–14 is necessary to mediate fibronectin intersubunit dimerization and interacts with FN2–3. Similarly, the A domain is shown to interact with FN12–14, providing a structural mechanism for the functional effects of the A domain. Thermolysin (protease, Type X), gelatin-Sepharose, and heparin-agarose were obtained from Sigma; ExpandTM High Fidelity PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; FN-III, fibronectin type III domain; FN7–10, fibronectin type III domains 7 through 10; rFN wild-type, full-length recombinant fibronectin; ΔFN12–14, fibronectin with FN12–14 deleted; FNTNA1–A3, fibronectin with FN12–14 replaced with tenascin C FN-III domains A1–A3; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PIPES, piperazine-N,N′-bis-(2-ethanesulfonic acid); Δs , change in sedimentation coefficient; Hep1, heparin binding domain nearest to fibronectin's amino terminus polymerase and dispase I from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Pfu polymerase from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), and Superose 6, Mono S, Mono Q, Resource Q, and cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B chromatography media from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Sweden). Bovine fibronectin was purified from citrated serum by elution from a gelatin-Sepharose column with 4 m urea, according to standard procedures (21Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. Int. J. Cancer. 1977; 20: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). For experiments with nonpurified fragments, fibronectin was incubated with 5 μg/mg thermolysin in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.2% NaN3 (digestion buffer) for 4 or 24 h at room temperature. Four-hour digestion resulted in major fragments of 150 kDa (FN2–15+V) and 140 kDa (FN2–14) whereas 24-h digestion gave major fragments of 140 kDa (FN2–14) and 110 kDa (FN2–11) (22Castellani P. Siri A. Rosellini C. Infusini E. Borsi L. Zardi L. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1671-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Digestion was terminated by adding EDTA to 5 mm. For purification of FN2–11, plasma fibronectin was digested overnight with thermolysin. This mixture was then applied sequentially to heparin-agarose and gelatin-Sepharose affinity columns, with FN2–11 appearing in the flow-through from both columns. FN2–11 was dialyzed against 1 mm PIPES, pH 7, 20 mm NaCl, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −70 °C until use. For purification of FN2–14, plasma fibronectin was incubated with 5 μg/mg Dispase I for 1 h in digestion buffer. This mixture was passed over a heparin-agarose column and eluted with 500 mm NaCl. After dialysis against 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, peak eluted fractions were applied to a Resource Q column and eluted with a 0–500 mm linear NaCl gradient. FN2–14 was dialyzed against 1 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 20 mm NaCl, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −70 °C until use. The identities of proteolytic fragments were confirmed by Western blotting. Complete cloning details are available upon request. Standard molecular biological procedures were used (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All bacterially produced fragments were expressed by inserting PCR fragments into the pET11b expression vector (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI). PCR reactions used ExpandTM High Fidelity polymerase. A human fibronectin cDNA (hFN-IIIfull), spanning from theNsiI site to the ScaI site in the fibronectin cDNA, was prepared by several ligations of fragments derived from the following cDNAs: pFH1, pFH154, pFH134, and lF10 (24Kornblihtt A.R. Umezawa K. Vibe-Pedersen K. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1755-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 25Carnemolla B. Leprini A. Querze G. Urbini S. Zardi L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 745-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 26.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). All ligations and the final hFN-IIIfull construct were verified by restriction analysis. hFN-IIIfull was used as a PCR template for bacterially expressed fibronectin fragments not containing the A domain. All forward primers contained an NdeI site just upstream of the first codon for ligation into pET11b. Reverse primer for FN12–14 contained an in-frame stop codon followed by aBamHI site; because there is a BamHI site in FN9, reverse primers for FN7–14, FN4–14, and FN2–14 contained an in-frame stop codon followed by an NdeI site. Forward primer for FN2–11 also contained a SacII site upstream of theNdeI site, whereas FN2–11 reverse primer contained an in-frame stop codon followed by a SmaI site. Because the reverse primer for FN2–11 did not contain an NdeI site, FN2–11 PCR product was first cloned into pGEM5 as anSacII-SmaI fragment and then recovered from the vector as an NdeI-NdeI fragment. FN12–14 was cloned into pET11b as an NdeI-BamHI PCR fragment. FN7–14, FN4–14, FN2–11, and FN2–14 were cloned asNdeI-NdeI PCR fragments; the correct orientation was selected by restriction mapping. FN7–10 was produced as described previously (3Leahy D.J. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Expression vectors containing the A domain were made by replacing a fragment between FN7 and FN12 in the FN7–14 expression vector with a fragment containing the FNA coding sequence. A silent SpeI site was introduced into FN11 during the cloning procedures. To produce FN2–14+A, an FNA-containing fragment from FN7–14+A was cloned into the FN2–14 expression vector. FNA and FN12–14+A expression vectors were produced by PCR amplification using FN2–14+A expression vector as template. We used a baculovirus expression system to produce full-length wild-type fibronectin (rFN wild-type), fibronectin in which FN-III domains 12–14 were deleted (ΔFN12–14), and fibronectin in which FN12–14 had been replaced by tenascin C FN-III domains A1–A3 (FNTNA1–A3). These constructs were produced from a full-length chimeric rat/human cDNA in pVL1393 baculovirus expression vector (a gift of Dr. Jean Schwarzbauer, Princeton University). In this vector, the first five type I repeats are rat (from nucleotides 186–1152 as in GenBankTM accession number X15906) whereas the remainder of the sequence is human (from nucleotides 864–7031 as in GenBankTM accession number A14133). Production of ΔFN12–14 fibronectin in pVL1393 involved two PCR amplifications using Pfu polymerase to generate an SpeI site (encoding amino acids TS) replacing FN12–14, followed by several ligation steps. Restriction analysis was used to verify each cloning step as well as the final vector. FNTNA1–A3 was constructed by inserting anSpeI PCR fragment (using a human tenascin C template andPfu polymerase) containing FN-III domains A1–A3 from human tenascin into the SpeI site of ΔFN12–14. This resulted in an insertion of the 6-base pair SpeI sequence at both ends of TNA1–A3. Two types of sedimentation experiments were performed with recombinant fibronectin fragments. The first type, velocity sedimentation, does not require highly purified preparations because the data are analyzed by examining SDS-PAGE gels. However, the second type, equilibrium sedimentation, does require highly purified samples to obtain reliable data. Some of the proteins in this study (FNA, FN12–14, FN12–14+A, and FN4–14) could not be produced with sufficient purity to use for equilibrium sedimentation analysis. All proteins expressed in BL21 cells were soluble; however, the highly expressed proteins, FN12–14, FN12–14+A, and FNA, contained significant amounts of insoluble protein after bacterial lysis. Proteins were purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation from bacterial supernatants followed by combinations of Resource or Mono Q, Mono S, and gel filtration chromatography. A complete description of purification procedures is available upon request. The amounts of protein recovered varied with FN12–14 being the highest (yield of 2.5 mg/liter) and FN4–14 the lowest (yield of 0.5 mg/liter). Fibronectins expressed in baculovirus were prepared by cotransfection of Sf9 cells with the fibronectin-containing pVL1393 and Baculo Gold (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) vectors. Culture supernatants containing recombinant virus were used to infect High Five cells grown in Express Five media (Life Technologies, Inc.). High Five cells do not produce endogenous fibronectin. After culturing for 3 days, fibronectins were purified from the culture supernatant by gelatin-Sepharose chromatography (21Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. Int. J. Cancer. 1977; 20: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). Apparent sedimentation coefficients (s) were determined by velocity sedimentation through 5-ml 15–40% glycerol gradients. Gradients were buffered using 1 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, and contained either 20 mmNaCl (low salt) or 200 mm NaCl (high salt). These salt concentrations produce near maximal changes in fibronectin sedimentation through glycerol gradients (11Erickson H.P. Carrell N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14539-14544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each gradient was overlaid with 200-μl samples containing a fibronectin fragment at a concentration between 200 and 500 μg/ml. Ovalbumin (3.5 S), bovine serum albumin (4.6 S), aldolase (7.3 S), and/or catalase (11.3 S) were included in each sample as internal standards. The samples were centrifuged between 34,000 and 50,000 rpm (depending upon the expecteds value of the various fibronectin fragments) for 16 h in a Beckman SW-50.1 rotor at 20 °C. Following collection of 13 fractions and SDS-PAGE analysis, s values were determined by comparing the sample peaks to the standard peaks. For proteins expressed in baculovirus, sedimentation fractions were analyzed by Western blotting to detect fibronectins, in addition to silver staining the gel. s values determined in different runs were reproducible to about ± 0.2 S. Equilibrium sedimentation was performed in a Beckman XL-A analytic ultracentrifuge. 200-μl samples, containing purified fibronectin fragments at concentrations between 200 and 400 μg/ml, in 1 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, with either 20 mm NaCl (low salt) or 500 mm NaCl (high salt), were used. Because glycerol has an effect similar to salt on fibronectin sedimentation (2Rocco M. Carson N. Hantgan R. McDonagh J. Hermans J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14545-14555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,27Lai C.-S. Wolff C.E. Novello D. Griffone L. Cuniberti C. Molina F. Rocco M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 625-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the NaCl concentration used for equilibrium sedimentation under high salt conditions (500 mm) was greater than that used for velocity sedimentation (200 mm). Sedimentation was performed between 5000 and 10,000 rpm at 4 or 20 °C. Base lines, obtained by centrifuging samples at high speed, were subtracted from the measurements. The resulting absorbance profiles were fit to a single molecular species using software provided with the centrifuge. 2 mg of purified FN2–11 was coupled to 0.5 ml of cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purified FN7–10 and FN7–14 were combined in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and passed through the column. The column was washed with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and bound protein eluted with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. In trying to determine which portions of fibronectin mediate its compact conformation, our initial experiments examined the sedimentation of plasma fibronectin proteolytic fragments generated by thermolysin or dispase I. Thermolysin digestion of bovine fibronectin produced major bands of 110 kDa, 140 kDa, and 150 kDa, which represent FN2–11, FN2–14, and FN2–15+V, respectively, whereas dispase I digestion resulted in primarily FN2–14 (22Castellani P. Siri A. Rosellini C. Infusini E. Borsi L. Zardi L. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1671-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). TableI shows the sedimentation coefficients for bovine fibronectin fragments FN2–11, FN2–14, and FN2–15+V determined in 1 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, buffered 15–40% glycerol gradients containing either 200 mm NaCl (high salt) or 20 mm NaCl (low salt). Purified FN2–11 and FN2–14 produced results indistinguishable from unpurified fragments. Sedimentation coefficients in high salt were similar for the three fragments but in low salt were substantially increased for FN2–15+V and FN2–14 but only moderately increased for FN2–11. Therefore, the presence of the FN12–14 domain within proteolytic fragments of FN2–14 and FN2–15+V was required to produce a substantial salt-dependent increase in sedimentation coefficient.Table IVelocity sedimentation of bovine fibronectin proteolytic fragmentsFragments in high salts in low saltΔsFN2–15+V4.87.52.7FN2–144.76.82.1FN2–114.24.60.4Measurements were obtained from 15–40% glycerol gradients containing 1 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, and either 20 mm NaCl (low salt) or 200 mm NaCl (high salt). Open table in a new tab Measurements were obtained from 15–40% glycerol gradients containing 1 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, and either 20 mm NaCl (low salt) or 200 mm NaCl (high salt). To determine the role of FN12–14 in the increased sedimentation coefficient of FN2–14, a selection of recombinant fragments within the FN2–14 region was produced in bacteria using the pET system. Sedimentation coefficients of the fragments (FN2–14, FN4–14, FN7–14, FN12–14, and FN2–11) in high and low salt glycerol gradients are shown in Table II. Recombinant FN2–14 showed a substantial change in s(Δs = 1.3), similar to its proteolytic counterpart (Δs = 2.1). This indicates that glycosylation is not required to produce the salt-induced sedimentation change; however, the smaller Δs value for recombinant FN2–14 suggests that glycosylation may enhance the salt effect. Similar to proteolytic FN2–11, recombinant FN2–11 showed only a small change in s (Δs = 0.5) compared with FN2–14. FN12–14 alone showed no salt-induced change in sedimentation properties. Likewise, recombinant fragments having incremental deletion from the amino terminus of FN2–14 exhibited only modest salt-induced changes in sedimentation coefficient. FN7–14 had a Δs of 0.7 whereas FN4–14 displayed a Δs of 0.5. These data suggest that FN2–3, like FN12–14, is required to produce the sedimentation change seen in FN2–14.Table IIVelocity sedimentation of bacterially expressed recombinant human fibronectin fragments without the alternatively spliced A domainFragments in high salts in low saltΔsFN2–144.55.81.3FN2–114.04.50.5FN4–144.34.80.5FN7–143.74.40.7FN12–142.42.40.0Measurements were obtained from 15–40% glycerol gradients containing 1 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, and either 20 mm NaCl (low salt) or 200 mm NaCl (high salt). Open table in a new tab Measurements were obtained from 15–40% glycerol gradients containing 1 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, and either 20 mm NaCl (low salt) or 200 mm NaCl (high salt). The salt-induced sedimentation change shown by recombinant FN2–14 could be explained by two mechanisms. First, FN2–14 may fold upon itself via an intramolecular interaction or second, may undergo intermolecular dimerization. To determine which mechanism was operating, the molecular weight of FN2–14 in low and high salt was determined by equilibrium sedimentation in 1 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, containing either 500 mm NaCl (high salt) or 20 mm NaCl (low salt) (Fig. 2). In high salt, FN2–14 had a molecular mass of 129 kDa, in good agreement with the expected molecular mass of a FN2–14 monomer. In low salt, FN2–14 had a molecular mass of 262 kDa, consistent with a dimer. Therefore, FN2–14 undergoes intermolecular bonding rather than folding upon itself in low salt. In contrast to FN2–14, the molecular masses of FN7–14 and FN2–11 indicated monomers at both high and low salt (Fig. 2). Because our velocity sedimentation had suggested the dimerization was due to an interaction of FN2–3 with FN12–14 we tried to demonstrate this by sedimenting a mixture of FN2–11 and FN7–14. However sedimentation equilibrium showed no indication of heterodimers at either high or low salt. We then decided to use an affinity column to look for weaker associations. Fig. 3shows an experiment passing a mixture of FN7–10 and FN7–14 over an affinity matrix of FN2–11. In very low salt (20 mm Tris), the FN7–14 bound completely to the column whereas FN7–10 did not. The FN7–14 was eluted by 500 mm NaCl. A later experiment showed that 50 mm NaCl was sufficient to completely elute FN7–14. We also found that FN12–14 bound completely to the FN2–11 column in 20 mm Tris and was eluted by 50 mmNaCl (data not shown). We conclude that a single FN12–14 can bind to FN2–11, presumably to the FN2–3 segment, in low salt, but the interaction is substantially weaker than the dimerization of full-length FN2–14. Because the previous experiments were accomplished with portions of the fibronectin molecule, it remained to be determined what role FN12–14 performed in mediating the compact conformation within the context of the entire fibronectin molecule. Because Type I and II domains contain a number of disulfide bonds, we chose to express full-length and FN12–14-deleted fibronectin in baculovirus. Unlike native fibronectin in which only one subunit contains the V domain, this baculovirus expression produces fibronectin having V in both subunits. Two constructs with FN12–14 deleted as well as full-length “wild-type” (rFN wild-type) were produced. In the first construct (ΔFN12–14), the amino acid sequence “TS” (rendered from an inserted SpeI site) replaced FN12–14. In the second construct (FNTNA1–A3), the segment FN12–14 was replaced with type III domains A1 to A3 from human tenascin-C. Following baculovirus expression, all samples were analyzed by silver stain SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions (Fig.4). They all showed a single sharp band in the reduced lane; in nonreduced lanes, the most prominent band was at the position of a dimer. Each of the recombinant proteins showed a small fraction of monomer in the nonreduced lanes, but this was judged to be less than one-fourth of the total. These results indicate that fibronectins expressed in baculovirus were mostly intact dimers. FNTNA1–A3 migrated significantly slower on SDS-PAGE than either bovine plasma fibronectin or rFN wild-type. This is likely due to anomalous migration of FNTNA1–A3, because PCR and restriction analysis of the expression construct indicated that only one A1–A3 segment was inserted (data not shown). These recombinant fibronectins were sedimented through glycerol gradients, and fractions were analyzed by silver stain SDS-PAGE and by immunoblotting for fibronectin. Each sample was sedimented with standards in the same tube, and the s value of fibronectin was estimated by linear interpolation between catalase (11.3 S) and bovine serum albumin (4.6 S). Sedimentation coefficients are given in Table III. Like plasma fibronectin, rFN wild-type showed the characteristic shift from 9.5 S in high salt to 12.6 S in low salt. The two mutant constructs with deleted or substituted FN12–14 domains sedimented at 8.4–8.6 S in high salt, suggesting that they have a more open conformation than rFN wild-type. Moreover, these constructs showed only a small (ΔFN12–14) or no (FNTNA1–A3) increase in s at low salt. We conclude that the compact conformation is substantially or completely inhibited for FN missing the FN-III domains 12–14 or having them replaced with FN-III do"

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11615-11618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), which can form micelle-type aggregates, were shown to function as molecular chaperones. It is long known that casein in bovine skim milk remains as large (40–300 nm) stable micelles (21Waugh D.F. McKenzie H.A. Milk Proteins : Chemistry and Molecular Biology. 2. Academic Press, New York1971: 3-79Google Scholar). Bovine milk contains about 78% casein, of which 65% is α-casein. More than 75% of α-casein is Ca+2-sensitive and called αs-casein (22Jenness R. McKenzie H.A. Milk Proteins : Chemistry and Molecular Biology. 1. Academic Press, New York1970: 17-40Google Scholar). The rest is Ca+2-insensitive and is mainly κ-casein. αs-Casein has a molecular mass of 23.6 kDa (23Kinsella J.E. CRC Crit. Rev. Food Sci. Nutr. 1984; 21: 197-262Crossref Scopus (534) Google Scholar). It is present in the milk of all mammals as a random coil protein (24Susi H. Timasheff S.N. Stevens L. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5460-5466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Creamer L.K. Richardson T. Parry D.A.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 211: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and is the major protein constituent of casein micelle (21Waugh D.F. McKenzie H.A. Milk Proteins : Chemistry and Molecular Biology. 2. Academic Press, New York1971: 3-79Google Scholar). In the absence of Ca+2 ions, it is a highly soluble protein. Despite its unorganized secondary and tertiary structure, there are similarities between αs-casein and other known chaperones in their tendency to self-associate into micelle-like aggregate. This prompted us to test if αs-casein possessed any chaperone-like behavior. In this paper we report for the first time that a random coil protein αs-casein can prevent in vitro the thermal aggregation of whey proteins from milk as well as the aggregation of a variety of unrelated proteins/enzymes caused by thermal-, chemical-, and light-induced stress. We also show that unlike other chaperones, αs-casein can solubilize hydrophobically aggregated proteins and possesses some features similar to the cold shock proteins (CSP). 1The abbreviations used are: CSP, cold shock proteins; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DTT, dithiothreitol; WPI, whey protein isolate αs-Casein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), rhodanese, insulin, carbonic anhydrase, alcohol dehydrogenase from equine lever, and citrate synthase were purchased from Sigma. Whey protein isolate (WPI) was obtained from Le Sueur Isolates (Le Sueur, MN). Dithiothreitol (DTT) was purchased from Sisco Research Laboratory, India. Reagents used for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were from Fisher. All reagents used for making buffer solutions were of analytical grade. Freshly excised bovine eyes were obtained from a local slaughterhouse. The lenses were surgically removed and homogenized in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 m NaCl and 0.02% (w/v) NaN3. The homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then loaded to a Sephacryl S-300 column (1.5 cm × 90 cm). Five distinct peaks corresponding to high molecular weight α (αH-), low molecular weight α (αL-), high molecular weight β (βH-), low molecular weight β (βL-), and γ-crystallin were obtained. Pooled fractions were stored at −20 °C until use. Only βL- and γ-crystallin were used in the present study. Thermally induced aggregation of proteins was measured in a Shimadzu UV-2401PC spectrophotometer fitted with thermostatic cell holder assembly with electronic temperature control. Protein solution and buffer with or without αs-casein were mixed in the cuvette at room temperature and then placed in the thermostatic cell holder, and the apparent absorbance at 400 nm was monitored as a function of time. Aggregation of insulin was assayed as described by us earlier (26Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Briefly, insulin was dissolved in a minimum volume of 0.02m NaOH and immediately diluted in 10 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The aggregation of insulin B-chain was initiated by adding to insulin solution (0.35 mg/ml) DTT (from a 500 mm stock solution) to a final concentration of 20 mm. The extent of aggregation was followed by measuring apparent absorbance because of light scattering at 400 nm. The ultraviolet light-induced aggregation of γ-crystallin (27Bhattacharyya J. Das K.P. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Intl. 1998; 46: 249-258PubMed Google Scholar, 28Raman B. Rao Ch.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27264-27268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was followed in a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorometer by setting both excitation and emission wavelengths at 295 nm with excitation and emission slits of 10 and 5 mm, respectively. The gel filtration of the samples was performed using a prepacked column (1 × 30 cm) of Suparose 12 attached to a fast protein liquid chromatography system of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Protein samples with or without αs-casein were first heated at the given temperature and immediately put on ice to bring the temperature to 25 °C. The solution was filtered through a 0.22-μm filter before 100 μl of it was loaded onto the column equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer of pH 7.0. Elution was carried out at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Samples were monitored by their absorbance at 280 nm. Prevention of thermal aggregation of substrate proteins by molecular chaperones is a commonly used method for in vitroassay of their activity. When solutions of substrate proteins such as alcohol dehydrogenase, carbonic anhydrase, and β-crystallin are heated at 40, 60, and 60 °C, respectively, the solutions get turbid because of the formation of large aggregates. Fig.1 shows the kinetic traces of the apparent absorbance at 400 nm of these proteins in the presence and absence of αs-casein. In the absence of αs-casein, the substrates at the respective temperatures undergo denaturation followed by aggregation. However in the presence of αs-casein, aggregation was suppressed. Approximately 92% protection was found at a 1:1 (w/w) ratio of alcohol dehydrogenase:αs-casein (Fig. 1 A). Complete protection occurred at a 1:1.5 (w/w) ratio of alcohol dehydrogenase:αs-casein, corresponding to a mole ratio of 1:4. In the case of β-crystallin (Fig. 1 B), complete suppression of aggregation required a β-crystallin:casein weight ratio 1:0.3 (1:0.6 molar ratio). At 1:3.5 weight ratio between carbonic anhydrase and αs-casein, 90% protection was obtained (Fig. 1 C), and complete protection required approximately a 1:5 molar ratio (data not shown). αs-Casein was also effective in preventing thermal aggregation of a number of other proteins, including citrate synthase, γ-crystallin, and rhodanese (data not shown). Milk contains a number of globular proteins such as β-lactoglobulin, α-lactalbumin, BSA, etc., collectively called whey proteins, which are highly sensitive to temperature, pH, and other conditions (22Jenness R. McKenzie H.A. Milk Proteins : Chemistry and Molecular Biology. 1. Academic Press, New York1970: 17-40Google Scholar, 23Kinsella J.E. CRC Crit. Rev. Food Sci. Nutr. 1984; 21: 197-262Crossref Scopus (534) Google Scholar,29Morr C.V. Ha E.Y.W. Crit. Rev. Food Sci. Nutr. 1993; 33: 431-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). WPI is a mixture of these proteins (about 20% of total milk proteins), which remain in the milk serum after removal of casein (29Morr C.V. Ha E.Y.W. Crit. Rev. Food Sci. Nutr. 1993; 33: 431-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). When 0.5 mg/ml WPI solution in phosphate buffer, pH 6.6, is heated to 70 °C, the solution develops visible turbidity with time because of aggregation (Fig. 2 A, trace1). The presence of 0.4 mg/ml αs-casein completely prevents this aggregation (Fig. 2 A, trace2). Similarly, when 0.5 mg/ml BSA solution at pH 6.6 was heated at 70 °C, a low level of scattering was visible because of aggregated proteins (Fig. 2 B, trace 1). The presence of 0.5 mg/ml completely prevents the formation of scattering BSA particles (Fig. 2 B, trace 2). Our results show that αs-casein not only prevents the aggregation of unrelated proteins but also protects its natural substrates in vivo against thermal aggregation. Early work by Morr and co-workers (30Morr C.V. Josephson R.V. J. Dairy Sci. 1968; 51: 1349-1355Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 31Kenkare D.B. Morr C.V. Gould I.A. J. Dairy Sci. 1964; 47: 947-952Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (19) Google Scholar) also clearly demonstrated that whole casein prevented gross heat-induced aggregation of whey proteins through nonspecific interaction, even in calcium-containing systems. Many investigators (32Ruegg M. Moor U. Blanc B. J Dairy Res. 1977; 44: 509-515Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 33De Wit J.N. Klarenbeck G. Hontelez-Backx E. Neth.

Food Chem. 1991; 39: 2147-2155Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar) have extensively studied the thermal aggregation properties of whey proteins. It is well known that the major whey proteins β-lactoglobulin, α-lactalbumin, and BSA have disulfide bridges, and the former two have free thiol groups as well (21Waugh D.F. McKenzie H.A. Milk Proteins : Chemistry and Molecular Biology. 2. Academic Press, New York1971: 3-79Google Scholar, 22Jenness R. McKenzie H.A. Milk Proteins : Chemistry and Molecular Biology. 1. Academic Press, New York1970: 17-40Google Scholar, 23Kinsella J.E. CRC Crit. Rev. Food Sci. Nutr. 1984; 21: 197-262Crossref Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 29Morr C.V. Ha E.Y.W. Crit. Rev. Food Sci. Nutr. 1993; 33: 431-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). It was shown that thermal aggregation of whey protein was caused by a combination of hydrophobic as well as thiol-disulfide interchange reactions (34Xiang Y.L. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1992; 40: 380-384Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 35Gezimati J. Singh H. Creamer L.K. ACS Symp. Ser. 1996; 650: 113-123Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 36Dalgleish D.G. van Mourik L. Corredig M. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1997; 45: 4806-4813Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 37Dalgleish D.G. Senaratne V. Francois S. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1997; 45: 3459-3464Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 38Laligant A. Dumay E. Valencia C.C. Cuq J.L. Cheftel J.C. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1991; 39: 2147-2155Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). αs-Casein, being a highly hydrophobic protein, interacts instantly with the exposed hydrophobic groups of denaturing proteins, preventing aggregation. However we feel that the lack of disulfide bridges and free thiol groups in αs-casein sequence (39Mercier J.C. Grosclaude F. Dumas B.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 23: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) is another very important and unique feature that plays a significant role in inhibiting thiol-disulfide interchange reactions. These covalent reactions require close contact of appropriate residues, and αs-casein creates a nonreactive barrier by placing itself between the whey proteins. Whey proteins under various conditions are also known to form soluble aggregates, which apparently cannot be detected by the light-scattering technique we have employed as the aggregation assay method. To check if αs-casein can prevent formation of soluble aggregates of appreciable size, we have employed a gel filtration assay using fast protein liquid chromatography. Although α-lactalbumin does not aggregate on its own on heating, it is known to form soluble aggregates in the presence of β-lactoglobulin in the early stages of heat treatment (36Dalgleish D.G. van Mourik L. Corredig M. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1997; 45: 4806-4813Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 37Dalgleish D.G. Senaratne V. Francois S. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1997; 45: 3459-3464Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A mixture of α-lactalbumin (2 mg/ml) and β-lactoglobulin (2 mg/ml) at pH 7.0 was heated to 70 °C for 5 min and rapidly cooled to room temperature. The sample on gel filtration showed the presence of aggregated species of molecular mass in excess of 300 kDa eluting at the void volume, unreacted proteins corresponding to dimeric β-lactoglobulin (36.5 kDa), monomeric α-lactalbumin (14.4 kDa), and some intermediate aggregates centered around molecular masses of approximately 100–120 kDa (Fig.3, trace 1). In the presence of αs-casein (4 mg/ml), a considerable reduction in the high molecular mass species was observed, and most of the proteins was eluted in a relatively single peak centered around 60 kDa. In presence of 6 mg/ml casein, no trace of any species of more than ∼80 kDa was observed. This clearly shows that in presence of sufficient quantity of αs-casein formation of soluble aggregates of any appreciable size is prevented. For nonthermal aggregation of substrate proteins, insulin became a popular choice for as the assay system, because reduction of disulfide bond by DTT leads to aggregation of its B-chain at room temperature (16Guha S. Manna T.K. Das K.P. Bhattacharyya B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30077-30080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 26Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 40Farahbakhsh Z.T. Huang Q.L. Ding L.L. Altenbach C. Steinhoff H.J. Horwitz J. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Like other chaperones, αs-casein also can prevent disulfide cleavage-induced aggregation of insulin at 27 °C, requiring a 1:0.35 weight ratio between insulin and αs-casein for complete prevention of aggregation (Fig.4, inset). Using this assay system, we investigated the effect of temperature on its chaperoning efficiency. Fig. 4 shows the bar diagram of the percentage protection of insulin aggregation with αs-casein (1:0.035 w/w ratio) at 37, 27, 22, and 18 °C. At 37, 27, and 22 °C, the suppression of aggregation is 39, 52, and 90%, respectively, whereas there was complete protection against insulin aggregation at 18 °C at the same ratio. This finding was in sharp contrast to the behavior of other known chaperones such as α-crystallin, tubulin, etc., whose activity were generally found to increase with the increase of temperature (16Guha S. Manna T.K. Das K.P. Bhattacharyya B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30077-30080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 26Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 27Bhattacharyya J. Das K.P. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Intl. 1998; 46: 249-258PubMed Google Scholar). Also unlike other chaperones (16Guha S. Manna T.K. Das K.P. Bhattacharyya B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30077-30080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 26Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 27Bhattacharyya J. Das K.P. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Intl. 1998; 46: 249-258PubMed Google Scholar), preheating of αs-casein solution to 50 °C for 30 min and cooling back to 27 °C did not alter its chaperone efficiency. αs-Casein can also prevent other nonthermal aggregation of proteins as well such as those induced by UV light. The eye lens protein γ-crystallin in solution on being exposed to UV light (295 nm) becomes turbid because of aggregation (27Bhattacharyya J. Das K.P. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Intl. 1998; 46: 249-258PubMed Google Scholar, 28Raman B. Rao Ch.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27264-27268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like the chaperone-like α-crystallin, αs-casein also can prevent this aggregation (Fig. 5). Complete prevention requires a 1:2 weight ratio between α-crystallin and αs-casein, corresponding to a molar ratio of ∼1:0.7. It is known that molecular chaperones bind only aggregation-prone conformers of the substrate protein but do not interact with native proteins or proteins that have already aggregated (41Wang K. Spector A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13601-13608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test if αs-casein acted similarly, we started an insulin aggregation reaction by adding DTT to it, and when nearly 50% aggregation occurred, we added αs-casein to the reaction mixture. Our results show that αs-casein not only prevented further aggregation of insulin, but unlike other known chaperones, it also slowly solubilized the already-aggregated insulin (Fig. 6). It has also been observed that GroEL can prevent aggregation of substrate proteins both on the unfolding and refolding pathway (42Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 43Wang J.D. Michelitsch M.D. Weissman J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12163-12168Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (e.g. on dilution from 6 m guanidine hydrochloride solution). However, unlike GroEL but like α-crystallin (42Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), αs-casein can effectively prevent aggregation in the unfolding pathway but fails to prevent aggregation completely on the refolding pathway (data not shown). We have thus identified αs-casein, which exits in nature as an unfolded random coil protein, as having chaperone-like functions. Like all other known chaperones, it can prevent irreversible aggregation of proteins induced by thermal as well as nonthermal stress by providing hydrophobic surfaces to unfolding proteins. The important features responsible for its chaperone-like activity are (i) its high hydrophobicity characterized by Bigelow's parameter of 1170 (44Bigelow C.C. J. Theor. Biol. 1967; 16: 187-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) along with high estimated net negative charge of about 22 at pH 6.5 (39Mercier J.C. Grosclaude F. Dumas B.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 23: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), (ii) its highly flexible nature because of the relatively high amount (8.5%) of proline residues distributed uniformly throughout the chain (29Morr C.V. Ha E.Y.W. Crit. Rev. Food Sci. Nutr. 1993; 33: 431-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 39Mercier J.C. Grosclaude F. Dumas B.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 23: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), (iii) its lack of a cystine residue in the sequence (39Mercier J.C. Grosclaude F. Dumas B.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 23: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Interestingly αs-casein possesses a few features similar to that of the CSP. Generally CSPs in bacteria have higher levels of expression following a cold shock (45Graumann P. Marahiel M.A. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 166: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and play a major regulatory role in the activation (46Jones P.G. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) and physiology of adaptation to low temperature (45Graumann P. Marahiel M.A. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 166: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Similarly greater amounts of αs-casein are found in mammals of the low temperature zones such as reindeer (47McMeekin T.L. Polis B.D. Adv. Protein Chem. 1949; 5: 201-228Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar), moose, yak, etc. compared with mammals living in other temperature zones (21Waugh D.F. McKenzie H.A. Milk Proteins : Chemistry and Molecular Biology. 2. Academic Press, New York1971: 3-79Google Scholar). CSPs are known to be devoid of disulfide bonds in their sequence (48Reid K.L. Rodriguez H.M. Hiller B.J. Gregoret L.M. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 470-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and so is αs-casein (39Mercier J.C. Grosclaude F. Dumas B.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 23: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). These similarities between αs-casein and CSPs of prokaryotes might suggest that αs-casein act as a CSP in eukaryotes. It is now recognized that molecular chaperones, all of which are known to date, are folded protein molecules and provide guidance to newly synthesized peptides through the folding process, and their presence is essential for cell survival (1Sigler P.B. Xu Z. Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 581-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 2Netzer W.J. Hartl F.U. Trends Biochem.

Science. 1996; 272: 1448-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). How the chaperones themselves get folded, however, remains a mystery. It is too early to say if αs-casein in vivo may help fold other proteins. It has very recently been shown that cyclophilin was able to refold properly from the unfolded state in the presence of α-casein (43Wang J.D. Michelitsch M.D. Weissman J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12163-12168Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The discovery of RNA chaperones is considered to be of vital importance because their early appearance in the evolution is believed to have made the transition from RNA to a protein/RNA world by rescuing the RNA from possible kinetic trap (49Herschlag D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20871-20874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). It has recently been hypothesized that proteins in the early stages of evolution of life were unfolded proteins, which through long evolutionary process ultimately became folded (50Doi N. Yanagawa H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 150-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Our observation for the first time that a commonly occurring unfolded protein αs-casein can function as a molecular chaperone may be significant in understanding this aspect."

The role of protein kinase C (PKC) in UVB-induced signal transduction is not well understood. This study showed that UVB markedly induced translocation of membrane-associated PKCε and PKCδ, but not PKCα, from cytosol to membrane. Dominant negative mutant (DNM) PKCε or PKCδ inhibited UVB-induced translocation of PKCε and PKCδ, respectively. UVB-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (Erks) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs) was strongly inhibited by DNM PKCε and PKCδ, whereas the DNM of PKCα was less effective on the UVB-induced phosphorylation of Erks and JNKs. Among the PKC inhibitors used only rottlerin, a selective inhibitor of PKCδ, markedly inhibited the UVB-induced activation of Erks and JNKs, but not p38 kinases. Safingol, a selective inhibitor for PKCα, did not show any inhibitory effect on UVB-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. GF109203X is a stronger inhibitor of classical PKC than novel PKC. Lower concentrations of GF109203X (<10 μm) had no effect on UVB-induced activation of Erks or JNKs. However, at higher concentrations (over 20 μm), GF109203X inhibited UVB-induced activation of JNKs, Erks, and even p38 kinases. Meanwhile, rottlerin and GF109203X markedly inhibited UVB-induced apoptosis of JB6 cells, whereas safingol had little inhibitory effect. DNM-Erk2 cells and PD98059, a selective inhibitor for mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 that directly activates Erks, inhibited UVB-induced apoptosis. DNM-JNK1 cells also blocked UVB-induced apoptosis, whereas SB202190, a specific inhibitor for p38 kinases, did not produce the inhibitory effect. These data demonstrate that PKCδ and PKCε, but not PKCα, mediate UVB-induced signal transduction and apoptosis in JB6 cells through activation of Erks and JNKs. UV-induced signal transduction may be involved in tumor promotion and induction of apoptosis. The role of protein kinase C (PKC) in UVB-induced signal transduction is not well understood.

UV radiation from the sun is the major environmental factor responsible for a high incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancer (1Fry R.J. Ley R.D.

The electromagnetic spectrum of UV can be divided into three parts: UVA (320–400 nm), UVB (290–320 nm), and UVC (100–290 nm) (2Matsui M.S. Mintz E. DeLeo V.A. Mukhtar H. Skin Cancer: Mechanisms and Human Relevance. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 21-30Google Scholar). In animal experiments, both UVB and UVC can act as complete carcinogens, whereas UVA can only act as a tumor promoter (2Matsui M.S. Mintz E. DeLeo V.A. Mukhtar H.

Because UVC light does not penetrate the atmosphere (2Matsui M.S. Mintz E. DeLeo V.A. Mukhtar H. Skin Cancer: Mechanisms and Human Relevance. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 21-30Google Scholar), UVB radiation is believed to be responsible for most of the carcinogenic effects of sun exposure (2Matsui M.S. Mintz E. DeLeo V.A. Mukhtar H.

Because of the importance of these genes in growth and differentiation, a DNA-damaging effect has been proposed as the mechanism of UV-induced initiation (2Matsui M.S. Mintz E. DeLeo V.A. Mukhtar H.

A number of reports have established that UVC and UVB induce certain gene expression (13Adler V. Schaffer A. Kim J. Dolan L. Ronai Z. J. Biol.

There are two transcription factor complexes implicated in mediating the UV response, AP-1 and NFκB (18Radler-Pohl A. Sachsenmaier C. Gebel S. Auer H.P. Bruder J.T. Rapp U. Angel P. Rahmsdorf H.J.

In light of the important role of AP-1 and NFκB activation in apoptosis and tumor promotion, the UV-induced signal transduction pathways may be involved in the UV-induced apoptosis and tumor promotion (18Radler-Pohl A.

Very recently, we demonstrated that atypical PKC is involved in UV-induced AP-1 activation, whereas the epidermal growth factor receptor is not required for UV-induced signal transduction (15Huang C. Ma W.Y. Dong Z. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1945-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 24Huang C. Ma W.-y. Bowden G.T. Dong Z. J. Biol.

In the present study, we investigated whether other types of PKC isozymes of classical PKC or novel PKC are activated and/or involved in UVB-induced signal transduction and apoptosis. Eagle's minimum essential medium (EMEM) and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were from Whittaker Biosciences;l-glutamine was from Life Technologies, Inc.; gentamicin was from Quality Biological, Inc.; luciferase assay substrate was from Promega. Aprotinin and leupeptin were from Sigma; rottlerin, GF109203X, and safingol were from Calbiochem. The phosphospecific antibodies against phosphorylated sites of Erks, JNKs, and p38 kinase were from New England Biolabs; the antibodies against protein kinase C subtypes were from Santa Cruz. UVB irradiation was performed on serum-starved monolayer cultures utilizing a transluminator emitting UVB. Because the normal UVB lamp also generates a small amount of UVC light, the UVB irradiation was carried out in a UVB exposure chamber fitted with a Kodak Kodacel K6808 filter that eliminates all wavelengths below 290 nm (14Huang C.

Mouse epidermal JB6 promotion sensitive Cl 41 and its dominant negative mutant cell lines for PKCα, PKCε, and PKCδ were grown at 37 °C in EMEM supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mml-glutamine, and 25 mg/ml gentamicin (25Huang C.

Cl 41 PKCα-DNM and PKCε-DNM, the stable transfectants with dominant negative PKCα and PKCε, were established and reported previously (26Huang C. Ma W.-y. Dong Z. Cell.

JB6 promotion sensitive cells, Cl 41, were cultured in a 6-well plate until they reached 85–90% confluence. We used 0.3 μg of cytomegalovirus-neo vector and 2 μg of AP-1 luciferase plasmid with 6 μg of a dominant negative mutant of PKCδ plasmids or vector PεMTH plasmid DNA and 15 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent to transfect each well in the absence of serum. After 10–12 h, the medium was replaced with 5% FBS/MEM. Approximately 30–60 h after the beginning of the transfection, the cells were treated with 0.033% trypsin, and the cell suspensions were transferred to 75-ml culture flasks and cultured for 24–28 days with geneticin selection (300 μg/ml). Stable transfectants were screened by Western blotting with rabbit polyclonal IgG against PKCα, PKCε, and PKCδ. The stable transfectants and PKCδ-DNM were cultured in geneticin-free EMEM for at least two passages before each experiment (26Huang C. Ma W.-y. Dong Z. Cell. Signalling. 1998; 10: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). 2 × 105 cells were seeded in a 10-cm dish. After they reached 85–90% confluence, the cells were starved for 24–48 h in 0.1% FBS. After irradiation, the cells were washed one time with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (without Ca2+). Two hundred μl of homogenization buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) was added to each dish, and the cells were scraped into a 1.5-ml tube with a rubber policeman. The suspension was sonicated for 10 s at output 4 with a sonicator (Ultrasonics Inc., NY) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected as the cytosol fraction. The pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of homogenization buffer B (1% Triton X-100 in buffer A) and sonicated for 10 s. The suspension was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected as a membrane fraction. Protein concentration of each sample was determined, and 100 μl of 3× Laemmli sample buffer (187.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 6% SDS, 30% glycerol, 150 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3% bromphenol blue) was added (29Olivier A.R. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2758-2763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples containing equal amount of protein were loaded in each lane for 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was transferred and analyzed as described previously (30Dong Z. Huang C. Brown R.E. Ma W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9962-9970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Immunoblots for phosphorylated proteins of p38 kinases, Erks, and JNKs were carried out using phosphospecific mitogen-activated protein kinase antibodies against phosphorylated sites of p38, Erks and JNKs as described previously (30Dong Z. Huang C. Brown R.E. Ma W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9962-9970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Antibodies for phosphorylated MAP kinases were from New England Biolabs, and antibodies for PKC subtypes were from Santa Cruz. Antibody-bound proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL of New England Biolabs or ECF of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and analyzed using the Storm 840 (Molecular Dynamics). Cells were grown in a 15 cm-dish and treated with various PKC inhibitors and UVB irradiation when cell density reached 50–70% confluence. Both detached and attached cells were harvested by scraping and centrifuging. Then the cells were lysed with lysis buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mmEDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100) on ice for 45 min. Fragmented DNA in the supernatant after centrifugation at 14,000 rpm (45 min at 4 °C) was extracted twice with phenol/chloroform/isopropanol (25:24:1, v/v) and once with chloroform and then precipitated with ethanol and 5m NaCl. The DNA pellet was washed once with 70% ethanol and resuspended in Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) with 100 μg/ml RNase at 37 °C for 2 h. The DNA fragments were separated by 1.8% agarose gel electrophoresis (31Sun Y. Bian J. Wang Y. Jacobs C. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 32Huang C.S. Ma W.-y. Li J.X. Hecht S.S. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4102-4106PubMed Google Scholar). JNKs, Erks, and p38 kinase activities were assayed as described previously (25Huang C. Ma W.-y. Ryan C.A. Dong Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11957-11962Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Translocation of PKC to a particulate fraction is the key step for the activation of this enzyme (33Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 973-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Determination of PKC content in membranes or the ratio of membranes to cytosol can reflect PKC activity. The following three PKCs can be dominantly detected in JB6 cells: PKCα, PKCε, and PKCδ (15Huang C. Ma W.Y. Dong Z. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1945-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To investigate whether these PKCs are involved in UVB-induced signal transduction, we analyzed the membrane/cytosol distribution of the three main subtypes of PKC in JB6 cells (15Huang C. Ma W.Y. Dong Z. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1945-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate was used as a positive control for stimulating PKC translocation. Our results showed that UVB markedly induced the translocation of PKCε and PKCδ, but not PKCα, from cytosol to membrane. The UVB-induced PKCε and PKCδ translocation was dose-dependent (Fig.1) and reached a high level 5–15 min after UVB irradiation (Fig. 2).Figure 2The time course of PKC α, PKC ε, and PKC δ translocation by UVB. JB6 Cl 41 cells (2 × 105) were cultured in monolayer in 10-cm dishes until 90% confluent. Then the cells were starved for 48 h in 0.1% FBS/EMEM. The cells were harvested at 5, 15, and 30 min after UVB irradiation at 8 kJ/m2. The membrane and cytosol fractions were obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures” and were analyzed by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. The same membrane was stripped and reprobed with the different isotype-specific antibodies. The immunoblots were visualized using the ECF detection reagents and scanned by Storm imager. The experiments were repeated three times and similar results were obtained. A, Western blotting. B, blots were scanned and quantified by Storm 840. Each value is the relative ratio of membrane to cytosol PKC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The above results suggest that PKCε and PKCδ, but not PKCα, were involved in mediating UVB-induced signal transduction. To address this question, we used JB6 stable transfectants with the DNM of PKCε, PKCα, or PKCδ (26Huang C. Ma W.-y. Dong Z. Cell. Signalling. 1998; 10: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These DNMs were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of lysine residues in the ATP binding site (located in the catalytic domain) (26Huang C. Ma W.-y. Dong Z. Cell. Signalling. 1998; 10: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The protein level of PKCδ in these transfectants was determined using rabbit polyclonal IgG against PKCδ. The results showed a high level of the introduced mutated protein of PKCδ in this transfectant (Fig. 3). Fig.4 showed that the DNM PKCε or PKCδ blocked UVB-induced translocation of PKCε and PKCδ, respectively. Further, we have analyzed the effect of these dominant negative PKC mutants on the UVB-induced activation of Erks, JNKs, and p38 kinases. We found that the total protein content of Erks, JNKs, and p38 kinases in three DNM PKC transfectants was lower than in Cl 41 cells, although the equal volume in each sample was loaded (Fig.5). Further, we demonstrated that the total protein in each sample was equal by dying the blotting membrane with Coomassie Blue (data not shown). However, UVB-induced phosphorylation of Erks and JNKs was strongly inhibited by DNM PKCε and PKCδ, whereas the DNM of PKCα was less effective on the UVB-induced phosphorylation of Erks and JNKs. The results suggest that the DNM of PKCε or PKCδ, but not the DNM of PKCα, inhibited UVB-induced activation of Erks and JNKs, but not p38 kinases.Figure 4Effect of DNM PKC δ and DNM PKC ε on UVB-induced PKC translocation. JB6 Cl 41 cells and Cl 41 stable transfectants with DNM PKCδ and DNM PKCε (2 × 105) were cultured in monolayer in 10-cm dishes until 90% confluent. Then the cells were starved for 48 h in 0.1% FBS/EMEM. The cells were harvested at 5, 15, and 30 min after UVB irradiation at 8 kJ/m2. The samples were fractionated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The samples were analyzed by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. The same membrane was stripped and reprobed with the different isotype-specific antibodies. The immunoblots were visualized using the ECF detection reagents and scanned by Storm imager. Each value is the relative ratio of membrane to cytosol PKC. This is one of three similar experiments. A, relative ratio of membrane to cytosol PKCδ. B, relative ratio of membrane to cytosol PKCε.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5Effect of DNM PKC α, PKC δ, and PKC ε on UVB-induced phosphorylation of Erks, JNKs, and p38 kinases. JB6 Cl 41 cells and Cl 41 stable transfectants with DNM PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCε (5 × 104/well) were cultured in monolayer in 6-well plates until 90% confluent. The cells were harvested at different times after UVB irradiation at 8 kJ/m2 as indicated. The samples were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies for nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated Erk, JNK, and p38 proteins using a PhosphoPlus MAP kinase kit from New England Biolabs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Further, we also compared protein phosphorylation and enzyme activity of MAP kinases after treatment with UVB. The results in Fig.6 showed that the phosphorylation of MAP kinases induced by UVB is well correlated with the activity of these kinases. It has been reported that some PKC inhibitors can selectively inhibit certain PKC isozymes without inhibiting other subtypes of PKC or other protein kinases (34Gschwendt M. Muller H.J. Kielbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). The above results suggest that the role of PKC in mediating UVB stimulation is isozyme-specific. We therefore used several PKC inhibitors to investigate the role of these PKC subtypes on UVB-induced MAP kinase activity. GF109203X is an inhibitor mainly of classical PKC and novel PKC (35Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26639-26648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 7 showed that rottlerin could markedly inhibit the UVB-induced phosphorylation of Erks and JNKs, but not p38 kinases. We also found that the protein levels of Erks and JNKs in rottlerin treatment groups were lower than in the control group, although the total p38 protein level was not affected. Safingol, the selective inhibitor for PKCα, did not inhibit UVB-induced activation of Erks, JNKs, or p38 kinases. At a low concentration of GF109203X (<10 μm) there was no effect on UVB-induced activation of Erks or JNKs (data not shown). However, higher concentrations of GF109203X (>20 μm) inhibited activation of all three MAP kinases (Fig. 7). Because the affinity of GF109203X on classical PKC is stronger than on novel PKC and it inhibits PKCε and PKCδ at higher concentrations, the results obtained using this inhibitor provide additional evidence that PKCε and PKCδ, but not PKCα, are involved in UVB-induced signal transduction. Based on these results, together with the effect of DNM of PKC, we conclude that the activation of PKCδ and PKCε, but not PKCα, plays an important role in mediating UVB-induced phosphorylation of Erks, JNKs, and p38 kinases. UV radiation is a strong inducer of cell apoptosis. We have found that UVB-induced apoptosis in JB6 cells is dose-dependent (data not shown). To further assess the biological significance of PKC in mediating the UVB-induced signal transduction, we investigated the role of PKC in UVB-induced apoptosis in JB6 cells. The results in Fig.8 show that UVB-induced apoptosis of JB6 cells was markedly inhibited by rottlerin and GF109203X, whereas safingol had little inhibitory effect. These results suggest that the regulation by PKC of UVB-induced signal transduction may mediate UVB-induced apoptosis. Because rottlerin inhibits UVB-induced Erks and JNKs, but not p38 kinases, and inhibits UVB-induced apoptosis, we hypothesize that Erks and JNKs, but not p38 kinases, play a role in mediating UVB-induced apoptosis. We therefore used PD98059, a selective inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase that is a specific upstream activator of Erks as well as dominant negative mutant Erk2, to investigate the role of Erks in UVB-induced apoptosis. We also used dominant negative mutant JNK1 and a selective inhibitor of p38 kinase, SB202190, to study the role of JNK1 and p38 kinases in UVB-induced apoptosis, respectively (Fig.9). The results showed that inhibiting Erk activation by PD98059 and DNM-Erks inhibited UVB-induced apoptosis. Further, cells expressing the dominant negative mutant of JNK1 also blocked UVB-induced apoptosis, whereas SB202190 was not inhibitory. The concentration of SB202190 applied in the apoptosis assay has been shown to inhibit the UV-induced phosphorylation of p38 kinases in JB6 cells. 2N. Chen, W.-y. Ma, C. Huang, and Z. Dong, manuscript submitted. These results suggest that Erk2 and JNK1, but not p38 kinases, mediate UVB-induced apoptosis. In the present work, we found that UVB irradiation induced PKCδ and PKCε, but not PKCα, translocation from cytosol to membrane and that this translocation was partially blocked in the cells that express DNM PKCδ or DNM PKCε. In cells transfected with DNM PKCε and PKCδ, UVB-induced phosphorylation of JNKs and Erks was markedly attenuated. A selective inhibitor of PKCδ completely blocked UVB-induced phosphorylation of JNKs and Erks, but not p38 kinases. However, the PKCα-specific inhibitor had no effect on the UVB-induced phosphorylation of MAP kinases (Erks, JNKs, and p38 kinases). These findings indicate that the UVB-induced phosphorylation of Erks and JNKs requires PKCδ and PKCε activation. PKC belongs to a large kinase family consisting of at least 11 members, which are divided into three groups on the basis of their biochemical properties and sequence homologies (38Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). The different PKC isotypes may have specific roles in signal transduction (39Schonwasser D.C. Marais R.M. Marshall C.J. Parker P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). It has been reported that PKC may be involved in UVA-induced signal transduction (40Petersen M. Hamilton T. Li H.L. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), but not UVC-induced signal transduction (23Sachsenmaier C. Radler-Pohl A. Zinck R. Nordheim A. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. Cell. 1994; 78: 963-972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Here, we used mouse epidermal JB6 cells to study the role of PKC in UVB-induced signal transduction. JB6 cells express PKCα, PKCε, and PKCδ (15Huang C. Ma W.Y. Dong Z. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1945-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and PKCε and PKCδ both belong to novel PKC (33Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 973-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 38Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). From our present results, it appears that membrane-bound PKCε and PKCδ were higher than PKCα before cells were stimulated. Upon UVB irradiation, PKCε and PKCδ, but not PKCα, were translocated to the particulate fraction. When the cells were treated with rottlerin, a specific antagonist for PKCδ (34Gschwendt M. Muller H.J. Kielbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar), UVB-induced phosphorylation of Erks and JNKs, but not p38 kinases, was markedly blocked. GF109203X, a potent inhibitor for PKCα and PKCε, produced an inhibitory effect on UVB-induced Erks or JNKs at a high concentration (20 μm). Safingol, a specific inhibitor of PKCα (37Sachs C.W. Safa A.R. Harrison S.D. Fine R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26639-26648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), did not display any inhibitory effect on these three MAP kinases. Cells transfected with the dominant negative mutants of PKCε or PKCδ inhibited the stimulation of Erks, JNKs, and p38 kinases induced by UVB. These results indicate that activated PKCε and PKCδ are necessary in mediating UVB-induced signal transduction. Activation of PKC is associated with the translocation of enzymes from the cytosol to the cell particulate fraction (41Kraft A.S. Anderson W.B. Cooper H.L. Sando J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13193-13196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). UVB stimulation of membrane-associated PKC could result from several possible mechanisms. The translocation of PKC is triggered by diacylglycerol or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate interacting with the C1 domain of the PKC protein (33Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 973-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). It was reported that UVB induces phospholipase A2 activation and arachidonic acid release (42Blackshear P.J. Nairn A.C. Kuo J.F. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2957-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), a reaction that also produces lysophospholipid. It has been found that lysophosphatidylcholine and arachidonic acid are also activators for PKC (42Blackshear P.J. Nairn A.C. Kuo J.F. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2957-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Punnonen and Yuspa (43Punnonen K. Yuspa S.H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) reported that UVB irradiation of cultured cells increases levels of diacylglycerol. On the other hand, UV energy generates oxygen radicals such as H2O2, which may activate PKC (44Cunningham M.L. Krinsky N.I. Giovanazzi S.M. Peak M.J. J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1985; 1: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 45Hayes G.R. Lockwood D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Commun. 1986; 139: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been reported that reactive oxygen species directly activate purified PKC in vitro (47Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6758-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). It is interesting that DNM PKCs decrease the total protein level of MAP kinases. We also found that rottlerin inhibits the total protein levels of Erks and JNKs, but not p38 kinases. The mechanisms of the inhibitory effect on MAP kinase protein level are currently under investigation in our laboratory. Considerable attention has recently been focused on the role played by different kinase cascades in the control of apoptosis. In the present report, we found that both rottlerin and GF109203X inhibited UVB-induced apoptosis. However, rottlerin blocked UV-induced Erks and JNKs, but not p38, whereas GF109203X can block all three MAP kinases. MAP kinase signaling cascades are involved in the many cellular responses, including apoptosis, to extracellular stimuli. For example, Jimenez et al. (48Jimenez L.A. Zanella C. Fung H. Janssen Y.M. Vacek P. Charland C. Goldberg J. Mossman B.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L1029-L1035PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 inhibitor PD98059 blocked asbestos-induced apoptosis in rat pleural mesothelial cells. Activation of JNKs plays a causal role in the induction of apoptosis in numerous cells when stimulated by some stresses, whereas the inhibition of the Erks pathway has been observed in a number of cell systems undergoing programmed cell death (49Berra E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10792-10797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that the inhibition of Erks or JNKs, but not p38 kinases, blocks UVB-induced apoptosis. This suggests that activation of PKCδ and PKCε and phosphorylation of Erks and JNKs, but not p38 kinases, are important in mediating UVB-induced apoptosis. In summary, UVB induces activation of PKCδ, PKCε, and MAP kinases in JB6 cells. Inhibition of PKCδ and PKCε blocks UVB-induced MAP kinases and apoptosis. We conclude that UVB-induced apoptosis appears to be mediated by PKCδ, PKCε, Erks, and JNKs. We thank Dr. Harald H. O. Schmid and Patricia C. Schmid for critical reading."

However, little is known of the oxygen binding properties of SNO-Hb or the effects of oxygen on transnitrosation between SNO-Hb and the dominant low molecular weight thiol in the red blood cell, GSH. These data are important as they would provide a biochemical framework to assess the physiological function of SNO-Hb. Our results demonstrate that SNO-Hb has a higher affinity for oxygen than native Hb. This implies that NO transfer from SNO-Hb in vivo would be limited to regions of extremely low oxygen tension if this were to occur from deoxygenated SNO-Hb. Furthermore, the kinetics of the transnitrosation reactions between GSH and SNO-Hb are relatively slow, making transfer of NO+ from SNO-Hb to GSH less likely as a mechanism to elicit vessel relaxation under conditions of low oxygen tension and over the circulatory lifetime of a given red blood cell. These data suggest that the reported oxygen-dependent promotion of S-nitrosation from SNO-Hb involves biochemical mechanisms that are not intrinsic to the Hb molecule.

These data suggest that the reported oxygen-dependent promotion of S-nitrosation from SNO-Hb involves biochemical mechanisms that are not intrinsic to the Hb molecule. The main function of Hb is transporting oxygen from the lungs to respiring tissues. Oxygen is released when Hb undergoes a conformational change from the “R” state (i.e.“relaxed” or high oxygen affinity form) to the “T” state (i.e. “tense” or low oxygen affinity form). Numerous allosteric mechanisms are present that regulate oxygen delivery by either increasing or decreasing the oxygen affinity of Hb. These include regulation by pH, carbon dioxide, and inorganic phosphates (1Kilmartin J.V. Br. Med. Bull. 1976; 32: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,2Benesch R. Benesch R.E. Nature. 1969; 221: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). For example, by binding to the T state, which results in stabilization of this conformer, phosphates such as adenosine triphosphate or 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate decrease the oxygen affinity of whole blood relative to purified Hb. These physiological regulatory mechanisms work in concert to ensure that oxygen delivery satisfies metabolic demand. Efficient oxygen delivery is also a function of the amount of blood flowing through the arteries and arterioles, which, in turn, is regulated by the action of agents that cause either vasorelaxation or vasoconstriction. Nitric oxide is critical in vascular homeostasis and an important physiological modulator of blood flow due to its ability to cause vessel relaxation (3Palmer R.M.J. Ferridge A.G. Moncada S. Nature. 1987; 327: 524-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (9225) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide is synthesized in endothelial cells via the oxidation of l-arginine, a reaction catalyzed by the type III nitric-oxide synthase and stimulated by physiological processes such as blood flow over the endothelium (4Kulchan M.J. Jo H. Frangos J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C753-C758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once formed, NO diffuses to the underlying smooth muscle cells, where it binds rapidly to the heme group of the enzyme soluble guanylate cyclase. This activates the enzyme and sets up a sequence of events eventually resulting in relaxation of the vessel (5Ignarro L.J. Degnan J.N. Baricos W.H. Kadowitz P.J. Wolin M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 718: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 6Traylor T.G. Sharma V.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2847-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 7Lincoln T.M. Cornwell T.L.

A controversial aspect of this hypothesis is that NO rapidly reacts with oxy-Hb 1The abbreviations used are: oxy-Hb, oxygenated hemoglobin; deoxy-Hb, deoxygenated hemoglobin; SNO-Hb, S-nitrosohemoglobin; deoxy-SNO-Hb, deoxygenatedS-nitrosohemoglobin; metHb, methemoglobin or ferric hemoglobin; GSNO, S-nitrosoglutathione; SNOC, S-nitrosocysteine; SNAP, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine; DTPA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography1The abbreviations used are: oxy-Hb, oxygenated hemoglobin; deoxy-Hb, deoxygenated hemoglobin; SNO-Hb, S-nitrosohemoglobin; deoxy-SNO-Hb, deoxygenatedS-nitrosohemoglobin; metHb, methemoglobin or ferric hemoglobin; GSNO, S-nitrosoglutathione; SNOC, S-nitrosocysteine; SNAP, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine; DTPA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography (k≈ 107–108m−1s−1) (10Antonini E. Brunori M. Haemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reaction with Ligands. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1971Google Scholar), and given the high intra-erythrocytic Hb concentration (5–10 mm heme), it is difficult to understand how any NO would be available to initiate the signaling pathway that results in relaxation of vascular smooth muscle (11Lancaster J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8137-8141Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Recent investigations suggest that, in part, the reaction of NO with the heme group of Hb is restricted by partitioning into the hydrophobic compartments of cell membranes, thus making diffusion of the free radical into the red blood cell the limiting process (12Liu X. Miller M.J. Joshi M.S. Sadowska-Krowicka H. Clark D.A. Lancaster Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18709-18713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). In addition, several investigators have suggested that, in vivo, NO is transported in the thiol-bound, oxidized, and more stable form of anS-nitrosothiol. These compounds are insensitive to a direct reaction with heme groups and have been detected in vivo as both proteins (e.g. S-nitrosoalbumin) and small thiol-containing amino acids or peptides (e.g. S-nitrosoglutathione) (13Jia L.

Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar, 14Stamler J.S. Jia L. Eu J.P. McMahon T.J. Denchenko I.T. Bonaventura J. Gernert K. Piantadosi C.A. Science. 1997; 276: 2034-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar) have recently proposed an intriguing hypothesis by which Hb can regulate blood flow and overcome problems associated with scavenging of NO by heme. A novel derivative of the heme protein,S-nitrosohemoglobin (SNO-Hb), was identified as a potential modulator of blood flow in vivo (13Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar), and further investigations have suggested a role for this protein in regulating fetal blood pressure as well (21Funai E.F. Davidson A. Seligman S.P. Finlay T.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 875-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). S-Nitrosohemoglobin is a derivative in which NO is covalently bonded to the cysteine residue at position 93 on the β-chain (Cys-β93) (22Ferranti P. Malorni A. Mamone G. Sannolo N. Marino G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The nitrosyl group bonded to this thiol may be reduced to NO, under certain conditions, to induce relaxation of pre-capillary vessels and to inhibit platelet aggregation (13Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar, 14Stamler J.S. Jia L. Eu J.P. McMahon T.J. Denchenko I.T. Bonaventura J. Gernert K. Piantadosi C.A.

It was suggested that when Hb is in the R conformational state, the S-nitroso (SNO) group is oriented toward the interior of the protein and stabilized by shielding from the aqueous phase. However, when Hb undergoes transition to the T conformational state, as has been shown to occur in pre-capillary networks, it was proposed that the SNO moiety becomes exposed to the solvent, thereby allowing transnitrosation to glutathione or other thiols present in the red blood cell. The subsequent formation ofS-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) may then promote vessel relaxation (13Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar, 14Stamler J.S. Jia L. Eu J.P. McMahon T.J. Denchenko I.T. Bonaventura J. Gernert K. Piantadosi C.A. Science. 1997; 276: 2034-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). In this way, SNO-Hb can increase blood flow and hence oxygen delivery at sites where it becomes deoxygenated.S-Nitrosohemoglobin offers a novel solution by which NO can modulate blood flow without the problems associated with Hb-dependent scavenging of NO. This hypothesis requires that NO be released following a decrease in the oxygen concentration and thus in the degree of Hb oxygenation in the pre-arterioles. Although it was demonstrated that ligand-induced allosteric changes in Hb affect S-nitrosation of Cys-β93, the published studies have not addressed the effect on the oxygen affinity of Hb. The level of S-nitrosation in vivo (<0.1% of oxy-Hb being S-nitrosated) is insignificant compared with the total oxy-Hb present in the erythrocyte (13Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effects of S-nitrosation on oxygen delivery to tissues are negligible. However, since the hypothesis requires that only the deoxygenated conformer of Hb release NO (13Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar,14Stamler J.S. Jia L. Eu J.P. McMahon T.J. Denchenko I.T. Bonaventura J. Gernert K. Piantadosi C.A. Science. 1997; 276: 2034-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar), then the oxygen affinity of SNO-Hb (despite its low concentration) is critical to the role of Hb as an NO carrier. This is an important issue because previous studies on the role of Cys-β93 have shown that blockage of the thiol via alkylation or the formation of mixed disulfides increases the oxygen affinity of Hb (24Riggs A. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1948-1954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Craescu C.T. Poyart C. Schaeffer C. Garel M.C. Kister J. Beuzard Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 261: 14710-14716Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Furthermore, the naturally occurring Hb variant Hb Okazaki, where Cys-β93 is substituted with an arginine residue, also has an increased oxygen affinity (26Harano K. Harano T. Shibata S. Ueda S. Mori H. Seki M. FEBS Lett. 1984; 173: 45-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Since the formation of SNO-Hb represents a physiologically relevant Hb derivative in which Cys-β93 is modified, we have examined the effect of S-nitrosation of Hb on its oxygen binding properties. In addition, it is not clear how the oxygen-sensitive mechanisms underlying conformation-dependent NO release function. It has been proposed that transnitrosation reactions between deoxy-SNO-Hb and GSH to form GSNO, the mediator necessary to elicit the vasorelaxant signal, occur. However, transnitrosation reactions are, in general, relatively slow, with the exact kinetics depending on the physiochemical properties of the specific thiols involved. We have therefore also examined the kinetics and equilibria of transnitrosation reactions between Hb and GSNO and fitted the results to a bimolecular reversible reaction. These data show that S-nitrosation increases the oxygen affinity of Hb, ensuring that if a Hb deoxygenation-sensitive mechanism of NO release exists, then SNO-Hb would only promote vasorelaxation at sites of very low oxygen concentrations, i.e. at sites where the Hb existed primarily in the deoxygenated state. Furthermore, the kinetics of the transnitrosation reaction between SNO-Hb and GSNO are too slow to explain the vasodilatatory effects of SNO-Hb. These data are discussed in the context of SNO-Hb as a potential modulator of blood flow. All reagents were purchased from Sigma. SNOC and SNAP were synthesized as previously reported (27$$Google Scholar). Human HbA was purified as described below. Human hemoglobin was prepared as described previously (10Antonini E. Brunori M. Haemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reaction with Ligands. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1971Google Scholar).S-Nitrosohemoglobin was synthesized by incubating oxy-Hb (200 μm; all stated Hb concentrations are in terms of heme) with SNOC (2 mm) at 20 °C for 20–40 min in 2% borate and 1 mm DTPA. In some experiments, SNAP was used instead of SNOC, in which case the incubation time was 1–2 h. All solutions were protected from light. Hb was separated from SNOC or SNAP by gel filtration using Sephadex G-25 (10 × 1 ml; pre-equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm DTPA, pH 7.4). When SNOC was used, ∼10–20% of the Hb was oxidized to methemoglobin (metHb). This was attributed to the small, but unavoidable concentration of nitrite remaining in our SNOC preparations. No significant metHb (measured by visible spectroscopy) was formed when SNAP was used. Oxy-Hb concentrations were determined by UV-visible spectroscopy using the extinction coefficient per heme group ε577 nm = 14.6 mm−1cm−1 (10Antonini E. Brunori M. Haemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reaction with Ligands. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1971Google Scholar). S-Nitrosation of Hb was quantified by the Saville reaction, with all mercury-dependent nitrite formation being protein-precipitable (13Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar, 27$$Google Scholar). Differing levels ofS-nitrosation were obtained by altering the incubation times between oxy-Hb and either SNOC or SNAP. Cys-β93 thiols on Hb were measured using either dithionitrobenzoic acid or 2,2′-dithionitropyridine (28Winterbourn C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Hb samples (5 μm heme) were incubated with dithionitrobenzoic acid or 2,2′-dithionitropyridine for 20 min at 20 °C, and absorbance at 412 or 386 nm, respectively, was measured. Reduced thiol concentrations were calculated using ε412 nm = 12 mm−1cm−1 or ε386 nm = 14 mm−1 cm−1. Oxygen binding curves of Hb and SNO-Hb were determined using a tonometer. Hemoglobin samples (30–50 μm heme, 3 ml) were incubated initially with a metHb reductase system (29Hayashi A. Suzuki T. Shin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 310: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) at 20 °C to remove metHb formed during synthesis of SNO-Hb. The metHb reductase system was found to have no effect on the oxygen affinities of Hb or on the stability of the SNO group (data not shown). Furthermore, similar results were obtained in instances when the metHb reductase system was not required,i.e. when SNAP was used to synthesize SNO-Hb. Complete reduction to oxy-Hb occurred within 20 min as determined spectrophotometrically. Hb samples were then deoxygenated until deoxy-Hb was formed (determined spectrophotometrically). Samples were deoxygenated untilA 560 nm/A 577 nm = 0.73–0.74. This value was determined from a spectrum of pure deoxy-Hb synthesized by addition of sodium dithionite to a solution of oxy-Hb. Deoxygenation was accompanied by a decrease in sample volume to between 1.5 and 2 ml. Aliquots of air (0.5–1 ml) were then injected into the tonometer, and the absorbance spectrum (500–700 nm) was recorded after each addition. Oxygen partial pressures were determined by measuring the atmospheric pressure at the time of the experiment using a digital barometer (Fisher). All oxygen binding curves were measured under identical conditions in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 250 μm DTPA at 20 °C and at a constant partial pressure of carbon dioxide. The effect of temperature was assessed by measuring the oxygen binding curve at either 20 or 37 °C. Once deoxygenated, Hb solutions were incubated at the required temperature in a spectrophotometer for 15 min before addition of air. The modulation of oxygen binding by inorganic phosphates was ascertained by adding inositol hexaphosphate at a 100-fold excess concentration relative to tetrameric Hb, prior to measurement of oxygen affinity. The effect of pH was assessed by conducting the experiments in 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer containing 250 μm DTPA at either pH 6.5 or 7.4. To monitor transnitrosation reactions between GSH and deoxy-SNO-Hb, Hb was first deoxygenated in a tonometer, and then GSH (at a concentration 25 times that of heme) was added anaerobically using a gas-tight syringe. Interactions with a mixture of oxygenated and deoxygenated forms were also evaluated by partially oxygenated SNO-Hb before addition of GSH. In either case, the effect of GSH on the oxygenation state of Hb was monitored continuously over 5 min by measuring the absorbance spectrum. In parallel experiments, GSNO formation was determined either immediately or 5 min after GSH addition by adding trichloroacetic acid (20% v/v) to Hb in the tonometer. The solution was then centrifuged to remove precipitated protein, and GSNO was measured in the supernatant by the Saville assay. The reaction between GSNO and either oxy-Hb or deoxy-Hb was also monitored by measuring the rate of loss of GSNO by HPLC. All experiments were performed in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 μm DTPA. GSNO concentrations were determined by HPLC using a reverse-phase Kromasil C18column (Alltech Associates, Inc.) and a mobile phase of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid/methanol (94:6). GSNO was detected spectrophotometrically at 210 nm using a diode array detector and quantified using authentic GSNO. The identity of GSNO was confirmed by analyzing the full UV-visible spectrum of the putative GSNO peak using the diode array detector. Transnitrosation reactions are second-order reversible reactions (Equation 1).A+B⇌C+DEquation 1 The kinetics of such processes can be described by two second-order rate constants: k f for the forward reaction and k r for the reverse reaction. The dependence of [A] on time (t) is given by Equation 2,[A]=P[A]∞([A]0+[A]∞+Q)+([A]0−[A]∞)([A]∞+Q)P([A]0+[A]∞+Q)−([A]0−[A]∞)Equation 2 with terms defined in Equations Equation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5, Equation 6.P=exp(kf(2t[A]∞(K−1)+Q(K−1))K)Equation 3 Q−K([B]0−[A]0)+2[A]0K−1Equation 4 [A]∞=(12(K−1))((K([B]0−[A]0)+2[A]0)2+4[A]02(K−1)Equation 5 −(K([B]0−[A]0)+2[A]0))K=kfkrEquation 6 The subscripts 0 and ∞ indicate the concentrations of reactants at zero time and infinite time, respectively. The data obtained were fitted to the above equations and rate constants for the forward and reverse reactions, i.e. k fand k r calculated. The oxygen affinities of Hb and SNO-Hb were determined using a tonometer. Fig.1 shows the absorbance spectra of Hb (panel A) and SNO-Hb (panel B) obtained when the corresponding deoxygenated derivatives were titrated with oxygen. In both cases, after removal of oxygen, a typical absorbance spectrum of deoxy-Hb was observed (λmax = 555 nm), which, upon addition of oxygen, gradually changed to give the spectrum of oxy-Hb (λmax = 544 and 577 nm). Isosbestic points at 524, 548, 569, and 585 nm were observed for both native Hb and SNO-Hb, indicating that nitrosation of Cys-β93 does not affect the spectral changes that occur upon oxygen binding to the heme. In addition, no spectral evidence of formation of nitrosylhemoglobin (i.e. NO bound to ferrous heme groups) was observed (with the methodology used, nitrosylation of ∼5% of the total heme would have been detectable). The total concentration of solvent-exposed thiols (i.e.NO-bound thiol + free thiol) was the anticipated 2 thiols/tetramer (Table I).Table IConcentration of the S-nitroso group and free thiols after reaction of Hb with SNAP or N-ethylmaleimideForm of HbSNO/tetramerReduced thiols/ tetramerTotal thiols (Cys-β93)/ per tetramerOxy-Hb1.91 ± 0.151.91 ± 0.15Oxy-SNO-Hb0.55 ± 0.141.45 ± 0.192Oxy-NEMaNEM, N-ethylmaleimide; ND, Not detectable.-HbNDThe free or S-nitrosated thiols in native oxy-Hb, oxy-SNO-Hb, or oxy-N-ethylmaleimide-Hb were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data shown are representative of SNO-Hb synthesized with varying degrees ofS-nitrosation.

The concentration of oxy-Hb for a given pO2 was calculated from the spectra shown in Fig. 1, and the oxygen binding curves for Hb and SNO-Hb were thus calculated and are shown in Fig.2A. Native Hb displayed a characteristic sigmoidal oxygen binding curve. S-Nitrosohemoglobin (0.98 SNO groups/tetramer) also had a sigmoidal oxygen binding curve, which was, however, left shifted compared with native Hb (Fig.2 A). These data show that, relative to native Hb, SNO-Hb has a higher oxygen affinity and therefore, under physiological conditions, requires an environment of substantially lower oxygen concentration before releasing oxygen via a deoxygenation-sensitive mechanism as described previously (13Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar, 14Stamler J.S. Jia L. Eu J.P. McMahon T.J. Denchenko I.T. Bonaventura J. Gernert K. Piantadosi C.A. Science. 1997; 276: 2034-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 B summarizes a series of experiments in which the oxygen affinities of Hb and SNO-Hb, with differing levels of S-nitrosation, were determined. Oxygen affinities were assessed by comparing the p 50values, i.e. the oxygen tensions at which 50% of the Hb was bound with oxygen. Unmodified Hb had a p 50 of 7 ± 0.12 mm Hg (mean ± S.E., n = 12). In each case, S-nitrosation of Hb significantly increased the oxygen affinity (indicated by a decrease in thep 50), with the p 50 of SNO-Hb (0.6 SNO group/tetramer, i.e. 30% of β93 thiols being S-nitrosated (this number refers to a distribution of SNO groups, as it is not possible to distinguish between specific populations of Hb containing 1 or 2 SNO groups/tetramer)) being 4.3 ± 0.27 mm Hg (mean ± S.E., n = 5). Interestingly, S-nitrosation of up to one of the Cys-β93 residues proportionately increased the oxygen affinity; however, further modification did not affect the oxygen affinity (Fig.2 B). Previous studies found that the SNO group of SNO-Hb was less stable when Hb was in the deoxygenated state, resulting in nitrosyl-Hb formation, and that this was related to the ability of deoxy-SNO-Hb to promote vasorelaxation (13Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar). Since the method used to determine the oxygen affinity involved initially deoxygenation followed by oxygenation, formation of nitrosyl-Hb would affect the results obtained. However, no spectral evidence of nitrosyl-Hb or metHb was seen during the deoxygenation-reoxygenation cycle. Furthermore, the concentration of S-nitrosation was measured before and after completion of the oxygen saturation curve. Over the time taken to deoxygenate and then to reoxygenate the Hb (∼20–30 min), no significant change in the concentration of the Cys-β93–NO adduct could be detected. Further analysis over longer time periods indicated that the rate of spontaneous decomposition of deoxy-SNO-Hb was ∼8 nm/min, representing 0.03% of the total bound NO/min in this preparation of SNO-Hb. From these results, we conclude that spontaneous release of NO from SNO-Hb is unlikely to be a physiologically relevant mechanism, where a given Hb molecule will be cycling between the oxygenated and deoxygenated forms on a time scale in the order of seconds. The increased oxygen affinity of SNO-Hb suggests that it is less likely than native Hb to become deoxygenated and hence release NO under physiological conditions. However, in vivo, numerous regulatory mechanisms modulate the oxygen binding affinity of Hb in the red blood cell. It is possible that S-nitrosation of Hb alters the sensitivity to the various allosteric regulatory mechanisms present such that SNO-Hb may be able to deliver oxygen under physiological conditions. We therefore tested the effects of pH, temperature, and inorganic phosphates on the oxygen affinity of SNO-Hb and compared it with that of native Hb. The effects on oxygen affinity of each of the allosteric modulators are shown in Table II and were determined by measuring the difference in log p 50 of SNO-Hb and Hb elicited by the different allosteric mediators. An increase in temperature is known to decrease the oxygen affinity and thus facilitate oxygen delivery. Table II shows that the change in logp 50 of Hb and SNO-Hb on increasing the temperature from 20 to 37 °C was the same. Inorganic phosphates decrease the oxygen affinity of Hb (1Kilmartin J.V. Br. Med. Bull. 1976; 32: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 2Benesch R. Benesch R.E. Nature. 1969; 221: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Inositol hexaphosphate induced similar increases in the p 50 of Hb and SNO-Hb, indicating that S-nitrosation of Cys-β93 does not affect binding of inorganic phosphates to Hb. Finally, we assessed the effect of pH (also called the Bohr effect). The relatively acidic conditions in respiring tissues lower the p 50 of oxygen binding by Hb, with the net result being oxygen delivery. This occurs in part through binding of protons to histidine residues present in both the α- and β-chains, a property that also serves to buffer plasma. Decreasing the pH from 7.4 to 6.5 decreased the oxygen affinities of both Hb and SNO-Hb to similar extents, with the effect being approximately equal for both forms of Hb (Table II). This shows that S-nitrosation does not significantly affect the binding and release of protons by Hb. It has b"

Development of anticancer-specific retinoids with improved clinical value is largely dependent on the understanding of the mechanistic basis of the pleiotropic activities induced by retinoids and their receptors.

Interaction between membrane and nuclear receptor signaling pathways mediated by RAR/AP-1 interaction may represent an important mechanism underlying the potent antineoplastic effects of retinoids. Because many of the AP-1 responsive genes, such as collagenases and stromelysins, are involved in cancer cell proliferation and transformation (28Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3279) Google Scholar), retinoids that specifically inhibit AP-1 activity may be therapeutically desirable because they may have reduced side effects associated with gene activation, but retain their anticancer activity. This is demonstrated by recent studies showing that retinoids that inhibit AP-1 activity but cannot induce transactivation of RARE-containing genes were able to inhibit TPA-induced transformation and the clonal growth of mouse epidermal JB6 cells (29Li J.J. Dong Z. Dawson M.I. Colburn N.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 483-489PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a group of anti-AP-1-specific retinoids inhibited the proliferation of lung and breast cancer cells but had impaired ability to induce differentiation of F-9 cells (25Fanjul A. Dawson M.I. Hobbs P.D. Jong L. Cameron J.F. Harlev E. Graupner G. Lu X.P Pfahl M. Nature. 1994; 372: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Each subtype of RARs has been implicated in the regulation of cancer development and the anticancer activities of retinoids. Translocation of the RARα gene is responsible for the development of acute promyelocytic leukemia (30Warrell Jr., R.P. De The H. Wang Z.-Y. Degos L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 177-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar), whereas RARγ may play a role in mediating growth inhibition and apoptosis by certain retinoids (31Fanjul A.N. Bouterfa H. Dawson M. Pfahl M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1571-1577PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, evidence is emerging showing that RARβ may play a critical role in the regulation of cancer cell growth. RARβ is located in chromosome 3p24, a region that is often deleted or mutated in a variety of cancer (32Kok K. Osinga J. Carritt B. Davis M.B. van der Hout A.H. van der Veen A.Y. Landsvater R.M. de Leij L.F.M.H. Berendsen H.H. Fostmus P.E. Poppema S. Buys C.H.C.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), and RARβ was found to be integrated by hepatitis B virus in human liver cancer (33Dejean A. Bougueleret L. Grzeschik K.-H. Tiollais P. Nature. 1986; 322: 70-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). It is not expressed in many different types of cancer cell lines (20Liu Y. Lee M.-O. Wang H.-G. Li Y. Hashimoto Y.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5663-5669PubMed Google Scholar), and re-expression of RARβ in RARβ-negative cancer cells restored the ability of RA to induce growth inhibition and apoptosis (20Liu Y. Lee M.-O. Wang H.-G. Li Y. Hashimoto Y. Klaus M. Reed J.C. Zhang X.-k. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1138-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Despite these studies, further investigation is needed to dissect function of each retinoid receptor in cancer cells. Several approaches have been used often to determine specific function of each receptor subtype, including loss of function, such as knock-out and antisense technique, and gain-of-function, such as ectopic expression of a receptor subtype. RAR subtype-selective agonists and antagonists are being developed (39Lehmann J.M. Dawson M.I. Hobbs P.D. Husmann M. Pfahl M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4804-4809PubMed Google Scholar, 40Lehmann J.M.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and they have been widely used to study the function of each receptor. However, the degree of selectivity and receptor transactivation activity needs to be improved. In addition, development of more and effective RARβ-selective retinoids is important to further study RARβ function in cancer. Furthermore, receptor-selective retinoids allow dissociation of desired and undesired effects of retinoids and are also believed to be more specific and with less toxicity in cancer prevention and treatment. To further study RARβ function in cancer cells, we analyzed a class of conformational restricted retinoids. Our data demonstrated that LE135, LE540, and LE550 inhibited all-trans-RA-induced transcriptional activation of RARβ but not RARα, RARγ, or RXRα on a number of RAREs, whereas LE511 selectively induced transactivation activity of RARβ. The RARβ-selective antagonist effect was further demonstrated by their ability to inhibit all-trans-RA-induced apoptosis of ZR-75-1 human breast cancer cells. Interestingly, the antagonists LE135 and LE540 also exert anti-AP-1 activity. They effectively repressed TPA-induced AP-1 activity in both HeLa and breast cancer cells when RARβ was expressed. In contrast, LE550 induced AP-1 activity in HeLa but not in breast cancer cells. Together our results demonstrate that a novel class of RARβ-selective retinoids with variable biological functions should represent useful tools for studying RARβ function. All-trans-RA was obtained from Sigma. LE135 was prepared as described by Eyrolles et al. (44Eyrolles L. Kagechika H. Kawachi E. Fukasawa H. Iijima T. Matsushima Y. Hashimoto Y. Shudo K. J. Med.

Monkey kidney CV-1 and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The receptor expression plasmids pECE-RARα, -RARβ, -RARγ, and -RXRα and the construction of the reporter plasmids βRARE-tk-CAT, TREpal-tk-CAT, CRBPI-RARE-tk-CAT, and ApoAI-RARE-tk-CAT have been described previously (15Zhang X.-k.

CV-1 cells were seeded at 5.0 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates. A modified calcium phosphate precipitation procedure was used for transient transfection as described previously (20Liu Y. Lee M.-O. Wang H.-G. Li Y. Hashimoto Y. Klaus M. Reed J.C. Zhang X.-k. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1138-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). 100 ng of reporter plasmid, 100 ng of β-galactosidase expression vector (pCH110, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and various amounts of receptor were mixed with carrier DNA (pBluescript, Stratagene) to 1,000 ng of total DNA/well. After 16–24 h, transfected cells were treated with or without 10−7m all-trans-RA in the absence or presence of the indicated concentrations of retinoid antagonists. For anti-AP-1 assay, a reporter construct containing the collagenase promoter linked with the CAT gene, -73-Col-CAT (23Yang-Yen H.F. Zhang X.-k. Graupner G. Tzukerman M. Sakamoto B. Karin M. Pfahl M. New Biol. 1991; 3: 1206-1219PubMed Google Scholar), was used in HeLa and ZR-75−1 cells. After transfection, cells were grown in a medium containing 0.5% charcoal-treated fetal calf serum with retinoids and/or TPA (100 ng/ml). Transfection efficiency was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. The data shown are the means of three separate experiments. Nuclear morphological change analysis and DNA fragmentation (TdT) assay were as described previously (20Liu Y. Lee M.-O. Wang H.-G. Li Y. Hashimoto Y. Klaus M. Reed J.C. Zhang X.-k. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1138-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 21Li Y. Dawson M.I. Agadir A. Lee M.O. Jong L. Hobbs P.D. Zhang X.K. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 75: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For nuclear morphological analysis, ZR-75-1 cells were treated with or without 10−7m all-trans-RA in the absence or presence of 10−6m LE135, LE540, or LE550 for 4 days, trypsinized, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, and stained with 50 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole containing 100 μg/ml DNase-free RNase A to visualize the nuclei. Stained cells were examined by fluorescent microscopy. For DNA fragmentation (TdT) assay, ZR-75-1 cells were treated with or without 10−7mall-trans-RA in the absence or presence of 10−6m LE135, LE540, or LE550. After 3 days, cells were trypsinized, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 1% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 70% ice-cold ethanol, and immediately stored at −20 °C overnight. Cells were then labeled with biotin-16-dUTP by terminal transferase and stained with avidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The labeled cells were analyzed using a FACScater-Plus. Representative histograms are shown. Recently, we designed several retinoid antagonists, LE135, LE511, LE540, and LE550 (49Eyrolles L. Kawachi E. Matsushime Y. Nakajima O. Kagechika H. Hashimoto Y. Shudo K. Med. Chem. Res. 1992; 2: 361-367Google Scholar, 50Kaneko S. Kagechika H. Kawachi E. Hashimoto Y. Shudo K. Med. Chem. Res. 1991; 1: 220-225Google Scholar), based on the structure-activity relationship of retinoids (Fig. 1). Transcriptional activation of these retinoids on RARα, RARβ, RARγ, or RXRα was determined by transient transfection assay using the reporter construct TREpal-tk-CAT (15Zhang X.-k. Hoffmann B. Tran P.B. Graupner G. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 355: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) in CV-1 cells. As shown in Fig.2, all-trans-RA strongly induced transcriptional activation of each RARs, whereas 9-cis-RA effectively promoted RXR homodimer activity. However, LE135, LE540, and LE550, at 10−7mand 10−6m, had very little effect on transcriptional activation of RARα, RARβ, RARγ, or RXRα. LE135 and LE540 even showed inhibitory effect on basal RARβ activity in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, LE511, a LE135 analog with bulky acyclic alkyl group, showed a strong induction of RARβ transactivation activity. Activation of RARβ could be observed when 10−7m LE511 was used, and it is about 65% of efficiency as compared with all-trans-RA. Together, these results demonstrate that LE135, LE540, and LE550 are ineffective on transcriptional activation of RARs and RXR, whereas LE511 is a RARβ-selective agonist.Figure 2Transcriptional activation profiles.Transcriptional activation activities of retinoids were determined on RARα, RARβ, RARγ, or RXRα receptors. CV-1 cells were transiently transfected with 100 ng of TREpal-tk-CAT reporter plasmid and 100 ng of RARα, RARβ, or RARγ or 20 ng of RXRα receptor expression plasmid. Transfected cells were grown in the absence or presence of the indicated concentrations of retinoids, and assayed for CAT activity after 24 h. 100% activity was the reporter gene activity measured in the presence of 10−6mall-trans-RA for RARs or 10−6m9-cis-RA for RXRα after subtraction of constitutive receptor activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) LE135 was previously shown to selectively bind to RARβ (44Eyrolles L. Kagechika H. Kawachi E. Fukasawa H. Iijima T. Matsushima Y. Hashimoto Y. Shudo K. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 1508-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The observations that LE135 could not induce RARβ transactivational activity and that it inhibited basal RARβ activity (Fig. 2) suggested that binding of RARβ by LE135 might repress its transactivation function. We therefore analyzed the effect of LE135 on all-trans-RA-induced transcriptional activation of RARβ on βRARE-tk-CAT reporter (19Hoffmann B. Lehmann J.M. Zhang X.-k. Hermann T. Graupner G. Pfahl M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1734-1743Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar). For comparison, its effect on RARα or RARγ was analyzed. As shown in Fig.3 a, 10−7m all-trans-RA-induced RARβ activity was strongly inhibited by LE135 in a concentration-dependent manner, with more than 70% inhibition when 10−6m LE135 was used. For comparison, RARα-selective antagonist Ro 41-5253 did not show any effect on RARβ activity. When RARα was analyzed, LE135 did not exhibit clear inhibitory effect on all-trans-RA-induced RARα activity, whereas Ro 41-5253 significantly repressed the reporter transcription. Both LE135 and Ro 41-5253 did not show any influence on all-trans-RA-induced RARγ activity. Similar results were obtained on another reporter, the TREpal-tk-CAT (Fig. 3 b and data not shown). Because RARβ is likely to function as RARβ/RXR heterodimer in cells, we determined whether LE135 could act as a RARβ/RXR heterodimer antagonist. As shown in Fig. 3 b, LE135 exhibited a similar degree of inhibition on both all-trans-RA-induced RARβ and RARβ/RXR heterodimer activity (Fig. 3 b), whereas it had no effect on 9-cis-RA-induced RXR homodimer activity. Similar results were obtained with LE540 (data not shown). Together, these data demonstrate that LE135 and LE540 are effective antagonist of RARβ and RARβ/RXR heterodimer. To further analyze the antagonist effect of LE135 and its analogs, reporter constructs containing different RAREs, including βRARE, CRBPI-RARE and ApoAI-RARE were used. As shown in Fig. 3 c, LE135, LE540, and LE550 inhibited all-trans-RA-induced RARβ transcriptional activation on these different RAREs. Similar degrees of inhibition (about 60–70%) were observed with the βRARE and the ApoAI-RARE, whereas a less degree of inhibition (50–60%) was obtained with the CRBPI-RARE. Interestingly, LE540 showed a more effective inhibition on all RAREs than its isomer LE550, consistent with their antagonist effect on HL-60 cell differentiation (45Umemiya H. Fukasawa H. Ebisawa M. Eyrolles L. Kawachi E. Eisenmann G. Gronemeyer H. Hashimoto Y. Shodo K. Kagechika H. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 4222-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that LE135, LE540, and LE550 could inhibit transactivation of RARβ and that the antagonistic effect of these retinoids is response element independent. We have previously demonstrated that expression of RARβ is required for all-trans-RA-induced apoptosis of human breast cancer cells (20Liu Y. Lee M.-O. Wang H.-G. Li Y. Hashimoto Y. Klaus M. Reed J.C. Zhang X.-k. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1138-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). We then analyzed whether inhibition of RARβ activity by RARβ-selective antagonists could repress all-trans-RA activity in ZR-75-1 human breast cancer cells. ZR-75-1 cells underwent extensive apoptosis when they were treated with all-trans-RA as revealed by both morphological analysis (DAPI staining) (Fig.4 a) and DNA end-labeling assay (TdT) (Fig. 4 b). However, all-trans-RA-induced apoptosis was strongly prevented when 10−7mall-trans-RA was used together with 10−6m of LE135, LE540, or LE550. Morphological analysis showed that all-trans-RA-induced apoptosis was reduced from about 40 to 20% by LE135, LE540, or LE550 (Fig. 4 a). Similar results were obtained by TdT assay (Fig. 4 b). These results are in agreement with previous observation made by ectopic expression of RARβ (20Liu Y. Lee M.-O. Wang H.-G. Li Y. Hashimoto Y. Klaus M. Reed J.C. Zhang X.-k. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1138-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), and suggest that these RARβ-selective antagonists are useful tools for studying RARβ function. Recently, it was reported that RA can inhibit AP-1 activity (22Pfahl M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) and that receptor conformational change required for AP-1 inhibition is different from that required for receptor transcriptional activation and they can be dissociated (25Fanjul A. Dawson M.I. Hobbs P.D. Jong L. Cameron J.F. Harlev E. Graupner G. Lu X.P Pfahl M. Nature. 1994; 372: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 26Chen J.Y. Penco S. Ostowski J. Balaguer P. Pons M. Starrett J.E. Reczek P. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 27Nagpal S. Atchanikar J. Chandraratna R.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 923-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To determine whether LE135, LE540, and LE550 could also induce RAR conformational changes for inhibiting AP-1 activity, we investigated their effect on TPA-induced AP-1 activity. When a reporter containing the collagenase (23Yang-Yen H.F. Zhang X.-k. Graupner G. Tzukerman M. Sakamoto B. Karin M. Pfahl M. New Biol. 1991; 3: 1206-1219PubMed Google Scholar) linked with the CAT gene, -73Col-CAT (23Yang-Yen H.F. Zhang X.-k. Graupner G. Tzukerman M. Sakamoto B. Karin M. Pfahl M. New Biol. 1991; 3: 1206-1219PubMed Google Scholar), was transiently transfected into HeLa cells, treatment of the cells with TPA strongly induced the reporter activity, consistent with previous observations. Co-treatment of the cells with either all-trans-RA, LE135, LE540, or LE550 did not show a clear effect on TPA-induced reporter activity (Fig. 5 a). However, when RARβ was cotransfected, the TPA-induced reporter transcription was slightly inhibited, which was further inhibited when cells were treated with all-trans-RA but not with LE135, LE540, and LE550. Interestingly, treatment with LE550 slightly enhanced reporter transcription. When RARβ and RXRα were cotransfected, however, LE135 and LE540 showed a strong inhibition of the TPA-induced reporter activity. The enhancing effect of LE550 was also increased. These data suggest that LE135 and LE540 could induce a conformational change of RARβ required for inhibiting AP-1 activity only when RARβ is heterodimerized with RXRα and that LE550 may induce another RARβ conformation that stimulates AP-1 transcriptional activity. To determine whether these retinoids could inhibit AP-1 activity in breast cancer cells, the -73Col-CAT was transiently transfected into ZR-75-1 cells (Fig. 5 b). Treatment of the cells with TPA led to an increase of reporter gene transcription for about 7-fold. Both LE135 and LE540 inhibited the TPA-induced activity in a concentration-dependent manner when RARβ expression vector was cotransfected. These data demonstrate that LE135 and LE540 could also inhibit AP-1 activity in breast cancer cells. The fact that LE135 and LE540 could inhibit the TPA-induced reporter transcription without RXRα cotransfection is consistent with observation that RXRα is expressed in ZR-75-1 cells (20Liu Y. Lee M.-O. Wang H.-G. Li Y. Hashimoto Y. Klaus M. Reed J.C. Zhang X.-k. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1138-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we did not observe any induction of the reporter activity when cells were treated with LE550, suggesting that the AP-1-inducing effect of LE550 is cell-type specific. Previous studies on receptor-ligand interaction have suggested requirements for being a potent retinoid antagonist: (i) strong binding to the receptor mediated by the hydrophobic alkylated benzo group of a retinoid contributes to its binding affinity to RARs and (ii) inhibition of the conformational changes, such as proper folding of the helix 12 where the binding site for co-activators (AF2 domain) exists. This has established structure-activity relationships in both retinoid agonists and antagonists. We describe here a class of related synthetic retinoids, LE135, LE540, LE511, and LE550, which either specifically activate or inhibit RARβ transactivation function. In assaying for transactivation function of the retinoids on each subtype of RARs and RXRα, LE511 selectively activated RARβ (Fig. 2), suggesting that it is a RARβ-selective agonist. In contrast, other LE compounds, LE135, LE540, and LE550, did not display any activation function on the retinoid receptors tested (Fig. 2). Instead, LE135 and LE540 showed a strong inhibition of RARβ basal transactivation activity. When they were used together with all-trans-RA, LE135 or LE540 effectively inhibited all-trans-RA-induced RXRα/RARβ activity (Fig. 3). LE135 does not bind to RXRs and RARγ in receptor binding assay (45Umemiya H. Fukasawa H. Ebisawa M. Eyrolles L. Kawachi E. Eisenmann G. Gronemeyer H. Hashimoto Y. Shodo K. Kagechika H. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 4222-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). It binds with higher affinity to RARβ (K i = 0.22 μm) than to RARα (K i = 1.4 μm) (45Umemiya H. Fukasawa H. Ebisawa M. Eyrolles L. Kawachi E. Eisenmann G. Gronemeyer H. Hashimoto Y. Shodo K. Kagechika H. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 4222-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Thus, LE135 and its related analog LE540 act as RARβ-selective antagonists. These results suggest that the tetramethyltetrahydronaphthalenyl group as seen in LE135, LE540, and LE550 may be required for RARβ antagonist effect, because its replacement with effective mono-tertiary butylphenyl group as seen in LE511 resulted in loss of RARβ antagonism effect (Fig. 3). The smaller hydrophobictert-butyl group of LE511 not only decreases the binding affinity to RARs but also may change the binding occupation in the ligand-RAR complex with less disturbance of the helix folding. This may explain the critical agonistic activity of LE511. The existence of another benzo (or naphtho) group impairs the transcriptional activating activity due to the different conformational change in the ligand-receptor complex. From the reported crystal structures of RXRα and RARγ (51Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 52Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar), proper folding of the helix 12 in the ligand-binding domain of RARs is critical for receptor activation. The benzo/naphtho group fused to the diazepine ring may disturb the proper folding of the helix to elicit the antagonistic activity. The bulkier naphtho group of LE540 is expected to be more effective than the benzo group of LE135 and that of LE550 with a different direction seems to affect weakly the conformation around the helix as it could not inhibit RARβ basal transactivation activity (Fig. 2). The pleiotropic effects of retinoids are mainly mediated by RARs and RXRs. Both types of retinoid receptors are encoded by three distinct genes, α, β, and γ. The fact that these receptors display distinct patterns of expression during development and differentiation suggests that each of them may have specific function, which is being unraveled recently by a variety of technologies, such as homologous recombination, antisense, and ectopic expression of a receptor of interest. The complexity of retinoid responses also can be dissected with the use of both receptor-selective agonist and antagonists, activating or interfering specifically or preferentially with one given receptor. We have previously reported (20Liu Y. Lee M.-O. Wang H.-G. Li Y. Hashimoto Y. Klaus M. Reed J.C. Zhang X.-k. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1138-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) that all-trans-RA-induced apoptosis of human breast cancer cells requires RARβ expression. This was based on our observation that stable expression of RARβ in RARβ-negative cells induced apoptosis, whereas expression of RARβ antisense RNA in RARβ-positive cells abolished apoptotic effect of all-trans-RA (20Liu Y. Lee M.-O. Wang H.-G. Li Y. Hashimoto Y. Klaus M. Reed J.C. Zhang X.-k. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1138-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Here, we used RARβ-selective antagonists to study the involvement of RARβ in all-trans-RA-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis of ZR-75-1 human breast cancer cells. When RARβ-selective antagonists LE135, LE540, or LE550 was used together with all-trans-RA, the effect of all-trans-RA on apoptosis in ZR-75-1 cells was largely reduced (Fig. 4). This result further supports the role of RARβ in all-trans-RA-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis of human breast cancer cells. It also demonstrates that LE135 and its analogs are valuable tools for studying RARβ function. In this study, we also show that RARβ antagonists could act as effective anti-AP-1 retinoids (Fig. 5). These retinoids, which did not show any transactivation function on RARs and RXRs, could repress AP-1 activity in the presence of RARβ/RXR heterodimer. Therefore, they are anti-AP-1 specific retinoids. Interestingly, they could not affect AP-1 activity in the presence of RARβ alone but required RXR for effective inhibition of AP-1 activity. This suggests that binding of retinoids to RARβ alone is not sufficient to induce a specific anti-AP-1 conformational change. Interestingly, LE550 could induce AP-1 activity in HeLa cells but not in ZR-75-1 cells (Fig. 5). The mechanism by which LE550 induces AP-1 activity is unclear. It is likely that LE550 induces a different conformational change of RARβ. This is supported by our observation that LE540 and LE135 inhibited basal RARβ activity, whereas LE550 could not (Fig. 2). This is interesting since LE540 and LE550 are regio-isoforms, in which the bulkier naphtho group of both compounds is arranged in different directions, which may be critical for AP-1 interaction (Fig. 5). Previous studies have demonstrated that AP-1 can either inhibit or stimulate nuclear receptor activity, depending on cell type, promoter, and nuclear receptor (53Shemshedini L. Rudolf K. Sassone-Corsi P. Pornon A. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3839-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Our observation that LE550 could induce AP-1 activity in HeLa cells suggests that the retinoid receptor could also stimulate AP-1 activity in response to appropriate ligand. The fact that induction of AP-1 activity by LE550 was only observed in HeLa cells but not in ZR-75-1 cells implies that inhibition or induction of AP-1 activity by retinoid receptor is also cell-type specific. LE550 may induce RARβ in a conformation that allows a positive effect on AP-1 transcription, probably through transcriptional mediators specifically expressed in HeLa cells. Such a compound may be a valuable tool for studying mechanisms underlying AP-1/nuclear receptor interaction and for dissecting complexity of AP-1/nuclear receptor interaction."

North R.A. Kawashima E. Merlo-Pich E. Neidhart S. Surprenant A. Buell G. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2495-2507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have indicated that the six neuronal P2X subunits genes are transcribed in specific but overlapping populations in the central and peripheral nervous system (1Buell G.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2495-2507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This strongly suggests that neuronal P2X subunits belonging to different functional groups might co-assemble into heteromultimeric channels. All P2X subunits have been detected in peripheral sensory ganglia, reinforcing the view that synaptically or lytically released ATP could play an important signaling role in sensory pathways (1Buell G.

Rat P2X3 subunits have been reported to be exclusively expressed in small to medium-sized isolectin B4-positive nociceptive neurons in nodose, trigeminal, and dorsal root ganglia (4Chen C.-C. Akopian A.N. Sivilotti L. Colquhoun D. Burnstock G. Wood J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 428-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar, 5Lewis C. Neidhart S. Holy C. North R.A. Buell G. Surprenant A.

Nature. 1997; 387: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). A significant proportion of sensory neurons are thought to express hetero-oligomeric P2X2+3 receptors based on their sustained response to αβm-ATP applications (5Lewis C. Neidhart S. Holy C. North R.A. Buell G. Surprenant A. Nature. 1995; 377: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). However, recent immunocytochemistry results have demonstrated that P2X2 and P2X3 subunits in rat dorsal root ganglia are rarely co-localized at the level of central primary afferents in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, despite their high degree of co-localization in somata, indicating different subunit-specific subcellular targetings (16Vulchanova L.

Altogether, these data suggest that physiologically relevant associations of neuronal P2X subunits, giving rise to phenotypes that are not mediated by the previously described P2X2+3 (5Lewis C.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7152-7159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) receptors, remain to be discovered. Rat P2X5 subunits mRNAs have the most restricted distribution in the P2X family, but in situ hybridization studies have indicated that P2X1 and P2X5mRNAs are co-localized in primary sensory neurons as well as within subsets of large motoneurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord (1Buell G. Collo G. Rassendren F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar,11Collo G. North R.A. Kawashima E. Merlo-Pich E. Neidhart S. Surprenant A. Buell G. J.

We report here the characterization of a novel heteromeric P2X receptor with hybrid properties generated by co-expression and co-assembly of P2X1 with P2X5 subunits inXenopus laevis oocytes and transfected HEK-293A cells, further strengthening arguments for a diversity of native ATP-gated channels and purinergic phenotypes in mammalian neurons. Full-length wild-type rat P2X1 and P2X5 cDNAs were obtained through polymerase chain reaction amplification using A10 smooth muscle cells (ATCC No. CRL 1476) and adult rat spinal cord reverse transcribed-cDNA templates, respectively. Reactions were performed with exact match oligonucleotide primers based upon published primary sequences (3Valera S. Hussy N. Evans R.J. Adami N. North R.A. Surprenant A. Buell G. Nature. 1994; 371: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 11Collo G. North R.A. Kawashima E. Merlo-Pich E. Neidhart S. Surprenant A. Buell G. J.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) to minimize artifactual mutations. Epitope-tagged P2X subunits with carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine motif (His6) or Flag peptide were constructed as reported previously (18Lê K.-T. Babinski K. Séguéla P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7152-7159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, anXhoI-XbaI stuffer cassette containing in-frame Flag or His6 epitopes followed by an artificial stop codon was ligated to P2X1 and P2X5 cDNAs previously mutated to replace their natural stop codon with aXhoI restriction site. P2X1-Flag, P2X1-His6, P2X5-Flag, and P2X5-His6 were then subcloned directionally into the HindIII-XbaI sites of pcDNAI vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) compatible with CMV-driven heterologous expression in HEK-293A cells and Xenopus laevis oocytes. RT-PCR products as well as mutant epitope-tagged subunits were subjected to automatic dideoxy sequencing (Sheldon Biotechnology Center, Montreal). cDNA transfections of epitope-tagged P2X subunits were performed in mammalian cells. HEK-293A cells (ATCC No. CRL 1573) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Wisent, St. Bruno, Canada) containing penicillin and streptomycin. Cells reaching 30–50% confluency were used for transient cDNA transfections with the calcium phosphate method with 10 μg of supercoiled plasmid cDNA per 106 cells. Transfected HEK-293A cells used for Western blots were then lifted in Hanks' modified calcium-free medium with 20 mm EDTA, pelleted at low centrifugation, and homogenized in 10 volumes of 10 mmHEPES buffer and 0.3 m sucrose, pH 7.40, containing protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.2 mm) and benzamidine (1 mm). Membranes from cell lysates were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C and pelleted at 14000 × g for 5 min, and remaining membrane proteins within supernatants were used for Western blots. Solubilized proteins were incubated with 25 μl of equilibrated Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for 2 h at 4 °C under agitation. Then Ni-NTA beads were washed six times in Tris-buffered saline containing 25 mm imidazole and 1% Triton X-100. Bound proteins were eluted from His6-binding resin with 500 mm imidazole, diluted 1:1 (v/v) with SDS-containing loading buffer. Samples were then loaded onto 10–12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunostainings were performed with M2 murine monoclonal antibodies (10 μg/ml) (Sigma) or chicken anti-Flag polyclonal antibodies (1:200) (Aves) followed by incubations with corresponding species-specific peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (1:5000–1:20,000) for visualization by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Electrophysiological recordings were performed in Xenopus oocytes. Ovary lobes were surgically retrieved from X. laevis frogs under deep tricaine (Sigma) anesthesia. Oocyte-containing lobes were then treated for 3 h at room temperature with type II collagenase (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) in calcium-free Barth's solution under vigorous agitations. Stage V–VI oocytes were then chemically defolliculated before nuclear micro-injections of 5–10 ng of cDNA coding for each P2X channel subunit. Following 2–5 days of incubation at 19 °C in Barth's solution containing 1.8 mm calcium chloride and 10 μg/ml gentamicin (Sigma), elicited P2X currents were recorded in two-electrode voltage-clamp configuration using an OC-725B amplifier (Warner Instruments). Responsive signals were low pass filtered at 1 kHz, acquired at 500 Hz using a Macintosh IIci computer equipped with an NB-MIO-16XL analog-to-digital card (National Instruments). Recorded traces were post-filtered at 100 Hz in Axograph (Axon Instruments). Agonists, antagonists, and P2X co-factors (10 μm zinc chloride, pH 6.40 and pH 8.40) were prepared at room temperature in Ringer's perfusion solution containing 115 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES buffered at pH 7.40. Solutions were perfused onto oocytes at a constant flow rate of 10–12 ml/min. Dose-response curves were fitted to the Hill sigmoidal equation, and EC50 as well as IC50 values were determined using the software Prism 2.0 (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA). To assess the presence of P2X1+5 heteromers inXenopus oocytes co-injected with both subunits, we tested the expression of inward currents during prolonged applications (5–10 s) of 50 μm αβm-ATP, exploiting the fact that homomeric P2X5 ATP-gated channels are almost insensitive to this agonist when applied at concentrations below 100 μm(Fig. 1) (11Collo G. North R.A. Kawashima E. Merlo-Pich E. Neidhart S. Surprenant A. Buell G. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2495-2507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Garcia-Guzman M. Soto F. Laube B. Stuhmer W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Whereas homomeric P2X1 receptors desensitize strongly in the first seconds of agonist application, a slowly desensitizing response induced by 50 μm αβm-ATP was observed in oocytes co-injected with P2X1 and P2X5 subunits at a 1:1 cDNA molar ratio (Fig. 1). This hybrid phenotype was the unambiguous trademark of the expression of heteromeric P2X1+5 receptors. Oocytes expressing P2X1+5 receptors showed robust 50 μm αβm-ATP-induced whole-cell currents with amplitudes in the range of 3–15 μA at Vh = −50 mV after 2–5 days of post-injection time, similar to currents recorded from oocytes expressing P2X1 alone (Fig. 1). P2X1+5 receptors slowly desensitized during agonist application but showed complete recovery in 2 min (Fig.2), a noticeable difference with homomeric P2X5 receptors that do not desensitize in heterologous systems (Fig. 1) (11Collo G. North R.A. Kawashima E. Merlo-Pich E. Neidhart S. Surprenant A. Buell G. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2495-2507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Garcia-Guzman M. Soto F. Laube B. Stuhmer W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, P2X1+5receptors (Fig. 2, B and D) recovered significantly faster than P2X1 receptors, the latter recovering less than 50% of their initial response after 5 min of washout (Fig. 2, A and C). We noticed slight differences in the rate of desensitization of P2X1+5receptors between oocytes (Fig. 2). These variations of phenotype could be because of the expression of populations of heteromeric channels with different stoichiometries, a cell-dependant variable that is not controlled in these experiments of co-injection. The kinetic properties of P2X2 receptors have been shown to be modulated by protein kinase A activity (19Chow Y.-W. Wang H.-L. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2606-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus it is possible that inter-individual differences in the levels of endogenous kinase activity present in oocytes could have some impact on the properties of desensitization of P2X1+5 receptors. Furthermore, the correlation between the number of P2X5 subunits and the kinetic properties of the oligomeric complex, which has been reported to be a trimer for homomeric P2X1 channels (20Nicke A. Bäumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), is not yet known. P2X1+5 receptors were challenged with ATP, αβm-ATP, and ADP at various concentrations for comparison with the pharmacology of homomeric P2X1 and P2X5 receptors. We measured EC50 values for P2X1+5 heteromers of 0.4 ± 0.2 μm for ATP, 1.1 ± 0.6 μm for αβm-ATP and 13 ± 4 μm for ADP (Fig.3). These EC50 values were not significantly different from those obtained with homomeric P2X1 receptors in the same experimental conditions: 0.7 ± 0.1 μm for ATP, 2.4 ± 1 μm for αβm-ATP, and 47 ± 9 μm for ADP (Fig. 3), in good agreement with previously published data (3Valera S. Hussy N. Evans R.J. Adami N. North R.A. Surprenant A. Buell G. Nature. 1994; 371: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Differences in the apparent Hill coefficient n H(cooperativity index) of ADP activation between P2X1(n H = 4.9 ± 2.3) and P2X1+5(n H = 1.6 ± 0.8) (Fig. 3 C) could be because of the fact that we record from a heterogeneous population of P2X1-containing receptors with varying stoichiometries. The amplitudes of peak currents from P2X5-expressing oocytes were too small to carry out complete dose-response curve experiments with these agonists (Fig. 1). No significant differences were observed between P2X1+5 and P2X1 receptors during co-applications of extracellular zinc ions (10 μm), protons (pH 6.4), or alkaline solutions (pH 8.4) with sub-saturating concentrations of ATP (0.1 μm) (data not shown). Our results suggest that P2X1 subunits confer their high αβm-ATP sensitivity to the P2X1+5heteromers. Another specific pharmacological property of P2X1 subunits, the potent inhibitory effect of trinitrophenyl-ATP (TNP-ATP) (20Nicke A. Bäumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), is observed in the heteromeric receptors (Fig. 4 A). In conditions of co-application of TNP-application of TNP-ATP and αβm-ATP without pre-incubation, we measured an IC50 of 64 ± 14 nm on P2X1+5 and 200 ± 120 nm on homomeric P2X1receptors (Fig.4 B). This subunit association is therefore reminiscent of the association between P2X2 and P2X3 in which P2X3 is the pharmacologically dominant component both for αβm-ATP sensitivity (5Lewis C. Neidhart S. Holy C. North R.A. Buell G. Surprenant A. Nature. 1995; 377: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 17Radford K.M. Virginio C. Surprenant A. North R.A. Kawashima E. J.

Membrane potentials were held at −100 mV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To demonstrate direct associations between P2X1 and P2X5 subunits that underlie their assembly in hybrid heteromers, we assayed their physical interaction by co-purification of epitope-tagged subunits in transfected HEK-293A cells. Purification of P2X5-His6 on nickel-binding resin in nondenaturing conditions (see “Experimental Procedures” for details) allowed the detection of co-transfected P2X1-Flag in Western blots (Fig. 5, lane C). Reciprocally, P2X1-His6 was shown to co-assemble with P2X5-Flag (Fig. 5, lane D). Positive controls included pseudo-homomeric receptors composed of P2X1-His6 + P2X1-Flag or P2X5-His6 + P2X5-Flag (Fig. 5,lanes A and B). Technical controls of transfections with one P2X subunit only or with sham-transfected HEK-293A cells were negative (data not shown). Peripheral sensory neurons have been reported to express ATP-gated channels with a slow rate of desensitization and a high sensitivity to αβm-ATP characterized by EC50 in the low micromolar range (Ref. 5Lewis C. Neidhart S. Holy C. North R.A. Buell G. Surprenant A. Nature. 1995; 377: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, and references therein). This sensory phenotype was thought to be exclusively accounted for by the co-assembly of P2X2 and P2X3 subunits into heteromeric P2X2+3 receptors (5Lewis C. Neidhart S. Holy C. North R.A. Buell G. Surprenant A. Nature. 1995; 377: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 17Radford K.M. Virginio C. Surprenant A. North R.A. Kawashima E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6529-6533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, we propose from our results that slowly desensitizing and αβm-ATP-elicited responses could be mediated by hybrid P2X1+5 heteromeric receptors endowed with the pharmacology of P2X1 and the kinetics of P2X5. Our data suggest to use TNP-ATP as a specific antagonist of P2X1-containing ATP-gated channels. In spinal motoneurons where P2X3 is absent, complete blockade of slowly desensitizing P2X responses by 1 μmTNP-ATP would indicate the expression of P2X1+5 heteromeric channels. Using subunit-specific polyclonal antibodies, Vulchanova et al. (23Vulchanova L. Arvidsson U. Rield M. Wang J. Buell G.N. Surprenant A. North R.A. Elde R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8063-8067Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) described a strong P2X1 immunoreactivity in the laminae I-II of spinal cord, corresponding to presynaptic labeling of central axon terminals from dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons. As P2X2 and P2X3 subunits do not appear to co-assemble in heteromeric channels in these primary afferents (16Vulchanova L. Riedl M.S. Shuster S.J. Buell G. Surprenant A. North R.A. Elde R. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1229-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), a presynaptic localization of P2X1+5 receptors would provide sensory axon terminals with high sensitivity to ATP and slowly desensitizing voltage-independent calcium entry that could play a modulatory role in the release of central neurotransmitters glutamate or substance P (24Gu J.G. MacDermott A.B. Nature. 1997; 389: 749-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The effects of presynaptic P2X1+5receptors on the release of sensory transmitters can now be experimentally challenged with application of the blocker TNP-ATP at low concentrations. In the central nervous system, an important role for purines in motor systems is deduced both from the distribution of several P2X subunits mRNA within cranial and spinal motor nuclei (11Collo G. North R.A. Kawashima E. Merlo-Pich E. Neidhart S. Surprenant A. Buell G. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2495-2507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and from the powerful cellular effects of extracellular ATP on motor outflow (25Funk G.D. Kanjhan R. Walsh C. Lipski J. Comer A.M. Parkis M.A. Housley G.D. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6325-6337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More specifically, a subset of large projection motoneurons in lamina IX of rat spinal cord has been characterized by the co-expression of P2X1 and P2X5 subunits (11Collo G. North R.A. Kawashima E. Merlo-Pich E. Neidhart S. Surprenant A. Buell G. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2495-2507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We propose from their functional properties that highly agonist-sensitive P2X1+5 receptors might provide a specific excitatory function to the motor control by allowing a sustained entry of extracellular calcium within motoneurons in response to minute amounts of released ATP. We gratefully acknowledge Kazimierz Babinski for the cloning of the rat P2X5 receptor subunit."
https://openalex.org/W2013590529,"We have isolated a novel nuclear protein with a molecular mass of 49 kDa (TIP49a) from rat liver. The rat TIP49a showed structural resemblance to several bacterial RuvBs and also displayed Walker A and B motifs. We overproduced the recombinant TIP49a inEscherichia coli and purified it to near homogeneity. Biochemical investigations demonstrated that TIP49a possessed ATPase activity that was stimulated by single-stranded DNA but neither by double-stranded DNA nor by any forms of RNA polymers tested. Moreover, a UV cross-linking assay indicated TIP49a specifically interacted with ATP. Interestingly, we found that DNA duplex was unwound by the recombinant TIP49a in the presence of ATP or dATP. Optimal concentrations of ATP and Mg2+ for the helicase activity were 1–2 mm and 0.25–1 mm, respectively. Displacement of the DNA strand occurred in the 3′ to 5′ direction with respect to the single-stranded DNA flanking the duplex. Western blot analysis revealed that TIP49a was abundantly expressed in testes and moderately in spleen, thymus, and lung. In mouse seminiferous tubules, the protein was restrictively observed in germ lineages from late pachytene spermatocytes to round spermatids. From these observations, we propose that TIP49a is a novel DNA helicase and may play a role in nuclear processes such as recombination and transcription.

In mouse seminiferous tubules, the protein was restrictively observed in germ lineages from late pachytene spermatocytes to round spermatids. From these observations, we propose that TIP49a is a novel DNA helicase and may play a role in nuclear processes such as recombination and transcription. The unwinding of parent DNA strands is a prerequisite to basic genetic processes including DNA replication, DNA repair, recombination, and transcription (1Matson S.W. Bean D.W. George J.W. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 2Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). In each of these processes, unwinding of duplex DNA is catalyzed by a DNA helicase, which functions to destabilize hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs in duplex DNA. The energy necessary for this reaction is provided by hydrolysis of nucleosides and deoxynucleoside 5′-triphosphates, meaning that DNA helicase generally possesses an intrinsic ATPase activity (2Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). DNA helicases are found ubiquitously from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. Biochemical studies and computer analysis have revealed that helicases have several characteristic motifs and that some of them are functionally important. Two sequence signatures, so-called Walker A and B motifs, have been identified in all helicases examined and in a wide variety of other NTP-utilizing enzymes (3Schmid S.R. Linder P. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 4Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Donchenko A.P. Blinov V.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4713-4729Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). On the basis of the primary sequence analysis of the Saccharomyces cerevisiaegenome, there are at least 41 helicase genes in the genome (5Ellis N.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, most of our biochemical knowledge about DNA helicases comes from analyses of bacterial and phage enzymes (1Matson S.W. Bean D.W. George J.W. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 2Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), because little is known about the biochemical properties of most of the eukaryotic DNA helicases. However, recent studies demonstrated that six established or putative helicases are mutated in the human diseases such as xeroderma pigmentosum, Bloom's syndrome, Cockayne's syndrome, trichothiodystrophy, Werner's syndrome, and α-thalassemia (5Ellis N.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, identification of a novel helicase is medically important. We originally identified a 49-kDa TATA-binding protein (TBP) 1The abbreviations used are: TBP, TATA-binding protein; TIP, TBP-interacting protein; RUVBL1, RuvB-like protein 1; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)1The abbreviations used are: TBP, TATA-binding protein; TIP, TBP-interacting protein; RUVBL1, RuvB-like protein 1; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)-interacting protein (TIP49a; termed TIP49 in previous reports) from rat liver nuclear extracts (6Kanemaki M. Makino Y. Yoshida T. Kishimoto T. Koga A. Yamamoto K. Yamamoto M. Moncollin V. Egly J.-M. Muramatsu M. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 12Makino Y. Mimori T. Koike C. Kanemaki M. Kurokawa Y. Inoue S. Kishimoto T. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). TBP is one of the general transcription factors needed for all classes of RNA polymerases (7Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1291-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Although we found a protein complex including both TIP49a and TBP in nuclear extracts (6Kanemaki M. Makino Y. Yoshida T. Kishimoto T. Koga A. Yamamoto K. Yamamoto M. Moncollin V. Egly J.-M. Muramatsu M. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), it is still unclear how TIP49a is involved in transcription and why it forms a complex with TBP. Interestingly, a computer search revealed a high similarity between TIP49a and a prokaryotic DNA helicase, RuvB, which is involved in branch migration of the Holliday junction (8Shinagawa H. Iwasaki H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 9West S.C. Cell. 1996; 86: 177-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that TIP49a contains both the Walker A and B motifs in the RuvB homologous regions (6Kanemaki M. Makino Y. Yoshida T. Kishimoto T. Koga A. Yamamoto K. Yamamoto M. Moncollin V. Egly J.-M. Muramatsu M. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), suggesting that TIP49a is a putative DNA helicase. Recently, we found highly conservedtip49a-related genes in a variety of organisms from humans to an archaean by a data base search, implying that TIP49a plays a fundamental and essential role throughout the archaea and eukaryotes (10Kurokawa Y. Kanemaki M. Makino Y. Tamura T. DNA Seq. 1999; 10: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is generally surprising that a mammalian protein would exhibit such extensive homology to a bacterial one. The eukaryotic counterpart of the bacterial ruvB has not been identified so far. Demonstration and characterization of a new helicase would be expected to help in the elucidation of eukaryotic nuclear processes. Most recently, Qiu et al. (11Qiu X.B. Lin Y.L. Thome K.C. Pian P. Schlegel B.P. Weremowicz S. Parvin J.D. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27786-27793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) reported the identification and characterization of a eukaryotic RuvB-like protein (RUVBL1), which is highly homologous to bacterial RuvB. The amino acid sequence of RUVBL1 is identical to that of human TIP49a (12Makino Y. Mimori T. Koike C. Kanemaki M. Kurokawa Y. Inoue S. Kishimoto T. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and to that of rat TIP49a (6Kanemaki M. Makino Y. Yoshida T. Kishimoto T. Koga A. Yamamoto K. Yamamoto M. Moncollin V. Egly J.-M. Muramatsu M. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) with one exception; i.e. Val291 in rat TIP49a is replaced by Ile in RUVBL1. However, they reported that ATPase and helicase activities could not be detected in their RUVBL1 preparation. In this study, we purified the recombinant rat TIP49a protein from Escherichia coli to near homogeneity and showed that this protein is a DNA-stimulated ATPase and ATP-dependent DNA helicase. We further found that TIP49a was enriched in testes as compared with all somatic tissues examined. Within the testes, TIP49a was localized in a subset of the germ cells from late pachytene spermatocytes to round spermatids. Herein, the biological significance of TIP49a will be discussed. AnNdeI site was created at translation initiation site of the TIP49a cDNA isolated from rat liver cDNA library in λgt11 (6Kanemaki M. Makino Y. Yoshida T. Kishimoto T. Koga A. Yamamoto K. Yamamoto M. Moncollin V. Egly J.-M. Muramatsu M. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and a fragment from NdeI to BamHI (in pBluescript vector downstream from the TIP49a cDNA) including an entire TIP49a coding region was inserted into pET-3a vector (13Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar). TIP49a carrying FLAG tag and histidine tag was constructed by inserting oligonucleotides for amino acid stretch, MDYKDDDDKHHHHHH, at the N-terminal methionine of the rat TIP49a. The rat TIP49a was overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS strain (13Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar) by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. The E. coli cells were harvested and suspended in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol. The cells were disrupted by sonication and centrifuged, and the supernatants were then applied onto a nickel-agarose column equilibrated with the lysis buffer. The column was washed with BC100 buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol) supplemented with 20 mmimidazole/HCl (pH 7.9). TIP49a protein was eluted with BC100 buffer containing 300 mm imidazole/HCl (pH 7.9), and the peak fractions were dialyzed against F buffer containing 20 mmTris/HCl (pH 7.9), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 500 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol. Dialyzed materials were incubated with 5 ml of M2 anti-FLAG agarose (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 4 h with agitation. After the column had been washed with F buffer, the bound proteins were eluted from the M2-agarose by incubation for 60 min with 5 ml of the FLAG peptide (Kodak) in F buffer (0.5 mg/ml). The eluate was dialyzed against BC40 buffer. The resulting sample was loaded onto a MonoQ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column and eluted with a linear gradient of KCl from 40 to 400 mmusing BC buffer. The protein concentration was estimated by use of BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. ATPase activity was assayed by use of activated charcoal (Sigma) as described by Armon et al.(14Armon T. Ganoth D. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20723-20726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction (20 μl) contained 0.3 μg of the purified TIP49a, unless specified otherwise. The TIP49a was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in A buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 70 mmKCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm ATP, and 1.25 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP). One microgram of M13 single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), double-stranded pBluescript DNA, RNA homopolymers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), or cellular total RNA was added to as indicated. Radioactivity was determined as Cerenkov radiation. Control reactions without TIP49a were carried out in parallel tubes, and the control value (radioactivity) was subtracted from each experimental one. Each assay was done in duplicate, and the results were presented as a simple arithmetic average. A complementary oligonucleotide corresponding to nucleotide positions 6291–6320 in M13mp18 ssDNA was synthesized and labeled at the 5′-end by T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The labeled oligonucleotide was annealed with the phage ssDNA by incubation at 95 °C for 10 min and 60 min at 37 °C. The product was purified by Suprec02 (Takara Shuzo) to remove the unannealed oligonucleotide. In the case of the experiment to determine the direction of DNA helicase, another substrate was constructed as described previously (15Tuteja N. Rahman K. Tuteja R. Falaschi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3613-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A complementary oligonucleotide (54-mer) including the SmaI site, corresponding to nucleotide positions 6226–6279 in M13mp18 ssDNA, was synthesized and hybridized with the phage ssDNA. The oligonucleotide was labeled with T4 DNA kinase for 5′-end labeling or with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and [γ-32P]ddATP for 3′-end labeling. After SmaI digestion, this partial duplex DNA was used as a substrate. For the DNA helicase assay, the reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mg/ml BSA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 80 mm KCl, 1 mm ATP, and 10 ng of 32P-labeled helicase substrate. The reactions contained 0.2 μg of the purified TIP49a unless specified otherwise. The helicase assay was performed at 37 °C for 30 min and stopped by the addition of 5 ml of 60 mm EDTA, 0.75% SDS, and 0.1% bromphenol blue. The reaction mixture was then subjected to 10% PAGE, and the displaced oligonucleotides were visualized by autoradiography. UV cross-linking assays were performed as described by Pause et al. (16Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2643-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Reaction mixture (20 μl) in a buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 70 mm KCl, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 5 μCi of [α-32P]ATP) was irradiated by a UV cross-linker, LS1500 (Funakoshi), from a distance of 2 cm at 4 °C for 20 min. The samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and then the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and autoradiographed. The purified TIP49a was used to generate polyclonal antibody in rabbits as described by Kanemaki et al. (6Kanemaki M. Makino Y. Yoshida T. Kishimoto T. Koga A. Yamamoto K. Yamamoto M. Moncollin V. Egly J.-M. Muramatsu M. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The TIP49a antibody was affinity-purified by use of TIP49a-immobilized HiTrap NHS-activated beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Rat tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm benzamidine) and then centrifuged. The protein content of the supernatant was determined using the BCA protein assay kit. Sample lysates (10 μg) were mixed with SDS sample buffer and then boiled for 5 min. The protein sample was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and electophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.). The proteins were visualized by the ECL protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunohistochemical analysis of TIP49a in mouse testes, sections were processed as described previously (18Goto M. Koji T. Mizuno K. Tamaru M. Koikeda S. Nakane P.K. Mori N. Masamune Y. Nakanishi Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 186: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19Koji T. Jinno A. Matsushime H. Shibuya M. Nakane P.K. Cell Biochem. Funct. 1992; 10: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Localization of TIP49a was examined with anti-TIP49a antibody. Deparaffinized and rehydrated sections were immersed in 0.3% H2O2 in methanol and then preincubated with 0.5 mg/ml normal goat IgG in 1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h. The sections were next reacted with rabbit anti-TIP49a antisera (1:800) diluted with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 3 h. After having been washed with 0.075% Brij 35/phosphate-buffered saline, each section was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100) for 1 h and washed with 0.075% Brij 35/phosphate-buffered saline. Negative control sections were incubated with normal rabbit serum at a 1:800 dilution. We found earlier that rat TIP49a showed a significant homology with RuvB, which is a bacterial recombination factor and possesses ATPase/DNA helicase activities (8Shinagawa H. Iwasaki H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 9West S.C. Cell. 1996; 86: 177-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). There were mainly two conserved regions between TIP49a and the bacterial RuvBs, and in these regions the sequence identity and similarity were 38 and 25% and 55 and 46%, respectively (12Makino Y. Mimori T. Koike C. Kanemaki M. Kurokawa Y. Inoue S. Kishimoto T. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The RuvB-homologous regions in the TIP49a protein described above included Walker A and B motifs, which are responsible for ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis, and are characteristic of RNA and DNA helicases (Fig. 1). Therefore, we assumed that TIP49a is a putative ATPase and also possibly a DNA or RNA helicase. A data base search indicated the presence of TIP49a-related proteins in various organisms such as humans and S. cerevisiae, and also in archaea (Archaeoglobus fulgidus) (10Kurokawa Y. Kanemaki M. Makino Y. Tamura T. DNA Seq. 1999; 10: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Amino acid identities of the human, yeast, and archaean proteins to the rat TIP49a protein were 99.8% (with only one amino acid substitution), 70%, and 46–48%, respectively (Fig. 1). It is remarkable that thetip49a-related genes are so highly conserved among bacteria, eukaryotes, and archaea, suggesting that TIP49a must play a fundamental role in biological processes. For biochemical investigation of TIP49a, we overexpressed rat TIP49a protein inE. coli. Codons for two peptide motifs, the FLAG octapeptide, and a stretch of six histidines, were added to the 5′-end of the TIP49a sequence to facilitate the subsequent purification of the recombinant protein. The TIP49a carrying two tags was expressed inE. coli (data not shown) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The TIP49a protein was thoroughly purified by nickel-chelate chromatography, anti-FLAG antibody-immobilized affinity chromatography, and MonoQ column chromatography, as outlined in Fig.2 A. The final MonoQ fraction of TIP49a protein was found to include no detectable contaminating protein by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig.2 B, top). The presence of the characteristic Walker motifs in the primary TIP49a sequence predicted that the protein would be an ATPase. Therefore, we examined whether purified TIP49a protein had ATPase activity. The final MonoQ fractions were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of DNA, followed by determination of released phosphates as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 2 B(bottom) shows that the TIP49a was associated with an ATPase activity that was strongly stimulated by the presence of ssDNA. We also observed a weak ATPase activity in the absence of DNA (Fig.2 B). The level of ATPase activity correlated well with the amount of TIP49a present in each fraction (Fig. 2 B). A parallel sample prepared from control E. coli had no ATPase activity (data not shown). To further confirm that the TIP49a is an ATP-utilizing enzyme, the specific interaction between the purified TIP49a and ATP was analyzed by a UV cross-linking assay. This reaction, in which ATP is photolyzed by UV light in the presence of an ATP-binding protein, yields a covalent adduct interacting with ATP and the protein. By use of [α-32P]ATP, specific radioactive proteins were able to be visualized by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig.3 A, illumination with UV light resulted in the labeling of TIP49a protein (lane 2), and the labeling was strongly inhibited by cold ATP (lane 3). Incubation of [α-32P]ATP did not cross-link the ATP to the protein without UV illumination (Fig. 3 A, lane 1). The addition of cold UTP to the reaction had a little effect on the UV labeling of TIP49a, whereas cold GTP and CTP moderately reduced the labeling (Fig. 3 A, lanes 4–6). These results were consistent with the effect of nucleotides on the ATP hydrolysis by TIP49a (see below; Fig.3 B), suggesting that TIP49a does not interact nonspecifically with radioactive ATP; i.e., the labeling is attributed to the specific interaction between TIP49a and radioactive ATP. From these experiments, we concluded that TIP49a possesses an intrinsic ATPase activity. To examine the nucleotide specificity for the TIP49a-catalyzed hydrolysis, we employed unlabeled nucleotides as competitors. The addition of UTP to the reaction had a little effect on the ATPase activity of TIP49a, whereas GTP and CTP moderately reduced the ATPase activity (Fig. 3 B). This result suggests that TIP49a is unable to interact efficiently with nucleotides except ATP. Since it is thought that some proteins containing the Walker motif exhibit ATPase activity stimulated by nucleic acids, we next investigated the effects of various nucleic acids on the TIP49a ATPase activity. Fig.3 C shows that neither homoribopolymers nor cellular RNAs affected the enzyme activity of TIP49a. The closed circular form of plasmid DNA (pBluescript) exhibited only a weak stimulating effect, whereas the ATPase activity of TIP49a was remarkably stimulated more than 10-fold by the M13 ssDNA (Fig. 3 C), demonstrating that TIP49a is an ssDNA-stimulated ATPase. Since rat TIP49a is structurally homologous to the bacterial RuvB proteins, which possess an ssDNA-stimulated ATPase activity and have DNA helicase activity, we suspected that TIP49a would also be a DNA helicase. To investigate whether the purified TIP49a protein possesses helicase activity, we prepared a substrate for DNA helicase assay. A radiolabeled 30-mer oligonucleotide was annealed with M13 ssDNA to construct a partial duplex substrate. This substrate was incubated with the final MonoQ fractions. The reaction products were separated on a polyacrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography. In agreement with the results of the ATPase assay (Fig. 2 B), the helicase activity was also correlated with the amount of TIP49a in each fraction (Fig.4 A), demonstrating that TIP49a possesses a DNA helicase activity. To determine the polarity of the DNA unwinding by TIP49a, we prepared the following DNA substrates. For substrate preparation, a 5′- or 3′-end-labeled 54-mer oligonucleotide was annealed with M13 ssDNA. This partial duplex DNA was digested with SmaI to yield a linear ssDNA with either a labeled complementary 24-mer or a labeled 30-mer bound to its ends. Following incubation of the substrates with the TIP49a protein, no increase in unwound 24-mer oligonucleotide over background was observed (Fig. 4 B, lanes 4 and 6). The recombinant TIP49a was found to efficiently displace the 5′-labeled 30-mer (Fig. 4 B,lane 3), showing that TIP49a has a 3′ to 5′ unwinding polarity with respect to the ssDNA flanking the duplex. Next, we determined the optimal conditions for the DNA helicase activity of TIP49a. The optimal temperature for the helicase reaction was 37 °C, and the optimal pH range was 7.5–8 (data not shown). For the maximal helicase activity, TIP49a required 1–2 mm ATP and 0.25–1 mm MgCl2, and 4 mm ATP and 10 mm MgCl2 considerably inhibited the enzyme activity (Fig. 5 A). TIP49a helicase activity was not detected in the absence of ATP or MgCl2 (Table I), demonstrating that TIP49a DNA helicase activity is dependent on the presence of both Mg2+ and ATP. The helicase reaction required the hydrolysis of a β–γ bond of ATP, since the poorly hydrolyzable analog ATPγS, ADP, and AMP did not exhibit the cofactor function (Table I). Compared with ATP, other nucleoside 5′-triphosphates were inert as a co-factor, with the exception of dATP, which supported more than 90% of the activity of ATP (Table I). We next examined the requirement of various divalent cations for TIP49a helicase activity. Although the presence of Mn2+ at a 1 mm concentration resulted in 75% of the activity of Mg2+, all other tested cations such as Ca2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ could not replace Mg2+ for the enzyme activity (Table I). MgCl2was able to be replaced by either MgSO4 or Mg(CH3COO)2.Table IReaction requirements of TIP49aReaction conditionaHelicase reaction was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Concentrations of nucleotides and divalent cations were 1 mm.Unwinding%Complete98Without TIP49a<1Without ATP<1With dATP90With ATPγS<1With ADP<1With AMP<1With CTP, GTP, or UTP<1With dCTP, dGTP, or dTTP<1Without MgCl2<1With MgSO495With Mg(OAc)294With CaCl2<1With ZnCl2<1With MnCl275With CuCl2<1a Helicase reaction was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Concentrations of nucleotides and divalent cations were 1 mm. Open table in a new tab A time course of the TIP49a-mediated strand displacement reaction under the optimal assay conditions is shown in Fig. 5 B. Percentage of unwound fragment was determined. In the presence of 300 ng of TIP49a protein, we found that >50% of the labeled fragments were displaced in 5 min. The unwinding activity increased linearly up to 5 min and reached a plateau in 20 min. Finally we examined the expression of TIP49a in various rat tissues by Western blot analysis using affinity-purified anti-TIP49a antibody. TIP49a protein was exclusively detected as a single band of 50 kDa (Fig.6 A). It was moderately expressed in the thymus, spleen, and lung and abundantly in the testis. This distribution pattern coincided well with that of Rad51, an authentic eukaryotic recombination factor known to be involved in mitotic and meiotic recombination (Fig. 6 A) (20Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Matsuda Y. Ushio N. Ikeo K. Ogawa T. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 21Ikeya T. Shinohara A. Sato S. Tabata S. Ogawa T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We suspect that TIP49a participates in some way in recombination. The testes contain multiple types of germ and nongerm cells. Moreover, each type of germ cells reflects a particular stage of spermatogenesis. We next performed immunohistochemistry to examine what kinds of testicular cells predominantly express TIP49a proteins. Fig.6 B, a, shows that the epitope reacted with anti-TIP49a antibody is specifically localized in a subset of the germ cells at the stage of pachytene (stages IX–X) to round spermatids. Immunostaining using normal serum resulted in no staining (Fig.6 B, c), demonstrating that the detected epitopes represent TIP49a. In contrast, little signal was detected in pachytene spermatocytes (stages IV–VI; Fig. 6 B, b). These results indicated that TIP49a is predominantly expressed in testicular germ cells at stages from late pachytene spermatocytes to round spermatids. No or little signal was observed in somatic Sertoli or Leydig cells (Fig. 6 B, a and b). These observations suggest that TIP49a plays a critical role in meiosis. We originally identified a 49-kDa TBP-interacting protein (TIP49a) from rat liver nuclear extracts by use of an in vitro binding assay (6Kanemaki M. Makino Y. Yoshida T. Kishimoto T. Koga A. Yamamoto K. Yamamoto M. Moncollin V. Egly J.-M. Muramatsu M. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence analysis using anti-TIP49a antibody revealed a typical dot-shaped nuclear staining pattern, as previously reported (12Makino Y. Mimori T. Koike C. Kanemaki M. Kurokawa Y. Inoue S. Kishimoto T. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), indicating that TIP49a to be a nuclear protein. This finding is consistent with a recent report that TIP49a (or NMP38) was identified as a nuclear matrix protein (22Holzmann K. Gerner C. Korosec T. Poltl A. Grimm R. Sauermann G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). TIP49a contains Walker A and B motifs, which are characteristic of DNA/RNA helicases. Thus, we suspected it to be a putative DNA/RNA helicase. In this work, the recombinant TIP49a was purified to near homogeneity from E. coli and was defined to be an ssDNA-stimulated ATPase and ATP-dependent DNA helicase based on the following biochemical evidence. (i) The ATPase activity was co-purified with the recombinant TIP49a on the final MonoQ column (Fig. 2 B), and the same result was obtained in the case of the helicase activity (Fig.4 A). (ii) A UV cross-linking assay indicated that TIP49a specifically interacted with ATP (Fig. 3 A). Thus, it is unlikely that a contaminating protein was involved in the ATPase/helicase activity. (iii) The ATPase activity was remarkably stimulated by ssDNA (Fig. 3 C). (iv) The helicase activity was dependent on the presence of ATP or dATP, but ATPγS could not substitute for ATP (Table I). Most recently, RUVBL1, human counterpart of rat TIP49a, was isolated from human cells. However, the purified RUVBL1 expressed in insect cells did not possess ATPase and helicase activity, although RUVBL1 and TIP49a are 99.8% identical (11Qiu X.B. Lin Y.L. Thome K.C. Pian P. Schlegel B.P. Weremowicz S. Parvin J.D. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27786-27793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We also found that TIP49a preparations purified from insect cells using the baculovirus expression system did not hydrolyze ATP (data not shown). The failure to detect the enzyme activity in insect cell-expressed TIP49a and RUVBL1 might be due to the modification of the protein and/or the presence of an inhibitory factor in insect cells. TIP49a exhibits significant sequence similarity to bacterial RuvB, which is a recombination factor having ATP-dependent DNA helicase activity. A functional and structural homologue of bacterial RuvB has not been found in eukaryotes yet (see below). We herein provided evidence that a mammalian RuvB-like TIP49a is an intrinsic DNA-stimulated ATPase and DNA helicase. However, we found some differences between TIP49a and RuvB in terms of biochemical properties. TIP49a required 1–2 mm ATP and 0.25–1 mmMgCl2 for the maximal helicase activity (Fig.5 A), whereas concentrations of ATP of >0.5 mmand MgCl2 at 10–20 mm are optimal for RuvB helicase activity (23Tsaneva I.R. Muller B. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1315-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The TIP49a helicase activity was considerably inhibited at 10 mm MgCl2. Furthermore, despite the sequence similarity between RuvB and TIP49a, TIP49a has a 3′ to 5′ polarity, which is the opposite of that of RuvB. If TIP49a possesses RuvB-like activity, this difference may be relevant to the finding that the polarity of strand transfer promoted by Rad51 is also the opposite of that observed in RecA (24Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Our findings that TIP49a is a nuclear factor possessing a DNA helicase activity led us to an assumption that TIP49a is involved in DNA-associated nuclear processes such as recombination, transcription, and replication. Considering the high sequence conservation in archaea and yeast as well as in higher eukaryotes (Fig. 1), we suggest that TIP49a may play an important role in nuclear processes. Immunological analysis indicated that Rad51, which is responsible for an early stage in homologous recombination (i.e. a sequential pathway up to the Holliday junction formation), was highly expressed in the thymus, spleen, and testis, as expected (Fig. 6 A). Like Rad51, TIP49a was also significantly enriched in tissues where recombination frequently takes place. Moreover, it is interesting that TIP49a protein was highly accumulated in the meiotic cells at stages from late pachytene to round spermatids (Fig. 6 B), since formation of the Holliday junction is assumed to occur in germ cells staying at the pachytene stage (28Roeder G.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2600-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Chiasmata represent the physical manifestation of crossing over and reciprocal recombination and are cytologically detected when homologues begin to separate at diplotene stage (29Baker S.M. Plug A.W. Prolla T.A. Bronner C.E. Harris A.C. Yao X. Christie D.M. Monell C. Arnheim N. Bradley A. Ashley T. Liskay R.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). It may be that the TIP49a expression pattern during meiosis reflects the late stage of recombination. Thus, we propose a hypothesis that TIP49a participates in a recombination process like RuvB. In bacteria, RecA generates the Holliday structure. E. coliRuvB, which is an ATP-dependent DNA helicase, binds to the Holliday junction, and promotes the branch migration together with RuvA during the late stage of recombination (8Shinagawa H. Iwasaki H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 9West S.C. Cell. 1996; 86: 177-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Rad51 in eukaryotes and RadA in archaea were established to be RecA functional homologues (30Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar,31Seitz E.M. Brockman J.P. Sandler S.J. Clark A.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1248-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), suggesting that a recombination mechanism is conserved among the organisms. However, in eukaryotes, RuvB-like activity has not been identified. It was a general surprise that rat TIP49a is highly homologous to bacterial RuvBs. Thus, with all evidence taken together, it is conceivable that TIP49a helicase activity is involved in some aspect of RuvB-associated recombination in eukaryotes. Alternatively, TIP49a may function as a transcription factor, because it was identified in a TBP-carrying complex (6Kanemaki M. Makino Y. Yoshida T. Kishimoto T. Koga A. Yamamoto K. Yamamoto M. Moncollin V. Egly J.-M. Muramatsu M. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by a recent finding that RUVBL1, which is a human homologue of TIP49a, is co-purified with the RNA polymerase II transcription complex (11Qiu X.B. Lin Y.L. Thome K.C. Pian P. Schlegel B.P. Weremowicz S. Parvin J.D. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27786-27793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We cannot exclude a possibility that TIP49a directly participates in the transcriptional regulation. Bauer et al.(37Bauer A. Huber O. Kelmer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14787-14792Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) reported that β-catenin and TBP were binding partners of the human TIP49a (Pontin52). As another possibility, TIP49a may involved in a transcription-recombination coupling reaction. Indeed, several subunits of the TFIIH complex, which is a general transcription factor, are involved in nucleotide excision repair (32Svejstrup J.Q. Vichi P. Egly J.-M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 346-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Rad51 and BRCA1 are found to be components of the RNA polymerase II-holoenzyme complex (33Maldonado E. Shiekhattar R. Sheldon M. Cho H. Drapkin R. Rickert P. Lees E. Anderson C.W. Linn S. Reinberg D. Nature. 1996; 381: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 34Scully R. Anderson S.F. Chao D.M. Wei W. Ye L. Young R.A. Livingston D.M. Parvin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5605-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), and BRCA1 has a potential to enhance transcription (35Anderson S.F. Schlegel B.P. Nakajima T. Wolpin E.S. Parvin J.D. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). These facts suggest that some DNA recombination-repair proteins may be associated with the transcriptional apparatus. It is possible that recombination-repair may be linked to transcription. If this is the case, TIP49a may play a pleiotropic role in DNA metabolism. Further investigation of TIP49a should provide new insight into the nuclear events that transpire in eukaryotes. We thank Dr. T. Ohta for the generous gift of anti-Rad51 antibody. We also thank Drs. T. Ogawa and H. Shinagawa for valuable discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2028125003,"Multidrug resistance in tumor cells is often accompanied by overexpression of multidrug resistance protein (MRP), a 190-kDa transmembrane protein that belongs to the ATP-binding cassette superfamily of transport proteins. MRP mediates ATP-dependent transport of a variety of conjugated organic anions and can also transport several unmodified xenobiotics in a glutathione-dependent manner. To facilitate structure-function studies of MRP, we have generated a panel of MRP-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Four of these mAbs, QCRL-2, -3, -4, and -6, bind intracellular conformation-dependent epitopes, and we have shown that they can inhibit the transport of several MRP substrates. Binding competition and immunoprecipitation assays indicated that mAbs QCRL-4 and -6 probably recognize the same detergent-sensitive epitope in MRP, whereas mAbs QCRL-2, -3, and -4 each bind distinct, non-overlapping epitopes. Fab fragments inhibit transport as effectively as the intact mAbs, suggesting that inhibition results from direct interactions of the mAbs with MRP. Immunodot blot and immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that the minimal regions of MRP sufficient for full reactivity of mAbs QCRL-2 and -3 are amino acids 617–858 and 617–932, respectively, which encompass the NH2-proximal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). In contrast, the epitope bound by mAb QCRL-4 localized to amino acids 1294–1531, a region that contains the COOH-proximal NBD. However, none of the mAbs inhibited photolabeling of intact MRP with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP. This suggests that rather than preventing nucleotide binding, the mAbs inhibit transport by interfering with substrate binding or by trapping MRP in a conformation that does not allow transport to occur. Our results also demonstrate for the first time that the NBDs of MRP can be expressed as soluble polypeptides that retain a native conformation.

The development of resistance to multiple natural product and semi-synthetic drugs commonly used in cancer chemotherapy, termed multidrug resistance, is a serious obstacle to successful treatment. This phenomenon has been extensively studied in vitro using tumor cell lines selected for resistance by chronic or intermittent exposure to drugs. The multidrug resistance observed in these cell lines is most commonly accompanied by overexpression of one or both of the integral membrane transporters, MRP 1The abbreviations used are: MRP, multidrug resistance protein; NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; MSD, membrane-spanning domain; LTC4, leukotriene C4; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TBS, Tris-buffered saline and P-glycoprotein (1Gottesman M.M.

Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3386) Google Scholar).

Recently, we have shown that the GSH-stimulated transport of unmodified vincristine by MRP-enriched membrane vesicles involves cotransport of GSH (19Loe D.W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5130-5136PubMed Google Scholar). It may be that MRP confers resistance to at least some classes of xenobiotics in intact cells by such a cotransport mechanism. We previously reported the isolation and initial characterization of a panel of five MRP-specific mAbs (QCRL-1, -2, -3, -4, and -6) (24Hipfner D.R. Gauldie S.D. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5788-5792PubMed Google Scholar). These mAbs were raised against crude membranes prepared from multidrug-resistant H69AR small cell lung cancer cells, which express very high levels of MRP. All five mAbs reacted only with permeabilized cells in immunocytochemical analyses, indicating that they recognize intracellular epitopes (24Hipfner D.R. Gauldie S.D. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C.

These results suggest that the conformation-dependent epitopes recognized by mAbs QCRL-2, -3, and -4 are localized in or near functionally important regions of MRP. In this study, we show that mAbs QCRL-2, -3, and -4 recognize distinct, non-overlapping epitopes of MRP and that their ability to inhibit MRP-dependent transport results from direct interactions with the NBDs of the protein that do not prevent the binding of ATP.

Hipfner, R. G. Deeley, and S. P. C. Cole, unpublished results. For immunoprecipitation of MRP, membrane-enriched fractions were prepared from H69AR cells that had been metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine (24Hipfner D.R. Gauldie S.D. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5788-5792PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane proteins were solubilized in PBS containing 1% CHAPS at detergent/protein ratios ranging from 1:1 to 10:1 (w/w) for 3 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g, 1 μl of crude ascites fluid was mixed with 22.5 μg of solubilized membrane protein and incubated overnight at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation of polypeptides MRP-(617–932) and MRP-(1294–1531) (prepared as described below), ∼4 μg of total cytosolic protein from infected Sf21 cells was diluted to 100 μl with PBS, and 1 μl of ascites (mAb QCRL-1, -2, -3, or -4) or 5 μl of MRP-2 antiserum was added. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, immune complexes were recovered by the addition of 30 μl of 25% GammaBind Plus Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in PBS. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the beads were washed four times with PBS, and precipitated proteins were eluted with Laemmli buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Sixty μg each of DEAE Blue-purified mAbs QCRL-1, -2, -3, -4, and -6 were passed over an Econo-Pac 10DG column (Bio-Rad) and eluted in PBS. Protein-containing fractions were pooled, and the volume was brought up to 850 μl with PBS. IODO-BEADS (Pierce) were washed with PBS and dried on filter paper. For each mAb, one IODO-BEAD was added to 150 μl of PBS containing 400 μCi of 125I (17 Ci/mg of iodine; ICN, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) and incubated for 5 min. The purified mAb was then added, and labeling was allowed to proceed for 15 min. To separate125I-labeled mAb from free 125I, the reaction mixture was loaded onto an Econo-Pac 10DG column, the mAbs were eluted with PBS, and radioactive fractions were pooled. To quantitate the relative amount of mAb in DEAE blue-purified mAb samples and crude ascites fluid, the purified samples were separated by SDS-PAGE together with serial dilutions of the corresponding ascites fluid. The amount of IgG heavy chain protein in each was assessed by densitometric analysis of the Coomassie-stained gels on a Molecular Dynamics computing densitometer using ImageQuant software. Dot blots were prepared on Immobilon P membrane in a 96-well manifold by blotting 4 μg of H69AR crude membranes in 50 μl of TBS/well and draining slowly by gravity (see below). After washing with TBS containing Tween 20 (TBS-T), 100 μl of blocking solution (10% calf serum and 1% bovine serum albumin in TBS-T) per well was added and allowed to drain slowly by gravity. Approximately 30 ng of each 125I-labeled mAb was mixed with QCRL-1, -2, -3, -4, and -6 crude ascites or with mouse IgG (Pierce) in 200 μl of blocking solution/well at ratios of unlabeled competing antibody to 125I-labeled antibody ranging from 1:125 to 125:1. The labeled/unlabeled antibody mixtures were added to the blot and drained slowly by gravity. Finally, the wells were rinsed four times with 200 μl of TBS-T, the blot was removed from the manifold and dried, and bound antibody was detected by exposure to Kodak X-Omat AR film at −70 °C. The preparation of constructs encoding wild-type and truncated (MRP-(1–858), MRP-(1–932), MRP-(229–1531), MRP-(281–1531), and MRP-(932–1531)) MRP molecules has been described previously (32Gao M.

All constructs were transferred into the recombinant donor plasmid pFASTBAC1 (Life Technologies, Inc., Burlington, Ontario, Canada), and recombinant bacmids and baculovirus were produced and used to infectSpodoptera frugiperda Sf21 cells as described previously (32Gao M.

H69AR, empty vector-transfected HeLa C1, MRP-transfected HeLa T5, or Sf21 cells were harvested, and crude membrane fractions were prepared (24Hipfner D.R. Gauldie S.D. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C.

Briefly, cells were homogenized in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm sucrose, 0.25 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5, and protease inhibitors (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell pellets were frozen at −70 °C for at least 1 h, thawed, and then disrupted by N2 cavitation. EDTA was added to 1 mm, and after centrifugation at 500 × gfor 15 min, the supernatant was layered over 35% (w/w) sucrose in 50 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The interface was collected and washed twice by centrifugation. The membrane pellet was resuspended in transport buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl and 250 mmsucrose, pH 7.5) and passed 20 times through a 27-gauge needle for vesicle formation. For Sf21 cells expressing polypeptides MRP-(617–932) and MRP-(1294–1531), the layer above the 35% sucrose interface containing soluble cytosolic proteins was retained. ATP-dependent [3H]LTC4 uptake into membrane vesicles was measured by a rapid filtration technique (16Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol.

Plasma membrane vesicles from MRP-transfected T5 cells (2 μg of protein in a 60-μl reaction volume) were preincubated alone or with mAb QCRL-1, -2, -3, or -4 (10 μg/ml intact mAb or Fab fragment) for 1 h at room temperature. Uptake of [3H]LTC4 (50 nm, 40 nCi/reaction, 146 Ci/mmol; Life Science Products, Markham, Ontario) was then determined in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 and 4 mm ATP for 1 min at 23 °C. Uptake was stopped by filtration through glass-fiber filters. Filters were washed with transport buffer, and associated radioactivity was quantitated. Membrane proteins in TBS were blotted onto Immobilon P membrane by gravity using a 96-well vacuum manifold. After washing with TBS-T, the blots were removed from the manifold, cut into strips, and transferred to a 24-slot incubation tray. Blots were blocked for at least 1 h in 4% skim milk powder in TBS-T, incubated with primary antibody diluted in blocking solution for 1–18 h, and then processed as described previously (24Hipfner D.R. Gauldie S.D. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5788-5792PubMed Google Scholar). Primary antibody binding was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragments of goat anti-rat IgG (H+L; for mAb MRPr1), goat anti-mouse IgG + IgM (H+L; for mAbs MRPm6, MRPm5, and QCRL-1, -2, -3, -4, and -6), or goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L; for antisera MRP-1 and MRP-2). Labeling of MRP-enriched T5 or control C1 membrane proteins was carried out as described previously (36Almquist K.C. Loe D.W. Hipfner D.R. Mackie J.E. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 102-110PubMed Google Scholar, 41Cornwell M.M. Safa A.R. Felsted R.L. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3847-3850Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Briefly, 30 μg of T5 or C1 membrane proteins was incubated with intact mAbs or their Fab fragments (40 μg/ml) for 15 min at room temperature. 8-Azido-[α-32P]ATP (4 μCi, 20 Ci/mmol; ICN) was added, and incubation was continued on ice for 5 min. The samples were irradiated at 302 nm for 8 min, and proteins were then resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. We demonstrated previously that mAbs QCRL-1, -2, and -3 could immunoprecipitate MRP from 1% CHAPS-solubilized membranes, confirming that they are MRP-specific (24Hipfner D.R. Gauldie S.D. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5788-5792PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, mAbs QCRL-4 and -6, which bound strongly and specifically to crude membranes from MRP-overexpressing cell lines in immunodot blots, did not immunoprecipitate MRP solubilized under similar conditions or with different detergents, including 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, or 0.5% deoxycholate (data not shown). Consequently, it could not be concluded with absolute certainty that they reacted exclusively with MRP. To test the possibility that mAbs QCRL-4 and -6 recognized conformation-dependent epitopes that were particularly sensitive to denaturation, milder conditions were used for extracting MRP from cell membranes prior to immunoprecipitation. At a detergent/protein ratio of 1:1, mAb QCRL-3 immunoprecipitated the 190-kDa MRP, as expected (Fig.1). mAbs QCRL-4 and -6 also immunoprecipitated a protein of the same size under these conditions, indicating that they are indeed MRP-specific. Higher detergent/protein ratios (e.g. 10:1) had little effect on the interaction of mAb QCRL-3 with MRP. However, binding and precipitation of MRP by both mAbs QCRL-4 and -6 were substantially reduced, confirming the detergent sensitivity of the epitopes recognized by these mAbs. Binding competition assays were carried out to determine whether mAbs QCRL-1, -2, -3, -4, and -6 recognize overlapping epitopes using H69AR membrane dot blots. A constant amount of125I-labeled mAb QCRL-1, -2, -3, -4, or -6 either alone or premixed with increasing amounts of unlabeled competing antibody (mouse IgG or mAb QCRL-1, -2, -3, -4, or -6) was added to individual wells. As expected, binding of each 125I-labeled mAb was inhibited by the unlabeled form of the same mAb at an ∼1:1 ratio or by an excess of unlabeled competitor (Fig. 2). This competition was specific because total mouse IgG did not compete for binding with any of the 125I-labeled mAbs even when present at 125-fold excess. Of all the mAbs tested, only mAbs QCRL-4 and -6 competed reciprocally for binding to MRP. This finding, together with observations that they behave similarly in immunoprecipitations (Fig.1) and other immunoassays (data not shown), suggested that mAbs QCRL-4 and -6 probably bind to the same epitope. Consequently, mAb QCRL-6 was not characterized further. No significant overlap between the epitopes of the other mAbs was apparent."

In the sulfatase ofKlebsiella pneumoniae the formylglycine is generated by posttranslational oxidation of serine 72. We cloned theatsBA operon of K. pneumoniae and found that the sulfatase was expressed in inactive form in Escherichia coli transformed with the structural gene (atsA). Coexpression of the atsB gene, however, led to production of high sulfatase activity, indicating that the atsB gene product plays a posttranslational role that is essential for the sulfatase to gain its catalytic activity. This was verified after purification of the sulfatase from the periplasm of the cells. Peptide analysis of the protein expressed in the presence of AtsB revealed that half of the polypeptides carried the formylglycine at position 72, while the remaining polypeptides carried the encoded serine. The inactive sulfatase expressed in the absence of AtsB carried exclusively serine 72, demonstrating that the atsB gene is required for formylglycine modification. This gene encodes a 395-amino acid residue iron sulfur protein that has a cytosolic localization and is supposed to directly or indirectly catalyze the oxidation of the serine to formylglycine.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6096-6103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Failure to generate the FGly residue is the cause of multiple sulfatase deficiency, a rare but fatal human lysosomal storage disorder (10Schmidt B. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. von Figura K. Cell. 1995; 82: 271-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 13Kolodny E.H. Fluharty A.L. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2693-2741Google Scholar). In eukaryotic sulfatases the FGly is generated in the endoplasmic reticulum by oxidation of a conserved cysteine residue (14Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11963-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 15Dierks T. Lecca M.R. Schmidt B. von Figura K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This oxidation occurs during or shortly after translocation of the nascent polypeptide into this compartment and is directed by a linear sequence motif starting with the residue to be modified. As shown in vitro for human arylsulfatase A (16Dierks T. Lecca M.R. Schlotterhose P. Schmidt B. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2084-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), this motif consists of the dodecamer sequence CTPSRAALLTGR comprising an essential core element (CXPXR) and a stimulating auxiliary element (AALLTGR). The core element is fully conserved, and the auxiliary element is partially conserved, among all eukaryotic members of the sulfatase family and also in the well characterized sulfatase ofPseudomonas aeruginosa (17Beil S. Kehrli H. James P. Staudenmann W. Cook A.M. Leisinger T. Kertesz M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Unlike this prokaryotic cysteine-type sulfatase, which is located in the cytosol, the other well characterized prokaryotic sulfatase, the arylsulfatase of Klebsiella pneumoniae (18Murooka Y. Ishibashi K. Yasumoto M. Sasaki M. Sugino H. Azakami H. Yamashita M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2131-2140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is a serine-type sulfatase, which is located in the periplasm and which carries a FGly residue that is generated by oxidation of a serine rather than a cysteine (7Miech C. Dierks T. Selmer T. von Figura K. Schmidt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4835-4837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the two sequence motifs (SXPXR and SMLLTGN) are also conserved in theKlebsiella sulfatase. After expression of this protein under strongly inducing conditions, 60% of the polypeptides carried the FGly residue, and the remaining 40% carried the serine predicted from the DNA sequence (7Miech C. Dierks T. Selmer T. von Figura K. Schmidt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4835-4837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Conversion of serine to FGly obviously is catalyzed also byEscherichia coli, since the Klebsiella sulfatase can be expressed in E. coli as an active enzyme (18Murooka Y. Ishibashi K. Yasumoto M. Sasaki M. Sugino H. Azakami H. Yamashita M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2131-2140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This organism furthermore is able to quantitatively oxidize cysteine 51 to FGly after overexpression of the cysteine-type sulfatase of P. aeruginosa (8Dierks T. Miech C. Hummerjohann J. Schmidt B. Kertesz M.A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25560-25564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, no FGly modification was observed when a mutant of the Pseudomonas sulfatase was expressed, in which cysteine 51 was substituted by a serine. This suggests thatE. coli harbors two FGly generating systems or that a common modification system is modulated by a cofactor (8Dierks T. Miech C. Hummerjohann J. Schmidt B. Kertesz M.A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25560-25564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Transformation of E. coli with the structural gene encoding the Pseudomonas sulfatase (atsA) is sufficient to obtain catalytically active and FGly-containing sulfatase protein. Active expression of the Klebsiella sulfatase, however, was reported to require not only the sulfatase gene (atsA) but in addition an adjacent non-sulfatase gene termed atsB (18Murooka Y. Ishibashi K. Yasumoto M. Sasaki M. Sugino H. Azakami H. Yamashita M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2131-2140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AtsB therefore was considered to function as a positive regulator of sulfatase expression in Klebsiella. In the present study we characterized this regulation in more detail. Data presented here show that regulation by AtsB is not due to a function as a transcriptional activator, as had been suggested originally (19Azakami H. Sugino H. Yokoro N. Iwata N. Murooka Y. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6287-6292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Azakami H. Sugino H. Iwata N. Yokoro N. Yamashita M. Murooka Y. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 164: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). AtsB rather plays a crucial role in a posttranslational event, namely the conversion of serine 72 to FGly. Genomic DNA of K. pneumoniae DSM 681 (Deutsche SammLung von Mikroorganismen, Braunschweig, Germany) was prepared according to Ref. 21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. J. Wiley, New York1996Google Scholar. For generation of a subgenomic bank, 110 μg of genomic DNA were digested with BamHI. After Southern blotting of 10% of the digest, a positive signal was obtained in the 6.8-kbp region using a 585-bp probe generated by PCR amplification of atsA nucleotides 2495–3079 (see Ref. 18Murooka Y. Ishibashi K. Yasumoto M. Sasaki M. Sugino H. Azakami H. Yamashita M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2131-2140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Rediprime DNA Labeling, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After electrophoretic separation of the remaining digest, 5–8-kbp fragments were recovered from the gel, cloned into pBluescript II KS (Stratagene) and transformed into E. coli DH5α by electroporation. Positive clones were identified first by colony hybridization using the probe described above and, second, by sulfatase assays using 5-bromo-6-chloro-3-indoxyl sulfate (Biosynth) orp-nitrocatechol sulfate (Sigma) as a substrate (7Miech C. Dierks T. Selmer T. von Figura K. Schmidt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4835-4837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 17Beil S. Kehrli H. James P. Staudenmann W. Cook A.M. Leisinger T. Kertesz M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). TheatsA and atsB ORFs were localized by restriction mapping (cf. Ref. 18Murooka Y. Ishibashi K. Yasumoto M. Sasaki M. Sugino H. Azakami H. Yamashita M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2131-2140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and DNA sequencing. Thereby it turned out that the atsB ORF was 30 bp shorter and theatsA ORF 339 bp longer than published previously (18Murooka Y. Ishibashi K. Yasumoto M. Sasaki M. Sugino H. Azakami H. Yamashita M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2131-2140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The entire atsBA operon was subcloned as a 3832-bpBamHI/XcmI fragment (clone pATSBA#R5), and both DNA strands were sequenced using Big-Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing (Perkin-Elmer Biosystems). The sequence obtained was deposited in the EBI data base (accession number AJ131525). For protein expression the single atsA and atsB and also the bicistronicatsBA ORFs were placed under control of the lacpromoter of pBluescript II KS or pBBR1MCS (22Kovach M.E. Phillips R.W. Elzer P.H. Roop R.M. Peterson K.M. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 800-802PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). To facilitate insertion into the multi cloning sites of these vectors we introduced a BamHI site 3′ of the atsAstop codon (noncoding primer: CGGGATCCGGAAGAACGATAGCCGTGGTGG) and aHindIII or KpnI site directly 5′ of the ribosome binding sites of atsA (coding primer: CCCAAGCTTGAACAGGAGAGTCAGTCGTGA) or atsB (coding primer: GGGGTACCAACAGTACCGGTCATTAACCG), respectively, using PCR methods. Disruption of the atsB ORF was achieved after deletion of a 882-bp NheI/StuI fragment and in-frame religation of the blunted ends (see Fig. 1). To facilitate purification of the expressed sulfatase protein, a C-terminal Arg-Gly-Ser-(His)6 tag was added to the AtsA protein. This was achieved after adding a corresponding oligonucleotide (noncoding sequence: CGGGATCCTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCGATCCTCT) to the lastatsA codon and subcloning of the PCR product as aXhoI/BamHI fragment back into the corresponding template plasmid. Protein expression was achieved after transforming E. coliDH5α with pBluescript II KS containing the described atsconstructs. For coexpression of atsA and atsBfrom two different plasmids (Fig. 2 A) a double transformation was performed using atsA cloned into pBBR1MCS and atsB cloned into pBluescript II KS. Double transformants were selected due to their ampicillin and chloramphenicol resistance. The presence of the two genes was verified by PCR analysis. The transformed cells were grown aerobically in Luria-Bertani medium with constant shaking at 37 °C. After 2–3 h 1 mm isopropyl thiogalactopyranoside was added and growth continued for another 5–6 h. Preparation of periplasm from these cells and purification of the His6-tagged proteins on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) under native conditions was carried out according to the protocols (The QIAexpressionist) given by the manufacturer. Expression of the recombinant sulfatase protein was quantitated by Western blotting using polyclonal antibodies raised against the native arylsulfatase protein purified fromKlebsiella (7Miech C. Dierks T. Selmer T. von Figura K. Schmidt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4835-4837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The used antibodies showed no cross-reactivity with E. coli antigens after purification of the antiserum by pre-adsorption to immobilized E. coliprotein. Protein determinations were carried out according to Bradford or Lowry (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar, 24Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of the recombinant sulfatase was determined in duplicate assays using p-nitrocatechol sulfate as a substrate (7Miech C. Dierks T. Selmer T. von Figura K. Schmidt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4835-4837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It was verified that these determinations were carried out under initial rate conditions at saturating substrate concentration (V max determinations). The purified AtsA-His6 protein was almost devoid of any contaminating proteins (>95% purity), as checked by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3,A and C) and RP-HPLC on a C4 column (not shown). The presence of FGly at the protein level was determined after subjecting the purified AtsA-His6 protein to treatment with NaB[3H]H4 under denaturing conditions, desalting, SDS-PAGE, and fluorography (Fig. 3, A andC), as had been described previously (8Dierks T. Miech C. Hummerjohann J. Schmidt B. Kertesz M.A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25560-25564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The presence of FGly at the peptide and amino acid level was determined after tryptic digestion of AtsA-His6 protein, treated or not with NaB[3H]H4, and purification of tryptic peptides by RP-HPLC, which was performed as described (8Dierks T. Miech C. Hummerjohann J. Schmidt B. Kertesz M.A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25560-25564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Fractions from RP-HPLC were analyzed by liquid scintillation counting, amino acid sequencing, radiosequencing, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry using indole-2-carboxylic acid andp-nitroaniline as a matrix (8Dierks T. Miech C. Hummerjohann J. Schmidt B. Kertesz M.A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25560-25564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 10Schmidt B. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. von Figura K. Cell. 1995; 82: 271-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In order to study the role of theatsB gene on expression of active Klebsiellaarylsulfatase, encoded by the atsA gene, we needed the cloned atsBA operon. Since the atsBA plasmid described previously (18Murooka Y. Ishibashi K. Yasumoto M. Sasaki M. Sugino H. Azakami H. Yamashita M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2131-2140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was not available, we generated a subgenomic bank of Klebsiella DNA and identified the entireatsBA operon on a 6.8-kbp BamHI fragment (see “Experimental Procedures”). The DNA sequence of a subcloned 3832-bpBamHI/XcmI fragment (accession number AJ131525) revealed that the atsB ORF codes for an iron sulfur protein consisting of 395 amino acid residues, i.e. 10 residues less than published previously (Ref. 18Murooka Y. Ishibashi K. Yasumoto M. Sasaki M. Sugino H. Azakami H. Yamashita M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2131-2140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, GenBankTM accession number M31938), and lacking a signal peptide (Fig.1). The atsA ORF, on the other hand, encodes the arylsulfatase protein consisting of 577 amino acid residues, i.e. 113 residues more than published by Murookaet al. (18Murooka Y. Ishibashi K. Yasumoto M. Sasaki M. Sugino H. Azakami H. Yamashita M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2131-2140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and including a 20 residues signal peptide directing translocation of this protein into the periplasm (Fig. 1). The correctness of the revised atsA sequence was verified on the protein level by mass spectrometry and amino acid sequencing of several tryptic peptides of purified Klebsiellaarylsulfatase protein (7Miech C. Dierks T. Selmer T. von Figura K. Schmidt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4835-4837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), including peptide 44 (GLTAGDAPWQ, residues 487–496), which is located within the extra 113 residues predicted from the revised DNA sequence. This C-terminal part of the protein was found to be essential for enzyme activity (data not shown). The protein sequence directly following the serine 72 to be converted to FGly (SAPARSMLLTGN, residues 72–83) is homologous to the sequence motif directing FGly modification in human arylsulfatase A (Ref. 16Dierks T. Lecca M.R. Schlotterhose P. Schmidt B. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2084-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, see Introduction). Although E. coli carries three sulfatase-related genes (25Schirmer A. Kolter R. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: R181-R186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), active endogenous sulfatases have not yet been found in this species. Transformation of E. coli with theatsA gene of P. aeruginosa (8Dierks T. Miech C. Hummerjohann J. Schmidt B. Kertesz M.A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25560-25564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) or with theKlebsiella atsBA operon (18Murooka Y. Ishibashi K. Yasumoto M. Sasaki M. Sugino H. Azakami H. Yamashita M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2131-2140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), however, leads to the expression of active arylsulfatases. Since in prokaryotes arylsulfatase expression is repressed during growth in the presence of sulfate, we cloned the atsBA operon without its endogenous promoter into an expression vector downstream of the lac promoter (Fig.1), allowing controlled expression at logarithmic growth in Luria-Bertani medium. E. coli DH5α transformed with theatsBA plasmid was found to express high arylsulfatase activities reaching a maximum of 2–3 units/mg of cell protein after aerobic growth for 5–6 h in the presence of isopropyl thiogalactopyranoside (Fig.2 A, lane 1). The recombinant AtsA protein was detected by Western blotting using antibodies against the purified Klebsiella arylsulfatase (Fig. 2) and was found to be located in the periplasm (not shown). Its electrophoretic mobility was in agreement with the predicted mass of 62,230 Da (Figs. 2 and 3 A) and was identical to the mobility of the arylsulfatase purified fromKlebsiella (not shown). AtsB and AtsA are coexpressed from a bicistronic transcript. Since we wanted to study AtsA and AtsB independently, we cloned each of the two ORFs separately downstream of the lac promoter into two vectors carrying different selection markers, thus allowing selection of double transformants. The AtsA protein expressed by these double transformants showed a similar specific activity when compared with the bicistronic expression, as concluded from the activities and Western blot signals determined (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and2). Most interestingly, expression of atsA alone did not lead to any detectable sulfatase activity (<1 milliunits/mg of cell protein), although the AtsA protein was produced at normal levels (Fig.2 A, lane 3). Since expression of atsBalone also did not lead to any sulfatase activity (Fig. 2 A,lane 4), it has to be concluded that the atsBgene product has a posttranslational function that is essential for the AtsA arylsulfatase to gain its enzymatic activity. The dependence of active AtsA expression on a functional atsB gene was confirmed by the bicistronic expression of atsA together with an atsB fragment that carried a 882-bp in-frame deletion corresponding to amino acid residues 89–382 of AtsB (see Fig.1). As a consequence of this deletion, no arylsulfatase activity was measurable, although the AtsA protein was present (Fig. 2 A,lane 5). This rules out that the dissection of the bicistronic gene organization abolished active AtsA expression. TheatsB gene product rather acts in trans on the AtsA protein, as shown by the coexpression of AtsB and AtsA from two different plasmids. In order to analyze the expressed AtsA protein for the presence of FGly in position 72, the recombinant arylsulfatase had to be purified. To facilitate purification we expressed the AtsA protein in a His-tagged form (AtsA-His6). This protein showed a similar catalytic activity as wild-type AtsA (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1 and2). The AtsA-His6 protein was purified from the periplasm of the cells by chromatography on nickel-agarose, yielding a homogenous protein preparation (>95% purity), as checked by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3 A) and RP-HPLC (not shown). This preparation showed a specific enzymatic activity of 73 units/mg of purified protein (Fig.2 B, lane 4). As expected, the AtsA-His6 protein purified from E. coliexpressing only the structural gene but not the atsB gene showed no activity (Fig. 2 B, lane 3, and Fig.3 C). To examine whether serine 72 was converted to FGly, the purified AtsA-His6 proteins, expressed in the absence (AtsA-His6(−B)) or presence of AtsB (AtsA-His6(+B)), were denatured and incubated with NaB[3H]H4. This treatment reduces the formyl group of FGly leading to formation of a [3H]serine residue (7Miech C. Dierks T. Selmer T. von Figura K. Schmidt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4835-4837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 8Dierks T. Miech C. Hummerjohann J. Schmidt B. Kertesz M.A. von Figura K. J. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 82: 271-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). After gel filtration aliquots of the protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining and fluorography. Thereby it turned out that AtsA-His6(+B) carried a 3H label, whereas AtsA-His6(−B) did not (Fig. 3, A and C). The proteins were subjected to digestion with trypsin, and the tryptic peptides were separated by RP-HPLC. The radioactivity recovered during chromatography of the AtsA-His6(+B) peptides was found to be associated with a single tryptic peptide showing a mass of 1590 Da (Fig.3 B). A mass of 1589.8 Da is predicted for the serine 72-containing form of peptide 2 (P2) comprising residues 63–76 of the AtsA protein. In the corresponding fractions of the tryptic peptides of AtsA-His6(−B) a 1590-Da peptide was also identified; the radioactivity measured in these fractions, however, did not exceed the background level (Fig. 3 D). Sequencing of the 1590-Da peptides in both cases led to the amino acid sequence of P2 comprising a serine in position 72 (Fig. 4,A and B). However, only in the case of P2 from AtsA-His6(+B) radioactivity was released in the 10th sequencing cycle corresponding to serine 72 (Fig. 4 C). This indicates that prior to reduction FGly had been present in position 72, which by treatment with NaB[3H]H4 was reduced to [3H]serine. On the contrary, no release of radioactivity in any of 15 cycles was observed during sequencing of the HPLC fractions containing P2 from AtsA-His6(−B) (not shown). In conclusion, the atsB gene product is required to oxidize serine 72 to FGly in the newly synthesized sulfatase polypeptide. To determine the FGly content in the recombinant AtsA-His6(+B) protein, we analyzed its tryptic peptides without prior treatment of the protein with NaB[3H]H4. In the HPLC chromatogram a peptide with a mass of 1588 Da was identified eluting at a 0.4 min earlier retention time than the 1590-Da P2 (Fig.5, A–C). A mass of 1587.8 Da is predicted for the FGly 72-containing form of peptide 2 (P2*). The presence of the FGly was verified when using p-nitroaniline as a matrix for matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry, which led to a mass of 1708 Da for P2* (Fig.5 D). The increase in mass by 120 Da, which was not observed for P2 (Fig. 5 E), is due to a Schiff base formation ofp-nitroaniline and the formyl group of P2* (7Miech C. Dierks T. Selmer T. von Figura K. Schmidt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4835-4837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 8Dierks T. Miech C. Hummerjohann J. Schmidt B. Kertesz M.A. von Figura K. J. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 82: 271-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The presence of the FGly in P2* could also be demonstrated by amino acid sequencing. Whereas the entire sequence of P2 could be determined (Fig.5G), almost no recovery of the residues C-terminal of position 72 (X in Fig. 5 F) was observed in the case of P2*. In addition, the signal for methionine 71 was reduced in P2*. The presence of a FGly residue is known to block Edman degradation at the position of the FGly and to reduce its efficiency in the preceding cycle (7Miech C. Dierks T. Selmer T. von Figura K.

Cell. 1995; 82: 271-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). From the sequencing data (Fig. 5, F andG) the FGly content of AtsA-His6(+B) was calculated to be 48 ± 2%. Thus, the modification degree observed for the recombinant sulfatase in E. coli is similar to the degree of 60% determined previously for the protein purified fromKlebsiella (7Miech C. Dierks T. Selmer T. von Figura K. Schmidt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4835-4837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that the atsB gene product is required for FGly modification in the arylsulfatase ofK. pneumoniae. This modification is a prerequisite for sulfatase activity, as had been shown previously for other pro- and eukaryotic sulfatases (8Dierks T. Miech C. Hummerjohann J. Schmidt B. Kertesz M.A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25560-25564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 9Selmer T. Hallmann A. Schmidt B. Sumper M. von Figura K. Eur. J.

Cell. 1995; 82: 271-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In the absence of a functionalatsB gene inactive sulfatase polypeptides were synthesized lacking the FGly. In the presence of atsB, however, 48% of the recombinant sulfatase molecules, expressed in His-tagged form inE. coli, carried the FGly leading to an overall specific activity of 73 units/mg of purified protein. This approximately agrees with the modification efficiency of 60% and a specific activity of 123 units/mg determined for the wild-type protein purified from K. pneumoniae. Extrapolated to 100% FGly content, activities of 152 or 205 units/mg, respectively, are calculated for the two protein preparations. These results rule out that AtsB acts as a transcriptional activator, as had been suggested originally (19Azakami H. Sugino H. Yokoro N. Iwata N. Murooka Y. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6287-6292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Azakami H. Sugino H. Iwata N. Yokoro N. Yamashita M. Murooka Y. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 164: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). AtsB rather plays an essential role in the posttranslational oxidation of a conserved serine to FGly. The data, furthermore, show that FGly formation involves an enzyme-mediated process. This agrees with the finding that in man a genetic defect is the cause for the lack of FGly in sulfatases from multiple sulfatase deficiency patients (10Schmidt B. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. von Figura K. Cell. 1995; 82: 271-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 13Kolodny E.H. Fluharty A.L. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2693-2741Google Scholar). In E. coli, absence of AtsB does not lead to a general deficiency of FGly formation. While oxidation of serine to FGly is abolished under these conditions, oxidation of cysteine in the sulfatase of P. aeruginosa occurs with maximum efficiency (8Dierks T. Miech C. Hummerjohann J. Schmidt B. Kertesz M.A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25560-25564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, E. coli obviously harbors a second FGly-generating system that is independent of atsB and may specifically oxidize cysteine but not serine. The latter is concluded from the observation that substitution of the critical cysteine by serine abolished FGly formation in the Pseudomonas sulfatase (8Dierks T. Miech C. Hummerjohann J. Schmidt B. Kertesz M.A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25560-25564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Whether or not the Klebsiella atsB gene would promote FGly formation in this substitution mutant remains to be investigated. Modification of both serine-type and cysteine-type sulfatases most likely occurs in the cytosol, since in the former case the AtsB protein, and in the latter case the sulfatase itself, lack a signal peptide. Although no endogenous sulfatase activity has ever been measuredin E. coli, this species carries two genes encoding putative serine-type sulfatases termed aslA and f571(GenBankTM accession numbers M87049 and U00096). Like theKlebsiella atsA gene, also aslA andf571 have an adjacent gene in the same operon (aslB and f390, respectively) encoding an AtsB homolog of about 400 amino acids (25Schirmer A. Kolter R. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: R181-R186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These homologs did not take over function in the absence of AtsB. All three AtsB homologs are 34–41% identical and represent iron sulfur proteins that comprise three conserved cysteine clusters, each consisting of 3–5 cysteines with short and conserved distances between these cysteines (25Schirmer A. Kolter R. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: R181-R186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Most iron sulfur proteins are involved in redox reactions and function as electron transfer proteins (26Beinert H. Holm R.H. Münck E. Science. 1997; 277: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). Therefore we speculate that also AtsB functions as an oxidoreductase oxidizing the critical serine of the unfolded sulfatase polypeptide during or shortly after synthesis and, at the same time, transferring electrons to an acceptor molecule. AtsB may act directly on the sulfatase polypeptide or may oxidize and thereby regenerate the electron acceptor. The role of AtsB homologs in sulfatase activation is highlighted by a paper reporting that Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron mutated in the atsB-related chuR gene is defective in the utilization of two sulfated substrates, namely chondroitin sulfate and heparin (27Cheng Q. Hwa V. Salyers A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7185-7193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No chondroitin sulfatase activity was detectable in this mutant, which, however, was ascribed to transcriptional regulation of chondroitin sulfate and heparin utilizing genes by chuR. Further AtsB homologs that are similar in size, but carry only 1 or 2 cysteine clusters, can also be found among a group of proteins involved in the synthesis of cofactors such as PQQ, molybdopterin, Fe-Mo cofactor, tungsten cofactor, or heme d1 (28Goosen N.

Interestingly, one of the homologs without known function is YidF ofE. coli and is encoded in the yid operon also coding for the cysteine-type sulfatase YidJ (33Burland V. Plunkett III, G. Daniels D.L. Blattner F.R. Genomics. 1993; 16: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). YidF is a 165-amino acids protein showing 19% identity to the C-terminal half of AtsB. It may therefore be involved in FGly modification of cysteine-type sulfatases (25Schirmer A. Kolter R. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: R181-R186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).

This level of conservation does not extend to the axonemal dynein heavy chains, suggesting functional differences between the two. Dimerization appears to occur through a different mechanism than the heavy chain-intermediate chain interaction. We corroborate the in vitro interactions with in vivo expression of heavy chain fragments in Dictyostelium. Fragments lacking the interaction domain express well, without an obvious phenotype.

Dynein is a microtubule-associated motor protein that is responsible for several distinct motility processes in eukaryotic cells (reviewed in Refs. 1Holzbaur E.L.F. Vallee R.B. Annu. Rev.

Science. 1996; 271: 1539-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The dynein superfamily is divided into two major classes based primarily on their cellular function. Cytoplasmic dyneins act in positioning and transport of membrane-bound organelles and help organize spindle assembly during cell division. The more heterogeneous axonemal dyneins are largely responsible for the beating motions of eukaryotic cilia and flagella. All dyneins characterized to date are composed of multiple subunits. A complete dynein molecule typically contains two or three heavy chains (DHC) 1The abbreviations used are: DHC, dynein heavy chain; DIC, dynein intermediate chain; aa, amino acid(s); Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HSS, high speed supernatant(s); BSA, bovine serum albumin; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate); EDC, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide with molecular masses of >400 kDa; intermediate chains (DIC) of 70–80 kDa, some of which have been localized to the dynein tail (4King S.M.

Many cytoplasmic forms also contain at least two light-intermediate chains (50–60 kDa) (9Gill S.R. Cleveland D.W. Schroer T.A. Mol. Biol.

Comparisons between axonemal and cytoplasmic dyneins suggest a functional division of the DHC into two regions. The carboxyl-terminal two-thirds is conserved and comprises the motor domain (11Vallee R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8769-8772Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Gibbons I.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 32: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 13Koonce M.P. Samsó M. Mol.

The more divergent amino-terminal third forms at least part of the stalk and likely forms a scaffold upon which most of the other subunits assemble to form the cargo-binding tail (1Holzbaur E.L.F. Vallee R.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 339-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 11Vallee R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 751-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The molecular interactions within the dynein tail are not well understood. They are important, however, because variation in the subunit composition is thought to specify and regulate cargo binding either directly or by controlling the interaction of dynein with other proteins such as dynactin (16Sweeney H.L.

Cell. 1997; 8: 2077-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Our work in Dictyostelium has shown that overexpression of the motor domain in this organism dramatically alters the interphase microtubule array, but the cells are viable (13Koonce M.P. Samsó M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 935-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In contrast, a fragment containing the amino-terminal region can only be expressed at low levels; its overexpression appears to be lethal (21Koonce M.P. Knecht D.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Because this fragment can associate with the native DHC in vivo (21Koonce M.P. Knecht D.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), its overexpression may cause the formation of one-headed or headless dyneins that can bind cargo but cannot function as motors (see also Ref. 22Sakakibara H. Mitchell D.R. Kamiya R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 113: 615-622Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To further investigate the toxic effect of this dynein fragment, and characterize its domain structure, we have initiated a functional dissection of the DHC amino terminus from Dictyostelium. We identify here a highly conserved region that is important for DHC homodimerization and for intermediate chain binding. Both these interactive properties are confined to the same region of the DHC; however, they have different sequence requirements and are biochemically distinct in vitro. We further correlate these results with expression of similar regions of the DHC in vivo. This is the first identification of a subunit-interaction domain in a cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain, and it provides a target for investigations into the structure and assembly dynamics of the dynein tail. A fragment containing the amino-terminal 4007 base pairs of the Dictyostelium DHC cDNA was subcloned into the pET5 expression vector (Novagen) just downstream of the T7 transcription initiation site. Smaller amino-terminal fragments were generated by endo- and exonuclease digestion and cloned into pET5 or pRSET (Invitrogen) expression vectors (see Fig. 5 for summary). A construct encoding the full-length Dictyostelium DIC cDNA (652 aa, GenBankTM accession number U25116 (23Triviños-Lagos L. Collins C.A. Chisholm R.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4 (suppl.): 47aGoogle Scholar)), subcloned into pET 14 (Novagen), was used for the initial stages of this work. However, we found that a large EcoRI fragment of the DIC cDNA (aa 65–613) shows the same binding activity as the full-length DIC but is produced in greater amounts by BL21(DE3) cells. It is used almost exclusively in the data presented here. Plasmids were purified according to the alkaline lysis/polyethylene glycol method (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.38-1.41Google Scholar). Expression vectors encoding the DHC amino-terminal fragment and the full-length and partial DIC cDNAs were expressed in BL21(DE3) cells. Polypeptides were purified from inclusion bodies following the methods of Lin and Cheng (25Lin K. Cheng S. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 748-753PubMed Google Scholar). Inclusion bodies were solubilized in renaturing buffer (50 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 80, 20% glycerol, pH 7.6) containing 8 m urea. Soluble protein was clarified at 25,000 × g for 20 min and adjusted to a concentration of 2 mg/ml. This solution was dialyzed stepwise at 2-h intervals against 25 volumes of buffer with decreasing concentrations of urea (4, 2, 0 m), then against CNBr coupling buffer (100 mm NaHCO3, 500 mm NaCl, pH 8.3) overnight, and clarified at 25,000 × g for 20 min. The concentration of soluble protein was determined by the Bradford assay, and the protein was then coupled to one-fourth volume activated CNBr resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) overnight. This resulted in a final protein concentration on the resin of ∼3 mg/ml. The affinity resin was blocked with 1 m glycine or 100 mm Tris, pH 8, washed, and stored in PHEM buffer (60 mm Pipes, 25 mm HEPES, 8 mm EGTA, 2 mmMgCl2, pH 6.9 (26Schliwa M. van Blerkom J. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 222-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar)) containing 0.02% sodium azide on ice. DHC constructs were expressed in vitro using the TnT™ reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). 50 μl of the reaction mixture was brought to 500 μl with PHEM + 250 mm NaCl (PHEM 250). This concentration of NaCl reduces nonspecific interactions between protein and resin but does not disrupt the subunit organization of native cytoplasmic dynein (not shown). The diluted lysate was clarified at 18,000 × g for 20 min and divided equally into two or three aliquots. Each aliquot was brought to 1 ml with PHEM 250 and incubated with 50 μl of the appropriate affinity or control resin at 4 °C for 2–4 h. The resin was washed three times with 1-ml volumes of PHEM 250, resuspended in an equal volume of 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and boiled. Bound polypeptides were resolved by electrophoresis through a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Reticulocyte-lysate expressed bands were detected by soaking the gel in Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), drying, and exposing to film. The amount of [35S]methionine-labeled polypeptide was determined using a Fujix phosphoimage BAS 2000 scanner (Fuji). Bands were selected and analyzed with TINA analysis software (Raytest) using the Autocontour feature. DHC amino-terminal fragments were expressed in vitro as described above. The sample was divided into two or three aliquots and brought to 50 μl by addition of buffer containing 4 μl of DSP stock in N,N-dimethylformamide (final concentration 0.8 mg/ml), EDC stock in H2O (final concentration 0.16 mg/ml), or addition of N,N-dimethylformamide or water as control. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped with 5 μl of 1 m ethanolamine. Samples were brought to 500 μl with PHEM 250, clarified at 18,000 × g for 20 min, and then incubated with antibodies raised against the DHC amino terminus (27Koonce M.P. Grissom P.M. McIntosh J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1597-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) bound to Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The immunoprecipitate resin was then washed three times, and bound polypeptides were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The data from the DHC-DHC and DHC-DIC affinity resin experiments were examined using a cluster analysis (28Kaufman L. Rousseeuw P.J. Finding Groups in Data: An Introduction to Cluster Analysis. Wiley-Interscience, New York1990Crossref Google Scholar). A set of 1000 distributions was generated by randomly assigning a fragment to one of two groups, and a mean group affinity was calculated. For each distribution, the mean squared error from the group mean was calculated for every fragment. The randomly generated distribution that had the lowest G statistic (defined as the sum of all mean squared errors) was designated as “best” and was used as the basis for designating fragments as either binding or nonbinding. Amino-terminal constructs were tagged by oligonucleotide addition of the c-Myc epitope (29Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar) (details available upon request). These were subcloned downstream of the native DHC promoter on a plasmid containing a G418 selection marker (13Koonce M.P. Samsó M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 935-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 21Koonce M.P. Knecht D.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Fresh AX-2 cell spores were plated onto 10-cm plastic Petri dishes and were transformed with plasmid DNA (13Koonce M.P. Samsó M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 935-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 21Koonce M.P. Knecht D.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) just before the cells reached confluency, at about 107 cells/dish. Following an overnight recovery, the medium was changed to include 10 μg/ml G418. Colonies were detected after 3–5 days of drug selection. Individual clones were picked with a pipette and transferred to a 24-well plate. Preparation of high speed supernatants (HSS), electrophoresis, and immunoblotting were performed as described in (30Koonce M.P. McIntosh J.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1990; 15: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). c-Myc-tagged polypeptides were purified from HSS by incubating 1 ml of supernatant with 25 μl of anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody from ascites for 1 h at 4 °C. 25 μl of Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was then added to bind the antibodies. The resin was washed three times and resuspended in 50 μl of PHEM buffer. Bound polypeptides were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Previous work has suggested that the heavy chains of cytoplasmic dynein associate directly in the absence of other dynein subunits (31Mazumdar M. Mikami A. Gee M. Vallee R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 6552-6556Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because the two heavy chains are believed to interact within the amino-terminal third of the DHC, we tested whether this region can dimerize in vitro. A reticulocyte lysate expressing the amino-terminal 1327 aa (151 kDa) of the DHC was exposed to either DSP or EDC cross-linkers to covalently link polypeptides in close contact with one another. DSP is approximately 8 Å in length and cross-links the ε-amine of lysine residues; EDC is a zero-length cross-linker that forms a covalent bond between aspartate or glutamate and lysine. As indicated in Fig.1, both cross-linkers produced labeled bands of MW ∼300 kDa, a value close to the predicted dimer weight of the amino-terminal fragment. To further investigate DHC dimerization, a construct encoding the amino-terminal 1327 aa of Dictyostelium DHC was expressed inEscherichia coli (see Fig.2 A) and coupled to Sepharose, producing a DHC affinity resin. Two types of control resins were constructed to measure nonspecific interactions: non-dynein proteins (actin or BSA) bound to Sepharose at the same concentration, and a similarly-treated protein-free resin. Incubation of the DHC affinity resin with the same, in vitroexpressed polypeptide showed an approximately 3-fold higher retention of the soluble fragment than on control resins (Fig. 2, Band C). This suggests that the bound and soluble fragments interact in the assay. The resin-bound DHC fragment does not retain protein indiscriminately; luciferase does not bind to the affinity resin any more strongly than to the control resins. Moreover, the resins do not retain any of the more abundant protein components of the reticulocyte lysate at levels detectable by Coomassie Blue staining (not shown). To determine a minimal HC fragment that supports dimerization, we produced a series of smaller fragments (summarized in Fig. 5) and tested their ability to interact with the DHC resin and to cross-link. As expected, the fragments showed different affinities for DHC resin (Fig.3 A). Specific retention was measured as the ratio of band intensity on the affinity resin to its relevant control. These ratios fell into two groups, suggesting a defined binding site which some, but not all, constructs contain. One group comprises DHC fragments that bind more than twice as efficiently to affinity resin than to control resin; these were considered to contain the binding site. In all cases, these polypeptides bound to DHC resin at least as well as did the full-length DHC amino terminus. The second group consists of those that exhibit a mean affinity resin:control resin intensity ratio of less than 2; these were considered noninteractors. Such low ratios are similar to the nonspecific behavior exhibited by luciferase in this system (see Fig.2 B). Statistical analyses showed that, relative to the stated null distribution, these results are significant (Pvalue of 0.04). All of the constructs that showed binding activity contain the region between aa 627 and 780. No fragment lacking this region showed binding ability. However, this region alone is not sufficient for dimer interaction in vitro. These fragments also displayed differential cross-linking properties (Fig. 3 B). Two fragments, encoding aa 567–1327 and 629–1327, generated high molecular weight bands in the presence of cross-linker. Both novel bands are approximately double the predicted mass of the expressed fragments, suggesting dimerization rather than nonspecific cross-linking to reticulocyte lysate proteins. DHC fragments that only contain the central region produced some faint higher molecular weight smearing in the presence of DSP, but no distinct banding patterns could be detected. The fragments of the DHC amino terminus that do not contain the central region do not form high molecular weight species in the presence of cross-linker. While the affinity resin and cross-linking assays do not generate identical results (summarized in Fig. 5), this may reflect subtle differences between the interactions being measured; the resin work measures the ability of a fragment to interact with the full 1327-aa amino-terminal polypeptide, whereas the cross-linking evaluates the interaction between two identical polypeptides. Nonetheless, the two assays agree that there is a crucial dimerization core region between aa 629 and 780, whose interaction is supported by flanking sequence on the carboxyl-terminal side. This additional sequence may play a role in stabilizing the structure of the interaction region. Because DHC amino terminus is also predicted to interact with the DIC, we constructed an affinity resin with bacterially expressed DIC and tested its ability to bind the DHC amino terminus. Reticulocyte-lysate-produced DHC also binds to DIC resin (Fig.4 A), with a 4-fold mean enhancement of binding over control. As in the DHC affinity resin, luciferase does not show an increased affinity for the DIC resin. This indicates that the DHC amino terminus also contains a binding site for the DIC. To search for a DIC interaction site within the DHC amino terminus, we tested the ability of the DHC fragment series to interact with DIC resin (Fig. 4 B). The mapping pattern is similar to the DHC dimerization work but defines a smaller minimal region for this activity. The best statistical grouping of fragments predicted to contain the DIC-DHC interaction site is attained when fragments 1–1327, 567–1327, 629–1327, 1–730, 1–940, and 534–760 contain the site (P value = 0.012) (Fig. 5). This suggests that the DIC interaction site is located within aa 629–730, just upstream of the DHC-DHC site. Despite mapping to the same region of the DHC sequence, the DHC and the DIC binding activities are not identical. We analyzed the resin assay interaction under conditions of varying ionic strength. While the homodimerization of the 1327-aa DHC fragments was salt-sensitive, the DHC-DIC interaction was stable even in the presence of 2 mNaCl (Fig. 6). This suggests that the DHC-DHC and the DHC-DIC interact through different mechanisms. Thein vitro DHC-DIC interaction is partially disrupted in the presence of 0.6 m KI (not shown), a result consistent with the dissociation of the intermediate chain from native chicken cytoplasmic dynein (9Gill S.R. Cleveland D.W. Schroer T.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Previous attempts to overexpress the 1327-aa amino-terminal region of DHC inDictyostelium suggest that large amounts of this polypeptide are toxic (21Koonce M.P. Knecht D.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A reasonable interpretation is that the fragment interacts with native dynein to produce defective molecules that impact cell viability. Because our in vitro work suggests that the central amino-terminal region is crucial for dynein assembly, fragments containing only this region should disrupt dynein assembly in vivo and cause severe phenotypic effects. To test this hypothesis, we attempted to express DHC constructs comprising aa 1–567 (amino), 567–817 (central), and 780–1327 (carboxy) inDictyostelium. The amino- and carboxy-fragment expression is shown in Fig. 7. In cells containing either of these two constructs, a single polypeptide of the predicted size is abundantly expressed and is readily immunoprecipitated by anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody. Consistent with the in vitrowork, none of the dominant dynein subunits (DHC, DIC, or light intermediate chains) appear to co-purify here (Fig. 7) or on a c-Myc immunoaffinity column (not shown). Moreover, cells expressing these fragments do not have obvious phenotypic defects and grow at rates similar to those of wild type cells. In contrast, attempts to express the central region (aa 561–817) of the amino terminus have been unsuccessful. Despite several transformations, no viable clones have been identified that express detectable levels of the predicted 29 kDa fragment. The results described above suggest that at least two activities important for dynein subunit assembly are localized to a relatively small region of the DHC amino terminus. Sequences from nine species were compared with the amino-terminal region of the DHC of Dictyostelium(Fig. 8 A). Homologous regions were aligned and the degree of identity to the Dictyosteliumsequence was determined for intervals of 100 aa. While the amino-terminal region is generally not as conserved as the rest of the polypeptide (1Holzbaur E.L.F. Vallee R.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 339-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 11Vallee R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8769-8772Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 27Koonce M.P. Grissom P.M. McIntosh J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1597-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), there are three striking areas of homology evident among the ten cytoplasmic sequences. The most conserved lies between aa 600 and 800 in the Dictyostelium sequence and includes the sequence we experimentally identify as essential for heavy-chain dimerization and heavy chain-intermediate chain binding. This further suggests that the assembly activities localized within aa 629–780 in Dictyostelium DHC are conserved among the other cytoplasmic dynein heavy chains. Sequences for the axonemal Chlamydomonas, sea urchin, andParamecium β DHCs, and for Chlamydomonas γ DHC, were also analyzed (Fig. 8 B). The amino terminus of theChlamydomonas β DHC interacts with several other dynein subunits (22Sakakibara H. Mitchell D.R. Kamiya R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 113: 615-622Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and the homologous regions of the sea urchin andParamecium β DHCs show regions of good conservation with the Chlamydomonas β sequence. However, the overall pattern of conservation within the β amino-terminal fragments is distinct from the cytoplasmic dyneins. The organization of the cytoplasmic dynein tail and the specific interactions between its subunits at the amino acid level have not been well characterized. Electron microscopy has been useful in localizing some of the subunits (4King S.M. Wilkerson C.G. Witman G.B. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 117: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and considerable progress has been made in investigating interactions of these subunits with other dynein-associated proteins (15Schroer T.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 18Karki S. Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Biol.

Subunit organization of axonemal dyneins has been primarily studied through isolation of dynein gene mutations (reviewed in Ref. 2Porter M.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These often produce organisms with nonlethal motility defects, which are amenable to biochemical and structural analyses. Similar analyses are becoming informative for cytoplasmic dyneins (21Koonce M.P. Knecht D.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 23Triviños-Lagos L.

A. 1996; 93: 4775-4780Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), mapping out the heavy chain domain structure and identifying the microtubule-binding motif. However, the physical organization of the cytoplasmic dynein tail has not been dissected in sufficient detail to identify heavy chain domains that mediate interactions with other subunits. Because the tail region links the motor to a cargo, understanding the interactions here is important in determining how dynein is targeted and regulated. Previous work in vivo suggested that the amino-terminal third of the dynein heavy chain is responsible for interactions between the DHCs and with other dynein subunits (21Koonce M.P. Knecht D.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 22Sakakibara H. Mitchell D.R. Kamiya R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 113: 615-622Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We used both chemical cross-linking and in vitro affinity methods here to identify a region that promotes DHC dimerization. This supports an earlier report suggesting recombinant cytoplasmic DHCs directly form multimers, even in the absence of other subunits (31Mazumdar M. Mikami A. Gee M. Vallee R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 6552-6556Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We have further determined that the sequences crucial for this interaction lie within an approximately 150-aa region of the DHC. While this core region is necessary for dimerization, it seems to function most efficiently in the context of flanking sequences. The additional amino acids may be important in stabilizing the structure of this central domain. The sequence on the carboxyl-terminal side, which likely forms at least part of the stalk connecting the tail to the globular head, is especially effective in this role. We also show that the central domain of the DHC amino terminus directly interacts with the dynein intermediate chain in vitro. The sequence does not appear to require an additional structural support to bind the DIC, suggesting that the DHC and DIC interactions are distinct and that their activities are not dependent on one another. The different biochemical properties of the two interactions lend strength to this hypothesis. The in vitro work is supported by in vivoexpression of DHC fragments. The amino- and carboxy-regions of the DHC amino terminus can be expressed at high levels inDictyostelium; selective immunoprecipitation of these fragments shows no evidence that they bind the DHC or DIC. We cannot rule out the possibility that the fragments are misfolded and their activities do not reflect native behavior. However, previous expression of the amino-terminal region indicated that larger fragments (158 kDa) are able to dimerize with a native heavy chain, suggesting some degree of proper folding (21Koonce M.P. Knecht D.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Attempts to overexpress the entire amino terminus in Dictyostelium led to the idea that this fragment contains a functional motif that can perturb native dynein activity, resulting in cell death. This lethal activity appears to be preserved within the central 29 kDa of the amino terminus, within the region we indicate contains the dimerization and DIC binding sites. We do not know whether the toxic effect is because of perturbation of DIC binding, dissociation of the two heavy chains, or both. Because most dyneins form multi-polypeptide assemblies through interactions in their tail, it seems reasonable to expect some degree of conservation within this region. While the amino-terminal tail region of the DHC is less conserved than the carboxyl-terminal head domain (1Holzbaur E.L.F. Vallee R.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 339-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 11Vallee R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8769-8772Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Gibbons I.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 32: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), it does contain small areas of strong conservation. The highest degree of sequence identity corresponds to the area we identify here to mediate DHC and DIC interactions. Among cytoplasmic heavy chains, this region is generally 40–65% identical to theDictyostelium sequence. Even the most divergent yeast sequences show some degree of conservation in this region. In contrast, axonemal dynein heavy chains show very little sequence conservation with cytoplasmic dyneins in this region (1, 2, 36–38, and this study). Given their conserved structures seen by electron microscopy, this seems surprising. It is certainly possible that tertiary structure is preserved in this region and that similar interaction mechanisms occur. However, axonemal dyneins more often form heterodimers or heterotrimers of distinct DHC polypeptides, whereas cytoplasmic dyneins dimerize from identical heavy chains. While the amino-terminal portion of the DHC is important for assembly in both cytoplasmic and axonemal dyneins, the mechanisms of interaction may be distinct. The current work suggests a functional division of the DHC amino terminus into three regions. The central core contains an interaction domain that assembles two heavy chains and binds the intermediate chain. Moreover, expression of this region in vivo appears to generate a tool to disrupt native dynein assembly and activity. Directed mutagenesis and in vivo expression should prove useful here in determining the exact location and mechanism of the DHC dimerization and DIC interaction sites, thereby providing information on the interaction dynamics of the cytoplasmic dynein tail.

For both RyRs, the stoichiometry is 4 FKBP/RyR.

To assess the amino acid residues of FKBP12.6 that are critical for selective binding to RyR2, the residues of FKBP12.6 that differ with FKBP12 were mutated to the respective residues of FKBP12. RyR2 of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum, prelabeled by exchange with [35S]FKBP12.6, was used as assay system for binding/exchange with the mutants. The triple mutant (Q31E/N32D/F59W) of FKBP12.6 was found to lack selective binding to the cardiac RyR2, comparable with that of FKBP12.0. In complementary studies, mutations of FKBP12 to the three critical amino acids of FKBP12.6, conferred selective binding to RyR2. Each of the FKBP12.6 and FKBP12 mutants retained binding to the skeletal muscle RyR1.

Recently, it has been suggested that FKBP12.6 may be involved in the regulation of insulin biosynthesis and secretion by modulating intracellular Ca2+ levels via RyR2 in rat pancreatic islets. It has been proposed that FKBP12.6 bound on RyR2 can be released by cyclic ADP-ribose, a metabolite of NAD+ during insulin secretion by glucose stimulation (21Noguchi N. Takasawa S. Nata K. Tohgo A.

In the present study, site-directed mutagenesis was used to determine the amino acid residues of FKBP12.6 that confer its selective association with the cardiac RyR2. The preparation of human FKBP12.6 mutants was carried out using site-directed mutagenesis system (QuickChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Briefly, the complementary DNA coding region of human FKBP12.6 was subcloned into the protein expression vector pET-3d at NcoI andBamHI sites as described previously (9Lam E. Martin M.M.

Using this plasmid as a DNA template, the mutants of FKBP12.6 were synthesized by polymerase chain reaction in the presence of a pair of complementary synthetic oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutation usingPfu DNA polymerase, which replicates both plasmid strands with high fidelity and without displacing the mutant oligonucleotide primers. Following temperature cycling of polymerase chain reaction, the parental DNA template was digested by DpnI endonuclease, which is specific for cleaving methylated and hemimethylated DNA, and the nicked vector DNA incorporating the desired mutations was then transformed into XL1-Blue supercompetent cells. The mutants were identified by sequencing using an Applied Biosystems Prism 377 automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems) with a Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Perkin-Elmer). The mutants with double or multiple amino acids mutations were subsequently made by using the single or multiple mutants as a template. The oligonucleotides primers used for mutagenesis were synthesized by changing the DNA sequences of FKBP12.6 to FKBP12. The same procedure described above was used to make FKBP12 mutants except using human recombinant FKBP12, which was also subcloned in the pET-3d expression vector, as a template and changing the DNA sequences from FKBP12 to FKBP12.6. The pET-3d plasmid containing human FKBP12.6, FKBP12, and their mutants were transformed into BL21 (DE3) competent cells, and the recombinant and mutated proteins were induced by isopropy-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. FKBPs and their mutants were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a TSK G3000SW column as described previously (23Xin H.B. Timerman A.P. Onoue H. Wiederrecht G.J. Fleischer S.

Two ml of an overnight culture from a single colony were inoculated into 200 ml of M9 medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and incubated at 37 °C with shaking (250 rpm). The bacteria were collected by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min (Beckman JA-14 rotor) when the OD600value of the bacteria reached to 0.5. The pelleted bacteria were resuspended in 200 ml of RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 50 mg/ml ampicillin, 1/40th of methionine, cystine, and glucose concentration compared with the regular RPMI 1640 medium and then isopropy-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mmfinal concentration) was added. A 2.5 mCi of [35S]methionine and [35S]cystine mixture (NEN Life Science Products) was then added to the medium after incubation at 37 °C for 15 min with shaking, and the bacteria were cultured for 5–6 h at the same conditions. The bacteria were collected by centrifugation, and the pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed by sonication (50% pules, 30-s intervals for 3 min, Branson Sonic Power Co.). The supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the DNA was precipitated by adding protamine sulfate (final concentration: 0.04%). Finally, the 35S-labeled FKBP12.6 or 35S-labeled FKBP12 was purified by HPLC using a TSK G3000SW column. The specific radioactivity of [35S]FKBP12.6 or [35S]FKBP12 in the time span of these experiments were changed from 6500 to 4500 cpm/pmol and from 2100 to 1500 cpm/pmol, respectively. Cardiac SR (CSR) was isolated from canine heart, and TC vesicles of SR were isolated from fast twitch rabbit skeletal muscle as described previously (24Chamberlain B. Levitsky D. Fleischer S. J.

The R3 fraction from the TC preparation of skeletal muscle SR was used in the35S-labeled FKBP12 exchange experiments, because in comparison with the highly enriched R4 TC fraction, which has higher concentration of high affinity ryanodine binding (of about 25 pmol/mg protein), the concentration of high affinity ryanodine binding site in the R3 fraction (about 8 pmol/mg of protein) was in a similar range to that of the CSR (5 pmol/mg of protein). Cardiac SR or skeletal muscle TC of SR (2.5 mg/ml) were prelabeled with [35S]FKBP12.6 or [35S]FKBP12 (3 μm) by exchange as described previously by incubating 30 min at 37 °C (15Timerman A.P.

The unbound [35S]FKBPs were separated from the [35S]FKBPs bound on CSR or skeletal muscle TC vesicles by sedimentation of 35,000 rpm (Beckman TL100.2 rotor) for 15 min at 4 °C. The cardiac SR or skeletal muscle TC vesicles were resuspended in imidazole homogenization medium (5 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.3 m sucrose) to a final concentration of 2.5 mg/ml. Skeletal muscle terminal cisternae of SR or cardiac SR were prelabeled by exchange with [35S]FKBP12.6 or [35S]FKBP12, respectively (see above), as described previously (15Timerman A.P. Ogunbumni E.

The EC50 for the release of [35S]FKBPs from such prelabeled SR by FKBPs and their mutants was used an index of FKBP binding to the ryanodine receptors. Briefly, [35S]FKBP12.6 and [35S]FKBP12 were used to label cardiac SR and skeletal muscle TC, respectively. The SR vesicles in a final concentration of 2 mg/ml were incubated with increasing concentrations of FKBPs or mutants at 37 °C for 30 min. The free [35S]FKBPs was separated from bound [35S]FKBPs by diluting a 50 μl of sample (120 μg of protein) into 200 μl of ice-cold imidazole homogenization medium buffer and immediately sedimenting the vesicles by centrifugation (95,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C). The pellet was quickly rinsed, then resuspended in 200 μl of distilled water and counted in 5 ml of Cytoscint liquid scintillation mixture. The protein concentration of SR membrane fractions was determined by the Lowry procedure (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and FKBPs and mutants by scanning densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels using a gel analysis and image processing system (Technology Resources Inc., Nashville, TN) (15Timerman A.P.

Bovine serum albumin was used as the protein standard. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis assay was performed with a mini-slab gel apparatus (Hoeffer Scientific) using the buffer system described by Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Human FKBP12.6 differs from FKBP12 by only 18 of 108 amino acids (9Lam E. Martin M.M. Timerman A.P. Sabers C. Fleischer S. Wiederrecht G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26511-26522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), yet FKBP12.6 selectively binds to and exchanges with bound FKBP12.6 on cardiac RyR2, whereas both FKBP isoforms bind to and exchange with bound FKBP12 of skeletal muscle RyR1 (16Timerman A.P. Onoue H. Xin H.-B. Barg S. Copello J. Wiederrecht G. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20385-20391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 22Barg S. Copello J.A. Wiederrecht G. Fleischer S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1726-C1733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The selective binding of FKBP12.6 to RyR2 must be referable to some of the 18 differing amino acid residues between the two FKBP isoforms (Fig.1). In order to identify which amino acid residues determine selective binding and exchange, we mutated some of the 18 differing amino acids of FKBP12.6 and assessed the decrease in selective exchange to RyR2. Since binding and exchange have been found to parallel one another, the EC50 for exchange,i.e. the concentration of the FKBP and/or mutants to release 50% of [35S]FKBP12.6 served as an index of FKBP12.6 binding to RyR2. A total of 14 single or multiple recombinant mutants of FKBP12.6 were made, and the concentration dependence for release of [35S]FKBP12.6 from prelabeled heart SR was plotted (Fig.2 A and TableI). We first made seven single and one double mutants by replacing the amino acids of FKBP12.6 with those of FKBP12. In the calibration of the system, the EC50 for exchange of FKBP12.6 to cardiac RyR2 was found to be approximately 620-fold lower than for FKBP12.0. That is, the EC50 of FKBP12.6 for release of [35S]FKBP12.6 from cardiac SR by exchange was 0.040 μm, compared with 24.9 μm for FKBP12. Two mutants of FKBP12.6, Q31E/N32D and F59W, with the EC50 values of 0.56 and 0.60 μm, respectively, have 14- and 15-fold decreased affinity for cardiac RyR2, respectively, compared with FKBP12.6. Other single mutants did not significantly decrease the affinity to cardiac RyR2. That is, the EC50 values are in a similar range (0.033–0.093 μm) (Table I and Fig. 2 A) as FKBP12.6 (0.040 μm). Based on these initial observations, one double mutant and three triple mutants were made. The triple mutant (Q31E/N32D/F59W) was devoid of selective binding to cardiac SR having an EC50 value of 19.7 μm, similar to FKBP12 (24.9 μm). Two other double mutants (Q31E/F59W and N32D/F59W) were made to assess whether two amino acids from this triple mutant were responsible for the selective binding to cardiac RyR2. The results show that both double mutants (Q31E/F59W and N32D/F59W) retained partial binding activity to cardiac RyR2 with EC50values of 7.83 and 2.14 μm, respectively (Fig.2 A, Table I).Figure 2Exchange of FKBPs mutants with [35S] FKBP12 .6 prelabeled CSR . CSR vesicles (2.5 mg/ml, Ref. 24Chamberlain B. Levitsky D. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6602-6609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were prelabeled by exchange with [35S]FKBP12.6 (3 μm) by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C. The displacement of [35S]FKBP12.6 from prelabeled CSR was carried out at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of varying concentrations of FKBP12, FKBP12.6, and FKBP12.6 mutants (A) or FKBP12 mutants (B). The [35S]FKBP12.6 remaining in the CSR vesicles was determined as described under “Experimental Procedure.” Each experiment was performed with two or three different preparations with each point in duplicate.

Open table in a new tab The EC50 values in Table I were obtained from exchange studies as shown in Fig. 2, A and B. If mutation of these three amino acid residues in FKBP12.6 is sufficient to wipe out selective binding to RyR2, then mutation of these residues in FKBP12 to that of FKBP12.6 should confer selective binding. Three mutants of FKBP12 (E31Q/D32N/W59F, E31Q/W59F, D32N/W59F) were made, in which the three key amino acids of FKBP12 were replaced by the respective residues of FKBP12.6. The results confirm that the triple mutant (E31Q/D32N/W59F) binds to cardiac RyR2 with a similar EC50 value (0.039 μm) as FKBP12.6 (0.040 μm). The double mutants (E31Q/W59F and D32N/W59F) bind partially to cardiac RyR2, with EC50 values of 0.52 and 1.83 μm, respectively (Fig. 2 B and TableI). A key control for validating the role of the three amino acid residues to confer selective binding to RyR2 is that the mutants retain their binding to RyR1. For this propose, skeletal muscle SR prelabeled by exchange with [35S]FKBP12 served as the assay system. We found that all of the FKBP12.6 and FKBP12 mutants retained their ability to exchange with FKBP bound to skeletal muscle RyR1. That is, the mutants had comparable binding affinity as FKBP12 or FKBP12.6, in the range of 0.037–0.3 μm (Fig. 3 and Table II).Table IIComparison of the EC50 and the relative exchange efficiency (REE) of FKBP12, FKBP12.6, and their mutants on [ 35S]FKBP12-labeled TC of skeletal muscle SRMutantsEC50REEμmFKBP12.60.092 ± 0.0091.0FKBP120.29 ± 0.043.2FKBP12.6 mutantsQ31E/N32D/F59W0.11 ± 0.011.2Q31E/F59W0.21 ± 0.022.3N32D/F59W0.037 ± 0.0050.4FKBP12 mutantsE31Q/D32N/W59F0.048 ± 0.0100.5E31Q/W59F0.042 ± 0.0060.5D32N/W59F0.056 ± 0.0090.6The EC50 values in Table II were obtained from exchange studies as shown in Fig 3. Open table in a new tab The EC50 values in Table II were obtained from exchange studies as shown in Fig 3. We conclude that three amino acids of FKBP12.6 (Gln31, Asn32, and Phe59) determine selective binding to RyR2. In this study, insight is provided into the nature of the interaction of FKBP with the RyRs of heart and skeletal muscle SR. FKBP12 and FKBP12.6 both bind to RyR1, whereas FKBP12.6 selectively binds to RyR2. In order to assess which amino acids of FKBP12.6 confer selective binding to RyR2, we carried out site-directed mutagenesis in nine amino acid residues that differ between the two FKBP isoforms. The assay for selective binding/exchange of FKBP12.6 to RyR2 was then used to assess which mutations alter the selectivity of binding. We find that only three amino acid residues of FKBP12.6 determine the selectivity of binding to RyR2. The triple amino acid mutation of FKBP12.6 (Q31E/N32D/F59W), replacing the amino acids of FKBP12.6 with the respective three amino acid residues in FKBP12, eliminates the selective binding for RyR2. In complementary experiments, FKBP12 can be made to selectively bind to RyR2 by mutating these same three amino acid residues (E31Q/D32N/W59F) to those in FKBP12.6. The fact that all mutants retain binding to skeletal muscle RyR1 with a similar affinity as wild type FKBPs, provides evidence that the three-dimensional structures of both FKBPs are stable and similar. We conclude that three amino acid residues (Gln31, Asn32, and Phe59) determine the selective binding of FKBP12.6 to the cardiac RyR2. The three-dimensional structures of FKBP12 and FKBP12-FK506 complexes have been determined to high resolution by x-ray crystallography and solution phase NMR (28Moore J.M. Peattie D.A.

Navia M.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 507-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Since there is close sequence homology (87%) between FKBP12 and FKBP12.6 (9Lam E. Martin M.M. Timerman A.P. Sabers C. Fleischer S. Wiederrecht G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26511-26522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), we carried out structure modeling studies of FKBP12.6 and its mutants using the three-dimensional structure of FKBP12 as the model. The 18 different amino acid residues of FKBP12.6 were substituted, and energy minimization was used to assess whether the three-dimensional structure changes. Three-dimensional structure models of FKBP12.6 were generated using the SWISS-MODEL software system based on the three-dimensional structure of FKBP12 (Fig. 4). The model of the structure of FKBP12.6 is quite similar to that of FKBP12. No major conformational changes were indicated between wild type FKBP12.6 and its double and triple mutants (Q31E/N32D/F59W, Q31E/F59W, and N32D/F59W) (not shown). Thus, no major structural changes are indicated between the two FKBP isoforms or when mutating the three amino acid residues that are critical for selective binding to RyR2. Schreiber and his colleagues reported that Tyr26, Phe46, Phe48, Trp59, Tyr82, and Phe99 of FKBP12 pack together to form a well defined hydrophobic core where FK506 and rapamycin bind. The indole ring of Trp59 is at the end of the pocket and serves as a platform for the pipecolinyl ring of FK506 (29Michnick S.W. Rosen M.K. Wandless T.J. Karplus M. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1991; 252: 836-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 30Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. Science. 1991; 252: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). It is likely that there is a similar hydrophobic pocket in FKBP12.6 for binding to FK506 as for FKBP12. The amino acids that form the pocket are conserved in both FKBPs with the exception of Phe59 in FKBP12.6, which replaces Trp59 in FKBP12. The hydrophobic characteristics of the pocket in FKBP12.6 would not be expected to be changed very much when Phe59 is mutated to Trp59, since both are hydrophobic amino acids. However, these two hydrophobic amino acid residues differ somewhat in size, so that steric constraints may contribute in part to the stability of interaction. The pocket is somewhat larger in FKBP12.6, since it contains the smaller phenylalanine residue instead of the tryptophan residue in FKBP12. Schreiber and co-workers (33Albers M.W. Walsh C.T. Schreiber S.L. J. Org. Chem. 1990; 55: 4984-4986Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar) studied the substrate specificity of rotamase enzymic activity of FKBP12 and suggested that FK506 acts as a peptidomimetic of leucine (twisted amide)-proline dipeptide. Snyder and co-workers (34Cameron A.D. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Fung E.T. Livingstone D.J. Aldape R.A. Ross C.A. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27582-27588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) further suggested that FKBP12 binds RyR1 at a conserved valine-proline peptide sequence (LSRLVPLDDLV). There is a similar conserved proline in cardiac RyR2 (LRSLIPLDDLV) but containing an isoleucine instead of a valine. The larger isoleucine in such a binding domain of RyR2 may be accommodated better by the larger pocket of FKBP12.6, which contains the smaller phenylalanine instead of tryptophan. Thus, steric factors may in part determine the selective binding of FKBP12.6 to cardiac RyR2, whereas both FKBPs bind to skeletal muscle RyR1. The decreased affinity for binding to cardiac RyR2 by mutating Gln31 and Asn32 of FKBP12.6 to Glu31 and Asp32 of FKBP12 represents an increase in two negative charges. This would suggest that charge repulsion may be a factor in the lack of binding of FKBP12 to RyR2. Our studies pinpoint the amino acid residues of FKBP12.6 that determine the selective interaction with RyR2. Since the structure of FKBP12.6 and FKBP12 appear to be similar, we infer that a difference in the structure of RyR1 and RyR2 also contributes to the selectivity of the interaction. We thank Dr. Gregory Wiederrecht, Department of Immunology, Merck Research Laboratories, for providing us human FKBP12 and FKBP12.6 plasmids. We also thank Dr. Andre Krezel, Department of Molecular Biology, Vanderbilt University, for helping us with the computer modeling of FKBP12.6 (Fig. 4)."

Efficiency of this intercellular process can be maximized by a simultaneous progress, with a time window, of other neighboring myoblasts in the differentiation program. This phenomenon has been described as the community effect. It proposes the existence of a molecule that acts as a differentiation-inducing signal to a group of identical cells. Here ,we show that neuregulin is a strong candidate for this molecule in myoblast differentiation. The expression of neuregulin increased rapidly but transiently at early stage of differentiation of rat L6 cells. Neuregulin showed a potent differentiation-promoting activity in membrane fusion and expression of myosin heavy chain. The antibodies raised against neuregulin and its cognate receptor ErbB3, which were capable of neutralizing the signal pathway, inhibited myotube formation and expression of myosin heavy chain in both L6 cells and primary rat myoblasts. The progress of differentiation was mostly halted after the expression of myogenin and cell cycle arrest. These results suggest that the activation of an autocrine signaling of neuregulin may provide a basic mechanism for the community effect observed in the differentiation of the embryonic muscle cells.

Embryonic induction, a process in which a signal from one group of cells regulates the development of an adjacent group of cells, provides a major paradigm for understanding of cellular basis of development. For certain differentiation processes, however, interactions within a group of cells in an autocrine manner become a great consideration (1Florini J.R. Ewton D.Z. Coolican S.A. Endocr.

The formation of skeletal muscle involves an intercellular process, in which mononucleated myoblasts form multinucleated myotubes by fusion of cellular membrane. The fusion involves specific cell-cell adhesion molecules that mediate recognition between myoblasts (10Redfield A. Nieman M.T. Knudsen K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1323-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 11Holt C.E. Lemaire P. Gurdon J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This process inevitably proposes the existence of a time window for fusion to occur, and spatiotemporal coordination becomes an important factor to accomplish the homogeneity and uniformity of differentiation. The community effect, presumably mediated by a local signal molecule made from the differentiating myoblasts, may establish this spatiotemporal coordination.

ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 are members of a subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases that are activated by NRG through direct or indirect interaction (14Plowman G.D. Green J.M. Culouscou J.M. Carlton G.W.

NRG is essential in the developing heart; NRG−/− embryos fail to form ventricular trabeculae and die in mid-gestation (16Meyer D. Birchmeier C. Nature. 1995; 378: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). In the developing nerves, NRG, ErbB2, and ErbB4 are required for the formation of the sympathetic nervous system, such as neural crest precursor cells (17Britsch S. Li L. Kirchhoff S. Theuring F. Brinkmann V. Birchmeier C. Riethmacher D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1825-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). NRGs, secreted from motor neuron terminals, also regulate the process of neuromuscular synapse formation (18Jo S.A. Zhu X. Marchionni M.A. Burden S.J. Nature. 1995; 373: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 19Goodearl A.D. Yee A.G. Sandrock Jr., A.W. Corfas G. Fischbach G.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1423-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Glial growth factor 2 (GGF2), one member of NRG family secreted from motor neuron terminals, has recently been shown to stimulate myoblast differentiation in immortalized cell lines (20Florini J.R. Samuel D.S. Ewton D.Z. Kirk C. Sklar R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12699-12702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The exogenous addition of GGF2 to the cultured myoblasts stimulates cell fusion and accumulation of creatine kinase. Based on these observations, Floriniet al. (20Florini J.R. Samuel D.S. Ewton D.Z. Kirk C. Sklar R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12699-12702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) suggested GGF2 as a candidate for myotrophic agents secreted by nerves. Here, we provide evidence for the existence of an NRG-ErbB3 autocrine signaling pathway in an early stage of myoblast differentiation. Disruption of the NRG-ErbB3 signaling by the antibodies raised against NRG and ErbB3 receptor markedly suppressed both myotube formation and muscle-specific gene expression in L6 cell line and rat primary myoblasts. The neutralizing antibodies appeared to influence mostly at the differentiation stage(s) after the expression of myogenin and cell cycle arrest. These results are consistent with a model that NRG plays a role as a local signal molecule that mediates the community effect observed in the differentiation of the embryonic muscle cells. The L6 rat myoblast cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cultures were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (proliferation medium (PM)) at 1.5 × 105 cells per 100-mm dish. The cell differentiation was induced by switching the medium to DMEM containing 5% horse serum (differentiation medium (DM)) at 3 days after plating. In the antibody inhibition experiments, the anti-ErbB3 antibody (Ab5) or the anti-NRG antibody (Ab2) was included in DM. To investigate the effects of NRGα1 or NRGβ1 on myogenesis, cells were cultured for 3 days in PM, washed with DMEM, and further cultured in DMEM containing 0.05% bovine serum albumin in the presence or absence of NRG. Ab5, Ab2, NRGα1, and NRGβ1 were purchased from NeoMarkers. Primary rat muscle cell cultures were prepared essentially as described (21Foster R.F. Thompson J.M. Kaufman S.J. Dev. Biol. 1987; 122: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Because the differentiation of primary rat muscle cells does not require the switching the culture medium to DM, Ab5 or Ab2 was directly added to the cultures at 4 h after plating for the antibody inhibition experiments. Fusion indices were measured as described previously (22Lee K.H. Kim D.G. Shin N.Y. Song W.K. Kwon H. Chung C.H. Kang M.S. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For immunocytochemistry, cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and incubated for 1 h with MF20, a monoclonal antibody specific to the skeletal myosin heavy chain (MHC). MHC was visualized using a horseradish peroxidase-linked system, which employs diaminebenzoate as a substrate (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector Laboratories Inc.). RNA from C2C12 myogenic cell line was subjected to RT-PCR using oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain of rat NRG (5′-TCTGGAGAGTATATGTGCAAAGTGATCAGC-3′, 3′-GCAGTAGGCCACCACACACATGATGCC-5′). A 480-base pair amplified fragment was subcloned into pGEM-T (Promega) and sequenced. Its sequence showed 90% identity with that of the rat neu differentiation factor cDNA. The 480-base pair fragment of NRG cDNA was subcloned into pGEX-4T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein containing the NRG sequence (amino acids 107–265) was produced in Escherichia coli and purified using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After separation in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the band corresponding to a molecular mass of 42 kDa was cut out, minced, and injected three times into albino rabbit at 4-week intervals. Upon immunoblot analysis, the resulting antiserum, but not the preimmune serum, was found to specifically interact with the 42-kDa glutathioneS-transferase-NRG fusion protein in the E. colilysates. The antiserum also recognized the extracellular domain of NRG α1 and β1 expressed in E. coli as a 30-kDa protein. Mouse monoclonal antibodies were used to detect ErbB2 (Ab-3; Oncogene), β-tubulin (T4026; Sigma), and myogenin (F5D; Pharmingen). p21 was detected with a mixed monoclonal antibody (05-345; Upstate Biotechnology). The antibodies against Rb (C-15) and p27 (C-19) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Creatine kinase (CK) was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody, prepared as described previously (23Baek H.J. Jeon Y.J. Kim H.S. Kang M.S. Chung C.H. Ha D.B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 178-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from L6 cells using the TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.) method at the proper time intervals. First-strand synthesis was done on 1 μg of RNA in a final volume of 20 μl using random primers and Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). One microliter of the sample was subjected to PCR using the primers corresponding to the EGF-like domain of rat NRG as above. The level of NRG RNA was measured by hybridizing with 32P-labeled internal oligonucleotide probes (5′-ACATCAACATCCACGACTGGGACCAGCCATCT-3′). To ensure that the assay was in the linear range, the cycle number and amounts of RNA were varied. Whole cell extracts were prepared with radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and precleared by centrifugation. The precleared lysates were incubated with 2 μg of an anti-ErbB3 antibody (C-17; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by addition of 50 μl of protein-A Sepharose beads (10% (v/v) suspension). After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer. Bound ErbB3 proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology). The ErbB3 proteins were then detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Recently, GGF2 has been suggested to act as a myotrophic agent secreted from nerve cells (20Florini J.R. Samuel D.S. Ewton D.Z. Kirk C. Sklar R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12699-12702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). If the differentiation of L6 myogenic cell is under the influence of NRG, L6 myoblasts should have receptors for NRG. To determine whether the functional ErbB3, the cognate receptor of NRG, is indeed expressed during the myogenesis of L6 cells, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using an antibody raised against ErbB3 (Fig.1 a). Consistent with the previous report (18Jo S.A. Zhu X. Marchionni M.A. Burden S.J. Nature. 1995; 373: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), the terminally differentiated myotubes expressed ErbB3. ErbB3 was expressed also in the undifferentiated myoblasts, although to a lower level than in myotubes. Moreover, the ErbB3 receptor in the myoblasts was tyrosine-phosphorylated upon treatment with NRGα1 or NRGβ1, indicating its functional responsiveness. Interestingly, we observed a low level of tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB3 in the control L6 cells that were not treated with NRGs (Fig.1 a). This observation led us to speculate that ErbB3 might be activated by endogenously expressed NRG. In fact, previous reports have shown the expression of NRGs in muscle cells. However, most attention has been focused on the action of these ligands in the neuromuscular junction, and their role at the early stage of myogenic differentiation has not been well documented (24Moscoso L.M. Chu G.C. Gautam M. Noakes P.G. Merlie J.P. Sanes J.R. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 158-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 25Burden S. Yarden Y. Neuron. 1997; 18: 847-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). We therefore examined in detail the expression pattern of NRGs in the course of L6 myogenesis. When the differentiation was induced by replacing the culture medium with a low mitogen-containing medium, the expression of NRG with a size of about 65 kDa was dramatically induced 1 day after the medium change (Fig. 1 b). It is striking that the expression of NRG maintained only for 1 day and rapidly declined thereafter. As shown in Fig. 1 c, the changes in the level of NRG mRNA closely correlated with the alterations in the NRG protein level. Thus, the expression of NRG is most likely to be under transcriptional control, although an increase in NRG mRNA stability may give rise to a similar result. These results demonstrate that NRG is transiently induced at the early stage of myogenesis, whereas ErbB3 receptor is constitutively expressed throughout the differentiation process. Because the anti-NRG antibody used in this immunoblotting analysis was raised against the EGF-like domain, a region common to most isoforms of NRG, it remains uncertain which isotype of NRG is expressed in the L6 myoblasts. In order to determine whether NRG may play a role as a local signaling molecule for myogenesis, L6 myoblasts were treated with the recombinant α1-NRG and β1-NRG isoforms, which contain EGF-like domain. Because NRG have been reported to show a modest mitogenic activity in the presence of serum components, the cells were treated with NRGs after the medium change with a serum-free medium (20Florini J.R. Samuel D.S. Ewton D.Z. Kirk C. Sklar R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12699-12702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 a, NRGα1 stimulated membrane fusion in a dose-dependent manner. This stimulatory effect could be seen at its concentrations as low as 0.1 nm (Fig. 2 a). At 0.5 nm, the onset of myoblast fusion in the NRGα1-treated cells was observed about 1 day earlier than that in the control cells (Fig. 2 c, lower panel). NRGα1 at the same concentration also stimulated the accumulation of muscle-specific proteins, such as MHC, as assessed by immunostaining (Fig. 2 b) and immunoblot analysis using an anti-MHC antibody (Fig. 2 c, upper panel). Similar results were obtained when the same experiments were performed with NRGβ1, although its effect was slightly less potent than that of NRGα1. These results indicate that NRG facilitates both the morphological and biochemical differentiation of L6 cells at its concentrations comparable to those used previously for determining its effect on proliferation and differentiation of other cells. For example, some cellular responses, such as proliferation and differentiation of mammary epithelial cells, are known to require 0.3 nm of NRG to be effective (26Peles E. Bacusm S.S. Koski R.A.

In addition, recombinant proteins containing only the EGF-like domain have been reported to stimulate the NRG receptors at subnanomolar concentrations in vitro (29Lu H.S. Chang D. Philo J.S. Zhang K. Narhi L.O. Liu N. Zhang M. Sun J. Wen J. Yanagihara D. Karunagaran D. Yarden Y. Ratzkin B. J. Biol.

Neuron. 1995; 15: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). If there is a NRG-ErbB3 autocrine signaling necessary for myogenesis, disruption of this signaling must suppress the differentiation process. To test this possibility, we took advantage of the availability of antibodies that neutralize the NRG-ErbB3 signal. As shown in Fig.3 a, the activation of ErbB3 receptor by exogenous NRGα1 was dramatically suppressed by treatment of the cells with 10 μg/ml of the anti-ErbB3 monoclonal antibody (Ab5) or the anti-NRG polyclonal antibody (Ab2). These results indicate that Ab5 and Ab2 were capable of neutralizing the NRG-ErbB3 signal pathway effectively. We then examined the effect of Ab5 and Ab2 on myogenesis. The differentiation of L6 cells was induced by changing the medium with DM at 3 days after plating, followed by immediate treatment with either Ab5 or Ab2. Both the formation of myotube and the expression of MHC were markedly inhibited by the antibodies, whereas the differentiation was not influenced by the treatment with normal mouse or rabbit immunoglobulin (Fig. 3, b–d). These results demonstrate the existence of an autocrine signaling pathway for NRG in L6 cells, which is necessary to initiate the process of muscle-specific gene expression and myotube formation. Moreover, the extent of inhibition appeared to be precisely correlated with the potency of neutralizing antibodies. An extensive exposure visualized a low level of tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB3, when Ab2, the ligand-blocking antibody, was incubated with NRGα1, whereas tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB3 was not detected with Ab5, the receptor-blocking antibody (Fig. 3 a). These results demonstrate that Ab5 is more potent than Ab2 in neutralizing the NRG-ErbB3 signal pathway. In parallel, Ab5 inhibited the expression of MHC and membrane fusion of L6 cells more effectively than Ab2 (Fig. 3,b and c). A low level of MHC was detected upon a prolonged exposure when the myogenesis of L6 cells was inhibited with Ab2 but not with Ab5 (Fig. 3 b). L6 cell is an established cell line, and it may not truly represent in vivo situation. In an attempt to investigate whether the autocrine signaling of NRG also works in the process of muscle differentiationin vivo, we used primary culture of rat myoblasts. Treatment of rat primary myoblasts with Ab5 (30 μg/ml) or Ab2 (50 μg/ml) caused a severe inhibition in expression of MHC and membrane fusion (Fig. 4). On the other hand, normal mouse or rabbit immunoglobulin failed to inhibit the differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes at the same concentrations. Compared with L6 cells, it is noticeable that rat primary myoblasts required higher concentrations of neutralizing antibodies for inhibition of the differentiation processes. Moreover, the inhibitory effect on primary culture was less prominent than that on L6 cell line. It may be explained by the observation that the primary cultures of rat myoblasts were significantly contaminated by fibroblasts (less than 30% of total cell number at the time of plating and more than 60% 2 days after plating), which are known to secrete NRGs (31Rosenbaum C. Karyala S. Marchionni M.A. Kim H.A. Krasnoselsky A.L. Happel B. Isaacs I. Brackenbury R. Ratner N. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 148: 604-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 32Velasco J.A. Feijoo E. Avila M.A. Notario V. Mol. Carcinog. 1998; 21: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Another explanation could be the heterogeneity in the population of rat primary myoblasts, a part of which might have already committed to differentiation program at the time of the preparation of the primary cultures. Nevertheless, the significant suppression of MHC expression and membrane fusion by the neutralizing antibodies supports our notion that the activation of autocrine signaling of NRG is required for muscle differentiationin vivo. The formation of skeletal muscle proceeds through sequential developmental events following commitment of mesodermal precursor cells, withdrawal from cell cycle, and terminal differentiation into multinucleated myotubes. The commitment to the differentiation pathway is characterized by the expression of myogenin (33Andres V. Walsh K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 34Halevy O. Novitch B.G. Spicer D.B. Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1018-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). Induction of p21 and dephosphorylation of Rb are closely related with the exit from cell cycle (35Guo K. Wang J. Andres V. Smith R.C. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3823-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 36Gu W. Schneider J.W. Condorelli G. Kaushal S. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Cell. 1993; 72: 309-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). The induction of myogenin and the exit from cell cycle are proposed to be prerequisite for terminal differentiation indicated by myotube formation and muscle-specific gene expression, such as MHC and CK. To examine whether the neutralizing antibodies selectively suppressed specific stage(s) of the myogenic differentiation, immunoblot analysis was performed using antibodies against myogenin, p21, Rb, MHC, and CK in the presence and absence of Ab5 or Ab2. Both Ab5 and Ab2 dramatically suppressed the expression of MHC and CK (Fig.5). These antibodies also suppressed the expression of myogenin and p21, but rather moderately. The phosphorylation of Rb reflects its activity in cell cycle. Rb in the absence of the neutralizing antibodies migrated as a single band of 100 kDa, indicating that most of Rb is hypophosphorylated when myoblasts exit from cell cycle (Fig. 5). In contrast, a part of Rb from Ab5- and Ab2-treated cells showed a retarded mobility, indicating that cell cycle was not completely arrested. These results demonstrate that the commitment to the differentiation pathway and the irreversible cell cycle arrest were partially blocked by the neutralizing antibodies. On the other hand, the neutralizing antibodies more effectively suppressed the terminal differentiation characterized by cell fusion and expression of MHC and CK. The expression of myogenin is induced by another myogenic factor, myf5, expressed at the early stage of myogenic differentiation. Myogenin also promotes its own gene expression by itself. Therefore, the partial blockage of myogenin expression by the neutralizing antibodies can be explained by a possibility that the NRG-ErbB3 signaling be involved in autoregulation of myogenin expression. Concurrently, the NRG-ErbB3 signaling appears to be also required for the ability of myogenin to induce the terminal differentiation as evidenced by the finding of complete inhibition of MHC expression and myotube formation by the neutralizing antibodies. The partial blockage of cell cycle arrest is also explained by this hypothesis because myogenin is partly responsible for the completion of cell cycle arrest (34Halevy O. Novitch B.G. Spicer D.B. Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1018-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar, 37Parker S.B. Eichele G. Zhang P. Rawls A. Sands A.T. Bradley A. Olson E.N. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1024-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). It is noticeable that the extents of suppression were closely correlated with the potencies of neutralizing antibodies. Ab5, the stronger neutralizing antibody, more effectively suppressed the hypophosphorylation of Rb and the induction of myogenin and p21. NRGs play a role as an inducing signal in various vertebrate development, such as trabeculae formation in heart, growth and differentiation of Schwann cells, morphogenesis of mammary gland, and formation of neuromuscular synapse (25Burden S. Yarden Y. Neuron. 1997; 18: 847-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 38Ben-Baruch N. Yarden Y. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.

These developmental processes are presumably mediated by local actions of NRGs in paracrine manner, in which NRG secreted from one group of cells induces the development of neighboring target cells. Here, we provide evidence for activation of an NRG autocrine signaling during the differentiation of embryonic muscle cells. We have shown that the expression of NRG was transiently but dramatically up-regulated after the cells were switched to the differentiation state. The receptors for NRG, ErbB2, and ErbB3 were also found to exist and be active in L6 myoblasts. Furthermore, a substantial inhibition of myogenesis by the antibodies that neutralize the NRG signal pathway is consistent with the model that locally synthesized NRGs may regulate the differentiation of embryonic muscle cells through an autocrine mechanism. NRG has been shown to act in an autocrine manner in other cases. Schwann cells express NRG mRNA, and the production of NRG is required for the proliferation of Schwann cell in response to transforming growth factor-β, basic fibroblast growth factor, or hepatocyte growth factor (31Rosenbaum C. Karyala S. Marchionni M.A. Kim H.A. Krasnoselsky A.L. Happel B. Isaacs I. Brackenbury R. Ratner N. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 148: 604-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Mature muscle cells also synthesize NRG and ErbBs, and both ligands and receptors are localized to synaptic site (24Moscoso L.M. Chu G.C. Gautam M. Noakes P.G. Merlie J.P. Sanes J.R. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 158-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Although NRG is also secreted from nerve terminals, NRG-ErbB signaling at the synapse may play a role, at least in part, as an autocrine mechanism (25Burden S. Yarden Y. Neuron. 1997; 18: 847-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The neutralizing antibodies against NRG and ErbB3 showed the differential effect on each event of myogenic progression. They partially suppressed the dephosphorylation of Rb and the expression of myogenin and p21 but completely inhibited myotube formation and MHC expression. These results indicate that NRG has a differentiation-promoting activity, although it is not absolutely required for the commitment of myoblasts to differentiate. More importantly, these results also indicate the existence of a checkpoint between the expression of myogenin and the terminal differentiation. InXenopus and mammal, muscle precursor cells of mid-gastrulae contain transcripts of muscle-specific transcription factors, and the level of these factors first becomes detectable at this stage (40Hopwood N.D. Pluck A. Gurdon J.B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3409-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 41Frank D. Harland R.M. Development. 1991; 113: 1387-1393PubMed Google Scholar, 42Ott M.O. Bober E.

But the expression of muscle-specific transcription factors has proven to be insufficient for autonomous differentiation of muscle precursor cells (41Frank D. Harland R.M. Development. 1991; 113: 1387-1393PubMed Google Scholar). Our study proposes that NRG, produced by the myoblasts at early stage of differentiation, may be required to proceed through a checkpoint presumably for the cells located after the expression of myogenin and the exit from cell cycle. When NRG reaches a threshold concentration in an autocrine manner, it may precisely coordinate the asynchronously committed myoblasts for the spatiotemporal progress of differentiation. It will be interesting to determine the nature of checkpoint controlled by NRGs."

Earlier studies showed that protons cause a conformational change that activates BNC1 and exposes residue 430 to the extracellular solution. Here we demonstrate that, in addition to blocking BNC1, amiloride also exposes residue 430. This result suggested that, like protons, amiloride might be capable of activating the channel. To test this hypothesis, we introduced a mutation in the BNC1 pore that reduces amiloride block, and found that amiloride stimulated these channels. Amiloride inhibition was voltage-dependent, suggesting block within the pore, whereas stimulation was not, suggesting binding to an extracellular site. These data show that amiloride can have two distinct effects on BNC1, and they suggest two different interaction sites. The results suggest that extracellular amiloride binding may have a stimulatory effect similar to that of protons in BNC1 or extracellular ligands in other DEG/ENaC channels.

A characteristic shared by DEG/ENaC cation channels is that extracellular amiloride inhibits their current. The ability of amiloride to inhibit the human epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) makes it clinically useful as a diuretic (1Fyfe G.K. Quinn A. Canessa C.M. Semin. Nephrol. 1998; 18: 138-151PubMed Google Scholar). Amiloride-sensitivity is also a valuable marker of currents generated by other DEG/ENaC channels from vertebrates, insects, mollusks, and nematodes (2Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. Curr. Opin.

Lin C. Berdiev B.K. Shlyonsky V.Gh. Patton H.K. Fuller C.M. Worrell R. Zuckerman J.B. Sun W. Eaton D.C. Benos D.J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol.

The relationship between amiloride block and channel activity is interesting. For example, the Drosophila Na+channel Ripped Pocket (RPK) generates a minimal Na+ current that is blocked by relatively high concentrations of amiloride (7Adams C.M. Anderson M.G. Motto D.G. Price M.P. Johnson W.A. Welsh M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, when RPK contains a “Deg” mutation that increases Na+ current 50-fold, current is blocked by 20 times lower concentrations of amiloride. In this study we further examined the relationship between amiloride and channel activity. The DEG/ENaC channel that we studied was BNC1 (also called MDEG and BNaC1), a proton-gated channel from human neurons that may be involved in synaptic transmission and the sensation of pain and sour taste (8Price M.P.

Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7879-7882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). However, lowering extracellular pH activates a large transient Na+ current (11Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Sakai H. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29778-29783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Like RPK, BNC1 is activated by a Deg mutation, which alters a critical glycine residue at position 430 (9Waldmann R. Champigny G. Voilley N. Lauritzen I. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10433-10436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Residue 430 is a site where analogous mutations in some Caenorhabditis elegans family members cause neurodegeneration (13Driscoll M. Chalfie M. Nature. 1991; 349: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In BNC1, mutation of Gly430 to valine or larger amino acids locks the channel in an activated state, even at neutral pH (9Waldmann R. Champigny G. Voilley N. Lauritzen I. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10433-10436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutation of Gly430 to cysteine (BNC1-G430C), generates only small constitutive currents (14Champigny G. Voilley N. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15418-15422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and confers a unique sensitivity to sulfhydryl-reactive methanethiosulfonate (MTS) 1The abbreviations used are: MTS, methanethiosulfonate; MTSEA, 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate bromide; MTSET, 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate bromide; MTSES, sodium 2-sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonate compounds (15Adams C.M. Snyder P.M. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30204-30207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The ability of MTS compounds to modify Cys430 is state-dependent. Under basal conditions at extracellular pH 7.4 with the channel closed, Cys430 is largely protected from extracellular MTS compounds. However when the channel is activated by protons, Cys430 becomes accessible to extracellular MTS compounds, which covalently modify Cys430 to make its side chain larger. As a result, the channel is irreversibly activated because it is unable to return to the inactive state. In the course of investigating the role of residue 430 in channel activation and in inhibition by amiloride, we made the surprising discovery that under certain conditions amiloride could activate current. Here we describe our investigation of the responsible mechanisms. BNC1 mutants were constructed by single-stranded mutagenesis of BNC1 (8Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7879-7882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) in pBluescript. The validity of constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Constructs were cloned into pMT3 (16Swick A.G. Janicot M. Cheneval-Kastelic T. McLenithan J.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1812-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) for expression. cDNA constructs were expressed in defolliculated albino Xenopus laevis oocytes (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI) by nuclear injection of plasmid DNA. cDNA encoding BNC1-G430C was injected at 5 ng/μl. cDNA encoding BNC1-G430V/G437C was injected at 40 ng/μl. For coexpression of the double mutant BNC1-G430V/G437C with BNC1-G430V, we injected 10 and 2 ng/μl, respectively. For coexpression of BNC1-G430V/G437C with wild-type BNC1, we injected 25 and 5 ng/μl, respectively. Following injection, oocytes were incubated at 18 °C in modified Barth's solution. Generally, cells were studied 12–24 h after injection; however, cells expressing BNC1-G430V/G437C (with or without wild-type BNC1) were studied 36–48 h after injection. Whole cell currents were measured using a two-electrode voltage clamp. During recording, oocytes were bathed in frog Ringer's solution (116 mm NaCl, 0.4 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mmHEPES, pH 7.4). MTS compounds were from Toronto Research Biochemicals (Toronto, Ontario) and included cationic reagents, 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSEA) and 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET), and an anionic reagent, sodium 2-sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSES). In earlier work (15Adams C.M. Snyder P.M. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30204-30207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) we showed that when Gly430 was mutated to cysteine, covalent modification of residue 430 by MTS reagents irreversibly locked BNC1-G430C in an activated state. Therefore we hypothesized that a noncovalent interaction between Zn2+and Cys430 might also activate the channel, but in a reversible way. Fig. 1 A shows that extracellular Zn2+ had no effect on current in oocytes expressing wild-type BNC1. However, at neutral extracellular pH, Zn2+ reversibly activated current in oocytes expressing BNC1-G430C (Fig. 1 B). The EC50 for activation of BNC1-G430C by Zn2+ was approximately 300 μm(Fig. 1 C). Previous studies (15Adams C.M. Snyder P.M. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30204-30207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) showed that pH-dependent activation of BNC1-G430C allowed MTS compounds to modify Cys430. Fig.1 D shows that activation by Zn2+ also allowed the MTS compound, MTSES, to modify Cys430 and irreversibly activate the channel. How might both Zn2+ and MTSES interact with Cys430? Because the BNC1 channel is a homomultimer composed of multiple BNC1 subunits (17Snyder P.M. Cheng C. Prince L.S. Rogers J.C. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), it is likely that within one channel there are multiple cysteines with which these agents may interact. Taken together, these data indicate that Zn2+binds to Cys430 to reversibly activate BNC1-G430C. Fig.2 A shows that 100 μm Zn2+ activated BNC1-G430C and that current was blocked by 1 mm amiloride. However, as shown in Fig. 2,B and C, Zn-activated currents were not smaller but larger if a submaximal concentration of amiloride (100 μm) was present. In the absence of Zn2+, amiloride either had no effect (Fig. 2 B) or blocked a small amount of current (Fig. 2 C), depending on the amount of basal current generated by BNC1-G430C. The combined effects of amiloride and Zn2+ concentrations are shown in Fig.2 D; at low concentrations, amiloride enhanced Zn2+ stimulation of current, and amiloride blocked at high concentrations. Enhanced stimulation in the presence of intermediate amiloride concentrations may also explain the transient current stimulation observed on washing out high concentrations of amiloride and Zn2+ (Fig. 2 A). These data show that amiloride alone does not stimulate current, but when both amiloride (intermediate concentrations) and Zn2+are present, current is greater than with Zn2+ alone. One interpretation of these results is that amiloride binds to the channel, and in so doing makes Cys430 more accessible for interaction with Zn2+. In this respect, amiloride might be similar to protons; a decrease in extracellular pH causes a conformational change that exposes Cys430 to the extracellular solution where it can be irreversibly modified by MTS reagents (15Adams C.M. Snyder P.M. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30204-30207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that amiloride causes a conformational change that exposes Cys430 to the extracellular solution. To test this hypothesis, we asked if amiloride would allow MTS reagents to irreversibly modify and activate the channel at pH 7.4. Fig.3 A shows that in the absence of amiloride, MTSEA had little or no effect at pH 7.4. Current remained low when amiloride and MTSEA were simultaneously present in the extracellular solution. However, once amiloride and MTSEA were removed, it was apparent that a large current had been activated; this current was blocked by subsequent treatment with amiloride. We obtained similar results with two other MTS reagents, MTSET and MTSES (Fig. 3,B and C). These results indicate that in the presence of amiloride, MTS reagents irreversibly modified Cys430, locking the channel open. Because the activated channel remained sensitive to amiloride block, current was only apparent after amiloride was removed from the extracellular solution. Extracellular amiloride and protons shared the ability to expose Cys430 to MTS compounds. However, an important difference between the two interventions was that protons activated current (15Adams C.M. Snyder P.M. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30204-30207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), whereas amiloride alone did not. We hypothesized that amiloride might have two effects; like protons, amiloride might bind to one site to stimulate current, but in addition, amiloride might bind to a second site to block the channel. Thus, any stimulatory effect would be obscured by the ability of amiloride to simultaneously block the channel. To test this hypothesis, we asked whether the inhibitory effect of amiloride could be selectively abolished by mutation. We tested a mutation equivalent to a mutation that reduces amiloride block of ENaC: substitution of cysteine for Gly437 (Fig.4 A). Residue 437 lies within the predicted pore-forming second membrane-spanning domain and is highly conserved among DEG/ENaC channels (9Waldmann R. Champigny G. Voilley N. Lauritzen I. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10433-10436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In ENaC subunits, mutations equivalent to G437C had several effects; if present in the β or γ subunits of the channel, the mutations reduced amiloride block and Na+ conductance. Also, the introduced cysteine could be modified by MTSET to inhibit current (17Snyder P.M. Cheng C. Prince L.S. Rogers J.C. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 18Schild L. Schneeberger E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). However, if present in all ENaC subunits, the mutations abolished channel activity (18Schild L. Schneeberger E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). To determine whether the G437C mutation reduced amiloride inhibition, we studied it in the context of BNC1-G430V, which generates large constitutive currents (9Waldmann R. Champigny G. Voilley N. Lauritzen I. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10433-10436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 15Adams C.M. Snyder P.M. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30204-30207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). BNC1-G430V generated large currents (904 ± 84 nA; n = 9) that were blocked by amiloride (Fig. 4 B). Expression of the double mutant BNC1-G430V/G437C failed to generate current; this was consistent with the observation that mutations abolish ENaC function if present in all subunits of that channel (18Schild L. Schneeberger E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Therefore, we coexpressed BNC1-G430V/G437C with a lesser amount of BNC1-G430V (5:1 ratio). This combination generated large constitutive currents (773 ± 63 nA;n = 10; Fig. 4 C) like BNC1-G430V. However in contrast to BNC1-G430V, 3 mm amiloride blocked only 38 ± 4% of the current (n = 6). MTSEA blocked a larger portion of the current (69 ± 3%; n = 6, Fig.4 C). MTSEA block was likely due to covalent modification of Cys437, because block was irreversible, and MTSEA did not block channels that lacked the G437C mutation (wild-type BNC1 or BNC1-G430V; not shown). These data indicate that when subunits containing the G437C mutation are included in a BNC1 channel complex, the sensitivity to block by amiloride is reduced. A hint of amiloride stimulation came from examining the response to increasing amiloride concentrations (Fig. 4 C, left part of trace). Amiloride produced a biphasic response, with inhibition at 100 μm, an increase in current at 1 mm, followed by inhibition at 3 mm. However, because the G430V Deg mutation was present in every subunit, a stimulatory effect of amiloride would be minimized. To test whether amiloride might stimulate BNC1-G430V/G437C, we coexpressed it with a small amount of wild-type BNC1 (5:1 ratio). This combination generated no current on its own; basal current (133 ± 13 nA; n = 10) was not different from that in uninjected cells (not shown). However, addition of amiloride stimulated current (Fig. 4 D). In contrast, amiloride did not stimulate wild-type BNC1 (Fig. 4 E). Simulation was reversible and evident only at concentrations greater than 100 μm. 3 mm amiloride increased current by 279 ± 40 nA (n = 10). This result, coupled with the ability of amiloride to increase access of residue 430, indicated that amiloride, like protons, could stimulate BNC1. Because amiloride had two effects (stimulation and inhibition), we hypothesized it might interact with two separate sites in BNC1. To test this idea, we determined the effect of voltage on inhibition and stimulation. Because amiloride is positively charged, effects should be voltage-dependent if the binding site lies within the membrane electrical field. To test inhibition, we studied BNC1-G430V. Block was steeply voltage-dependent, suggesting that amiloride blocked within the membrane electrical field (Fig. 5, A–D). Fig. 5, B and C, shows that block depended on the reversal potential of BNC1 current, suggesting that outward flow of cations prevented amiloride from reaching a blocking site. These results suggest that when amiloride blocks, it binds within the channel pore. To test stimulation, we studied oocytes expressing BNC1-G430V/G437C and wild-type BNC1 (5:1 ratio). Fig. 5, E and F,shows that stimulation was not appreciably voltage-dependent. This result suggested that amiloride stimulated the channel by binding a site outside the membrane electrical field, different from the site of amiloride block. Our data show that amiloride can have two distinct effects on the BNC1 channel and suggest that there may be two different sites of interaction. One site appears to lie within the channel pore; when amiloride interacts with this site it blocks the channel. Three pieces of evidence suggest that amiloride blocks within the channel pore: the voltage dependence suggested block within the membrane electrical field; alteration of the reversal potential and the outward flow of cations reduced block by extracellular amiloride; and block was attenuated by mutation of residue 437, which other data suggest lies within the second membrane-spanning helix (19Hong K. Driscoll M. Nature. 1994; 367: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 20Waldmann R. Champigny G. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11735-11737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The other site appears to be different from the blocking site; when amiloride interacts there it can cause a conformational change that activates the channel and exposes residue 430 to extracellular MTS reagents. Our data make no predictions about the location of the stimulatory site, except that it is not likely deep within the pore because the transmembrane electrical field has little effect on amiloride-dependent stimulation. We considered the possibility that amiloride-dependent stimulation might represent the interaction of amiloride at a single site producing open channel block. However, this mechanism does not explain stimulation because net current increased in the presence of amiloride, and amiloride stimulated current in channels that were largely insensitive to amiloride block. Moreover, membrane voltage had an effect on block, but not on stimulation. We also considered the possibility that amiloride might interact with a single binding site that might move during channel gating to give both voltage-dependent and -independent effects. This also seems unlikely, because the G437C mutation selectively attenuated block. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude an interaction at a single site that somehow both blocks and activates the channel; the multimeric nature of BNC1 might allow for such an effect. Our data suggesting that amiloride may interact with two sites may help explain earlier studies of other DEG/ENaC channels. Studies of ENaC suggest that amiloride might block the pore. First, amiloride block is voltage-dependent (4McNicholas C.M. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Second, amiloride is a more potent blocker in reduced extracellular Na+, suggesting that amiloride and Na+ may compete for a binding site in the channel pore (4McNicholas C.M. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Third, mutations that alter ion conduction or selectivity also alter amiloride block (4McNicholas C.M. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 18Schild L. Schneeberger E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen.

J. 1997; 72: 1622-1632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). On the other hand, studies of ENaC identified residues in the predicted extracellular domain that bind an amiloride anti-idiotypic antibody; mutation of those sites altered amiloride sensitivity (5Ismailov I.I. Kieber-Emmons T. Lin C. Berdiev B.K. Shlyonsky V.Gh. Patton H.K. Fuller C.M. Worrell R. Zuckerman J.B. Sun W. Eaton D.C. Benos D.J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21075-21083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, nonfunctional ENaC splice variants that lack the pore-forming second transmembrane domain but retain much of the extracellular domain retain binding to phenamil (an amiloride derivative) with high specificity (6Li X.-J. Xu R.-H. Guggino W.B. Snyder S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1133-1140PubMed Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with an extracellular amiloride-binding site on ENaC. The suggestion of two interaction sites in BNC1 raises the question of whether amiloride will have two effects on all DEG/ENaC family members. Alternatively, some family members may lack one or both sites and may not be inhibited by amiloride. The large extracellular domain may regulate the function of DEG/ENaC channels. In the FMRFamide-activated Na+ channel (FaNaCh), this region may form a ligand-binding site for channel activation (22Lingueglia E. Champigny G. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. Nature. 1995; 378: 730-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Consistent with this possibility, mutations in the predicted extracellular domain reduce sensitivity to FMRFamide. 2J. Rogers and M. J. Welsh, unpublished observations. In BNC1, ASIC, and DRASIC, this region may be responsible for proton activation (2Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). In C. elegans DEG/ENaC proteins, genetic studies suggest that this region may interact with extracellular collagen to affect channel gating (23Liu J. Schrank B. Waterston R.H. Science. 1996; 273: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 24Du H. Gu G. William C.M. Chalfie M. Neuron. 1996; 16: 183-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that there is also an amiloride-binding site in BNC1, perhaps located in the extracellular domain, that can modulate channel activity. Future studies that identify this site may help our understanding of the function of the extracellular domain and could possibly identify agents that activate or inhibit the channels for therapeutic purposes.

Activation of oxidase activity required the simultaneous presence of p47 phox, flavocytochrome b −245, and the anionic amphiphile. The activation of electron transfer reactions was much more rapid when iodonitrotetrazolium violet was used as electron acceptor than when oxygen alone was the acceptor. We propose that this difference represents an intermediate activation state of NADPH oxidase in which electron flow can proceed from NADPH to enzyme flavin (and hence to iodonitrotetrazolium violet) but not from flavin to heme (or not between the hemes).

NADPH oxidase is a multicomponent electron transport system mainly expressed in phagocytic cells of the immune system. Normally dormant, NADPH oxidase is activated after stimulation of these cells resulting in the vigorous production of superoxide (O⨪2) at the expense of NADPH (1Babior B.M. Kipnes R.S. Curnutte J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (2115) Google Scholar). The physiologic role of the enzyme is to contribute to microbial killing by the generation of reactive oxygen species derived from O⨪2 that are toxic to microorganisms. Genetic defects in components of NADPH oxidase lead to a severe predisposition to bacterial and fungal infections, a syndrome known as chronic granulomatous disease (2Roos D. Curnutte J.T. Ochs H. Puck J. Smith E. Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases, A Molecular and Genetic Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 318-340Google Scholar). The NADPH oxidase enzyme complex consists of a membrane-bound flavocytochrome, flavocytochromeb −245 that contains two molecules of heme and one molecule of FAD in a gp91 phox/p22 phox heterodimer (3Bellavite P.

A fourth cytosolic component, p40 phox, is also implicated in NADPH oxidase activity, but the role it plays is poorly understood at present (14Wientjes F.B. Hsuan J.J. Totty N.F. Segal A.W. Biochem.

Understanding of the mechanism and activation of NADPH oxidase has been greatly facilitated by the development of a cell-free system. In the simplest form, NADPH-dependent O⨪2 can be generated by mixing neutrophil membranes (containing flavocytochromeb −245) and neutrophil cytosol (containing p40 phox, p47 phox, p67 phox, and Rac2) with an anionic amphiphile and NADPH. In both whole cells and the cell-free system, there is a characteristic lag period before the oxidase activity appears after the addition of stimulus (to whole cells) or amphiphile (to the cell-free system). Previous work has shown that a decrease in the lag period can only be achieved by simultaneous incubation of neutrophil membranes and cytosol with the anionic amphiphile and not by preincubation of one or the other with anionic amphiphile (16Babior B.M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4232-4236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) reported that C-terminally truncated forms of p47 phox and p67 phox exhibit a diminished requirement for SDS, which would be consistent with p47 phox (or p67 phox) being a primary target for anionic amphiphiles.We have previously provided evidence that electron transfer in NADPH oxidase is regulated at several points. First, at the site where electrons enter the oxidase, because in the nonactivated enzyme, FAD does not become reduced in the presence of NADPH (21Cross A.R. Higson F.K. Jones O.T.G. Harper A.M.

Second, there is a kinetic barrier between the flavin center and the heme, because they are not in thermodynamic equilibrium during oxidase turnover (23Cross A.R. Parkinson J.F. Jones O.T.G. Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Finally, rapid electron transfer within the oxidase only occurs in the presence of oxygen, suggesting regulation at the level of heme (21Cross A.R. Higson F.K. Jones O.T.G. Harper A.M. Segal A.W.

To further understand the events that occur during oxidase activation, we have taken advantage of a cell-free system consisting of highly purified flavocytochromeb −245 and recombinant p47 phox, p67 phox, and Rac2 to perform experiments aimed at dissecting the target(s) of the anionic amphiphile during oxidase activation.DISCUSSIONThe principal action of both SDS and AA appears to be to promote an interaction between p47 phox and flavocytochromeb −245. This process requires the simultaneous presence of both flavocytochrome b −245 and p47 phox and results in almost complete elimination of the lag and subsequent high rates of oxidase activity. The secondary effect of SDS appears to be to promote interactions between Rac2 and flavocytochrome b −245 (or the flavocytochromeb −245·p47 phox complex), whereas the secondary effect of AA appears to promote interactions between p67 phox and flavocytochrome b −245.Taken together, the results presented above support a model in which association of the cytosolic factors with flavocytochromeb −245 initially results in an intermediate state of activation of NADPH oxidase by a relatively rapid process. In this intermediate state, electron transfer is facilitated from NADPH to the FAD center of the enzyme, where electrons can be diverted to INT. In the intermediate state, however, electron transfer does not proceed normally to the heme centers, and thus little O⨪2 is formed. The intermediate state of activation is converted to the fully active state in a rate-limiting process that is responsible for the lag.A model that describes the observed kinetics is shown in SchemeFS1. For simplicity, only the reactions involving flavocytochrome b −245 are shown. In this model, the anionic amphiphile (SDS or AA) causes a conformational change in p47 phox that causes it to associate with flavocytochrome b −245. It seems that this conformational change only occurs in a productive manner when flavocytochrome b −245 is also present in the incubation mixture, because preincubation of p47 phox with SDS or AA does not decrease the lag if flavocytochromeb −245 is not present. This complex is represented by p47*·cytb. The binding of p47 phox to flavocytochrome b −245 allows the high affinity binding of p67 phox and Rac2 as previously proposed by Lambeth and colleagues (35Uhlinger D.J. Taylor K.L. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22095-22098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in the intermediate state in which electron transfer can proceed from NADPH to INT. The formation of this intermediate state is relatively rapid, and consequently, little lag is evident in the onset of INT reductase activity. A subsequent slow step, possibly involving a conformational change in flavocytochromeb −245 (cytb → cytb* in Scheme FS1), results in the final fully active NADPH oxidase. The relative rapid formation of the intermediate complex relative to the fully activated form would explain why INT reductase activity dominates the initial phase of oxidase activity, whereas O⨪2 production predominates the latter phase (Fig. 6).It will clearly be of interest to study the factors that affect the formation of this intermediate state of oxidase activation and establish whether it is a reversible process. NADPH oxidase is a multicomponent electron transport system mainly expressed in phagocytic cells of the immune system. Normally dormant, NADPH oxidase is activated after stimulation of these cells resulting in the vigorous production of superoxide (O⨪2) at the expense of NADPH (1Babior B.M. Kipnes R.S. Curnutte J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (2115) Google Scholar). The physiologic role of the enzyme is to contribute to microbial killing by the generation of reactive oxygen species derived from O⨪2 that are toxic to microorganisms. Genetic defects in components of NADPH oxidase lead to a severe predisposition to bacterial and fungal infections, a syndrome known as chronic granulomatous disease (2Roos D. Curnutte J.T. Ochs H. Puck J. Smith E. Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases, A Molecular and Genetic Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 318-340Google Scholar). The NADPH oxidase enzyme complex consists of a membrane-bound flavocytochrome, flavocytochromeb −245 that contains two molecules of heme and one molecule of FAD in a gp91 phox/p22 phox heterodimer (3Bellavite P.

Cells expressing β1A with mutations of prolines or tyrosines in conserved cytoplasmic NPXY motifs had blunted migratory responses to mixtures of LPA and EGF or PDGF. The major effects on β1A-expressing cells of LPA when combined with EGF or PDGF were to sensitize cells so that maximal responses were obtained with >10-fold lower concentrations of growth factor and increase the chemokinetic component of migration. Sensitization by LPA was lost when cells were preincubated with pertussis toxin or C3 exotransferase. There was no evidence for transactivation or sensitization of receptors for EGF or PDGF by LPA. EGF or PDGF and LPA caused activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase by pertussis toxin-insensitive and -sensitive pathways respectively, but activation was not additive.

Migration in a concentration gradient (chemotaxis) is accomplished by dynamic coordination among receptors for chemotactic agents, cellular adhesion receptors, and the actin-containing cytoskeleton. At any one time, a given cell likely encounters a variety of chemotactic substances and adhesive substrates. The mechanisms by which these signals are integrated to form a coordinated migratory response are poorly understood. Integrins are transmembrane heterodimeric cell surface adhesion receptors composed of noncovalently associated α and β subunits. The fact that ligation of integrins by adhesive ligands can induce intracellular signaling events (“outside-in” signaling) and intracellular signaling pathways can control binding avidity of integrins for extracellular ligands (“inside-out” signaling) (7Hynes R.O.

Recently, a specific G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) for LPA, ventricular zone gene-1 (vzg-1) (26Hecht J.H. Weiner J.A. Post S.R. Chun J. J.

Edg-1, a homologous protein, is a receptor for sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), another lysophospholipid generated during platelet activation, and has a low affinity to LPA (28Lee M.J. Thangada S.

Three other Edg GPCRs have also been identified, Edg-3 and Edg-5 as receptors for S1P and Edg-4 as a receptor for LPA, (16Goetzl E.J. An S.

LPA and S1P stimulate several transduction cascades through GPCRs, including activation of the botulinum C3 exotransferase-sensitive small GTP-binding protein p21Rho(Rho) through Gα12/13 and the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway through pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi (15Moolenaar W.H.

FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Expression of a dominant-negative Ras mutant inhibited migration of NIH(M17) cells in response to LPA as well as to other chemoattractants such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (32Kundra V. Anand-Apte B. Feig L.A. Zetter B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The latter results suggest that Ras plays a key role in regulation of both LPA- and growth factor-induced cell migration. Growth factors such as PDGF and epidermal growth factor (EGF), acting via tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs), stimulate cell migration in concert with integrin-extracellular matrix interactions (33Anand-Apte B. Zetter B. Stem Cells. 1997; 15: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In NR6 fibroblasts expressing EGF receptor, EGF alters migration speed and directional persistence in a matrix-dependent manner (34Ware M.F. Wells A. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2423-2432PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse B82L-B3 fibroblasts expressing EGF receptor do not migrate in response to EGF alone but when co-presented with laminin or fibronectin, EGF mediates EGF receptor-mediated migration, suggesting an interaction between EGF receptor and integrins ligated by laminin or fibronectin (35Li J.

PDGF enhances migration of NIH 3T3 cells when plated on vitronectin, a ligand for αvβ3; other αv integrins but not β1 integrins associate with activated PDGF receptor (36Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H.

We recently expressed a series of β1A integrin subunits in GD25 mouse fibroblasts derived from β1-null stem cells and demonstrated that restoration of β1 integrin function is required for efficient migration of GD25 cells across matrix-coated filters in response to LPA, PDGF, or EGF (25Sakai T.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Because LPA, PDGF or EGF, and integrin ligands stimulate cells via three distinct but overlapping signaling systems as described above, we questioned whether engagement of two of the three systems is sufficient for maximum cell migration. In the present study, we demonstrate that LPA greatly increases the migratory activity of EGF or PDGF and that a functional β1A integrin is required for this enhancement. The GD25 fibroblast line, which was established after differentiation of β1-null stem cells and immortalization with SV40 large T antigen, and its derivatives transfected with β1A or β1As with mutations of the cytoplasmic domain were as described previously (39Sakai T.

PDGF from porcine platelets (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), recombinant human EGF (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), 1-oleoyl-LPA and S1P (Avanti Polar Lipids, Birmingham, AL, and LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA, respectively), and pertussis toxin (List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA) were purchased. Also purchased were rabbit polyclonal antibodies against active MAPK (Promega, Madison, WI), rabbit polyclonal antibodies that recognized mouse EGF or PDGF receptors (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb 4G10) against phosphotyrosine (Upstate Biotechnology). Recombinant C3 exotransferase was a generous gift from Dr. Tracee Panetti, University of Wisconsin (Madison, WI). Cell migration assays were performed in modified Boyden chambers containing Nucleopore polycarbonate membranes (5-μm pore size; Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) as described (25Sakai T. Peyruchaud O. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19378-19382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,39Sakai T. Zhang Q. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation of EGF or PDGF receptors, cells grown to 80–90% confluency were starved in medium without serum for 16 h, released from the substrate, reseeded onto plates coated with 100 μg/ml gelatin, incubated for 3 h in medium without serum, and then stimulated with agonists for 5 min or left unstimulated. For Western blotting of phosphorylated Erk1/2, cells were similarly seeded onto gelatin-coated plates, starved in serum-free medium for 3 h, and then stimulated with agonist for various time perioids. Cells were lysed on ice in buffer containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm sodium fluoride,1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mmsodium molybdate, 2 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.4 mm pefabloc SC, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The same amounts of protein from different experimental samples were used for analyses, as determined using a BCA protein assay (Pierce). The proteins were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Immunoprecipitation analysis was performed as described previously elsewhere (42Sakai T. Kawakatsu H. Furukawa Y. Saito M. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 63: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), with a slight modification. Briefly, the supernatants were precleaned with protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast-Flow (Pharmacia LKB Biotech, Sweden) and subsequently incubated with antibody. The complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast-Flow, and the proteins were eluted from the resins by incubation with SDS-sample buffer. Samples were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. For immunoblotting, the blots were probed with the primary antibody, then with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Organon Teknika Corp., Westchester, PA; Promega, Madison, WI). Immunoreactive bands were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) substrate system (NEN Life Science Products). Immunoprecipitation of EGF or PDGF receptors followed by immunoblotting for phosphotyrosine or β1 integrin was also carried out on cells lysed 60 min after plating on gelatin (100 μg/ml), vitronectin, fibronectin, or laminin-1 (10 μg/ml) coated substratum, or left in suspension. The effect of LPA in combination with EGF or PDGF on directed cell migration through gelatin-coated filters was analyzed with GD25 cells expressing wild type β1A (Fig.1). The cells did not migrate in response to EGF alone. PDGF alone stimulated modest migration at a concentration >1 ng/ml. 500 nm LPA alone stimulated robust migration. When EGF or PDGF were mixed together with LPA, cell migration was enhanced further by EGF or PDGF concentrations as low as 0.03 ng/ml (Fig. 1). The concentration of PDGF that supported maximal migration in the presence of both PDGF and LPA was 3 ng/ml as compared with >30 ng/ml in the absence of LPA. The requirement for β1A for migration of GD25 cells through gelatin-coated filters is more stringent when the chemoattractant is LPA than when the chemoattractant is PDGF (25Sakai T. Peyruchaud O. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19378-19382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The effects of β1A integrin on cell migration induced by LPA in combination with EGF or PDGF were therefore investigated. When EGF and LPA were mixed together, cell migration was 2–3-fold greater for cells expressing β1A than for cells lacking β1A (Fig. 2 A). When PDGF and LPA were mixed together, the number of migrating cells was 1.2–1.5-fold greater for cells expressing wild type β1A than for cells lacking β1A (Fig.2 B). S1P, a phospholipid that, like LPA, reacts with Edg receptors (28Lee M.J. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Thompson B.D. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22105-22112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 29Zondag G.C.M. Postma F.R. Van Etten I. Verlaan I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), is unlike LPA in that it inhibits cell migration (43Bornfeldt K.E. Graves L.M. Raines E.W. Igarashi Y. Wayman G. Yamamura S. Yatomi Y. Sidhu J.S. Krebs E.G. Hakomori S. Ross R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 193-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). S1P did not induce migration through gelatin-coated filters by either cell type and inhibited LPA-induced migration in cells expressing β1A (Fig. 2 C). These findings indicate that β1A-dependent migration in response to LPA is enhanced by EGF or PDGF and attenuated by S1P. β1A-dependent migration in response to LPA (25Sakai T. Peyruchaud O. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19378-19382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or PDGF or EGF (39Sakai T. Zhang Q. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) is lacking in GD25 cells expressing β1As with certain mutations in the cytoplasmic domain. These mutants fell into two groups, active (Y783F, Y795F, and Y783/795F) and inactive (T788P, P781A, P793A, and P781/793A), based upon the reactivity with anti-β1 (9EG7) antibody, α6β1-dependent adhesion to laminin-1, and ability to support fibronectin assembly (25Sakai T. Peyruchaud O. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19378-19382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). LPA and EGF stimulated the same minimal migration of GD25 cells lacking β1A and of GD25 cells expressing β1A with the T788P, P781/793A, Y783/795F, Y783F, or Y795F mutations (Fig.3). LPA and PDGF were less effective in causing migration of T788P, P781/793A, Y83/795F, Y783F, or Y795F cells than of GD25 cells lacking β1A (Fig. 3). When LPA and EGF or PDGF were tested together on cells expressing β1A with the activating D759A mutation, migration was similar to cells expressing wild type β1A (Fig. 3). We previously demonstrated that the magnitudes of the chemotactic response to EGF or PDGF of GD25 cells expressing wild type β1A were 2–3-fold greater than the chemokinetic response (39Sakai T. Zhang Q. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), as opposed to the 1.2–1.5-fold difference seen with LPA (25Sakai T. Peyruchaud O. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19378-19382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To learn if the enhancing effect of LPA on EGF- or PDGF-induced migration is due to increased chemotaxis or chemokinesis in cells expressing wild type β1A, we studied the effect of adding LPA with cells in the upper chamber or in both the upper and lower chambers (Fig.4). When LPA was present at equal concentrations in both chambers, the synergistic effect of LPA on EGF- or PDGF-induced migration was 90–95% of that observed when LPA and EGF or PDGF were present in just the lower chamber. When LPA was in the upper chamber and EGF or PDGF was in the lower chamber, more cells migrated toward the lower chamber than in the complete absence of LPA but less than when LPA alone was in the lower chamber. The same results were observed with filters coated with gelatin, vitronectin, or fibronectin (Fig. 4). These results indicate that LPA causes increased migration when mixed with EGF or PDGF mainly by a chemokinetic effect with some contribution of chemotaxis. Treatment of Rat-1 fibroblasts, HaCaT keratinocytes, or COS-7 cells with high concentration of LPA (10–25 μm) causes phosphorylation of EGF receptors (44Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar, 45Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). GD25 cells lacking β1A or expressing β1A expressed comparable amounts of EGF and PDGF receptors when analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting, and both receptors in both cells were activated appropriately by concentrations of 3 ng/ml EGF or PDGF but not by 500 nm LPA when analyzed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of immunoprecipitated receptors (25Sakai T. Peyruchaud O. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19378-19382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We tested a wider range of growth factor concentrations to learn whether LPA sensitizes EGF or PDGF receptors to activation by low concentrations of EGF or PDGF. The amount of EGF or PDGF receptor phosphorylation in cells expressing wild type β1A as assessed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of immunoprecipitated receptors was increased in response to EGF or PDGF in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5). When EGF or PDGF was mixed with 500 nm LPA together, there was no enhancement of EGF or PDGF receptor phosphorylation when compared with the stimulation by EGF or PDGF alone (Fig. 5). When 20 μm LPA alone was added, no tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF or PDGF receptors was demonstrated (not shown). These experiments, therefore, indicate that GD25 cells do not respond to LPA with transactivation of EGF receptors like Rat-1, HaCaT, or COS-7 cells. We also compared the phosphorylation states of EGF and PDGF receptors in β1GD25 cells adherent for 60 min to vitronectin, fibronectin, or laminin-1-coated surfaces. No phosphorylation was noted over and above the baseline phosphorylation present in suspended cells. In addition, no β1A was co-immunoprecipitated with EGF or PDGF receptors (not shown). LPA signaling is mediated through Ras and known to result in activation of MAPK (15Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. Postma F.R. Zondag G.C.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 16Goetzl E.J. An S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). We therefore studied whether cell migration in response to LPA and EGF or PDGF is associated with the hyperactivation of MAPK in GD25 cells wild type β1A. To replicate conditions of the cell migration assay, cells were incubated for 3 h without serum on a gelatin-coated substratum and then stimulated with agonists for various time periods. Doubly phosphorylated Erk1 and Erk2, which represent the activated forms of these proteins, were analyzed using anti-active MAPK antibodies. Basal activation of Erk1/2 was minimal (Fig. 6). In response to the stimulation of LPA, EGF, or PDGF alone, activation of Erk1/2 was increased in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6). When LPA and EGF or PDGF were added together, only modest additive effects of Erk1/2 activation were demonstrated when compared with LPA, EGF, or PDGF alone (Fig. 6). This finding was true after both 5 and 30 min of stimulation. Treatment of GD25 cells expressing β1A with pertussis toxin, which modifies Giand blocks stimulation of Ras induced by LPA (20van Corven E.J. Groenink A. Jalink K. Eichholtz T. Moolenaar W.H. Cell. 1989; 59: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar), caused nearly complete loss of migration through gelatin-coated filters in response to LPA alone at a toxin dose of 3 ng/ml (Fig.7 A). The 50% inhibitory dose of pertussis toxin, determined in a separate experiment, was 0.01–0.03 ng/ml (not shown). When LPA and EGF or PDGF were added together to cells treated with pertussis toxin, enhancement by LPA of growth factor-induced migration was completely lost at 3 ng/ml toxin, such that the number of migrated cells were the same as in response to PDGF or EGF alone (Fig. 7 A). Treatment of pertussis toxin caused down-regulation of Erk1/2 activation in response to LPA but did not significantly affect Erk1/2 activation in response to EGF or PDGF alone or to a combination of LPA and EGF or PDGF (Fig.8).Figure 8Effect of pertussis toxin on LPA- and/or EGF- or PDGF-induced phosphorylation of Erk1/2 in GD25 cells expressing wild type β1A. Cells were pretreated overnight with pertussis toxin at concentrations of 0, 3, 10, 30, and 100 ng/ml, seeded onto plates coated with 100 μg/ml gelatin, starved in medium without serum for 3 h, and then stimulated with agonists (LPA (500 nm) and/or EGF or PDGF (3 ng/ml)) for 5 min or left unstimulated (−). Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-active MAPK polyclonal antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) LPA signaling through Gα12/13 causes direct activation of Rho (46Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3735) Google Scholar). Migration of cells expressing wild type β1A in response to LPA alone or PDGF alone was decreased by the treatment of cells with C3 exotransferase, which inactivates Rho in a concentration-dependent manner up to exotransferase doses of 100 μg/ml (Fig. 7 B). When LPA and EGF or PDGF were added together to cells treated with C3 exotransferase, the enhanced effect of EGF or PDGF on LPA-induced migration was lost at an exotransferase dose as low as 10 μg/ml (Fig. 7 B). The treatment of C3 exotransferase did not block LPA-stimulated Erk1/2 activation at any of the toxin concentrations tested (not shown). β1A with an intact cytoplasmic tail, including intact NPXY motifs, is important for chemotaxis of GD25 fibroblasts in response to EGF or PDGF (39Sakai T. Zhang Q. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The requirement for β1A is more stringent when the chemotactic agent is LPA than when the chemotactic agent is EGF or PDGF (25Sakai T. Peyruchaud O. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19378-19382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe a tripartite interaction among ligated β1A integrins, LPA GPCRs, and EGF or PDGF RTKs. Although signaling induced by two of the three receptor systems supports chemotaxis, engagement of all three receptor systems leads to greater migration. The major effects of LPA when combined with EGF or PDGF were to sensitize cells so that maximal responses were obtained with >10-fold lower concentrations of growth factor and to increase the chemokinetic component of migration. The synergism between LPA and EGF or PDGF was lost when cells were preincubated with pertussis toxin or C3 exotransferase. S1P mimics some of the effects of LPA (47Wu J. Spiegel S. Sturgill T.W. J.

Spiegel S. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and both lipids signal via Edg receptors. GD25 cells lacking β1A and expressing wild type β1A have been shown to express edg-2 and edg-1 receptors by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (25Sakai T. Peyruchaud O. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19378-19382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In contrast to the effect of LPA, neither cell type was induced to migrate by S1P. S1P inhibits invasion and motility of melanoma cells and PDGF-induced chemotaxis of human smooth muscle cells, whereas LPA induces invasion of rat hepatoma cells and migration of NIH 3T3 or human skin fibroblasts (22Imamura F.

Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch Pharmacol. 1997; 355: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Similarily S1P inhibited LPA-induced migration of β1A-GD25 cells. Presumably, the two bioactive lipids activate a different balance of signaling pathways, thus leading to different effects on cellular motility. The results indicate that the β1A integrin must not only be active but have intact NPXY motifs in the cytoplasmic domain. The latter requirement differentiates the LPA effect on migration from its effect on fibronectin matrix assembly, which is up-regulated by LPA in GD25 cells expressing β1A with conservative Tyr to Phe substitutions (39Sakai T. Zhang Q. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). An unexpected finding of the present experiments was the deleterious effect of mutations of the NPXY motifs on migration due to LPA and PDGF when compared with migration of cells lacking β1A completely. This result suggests that the mutant β1A tails depress migration mediated by other cell surface receptors. Recent evidence suggests at least three mechanisms of “cross-talk” among signaling pathways. First, there is evidence of cross-talk between GPCRs and RTKs. LPA and other GPCR agonists can induce activation of EGF or PDGF receptors in the absence of EGF or PDGF with subsequent activation of the Ras-MAPK cascade (44Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar, 45Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A.

S. A. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8985-8990Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Gα13-mediated Rho activation induced by LPA has also been suggested to stimulate EGF RTK activity in Swiss 3T3 cells (56Gohla A. Harhammer R. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4653-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Second, there is evidence of cross-talk between RTKs and β1 integrins. Stimulation of β1 integrin on human AG1518 fibroblasts by interaction with extracellular matrix induces ligand-independent tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGF receptors, but not of EGF receptors (38Sundberg C. Rubin K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 741-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Similarly, adhesion of human skin fibroblasts, endothelial cells to matrix proteins, or antibody to β1 integrin stimulates ligand-independent tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptors in the absence of receptor ligands and association of β1 integrins with EGF receptors (57Moro L. Venturino M. Bozzo C. Silengo L. Altruda F. Beguinot L. Tarone G. Defilippi P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6622-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Evidence of cross-talk between GPCRs and EGF or PDGF receptors appears to be cell type-specific and dependent, e.g. on the presence or absence of cell surface EGF or PDGF receptors (55Herrlich A. Daub H. Knebel A. Herrlich P. Ullrich A. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8985-8990Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We found no LPA-induced phosphorylation of EGF and PDGF receptors in GD25 cells despite good expression of both receptors and thus have no evidence for transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases through GPCRs in these cells. Further, we found no evidence for adhesion-dependent phosphorylation of EGF or PDGF receptors. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that LPA treatment or β1-dependent adhesion caused activation of an undetectably small but still functionally significant subpopulation of receptors. A third type of cross-talk is between GPCRs and adhesion receptors. Activation of Rho by LPA stimulation results in reorganization of actin stress fibers, recruitment or phosphorylation of different focal contact proteins including integrins, and formation of focal contacts (58Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3832) Google Scholar). PDGF or EGF initially activate Rac, which stimulates membrane ruffling, and also leads to Rho-dependent responses (59Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar). Stimulation of multiple coordinated pathways of actin remodeling and coupling of remodeled actin to cell surface complexes would explain the increased migration that we observed. Pretreatment of GD25 cells expressing wild type β1A with pertussis toxin ablated both LPA-stimulated Erk1/2 activation and LPA-induced cell migration, whereas C3 exotransferase pretreatment partially inhibited LPA-induced cell migration but did not influence MAPK activation. These results indicate that MAPK activation by LPA in GD25 cells is a Gi-Ras-Raf-mediated pathway, but that the Gi-Ras-Raf pathway alone is not sufficient for cell migration induced by LPA. Importantly, LPA did not sensitize cells pretreated with pertussis toxin or C3 exotransferase to growth factors. This finding suggests the potential participation of Rho in pathways leading to Ras and Erk activation (60Renshaw M.W. Toskoz D. Schwartz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21691-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thus, both Gi-Ras-Raf and Gα12/13-Rho mediated pathways seem critical for the sensitization induced by LPA. The phenomenon described herein may be of considerable importance for the migration of one group of cells in response to a growth factor diffusing from a second distant group of cells. The sensitivity and specificity of such communication would be enhanced considerably if the first group of cells was sensitized to the product of the second group.

(1997)Oncogene 14, 1463–1470), are shown to exhibit (i) increased levels of the pro-apoptotic lipid metabolite ceramide and (ii) high activity of caspases, the proteases of the cell death cascade. In the p75NTR-expressing cells, these parameters were partially normalized by prolonged NGF treatment, which, in addition, decreased apoptosis, similar to caspase blockers. Conversely, exogenous ceramide increased caspase activity and apoptosis in both wild-type and p75NTR-expressing cells. A new p75NTR-expressing clone characterized by low spontaneous apoptosis exhibited high endogenous ceramide and low caspase levels. A marked difference between the apoptotic and resistant clones concerned the very low and high activities of nitric-oxide (NO) synthase, respectively. Protection from apoptosis by NO was confirmed by results with the NO donor S-nitrosoacetylpenicillamine and the NO-trapping agent hemoglobin. We conclude that the p75NTR receptor, while free of NGF, triggers a cascade leading to apoptosis; the cascade includes generation of ceramide and increased caspase activity; and the protective role of NO occurs at step(s) in between the latter events.

Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is now recognized to play fundamental roles in both the physiology and pathology of the brain. On the one hand, apoptosis is instrumental in the selection of neurons, working coordinately with neuroprotection (1Raff M.C. Barres B.A. Burne J.F. Coles H.S. Ishizaki Y. Jacobson M.D. Science. 1993; 262: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar, 2Henderson Z. Prog. Neurobiol. (Oxf.). 1996; 48: 219-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); on the other hand, it plays central roles in the development of specific diseases (3Stefanis L. Burke R.E. Greene L.A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 10: 299-305Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Understanding of factors and mechanisms governing the apoptotic program of nerve cells represents therefore a key issue in modern biomedical sciences.Among the neuronal pro-apoptotic factors, considerable attention is presently focused on NGF 1The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; NTR, neurotrophin receptor; NO, nitric oxide; AMC, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; CMK, chloromethyl ketone; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone; Z-, benzyloxycarbonyl-; SNAP, S-nitrosoacetylpenicillamine; l-NAME, l-N ω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter1The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; NTR, neurotrophin receptor; NO, nitric oxide; AMC, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; CMK, chloromethyl ketone; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone; Z-, benzyloxycarbonyl-; SNAP, S-nitrosoacetylpenicillamine; l-NAME, l-N ω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter and its receptors. In classical studies, this neurotrophin has been shown to afford protection to various families of neurons, working through its high affinity receptor, TrkA. As far as the low affinity NGF receptor, p75NTR, initial studies suggested its role to be cooperative to TrkA (see, for example, Refs. 4Heumann R. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 668-679Google Scholar and 5Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 321-326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Recently, however, homologies have been noticed between the transduction domain of p75NTR and those of well known death receptors,i.e. the tumor necrosis factor-α receptor and CD95 (Fas, APO-1) (see Ref. 6Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 579-587Google Scholar). The latter are known to induce apoptosis via complex signal cascades including the generation of a lipid messenger, ceramide, and the proteolytic activation of cysteine proteases, the caspases (7Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar, 8Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). At the moment, a pro-apoptotic role of p75NTR is supported by results in a variety of systems, including cultured cells as well as knockout and transgenic mice (9Bredesen D.E. Rabizadeh S. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 287-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 10Majdan M. Lachance C. Gloster A. Aloyz R. Zeindler C. Bamji S. Bhakar A. Belliveau D.

Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 343-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Compared with the other death receptors, p75NTR appears unique inasmuch as only in some cases, apoptosis was shown to develop following NGF binding, whereas in other cases, it occurred in the absence of the specific ligand (spontaneous apoptosis). The signaling events triggered in the first condition are beginning to be elucidated (11Miller F.D. Kaplan D.R. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 343-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 12Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Chao M.V.

Whatever their nature, these events appear to operate within the cell under the control of various modulators, among which is the short-lived messenger NO (15Nicotera P. Brune B. Bagetta G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 189-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on results in a number of cell types, from macrophages to neurons, NO was initially suggested to work as a stimulator of apoptosis, whereas recently, it has been shown to play a protective role (16Sciorati C. Rovere P. Ferrarini M. Heltai S. Manfredi A.A. Clementi E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23211-23215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 17Hebestreit H. Dibbert B.

Mariotti A. Compagni A. Morandi E. Della Valle G. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1463-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The results demonstrate (i) that both ceramide and caspases play crucial roles in the death signaling cascade induced by p75NTR and (ii) that NO protects against the apoptotic program, working downstream of ceramide generation and upstream of the operative caspase cascade.DISCUSSIONInterest about p75NTR has been greatly stimulated by the conflicting results reported about its function. In cells in which its expression occurs together with that of the other NGF receptor, the tyrosine kinase TrkA, p75NTR has been shown to contribute to the trophic effects induced by ligand binding, playing either a tuning (4Heumann R. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 668-679Google Scholar, 5Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 321-326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar, 28Verdi J.M. Birren S.J. Ibanez C.F.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6031-6037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) role. Recently, however, p75NTR has been recognized as a death receptor, belonging to the same molecular family as the tumor necrosis factor-α receptor and CD95, and ample evidence of p75NTR-induced apoptosis has been reported (10Majdan M. Lachance C. Gloster A. Aloyz R. Zeindler C. Bamji S. Bhakar A. Belliveau D. Fawcett J. Miller F.D. Barker P.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6988-6998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Miller F.D. Kaplan D.R. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 343-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Whether the latter effect is induced by the receptor when free or after binding of one of its ligands, such as NGF, remains debated. In two studies in which the binding mode was reported (in oligodendrocytes (Ref. 12Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Chao M.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar; however, see also Ref. 31Ladiwala U. Lachance C. Simoneau S.J.J. Bhakar A. Barker P.A. Antel J.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1297-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in chick retina neurons (Ref. 13Frade J.M. Rodriguez-Tébar A. Barde Y.-A. Nature. 1996; 383: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar)), the pro-apoptotic activation of p75NTR was shown to trigger the generation of ceramide. This finding is of importance because the lipid derivative, no matter whether generated endogenously or administered exogenously, is known to play a key role in the induction of apoptosis (32Wiegmann K. Schutze S. Macleidt T. Witte D. Kronke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 33Cifone M. Roncaioli P. De Maria R. Camarda G. Santoni A. Ruberti G. Testi R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5859-5868Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). On the other hand, spontaneous apoptosis taking place in p75NTR-expressing cells in the absence of NGF was demonstrated in immortalized neural cells and sensory neurons (34Rabizadeh S. Oh J. Zhong L. Yang J. Bitler C.M. Butcher L.L. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1993; 261: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 35Barrett G.L. Bartlett P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6501-6505Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) as well as in the overexpressing SK-N-BE clones employed in this study (20Bunone G. Mariotti A. Compagni A. Morandi E. Della Valle G. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1463-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The intracellular signaling events operative in these various cases were not investigated.To reconcile these results, a detailed understanding of the p75NTR transduction system would be needed. Activation of other death receptors, such as the tumor necrosis factor-α receptor, is known to trigger not a single, but a number of intracellular cascades, only some of which lead to apoptosis, whereas others ultimately induce cell protection and/or proliferation (32Wiegmann K. Schutze S. Macleidt T. Witte D. Kronke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 36Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin A.S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 18117-18121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The equilibrium among these various pathways appears to be regulated in a cell type-specific fashion. A task of this work was to elucidate the mechanisms by which p75NTR triggers and regulates its spontaneous apoptotic response in SK-N-BE cells. The results we have obtained emphasize the role of both ceramide and caspases. The high levels of endogenous ceramide observed in the p75NTR-overexpressing cells were shown to decline, although slowly (24–48 h), after administration of NGF, in parallel with the strong decrease in the probability of apoptosis (20Bunone G. Mariotti A. Compagni A. Morandi E. Della Valle G. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1463-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The possibility that high ceramide levels increase the probability of cells to enter the apoptotic program is confirmed also by their higher sensitivity to the exogenous lipid metabolite. Our ceramide results with NGF are just the opposite of what was reported for oligodendrocytes (12Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Chao M.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar), suggesting that the p75NTR transmembrane signaling can vary, depending on the cell type, and thus explaining the apparently contradictory results of the literature. In the case of caspases, the enzymes known to play key operative roles in the cell death program, our present evidence strongly suggests their involvement in the p75NTR signaling (7Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar, 8Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). In the p75NTR-overexpressing B and H clones, the caspase activity was found to be very high already under resting conditions. Exposure to exogenous ceramide induced increases not only in the overexpressing cells, but also in the wild-type cells, correlating with the development of apoptosis. Along the same line, a negative correlation was found between apoptosis and the effects of caspase inhibitors.New and profoundly different results were obtained with clone AR, the p75NTR-overexpressing SK-N-BE clone that diverges from the others because of its resistance to apoptosis. Resting clone AR cells are characterized by high ceramide levels and by caspase expression levels comparable to those of the other clones. The signaling difference of clone AR emerged when its low caspase activity failed to rise and its cells failed to enter apoptosis when exposed to exogenous ceramide. Apparently, therefore, the resistance of clone AR is due to a transduction blockade localized between p75NTR signaling and ceramide generation on the one hand and caspase activation on the other. Such a blockade appears specific for the receptor-initiated pathway since, when other inducing treatments were employed, no difference in apoptosis development was observed between clone AR and the other clones. Of the cell properties that could be possibly responsible for clone AR resistance, some (expression of Trk receptors and increased levels of Bcl-2) could be excluded. A difference detected in clone AR with respect to the other overexpressing clones and also the wild-type SK-N-BE cells was, in contrast, its high NO synthase activity. Thus, NO could have a part in the lack of caspase activation and apoptosis in clone AR cells; whether other, so far unidentified protective factor(s) are also involved remains to be established.In previous studies, the conclusions about the role of NO in nerve cell apoptosis had been conflicting. In many cases, the messenger was reported to induce (38Zhang J. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 213-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 39Yun H.Y. Dawson V.L.

Lett. 1997; 236: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) programmed cell death. In our work, the protective role of NO was documented by (i) the inverse correlation between NO synthase activity and apoptosis (both spontaneous and induced by ceramide) and (ii) the effects of an NO donor (SNAP) that was able to prevent the ceramide activation of caspases and induced marked decreases in programmed death rates in both the wild-type cells and p75NTR-overexpressing B and H clones. The latter effects were specific because they disappeared when the cells were incubated in the presence of the NO scavenger hemoglobin. Thus, endogenous NO appears to be among the controllers modulating the efficacy of the p75NTR-triggered death signal. This finding is of importance for at least two reasons. (i) It shows that the protective role of endogenously generated NO against receptor-triggered apoptosis is not confined to individual receptors and cell types (CD95 in T lymphocytes (16Sciorati C.

Med. 1997; 4: 601-607Crossref Scopus (783) Google Scholar)), but extends to p75NTR in a nerve cell; and (ii) it provides clues about the role of NO in the development and plasticity of the nervous system (see, for example, Ref. 37Hehner S.P.

Evidence for the involvement of the gaseous messenger in such processes was already available for the visual (43Williams C.V. Nordquist D. McLoon S.C. J.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 289-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) systems as well as for peripheral sensory neurons (35Barrett G.L. Bartlett P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1992; 69: 737-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar); however, the mechanisms involved remained unclear. Based on the present results, it is conceivable that at least part of the NO effects, in the above and possibly also in other parts of the nervous system, are established via its involvement in the regulation of death signaling programs, such as that activated by p75NTR.In conclusion, the panel of stably transfected SK-N-BE neuroblastoma clones lacking Trk have shown to be interesting models for the study of the signaling and physiological role of the p75NTRreceptor. The higher efficacy of the latter in inducing apoptosis in the absence rather than in the presence of its ligand might account for the neurotrophic role attributed in previous studies (30Maliartchouk S. Saragovi H.U. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6031-6037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to the NGF activation of p75NTR working synergistically with TrkA. In other cell types, however, classical apoptotic responses have been triggered following ligand activation of p75NTR (12Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Chao M.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 13Frade J.M. Rodriguez-Tébar A. Barde Y.-A. Nature. 1996; 383: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), as expected for a bona fide death receptor. These apparently conflicting results call attention to the mechanisms that regulate intracellularly the development of the apoptotic program. In this study on p75NTR-expressing SK-N-BE clones, the event that seems to play a major role is the generation of NO. In fact, high levels of the gaseous messenger inhibit the activation of caspases by a mechanism that appears to be cGMP-independent. Therefore, in the case of p75NTR-induced apoptosis, at least two levels of control appear to be functioning: at the receptor, with its alternative free/bound signaling; and within the cytoplasm, where multiple signals, including those triggered by NO, appear to participate in the regulation of the life-or-death decision (11Miller F.D. Kaplan D.R. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 343-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is now recognized to play fundamental roles in both the physiology and pathology of the brain. On the one hand, apoptosis is instrumental in the selection of neurons, working coordinately with neuroprotection (1Raff M.C. Barres B.A. Burne J.F. Coles H.S. Ishizaki Y. Jacobson M.D. Science. 1993; 262: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar, 2Henderson Z. Prog. Neurobiol. (Oxf.). 1996; 48: 219-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); on the other hand, it plays central roles in the development of specific diseases (3Stefanis L. Burke R.E. Greene L.A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 10: 299-305Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Understanding of factors and mechanisms governing the apoptotic program of nerve cells represents therefore a key issue in modern biomedical sciences. Among the neuronal pro-apoptotic factors, considerable attention is presently focused on NGF 1The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; NTR, neurotrophin receptor; NO, nitric oxide; AMC, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; CMK, chloromethyl ketone; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone; Z-, benzyloxycarbonyl-; SNAP, S-nitrosoacetylpenicillamine; l-NAME, l-N ω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter1The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; NTR, neurotrophin receptor; NO, nitric oxide; AMC, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; CMK, chloromethyl ketone; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone; Z-, benzyloxycarbonyl-; SNAP, S-nitrosoacetylpenicillamine; l-NAME, l-N ω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter and its receptors. In classical studies, this neurotrophin has been shown to afford protection to various families of neurons, working through its high affinity receptor, TrkA. As far as the low affinity NGF receptor, p75NTR, initial studies suggested its role to be cooperative to TrkA (see, for example, Refs. 4Heumann R. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 668-679Google Scholar and 5Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 321-326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Recently, however, homologies have been noticed between the transduction domain of p75NTR and those of well known death receptors,i.e. the tumor necrosis factor-α receptor and CD95 (Fas, APO-1) (see Ref. 6Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 579-587Google Scholar). The latter are known to induce apoptosis via complex signal cascades including the generation of a lipid messenger, ceramide, and the proteolytic activation of cysteine proteases, the caspases (7Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar, 8Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). At the moment, a pro-apoptotic role of p75NTR is supported by results in a variety of systems, including cultured cells as well as knockout and transgenic mice (9Bredesen D.E. Rabizadeh S. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 287-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 10Majdan M. Lachance C. Gloster A. Aloyz R. Zeindler C. Bamji S. Bhakar A. Belliveau D.

Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 343-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Compared with the other death receptors, p75NTR appears unique inasmuch as only in some cases, apoptosis was shown to develop following NGF binding, whereas in other cases, it occurred in the absence of the specific ligand (spontaneous apoptosis). The signaling events triggered in the first condition are beginning to be elucidated (11Miller F.D. Kaplan D.R. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 343-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 12Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Chao M.V.

Whatever their nature, these events appear to operate within the cell under the control of various modulators, among which is the short-lived messenger NO (15Nicotera P. Brune B. Bagetta G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 189-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on results in a number of cell types, from macrophages to neurons, NO was initially suggested to work as a stimulator of apoptosis, whereas recently, it has been shown to play a protective role (16Sciorati C. Rovere P. Ferrarini M. Heltai S. Manfredi A.A. Clementi E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23211-23215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 17Hebestreit H. Dibbert B.

Med. 1997; 4: 601-607Crossref Scopus (783) Google Scholar). In this work, the signaling events responsible for p75NTR-induced apoptosis and their regulation by NO were investigated in a panel of transfected SK-N-BE human neuroblastoma clones, some of which had already been shown to undergo spontaneous apoptosis (20Bunone G. Mariotti A. Compagni A. Morandi E. Della Valle G. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1463-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The results demonstrate (i) that both ceramide and caspases play crucial roles in the death signaling cascade induced by p75NTR and (ii) that NO protects against the apoptotic program, working downstream of ceramide generation and upstream of the operative caspase cascade. DISCUSSIONInterest about p75NTR has been greatly stimulated by the conflicting results reported about its function. In cells in which its expression occurs together with that of the other NGF receptor, the tyrosine kinase TrkA, p75NTR has been shown to contribute to the trophic effects induced by ligand binding, playing either a tuning (4Heumann R.

Recently, however, p75NTR has been recognized as a death receptor, belonging to the same molecular family as the tumor necrosis factor-α receptor and CD95, and ample evidence of p75NTR-induced apoptosis has been reported (10Majdan M. Lachance C. Gloster A. Aloyz R. Zeindler C. Bamji S. Bhakar A. Belliveau D. Fawcett J. Miller F.D. Barker P.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6988-6998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Miller F.D.

Escherichia coli RecF is a multifunctional protein, with identified roles in recombinational DNA repair, homologous genetic recombination, and DNA replication. The phenotypes of recF mutants include decreased plasmid recombination (1Cohen A. Laban A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1983; 189: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 2Kolodner R. Fishel R.A.

A role for RecF protein in replication was suggested by the requirement for recF (and recR) in the resumption of replication after the collapse of DNA replication forks (8Courcelle J. Carswell-Crumpton C. Hanawalt P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Microbiol. 1996; 19: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A link between recombination and replication is implied in one model (10Clark A.J. Sandler S.J. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 20: 125-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) which postulates that the in vivo role of RecF, in conjunction with RecO and RecR, is to divert damaged ssDNA 1The abbreviations used are: ss, single-stranded; ds, double-stranded; gDNA, gapped DNA; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphate; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; EPPS, N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-3-propanesulfonic acid from the replication process so that recombinational DNA repair can take place. In vitro, RecF protein binds to both ssDNA and dsDNA and hydrolyzes ATP (11Griffin IV, T.J. Kolodner R.D. J. Bact. 1990; 172: 6291-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 12Madiraju M.V.V.S.

The RecF and RecR proteins, acting together, limit the extension of RecA filaments beyond DNA gaps (15Webb B.L. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 347-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). All of the functions of RecF may come together in recombinational DNA repair, providing a useful paradigm within which to examine RecF protein activities (16Huang L.C. Wood E.A. Cox M.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6076-6083Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,17Cox M.M. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A detailed in vitro characterization of the RecF protein can help in elucidating function. The DNA binding properties of RecF protein have been described in several reports. The binding to ssDNA binding is ATP-independent (11Griffin IV, T.J. Kolodner R.D. J. Bact. 1990; 172: 6291-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 12Madiraju M.V.V.S. Clark A.J.

RecF protein binds to dsDNA weakly in the presence of ATP but binds much more stably when RecR is included or in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, ATPγS (14Webb B.L. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31397-31404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The role of the ATP hydrolytic activity of RecF in dsDNA binding has not been analyzed. The RecF protein contains a consensus nucleotide binding fold (GXXGXGKT) in the N-terminal portion, which is highly conserved among the known recF gene sequences. The relevance of this nucleotide binding fold to the in vivofunction of RecF was suggested by the observation that a single amino acid substitution within it (Lys to Arg at position 36) appears to be a null allele (recF4101) (18Ayora S. Alonso J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2766-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 19Sandler S.J. Chackerian B. Li J.T. Clark A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Comparable mutations in the conserved ATP binding sites of RecA (20Rehrauer W.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1292-1297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), UvrB (21Seeley T.W. Grossman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3263-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) also produce mutant phenotypes in vivo and result in mutant proteins that bind but do not hydrolyze ATP. A further indication that the capacity to hydrolyze ATP plays a role in RecF function is the recF4101 (also RecF K36R, with a mutation in the ATP binding site) overexpression phenotype. Overexpression of wild-type RecF renders cells inviable at 42 °C. However, cells overexpressing the RecF4101 protein are viable (23Sandler S.J. Clark A.J. Genetics. 1993; 135: 643-654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In light of these findings, we have studied the role of ATP hydrolysis in RecF protein function, focusing on DNA binding. We have also examined the effects of RecR protein and the binding of RecF protein to gap junctions in DNA. E. coli RecF and RecR proteins were purified as described (14Webb B.L. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31397-31404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The mutant RecF protein, RecF K36R, was purified according to the procedure used for wild-type RecF protein. All protein preparations were free of detectable endo- or exonuclease activities. Protein concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using the extinction coefficients: ε280 = 3.87 × 104m−1 cm−1 for RecF protein and RecF K36R protein (this work) and ε280 = 5.60 × 103m−1 cm−1 for RecR protein (24Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 519-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). At no time during purification or storage was the RecF protein subjected to conditions, as defined in this work, under which the protein would aggregate and would be inactivated. The purified RecF and RecF K36R proteins are shown in Fig.1. Restriction endonucleases were purchased from New England Biolabs. MES and EPPS buffers, bovine serum albumin, ATP, glycerol, sodium chloride, phosphocreatine, creatine phosphokinase, NADH, and phosphoenolpyruvate were from Sigma. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the University of Wisconsin Biochemistry Department Synthesis Facility. [α-32P]dideoxyATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. ATPγS was purchased from Boehringer-Mannheim Biochemicals. The extinction coefficient for native RecF protein was determined by a published procedure (25Lohman T.M. Chao K. Green J.M. Sage S. Runyon G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10139-10147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), modified as described (26Marrione P.E. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9809-9818Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The results of four determinations were averaged to give an extinction coefficient of native RecF as ε280, M, native = 3.87 ± 0.12 × 104m−1 cm−1. The RecF concentrations determined using this method were in good agreement with the concentration determined by the Bradford method. This same extinction coefficient was used for the RecF K36R mutant. Supercoiled circular duplex φX174 RFI DNA was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Linear φX174 dsDNA was prepared by complete digestion by PstI. Circular ssDNA from M13mp8.1037 was prepared as described (24Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 519-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Bacteriophage M13mp8.1037 was derived from M13mp8, having a 1037-base pair insertion (EcoRV-EcoRV fragment from the E. coligalT gene) in the SmaI site. Linear dsDNA radiolabeled at the 3′-end was generated using terminal transferase and [α-32P]dideoxyATP. The concentrations of dsDNA and ssDNA stock solutions were measured by absorbance at 260 nm, using 50 and 36 μg ml−1 A260−1, respectively, as the conversion factors. DNA concentrations are expressed in terms of total nucleotides. DNA was stored in TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, plus 1 mm EDTA) Gapped DNA with a precisely defined gap length was prepared essentially as described (27Lindsley J.E. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 695-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Gapped DNA having a 1037 base single-stranded gap (GD1037) was prepared by annealing NaOH-denatured M13mp8 linearized by SmaI digestion to M13mp8.1037 (28Lindsley J.E. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10164-10171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) circular ssDNA. GD3329 was prepared by annealing the 4937-base pair fragment of a SmaI-BspHI digest of M13mp8 to M13mp8.1037 circular ssDNA. Thus GD1037 and GD3329 have a common 8266 base M13mp8.1037 inner circle and have different length linear DNAs annealed to it (7229 and 4937 bp, respectively). As an additional purification step, to remove contaminating M13mp8.1037 circular ssDNA and linear M13mp8 dsDNA after hydroxylapatite chromatography, the gapped DNA was electrophoresed on a 0.8% SeaPlaque GTG-agarose gel, and the DNA band corresponding to GD1037 or GD3329 was excised. The gel slice was melted at 65 °C and extracted 1:1 with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1). The final preparation of DNA was precipitated twice with ethanol. To generate a plasmid containing the mutant recF allele, recF4101, and thus permitting overexpression of the RecF K36R protein, site-directed mutagenesis was performed using an oligonucleotide similar to that used by Sandleret al. (19Sandler S.J. Chackerian B. Li J.T. Clark A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (5′-CAGCACGCTGGTACGGCCGCTGCCGTTGGCA-3′) and using pBLW20 as the template (14Webb B.L. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31397-31404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid encoded a mutant recF gene with the lysine at position 36 changed to arginine. This change was verified by sequencing, and theXbaI-NcoI fragment containing this mutation was then ligated back into pBLW20 to produce pBLW23. Overexpression of RecF K36R protein was performed exactly as for wild-type RecF protein, by transforming pBLW23 into the E. coli strain K38/pGP1–2 (29Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2455) Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, reactions were performed in buffer A: 25 mm buffer (see below), 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm sodium chloride, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mmdithiothreitol. MES buffer was used for reactions at pH 5.7, 6.1, and 6.5. EPPS buffer was used for reactions at pH 6.7, 7.2, 7.6, 8.1, and 8.5. The reported pH of reaction mixtures reflect pH measurements (at 25 °C) of solutions containing all reaction components (except that storage buffers were substituted for proteins). We observed that RecF protein aggregates under certain conditions, causing an increase in turbidity at 340 nm when introduced into reactions monitored spectrophotometrically. Therefore, we used this signal as a measure of RecF protein aggregation to determine reaction components that prevent this effect. A Perkin-Elmer Lambda 7 double-beam recording spectrophotometer equipped with two thermojacketed cuvette holders, each capable of holding six cuvettes, was used for absorbance measurements. The cell length and the band pass were 0.5 cm and 2 nm, respectively. All components indicated except RecF and RecR were added to a 400-μl reaction mixture containing buffer A (EPPS, pH 7.6, except as stated otherwise). This was preincubated in the spectrophotometer at 37 C until the absorbance reading at 340 nm was stable. Then RecF protein (0.5 μm) and, as indicated, RecR protein (1.0 μm) were added, and the apparent absorbance (signal increase reflecting scattered light) was automatically measured every 30 s. Relative RecF protein aggregation was measured as an increase in the absorbance at 340 nm because of turbidity. The average of duplicate experiments is reported. The data is used comparatively, and no absolute measure of the degree of RecF protein aggregation is either known or implied. Reactions for observing RecF K36R protein binding to linear dsDNA were performed in buffer A (EPPS, pH 7.2) including 3 μm φX174 linear dsDNA, 1 mm ATP, and 0.6 μm RecF K36R protein. The reactions for observing RecF protein binding to dsDNA in the presence of ATPγS were performed in buffer A (pH 8.1) including 1 μm φX174 linear dsDNA, 1 mm ATPγS, and 0.2 μm RecF protein. The pH studies of wild-type RecF protein were performed in buffer A at the indicated pH including 1 μm φX174 linear dsDNA, 1 mm ATP or ATPγS, and 0.2 μm RecF protein. In all experiments, after the addition of RecF protein (or RecF K36R protein), the reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The samples were then spread undiluted and without cross-linking for microscopy, as described previously (14Webb B.L. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31397-31404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The grids were washed in reaction buffer containing 15% glycerol and of the appropriate pH before staining and shadowing. ATP hydrolysis by RecF protein was measured by a coupled enzyme assay. A Perkin-Elmer Lambda 7 was used for absorbance measurements in this assay. The regeneration of ATP from ADP and phosphoenolpyruvate coupled to the oxidation of NADH can be followed by the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm (the absorption maximum, which provides a level of sensitivity sufficient for the measurement of the relatively weak ATPase activity of RecF protein). Rates of ATP hydrolysis were measured at 37 °C at the following pH values: 5.7, 6.1, 6.5, 6.7, 7.2, 7.6, 8.1, and 8.5. Reaction mixtures (400 ml) contained buffer A of the indicated pH, 20 μmφX174 linear dsDNA, and 3 mm ATP. An ATP regenerating system (1.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 4.5 units ml−1, and 3 mm potassium glutamate) and a coupling system (0.6 mm NADH and 4.5 units ml−1 lactate dehydrogenase) were also included. The basal level of the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was measured for 45 min prior to the addition of RecF protein. The rate of ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by RecF protein was calculated by subtracting this basal level from the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm measured for 45 min after the addition of RecF protein (2.5 μm). At each pH, the average of duplicate experiments is reported. Duplicate measurements of rates greater than 0.4 μmmin−1 varied by no more than 7%, and those below 0.4 μm min−1 varied by no more than 15%. Agarose gel assays were carried out to detect complexes between RecF protein and linear dsDNA, as described previously (14Webb B.L. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31397-31404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Challenge reactions were performed by preincubating RecF protein with 32P-labeled dsDNA in the presence of either ATP or ATPγS prior to challenging with unlabeled dsDNA to determine how the stability of RecF·dsDNA complexes was affected by nucleotide cofactor and other parameters. RecF protein (1.33 μm) was preincubated with 32P-labeled linear dsDNA (20 μm, as indicated in appropriate figure legends) in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing either ATP or ATPγS in buffer A (EPPS, pH 8.1) at 37 °C. After 10 min, unlabeled linear dsDNA (10 or 100 μm, as indicated) was added to the reaction (or TE for the control reaction). Portions of the reaction were stopped at the indicated times by the addition of EDTA (10 mm). A gel loading buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50% glycerol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue) was then added, and samples were electrophoresed on a 0.7% agarose gel at 3 V/cm with recirculation of the running buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mm sodium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA) at room temperature. The gel was then dried, and the DNA was detected by autoradiography. A modified assay patterned after a published procedure (30Hegde S.P. Rajagopalan M. Madiraju M.V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was used to detect complexes between RecF and linear dsDNA or gapped DNA. Competition reactions in which one DNA substrate was preincubated with RecF prior to challenging with the second DNA substrate were used to detect any preferential binding. The reaction buffer contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (61% cation), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 5% (w/v) glycerol. Reactions containing 15 μm DNA (GD1037, M13mp8.1037 linear dsDNA, or both as indicated), 0.3 μm RecF (giving one RecF per 50 nucleotides), and 1 mm ATPγS were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The final pH of the mixture was 7.59 at 25 °C. For the challenge reactions, RecF was preincubated with one of the DNA cofactors for 10 min at 37 °C, followed by addition of the second DNA with the incubation continued for 30 min. A gel loading buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50% (w/v) glycerol, and 0.025% bromphenol blue) was added to each reaction, and the samples were immediately electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose gel at 2.5 V/cm in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA with recirculation of the buffer. The DNA was then detected by ethidium bromide staining. In the presence of ATP, the RecF protein appears to exist as a monomer in solution. In gel filtration trials carried out on columns equilibrated with buffer containing 1 mm ATP and 100 mm NaCl, RecF protein (40.5 kDa) consistently migrates slightly slower than the 22-kDa RecR protein (14Webb B.L. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31397-31404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). 2B. L. Webb, unpublished results.Under these conditions, Umezu and Kolodner (31Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30005-30013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that RecR existed as a dimer, a result we have confirmed,2 so that the slower migration of RecF protein is most consistent with a monomeric species. Our own observations and hints in some published reports suggested that the activity of RecF proteins may be affected by instability and/or insolubility in vitro. Madiraju and Clark (12Madiraju M.V.V.S. Clark A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6295-6300Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) noted that incubation of prediluted RecF protein for 30 min prior to its addition to a reaction mixture resulted in total loss of DNA binding activity. We observed that RecF protein loaded onto a gel filtration column does not elute unless the column is equilibrated and developed in buffer containing either ATP or high salt (1 m NaCl) (14Webb B.L. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31397-31404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we noticed that solutions containing RecF protein became visibly cloudy with what appeared to be precipitated or aggregated protein under a variety of conditions. We do not know whether the cloudy appearance of the solutions is because of precipitated protein or simply large aggregates. We generally employ the term “aggregation” throughout this paper, without implying any particular physical effect. To follow up on these observations, we have used changes in turbidity as a measure of RecF protein aggregation or precipitation in vitro. As applied, this method is not intended to represent a quantitative measurement of the fraction of RecF protein aggregated. Instead, it was used to compare relative levels of RecF protein aggregation under different conditions and to identify solution conditions where this could be avoided. RecF protein added to a reaction mixture containing no ATP or DNA at 37 °C aggregated almost immediately, as indicated by a large increase in turbidity (Fig.2 A). With RecF protein concentrations above 1 μm, the aggregation was manifested by a visible cloudy precipitate in the solution. The effect was temperature-dependent, as RecF protein was completely stable at 4 °C but aggregated shortly after a shift to 37 C (Fig.2 A). Exclusion of Mg2+ from the buffer delayed but did not eliminate this phenomenon (data not shown). To determine whether RecF protein was irreversibly inactivated by aggregation, the resulting white precipitate was collected by centrifugation, resuspended in storage buffer, and assayed for DNA binding activity. No activity was detected (data not shown). We do not know whether the protein is partially denatured and thereby inactive, or if it is simply present as large aggregates that are inaccessible to substrates. In either case, to date we have been unable to restore RecF protein to a form capable of ATP hydrolysis or DNA binding once the protein has come out of solution. Because diluted RecF protein has been shown to be active for DNA binding and ATP hydrolysis under a variety of solution conditions, the reaction components that prevent or delay the aggregation of RecF protein were determined. As shown in Fig. 2 B, aggregation is not affected by the addition of dsDNA but is decreased by ATP. Increasing the ATP concentration from 1 to 3 mm resulted in markedly less aggregation (data not shown). When present together, dsDNA and ATP slow the precipitation even more, suggesting a synergistic effect. Like ATP, ATPγS had only a small effect on aggregation. However, ATPγS in combination with dsDNA greatly reduced the observed turbidity change. These are conditions under which RecF protein is stably bound to dsDNA (14Webb B.L. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31397-31404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Even though RecF protein remains in solution much longer when bound to DNA, it does slowly precipitate even under these conditions (Fig. 2 B). In the absence of ATP, RecR protein had no effect on RecF protein aggregation either in the presence or absence of dsDNA. RecR protein also had no effect in the presence of ATP when dsDNA was not also present (data not shown). However, the combination of the RecR protein, ATP, and dsDNA greatly reduced the turbidity increase (Fig.2 B). These are again conditions under which RecF protein (and RecR) are stably bound to the DNA (14Webb B.L. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31397-31404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 15Webb B.L. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 347-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although the ssDNA binding activity of RecF has been reported to be ATP-independent, aggregation of RecF protein as measured by changes in turbidity was reduced by ssDNA in the presence of ATP (Fig.2 B) but not in the absence of ATP (data not shown). The above studies indicate that RecF protein tends to aggregate and becomes inactive when it is not bound to DNA. In an attempt to find solution conditions which might stabilize RecF protein in the absence of DNA, we tested a variety of salts, detergents, and stabilizing agents for their ability to prevent RecF protein aggregation. We found that a combination of 30% glycerol, 2 mg/ml BSA, and 150 mm NaCl significantly reduced RecF protein precipitation in the absence of ATP or DNA. As indicated by a lack of significant increases in turbidity, RecF protein was completely soluble and unaggregated for at least 2 h when these stabilization components were combined with ATPγS and dsDNA (Fig. 2 B). Although we have not fully characterized the effect of these conditions on RecF activities in vitro, they do not appear to significantly affect the dsDNA binding activity of RecF as measured by an agarose gel shift assay or its ATPase activity (data not shown). Using electron microscopy, two previous observations inferred that ATP hydrolysis by RecF protein leads to its dissociation from dsDNA (14Webb B.L. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31397-31404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). First, RecF protein binds tightly to dsDNA in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, ATPγS. Second, much less RecF protein is bound in the presence of ATP, which is hydrolyzed by RecF protein. To verify that an inability to hydrolyze ATP blocks the dissociation of RecF protein from dsDNA, we generated and purified a RecF mutant protein that alters the ATP binding site (RecF K36R). The mutation is identical to the recF4101 mutant described by Sandleret al. (19Sandler S.J. Chackerian B. Li J.T. Clark A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). RecF K36R does not hydrolyze ATP (14Webb B.L. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31397-31404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). RecF K36R protein was assayed for ATPase activity in six separate trials carried out over a period of 5 months. Four of these utilized the spectrophotometric assay described under “Materials and Methods,” while the other two used the thin layer chromatography method (14Webb B.L. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31397-31404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In two of the trials, multiple reactions were run side by side with and without the RecR protein, which stimulates ATP hydrolysis by the wild-type RecF protein (14Webb B.L. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31397-31404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out at pH 7.2 under standard reaction conditions, except that four of the trials included the optimal stabilizing conditions of 30% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mg/ml BSA, and 3 mm ATP. ATP hydrolysis was not detected at any level in any of these trials (data not shown). We conclude that at least under these conditions, the RecF K36R mutant protein does not hydrolyze ATP. As shown in Fig. 3, RecF K36R protein binds to and coats linear dsDNA in the presence of ATP. In a count of 98 molecules selected at random from two separate experiments, 97 or 99% were coated with protein. The molecule in Fig. 3 B is typical of this population, with molecules varying somewhat in the number and lengths of small discontinuities in the protein coat. The DNA bound with mutant protein appears identical to dsDNA coated"

The enzyme is dormant in resting cells but becomes activated when the cells are exposed to appropriate stimuli. Upon activation, a cytosolic complex consisting of the oxidase components p47 PHOX, p67 PHOX, and p40 PHOX associates with the membrane-bound cytochromeb 558 to assemble the active oxidase (2Someya A.

One key to understanding the activation of the oxidase emerged with the discovery of the cell-free activation system (15Bromberg Y. Pick E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4232-4236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Our studies showed that the oxidase can be activated by p47 PHOX phosphorylated by protein kinase C in a cell-free system containing neutrophil membrane and cytosol (21Park J.-W. Hoyal C.R. el Benna J. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11035-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In addition, these studies also revealed a that the phosphorylation of p47 PHOX was not the only ATP-dependent step in the activation of the oxidase by protein kinase C. A preceding phosphorylation event occurs in the membranes rendering them capable of supporting oxidase activation. The target of this event has yet to be determined. Although these experiments showed a direct relationship between the phosphorylation of p47 PHOX and the activation of the oxidase, the use of whole cytosol made it difficult to recognize whether cytosolic factors other than those necessary for activation by SDS are required for oxidase activation by a kinase. In this paper we report studies of a recombinant cell-free system containing only membrane and cytosolic oxidase components (p47 PHOX, p67 PHOX, and Rac2). Our findings suggest that the cytosolic components phosphorylated p47 PHOX, p67 PHOX, and Rac2 are sufficient for partial activation of the oxidase. Chemicals and enzymes were obtained from the following sources: dextran and Ficoll-Hypaque from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; phosphatidylserine, diacylglycerol, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, NADPH, ATP, guanosine 5-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS), 1The abbreviations used are: GTPγS, guanosine 5-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; GDPβS, guanosine 5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis guanosine 5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDPβS), glutathione agarose and cytochromec from Sigma; rat brain protein kinase C, calyculin A, and GF-109203X from Calbiochem; and the Bradford protein assay reagent from Bio-Rad. Neutrophil cytosol and membrane were prepared as described by Borregaard et al.(23Borregaard N. Heiple J.M. Simons E.R. Clark R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Neutrophils were prepared from normal subjects by dextran sedimentation and Ficoll-Hypaque fractionation of freshly drawn citrate-anticoagulated blood. The neutrophils were suspended at 108 cells/ml in a modified relaxation buffer (0.1m KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm PIPES buffer, pH 7.3). Plasma membrane and cytosol were prepared by nitrogen cavitation followed by centrifugation through a Percoll gradient. Both cytosol and membrane were divided into aliquots and stored at −70 °C until use. Purified recombinant p67 PHOX was produced by means of the baculovirus system described by Leto et al. (1991), using a p67 PHOX-expressing recombinant virus generously provided by T. L. Leto. Large scale production of pure recombinant p67 PHOX was achieved by infecting monolayer cultures of Sf9 cells in 150 cm2 flasks at a density of 1–2 × 106 cells/ml (24Leto T.L. Garrett M.C. Fujii H. Nunoi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19812-19818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 72 h postinfection, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline by centrifugation at 400 × g for 10 min, and then resuspended to 5 × 107/ml in lysis buffer (50 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5.4 mmPIPES, pH 7.5). All subsequent work was conducted at 4 °C. Cells were disrupted by sonication (4 × 10 s) and centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min. The supernatant fraction containing p67 PHOX was brought to 45% saturation with solid ammonium sulfate. The resulting precipitate was isolated by centrifugation (1200 × g at 4 °C for 30 min), then dissolved in 10 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmEGTA, 0.15 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. The dialyzed solution was applied to a Mono Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously equilibrated with buffer A and washed with 5 volumes of the same buffer. Proteins were eluted from the column by fast protein liquid chromatography with a 0.1–0.3 m NaCl gradient in the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The fractions containing purified p67 PHOX were pooled and stored at −70 °C. Recombinant fusion proteins composed of glutathioneS-transferase (GST) linked downstream to p47 PHOX or Rac2 were isolated from Escherichia coli transformed with pGEX-1λT plasmids containing cDNA inserts encoding the downstream proteins as described by Park et al. (3Park J.-W. El Benna J. Scott K.E. Christensen B.L. Chanock S.J. Babior B.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2907-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose beads. Initially the culture was grown overnight at 37 °C in 100 ml of “Terrific Broth” containing 0.1% ampicillin, then diluted into 1 liter of fresh Terrific Broth/ampicillin. The diluted cultures were grown for an additional hour at 37 °C (for GST-p47 PHOX expression) or an additional 2.5 h at 37 °C (for GST-Rac2 expression). Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.1 mm) was then added, and the cultures were grown with vigorous agitation for an additional 3 h at 37 °C for GST-p47 PHOX expression or 30 °C for GST-Rac2 expression. At the conclusion of the incubations, the cells were recovered by centrifugation at 2000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The GST-p47 PHOX pellet was suspended in 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing a 1 × mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), while the GST-Rac2 pellet was resuspended in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were then disrupted by sonication. The sonicates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The fusion proteins were isolated from the supernatant by purification over glutathione-agarose as described by Smith and Johnson (25Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Before use, excess glutathione was removed from the solution of purified recombinant protein by dialysis against relaxation buffer. The concentrations of all proteins (95–99% pure) were determined with a Bio-Rad assay kit using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Phosphorylation of recombinant GST-p47 PHOX was carried out using 200 μg of fusion protein in final volume of 200 μl. The reaction mixture contained 1 mm ATP, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 10 μg phosphatidylserine, 1 μg diolein, and 0.5 unit of protein kinase C in 200 μl of relaxation buffer (0.1 m KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm PIPES buffer, pH 7.3). The lipids were added as mixed liposomes prepared by dissolving 2.5 mg/ml phosphatidylserine and 1 mg/ml diacylglycerol in chloroform, removing the chloroform under a stream of nitrogen, and then sonicating the dried lipids for 2 min on ice in 0.8 ml of 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4. Incubations were carried out for 30 min at 37 °C. The phosphorylated protein, designated p47 PHOXP6, 2Protein kinase C-phosphorylated P47 PHOX is designated p47 PHOXP6, because it contains 6 mol of phosphate/mol of p47 PHOX.was separated from the reaction mixture as described elsewhere (21Park J.-W. Hoyal C.R. el Benna J. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11035-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Activation of the NADPH oxidase in the cell-free system was directly measured by following the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome cat 550 nm in a dual beam recording spectrophotometer. The complete reaction mixture contained 5 × 106 cell equivalents of membrane (12 ± 1.4 pmol of cytochromeb 558) incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with 50 μm GTPγS or GDPβS, 1 mm ATP, 250 nm calyculin A, and 105 pmol of GST-Rac2, 75 pmol of p67 PHOX and 70 pmol of GST p47 PHOX, phosphorylated or unphosphosphorylated, in a final volume of 200 μl. GST-Rac2 was reconstituted with 130 μm GTPγS by preincubation of 105 pmol of the protein with 2.6 mm EDTA for 10 min at room temperature followed by the addition of 4 mmMgCl2 (26Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Kinsella B.T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23575-23582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were started by adding the detection mixture (0.1 mm cytochrome c and 0.16 mm NADPH, final concentrations). Reduction was followed in a Uvikon 941 dual beam recording spectrophotometer (Kontron Instruments, Milan, Italy), reading against a reference containing the same components plus 150 units of superoxide dismutase. Unless otherwise indicated, the rate of O⨪2 production is expressed as moles of O⨪2/moles of cytochromeb 558/minute. Where indicated, cytosol (107 cell equivalents) was added to the system instead of the recombinant proteins GST-p47 PHOX, p67 PHOX, and GST-Rac2. Experiments were also performed in which the recombinant proteins (p67 PHOX, GST-p47 PHOX, and GST-Rac2) were individually omitted to determine which of these proteins was required for the production of O⨪2 by the oxidase. In these experiments, 5 × 106 cell equivalents of membrane were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with 105 pmol of GST-Rac2, 75 pmol of p67 PHOX and 70 pmol of GST p47 PHOX plus 50 μm GTPγS as described previously, with the exception that unphosphorylated p47 PHOX was used in place of p47 PHOXP6. After the preincubation, SDS (90 μm final concentration) was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 1 min. In some experiments, cytosol (107cell eq) was used in place of the recombinant proteins as described above. Neutrophil membranes (1 × 107 cell eq) were resuspended in 400 μl of Triton buffer (0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.25, containing 2% Triton (v/v). Cytochromeb 558 content was measured as the dithionite-reduced minus oxidized absorption assuming ΔE 559–540 = 21.6 mm−1 cm−1 (27Cross A.R. Higson F.R. Jones O.T.G. Harper A.M. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In some spectra the height of the peak was estimated by interpolation to correct for base-line drift. Protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE using the Laemmli buffer system (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. Alternatively, the separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose sheet (29Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) and probed with partially purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against full-length Rac2 or the C-terminal decapeptides from p47 PHOX and p67 PHOX. These antibodies were used at 1:1000, 1:2000, and 1:5000 dilution for GST-Rac2, GST-p47 PHOX, and p67 PHOX, respectively. The proteins were visualized with a 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit Ig antibody (Caltag) and the ECL enzymatic chemoluminescence detection system (Renaissance, DuPont). In the experiments described below, neutrophil membranes were mixed with recombinant cytosolic oxidase proteins in various combinations. SDS-PAGE gels of the recombinant proteins used for these experiments are shown in Fig. 1. Since the experiments involved the addition of cytosolic components to the assay mixtures, it was important to determine whether any of these components was present in the neutrophil membrane that was to be used in the experiments. For this purpose, membrane and cytosol in equal amounts (expressed as cell equivalents) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, developing with antibodies against the cytosolic components that were to be added in recombinant form. The components were readily visible in the cytosol, but could not be detected in the membrane. In the cell-free system, the leukocyte NADPH oxidase has customarily been activated using certain anionic amphiphiles including SDS. In an earlier study in which we supplemented the cell-free system with p47 PHOX (added as the GST fusion protein), we found that the enzyme could be activated without detergent, provided the p47 PHOX was first phosphorylated by protein kinase C (21Park J.-W. Hoyal C.R. el Benna J. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11035-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We believe that the activation of the cell-free oxidase by protein kinase C may represent a more physiological process than activation by anionic amphiphiles, because in intact cells, as in the kinase-activated cell-free system, oxidase activation is associated with the phosphorylation of p47 PHOX. It has been shown by others that in a cell-free system in which neutrophil cytosol has been replaced by the two recombinant cytosolic oxidase subunits p47 PHOX and p67 PHOX together with the small GTPase Rac2, O⨪2 is produced upon the addition of SDS (30Abo A. Boyhan A. West I. Thrasher A.J. Segal A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16767-16770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to see if the same system could be activated by a kinase, we conducted experiments in which O⨪2 production was measured in a recombinant system that contained phosphorylated p47 PHOX (i.e. p47 PHOXP6) instead of the unphosphorylated protein. The results (Fig.2) showed that O⨪2 was produced in the complete system, but that the omission of all or any one of the three recombinant cytosolic proteins or the omission of membrane (not shown) essentially eliminated oxidase activity. The use in the recombinant system of Rac2 preloaded with GDPβS led to a marked reduction in O⨪2 formation as compared with a system that employed Rac2 preloaded with GTPγS, suggesting that Rac2 had to be in its active form for the oxidase to be activated (Fig.3). These findings indicate that all four components (membrane, p67 PHOX, p47 PHOXP6, and Rac2) were required for activation of the NADPH oxidase, indicating that they are both necessary and sufficient for kinase-dependent cell-free oxidase activation.Figure 3Requirement for guanine nucleotides in the activation of the NADPH oxidase by p47 PHOXP6 in the recombinant cell-free system. Experiments were conducted as described in the text; Rac2 was loaded with GTPγS or GDPβS as indicated. The results shown represent the mean ± S.E. of four separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Experiments with a cell-free system containing membrane and cytosol indicated that the phosphorylation of p47 PHOX was an essential prerequisite for O⨪2 production by the system (31El Benna J. Park J.-W. Ruedi J.M. Babior B.M. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 1995; 21: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To see if the same situation prevailed in the recombinant system, the rate of O⨪2 production using p47 PHOXP6 was compared with the rate of O⨪2 production using unphosphorylated p47 PHOX. The results (Fig. 4) show that O⨪2 production in this system required the phosphorylation of p47 PHOX. It is possible that further phosphorylation of p47 PHOX by a membrane-associated kinase might also be necessary for the O⨪2-forming activity in this system. The addition of the protein kinase inhibitor GF-109203X to the reaction mixture, however, had no effect on O⨪2 production, indicating that phosphorylation at least by GF-109203X-inhibitable membrane-associated kinases such as activated protein kinase C was not a factor in these experiments. The effect of protein concentration on O⨪2 production in the recombinant system was next examined. In these experiments activity was monitored at varying concentrations of the three recombinant proteins in the presence of a constant amount of membrane (Fig.5 A) and at varying concentrations of membrane in the presence of a constant amount of recombinant proteins (Fig. 5 B). The maximal rate of O⨪2 generation by the p47 PHOXP6-activated system was 4.6 ± 0.5 nmol O⨪2/min/107 cell eq of membrane (mean ± S.E., n = 6), equivalent to 190 mol of O⨪2/mol of cytochromeb 558/min, a value achieved using 5 × 106 cell equivalents of membrane (12 pmol of cytochromeb 558), 105 pmol of GST-Rac2, 75 pmol of p67 PHOX, and 70 pmol of GST p47 PHOXP6, the rate falling sharply at concentrations on either side of the optimum. In order to investigate if this effect also occurred in the cytosolic cell-free system, production of O⨪2 using the same concentration of Rac2 and p67 PHOX at different concentrations of p47 PHOXP6 was determined. At the concentration of p47 PHOXP6 used in this study, the activity of the recombinant and cytosolic cell-free systems were the same (Fig.6). Curiously, the addition of more than 70 pmol of p47 PHOXP6 reduced O⨪2 production in the recombinant system but not in the cytosolic cell-free system. When the oxidase is activated, p47 PHOX, p67 PHOX, and Rac2 translocate to the membrane in equimolar quantities (32Quinn M.T. Evans T. Loetterle L.R. Jesaitis A.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20983-20987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore we employed approximately equimolar concentrations of the three recombinant cytosolic components (actual stoichiometry 1.5/1/1 for Rac2/p47 PHOX/p67 PHOX). Altogether, these results indicate that an excess of either membrane or cytosolic components inhibits O⨪2 production in the recombinant cell-free system. Why this same relationship doesn't prevail in the cytosol-containing system is a mystery.Figure 6Oxidase activity as a function of GST-p47 PHOXP6 concentration in the recombinant and cytosolic cell-free systems. The incubations were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures,” assaying O⨪2production by cytochrome c reduction. The recombinant reaction mixtures contained 75 pmol of p67 PHOX, 105 pmol of GST-Rac2, and GST-p47 PHOXP6 at the concentrations shown. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) p47 PHOXP6produced similar rates of production of O⨪2 in the recombinant and cytosolic cell-free systems (Fig.7 A). In contrast when SDS was used as the stimulus, the rate of O⨪2 production in the recombinant cell-free system was approximately 50% of the rate seen with cytosol (Fig. 7 B), and both rates were considerably greater than the rates obtained in the p47 PHOXP6-activated systems. These results strongly suggest that while p47 PHOXP6 is sufficient to activate the oxidase at a low level, something from the cytosol that is missing in the recombinant cell-free system is required for maximal activation of the oxidase. It has been known for many years that p47 PHOX becomes heavily phosphorylated on serine residues when the oxidase is activated (8Babior B.M. Hayakawa T. Suzuki K. Suzuki S. Clin.

Invest. 1995; 96: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Here we present evidence that p47 PHOXphosphorylated by protein kinase C is capable of activating the leukocyte NADPH oxidase in a recombinant cell-free system consisting of neutrophil membrane, p67 PHOX and Rac2, therefore identifying the minimum cytosolic components necessary for kinase-dependent activation of the oxidase. These findings strongly suggest that the phosphorylation of p47 PHOX that occurs in whole cells during the activation of the leukocyte oxidase is functionally significant and that protein kinase C is a kinase capable of activating p47 PHOX by phosphorylation. In addition, our results with GTPγS and GDPβS confirm that the activation of the enzyme by protein kinase C also requires the activation of Rac2, as shown previously by others (34Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Evans T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1991; 254: 1512-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 35Bromberg Y. Shani E. Joseph G. Gorzalczany Y. Sperling O. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7055-7058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of activation of the NADPH oxidase by anionic amphiphiles is still not clear, but our results confirm previous studies demonstrating that the activation of the NADPH oxidase by SDS is not kinase dependent (20McPhail L.C. Qualliotine-Mann D. Waite K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7931-7935Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the finding that oxidase activation is associated with the phosphorylation of p47 PHOX both in intact cells and in the kinase-dependent cell-free system suggests that as compared with amphiphiles, the activation of the oxidase by protein kinase C may represent a more physiological process. The fact that p47 PHOXS379A is nonfunctional both in whole cells and in the kinase-dependent cell-free system, yet is capable of participating in O⨪2 production in the amphiphile-dependent cell-free system (21Park J.-W. Hoyal C.R. el Benna J. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11035-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 33Faust L.P. El Benna J. Babior B.M. Chanock S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), further supports the physiological role played by protein kinase C-dependent activation of the oxidase. The foregoing experiments also showed that the addition of p47 PHOXP6 to a cell-free oxidase activating system is not enough to activate the oxidase to its full extent. A number of cytosolic components can be postulated as candidate factor(s) that allow the oxidase to become fully activated. These include lipids (e.g. arachidonic acid (36Dana R. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Levy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 441-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar)), proteins (e.g.p40 PHOX (37Tsunawaki S. Kagara S. Yoshikawa K. Yoshida L.S. Kuratsuji T. Namiki H. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar)), possibly other kinases, or perhaps a hitherto undiscovered oxidase component. Nevertheless, our findings show that neutrophil membrane, p47 PHOX, p67 PHOX, and Rac2 are sufficient for protein kinase C-mediated activation of the oxidase, albeit at a relatively low level. The participation of other components in the kinase-dependent activation of NADPH oxidase is the subject of an ongoing investigation."

The adenovirus E1A oncogene encodes two major proteins containing 289 and 243 amino acid residues (hereafter referred to as E1A 289R and E1A 243R), which are translated from two alternatively spliced transcripts, 13S and 12S, respectively (13Berk A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 45-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Moran E. Mathews M.B. Cell. 1987; 48: 177-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The multifunctional E1A 289R and E1A 243R proteins are identical in sequence with the exception of a 46-amino acid domain, conserved region 3 (CR3), which endows the larger protein with potent transactivation properties (13Berk A.J.

Even though it lacks the CR3 region, E1A 243R is as capable as E1A 289R of inducing PCNA expression either in the context of a viral infection or in transient expression experiments in HeLa cells (17Zerler B. Roberts R.J. Mathews M.B. Moran E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 18Morris G.F. Mathews M.B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6397-6406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of PCNA expression by E1A 243R occurs at the transcriptional level through an increase in PCNA promoter activity (18Morris G.F. Mathews M.B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6397-6406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Acis-acting PCNA E1A-responsive element (PERE) resides between nucleotides −59 and −45 relative to the transcription start site of the PCNA promoter (19Labrie C. Morris G.F. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1697-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and can confer induction by the E1A 243R oncoprotein upon a normally E1A-unresponsive heterologous promoter (20Morris G.F. Labrie C. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 543-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PERE contains a sequence homologous to the activating transcription factor (ATF) motif (5′-TGACGTCG-3′) at its 3′ end, and sequences within the PERE including the ATF site are conserved between the rat, mouse, and human PCNA promoters (19Labrie C. Morris G.F. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1697-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It also contains sequences that match a consensus RFX1 binding site (see below). In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, the PERE forms three major complexes (P1, P2, and P3) with proteins in HeLa cell nuclear extracts (21Labrie C. Lee B.H. Mathews M.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3732-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). While transcription factors ATF-1 and CREB are the major components of complexes P2 and P3, RFX1 is the primary constituent of the P1 complex (21Labrie C. Lee B.H. Mathews M.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3732-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 22Lee B.H. Mathews M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4481-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The hepatitis B virus (HBV) enhancer-associated protein RFX1, also known as enhancer factor-C (23Siegrist C.A. Durand B. Emery P. David E. Hearing P. Mach B. Reith W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6375-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), is a ubiquitous protein that is able to transactivate the HBV enhancer and is required for major histocompatibility complex class II gene expression (23Siegrist C.A. Durand B. Emery P. David E. Hearing P. Mach B. Reith W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6375-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 24Reith W. Herrero-Sanchez C. Kobr M. Silacci P. Berte C. Barras E. Fey S. Mach B. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1528-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Conversely, there is evidence that RFX1 can subserve a transcriptional silencer function (25Reinhold W. Emens L. Itkes A. Blake M. Ichinose I. Zajac-Kaye M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3041-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and recent observations show that it contains both activation and suppression domains (26Katan Y. Agami R. Shaul Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3621-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To determine whether RFX1 contributes to the regulation of PCNA gene expression, we designed a series of mutations within and around the PERE and conducted both gel mobility shift analysis and transient transfection assays to evaluate the effects of these promoter mutations. The results show that RFX1 binding is sensitive to mutations both within and upstream of its consensus binding site. Moreover, the ability of RFX1 to form a complex on the PCNA promoter is inversely related to the transcriptional activity of the promoter with respect to both basal and E1A-induced expression. These data imply that the RFX1 protein may play an inhibitory role in regulating E1A-transactivated PCNA gene expression, and provide a basis for understanding the role of RFX1 in the p107-mediated down-regulation of the PCNA promoter (27Lee B.H. Liu M. Mathews M.B. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1138-1145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type PCNA-87 CAT and mutant constructs −46/−39, ATF-BAM, −56GA, and −59/−56 CAT were described previously (19Labrie C. Morris G.F. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1697-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 28Morris G.F. Mathews M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16116-16125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reporter plasmids −44/−40 and −53GT CAT contain single or multiple mutations in the PCNA promoter and were created by using an oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Plasmids expressing the E1B 19-kDa protein (pCMV19K), β-galactosidase (pCMVβ-gal), E1A243R (pCMV12S), and a truncated form of E1A 243R product (pCMV12S.FS), under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter have been described previously (18Morris G.F. Mathews M.B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6397-6406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pCH110 (29Hall C.V. Jacob P.E. Ringold G.M. Lee F. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1983; 2: 101-109PubMed Google Scholar) expressing β-galactosidase under the control of SV40 promoter was obtained from M. Gilman (Ariad Pharmaceuticals). Spinner cultures of HeLa cells (ATCC CCL2) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 μg/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (21Labrie C. Lee B.H. Mathews M.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3732-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 30Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested and rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized in two packed-cell volumes of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)). Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation and homogenized in 2.5 ml of Buffer C/109cells. Buffer C contains 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.42m NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 25% (v/v) glycerol. The supernatants were collected and dialyzed against two changes of Buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.1m KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 20% (v/v) glycerol). Samples were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. Oligonucleotides were synthesized in the DNA core facility center at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and contain a 5′ overhang (5′-GATC-3′) for labeling. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were prepared by annealing the complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides together in oligo buffer (10 mm Tris at pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA). The oligonucleotides are divided into two groups. 1) Short PERE probes contain sequences from −60 to −40 relative to the transcription initiation site of the human PCNA promoter. This group includes the wild-type PCNA sequence PERE(S), point mutant −53GT, and mutant −59/−56 (mutations are underlined).PERE(S):5′­CAGCGTGGTGACGTCGCAACG­3′−53GT:5′­CAGCGTGT¯TGACGTCGCAACG­3′−59/−56:5′­CCAGA¯TGGTGACGTCGCAACG­3′SEQUENCES 1–3 2) Long PERE probes contain sequences from −70 to −40 relative to the transcription start site of the human, rat, and mouse PCNA promoters. The nucleotide sequence between −70 and −60 is identical among different probes and combines several nonspecific mutations found in the linker-scanning mutants published previously (19Labrie C. Morris G.F. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1697-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This group includes the wild-type human PCNA sequence PERE(L), and mutant oligonucleotides −44/−40, ATF-BAM, −50/−40, and −56GA (mutations are underlined).PERE(L):5′­AGATCTGTCTCAGCGTGGTGACGTCGCAACG­3′−44/−40:5′­AGATCTGTCTCAGCGTGGTGACGTCGATCGA¯­3′ATF­BAM:5′­AGATCTGTCTCAGCGTGGTGGATC¯CGCAACG­3′−50/−40:5′­AGATCTGTCTCAGCGTGGTGGATCCCATCGA¯­3′−56GA:5′­AGATCTGTCTCAGCA¯TGGTGACGTCGCAACG­3′SEQUENCES 4–8 EMSA were performed as described previously (21Labrie C. Lee B.H. Mathews M.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3732-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 1× EMSA buffer (12 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 5% (v/v) glycerol), 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) as nonspecific DNA competitor, 5 μg of HeLa cell nuclear extract, and 20,000 cpm of oligonucleotide probe. Oligonucleotides were labeled with [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and cold dNTPs using DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment). All probes were purified through native 6% polyacrylamide gels, eluted from gel slices in oligo buffer containing 0.5% SDS, and dissolved in oligo buffer after phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. In some cases, the nuclear extract was replaced by protein synthesized in vitro (see below). Incubations were conducted on ice for 15 min in the absence of probe, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 15 min after addition of probe. When indicated, antibody was added to the binding reaction at least 1 h prior to the addition of probe and incubated at 4 °C. Anti-RFX1 antibody was a generous gift from P. Hearing (SUNY, Stony Brook, NY). Protein-DNA complexes were resolved in 5% polyacrylamide (29:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide), 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA gels. Plasmid pHRFX1 (23Siegrist C.A. Durand B. Emery P. David E. Hearing P. Mach B. Reith W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6375-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) for in vitro transcription-translation (IVT) of RFX1 protein was provided by P. Hearing and W. Reith. RFX1 mRNA was synthesized using HindIII-digested plasmid as template, and then translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Binding assays were performed under conditions similar to those described above with the addition of 5 μg of bovine serum albumin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to each reaction. Transient transfection assays were performed in ATCC HeLa cells (passage 6–13) as described previously (18Morris G.F. Mathews M.B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6397-6406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, duplicate cultures at 40–50% confluence were transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique (31Wigler M. Pellicer A. Silverstein S. Axel R. Cell. 1978; 14: 725-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, each 6-cm plate received a total of 20 μg of DNA including 10 μg of reporter constructs, 0.5 μg of either pCMV12S or pCMV12S.FS, 0.5 μg of pCMV19K, 1 μg of pCMVβ-gal or pCH110 as a control for transfection efficiency, and salmon sperm carrier DNA. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and fresh medium added 16 h after the transfection. Cells were harvested 48 h after the transfection. Cell extracts were prepared by freezing and thawing cells in 0.25 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assays were performed so that they yielded values within the linear range of the assay. Usually, up to 50 μl of the cell extracts were added to the reaction in CAT assay. Thin-layer chromatograms were quantified with a Betascan System (AMBIS, San Diego, CA), and CAT activity was expressed as the percentage of chloramphenicol acetylated by 50 μl of cell extract incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (32Herbomel P. Bourachot B. Yaniv M. Cell. 1984; 39: 653-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), and β-galactosidase activity was expressed as the optical density at 420 nm obtained with 50 μl of extract incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. CAT activity was normalized to the levels of β-galactosidase activity and is expressed as the mean ± S.D. relative to the level of CAT activity obtained by cotransfection of wild-type PCNA-CAT with pCMV 12S.FS. We showed previously that an oligonucleotide probe comprising sequences from −60 to −40 of the human PCNA promoter (thus encompassing the PERE site from −59 to −45) forms three principal complexes, P1–P3, with proteins from HeLa nuclear extracts in an EMSA assay (Fig.1 A, lane 1). The formation of complexes P2 and P3 is dependent upon an ATF/CREB consensus site contained at the 3′ end of the PERE between nucleotides −52 and −45 (21Labrie C. Lee B.H. Mathews M.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3732-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and these complexes contain the ATF-1 and CREB cellular proteins (21Labrie C. Lee B.H. Mathews M.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3732-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 22Lee B.H. Mathews M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4481-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Transcription factor RFX1 is a component of complex P1, and its binding to the PCNA promoter appeared to be dependent upon sequences overlapping the ATF/CREB consensus motif and extending immediately downstream of the PERE to position −40 of the promoter (21Labrie C. Lee B.H. Mathews M.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3732-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Consistent with the PERE's importance in PCNA promoter function, there is a considerable degree of conservation of PERE sequences among the human (28Morris G.F. Mathews M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16116-16125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Travali S. Ku D.-H. Rizzo M.G. Ottavio L. Baserga R. Calabretta B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7466-7472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rat (34Ohashi Y. Sawada Y. Moriuchi T. Fujinaga K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and mouse (35Yamaguchi M. Hayashi Y. Hirose F. Matsuoka S. Moriuchi T. Shiroishi T. Moriwaki K. Matsukage A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2403-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) PCNA promoters (Fig. 1 B). As noted previously (19Labrie C. Morris G.F. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1697-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the homology extends both upstream and downstream of the ATF/CREB consensus site. To determine whether complexes could also form with PERE sequences from these other mammalian PCNA promoters, we repeated the EMSA with rat and mouse probes. Fig. 1 A shows that the three probes all formed complexes P1, P2, and P3, although complex P1 formation was considerably weaker with the rat PERE probe (lanes 1, 4, and 7). In all cases, antibody to RFX1 caused a supershift of the P1 complex whereas normal rabbit serum was without effect (compare lanes 3,6, and 9 with lanes 2,5, and 8). Inspection of sequences within and directly downstream of the human PERE revealed a good match of the nucleotides located between positions −53 and −41 of the human PCNA promoter with a recently published RFX1 consensus binding site (Fig.2 A). This consensus sequence consists of two somewhat degenerate half-sites, 5′-GTNRCC/N-3′ and 5′-RGYAAC-3′, forming an imperfect palindrome usually separated by one or two nucleotides (36Emery P. Strubin M. Hofmann K. Bucher P. Mach B. Reith W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4486-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Similar matching sequences are present in the equivalent positions of the rat and mouse PCNA genes (Fig.2 A), although the three sequences are not identical over this region. There is no obvious relationship between their conformity to the consensus RFX1 site and the intensity of P1 complex formation by each species, however. This disparity is not surprising in view of the degeneracy of the consensus sequence. Nevertheless, these observations suggest that variations in complex P1 stability are due to discrete nucleotide changes in the RFX1 binding site. Analysis of the binding of RFX1 to the PERE is complicated because the ATF/CREB binding site is completely contained within the RFX1 consensus motif (Fig. 2 B). To differentiate between the actions of these two proteins on the PCNA promoter, we assessed the effects of mutating particular nucleotides (Fig.2 B) on the formation of the RFX1-containing protein complex, P1, in vitro. These experiments were conducted with two forms of the PERE probe: the PERE(L) probes are longer than the PERE(S) probes, which contain sequences from −60 to −40 of the PCNA promoter, by virtue of the addition of 10 nucleotides at the upstream end. Extending the length of the DNA probe increased the stability of complex P1 without greatly affecting complexes P2 and P3 (Fig.3; compare lanes 5and 1). The precise composition of the 10 extra nucleotides appeared to be inconsequential, as the P1 band was intensified regardless of whether the extension was composed of wild-type or mutant PCNA sequences (data not shown). Because linker-scanning mutations between −70 and −60 do not affect either basal or E1A-transactivated expression from the PCNA promoter (19Labrie C. Morris G.F. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1697-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the PERE(L) probe used here contained a 10-base pair sequence devised by combining the mutated nucleotides of several linker-scanning mutations studied previously in PCNA-CAT reporter constructs (19Labrie C. Morris G.F. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1697-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) in an attempt to exclude possible nonspecific interactions between these longer EMSA probes and proteins from HeLa cell nuclear extract. Consistent with previous observations (21Labrie C. Lee B.H. Mathews M.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3732-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the clustered point mutations between nucleotides −44 and −40, which drastically change the downstream RFX1 half-site (in this case, 5′-CGCAAC-3′), diminished formation of P1 but not of P2 or P3 (Fig. 3; compare lane 6 with lane 5). Mutation of nucleotides between −50 and −47, which comprise the core of both the ATF site, not only abolished complexes P2 and P3 as expected, but also abrogated P1 complex formation (ATF-BAM, lane 7). This suggests that the formation of the P1 complex depends on the integrity of the upstream RFX1 half-site (in this case 5′-GTGACG-3′) as well as the downstream half-site. The −50/−40 mutation, which affects both RFX1 half-sites in addition to the ATF site, also eliminated all three bands (lane 8). On the other hand, several upstream mutations appeared to stabilize the P1 complex. The P1 band, which was barely detectable with the wild-type PERE(S) probe (lane 1), was dramatically intensified by a point mutation at position −53 (a G to T substitution) located at the 5′ border of the RFX1 consensus site (−53GT, lane 2). The −53GT mutation also diminished the formation of complexes P2 and P3 slightly, although it lies just outside the ATF/CREB consensus site. The intensity of the P1 band also increased, albeit less strikingly, when the PERE(S) mutant oligonucleotide −59/−56 was used as probe (lane 3). This observation was confirmed in the context of the PERE(L) probe; the clustered mutations between −56 and −59 appreciably increased the intensity of the P1 band without affecting P2 and P3 (compare lane 10 with lane 5). A similar result was obtained with a single G to A point mutation at position −56 (lane 9). These data imply that nucleotide sequences at or near the 5′ boundary of the RFX1 consensus binding site contribute to the DNA binding properties of RFX1; mutation of these nucleotides strengthens P1 complex formation, while other mutations in the RFX1 site destabilize the complex. To evaluate the influence of RFX1 binding on basal and E1A-induced PCNA promoter activity, we cotransfected PCNA-CAT reporter constructs harboring these single or clustered promoter mutations into HeLa cells with a plasmid expressing wild-type E1A 243R protein (pCMV12S) or, as a control, with a plasmid expressing an inactive, truncated E1A protein (pCMV12S.FS). The resultant CAT activity was compared with that generated by the wild-type PCNA-87 CAT reporter. Consistent with previous results (19Labrie C. Morris G.F. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1697-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the −59/−56, −56GA, and −53GT mutations reduced E1A-induced PCNA promoter activity by about 3-fold (Fig.4). These mutations also lowered basal transcription by about 2-fold. In contrast, the two downstream mutations, −44/−40 and −46/−39, elevated both basal and E1A 243R-induced promoter activity by 30–40%. These results indicate an inverse relationship between PCNA promoter activity and the stability of complex P1; mutations that stabilized the P1 complex (−53GT, −56GA, and −59/−56) reduced basal and E1A-induced transcriptional activity, whereas mutations that abrogated complex P1 (−44/−40 and −46/−39) accentuated PCNA promoter activity (see TableI).Table IComparison of gel mobility shift results and promoter activitiesMutantElectrophoretic mobility shift assayPromoter activityHeLa nuclear extractIVT-RFX1+ E1A 12SControlP1 complexP2/P3 complexRFX1 complexWild-type00000−46/−39−0−+0−44/−40−0−++−40/−50−−−− −aThe promoter activity of the −87 PCNA-CAT mutant −40/−50 was inferred from previous results (19).− −aThe promoter activity of the −87 PCNA-CAT mutant −40/−50 was inferred from previous results (19).ATF-Bam−−−− −− −−53GT++−++−−−56GA+0+−−−59/−56+0+−−Table shows changes relative to data obtained with the wild-type PCNA promoter: 0, no change; +, increase; ++, large increase; −, decrease; − −, large decrease.a The promoter activity of the −87 PCNA-CAT mutant −40/−50 was inferred from previous results (19Labrie C.

Open table in a new tab Table shows changes relative to data obtained with the wild-type PCNA promoter: 0, no change; +, increase; ++, large increase; −, decrease; − −, large decrease. The foregoing discussion has assumed that changes in the level of complex P1 are determined by the stability of RFX1 binding. To validate this assumption, we examined the effects of mutations introduced into the PCNA promoter on the binding of RFX1 protein synthesized in vitro (IVT RFX1). With the PERE(S) and (L) probes, unprogrammed rabbit reticulocyte lysate formed nonspecific complexes and faint bands with mobilities similar to those of P2 and P3 (Fig. 5, A and B,lanes 2), but did not give rise to complex P1 formed with HeLa nuclear extract (Fig. 5, A andB, lanes 1). The weak complex formed by IVT RFX1 with the wild-type PERE(S) probe migrated with P1 and was dramatically intensified with PERE(S) variants harboring upstream mutations (compare Fig. 5 A, lanes 6and 7 with lane 3). This behavior confirms observations made with HeLa nuclear extract (Fig. 3) and clearly illustrates the effect of the clustered mutations between −59 and −56 (−59/−56) as well as the point mutation at position −53 (−53GT). Complex formation with IVT RFX1 protein was also accentuated by using the extended wild-type PERE(L) probe (compare Fig. 5 B,lane 3, to Fig. 5 A, lane 3). Mutations of this probe that alter nucleotides in the RFX1 consensus site, namely −44/−40, ATF-BAM, and −50/−40, abrogated the ability of IVT RFX1 to bind to the DNA probe (Fig.5 B, lanes 6–8), while the −56GA mutation increased IVT RFX1 protein binding (Fig. 5 B,lane 9). Evidently, probe mutations that affected the stability of complex P1 formed in HeLa nuclear extract (Fig. 3) all exerted corresponding effects on IVT RFX1 protein binding (Fig. 5; see Table I). Finally, antibody interference experiments were performed to determine whether the increased intensity of complex P1 brought about by alterations in the PERE probe is due solely to the formation of more RFX1-containing complexes (Fig. 6). HeLa cell nuclear extract was preincubated with anti-RFX1 polyclonal antibody (lanes 2, 3, and5), and EMSA was performed with the PERE(L) probe (lanes 1–3) or the −53GT probe (lanes 4 and 5). In both cases, the P1 complex was completely supershifted by anti-RFX1 antibody but no changes in P2 and P3 were observed. Thus, the increased formation of complex P1 observed with these probes is attributable to the increased binding of RFX1. These data, taken together with the comigration of complex P1 formed with nuclear extract and IVT RFX1, support the conclusion that complex P1 consists chiefly, if not solely, of RFX1 protein. Previous work demonstrated that the RFX1 transcription factor associates with the PCNA promoter (21Labrie C. Lee B.H. Mathews M.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3732-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), but the biological role of RFX1 in the regulation of PCNA expression, if any, remained to be established. Here we show that the RFX1 binding site is conserved in mammals, and that RFX1 binding to the PERE correlates inversely with transcription from the PCNA promoter. To address the role of RFX1, we designed a series of mutations surrounding the PERE ATF/CREB site and examined their effects on RFX1 binding and on the basal and E1A-activated expression of the PCNA promoter. As summarized in Table I, the mutations exhibited differential effects on complex P1 formation and RFX1 binding depending on their location. Clustered mutations in the downstream RFX1 half-site reduced P1 complex formation and RFX1 binding, as expected. More surprisingly, mutations at the upstream border of the upstream RFX1 half-site and further upstream had the opposite effect, and extending the length of the PERE at its 5′ border also increased P1 complex formation and RFX1 binding. One possible explanation for this finding is that RFX1 binding and P1 complex formation are stabilized by an unidentified protein that binds in this region. However, this possibility is unlikely in view of the nature of the mutations that give the effect. An alternative explanation is that the upstream region influences binding indirectly, perhaps through a change in the local conformation of the DNA. Despite this mechanistic uncertainty, the mutations provide compelling evidence that RFX1 plays a role in regulating the activity of the PCNA promoter. Transient expression assays revealed an inverse correlation between complex P1/RFX1 binding and PCNA promoter expression (see TableI). This inverse relationship held with both upstream and downstream mutations and for basal and E1A 243R-induced expression. The consistent inverse relationship between RFX1 binding and PCNA promoter activity implies that the RFX1 protein complex P1 plays an inhibitory role in the regulation of human PCNA gene expression, both in the absence and presence of E1A. Judging from the EMSA data obtained with rodent PERE sequences, it is likely that similar controls are exerted over the mouse PCNA gene but possibly not over its homologue in the rat, presenting a potentially interesting case of species-specific PCNA transcriptional regulation. RFX1 is a 130-kDa protein that belongs to a novel family of homodimeric and heterodimeric DNA-binding proteins (RFX1–RFX5) and contains a highly conserved DNA binding domain (37Emery P. Durand B. Mach B. Reith W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The RFX proteins function in diverse and unrelated systems (37Emery P. Durand B. Mach B. Reith W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar); while the RFX1 binding site functions as a positive element required for the transcriptional activities of both the major histocompatibility complex class II and HBV genes (23Siegrist C.A. Durand B. Emery P. David E. Hearing P. Mach B. Reith W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6375-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 24Reith W. Herrero-Sanchez C. Kobr M. Silacci P. Berte C. Barras E. Fey S. Mach B. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1528-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), RFX1 has been suggested to play an inhibitory role in other systems. Thus, RFX1 is part of a complex that binds to the MIF-1 binding site, an element which has high homology with the RFX1 consensus sequence (12 out of 13 base pairs) and can function as a transcriptional silencer in both hepatocarcinoma HepG2 and HeLa cell lines (25Reinhold W. Emens L. Itkes A. Blake M. Ichinose I. Zajac-Kaye M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3041-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the MIF-1 regulatory element has been identified in the intron I region of the c-myc gene, and mutation of the MIF-1 site, which abolishes MIF-1 binding activity, also results in the up-regulation of c-myc gene expression (38Zajac-Kaye M. Gelmann E.P. Levens D. Science. 1988; 240: 1776-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Taken together, the data suggest that the MIF-1 site and presumably its binding protein RFX1 may function to negatively regulate c-myc gene expression as we now propose in the case of the human PCNA promoter. Moreover, dissection of RFX1 has revealed that it is a dual-function regulator, possessing domains with intrinsic transcriptional activation and silencing properties (26Katan Y. Agami R. Shaul Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3621-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although these two domains effectively counteract one another in the intact molecule, resulting in transcriptional near-neutrality, it is possible that contextual signals can shift the balance toward activation or repression. The lack of obvious correspondence between the departures of the rodent sequences from the consensus RFX1 site and their abilities to form RFX1-containing complexes, implies that subtle contextual changes may have profound functional consequences. In the PCNA promoter, the RFX1-binding site surrounds and overlaps the ATF/CREB binding site. The nature of the interplay between these two sites and their cognate factors remains to be established, however. For example, it is not clear whether the two types of DNA-binding proteins can co-occupy the PERE or, alternatively, compete with one another for occupancy. To date, we have not detected a complex that contains them both, arguing that there is no strongly cooperative binding interaction, but this conclusion must be taken with caution as EMSA was conducted in conditions of DNA excess. One mechanism by which E1A 243R can target and transactivate the PCNA promoter at the PERE site is via its interaction with CBP and CREB (22Lee B.H. Mathews M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4481-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Mutation of the PERE ATF/CREB site completely abrogates both basal and E1A-induction of the PCNA promoter, presumably by interrupting this CBP-CREB-DNA pathway. The requirement for PERE sequences upstream of the ATF/CREB site (from −59 to −53) for optimal E1A induction of the PCNA promoter in vivo (19Labrie C. Morris G.F. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1697-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21Labrie C. Lee B.H. Mathews M.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3732-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) can now be explained in terms of RFX1 binding. Results presented here show that these upstream sequences, as well as those immediately downstream, influence the interactions of RFX1 with the PCNA promoter. Because the stability of complex P1 correlates with lower transcriptional activity of the PCNA promoter, we infer that the human PCNA promoter is subject to negative regulation by RFX1. Although the magnitude of this modulation is not dramatic, at least in the model system studied here, recent data suggest that repression by RFX1 can also be relieved by E1A 243R through its interaction with the retinoblastoma-like tumor suppressor protein p107, which also associates with the PCNA promoter (27Lee B.H. Liu M. Mathews M.B. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1138-1145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We conclude that RFX1 participates in a complex transcriptional regulatory mechanism, involving DNA elements contained within this region of the PCNA promoter together with their cognate binding proteins, to control this essential DNA replication factor.

To elucidate a possible interaction between Fas-mediated apoptotic signals and activation-related protective signals, we investigated the impact of Fas ligation on PKC activity. We demonstrate that engagement of Fas on human lymphoid Jurkat cells triggered apoptosis, and Fas ligation resulted in partial blockade of cellular PKC activity. The phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-mediated translocation of PKCθ from the cytoplasm to the membrane was inhibited by treatment with anti-Fas antibody, whereas the translocation of PKCα or ε was not affected.In vitro kinase assay of PKCα or ε phosphotransferase activity demonstrated that Fas ligation inhibited the ability of PKCα to phosphorylate histone H1 as substrate but did not inhibit ε isozyme activity. This inhibition of PKCα activity mediated by Fas ligation was reversed by okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor, suggesting the involvement of a member of the protein phosphatase 2A subfamily in this component of Fas signaling. Identical patterns of PKC isozyme inhibition were obtained using mouse thymoma cells overexpressing the fas gene (LF(+)). These results suggest that the selective inhibition of a potentially protective, PKC-mediated pathway by Fas activation may, to some extent, contribute to Fas-induced apoptotic signaling.

Thus, Fas/APO-1-induced apoptosis is required for the maintenance of at least two immunological processesin vivo: the normal elimination of potentially autoreactive peripheral T cells and calcium-independent T cell cytotoxicity (6Rouvier E.

This ceramide-activated protein phosphatase (CAPP) 1The abbreviations used are: CAPP, ceramide-activated protein phosphatase; PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; Ab, antibody is a cytosolic enzyme and has been implicated as a specific mediator of ceramide action. CAPP is very sensitive to low concentrations of okadaic acid and therefore belongs to the heterotrimeric subfamily of the protein phosphatase 2A group. Although CAPP has been demonstrated to mediate some of the cellular actions of ceramide, the link between ceramide-induced phosphatase activation and subsequent intracellular events is still not clear. Protein kinase C (PKC) has been implicated as one of the critical components of multiple signaling pathways, including T cell activation processes (28Genot E.M. Parker P.J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol.

The differential expression of PKC isotypes in mammalian tissues and the different substrate specificities of different PKCs indicate that distinct PKC isotypes may have precise cellular localizations and substrate preferences. T cells express at least seven different isotypes of PKC: α, β1, δ, ε, η, θ, and ζ. PKC isotypes are regulated by phosphorylation and binding of various cofactors. Upon activation, the enzyme is redistributed among different cellular compartments (35Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 36Nishizuka Y.

PKC inhibitors have been shown to block phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and lead to apoptosis, whereas activation of PKC induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and abolished the apoptotic process (44Gubina E.

In human U-937 myeloid leukemia cells, PKCθ is cleaved in the third variable region by caspase-3 during apoptosis induced by various agents, and overexpression of cleaved PKCθ fragment resulted in cell death (47Datta R.

Furthermore, cleavage of another isoform, PKCδ, by caspase-3-cysteine protease caused cells to undergo apoptosis, whereas overexpression of the anti-apoptotic factors Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL blocked the cleavage of PKCδ (44Gubina E.

Ligation of Fas significantly suppresses TcR/CD3 complex-mediated early signal transduction events, including inhibition of TcR/CD3-triggered tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins (50Kovacs B. Tsokos G.C. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5543-5549PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Fas engagement may attenuate T cell activation events, whereas T cell activation-related events, such as activation of PKC, may reciprocally protect cells against apoptosis. This opportunity for cross-talk between signaling pathways led us to examine the potential interrelationship between these two seemingly opposing processes: apoptosis and activation. Here, we demonstrate that engagement of Fas triggers the apoptotic process in human Jurkat and mouse thymoma cells stably expressing the fas gene (LF(+)) but not in mouse thymoma cells stably transfected with antisensefas gene (LF(−)). Fas ligation selectively inhibits the activation of different isotypes of PKC in both Jurkat and LF(+) cells. The translocation of PKCθ in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation is inhibited by prior Fas ligation. PKCα-mediated phosphorylation of histone H1 is blocked by prior Fas activation. This inhibition of PKC activity by Fas activation could be prevented by pretreatment with okadaic acid, indicating an involvement of a protein phosphatase in Fas signaling. The activity of PKCε was not affected by Fas stimulation. Therefore, these data suggest that the integration of multiple pro- and anti-apoptotic signals resulting from Fas activation may be required to execute the apoptotic program successfully. The human lymphoblastoid cell line Jurkat (American Tissue Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated newborn calf serum (Hazelton Research Products, Inc., Lenexa, KA), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. LF1210 mouse thymoma cells were transfected with the fas gene (]LF(+)) or an antisensefas gene (LF(−)) (generous gifts from Dr. S.-T. Ju, Boston University) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated newborn calf serum plus 0.7 mg/ml Geneticin. Jurkat, LF(+), or LF(−) cells (0.5 × 106 cells/ml) were cultured in six-well plates with 5 ml of medium containing 10% newborn calf serum plus 1.5 μg/ml anti-human Fas Ab (Pan Vera Corp., Madison, WI) for Jurkat and PH1 cells or 1.5 μg/ml IgM Ab as control. The mouse thymoma cells (LF) were cultured under the same conditions with the addition of 5 μg/ml mouse anti-mouse Fas Ab (Pharmingen, San Diego). Cells were collected at the time points indicated and enumerated using trypan blue dye exclusion to assess viability. Error bars represent the S.D. over five independent experiments. The cells (1 × 106/ml) were cultured with 1.5 μg/ml anti-human Fas Ab for 12 h and resuspended in 1 ml of 1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 μg of propidium iodide, and 10 μl of RNase (1 mg/ml). The stained samples were kept in the dark at 4 °C overnight before DNA fragmentation analysis by FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Human and mouse cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were cultured in five replicate wells of a six-well plate with 10 ml of medium containing 1.5 μg/ml anti-human Fas Ab or 5 μg/ml anti-mouse Fas Ab for 60 min and subsequently treated with 100 nm PMA for 15 min. For single stimulation experiments, the cells were exposed to either anti-Fas Ab or PMA alone for 60 or 15 min, respectively. For PKC enzyme activity inhibitor experiments, cells were exposed to PMA for 15 min after the addition of 0.1 μm staurosporine for 15 min. After lysing the cells in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl (9Takahashi T. Tanaka M. Brannan C.I. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Suda T. Nagata S. Cell. 1994; 76: 969-976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar), the lysates were normalized for protein concentration, and 150-μg aliquots of protein were analyzed for PKC activity using a PKC assay kit containing a specific substrate peptide for PKC and an inhibitor mixture that blocks the activity of PKA and calmodulin kinase (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Subsequently, the32P-incorporating substrate from each treatment was separated from the residual [32P]ATP using p81 phosphocellulose paper, and the radioactivity incorporated into the substrate was measured by scintillation counting. Cells (50 × 106), following the different treatments described above, were washed twice with 1 × phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) (39Meller N. Liu Y.-C. Collins T.L. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Baier G. Isakov N. Altman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5782-5791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cell suspensions were transferred to a 1-ml syringe and sheared by being passed 40 times through 25-gauge needle. The lysates were centrifuged at 280 × g for 10 min to precipitate nuclei, and the supernatants were collected. One-third of the whole cell extract was saved, and the remainder was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant (cytosol) was collected, and the pellet was washed in buffer B containing 1% Nonidet P-40 for 1 h on ice and centrifuged again at 16,000 ×g. The supernatant representing the membrane fraction was saved. Each fraction (whole cell lysate, cytosol fraction, and membrane fraction) was normalized and separated on 8% of acrylamide gel. Subsequently the gel was immunoblotted with the anti-mouse (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or human (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) PKC Abs, which recognize the isoforms of PKCθ, α, and ε. The blot was developed with an anti-mouse Ig alkaline phosphatase reagent (Oncogene Science, Uniondale, NY). The cells (20 × 106) were incubated with PMA at 100 nm for 15 min prior to 60 min of exposure to anti-Fas Abs. For phosphatase inhibitor experiments, okadaic acid was added to a final concentration of 50 nm 15 min before the next treatments. The cell lysates were then prepared with the lysis buffer (150 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (27Lee J.Y. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13169-13174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The lysates were normalized for protein concentration, and each sample (containing approximately 500 μg of protein) was immunoprecipitated with the corresponding anti-PKC Ab and collected by absorption to protein A-Sepharose. The immunocomplexes bound to protein A-Sepharose were washed with lysis buffer twice and kinase buffer twice (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Subsequently, the immunocomplexes bound to the beads were resuspended in reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μm cold ATP, 0.4 mg/ml histone H1, 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol)) and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of protein loading buffer. Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the gel was subjected to autoradiography. Jurkat cells express a significant amount of Fas antigen on their surfaces (51Chen C.-Y. Liou J. Forman L.W. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16700-16709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of these cells to treatment with anti-Fas Ab was examined in medium containing 10% serum (Fig.1 a). The number of viable Jurkat cells did not begin to decline until 5 h after exposure to the Ab, and the death proportion of dead cells increased steadily from that time on. By 24 h, approximately 65% of the Jurkat cells lost viability. Exposure to an unrelated, isotype-matched (IgM) antibody did not induce cell death in Jurkat cells; rather, the numbers of cells started to increase 6 h after the addition of the unrelated Ab, reflecting normal cell growth. The cell death observed was caused by apoptosis, as confirmed by cytofluorometric analysis of nuclear DNA fragmentation, as described previously (Fig. 1 b). The percentage of cells with fragmented DNA 15 h after the addition of anti-Fas Ab was more than 20%, and by 24 h more than 30% of the cells contained fragmented DNA. This time course of apoptosis was also confirmed by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay (data not shown). We demonstrated previously that down-regulation or inhibition of PKC could induce Jurkat cells expressing oncogenic ras to undergo apoptosis and that Fas-mediated signals may be involved in this apoptotic process (51Chen C.-Y.

The involvement of these common messengers in signaling pathways with disparate outcomes, cell activation or cell death, suggested that these opposing pathways may interfere with each other or utilize cross-talk to facilitate execution of their respective end points.

Genetic experiments have identified functional domains within the terminase subunits. An N-terminal domain of gpNu1 contains a putative helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif identified by sequence homology ((15) A. Becker, cited in Ref. 7Feiss M.

Our laboratories are interested in the genetic, biochemical, and biophysical properties of DNA packaging in phage λ and, in particular, the nucleoprotein complexes involved in these processes. These studies require a quick, simple, and efficient method to purify large quantities of protein, especially for the biophysical studies of the holoenzyme and its subunits. Toward this end, we have constructed hexahistidine (hexa-His)-tagged protein subunits and have developed simple, one-step protocols for the purification of phage λ terminase holoenzyme and the isolated enzyme subunits. Whereas these types of constructs are extremely useful for the rapid purification of protein, the purification tags unavoidably alter the primary sequence of the protein, even with “cleavable” purification tags where one or two amino acids remain after removal of the tag. It is thus imperative that the functional significance of these “minor” changes in protein structure be clearly defined prior to utilization of the constructs for detailed structural and mechanistic studies. We have therefore examined the effect of these hexahistidine tags on the catalytic competence of terminase holoenzyme and the isolated enzyme subunits. Tryptone, yeast extract, and agar were purchased from Difco. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Promega. Mung bean nuclease was purchased from New England Biolabs. Guanidinium hydrochloride was purchased from Mallinckrodt. [α-32P]ATP was purchased from ICN. Unlabeled nucleoside triphosphates and ampicillin were purchased from Sigma. Ni-NTA-agarose was purchased from Qiagen. All other materials were of the highest quality commercially available. Bacterial cultures were grown in shaker flasks utilizing a New Brunswick Scientific series 25 incubator-shaker. Bacterial growth media and agar were prepared as described by Sambrook and co-workers (24Maniatis T. Firtsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 440-443Google Scholar). When required, kanamycin and ampicillin were added at 50 and 100 μg/ml, respectively. UV-VIS absorbance spectra were recorded on a Hewlett-Packard HP8452A spectrophotometer. Automated DNA sequence analysis was performed by the University of Colorado Cancer Center Macromolecular Resources Core facility or by the DNA sequencing facility at the University of Iowa. Both strands of the duplex were examined to verify the expected DNA sequence. The viral and bacterial strains and the plasmids used in these studies are shown in Table I. Plasmids pSF1 and pAFP1 were purified from the Escherichia coli strains C600[pSF1] (25Feiss M. Siegele D.A. Rudolph C.F. Frackman M.

Synthetic oligonucleotides used in this study were purchased from either Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., or Life Technologies, Inc., and were used without further purification. Purification of wild-type terminase holoenzyme and the isolated wild-type gpA and gpNu1 subunits was performed as described previously (6Tomka M.A. Catalano C.E. J. Biol.

Feiss M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 126-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). pASY20 thus contains the wild-type λ sequence for the A gene (3′ end), except for an XbaI site introduced at bp 2628 (Fig. 2) (29Yeo A. Feiss M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 126-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The forward PCR primer was complementary to bp 2206–2229 in theA gene sequence and contained the SphI site. The reverse PCR primer was complementary to bp 2615–2638 in theA gene sequence, except that the TCC Ser codon at bp 2619–2621 (Ser-637, Fig. 2) was changed to an AGC. This introduced anAflII site at bp 2615 in the A sequence but maintained a wild-type serine codon. PCR amplification yielded the expected 412-bp fragment that was isolated, digested withSphI and XbaI, and ligated into similarly digested pASY20. This afforded the plasmid pASY30 which was identical to pASY20 except for the AflII site introduced at bp 2615. pASY30 was cut with AflII, and the cohesive ends were removed by digestion with mung bean nuclease. The linearized plasmid was next digested with BspEI (bp 3329) which deleted a 714-bp AflII-BspEI fragment (Fig. 2). The following synthetic duplex 1 was ligated into doubly digested pASY30.TTA TCT GGA GAG GAT GAA CAC CAT CAC CAT CAC CATTGATAAT AGA CCT CTC CTA CTT GTG GTA GTG GTA GTG GTAACTAGGCCTLeu Ser Gly Glu Asp Glu His His His His His HisstopDUPLEX1where the BspEI restriction site is indicated in italics. The resulting plasmid, pQH70, contains the 3′ end of theA gene (bp 2633) with six histidine codons appended but is deleted for the BspEI segment between the sites at bp 2637 and 3329 of pASY20 (Fig. 2). To replace this missing plasmid DNA, pASY20 was digested with BspEI, and the 692-bp fragment was cloned into BspEI-linearized pQH70. The resulting plasmid was digested with Sse83871 (Panvera), and the 263-bp fragment containing the modified segment of the A gene (see Fig. 2) was ligated into the corresponding Sse83871 site of the terminase expression vector pCM101 (30Chow S. Daub E. Murialdo H. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 60: 277-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) yielding the hexa-His terminase holoenzyme expression plasmid pQH101. The sequence from theSphI site at 2216 to the end of the A gene was found to be as predicted from the manipulations. We note that protein expression in this cell line is heat-inducible. A lysogen that expresses hexa-His terminase (λ–P1A hexa-His) in place of the wild-type holoenzyme terminase was constructed as follows. The Sse83871 restriction segment extending from λ bp 2561 to 2824 (see Fig. 2) and containing the modified segment of A gene (see above) was cloned into the corresponding Sse83871 sites of pJM1 yielding pJM1-hexa-His. pJM1 is a derivative of pBR322 containing λ DNA extending from bp 44141 through cos to 5505 (Table I). This 9-kilobase sequence includes the late promotor pR′, the lysis genes S, R, and Rz, cos, the terminase genesNu1 and A, and genes W andB. To cross the hexa-His modification of the Agene into phage λ, pJM1-hexa-His was crossed with λ-P1Aam42. Aam42 is an amber mutation in the fifth-to-last codon of the A gene which renders the terminase enzyme inactive (19Sippy J. Feiss M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 850-856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids carrying wild-type (pJM1) and hexa-His-modified (pJM1-hexa-His) A genes were transformed into MF1427 (λ-P1 Aam42) yielding the lysogens MF1427 (λ-P1 A wild-type) and MF1427 (λ-P1A hexa-His), respectively. Selection for transformed lysogens was accomplished by plating at 31 °C on L agar plates containing kanamycin and ampicillin. The transformed lysogens were grown overnight in L broth plus antibiotics at 31 °C. Prophages were induced to undergo lytic growth by incubation at 42 °C for 20 min followed by incubation at 37 °C for 60 min. The lysates were treated with CHCl3 and plated on MF1427 to titer the λ–P1 A wild-type and λ–P1A hexa-His recombinant phages. A vector that overexpresses the terminase gpA subunit with six histidines fused to the natural C-terminal glutamic acid (see Fig. 2) was constructed by PCR methods previously described (27Meyer J.D. Hanagan A. Manning M.C. Catalano C.E. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 23: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The plasmid pSF1 contains wild-type Nu1 and A genes cloned into a pBR322 background (Table I) and was used as a PCR template. The forward primer contained an EcoRI site and was complementary to the first 21 nucleotides of the A gene, except that the GUG initiation codon in A was changed to an AUG codon with the use of the PCR primer. The reverse primer contained a BamHI site, six histidine codons, and the penultimate 18 nucleotides of the A gene. A vector that overexpresses the terminase gpNu1 subunit containing a methionine initiation codon and six histidines fused to the natural N-terminal (initiation) methionine (see Fig. 2) was similarly constructed. The primer sequences used were as follows: gpA forward primer, 5′-GAA TTC ATG AAT ATA TCG AAC AGT CAG-3′; gpA-hexa-His reverse primer, 5′-GGA TCC TCA ATG GTG ATG GTG ATG GTGTTC ATC CTC TCC GAA TAA-3′; hexa-His-gpNu1 forward primer, 5′-GAA TTC ATG CAC CAT CAC CAT CAC CATATG GAA GTC AAC AAA AAG-3′; gpNu1 reverse primer, 5′-GGA TCC TTA ACC TGA CTG TTC GAT ATA-3′. The EcoRI and BamHI restriction sequences are indicated in italics, and the f-MET (forward primers) and stop (reverse primers) codons are shown in bold type. Sequences complementary to the terminase genes are underlined, and the hexa-His codons are double underlined. PCR amplification of theA and Nu1 genes and construction of BL21(DE3)[pH6-A] and BL21(DE3)[pH6-Nu1], the gpA-hexa-His and hexa-His-gpNu1 expressing cell lines, respectively, were performed as described by Meyer et al. (27Meyer J.D. Hanagan A. Manning M.C. Catalano C.E. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 23: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We note that protein expression in these cell lines is inducible with IPTG. One liter of 2× YT media containing 25 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.2, 1% glucose, and 50 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with a 10-ml overnight culture of E. coli OR1265[pQH101] and maintained at 30 °C until an optical density of 0.6 (600 nm) was obtained. The cells were then heat-induced and harvested as described previously for wild-type holoenzyme (6Tomka M.A. Catalano C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3056-3065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 500 mm NaCl, 1 mmPMSF, 0.4 mg/ml lysozyme, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and placed on ice for 20 min. The cells were then lysed by sonication, and the insoluble cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (12,000 ×g for 15 min, followed by 12,000 × g for 30 min). The clarified supernatant was mixed with 5 ml of Ni-NTA agarose followed by gentle shaking on ice for 1 h. The mixture was loaded into an empty column and unbound protein was eluted with 2 × 4-ml aliquots of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8, containing 500 mm NaCl. Bound protein was eluted in a stepwise fashion with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 500 mm NaCl and increasing concentrations of imidazole (4 × 0.5 ml each, 100, 150, and 250 mm imidazole). Hexa-His terminase holoenzyme eluted in the 250 mm imidazole fractions that were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm EDTA, 7 mm β-ME, and 50% glycerol. The purified protein sample was stored at −70 °C. One liter of 2× YT media containing 25 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.2, 1% glucose, and 50 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with a 10-ml overnight culture of E. coli BL21(DE3)[pH6-A] cells, and the culture was maintained at 37 °C until an optical density of 0.6 (600 nm) was obtained. The cells were then induced with the addition of IPTG to 1.2 mm, and the culture was maintained at 37 °C for an additional 2 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 7 mm β-ME. Cell lysis was affected as described above for hexa-His terminase holoenzyme, and the clarified supernatant was dialyzed against 50 mmNaH2PO4 buffer, pH 8.0, containing 500 mm NaCl and 25 mm imidazole. Five milliliters of Ni-NTA agarose was added to the protein solution, and the mixture was shaken gently on ice for 1 h. The mixture was then loaded into an empty column, and the unbound protein was eluted with 2 × 4-ml aliquots of 50 mm NaH2PO4 buffer, pH 8.0, containing 500 mm NaCl and 50 mmimidazole. gpA-hexa-His was finally eluted with 7 × 0.5-ml aliquots of 50 mm NaH2PO4 buffer, pH 8.0, containing 500 mm NaCl and 250 mmimidazole. The elution fractions were examined by SDS-PAGE, and the appropriate fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 100 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 7 mm β-ME, and 50% glycerol. The purified protein sample was stored at −70 °C. Growth and induction of E. coli BL21(DE3)[pH6-Nu1] cells was performed as described above for gpA-hexa-His; however, similar to the wild-type gpNu1 (27Meyer J.D. Hanagan A. Manning M.C. Catalano C.E.

The washed pellet was next solubilized with 20 ml of 6 m guanidinium HCl (GdmHCl), pH 8.0, gently shaken on ice for 1 h, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 30 min).

Recently, we showed that isolated A2 subunit enhanced the k cat for factor IXa-catalyzed activation of factor X by ∼100-fold (∼1 min−1), whereas isolated A1 or A3-C1-C2 subunits showed no effect on this rate (Fay, P. J., and Koshibu, K. J. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 19049–19054). However, A1 subunit increased the A2-dependent stimulation by ∼10-fold. The K m for factor X in the presence of A2 subunit was unaffected by A1 subunit, whereas thek cat observed in the presence of saturating A1 and A2 subunits (∼15 min−1) represented 5–10% of the value observed for native factor VIIIa (∼200 min−1). An anti-A1 subunit antibody that blocks the association of A2 eliminated the A1-dependent contribution to factor IXa activity. Inclusion of both A1 and A2 subunits resulted in greater increases in the fluorescence anisotropy of fluorescein-Phe-Phe-Arg factor IXa than that observed for A2 subunit alone and approached values obtained with factor VIIIa. These results indicate that A1 subunit alters the A2 subunit-dependent modulation of the active site of factor IXa to synergistically increase cofactor activity, yielding an overall increase in k cat of over 1000-fold compared with factor IXa alone.

The proteolytically activated form of factor VIII, factor VIIIa, serves as a cofactor for the serine protease factor IXa in the conversion of factor X to factor Xa. This complex of enzyme and cofactor, assembled on an anionic phospholipid surface, is referred to as the intrinsic factor Xase. The role of factor VIIIa is to increase the catalytic rate constant (k cat) by several orders of magnitude. The phospholipid surface is primarily involved in reducing molecular interactions to a two-dimensional space, thereby markedly decreasing the K m for factor X. The association of factor VIIIa and factor IXa and the mechanism(s) by which factor VIIIa stimulates reaction rate are not fully understood. The importance of this interaction is indicated by defects or deficiency in factor VIII that result in hemophilia A.Factor VIII circulates as a heavy chain (A1-A2-B domains) and a light chain (A3-C1-C2 domains) associated in a divalent metal ion-dependent heterodimer. Proteolysis by thrombin yields factor VIIIa, a trimer of A1, A2, and A3-C1-C2 subunits 1The factor VIIIa nomenclature is based on the domainal structure designated by A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2. Factor VIIIa subunits are designated as A1 (residues 1–372), A2 (residues 373–740) and A3-C1-C2 (residues 1690–2332) with noncovalent subunit associations denoted by a shill (/) and covalent associations by a hyphen (-).1The factor VIIIa nomenclature is based on the domainal structure designated by A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2. Factor VIIIa subunits are designated as A1 (residues 1–372), A2 (residues 373–740) and A3-C1-C2 (residues 1690–2332) with noncovalent subunit associations denoted by a shill (/) and covalent associations by a hyphen (-).

Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The A1 and A3-C1-C2 subunits retain the divalent metal ion-dependent linkage and can be isolated as a stable dimer. Conversely, the A2 subunit is associated with the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer in a primarily electrostatic interaction and readily dissociates from the dimer at physiological pH and ionic strength. However under appropriate reaction conditions, factor VIIIa can be reconstituted from isolated A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer and A2 subunit (2Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12775-12781Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In human factor VIIIa, the affinity of A2 subunit for the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer (K d ∼260 nm at physiological pH) is increased 10-fold under slightly acidic conditions (K d ∼30 nm at pH = 6.0) (5Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13246-13250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Little is known about residues in the A2 subunit and A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer that are involved in the intersubunit interaction. Several lines of evidence suggest that the C-terminal acidic region of the A1 subunit (residues 337–372) participates in the retention of A2 subunit following cleavage at the A1-A2 junction. These observations include failure of A2 subunit to bind the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer in which the A1 subunit has been truncated at residue 336 (6Persson E. Ezban M. Shymko R.M.

The factor VIII light chain-derived A3-C1-C2 subunit likely possesses a high affinity site for factor IXa. The free light chain of factor VIII shows similar affinity for factor IXa (K d ∼14 nm, Ref. 8Lenting P.J. Donath M.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as is observed for factor VIIIa (K d ∼2–20 nm, Refs. 9Duffy E.J. Parker E.T. Mutucumarana V.P. Johnson A.E. Lollar P. J. Biol.

This suggests little if any of the binding energy for the interaction is contributed by the factor VIII heavy chain-derived subunits, A1 and A2. This interactive site was localized to the A3 domain following studies using inhibition by a monoclonal antibody whose epitope is represented by residues 1778–1840 (8Lenting P.J. Donath M.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and was further localized to within residues 1811–1818 based upon studies employing synthetic peptides (11Lenting P.J. van de Loo J.W.

Smudzin T.M. Walker F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the capacity for factor IXa to selectively protect from cleavage at this site (12Regan L.M. Lamphear B.J. Huggins C.F. Walker F.J. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9445-9452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a factor IXa interactive site in the A2 subunit was postulated. Synthetic peptides spanning residues 558–565 noncompetitively inhibited factor Xase activity (13Fay P.J. Beattie T. Huggins C.F. Regan L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20522-20527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The peptide also blocked the A2 subunit-dependent increase in fluorescence anisotropy of factor IXa labeled in its active site with fluorescein (14O'Brien L.M. Medved L.V. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27087-27092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that residues contained in A2 sequence 558–565 are critical to the interaction between cofactor and enzyme.Recently, we showed that the isolated A2 subunit associates with the protease in the absence of other factor VIIIa subunits (15Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The result of this interaction is an approximate 100-fold enhancement in the rate of substrate factor X conversion by a mechanism affectingk cat rather than K m. This functional effect is unique to A2 and was not observed with the other isolated factor VIIIa subunits. However, the magnitude of this effect is ∼1% of that observed for factor VIIIa, indicating contributions of other factor VIIIa subunits to the catalytic rate exist. In this study we show that A1 subunit alters the interaction of A2 subunit with factor IXa to synergistically enhance the A2 effect by ∼10-fold, thus yielding a k cat ∼10% of that observed for the intact cofactor.DISCUSSIONIn the present study we demonstrate a significant contribution of A1 subunit to the A2-dependent stimulation of the catalytic activity of factor IXa toward factor X. The role of A1 appears to modulate the A2 subunit which in turn alters the interaction of enzyme with substrate. This effect is suggested by the ∼10-fold increase ink cat for the A2-dependent effect in factor Xa generation, whereas little if any change in A2 affinity for factor IXa is observed in the presence of A1 subunit. That A1 modulates A2 rather than factor IXa and/or factor X is suggested by several observations including (i) the lack of any contribution to catalytic rate in the presence of A1 subunit alone, (ii) a requirement for a stoichiometric excess of A1 relative to A2 subunit, and (iii) the inhibition of the A1-dependent contribution to activity by an antibody that disrupts the interaction between the two factor VIIIa subunits. These results implicate the A1 subunit as contributing to the cofactor function of factor VIIIa through an indirect mechanism relative to enzyme in the intrinsic factor Xase.Relatively little information is available on the interactions between A2 and other factor VIIIa subunits. The affinity of A2 for A1/A3-C1-C2 is both pH (5Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13246-13250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lollar P. Parker C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1688-1692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ionic strength (2Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) sensitive, with slightly acidic conditions increasing affinity by ∼10-fold (5Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13246-13250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dissociation rate constant (∼0.35 min−1) is about 3-fold faster for the human protein than the porcine material (4Lollar P. Parker E.T. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23652-23657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A2 subunit exhibits little if any affinity for the A3-C1-C2 subunit based upon failure of the latter subunit to inhibit reassociation of A2 with A1/A3-C1-C2 in a functional assay. This result is supported by the present study showing lack of effect of A3-C1-C2 on the A2-dependent stimulation of factor IXa activity even though the A3-C1-C2 possesses high affinity for the enzyme (8Lenting P.J. Donath M.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, A1 subunit was demonstrated to effectively inhibit the association of A2 subunit with the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer in that near equivalent concentrations of A1 and dimer yielded 50% inhibition of factor VIIIa reconstitution (5Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13246-13250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus A2 likely interacts primarily with A1 subunit in the factor VIIIa heterotrimer.The C-terminal region of A1 subunit appears critical for the association of A2 subunit. In an early experiment, it was observed that activated protein C-catalyzed cleavage of the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer at Arg336 yielded a truncated version of the dimer (A1336/A3-C1-C2), which was ineffective in competing with the native dimer for A2 association (7Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. Walker F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the truncated dimer failed to bind A2 subunit as judged by surface plasmon resonance (6Persson E. Ezban M. Shymko R.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12775-12781Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies showed direct interaction of the A2 subunit with a fluorescently labeled peptide corresponding to A1 C-terminal residues 337–372 (16Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Huggins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17861-17866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and localized a covalent linkage formed by the zero-length cross-linker, ethyl-dimethylaminopropylcarbodiimide, between the C-terminal region of A1 and the N-terminal half of A2 (27O'Brien L.M. Huggins C.F. Fay P.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 3943-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, antibody prepared to a synthetic peptide corresponding to the acidic residues 337–372 blocked the reconstitution of factor VIIIa activity from A2 plus dimer, presumably by interfering with the inter-subunit interaction (16Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Huggins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17861-17866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This immunologic reagent also blocked the contribution of A1 subunit to the A2-dependent stimulation of factor IXa activity, consistent with the role of the A1 C-terminal region in representing an A2 interactive site.The above data support the notion that A1 stimulation is mediated through its interaction with A2. However, the mechanism by which A1 modulates the “cofactor” activity of A2 subunit toward factor IXa remains to be determined. One possibility is that A1 alters A2 conformation, and this alteration potentiates the cofactor role without altering affinity for the enzyme. Support for such a conformation change is suggested by changes in the affinity of the apolar dye, bisanilinonapthalsulfonic acid, for a surface-exposed hydrophobic pocket in the free A2 subunit compared with the A2 domain/subunit in factor VIII/factor VIIIa (28Sudhakar K. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23015-23021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, thrombin cleavage of the factor VIII heavy chain results in the formation of a new salt linkage between A1 and A2 subunits (27O'Brien L.M. Huggins C.F. Fay P.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 3943-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that could yield a conformation change in the latter.An alternative mechanism of A1 subunit directly modulating substrate factor X appears unlikely, but cannot be discounted. The anisotropy of Fl-FFR-factor IXa was increased in the presence of the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer, and a further increase was observed in the presence of factor X (29Regan L.M. O'Brien L.M. Beattie T.L. Sudhakar K. Walker F.J. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3982-3987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, these effects may result in part from contribution of the A3-C1-C2 to factor IXa binding. Recently we showed that A1 subunit possesses an interactive site for factor X that is also contained within the C-terminal acidic region (17Lapan K.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2082-2088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The affinity for this interaction (K d ∼1–3 μm, (17Lapan K.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2082-2088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar)) is markedly lower than the concentration of factor X used in the factor Xa generation reactions performed in the present study. Furthermore, the degree of stimulation of the A2 effect by A1 subunit was independent of factor X concentration. Finally, the presence of A1 subunit did not affect the K m for factor X. Taken together with the inability of isolated A1 subunit alone to enhance the rate of factor X conversion, these observations argue against this factor VIIIa subunit substantially affecting the enzyme-substrate interaction by an A2-independent mechanism.The cofactor activity resulting from the presence of both A1 and A2 subunits yields an ∼1000-fold increase in thek cat for factor IXa-catalyzed conversion of factor X compared with factor IXa alone. This magnitude increase is ∼10% of that observed in the presence of intact factor VIIIa. The reason for the disparity does not appear to reflect inactive/defective subunits resulting from the isolation procedures because native-like factor VIIIa activity can be reconstituted from the isolated A1, A3-C1-C2, and A2 subunits. Thus the difference ink cat values obtained for A1 plus A2versus intact factor VIIIa may be attributed to contributions by the A3-C1-C2 subunit. This result is consistent with observations showing that thrombin cleavage of the light chain actually contributes to the specific activity of factor VIIIa (30Donath M.-J.S.H. Lenting P.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3648-3655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 31Regan L.M. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8546-8552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).The A3-C1-C2 subunit also appears to be responsible for the factor VIIIa-dependent reduction in K m for factor X. K m values for factor X are similar for reactions run with factor IXa alone (121 nm; Ref. 15Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), factor IXa plus A2 (101 nm; Ref. 15Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and factor IXa plus A2 and A1 subunits (107 nm; this study). However, theK m for factor X interactions run with intact factor VIIIa (33 nm; Ref. 15Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) is reduced by severalfold. This effect is likely dependent upon the phospholipid surface binding properties localized within the C2 domain of this subunit (32Foster P.A. Fulcher C.A. Houghten R.A. Zimmerman T.S. Blood. 1990; 75: 1999-2004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Finally, A3-C1-C2 appears to be critical for physiological interactions of factor VIIIa with factor IXa. First, this subunit contains a high affinity site for factor IXa (K d∼14 nm; Ref. 8Lenting P.J. Donath M.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that approaches the affinity of factor VIIIa for the enzyme (K d ∼2 nm; Ref. 9Duffy E.J. Parker E.T. Mutucumarana V.P. Johnson A.E. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17006-17011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As noted earlier, the affinity of A2 subunit for factor IXa is markedly weaker (K d ∼300 nm; Ref. 15Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and as determined in the present report, this value is unchanged by the presence of the A1 subunit. Second, the capacity for factor VIIIa to be recognized as substrate for factor IXa (that is, cleaved at Arg336 in the A1 subunit) appears dependent upon A3-C1-C2 and influenced by A2. Earlier studies showed that factor IXa cleaved intact factor VIIIa ∼3-fold faster than A1/A3-C1-C2, implying a role for A2 in the rate increase (24Lamphear B.J. Fay P.J. Blood. 1992; 80: 3120-3126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This result is not surprising given the recent observation of A2 enhancing factor IXa-catalyzed cleavage of substrate factor X. However, in the absence of A3-C1-C2, we observe no detectable cleavage of A1 subunit independent of the presence of A2 subunit and at concentrations that approach near maximal levels for the effects of these isolated subunits on factor Xa generating activity. This observation suggests A3-C1-C2 is likely to be required for proper orientation of A1 subunit for cleavage by factor IXa in the surface-dependent reaction. This orientation of A1 imposed by A3-C1-C2 may also be required for maximal cofactor activity. Thus the restriction in factor IXa proteolytic activity toward A1 subunit may also account for the sub-maximal rates of factor X conversion in the presence of A1 and A2 factor VIIIa subunits compared with the intact cofactor. The proteolytically activated form of factor VIII, factor VIIIa, serves as a cofactor for the serine protease factor IXa in the conversion of factor X to factor Xa. This complex of enzyme and cofactor, assembled on an anionic phospholipid surface, is referred to as the intrinsic factor Xase. The role of factor VIIIa is to increase the catalytic rate constant (k cat) by several orders of magnitude. The phospholipid surface is primarily involved in reducing molecular interactions to a two-dimensional space, thereby markedly decreasing the K m for factor X. The association of factor VIIIa and factor IXa and the mechanism(s) by which factor VIIIa stimulates reaction rate are not fully understood. The importance of this interaction is indicated by defects or deficiency in factor VIII that result in hemophilia A. Factor VIII circulates as a heavy chain (A1-A2-B domains) and a light chain (A3-C1-C2 domains) associated in a divalent metal ion-dependent heterodimer. Proteolysis by thrombin yields factor VIIIa, a trimer of A1, A2, and A3-C1-C2 subunits 1The factor VIIIa nomenclature is based on the domainal structure designated by A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2. Factor VIIIa subunits are designated as A1 (residues 1–372), A2 (residues 373–740) and A3-C1-C2 (residues 1690–2332) with noncovalent subunit associations denoted by a shill (/) and covalent associations by a hyphen (-).1The factor VIIIa nomenclature is based on the domainal structure designated by A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2. Factor VIIIa subunits are designated as A1 (residues 1–372), A2 (residues 373–740) and A3-C1-C2 (residues 1690–2332) with noncovalent subunit associations denoted by a shill (/) and covalent associations by a hyphen (-).

Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The A1 and A3-C1-C2 subunits retain the divalent metal ion-dependent linkage and can be isolated as a stable dimer. Conversely, the A2 subunit is associated with the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer in a primarily electrostatic interaction and readily dissociates from the dimer at physiological pH and ionic strength. However under appropriate reaction conditions, factor VIIIa can be reconstituted from isolated A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer and A2 subunit (2Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12775-12781Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In human factor VIIIa, the affinity of A2 subunit for the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer (K d ∼260 nm at physiological pH) is increased 10-fold under slightly acidic conditions (K d ∼30 nm at pH = 6.0) (5Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13246-13250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Little is known about residues in the A2 subunit and A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer that are involved in the intersubunit interaction. Several lines of evidence suggest that the C-terminal acidic region of the A1 subunit (residues 337–372) participates in the retention of A2 subunit following cleavage at the A1-A2 junction. These observations include failure of A2 subunit to bind the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer in which the A1 subunit has been truncated at residue 336 (6Persson E. Ezban M. Shymko R.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12775-12781Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 7Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. Walker F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

In an early experiment, it was observed that activated protein C-catalyzed cleavage of the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer at Arg336 yielded a truncated version of the dimer (A1336/A3-C1-C2), which was ineffective in competing with the native dimer for A2 association (7Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. Walker F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the truncated dimer failed to bind A2 subunit as judged by surface plasmon resonance (6Persson E. Ezban M. Shymko R.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12775-12781Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies showed direct interaction of the A2 subunit with a fluorescently labeled peptide corresponding to A1 C-terminal residues 337–372 (16Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Huggins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17861-17866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and localized a covalent linkage formed by the zero-length cross-linker, ethyl-dimethylaminopropylcarbodiimide, between the C-terminal region of A1 and the N-terminal half of A2 (27O'Brien L.M. Huggins C.F. Fay P.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 3943-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, antibody prepared to a synthetic peptide corresponding to the acidic residues 337–372 blocked the reconstitution of factor VIIIa activity from A2 plus dimer, presumably by interfering with the inter-subunit interaction (16Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Huggins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17861-17866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This immunologic reagent also blocked the contribution of A1 subunit to the A2-dependent stimulation of factor IXa activity, consistent with the role of the A1 C-terminal region in representing an A2 interactive site.The above data support the notion that A1 stimulation is mediated through its interaction with A2. However, the mechanism by which A1 modulates the “cofactor” activity of A2 subunit toward factor IXa remains to be determined. One possibility is that A1 alters A2 conformation, and this alteration potentiates the cofactor role without altering affinity for the enzyme. Support for such a conformation change is suggested by changes in the affinity of the apolar dye, bisanilinonapthalsulfonic acid, for a surface-exposed hydrophobic pocket in the free A2 subunit compared with the A2 domain/subunit in factor VIII/factor VIIIa (28Sudhakar K. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23015-23021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, thrombin cleavage of the factor VIII heavy chain results in the formation of a new salt linkage between A1 and A2 subunits (27O'Brien L.M. Huggins C.F. Fay P.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 3943-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that could yield a conformation change in the latter.An alternative mechanism of A1 subunit directly modulating substrate factor X appears unlikely, but cannot be discounted. The anisotropy of Fl-FFR-factor IXa was increased in the presence of the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer, and a further increase was observed in the presence of factor X (29Regan L.M. O'Brien L.M. Beattie T.L. Sudhakar K. Walker F.J. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3982-3987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, these effects may result in part from contribution of the A3-C1-C2 to factor IXa binding. Recently we showed that A1 subunit possesses an interactive site for factor X that is also contained within the C-terminal acidic region (17Lapan K.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2082-2088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The affinity for this interaction (K d ∼1–3 μm, (17Lapan K.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2082-2088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar)) is markedly lower than the concentration of factor X used in the factor Xa generation reactions performed in the present study. Furthermore, the degree of stimulation of the A2 effect by A1 subunit was independent of factor X concentration. Finally, the presence of A1 subunit did not affect the K m for factor X. Taken together with the inability of isolated A1 subunit alone to enhance the rate of factor X conversion, these observations argue against this factor VIIIa subunit substantially affecting the enzyme-substrate interaction by an A2-independent mechanism.The cofactor activity resulting from the presence of both A1 and A2 subunits yields an ∼1000-fold increase in thek cat for factor IXa-catalyzed conversion of factor X compared with factor IXa alone. This magnitude increase is ∼10% of that observed in the presence of intact factor VIIIa. The reason for the disparity does not appear to reflect inactive/defective subunits resulting from the isolation procedures because native-like factor VIIIa activity can be reconstituted from the isolated A1, A3-C1-C2, and A2 subunits. Thus the difference ink cat values obtained for A1 plus A2versus intact factor VIIIa may be attributed to contributions by the A3-C1-C2 subunit. This result is consistent with observations showing that thrombin cleavage of the light chain actually contributes to the specific activity of factor VIIIa (30Donath M.-J.S.H. Lenting P.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3648-3655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 31Regan L.M. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8546-8552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).The A3-C1-C2 subunit also appears to be responsible for the factor VIIIa-dependent reduction in K m for factor X. K m values for factor X are similar for reactions run with factor IXa alone (121 nm; Ref. 15Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), factor IXa plus A2 (101 nm; Ref. 15Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and factor IXa plus A2 and A1 subunits (107 nm; this study). However, theK m for factor X interactions run with intact factor VIIIa (33 nm; Ref. 15Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) is reduced by severalfold. This effect is likely dependent upon the phospholipid surface binding properties localized within the C2 domain of this subunit (32Foster P.A. Fulcher C.A. Houghten R.A. Zimmerman T.S. Blood. 1990; 75: 1999-2004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Finally, A3-C1-C2 appears to be critical for physiological interactions of factor VIIIa with factor IXa. First, this subunit contains a high affinity site for factor IXa (K d∼14 nm; Ref. 8Lenting P.J. Donath M.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that approaches the affinity of factor VIIIa for the enzyme (K d ∼2 nm; Ref. 9Duffy E.J. Parker E.T. Mutucumarana V.P. Johnson A.E. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17006-17011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As noted earlier, the affinity of A2 subunit for factor IXa is markedly weaker (K d ∼300 nm; Ref. 15Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and as determined in the present report, this value is unchanged by the presence of the A1 subunit. Second, the capacity for factor VIIIa to be recognized as substrate for factor IXa (that is, cleaved at Arg336 in the A1 subunit) appears dependent upon A3-C1-C2 and influenced by A2. Earlier studies showed that factor IXa cleaved intact factor VIIIa ∼3-fold faster than A1/A3-C1-C2, implying a role for A2 in the rate increase (24Lamphear B.J. Fay P.J. Blood. 1992; 80: 3120-3126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This result is not surprising given the recent observation of A2 enhancing factor IXa-catalyzed cleavage of substrate factor X. However, in the absence of A3-C1-C2, we observe no detectable cleavage of A1 subunit independent of the presence of A2 subunit and at concentrations that approach near maximal levels for the effects of these isolated subunits on factor Xa generating activity. This observation suggests A3-C1-C2 is likely to be required for proper orientation of A1 subunit for cleavage by factor IXa in the surface-dependent reaction. This orientation of A1 imposed by A3-C1-C2 may also be required for maximal cofactor activity. Thus the restriction in factor IXa proteolytic activity toward A1 subunit may also account for the sub-maximal rates of factor X conversion in the presence of A1 and A2 factor VIIIa subunits compared with the intact cofactor. In the present study we demonstrate a significant contribution of A1 subunit to the A2-dependent stimulation of the catalytic activity of factor IXa toward factor X. The role of A1 appears to modulate the A2 subunit which in turn alters the interaction of enzyme with substrate. This effect is suggested by the ∼10-fold increase ink cat for the A2-dependent effect in factor Xa generation, whereas little if any change in A2 affinity for factor IXa is observed in the presence of A1 subunit. That A1 modulates A2 rather than factor IXa and/or factor X is suggested by several observations including (i) the lack of any contribution to catalytic rate in the presence of A1 subunit alone, (ii) a requirement for a stoichiometric excess of A1 relative to A2 subunit, and (iii) the inhibition of the A1-dependent contribution to activity by an antibody that disrupts the interaction between the two factor VIIIa subunits. These results implicate the A1 subunit as contributing to the cofactor function of factor VIIIa through an indirect mechanism relative to enzyme in the intrinsic factor Xase. Relatively little information is available on the interactions between A2 and other factor VIIIa subunits. The affinity of A2 for A1/A3-C1-C2 is both pH (5Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13246-13250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lollar P. Parker C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1688-1692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ionic strength (2Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) sensitive, with slightly acidic conditions increasing affinity by ∼10-fold (5Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13246-13250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dissociation rate constant (∼0.35 min−1) is about 3-fold faster for the human protein than the porcine material (4Lollar P. Parker E.T. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23652-23657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A2 subunit exhibits little if any affinity for the A3-C1-C2 subunit based upon failure of the latter subunit to inhibit reassociation of A2 with A1/A3-C1-C2 in a functional assay. This result is supported by the present study showing lack of effect of A3-C1-C2 on the A2-dependent stimulation of factor IXa activity even though the A3-C1-C2 possesses high affinity for the enzyme (8Lenting P.J. Donath M.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, A1 subunit was demonstrated to effectively inhibit the association of A2 subunit with the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer in that near equivalent concentrations of A1 and dimer yielded 50% inhibition of factor VIIIa reconstitution (5Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13246-13250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus A2 likely interacts primarily with A1 subunit in the factor VIIIa heterotrimer. The C-terminal region of A1 subunit appears critical for the association of A2 subunit.

Similarly, the truncated dimer failed to bind A2 subunit as judged by surface plasmon resonance (6Persson E. Ezban M. Shymko R.M.

https://openalex.org/W1974133808,"Structure-function relationship analyses of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) have suggested that this metabolically important enzyme consists of several functional and at least two structural domains (Østerlund, T., Danielsson, B., Degerman, E., Contreras, J.

Lipolysis is regulated by hormones and neurotransmitters, and the major target of this regulation is HSL (1Strålfors P. Olsson H. Belfrage P. Boyer P.D. Krebs E.G. The Enzymes. 18. Academic Press, New York1987: 147-177Google Scholar, 2Holm C. Langin D. Manganiello V. Belfrage P. Degerman E. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 286: 45-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Catabolic hormones and neurotransmitters (e.g. norepinephrine) activate cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which, in turn, phosphorylates and activates HSL. The major antilipolytic hormone is insulin, which activates phosphodiesterase 3B that decreases cAMP levels and thereby deactivates cAMP-dependent protein kinase (3Degerman E. Belfrage P. Manganiello V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6823-6826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The regulation by reversible phosphorylation makes HSL unique among lipases. Phosphorylation of HSL by cAMP-dependent protein kinase occurs at three sites, the serines 563, 659, and 660, 2The residue numbering is for rat HSL.2The residue numbering is for rat HSL.both in vitro and in primary rat adipocytes (4Anthonsen M.W. Rönnstrand L. Wernstedt C. Degerman E. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 215-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). A fourth site of phosphorylation, Ser-565, may be a substrate of the AMP-activated protein kinase, because this has been shown to be the case in vitro (5Garton A.J. Cambell D.G. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Colbran R.J. Yeaman S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 129: 249-254Crossref Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Also, preincubations of primary rat adipocytes with the AMP-mimicking agent 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-d-ribofuranoside inhibit isoprenaline-induced lipolysis (6Sullivan J.E. Brocklehurst K.J. Marley A.E. Carey F. Carling D. Beri R.K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), thus lending support for a role of AMP-activated protein kinase in the regulation of HSL.HSL is known to associate with phospholipid vesicles (7Holm C. Fredrikson G. Sundler R. Belfrage P. Lipids. 1990; 25: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and to have an overall amphipathic character (8Holm C. Fredrikson G. Belfrage P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15659-15661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that HSL has one or more sites at the surface, enabling interactions with detergent and membranes such as the surface of intracellular lipid droplets. Specific recognition of these lipid droplets, as opposed to other membrane surfaces, would constitute another unique feature of HSL among lipases.As for other lipases and esterases, it was expected that HSL, at least in part, harbors the α/β-hydrolase fold and has a catalytic triad (Ser, Asp/Glu, His) (9Derewenda Z.S.

To map these and other features in HSL, we have initiated analyses into its structural and functional domains by alignments to other lipases and esterases and by limited proteolysis, denaturation, site-directed mutagenesis, and molecular modeling. Analysis by limited proteolysis and denaturation suggested that HSL has at least two structural domains (10Østerlund T. Danielsson B. Degerman E. Contreras J.A. Edgren G. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C. Holm C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Those regions in the C-terminal part of the molecule that align to other lipases and esterases are thought to adopt the α/β-hydrolase fold and to harbor the catalytic triad (10Østerlund T.

In fact, it was possible to build a model for the catalytic α/β-hydrolase fold core (11Contreras J.A. Karlsson M. Østerlund T. Laurell H. Svensson A. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31426-31430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The proposed residues of the catalytic triad have been probed by site-directed mutagenesis and found to be essential for activity (12Holm C. Davis R.C. Østerlund T. Schotz M.C. Fredrikson G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 13Østerlund T. Contreras J.A. Holm C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), strongly supporting the structural model for the catalytic core. In the primary structure, this core is interrupted by approximately 200 residues, including the four phosphorylation sites, which are thought to form a regulatory module (10Østerlund T. Danielsson B. Degerman E. Contreras J.A. Edgren G. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C. Holm C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 11Contreras J.A. Karlsson M. Østerlund T. Laurell H. Svensson A. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31426-31430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This part is a substrate of kinases and phosphatases and has been predicted to contain only a few secondary structure elements (11Contreras J.A. Karlsson M. Østerlund T. Laurell H. Svensson A. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31426-31430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, it is suspected to be an exposed and rather flexible module. The N-terminal part of the protein (approximately 320 residues) is believed to constitute a separate structural domain and shows no significant sequence similarity to other proteins (10Østerlund T. Danielsson B. Degerman E. Contreras J.A. Edgren G. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C. Holm C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).To establish the structural domain composition of HSL, we have performed spectroscopic analyses during denaturation. Data from these analyses support the idea that HSL has two major structural domains. Limited proteolysis analyses (10Østerlund T. Danielsson B. Degerman E. Contreras J.A. Edgren G. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C. Holm C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) have been extended through identification of generated peptides by mass spectrometry to identify exposed regions of the intact protein and to identify more stable fragments of the HSL molecule. Both the suggested hinge region and the regulatory module are exposed to proteolysis, whereas the N-terminal domain appears to be highly resistant to cleavage. Analysis by proteolysis of a HSL mutant with an engineered Factor X site in the predicted hinge confirms these results, and further support is provided by analysis of the hydropathic pattern of HSL. Based on the generated results, we present a more complete overall structural model for HSL.DISCUSSIONIn this study, further evidence for our previously proposed model for the domain structure of HSL is provided (10Østerlund T. Danielsson B. Degerman E. Contreras J.A. Edgren G. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C. Holm C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 11Contreras J.A. Karlsson M. Østerlund T. Laurell H. Svensson A. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31426-31430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The denaturation analyses support that HSL has at least two (and probably only two) structural domains. The fluorescence data clearly suggest the unfolding of two individually folded domains. Although HSL appears to be a homodimer in solution, it is unlikely that the dissociation of dimers contributes significantly to the loss in fluorescence at low GdnCl concentrations. CD measurements during denaturation by GdnCl and heat indicate that the unfolding of secondary structure elements occurs in two major steps. It cannot be ruled out that some protein aggregation occurs in the thermal denaturation. However, it does not seem to have any significant influence on the CD signal.From both spectroscopic data and proteolytic analyses, it appears that one domain is more fragile than the other. The fragile domain is unfolded by low GdnCl concentrations and probably represents the C-terminal domain, because all HSL activities are lost concomitant with its unfolding (10Østerlund T. Danielsson B. Degerman E. Contreras J.A. Edgren G. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C. Holm C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This domain is also highly sensitive to proteolytic digestion, especially in the regulatory module, as shown by proteolytic cleavage by both EndoL and Factor X. The second unfolding, which occurs at high GdnCl concentrations, probably represents the N-terminal domain. Because detergent and perhaps glycerol had a more protective effect on this domain than on the other domain, it is speculated that some sites of detergent and membrane interactions are located here. Other sites might be found in the α/β-hydrolase fold core, although most hydrophobic residues of this part are not exposed (11Contreras J.A. Karlsson M. Østerlund T. Laurell H. Svensson A. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31426-31430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To directly compare the pattern of hydrophobicity in the primary structure of HSL with the proposed domain structure, the mean hydropathic index was calculated for every 60 residues, according to Kyte and Doolittle (19Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17007) Google Scholar). Fig. 8 shows the calculated hydropathy indices with indications of the localization of suggested domains in the primary structure. Hydrophilic regions correlate well with the anticipated hinge region and regulatory module.Arrows indicate the major cleavage sites as identified in Fig. 6. The most hydrophobic regions are those of the α/β-hydrolase fold, whereas the N-terminal domain has an amphipathic character. Because the regulatory module is probably located at the surface of the C-terminal domain, and most of the hydrophobic residues of the α/β-hydrolase fold are located in the core of the fold (11Contreras J.A. Karlsson M. Østerlund T. Laurell H. Svensson A. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31426-31430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), there are probably only a few exposed hydrophobic patches in this part. The membrane/detergent binding sites are presumably located at these patches as well as at hydrophobic patches in the N-terminal domain. Overall, the hydropathy calculations support the suggested domain structure, particularly by demonstrating that the exposed regions are markedly hydrophilic.The exact location of the hinge region in the primary structure has been the subject of some speculation (10Østerlund T. Danielsson B. Degerman E. Contreras J.A. Edgren G. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C. Holm C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 11Contreras J.A. Karlsson M. Østerlund T. Laurell H. Svensson A. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31426-31430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The cleavage at Lys-323 and the hydrophilic character of this region support the concept that the N- and C-terminal domains are separated at the hinge region (residues 315–335) as suggested from alignments (10Østerlund T. Danielsson B. Degerman E. Contreras J.A. Edgren G. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C. Holm C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Cleavage of HSLFacX by Factor X shows that this region is immediately accessible to the protease. Our current view and working hypothesis of the domain structure is illustrated in Fig.9 with indications of cleavage sites and action of GdnCl at different concentrations. The secondary structure elements of the α/β-hydrolase fold are outlined (11Contreras J.A. Karlsson M. Østerlund T. Laurell H. Svensson A. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31426-31430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).Figure 9Hypothetical structural model of HSL . It is suggested that HSL has two major structural domains: one N-terminal domain (dark gray) formed approximately by residues 1–320, and a C-terminal catalytic domain (frame). One part of the C-terminal domain harbors the α/β-hydrolase fold that is shown outlined by its secondary structure elements (β-strands aregray arrows, α-helices are rectangles), as they were identified previously (11Contreras J.A. Karlsson M. Østerlund T. Laurell H. Svensson A. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31426-31430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The other part of the C-terminal domain is believed to form a regulatory module (light gray). Residues of particular importance are shown. These include members of the catalytic triad (Ser-423, Asp-703, and His-733) (10Østerlund T. Danielsson B. Degerman E. Contreras J.A. Edgren G. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C. Holm C. Biochem.

The latter is the catalytic domain formed by an α/β-hydrolase fold core (11Contreras J.A. Karlsson M. Østerlund T. Laurell H. Svensson A. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31426-31430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which is interrupted in the primary structure by the insertion of a regulatory module. Both the regulatory module and the suggested hinge are exposed hydrophilic parts. Additional investigations of HSLFacXbefore and after cleavage and the expression of individual domains are underway. Purified domains and fragments will be valuable tools for structural and functional analyses as well as the determination of the three-dimensional structure of HSL. The release of fatty acids from stored triglycerides in adipocytes is accomplished by hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) 1The abbreviations used are: HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; DTE, dithioerythritol; GdnCl, guanidine hydrochloride; SDS-PAGE, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis1The abbreviations used are: HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; DTE, dithioerythritol; GdnCl, guanidine hydrochloride; SDS-PAGE, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and monoglyceride lipase. Lipolysis is regulated by hormones and neurotransmitters, and the major target of this regulation is HSL (1Strålfors P. Olsson H. Belfrage P. Boyer P.D. Krebs E.G. The Enzymes. 18. Academic Press, New York1987: 147-177Google Scholar, 2Holm C. Langin D. Manganiello V. Belfrage P. Degerman E. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 286: 45-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Catabolic hormones and neurotransmitters (e.g. norepinephrine) activate cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which, in turn, phosphorylates and activates HSL. The major antilipolytic hormone is insulin, which activates phosphodiesterase 3B that decreases cAMP levels and thereby deactivates cAMP-dependent protein kinase (3Degerman E. Belfrage P. Manganiello V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6823-6826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The regulation by reversible phosphorylation makes HSL unique among lipases. Phosphorylation of HSL by cAMP-dependent protein kinase occurs at three sites, the serines 563, 659, and 660, 2The residue numbering is for rat HSL.2The residue numbering is for rat HSL.both in vitro and in primary rat adipocytes (4Anthonsen M.W. Rönnstrand L. Wernstedt C. Degerman E. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 215-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). A fourth site of phosphorylation, Ser-565, may be a substrate of the AMP-activated protein kinase, because this has been shown to be the case in vitro (5Garton A.J. Cambell D.G. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Colbran R.J. Yeaman S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 129: 249-254Crossref Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Also, preincubations of primary rat adipocytes with the AMP-mimicking agent 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-d-ribofuranoside inhibit isoprenaline-induced lipolysis (6Sullivan J.E. Brocklehurst K.J. Marley A.E. Carey F. Carling D. Beri R.K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), thus lending support for a role of AMP-activated protein kinase in the regulation of HSL. HSL is known to associate with phospholipid vesicles (7Holm C. Fredrikson G. Sundler R. Belfrage P. Lipids. 1990; 25: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and to have an overall amphipathic character (8Holm C. Fredrikson G. Belfrage P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15659-15661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that HSL has one or more sites at the surface, enabling interactions with detergent and membranes such as the surface of intracellular lipid droplets. Specific recognition of these lipid droplets, as opposed to other membrane surfaces, would constitute another unique feature of HSL among lipases. As for other lipases and esterases, it was expected that HSL, at least in part, harbors the α/β-hydrolase fold and has a catalytic triad (Ser, Asp/Glu, His) (9Derewenda Z.S. Schumaker V.N. Advances in Protein Chemistry. 45. Elsevier, Amsterdam1994: 1-52Google Scholar). To map these and other features in HSL, we have initiated analyses into its structural and functional domains by alignments to other lipases and esterases and by limited proteolysis, denaturation, site-directed mutagenesis, and molecular modeling. Analysis by limited proteolysis and denaturation suggested that HSL has at least two structural domains (10Østerlund T. Danielsson B. Degerman E. Contreras J.A. Edgren G. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C.

Fig. 8 shows the calculated hydropathy indices with indications of the localization of suggested domains in the primary structure. Hydrophilic regions correlate well with the anticipated hinge region and regulatory module.Arrows indicate the major cleavage sites as identified in Fig. 6. The most hydrophobic regions are those of the α/β-hydrolase fold, whereas the N-terminal domain has an amphipathic character. Because the regulatory module is probably located at the surface of the C-terminal domain, and most of the hydrophobic residues of the α/β-hydrolase fold are located in the core of the fold (11Contreras J.A. Karlsson M. Østerlund T. Laurell H. Svensson A. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31426-31430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), there are probably only a few exposed hydrophobic patches in this part. The membrane/detergent binding sites are presumably located at these patches as well as at hydrophobic patches in the N-terminal domain. Overall, the hydropathy calculations support the suggested domain structure, particularly by demonstrating that the exposed regions are markedly hydrophilic. The exact location of the hinge region in the primary structure has been the subject of some speculation (10Østerlund T. Danielsson B. Degerman E. Contreras J.A. Edgren G. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C. Holm C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 11Contreras J.A. Karlsson M. Østerlund T. Laurell H. Svensson A. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31426-31430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The cleavage at Lys-323 and the hydrophilic character of this region support the concept that the N- and C-terminal domains are separated at the hinge region (residues 315–335) as suggested from alignments (10Østerlund T. Danielsson B. Degerman E. Contreras J.A. Edgren G. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C. Holm C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Cleavage of HSLFacX by Factor X shows that this region is immediately accessible to the protease. Our current view and working hypothesis of the domain structure is illustrated in Fig.9 with indications of cleavage sites and action of GdnCl at different concentrations. The secondary structure elements of the α/β-hydrolase fold are outlined (11Contreras J.A. Karlsson M. Østerlund T. Laurell H. Svensson A. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31426-31430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the present study provides additional support for the proposal that HSL is composed of two major structural domains encoded by exons 1–4 and 5–9, respectively. The latter is the catalytic domain formed by an α/β-hydrolase fold core (11Contreras J.A. Karlsson M. Østerlund T. Laurell H. Svensson A. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31426-31430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which is interrupted in the primary structure by the insertion of a regulatory module. Both the regulatory module and the suggested hinge are exposed hydrophilic parts. Additional investigations of HSLFacXbefore and after cleavage and the expression of individual domains are underway. Purified domains and fragments will be valuable tools for structural and functional analyses as well as the determination of the three-dimensional structure of HSL. We thank Birgitta Danielsson for excellent technical assistance regarding the expression and purification of wild-type HSL and Drs. Howard Wong and Henry Choy for contributing unpublished data on the subunit structure of HSL."

Immunoblots performed using monoclonal antibodies show that there are considerable variations in the levels of TBP and many TAFIIproteins present in various tissues. Consequently, the relative levels of TAFIIs and TBP vary significantly from one tissue to another. TBP and several TAFIIs are overexpressed in both testis and small intestine, while in marked contrast, many of these proteins, including TBP itself, were substantially down-regulated in nervous tissues and in the heart. These tissues do, however, show a high expression level of the TBP-like factor, which thus may represent an alternative factor for the specialized transcription program in some differentiated tissues. While there are significant variations in the levels of TAFII28 protein, reverse transcription-coupled polymerase chain reaction shows similar expression of the TAFII28 mRNA in different tissues. The variations in TAFII28 protein levels therefore result from post-transcriptional regulatory events.

The same region also enhanced the activity of the proximal promoter in transfections of pituitary-derived α-TSH and α-T3 cells. We have localized the activating sequences to a 125-bp region that contains consensus sites for factors that also play a role in proximal promoter activity. Proteins present in α-TSH and α-T3 cells as well as those from GH3 somatotrope-derived cells interact with this region. The upstream area inhibited proximal α-promoter activity by 80% when transfected into GH3 cells. Repression in GH3 cells was mediated through a different mechanism than enhancement, as supported by the following evidence. Reversing the orientation of the area resulted in a loss of proximal promoter activation in α-TSH and α-T3 cells but did not relieve repression in GH3 cells. Mutation of proximal sites shown to be important for activation had no effect on repression. Finally, bidirectional deletional analysis revealed that multiple elements are involved in activation and repression and, together with the DNA binding studies, suggests that these processes may be mediated through closely juxtaposed or even overlapping elements, thus perhaps defining a new class of bifunctional gene regulatory sequence.

In addition, interaction at the more proximal gonadotrope-specific element (GSE) from −213 to −200, which binds the steroidogenic factor SF-1 (17Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 878-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), is also required for the enhancer to function in gonadotrope cells but not in thyrotrope cells (14Wood W.M. Dowding J.M.

To identify the sites of functional interaction within the upstream region, we now report that the most proximal 125 bp of the previous 859-bp enhancing area are sufficient to account for all of the proximal promoter stimulatory activity in both pituitary-derived cell types that express the α-subunit. We demonstrate that the native orientation of the region with respect to the proximal promoter is crucial to maintain activation. We also show that several areas within this region bind proteins present in nuclear extracts from pituitary-derived cells including somatotrope-derived GH3 cells and that the areas of interaction contain potential binding sites for known transcription factors that also bind at important functional areas within the proximal promoter (17Barnhart K.M.

Interestingly, we further show that the same upstream region inhibits proximal α-promoter activity in GH3 cells. The mechanism whereby the upstream region exerts its repressive effect differs from activation in that it is not dependent on interaction at two proximal promoter binding sites and on the orientation of the upstream region with respect to the proximal region. The construction of luciferase vectors containing the region from −341 to +43 of the α-subunit promoter without and with mutated PGBE and GSE sites and the same plasmids with the 859-bp upstream enhancer fused upstream were described previously (13Brinkmeier M.L. Gordon D.F. Dowding J.M. Saunders T.L. Kendall S.K. Sarapura V.D. Wood W.M. Ridgway E.C. Camper S.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 622-633PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wood W.M. Dowding J.M. Sarapura V.D.

As a first approach, the 859-bp region was subdivided by digestion at PstI restriction sites. After separation on agarose gels and purification using Qiaex II resin (Qiagen), each fragment was inserted into the PstI site of pGEM5zf+ (Promega). Subsequent excision with EcoRV andHindII generated a blunt-ended fragment that was ligated into the SmaI site of a plasmid that contained the region from −341 to +43 of the α-subunit promoter inserted between theBamHI and HindIII sites of pSELECT (Promega). After checking by sequencing for the correct forward orientation of each PstI fragment, the fused enhancer/promoter region was excised by digestion with KpnI and HindIII and inserted between the same sites of the promoterless pA3LUC mammalian expression vector (20Wood W.M. Kao M.Y. Gordon D.F. Ridgway E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14840-14847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Maxwell I.H. Harrison G.S. Wood W.M. Maxwell F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 276-280PubMed Google Scholar). This resulted in luciferase expression plasmids with the areas from 70 to 246, from 241 to 654, and from 694 to 833 (renumbered as 1–184 in Fig. 6, also see the area between the underlined PstI sites in Fig. 2) fused upstream of the proximal α-subunit promoter region from −341 to +43. Progressively shorter 5′ prime truncations of the enhancer region were generated using a PCR strategy that employed sense oligonucleotides with the following sequences: (a) 5′-GCCGGTACCCTGCAGGTCTGCACATAAATTC-3′, (b) 5′-GCGGGTACCCACTCAGTCAATATCTTATCTCT-3′, (c) 5′-GCCGGTACCCAGAAGCAATTAAGCAGTCA-3′, (d) 5′-GCCGGTACCCTGCAGAATAAAAGCTCTTTG-3′, (e) 5′-GCGGGTACCACAGGTGTTAGGAACTC-3′, (f) 5′-GCGGGTACCCAGCCCGTGACCTCAT-3′, and (g) 5′-GCGGGTACCCTGCAGTCTAGGAGATTTG-3′.Figure 2Nucleotide sequence of the functional 210-bp region. The nucleotide sequence of the most proximal 210 bp of the 859-bp upstream enhancing area is shown. Positions 1–210 are identical to those from 649 to 859 of the GenBankTM sequence AFF044976.

Thegray box denotes a 60-bp sequence that is repeated with 65–70% homology in other areas of the mouse genome.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These oligonucleotides comprise sequences originating at positions 241, 421, 552, 649, 733, 798, and 827, respectively, of the upstream 859-bp enhancer sequence, respectively (GenBankTM accession number AFF044976). The last three represent positions 85, 150, and 179 of the renumbered 210-bp region shown in Fig. 2. They were designed with a 5′KpnI site (italicized) to facilitate subsequent subcloning. Each oligonucleotide was used in conjunction with a common antisense 22-nucleotide amplimer that is complementary to the sequence coding for amino acids 4–10 of luciferase and used to amplify the appropriate truncated enhancer/promoter fragment from the full-length 859-bp enhancer/promoter fusion in pA3LUC. The resulting fragments were then digested with KpnI and HindIII and reinserted between the same sites of pA3LUC. A 5′ deletion plasmid originating at position 85 and fused to a truncated Rous sarcoma virus promoter was similarly constructed starting with the previously described 859-bp enhancer Rous sarcoma virus fusion vector (13Brinkmeier M.L. Gordon D.F. Dowding J.M. Saunders T.L. Kendall S.K. Sarapura V.D. Wood W.M. Ridgway E.C. Camper S.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 622-633PubMed Google Scholar). To generate an enhancer/promoter plasmid containing sequences that extended downstream of position 859, we first subcloned, into pGEM7zf (Promega), a fragment that extended from −4600 to −3400 that was derived by KpnI and SphI digestion from a plasmid containing α-subunit sequences from −5000 to +43 (12Kendall S.K. Gordon D.F. Birkmeier T.S. Petrey D. Sarapura V.D. O'Shea K.S. Wood W.M. Lloyd R.V. Ridgway E.C. Camper S.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1420-1433PubMed Google Scholar). After sequencing this downstream 300-bp extension, we utilized PCR with this plasmid and a 5′ oligonucleotide that spanned the KpnI site at −4600 along with an antisense oligonucleotide that originated 237 bp downstream of the BglII site at −3700 with 5′-GCGGGATCCATAATTCACCTTTAGGGAGG-3′. Incorporation of aBamHI site (italicized) allowed the amplified product to be excised with KpnI and BamHI and inserted in the forward orientation between the same sites of the pSELECT plasmid containing the −341 to +43 α-subunit promoter sequence. The 3′ extended enhancer/promoter fusion region was then excised withKpnI and HindIII and cloned into pA3LUC as before. An α-subunit proximal promoter luciferase plasmid containing the 210-bp region inserted in the opposite orientation was constructed using the following PCR strategy. An oligonucleotide was synthesized that had the same sequence as the one described above that originated at position 649 of the 859-bp enhancer sequence, except that aBamHI site was incorporated at the 5′ end instead of aKpnI site. When this was used in PCR with an antisense oligonucleotide that spanned the downstream BglII site (at 859), it allowed the amplified product to be digested withBamHI and BglII and inserted at theBamHI site upstream of position −341 in the pSELECT plasmid containing this proximal promoter region. Because BamHI andBglII overhangs can anneal, it allowed the generation of enhancer/promoter fusions with the 210-bp region in both orientations. The reverse orientation was identified by sequencing, and the enhancer/promoter fragment was recloned into pA3LUC as described above. Transient transfections using electroporation for α-TSH (3 × 106), α-T3 (4 × 106), and GH3 (4 × 106) cells were performed as described previously (13Brinkmeier M.L. Gordon D.F. Dowding J.M. Saunders T.L. Kendall S.K. Sarapura V.D. Wood W.M. Ridgway E.C. Camper S.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 622-633PubMed Google Scholar,22Haugen B.R. Gordon D.F. Nelson A.R. Wood W.M. Ridgway E.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1574-1582PubMed Google Scholar). 20 μg of α-subunit promoter and enhancer/promoter luciferase constructs were used for the α-TSH and α-T3 cell transfections, and 2 μg of a cytomegalovirus β-galactosidase plasmid were included as an internal control of transfection efficiency. Transfections were carried out in duplicate with a Rous sarcoma virus promoter luciferase vector and a promoterless pA3LUC vector as positive and negative controls (20Wood W.M. Kao M.Y. Gordon D.F. Ridgway E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14840-14847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were performed a minimum of three times with at least two preparations of each plasmid. After 16–24 h, luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured from duplicate aliquots of freeze-thawed cytoplasmic lysates. Luciferase activities of the various enhancer/promoter constructs were normalized to the corresponding β-galactosidase value and expressed as the fold stimulation ± S.E. of the normalized activity of the −341 to +43 promoter in the various cell types. Nuclear extracts were prepared from dispersed TtT-97 thyrotropic tumors or α-TSH, α-T3, and GH3 cells as described previously (23Sarapura V.D. Wood W.M. Gordon D.F. Ridgway E.C. Thyroid. 1992; 2: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 24Wood W.M. Dowding J.M. Bright T.M. McDermott M.T. Haugen B.R. Gordon D.F. Ridgway E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24213-24220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cultured cells were placed in medium containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum for 48 h before harvesting for extract preparation. Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as a standard. The previously described pGEM5zf plasmid containing the 184-bp PstI fragment from position 649 to position 833 of the 859-bp enhancer region was digested withNotI and NdeI to generate a fragment for footprinting analysis that could be labeled uniquely at the upstream end using [α-32P]dGTP and dCTP to fill in theNotI overhang (GGCC). To generate a footprinting fragment that was labeled at the downstream position, we constructed a plasmid that contained a fragment extending from 649 to a position 100 bp 3′ of the BglII site. This was amplified by PCR from the previously described KpnI to SphI fragment containing vector using the KpnI 5′ tagged sense primer originating at 649 and an antisense amplimer with a 5′HindIII site (italicized) with the following sequence: 5′-GCGAAGCTTGGGGGAAATATCACTGCATG-3′. As before, excision with EcoRI and MluI enabled unique filling of theMluI overhang (CGCG) with [α-32P]dGTP and dCTP. This 3′ extension allowed the area immediately 5′ of theBglII site to be displayed in an optimal area of the footprint gel. DNase I protection assays were carried out as described previously (24Wood W.M. Dowding J.M. Bright T.M. McDermott M.T. Haugen B.R. Gordon D.F. Ridgway E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24213-24220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, radiolabeled probes were allowed to interact with 10 μg of bovine serum albumin (no extract) or 60–70 μg of nuclear extract protein derived from TtT-97, α-TSH, α-T3, or GH3 cells, subjected to DNase I digestion under defined conditions, and analyzed on a denaturing 5% polyacrylamide-8 m urea gel. Previous transgenic and transient transfection data indicated that sequences required for the enhancement of the α-subunit proximal promoter specifically in thyrotropes and gonadotropes were present in a KpnI–BglII fragment located between −4.6 and −3.7 kilobase pairs upstream of the transcriptional start site (13Brinkmeier M.L. Gordon D.F. Dowding J.M. Saunders T.L. Kendall S.K. Sarapura V.D. Wood W.M. Ridgway E.C. Camper S.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 622-633PubMed Google Scholar). To further localize the sequences responsible for enhancement within this 859-bp region, subfragments of the KpnI–BglII fragment were fused to the −341 to +43 proximal promoter region and analyzed independently for their ability to enhance in both thyrotrope- and gonadotrope-derived cells. The results of this analysis are shown in Fig.1. A strategy that involved progressively deleting sequences from the 5′ end demonstrated that the enhancing effect of the 859-bp area previously reported in both thyrotrope-derived α-TSH cells and gonadotrope-derived α-T3 cells (13Brinkmeier M.L. Gordon D.F. Dowding J.M. Saunders T.L. Kendall S.K. Sarapura V.D. Wood W.M. Ridgway E.C. Camper S.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 622-633PubMed Google Scholar) could be entirely accounted for by the most proximal 210 bp from 649 to 859. The lack of other areas eliciting any enhancing capability was further confirmed by showing that neither of two PstI fragments, which comprised all but the terminal 69 bp of the sequence upstream of position 654, exhibited any capacity to stimulate the proximal promoter (Fig. 1). Because the sequences responsible for the stimulatory effect appeared to map to the region immediately 5′ of theBglII site at −3700 (13Brinkmeier M.L. Gordon D.F. Dowding J.M. Saunders T.L. Kendall S.K. Sarapura V.D. Wood W.M. Ridgway E.C. Camper S.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 622-633PubMed Google Scholar), we thought it important to determine if sequences immediately downstream of the BglII site could further augment the previously observed enhancement. Therefore, a larger fragment from −4600 to −3400 was generated from a previously described α-subunit genomic clone (12Kendall S.K. Gordon D.F. Birkmeier T.S. Petrey D. Sarapura V.D. O'Shea K.S. Wood W.M. Lloyd R.V. Ridgway E.C. Camper S.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1420-1433PubMed Google Scholar), and PCR was used to amplify a fragment that extended more proximally to a position 237 bp downstream of the BglII site. This was inserted upstream of −341 in the proximal α-subunit promoter, and the stimulatory effect of this 3′ augmented enhancer region was compared with the previous 859-bp area. The results of this analysis revealed no further enhancement in either cell type when the enhancer region fused to the proximal promoter-included sequences 3′ of the BglII site (data not shown). Therefore, the sequences mediating enhancement appear to be entirely contained within the previously determined 210-bp area. The nucleotide sequence of the 210-bp region that accounts for all of the enhancer activity of the upstream 5′ region of the mouse α-subunit gene is shown in Fig. 2. Nucleotides 649–859 of the previously described 859-bp enhancer region redesignated 1–210 are shown. The sequence shaded in graydenotes the location of a 60-bp sequence that is 60–70% homologous to other sequences that occur within several reported rodent genes as revealed by a GenBankTM search. Boxed andlabeled sequences correspond to consensus binding sites for several transcription factors that have been reported previously to play a role in the activity of the proximal α-subunit promoter (17Barnhart K.M.

These include several binding sites for GATA and ETS factors. Also present are two E-box motifs (CANNTG) and single sites that could potentially interact with Pit-1, Sp1, and nuclear hormone receptor family members such as the steroidogenic factor SF-1. A proximal promoter area from −213 to −200 that binds SF-1 (the GSE) has been reported by our group (14Wood W.M. Dowding J.M. Sarapura V.D. McDermott M.T. Gordon D.F. Ridgway E.C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 142: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and by others (5Horn F. Windle J.J. Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell.

Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 878-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) to be critical for both basal and enhancer-stimulated α-subunit promoter activity in gonadotrope cells. To begin to investigate which proteins are interacting with the 210-bp region and could perhaps be playing a role in the enhancement of the proximal promoter, we performed a comparative DNase I footprinting analysis using nuclear extracts derived from pituitary cells that express the endogenous α-subunit gene (TtT-97 thyrotropic tumor, α-TSH and α-T3 cells) as well as those that do not (somatotrope-derived GH3 cells). Fig. 3shows the results of this analysis using fragments encompassing the 210-bp region that have been labeled at either the upstream (A) or downstream (B) position. In Fig.3 A, which utilized a 184-bp PstI fragment that terminates 26 bp from the proximal end of the fully enhancing region (see Fig. 2), protection from DNase I digestion can be seen in three general areas. Using DNA size standards loaded in a parallel lane (Stds) the approximate location of the footprinted areas are from 77 to 112, from 132 to 150, and from 152 to 178 on the antisense strand. No protection by any extract was evident upstream of position 77. The area from 77 to 112 appears to be similarly protected by the two thyrotrope cell extracts (TtT-97 and α-TSH), but the footprint generated by α-T3 nuclear extracts, although overlapping the thyrotrope footprint, appears to be less well protected for the most proximal 10 bp, suggesting that a different factor(s) present in each cell type may be interacting at this region. As shown in Fig. 2, this area contains sequences that correspond to binding sites for both E-box and Ets factors. When the sense strand labeled at the downstream position was analyzed, the same overall area was protected (Fig.3 B), but the area from 74 to 129 was subdivided into three clearly defined footprints from 74 to 86, from 92 to 105, and from 109 to 129. The first two were seen with all of the extracts, including those from GH3 cells. These encompass the upstream E-box and Ets sites. The protected area from 109 to 129, which contained a second Ets site, was observed with both thyrotrope-derived cell nuclear extracts (TtT-97 and α-TSH) but appeared not to be protected by either α-T3 or GH3 nuclear extracts. Two other more downstream footprints from 133 to 147 and from 152 to 178 that were also seen with the other strand were also protected by all of the extracts, including those from GH3 cells. These footprints contain a second E-box motif and potential binding sites for GATA factors, Sp1 and SF1. It is of interest that parts of the area of the enhancer that interact with the pituitary cell nuclear extracts colocalize with the 60-bp region that is repeated elsewhere in the mouse genome, shown in Fig. 2 as a gray box. A surprising observation resulting from these protein-DNA binding experiments suggests that non-α-subunit-expressing pituitary GH3 cells may contain factors that interact with the enhancer region, and thus such factors are not confined to cell types that express the endogenous gene, i.e. thyrotropes and gonadotropes. The finding that nuclear proteins from somatotrope-derived GH3 cells, which do not express the α-subunit, bind to sequences within a region that is involved in the activation of proximal α-subunit promoter activity in homologous α-TSH and α-T3 cells prompted us to investigate whether the upstream 210-bp area was also capable of enhancement in GH3 cells. We had previously shown that in non-pituitary CV-1 monkey kidney cells, the larger 859-bp region only modestly stimulated the proximal α-subunit promoter, although it was capable of enhancing the activity of a viral promoter in a cell type-independent fashion (13Brinkmeier M.L. Gordon D.F. Dowding J.M. Saunders T.L. Kendall S.K. Sarapura V.D. Wood W.M. Ridgway E.C. Camper S.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 622-633PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4shows the effect of the 210-bp area on the proximal α-subunit promoter in GH3 cells compared with that previously seen in α-TSH and α-T3 cells. As shown before, the 210-bp area confers a 25- and 7-fold stimulation to the proximal promoter in α-TSH and α-T3 cells, respectively. However, in the non-α-subunit-expressing pituitary-derived GH3 cells, the upstream 210-bp region dramatically inhibits the activity of the proximal promoter by 75% (note that the scale of the x axis in Fig. 4 is not linear). Therefore, the upstream regulatory region serves a role not only to activate α-subunit expression in α-subunit-expressing cell types but also to repress it in another pituitary cell type that does not express t"

This approach was previously proven as a useful tool for detection of tertiary structure modifications induced by an interaction between a protein and its specific ligand. Deuterium/hydrogen exchange kinetic measurements indicated that, in the absence of Ca2+, a large fraction of the protein (40%) is inaccessible to solvent.

A hypothetical membrane topology model was proposed based on hydropathy profile analysis of the exchanger's amino acid sequence, in which 11 α-helical membrane-spanning segments are predicted (5 in the NH2- and 6 in the COOH-terminal portion), separated by a large hydrophilic cytoplasmic loop. The NH2 terminus is extracytoplasmic and the COOH terminus intracytoplasmic (13Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Beside these predictions, the exchanger secondary and tertiary structure are poorly understood. Topological models describing polypeptide chain insertion in the membrane are all based on the assumption that membrane-spanning segments would have an α-helical structure (15Addison R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14896-14901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,16Hager M.H. Mandala S.M. Davenport J.W. Speicher D.W. Benz E.J. Slayman C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nestel U. Welte W. Weckesser J. Schulz G.E. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Likewise, the erythrocyte glucose transporter might fold into membrane β-barrels (18Fischbarg J. Cheung M. Czegledy F. Li J. Iserovich P. Kuang K. Hubbard J. Garner M. Rosen O.M. Golde D.W. Vera J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11658-11662Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and the acetylcholine receptor transmembrane domain might contain β-sheets instead of the expected α-helices (19Unwin N. J. Mol.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 338-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that α-helices may not be the only secondary structure for protein transmembrane segments. Two Na+/Ca2+ exchange reaction mechanisms are possible for Na+-Ca2+ countertransport across the membrane: simultaneous or consecutive kinetics. Strong experimental evidence favors a consecutive ion-transport scheme for the cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (21Khananshvili D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2437-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 22Khananshvili D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13764-13769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hilgemann D.W. Collins A. Cash D.P. Nagel G.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 639: 126-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a simultaneous transport mechanism is suggested for the exchanger in ferret red blood cells (24Milanick M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C185-C193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1summarizes a consecutive reaction scheme for Na+/Ca2+ exchange in the forward mode, characterized by 2 different conformations (E 1and E 2) (25Philipson K.D. Nicoll D.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 137: 199-227Google Scholar). The secondary and tertiary structure changes implicated in the transition from theE 1 to the E 2 conformation of the exchanger have not been investigated yet, and the effect of ion-binding on induction or stabilization of one of the conformations remains to be elucidated.Ca2+i regulation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity was studied in cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles. The cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger has an intracellular regulatory site with high Ca2+ affinity, located between amino acids 445 and 455 (26Hale C.C. Bliler S. Quinn T.P. Peletskaya E.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Regulation can be summarized as follows: a Ca2+i decrease inactivates Na+-Ca2+ exchange (27Dipolo R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1979; 73: 91-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 28Dipolo R. Beaugé L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 854: 298-306Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 29Dipolo R. Beaugé L.

Bollen A. Herchuelz A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 139-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein has a Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity and is oriented inside-out, i.e. with the large hydrophilic loop, between transmembrane segments, protruding to the outside of the vesicles (30Saba R.I. Bollen A. Herchuelz A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 139-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the secondary structure of the 70-kDa protein is determined by FTIR-ATR, 1The abbreviations used are: FTIR-ATR, Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflection; Cao, extracellular calcium ions; 2H/H, deuterium/hydrogen; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Nai, intracellular sodium ions; PMCA, plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase1The abbreviations used are: FTIR-ATR, Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflection; Cao, extracellular calcium ions; 2H/H, deuterium/hydrogen; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Nai, intracellular sodium ions; PMCA, plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPasewhich is a reliable technique to estimate membrane protein secondary structure and orientation in the lipid bilayer (31Goormaghtigh E.

Tertiary structure modifications were investigated by monitoring2H/H exchange rate for the reconstituted exchanger in the absence and presence of Ca2+. FTIR-ATR spectra reveal that 44% of the protein is α-helical, 25% β-sheets, 16% β-turns, and 15% random coils. 2H/H exchange measurements show that upon Ca2+ addition, a major conformational change occurs, characterized by a 15% reduction in solvent accessibility of the 70-kDa protein.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Bovine Heart Sarcolemmal VesiclesHighly purified sarcolemmal vesicles were isolated from bovine heart left ventricle as described previously (35Philipson K.D. Ward R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 897: 152-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 36Cheon J. Reeves J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2309-2315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications (30Saba R.I. Bollen A. Herchuelz A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 139-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Purification and Reconstitution of the Na+/Ca2+ Exchanger ProteinWe have purified and reconstituted the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger using a previously published protocol (10Philipson K.D. Longoni S. Robert W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 945: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 30Saba R.I. Bollen A. Herchuelz A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 139-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bio-Beads SM-2 (Bio-Rad) were used for Triton X-100 removal to favor proteoliposomes formation. When reconstituted proteins were used for ATR-IR measurements, the Bio-Beads were soaked and washed in 0.5 mm MOPS solution (pH 7.4, 37 °C) before incubation with the asolectin/purified protein mixture, at variance with previously described methods (30Saba R.I. Bollen A. Herchuelz A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 139-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein/asolectin preparation was loaded on top of the Bio-Beads columns and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Proteoliposomes were collected by centrifugation of the columns for 1 min at 1000 × g. Aliquots were pooled, diluted in 0.5 mm MOPS (pH 7.4, 37 °C) solution, and centrifuged at 140,000 × g for 90 min (4 °C) to pellet the reconstituted protein. This last centrifugation step was repeated twice to ensure the complete removal of all ion traces remaining in the supernatant from the pelleted protein-lipid complex. Finally, proteoliposomes were resuspended in 50 μl of the same solution and stored at −70 °C until use.Na+/Ca2+ Exchange Activity MeasurementsNa+/Ca2+ exchange activity in reconstituted proteoliposomes was measured as Nai-dependent 45Cao uptake using two previously described protocols (35Philipson K.D. Ward R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 897: 152-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 36Cheon J. Reeves J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2309-2315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, in the first protocol, reconstituted vesicles (50 μl) were loaded with Na+ and diluted in Ca2+ uptake medium (140 mm KCl, 0.01 mm CaCl2, 0.3 μCi of45CaCl2, 0.36 μm valinomycin) to initiate Na+i-dependent45Ca2+o uptake. The uptake reaction was quenched after 3 s by addition of 30 μl of 140 mm KCl, 10 mm EGTA followed by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold 140 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA. Samples were then filtered using 0.22-μm nitrocellulose filters (Sartorius) and filters were washed with 2 × 3 ml of ice-cold 140 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA (10Philipson K.D. Longoni S. Robert W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 945: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In the second protocol, a similar procedure was used except that Ca2+o uptake reaction was stopped after 3 s by addition of 5 ml of ice-cold 140 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA and vesicles were harvested by filtration on Whatmann GF/A filters previously soaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine in H2O. The filters were then washed with 2 × 5 ml of ice-cold 140 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, avoiding filter drying between rinses. In both protocols, blanks were obtained by replacing KCl by NaCl in the 45Ca2+ uptake medium. All solutions were buffered with 10 mm MOPS/Tris, pH 7.4.Infrared Attenuated Total Reflection SpectroscopySample Preparation20 to 50 μl of sample was deposited on one side of the ATR germanium plate and was slowly evaporated, under a stream of nitrogen, yielding a dry thin film of reconstituted protein sample. The internal reflection element (ATR plate) is a germanium plate (50 × 20 × 2 mm, Harrick EJ 2121) with an aperture angle of 45°, yielding 25 internal reflections (37Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.-M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The ATR plate was then sealed in a universal sample holder (Perkin-Elmer 186–0354).Secondary Structure AnalysisThe sample on the ATR plate was deuterated by flushing with a2H2O-saturated nitrogen stream for at least 2 h. Deuterium/hydrogen (2H/H) exchange allows differentiation of α-helical secondary structures from a random one (38Susi H. Timaseff S.N. Stevens L. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5460-5466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by shift of the absorption band of the former from 1,655 to approximately 1,642 cm−1. Spectra were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer infrared spectrophotometer FTIR 1720x equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled MCT detector. The nominal resolution was 4 cm−1. The spectrophotometer recording chamber was continuously flushed with dry air to remove atmospheric water vapor. Each measurement corresponded to an average of 128 scans. Quantitative assessment of the protein secondary structure (α-helices, β-sheets, β-turns, and random coils) was carried out using a combination of resolution enhancement method and a band fitting procedure described earlier (34Cabiaux V.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24617-24624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).Orientation of the Secondary StructureDetermination of peptide orientation by infrared ATR spectroscopy was performed as described previously (42Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.-M. Brasseur R. Molecular Description of Biological Components by Computer-aided Conformational Analysis. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 285-329Google Scholar, 40Vigneron L. Ruysschaert J.-M. Goormaghtigh E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17685-17696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, spectra were recorded with a parallel and perpendicular polarization with respect to the incidence plane. Then, the dichroism spectrum was obtained by subtracting the perpendicular polarized spectrum from the parallel one. A larger absorbance of the parallel polarization indicates a dipole oriented preferentially parallel to the normal to the ATR plate; whereas, a larger absorbance of the perpendicular polarization indicates a dipole orientation close to the plane of the ATR plate. It has been shown that in α-helices, amide I dipole orientation makes a 27° angle with respect to the helix axis and that the β-sheet long axis is mainly perpendicular to the amide C = O axis (43Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.-M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 329-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar).Deuteration KineticsFilms containing 10–20 μg of protein were prepared on a germanium plate as described above. Nitrogen gas was saturated with 2H2O (by bubbling through a series of three 2H2O-containing vials) at a flow rate of 90 ml/min (controlled by a Brooks flow-meter). Bubbling was started at least 1 h before starting the experiment,i.e. before connecting the tubing carrying the2H2O-saturated nitrogen flux to the sealed microchamber containing the sample film. Before starting2H/H exchange measurements, 10 spectra of nondeuterated dried sample on ATR plates were recorded to verify measurement stability and reproducibility of band area computation. Att = 0, the tubing was connected to the sealed microchamber containing the studied sample. For each kinetic point, 12 spectra, with a 4 cm−1 resolution, were recorded and averaged. Spectra were recorded every 15 s for the first 2 min. After which, the recording time interval was exponentially increased. After 16 min, the time interval between scans was large enough to allow the insertion of another 2H/H exchange kinetics. Thus, a second sample, prepared on another ATR setup of the Perkin-Elmer shuttle was analyzed with the same time sampling (with a 16-min offset) by connecting the 2H2O-saturated nitrogen flux in series with the first sample. Accordingly, our software changed the shuttle position to follow both kinetics (43Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.-M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 329-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 44Goormaghtigh E. Vigneron L. Scarborough G. Ruysschaert J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27409-27413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our case, the first sample was the reconstituted Na+/Ca2+exchanger in the absence of ligands (see reconstitution protocol), and the second sample had 0.2 mm CaCl2 added.The spectrophotometer chamber was flushed with dry air for 20 min before starting the experiment. However, further removal of traces of water vapor occurred as the 2H/H exchange kinetics proceeded, superimposing water vapor's sharp bands onto the protein spectra (45Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.-M. Spectrochim. Acta Part A Mol. Spectrosc. 1994; 50: 2137-3144Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Atmospheric water contribution was subtracted as described (45Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.-M. Spectrochim. Acta Part A Mol. Spectrosc. 1994; 50: 2137-3144Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Areas of the amide I, II, and II′ bands were obtained by integration between 1,702 and 1,596, 1,596 and 1,502, and 1,492 and 1,412 cm−1, respectively. The amide II area was divided by the corresponding lipid ν(C = O) area which allowed us to take into account small, but significant, variations in the overall spectra intensity due to sample layer swelling caused by the presence of2H2O. Indeed, ATR spectrum intensity highly depends on the distance between sample layer and germanium plate surface (46Harrick N.J. Internal Reflexion Spectroscopy. J. Wiley & Sons, New York1967Google Scholar); and, as this distance increases by sample swelling, the spectrum intensity decreases by a few percent for all measured bands.The 0% deuterated sample spectra were recorded before starting the2H/H exchange kinetics as described above, and the 100% deuterated sample value was extrapolated by assuming a zero value for the amide II band area. Accordingly, throughout the kinetics, the amide II band area (normalized to the lipid ν(C = O) area) was expressed between 0 and 100% deuteration for each kinetic point.Statistics and CalculationsAll data are presented as mean ± S.E.DISCUSSIONThe aim of this work was to study the secondary structure of the purified and reconstituted 70-kDa bovine heart Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, the orientation of protein secondary structure in the lipid vesicle membrane, and possible secondary/tertiary structure changes in the presence of Ca2+ ion. Whereas the protein secondary structure is not significantly modified upon specific ligand addition, amide2H/H exchange experiments provided information as to solvent accessibility to protein amide group, allowing detection of conformational changes and quantification of the number of amino acid residues involved. Comparison of FTIR-ATR experiments carried out on film with data obtained in solution by FTIR or NMR studies demonstrate the validity of this approach (48de Jongh H. Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.-M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 49.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar, 50.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar).Recently, we have purified and characterized a unique 70-kDa polypeptide that retained Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity when reconstituted into asolectin vesicles and that corresponded to the NH2 terminus portion of the exchanger (30Saba R.I. Bollen A. Herchuelz A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 139-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the reconstitution protocol, we used a lipid:protein ratio of ∼7:1 to obtain a homogeneous population of reconstituted protein (inserted inside-out), which is essential for such structural studies (30Saba R.I. Bollen A. Herchuelz A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 139-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Vigneron L. Ruysschaert J.-M. Goormaghtigh E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24617-24624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).Analysis of ATR-FTIR results provides information on the secondary and tertiary structure of the reconstituted active exchanger. The estimated secondary structure of the protein was evaluated to be 44% α-helices, 25% β-sheets, 16% β-turns, and 15% random structures (Table I).Because the 70-kDa polypeptide, studied herein, has only the 5 NH2-terminal membrane-spanning segments compared with the entire exchanger (30Saba R.I. Bollen A. Herchuelz A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 139-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and assuming that those 5 segments are α-helical, the 70-kDa protein should be constituted of at least 18% α-helices. The proportion of α-helices determined in this study (44%) is markedly higher. This discrepancy between hydropathy plot estimations and experimental secondary structure assignment has been previously observed for other ion transporting membrane proteins (40Vigneron L. Ruysschaert J.-M. Goormaghtigh E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17685-17696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar,41Sonveaux N. Shapiro A.B. Goormaghtigh E. Ling V.

Chem. 1997; 272: 262-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for this difference could be that protein topology models based on hydropathy profile analysis underestimate the proportion of transmembrane domains (assuming those domains as exclusively α-helical) and/or that ordered α-helical structures are present outside the lipid bilayer. TableIII compares the secondary structure proportions of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger with those of other proteins such as the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) (53.Raussens, V., Stucture et toplogie de l'ATPase gastrique et des intermédiaires impliqués dans son cycle catalytique, Ph.D thesis, 1997, Université Libre de Bruxelles, Faculty of Sciences.Google Scholar), Na+/K+-ATPase (54Heimburg T.

A very high similarity between the secondary structure of the 70-kDa polypeptide Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and that of PMCA can be observed (92% of similarity between structures, 96% for β-sheet structures, 81% for β-turn structures, and 93% for random structures). This high similarity may reflect a homology between the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and the PMCA secondary structure (55Strehler E.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 120: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), especially at the level of secondary structure organization of their intracytoplasmic domains. The 70-kDa polypeptide also shows high similarity with secondary structure proportions of P-type ion-transporting ATPases. Interestingly, addition of Ca2+ (0.2 mm) does not alter the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger secondary structure (TableI) which is an observation common to P-glycoprotein (41Sonveaux N. Shapiro A.B.

https://openalex.org/W2075060380,"Using primary fibroblasts in culture, we have investigated the signal transduction mechanisms by which phorbol esters, a class of tumor promoters, activate the 9E3 gene and its chemokine product the chicken chemotactic and angiogenic factor. This gene is highly stimulated by phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) via three pathways: (i) a small contribution through protein kinase C (the commonly recognized pathway for these tumor promoters), (ii) a contribution involving tyrosine kinases, and (iii) a larger contribution via pathways that can be interrupted by dexamethasone. All three of these pathways converge into the mitogen-activated protein kinases, MEK1/ERK2. Using a luciferase reporter system, we show that although both the AP-1 and PDRIIkB (a NFκB-like factor in chickens) response elements are capable of activation in these normal cells, regions of the 9E3 promoter containing them are unresponsive to PDBu stimulation. In contrast, we show for the first time that activation by PDBu occurs through a segment of the promoter containing Elk1 response elements; deletion and mutation of these elements abrogates 9E3/chicken chemotactic and angiogenic factor expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and functional studies using PathDetect systems show that stimulation of the cells by phorbol esters leads to activation of the Elk1 transcription factor, which binds to its element in the 9E3 promoter. Using primary fibroblasts in culture, we have investigated the signal transduction mechanisms by which phorbol esters, a class of tumor promoters, activate the 9E3 gene and its chemokine product the chicken chemotactic and angiogenic factor.

It has been known for some time that chemokines play important roles in leukocyte chemoattraction and inflammation (1Horuk R. Horuk R. Chemoattractant Ligands and Their Receptors. CRC Press, New York1996Google Scholar). More recently, however, it has become increasingly clear that these small cytokines are also involved in wound healing (2Martins-Green M. Hanafusa H. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), deterrence of retroviral infections (3Feng Y. Broder C.C. Kennedy P.E. Berger E.A. Science. 1996; 272: 872-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (3643) Google Scholar), and tumorigenesis (4Richmond A. Shattuck R.L. Horuk R. Chemoattractant Ligands and Their Receptors.

In the latter case, chemokines can potentially act at several steps in the development of tumors, and their action is dependent not only on the stimulant but also on the environment. Tumors develop as a result of multiple insults and chemokines could play important roles in these events because a number of them are stimulated by phorbol esters, injury, and oncogenes (2Martins-Green M. Hanafusa H. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), all of which have been shown to be involved in tumor promotion. Agents that promote tumor development are called tumor promoters; they are not themselves carcinogenic but they promote the development of tumors in areas of the body that have been exposed to a carcinogen (6Kligman A.M. Kligman L.H. Cancer Lett. 1994; 87: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 7Jenkins T.D. Nakagawa H. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24433-24442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). There is extensive literature that demonstrates that phorbol esters are very effective tumor promoters (8Iversen O.H. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1995; 6: 357-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 9Xian W. Kiguchi K. Imamoto A. Rupp T. Zilberstein A. DiGiovanni J. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1447-1455PubMed Google Scholar). Wounding is also a tumor promoter because it can cause cancer to develop at the edges of wounds inflicted in areas that have been exposed previously to a carcinogen (10Lacey M. Alpert S. Hanahan D. Nature. 1986; 322: 609-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 11Sieweke M.H. Stoker A.W. Bissell M.J. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6419-6424PubMed Google Scholar, 12DiGiovanni J. Bhatt T.S.

Trempus C.S. Szczesniak C.J. Virgil K.M. Humble M.C. Tennant R.W. Mol. Carcinogen. 1997; 20: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The v-src oncogene, which is the transforming protein of the Rous sarcoma virus (a retrovirus that causes tumors in chickens), also has been shown to be a tumor promoter (16Bissell M.J. Hatie C. Calvin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The 9E3 gene and its product, the chicken chemotactic and angiogenic factor (cCAF), 1The abbreviations used are: cCAF, chicken chemotactic and angiogenic factor; PKC, protein kinase C; PDBu, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; CEF, chicken embryo fibroblasts; qc, quiescent confluent; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pairs; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; dbd, DNA binding domain; AD, activation domain; LPS, lipopolysaccharide, Luc, luciferase; AP1, activating protein 1 are stimulated to high levels by the v-src oncogene and also by phorbol esters and wounding/inflammation (17Sugano S.

Therefore, this chemokine can potentially be a mediator of the tumor-promoting action of these agents. In the case of v-src, during the development of Rous sarcoma virus-induced tumors the expression of the 9E3/cCAF occurs only in the cells of the tissues surrounding the tumor (19Martins-Green M. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 581-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Martins-Green M. Aotaki-Keen A. Hjelmeland L. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 701-707PubMed Google Scholar). At later stages of tumor growth, when 9E3/cCAF are expressed abundantly, numerous new blood vessels develop in the area (2Martins-Green M. Hanafusa H. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 19Martins-Green M. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 581-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Martins-Green M. Aotaki-Keen A. Hjelmeland L. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 701-707PubMed Google Scholar). Because cCAF is angiogenic (22Martins-Green M. Feugate J.E. Cytokine. 1998; 8: 522-535Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 23Martins-Green M. Kelly T. Cytokine. 1998; 8: 819-829Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and angiogenesis is very important for tumor growth, it is possible that this chemokine is a mediator of the tumor-promoting actions of the v-src oncogene. In the case of wounding, we have shown that after injury the 9E3gene is highly expressed shortly after injury and in the granulation (repair) tissue during wound healing (19Martins-Green M. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 581-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Martins-Green M. Aotaki-Keen A. Hjelmeland L. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 701-707PubMed Google Scholar). The persistent expression of 9E3/cCAF during the healing process coupled with its angiogenic properties in tissues that have been exposed to a carcinogen could mediate the tumor promotion stimulated by wounding. The stimulation of 9E3/cCAF to high levels by phorbol esters, again coupled to its angiogenic properties, can potentially mediate the tumor-promoting actions of these molecules. Until recently, it was believed that gene activation by phorbol esters always involves PKCs (24Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). PKCs are a family of serine and threonine kinases that contain structural motifs with a high degree of sequence homology. Most PKC isoenzymes have a conserved cysteine-rich (C1) domain at the N terminus of the regulatory domain (25Newton A.C. Current Biol. 1995; 5: 973-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The C1 domain is involved in binding to diacylglycerol or its potent functional analogues, the phorbol esters, resulting in the translocation of the enzyme to the plasma membrane. The binding also causes a conformational change in PKC that removes the pseudo substrate domain from the active site, allowing substrate binding and catalysis (26Jaken S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 8: 168-173Crossref Scopus (407) Google Scholar). However, several receptors of phorbol esters that are not PKCs now have been identified (25Newton A.C. Current Biol. 1995; 5: 973-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Examples are n-chimaerin (27Hall C. Monfries C. Smith P. Lim H.H. Kozma R. Ahmed S. Vanniasingham V. Leung T. Lim L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), Unc-13 (28Maruyama I.N. Brenner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5729-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), Vav (29Gulbins E. Coggeshall K.M. Baier G. Telford D. Langlet C. Baier-Bitterlich G. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Burn P. Wittinghofer A. Altman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4749-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), cathepsin-L (30Atkins K.B. Troen B.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 713-718PubMed Google Scholar), and protein kinase D (31Van Lint J.V. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus it is clear that not all of the cellular effects of phorbol esters are mediated via PKC. As a consequence, it is important to delineate the signal transduction pathways by which chemokines are turned on by these agents so that crucial steps in the activation process can be identified and potentially used as targets for regulation of these genes. We have investigated the pathway of activation of 9E3/cCAF by phorbol esters such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) in primary fibroblasts, the cells that most highly express 9E3/cCAF in vivo. The work presented here shows that activation of this chemokine by phorbol esters involves multiple signaling pathways that culminate in phosphorylation and activation of the MAP kinase ERK2 followed by activation of the transcription factor Elk1, leading to9E3/cCAF expression. The dosages used for particular experiments are indicated in the text or in the figure captions. Bovine thrombin (Sigma) was reconstituted in water and used at 9 units/ml. Calphostin C (100–200 nm), genistein (15–25 μm), H-7 di-HCL (100–200 nm), tyrphostin AG1478 (5–500 nm), and PD98059 (10 μm) were all purchased from Calbiochem and reconstituted in Me2SO. Phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate and 4α-phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (Biomol) were dissolved in Me2SO and used at 5–100 nm. Anti-phosphotyrosine PY20 (Transduction Laboratories) and 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) were used for the phosphotyrosine immunoblots. ECL reagents and secondary antibodies were conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For each inhibitor or activator, a range of doses was tested to determine the optimal dose for the study in question. The Bradford assay was performed using the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Primary cultures of chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) were prepared from 10-day-old chicken embryos as described previously (32Bissell M.J. Farson D. Tung A.S-C. J. Supramol. Struct. 1977; 6: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). On the fourth day, secondary cultures were prepared by trypsinizing and plating the primary cells in 199 medium containing 0.3% tryptose phosphate broth and 2% donor calf serum at a density of 1.2 × 106/60-mm dish. To study the effects of phorbol esters, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, PMA, or PDBu on 9E3 expression and cCAF production, we used quiescent confluent CEF (qcCEF) cultures and incubated them in serum-free 199 medium containing the specific treatment for varying times (see “Results” for specifics). In general, prior to the addition of the specific activator cells were incubated in serum-free 199 medium containing the appropriate inhibitor for 30 min; incubation at 37 °C was continued for 1 h more before removing the medium and replacing it with fresh serum-free medium containing again the specific inhibitor under study. At the end of the incubation period the supernatant was collected and processed as described earlier (33Vaingankar S.M. Martins-Green M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5226-5234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Pretreatment with phorbol esters to down-regulate PKC activity in the cells was performed for 18–24 h and then removed and replaced with medium containing the appropriate treatment for 18 h when evaluating cCAF levels. In the cases where the cell extracts were analyzed for activation of the ERKs, the cells were pretreated with the PDBu for 24 h, the inhibitor of MEK1/ERK (PD98059) for 1 h, and then the activator, PDBu, at 5 mm for 5 min. Because qcCEFs are primary cells rather than a cell line, there are small variations in the basal levels of 9E3/cCAF expression from batch to batch of cells. Therefore, for each experiment and/or treatment of a different batch of cells, we used positive (treated cells) and negative (untreated cells) controls. Volumes of the cell culture supernatant corresponding to equal amounts of protein in the cell extracts were loaded on 20% polyacrylamide-glycerol gels and electrophoresed at 16–32 mA for about 3 h. The concentration of the protein was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein kit. Transfer was performed using a semi-dry transfer apparatus (Millipore). The efficiency and consistency of the transfer was monitored by silver-staining the gel after the transfer. The 9E3 protein was detected using polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbit (34Martins-Green M. Stoeckle M. Hampe A. Wimberly S. Hanafusa H. Cytokine. 1996; 8: 448-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). CEFs were homogenized and total RNA was prepared using triZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA samples (10 μg/ml) were denatured in a formamide-formaldehyde buffer containing ethidium bromide and separated on formaldehyde-agarose gel. After electrophoresis, the RNA was transferred to MagnaGraph nylon membranes (MSI Inc.), which were photographed to visualize the quality of the rRNA and confirm equal loading and even transfer. The RNA was UV-cross-linked to the membrane for 2 min and baked at 80 °C for 2 h. Prehybridization was performed for 6–9 h, and hybridization with a cDNA probe was carried out for 24 h (33Vaingankar S.M. Martins-Green M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5226-5234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared by lysing the cells in boiling 2× Laemmli buffer (containing 100 μm sodium orthovanadate) and shearing by passing through a 26-gauge needle 10 times followed by boiling in a water bath for 5 min. The samples were electrophoresed on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) using a wet-transfer system (Bio-Rad) and Towbin's buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 192 mmglycine, 0.05% SDS, 2% methanol) for 13 h at 30 V or 5 h at 60 V at 4 °C. The blots were blocked for 2 h at 37 °C in TBS (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2.7 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% Tween 20, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% thimerosal (TBST-BSA) and then incubated with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (PY20 at 1:2500, 4G10 at 1:1000 dilutions) in TBST containing 2% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 37 °C. The excess antibodies were washed three times for 5 min each plus a longer 20 min wash with TBST. A second blocking step was done for 1 h with TBST containing 5% nonfat milk. This was followed by incubation with the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000) for 1 h at room temperature. The washings were performed as described for the primary antibodies. The antibody detection was done using ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For reprobing of the blots, the membranes were stripped by incubation in stripping buffer (100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7) at 50 °C for 30 min with gentle shaking and then washed (2× for 10 min each) with TBST, following which they were tested by ECL to ensure complete stripping of antibodies. Finally, the membranes were washed again with TBST (three times for 10 min) before proceeding with the reprobing. Microdensitometry analysis was performed by laser densitometric scanning in an LKB microdensitometer. Using PCR, we isolated a 1.5-kilobase pair DNA fragment from the immediate 5′-upstream region of the 9E3 gene (−1506 to +32). We used chicken genomic DNA as a template and two oligonucleotides (5′-primer, GGATGAATGGCATTTCAGTGCAC; 3′-primer, TCGACACTAGAGAGGACAGTCTCCT) for the PCR reactions that were performed under the following conditions: denaturing of the DNA at 94 °C for 5 min, 55 °C for ∼20 min to add, and then 94 °C for 40 s to ensure that the DNA was denatured before starting the annealing for 2 min at 55 °C and extension for 1.5 min at 72 °C. The 1.5-kilobase pair PCR product was then cloned using the AT cloning system pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and sequenced with the UBI Sequenase kit using vector primers and internal primers. The sequence was confirmed to be correct by comparison with the published sequence (35Blobel G.A. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1162-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The 1.5-kilobase pair9E3 promoter region was subcloned into pSL1180 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the SacI and EcoRV and then subcloned into the pGL3 basic vector (Promega) usingXhoI and BglII. Using this vector we obtained constructs with −66 to +32 bp, −218 to +32 bp, −470 to +32bp, and −683 to +32 bp fragments upstream from the initiation site with restriction enzyme digests and religations. We created the −493 Elk1 binding element mutant (pmElk1) by PCR-based methods. 5′-primer ATacGcgTGCTTTTAATACTGCACCCT was used to substitute the Elk1-conserved binding element (underlined; original sequence, CAGGAT). The controls for this mutated promoter, −542 to +32 bp and −495 to +32 bp, were also obtained using PCR and the appropriate oligonucleotides. The PCR products were cloned into the PCR2.1 vector and sequenced to verify accuracy.KpnI/EcoRV (on pCR2.1) andKpnI/SmaI (on pGL3 basic) were used for further reporter construction. The reporter vector with the mutated AP-1 binding site (−114 to −107) was prepared directly from the p683 construct with the Quickchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). TGACTCAT was changed into gGcCTtAT, and the mutation was verified by endonuclease digestion (additional HaeIII site introduced by mutagenesis) and confirmed by sequencing. All the pGL3/9E3 promoter subclones were transformed into DH5αEscherichia coli (Life Technologies, Inc.) and prepared using the endotoxin-free Maxiprep kit (Qiagen). qcCEFs were transiently transfected with 6 μg of DNA (4 μg of pGL3/9E3P subclone DNA cotransfected with 2 μg of PCH110 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) containing Lac-Z as internal transfection control) for each 35-mm dish using Ca2PO4-mediated methods without glycerol shock. All the reporter constructs were transfected and assayed in the same batch of cells. The transfected qcCEFs were incubated in modified 199 medium for 36 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 (24Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). Then cells were stimulated with PDBu or LPS for 3 h prior to lysis. For the inhibitor experiments, the qcCEFs were incubated with inhibitors for 30 min before PDBu stimulation. Cell extracts were prepared with reporter lysis buffer according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Promega) and stored in a −70 °C freezer. Cell extracts were assayed using a Luminometer with an automated injection device (Monolight 2010, Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). The reaction substrate and buffer are parts of the luciferase assay system (Promega). Aliquoted samples were used for the β-galactosidase assay according to the procedure for the β-galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega). A minimum of triplicates for each experiment was performed, and the data were expressed as mean light units of luminescence/unit of β-galactosidase activity. We used a cis-PathDetect system for AP-1 and a trans-PathDetect system for the Elk1. These systems were purchased from Promega, and we followed the protocols described by the company with the exception that we used our modified Ca2PO4 precipitation method for cell transfections that we have optimized in our system for lower stress-induced background, rather than transfections with Lipofectin as recommended in the procedure. Cells were treated as described earlier and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (36Jiang G. Nepomuceno L. Hopkins K. Sladek F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5131-5143Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined with the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). 10 μg of extracted nuclear protein was used for each binding reaction with 2 ng of [γ-32P]ATP-labeled probe containing the conserved Elk-1 binding element (wild type, ATCAGGATGCTTTTAATACTGCACC CT (bold indicates the binding site for the Elk1 transcription factor)) in EMSA buffer (188 mm NaCl, 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 2.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 2.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol). 30 ng of unlabeled probe was used for the competition assay, and 1 μl of anti-Phorpho Elk1(Ser-383) antibody (NE Biolab) was added for the supershift assay. Samples were assayed in 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. qcCEFs do not express the 9E3/cCAF or they express it at very low levels. However, upon stimulation with PDBu, the levels of the 9E3mRNA increase dramatically. The rise in mRNA is first seen at 7 min, and it peaks at 3–6 h and declines thereafter (Fig.1 A). cCAF production after stimulation by PDBu shows that the protein accumulates in the culture supernatant (Fig. 1 B). Accumulation is dose-dependent (Fig. 1 C) and is specific; the Me2SO used as solvent for PDBu did not significantly stimulate 9E3/cCAF (Fig. 1, D andE). It has been considered for a long time that phorbol esters exert their effects on cells primarily through the activation of PKC isoforms that contain the cysteine-rich (C1) domain to which phorbol esters bind (37Puceat M. Vassort G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 157: 65-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the possibility that stimulation of9E3/cCAF by phorbol esters occurs via activation of these classical PKCs. We treated cells with PDBu for 24 h to down-regulate total PKC activity by causing proteolytic degradation of these kinases (38Fournier A. Hardy S.J. Clark K.J. Murray A.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 161: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 39Sanders J.L. Stern P.H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1862-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 40Gatti A. Robinson P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) followed by restimulation with PDBu. The result was only moderately reduced expression compared with that stimulated by PDBu without pretreatment (Fig.2 A). These observations suggest that activation of PKC represents only part of the stimulation of the 9E3/cCAF by phorbol esters. These results were confirmed by treatment of cells with calphostin C, a specific inhibitor of PKC that competes with phorbol esters for the binding of the C1 domain in the regulatory region of PKC, and we found that9E3 expression and production of cCAF were minimally blocked by this inhibitor (Fig. 2, B and C). Similar results were obtained when the cells were treated with H7 dihydrochloride, a broad spectrum inhibitor of Ser/Thr kinases that also inhibits PKC (Fig. 2, B and C). None of these inhibitors by themselves cause stimulation of 9E3/cCAF (33Vaingankar S.M. Martins-Green M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5226-5234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, we also found that the 4α-isomer of PDBu (4α-PDBu), which does not activate PKC (41Blumberg P.M. CRC Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1980; 8: 153-197Crossref Scopus (385) Google Scholar), stimulates9E3 expression and cCAF production almost as efficiently as PDBu (Fig. 3, A andB). This stimulation, much like that by PDBu, is time- (Fig.3 C) and dose- (not shown) dependent, albeit not as efficient as the stimulation by PDBu. These results taken together strongly suggest that 9E3/cCAF stimulation by phorbol esters occurs primarily via PKC-independent pathway(s).Figure 3Effects of the biologically inert isomer of PDBu , 4α-PDBu, on cCAF production. A, Northern blot analysis using a full-length cDNA probe for 9E3 and immunoblot with a polyclonal antibody to cCAF (B) show that 4α-PDBu (PdiBt) (100 nm) stimulated the expression of 9E3/cCAF, although at lower levels than PDBu. C, the effect is time-dependent.

Martins-Green M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5226-5234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we used inhibitors of tyrosine kinases. Herbymicin, an inhibitor of the c-src family of tyrosine kinases, had no inhibitory effect on the PDBu stimulation of 9E3/cCAF (not shown). Similarly, tyrphostin, a selective inhibitor for the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase, had essentially no effect on PDBu stimulation of this gene (Fig. 4 A), whereas the broad spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein produced a distinct decrease in the stimulation of 9E3/cCAF. The same results were observed for cCAF protein levels (not shown). The inhibition of cCAF production when the cells were treated with calphostin C (inhibitor of PKC) and genistein (inhibitor of tyrosine kinases) was additive, but significant cCAF stimulation by PDBu remained (Fig. 4, B and C), suggesting yet other pathways of stimulation for this gene by PDBu. It has been known for some time that expression of chemokine genes triggered by a variety of stimuli is inhibited by glucocorticoids (42Oppenheim J.J. Zachariae C.O.C. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Annu.

In most cases tested, these anti-inflammatory agents activate the glucocorticoid receptor that, in turn, interacts with and inactivates transcription factors that are important in chemokine gene expression (46Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). Dexamethasone is an example of an anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid that inhibits chemokine gene activation (44Mukaida N. Morita M. Ishikawa Y. Rice N. Okamoto S. Kasahara T."
