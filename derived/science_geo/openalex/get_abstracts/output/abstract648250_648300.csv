https://openalex.org/W3008742929,"Retinal gene therapy has shown great promise in treating retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a primary photoreceptor degeneration that leads to severe sight loss in young people. In the present study, we report the first-in-human phase 1/2, dose-escalation clinical trial for X-linked RP caused by mutations in the RP GTPase regulator (RPGR) gene in 18 patients over up to 6 months of follow-up (https://clinicaltrials.gov/: NCT03116113). The primary outcome of the study was safety, and secondary outcomes included visual acuity, microperimetry and central retinal thickness. Apart from steroid-responsive subretinal inflammation in patients at the higher doses, there were no notable safety concerns after subretinal delivery of an adeno-associated viral vector encoding codon-optimized human RPGR (AAV8-coRPGR), meeting the pre-specified primary endpoint. Visual field improvements beginning at 1 month and maintained to the last point of follow-up were observed in six patients."

Bacteria-like morphology was identified in pockets of human fetal meconium at mid-gestation by scanning electron microscopy (n = 4), and a sparse bacterial signal was detected by 16S rRNA sequencing (n = 40 of 50) compared to environmental controls (n = 87). Eighteen taxa were enriched in fetal meconium, with Micrococcaceae (n = 9) and Lactobacillus (n = 6) the most abundant. Fetal intestines dominated by Micrococcaceae exhibited distinct patterns of T cell composition and epithelial transcription. Fetal Micrococcus luteus, isolated only in the presence of monocytes, grew on placental hormones, remained viable within antigen presenting cells, limited inflammation ex vivo and possessed genomic features linked with survival in the fetus. Thus, viable bacteria are highly limited in the fetal intestine at mid-gestation, although strains with immunomodulatory capacity are detected in subsets of specimens."
https://openalex.org/W3007282081,"Responses to vaccination and to diseases vary widely across individuals, which may be partly due to baseline immune variations. Identifying such baseline predictors of immune responses and their biological basis is of broad interest, given their potential importance for cancer immunotherapy, disease outcomes, vaccination and infection responses. Here we uncover baseline blood transcriptional signatures predictive of antibody responses to both influenza and yellow fever vaccinations in healthy subjects. These same signatures evaluated at clinical quiescence are correlated with disease activity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus with plasmablast-associated flares. CITE-seq profiling of 82 surface proteins and transcriptomes of 53,201 single cells from healthy high and low influenza vaccination responders revealed that our signatures reflect the extent of activation in a plasmacytoid dendritic cell-type I IFN-T/B lymphocyte network. Our findings raise the prospect that modulating such immune baseline states may improve vaccine responsiveness and mitigate undesirable autoimmune disease activity."
https://openalex.org/W3007150393,"Lineage-specific gene expression is modulated by a balance between transcriptional activation and repression during animal development. Knowledge about enhancer-centered transcriptional activation has advanced considerably, but silencers and their roles in normal development remain poorly understood. Here, we performed chromatin interaction analyses of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), a key inducer of transcriptional gene silencing, to uncover silencers, their molecular identity and associated chromatin connectivity. Systematic analysis of cis-regulatory silencer elements reveals their chromatin features and gene-targeting specificity. Deletion of certain PRC2-bound silencers in mice results in transcriptional derepression of their interacting genes and pleiotropic developmental phenotypes, including embryonic lethality. While some PRC2-bound elements function as silencers in pluripotent cells, they can transition into active tissue-specific enhancers during development, highlighting their regulatory versatility. Our study characterizes the molecular profile of silencers and their associated chromatin architectures, and suggests the possibility of targeted reactivation of epigenetically silenced genes."
https://openalex.org/W3006689392,"Social behaviors recruit multiple cognitive operations that require interactions between cortical and subcortical brain regions. Interareal synchrony may facilitate such interactions between cortical and subcortical neural populations. However, it remains unknown how neurons from different nodes in the social brain network interact during social decision-making. Here we investigated oscillatory neuronal interactions between the basolateral amygdala and the rostral anterior cingulate gyrus of the medial prefrontal cortex while monkeys expressed context-dependent positive or negative other-regarding preference (ORP), whereby decisions affected the reward received by another monkey. Synchronization between the two nodes was enhanced for a positive ORP but suppressed for a negative ORP. These interactions occurred in beta and gamma frequency bands depending on the area contributing the spikes, exhibited a specific directionality of information flow associated with a positive ORP and could be used to decode social decisions. These findings suggest that specialized coordination in the medial prefrontal–amygdala network underlies social-decision preferences. Dal Monte et al. investigate neuronal synchrony between the primate amygdala and the anterior cingulate gyrus during social decision-making. Highly specialized coordination between these areas promotes prosocial, compared to antisocial, decisions."
https://openalex.org/W3006876013,"The term Big Data is commonly used to describe a range of different concepts: from the collection and aggregation of vast amounts of data, to a plethora of advanced digital techniques designed to reveal patterns related to human behavior. In spite of its widespread use, the term is still loaded with conceptual vagueness. The aim of this study is to examine the understanding of the meaning of Big Data from the perspectives of researchers in the fields of psychology and sociology in order to examine whether researchers consider currently existing definitions to be adequate and investigate if a standard discipline centric definition is possible. Methods Thirty-nine interviews were performed with Swiss and American researchers involved in Big Data research in relevant fields. The interviews were analyzed using thematic coding. Results No univocal definition of Big Data was found among the respondents and many participants admitted uncertainty towards giving a definition of Big Data. A few participants described Big Data with the traditional “Vs” definition—although they could not agree on the number of Vs. However, most of the researchers preferred a more practical definition, linking it to processes such as data collection and data processing. Conclusion The study identified an overall uncertainty or uneasiness among researchers towards the use of the term Big Data which might derive from the tendency to recognize Big Data as a shifting and evolving cultural phenomenon. Moreover, the currently enacted use of the term as a hyped-up buzzword might further aggravate the conceptual vagueness of Big Data."
https://openalex.org/W3008414836,"Transmembrane protein 30A (TMEM30A) maintains the asymmetric distribution of phosphatidylserine, an integral component of the cell membrane and 'eat-me' signal recognized by macrophages. Integrative genomic and transcriptomic analysis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) from the British Columbia population-based registry uncovered recurrent biallelic TMEM30A loss-of-function mutations, which were associated with a favorable outcome and uniquely observed in DLBCL. Using TMEM30A-knockout systems, increased accumulation of chemotherapy drugs was observed in TMEM30A-knockout cell lines and TMEM30A-mutated primary cells, explaining the improved treatment outcome. Furthermore, we found increased tumor-associated macrophages and an enhanced effect of anti-CD47 blockade limiting tumor growth in TMEM30A-knockout models. By contrast, we show that TMEM30A loss-of-function increases B-cell signaling following antigen stimulation-a mechanism conferring selective advantage during B-cell lymphoma development. Our data highlight a multifaceted role for TMEM30A in B-cell lymphomagenesis, and characterize intrinsic and extrinsic vulnerabilities of cancer cells that can be therapeutically exploited."

https://openalex.org/W3007430306,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the capacity to self-renew and differentiate into specific cell types and are, therefore, key players during tissue repair and regeneration. The use of MSCs for the regeneration of tissues in vivo is increasingly being explored and already constitutes a promising alternative to existing clinical treatments. MSCs also exert paracrine and trophic functions, including the promotion of innervation that plays fundamental roles in regeneration and in restoration of the function of organs. Human bone marrow stem cells (hBMSCs) and human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) have been used in studies that aimed at the repair and/or regeneration of bone or other tissues of the craniofacial complex. However, the capabilities of hBMSCs and hDPSCs to elicit the growth of specific axons in order to reestablish functional innervation of the healing tissues are not known. Here, we compared the neurotrophic effects of hDPSCs and hBMSCs on trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia neurons using microfluidic organs-on-chips devices. We found that hDPSCs express significantly higher levels of neurotrophins than hBMSCs and consequently neurons cocultured with hDPSCs develop longer axons in the microfluidic co-culture system when compared to neurons cocultured with hBMSCs. Moreover, hDPSCs elicited the formation of extensive axonal networks and established close contacts with neurons, a phenomenon not observed in presence of hBMSCs. Taken together, these findings indicate that hDPSCs constitute a superior option for restoring the functionality of damaged craniofacial tissues, as they are able to support and promote extensive trigeminal innervation."
https://openalex.org/W3007674754,"Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are transmembrane receptors of great clinical interest due to their role in disease. Historically, therapeutics targeting RTKs have been identified using in vitro kinase assays. Due to frequent development of drug resistance, however, there is a need to identify more diverse compounds that inhibit mutated but not wild-type RTKs. Here, we describe MaMTH-DS (mammalian membrane two-hybrid drug screening), a live-cell platform for high-throughput identification of small molecules targeting functional protein-protein interactions of RTKs. We applied MaMTH-DS to an oncogenic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant resistant to the latest generation of clinically approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). We identified four mutant-specific compounds, including two that would not have been detected by conventional in vitro kinase assays. One of these targets mutant EGFR via a new mechanism of action, distinct from classical TKI inhibition. Our results demonstrate how MaMTH-DS is a powerful complement to traditional drug screening approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3006943810,"Understanding the interactions between increased insecticide resistance and resting behaviour patterns of malaria mosquitoes is important for planning of adequate vector control. This study was designed to investigate the resting behavior, host preference and rates of Plasmodium falciparum infection in relation to insecticide resistance of malaria vectors in different ecologies of western Kenya.Anopheles mosquito collections were carried out during the dry and rainy seasons in Kisian (lowland site) and Bungoma (highland site), both in western Kenya using pyrethrum spray catches (PSC), mechanical aspiration (Prokopack) for indoor collections, clay pots, pit shelter and Prokopack for outdoor collections. WHO tube bioassay was used to determine levels of phenotypic resistance of indoor and outdoor collected mosquitoes to deltamethrin. PCR-based molecular diagnostics were used for mosquito speciation, genotype for knockdown resistance mutations (1014S and 1014F) and to determine specific host blood meal origins. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was used to determine mosquito sporozoite infections.Anopheles gambiae s.l. was the most predominant species (75%, n = 2706) followed by An. funestus s.l. (25%, n = 860). An. gambiae s.s hereafter (An. gambiae) accounted for 91% (95% CI: 89-93) and An. arabiensis 8% (95% CI: 6-9) in Bungoma, while in Kisian, An. arabiensis composition was 60% (95% CI: 55-66) and An. gambiae 39% (95% CI: 34-44). The resting densities of An. gambiae s.l and An. funestus were higher indoors than outdoor in both sites (An. gambiae s.l; F1, 655 = 41.928, p < 0.0001, An. funestus; F1, 655 = 36.555, p < 0.0001). The mortality rate for indoor and outdoor resting An. gambiae s.l F1 progeny was 37% (95% CI: 34-39) vs 67% (95% CI: 62-69) respectively in Bungoma. In Kisian, the mortality rate was 67% (95% CI: 61-73) vs 76% (95% CI: 71-80) respectively. The mortality rate for F1 progeny of An. funestus resting indoors in Bungoma was 32% (95% CI: 28-35). The 1014S mutation was only detected in indoor resitng An. arabiensis. Similarly, the 1014F mutation was present only in indoor resting An. gambiae. The sporozoite rates were highest in An. funestus followed by An. gambiae, and An. arabiensis resting indoors at 11% (34/311), 8% (47/618) and 4% (1/27) respectively in Bungoma. Overall, in Bungoma, the sporozoite rate for indoor resting mosquitoes was 9% (82/956) and 4% (8/190) for outdoors. In Kisian, the sporozoite rate was 1% (1/112) for indoor resting An. gambiae. None of the outdoor collected mosquitoes in Kisian tested positive for sporozoite infections (n = 73).The study reports high indoor resting densities of An. gambiae and An. funestus, insecticide resistance, and persistence of malaria transmission indoors regardless of the use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). These findings underline the difficulties of controlling malaria vectors resting and biting indoors using the current interventions. Supplemental vector control tools and implementation of sustainable insecticide resistance management strategies are needed in western Kenya."
https://openalex.org/W3006841387,"In locally advanced lung cancer, established baseline clinical variables show limited prognostic accuracy and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) radiomics features may increase accuracy for optimal treatment selection. Their robustness and added value relative to current clinical factors are unknown. Hence, we identify robust and independent PET radiomics features that may have complementary value in predicting survival endpoints. A 4D PET dataset (n = 70) was used for assessing the repeatability (Bland-Altman analysis) and independence of PET radiomics features (Spearman rank: |ρ|<0.5). Two 3D PET datasets combined (n = 252) were used for training and validation of an elastic net regularized generalized logistic regression model (GLM) based on a selection of clinical and robust independent PET radiomics features (GLMall). The fitted model performance was externally validated (n = 40). The performance of GLMall (measured with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC) was highest in predicting 2-year overall survival (0.66±0.07). No significant improvement was observed for GLMall compared to a model containing only PET radiomics features or only clinical variables for any clinical endpoint. External validation of GLMall led to AUC values no higher than 0.55 for any clinical endpoint. In this study, robust independent FDG PET radiomics features did not have complementary value in predicting survival endpoints in lung cancer patients. Improving risk stratification and clinical decision making based on clinical variables and PET radiomics features has still been proven difficult in locally advanced lung cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W3008184486,"Background Anthropogenic perturbations have strong impact on water quality and ecological health of mangrove areas of Indian Sundarbans. Diversity in microbial community composition is important causes for maintaining the health of the mangrove ecosystem. However, microbial communities of estuarine water in Indian Sundarbans mangrove areas and environmental determinants that contribute to those communities were seldom studied. Methods Nevertheless, this study attempted first to report bacterial and archaeal communities simultaneously in the water from Matla River and Thakuran River of Maipith coastal areas more accurately using 16S rRNA gene-based amplicon approaches. Attempt also been made to assess the capability of the environmental parameters for explaining the variation in microbial community composition. Results Our investigation indicates the dominancy of halophilic marine bacteria from families Flavobacteriaceae and OM1 clade in the water with lower nutrient load collected from costal regions of a small Island of Sundarban Mangroves (ISM). At higher eutrophic conditions, changes in bacterial communities in Open Marine Water (OMW) were detected, where some of the marine hydrocarbons degrading bacteria under families Oceanospirillaceae and Spongiibacteraceae were dominated. While most abundant bacterial family Rhodobacteracea almost equally (18% of the total community) dominated in both sites. Minor variation in the composition of archaeal community was also observed between OMW and ISM. Redundancy analysis indicates a combination of total nitrogen and dissolved inorganic nutrients for OMW and for ISM, salinity and total nitrogen was responsible for explaining the changes in their respective microbial community composition. Conclusions Our study contributes the first conclusive overview on how do multiple environmental/anthropogenic stressors (salinity, pollution, eutrophication, land-use) affect the Sundarban estuary water and consequently the microbial communities in concert. However, systematic approaches with more samples for evaluating the effect of environmental pollutions on mangrove microbial communities are recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3008970786,"Lissencephaly (LIS), denoting a ""smooth brain,"" is characterized by the absence of normal cerebral convolutions with abnormalities of cortical thickness. Pathogenic variants in over 20 genes are associated with LIS. The majority of posterior predominant LIS is caused by pathogenic variants in LIS1 (also known as PAFAH1B1), although a significant fraction remains without a known genetic etiology. We now implicate CEP85L as an important cause of posterior predominant LIS, identifying 13 individuals with rare, heterozygous CEP85L variants, including 2 families with autosomal dominant inheritance. We show that CEP85L is a centrosome protein localizing to the pericentriolar material, and knockdown of Cep85l causes a neuronal migration defect in mice. LIS1 also localizes to the centrosome, suggesting that this organelle is key to the mechanism of posterior predominant LIS."
https://openalex.org/W3007368663,"We report new lipid-based, high-density, environmentally sensitive (HIDE) probes that accurately and selectively image endo-lysosomes and their dynamics at super-resolution for extended times. Treatment of live cells with the small molecules DiIC16TCO or DiIC16’TCO followed by in situ tetrazine ligation reaction with the silicon-rhodamine dye SiR-Tz generates the HIDE probes DiIC16-SiR and DiIC16’-SiR in the endo-lysosomal membrane. These new probes support the acquisition of super-resolution videos of organelle dynamics in primary cells for more than 7 min with no detectable change in endosome structure or function. Using DiIC16-SiR and DiIC16’-SiR, we describe direct evidence of endosome motility defects in cells from patients with Niemann–Pick Type-C disease. In wild-type fibroblasts, the probes reveal distinct but rare inter-endosome kiss-and-run events that cannot be observed using confocal methods. Our results shed new light on the role of NPC1 in organelle motility and cholesterol trafficking. HIDE probes were developed for long time-lapse imaging of endolysosomes and their dynamics at super-resolution. These probes enabled analyses of endosome motility in primary fibroblasts from patients with Niemann–Pick C with distinct mutations in NPC1."
https://openalex.org/W3007873711,"Genes mutated in human neuronal migration disorders encode tubulin proteins and a variety of tubulin-binding and -regulating proteins, but it is very poorly understood how these proteins function together to coordinate migration. Additionally, the way in which regional differences in neocortical migration are controlled is completely unknown. Here we describe a new syndrome with remarkably region-specific effects on neuronal migration in the posterior cortex, reflecting de novo variants in CEP85L. We show that CEP85L is required cell autonomously in vivo and in vitro for migration, that it localizes to the maternal centriole, and that it forms a complex with many other proteins required for migration, including CDK5, LIS1, NDE1, KIF2A, and DYNC1H1. Loss of CEP85L disrupts CDK5 localization and activation, leading to centrosome disorganization and disrupted microtubule cytoskeleton organization. Together, our findings suggest that CEP85L highlights a complex that controls CDK5 activity to promote neuronal migration."

This study first investigates the possible links between life satisfaction, self-esteem, anxiety, depression, and the intensity of Instagram use with a social comparison model. In the study, 974 women age 18-49 who were Instagram users voluntarily participated, completing a questionnaire. The results suggest associations between the analyzed psychological data and social comparison types. Then, artificial neural networks models were implemented to predict the type of such comparison (positive, negative, equal) based on the aforementioned psychological traits. The models were able to properly predict between 71% and 82% of cases. As human behavior analysis has been a subject of study in various fields of science, this paper contributes towards understanding the role of artificial intelligence methods for analyzing behavioral data in psychology."
https://openalex.org/W3007690415,"Animals are faced with a range of ecological constraints that shape their behavioural decisions. Habitat features that affect resource abundance will also have an impact, especially as regards spatial distribution, which will in turn affect associations between the animals. Here we utilised a network approach, using spatial and genetic data, to describe patterns in use of space (foraging sites) by free-ranging Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) at the Dakhla Oasis in Egypt. We observed a decrease in home range size during spring, when food availability was lowest, which was reflected by differences in space sharing networks. Our data showed that when food was abundant, space sharing networks were less connected and more related individuals shared more foraging sites. In comparison, when food was scarce the bats had few possibilities to decide where and with whom to forage. Overall, both networks had high mean degree, suggesting communal knowledge of predictable food distribution."

In atherosclerotic lesions, apoA-I exhibits marked oxidative modifications at multiple sites, including Trp72. Site-specific mutagenesis studies have suggested, but have not conclusively shown, that oxidative modification of Trp72 of apoA-I impairs many atheroprotective properties of this lipoprotein. Herein, we used genetic code expansion technology with an engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae tryptophanyl tRNA-synthetase (Trp-RS):suppressor tRNA pair to insert the noncanonical amino acid 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-OHTrp) at position 72 in recombinant human apoA-I and confirmed site-specific incorporation utilizing MS.

Understanding the functional consequences of apoA-I modification has been the subject of intense investigation with efforts focused on recapitulating the physiological modifications in vitro using MPO-catalyzed modifications with chlorinating and nitrating oxidation systems. These studies are limited by oxidation on all susceptible residues, thereby confounding interpretation of functional studies and assignment of impaired activities to specific sites. Although natural amino acid substitution studies confirmed the relevance of oxidation at specific residues, the approach was also limited by unknown consequences of incorporating a nonoxidizable amino acid on the structure/function of the protein. Thus, the functional consequence of site-specific (single-site) oxidation of apoA-I remains poorly understood. Site-directed natural amino acid mutagenesis studies support a crucial role for apoA-I Trp72 in ABCA1-dependent efflux activity (31Huang Y. DiDonato J.A. Levison B.S. Schmitt D. Li L. Wu Y. Buffa J.

ApoA-I oxidized on Trp72 (oxTrp72-apoA-I) is present in plasma of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), is highly enriched in atherosclerotic lesions, and is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk (31Huang Y.

In this study, we sought to address the absolute effect of oxidation at Trp72 in the absence of any other modification in apoA-I. Genetic code expansion (GCE) has emerged as a powerful method to site-specifically incorporate noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins in living cells (33Porter J.J. Mehl R.A. Genetic code expansion: a powerful tool for understanding the physiological consequences of oxidative stress protein modifications.Oxid. Med. Cell Longev. 2018; 2018 (29849913): 760746310.1155/2018/7607463Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Specifically, engineered aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase:tRNA pairs are used to deliver a desired ncAA in response to a nonsense or frameshift codon. Herein, we used an evolved tryptophanyl tRNA-synthetase (Trp-RS):suppressor tRNA pair from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (34Ellefson J.W. Meyer A.J. Hughes R.A. Cannon J.R. Brodbelt J.S. Ellington A.D. Directed evolution of genetic parts and circuits by compartmentalized partnered replication.Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32 (24185096): 97-10110.1038/nbt.2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) to insert oxTrp at position 72 in apoA-I in Escherichia coli. We now report a significant impairment of in vitro cholesterol acceptor activity and in vivo HDL biogenesis function observed with 5-OHTrp72 apoA-I relative to WT apoA-I. To examine the specific functional consequences of a single-site oxTrp at position 72 in apoA-I, we used GCE to cotranslationally incorporate a noncanonical amino acid in vivo (33Porter J.J. Mehl R.A. Genetic code expansion: a powerful tool for understanding the physiological consequences of oxidative stress protein modifications.Oxid. Med. Cell Longev. 2018; 2018 (29849913): 760746310.1155/2018/7607463Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We used an engineered Trp-RS:suppressor tRNA pair (engineered machinery) from S. cerevisiae, which incorporates 5-OHTrp in E. coli in response to a genetically programmed amber nonsense codon (TAG) (34Ellefson J.W. Meyer A.J. Hughes R.A. Cannon J.R. Brodbelt J.S. Ellington A.D. Directed evolution of genetic parts and circuits by compartmentalized partnered replication.Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32 (24185096): 97-10110.1038/nbt.2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We first explored the possibility that this machinery might exhibit substrate promiscuity, thereby allowing us the opportunity to insert different oxidized tryptophans. The experimental approach is schematically depicted in Fig. 1A, where amber suppression in superfolder GFP (sfGFP) with a 150TAG leads to fluorescence of intact bacterial cells due to expression of full-length protein. We first examined the specificity of this orthogonal pair for oxidized tryptophan by co-transforming the plasmid encoding the engineered machinery with either one of two reporters encoding sfGFP-150TAG (Fig. 1, A and B), or apoA-I-72TAG (Fig. 1C), as described under “Experimental procedures.” Transformed E. coli BL21ai cells were grown on defined autoinduction media in the presence of the indicated oxidized tryptophan (oxTrp) forms without or with added lactose to induce Trp-RS R313 (see “Experimental procedures”). A robust amber suppression resulting in full-length sfGFP protein expression was observed only in the presence of 5-OHTrp, exhibiting an 8.8 ± 3.8-fold increase over lactose-induced control culture (Fig. 1B). This suggests that Trp-RS R313 selectively aminoacylates its cognate tRNA (tRNATrpCUA40A) with 5-OHTrp and not with 2-OHTrp, 2,3-Dioxindolyl alanine (2,3-diOHTrp) or kynurenine. There was a modest induction of full-length sfGFP in lactose-induced cultures in the absence of added oxTrp, which suggested that Trp-RS R313 may weakly aminoacylate its cognate suppressor tRNA with an endogenous (nonoxidized) Trp, which was present in the media at low levels, because Trp is an essential amino acid and needed to be present for incorporation into other sites in sfGFP. Notably, yield of the mutant sfGFP in response to 5-OHTrp was 50% of the WT sfGFP reporter (no stop codon) (Fig. 1B). This suggests that the Trp-RS R313:tRNATrpCUA40A orthogonal pair is quite efficient at suppressing the nonsense codon, at least with respect to position 150 in sfGFP under the experimental conditions used. We next proceeded to test whether we could insert 5-OHTrp at position 72 in apoA-I. Because WT apoA-I has an innate ability to bind lipopolysaccharide (35Ma J. Liao X.L. Lou B. Wu M.P.

To confirm that the expressed full-length recombinant apoA-I contained 5-OHTrp at position 72, His-tagged WT (lacking amber (TAG) codon but otherwise having identical DNA sequence to apoA-I-72TAG) and the mutant protein were expressed in ClearColi, purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography, and processed for proteomic analysis (see “Experimental procedures” for details). Equivalent amounts of each protein were fractionated by gradient (4–20%) reducing SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue (Fig. 2A). The mutant protein exhibited similar purity and equivalent gel fractionation properties compared with WT His10-apoA-I (Fig. 2A). Native peptides from WT and 5-OHTrp72 apoA-I variant, generated by trypsin digestion, were identified by nano-LC-MS/MS. Whereas detectable oxidation at Trp50 and Trp108 was minimal, the degree of oxidation at Trp72 in the mutant protein was 85% with the remaining 15% being WT tryptophan (Fig. 2B). This suggests that the incorporation fidelity of 5-OHTrp by the engineered orthogonal pair is 85% in 5-OHTrp-supplemented media in response to amber codon. Analysis of the peptide spanning residues 62–77 revealed a mass increase of 16 Da on all y ions present after the oxTrp72 in the noncanonical amino acid incorporated peptide (62EQLGPVTQEFW(ox)DNLEK77) spectra compared with the same y ions in WT apoA-I (Fig. 2C). This mass differential is consistent with single incorporation of an oxygen (5-OH moiety) on Trp72 of apoA-I, corresponding to the location of the amber codon (TAG). We previously identified two regions in apoA-I, P1 (38LGKQLNLKL46) and P2 (201STLSEKAK208), as potential contact sites with PON1 that promote PON1 thermal stability and activation (39Huang Y. Wu Z. Riwanto M. Gao S. Levison B.S. Gu X. Fu X. Wagner M.A. Besler C. Gerstenecker G. Zhang R. Li X.M. DiDonato A.J. Gogonea V.

Because our mutation (5-OHTrp72) is outside these regions, we reasoned that PON1 stabilization/activation by our mutant protein would not be affected. Indeed, 5-OHTrp72 apoA-I was as effective as reconstituted HDL (containing WT-apoA-I) and modestly better than WT apoA-I at enhancing the arylesterase activity of recombinant PON1 (average PON1 arylesterase activities 30 min after protein additions to PON1 (expressed as μmol/min/mg PON1) were as follows: PON1 alone, 154.8 ± 3.5; PON1 + HDL, 361.3 ± 15.3; PON1 + WT apoA-I, 299.1 ± 5.8; PON1 + 5OHTrp72, 364.3 ± 0.01; PON1 + BSA, 194.3 ± 7.0; Fig. 3). This result demonstrates that 5-OHTrp72 apoA-I is fully functional, at least with respect to PON1 stabilization/activation. ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux activity from peripheral tissue and atherosclerotic lesions is an important atheroprotective function of apoA-I and is impaired through oxidation by MPO in vivo (30Zheng L.

https://openalex.org/W3006743837,"We previously reported that the transcription factor Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) regulates the expression of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) and prolactin (PRL) during decidualization of human endometrial stromal cells (ESCs). However, other roles of WT1 in decidualization remain to be fully clarified. Here, we investigated how WT1 regulates the physiological functions of human ESCs during decidualization. We incubated ESCs isolated from proliferative-phase endometrium with cAMP to induce decidualization, knocked down WT1 with siRNA, and generated three types of treatments (nontreated cells, cAMP-treated cells, and cAMP-treated + WT1-knockdown cells). To identify WT1-regulated genes, we used gene microarrays and compared the transcriptome data obtained among these three treatments. We observed that WT1 up-regulates 121 genes during decidualization, including several genes involved in lipid transport. The WT1 knockdown inhibited lipid accumulation (LA) in the cAMP-induced ESCs. To examine the mechanisms by which WT1 regulates LA, we focused on very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), which is involved in lipoprotein uptake. We found that cAMP up-regulates VLDLR and that the WT1 knockdown inhibits it. Results of ChIP assays revealed that cAMP increases the recruitment of WT1 to the promoter region of the VLDLR gene, indicating that WT1 regulates VLDLR expression. Moreover, VLDLR knockdown inhibited cAMP-induced LA, and VLDLR overexpression reverted the suppression of LA caused by the WT1 knockdown. Taken together, our results indicate that WT1 enhances lipid storage by up-regulating VLDLR expression in human ESCs during decidualization. We previously reported that the transcription factor Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) regulates the expression of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) and prolactin (PRL) during decidualization of human endometrial stromal cells (ESCs). However, other roles of WT1 in decidualization remain to be fully clarified. Here, we investigated how WT1 regulates the physiological functions of human ESCs during decidualization. We incubated ESCs isolated from proliferative-phase endometrium with cAMP to induce decidualization, knocked down WT1 with siRNA, and generated three types of treatments (nontreated cells, cAMP-treated cells, and cAMP-treated + WT1-knockdown cells). To identify WT1-regulated genes, we used gene microarrays and compared the transcriptome data obtained among these three treatments. We observed that WT1 up-regulates 121 genes during decidualization, including several genes involved in lipid transport. The WT1 knockdown inhibited lipid accumulation (LA) in the cAMP-induced ESCs. To examine the mechanisms by which WT1 regulates LA, we focused on very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), which is involved in lipoprotein uptake. We found that cAMP up-regulates VLDLR and that the WT1 knockdown inhibits it. Results of ChIP assays revealed that cAMP increases the recruitment of WT1 to the promoter region of the VLDLR gene, indicating that WT1 regulates VLDLR expression. Moreover, VLDLR knockdown inhibited cAMP-induced LA, and VLDLR overexpression reverted the suppression of LA caused by the WT1 knockdown. Taken together, our results indicate that WT1 enhances lipid storage by up-regulating VLDLR expression in human ESCs during decidualization."

https://openalex.org/W3006694306,"To understand the relationship between pregnancy intentions and contraceptive use, a growing body of research has begun to examine various domains of women's attitudes towards pregnancy, acknowledging that these attitudes may contradict one another, and women may be ambivalent. This study examines pregnancy ambivalence and assesses the relationship between attitudes towards pregnancy and contraceptive continuation after nine months among a sample of women in Odisha and Haryana, India. Data come from a longitudinal study of married women age 15–49 who began using a modern reversible method of contraception at the time of study enrollment. To assess their cognitive attitudes (beliefs/knowledge) towards pregnancy, women were asked “how important is it you to avoid a pregnancy now?” To assess their affective attitudes (feelings/emotions), women were asked about their agreement with the statement: “If I found out I was pregnant in the next several weeks, I would be happy.” A joint, 4-category measure combining these cognitive and affective attitudes towards pregnancy was created to measure concordance and ambivalence in attitudes towards pregnancy. Multivariate random-effects logistic regression models were employed to examine the relationship of these two measures with method-specific contraceptive continuation nine months later. Two models were conducted, one with the two attitude variables included independently and the second with the joint, 4-category measure included. Results showed that affective and cognitive attitudes were both significantly associated with continuation, but that there were no significant differences between those that were ambivalent and those whose attitudes were concordantly anti-pregnancy. This study suggests that attitudes towards pregnancy are multifaceted and both cognitive and affective attitudes towards pregnancy may play an important role in contraceptive use in India."
https://openalex.org/W3006936330,"Small animal imaging has become essential in evaluating new cancer therapies as they are translated from the preclinical to clinical domain. However, preclinical imaging faces unique challenges that emphasize the gap between mouse and man. One example is the difference in breathing patterns and breath-holding ability, which can dramatically affect tumor burden assessment in lung tissue. As part of a co-clinical trial studying immunotherapy and radiotherapy in sarcomas, we are using micro-CT of the lungs to detect and measure metastases as a metric of disease progression. To effectively utilize metastatic disease detection as a metric of progression, we have addressed the impact of respiratory gating during micro-CT acquisition on improving lung tumor detection and volume quantitation. Accuracy and precision of lung tumor measurements with and without respiratory gating were studied by performing experiments with in vivo images, simulations, and a pocket phantom. When performing test-retest studies in vivo, the variance in volume calculations was 5.9% in gated images and 15.8% in non-gated images, compared to 2.9% in post-mortem images. Sensitivity of detection was examined in images with simulated tumors, demonstrating that reliable sensitivity (true positive rate (TPR) ≥ 90%) was achievable down to 1.0 mm3 lesions with respiratory gating, but was limited to ≥ 8.0 mm3 in non-gated images. Finally, a clinically-inspired “pocket phantom” was used during in vivo mouse scanning to aid in refining and assessing the gating protocols. Application of respiratory gating techniques reduced variance of repeated volume measurements and significantly improved the accuracy of tumor volume quantitation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3006947961,"The biomineralization protein Mms6 has been shown to be a major player in the formation of magnetic nanoparticles both within the magnetosomes of magnetotactic bacteria and as an additive in synthetic magnetite precipitation assays. Previous studies have highlighted the ferric iron binding capability of the protein and this activity is thought to be crucial to its mineralizing properties. To understand how this protein binds ferric ions we have prepared a series of single amino acid substitutions within the C-terminal binding region of Mms6 and have used a ferric binding assay to probe the binding site at the level of individual residues which has pinpointed the key residues of E44, E50 and R55 involved in Mms6 ferric binding. No aspartic residues bound ferric ions. A nanoplasmonic sensing experiment was used to investigate the unstable EER44, 50,55AAA triple mutant in comparison to native Mms6. This suggests a difference in interaction with iron ions between the two and potential changes to the surface precipitation of iron oxide when the pH is increased. All-atom simulations suggest that disruptive mutations do not fundamentally alter the conformational preferences of the ferric binding region. Instead, disruption of these residues appears to impede a sequence-specific motif in the C-terminus critical to ferric ion binding."

We focus on two key factors that may motivate younger and older adults to engage in climate change action, legacy concern and place attachment, and assess whether older adults differ in any appreciable way from the general population in this domain. We randomly exposed participants of different ages to either a Legacy, Place, or control writing induction task before they completed various self-report measures. Both induction conditions were associated with significantly greater pro-environmental behavioral intentions and donations for all age groups when compared to the control condition. Legacy motivation and biophilia were used as manipulation checks and found to partially mediate these effects. Findings suggest that legacy and place message framing may be useful in prompting adults of all ages to take action to help combat climate change."
https://openalex.org/W3006876083,"The Dark Triad of personality is a cluster of three socially aversive personality traits: Machiavellianism, narcissism and psychopathy. These traits are associated with a selfish, aggressive and exploitative interpersonal strategy. The objective of the current study was to establish relationships between the Dark Triad traits (and their dimensions) and momentary affect. Machiavellianism, grandiose narcissism, vulnerable narcissism and the dimensions of the Triarchic model of psychopathy (namely, boldness, meanness and disinhibition) were examined. We used the Day Reconstruction Method, which is based on reconstructing affective states experienced during the previous day. The final sample consisted of 270 university students providing affective ratings of 3047 diary episodes. Analyses using multilevel modelling showed that only boldness had a positive association with positive affective states and affect balance, and a negative association with negative affective states. Grandiose narcissism and its sub-dimensions had no relationship with momentary affect. The other dark traits were related to negative momentary affect and/or inversely related to positive momentary affect and affect balance. As a whole, our results empirically demonstrated distinctiveness of the Dark Triad traits in their relationship to everyday affective states. These findings are not congruent with the notion that people with the Dark Triad traits, who have a dispositional tendency to manipulate and exploit others, are generally cold and invulnerable to negative feelings. The associations between the Dark Triad and momentary affect were discussed in the contexts of evolutionary and positive psychology, in relation to the role and adaptive value of positive and negative emotions experienced by individuals higher in Machiavellianism, narcissism and psychopathy."
https://openalex.org/W3007564483,"The adult mammalian heart has a limited regenerative capacity. Therefore, identification of endogenous cells and mechanisms that contribute to cardiac regeneration is essential for the development of targeted therapies. The side population (SP) phenotype has been used to enrich for stem cells throughout the body; however, SP cells isolated from the heart have been studied exclusively in cell culture or after transplantation, limiting our understanding of their function in vivo. We generated a new Abcg2-driven lineage-tracing mouse model with efficient labeling of SP cells. Labeled SP cells give rise to terminally differentiated cells in bone marrow and intestines. In the heart, labeled SP cells give rise to lineage-traced cardiomyocytes under homeostatic conditions with an increase in this contribution following cardiac injury. Instead of differentiating into cardiomyocytes like proposed cardiac progenitor cells, cardiac SP cells fuse with preexisting cardiomyocytes to stimulate cardiomyocyte cell cycle reentry. Our study is the first to show that fusion between cardiomyocytes and non-cardiomyocytes, identified by the SP phenotype, contribute to endogenous cardiac regeneration by triggering cardiomyocyte cell cycle reentry in the adult mammalian heart."

Early identification of such unfavorable outcomes in patients who smoke is critical for optimizing personalized medical care. Methods Here, we perform a comprehensive analysis using Systems Biology tools of publicly available data from a total of 6 transcriptomic studies, which examined different specimens of lung tissue and/or cells of smokers and nonsmokers to identify potential markers associated with lung cancer. Results Expression level of 22 genes was capable of classifying smokers from non-smokers. A machine learning algorithm revealed that AKR1B10 was the most informative gene among the 22 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) accounting for the classification of the clinical groups. AKR1B10 expression was higher in smokers compared to non-smokers in datasets examining small and large airway epithelia, but not in the data from a study of sorted alveolar macrophages. Moreover, AKR1B10 expression was relatively higher in lung cancer specimens compared to matched healthy tissue obtained from nonsmoking individuals. Although the overall accuracy of AKR1B10 expression level in distinction between cancer and healthy lung tissue was 76%, with a specificity of 98%, our results indicated that such marker exhibited low sensitivity, hampering its use for cancer screening such specific setting. Conclusion The systematic analysis of transcriptomic studies performed here revealed a potential critical link between AKR1B10 expression, smoking and occurrence of lung cancer."

HIF-P4Hs can also be inhibited by small molecules studied in clinical trials for renal anemia. Knowledge of systemic long-term inactivation of HIF-P4Hs is limited but crucial, since HIF overexpression is associated with cancers. We aimed to determine the effects of systemic genetic inhibition of the most abundant isoenzyme HIF prolyl 4-hydroxylase-2 (HIF-P4H-2)/PHD2/EglN1 on life span and tissue homeostasis in aged mice. Our data showed no difference between wild-type and HIF-P4H-2-deficient mice in the average age reached. There were several differences, however, in the primary causes of death and comorbidities, the HIF-P4H-2-deficient mice having less inflammation, liver diseases, including cancer, and myocardial infarctions, and not developing anemia. No increased cancer incidence was observed due to HIF-P4H-2-deficiency. These data suggest that chronic inactivation of HIF-P4H-2 is not harmful but rather improves the quality of life in senescence."

https://openalex.org/W3008385034,"T cells play an important role in controlling viral replication during HIV infection. An effective vaccine should, therefore, lead to the induction of a strong and early viral-specific CD8+ T cell response. While polyfunctional T cell responses are thought to be important contributors to the antiviral response, there is evidence to show that polyfunctional HIV- specific CD8+ T cells are just a small fraction of the total HIV-specific CD8+ T cells and may be absent in many individuals who control HIV replication, suggesting that other HIV-1 specific CD8+ effector T cell subsets may be key players in HIV control. Stem cell-like memory T cells (TSCM) are a subset of T cells with a long half-life and self-renewal capacity. They serve as key reservoirs for HIV and contribute a significant barrier to HIV eradication. The present study evaluated vaccine-induced antiviral responses and TSCM cells in volunteers vaccinated with a subtype C prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine candidate administered in a prime-boost regimen. We found that ADVAX DNA prime followed by MVA boost induced significantly more peripheral CD8+ TSCM cells and higher levels of CD8+ T cell-mediated inhibition of replication of different HIV-1 clades as compared to MVA alone and placebo. These findings are novel and provide encouraging evidence to demonstrate the induction of TSCM and cytotoxic immune responses by a subtype C HIV-1 prophylactic vaccine administered using a prime-boost strategy."
https://openalex.org/W3008936562,"Singapore’s Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) national strategic action plan includes inappropriate use of antimicrobials in food-producing animals as a specific priority. Although the use of antibiotics and other drugs are monitored by regulatory bodies, food fish farmers are allowed to buy and administer antimicrobials without a veterinary prescription. We conducted a qualitative study of Singaporean food fish farmers to understand patterns and determinants of antibiotic use, their knowledge of antibiotic resistance, as well as perceptions of on-farm infection prevention and control measures. During the interview, participants were asked about their farming processes, farm infrastructure, antibiotic use and any disease prevention measures. Thematic analysis of participants’ interviews showed that antibiotic for growth promotion and infection prevention was uncommon among local food fish farmers. The following three main themes influenced participants’ decisions to use antibiotics in their practice: 1) individual factors, 2) local regulatory factors as well as 3) market-related factors. Individual factors included their personal experience and knowledge both with antibiotics as well as with alternate options. In terms of local regulatory factors, we found that regular oversight was a strong deterrent in antibiotic use. Last, at the market level, the relatively high price of antibiotics in Singapore coupled with stiff competition was a strong disincentive for participants to use antibiotics in their farming practice. These factors were also influential in their relationships with local regulatory bodies as well as their counterparts. Although industries differ significantly across countries, lessons learnt from Singapore’s food fish farming demonstrate the importance of an environment where multi-dimensional factors come together to discourage the irrational use of antibiotics in food animal production. In addition, our results allow greater insight into food fish farmers’ perspectives on infection control and form a basis from which further research work can be undertaken."
https://openalex.org/W3006811431,"Glaucoma is considered a progressive optic neuropathy because of the damage and death of the retinal ganglion cells. It is also a neurodegenerative disease because it affects neural structures in the visual system and beyond, including the corpus callosum-the largest white matter structure involved in inter-hemispheric transfer of information. In this study we probed the dysfunction of the inter-hemispheric processing in patients with mild glaucoma using the phenomenon of binocular rivalry. Patients with mild glaucoma and no measurable visual field defects and age-matched controls underwent a thorough visual assessment. Then they participated in a series of psychophysical tests designed to examine the binocular rivalry derived from intra- and inter-hemispheric processing. Static horizontal and vertical sinewave gratings were presented dichoptically using a double-mirror stereoscope in 3 locations: centrally, to probe inter-hemispheric processing, and peripherally to the left or to the right, to probe intra-hemispheric processing. Although the two groups were matched in functional measures, rivalry rate of the glaucoma group was significantly lower than that of the control group for the central location, but not for the peripheral location. These results were driven mainly by the patients with normal tension glaucoma whose average rivalry rate for the central location (from which information reaches the two hemispheres) was almost half (46% lower) that of the controls. These results indicate a dysfunction in inter-hemispheric transfer in mild glaucoma that can be detected behaviourally before any changes in standard functional measures."
https://openalex.org/W3008789491,"Objective To assess the impact of obesity, glucose tolerance, and weight loss on renal function, we measured serum creatinine and cystatin C and estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) indexed to 1.73m2 body surface area (BSA) and GFR indexed to actual BSA in subjects with normal and abnormal glucose tolerance before and up to 2 years after medical weight loss. Methods We studied 146 subjects at baseline and 3-to-6 months after 18% reduction in weight; 43 were also studied at 2-years. GFR was estimated using the MDRD, CKD-EPICr, CKD-EPICysCr, and the CKD-EPICys equations. Results eGFR was consistently lower when creatinine-based rather than cystatin C-based estimating equations were used. eGFR was lower when creatinine-based or cystatin C-based equations were indexed to 1.73m2 BSA than when they were indexed to actual BSA. eGFR indexed to actual BSA was more likely to demonstrate hyperfiltration (eGFR ≥135 ml/min) than eGFR indexed to 1.73m2 BSA and decreased into the normal range with weight loss. eGFR was highest in subjects with impaired fasting glucose but there was little difference in the patterns of change in eGFR across groups by glucose tolerance status. Conclusions With severe obesity, high fat-free mass and BSA result in low estimates of eGFR indexed to 1.73m2 BSA, especially when creatinine-based estimating equations are used. GFR indexed to actual BSA is approximately 50% higher. When eGFR is indexed to actual BSA, many subjects display evidence of renal hyperfiltration which improves with weight loss. In subjects with severe obesity undergoing medical weight loss, estimating equations that use cystatin C and are indexed to actual BSA may provide a more accurate assessment of renal function."

For the compound selected for the study placed in aqueous solutions with varying concentrations of hydrogen ions, the fluorescence emission spectra revealed a single emission band within most of the pH range, however, at low pH (pH<3) a significant broadening (noticeable effect of dual fluorescence) and shifting of the band was observed. Whereas, for water and polar (protic) solvents, we observed a very interesting phenomenon of dual fluorescence never before reported for this particular group of analogues (with the specific substituent system). Based on the results of the experiments, it was observed that the presented effects may be related both with conformational effects (related to the possible positioning of the-OH group on the side of the carbonyl system, which facilitates the possibility of proton transfer) as well as, most importantly, the effects of excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT-Excited State Intramolecular Proton Transfer) related in this case with the necessary (new/previously unobserved in published literature) presence of ionic and non-ionic forms of the compound). Both the conducted quantum-mechanical [TD]DFT-Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory) calculations and excited state dipole moment change calculations for the analyzed molecule in solvents with varying pH confirmed the association between the observed fluorescence phenomena and the two aforementioned effects."

This study aimed to 1) assess the associations between comorbidity and different employment exit routes, and 2) examine such associations by gender. Methods We used data from employed adults aged 50–62 in the Stockholm Public Health Survey 2002 and 2006, linked to longitudinal administrative income records (N = 10,416). The morbidity measure combined Limiting Longstanding Illness and Common Mental Disorder—captured by the General Health Questionnaire-12 (≥4)—into a categorical variable: 1) No Limiting Longstanding Illness, no Common Mental Disorder, 2) Limiting Longstanding Illness only, 3) Common Mental Disorder only, and 4) comorbid Limiting Longstanding Illness+Common Mental Disorder. Employment status was followed up until 2010, treating early retirement, disability pension and unemployment as employment exits. Competing risk regression analysed the associations between morbidity and employment exit routes, stratifying by gender. Results Compared to No Limiting Longstanding Illness, no Common Mental Disorder, comorbid Limiting Longstanding Illness+Common Mental Disorder was associated with early retirement in men (subdistribution hazard ratio = 1.73, 95% confidence intervals: 1.08–2.76), but not in women. For men and women, strong associations for disability pension were observed with Limiting Longstanding Illness only (subdistribution hazard ratio = 11.43, 95% confidence intervals: 9.40–13.89) and Limiting Longstanding Illness+Common Mental Disorder (subdistribution hazard ratio = 14.25, 95% confidence intervals: 10.91–18.61), and to a lesser extent Common Mental Disorder only (subdistribution hazard ratio = 2.00, 95% confidence intervals: 1.31–3.05). Women were more likely to exit through disability pension than men (subdistribution hazard ratio = 1.96, 95% confidence intervals: 1.60–2.39). Common Mental Disorder only was the only morbidity category associated with unemployment (subdistribution hazard ratio = 1.70, 95% confidence intervals: 1.36–2.15). Conclusions Strong associations were observed between specific morbidity categories with different employment exit routes, which differed by gender.

https://openalex.org/W3008307254,"Background The current UK vaccination programme for herpes zoster (HZ) excludes people aged ≥80 years. This study aimed to quantify the number of individuals ≥80 years who missed HZ vaccination and the consequent epidemiological and economic burden of HZ and post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). Methods Immunocompetent individuals aged ≥80 years between 1st September 2013 and 31st December 2017 in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink were selected and linked to Hospital Episodes Statistics, where available. Rates of HZ and PHN and healthcare resource utilisation were investigated for the overall study population and by age group (80–84, 85–89, ≥90 years old) and the burden of HZ and PHN was projected to the UK population. Results 4,858 HZ episodes and 464 PHN cases were identified in 255,165 individuals over 576,421 person-years (PY). Rates of HZ and PHN were 8.43 (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.19–8.66) and 0.80 (0.73–0.87) per 1,000 PY respectively and lowest in those aged ≥90 (HZ rate 7.37/1,000 PY; PHN rate 0.56/1,000 PY). Within HZ episodes, 10.27% of GP visits, 5.82% of prescribed medications and 21.65% of hospitalisations were related to HZ/PHN. Median length of hospitalisation increased from 7.0 days for all-cause to 10.5 days for HZ/PHN related hospitalisations. Individuals ≥90 stayed in hospital a median of 3–4 days longer than younger groups. Approximately 2.23 million individuals in the UK missed HZ vaccination since 2013 (1.86 million had never been eligible and 365,000 lost eligibility for HZ vaccination), resulting in an estimated 43,149 HZ episodes. Conclusion This study highlights the impact of the 80-year upper age limit policy on the health system. Our study estimates that 2.23 million individuals in the UK may have lost the opportunity to be vaccinated and that their burden of HZ and PHN remains high, especially among the very elderly."

We sought to evaluate the association of worsening ventricular repolarization in midlife, as measured by incident prolonged QT interval, with cognitive decline in late life. Methods Midlife QT interval was assessed by electrocardiography during three study visits from 1965/68 to 1971/74 in a cohort of Japanese American men aged 46–68 at Exam 1 from the Honolulu Heart Study. We defined incident prolonged QT as the QT interval in the upper quartile at Exam 2 or 3 after QT interval in lower three quartiles at Exam 1. Cognitive performance was assessed at least once using the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI), scored using item response theory (CASI-IRT), during four subsequent visits from 1991/93 to 1999/2000 among 2,511 of the 4,737 men in the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study otherwise eligible for inclusion in analyses. We used marginal structural modeling to determine the association of incident prolonged QT with cognitive decline, using weighting to account for confounding and attrition. Results Incident prolonged QT interval in midlife was not associated with late-life CASI-IRT at cognitive baseline (estimated difference in CASI-IRT: 0.04; 95% CI: -0.28, 0.35; p = 0.81), or change in CASI-IRT over time (estimated difference in annual change in CASI-IRT: -0.002; 95%CI: -0.013, 0.010; p = 0.79). Findings were consistent across sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Although many midlife cardiovascular risk factors and cardiac structure and function measures are associated with late-life cognitive decline, incident prolonged QT interval in midlife was not associated with late-life cognitive performance or cognitive decline."
https://openalex.org/W3008483234,"Introduction Lung clearance index (LCI) is a sensitive measure of early lung disease, but adoption into clinical practice has been slow. Challenges include the time taken to perform each test. We recently described a closed-circuit inert gas wash-in method that reduces overall testing time by decreasing the time to equilibration. The aim of this study was to define a normative range of LCI in healthy adults and children derived using this method. We were also interested in the feasibility of using this system to measure LCI in a community setting. Methods LCI was assessed in healthy volunteers at three hospital sites and in two local primary schools. Volunteers completed three washout repeats at a single visit using the closed circuit wash-in method (0.2% SF6 wash-in tracer gas to equilibrium, room air washout). Results 160 adult and paediatric subjects successfully completed LCI assessment (95%) (100 in hospital, 60 in primary schools). Median coefficient of variation was 3.4% for LCI repeats and 4.3% for FRC. Mean (SD) LCI for the analysis cohort (n = 53, age 5–39 years) was 6.10 (0.42), making the upper limit of normal LCI 6.8. There was no relationship between LCI and multiple demographic variables. Median (interquartile range) total test time was 18.7 (16.0–22.5) minutes. Conclusion The closed circuit method of LCI measurement can be successfully and reproducibly measured in healthy volunteers, including in out-of-hospital settings. Normal range appears stable up to 39 years. With few subjects older than 40 years, further work is required to define the normal limits above this age."

Through their diverse polysaccharide structures they can potentiate a myriad of cellular signaling pathways involved in development, growth, immuno-communication and survival. Not surprisingly, disruption of glycan synthesis is fundamental to various human diseases; including cancer, where aberrant glycosylation drives malignancy. Here, we report the discovery of a novel mannose-binding lectin, ML6, which selectively recognizes and binds to these irregular tumor-specific glycans to elicit potent and rapid cancer cell death. This lectin was engineered from gene models identified in a tropical rainforest tree root transcriptome and is unusual in its six canonical mannose binding domains (QxDxNxVxY), each with a unique amino acid sequence. Remarkably, ML6 displays antitumor activity that is >105 times more potent than standard chemotherapeutics, while being almost completely inactive towards non-transformed, healthy cells. This activity, in combination with results from glycan binding studies, suggests ML6 differentiates healthy and malignant cells by exploiting divergent glycosylation pathways that yield naïve and incomplete cell surface glycans in tumors. Thus, ML6 and other high-valence lectins may serve as novel biochemical tools to elucidate the glycomic signature of different human tumors and aid in the rational design of carbohydrate-directed therapies. Further, understanding how nature evolves proteins, like ML6, to combat the changing defenses of competing microorganisms may allow for fundamental advances in the way we approach combinatorial therapies to fight therapeutic resistance in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3008141959,"The purpose of this experiment was to investigate whether honey bees (Apis mellifera) are able to use social discriminative stimuli in a spatial aversive conditioning paradigm. We tested bees’ ability to avoid shock in a shuttle box apparatus across multiple groups when either shock, or the absence of shock, was associated with a live hive mate, a dead hive mate, a live Polistes exclamans wasp or a dead wasp. Additionally, we used several control groups common to bee shuttle box research where shock was only associated with spatial cues, or where shock was associated with a blue or yellow color. While bees were able to learn the aversive task in a simple spatial discrimination, the presence of any other stimuli (color, another bee, or a wasp) reduced initial performance. While the color biases we discovered are in line with other experiments, the finding that the presence of another animal reduces performance is novel. Generally, it appears that the use of bees or wasps as stimuli initially causes an increase in overall activity that interferes with early performance in the spatial task. During the course of the experiment, the bees habituate to the insect stimuli (bee or wasp), and begin learning the aversive task. Additionally, we found that experimental subject bees did not discriminate between bees or wasps used as stimulus animals, nor did they discriminate between live or dead stimulus animals. This may occur, in part, due to the specialized nature of the worker honey bee. Results are discussed with implications for continual research on honey bees as models of aversive learning, as well as research on insect social learning in general."
https://openalex.org/W3007567897,"Objective The amount of extravasated blood is an established surrogate marker for subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) severity, which varies in different experimental SAH (eSAH) models. A comprehensive eSAH grading system would allow a more reliable correlation of outcome parameters with SAH severity. The aim of this study was to define a severity score for eSAH related to the Fisher-Score in humans. Material and methods SAH was induced in 135 male rats using the modified double hemorrhage model. A sham group included 8 rats, in which saline solution instead of blood was injected. Histological analysis with HE(hematoxylin-eosin)-staining for the visualization of blood was performed in all rats on day 5. The amount and distribution of blood within the subarachnoid space and ventricles (IVH) was analyzed. Results The mortality rate was 49.6% (71/143). In all except five SAH rats, blood was visible within the subarachnoid space. As expected, no blood was detected in the sham group. The following eSAH severity score was established (ESAS-score): grade I: no SAH visible; grade II: local or diffuse thin SAH, no IVH; grade III: diffuse / thick layers of blood, no IVH; grade IV: additional IVH. Grade I was seen in five rats (7.9%), grade II in 28.6% (18/63), grade III in 41.3% (26/63) and grade IV in 22.2% (14/63) of the rats with eSAH. Conclusion The double hemorrhage model allows the induction of a high grade SAH in more than 60% of the rats, making it suitable for the evaluation of outcome parameters in severe SAH."
https://openalex.org/W3007829074,"Therapeutic resistance plagues cancer outcomes, challenging treatment particularly in aggressive disease. A unique method to decipher drug interactions with their targets and inform therapy is to employ fluorescence-based screening tools; however, to implement productive screening assays, adequate model systems must be developed. Patient-derived pancreatic cancer models (e.g., cell culture, patient-derived xenograft mouse models, and organoids) have been traditionally utilized to predict personalized therapeutic response. However, cost, long read out times and the inability to fully recapitulate the tumor microenvironment have rendered most models incompatible with clinical decision making for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. Tumor explant cultures, where patient tissue can be kept viable for up to weeks, have garnered interest as a platform for delivering personalized therapeutic prediction on a clinically relevant timeline. To fully explore this ex vivo platform, a series of studies were completed to quantitatively compare in vivo models with tumor explants, examining gemcitabine therapeutic efficacy, small molecule uptake and drug-target engagement using a novel fluorescently-labeled gemcitabine conjugate. This initial work shows promise for patient-specific therapeutic selection, where tumor explant drug distribution and response recapitulated the in vivo behavior and could provide a valuable platform for understanding mechanisms of therapeutic response and resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3006814492,"Accumulating evidence indicates that diabetes and obesity are associated with chronic low-grade inflammation and multiple organ failure. Tissue-infiltrated inflammatory M1 macrophages are aberrantly activated in these conditions and contribute to hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. However, it is unclear at which stage these cells become aberrantly activated: as precursor monocytes in the bone marrow or as differentiated macrophages in tissues. We examined the abundance, activation state, and function of bone marrow-derived Ly6Chigh monocytes in mice with diabetes and/or obesity. Ly6Chigh monocytes were FACS-purified from six groups of male mice consisting of type 2 diabetes model db/db mice, streptozotocin (STZ) induced insulin depletion mice, high fat diet (HFD) induced obesity mice and each control mice. Ly6Chigh monocytes were then analyzed for the expression of inflammation markers by qRT-PCR. In addition, bone marrow-derived Ly6Chigh monocytes from db/+ and db/db mice were fluorescently labeled and injected into groups of db/db recipient mice. Cell trafficking to tissues and levels of markers were examined in the recipient mice. The expression of many inflammation-related genes was significantly increased in Ly6Chigh monocytes from db/db mice, compared with the control. Bone marrow-derived Ly6Chigh monocytes isolated from db/db mice, but not from db/+ mice, displayed prominent infiltration into peripheral tissues at 1 week after transfer into db/db mice. The recipients of db/db Ly6Chigh monocytes also exhibited significantly increased serum glucose levels and worsening tolerance compared with mice receiving db/+ Ly6Chigh monocytes. These novel observations suggest that activated Ly6Chigh monocytes may contribute to the glucose intolerance observed in diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3006776467,"We reviewed charts and radiologic studies of 30 patients operated upon by ADR with Mobi-C® in single level since 2006. All patients had healthy cervical facet joints (less than or equal to grade 1 according to grading systems for cervical facet joint degeneration) preoperatively. We assessed clinical outcomes with NDI and VAS on neck and arm over follow-up and also measured ROM at implanted segment on dynamic radiographs during follow-up. The mean follow-up period was 42.4 ± 15.9 months. We then assessed the linearity of changes in ROM at implanted segment through linear mixed model. All patients showed significantly improved clinical outcomes. ROMs at implanted segment were maintained at slightly increased levels until 24 months postoperatively (P = 0.529). However, after 24 months, ROMs at implanted segment decreased significantly until last follow-up (P = 0.001). In addition, the decreasing pattern after 24 months showed a regular regression (P = 0.001). This decline was correlated with decline of extension angle at implanted segment. Based on this regular regression, we estimated that ROMs at implanted segments would be less than 2 degrees at 10.24 years postoperatively. Even though implanted segment maintains its motion for some length of time, we could assume that an artificial disc would have limited life expectancy correlated with the decline of extension angle."
https://openalex.org/W3008246613,"T cell anergy is known to be a crucial mechanism for various types of immune tolerance, including oral tolerance. The expression of several anergy-specific genes was reportedly up-regulated in anergic T cells, and played important roles in the cells. However, how the genes were up-regulated has not been understood. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the altered gene expression and DNA methylation status in T cells tolerized by oral antigen in vivo. Our results showed that many genes were significantly up-regulated in the orally tolerized T cells, and most of the genes found in this study have not been reported previously as anergy related genes; for example, ribosomal protein L41 (FC = 3.54E06, p = 3.70E-09: Fisher's exact test; the same applies hereinafter) and CD52 (FC = 2.18E05, p = 3.44E-06). Furthermore, we showed that the DNA methylation statuses of many genes; for example, enoyl-coenzyme A delta isomerase 3 (FC = 3.62E-01, p = 3.01E-02) and leucine zipper protein 1 (FC = 4.80E-01, p = 3.25E-02), including the ones distinctly expressed in tolerized T cells; for example, latexin (FC = 3.85E03, p = 4.06E-02 for expression; FC = 7.75E-01, p = 4.13E-01 for DNA methylation) and small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide F (FC = 3.12E04, p = 4.46E-04 for expression; FC = 8.56E-01, p = 5.15E-01 for DNA methylation), changed during tolerization, suggesting that the distinct expression of some genes was epigenetically regulated in the tolerized T cells. This study would contribute to providing a novel clue to the fine understanding of the mechanism for T cell anergy and oral tolerance."
