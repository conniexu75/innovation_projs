https://openalex.org/W2004447249,Spectral features observed with the Mariner 9 interferometer spectrometer are identified as those of H(2)O ice. The measured spectra are compared with theoretical calculations for the transfer of radiation through clouds of ice particles with variations in size distribution and integrated cloud mass. Comparisons with an observed spectrum from the Tharsis Ridge region indicate H(2)O ice clouds composed of particles with a mean radius of 2.0 micrometers and an integrated cloud mass of 5 x 10(-5) grain per square centimeter.

https://openalex.org/W1983689023,"Microearthquake activity at St. Augustine volcano, located at the mouth of Cook Inlet in the Aleutian Islands, has been monitored since August 1970. Both before and after minor eruptive activity on 7 October 1971, numerous shallow-foci microearthquake swarms were recorded. Plots of the hourly frequency of microearthquakes often show a diurnal peaking of activity. A cross correlation of this activity with the calculated magnitudes of tidal acceleration exhibited two prominent phase relationships. The first, and slightly more predominant, phase condition is a phase delay in the microearthquake activity of approximately 1 hour from the time of maximum tidal acceleration. This is thought to be a direct microearthquake-triggering effect caused by tidal stresses. The second is a phase delay in the microearthquake activity of approximately 5 hours, which correlates well with the time of maximum oceanic tidal loading. Correlation of the individual peaks of swarm activity with defined components of the tides suggests that it may be necessary for tidal stressing to have a preferential orientation in order to be an effective trigger of microearthquakes."

If, as seems as yet unproved, inoculated legume seeds fail to develop on humid subsoil material, such failure can not justifiably be attributed as is done by Alway, McDole and Rost, to a lack of available phosphoric acid and potash. 3. A lack of available nitrogen probably is sufficient to account for rawness of subsoils. 4. The poor aeration of subsoils which indirectly results in their rawness, may be accounted for more simply than by Hilgard's explanation of the washing down of fine particles into the subsoil, which prevents proper aeration."
