It is possible to do essentially the same thing with light waves by using selective excitation and relaxation processes of the electrons in crystals or high-pressure gases through which the beam of light is directed to produce light harmonics. Over the past decade, researchers have been optimizing the conversion of red light to the far edge of the ultraviolet, which corresponds to tens of harmonics. Popmintchev et al. (p. 1287 ) now show that mid-infrared light can undergo a process in high-pressure gas to generate ultrahigh harmonics up to orders greater than 5000 in the x-ray regime."

The claws undergo repeated high-velocity and high-force impacts. Weaver et al. (p. 1275 ; see the Perspective by Tanner ) used a variety of techniques to examine the structure, mechanical behavior, and toughening mechanisms of the claw of the Peacock Mantis shrimp. The claw's composite structure is optimized for toughness, which helps to prevent the complete failure that might arise from the claw's repetitive hammering."

(p. 481 , published online 7 June; see the Perspective by Yu and Luo ) identify loss-of-function mutations in Drosophila dSarm that are capable of blocking the degeneration of severed axons for the fly life span. Deletion of mouse Sarm1 provides similar protection to severed axons for weeks after injury, which suggests that Sarm is part of an ancient axonal death signaling cascade."
https://openalex.org/W2020448043,"In excitable cells, voltage-gated sodium (Na(V)) channels activate to initiate action potentials and then undergo fast and slow inactivation processes that terminate their ionic conductance. Inactivation is a hallmark of Na(V) channel function and is critical for control of membrane excitability, but the structural basis for this process has remained elusive. Here we report crystallographic snapshots of the wild-type Na(V)Ab channel from Arcobacter butzleri captured in two potentially inactivated states at 3.2 Å resolution. Compared to previous structures of Na(V)Ab channels with cysteine mutations in the pore-lining S6 helices (ref. 4), the S6 helices and the intracellular activation gate have undergone significant rearrangements: one pair of S6 helices has collapsed towards the central pore axis and the other S6 pair has moved outward to produce a striking dimer-of-dimers configuration. An increase in global structural asymmetry is observed throughout our wild-type Na(V)Ab models, reshaping the ion selectivity filter at the extracellular end of the pore, the central cavity and its residues that are analogous to the mammalian drug receptor site, and the lateral pore fenestrations. The voltage-sensing domains have also shifted around the perimeter of the pore module in wild-type Na(V)Ab, compared to the mutant channel, and local structural changes identify a conserved interaction network that connects distant molecular determinants involved in Na(V) channel gating and inactivation. These potential inactivated-state structures provide new insights into Na(V) channel gating and novel avenues to drug development and therapy for a range of debilitating Na(V) channelopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2054058473,"Voltage-gated sodium (Na(v)) channels are essential for the rapid depolarization of nerve and muscle, and are important drug targets. Determination of the structures of Na(v) channels will shed light on ion channel mechanisms and facilitate potential clinical applications. A family of bacterial Na(v) channels, exemplified by the Na(+)-selective channel of bacteria (NaChBac), provides a useful model system for structure-function analysis. Here we report the crystal structure of Na(v)Rh, a NaChBac orthologue from the marine alphaproteobacterium HIMB114 (Rickettsiales sp. HIMB114; denoted Rh), at 3.05 Å resolution. The channel comprises an asymmetric tetramer. The carbonyl oxygen atoms of Thr 178 and Leu 179 constitute an inner site within the selectivity filter where a hydrated Ca(2+) resides in the crystal structure. The outer mouth of the Na(+) selectivity filter, defined by Ser 181 and Glu 183, is closed, as is the activation gate at the intracellular side of the pore. The voltage sensors adopt a depolarized conformation in which all the gating charges are exposed to the extracellular environment. We propose that Na(v)Rh is in an 'inactivated' conformation. Comparison of Na(v)Rh with Na(v)Ab reveals considerable conformational rearrangements that may underlie the electromechanical coupling mechanism of voltage-gated channels."

https://openalex.org/W1972577475,"The complexity of cancer has led to recent interest in polypharmacological approaches for developing kinase-inhibitor drugs; however, optimal kinase-inhibition profiles remain difficult to predict. Using a Ret-kinase-driven Drosophila model of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 and kinome-wide drug profiling, here we identify that AD57 rescues oncogenic Ret-induced lethality, whereas related Ret inhibitors imparted reduced efficacy and enhanced toxicity. Drosophila genetics and compound profiling defined three pathways accounting for the mechanistic basis of efficacy and dose-limiting toxicity. Inhibition of Ret plus Raf, Src and S6K was required for optimal animal survival, whereas inhibition of the ‘anti-target’ Tor led to toxicity owing to release of negative feedback. Rational synthetic tailoring to eliminate Tor binding afforded AD80 and AD81, compounds featuring balanced pathway inhibition, improved efficacy and low toxicity in Drosophila and mammalian multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 models. Combining kinase-focused chemistry, kinome-wide profiling and Drosophila genetics provides a powerful systems pharmacology approach towards developing compounds with a maximal therapeutic index. Using Ret-driven models of multiple endocrine neoplasia, it is shown that optimal kinase inhibition must aim to target an ideal spectrum of tumour-relevant kinases while avoiding ‘anti-targets’ that cause unwanted toxicity. Many targeted cancer drugs are kinase inhibitors, which often inhibit a spectrum of kinases. Here, Kevan Shokat and colleagues examine the concept of 'anti-targets' using a Drosophila model of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), which is driven by the kinase Ret, to screen for multi-kinase inhibitors that target Ret and several other kinases involved in MEN2 tumour growth. Interaction with an anti-target by a multi-kinase inhibitor could lead to unwanted toxicity or trigger feedback mechanisms that counter the beneficial effects of the drug. An optimized drug would target an ideal spectrum of tumour-relevant kinases while avoiding anti-targets. Such compounds are shown to improve the survival of flies with the MEN2 model as well as the xenograft growth of human MEN2 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2013077952,"Synaptic neurotransmitter release is driven by Ca(2+) influx through active zone voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). Control of active zone VGCC abundance and function remains poorly understood. Here we show that a trafficking step probably sets synaptic VGCC levels in rats, because overexpression of the pore-forming α1(A) VGCC subunit fails to change synaptic VGCC abundance or function. α2δs are a family of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored VGCC-associated subunits that, in addition to being the target of the potent neuropathic analgesics gabapentin and pregabalin (α2δ-1 and α2δ-2), were also identified in a forward genetic screen for pain genes (α2δ-3). We show that these proteins confer powerful modulation of presynaptic function through two distinct molecular mechanisms. First, α2δ subunits set synaptic VGCC abundance, as predicted from their chaperone-like function when expressed in non-neuronal cells. Second, α2δs configure synaptic VGCCs to drive exocytosis through an extracellular metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS), a conserved set of amino acids within the predicted von Willebrand A domain of α2δ. Expression of α2δ with an intact MIDAS motif leads to an 80% increase in release probability, while simultaneously protecting exocytosis from blockade by an intracellular Ca(2+) chelator. α2δs harbouring MIDAS site mutations still drive synaptic accumulation of VGCCs; however, they no longer change release probability or sensitivity to intracellular Ca(2+) chelators. Our data reveal dual functionality of these clinically important VGCC subunits, allowing synapses to make more efficient use of Ca(2+) entry to drive neurotransmitter release."
https://openalex.org/W2013932632,"Protein synthesis involves the translation of ribonucleic acid information into proteins, the building blocks of life. The initial step of protein synthesis is the binding of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) to the 7-methylguanosine (m(7)-GpppG) 5' cap of messenger RNAs. Low oxygen tension (hypoxia) represses cap-mediated translation by sequestering eIF4E through mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent mechanisms. Although the internal ribosome entry site is an alternative translation initiation mechanism, this pathway alone cannot account for the translational capacity of hypoxic cells. This raises a fundamental question in biology as to how proteins are synthesized in periods of oxygen scarcity and eIF4E inhibition. Here we describe an oxygen-regulated translation initiation complex that mediates selective cap-dependent protein synthesis. We show that hypoxia stimulates the formation of a complex that includes the oxygen-regulated hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF-2α), the RNA-binding protein RBM4 and the cap-binding eIF4E2, an eIF4E homologue. Photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) analysis identified an RNA hypoxia response element (rHRE) that recruits this complex to a wide array of mRNAs, including that encoding the epidermal growth factor receptor. Once assembled at the rHRE, the HIF-2α-RBM4-eIF4E2 complex captures the 5' cap and targets mRNAs to polysomes for active translation, thereby evading hypoxia-induced repression of protein synthesis. These findings demonstrate that cells have evolved a program by which oxygen tension switches the basic translation initiation machinery."

Now, Stehling et al. (p. 195 , published online 7 June) and Gari et al. (p. 243 , published online 7 June) show that in both yeast and humans, MMS19 functions as part of the cytosolic Fe-S protein assembly (CIA) machinery. The MMS19 is part of a specialized CIA targeting complex that plays a role late in cytosolic Fe-S protein assembly to direct Fe-S cluster transfer from the CIA scaffold complex to a subset of Fe-S proteins, including a number associated with DNA metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2001453133,"In the neocortex, microcircuits are assembled in a lineage-dependent manner through a distinct sequence of events that involves long-range electrical connections between sister neurons, leading to the formation of chemical synapses between these neurons. It has been proposed that during development clonally related neurons migrate along the same radial glial fibre, forming clusters of functionally similar cells. However, this has not been shown experimentally. Two groups now demonstrate electrical coupling between sister neurons in the developing cerebral cortex that shapes subsequent functional relationships. Song-Hai Shi and colleagues report that in neocortical tissue from postnatal mice, long-range connections between sister neurons are maintained through electrical couplings that precede the formation of chemical synapses between them. Any blockade of gap junctions during development disrupts the eventual synaptic connectivity of sister cells and prevents their synchronous firing. Yang Dan and colleagues show that, in the mouse visual cortex, sister neurons in the same radial clone have similar orientation preferences. Disrupting gap-junction coupling shortly after birth diminishes the functional similarity between sister neurons, suggesting that the development of functional organization from ontogenetically related neurons requires this form of neural communication. Radial glial cells are the primary neural progenitor cells in the developing neocortex1. Consecutive asymmetric divisions of individual radial glial progenitor cells produce a number of sister excitatory neurons that migrate along the elongated radial glial fibre, resulting in the formation of ontogenetic columns2,3,4. Moreover, sister excitatory neurons in ontogenetic columns preferentially develop specific chemical synapses with each other rather than with nearby non-siblings5. Although these findings provide crucial insight into the emergence of functional columns in the neocortex, little is known about the basis of this lineage-dependent assembly of excitatory neuron microcircuits at single-cell resolution. Here we show that transient electrical coupling between radially aligned sister excitatory neurons regulates the subsequent formation of specific chemical synapses in the neocortex. Multiple-electrode whole-cell recordings showed that sister excitatory neurons preferentially form strong electrical coupling with each other rather than with adjacent non-sister excitatory neurons during early postnatal stages. This preferential coupling allows selective electrical communication between sister excitatory neurons, promoting their action potential generation and synchronous firing. Interestingly, although this electrical communication largely disappears before the appearance of chemical synapses, blockade of the electrical communication impairs the subsequent formation of specific chemical synapses between sister excitatory neurons in ontogenetic columns. These results suggest a strong link between lineage-dependent transient electrical coupling and the assembly of precise excitatory neuron microcircuits in the neocortex."
https://openalex.org/W2002687566,"A fundamental feature of the mammalian neocortex is its columnar organization. In the visual cortex, functional columns consisting of neurons with similar orientation preferences have been characterized extensively, but how these columns are constructed during development remains unclear. The radial unit hypothesis posits that the ontogenetic columns formed by clonally related neurons migrating along the same radial glial fibre during corticogenesis provide the basis for functional columns in adult neocortex. However, a direct correspondence between the ontogenetic and functional columns has not been demonstrated. Here we show that, despite the lack of a discernible orientation map in mouse visual cortex, sister neurons in the same radial clone exhibit similar orientation preferences. Using a retroviral vector encoding green fluorescent protein to label radial clones of excitatory neurons, and in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to measure neuronal response properties, we found that sister neurons preferred similar orientations whereas nearby non-sister neurons showed no such relationship. Interestingly, disruption of gap junction coupling by viral expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Cx26 (also known as Gjb2) or by daily administration of a gap junction blocker, carbenoxolone, during the first postnatal week greatly diminished the functional similarity between sister neurons, suggesting that the maturation of ontogenetic into functional columns requires intercellular communication through gap junctions. Together with the recent finding of preferential excitatory connections among sister neurons, our results support the radial unit hypothesis and unify the ontogenetic and functional columns in the visual cortex."

https://openalex.org/W1997052232,"The co-emergence of a six-layered cerebral neocortex and its corticospinal output system is one of the evolutionary hallmarks of mammals. However, the genetic programs that underlie their development and evolution remain poorly understood. Here we identify a conserved non-exonic element (E4) that acts as a cortex-specific enhancer for the nearby gene Fezf2 (also known as Fezl and Zfp312), which is required for the specification of corticospinal neuron identity and connectivity. We find that SOX4 and SOX11 functionally compete with the repressor SOX5 in the transactivation of E4. Cortex-specific double deletion of Sox4 and Sox11 leads to the loss of Fezf2 expression, failed specification of corticospinal neurons and, independent of Fezf2, a reeler-like inversion of layers. We show evidence supporting the emergence of functional SOX-binding sites in E4 during tetrapod evolution, and their subsequent stabilization in mammals and possibly amniotes. These findings reveal that SOX transcription factors converge onto a cis-acting element of Fezf2 and form critical components of a regulatory network controlling the identity and connectivity of corticospinal neurons. SOX transcription factors converge on a cortex-specific enhancer to regulate the dynamic, cell-type-specific expression of Fezf2, a gene necessary for the formation of corticospinal system. The emergence and expansion of the neocortex has been crucial to the evolution of higher brain function in mammals. Neocortical layers differ in their projection patterns, with upper layers connecting to other cortical neurons and deeper layers projecting long distances to other brain areas and the spinal cord, but the genetic programs underlying these anatomical differences are unknown. Here, Shim et al. identify a conserved, cortex-specific enhancer that drives the Fezf2-initiated specification program required for the production of the deep-layer, long-range projection neurons in the corticospinal tract. SOX transcription factors influence this enhancer through sites found to have emerged with tetrapods, modulating the regulatory network responsible for the corticospinal output system, an evolutionary hallmark of mammals."

https://openalex.org/W2043411229,"Significant advances in our understanding of RNA architecture, folding and recognition have emerged from structure–function studies on riboswitches, non-coding RNAs whose sensing domains bind small ligands and whose adjacent expression platforms contain RNA elements involved in the control of gene regulation. We now report on the ligand-bound structure of the Thermotoga petrophila fluoride riboswitch, which adopts a higher-order RNA architecture stabilized by pseudoknot and long-range reversed Watson–Crick and Hoogsteen A•U pair formation. The bound fluoride ion is encapsulated within the junctional architecture, anchored in place through direct coordination to three Mg2+ ions, which in turn are octahedrally coordinated to water molecules and five inwardly pointing backbone phosphates. Our structure of the fluoride riboswitch in the bound state shows how RNA can form a binding pocket selective for fluoride, while discriminating against larger halide ions. The T. petrophila fluoride riboswitch probably functions in gene regulation through a transcription termination mechanism. A riboswitch that binds fluoride was identified recently, which is surprising because both RNA and fluoride are negatively charged; here it is shown that the fluoride ion is coordinated to three positively charged magnesium ions, which are further encased in a negatively charged shell of RNA backbone phosphates and water molecules. Riboswitches are untranslated, structured regions of messenger RNA molecules that adopt and bind a ligand to affect its expression. The recent identification of a riboswitch that binds fluoride was a surprise, because both fluoride and RNA are negatively charged. Dinshaw Patel and colleagues have now determined the structure of the fluoride riboswitch from Thermotoga petrophila, and show how this unlikely contribution can occur. The fluoride ligand is coordinated to three positively charged magnesium ions, which are further encased in a negatively charged shell of backbone phosphates and water molecules. The size of the binding pocket excludes the binding of larger halide ions."

https://openalex.org/W2072610194,"The Milky Way galaxy is observed to have multiple components with distinct properties, such as the bulge, disk, and halo. Unraveling the assembly history of these populations provides a powerful test to the theory of galaxy formation and evolution, but is often restricted due to difficulties in measuring accurate stellar ages for low mass, hydrogen-burning stars. Unlike these progenitors, the ""cinders"" of stellar evolution, white dwarf stars, are remarkably simple objects and their fundamental properties can be measured with little ambiguity from spectroscopy. Here I report observations and analysis of newly formed white dwarf stars in the halo of the Milky Way, and a comparison to published analysis of white dwarfs in the well-studied 12.5 billion-year-old globular cluster Messier 4. From this, I measure the mass distribution of the remnants and invert the stellar evolution process to develop a new relation that links this final stellar mass to the mass of their immediate progenitors, and therefore to the age of the parent population. By applying this technique to a small sample of four nearby and kinematically-confirmed halo white dwarfs, I measure the age of local field halo stars to be 11.4 +/- 0.7 billion years. This age is directly tied to the globular cluster age scale, on which the oldest clusters formed 13.5 billion years ago. Future (spectroscopic) observations of newly formed white dwarfs in the Milky Way halo can be used to reduce the present uncertainty, and to probe relative differences between the formation time of the last clusters and the inner halo."

Results: Chronic opioid increases presynaptic NMDAR activity at primary sensory nerve terminals through protein kinase C. Conclusion: Increased presynaptic NMDAR activity potentiates nociceptive input and is responsible for opioid hyperalgesia and tolerance. Significance: Understanding mechanisms of increased NMDAR activity is important for improving opioid therapies. Opioid analgesics are the mainstay of treatment for moderate to severe pain caused by cancer or by tissue and nerve injury. However, long-term administration of μ-opioid receptor agonists for chronic pain can lead to analgesic tolerance, which is a major obstacle to adequate pain relief. Opioid analgesic tolerance is a phenomenon in which repeated exposure to an opioid agonist results in the decreased therapeutic effect of the drug or the need for a higher dose to maintain the same analgesic effect. For all μ-opioid receptor agonists, analgesic tolerance occurs with repeated use. The cellular and signaling mechanisms responsible are poorly understood. The key question is where and how opioids induce neuroplasticity in the nervous system that leads to opioid tolerance.

Chen S.R. Chen H. Pan H.L. Opioid-induced long-term potentiation in the spinal cord is a presynaptic event.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 4460-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, how pre- and postsynaptic NMDARs help regulate glutamatergic synaptic input to spinal dorsal horn neurons after chronic opioid treatment. Identifying the origin of NMDAR activity associated with chronic opioid treatment is critical because it will influence whether research should focus on primary sensory neurons or spinal cord second-order neurons to improve the efficacy of opioid therapies. In this study, we determined how chronic opioid treatment affects the function of pre- and postsynaptic NMDARs in the spinal cord. We provide new evidence showing that presynaptic NMDAR activity at primary afferent terminals is increased by chronic morphine and potentiates glutamatergic input to spinal dorsal horn neurons through protein kinase C (PKC). Strikingly, chronic morphine administration leads to a large reduction in postsynaptic NMDAR activity, which results from increased glutamate release from transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1)-expressing primary afferents. This new information is important for understanding the mechanisms involved in NMDAR plasticity at the spinal level and their roles in opioid-induced hyperalgesia and analgesic tolerance. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (280–320 g; Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) were used in this study. Opioid hyperalgesia and analgesic tolerance were induced with daily intraperitoneal injections of morphine (10 mg/kg) for 8 consecutive days (15.Chen S.R. Prunean A. Pan H.M. Welker K.L. Pan H.L. Resistance to morphine analgesic tolerance in rats with deleted transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1-expressing sensory neurons.Neuroscience. 2007; 145: 676-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Rats in the control group received daily intraperitoneal injections of the vehicle (saline). For behavioral experiments with live rats, intrathecal catheters were implanted during isoflurane-induced anesthesia. Briefly, each animal was placed prone on a stereotaxic frame, and a small incision was made at the back of the neck of the animal. A small puncture was made in the atlantooccipital membrane of the cisterna magna, and a catheter was then inserted such that the caudal tip reached the lumbar enlargement of the spinal cord (13.Chen S.R. Pan H.L. Blocking mu opioid receptors in the spinal cord prevents the analgesic action by subsequent systemic opioids.Brain Res. 2006; 1081: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15.Chen S.R.

Resistance to morphine analgesic tolerance in rats with deleted transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1-expressing sensory neurons.Neuroscience. 2007; 145: 676-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We then exteriorized the rostral end of the catheter and closed the wound with sutures. The animals were allowed to recover for 5 days before intrathecal injections, and rats displaying signs of motor or neurological dysfunction were excluded from the study. Drugs were injected intrathecally in a volume of 10 μl followed by a 10-μl flush with normal saline. All surgical preparation and experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center and conformed to National Institutes of Health guidelines on the ethical use of animals. The mechanical nociception of rats was assessed by the paw pressure test using an Ugo Basile analgesimeter (Varese, Italy). Noxious pressure was gradually applied to hind paws by pressing the device pedal to increase the force at a constant rate. The pedal was immediately released when the animal displayed pain by withdrawing the paw or vocalizing, and the nociceptive threshold of the animal was read on the scale. To avoid potential tissue injury, a maximum of 400 g was used as a cutoff (15.Chen S.R. Prunean A. Pan H.M. Welker K.L. Pan H.L.

Both hind paws were tested for each rat, and the mean value was used as the pressure nociceptive withdrawal threshold for that animal. To quantitatively assess the thermal nociceptive threshold, rats were tested with a thermal testing apparatus (IITC Inc., Woodland Hills, CA). The rats were allowed to acclimate for 30 min on a glass surface with the temperature maintained at 30 °C. A mobile radiant heat source was focused onto the plantar surface of the hind paw. The paw withdrawal latency was recorded using a timer. A cutoff of 30 s was used to prevent potential tissue damage (15.Chen S.R. Prunean A. Pan H.M. Welker K.L. Pan H.L.

Both of the hind paws were tested in each animal, and the mean value was used as the thermal nociceptive withdrawal threshold. Originally isolated from the cactus-like plant Euphorbia resinifera, resiniferatoxin (RTX) is an ultrapotent TRPV1 agonist (17.Szallasi A. Blumberg P.M. Annicelli L.L. Krause J.E. Cortright D.N.

Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane before receiving a single intraperitoneal injection of RTX (200 μg/kg, LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA) dissolved in a mixture of 10% ethanol and 10% Tween 80 in normal saline. Rats in the control group received a single intraperitoneal injection of the vehicle. Morphine treatment was conducted 7 days after the RTX and vehicle injections. The effect of RTX on TRPV1-expressing dorsal root ganglion neurons and central terminals was confirmed by using double labeling of TRPV1 and Griffonia simplicifolia isolectin B4 (IB4, a marker for unmyelinated afferent neurons and fibers) in the dorsal root ganglion and spinal dorsal horn in rats 7 days after RTX or vehicle injection, as described previously (13.Chen S.R.

The lumbar segment of the spinal cord was rapidly removed through laminectomy after the rats were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane. The lumbar spinal cord tissues were immediately placed in ice-cold sucrose artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing (in mm) 234 sucrose, 3.6 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 2.5 CaCl2, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 25.0 NaHCO3, and 12.0 glucose. The spinal cord was placed in a gelatin block and glued onto the stage of a vibratome. Transverse spinal cord slices were cut (400 μm in thickness) in ice-cold sucrose artificial cerebrospinal fluid and then transferred in Krebs solution presaturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 34 °C for at least 1 h before being transferred to the recording chamber. Neurons in the lamina II outer zone were visualized on a fixed stage microscope (BX50WI; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with differential interference contrast/infrared illumination. Lamina II of the spinal cord is the central site of termination of the majority of unmyelinated C-fibers carrying nociceptive information (20.Pan H.L. Khan G.M. Alloway K.D. Chen S.R.

The impedance of the glass electrode was 4–7 MΩ when the pipette was filled with the internal solution containing (in mm) 135 potassium gluconate, 5 KCl, 2.0 MgCl2, 0.5 CaCl2, 5.0 HEPES, 5.0 EGTA, 5.0 ATP-Mg, 0.5 Na-GTP, and 10 QX314 (adjusted to pH 7.25 with 1.0 m CsOH, 280–300 mosm). The slice was continuously perfused with Krebs solution at 5.0 ml/min at 34 °C. Spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) were recorded in the presence of 2 μm strychnine and 10 μm bicuculline at a holding potential of −60 mV. In addition, EPSCs were evoked from the dorsal root using a bipolar tungsten electrode connected to a stimulator (0.2 ms, 0.3–0.5 mA, 0.1 Hz; Grass Instruments, Quincy, MA). NMDAR-mediated EPSCs (NMDAR-EPSCs) were recorded in the presence of 2 μm strychnine, 10 μm bicuculline, and 20 μm 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione at a holding potential of +40 mV (24.Li D.P. Yang Q. Pan H.M. Pan H.L. Pre- and postsynaptic plasticity underlying augmented glutamatergic inputs to hypothalamic presympathetic neurons in spontaneously hypertensive rats.J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 1637-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To determine the paired-pulse ratio, two EPSCs were evoked by a pair of stimuli given at 50-ms intervals. The paired-pulse ratio was expressed as the ratio of the amplitudes of the second and first synaptic responses (14.Zhou H.Y. Chen S.R. Chen H. Pan H.L. Opioid-induced long-term potentiation in the spinal cord is a presynaptic event.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 4460-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The input resistance was monitored, and the recording was abandoned if it changed by more than 15%. EPSCs were recorded using an amplifier (MultiClamp 700A, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), filtered at 1–2 kHz, and digitized at 10 kHz. To directly determine postsynaptic NMDAR activity, currents were elicited by puff application of 100 μm NMDA to the recorded neuron in the extracellular solution containing a low concentration of Mg2+ (0.1 mm), 10 μm glycine, and 1 μm tetrodotoxin at a holding potential of −60 mV and using the pipette internal solution containing (in mm) 110.0 Cs2SO4, 2.0 MgCl2, 0.1 CaCl2, 1.1 EGTA, 10.0 HEPES, 2.0 MgATP, and 0.3 Na2GTP (pH was adjusted to 7.25 with 1.0 m CsOH (280–300 mosm)) (24.Li D.P. Yang Q. Pan H.M. Pan H.L. Pre- and postsynaptic plasticity underlying augmented glutamatergic inputs to hypothalamic presympathetic neurons in spontaneously hypertensive rats.J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 1637-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Similarly, to examine postsynaptic AMPAR function, currents were elicited similarly but with 100 μm AMPA (25.Li D.P. Byan H.S. Pan H.L. Switch to glutamate receptor 2-lacking AMPA receptors increases neuronal excitability in hypothalamus and sympathetic drive in hypertension.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The puff electrode was placed about 150 μm away from the neuron being recorded. Puff application of NMDA or AMPA was performed using a Pressure System IIe (4 p.s.i., 15 ms; Toohey Co., Fairfield, NJ). All drugs were freshly prepared in artificial cerebrospinal fluid before the experiments and delivered via syringe pumps to reach their final concentrations. Chelerythrine, NMDA, and AMPA were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. (Rp)-cAMPS was obtained from Tocris. Ro 25-6981, AP5, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, bicuculline, and tetrodotoxin were purchased from Ascent Scientific. All data are expressed as means ± S.E. To determine the amplitude of the evoked EPSCs, at least 10 consecutive EPSCs were averaged and analyzed off-line with Clampfit 10.0 software. sEPSCs were analyzed off-line using the Mini Analysis peak detection program (Synaptosoft, Leonia, NJ). The cumulative probability of the amplitude and the inter-event interval of the sEPSCs were compared using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, which estimates the probability that two distributions are similar. We used Student's t test to compare two groups and one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's post hoc test to compare more than two groups. Two-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test was used to determine the difference in the development of hyperalgesia and opioid tolerance between the vehicle-treated and AP5-treated groups. A p value of < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. We previously showed that brief exposure to the μ-opioid receptor agonist (D-Ala2, N-Me-Phe4, Gly-ol5)-enkephalin increases glutamatergic input to dorsal horn neurons (14.Zhou H.Y. Chen S.R. Chen H. Pan H.L. Opioid-induced long-term potentiation in the spinal cord is a presynaptic event.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 4460-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of chronic morphine treatment on glutamatergic input to dorsal horn neurons, we recorded sEPSCs in the spinal cord slices from vehicle- and morphine-treated rats. The frequency of sEPSCs of lamina II neurons was significantly higher in the morphine-treated group (n = 11 neurons) than in the vehicle-treated group (n = 13 neurons), but the difference in the amplitude of sEPSCs was not significantly different (Fig. 1, A–C). To determine the role of NMDARs in the control of glutamatergic input to dorsal horn neurons, we tested the effect of AP5, a selective NMDAR antagonist (26.Olverman H.J. Jones A.W. Watkins J.C. l-Glutamate has higher affinity than other amino acids for [3H]-d-AP5 binding sites in rat brain membranes.Nature. 1984; 307: 460-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), on sEPSCs. We have shown that 50 μm AP5 completely blocks NMDAR-mediated EPSCs (24.Li D.P. Yang Q. Pan H.M. Pan H.L. Pre- and postsynaptic plasticity underlying augmented glutamatergic inputs to hypothalamic presympathetic neurons in spontaneously hypertensive rats.J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 1637-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Bath application of 50 μm AP5 significantly decreased the frequency, but not the amplitude, of sEPSCs of lamina II neurons in the same morphine-treated rats (n = 11 neurons, Fig. 1, B and C). However, AP5 application had no significant effects on the frequency and amplitude of sEPSCs of lamina II neurons in vehicle-treated rats (n = 13 neurons, Fig. 1, A and C). To determine the role of presynaptic NMDARs in glutamatergic input increased by morphine treatment, we recorded sEPSCs in separate lamina II neurons by including the NMDAR channel blocker MK-801 in the pipette solution to block the postsynaptic NMDARs. We have shown that intracellular dialysis of 1 mm MK-801 completely blocked the postsynaptic NMDARs within 15 min (14.Zhou H.Y. Chen S.R. Chen H. Pan H.L. Opioid-induced long-term potentiation in the spinal cord is a presynaptic event.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 4460-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In all 11 neurons recorded with MK-801, AP5 still significantly reduced the frequency of sEPSCs in morphine-treated rats (p < 0.05, Fig. 1D). These results suggest that chronic morphine increases glutamatergic input to spinal dorsal horn neurons by enhancing presynaptic NMDAR activity. To determine whether NMDARs at primary afferent terminals play a role in increased glutamate release to spinal dorsal horn neurons, monosynaptic EPSCs were evoked from the dorsal root in vehicle- and morphine-treated rats. These EPSCs were identified on the basis of the constant latency and absence of conduction failure of evoked EPSCs in response to a 20-Hz electrical stimulation, as we described previously (14.Zhou H.Y. Chen S.R. Chen H. Pan H.L. Opioid-induced long-term potentiation in the spinal cord is a presynaptic event.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 4460-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 27.Zhou H.Y. Chen S.R. Chen H. Pan H.L. Sustained inhibition of neurotransmitter release from nontransient receptor potential vanilloid type 1-expressing primary afferents by μ-opioid receptor activation-enkephalin in the spinal cord.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2008; 327: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this protocol, we used a fixed stimulation intensity to evoke AMPAR-EPSCs in vehicle-treated and morphine-treated rats. The amplitude of AMPAR-EPSCs of lamina II neurons was significantly higher in morphine-treated rats than in vehicle-treated rats (n = 9 neurons, Fig. 2, A and B). Bath application of 50 μm AP5 significantly reduced the amplitude of monosynaptic EPSCs of lamina II neurons in morphine-treated rats (n = 11 neurons, Fig. 2, A and B). Also, the effect of AP5 on evoked monosynaptic EPSCs of morphine-treated rats was associated with a decrease in the paired-pulse ratio (Fig. 2C). However, AP5 had no significant effect on the amplitude of monosynaptic EPSCs of lamina II neurons recorded from vehicle-treated rats (n = 14 neurons, Fig. 2, A and B). In another nine lamina II neurons from morphine-treated rats, 1 mm MK-801 was included in the internal pipette solution and dialyzed for 15 min to block postsynaptic NMDARs before EPSCs were recorded. In all nine neurons, bath application of 50 μm AP5 still significantly reduced the amplitude of monosynaptic AMPAR-EPSCs evoked from the dorsal root (Fig. 2, A and B). Taken together, these results indicate that chronic morphine increases presynaptic NMDAR activity at primary afferent terminals in the spinal cord. Chronic opioid treatment results in significant increases in adenylyl cyclase activity and in basal levels of cAMP in the central nervous system (28.Avidor-Reiss T. Nevo I. Saya D. Bayewitch M. Vogel Z. Opiate-induced adenylyl cyclase superactivation is isozyme-specific.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5040-5047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 29.Jolas T.

Chronic morphine increases GABA tone on serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus: association with an up-regulation of the cyclic AMP pathway.Neuroscience. 2000; 95: 433-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To determine whether cAMP-dependent PKA is involved in increased presynaptic NMDAR activity by chronic morphine, we used (Rp)-cAMPS, a highly selective and membrane-permeable PKA inhibitor. (Rp)-cAMPS competes with cAMP for the binding sites on the regulatory subunit of PKA and, when bound, prevents release of the free catalytic subunit (30.Connelly P.A. Botelho L.H. Sisk R.B. Garrison J.C. A study of the mechanism of glucagon-induced protein phosphorylation in isolated rat hepatocytes using (Sp)-cAMPS and (Rp)-cAMPS, the stimulatory and inhibitory diastereomers of adenosine cyclic 3′,5′-phosphorothioate.J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4324-4332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that 100 μm (Rp)-cAMPS inhibits PKA activity in brain slices (31.Xie C.W. Lewis D.V. Involvement of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in μ-opioid modulation of NMDA-mediated synaptic currents.J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 78: 759-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Incubation with 100 μm (Rp)-cAMPS in the spinal cord slices from morphine-treated rats for 1–2 h had no significant effect on the base-line frequency of sEPSCs (n = 11 neurons) or the amplitude of monosynaptic EPSCs (n = 12 neurons) of lamina II neurons evoked from the dorsal root (Fig. 3, A and C). Furthermore, bath application of 50 μm AP5 still significantly inhibited the frequency of sEPSCs and the amplitude of evoked EPSCs in all lamina II neurons tested in the spinal cord slices treated with (Rp)-cAMPS (Fig. 3, B and D). Intrathecal administration of PKC inhibitors can reverse or attenuate opioid tolerance induced by chronic morphine administration (32.Granados-Soto V. Kalcheva I. Hua X. Newton A. Yaksh T.L. Spinal PKC activity and expression: role in tolerance produced by continuous spinal morphine infusion.Pain. 2000; 85: 395-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Increased PKC activity can promote NMDAR surface expression and regulate the channel gating (33.Lan J.Y. Skeberdis V.A. Jover T. Grooms S.Y. Lin Y. Araneda R.C. Zheng X. Bennett M.V. Zukin R.S.

https://openalex.org/W1972259310,"Hyperphosphatemia in chronic kidney disease is highly associated with vascular calcification. Previous studies have shown that high phosphate-induced phenotypic switching of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) into osteogenic cells plays an important role in the calcification process. In the present study, we determined whether Krüppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) and phosphorylated Elk-1, transcriptional repressors of SMC differentiation marker genes activated by intimal atherogenic stimuli, contributed to this process. Rat aortic SMCs were cultured in the medium with normal (0.9 mmol/liter) or high (4.5 mmol/liter) phosphate concentration. Results showed that high phosphate concentration induced SMC calcification. Moreover, high phosphate decreased expression of SMC differentiation marker genes including smooth muscle α-actin and SM22α, whereas it increased expression of osteogenic genes, such as Runx2 and osteopontin. High phosphate also induced Klf4 expression, although it did not phosphorylate Elk-1. In response to high phosphate, Klf4 selectively bound to the promoter regions of SMC differentiation marker genes. Of importance, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Klf4 blunted high phosphate-induced suppression of SMC differentiation marker genes, as well as increases in expression of osteogenic genes and calcium deposition. Klf4 was also induced markedly in the calcified aorta of adenine-induced uremic rats. Results provide novel evidence that Klf4 mediates high phosphate-induced conversion of SMCs into osteogenic cells."

https://openalex.org/W2045979076,"UBC13 is the only known E2 ubiquitin (Ub)-conjugating enzyme that produces Lys-63-linked Ub chain with its cofactor E2 variant UEV1a or MMS2. Lys-63-linked ubiquitination is crucial for recruitment of DNA repair and damage response molecules to sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). A deubiquitinating enzyme OTUB1 suppresses Lys-63-linked ubiquitination of chromatin surrounding DSBs by binding UBC13 to inhibit its E2 activity independently of the isopeptidase activity. OTUB1 strongly suppresses UBC13-dependent Lys-63-linked tri-Ub production, whereas it allows di-Ub production in vitro. The mechanism of this non-canonical OTUB1-mediated inhibition of ubiquitination remains to be elucidated. Furthermore, the atomic level information of the interaction between human OTUB1 and UBC13 has not been reported. Here, we determined the crystal structure of human OTUB1 in complex with human UBC13 and MMS2 at 3.15 Å resolution. The presented atomic-level interactions were confirmed by surface-plasmon resonance spectroscopy with structure-based mutagenesis. The designed OTUB1 mutants cannot inhibit Lys-63-linked Ub chain formation in vitro and histone ubiquitination and 53BP1 assembly around DSB sites in vivo. Finally, we propose a model for how capping of di-Ub by the OTUB1-UBC13-MMS2/UEV1a complex efficiently inhibits Lys-63-linked tri-Ub formation."

This suggests a close relationship between PCA and angiogenesis. Mast cells increase vascular permeability by heparin-initiated bradykinin formation (8.Oschatz C. Maas C. Lecher B. Jansen T.

These reports suggest that allergic inflammation involves vascular permeability and angiogenesis. Glucocorticoid resistance in asthma is associated with the reduced HDAC2 (histone deacetylase 2) activity (12.Li L.B. Leung D.Y. Martin R.J. Goleva E.

The reduction of HDAC2 results from post-translational modification, such as tyrosine nitration (15.Adenuga D. Yao H. March T.H. Seagrave J. Rahman I.

Trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of HDAC(s), attenuates airway inflammation in a mouse asthma model by decreasing expression of Th2 cytokines (17.Choi J.H. Oh S.W. Kang M.S. Kwon H.J. Oh G.T.

HDAC3 expression is induced by antigen stimulation in RBL2H3 cells via NF-κB (18.Kim Y. Eom S. Kim K. Lee Y.S. Choe J. Hahn J.H. Lee H. Kim Y.M. Ha K.S. Ro J.Y. Jeoung D.

Immunol. 2010; 47: 1010-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). NF-κB, activated by TNF-α, induces chronic inflammation in the adipose tissues by inhibiting expression of cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase in adipocytes through activation of HDAC3 (19.Zhang J. Henagan T.M. Gao Z. Ye J. Inhibition of glyceroneogenesis by histone deacetylase 3 contributes to lipodystrophy in mice with adipose tissue inflammation.Endocrinology. 2011; 152: 1829-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This implies a role of HDAC3 in inflammation. We examined the role of HDAC3 in allergic skin inflammation with respect to FcϵRI (Fcϵ receptor I) signaling. We investigated molecular mechanisms of HDAC3-mediated allergic skin inflammation and identified a downstream target of HDAC3. We investigated molecular mechanisms of expression regulation of this target gene by HDAC3. We examined whether HDAC3 activity and MCP1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1), a downstream target of HDAC3, were necessary for allergic skin inflammation in relation with angiogenesis. RBL2H3 cells were obtained from the Korea Cell Line Bank (Seoul, Korea). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cultures were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Bone marrow-derived mouse mast cells were isolated and cultured according to the standard procedures (20.Kim D.Y. Jeoung D. Ro J.Y. Signaling pathways in the activation of mast cells cocultured with astrocytes and colocalization of both cells in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis.J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Ears of BALB/c mice were cut into fragments and incubated in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 25% fetal bovine serum, 1.5 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.5 mg/ml hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.2 mg/ml protease (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.5 mg/ml DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich) for 60 min at 37 °C. Dispersed cells were filtered sequentially through 70- and 40-μm cell strainers (BD Biosciences). The pelleted cells were resuspended in RPMI1640 medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and submitted to a continuous isotonic Percoll gradient (72%) for mast cell isolation. Purified mast cells were resuspended in RPMI-FBS. The cell purity (>96%) and viability (>98%) were evaluated by toluidine blue and trypan blue exclusion staining, respectively. Five-week-old female BALB/c mice were purchased from Nara Biotech (Seoul, Korea) and maintained in specific pathogen-free conditions. All animal experiments were approved by the institutional review board for animal studies of Kangwon National University. Construction of siRNA was carried out according to the instruction manual provided by the manufacturer (Ambion, Austin, TX). To induce IgE-dependent TpCR in the ear of female BALB/c mice, mice were sensitized by injecting mouse anti-DNP monoclonal IgE antibody (10 μg/kg) intravenously. Twenty-four hours later, a cutaneous reaction was evoked by painting with 25 μl of 0.15% DNFB acetone-olive oil (3:1) solution onto each surface of both ear lobes. Ear thickness was measured by using a digital gauge. In order to examine the effect of HDAC3 on TpCR, scrambled (100 nm) or HDAC3 siRNA (100 nm) was injected intravenously on the day of IgE sensitization. To examine the effect of MCP1 on TpCR, neutralizing MCP1 (nMCP1) antibody (10 μg/kg) or isotype-matched IgG (10 μg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally on the day of IgE sensitization and 2 days after DNFB stimulation. Ear samples of BALB/c mice were fixed in 10% (v/v) buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 4–6 μm, and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin to examine the extent of lymphocyte infiltration. Immunohistochemistry staining of ear or lung tissues was performed by using the avidin-biotin detection method (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). Briefly, 4–6-μm-thick sections of the paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were cut, mounted on positively charged glass slides, and dried in an oven at 56 °C for 30 min. The sections were deparaffinized in xylene and then rehydrated in graded ethanol and water. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked by incubation in 3% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide for 15 min. Antigen retrieval was accomplished by pretreatment of the sections with citrate buffer at pH 6.0 for 20 min at 56 °C in a microwave oven and then allowing the sections to cool for 30 min at room temperature. Nonspecific endogenous protein binding was blocked using 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). The sections were then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The following primary antibodies were used for detection of proteins: anti-HDAC3 (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-MCP1 (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Isotype-matched control IgG antibody (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was employed to serve as a negative control. After washing, biotinylated secondary antibodies were applied at 1:100 or 1:200 dilutions for 1 h. Color was developed with diaminobenzidine (Vector Laboratories Inc.). Sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin. RBL2H3 cells were seeded onto glass coverslips in 24-well plates and were sensitized with DNP-specific IgE (100 ng/ml) for 16 h. After stimulation with DNP-HSA (100 ng/ml) for 1 h, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (v/v) for 10 min and then permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Nonspecific antibody binding sites were blocked by incubation with 1% BSA in TBST for 30 min. Cells were then incubated with primary antibody specific to HDAC3 (1:200; BD Biosciences) or FcϵRIβ (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 2 h, followed by washing with TBS-T three times. Anti-goat IgG-FITC (for detection of HDAC3) or anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 586 (for detection of FcϵRIβ) secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) was added to cells and incubated for 1 h. Coverslips were then washed and mounted by applying Mount solution (Biomeda, Foster City, CA). Fluorescence images were acquired using a confocal laser-scanning microscope and software (Fluoview version 2.0) with a ×60 objective (Olympus FV300, Tokyo, Japan). To examine the effect of TSA on co-localization of HDAC3 with FcϵRIβ, IgE-sensitized RBL2H3 cells were incubated with TSA (50 nm) for 12 h prior to stimulation with DNP-HSA. BALB/c mice were passively sensitized with an intradermal injection of DNP-specific IgE (0.5 μg/kg) into both ears. The mice were challenged 24 h later with an intravenous injection of DNP-HSA (250 μg/kg) plus 250 μl of PBS containing 2% (v/v) Evans blue solution. Thirty minutes after DNP-HSA challenge, the mice were euthanized, and the 2% (v/v) Evans blue dye was extracted from each dissected ear in 700 μl of acetone/water (7:3) at room temperature overnight. The absorbance of Evans blue in the extracts was measured with a spectrophotometer at 620 nm. In order to examine the effect of MCP1 on PCA, BALB/c mice were passively sensitized with an intradermal injection of DNP-specific IgE (0.5 μg/kg) along with neutralizing MCP1 antibody (10 μg/kg) or IgG (10 μg/kg). The mice were challenged 24 h later with an intravenous injection of DNP-HSA (250 μg/kg) plus 250 μl of PBS containing 2% (v/v) Evans blue solution. Mouse ear tissues were dissected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and then crushed into a fine powder with a mortar and pestle. Total protein lysates were made by suspension of crushed tissue in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholic acid, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) containing protease inhibitors and incubation at 4 °C for 30 min with constant agitation. Insoluble material was then removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Western blot analysis was performed using 20 μg of total protein. Expression levels of cytokine/chemokines were determined by using a Proteom ProfilerTM mouse cytokine array kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). The antibody immunoprecipitates were reverse cross-linked. To examine the binding of HDAC3 or HDAC2 to MCP1 promoter sequences, PCR was done on the phenol/chloroform-extracted DNA with specific primers of MCP1 promoter-1 (5′-AGTGAGCAAGGTTGACAGGAAGCA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTGTTCTCCACGGAGTTGCCCTTG-3′ (antisense)), MCP1 promoter-2 (5′-GCAT TGACCAAAGTCCATGGGCAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGCCTGGGAGGTCACCATTGGAAA-3′ (antisense)), and MCP1 promoter-3 (5′-GATGATGCTGCTCCTTGGCA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCAACCCAAGCCCTTCTTTG-3′ (antisense)). To examine binding of HDAC3 to HDAC2 promoter sequences, PCR was done on the phenol/chloroform-extracted DNA with specific primers of HDAC2 promoter-1 (5′-ATGCAAGTGCTTAGAACTGTACC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCCCCAGTGCCTGGTAGCCTA-3′ (antisense)), HDAC2 promoter-2 (5′-TAGGCTACCAGGCACTGGGGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGTGAACAACCTGCGCAAGG-3′ (antisense)) and HDAC2 promoter-3 (5′-CCTTGCGCAGGTTGTTCACC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTCCTCCTCCTGCTGCTGCTG-3′ (antisense)). In brief, 96-well plates were coated with 30 μl of Matrigel/well and polymerized in an incubator. Aortas isolated from 6-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were cleared of periadventitial fat and connective tissues in cold PBS and cut into rings of 1–1.5 mm in circumference. The aortic rings were randomized into wells and sealed with a 30-μl overlay of Matrigel. PBS or mouse recombinant MCP1 (100 ng/ml in PBS) was added. After 6 days, the extent of microvessel sprouting was determined by using an inverted microscope (magnification, 100×; Olympus). The assay was scored from 0 (negative) to 5 (most positive) in a double-blinded manner. In order to examine effect of HDAC3 on angiogenesis, BALB/c mice were given an intravenous injection of scrambled (100 nm) or HDAC3 siRNA (100 nm) twice in a total of 5 days. Mouse ears were fixed in 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde and blocked with TNB buffer (NEN Life Science Products) containing 0.3% Triton X-100. Primary antibody, rabbit anti-CD31 (PECAM-1) was diluted in TNB buffer, and ear samples were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The samples were then washed three times and subsequently incubated with the secondary antibody, anti-rabbit IgG Alex 488 (Molecular Probes, Inc.). In order to examine the relationship between PCA and angiogenesis, anti-DNP-specific IgE (0.5 μg) was injected into ears of BALB/c mice. The next day, the mice were challenged with intravenous injection of 250 μg of DNP-HSA in 250 μl of PBS. The mice were injected with DNP-HSA twice in a total of 6 days before whole mount staining employing anti-PECAM-1 antibody. The β-hexosaminidase secretion assay was performed according to standard procedures (18.Kim Y. Eom S. Kim K. Lee Y.S. Choe J. Hahn J.H. Lee H. Kim Y.M. Ha K.S. Ro J.Y. Jeoung D. Transglutaminase II interacts with Rac1, regulates production of reactive oxygen species, expression of snail, secretion of Th2 cytokines, and mediates in vitro and in vivo allergic inflammation.Mol. Immunol. 2010; 47: 1010-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In order to examine the in vivo effect of HDAC3 or MCP1 on β-hexosaminidase, ear tissue lysates (20 μg) of a BALB/c mouse of each experimental group were used. Serum histamine level was measured according to the manufacturer's instructions (SPI-Bio). For serum histamine levels, blood from each mouse was collected by cardiac puncture under anesthesia. To measure the cellular histamine level, culture supernatants were used. Data were analyzed and graphed using the GraphPad Prism statistics program (GraphPad Software). Results are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using t tests with differences between means considered significant when p was <0.05. The induction of HDAC3 in antigen-stimulated RBL2H3 cells was reported (18.Kim Y. Eom S. Kim K. Lee Y.S. Choe J. Hahn J.H. Lee H. Kim Y.M. Ha K.S. Ro J.Y. Jeoung D. Transglutaminase II interacts with Rac1, regulates production of reactive oxygen species, expression of snail, secretion of Th2 cytokines, and mediates in vitro and in vivo allergic inflammation.Mol. Immunol. 2010; 47: 1010-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We examined a role of HDAC3 in allergic inflammation reaction. For this, we employed a BALB/c mouse model of TpCR. Ear swelling was seen at 1 h and 24 h after DNFB stimulation on ears (Fig. 1A). Increased ear swelling was also seen at 7 days after antigen stimulation (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis of BALB/c mouse ear tissue lysates showed induction of HDAC3 (Fig. 1B). This increased expression of HDAC3 was sustained up to 7 days after antigen stimulation (Fig. 1B). The in vivo down-regulation of HDAC3 by siRNA exerted a negative effect on increased ear thickness by DNFB stimulation (Fig. 1C). BALB/c mice that received DNFB alone did not show changes in ear thickness (Fig. 1C). In vivo down-regulation of HDAC3 prevented antigen from inducing expression of C-Kit and tryptase, marker proteins for mast cell activation (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, we found an interaction between HDAC3 and FcϵRIβ by antigen stimulation (Fig. 1D). HDAC3 was necessary for an interaction between FcϵRIβ and Lyn, an essential molecule for FcϵRI signaling (Fig. 1D). Mast cells isolated from ear tissues of BALB/c mice showed an interaction between HDAC3 and FcϵRIβ and an interaction between HDAC3 and Lyn by DNFB stimulation (supplemental Fig. 1). Mast cells isolated from ear tissues of BALB/c mice also showed an increased expression of HDAC3 and Lyn by DNFB stimulation (supplemental Fig. 1). Taken together, these results suggest that HDAC3 is necessary for TpCR. Because HDAC3 showed an interaction with FcϵRIβ in a BALB/c mouse model of TpCR (Fig. 1D), we examined whether HDAC3 activity was required for this interaction. Antigen (DNP-HSA) stimulation induced an interaction between HDAC3 and FcϵRIβ and also induced an interaction between HDAC3 and Lyn in antigen-stimulated RBL2H3 cells and BMMCs (Fig. 2, A and B). TSA, an inhibitor of HDAC(s), prevented an interaction between HDAC3 and FcϵRIβ and also prevented interaction between HDAC3 and Lyn (Fig. 2, A and B). TSA did not affect expression of HDAC3, HDAC5, or HDAC2 in antigen-stimulated RBL2H3 cells (Fig. 2A) or in BMMCs (Fig. 2B). TSA did not affect expression of Lyn in these cell lines (data not shown). Immunofluorescence staining showed a partial co-localization of HDAC3 with FcϵRI in RBL2H3 cells (Fig. 2C). TSA inhibited co-localization of HDAC3 with FcϵRIβ (Fig. 2C). Sodium butyrate, an inhibitor of HDAC(s), inhibited an interaction between HDAC3 and FcϵRIβ and also inhibited an interaction between HDAC3 and Lyn (supplemental Fig. 2A). Sodium butyrate did not affect expression of HDAC3, HDAC5, or HDAC2 (supplemental Fig. 2A). Sodium butyrate inhibited co-localization of HDAC3 with FcϵRIβ (supplemental Fig. 2B). Taken together, HDAC3 activity is necessary for an interaction between HDAC3 and FcϵRIβ, and HDAC3 may mediate FcϵRI signaling. In order to examine the mechanism of HDAC3-mediated TpCR, serum of BALB/c mice, obtained 24 h after painting of DNFB on ear, was subjected to cytokine array analysis. DNFB induced secretion of MCP1 (Fig. 3A). DNFB also induced secretion of C5a, well known stimulator of anaphylaxis (21.Albrecht E.A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Varambally S. Kumar-Sinha C. Barrette T.R. Sarma J.V. Ward P.A. C5a-induced gene expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 164: 849-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In vivo down-regulation of HDAC3 exerted a negative effect on secretion of MCP1, C5a, TIMP1, and sICAM1 in BALB/c mice stimulated with DNFB (Fig. 3A). Immunohistochemistry staining showed that HDAC3 was necessary for induction of MCP1 by antigen stimulation in a BALB/c mouse model of TpCR (Fig. 3B). TSA prevented induction of MCP1 by antigen stimulation (Fig. 3C), suggesting that HDAC3 activity is necessary for induction of MCP1. The down-regulation of HDAC3 prevented antigen from decreasing expression of HDAC2 and prevented antigen from inducing expression of MCP1 (Fig. 3D). However, the down-regulation of HDAC3 did not affect expression of Lyn (Fig. 3D). The down-regulation of FcϵRIβ prevented antigen from increasing expression of HDAC3 and MCP1 (Fig. 3E). The down-regulation of FcϵRIβ prevented antigen from decreasing expression of HDAC2 (Fig. 3E). The down-regulation of HDAC3 prevented an interaction between HDAC3 and FcϵRIβ and prevented an interaction between FcϵRIβ and Lyn (Fig. 3F). Taken together, HDAC3 acts downstream of FcϵRI and mediates the effect of FcϵRI on induction of MCP1. Because HDAC3 was necessary for induction of MCP1 (Fig. 3D), we examined the role of HDAC3 in expression regulation of MCP1. For this, ChIP assays were performed. MCP1 promoter sequences contain binding sites for transcription factors, such as AP1, Sp1, NF-κB, and Snail. Antigen stimulation induced binding of HDAC3, Sp1, and c-Jun to MCP1 promoter sequences (Fig. 4A). The down-regulation of HDAC3 prevented binding of Sp1 and c-Jun to MCP1 promoter sequences (Fig. 4A). TSA prevented binding of Sp1 and c-Jun to MCP1 promoter sequences (Fig. 4B). TSA prevented binding of HDAC3 to the AP1/Sp1 site of MCP1 promoter sequences (Fig. 4B). TSA did not affect binding of HDAC3 to the AP1/NF-κB or AP1/Sp1/Snail site of MCP1 promoter sequences (Fig. 4B). The down-regulation of HDAC3 (Fig. 4A) or TSA treatment (Fig. 4B) did not affect binding of NF-κB to MCP1 promoter sequences, suggesting that NF-κB may regulate expression of MCP1 independently of HDAC3. TSA inhibited an interaction between HDAC3 and Sp1 and also inhibited an interaction between HDAC3 and c-Jun (supplemental Fig. 3A). TSA inhibited induction of Sp1 and c-Jun by antigen stimulation (supplemental Fig. 3A). The down-regulation of HDAC3 showed the same effect as TSA on induction of Sp1 and c-Jun (supplemental Fig. 3B). The down-regulation of Sp1 or c-Jun inhibited induction of MCP1 and HDAC3 by antigen stimulation (supplemental Fig. 3C). These results suggest that HDAC3, through interaction with Sp1 or c-Jun, may be at least partially responsible for induction of MCP1. This is the first report that MCP1 expression is under the control of HDAC3. HDAC2 showed binding to MCP1 promoter sequences in the absence of antigen stimulation (Fig. 4C). The down-regulation of HDAC3 induced binding of HDAC2 to MCP1 promoter sequences (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that HDAC2 may act as a negative regulator of MCP1. The MCP1 promoter contains the binding site for YY1 (Fig. 4A). HDAC2 forms transcriptional repressor complexes by associating with many different proteins, including YY1, a mammalian zinc finger transcription factor (22.Glenn D.J. Wang F. Chen S. Nishimoto M. Gardner D.G. Endothelin-stimulated human B-type natriuretic peptide gene expression is mediated by Yin Yang 1 in association with histone deacetylase 2.Hypertension. 2009; 53: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It is probable that HDAC2 interacts with YY1 to bind to the YY1 site of MCP1 promoter sequences. We examined the mechanism of negative regulation of HDAC2 by HDAC3. Sp1 and c-Jun showed the binding to HDAC2 promoter sequences (supplemental Fig. 4A). The down-regulation of HDAC3 (supplemental Fig. 4A) or TSA treatment (supplemental Fig. 4B) decreased binding of Sp1 and c-Jun to HDAC2 promoter sequences. HDAC3 showed binding to the Sp1 site of HDAC2 promoter sequences (supplemental Fig. 4A). TSA did not affect binding of HDAC3 to the Sp1 site of HDAC2 promoter sequences (supplemental Fig. 4B), suggesting that binding of HDAC3 to the HDAC2 promoter does not regulate HDAC2 expression because TSA did not affect expression of HDAC3 or HDAC2 (Fig. 2, A and B). Taken together, HDAC3 regulates expression of MCP1, through interaction with Sp1 or c-Jun, to mediate allergic inflammation. It seems that HDAC3 does not exert transcriptional control over HDAC2 (supplemental Fig. 4, A and B). We examined the mechanism of expression regulation of HDAC2 in terms of post-translational modification. The role of reactive oxygen species in the down-regulation of HDAC(s) has been reported (23.Ito K. Lim S. Caramori G. Chung K.F. Barnes P.J. Adcock I.M.

However, little is known about how AHAs cause exfoliation to expose fresh skin cells. Here we report that the transient receptor potential vanilloid 3 (TRPV3) channel in keratinocytes is potently activated by intracellular acidification induced by glycolic acid. Patch clamp recordings and cell death assay of both human keratinocyte HaCaT cells and TRPV3-expressing HEK-293 cells confirmed that intracellular acidification led to direct activation of TRPV3 and promoted cell death. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that an N-terminal histidine residue, His-426, known to be involved in 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate-mediated TRPV3 activation, is critical for sensing intracellular proton levels. Taken together, our findings suggest that intracellular protons can strongly activate TRPV3, and TRPV3-mediated proton sensing and cell death in keratinocytes may serve as a molecular basis for the cosmetic use of AHAs and their therapeutic potential in acidic pH-related skin disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2139240786,"Membrane-sculpting BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs) domains form a crescent-shaped homodimer that can sense and induce membrane curvature through its positively charged concave face. We have recently shown that Arfaptin-2, which was originally identified as a binding partner for the Arf and Rac1 GTPases, binds to Arl1 through its BAR domain and is recruited onto Golgi membranes. There, Arfaptin-2 induces membrane tubules. Here, we report the crystal structure of the Arfaptin-2 BAR homodimer in complex with two Arl1 molecules bound symmetrically to each side, leaving the concave face open for membrane association. The overall structure of the Arl1·Arfaptin-2 BAR complex closely resembles that of the PX-BAR domain of sorting nexin 9, suggesting similar mechanisms underlying BAR domain targeting to specific organellar membranes. The Arl1·Arfaptin-2 BAR structure suggests that one of the two Arl1 molecules competes with Rac1, which binds to the concave face of the Arfaptin-2 BAR homodimer and may hinder its membrane association."

A primary human keratocystic odontogenic tumor cell population, KCOT-1, has been established from a tumor explant culture. The KCOT-1 cells were characterized by growth rate, gene expression profiles of major tooth enamel matrix proteins (EMPs), amelogenin (AMELX), enamelin (ENAM), ameloblastin (AMBN), amelotin (AMTN), tumor-related proteins enamelysin (MMP-20), kallikrein-4 (KLK-4), and odontogenic ameloblast-associated protein (ODAM) using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Cytokeratin 14 (CK14) was examined by immunohistochemistry. In addition, expression of the members of the sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway, SHH, patched (PTCH-1), smoothened (SMO), GLI-1, and GLI-2 and of the NOTCH signaling pathway, NOTCH-1, NOTCH-2, NOTCH-3, JAG-2 (Jagged-2), and Delta-like-1 (DLL-1) were evaluated. KCOT-1 cells were treated with SMO antagonist cyclopamine. We found that cyclopamine significantly arrested the growth of KCOT-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner and that the effects of cyclopamine were abolished by adding SHH protein. The protein expression of the SHH pathway was down-regulated by cyclopamine, further confirming that cyclopamine inhibits the SHH signaling pathway; SHH down-regulation correlated with the down-regulation of the NOTCH signaling pathway as well. In conclusion, using an established KCOT-1 cell population, we characterized the gene expression profiles related to the EMPs, SHH, and NOTCH signaling pathway and confirmed that cyclopamine significantly arrested the growth of KCOT-1 cells and may be a viable agent as a novel therapeutic.

Conclusion: HS1 tyrosine phosphorylation is critical for its interaction with Arp2/3 and efficient neutrophil chemotaxis. Significance: This work increases our understanding of how actin regulatory proteins mediate efficient cell migration. Neutrophils are key mediators of the innate immune response and are the first responders to sites of infection or acute injury. The rapid recruitment of neutrophils requires a highly specialized form of motility that translates chemoattractant signals from the environment into polarized intracellular signals that mediate directed protrusion and efficient migration (1.Weiner O.D.

Furthermore, defects in signaling pathways required for neutrophil chemotaxis are associated with primary immune deficiencies, such as congenital neutropenia and leukocyte adhesion deficiency (2.Cavnar P.J.

Downstream effectors of PIP3 include Src and Syk family tyrosine kinases, and Rho GTPases, such as Rac and Cdc42, which regulate the Arp2/3 complex and actin dynamics at the leading edge (7.Pollard T.D.

To establish and maintain polarity, these signaling mechanisms become amplified through positive feedback loops. For example, PIP3 stimulates Rac activation through binding to Rho GTPase guanine exchange factors (GEFs), and active Rac can further activate PI(3)-kinase at the leading edge of chemoattractant-stimulated neutrophils (10.Weiner O.D.

In addition, Hem-1, a scaffold component of the Scar/WAVE complex, can regulate actin polymerization by producing self-organizing waves of actin nucleation that provide a platform for cell signaling to mediate efficient neutrophil motility (11.Weiner O.D.

However, it remains unclear how neutrophils spatiotemporally coordinate these circuits to maximize migration efficiency, and what components are essential to regulate actin dynamics and signaling at the leading edge.

In this study, we used the neutrophil-like PLB-985 cell line to investigate the function of HS1. We demonstrate that HS1 is highly expressed in PLB-985 cells, and HS1 co-localizes with F-actin at the leading edge in neutrophils. We show that HS1 is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) in a process that is dependent on Src family kinases. Moreover, HS1 regulates Vav1 and Rac activation in response to fMLP.

In brief, differentiated PLB-985 cells were serum starved for 24 h in RPMI supplemented with 0.1% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and plated on 10 μg/ml fibrinogen for 10 min. Cells were stimulated with 1 μm fMLP for 1 min, immediately placed on ice, and lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 200 nm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% protease inhibitor mixture 2). 30 μg of bacterially expressed GST-PAK-Rac/Cdc42 (p21)-binding domain (PBD) was incubated with the lysates for 1 h at 4 °C. The affinity-precipitated products were run on SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted for Rac. Quantification of total Rac for all samples was normalized to control shRNA -fMLP. The mean ± S.E. ratio of Rac-GTP/Rac was graphed relative to control shRNA-fMLP from three independent experiments. Differentiated PLB-985 or HEK293 cells were placed in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 200 nm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% protease inhibitor mixture 2) on ice for 10 min and clarified by centrifugation. Protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoblotting of cell lysates was performed and blots were imaged with an infrared imaging system (Odyssey; LI-COR Biosciences). For immunoprecipitations, differentiated PLB-985 cells were plated on 10 μg/ml fibrinogen or 2% BSA for 10 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. In some cases cells were pre-treated for 30 min with 10 μm PP2 or pervanadate (100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 3 mm H2O2). Cells were stimulated with 1 μm fMLP for the indicated time and were lysed by addition of ice-cold lysis buffer and clarified by centrifugation. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA assay and equal protein amounts were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 3 μg of mouse anti-HS1 (BD Biosciences), rabbit anti-HS1 (Cell Signaling), mouse anti-Vav1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or mouse anti-GFP (Invitrogen). Immune complexes were captured on GammaBind G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare), washed three times in lysis buffer, and analyzed by immunoblotting. For HS1-GFP and Vav1-HA coimmunoprecipitations, HEK293 cells were transfected with GFP or HS1-GFP and Vav1-HA (32.Moores S.L. Selfors L.M. Fredericks J. Breit T. Fujikawa K. Alt F.W. Brugge J.S. Swat W. Vav family proteins couple to diverse cell surface receptors.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6364-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). GFP was immunoprecipitated with mouse anti-GFP (Invitrogen), captured on GammaBind G-Sepharose beads, and analyzed by immunoblotting for HA. 100,000 control shRNA and HS1 shRNA 2 cells were labeled with calcein AM (Invitrogen) and plated in the presence or absence of 100 nm fMLP for 30 min in quadruplicate in a 96-well black microplate (Greiner Bio-one) coated with fibrinogen, fibronectin, or ICAM-1 followed by blocking with 2% BSA at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Fluorescence was measured using a plate reader (Victor3 V; PerkinElmer). Plates were gently washed with mHBSS (HBSS, 20 mm HEPES, 0.1% HSA) in between readings until the remaining control shRNA -fMLP cells were <10% of the original input. Microfluidic devices were fabricated as previously described (33.Berthier E. Surfus J.C. Verbsky J. Huttenlocher A. Beebe D.J. An arrayed high-content chemotaxis assay for patient diagnosis.Integr. Biol. 2010; 2: 630-638Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In brief, the devices enable the generation of a static gradient of chemoattractant between a source chamber containing fMLP and a sink chamber containing the PLB-985 cells, which were connected by a 1-mm-long, 400-μm-wide channel in which the fMLP gradient is generated. Microfluidic chambers were coated with 20 μg/ml fibrinogen for 1 h at 37 °C in PBS. 3 μl of neutrophil suspension (4 × 106 cells/ml) was added to the device, and 1 μm fMLP was added to the source port. The gradient was allowed to set up and equilibrate in a 37 °C humidified chamber for 15 min before imaging. Time-lapse imaging was performed using a 10×, NA of 0.45, or 60×, NA of 1.4 objective and motorized stage (Ludl Electronic Products) on an inverted microscope (Eclipse TE300) using a charge-coupled device camera (CoolSNAP ES2) and captured into MetaVue imaging software v6.2. Images were taken every 30 s for 30–45 min with up to eight devices being imaged simultaneously. Tracking and velocity measurements were performed using ImageJ analysis software (National Institutes of Health). For immunofluorescence, cells were allowed to chemotax in the microfluidic devices for 20 min, then fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde and stained with antibodies following standard protocols. For statistical comparisons, unpaired t test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used with Tukey post-tests with p < 0.05 considered significant. To determine how HS1 regulates amoeboid cell chemotaxis, we used the myeloid leukemia cell line, PLB-985, which can be terminally differentiated into neutrophil-like cells with DMSO (34.Tucker K.A. Lilly M.B. Heck Jr., L. Rado T.A. Characterization of a new human diploid myeloid leukemia cell line (PLB-985) with granulocytic and monocytic differentiating capacity.Blood. 1987; 70: 372-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using immunoblotting to detect cortactin and HS1 in PLB-985 cells, we found that HS1, but not cortactin, is expressed in both differentiated and undifferentiated cells (Fig. 1B). HS1 is up-regulated in terminally differentiated PLB-985 cells, similar to actin and vinculin as reported previously (2.Cavnar P.J. Berthier E. Beebe D.J. Huttenlocher A. Hax1 regulates neutrophil adhesion and motility through RhoA.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 193: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), suggesting that HS1 expression is important for neutrophil function (Fig. 1B). To characterize the intracellular localization of HS1 during chemotaxis, we detected endogenous HS1 using immunofluorescent staining in both differentiated PLB-985 cells and human peripheral blood neutrophils (Fig. 1C). In unstimulated neutrophils, HS1 colocalized with F-actin at the cell periphery; upon stimulation with fMLP, HS1 colocalized with F-actin at the leading edge in polarized neutrophils during chemotaxis. To determine if Arp2/3 and F-actin binding mediates this localization, we ectopically expressed the N-terminal Arp2/3 and F-actin binding repeats of HS1 (HS1-ΔPS-GFP) in PLB-985 cells (Fig. 2). We found that the F-actin and Arp2/3 binding region of HS1 was sufficient for leading edge localization. In contrast, a HS1-GFP construct containing only the C-terminal proline-rich region and SH3 domain (HS1-PS-GFP) displayed a more diffuse localization, similar to GFP expression alone, suggesting that the F-actin binding region is critical for HS1 localization (Fig. 2 and supplemental Movies S1 and S2). To determine if HS1 is phosphorylated in chemoattractant stimulated neutrophils, we immunoprecipitated HS1 from fMLP-stimulated PLB-985 cells and immunoblotted for total phosphotyrosine (Fig. 3, A and B). We found that fMLP induced HS1 phosphorylation with maximal phosphorylation after 3 min of stimulation. Treatment of cells with the Src inhibitor PP2 abolished fMLP-induced HS1 phosphorylation, indicating that Src family kinases are necessary for HS1 phosphorylation. In addition, tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 was dependent on adhesion to fibrinogen because fMLP stimulation of cells plated on BSA did not significantly induce phosphorylation of HS1 (Fig. 3). To further characterize HS1 phosphorylation, an antibody to phospho-tyrosine 397 was used in fMLP-treated cells (Fig. 3, C and D). Accordingly, phosphorylation on Y397 induced by fMLP required both Src signaling and adhesion to fibrinogen (Fig. 3, C and D). Collectively, the data show that fMLP induces tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 in adherent neutrophils. To characterize the function of HS1 during neutrophil motility, HS1-deficient PLB-985 cells were generated using lentiviral delivered shRNA (Fig. 4A). Two unique shRNA targets were found to significantly deplete endogenous HS1 levels. Using transwell assays to investigate chemotaxis to fMLP, we found that HS1-deficient cells had impaired migration compared with control cells (Fig. 4B). The effects on migration were dependent on the efficiency of the knockdown, with more significant effects observed with HS1 shRNA 2. Neutrophil random motility was not affected by HS1 depletion, suggesting that the defect in motility was downstream of chemoattractant-induced signaling. To determine if the defects in migration were due to altered adhesion, adhesion assays to fibrinogen, fibronectin, and ICAM-1 were performed (Fig. 4C). We observed no significant defects in fMLP-induced neutrophil adhesion in HS1-deficient cells. To further characterize the chemotaxis of HS1-deficient PLB-985 cells, we used microfluidic gradient generation in custom-designed chemotaxis chambers that allow the precise control of chemoattractant gradients over extended durations under flow free conditions (Fig. 4D) (35.Abhyankar V.V.

Depletion of LSK cells by radiation or the cytotoxic chemical 5-fluorouracil results in an expansion of the LSK(-) population. In contrast, the LSK(-) population is reduced in CML mice, and depletion of leukemia stem cells (LSCs; BCR-ABL-expressing HSCs) by deleting Alox5 or by inhibiting heat shock protein 90 causes an increase in this LSK(-) population. The transition of LSK to LSK(-) cells is controlled by the Icsbp gene and its downstream gene Lyn, and regulation of this cellular transition is critical for the survival of normal LSK cells and LSCs. These results indicate a potential function of the LSK(-) cells in the regulation of LSK cells and LSCs."

Ran is a monomeric small GTPase belonging to the Ras-related superfamily of GTPases. Its GTP binding/GTP hydrolytic cycle is regulated by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), 2The abbreviations used are: GEFguanine nucleotide exchange factorCScalf serumMant-GDP2′-(or 3′)-O-(N-methyl-anthraniloyl)guanosine 5′-diphosphateEGFREGF receptor.

However, recent studies have suggested roles for this GTPase in cell growth regulation and malignant transformation. In particular, Ran has been reported to be overexpressed in a variety of tumor types and human cancer cell lines (8.Abe H. Kamai T. Shirataki H. Oyama T. Arai K. Yoshida K.

Cancer. 2006; 119: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The overexpression of Ran was also shown to stimulate anchorage-independent growth in a non-invasive mammary cell line and to function as a novel effector of osteopontin-mediated malignant transformation (12.Kurisetty V.V.

Our laboratory recently reported that an activated form of Ran, Ran(F35A), shows accelerated growth in low serum and supports anchorage-independent growth in normal fibroblasts (13.Ly T.K. Wang J.

However, the mechanisms by which Ran contributes to cellular transformation and tumorigenesis are still not clear, thus prompting us to examine in more detail how the hyperactivation of this small GTPase impacts cell growth. guanine nucleotide exchange factor calf serum 2′-(or 3′)-O-(N-methyl-anthraniloyl)guanosine 5′-diphosphate EGF receptor. A Ran GDP/GTP gradient between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is reported to drive nucleocytoplasmic transport (14.Görlich D. Panté N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. Identification of different roles for RanGDP and RanGTP in nuclear protein import.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). In interphase cells, the Ran GEF, RCC1, localizes to the nucleus where Ran is activated as a result of GDP-GTP exchange (1.Macara I.G. Transport into and out of the nucleus.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 2.Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Catalysis of guanine nucleotide exchange on Ran by the mitotic regulator RCC1.Nature. 1991; 354: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Ran GAP, however, is cytoplasmic and hydrolyzes Ran GTP to the GDP-bound state in the cytosol (3.Bischoff F.R. Krebber H. Kempf T. Hermes I. Ponstingl H. Human Ran GTPase-activating protein Ran GAP1 is a homologue of yeast Rna1p involved in mRNA processing and transport.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 1749-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 15.Stewart M. Molecular mechanism of the nuclear protein import cycle.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The distinct cellular location of RCC1 and Ran GAP generates a gradient for activated Ran molecules (highest in the nucleus) and therefore allows a direct coupling between the activation-deactivation cycle of Ran and nucleocytoplasmic transport. Given that the GTP binding/GTP hydrolytic cycle of Ran is linked to proper nucleocytoplasmic transport in cells, as well as to mitogenic signaling activities, we felt that it would be especially interesting to examine how mutants of Ran that are capable of an accelerated cycling between the GDP- and GTP-bound states influence cell growth. These mutants, unlike Ran(F35A), would exhibit an accelerated exchange of GDP for GTP, compared with wild-type Ran, while retaining GTP hydrolytic activity, such that they would not be irreversibly active and therefore should not block nucleocytoplasmic transport nor exhibit cellular toxicity. Indeed, a mutant of Cdc42, Cdc42(F28L), which was generated in our laboratory and exhibited constitutive nucleotide exchange (16.Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. A novel Cdc42Hs mutant induces cellular transformation.Curr.

Thus, in the present study, we set out to examine the effects of Ran mutants capable of accelerated GDP-GTP exchange on cell growth in both normal fibroblasts and in a human mammary adenocarcinoma cell line. In NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, we show that a novel activated Ran mutant, Ran(K152A), is able to effectively induce anchorage-independent growth and trigger signaling pathways that lead to ERK activation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Ran(K152A) stimulates the invasive activity of these cells. We then go on to show that Ran(K152A), when stably expressed in the human mammary SKBR3 adenocarcinoma cell line, enhances the ability of these breast cancer cells to grow in soft agar and causes a robust stimulation of both ERK and JNK. Microarray analysis identified the SMOC-2 protein as a potential modulator of Ran(K152A)-promoted cell growth. SMOC-2 belongs to the BM-40 family of modular matricellular proteins, which are secreted factors that mediate signaling between the extracellular matrix and the surface of cells through direct interactions with receptors or by synergizing with growth factors (20.Vannahme C. Gösling S. Paulsson M. Maurer P. Hartmann U. Characterization of SMOC-2, a modular extracellular calcium-binding protein.Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). SMOC-2 has been reported to potentiate angiogenesis (21.Rocnik E.F. Liu P. Sato K. Walsh K. Vaziri C. The novel SPARC family member SMOC-2 potentiates angiogenic growth factor activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22855-22864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) by interacting with growth factors such as FGF and VEGF, as well as to help promote integrin-dependent signals that regulate cell cycle progression (22.Liu P. Lu J. Cardoso W.V. Vaziri C. The SPARC-related factor SMOC-2 promotes growth factor-induced cyclin D1 expression and DNA synthesis via integrin-linked kinase.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 248-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We show that the gene expression of SMOC-2 is increased by at least 50-fold in cells stably expressing Ran(K152A) compared with cells expressing control vector. Moreover, knocking down SMOC-2 expression greatly reduces the ability of Ran(K152A) to stimulate anchorage-independent growth and cell invasion. Overall, these findings highlight a previously unappreciated role for Ran in cellular growth regulation that is dependent on the matricellular protein SMOC-2. Mant-GDP was obtained from Invitrogen and [γ-32P]GTP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Science. The HA antibody was obtained from Covance, whereas the phospho-ERK and phospho-JNK antibodies were from Cell Signaling. The vinculin antibody was obtained from Sigma. The wild-type Ran cDNA was cloned into either the pET-28a(+) vector (Novagen) or the HA-tagged pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to generate the Ran(F35A), Ran(D65I), Ran(D125E), Ran(K152A), and Ran(K152Q) mutants. The wild-type SMOC-2 cDNA was cloned into the Myc-tagged pcDNA3.1 vector, and the SMOC-2 siRNA-insensitive mutant was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. The primers designed for generating this mutant were as follows: 5′-GCC CGC GCA GAA GTT TAG CGC ACT CAC GTT CTT GAG-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CTC AAG AAC GTG AGT GCG CTA AAC TTC TGC GCG GGC-3′ (reverse primer). The Ran-pET-28a(+) plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3) bacterial cells. The cells were grown in LB broth containing 0.05 mg/ml kanamycin and 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for ∼6 h at 37 °C, harvested by centrifugation, and then lysed by freeze thaw and sonication in buffer A (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride, 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin, and 0.01 mg/ml aprotinin). The lysates were centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 45 min, and then the supernatants were collected, treated with 1 mm GDP at room temperature for 30 min, and loaded onto Talon resin columns that had been pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The columns were washed with 10 bed volumes of buffer A, and the samples were eluted in buffer A containing 300 mm imidazole. The samples were concentrated using centrifugal filters to ∼500 μl and loaded onto a Superdex 200 gel filtration column pre-equilibrated with 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.3 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (buffer B). Peak fractions were pooled, concentrated, and stored at −80 °C until needed. Protein purity was >95% based on SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining of the recombinant Ran proteins, with typical yields of 5–10 mg of purified Ran per liter of culture. Recombinant His-tagged Ran proteins were initially preloaded with Mant-GDP by combining 100 μm Ran, 2 mm Mant-GDP, and 10 mm EDTA in 100 μl of HMN buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl) in 1.5-ml tubes. The sample tubes were wrapped in foil and rotated for 30 min at room temperature. MgCl2 (40 mm) was then added to each tube, and the samples were passed over a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with HMN buffer. After 2.5 ml of HMN buffer flowed through the columns, fractions were collected in 500-μl aliquots for the next 2.5 ml of buffer. Protein was detected by Bradford reagent, and peak aliquots were pooled, concentrated, and stored at 4 °C. Mant-GDP dissociation from wild-type and mutant Ran proteins was determined on a Molecular Devices SPECTRAmax GEMINI XS microplate spectrofluorometer using Magellan software (version 2, Tecan). For each assay, Mant-GDP-bound Ran (4 μm) was incubated with 2 mm GTP in HMN buffer at a final volume of 300 μl in a 96-well plate. The excitation wavelength was 360 nm, whereas the emission wavelength was 465 nm. Both band widths were set at 35 nm. Fluorescence from each well was read at 10-min intervals. The final end point for Mant-GDP dissociation from Ran was determined by adding recombinant GST-RCC1 (100 nm) to the assay incubation. The rate of dissociation of Mant-GDP from Ran was determined by performing a nonlinear fit to a single exponential decay equation. NIH-3T3 cells were maintained in DMEM medium containing 10% calf serum (CS), whereas SKBR3 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). To generate stable cells lines, NIH-3T3 or SKBR3 cells were transfected with the HA-pcDNA3.1 vector alone or with the same vector containing one of the Ran constructs using Lipofectamine. The NIH-3T3 cells were then maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% CS and 1.3 mg/ml G418, whereas the transfected SKBR3 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and 750 μg/ml G418. After 10–14 days, G418-resistant colonies were selected and subcultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% CS and 1 mg/ml G418 for NIH-3T3 cells, or RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and 300 μg/ml G418 for SKBR3 cells. In some cases, NIH-3T3 cells were transfected transiently with plasmids encoding wild-type Ran or the different Ran mutants using Lipofectamine. NIH-3T3 or SKBR3 cells transiently expressing either HA-tagged wild-type Ran, Ran(D125E), or Ran(K152A) were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were then blocked in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin. Following blocking, the cells were incubated with the indicated primary antibodies for 2 h, rinsed with PBS, and then incubated with Oregon green-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) for an additional hour. The cells were then washed, mounted, and visualized using either the 40× or 63× objectives on a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescent microscope. Images were processed using IPLAB (Spectra Services). To determine the ability of the different Ran-expressing NIH-3T3 cell lines to grow in soft agar, 8 × 103 cells were mixed with DMEM supplemented with 10% CS and 0.3% agarose and plated on a solidified layer containing DMEM supplemented with 0.6% agarose and 10% CS. The cells were fed weekly by adding 1 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% CS and 0.3% agarose. After 10–12 days, colonies >50 μm were scored under a microscope. A similar procedure was followed to assess the ability of the SKBR3 cells stably expressing the indicated Ran constructs, with the exception of substituting RPMI 1640 and FBS for DMEM and CS, respectively. NIH-3T3 cells stably expressing the HA-pcDNA3.1 vector alone or the HA-tagged Ran(K152A) mutant, maintained in DMEM containing 10% CS, were seeded in serum-free DMEM at 2 × 104 cells/well in the upper chamber of a BD Biosciences Biocoat Matrigel invasion chamber. The invasion chambers were placed into the wells of a 24-well plate, and DMEM medium containing either no serum or 10% CS was added to the wells of the plate containing the chambers. The cultures were maintained in a humidified tissue incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 1 day. The cells that accumulated on the lower side of the filter were fixed with methanol, stained with Giemsa stain, and then scored. NIH-3T3 or SKBR3 cells stably expressing the HA-pcDNA3.1 vector alone, or one of the various HA-tagged Ran constructs, were lysed in 25 mm Tris, pH 7, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaVO4, and 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using phospho-ERK and phospho-JNK antibodies. The blots were reprobed with a vinculin antibody as a loading control. Gene expression studies were performed on serum-starved NIH-3T3 cells stably expressing Ran(K152A) and NIH-3T3 cells stably expressing the HA-pcDNA3.1 vector alone using the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 Array (version 2.0). Total RNA was extracted from each of the cell lines. Samples were collected from three separate plates for each experimental condition resulting in a total of six RNA samples used for whole genome gene expression analysis. Each sample was submitted to the Cornell Microarray Core facility, where RNA quantitation, quality assessment, cRNA synthesis and labeling, as well as array hybridization and scanning were performed. Gene expression data for a total of 45,101 probes were obtained. The mean of three replicate measurements was calculated for each experimental condition: averageK152A and averagevector alone. Probes that had less than a 2-fold change when comparing cells expressing Ran(K152A) versus vector alone (log2(averageK152A/averagevector) ≤ 1.0) were excluded. In addition, low intensity probes with fluorescent intensity values <20 in at least one of a total of six observations were excluded. As a result, a total of 4,000 probes that passed the fold change, and low intensity filters were used for further analysis. Average linkage hierarchical clustering of genes was performed using Cluster software (version 3.0) (40.Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Cluster analysis and display of genome-wide expression patterns.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13204) Google Scholar). Clustered trees and gene expression heat maps were viewed using Java Treeview software (41.Saldanha A.J. Java Treeview: Extensible visualization of microarray data.Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 3246-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2336) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) from cells that were serum-starved for 12–15 h. Reverse transcriptase (RT) reactions were performed with SuperScript III enzyme (Invitrogen), using oligo(dT) nucleotides as a primer. The RT reactions were then subjected to PCR using primer sets to amplify SMOC-2 (mouse); 5′-ACA CTC TGG ACC GAG CAA GT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCA TTG CAC TGG CTT GTA GA-3′ (reverse). To exclude the possibility of amplifying contaminating genomic DNA in our RNA preparations, RT reactions lacking the SuperScript III enzyme were subjected to PCR using the primer set for GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase), 5′-ATG TTC CAG TAT GAC TCC ACT CAC G-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAA GAC ACC AGT AGA CTC CAC GAC A-3′ (reverse). For semi-quantitative RT-PCR, the RT reactions were subjected to real-time PCR using Power SYBER Green PCR Master Mix and the 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Each reaction was performed in triplicate, and the amount of target RNA was normalized relative to the amount of GAPDH mRNA. The knockdown of SMOC-2 in cells was performed using Stealth siRNAs designed against the SMOC-2 transcript (Invitrogen). The sequences of the three SMOC-2-specific siRNAs that were used include the following: SMOC-2 siRNA 1, 5′-CAG AAG TTC TCA GCG CTC ACG TTC T-3′; SMOC-2 siRNA 2, 5′-AGG TGT GTG GCT GAG AGG AAG TAT A-3′; and SMOC-2 siRNA 3, 5′-GAA TGC AAT GAT GAC GGC ACC TAC A-3′. As a control, a Stealth siRNA negative control with medium GC content was used. The siRNAs were transfected transiently into NIH-3T3 or SKBR3 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and the relative knockdown efficiency was determined using RT-PCR. Our laboratory has generated activated forms of the small GTPase, Cdc42, which are able to cycle rapidly between the GDP- and GTP-bound states, through their ability to undergo constitutive GDP-GTP exchange while retaining the capability of hydrolyzing GTP. One such Cdc42 mutant, Cdc42(F28L), was shown to cause cellular transformation in NIH-3T3 cells and to induce tumor formation in immunocompromised mice (16.Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. A novel Cdc42Hs mutant induces cellular transformation.Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 19.Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D.

More recently, we have reported that a Ran(F35A) mutant, when expressed in cells, is capable of triggering mitogenic signaling pathways leading to cellular transformation (13.Ly T.K. Wang J. Pereira R. Rojas K.S. Peng X. Feng Q. Cerione R.A. Wilson K.F. Activation of the Ran GTPase is subject to growth factor regulation and can give rise to cellular transformation.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 5815-5826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This mutant appears to be activated in cells, although it does not exhibit constitutive nucleotide exchange activity in vitro, and so the mechanism responsible for its ability to send transforming signals is not clear. Given that the ability of Ran to cycle between its GDP- and GTP-bound states is linked to proper nucleocytoplasmic transport in cells, we wanted to examine mutants of Ran capable of accelerated GDP-GTP exchange, within the context of cell growth control and cellular transformation. Activated mutants of Ran were designed by taking advantage of the existing x-ray crystal structures for this and other small GTPases (23.Pai E.F. Krengel U. Petsko G.A. Goody R.S. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A.

The nucleotide-binding pocket from the x-ray structure of GDP-bound Ran was the primary template used in creating the Ran mutants (24.Scheffzek K. Klebe C. Fritz-Wolf K. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A. Crystal structure of the nuclear Ras-related protein Ran in its GDP-bound form.Nature. 1995; 374: 378-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 26.Partridge J.R. Schwartz T.U.

The structure of the Q69L mutant of GDP-Ran shows a major conformational change in the switch II loop that accounts for its failure to bind nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2).J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1517-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Both structural and biochemical data have implicated three residues at the Ran nucleotide binding site as strong candidates for mutation (Fig. 1A). The first, Asp-125, is part of the conserved NKXD motif that is found in virtually all G-proteins and is involved in binding to the guanine ring of GDP or GTP (28.Tu S.S. Wu W.J. Yang W. Nolbant P. Hahn K. Cerione R.A. Antiapoptotic Cdc42 mutants are potent activators of cellular transformation.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12350-12358Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 29.Cool R.H. Schmidt G. Lenzen C.U. Prinz H. Vogt D. Wittinghofer A. The Ras mutant D119N is both dominant negative and activated.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6297-6305Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has shown that mutating the corresponding aspartic acid in Cdc42 to an asparagine residue yielded a mutant, Cdc42(D118N), capable of constitutive GDP-GTP exchange (28.Tu S.S. Wu W.J. Yang W. Nolbant P. Hahn K. Cerione R.A. Antiapoptotic Cdc42 mutants are potent activators of cellular transformation.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12350-12358Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Given that Asp-125 makes a critical contact with GDP based on the x-ray crystal structure of wild-type Ran, it seemed reasonable to expect that mutation of Asp-125 could give rise to accelerated nucleotide exchange. The second residue, Lys-152, is in position to interact with the ribose moiety of GDP or GTP. Thus, we suspected that mutating this residue would eliminate these interactions and thereby enhance intrinsic GDP-GTP exchange. Moreover, the position Lys-152 occupies in the Ran GDP structure is similar to the position of Phe-28 in Cdc42, and as noted above, the Cdc42(F28L) mutant produces a constitutively active GTPase (16.Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. A novel Cdc42Hs mutant induces cellular transformation.Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The third residue, Asp-65, indirectly interacts with Mg2+ through water molecules in the nucleotide-binding site of Ran. Asp-125, Lys-152, and Asp-65, were mutated to glutamic acid, alanine/glutamine, and isoleucine, respectively. These mutated forms of Ran were expressed in bacteria and purified in sufficient amounts for biochemical characterization (Fig. 1B). Fig. 1C compares the rates of dissociation of the fluorescent GDP analog Mant-GDP from wild-type Ran and the different Ran mutants, as an outcome of Mant-GDP/GTP exchange. When compared with wild-type Ran and the Ran(F35A) mutant, the D125E, K152Q, and K152A mutants each showed enhanced rates of GDP dissociation (Fig. 1, C and D). These mutants, unlike wild-type Ran, were also constitutively activated when transiently expressed in NIH-3T3 cells, as indicated in assays using histidine-tagged β-importin to pull down GTP-bound Ran from cellular lysates (13.Ly T.K. Wang J. Pereira R. Rojas K.S. Peng X. Feng Q. Cerione R.A. Wilson K.F. Activation of the Ran GTPase is subject to growth factor regulation and can give rise to cellular transformation.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 5815-5826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). An example comparing the activities of the rapidly exchanging Ran(K152Q) mutant versus the constitutively active, GTP hydrolysis-defective Ran(Q69L) mutant, and wild-type Ran in cells, is shown in supplemental Fig. S1. Ran(D65I) had very weak affinity for GDP or GTP and showed no detectable GTP hydrolysis under standard assay conditions (data not shown). The D125E, K152A, and K152Q mutants were each capable of binding GTP like wild-type Ran, and all hydrolyzed GTP when assayed in the presence of the Ran GAP FUG1 (supplemental Fig. S2). Ran(F35A) was unable to hydrolyze GTP under these assay conditions but instead was entirely dependent upon RanBP1 working together with Ran GAP for detectable GTP hydrolytic activity (13.Ly T.K. Wang J. Pereira R. Rojas K.S. Peng X. Feng Q. Cerione R.A. Wilson K.F. Activation of the Ran GTPase is subject to growth factor regulation and can give rise to cellular transformation.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 5815-5826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This made the F35A mutant unique among the Ran GTPases examined and may help to explain its enhanced activity in cells (13.Ly T.K. Wang J. Pereira R. Rojas K.S. Peng X. Feng Q. Cerione"

The main purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between accuracy and stability of tracking performance and the amount of corrective movements that emerge for various coordination patterns in a unimanual visuomotor tracking task. Participants (N = 6) produced rhythmic elbow flexion–extension motions and were required to track an external sinusoidal signal at five different relative phases, 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, and 180°. Differential accuracy and stability were found among the five tracking patterns with the 0° relative phase pattern being the most accurate and stable pattern. Corrective movements were correlated with changes in accuracy only for the 0° relative phase pattern, with more corrections emerging for less accurate performance. The amount of corrective movements decreased as the stability of tracking performance increased for the 0°, 45°, and 135° patterns. For the 90° and 180° tracking patterns, the amount of corrective movements was not correlated with pattern accuracy or pattern stability. The results demonstrate that corrective behaviors are an important motor process in maintaining the stability of stable perception-action coordination patterns, while offering little benefit for unstable perception-action patterns."

The reaction requires the enzyme to precisely control DNA cleavage and gate opening coupled with ATP hydrolysis. Using pulsed alkylation mass spectrometry, we were able to monitor the solvent accessibilities around 13 cysteines distributed throughout human topoisomerase IIα by measuring the thiol reactivities with monobromobimane. Most of the measured reactivities are in accordance with the predicted ones based on a homology structural model generated from available crystal structures. However, these results reveal new information for both the residues not covered in the structural model and potential differences between the modeled and solution holoenzyme structures. Furthermore, on the basis of the reactivity changes of several cysteines located at the N-gate and DNA gate, we could monitor the movement of topoisomerase II in the presence of cofactors and detect differences in the DNA gate between two closed clamp enzyme conformations locked by either 5'-adenylyl β,γ-imidodiphosphate or the anticancer drug ICRF-193."
