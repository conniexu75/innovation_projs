https://openalex.org/W2105259330,"Nuclear receptors are multi-domain transcription factors that bind to DNA elements from which they regulate gene expression. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) form heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), and PPAR-gamma has been intensively studied as a drug target because of its link to insulin sensitization. Previous structural studies have focused on isolated DNA or ligand-binding segments, with no demonstration of how multiple domains cooperate to modulate receptor properties. Here we present structures of intact PPAR-gamma and RXR-alpha as a heterodimer bound to DNA, ligands and coactivator peptides. PPAR-gamma and RXR-alpha form a non-symmetric complex, allowing the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of PPAR-gamma to contact multiple domains in both proteins. Three interfaces link PPAR-gamma and RXR-alpha, including some that are DNA dependent. The PPAR-gamma LBD cooperates with both DNA-binding domains (DBDs) to enhance response-element binding. The A/B segments are highly dynamic, lacking folded substructures despite their gene-activation properties."

Lactate is also a key source of energy and an important metabolic substrate, and it has also been hypothesized to be a signaling molecule directing metabolic activity. Here we show that GPR81, an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor highly expressed in fat, is in fact a sensor for lactate. Lactate activates GPR81 in its physiological concentration range of 1–20 mm and suppresses lipolysis in mouse, rat, and human adipocytes as well as in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. Adipocytes from GPR81-deficient mice lack an antilipolytic response to lactate but are responsive to other antilipolytic agents. Lactate specifically induces internalization of GPR81 after receptor activation. Site-directed mutagenesis of GPR81 coupled with homology modeling demonstrates that classically conserved key residues in the transmembrane binding domains are responsible for interacting with lactate. Our results indicate that lactate suppresses lipolysis in adipose tissue through a direct activation of GPR81. GPR81 may thus be an attractive target for the treatment of dyslipidemia and other metabolic disorders.

George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. Gene (Amst.).. 2001; 275: 83-91Google Scholar) is an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor that is highly homologous to GPR109a and GPR109b. GPR109a and GPR109b were recently identified as receptors for niacin (also known as nicotinic acid) (2Tunaru S. Kero J. Schaub A. Wufka C. Blaukat A. Pfeffer K. Offermanns S. Nat.

Niacin has been used clinically for a half-century as an effective treatment for dyslipidemia (5Garg A. Grundy S.M. J. Am. Med. Assoc... 1990; 264: 723-726Google Scholar); however, its utility is somewhat hampered by a target-related effect on dendritic Langerhans cells, which release prostaglandin D2 in response to GPR109a stimulation, resulting in a cutaneous flushing response (6Benyó Z.

Sci. U. S. A... 2006; 103: 6682-6687Google Scholar). GPR81 is highly expressed in fat, similar to GPR109a, but is not expressed significantly in spleen; nor is it highly detected in any other tissue, and it has thus been hypothesized to be a potential target for the treatment of dyslipidemia that would be analogous to GPR109a/niacin but without the potential side effects (9Ge H. Weiszmann J. Reagan J.D. Gupte J. Baribault H. Gyuris T. Chen J.L. Tian H. Li Y. J. Lipid Res... 2008; 49: 797-803Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate the initial identification of the ligand activity for GPR81 from the rat tissue extracts, the purification of l-lactate from porcine brain as the source of the ligand activity, and the pharmacological characterization of l-lactate as a ligand for GPR81. In addition, we show that in its physiological concentration range, l-lactate effectively inhibits lipolysis in adipocytes from humans, mice, and rats. Adipocytes from GPR81-deficient mice lack responses to l-lactate, indicating that the antilipolytic effect of l-lactate is mediated by GPR81. Despite a long history of being considered as waste or a by-product of metabolism, l-lactate has maintained some attention as a potential signaling molecule (10Sola-Penna M. IUBMB Life.. 2008; 49: 797-803Google Scholar). As early as the 1960s, researchers have demonstrated significant effects of lactate on adipocytes (11Björntorp P. Acta Med. Scand... 1965; 178: 253-255Google Scholar); however, the mechanism by which this occurs has remained unknown. Our finding in this report provides a molecular basis for the ability of lactate to modulate lipolysis in adipocytes and establishes a new target opportunity for the treatment of dyslipidemia. Chemicals—All chemicals tested as ligands for GPR81 were purchased from Sigma. Identification of GPR81 Ligand Activity from Rat Tissues—Different rat tissues (5 g/tissue) were homogenized in cold (–30 °C) 80% ethanol at a tissue/solvent ratio of 1:8. The extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants were collected, and volumes were reduced using a rotary evaporator at 30 °C. The remaining solution was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then passed through a C-18 Sep-pack column (Bond Elut; Varian), and the flow-through was collected and dried in a lyophilizer. The dried sample was reextracted with pure ethanol, and the supernatant was dried in a rotary evaporator, reconstituted in water, and tested for activation of GTPγS 4The abbreviations used are: GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; PTX, pertussis toxin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FFA, free fatty acid; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; DCA, dichloroacetate; RT, reverse transcription; GHB, γ-hydroxybutyric acid; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. incorporation, as described previously (12Liu C.

Chem... 2003; 278: 50754-50764Google Scholar), in cell membranes expressing the recombinant human GPR81. Purification of GPR81 Ligand from Porcine Brain—To purify the GPR81 ligand from porcine brain, 200 g of frozen porcine brain (Pel-Freez Biologicals) were homogenized under similar conditions as the rat tissues. The extract was centrifuged, the supernatant was collected, and the volume was reduced on a Rotovap at 30 °C to about 200 ml. The sample was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was loaded onto a C-18 Sep-pack column from Varian. The flow-through was dried in a lyophilizer and dissolved in 2 ml of distilled water. The sample was adjusted to pH 3 with concentrated HCl before loading to a Restek AllureOA column (300 × 10 mm, 5 μm, 60 Å). Preparative HPLC was run on a Waters Alliance 2790 system (flow rate 4 ml/min; mobile phases: 1 mm HCl in water (A) and acetonitrile (B); gradient: 0–10 min, 100% A). Fractions were collected and neutralized with NaOH before being tested in a GTPγS binding assay to identify the active fraction. The active fraction was lyophilized and dissolved in 0.5 ml of D2O. The pH of the sample was adjusted to 8 with NaOH, and NMR data were acquired on a Bruker DRX600 spectrometer at 40 °C (1H, 13C APT, COSY, HSQC). NMR data were also obtained for a sample containing 15 mg of pure (l-)sodium lactate (purchased from Sigma) under the same conditions. Molecular Cloning and Recombinant Expression of GPR81 from Different Species—GPR81 genes from humans, mice, rats, dogs, pigs, cows, and monkeys were PCR-amplified using primers listed in supplemental Table 1 and respective genomic DNAs as the templates. The PCR products were then cloned in a mammalian expression vector pCIneo (Promega), and the insert regions were sequenced to confirm the sequence identities. The expression vectors were either transiently expressed in CHO-K1 cells or stably expressed in SK-N-MC/CRE-β-gal cells as described (13Liu C. Chen J. Kuei C. Sutton S. Nepomuceno D. Bonaventure P. Lovenberg T.W. Mol. Pharmacol... 2005; 67: 231-240Google Scholar). Measuring l-Lactate from Cell Culture Media and Tissue Extracts—3T3-L1 cells were differentiated in 24-well tissue culture plates for 15 days. The adipocytes were washed using lipolysis washing buffer (Zen-Bio, Inc.) and replaced with 500 μl of lipolysis assay buffer (Zen-Bio) plus additional glucose (25 mm) with or without 5 μm recombinant human insulin (Sigma). 3T3-L1 adipocytes were then incubated in a 37 °C cell culture incubator for 3 h, and lactate production was determined using a lactate assay kit (Eton Bioscience, San Diego, CA). To measure lactate contents in tissues, different rat tissues were extracted with cold 80% ethanol (tissue/solvent ratio 1:8) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatants were collected and diluted with water at different dilutions. The lactate contents were then assayed using the lactate assay kit (Eton Bioscience). Pharmacological Characterization of l-Lactate as the Ligand for GPR81—To characterize agonists for GPR81, CHO cells transiently expressing GPR81 from different species were tested using different compounds as agonists in a GTPγS binding assay. For cAMP accumulation studies, SK-N-MC/CRE-β-gal cells stably expressing human GPR81 were treated with various concentrations of l-lactate and then stimulated with forskolin. cAMP accumulation was measured as previously described (12Liu C. Eriste E. Sutton S. Chen J. Roland B. Kuei C. Farmer N. Jörnvall H. Sillard R. Lovenberg T.W. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 278: 50754-50764Google Scholar). For pertussis toxin (PTX) treatment, cells transfected with GPR81 were treated with PTX (100 ng/ml) overnight before assaying the receptor activity. Receptor Internalization Studies—A V5 N-terminally tagged human GPR81 expression construct was constructed by adding a V5 tag (MGKPIPNPLLGLDST) coding region at the 5′ end of the human GPR81 coding region. The DNA construct was sequenced to confirm the sequence identity. The DNA construct was transfected into CHO cells. One day after transfection, the cells were cultured in low glucose medium (50% minimum essential medium Eagle plus 50% PBS and 1% bovine serum albumin) for 3 h and then incubated with anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) at a concentration of 2 μg/ml diluted in the low glucose medium (described above) for 20 min in a tissue culture incubator. To detect cell surface staining of V5-GPR81 on live cells, cells were washed 3 times and then incubated with Cy3-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG. To study lactate-induced GPR81 internalization, following the incubation with anti-V5 antibody, l-lactate (final concentration 25 mm) was added to stimulate the receptor internalization for 30 min. The cells were then either digested by trypsin (0.05% diluted in low glucose medium without BSA) or not for 5 min to remove the cell surface anti-V5 antibody and washed three times with PBS. Finally, the cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with Triton X-100, and internalized anti-V5 antibody was visualized by staining with a Cy3-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody and viewed under a fluorescent microscope. Western Blot Analysis of Erk Phosphorylation—SK-N-MC/CRE-β-gal cells stably expressing human GPR81 were treated with or without PTX (100 ng/ml) overnight. The cells were then treated either with or with out l-lactate (10 mm) for 5 min, and cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-phosphorylated Erk antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) to detect phosphorylated Erk levels. The membrane was then stripped and reblotted with anti-Erk antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for total Erk levels. SK-N-MC/CRE-β-gal cells without GPR81 were used as control. Mutagenesis Studies—Human GPR81 with a FLAG tag at the C terminus was used as the template for mutagenesis by a standard protocol. The mutant receptors were then recombinantly expressed and assayed for their responses to l-lactate in a GTPγS binding assay. All of the mutant GPR81 protein expression was verified by anti-FLAG staining. Generation of GPR81 Knock-out Mouse—GPR81-deficient mice were generated by Deltagen (San Mateo, CA). The transmembrane domain 2 of mouse GPR81 coding region (100 bp) is replaced by a 7-kb IRES-lacZ-neo cassette. Adipocyte Lipolysis Studies—3T3-L1 preadipocytes were grown in 24-well tissue culture plates and differentiated as described previously (14Lee G. Elwood F. McNally J. Weiszmann J. Lindstrom M. Amaral K. Nakamura M. Miao S. Cao P. Learned R.M. Chen J.L. Li Y. J. Biol. Chem... 2002; 277: 19649-19657Google Scholar) for 15 days. Human subcutaneous adipocytes grown and differentiated in vitro in 24-well tissue culture plates were purchased from Zen-Bio. Differentiated 3T3-L1 and human primary adipocytes were washed with lipolysis washing buffer (Zen-Bio) and incubated in lipolysis assay buffer (500 μl/well; Zen-Bio) at 37 °C in a tissue culture incubator. Three hours (3T3-L1 adipocytes) or 5 h (human primary adipocytes) after incubation, glycerol and free fatty acid (FFA) content in the assay buffer were determined using a free glycerol reagent (Sigma) or a fatty acid kit (Zen-Bio). To study lipolysis in the primary mature adipocytes, subcutaneous or epididymal fat tissues were dissected from Sprague-Dawley rats or mice with 129SvJ/C57Bl/6J background. The mature adipocytes were isolated, and lipolysis studies were performed as described previously (9Ge H. Weiszmann J. Reagan J.D. Gupte J. Baribault H. Gyuris T. Chen J.L. Tian H. Li Y. J. Lipid Res... 2008; 49: 797-803Google Scholar). Samples were taken hourly, and glycerol production and fatty acid release were determined using a free glycerol reagent (Sigma) or a fatty acid measuring kit (Zen-Bio). For human and rat adipocytes, isoproterenol was added to a final concentration of 0.5 μm to all samples to stimulate lipolysis. For 3T3-L1 adipocytes and mature adipocytes isolated from mice, lipolysis studies were performed without isoproterenol. Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis of mRNA Expression—PCR primers for the indicated genes (supplemental Table 2) were used to analyze specified mRNA expression using a method described previously (15Liu C. Kuei C. Sutton S. Chen J. Bonaventure P. Wu J. Nepomuceno D. Kamme F. Tran D. Zhu J. Wilkinson T. Bathgate R. Eriste E. Sillard R. Lovenberg T.W. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 292-300Google Scholar). cDNAs for human, rat, and mouse tissues that were used for GPR81 mRNA quantification were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). cDNAs from differentiated or undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells were made in house by a standard protocol. Detection of GPR81 Protein Expression in Mouse Tissues or Cells—A chicken antibody against mouse GPR81 (antibody MA) made against a C-terminal region of the mouse GPR81 (amino acid sequence DGANRSQRPSDGQW) was coated on an ELISA plate at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. The plate was blocked with blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline solution plus 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and 3% nonfat dry milk). Crude plasma membrane was prepared from different tissues from either wild type or GPR81-deficient mice or 3T3-L1 cells and solubilized with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl plus 1% Triton X-100). The lysates were centrifuged at 2000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, and the clear supernatants were aliquoted into an MA antibody-coated ELISA plate in triplicates. The plate was then incubated at 4 °C overnight with shaking on a platform. The plate was washed with PBST three times and then incubated with a rabbit anti-mouse GPR81 antibody (antibody MB) against a different region of the C terminus of mouse GPR81 (amino acid sequence SLKPKRPGRTKTRRSEEMPISNLC), which was diluted into the blocking buffer at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 h and washed with PBST followed by the incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG) diluted (at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml) in blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature. The plate was again washed with PBST and developed as described in standard ELISA protocols. Series dilutions of cell lysates from COS-7 cells expressing recombinant mouse GPR81 were included in the assay as the standards for the quantification of the relative expression levels of GPR81 from different tissues or cells. The final relative expression levels of GPR81 from different tissues were normalized by the tissue weights or the cells pellet weights for 3T3-L1 cells. Molecular Modeling—The primary sequence alignment between bovine rhodopsin 1HZX (Protein Data Bank code) and GPR81 was determined using the program ClustalW (16Higgins D. Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res... 1994; 22: 4673-4680Google Scholar). The helical alignment was further examined and refined based on the multiple sequence alignment of family A GPCRs, as described elsewhere (17Mirzadegan T. Benko G. Filipek S. Palczewski K. Biochemistry.. 2003; 42: 2759-2767Google Scholar). The rhodopsin structure (1HZX) was used as a template, and based on the sequence alignment, the appropriate residues of the helices of the rhodopsin were changed to the corresponding amino acid of the GPR81 using the Insight I Homology tools (distributed by Accelrys Software Inc.). The amino acid side chains were energy-minimized and placed in a reasonable conformation. For this study, the loops were discarded, and only the transmembrane bundle was used to describe the putative small molecule-binding site. The final structure was minimized with a limited cycle using the Accelrys Discover software and CVFF force field. All of the nonbonded heavy atom clashes were removed by energy minimization of the final structure. A manual docking of the ligand was followed by further energy minimization of the complex. Identification and Purification of l-Lactate as a Ligand for GPR81—As an effort to identify the endogenous ligand(s) for orphan GPCR GPR81, we tested extracts from different rat tissues for ligand activity in GPR81-transfected cells. Surprisingly, the results showed that all tissue extracts produced apparent activity to stimulate [35S]GTPγS binding in GPR81-expressing cell membranes (Fig. 1A) but not in control cells (not shown), with the highest activities observed in tissue extracts of heart, pancreas, and brain. To purify the ligand for GPR81, porcine brain was extracted to provide substantially more material than was accessible via rat brain tissue. The majority of the porcine brain extract was lyophilized, redissolved in 1 mm HCl, and fractionated with a Restek AllureOA column. Iterative chromatography cycles resulted in a final separation and a single peak containing the active component (Fig. 1B). NMR structural analysis of the fraction with active component showed that both its 1H and 13C APT spectra are identical to that of l-lactate (Fig. 1C). The peak assignment is further supported by COSY and HSQC experiments (data not shown). The purity of the fraction was over 98% by both 1H and 13C NMR. Direct measurement of l-lactate contents in the tissue extracts shows that lactate content in the tissue extracts (supplemental Fig. 1) is consistent with the GPR81 ligand activities. Pharmacological Characterization of l-Lactate as a Ligand for GPR81—To confirm that l-lactate is indeed an agonist ligand for GPR81, commercial l-lactate at various concentrations was tested for activation of GPR81 using both GTPγS binding and direct inhibition of cAMP accumulation. The results show that l-lactate stimulates GTPγS binding with an EC50 value of about 5 mm (Fig. 2A and Table 1) in cells transfected with human GPR81 (but not in control cells or cells expressing the niacin receptors (GPR109a or GPR109b)) (Fig. 2A). In SK-N-MC/CRE-β-gal cells (a cell line harboring a β-galactosidase gene under the control of the cAMP-responsive element) stably expressing GPR81, l-lactate inhibits forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation (EC50 = 4.16 ± 0.53 mm), whereas it has no effect in control SK-N-MC/CRE-β-gal cells (Fig. 2B). Both the GTPγS binding and inhibition of cAMP accumulation suggest that GPR81 is coupled to Gi/o proteins. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that pertussis toxin inhibits l-lactate stimulated GTPγS binding (Fig. 2C) and Erk phosphorylation (Fig. 2D). Cells expressing GPR81 also showed higher basal Erk phosphorylation compared with control cells, and pertussis toxin treatment reduced the basal Erk phosphorylation (Fig. 2D). This may reflect either a constitutive level of activation of the receptor or an endogenous lactate tone within the cell/tissue, since essentially all cells produce l-lactate dependent upon metabolic conditions.TABLE 1GPR81 from different mammalian species and their EC50 values for l-lactateGPR81 from different speciesGenBank™ accession numberPercentage of homology/identity to human GPR81EC50 value for l-lactate%mmHumanEU809458100/1004.87 ± 0.64Mouse long formEU80945987/816.73 ± 0.73Mouse short formEU80946087/816.94 ± 0.84Rat long formEU80946188/816.26 ± 0.92Rat short formEU80946288/816.58 ± 0.81DogEU80946390/843.71 ± 0.47PigEU80946490/835.62 ± 0.68CowEU80946588/804.95 ± 0.42MonkeyEU80946697/954.05 ± 0.58 Open table in a new tab To investigate whether l-lactate stimulates the internalization of GPR81, we engineered a GPR81-expressing construct with a V5 tag fused to the N terminus of GPR81. V5-tagged-GPR81 responded appropriately to l-lactate stimulation as measured by GTPγS stimulation, and the dose-response curve was indistinguishable from the wild type receptor (supplemental Fig. 2). To detect the cell surface expression of V5-tagged GPR81, live cells were stained with anti-V5 antibody by diluting the antibodies into the cell culture medium. The results show that although no signal was detected in the control cells (Fig. 3A), clear cell surface staining of V5-GPR81 expression was detected from V5-GPR81-transfected cells (Fig. 3B). To measure receptor internalization, cells expressing V5-tagged GPR81 were first incubated with anti-V5 antibody, followed by l-lactate stimulation. The cells were then fixed and permeabilized, and the localizations of anti-V5 antibody-labeled receptors were detected with Cy3-labeled secondary antibody. The results show that l-lactate stimulates GPR81 redistribution in the cells. Compared with untreated cells (Fig. 3C), in l-lactate-treated cells, V5-GPR81 staining appeared at high intensity in intracellular organelles (Fig. 3D), indicating that l-lactate stimulates GPR81 internalization. Confirming this conclusion, in a parallel experiment, we treated the cells with trypsin following anti-V5 antibody incubation to remove the uninternalized antibody. The internalized anti-V5 antibody was then stained using a Cy3-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody in the presence of permeabilization reagent. Our results show that although trypsin digestion reduces V5-GPR81 staining in cells without l-lactate treatment (Fig. 3E), the high intensity staining in l-lactate-treated cells appears in intracellular organelles and is resistant to trypsin digestion (Fig. 3F), indicating that they are internalized V5-GPR81. To investigate whether l-lactate can also activate GPR81 from different mammalian species, the mouse and rat GPR81 were cloned. Compared with the human GPR81, both mouse and rat GPR81 coding regions are longer at the 5′-end, encoding an additional 8 amino acids at the N terminus. However, the ATG site corresponding to the human GPR81 translation initiation is still conserved in the mouse and rat GPR81 cDNAs. Two clones for both mouse and rat GPR81 were cloned, respectively, with one clone starting with the first ATG site (designated GPR81L) and another clone using the second ATG site (corresponding to the ATG site in the human GPR81 translation initiation site, designated GPR81s). There was no observed difference between the pharmacology for the GPR81L and GPR81s clones (data not shown). Therefore, the GPR81L clones were used for all subsequent studies. We further cloned GPR81 from monkeys, dogs, pigs, and cows. Overall, GPR81 genes from different mammalian species are highly conserved (>80% sequence identity). The GenBank™ accession numbers for GPR81 genes from different species are listed in Table 1. Pharmacological characterization of recombinant GPR81 from different species demonstrated that they all respond to l-lactate through stimulation of GTPγS incorporation in membranes (Table 1), indicating conservation of the phenomenon in different species. We next tested a series of related acids as ligands for GPR81 (Table 2). Our results show that α-hydroxybutyrate, glycolate, α-hydroxyisobutyrate, and γ-hydroxybutyrate are also low affinity agonists for GPR81. In contrast, d-lactate, α-hydroxycaproic acid, malate, tartrate, and propionate are weak partial agonists for GPR81, whereas niacin, pyruvate, β-hydroxybutyrate, acetate, γ-aminobutyric acid, and butyrate are not active (Table 2). l-Lactate was unable to activate either GPR109a or GPR109b (Fig. 2A). In addition, we found that dichloroacetate (DCA) and trifluoroacetate were capable of activating GPR81 (Table 2), albeit as partial agonists.TABLE 2EC50 values and Emax of compounds tested as ligands for human GPR81CompoundsEC50 for GPR81Emaxmm% of l-lactatel-Lactate4.87 ± 0.64100GHB15.3 ± 2.14110dl-α-Hydroxybutyrate8.51 ± 1.5192Glycolate9.64 ± 1.3585Trifluoroacetate5.41 ± 0.6862α-Hydroxyisobutyrate7.83 ± 1.4357DCA3.54 ± 0.5735dl-α-Hydroxycaproic acid> 2045aAgonistic activities have been observed for those compounds, but the EC50 values for those compounds are not calculated, because the dose-response curves for those compounds did not reach plateaus.

https://openalex.org/W2128873134,"Arginine-rich peptides are a subclass of cell-penetrating peptides that are taken up by living cells and can be detected freely diffusing inside the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. This phenomenon has been attributed to either an endocytic mode of uptake and a subsequent release from vesicles or to direct membrane penetration (transduction). To distinguish between both possibilities, we have blocked endocytic pathways suggested to be involved in uptake of cell-penetrating peptides. We have then monitored by confocal microscopy the uptake and distribution of the cell-penetrating transactivator of transcription (TAT) peptide into living mammalian cells over time. To prevent side effects of chemical inhibitors, we used genetically engineered cells as well as different temperature. We found that a knockdown of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and a knock-out of caveolin-mediated endocytosis did not affect the ability of TAT to enter cells. In addition, the TAT peptide showed the same intracellular distribution throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus as in control cells. Even incubation of cells at 4 degrees C did not abrogate TAT uptake nor change its intracellular distribution. We therefore conclude that this distribution results from TAT peptide that directly penetrated (transduced) the plasma membrane. The formation of nonselective pores is unlikely, because simultaneously added fluorophores were not taken up together with the TAT peptide. In summary, although the frequency and kinetics of TAT transduction varied between cell types, it was independent of endocytosis."

Here we explored the underlying molecular mechanism by which Sox9 antagonizes the Wnt/β-catenin signaling in chondrocyte differentiation. We found that Sox9 employed two distinct mechanisms to inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling: the Sox9 N terminus is necessary and sufficient to promote β-catenin degradation, whereas the C terminus is required to inhibit β-catenin transcriptional activity without affecting its stability. Sox9 binds to β-catenin and components of the β-catenin “destruction complex,” glycogen synthase kinase 3 and β-transducin repeat containing protein, to promote their nuclear localization. Independent of its DNA binding ability, nuclear localization of Sox9 is both necessary and sufficient to enhance β-catenin phosphorylation and its subsequent degradation. Thus, one mechanism whereby Sox9 regulates chondrogenesis is to promote efficient β-catenin phosphorylation in the nucleus. This mechanism may be broadly employed by other intrinsic cell fate determining transcription factors to promptly turn off extrinsic inhibitory Wnt signaling mediated by β-catenin.

Differentiation of chondrocytes from mesenchymal progenitors is an early critical event in endochondral ossification, a major bone-forming process in vertebrate embryos (1Karsenty G. Nature.. 2003; 423: 316-318Google Scholar). Chondrocyte fate determination and maintenance are regulated by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as Sox9 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling, respectively. Sox9 is an SRY-box (Sox) containing gene required for chondrocyte differentiation (3Akiyama H. Chaboissier M.C. Martin J.F. Schedl A. de Crombrugghe B.

The Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which plays a critical role in regulating many cell proliferation and fate determination processes in embryonic development and oncogenesis (reviewed in Refs. 7Clevers H. Cell.. 2006; 127: 469-480Google Scholar and 8Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol... 2004; 20: 781-810Google Scholar), potently inhibits chondrocyte differentiation and Sox9 expression during skeletal development (9Guo X. Day T.F. Jiang X. Garrett-Beal L. Topol L. Yang Y. Genes Dev... 2004; 18: 2404-2417Google Scholar, 10Hartmann C. Tabin C.J. Cell.. 2001; 104: 341-351Google Scholar). Because Wnt ligand expression is detected around the chondrogenic mesenchymal condensation, but Wnt signaling activity is dramatically down-regulated in the differentiating chondrocytes in which Sox9 is expressed (11Day T.F. Guo X. Garrett-Beal L. Yang Y. Dev. Cell.. 2005; 8: 739-750Google Scholar), it is likely that one mechanism by which Sox9 promotes chondrocyte differentiation and maintains chondrocyte characters is to inhibit the antichondrogenic Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity. However, the molecular mechanism by which Sox9 promotes β-catenin degradation is still poorly understood. In the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, β-catenin protein degradation is regulated by Wnt signaling, which controls β-catenin phosphorylation by casein kinase Iα (CKIα) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) in the destruction complex assembled by Axin (7Clevers H. Cell.. 2006; 127: 469-480Google Scholar). In the absence of Wnt signals, β-catenin is phosphorylated in the destruction complex and then degraded in proteosomes. Activation of Wnt signaling leads to inhibition of GSK3-mediated β-catenin phosphorylation and thus β-catenin is stabilized. According to the current model, β-catenin degradation occurs in the cytoplasm. β-Catenin, stabilized by Wnt signaling, then enters the nucleus where it activates downstream gene expression by binding to LEF/TCF transcription factors. Sox9 is a transcription factor that contains three highly conserved domains: the high mobility group (HMG) domain that binds and bends DNA in a sequence specific manner (12Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N.

Sox9 protein is localized either exclusively in the nucleus (i.e. differentiated chondrocytes) or in both nucleus and cytoplasm (i.e. early differentiating chondrocytes). In addition to cartilage, Sox9 is expressed in other tissues such as neural crests (19Mori-Akiyama Y. Akiyama H. Rowitch D.H. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has been reported that in the developing cartilage and intestinal epithelium, Sox9 inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin signaling activities (24Akiyama H. Lyons J.P. Mori-Akiyama Y. Yang X. Zhang R.

Sox9 is also expressed in the gonad where it is required for male sex determination (26Morais da Silva S. Hacker A. Harley V. Goodfellow P. Swain A. Lovell-Badge R. Nat. Genet... 1996; 14: 62-68Google Scholar). Like what has been observed in Sox9 loss of function mutants, activation of β-catenin in otherwise normal XY mice effectively disrupts the male program and results in male-to-female sex reversal (27Maatouk D.M. Dinapoli L. Alvers A. Parker K.L. Taketo M.M. Capel B. Hum. Mol. Genet... 2008; 17: 2949-2955Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that Sox9 inhibits Wnt signaling by two distinct mechanisms, which requires different domains of Sox9. We showed that the N terminus of Sox9 including the HMG domain promoted β-catenin degradation, whereas the C-terminal transactivation domain inhibited the transcriptional activity of β-catenin, but it was not required for β-catenin degradation. In addition, we found that Sox9 bound to components of the β-catenin destruction complex and relocated them into the nucleus. Sox9 nuclear localization, not the HMG domain per se, was both necessary and sufficient to induce nuclear localization of the β-catenin destruction complex components and enhance β-catenin phosphorylation for its subsequent degradation. Furthermore, our results suggest that more efficient β-catenin phosphorylation and degradation in the nucleus may be a general mechanism whereby transcription factors effectively antagonizing inhibitory Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cell fate determination and maintenance. Plasmids, Viruses, and Antibodies—Mouse Sox9 cDNA (provided by Dr. Yoshi Yamada) was tagged with FLAG and subcloned into modified pIRES-hrGFP-1 (pIRES), expression vector (Stratagene) where GFP was removed. The Sox9 mutants were generated by standard PCR-based mutagenesis procedures (Stratagene) and subcloned into modified pIRES-hrGFP-1 vector in-frame with the FLAG tag. To generate NLS fusion, the NLS 5′-PKKKRKVE-3′ from the SV40 T antigen (28Jans D.A. Ackermann M.J. Bischoff J.R. Beach D.H. Peters R. J. Cell Biol... 1991; 115: 1203-1212Google Scholar) were added to the C-terminal end of the Sox9 mutant proteins. The coding region of rat ck1α and human β-CATENIN were HA-tagged and subcloned into pHM6 (2Kronenberg H.M. Nature.. 2003; 423: 332-3364Google Scholar). The wild type human β-CATENIN was Myc-tagged and inserted into the pcDNA-3A (Invitrogen) expression vector. ΔNβ-CATENIN, provided by Dr.F. McCormick (University of California, San Francisco, CA) was subcloned into the pIRES vector. The Sox9, Wnt14, GFP, and CRE-adenovirus were generated according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech) and concentrated viral stocks were produced by SAIC (SAIC, Frederick, MD). β-Catenin was fused in-frame to the GST sequences of the pGEX-4T1 bacterial vector (Amersham Bioscience). Recombinant GST-tagged β-catenin was expressed in BL21 Escherichiacoli cells and purified using glutathione-Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-Sox9 (H-90, Santa Cruz), anti-Axin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), anti-β-catenin (C19220, BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-tubulin (ICN), anti-GSK-3β (Cell signaling and Abcam), anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma), anti-phospho-specific-β-catenin (Thr41/Ser45 and Ser33/37) (Cell Signaling), anti-HA (cl3F10, Roche Applied Science), anti-Myc tag (9B11, Cell Signaling), anti-TCF4 (6H5-3, Upstate), anti-actin (Sigma), and anti-LRP5 (Santa Cruz) antibodies were used in Western blots, IP, or immunohistochemistry. Cell Culture, Transfection, Adenoviral Infection, and Luciferase Assay—CHO, HEK293, COS-1, NCI-H28, SW48, SW480, SNU475, and L-cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Primary mouse chondrocytes were prepared according to a previously published protocol (29Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1997; 17: 2336-2346Google Scholar). Cells were seeded the day before transfection and transfected with the indicated plasmids using Lipofectamine PLUS as specified by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). In some cases, transfection was performed using nucleofection technology (Amaxa GmbH). For luciferase assays, cells were transfected with Super-TOPFLASH or FOPFLASH plasmids, Renilla Luciferase plasmid (phRL-null, Promega), and the indicated plasmids. The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by adding empty vector DNA. Luciferase activity was measured according to the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). The results are shown as relative luciferase activity. The histograms are presented as the average ± S.D. from three independent transfections. All measurements were made using Lumat LB9507 Luminometer (EG&G Berthold). Adenoviral infection of cells was performed at 1 × 109 plaque-forming units/ml for 3-4 h, and the results were analyzed 24-72 h later. Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting Assay—In co-immunoprecipitation assays, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (Calbiochem), and Halt™ phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Pierce)). Equal amounts of cell lysates were incubated with the indicated antibodies for 2 h and Protein-G Plus (Santa Cruz) was added and incubated for overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times in lysis buffer, resolved by NuPAGE, and subjected to standard Western immunoblot analysis with the specific antibodies. Protein Binding Assay—In vitro pull-down assays were performed as described (30Sinner D. Rankin S. Lee M. Zorn A.M. Development.. 2004; 131: 3069-3080Google Scholar). Briefly, in β-catenin binding experiments, HEK293 or COS cells were transfected with the indicated constructs and 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors). Equal amounts of lysates were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C, with 20 μl (about 5 μg) of either purified GST or GST-β-catenin bound to agarose beads in lysis buffer adjusted to 20% glycerol and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Agarose beads were washed five times with lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and bound proteins were eluted in LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and detected by Western blot. Indirect Immunofluorescence—Cells were plated in four chambers slides (Lab-Tek), transfected with the indicated plasmids, and fixed with methanol or 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 and processed for indirect immunofluorescence. Treatment with Inhibitors—To block protein degradation, cells were treated with MG132 (Sigma) for 8 h before lysis. LiCl (Sigma) and 6-bromoindirubin-3′-oxime (BIO, Calbiochem) were used to inhibit GSK3β at 40 mm and 5 μm, respectively. Micromass Cultures—Micromass cultures were prepared according to a procedure described previously (9Guo X. Day T.F. Jiang X. Garrett-Beal L. Topol L. Yang Y. Genes Dev... 2004; 18: 2404-2417Google Scholar). Briefly, the Sox9- or Wnt14-adenoviruses were added to the limb mesenchymal cell suspension (∼2.5 × 106 cells/ml) at 5 × 109 plaque-forming units/ml, and the cell suspension was gently rocked at 4 °C for 2 h. Ascorbic acid was added to induce chondrocyte differentiation 48 h after plating the cells. Cells were fixed and stained with Alcian blue 48 h after ascorbic acid treatment. Immunoprecipitation and CKIα and GSK3β Immune Complex Kinase Assay—Transfected cells were fractionated as described (31Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res... 1991; 19: 2499Google Scholar). To assess Axin-associated activity of GSK3β or CKIα, protein complex containing Axin-Myc was immunoprecipitated using an anti-Myc antibody, and the kinase activity of the complex was assayed (32Primot A. Baratte B. Gompel M. Borgne A. Liabeuf S. Romette J.L. Jho E.H. Costantini F. Meijer L. Protein Expression Purif.. 2000; 20: 394-404Google Scholar, 33Reinhardt J. Ferandin Y. Meijer L. Protein Expression Purif.. 2007; 54: 101-109Google Scholar). CKIα kinase reaction was carried out for 10 min at 37 °C in a 40-μl volume of kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm NaF) containing the immunocomplex on agarose beads, supplemented with 100 μg/ml myelin basic protein (Sigma) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences). Supernatant was separated by NuPAGE and the gel was vacuum-dried and exposed to a film. The activity of GSK3β was measured as described (34Vyas D.R. Spangenburg E.E. Abraha T.W. Childs T.E. Booth F.W. Am. J. Physiol... 2002; 283: C545-C551Google Scholar) with some modification. Briefly, immunocomplex on agarose beads was incubated in 40 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), with phosphoglycogen synthase peptide-2 (62.5 mm) (Upstate Biothechnology) for 30 min at 30 °C. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from mouse primary chondrocytes using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with RNase-free DNase (Roche). cDNA was synthesized with oligo(dT) primers. Semi-quantitative analysis was performed using 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). The primers used in this experiment were: mouse Sox9 forward, 5′-CCA CGG AAC AGA CTC ACA TCT CTC-3′ and mouse Sox9 reverse, 5′-CTG CTC AGT TCA CCG ATG TCC ACG-3′; mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase forward, 5′-ACC ACA GTC CAT GCC ATC AC-3′ and mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reverse, 5′-TCC ACC ACC CTG TTG CTG TA-3′. Confocal Image Acquiring—Confocal images were acquired at room temperature using either a Zeiss LSM 510 NLO Meta system mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope or on a Zeiss LSM 510 UV system mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert 100M microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY) both using an oil immersion Plan-Apochromat ×63/1.4 DIC objective lens. Excitation wavelengths of 488, 561 (3Akiyama H. Chaboissier M.C. Martin J.F. Schedl A. de Crombrugghe B. Genes Dev... 2002; 16: 2813-2828Google Scholar), or 543 nm (UV), 633, and 740 nm (3Akiyama H. Chaboissier M.C. Martin J.F. Schedl A. de Crombrugghe B. Genes Dev... 2002; 16: 2813-2828Google Scholar), or 364 nm (UV) were used for detection of secondary antibodies conjugated by Alexa Fluor 488, Rhodamine, Alexa Fluor 633 (Invitrogen), and DAPI (Vector), respectively. Fluorescent emissions were collected in band-pass filters 500-550, 575-615, and 641-705 nm collected in the Meta detector and 390-465 nm, respectively (UV system filters were comparable). All pinholes were set at 1.00 Airy units, which corresponds to an optical slice of 0.8 μm (excluding the DAPI channel where a multiphoton laser was used). All confocal images were collected using the Zeiss AIM software version 4.0 sp2 (UV system version 3.2 sp2) of frame size 512 pixels by 512 pixels, scan zoom of 1 and line averaged 4 times. Sox9 Antagonizes Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling during Chondrocyte Differentiation by Promoting β-Catenin Degradation—We have shown previously that inactivation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling promotes chondrocyte differentiation from mesenchymal progenitors (9Guo X. Day T.F. Jiang X. Garrett-Beal L. Topol L. Yang Y. Genes Dev... 2004; 18: 2404-2417Google Scholar, 11Day T.F. Guo X. Garrett-Beal L. Yang Y. Dev. Cell.. 2005; 8: 739-750Google Scholar). Because Sox9 promotes chondrocyte differentiation when ectopically expressed (35Kawakami Y. Tsuda M. Takahashi S. Taniguchi N. Esteban C.R. Zemmyo M. Furumatsu T. Lotz M. Belmonte J.C. Asahara H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2005; 102: 2414-2419Google Scholar), we tested the hypothesis that one mechanism by which Sox9 promotes chondrogenesis is to antagonize Wnt/β-catenin signaling. We performed micromass cultures with the limb mesenchymal cells from 12.5 days post coitum mouse embryos. In the micromass cultures, chondrocytes differentiate from mesenchymal progenitors to form cartilage nodules, which are stained by Alcian blue. By infecting mesenchymal progenitors in the micromass cultures with Sox9- or Wnt14-adenovirus, we found that Sox9 expression increased cartilage nodule formation at the outer rim of micromass culture, whereas Wnt14, which signals through β-catenin (9Guo X. Day T.F. Jiang X. Garrett-Beal L. Topol L. Yang Y. Genes Dev... 2004; 18: 2404-2417Google Scholar), severely inhibited cartilage nodule formation (Ref. 9Guo X. Day T.F. Jiang X. Garrett-Beal L. Topol L. Yang Y. Genes Dev... 2004; 18: 2404-2417Google Scholar and Fig. 1A). Sox9- and Wnt14-adenovirus co-infection rescued cartilage nodule formation inhibited by Wnt14 to a large extent (Fig. 1A). The weak prochondrogenic effect of Sox9 alone is consistent with a previous report, which showed that Sox9 needs other cofactor(s) to effectively enhance its transcription activity (35Kawakami Y. Tsuda M. Takahashi S. Taniguchi N. Esteban C.R. Zemmyo M. Furumatsu T. Lotz M. Belmonte J.C. Asahara H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2005; 102: 2414-2419Google Scholar). When β-catenin protein levels in the micromass cultures were analyzed by Western blot, we found that enhanced cartilage nodule formation by Sox9 overexpression correlated with reduced β-catenin protein levels (Fig. 1B). In addition, Wnt3a treatment of L cells, which are fibroblast cells, resulted in elevated β-catenin protein levels, and such elevation was dampened by Sox9-adenovirus infection prior to Wnt3a treatment (Fig. 1C). In CHO cells Sox9 expression also led to reduced β-catenin accumulation promoted by Wnt3a treatment (Fig. 1D). These data indicate that Sox9 inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling, at least in part, by reducing β-catenin protein levels. These results also predict that β-catenin protein levels should be increased after Sox9 removal. To test this possibility primary chondrocytes from homozygous Sox9 conditional (Sox9c/c) (3Akiyama H. Chaboissier M.C. Martin J.F. Schedl A. de Crombrugghe B. Genes Dev... 2002; 16: 2813-2828Google Scholar) newborn mice were isolated and efficient Sox9 removal by Cre-adenovirus infection was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (Fig. 1E, panel a). β-Catenin protein levels were indeed increased in these Cre-induced Sox9-deficient primary chondrocytes (Fig. 1E, panel b). In addition, Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity measured by the TOPFLASH reporter (36Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science.. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Google Scholar) was also up-regulated in the Sox9-deficient primary chondrocytes (Fig. 1E, panel c). These data suggest that promoting β-catenin degradation is one of the mechanisms whereby Sox9 inhibits Wnt/β-catenin activity in primary mouse chondrocytes. Due to the difficulty of maintaining and efficiently transfecting the primary limb mesenchymal cells or primary chondrocytes, cell lines such as CHO, COS, and HEK293 that can be easily transfected, were chosen to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which Sox9 regulates the protein levels and activities of β-catenin. In all these cell lines, Sox9 reduced β-catenin protein levels like in the primary limb mesenchymal cells, primary chondrocytes, or L cells (Fig. 1F and data not shown). To dissect the molecular mechanism by which Sox9 promotes β-catenin degradation, a series of Sox9 deletion mutants were constructed (supplemental Fig. S1). Surprisingly, both the C-terminal deleted mutant (Sox9ΔC) and full-length Sox9 reduced β-catenin protein levels and inhibited its transcriptional activity in the TOPFLASH assay (Fig. 1, F and G). The Sox9ΔC induced even more pronounced β-catenin protein reduction than the full-length one. These results were different from previously published results showing that the C-terminal part of Sox9 was required for the degradation of a mutant β-catenin that could not be phosphorylated by GSK3 (24Akiyama H. Lyons J.P. Mori-Akiyama Y. Yang X. Zhang R. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Taketo M.M. Nakamura T. Behringer R.R. McCrea P.D. de Crombrugghe B. Genes Dev... 2004; 18: 1072-1087Google Scholar). Furthermore, treatment with MG132, a proteosome inhibitor, sustained β-catenin levels in the presence of Sox9 or Sox9ΔC (Fig. 1H), indicating that Sox9 acts through its N terminus, not its C terminus, to promote β-catenin degradation by proteosomes. However, our results supported that the Sox9 C terminus was required to inhibit β-catenin transcription activity as reported (24Akiyama H. Lyons J.P. Mori-Akiyama Y. Yang X. Zhang R. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Taketo M.M. Nakamura T. Behringer R.R. McCrea P.D. de Crombrugghe B. Genes Dev... 2004; 18: 1072-1087Google Scholar). Compared with Sox9, Sox9ΔC was more potent in inducing β-catenin protein degradation (Fig. 1F), but less active in inhibiting β-catenin-mediated transcription (Fig. 1G). Thus, Sox9 inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling through two parallel and independent mechanisms: it uses the N terminus to promote β-catenin protein degradation and the C terminus to inhibit transcription activity of β-catenin/TCF complex. Sox9 Promotes β-Catenin Degradation by Enhancing Its Phosphorylation—Because β-catenin phosphorylation by CKIα and GSK3 and its subsequent association with βTrCP leads to β-catenin degradation (38Fuchs S.Y.

Genes Dev... 1996; 10: 1443-1454Google Scholar), we tested whether β-catenin degradation promoted by Sox9 requires GSK3 and βTrCP. First, we found that Sox9 expression led to increased β-catenin phosphorylation by CKIα (at Ser45) and GSK3 (at Ser33/37) (Fig. 2A). The relative amount of β-catenin phosphorylated by GSK3 and CKIα versus the total β-catenin protein levels was significantly increased in Sox9 expressing cells compared with that in the control cells (Fig. 2A). In addition, when β-catenin protein degradation was blocked by MG132 treatment, more β-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3 was also observed in the accumulated β-catenin protein in Sox9 expressing cells (Fig. 2B). We then inhibited GSK3 activity by LiCl or BIO (47Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1996; 93: 8455-8459Google Scholar, 48Meijer L. Skaltsounis A.L. Magiatis P.

Sox9 and Sox9ΔC still exhibited residual activities to promote β-catenin degradation in the presence of LiCl or BIO, possibly due to incomplete inhibition of GSK3. These results indicate that Sox9-promoted β-catenin degradation requires GSK3 activity. Second, a dominant negative mutant of βTrCP (ΔβTrCP), which interacts with phosphorylated β-catenin but is unable to form an SCFβTrCP-ubiquitin ligase complex (50Spencer E. Jiang J. Chen Z.J. Genes Dev... 1999; 13: 284-294Google Scholar), reduced Sox9-promoted β-catenin degradation (Fig. 2D, lanes 4 and 6). Third, Sox9 was unable to promote degradation of a deleted form of β-catenin (ΔNβ-catenin) (51Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature.. 1999; 398: 422-426Google Scholar) that could not be phosphorylated by CKIα or GSK3 (Fig. 2E). This was further supported by our observation that Sox9 was not able to promote the degradation of a stabilized mutant β-catenin that contains a Ser33 to Tyr missense mutation in the SW48 cells (supplemental Fig. S2). In addition, expression of Sox9 in a colon cancer cell line, SW480, which contains a truncated APC protein lacking the Axin binding domain (52Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Ikeda S. Kishida M. Sakamoto I. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 10823-10826Google Scholar), failed to promote β-catenin degradation (supplemental Fig. S2). Finally, expression of Sox9 in an Axin-/- cell line, SNU475 (53Satoh S. Daigo Y. Furukawa Y. Kato T. Miwa N. Nishiwaki T. Kawasoe T. Ishiguro H. Fujita M. Tokino T. Sasaki Y. Imaoka S. Murata M.

DAT is the major clearance mechanism for synaptic dopamine (DA) (1Giros B. Caron M.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci... 1993; 14: 43-49Google Scholar) and thereby regulates the strength and duration of dopaminergic signaling. AMPH and METH are substrates for DAT and competitively inhibit DA uptake (2Rothman R.B. Baumann M.H. Eur. J. Pharmacol... 2003; 479: 23-40Google Scholar, 3Han D.D. Gu H.H.

Despite their structural and pharmacokinetic similarities, a recent National Institute on Drug Abuse report describes METH as a more potent stimulant than AMPH with longer lasting effects at comparable doses (17National Institute on Drug Abuse NIDA Research Report.2006: 1-8Google Scholar). Although the route of METH administration and its availability must contribute to the almost four times higher lifetime nonmedical use of METH compared with AMPH (18Colliver J. Kroutil L.A. Dai L. Gfroerer J.C. Misuse of Prescription Drugs: Data from the 2002, 2003, and 2004 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Office of Applied Studies, Rockville, MD2006Google Scholar), there may also be differences in the mechanisms that underlie the actions of these two drugs on the dopamine transporter. Recent studies by Joyce et al. (19Joyce B.M. Glaser P.E. Gerhardt G.A. Psychopharmacology.. 2007; 191: 669-677Google Scholar) have shown that compared with d-AMPH alone, the combination of d- and l-AMPH in Adderall® significantly prolonged the time course of extracellular DA in vivo. These experiments demonstrate that subtle structural features of AMPH, such as chirality, can affect its action on dopamine transporters. Here we investigate whether METH, a more lipophilic analog of AMPH, affects DAT differently than AMPH, particularly in regard to stimulated DA efflux. METH and AMPH have been reported as equally effective in increasing extracellular DA levels in rodent dorsal striatum (dSTR), nucleus accumbens (NAc) (10Segal D.S. Kuczenski R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther... 1997; 282: 561-573Google Scholar, 14Rothman R.B. Baumann M.H. Dersch C.M. Romero D.V. Rice K.C. Carroll F.I. Partilla J.S. Synapse.. 2001; 39: 32-41Google Scholar, 20Shoblock J.R. Sullivan E.B. Maisonneuve I.M. Glick S.D. Psychopharmacology.. 2003; 165: 359-369Google Scholar), striatal synaptosomes, and DAT-expressing cells in vitro (3Han D.D. Gu H.H. BMC Pharmacol... 2006; 6: 6Google Scholar, 6Wall S.C. Gu H. Rudnick G. Mol. Pharmacol... 1995; 47: 544-550Google Scholar). John and Jones (21John C.E. Jones S.R. Neuropharmacology.. 2007; 52: 1596-1605Google Scholar), however, have recently shown in mouse striatal and substantia nigra slices, that AMPH is a more potent inhibitor of DA uptake than METH. On the other hand, in synaptosomes METH inhibits DA uptake three times more effectively than AMPH (14Rothman R.B. Baumann M.H. Dersch C.M. Romero D.V. Rice K.C. Carroll F.I. Partilla J.S. Synapse.. 2001; 39: 32-41Google Scholar), and in DAT-expressing COS-7 cells, METH releases DA more potently than AMPH (EC50 = 0.2 μm for METH versus EC50 = 1.7 μm for AMPH) (5Eshleman A.J. Henningsen R.A. Neve K.A. Janowsky A. Mol. Pharmacol... 1994; 45: 312-316Google Scholar). However, these differences do not hold up under all conditions. For example, in a study utilizing C6 cells, the disparity between AMPH and METH was not found (12Johnson R.A. Eshleman A.J. Meyers T. Neve K.A. Janowsky A. Synapse.. 1998; 30: 97-106Google Scholar). The variations in AMPH and METH data extend to animal models. AMPH- and METH-mediated behavior has been reported as similar (22Kuczenski R. Segal D.S. Cho A.K. Melega W. J. Neurosci... 1995; 15: 1308-1317Google Scholar), lower (20Shoblock J.R. Sullivan E.B. Maisonneuve I.M. Glick S.D. Psychopharmacology.. 2003; 165: 359-369Google Scholar), or higher (23Hall D.A. Stanis J.J. Marquez Avila H. Gulley J.M. Psychopharmacology.. 2008; 195: 469-478Google Scholar) for AMPH compared with METH. Furthermore, although the maximal locomotor activation response was less for METH than for AMPH at a lower dose (2 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), both drugs decreased locomotor activity at a higher dose (4 mg/kg) (20Shoblock J.R. Sullivan E.B. Maisonneuve I.M. Glick S.D. Psychopharmacology.. 2003; 165: 359-369Google Scholar). In contrast, in the presence of a salient stimuli, METH is more potent in increasing the overall magnitude of locomotor activity in rats yet is equipotent with AMPH in the absence of these stimuli (23Hall D.A. Stanis J.J. Marquez Avila H. Gulley J.M. Psychopharmacology.. 2008; 195: 469-478Google Scholar). The simultaneous regulation of DA uptake and efflux by DAT substrates such as AMPH and METH, as well as the voltage dependence of DAT (24Sonders M.S. Zhu S.J. Zahniser N.R. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci... 1997; 17: 960-974Google Scholar), may confound the interpretation of existing data describing the action of these drugs. Our biophysical approaches allowed us to significantly decrease the contribution of DA uptake and more accurately determine DAT-mediated DA efflux with millisecond time resolution. We have thus exploited time-resolved, whole-cell voltage clamp in combination with in vitro and in vivo microamperometry and Ca2+ imaging to compare the impact of METH and AMPH on DAT function and determine the consequence of these interactions on cell physiology. We find that near the resting potential, METH is more effective than AMPH in stimulating DAT to release DA. In addition, at efficacious concentrations METH generates more current, greater DA efflux, and higher Ca2+ release from internal stores than AMPH. Both METH-induced or the lesser AMPH-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+ are independent of membrane potential. The additional Ca2+ response induced by METH requires intact phosphorylation sites in the N-terminal domain of DAT. Finally, our in vivo voltammetry data indicate that METH inhibits clearance of locally applied DA more effectively than AMPH in the rat nucleus accumbens, which plays an important role in reward and addiction, but not in the dorsal striatum, which is involved in a variety of cognitive functions. Taken together these data imply that AMPH and METH have distinguishable effects on DAT that can be shown both at the molecular level and in vivo, and are likely to be implicated in the relative euphoric and addictive properties of these two psychostimulants. Reagents and drugs were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. The cell lines used in this study have been characterized previously (25Khoshbouei H. Wang H. Lechleiter J.D. Javitch J.A. Galli A. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 278: 12070-12077Google Scholar, 26Khoshbouei H. Sen N. Guptaroy B. Johnson L. Lund D. Gnegy M.E. Galli A. Javitch J.A.

Briefly, a fluorescently tagged DAT was constructed by fusing the C terminus of the coding region of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) from pEYFP-N1 (Clontech) to the N terminus of the human synthetic DAT cDNA, thereby creating the fusion construct YFP-DAT. Unless stated otherwise, YFP-DAT refers to YFP-tagged wild type DAT. This construct was subcloned into a bicistronic expression vector (30Rees S. Coote J. Stables J. Goodson S. Harris S. Lee M.G. BioTechniques.. 1996; 20 (106, 108-110): 102-104Google Scholar) modified to express the synthetic DAT from a cytomegalovirus promoter and the hygromycin resistance gene from an internal ribosomal entry site (pciHyg), as described previously (25Khoshbouei H. Wang H. Lechleiter J.D. Javitch J.A. Galli A. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 278: 12070-12077Google Scholar, 28Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2001; 98: 10055-10060Google Scholar). EM4 cells, a HEK 293 cell line stably transfected with macrophage scavenger receptor (31Robbins A.K. Horlick R.A. BioTechniques.. 1998; 25: 240-244Google Scholar), were transfected with YFP-DAT using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), and a stably transfected pool (DAT cells) was selected in 250 μg/ml hygromycin as described previously (25Khoshbouei H. Wang H. Lechleiter J.D. Javitch J.A. Galli A. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 278: 12070-12077Google Scholar, 28Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2001; 98: 10055-10060Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Our previous studies have shown that addition of the N-terminal YFP tag does not alter the ability of the transporter to produce substrate-induced currents (25Khoshbouei H. Wang H. Lechleiter J.D. Javitch J.A. Galli A. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 278: 12070-12077Google Scholar). In the YFP-DAT background, Ser-2, Ser-4, Ser-7, Ser-12, and Ser-13 were simultaneously mutated to alanine or aspartate in the YFP-S/A-DAT and YFP-S/D-DAT constructs, respectively (26Khoshbouei H. Sen N. Guptaroy B. Johnson L. Lund D. Gnegy M.E. Galli A. Javitch J.A. PLoS Biol... 2004; 2: E78Google Scholar). The mutant constructs were generated, confirmed, and expressed stably as described above. Our electrophysiological setup is equipped with the Nikon TE-2000U wide field microscope and filters that allow us to select cells for recording with maximum YFP signal and therefore human DAT expression. Parental nontransfected EM4 cells were used for control experiments. The EM4 cell line provides an appropriate parental background for studying DAT function because of the absence of DA uptake (32Kahlig K.M. Javitch J.A. Galli A. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 8966-8975Google Scholar, 33Kahlig K.M. Binda F. Khoshbouei H. Blakely R.D. McMahon D.G. Javitch J.A. Galli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2005; 102: 3495-3500Google Scholar) and the lack of substrate-induced whole-cell currents (25Khoshbouei H. Wang H. Lechleiter J.D. Javitch J.A. Galli A. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 278: 12070-12077Google Scholar). Whole-cell Currents—Before recording from parental or stably expressing cells, cells were plated at 105 per 35-mm culture dish. Attached cells were washed three times with external solution at room temperature. The external solution contained 130 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 34 mm dextrose, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgSO4, and 1.3 mm KH2PO4 adjusted to pH 7.35 with a final osmolarity of 290 mosm. For measurement of the membrane potential as a function of external KCl, the osmolarity of the external solutions was controlled by decreasing the dextrose concentration in the external solution. The pipette solution for the whole-cell recording contained the following: 120 mm CsCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 1.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, and 30 mm dextrose plus 2 mm DA (when specified in the text)) adjusted to pH 7.35. The final osmolarity was 270 mosm. Previously, we have demonstrated that DAT activity increases intracellular Na+ and that a high concentration of Na+ in the recording pipette increases DA efflux (25Khoshbouei H. Wang H. Lechleiter J.D. Javitch J.A. Galli A. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 278: 12070-12077Google Scholar). Thus, to amplify DA efflux and to maintain an approximately constant Na+ concentration inside the cell, the concentration of NaCl in the pipette solution was increased to 30 mm in the presence or absence of 2 mm DA as specified in the text. Patch electrodes were pulled from quartz pipettes on a P-2000 puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) and filled with the pipette solution. Whole-cell currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200B (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with a low-pass Bessel filter set at 1,000 Hz. Current-voltage relations were generated using a voltage step (500 ms) protocol ranging from -100 to +60 mV separated by 20 mV from a holding potential of -20 mV. Data were recorded and analyzed off-line using pCLAMP 9 software (Molecular Devices). Amperometry—We monitored DA efflux simultaneously with whole-cell recording using an amperometric electrode (depicted in Fig. 3A). This amperometric carbon fiber electrode (ProCFE, Dagan Corp.), connected to a second amplifier (Axopatch 200B, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), was attached to the plasma membrane of the cell and held at +700 mV, a potential greater than the redox potential of DA. The diameter of the carbon fiber electrode was 5 μm. An oxidative (amperometric) current-voltage relationship was generated as above. Unlike the usual amperometric calibration, which requires conversion to concentration, we report the current directly without considering the effective volume. Thus, our requirements are a defined base line, and our data represent a lower limit to the DA efflux, because some transmitter is lost to the bulk solution as described previously (25Khoshbouei H. Wang H. Lechleiter J.D. Javitch J.A. Galli A. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 278: 12070-12077Google Scholar, 26Khoshbouei H. Sen N. Guptaroy B. Johnson L. Lund D. Gnegy M.E. Galli A. Javitch J.A. PLoS Biol... 2004; 2: E78Google Scholar). Assume an electrode-gathering volume of 0.1 μm3 that within this volume [DA] is constant for 1 ms and that one DA ion converts to 1 electron. Then 1 pA implies 0.625 × 104 DA molecules flow into the assumed volume in 1 ms. Under these assumptions, 1 pA converts to 100 μm DA and 0.01 pA converts to 1 μm DA. The amperometric currents were low pass filtered at 100 Hz. Data were recorded and analyzed off-line using pCLAMP 9 software. An upward deflection in the amperometric currents corresponds to an outward flux of DA. At the “on” of the voltage step, for voltages more positive than -40 mV, the amperometric electrode recorded an oxidation current (positive). This positive current is indicative of DA efflux. At the “off” of the voltage step, the amperometric current relaxed to base line. The on and off of the voltage step are defined by the vertical arrows in Fig. 3A, right panel. Moving the carbon fiber away from the patch caused the oxidative response to become smaller and slower. Furthermore, as expected for DA oxidation, the oxidative response diminished when we reduced the carbon fiber voltage to +300 mV and disappeared completely on further reduction. For both whole-cell current and amperometry recordings, the DAT-mediated DA efflux was isolated by subtracting the current produced in the presence of cocaine from the base-line current (current produced in the absence of METH or AMPH). The METH- and AMPH-induced DA efflux were defined as the current recorded in the presence of the substrates (METH or AMPH), minus the current recorded after addition of cocaine to the bath with substrate still present. The steady-state current at a particular voltage was calculated as the average current during the final 100 ms of each potential tested. Plotting the steady-state current against the test voltage generated current-voltage (I(V)) relationships. In vivo clearance of locally applied DA was measured in out-bred male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 52, mean weight = 262 ± 10 g; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) using electrochemical methods described in detail elsewhere (34Zahniser N.R. Dickinson S.D. Gerhardt G.A. Methods Enzymol.. 1998; 296: 708-719Google Scholar, 35Gulley J.M. Everett C.V. Zahniser N.R. Brain Res... 2007; 1151: 32-45Google Scholar). Animals were housed on a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on at 0600 h) with ad libitum food and water. All animal-use procedures were in strict accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Colorado, Denver. Recording electrodes, calibrated in vitro for their response to DA, consisted of a single 30-μm diameter Nafion-coated carbon fiber. A calibrated electrode was attached to a single-barrel pipette loaded with 200 mm DA, 100 mm ascorbic acid (pH 7.4). Rats were anesthetized with urethane (1.25–1.5 g/kg, intraperitoneal), and electrode/pipette assemblies were lowered under stereotaxic control into a single location (1.5 mm anterior, 2.2 mm lateral with respect to bregma) in either dSTR (3.8-4.9 mm ventral with respect to the brain surface) or NAc (6.5–8.0 mm ventral) (36Paxinos G. Watson C. The Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. Academic Press, San Diego1998Google Scholar). An Ag/AgCl reference electrode was lowered just anterior to the interaural line into the cerebral cortex. Chronoamperometric measurements were made using an IVEC-10 system (Quanteon, LLC, Lexington, KY), which applied square-wave pulses of 0.00–0.55 V (with respect to reference) at a frequency of 5 Hz. Resulting oxidation (and reduction) currents were digitally integrated, and changes in DA oxidation signals were expressed quantitatively based on the in vitro calibration. For all in vivo chronoamperometry experiments, the background current was set to zero prior to pressure-ejecting DA (10–22 p.s.i. for 0.1–4.0 s) at calibrated volumes (96 ± 10 nl). For a given assembly, an ejection volume was chosen that resulted in signal amplitudes of 1.0–3.7 μm. Ejections were made at 5-min intervals, and a base line was established when signal amplitude varied by ≤15% for two consecutive applications. Volumes were monitored for consistency during each DA application and were not altered within a given experiment. After measures of base-line DA clearance (DAT function) were obtained, rats were injected with either 1 or 5 mg/kg AMPH or METH (intraperitoneal) 1 min prior to t = 0. DA ejections were continued at 5-min intervals for 60 min. All recording sites were confirmed histologically. Two signal parameters were analyzed from the DA oxidation currents as follows: maximal signal amplitude (Amax) and signal time course (T80; the time for the signal to rise to Amax and then decay by 80%). Each data set was normalized by obtaining a mean value for parameters during the two-point base-line period, setting this value to 100%, and expressing all data as a percentage of this base-line value. Cells stably expressing YFP-DAT, YFP-S/A-DAT, YFP-S/D-DAT, or parental nontransfected EM4 cells were plated on glass bottom microwell dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) 48 h before the experiments. Cells were loaded with the cell-permeant, Ca2+-sensitive dye Fura 2-AM (5 μm) (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) for 30 min at 37 °C, washed three times in external solution, and acclimated to room temperature for 10 min. The dishes were mounted on an inverted Nikon TE2000E microscope at room temperature. Images were collected using a 40×, 1.3 NA, oil immersion Plan Fluor objective lens, and a side-mounted CoolSNAPHQ2 camera. Fluorescence was monitored using dual excitation wavelengths (340/380 nm) and a single emission wavelength (510 nm). Fluorescence at 340 nm indicates dye bound to Ca2+, whereas that at 380 nm corresponds to free dye. Basal readings were taken for 60 s before addition of METH or AMPH (10 μm). In some experiments cells were incubated with either COC (10 μm), thapsigargin (2 μm), or CdCl2 (2 mm) for 5 min before stimulation of the cells with AMPH or METH. Nikon Elements Advanced Research imaging software (Nikon Instruments) was used for automated collection of images at ∼1-s intervals over a 5-min period. During this time, cells maintained a healthy morphology. Images of cells expressing YFP-DAT were taken with a FITC HyQ filter cube before and after the addition of METH or AMPH. Only cells expressing detectable YFP-DAT signals were included in the analysis. Average fluorescence measurements were determined using Nikon Elements software. Data are expressed as the ratio of bound:free (340/380 values) Fura 2-AM fluorescence intensities after background subtraction. For time-matched statistical analysis, the Ca2+ levels were normalized to the average fluorescence intensities (340/380 values) of basal values (first 60 images). As a positive control for cell viability and for FURA-2 AM function, 5 μm ionomycin was added at the termination of all calcium mobilization assays. More than 95% of the cells exhibited a rapid increase in internal Ca2+ in response to ionomycin, and only ionomycin-sensitive cells were included in the analysis. The data are expressed as mean values ± S.E. For most of the results, GraphPad Prism 4 was used to determine statistical significance. ANOVA with post hoc Newman-Keuls was used for the statistical comparison of more than two means. The two-tailed, unpaired Student's t test was applied when two means were compared. The in vivo chronoamperometry results were analyzed using three-way ANOVA (SigmaStat) followed by Tukey post hoc analysis. Quantification of DAT-induced Depolarization in HEK Cells—First, we investigated the electrogenic properties of DAT (24Sonders M.S. Zhu S.J. Zahniser N.R. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci... 1997; 17: 960-974Google Scholar) and the impact of the leak current on membrane potential by comparing DAT-expressing cells with nontransfected parental cells. The cells were held at -20 mV and stepped in 20-mV increments from -100 to +60 mV. For the in vitro electrophysiology experiments, we empirically selected a holding potential of -20 mV, which improves the integrity of the cells and keeps them viable for up to 1 h. More negative holding potentials produce significant background inward current, and by holding at -20 mV and briefly probing more negative potentials, we more accurately assessed differences in AMPH- and METH-stimulated effects on human DAT. Fig. 1A shows the current-voltage relationships for parental versus DAT-expressing cells. Both data sets are shown after subtraction of currents measured in the presence of 10 μm COC, a DAT inhibitor. Parental cells displayed a COC-insensitive whole-cell current, whereas DAT-transfected cells displayed a constitutive COC-sensitive current. The average values of the currents recorded from DAT-expressing cells versus parental cells were profoundly different. At +60 mV, the current recorded in parental cells was 32.5 ± 13.6 pA, n = 9, whereas in DAT-expressing cells it was 118.9 ± 30.7 pA, n = 8 (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1A). At -60 mV, the current in parental cells was -0.25 ± 2.9 pA, n = 9, and in DAT-expressing cells it was -18.1 ± 1.7 pA, n = 8 (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, parental cells have a resting potential of -56.3 ± 4.7 mV, whereas the resting potential in DAT-expressing cells was -36.5 ± 5.5 mV (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1B). Thus, even in the absence of DA, the presence of DAT at the plasma membrane of YFP-DAT-expressing cells depolarizes the cells. This finding is consistent with the presence of a well characterized endogenous DAT leak current in the absence of the substrate (24Sonders M.S. Zhu S.J. Zahniser N.R. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci... 1997; 17: 960-974Google Scholar). Direction of DAT-mediated, DA-induced Currents Depends on Whether DA Is Inside or Outside the Cell—We found that exposure of DAT-expressing cells to DA produces currents, and that the direction of these currents differs when DA is present inside versus outside the cells. As shown in Fig. 2, bath application of 2 mm DA generated inward currents in DAT-expressing cells (closed squares) consistent with previous findings (24Sonders M.S. Zhu S.J. Zahniser N.R. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci... 1997; 17: 960-974Google Scholar), and when DA was perfused into these cells via a whole-cell pipette, it generated outward currents (open circles). Both of these currents were inhibited by bath application of 10 μm COC, and neither of these DA-dependent currents was detected in parental cells (data not show"

Specifically, our results indicate that HA binding to CD44 up-regulates p300 expression and its acetyltransferase activity that, in turn, promotes acetylation of β-catenin and NFκB-p65 leading to activation of β-catenin-associated T-cell factor/lymphocyte enhancer factor transcriptional co-activation and NFκB-specific transcriptional up-regulation, respectively. These changes then cause the expression of the MDR1 (P-glycoprotein/P-gp) gene and the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-xL resulting in chemoresistance in MCF-7 cells. Our data also show that down-regulation of p300, β-catenin, or NFκB-p65 in MCF-7 cells (by transfecting cells with p300-, β-catenin-, or NFκB-p65-specific small interfering RNA) inhibits the HA/CD44-mediated β-catenin/NFκB-p65 acetylation and abrogates the aforementioned transcriptional activities. Subsequently, there is a significant decrease in both MDR1 and Bcl-xL gene expression and an enhancement in caspase-3 activity and chemosensitivity in the breast tumor cells. Further analyses indicate that activation of SIRT1 (deacetylase) by resveratrol (a natural antioxidant) induces SIRT1-p300 association and acetyltransferase inactivation, leading to deacetylation of HA/CD44-induced β-catenin and NFκB-p65, inhibition of β-catenin-T-cell factor/lymphocyte enhancer factor and NFκB-specific transcriptional activation, and the impairment of MDR1 and Bcl-xL gene expression. All these multiple effects lead to an activation of caspase-3 and a reduction of chemoresistance. Together, these findings suggest that the interactions between HA/CD44-stimulated p300 (acetyltransferase) and resveratrol-activated SIRT1 (deacetylase) play pivotal roles in regulating the balance between cell survival versus apoptosis, and multidrug resistance versus sensitivity in breast tumor cells.

Because little is known regarding the molecular basis of breast tumor cell signaling and chemotherapeutic responses, it is important to identify molecule(s) that can be used to predict the oncogenic potential and possible chemoresistance of breast carcinoma-derived cancer cells. During the search for cellular regulators that correlate with breast tumor cell functions and possible chemoresistance, hyaluronan (HA) 2The abbreviations used are: HA, hyaluronan; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; HDAC, histone deacetylase; TCF/LEF, T-cell factor/lymphocyte enhancer factor; siRNA, small interfering RNA; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone; Q-PC, quantitative PCR; IKK, inhibitor of κB kinase; MDR, multidrug resistance.

HA is a nonsulfated, unbranched glycosaminoglycan consisting of repeating disaccharide units, d-glucuronic acid and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (6Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.E.

In breast cancer patients, HA concentrations are often higher in malignant tumors than in benign or normal tissues, and in some tumor types the level of HA is predictive of malignancy (11Toole B.P. Wight T. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem... 2002; 277: 4593-4596Google Scholar). Furthermore, elevated HA levels have been found in the serum of breast cancer patients (12Delpech B. Cheyallier B. Reinhardt N.

Nucleotide sequence analyses reveal that there exist numerous CD44 isoforms (derived by alternative splicing mechanisms), all of which are variants of the standard form, CD44s (17Screaton G.R.

Cell Sci... 1992; 103: 293-298Google Scholar). The CD44 isoforms expressed in breast cancer stem cells display a unique ability to initiate tumor cell-specific properties (20Al-Hajj M. Wicha M.S.

Recent studies indicate that breast cancer tumors contain a subpopulation of highly tumorigenic cancer stem cells characterized by high CD44 expression and low (or no) CD24 expression (CD44+CD24–/low) (20Al-Hajj M.

These findings indicate that CD44-expressing breast tumor cells display the hallmark stem cell properties of self-renewal and the ability to generate heterogeneous cell populations. In fact, CD44 is now thought to be one of the important cell surface markers for cancer stem cells (20Al-Hajj M. Wicha M.S. Benito-Hernandez A. Morrison S.J. Clarke M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Head Neck Surg.. 2006; 132: 19-24Google Scholar), epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated ERK signaling (44Wang S.J. Bourguignon L.Y. Arch. Otolaryngol. Head Neck Surg.. 2006; 132: 771-778Google Scholar), topoisomerase activation (45Wang S.J. Peyrollier K. Bourguignon L.Y. Arch. Otolaryngol. Head Neck Surg.. 2007; 133: 281-288Google Scholar), and ankyrin function (46Bourguignon L.Y. Peyrollier K. Xia W. Gilad E. J. Biol. Chem... 2008; 283: 17635-17651Google Scholar)) leads to multidrug resistance in tumor cells. However, the mechanism by which HA/CD44 activates the oncogenic signaling leading to multidrug resistance in breast cancer has not been fully elucidated. The transcriptional co-activator p300 is a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) (47Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature.. 1996; 384: 641-643Google Scholar, 48Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell.. 1996; 87: 953-959Google Scholar) that serves to integrate diverse signaling pathways involved in different cellular functions (49Jabnknecht R. Hunter T. Curr. Biol... 1996; 6: 22-23Google Scholar). It has been shown that p300 contributes to the assembly of multicomponent transcription co-activator complexes (50Chan H.M. Thangue N.B.L. J. Cell Sci... 2001; 114: 2363-2373Google Scholar). Specifically, the p300 acetyltransferase promotes histone acetylation that, inturn, regulates promoter activity by removing chromatin-dependent repression (51Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev... 2000; 64: 435-459Google Scholar, 52Pumfery A. Deng L. Maddukuri A. de la Fuente C. Li H. Wade J.D. Lambert P. Kumar A. Kashanchi F. Curr. HIV Res... 2003; 1: 343-362Google Scholar). Furthermore, the p300 acetyltransferase acetylates a number of transcriptional factors (e.g. p53, FOXO-1, E2F, HMG I(Y), and HNF-4) resulting in transcriptional regulation (53Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell.. 1997; 90: 595-606Google Scholar, 54Kiernan R.E. Vanhulle C. Schiltz L. Adam E. Xiao H. Maudoux F. Calomme C. Burny A. Nakatani Y. Jeang K.T. Benkirane M. Van Lint C.

A recent study indicates that p300 acetyltransferase acetylates β-catenin (at lysine 345) (58Lévy L. Wei Y. Labalette C. Wu Y. Renard C.A. Buendia M.A. Neuveut C. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2004; 24: 3404-3414Google Scholar), which then binds to the transcription factor T-cell factor/lymphocyte enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) in the nucleus (58Lévy L. Wei Y. Labalette C. Wu Y. Renard C.A. Buendia M.A. Neuveut C. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2004; 24: 3404-3414Google Scholar). This event is followed by transcriptional activation of target genes such as c-myc, E-cadherin, and cyclin D1 (59Roose J. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1999; 1424: M23-M37Google Scholar). In addition, p300 acetyltransferase acetylates NFκB-p65 (at lysine 310) (60Chen L. Fischle W. Verdin E. Greene W.C. Science.. 2001; 293: 1653-1657Google Scholar, 61Yeung F. Hoberg J.E. Ramsey C.S. Keller M.D. Jones D.R. Frye R.A. Mayo M.W. EMBO J.. 2004; 23: 2369-2380Google Scholar) which in turn stimulates NFκB-specific transcriptional activity and up-regulates the expression of the anti-apoptotic genes of the Bcl-2 family, such as Bcl-xL (62Rayet B. Gélinas C. Oncogene.. 1999; 18: 6938-6947Google Scholar, 63Graham B. Gibson S.B. Cell Cycle.. 2005; 4: 1342-1345Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of a proteolytic fragment of the cytoplasmic domain of CD44 potentiates transactivation mediated by p300 (64Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Murakami D. Sasayama T. Araki N. Miki T. Wong A.J. Saya H. J. Cell Biol... 2001; 155: 755-762Google Scholar), whereas degradation of p300 is sufficient to cause transcriptional repression and chemosensitivity (65Poizat C. Sartorelli V. Chung G. Kloner R.A. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2000; 20: 8643-8654Google Scholar). However, the exact regulatory mechanisms involved in CD44-linked p300 signaling and chemotherapeutic responses in breast tumor cells have not been established. The SIR2 (the silent information regulator 2-also referred to as sirtuins) gene family of protein belongs to histone deacetylases (HDACs), which are highly conserved with seven mammalian homologs, SIRT1–SIRT7 (66Frye R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 2000; 273: 793-798Google Scholar). SIRT1 is an NAD+-dependent deacetylase that is implicated in the regulation of cell survival and longevity/life span in many different organisms ranging from yeast to mice (67Anastasiou D. Krek W. Physiology (Bethesda).. 2006; 21: 404-410Google Scholar, 68Guarente L. Picard F. Cell.. 2005; 120: 473-482Google Scholar, 69Blander G. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 2004; 73: 417-435Google Scholar). SIRT1 has also been found in a variety of epithelial tumors, including breast cancer cells (70Mariadason J.M. Epigenetics.. 2008; 3: 28-37Google Scholar, 71Li H. Rajendran G.K. Liu N. Ware C. Rubin B.P. Gu Y. Breast Cancer Res... 2007; 9: R1Google Scholar). Resveratrol (3,5,4-trihydroxystilbene) is a phytoalexin extracted from vegetal dietary sources and displays chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic properties (72Baur J.A. Sinclair D.A. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov.. 2006; 5: 493-506Google Scholar, 73Jang M. Cai L. Udeani G.O. Slowing K.V. Thomas C.F. Beecher C.W. Fong H.H. Farnsworth N.R. Kinghorn A.D. Mehta R.G. Moon R.C. Pezzuto J.M. Science.. 1997; 275: 218-220Google Scholar, 74Scultz J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst.. 2004; 96: 1497-1498Google Scholar). The function of resveratrol is thought to involve the activation of SIRT1 deacetylase activity leading to transcriptional silencing (75Kaeberlein M. McDonagh T. Heltweg B. Hixon J. Westman E.A. Caldwell S.D. Napper A. Curtis R. DiStefano P.S. Fields S. Bedalov A. Kennedy B.K. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 17038-17045Google Scholar). In fact, resveratrol is now considered to be a powerful cancer-fighting agent (74Scultz J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst.. 2004; 96: 1497-1498Google Scholar, 76Pervaiz S. Drug Resist. Updates.. 2004; 7: 333-344Google Scholar, 77Cal C. Garban H. Jazirehi A. Yeh C. Mizutani Y. Bonavida B. Curr. Med. Chem. Anticancer Agents.. 2003; 3: 77-93Google Scholar). Because very little is known about the intracellular pathways that may be affected by resveratrol-mediated SIRT1 activity, identification of signaling events will be very important. At present, SIRT1 has been shown to regulate cell fate in part by deacetylating the p53 protein at lysine 382 and inhibiting p53-mediated transcriptional activation and apoptosis (78Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Imai S. Chen D. Su F. Shiloh A. Guarente L. Gu W. Cell.. 2001; 107: 137-148Google Scholar). Activated SIRT1 also antagonizes p300-mediated activation and acetylation of NFκB-p65 that, in turn, attenuates transcriptional activity and reduces the expression of anti-apoptotic genes (e.g. Bcl-xL) leading to apoptosis or cell death (61Yeung F. Hoberg J.E. Ramsey C.S. Keller M.D. Jones D.R. Frye R.A. Mayo M.W. EMBO J.. 2004; 23: 2369-2380Google Scholar, 79Engel N. Mahlknecht U. Int. J. Mol. Med... 2008; 21: 223-232Google Scholar). Furthermore, SIRT1 induces deacetylation and repression of p300 itself (81Bouras T. Fu M. Sauve A.A. Wang F. Quong A.A. Perkins N.D. Hay R.T. Gu W. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 10264-10276Google Scholar). Mutational analysis demonstrated that SIRT1 repression of p300 involves both lysine 1020 and lysine 1024 (81Bouras T. Fu M. Sauve A.A. Wang F. Quong A.A. Perkins N.D. Hay R.T. Gu W. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 10264-10276Google Scholar). These results indicate the possible existence of important cross-talk between SIRT1 and p300 in the regulation of cellular signaling. The question of whether an interaction between resveratrol-activated SIRT1 and p300 occurs in HA/CD44-mediated oncogenesis and chemoresistance in breast tumor cells is an important focus of this study. Cell Culture—The human breast tumor cell line, MCF-7 cells, was purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were routinely serum-starved (and therefore deprived of serum HA) before adding HA. Antibodies and Reagents—Monoclonal rat anti-CD44 antibody (clone 020; isotype IgG2b; obtained from CMB-TECH, Inc., San Francisco) recognizes a determinant of the HA-binding region common to CD44 and its principal variant isoforms (13Götte M.

This rat anti-CD44 was routinely used for HA-related blocking experiments and immunoprecipitation. Immunoreagents such as goat anti-MDR1 (P-glycoprotein 170) antibody, rabbit anti-SIRT1 antibody, mouse anti-β-catenin antibody, and mouse anti-NFκB-p65 antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Several reagents, including resveratrol, rabbit anti-Bcl-xL antibody, and rabbit anti-acetylated lysine antibody, were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Mouse anti-p300 antibody and rabbit anti-pro-caspase-3 antibody were purchased from EMD Chemicals, Inc. (Gibbstown, NJ) and Millipore (Billerica, MA), respectively. Rabbit anti-NFκB-p65 (acetyl-K-310) antibody was from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA). Caspase-3 inhibitor V (Z-D(OMe)QMD(OMe)-FMK) was purchased from Calbiochem. Doxorubicin hydrochloride and etoposide (VP-16) were from Sigma. Healon HA polymers (∼500,000-dalton polymers), purchased from Pharmacia & Upjohn Co. (Kalamazoo, MI), were prepared by gel filtration column chromatography using a Sephacryl S1000 column. The purity of the HA polymers used in our experiments was further verified by anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography followed by protein and endotoxin analyses using BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) and an in vitro Limulus amebocyte lysate assay (Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville Inc., Walkersville, MD), respectively. No protein or endotoxin contamination was detected in this HA preparation. RNA Oligonucleotides—The siRNA sequence targeting human p300 or β-catenin or NFκB-p65 (from mRNA sequence, GenBank™ accession numbers NM_001429 or NM_001904 or NM_021975, respectively) corresponds to the coding region relative to the first nucleotide of the start codon. Target sequences were selected using the software developed by Ambion Inc. As recommended by Ambion, p300-specific or β-catenin-specific or NFκB-p65-specific targeted regions were selected beginning 50–100 nucleotides downstream from the start codon. Sequences close to 50% G/C content were chosen. Specifically, p300 target sequence (5′-AATGGTGCTGAAGAGGAGGGA-3′), β-catenin target sequence (5′-AAATCAATCCAACAGTAGCCT-3′), NFκB-p65 target sequences (target sequence 1, 5′-AAGGATTGAGGAGAAACGTAA-3′; target sequence 2, 5′-AACTCAAGATCTGCCGAGTGA-3′; target sequence 3, 5′-AAGGCTATAACTCGCCTAGTG-3′; and target sequence 4, 5′-AAGATTGAGGAGAAACGTAAA-3′), and scrambled sequences (5′-AAGGGAGTGTGAGAGTGAGCG-3′) were used. These p300/β-catenin/NFκB-p65-specific target sequences were then aligned to the human genome data base in a BLAST search to eliminate sequences with significant homology to other genes. Sense and antisense oligonucleotides were provided by Operon Biotechnologies Inc. (Huntsville, AL) and Thermo Scientific Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). For construction of the siRNA, a transcription-based kit from Ambion was used (Silencer™ siRNA construction kit). MCF-7 cells were then transfected with siRNA using siPORT Lipid as transfection reagent (Silencer™ siRNA transfection kit; Ambion, TX) according to the protocol provided by Ambion. Cells were incubated with 50 pmol of p300 siRNA or 50 pmol of β-catenin siRNA or 50 pmol of NFκB-p65siRNA or 50 pmol of siRNA containing scrambled sequences or no siRNA for at least 48 h before biochemical experiments and/or functional assays were conducted as described below. Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR)—Total RNA was isolated from MCF-7 cells (untransfected or transfected (50 pmol each) with p300 siRNA or β-catenin siRNA or NFκB-p65 siRNA or siRNA with scrambled sequences; or treated with 20 μm resveratrol in the presence or absence of 50 μg/ml HA treatment for 24 h) using Tripure isolation reagent kits (Roche Applied Science), as described above. First strand cDNAs were synthesized from RNA using Superscript First Strand Synthesis system (Invitrogen). Gene expression was quantified using probe-based Sybr Green PCR master mix kits, ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system, and SDS software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A cycle threshold (minimal PCR cycles required for generating a fluorescent signal exceeding a preset threshold) was determined for each gene of interest and normalized to a cycle threshold for a housekeeping gene (36B4) determined in parallel. The 36B4 is a human acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein PO whose expression was not changed in tumor cells transfected with p300 siRNA (or with β-catenin siRNA, NFκB-p65 siRNA, siRNA with scrambled sequences) or treated with 20 μm resveratrol in the presence or absence of 24 h of HA treatment.

https://openalex.org/W2072558429,"Phosphoinositides are membrane-delimited regulators of protein function and control many different cellular targets. The differentially phosphorylated isoforms have distinct concentrations in various subcellular membranes, which can change dynamically in response to cellular signaling events. Maintenance and dynamics of phosphoinositide levels involve a complex set of enzymes, among them phospholipases and lipid kinases and phosphatases. Recently, a novel type of phosphoinositide-converting protein (termed Ci-VSP) that contains a voltage sensor domain was isolated. It was already shown that Ci-VSP can alter phosphoinositide levels in a voltage-dependent manner. However, the exact enzymatic reaction catalyzed by Ci-VSP is not known. We used fluorescent phosphoinositide-binding probes and total internal reflection microscopy together with patch-clamp measurements from living cells to delineate substrates and products of Ci-VSP. Upon activation of Ci-VSP by membrane depolarization, membrane association of phosphatidylinositol (PI) (4,5)P2- and PI(3,4,5)P3-specific binding domains decreased, revealing consumption of these phosphoinositides by Ci-VSP. Depletion of PI(4,5)P2 was coincident with an increase in membrane PI(4)P. Similarly, PI(3,4)P2 was generated during depletion of PI(3,4,5)P3. These results suggest that Ci-VSP acts as a 5′-phosphatase of PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3.

Phosphoinositides (PIs) 2The abbreviations used are: PIs, phosphoinositides; PI(3,4,5)P3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; VSD, voltage sensor domain; TIRF, total internal reflection; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; mRFP, monomeric red fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; AMP-PCP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylenetriphosphate); PLCδ1-PH, phospholipase Cδ1 pleckstrin homology domain; OSBP, oxysterol-binding protein; PIP5K, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase; PAO, phenylarsine oxide; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. 2The abbreviations used are: PIs, phosphoinositides; PI(3,4,5)P3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; VSD, voltage sensor domain; TIRF, total internal reflection; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; mRFP, monomeric red fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; AMP-PCP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylenetriphosphate); PLCδ1-PH, phospholipase Cδ1 pleckstrin homology domain; OSBP, oxysterol-binding protein; PIP5K, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase; PAO, phenylarsine oxide; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. are minor components of all cell membranes and have important and diverse roles in the control of protein function and as organelle-specific membrane labels. Via dynamic concentration changes that result from breakdown or interconversion of PI isoforms, PIs act as bona fide second messengers (reviewed in Ref. 1Di Paolo G. De Camilli P. Nature.. 2006; 443: 651-657Google Scholar). PI dynamics can occur in response to a huge variety of cellular events, including the activation of plasma membrane receptors.Knowledge of cellular PI signaling has dramatically increased over the last years. Much of this progress derives from the characterization of a complex set of enzymes that generate, interconvert, and degrade the various PI isoforms (2Toker A. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci.. 2002; 59: 761-779Google Scholar) and from the introduction of genetically encoded lipid probes that allow the tracking of the dynamics of specific PI isoforms by live cell fluorescence microscopy (3Varnai P. Balla T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2006; 1761: 957-967Google Scholar).Further research into two aspects of PI signaling appears particularly promising. First, PI homeostasis and dynamic modulation require the tight spatiotemporal regulation of lipid kinases and phosphatases, which is largely unexplored. The second issue concerns analysis of downstream targets of PI signaling. Because cellular events that change [PI] usually involve other signaling pathways, defining the role of PIs is often not straightforward.Both aspects of PI-related cell biology should benefit from methods for isoform-specific alteration of [PI]. Rapid and reversible manipulation of [PI] is particularly important because effects of long-term alteration of PI levels by overexpression or knockdown of PI-converting enzymes (e.g. Refs. 4Weixel K.M. Edinger R.S. Kester L. Guerriero C.J. Wang H. Fang L. Kleyman T.R. Welling P.A. Weisz O.A. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 36534-36542Google Scholar and 5Brown F.D. Rozelle A.L. Yin H.L. Balla T. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol.. 2001; 154: 1007-1018Google Scholar) may be difficult to interpret. Thus, effects may be ambiguous because of different PI-dependent processes occurring on multiple time scales. Furthermore, homeostatic mechanisms and toxicity of long-term PI changes may limit the manipulations that can be utilized experimentally. So far, manipulation of PI levels remained difficult.Recently, an elegant approach for rapid disturbance of [PI] was developed based on chemically induced recruitment of PI-converting enzymes to the plasma membrane (6Varnai P. Thyagarajan B. Rohacs T. Balla T. J. Cell Biol.. 2006; 175: 377-382Google Scholar, 7Suh B.-C. Inoue T. Meyer T. Hille B. Science.. 2006; 314: 1454-1457Google Scholar). Although being extremely powerful for the identification of PI-dependent processes, a disadvantage of this method may be the inherently irreversible change in [PI].A potentially ideal molecular tool for rapid disturbance of [PI] was described recently (8Murata Y. Iwasaki H. Sasaki M. Inaba K. Okamura Y. Nature.. 2005; 435: 1239-1243Google Scholar): Ci-VSP is a homolog of the PI(3,4,5)P3 phosphatase PTEN that contains an N-terminal transmembrane voltage sensor domain (VSD). In vitro, the catalytic domain shows PI(3,4,5)P3 phosphatase activity, and experiments in Xenopus oocytes indicated that enzymatic activity is controlled by membrane voltage through the VSD (8Murata Y. Iwasaki H. Sasaki M. Inaba K. Okamura Y. Nature.. 2005; 435: 1239-1243Google Scholar). Enzymatic breakdown of both PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 by Ci-VSP upon depolarization has been suggested (9Murata Y. Okamura Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.).. 2007; 583: 875-889Google Scholar). For use as an analytical tool, it is essential to understand the exact enzymatic activity because any PI isoform affected by Ci-VSP may have its own cellular signaling role. So far, this issue has not been addressed, and stereospecificity is unknown.We monitored the concentrations of possible substrates and products of Ci-VSP with fluorescently labeled PI probes by imaging changes in their membrane association with total internal reflection (TIRF) microscopy. Our data indicate that in vivo, Ci-VSP is a depolarization-activated PI 5′-phosphatase that converts PI(4,5)P2 to PI(4)P and PI(3,4,5)P3 to PI(3,4)P2.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfection—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were plated onto glass bottom dishes (WillCo Wells B. V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and transfected with jetPEI transfection reagent (Polyplus Transfection, Illkirch, France). Detailed information on all vector constructs used is given in supplemental Table I. All experiments involving Ci-VSP reported here were done on cells selected for membrane localization of mRFP-Ci-VSP and corresponding gating currents.Fluorescence Microscopy—TIRF imaging was done with a BX51WI upright microscope (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany) equipped with a TIRF condenser (numerical aperture of 1.45; Olympus) and a 488 nm laser (20 milliwatts; Picarro, Sunnyvale, CA). Fluorescence was imaged through a LUMPlanFI/IR 40×/0.8-numerical aperture water immersion objective (Olympus). Images were acquired with an IMAGO-QE cooled CCD camera (TILL Photonics GmbH, Gräfelfing, Germany). Wide-field fluorescence illumination was achieved with a monochromator (Polychrome IV, TILL Photonics GmbH) coupled to the BX51WI microscope through fiber optics. GFP and RFP fluorescence was excited at 488 and 569 nm, respectively, and YFP at 510 nm. The laser shutter for TIRF illumination, the monochromatic light source, and image acquisition were controlled by TILLvisION software (TILL Photonics GmbH). The sample interval for image acquisition was 3 s. Confocal visualization of the membrane localization of mRFP-Ci-VSP was done on a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope.Electrophysiology—Cells were whole cell voltage-clamped with an EPC-10 amplifier controlled by PatchMaster software (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany). For measuring gating currents, linear leak and capacitance were subtracted using a P/–10 protocol (leak holding potential of –60 mV). To synchronize electrophysiological and optical measurements, the EPC-10 amplifier was triggered from the TILL imaging system. Patch pipettes were pulled from quartz glass to an open pipette resistance of 1.5–4.0 megaohms when filled with intracellular solution containing 135 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2.41 mm CaCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm HEPES, and 3 mm Na2ATP, pH 7.3 (with KOH). In some experiments, ATP was replaced with AMP-PCP, or ATP was omitted. In the latter case, the MgCl2 concentration was adapted to keep the free Mg2+ concentration constant. The extracellular solution contained 144 mm NaCl, 5.8 mm KCl, 0.7 mm NaH2PO4, 5.6 mm glucose, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 0.9 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (with NaOH). Experiments were performed at room temperature (≈24 °C).Data Analysis and Statistics—Data were analyzed using TILLvisION and IGOR Pro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Regions of interest that encompassed most of the footprint of a single cell were defined. The margins of the cell were excluded from analysis to avoid any artifacts resulting from cellular movements.F/F0 traces were calculated from the TIRF signal intensity (F), averaged over the region of interest, and the initial fluorescence intensity (F0). Fluorescence intensities were background-corrected. Steady-state fluorescence-voltage relations were fitted with the Boltzmann function: y = ymin + (ymax – ymin)/(1 + exp((V – V½)/s)), where y denotes the measured TIRF intensity, V is the membrane voltage, V½ is the voltage at half-maximal response, and s describes the steepness of the curve. Data were normalized to ymax – ymin for each cell such that the maximum change in F/F0 became 1. Time constants were obtained from monoexponential fits. All data are given as the means ± S.E.RESULTSDegradation of PI(4,5)P2 by Ci-VSP in Living Mammalian Cells—To analyze the enzymatic activity of Ci-VSP in vivo, we transfected mRFP-tagged Ci-VSP into CHO cells. Localization of RFP indicated effective targeting of Ci-VSP to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1A). In voltage-clamped RFP-positive CHO cells, voltage steps induced gating currents (Fig. 1B) similar to the currents generated by the VSD of Ci-VSP in Xenopus oocytes (8Murata Y. Iwasaki H. Sasaki M. Inaba K. Okamura Y. Nature.. 2005; 435: 1239-1243Google Scholar, 9Murata Y. Okamura Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.).. 2007; 583: 875-889Google Scholar). The gating currents thus indicated a functional VSD in our expression system.The effect of Ci-VSP on membrane [PI] was assessed by measuring membrane association of genetically encoded GFP-tagged PI-binding domains (3Varnai P. Balla T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2006; 1761: 957-967Google Scholar). Briefly, the fraction of membrane-bound probe depends on the particular [PI] such that an increase in [PI] leads to translocation from the cytosol to the cell membrane, whereas a decrease induces dissociation from the membrane. We monitored changes in membrane association of PI probes using TIRF microscopy. In this technique, an evanescent field originating at the interface between glass and aqueous solution decays exponentially into the cytoplasm (length constant of <100 nm) and selectively excites fluorophores at the cell membrane attached to the glass substrate. Thus, fluorescence emission reports the amount of membrane-bound fluorophores with only a minor contribution from cytosolic fluorophores, and changes in fluorescence intensity directly reflect dynamics of [PI]. Cells under observation were patch-clamped, enabling activation of Ci-VSP with voltage steps.We first examined the impact of Ci-VSP on the concentration of its proposed substrate, PI(4,5)P2, using the PI(4,5)P2-specific probe PLCδ1-PH-GFP (10Varnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol.. 1998; 143: 501-510Google Scholar, 11Stauffer T.P. Ahn S. Meyer T. Curr. Biol.. 1998; 8: 343-346Google Scholar). Upon depolarization, membrane fluorescence declined (Fig. 1, C and D), indicating dissociation of the probe from the membrane due to depletion of PI(4,5)P2. Upon repolarization, fluorescence recovered, indicating that [PI(4,5)P2] returned to the initial concentration. In contrast, depolarization failed to affect membrane fluorescence when PLCδ1-PH-GFP was monitored in the absence of Ci-VSP or when Ci-VSP was coexpressed with constitutively membrane-anchored Lyn-GFP (Fig. 1D) (12Haugh J.M. Codazzi F. Teruel M. Meyer T. J. Cell Biol.. 2000; 151: 1269-1280Google Scholar). These control experiments confirmed that TIRF signals reported Ci-VSP-dependent changes in plasma membrane [PI(4,5)P2]. These changes resulted from enzymatic activity intrinsic to the molecule's cytoplasmic phosphatase domain because mutation of a cysteine (C363S) in the catalytic CX5R motif common to all homologous lipid phosphatases (8Murata Y. Iwasaki H. Sasaki M. Inaba K. Okamura Y. Nature.. 2005; 435: 1239-1243Google Scholar, 13Maehama T. Taylor G.S. Dixon J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem.. 2001; 70: 247-279Google Scholar) completely abolished voltage-dependent changes in membrane fluorescence (Fig. 1E).As an additional test for the reliability of our approach, we measured signals from PLCδ1-PH-GFP in response to activation of the Gq-coupled muscarinic M1 acetylcholine receptor. Activation of the M1 acetylcholine receptor displaces PLCδ1-PH-GFP from the membrane due to depletion of PI(4,5)P2 and generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (14Bartlett P.J. Young K.W. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 21837-21846Google Scholar, 15Horowitz L.F. Hirdes W. Suh B.-C. Hilgemann D.W. Mackie K. Hille B. J. Gen. Physiol.. 2005; 126: 243-262Google Scholar). Indeed, application of a muscarinic agonist induced a robust decrease in TIRF, validating our experimental approach (supplemental Fig. 1).PI-binding domains may often not be perfectly PI isoform-specific (16Kavran J.M. Klein D.E. Lee A. Falasca M. Isakoff S.J. Skolnik E.Y. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem.. 1998; 273: 30497-30508Google Scholar). To scrutinize the conclusion that Ci-VSP-induced changes in membrane association of PLCδ1-PH reported actual changes in [PI(4,5)P2], we used the C terminus of the tubby protein, a structurally unrelated PI(4,5)P2-binding domain (17Santagata S. Boggon T.J. Baird C.L. Gomez C.A. Zhao J. Shan W.S. Myszka D.G. Shapiro L. Science.. 2001; 292: 2041-2050Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, depolarization of cells coexpressing tubby-GFP and Ci-VSP induced strong and reversible reduction of membrane fluorescence, confirming the consumption of PI(4,5)P2 by Ci-VSP.To characterize the voltage dependence of Ci-VSP enzymatic activity, PLCδ1-PH TIRF signals were recorded at different potentials (Fig. 2). The reduction of membrane fluorescence and thus the degree of PI(4,5)P2 breakdown increased with more depolarized potentials. Fitting the fluorescence-voltage relation with a Boltzmann function yielded half-maximal fluorescence loss at +40.2 ± 3.5 mV and steepness (s) of 17.9 ± 1.7 mV, similar to the voltage dependence of the VSD derived from gating currents (8Murata Y. Iwasaki H. Sasaki M. Inaba K. Okamura Y. Nature.. 2005; 435: 1239-1243Google Scholar). Thus, these results are consistent with a previously proposed model of Ci-VSP, where depolarization acts on the membrane-spanning VSD and thereby activates the PI(4,5)P2-degrading enzymatic activity of the cytoplasmic domain (9Murata Y. Okamura Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.).. 2007; 583: 875-889Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Voltage dependence of PI(4,5)P2 depletion. A, relative TIRF intensity in response to step depolarization to voltages between –40 and 100 mV measured from a cell coexpressing mRFP-Ci-VSP and PLCδ1-PH-GFP. The largest decrease in fluorescence corresponds to the strongest depolarization. B, steady-state fluorescence-voltage relations obtained from experiments as in A. Cells coexpressed mRFP-Ci-VSP and either PLCδ1-PH-GFP (black; n = 7 cells) or tubby-GFP (gray; n = 11). Fluorescence was measured at the end of each voltage pulse. Data were normalized as described under”Experimental Procedures.“The continuous curve is a Boltzmann fit to the averaged data.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Interestingly, voltage-dependent dissociation of the PI(4,5)P2 probe tubby-Cterm occurred at less depolarized potentials (V½ = –4.6 ± 2.9 mV, s = 12.1 ± 0.9 mV) (Fig. 2B). This indicated that unbinding of tubby-Cterm occurred at less complete depletion of PI(4,5)P2 and suggested a lower binding affinity compared with PLCδ1-PH.Voltage Activation of Ci-VSP Generates Excess PI(4)P—It was suggested that degradation of PI(4,5)P2 results from phosphatase activity of Ci-VSP (9Murata Y. Okamura Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.).. 2007; 583: 875-889Google Scholar). However, dephosphorylation has not been shown directly, and it is unknown whether the 4′-or 5′-phosphate is cleaved.To identify the exact enzymatic reaction, we sought to measure concentration changes in the putative product of PI(4,5)P2 dephosphorylation using PI(4)P-specific OSBP-PH (18Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol.. 2002; 12: 695-704Google Scholar, 19Balla A. Tuymetova G. Tsiomenko A. Varnai P. Balla T. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2005; 16: 1282-1295Google Scholar). In cells that coexpressed Ci-VSP and OSBP-PH-GFP, membrane fluorescence increased when the cells were depolarized, indicating generation of PI(4)P upon activation of Ci-VSP. Upon repolarization to –60 mV, membrane fluorescence and thus [PI(4)P] returned to basal levels (Fig. 3A). When OSBP-PH was monitored in the absence of Ci-VSP, voltage had no effect on the TIRF signal (data not shown).FIGURE 3OSBP-PH-GFP reports the generation of PI(4)P by activation of Ci-VSP. A, relative TIRF intensity of a cell coexpressing OSBP-PH-GFP and mRFP-Ci-VSP. The cell was held at –60 mV and depolarized to potentials between –40 and 100 mV in 20-mV steps. B, normalized steady-state fluorescence-voltage relations obtained from five experiments as in A. The continuous curve is a Boltzmann fit to the averaged data.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Similar to PI(4,5)P2 degradation, elevation of [PI(4)P] as deduced from changes in OSBP-PH-GFP fluorescence was more pronounced at stronger depolarization (Fig. 3, A and B). The fluorescence-voltage relation was characterized by a V½ of +11.0 ± 13.3 mV and a steepness (s) of 20.7 ± 2.3 mV, similar to the voltage dependence of PI(4,5)P2 degradation by Ci-VSP. The moderate difference in the voltage dependence of PLCδ1-PH most likely reflects distinct affinities of both PI probes for their respective lipid ligands (9Murata Y. Okamura Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.).. 2007; 583: 875-889Google Scholar). Thus, the findings are consistent with synchronous and quantitatively reciprocal changes in both PI isoforms, suggesting that Ci-VSP acts as a PI(4,5)P2 phosphatase at the 5′-position and thereby generates PI(4)P.Recovery of PI(4,5)P2 and PI(4)P Levels Depends on PI Kinase Activity—Given that Ci-VSP dephosphorylates PI(4,5)P2 to PI(4)P, the observed recovery of [PI(4,5)P2] upon repolarization may result from rephosphorylation of PI(4)P. Recovery would then report the activity of endogenous PI(4)P 5-kinase (PIP5K) converting PI(4)P to PI(4,5)P2. In contrast, if PI(4,5)P2 depletion by Ci-VSP resulted from a different enzymatic activity (i.e. Ci-VSP acting as a kinase or lipase), replenishment of PI(4,5)P2 would depend on phosphatase activity or require resynthesis of PI(4,5)P2 from phosphatidylinositol, respectively. The latter involves sequential activity of PI 4-kinases and PIP5Ks, as examined in detail for refilling of PI(4,5)P2 pools after depletion by PLC (20Suh B.-C. Horowitz L.F. Hirdes W. Mackie K. Hille B. J. Gen. Physiol.. 2004; 123: 663-683Google Scholar, 21Suh B.-C. Hille B. Neuron.. 2002; 35: 507-520Google Scholar).We thus sought to examine the role of PI kinases in the recovery of [PI(4,5)P2] after activation of Ci-VSP. Unfortunately, specific PIP5K inhibitors are not available (21Suh B.-C. Hille B. Neuron.. 2002; 35: 507-520Google Scholar, 22Balla T. Curr. Pharm. Des.. 2001; 7: 475-507Google Scholar). Therefore, we first tested for an involvement of PI 4-kinases using the PI 4-kinase inhibitor phenylarsine oxide (PAO; 30 μm) (23Balla A. Balla T. Trends Cell Biol.. 2006; 16: 351-361Google Scholar). PAO efficiently inhibits PI(4,5)P2 recovery after depletion by PLC (supplemental Fig. 2) (21Suh B.-C. Hille B. Neuron.. 2002; 35: 507-520Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 (A and C), replenishment of PI(4,5)P2 in the presence of PAO was not different compared with controls (p = 0.83). Similarly, the time course of recovery was not affected (p = 0.66) (Fig. 4C). This result shows that PAO-sensitive PI 4-kinases are not involved and that resynthesis from phosphatidylinositol does not play a major role in the recovery of PI(4,5)P2 upon termination of Ci-VSP activity.FIGURE 4Involvement of lipid kinases in the recovery of PI(4,5)P2 and PI(4)P levels. A, Ci-VSP-induced depletion and recovery of PI(4,5)P2 concentrations in the presence of the PI 4-kinase inhibitor PAO, measured as PLCδ1-PH-GFP TIRF intensity (n = eight cells). Membrane potential was stepped from –40 to +80 mV as indicated. B, Ci-VSP-induced depletion and recovery of PI(4,5)P2 levels with 3 mm intracellular ATP (black bars), omission of ATP from the intracellular pipette solution (light gray bars), or replacement with AMP-PCP (dark gray bars). The voltage protocol was as described for A. C, summary of data from A and B showing that reduction of ATP to estimated micromolar levels interferes with replenishment of PI(4,5)P2, whereas AMP-PCP nearly completely blocks recovery. In contrast, PAO has no significant effect on the degree and time course of recovery. D and E, Ci-VSP-induced increase and recovery of PI(4)P concentration with 3 mm intracellular ATP (black) or omission of ATP from the intracellular solution (light gray). The voltage protocol was as described for A. Recovery of PI(4)P was slowed and incomplete in the absence of ATP. The sampling interval for fluorescence recordings was 3 s in all experiments. * and ** indicate p values from Dunnett's test (C, comparison with ATP group) or Student's t test (E) of <0.05 and <0.01, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further probe for the involvement of PIP5Ks, we measured PI(4,5)P2 and PI(4)P dynamics after removal of intracellular ATP and in the presence of a competitive kinase inhibitor. Thus, ATP was omitted from the pipette solution or replaced with its non-hydrolyzable analog AMP-PCP. Experiments were done 5 min after patch rupture, sufficient for equilibration of a readily diffusible solute like ATP between the cytosol and the pipette (24Pusch M. Neher E. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol.. 1988; 411: 204-211Google Scholar). When the patch pipette contained no ATP, recovery of [PI(4,5)P2] as monitored by PLCδ1-PH-GFP was incomplete and slowed in comparison with control experiments with 3 mm ATP (Fig. 4, B and C). Upon replacement with AMP-PCP, replenishment of PI(4,5)P2 was essentially abolished. Moreover, depletion of PI(4,5)P2 upon depolarization was enhanced under both experimental conditions. Similarly, recovery of [PI(4)P] toward base-line levels measured with OSBP-PH-GFP was blunted and slowed in the absence of ATP (Fig. 4, D and E).These findings suggest that the synchronous increase in PI(4,5)P2 and decrease in PI(4)P upon switch off of Ci-VSP result from the rapid phosphorylation of PI(4)P to PI(4,5)P2 and thus implicate endogenous PIP5Ks. This conclusion further supports Ci-VSP acting as a PI(4,5)P2 5′-phosphatase.PI(3,4,5)P3 Phosphatase Activity of Ci-VSP—Because the isolated phosphatase (PTEN) homology domain of Ci-VSP shows PI(3,4,5)P3 phosphatase activity in vitro (8Murata Y. Iwasaki H. Sasaki M. Inaba K. Okamura Y. Nature.. 2005; 435: 1239-1243Google Scholar), we next investigated whether Ci-VSP is also capable to hydrolyze PI(3,4,5)P3 in the living cell. [PI(3,4,5)P3] was monitored as membrane association of the GFP-tagged PI(3,4,5)P3-binding probes ARNO-PH-GFP (25Klarlund J.K. Tsiaras W. Holik J.J. Chawla A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem.. 2000; 275: 32816-32821Google Scholar, 26Venkateswarlu K. Oatey P.B. Tavare J.M. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol.. 1998; 8: 463-466Google Scholar) and Btk-PH-GFP (27Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R. Margolis R.L. Gigg R. Smith C.I. Driscoll P.C. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. EMBO J.. 1996; 15: 6241-6250Google Scholar).Under resting conditions, the PI(3,4,5)P3 level of the plasma membrane is usually too low to detect membrane association of the PI(3,4,5)P3 probes (data not shown; see Ref. 28Tong Q. Gamper N. Medina J.L. Shapiro M.S. Stockand J.D. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 22654-22663Google Scholar). Therefore, we coexpressed a constitutively active mutant of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 110-kDa subunit (PI3K(K227E)) (29Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. EMBO J.. 1996; 15: 2442-2451Google Scholar), which induced robust membrane association of all PI(3,4,5)P3 probes, indicating increased basal [PI(3,4,5)P3]. For TIRF experiments, cells were selected that coexpressed mRFP-Ci-VSP, PI3K(K227E), and one of the GFP-labeled PI(3,4,5)P3 probes and that displayed clear membrane localization of GFP fluorescence. As a control, addition of the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (0.2 μm) resulted in the release of Btk-PH-GFP from the membrane (supplemental Fig. 3), indicating that TIRF is a useful indicator of [PI(3,4,5)P3].Upon depolarization, ARNO-PH-GFP and Btk-PH-GFP consistently dissociated from the membrane (Fig. 5A). This finding indicated degradation of PI(3,4,5)P3 by Ci-VSP, without revealing, however, the stereospecificity of dephosphorylation. Accordingly, mutation of the conserved cysteine in the CX5R motif of the cytoplasmic phosphatase domain (C363S) completely abolished dissociation of the PI(3,4,5)-binding domain Btk-PH-GFP (Fig. 5B).FIGURE 5Redistribution of Akt1-PH, ARNO-PH, Btk-PH, and TAPP1-PH caused by Ci-VSP activity reports depletion of PI(3,4,5)P3 and generation of PI(3,4)P2. A, cells coexpressing mRFP-Ci-VSP, PI3K(K227E), and one of the PI(3,4,5)P3-binding PH domains indicated were subjected to the depolarizing voltage step indicated. Membrane association of Btk-PH-GFP (black; relative change of –0.34 ± 0.07; n = six cells) and ARNO-PH (gray; relative change of –0.15 ± 0.03; n = six cells) decreased upon activation of Ci-VSP. B, mutation of the catalytic motif of Ci-VSP, C363S, abolished depolarization-induced changes in PI(3,4,5)P3 (n = four cells coexpressing mRFP-Ci-VSP(C363S), PI3K(K227E), and Btk-PH-GFP). Data from wild-type (wt) Ci-VSP are replotted from A for comparison. C, the experiment was performed as described for A and B with the PI(3,4,5)P3/PI(3,4)P2 binding-specific Akt1-PH-GFP and the PI(3,4)P2-specific TAPP1-PH-YFP probes. On average, Akt1-PH-GFP displayed an increase in membrane association (n = 21) upon activation of Ci-VSP by depolarization. TAPP1-PH showed a strong increase in membrane association (relative change of +0.68 ± 0.21; n = 6), indicating the generation of PI(3,4)P2. The Btk-PH-GFP trace is replotted from A for comparison.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT"

The addition of rotenone to HL180 cells and of antimycin A to XTC.UC1 cells caused fast mitochondrial membrane depolarization that was prevented by treatment with cyclosporin A, intracellular Ca2+ chelators, and antioxidant. Both cell lines also displayed an anomalous response to oligomycin, with rapid onset of depolarization that was prevented by cyclosporin A and by overexpression of Bcl-2. These findings indicate that depolarization by respiratory chain inhibitors and oligomycin was due to opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP). A shift of the threshold voltage for PTP opening close to the resting potential may therefore be the underlying cause facilitating cell death in diseases affecting complex I activity. This study provides a unifying reading frame for previous observations on mitochondrial dysfunction, bioenergetic defects, and Ca2+ deregulation in mitochondrial diseases. Therapeutic strategies aimed at normalizing the PTP voltage threshold may be instrumental in ameliorating the course of complex I-dependent mitochondrial diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2094516424,"Xanthomonas is a large genus of plant-associated and plant-pathogenic bacteria. Collectively, members cause diseases on over 392 plant species. Individually, they exhibit marked host- and tissue-specificity. The determinants of this specificity are unknown.To assess potential contributions to host- and tissue-specificity, pathogenesis-associated gene clusters were compared across genomes of eight Xanthomonas strains representing vascular or non-vascular pathogens of rice, brassicas, pepper and tomato, and citrus. The gum cluster for extracellular polysaccharide is conserved except for gumN and sequences downstream. The xcs and xps clusters for type II secretion are conserved, except in the rice pathogens, in which xcs is missing. In the otherwise conserved hrp cluster, sequences flanking the core genes for type III secretion vary with respect to insertion sequence element and putative effector gene content. Variation at the rpf (regulation of pathogenicity factors) cluster is more pronounced, though genes with established functional relevance are conserved. A cluster for synthesis of lipopolysaccharide varies highly, suggesting multiple horizontal gene transfers and reassortments, but this variation does not correlate with host- or tissue-specificity. Phylogenetic trees based on amino acid alignments of gum, xps, xcs, hrp, and rpf cluster products generally reflect strain phylogeny. However, amino acid residues at four positions correlate with tissue specificity, revealing hpaA and xpsD as candidate determinants. Examination of genome sequences of xanthomonads Xylella fastidiosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia revealed that the hrp, gum, and xcs clusters are recent acquisitions in the Xanthomonas lineage.Our results provide insight into the ancestral Xanthomonas genome and indicate that differentiation with respect to host- and tissue-specificity involved not major modifications or wholesale exchange of clusters, but subtle changes in a small number of genes or in non-coding sequences, and/or differences outside the clusters, potentially among regulatory targets or secretory substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1983456864,"Macrophages provide an interface between innate and adaptive immunity and are important long-lived reservoirs for Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type-1 (HIV-1). Multiple genetic networks involved in regulating signal transduction cascades and immune responses in macrophages are coordinately modulated by HIV-1 infection.To evaluate complex interrelated processes and to assemble an integrated view of activated signaling networks, a systems biology strategy was applied to genomic and proteomic responses by primary human macrophages over the course of HIV-1 infection. Macrophage responses, including cell cycle, calcium, apoptosis, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), and cytokines/chemokines, to HIV-1 were temporally regulated, in the absence of cell proliferation. In contrast, Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways remained unaltered by HIV-1, although TLRs 3, 4, 7, and 8 were expressed and responded to ligand stimulation in macrophages. HIV-1 failed to activate phosphorylation of IRAK-1 or IRF-3, modulate intracellular protein levels of Mx1, an interferon-stimulated gene, or stimulate secretion of TNF, IL-1beta, or IL-6. Activation of pathways other than TLR was inadequate to stimulate, via cross-talk mechanisms through molecular hubs, the production of proinflammatory cytokines typical of a TLR response. HIV-1 sensitized macrophage responses to TLR ligands, and the magnitude of viral priming was related to virus replication.HIV-1 induced a primed, proinflammatory state, M1(HIV), which increased the responsiveness of macrophages to TLR ligands. HIV-1 might passively evade pattern recognition, actively inhibit or suppress recognition and signaling, or require dynamic interactions between macrophages and other cells, such as lymphocytes or endothelial cells. HIV-1 evasion of TLR recognition and simultaneous priming of macrophages may represent a strategy for viral survival, contribute to immune pathogenesis, and provide important targets for therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2038073466,"Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase. We have previously reported that Cdk5 participates in the regulation of nociceptive signaling, and the expression of Cdk5 and its activator, p35, are up-regulated in nociceptive neurons during peripheral inflammation. The aim of our current study was to identify the proinflammatory molecules that regulate Cdk5/p35 activity in response to inflammation. We constructed a vector that contains the mouse p35 promoter driving luciferase expression. We transiently transfected this vector in PC12 cells to test the effect of several cytokines on p35 transcriptional activity and Cdk5 activity. Our results indicate that tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) activates p35 promoter activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner and concomitantly up-regulates Cdk5 activity. Because TNF-α is known to activate ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, JNK, and NF-κB signaling pathways, we examined their involvement in the activation of p35 promoter activity. MEK inhibitor, which inhibits ERK activation, decreased p35 promoter activity, whereas the inhibitors of p38 MAPK, JNK, and NF-κB increased p35 promoter activity, indicating that these pathways regulate p35 expression differently. The mRNA and protein levels of Egr-1, a transcription factor, were increased by TNF-α treatment, and this increase was dependent on ERK signaling. In a mouse model of inflammation-induced pain in which carrageenan injection into the hind paw causes hypersensitivity to heat stimuli, TNF-α mRNA was increased at the site of injection.

Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2001; 2: 749-759Google Scholar). Cdk5 kinase activity is predominantly found in postmitotic neurons (2Tsai L.H. Delalle I. Caviness Jr., V.S. Chae T. Harlow E. Nature.. 1994; 371: 419-423Google Scholar, 3Lew J. Huang Q.Q. Qi Z. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H. Nature.. 1994; 371: 423-426Google Scholar), where its activators, p35 and p39, are predominantly expressed (2Tsai L.H. Delalle I. Caviness Jr., V.S. Chae T. Harlow E. Nature.. 1994; 371: 419-423Google Scholar, 3Lew J. Huang Q.Q. Qi Z. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H. Nature.. 1994; 371: 423-426Google Scholar, 4Humbert S. Lanier L.M. Tsai L.H. Neuroreport.. 2000; 11: 2213-2216Google Scholar). We reported earlier that cellular p35 level is the main limiting factor for the Cdk5 kinase activity (5Takahashi S. Ohshima T. Cho A. Sreenath T. Iadarola M.J. Pant H.C. Kim Y. Nairn A.C. Brady R.O. Greengard P. Kulkarni A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2005; 102: 1737-1742Google Scholar). Cdk5 phosphorylates a spectrum of proteins, most of them associated with cell morphology, synaptic activity, neuronal survival, and apoptosis (1Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2001; 2: 749-759Google Scholar, 6Dhariwala F.A. Rajadhyaksha M.S. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol.. 2008; 28: 351-369Google Scholar). A majority of known substrates of Cdk5 are cytoskeletal elements, signaling molecules, or regulatory proteins (6Dhariwala F.A. Rajadhyaksha M.S. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol.. 2008; 28: 351-369Google Scholar). Cdk5 is most abundant in the nervous system, and it appears to be indispensable for neural development and function (7Ohshima T. Ward J.M. Huh C.G. Longenecker G. Veeranna Pant H.C. Brady R.O. Martin L.J. Kulkarni A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1996; 93: 11173-11178Google Scholar). The deregulation of Cdk5 activity has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases of the mammalian nervous system (1Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2001; 2: 749-759Google Scholar, 6Dhariwala F.A. Rajadhyaksha M.S. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol.. 2008; 28: 351-369Google Scholar, 8Maccioni R.B. Otth C. Concha II Munoz J.P. Eur. J.

We have previously reported that Cdk5 activity participates in the regulation of nociceptive signaling (10Pareek T.K. Keller J. Kesavapany S. Pant H.C. Iadarola M.J. Brady R.O. Kulkarni A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2006; 103: 791-796Google Scholar). The expressions of Cdk5 and p35 as well as Cdk5 kinase activity are increased in nociceptive primary afferent neurons during peripheral inflammation. In p35 knock-out mice (p35-/-) responses to a nociceptive heat stimulus are attenuated, whereas in p35-overexpressing transgenic mice, these responses are potentiated, indicating an important role of Cdk5 in nociceptive process (10Pareek T.K. Keller J. Kesavapany S. Pant H.C. Iadarola M.J. Brady R.O. Kulkarni A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2006; 103: 791-796Google Scholar, 11Pareek T.K. Kulkarni A.B.

Tsai L.H. Ip N. Cyclin Dependent Kinase 5 (Cdk5). Springer, New York2008: 211-226Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated that Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) at threonine 407 can modulate agonist-induced calcium influx (14Pareek T.K. Keller J. Kesavapany S. Agarwal N. Kuner R. Pant H.C. Iadarola M.J. Brady R.O. Kulkarni A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2007; 104: 660-665Google Scholar). TRPV1, a ligand-gated cation channel highly expressed in small diameter sensory neurons, is activated by heat, protons, and capsaicin. The phosphorylation of TRPV1 provides a versatile regulation of intracellular calcium levels, critical for its function in responding to noxious stimuli (14Pareek T.K. Keller J. Kesavapany S. Agarwal N. Kuner R. Pant H.C. Iadarola M.J. Brady R.O. Kulkarni A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2007; 104: 660-665Google Scholar). Several cytokines are known to mediate chronic pain caused by inflammation or sensory nerve damage (15Myers R.R. Campana W.M. Shubayev V.I. Drug Discov. Today.. 2006; 11: 8-20Google Scholar). In animal models of inflammatory or neuropathic pain, the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) are elevated in the spinal cord and at the site of injury (16Schafers M. Sorkin L.S. Geis C. Shubayev V.I. Neurosci. Lett.. 2003; 347: 179-182Google Scholar, 17Arruda J.L. Colburn R.W. Rickman A.J. Rutkowski M.D. DeLeo J.A. Brain Res. Mol.

Cartmell T. Poole S. Mitchell D. J. Pain.. 2007; 8: 127-136Google Scholar). It has also been reported that the mRNA levels of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α were elevated in inflamed hind paw of rats injected with intraplantar carrageenan (20Yang H.Y. Mitchell K. Keller J.M. Iadarola M.J. J. Neurochem.. 2007; 103: 1628-1643Google Scholar). TNF-α is a pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by astrocytes, microglia, and neurons (21Cheng B. Chistakos S. Mattson M.P. Neuron.. 1994; 12: 139-153Google Scholar). TNF-α exerts its biological functions through the action of two main receptors, TNF receptors 1 and 2, and both are expressed in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) (20Yang H.Y. Mitchell K. Keller J.M. Iadarola M.J. J. Neurochem.. 2007; 103: 1628-1643Google Scholar). Through these receptors, TNF-α can induce activation of the NF-κB pathway (22Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol.. 2001; 11: 372-377Google Scholar) and MAPK pathways such as the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), p38 MAPK, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (23Barbin G. Roisin M.P. Zalc B. Neurochem. Res.. 2001; 26: 107-112Google Scholar). Because activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway has been implicated in the regulation of Cdk5 activity through induction of p35 protein expression (24Harada T. Morooka T. Ogawa S. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol.. 2001; 3: 453-459Google Scholar, 25Quintanilla R.A. Orellana D.I. Gonzalez-Billault C. Maccioni R.B. Exp. Cell Res.. 2004; 295: 245-257Google Scholar, 26Song J.H. Wang C.X. Song D.K. Wang P. Shuaib A. Hao C. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 12896-12901Google Scholar), we investigated the role of TNF-α in the regulation of Cdk5/p35 expression. In the present study, we demonstrate that p35 expression is increased through ERK1/2 and Egr-1 pathways. These findings suggest that during peripheral inflammation, TNF-α induces Cdk5 kinase activity by increasing the levels of p35, which can sensitize TRPV1-positive sensory neurons. Animals—Mice were maintained in a C57BL/6 × 129/SvJ hybrid background and were housed with a 12 h light/dark cycle and given water and food ad libitum. All of the animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. Inflammation was induced by injecting carrageenan Lambda type IV (Sigma). Carrageenan (4% in phosphate-buffered saline) was suspended by sonication in saline and injected subcutaneously in a volume of 25 μl into the left plantar hind paw by using an insulin syringe with a 28-gauge needle. Contralateral right hind paws served as the controls. The mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation at 24 h after carrageenan injection. The mid-central plantar portion of the hind paw, which included both skin and underlying muscle, was removed and processed for RNA extraction. DRG from lumbar region L4 and L5 were removed for RNA extraction. Materials—Mouse recombinant TNF-α, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OSM), IL-1β, interferon γ (IFN-γ), histone H1, SP600125, and α-tubulin antibody were obtained from Sigma. Human recombinant IL-6, PD98059, SB203580, and NF-κB inhibitor were obtained from Calbiochem, and rat recombinant β nerve growth factor was obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Protein quantification reagents were obtained from Bio-Rad, and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents for Western blot analysis were purchased from Thermo Scientific (Rockford, IL). Antibodies—Antibodies to Cdk5, p35, and Egr-1 and secondary antibodies (HP-conjugated goat anti-mouse, anti-rabbit antibodies) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to ERK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, phospho-p38 MAPK, JNK, phospho-JNK, NF-κB p65, and phospho-NF-κB p65 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Antibody to β-actin was obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Cell Culture—The PC12 cell line (derived from pheochromocytoma of rat adrenal medulla) and Neuro-2a cell line (derived from mouse neuroblastoma) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). PC12 and Neuro-2a cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum plus 5% horse serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT). Preparation of the p35 Promoter-Luciferase Reporter Plasmid—We constructed a p35 promoter-LUC vector by inserting a 1,219-bp mouse p35 promoter into the pGL3 enhancer luciferase vector from Promega (Madison, WI). Briefly, pBluescript II SK(-) p35 promoter vector (27Ohshima T. Kozak C.A. Nagle J.W. Pant H.C. Brady R.O. Kulkarni A.B. Genomics.. 1996; 35: 372-375Google Scholar) was digested with XbaI and XhoI, and a 1,219-bp fragment containing the p35 promoter was cloned between the NheI and XhoI sites of pGL3 enhanced vector. Transient Transfection and Reporter Activity Assays—One hour before transfection, medium with serum was replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Transfection of the reporter plasmid into PC12 cells was done using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Five hundred nanograms (ng) of p35 promoter-LUC and 250 ng of control vector Renilla luciferase expressed under the constitutive promoter of thymidine kinase (RL-TK; Promega, Madison, WI) were cotransfected into ∼4 × 104 cells. After the transfection, the cells were treated with either IL-6 (50 ng/ml), LIF (50 ng/ml), OSM (100 ng/ml), IL-1β (10 ng/ml), INF-γ (100 ng/ml), or TNF-α (50 ng/ml) for 24 h. The proteins were extracted from the treated cells, and the luciferase activity was measured with a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI), and the results were presented as the relative p35 promoter activity, which was calculated by dividing the mean value of p35 promoter luciferase activity by the mean value of Renilla luciferase activity. In the second set of experiments, we treated PC12 cells with inhibitors of MAPKs (PD98059, SB203580, and SP600125) or NF-κB inhibitor prior to TNF-α treatment and measured luciferase activity 24 h after. RNA Isolation and Real Time PCR—PC12 cells were grown in 60-mm culture dishes and were incubated for 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 15, or 24 h in serum-free medium with TNF-α (25 ng/ml). After discarding growth medium, total RNA was isolated from the cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following TURBO DNA-free (Ambion, Austin, TX) digestion of total RNA sample, to remove contaminated genomic DNA, oligo(dT) primed synthesis of cDNA from 1 μg of total RNA was made using Super-Script™ III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). For detection of TNF-α mRNA, PCR was performed using the following primers: TNF-α sense (S): 5′-GAT CTC AAA GAC AAC CCA ACT AGT-3′ and TNF-α antisense (AS) 5′-CTC CAG CTG GAA GAC TCC TCC CAG-3′. The PCR consisted of 35 cycles of 30 s each at 94 °C, 60 °C, and 72 °C. For detection of Egr-1, p35, and Cdk5 mRNA we used real time PCR, and the following reaction mixture was used for these PCR samples: 1xIQ™ Sybr®Green Super Mix (Bio-Rad), 100–200 nm of each primer and 1 μl of cDNA. cDNA was amplified and analyzed in triplicate using Opticon Monitor Chromo 4 (Bio-Rad). The following primers were used to amplify and measure the amount of mouse mRNA by real time reverse transcription-PCR: Egr-1 S: 5′-CCC TTC CAG GGT CTG GAG AAC CGT-3′, Egr-1 AS: 5′-GGG GTA CTT GCG CAT GCG GCT GGG-3′, p35 S: 5′-GCC CTT CCT GGT AGA GAG CTG-3′, p35 AS: 5′-GTG TGA AAT AGT GTG GGT CGG C-3′, Cdk5 S: 5′-GGC TAA AAA CCG GGA AAC TC-3′ and Cdk5 AS: 5′-CCA TTG CAG CTG TCG AAA TA-3′ (28Hawasli A.H. Benavides D.R. Nguyen C. Kansy J.W. Hayashi K. Chambon P. Greengard P. Powell C.M. Cooper D.C. Bibb J.A. Nat. Neurosci.. 2007; 10: 880-886Google Scholar). mRNA levels were standardized by using the following primers to GAPDH: GAPDH S: 5′-AAT GTG TCC GTC GTG GAT CTG A-3′ and GAPDH AS: 5′-GAT GCC TGC TTC ACC ACC TTC T-3′. RNA Interference Analysis—A chemically synthesized siGENOME set of four duplex of small interference RNA (siRNA) for rat Egr-1 was obtained from Dharmacon, Inc. (Chicago, IL). The pool contained four RNA duplexes, and their sequences are as follows: 5′-UAA AGG CUC UUA AUA ACA C-3′;5′-CGA CAG CAG UCC CAU UUA C-3′;5′-UGA CAU CGC UCU GAA UAA C-3′; and 5′-CGA AUC UGC AUG CGU AAU U-3′. Both negative and positive GAPDH siRNA duplexes were also included in the assay (Dharmacon, Inc., Chicago, IL). Delivery of siRNAs into PC12 cells was accomplished using Dharmafect1 reagent (Dharmacon, Inc). Using a siRNA-negative control coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate, we determined by fluorescence a transfection efficiency of 65 ± 8% (means ± S.D.). As a positive control we used GAPDH siRNA. This protocol knocked down GAPDH expression at both mRNA and protein levels. At 20 h after transfection with Egr1 siRNA duplexes at concentration of 100 nm each siRNA, the cultures were treated with either 100 ng/ml TNF-α or distilled water for 1, 3, and 6 h. The cells were then used for extraction of total RNA, and analysis of mRNA expression for Egr1 and p35 by real time PCR were conducted as described above. Immunoblot Analysis—Tissue homogenates were lysed in T-PER buffer (Pierce) with protease inhibitor mixture tablets and phosphatase inhibitor mixture tablets PhosSTOP (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by using Bradford Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). The proteins were separated by 4–12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). The membranes were soaked in a blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate primary antibody diluted in the blocking buffer. The membranes were washed in PBST and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer. Immunoreactivity was detected by SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific). The membranes were stripped for 15 min at room temperature with Re-blot Plus Strong Solution (Chemicon) and retested with α-tubulin or β-actin antibodies to normalize for protein loading. The optical densities of the bands were quantified by using an image analysis system with Scion Image Alpha 4.0.3.2 software (Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD). Cdk5 Kinase Activity Assay—Cdk5 kinase activity was measured as described (10Pareek T.K. Keller J. Kesavapany S. Pant H.C. Iadarola M.J. Brady R.O. Kulkarni A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2006; 103: 791-796Google Scholar). In brief, 150 μg of protein from PC12 or neuro-2a cells was dissolved in T-PER buffer and immunoprecipitated with anti-Cdk5 antibody (5 μg). Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μm NaF, and 1 μm Na2VO3) and mixed with kinase assay mixture (100 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 50 μm NaF, 5 μm Na2VO3, and 5 mm dithiothreitol), and Histone H1 (1 μg/μl) as a substrate, and the kinase activity was quantified as described (10Pareek T.K. Keller J. Kesavapany S. Pant H.C. Iadarola M.J. Brady R.O. Kulkarni A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2006; 103: 791-796Google Scholar). Hargreaves Test—Radiant heat from a focused projector lamp was used to measure basal sensitivity to noxious thermal stimulation. Each mouse was placed in an individual glass chamber (12.5 × 12.5 × 12.5 cm) with transparent outer walls to allow for experimental observation and a 3/16-inch-thick (1 inch = 2.54 cm) glass floor. The mice were acclimated for at least 1 h before testing. The stimulus was a high intensity beam (750 mA) from a projector lamp bulb aimed at the plantar surface of the mid-hind paw of a mouse after habituation. Paw withdrawal latency was tested to the nearest 0.1 s, and each mouse was tested until the 15-s cut-off was reached. Statistical Analysis—All of the experiments were performed a minimum of three times. Statistical evaluation was done with GraphPad Prism software, version 4.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Significant differences between experiments were assessed by univariate ANOVA (more than two groups) or unpaired t test (two groups). ANOVA was followed by a t test using a Bonferroni α-correction for multiple comparisons, where α was set to 0.05. TNF-α Regulates p35 Promoter Activity—Because the level of p35 expression is the main limiting factor for Cdk5 activity (5Takahashi S. Ohshima T. Cho A. Sreenath T. Iadarola M.J. Pant H.C. Kim Y. Nairn A.C. Brady R.O. Greengard P. Kulkarni A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2005; 102: 1737-1742Google Scholar), we developed a cell-based assay to screen proinflammatory molecules for their effects on p35 promoter activity. In brief, we constructed a p35 promoter-LUC vector by cloning a 1,219-bp fragment of mouse p35 promoter (27Ohshima T. Kozak C.A. Nagle J.W. Pant H.C. Brady R.O. Kulkarni A.B. Genomics.. 1996; 35: 372-375Google Scholar) into luciferase pGL3 enhancer vector (Fig. 1A). We used the rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line for this study because several groups have reported that it expresses receptors for a variety of cytokines (29Marz P. Gadient R.A. Otten U. Brain Res.. 1996; 706: 71-79Google Scholar, 30Cheshire J.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 1997; 17: 6746-6754Google Scholar, 31Mielke K. Herdegen T. Mol. Cell. Neurosci.. 2002; 20: 211-224Google Scholar, 32Shu H.F. Wang B.R. Bi H. Pei J.M. Wang X. Fan J. Ju G. Respir. Physiol. Neurobiol.. 2007; 157: 187-195Google Scholar). PC12 cells, transiently cotransfected with p35 promoter-LUC vector and RL-TK vector (control for transfection efficiency), were treated with indicated cytokine for 24 h, and then luciferase activity was measured. We found that of the cytokines tested, TNF-α significantly increased p35 promoter activity (Fig. 1B). TNF-α (50 ng/ml) treatment resulted in an 80% increase in the luciferase activity, whereas other cytokines did not enhance the activity. IL-6, LIF, and OSM treatment resulted in a slight inhibition of p35 promoter activity (Fig. 1B). Treatment with IFN-γ or IL-1β did not have any obvious effect on p35 promoter activity (Fig. 1B). Subsequently, we analyzed the effect of different concentrations of TNF-α over p35 promoter activity and found that TNF-α increased p35 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). TNF-α treatment increased p35 promoter activity at a concentration of 5 ng/ml followed by a linear increase with higher concentrations up to 100 ng/ml. At a concentration of 100 ng/ml, p35 promoter activity increased by 150% as compared with the control. Next, we analyzed the time course of the TNF-α-mediated increase of p35 promoter activity. Transiently transfected PC12 cells treated with TNF-α (25 ng/ml) showed a time-dependent with increase in p35 promoter activity (Fig. 1D). TNF-α treatment significantly increased p35 promoter activity beginning at 6 h and reached a peak at 24 h. Together, these results indicated that TNF-α treatment strongly induced p35 promoter activity in PC12 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. TNF-α Treatment Significantly Increases p35 Expression in PC12 Cells—To further confirm that TNF-α activates p35 promoter activity, we examined endogenous levels of p35 mRNA and protein at different time points during treatment with TNF-α. The level of p35 mRNA increased significantly within 3 h after TNF-α treatment and remained elevated until 24 h (Fig. 2A). Subsequently, p35 protein levels increased significantly at 12 and 24 h following TNF-α treatment (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, Cdk5 mRNA and protein levels did not change significantly following TNF-α treatment (data not shown). TNF-α Treatment Increases Cdk5 Activity in PC12 Cells—Because p35 protein levels regulate Cdk5 kinase activity (5Takahashi S. Ohshima T. Cho A. Sreenath T. Iadarola M.J. Pant H.C. Kim Y. Nairn A.C. Brady R.O. Greengard P. Kulkarni A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2005; 102: 1737-1742Google Scholar), we analyzed whether the TNF-α-mediated increase in p35 expression results in increased Cdk5 activity. We immunoprecipitated Cdk5 protein from control or TNF-α-treated cells and then assayed kinase activity by using histone H1 as a substrate (10Pareek T.K. Keller J. Kesavapany S. Pant H.C. Iadarola M.J. Brady R.O. Kulkarni A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2006; 103: 791-796Google Scholar). In control cells, Cdk5 kinase activity decreased slightly after serum deprivation (Fig. 3A, left panel). In contrast, TNF-α-treated cells showed an increased Cdk5 kinase activity (Fig. 3A, right panel). Cdk5 activity increased as early as 1 h after TNF-α treatment and peaked at 24 h (Fig. 3B). We also found that Cdk5 activity increased in the Neuro-2a cell line after TNF-α treatment (data not shown). Together, these results indicated that TNF-α-induced expression of p35 resulted in increased Cdk5 kinase activity. TNF-α-mediated Activation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, JNK, and NF-κB Signaling Pathways Differentially Regulates p35 Promoter Activity—TNF-α is known to activate MAPK pathways, such as ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, JNK, and NF-κB pathways (22Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol.. 2001; 11: 372-377Google Scholar, 23Barbin G. Roisin M.P. Zalc B. Neurochem. Res.. 2001; 26: 107-112Google Scholar, 33Takahashi N. Kikuchi S. Shubayev V.I. Campana W.M. Myers R.R. Spine.. 2006; 31: 523-529Google Scholar). We examined the influence of these pathways on TNF-α-mediated activation of p35 promoter activity. By Western blot analysis, we observed a rapid activation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, JNK, and NF-κB p65 pathways within 5–10 min following TNF-α treatment of PC12 cells (Fig. 4). The activation of ERK1/2 was sustained, whereas the activation of p38 MAPK, JNK, and NF-κB p65 was transient. As reported earlier (24Harada T. Morooka T. Ogawa S. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol.. 2001; 3: 453-459Google Scholar) we also found that nerve growth factor activated these pathways in PC12 cells (data not shown). To confirm this further, prior to TNF-α treatment we tested inhibitors of these pathways in the PC12 cells. We tested MEK inhibitor PD98059, an upstream regulator of ERK1/2 (34Pang L. Sawada T.

Next, we assayed the effects of different concentrations of MAPK inhibitors and the NF-κB inhibitor on p35 promoter activity in the presence or absence of TNF-α in PC12 cells transiently transfected with p35-LUC and RL-TK vectors. MEK inhibitor PD98059 decreased basal p35 promoter activity significantly at 30 and 60 μm (Fig. 5A, left panel) in the absence of TNF-α. In the presence of PD98059 (30 μm) plus TNF-α (50 ng/ml), we observed an 85% reduction in p35 promoter activity as compared with TNF-α treatment alone (Fig. 5A, right panel). This indicated that ERK1/2 positively regulated p35 promoter activity.

However, little is known about the selectivity of the mammalian 14-3-3 isoforms with respect to RAF association and activation. Using mass spectrometry, we analyzed the composition of the 14-3-3 isoforms attached to RAF kinases and found that B-RAF associates in vivo with 14-3-3 at much higher diversity than A- and C-RAF. We also examined in vitro binding of purified mammalian 14-3-3 proteins to RAF kinases using surface plasmon resonance techniques. While B- and C-RAF exhibited binding to all seven 14-3-3 isoforms, A-RAF bound with considerably lower affinities to ϵ, τ, and σ 14-3-3. These findings indicate that 14-3-3 proteins associate with RAF isoforms in a pronounced isoform-specific manner. Because 14-3-3 proteins appear in dimeric forms, we addressed the question of whether both homo- and heterodimeric forms of 14-3-3 proteins participate in RAF signaling. For that purpose, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, possessing only two 14-3-3 isoforms (BMH1 and BMH2), served as testing system. By deletion of the single BMH2 gene, we found that both homo- and heterodimeric forms of 14-3-3 can participate in RAF activation. Furthermore, we show that A-, B-, and C-RAF activity is differentially regulated by its C-terminal and internal 14-3-3 binding domain. Finally, prohibitin, a scaffold protein that affects C-RAF activation in a stimulatory manner, proved to interfere with the internal 14-3-3 binding site in C-RAF. Together, our results shed more light on the complex mechanism of RAF activation, particularly with respect to activation steps that are mediated by 14-3-3 proteins and prohibitin.

Together, our results shed more light on the complex mechanism of RAF activation, particularly with respect to activation steps that are mediated by 14-3-3 proteins and prohibitin. The serine/threonine-specific RAF kinases play a central role in several normal and pathologic cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, cell cycle progression, senescence, and apoptosis (1Wellbrock C. Karasarides M. Marais R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol... 2004; 5: 875-885Google Scholar, 2Rapp U.R. Gotz R. Albert S. Cancer Cell.. 2006; 9: 9-12Google Scholar). The first RAF kinase was originally discovered as the oncogenic product of mouse sarcoma virus 3611 (3Rapp U.R. Goldsborough M.D. Mark G.E. Bonner T.I. Groffen J. Reynolds Jr., F.H. Stephenson J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1983; 80: 4218-4222Google Scholar). Although invertebrates encode only a single RAF kinase, vertebrates express three isoforms, designated as A-, B-, and C-RAF. The C-RAF gene encodes a protein of 648 amino acids that is expressed as a 74-kDa polypeptide (4Bonner T.I. Kerby S.B. Sutrave P. Gunnell M.A. Mark G. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1985; 5: 1400-1407Google Scholar). A-RAF is a 68-kDa protein showing 60% homology to C-RAF (5Huleihel M. Goldsborough M. Cleveland J. Gunnell M. Bonner T. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1986; 6: 2655-2662Google Scholar). B-RAF is expressed as a full-length protein of 95 kDa or as smaller splice variants (6Stephens R.M. Sithanandam G. Copeland T.D. Kaplan D.R. Rapp U.R. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1992; 12: 3733-3742Google Scholar). All RAF proteins share a similar structure and possess three conserved regions, CR1, CR2, and CR3, that are embedded between variable segments. The CR1 and CR2 domains are part of the regulatory N-terminal half of the RAF proteins, whereas CR3 represents the C-terminal kinase domain. CR1 contains a Ras binding domain and a zinc binding domain, also called cysteine-rich domain. Although all RAF isoforms share a high degree of sequence similarity, they are obviously under different regulation and may have individual functions, mediated by isoform-specific protein-protein interactions (1Wellbrock C. Karasarides M. Marais R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol... 2004; 5: 875-885Google Scholar, 7Fischer A. Hekman M. Kuhlmann J. Rubio I. Wiese S. Rapp U.R. J. Biol.

Phosphorylation events are strongly involved in RAF activation process and are subject to tight regulation. Although several phosphorylation sites are well established, RAF phosphorylation remains one of the most controversial aspects of RAF research since the discovery of growth factor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of C-RAF (9Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Rapp U. Roberts T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1988; 85: 8855-8859Google Scholar). There are three classes of sites for regulatory phosphorylation: docking sites for 14-3-3 proteins (10Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell.. 1996; 84: 889-897Google Scholar), targeting sites (11Alavi A. Hood J.D. Frausto R. Stupack D.G. Cheresh D.A. Science.. 2003; 301: 94-96Google Scholar), and conformation-relevant sites (12Wan P.T. Garnett M.J. Roe S.M. Lee S. Niculescu-Duvaz D. Good V.M. Jones C.M. Marshall C.J. Springer C.J. Barford D. Marais R. Cell.. 2004; 116: 855-867Google Scholar). Morrison et al. (13Morrison D.K. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem... 1993; 268: 17309-17316Google Scholar) identified three basal phosphorylation sites in C-RAF; that is, the serine residues at positions 43, 259, and 621. Two of these sites (serine 259 and 621) are involved in binding of 14-3-3 proteins to C-RAF. Phosphorylation of serine 621 seems to be essential for C-RAF activation, as the mutation of serine 621 to alanine resulted in a RAF protein that could no longer be activated by growth factor stimulation (14Tzivion G. Luo Z. Avruch J. Nature.. 1998; 394: 88-92Google Scholar, 15Hekman M. Wiese S. Metz R. Albert S. Troppmair J. Nickel J. Sendtner M. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 14074-14086Google Scholar). In contrast, exchange of serine 259 by alanine or aspartic acid resulted in enhancement of kinase activity, indicating that phosphorylation of serine 259 is inhibitory (13Morrison D.K. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem... 1993; 268: 17309-17316Google Scholar, 16Zimmermann S. Moelling K. Science.. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Google Scholar, 17Dhillon A.S. Meikle S. Yazici Z. Eulitz M.

Podar K. Eulitz M. Baccarini M. J. Biol. Chem... 2002; 277: 7913-7919Google Scholar). Furthermore, the binding of 14-3-3 proteins to the C-terminal conserved site has been found to be differentially and dynamically regulated (15Hekman M. Wiese S. Metz R. Albert S. Troppmair J. Nickel J. Sendtner M. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 14074-14086Google Scholar). As reviewed by Aitken (20Aitken A. Plant Mol. Biol... 2002; 50: 993-1010Google Scholar) and by Dougherty and Morrison (21Dougherty M.K. Morrison D.K. J. Cell Sci... 2004; 117: 1875-1884Google Scholar), 14-3-3 proteins accomplish a wide range of functions in the cell. They have been shown to participate in the regulation of such crucial cellular processes as metabolism, signal transduction, cell cycle control, apoptosis, protein trafficking, transcription, stress responses, and malignant transformation. The regulation of cellular processes by 14-3-3 occurs through several different mechanisms: modulating enzymatic activity, altering protein localization, preventing dephosphorylation, promoting protein stability, inhibiting protein interactions, and mediating protein interactions. Seven mammalian isoforms of 14-3-3 proteins have been identified so far (20Aitken A. Plant Mol. Biol... 2002; 50: 993-1010Google Scholar, 22Martin H. Patel Y. Jones D. Howell S. Robinson K. Aitken A. FEBS Lett... 1993; 331: 296-303Google Scholar, 23Chaudhri M. Scarabel M. Aitken A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 2003; 300: 679-685Google Scholar). The association of 14-3-3 with client proteins occurs through defined high affinity peptide motifs, two of which (RSXpSXP and RXXXpSXP) are highly conserved and recognized by all 14-3-3 isoforms. In most cases, binding occurs only if a specific serine within the motif is phosphorylated, but some 14-3-3 interactions are independent of phosphorylation (20Aitken A. Plant Mol. Biol... 2002; 50: 993-1010Google Scholar). A common outcome of 14-3-3 protein binding may be translocation of target proteins into the cytosol. All of the 14-3-3 proteins form homodimers and/or heterodimers that interact with signaling proteins including protein kinase C, RAF kinases, kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR), 3The abbreviations used are: KSR, kinase suppressor of Ras; PHB, prohibitin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MS, mass spectrometry; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK kinase; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; shRNA, short hairpin looped RNAs; EF1, elongation factor 1. Cdc25 phosphatases, and BAD protein (24Tzivion G. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem... 2002; 277: 3061-3064Google Scholar). The pattern of the dimer formation for two of the most abundant mammalian isoforms, ϵ and γ 14-3-3, has been investigated by Chaudhri et al. (23Chaudhri M. Scarabel M. Aitken A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 2003; 300: 679-685Google Scholar). 14-3-3γ has been found to be present in homodimeric form, but also heterodimers could be formed mainly with 14-3-3ϵ. In contrast, 14-3-3ϵ formed heterodimers with 14-3-3β,-γ,-ζ and -η, but no homodimers were detected (23Chaudhri M. Scarabel M. Aitken A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 2003; 300: 679-685Google Scholar). The existence of the 14-3-3 homodimers and particular combination of the heterodimers in vivo may have important implications for function of 14-3-3 proteins serving either as a chaperone or adaptor protein. However, little is known about the specificity of the putative dimer combinations. Importantly, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains only two 14-3-3 homologues, BMH1 and BMH2, as compared with mammalian and plant cells that express 7-14 isoforms, thus, providing a simple model system for functional studies of 14-3-3 interactions with other signaling molecules. Recently, by use of mass spectrometry, a detailed proteomic analysis of in vivo 14-3-3 interactions of the yeast 14-3-3 proteins has been performed yielding at least 271 association partners (25Kakiuchi K. Yamauchi Y. Taoka M. Iwago M. Fujita T. Ito T. Song S.Y. Sakai A. Isobe T. Ichimura T. Biochemistry.. 2007; 46: 7781-7792Google Scholar). These findings reflect the important and the complex role of the 14-3-3 proteins in the cell. All three RAF kinases possess two typical 14-3-3 binding sites surrounding serines 621/259, 729/365, and 582/214 in C-, B-, and A-RAF, respectively. Although the C-terminal 14-3-3 protein binding motif of RAF kinases is highly conserved, the sequence surrounding serine 365 in B-RAF differs from the corresponding 14-3-3 binding motifs in A- and C-RAF (see Fig. 3C). An additional 14-3-3 binding site in C-RAF surrounding serine 233 has also been characterized (26Dumaz N. Marais R. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 278: 29819-29823Google Scholar). Furthermore, an atypical 14-3-3 binding site positioned at the C-terminal part of C-RAF-cysteine-rich domain and close to Ras binding domain has been proposed (27Clark G.J. Drugan J.K. Rossman K.L. Carpenter J.W. Rogers-Graham K. Fu H. Der C.J. Campbell S.L. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 20990-20993Google Scholar). In the vicinity of this 14-3-3 binding site, a contact domain for farnesyl residue of Ras proteins has been identified (28Williams J.G. Drugan J.K. Yi G.S. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Campbell S.L. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 22172-22179Google Scholar, 29Thapar R. Williams J.G. Campbell S.L. J. Mol. Biol... 2004; 343: 1391-1408Google Scholar). Therefore, the interaction of farnesyl residue with this domain might be necessary to remove steric hindrances caused by 14-3-3 proteins. Although direct experimental support is missing, it is generally accepted that the N-terminal regulatory part of RAF interacts in the basal state with the catalytic domain promoting a closed conformation of the kinase. Association with 14-3-3 proteins may further stabilize this inactive conformation (30Daum G. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Fries H.W. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Trends Biochem. Sci... 1994; 19: 474-480Google Scholar). Based on more recent information, Rapp et al. (2Rapp U.R. Gotz R. Albert S. Cancer Cell.. 2006; 9: 9-12Google Scholar) suggested a model in which 14-3-3 proteins are necessary for stabilizing the inactive as well as the growth factor-mediated active conformation of RAF. In addition, this model implies that RAF association with plasma membrane lipids (or lipid microdomains called rafts) represents the initial step in the RAF activation process. As a consequence, the association of RAF with membrane lipids and Ras-GTP displaces 14-3-3 from RAF (7Fischer A. Hekman M. Kuhlmann J. Rubio I. Wiese S. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 26503-26516Google Scholar, 31Hekman M. Hamm H. Villar A.V. Bader B. Kuhlmann J. Nickel J. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem... 2002; 277: 24090-24102Google Scholar). Removal of 14-3-3 proteins from RAF allows access to phosphatases. Regulation of the internal 14-3-3 binding site (Ser(P)-259) by phosphatases has been described by several groups (19Kubicek M. Pacher M. Abraham D. Podar K. Eulitz M. Baccarini M. J. Biol. Chem... 2002; 277: 7913-7919Google Scholar, 32Dhillon A.S. Pollock C. Steen H. Shaw P.E. Mischak H. Kolch W. Mol. Cell.

Prohibitin (PHB), a membrane chaperone, influences RAF activation in a positive manner and facilitates 14-3-3 displacement (34Rajalingam K. Wunder C. Brinkmann V. Churin Y. Hekman M. Sievers C. Rapp U.R. Rudel T. Nat. Cell Biol... 2005; 7: 837-843Google Scholar). A tentative model has been proposed for the subsequent steps with respect to C-RAF activation that includes Ras-driven B- and C-RAF heterooligomerization (7Fischer A. Hekman M. Kuhlmann J. Rubio I. Wiese S. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 26503-26516Google Scholar, 35Weber C.K. Slupsky J.R. Kalmes H.A. Rapp U.R. Cancer Res... 2001; 61: 3595-3598Google Scholar, 36Garnett M.J. Rana S. Paterson H. Barford D. Marais R. Mol. Cell.. 2005; 20: 963-969Google Scholar, 37Rushworth L.K. Hindley A.D. O'Neill E. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2006; 26: 2262-2272Google Scholar). As reported by our group (35Weber C.K. Slupsky J.R. Kalmes H.A. Rapp U.R. Cancer Res... 2001; 61: 3595-3598Google Scholar), mutation of the serine 621 to alanine in the C-terminal 14-3-3 binding motif of C-RAF considerably reduced the extent of the heterodimer formation, indicating strongly that 14-3-3 adaptor proteins regulate this process. In our previous contribution (15Hekman M. Wiese S. Metz R. Albert S. Troppmair J. Nickel J. Sendtner M. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 14074-14086Google Scholar) regarding 14-3-3 association with RAF kinases, we were primarily concerned with the characterization of the interactions between 14-3-3ζ homodimer and C-RAF. We examined the kinetics of C-RAF association with 14-3-3 proteins by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology and found that the 14-3-3 binding domain surrounding phosphoserine 621 represents the high affinity and probably the major binding site. Time course of endogenous C-RAF activation in mammalian cells upon nerve growth factor stimulation revealed substantial differences between 14-3-3 binding epitopes. In this study we investigated the putative association of all seven mammalian 14-3-3 isoforms with RAF in vivo and in vitro. By use of mass spectrometry, we analyzed the composition of the endogenously attached 14-3-3 isoforms to A-, B-, and C-RAF proteins and found that B-RAF associates in vivo with a much higher number of 14-3-3 isoforms. Significant differences in binding of 14-3-3 proteins to RAF isoforms have been monitored using the SPR technique. By deletion of the BMH1 gene in S. cerevisiae, we found that both homo- and heterodimeric forms of yeast 14-3-3 proteins participate in RAF activation. Furthermore, we show here that the substitution of serine within the C-terminal 14-3-3 binding site by alanine results in a marked reduction of activity of all three RAF isoforms. In contrast, the mutation of the internal 14-3-3 binding site resulted in elevation of B- and C-RAF activity. The relative binding affinities of the single 14-3-3 binding domains in A-, B-, and C-RAF have been investigated using an indirect competition assay. Finally, we show here that prohibitin, a scaffold protein affecting C-RAF activation in a stimulatory manner (34Rajalingam K. Wunder C. Brinkmann V. Churin Y. Hekman M. Sievers C. Rapp U.R. Rudel T. Nat. Cell Biol... 2005; 7: 837-843Google Scholar), competes for the 14-3-3 binding at the internal 14-3-3 binding site. Materials—Benzamidine, leupeptin, aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Nonidet P-40 were obtained from Sigma. Trypsin was from Promega (Mannheim, Germany). Glutathione-Sepharose was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was from Qiagen. Monoclonal anti-phospho-ERK antibodies were from New England Biolabs. Polyclonal anti-A-, B-, and C-RAF antibodies (C20, C19, and C12, respectively), polyclonal anti-green fluorescent protein (FL), and polyclonal anti-14-3-3 antibody (K-19) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibody against the pentahistidine tag was obtained from Qiagen. Phosphospecific antibodies directed against phospho-Ser-259 and phospho-Ser-338 of C-RAF were from Cell Signaling Technology. Phosphospecific antibody directed against phospho-Ser-621 (6B4) has been described previously (15Hekman M. Wiese S. Metz R. Albert S. Troppmair J. Nickel J. Sendtner M. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 14074-14086Google Scholar). Epidermal growth factor was obtained from PeproTech GmbH (Hamburg, Germany). Phosphopeptides derived from the 14-3-3 binding domains of A-, B-, and C-RAF containing 14-16 amino acids were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography, and the molecular weight was verified by mass spectroscopy. Cloning of Glutathione S-Transferase (GST)-tagged RAF Genes—For purification of human A-, B-, and C-RAF full-length proteins from mammalian cell lines, a GST tag was introduced. For this purpose RAF proteins have been modified to introduce the recognition sequence for NheI immediately upstream of ATG codon. In addition, adenine of ATG was converted into cytidine, which changes this codon from methionine into leucine. Modified gene was cleaved with NheI, and sticky ends were filled in with Klenow enzyme plus dNTPs. After heat inactivation of the polymerase, the RAF-containing fragments were released by further digestion with XbaI and ligated into BamHI-XbaI-cleaved pFastBac-Hta (Invitrogen). RAF proteins expressed by this system were N-terminal-extended by 28 amino acids including the GST tag for affinity purification on glutathione-Sepharose matrix. This extension did not influence biological properties of RAF kinases in vivo or in vitro. To measure regulation of A-, B-, and C-RAF kinase activities by 14-3-3 proteins, RAF wild type and RAF mutants possessing serine to alanine substitutions within the internal and/or C-terminal 14-3-3 binding sites (see also Fig. 4) were C-terminal-Myc-tagged and cloned as described in Baljuls et al. (8Baljuls A. Mueller T. Drexler H.C. Hekman M. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 26575-26590Google Scholar). The site-specific mutations within the 14-3-3 binding domains were introduced using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cloning of shRNAs and Production of Lentiviruses—Short hairpin looped RNAs (shRNAs) directed against human prohibitin-1 (NM_002634) were designed using Invitrogen bioinformatics tools. The following oligonucleotides were employed: hPHB1-shRNA-1-for, 5′-ACC ACG CGT CCC CAA CAC AGC CTT CCT TCT GCT CTT CAA GAG AGA GCA GAA GGA AGG CTG TGT TTT TTT GGA AAT-3′; hPHB1-shRNA-1-rev, 5′-TAT CGA TTT CCA AAA AAA CAC AGC CTT CCT TCT GCT CTC TCT TGA AGA GCA GAA GGA AGG CTG TGT TGG GGA-3′. The oligos were cloned to PLVTHM vector (kindly provided by Prof. Didier Trono, EPFL; Switzerland). Production of lentiviruses and infection of HeLa cells were performed as described on the tronolab website. The green fluorescent protein-expressing (shRNA-carrying) HeLa cells were sorted out by fluorescence-activated cell sorter, and the efficiency of the knock down was monitored by immunoblot and reverse transcription-PCR analysis. Several clones were tested, and the clones with the best knockdown were employed for further studies. The control cells were infected with lentiviruses carrying empty vector (PLVTHM) alone. These cells were cultured in RPMI medium in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Purification of RAF Kinases, Prohibitin, and 14-3-3 Proteins, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blot Analysis—For the production of recombinant RAF kinases, the Sf9 cells were infected with the desired baculoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 5 and incubated for 48 h at 30 °C. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted at 250 × g for 15 minutes. Lysis and purification of the GST- and His-tagged RAF kinases from Sf9 cells was performed as described in Hekman et al. (15Hekman M. Wiese S. Metz R. Albert S. Troppmair J. Nickel J. Sendtner M. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 14074-14086Google Scholar). For the purification of the GST-tagged RAF kinases from HEK293 cells, the same procedure as described above was applied. To remove 14-3-3 proteins associated with RAF, some purification procedures were carried out in the presence of 1.0% Empigen BB (Calbiochem). All seven mammalian 14-3-3 isoforms were expressed in Escherichia coli as GST fusion proteins using pGEX-2T vector (GE Healthcare) and purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography. To purify the heterodimeric forms of 14-3-3 proteins, Sf9 insect cells were used as the expression system. For that purpose the Sf9 cells were infected e.g. with baculoviruses containing both His-tagged 14-3-3ϵ and non-tagged 14-3-3ζ. The desired 14-3-3 heterodimer was isolated by nickel-agarose affinity purification as described above. The homodimeric forms of 14-3-3ϵ and 14-3-3ζ (both His-tagged) were purified from Sf9 cells as control samples in the same way as performed with heterodimers. To prove whether 14-3-3 proteins purified from Sf9 insect cells (and E. coli) exist in dimeric form, we performed gel filtration chromatography using an AKTA-System (GE Healthcare). For that purpose, 14-3-3 samples obtained by nickel-agarose chromatography were applied to a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) and eluted by 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl. All of the investigated 14-3-3 protein samples migrated at ∼70 kDa, indicating dimer formation. In these samples no monomeric forms of 14-3-3 were detected. Prohibitin was purified from E. coli essentially as described previously (34Rajalingam K. Wunder C. Brinkmann V. Churin Y. Hekman M. Sievers C. Rapp U.R. Rudel T. Nat. Cell Biol... 2005; 7: 837-843Google Scholar). The purity of RAF kinases, prohibitin, and 14-3-3 proteins was documented by SDS-PAGE (10% gels) and staining with Coomassie Blue. For Western blot analysis the gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) and probed either with phosphospecific antibodies or with antibodies specific for A-, B-, and C-RAF and phospho-ERK as indicated in the legends to the figures. After the washing procedure, the membranes were incubated with specific secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—HEK293 cells (2 × 107 cells) or Sf9 insect cells (1 × 107 cells) expressing proteins of interest were lysed in 800 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer supplemented with proteinase inhibitors for 45 min at 4 °C and immunoprecipitated as described previously (8Baljuls A. Mueller T. Drexler H.C. Hekman M. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 26575-26590Google Scholar). To assess co-precipitation of 14-3-3 with C-RAF, control and short hairpin PHB cells were serum-starved for 15 h and stimulated with 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Natutec) for 5 min. The cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm NaVO3, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm NaF with protease inhibitor cocktails), and C-RAF was immunoprecipitated using rabbit polyclonal C-12 antibody (Santa Cruz). Kinase Activity Measurements—Kinase assays with RAF samples were performed essentially as described in Hekman et al. (15Hekman M. Wiese S. Metz R. Albert S. Troppmair J. Nickel J. Sendtner M. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 14074-14086Google Scholar) using recombinant MEK-1 and ERK-2 as substrates. Biosensor Measurements—To determine quantitatively the interactions between the purified RAF preparations and different 14-3-3 isoforms, the SPR technique was applied. Biosensor Measurements were carried out either on a BIAcore-X or BIAcore-J system (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) at 25 °C. For that purpose the biosensor chip CM5 was first loaded with anti-GST antibody using covalent derivatization. Purified and GST-tagged 14-3-3 proteins were injected at a flow rate of 10 μl/min, which resulted in a deposition of ∼1200 response units. Next the purified His-tagged RAF proteins were injected as indicated. To measure binding of His-tagged 14-3-3 proteins to RAF (see also Fig. 1C) first GST-tagged C-RAF was captured by anti-GST antibody, and subsequently purified 14-3-3 proteins were injected. To measure the competition between RAF and 14-3-3 using synthetic peptides, GST-14-3-3ζ was first captured by anti-GST antibody. Next, RAF proteins were injected in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of the peptides as indicated in Fig. 3, and the competition between RAF and peptides for 14-3-3 binding was monitored. Mass Spectrometry Measurements—Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE using NuPAGE Novex 4-12% Bis-Tris gels (MOPS buffer system). Gels were subjected to silver staining (38Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis.. 1987; 8: 93-99Google Scholar), and the respective bands were excised and washed according to Shevchenko et al. (39Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem... 1996; 68: 850-858Google Scholar). Briefly, gel pieces were washed 3 times alternately with 50 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3 and 25 mm NH4HCO3 in 50% acetonitrile. Subsequently, the gel slices were dried in a vacuum centrifuge. 5 μl of trypsin solution (12.5 ng/μl in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate) were added to each gel piece and incubated at 37 °C overnight for in-gel digestion. The obtained peptides were eluted with 20 μl of 5% formic acid and subjected to nano-liquid chromatography-MS/MS analysis. Thereby, an Ultimate 3000 nano-HPLC system (Dionex GmbH, Idstein, Germany) was used. The samples were preconcentrated on a 100-μm inner diameter, 2-cm C18 column (nanoseparations, Nieuwkoop, The Netherlands) using 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid with a flow rate of 8 μl/min. The peptides were then separated on a 75-μm inner diameter, 15 cm, C18-PepMap column (flow rate 300 μl/min; Dionex GmbH, Idstein, Germany) using a 1-h binary gradient from 5 to 50% solvent B (solvent A: 0.1% formic acid; solvent B: 0.1% formic acid, 84% acetonitrile). The nano-HPLC was directly coupled to an ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ DecaXPPlus, ThermoElectron GmbH, Dreieich, Germany) acquiring repeatedly one full-MS and three tandem-MS spectra of the most intensive ions in the respective full MS scan. The tandem-MS spectra were searched against the NCBInr data base using the Mascot Daemon and the Mascot algorithm (Version 2.1; Matrix Science Ltd., London, UK) using the following adjustments: taxonomy (Homo sapiens), try"
https://openalex.org/W1991622062,"Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of HIV care and treatment programs is impacted by losses to follow-up (LTFU) in the patient population. The severity of this effect is undeniable but its extent unknown. Tracing all lost patients addresses this but census methods are not feasible in programs involving rapid scale-up of HIV treatment in the developing world. Sampling-based approaches and statistical adjustment are the only scaleable methods permitting accurate estimation of M&E indices.In a large antiretroviral therapy (ART) program in western Kenya, we assessed the impact of LTFU on estimating patient mortality among 8,977 adult clients of whom, 3,624 were LTFU. Overall, dropouts were more likely male (36.8% versus 33.7%; p = 0.003), and younger than non-dropouts (35.3 versus 35.7 years old; p = 0.020), with lower median CD4 count at enrollment (160 versus 189 cells/ml; p<0.001) and WHO stage 3-4 disease (47.5% versus 41.1%; p<0.001). Urban clinic clients were 75.0% of non-dropouts but 70.3% of dropouts (p<0.001). Of the 3,624 dropouts, 1,143 were sought and 621 had their vital status ascertained. Statistical techniques were used to adjust mortality estimates based on information obtained from located LTFU patients. Observed mortality estimates one year after enrollment were 1.7% (95% CI 1.3%-2.0%), revised to 2.8% (2.3%-3.1%) when deaths discovered through outreach were added and adjusted to 9.2% (7.8%-10.6%) and 9.9% (8.4%-11.5%) through statistical modeling depending on the method used. The estimates 12 months after ART initiation were 1.7% (1.3%-2.2%), 3.4% (2.9%-4.0%), 10.5% (8.7%-12.3%) and 10.7% (8.9%-12.6%) respectively. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE ABSTRACT: Assessment of the impact of LTFU is critical in program M&E as estimated mortality based on passive monitoring may underestimate true mortality by up to 80%. This bias can be ameliorated by tracing a sample of dropouts and statistically adjust the mortality estimates to properly evaluate and guide large HIV care and treatment programs."
https://openalex.org/W2088373022,"Genetic studies demonstrate that γ-protocadherins (PCDH-γ) are required for the survival and synaptic connectivity in neuronal subpopulations of the central nervous system. However, the intracellular signaling mechanisms for PCDH-γ are poorly understood. Here, we show that PCDH-γ binds two tyrosine kinases, PYK2 and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and interaction with PCDH-γ inhibits kinase activity. Consistent with this, PYK2 activity is abnormally up-regulated in the Pcdh-γ-deficient neurons. Overexpression of PYK2 induces apoptosis in the chicken spinal cord. Thus, negative regulation of PYK2 activity by PCDH could contribute to the survival of subsets of neurons. Surprisingly, we found that PCDH-α interacts similarly with PYK2 and FAK despite containing a distinct cytoplasmic domain. In neural tissue, PCDH-γ, together with PCDH-α, forms functional complexes with PYK2 and/or FAK. Therefore, the identification of common intracellular effectors for PCDH-γ and PCDH-α suggests that dozens of protocadherins generated by Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ gene clusters can converge different extracellular signals into common intracellular pathways.

Therefore, the identification of common intracellular effectors for PCDH-γ and PCDH-α suggests that dozens of protocadherins generated by Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ gene clusters can converge different extracellular signals into common intracellular pathways. Cadherin superfamily molecules have evolved to play an instructive role in cell-cell interactions during tissue morphogenesis in multicellular organisms (1Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol... 1995; 7: 619-627Google Scholar, 2Yagi T. Takeichi M. Genes Dev... 2000; 14: 1169-1180Google Scholar, 3Halbleib J.M. Nelson W.J. Genes Dev... 2006; 20: 3199-3214Google Scholar). Nearly 80 different protocadherin genes constitute the largest group within the cadherin superfamily. Like classic cadherins, protocadherins usually share similar structural organization in their extracellular domains with six or more ectodomain repeats but have divergent cytoplasmic domains. Among protocadherins, three families of α-, β-, and γ-protocadherin genes (designated Pcdh-α, Pcdh-β, and Pcdh-γ) are arrayed in tandem on a single chromosome (4Wu Q. Maniatis T. Cell.. 1999; 97: 779-790Google Scholar). The overall genomic organization of these gene families is conserved in all vertebrates (5Noonan J.P. Grimwood J. Schmutz J. Dickson M. Myers R.M. Genome Res... 2004; 14: 354-366Google Scholar, 6Wu Q. Genetics.. 2005; 169: 2179-2188Google Scholar). For the PCDH-α or PCDH-γ family, each PCDH isoform contains distinct extracellular and transmembrane domains encoded by one large variable exon. By contrast, all isoforms within a family contain a common cytoplasmic domain encoded by three constant exons. Individual neurons express a combination of PCDH-α and PCDH-γ isoforms through differential promoter activation and alternative splicing (7Kohmura N. Senzaki K. Hamada S. Kai N. Yasuda R. Watanabe M.

Cell.. 2002; 10: 21-33Google Scholar), with the majority of PCDH-α and PCDH-γ isoforms (C-type isoforms excluded) expressed monoallelically (12Esumi S. Kakazu N. Taguchi Y. Hirayama T. Sasaki A.

One possibility is that cell-specific PCDH expression patterns are enforced through allelic exclusion as a result of competition for shared long range regulatory elements (14Ribich S. Tasic B. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2006; 103: 19719-19724Google Scholar). PCDH proteins appear to have adhesive activity (8Frank M. Ebert M. Shan W. Phillips G.R. Arndt K. Colman D.R.

Cell Sci... 1995; 108: 3765-3773Google Scholar) and are predominantly expressed in the neuronal tissues throughout development. PCDH proteins have been shown to be associated with synapses and intracellular vesicles (7Kohmura N. Senzaki K. Hamada S. Kai N. Yasuda R. Watanabe M. Ishii H. Yasuda M. Mishina M. Yagi T. Neuron.. 1998; 20: 1137-1151Google Scholar, 16Wang X. Weiner J.A. Levi S. Craig A.M. Bradley A. Sanes J.R. Neuron.. 2002; 36: 843-854Google Scholar, 17Phillips G.R. Huang J.K. Wang Y. Tanaka H.

Benson D.L. Colman D.R. J. Neurosci... 2003; 23: 5096-5104Google Scholar). Genetic analyses of mice lacking the entire Pcdh-γ gene cluster (Pcdh-γdel/del) provided evidence that PCDH-γ is essential for neural development (16Wang X. Weiner J.A. Levi S. Craig A.M. Bradley A. Sanes J.R. Neuron.. 2002; 36: 843-854Google Scholar). During late embryonic development, dramatic apoptosis and synaptic loss in the spinal interneurons led to neonatal lethality. Further analysis of Pcdh-γdel/del; Bax–/– mutant mice in which apoptosis is circumvented revealed a decrease of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the spinal cord (19Weiner J.A. Wang X. Tapia J.C. Sanes J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2005; 102: 8-14Google Scholar). More recently, an abnormality in axon convergence of olfactory sensory neurons has been observed in Pcdh-α–/– mice (20Hasegawa S. Hamada S. Kumode Y. Esumi S. Katori S. Fukuda E. Uchiyama Y. Hirabayashi T. Mombaerts P. Yagi T. Mol. Cell Neurosci... 2008; 38: 66-79Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that PCDH proteins play a role in establishing neuronal connectivity via regulation of cell adhesion and cell death.An important remaining question is how PCDH function interfaces with cell signaling pathways during development. The 22 mouse PCDH-γ isoforms share a common cytoplasmic domain, and their extracellular domains are distinct and diverse, thus suggesting a potential mechanism of PCDH-γ action-signal convergence through the common intracellular domain. Mice expressing C-terminal truncated PCDH-γ proteins (Pcdh-γtru/tru) displayed neonatal lethality and spinal interneuron phenotypes similar to Pcdh-γdel/del; Bax–/– mice, suggesting that the intracellular domain is essential for PCDH-γ function in vivo (19Weiner J.A. Wang X. Tapia J.C. Sanes J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2005; 102: 8-14Google Scholar). There are two prominent models that explain PCDH intracellular function. First, the intracellular tail of PCDH might act directly as a regulator of transcription in a manner similar to Notch signaling. Consistent with this view, the intracellular domain of PCDH-γs is proteolytically processed by metalloproteinases andγ-secretases (21Haas I.G. Frank M. Veron N. Kemler R. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 9313-9319Google Scholar, 22Hambsch B. Grinevich V. Seeburg P.H. Schwarz M.K. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 15888-15897Google Scholar), and the cleaved cytoplasmic domain localizes in the nucleus and activates the transcription of Pcdh-γ in transfected nonneuronal cells (22Hambsch B. Grinevich V. Seeburg P.H. Schwarz M.K. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 15888-15897Google Scholar). Second, the intracellular tail might function as a docking site for cytoplasmic signaling transducers. However, currently, evidence supporting a signaling mechanism has not been reported.As an initial test of these two models, we used a modified two-hybrid screen to identify proteins that bind the cytoplasmic tail of PCDH-γ. Here, we report that two members of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) 3The abbreviations used are: FAK, focal adhesion kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BrdUrd, 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine; IP, immunoprecipitation; PSD, postsynaptic density; NCAM, neural cell adhesion molecule; GFP, green fluorescent protein.3The abbreviations used are: FAK, focal adhesion kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BrdUrd, 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine; IP, immunoprecipitation; PSD, postsynaptic density; NCAM, neural cell adhesion molecule; GFP, green fluorescent protein. family, PYK2 and FAK, directly interact with the common cytoplasmic domain of PCDH-γ. We also found that PCDH-α interacts with these intracellular kinases. PCDH-γ, PCDH-α, FAK, and PYK2 are present in large membrane protein complexes in neural tissue. Interaction with PCDH-γ and PCDH-α inhibits FAK and PYK2 activity in vitro and in vivo, and PYK2 activity is up-regulated in PCDH-γ-deficient mice. Furthermore, overexpression of PYK2 leads to an increase of apoptosis in the developing chicken spinal cord. Therefore, negative regulation of the proapoptotic activity of PYK2 by protocadherins could play a role in maintaining neuronal survival during development.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCytoTrap Two-hybrid Screen—We used the yeast CytoTrap two-hybrid system from Stratagene to identify PCDH-γC-interacting proteins (23Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S.J. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1997; 17: 3094-3102Google Scholar). To construct γC bait, we PCR-amplified the cDNA encoding γC domain without the last 10-amino acid sequence with primer 936 (5′-CCT CCG TCG ACG CAG CAA GCC CCG CCC AA-3′) and 939 (5′-AGC AAG CTT GCG GCC GCT TAG TTG CCA TTA CCA CCT GCT GG-3′). After digestion with SalI and NotI, γC cDNA was cloned into pSOS and used as bait. We screened a mouse adult brain cDNA library from Stratagene according to the manufacturer's instructions.cDNA Expression Vector Construction—The expression vectors for a variety of Pcdh-γ, Pcdh-α, FAK, and PYK2 cDNAs were constructed by cloning restriction enzyme-digested or PCR-amplified DNA fragments into pGEX.KG, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), p3×FLAG-CMV-9/10 (Sigma), and PB-CAG. Different epitope tags, including 9E10-myc, FLAG, and V5, were used to tag individual cDNAs. The kinase-dead PYK2 and FAK vectors with point mutations (pB-CAG-V5-PYK2 Y402F; K457A and pB-CAG-V5-FAK Y397F; K454R, Y620; Y621F) were generated by overlapping PCR followed by restriction enzyme-based cloning. The original full-length human PYK2 and mouse FAK cDNAs were obtained from IMAGE or FANTOM clone collections. All cloning and mutagenesis were verified by complete or partial sequencing.GST Pull-down, Immunoprecipitation, and in Vitro Kinase Assay—Bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified as previously described (16Wang X. Weiner J.A. Levi S. Craig A.M. Bradley A. Sanes J.R. Neuron.. 2002; 36: 843-854Google Scholar). GST-γC, GST-αC, GST-N-Cad-C, and GST alone were used in this study. For pull-down assays, aliquots of immobilized GST proteins (10–15 μg) were used to incubate with 293T cell lysates that expressed different PCDH, PYK2, and FAK proteins. The lysates were prepared in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 20 mm NaF, 25 μm ZnCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Roche Applied Science protease inhibitors). After incubation and washing, the pull-down proteins were detected by Western blot.Immunoprecipitation from cultured cells were carried out as previously described with modifications (24Ueda H. Abbi S. Zheng C. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol... 2000; 149: 423-430Google Scholar). A variety of FLAG-tagged proteins were expressed in 293T or SYF cells, lysed in the same lysis buffer described above, and purified with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma). Insect cell-expressed GST-tagged FAK and His-tagged PYK2 proteins were purchased from Invitrogen and Millipore, respectively. For affinity purification of PCDH-γ-GFP complexes from the brain, the crude membrane proteins were first prepared as described before (16Wang X. Weiner J.A. Levi S. Craig A.M. Bradley A. Sanes J.R. Neuron.. 2002; 36: 843-854Google Scholar). In brief, the whole brain tissues were homogenized with a tissue grinder in the buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Roche Applied Science protease inhibitors). The cell debris and nuclei were removed by low speed centrifugation, and the crude membrane proteins were harvested by high speed (16,000 rpm) centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 20 min. The resulted membrane proteins were then suspended in the buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.8% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors). After a 20-min high speed (16,000 rpm) centrifugation and preabsorption with bovine serum albumin-saturated Sepharose beads for 30 min, the PCDH-γ-GFP complexes were isolated with anti-GFP-agarose beads (MBL).In vitro kinase assays were carried out as previously described (24Ueda H. Abbi S. Zheng C. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol... 2000; 149: 423-430Google Scholar). In brief, immunopurified kinases were incubated with exogenous substrate, E4Y1 polypeptide from Sigma, in a kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MnCl2, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 μg of E4Y1) for 20 min at 37 °C. Various amounts of GST proteins (0–5 μg) were added to measure their effect on kinase activity.Cell Culture, Primary Neuron Culture, and Transfection—Human kidney HEK 293T and SYF fibroblasts were originally purchased from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used in all transfection experiments. Primary neuron cultures were prepared from E18 Pcdh-γfusg mouse hippocampi essentially as in Brewer et al. (25Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res... 1993; 35: 567-576Google Scholar). Briefly, neurons were plated at a density of 3.6 × 104 cells/cm2 on (0.002%) poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. Neurons were maintained in Neurobasal with B27 supplements for 2 weeks and processed for immunocytochemistry.Antibodies—The antibodies used in the study were from the following sources: mouse anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma); rabbit anti-GFP (Invitrogen); rat anti-GFP beads (MBL); rat anti-GFP antibody (MBL); rabbit anti-FAK (Upstate and Cell Signaling); mouse anti-FAK (Upstate); rabbit anti-Tyr(P)397-FAK (BIOSOURCE); rabbit anti-PYK2 (Upstate and Abcam); mouse anti-PYK2 (BD Biosciences); rabbit anti-Tyr(P)402-PYK2 (BIOSOURCE); 9E10 anti-Myc (DSHB); E7 anti-β-tubulin (DSHB); rabbit anti-synapsin I (Invitrogen); mouse anti-pancadherin (Sigma); mouse anti-NF200 (Sigma); rat anti-BrdUrd (Accurate Chemical and Scientific); mouse anti-V5 (Invitrogen and Serotec); rabbit anti-phosphohistone H3 (Cell Signaling); rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling); and secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA)). Rabbit anti-N-CAM and rabbit anti-PCDH-γ were previously generated. The specificity of PCDH-γ antibody was previously characterized by Western blot on brain lysates from knock-out mice (16Wang X. Weiner J.A. Levi S. Craig A.M. Bradley A. Sanes J.R. Neuron.. 2002; 36: 843-854Google Scholar). The rabbit anti-PCDH-α was generated in this study, and the specificity on brain lysates was confirmed by mass spectrometry identification in a related study. The specificity of FAK and PYK2 antibodies was verified by at least two or three different commercially available antibodies.Fractionation and Sucrose Gradient Ultracentrifugation—The fractionation of total brain proteins was described by Carlin et al. (26Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol... 1980; 86: 831-845Google Scholar). In brief, the brain homogenate was first clarified by low speed (700 × g) centrifugation, and the supernatant was then separated into the soluble cytosolic fraction (S2) and pellet (crude membrane P2) by high speed centrifugation (13,800 × g). The resulting crude membrane proteins were further fractionated by discontinuous sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation (82,500 × g). The synaptosome fraction was collected from the interface between 1.0 and 1.2 m sucrose layers. The Triton X-100-insoluble postsynaptic density (PSD) fraction was collected as a pellet after the following ultracentrifugation.For sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, whole brain tissues were homogenized using a tissue grinder. Tissue debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min. The water-insoluble fraction in the supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 26,000 × g for 20 min. Total water-insoluble proteins were extracted in the same buffer with 2% Triton X-100 and clarified by centrifugation at 26,000 × g for 20 min. The Triton X-100-extracted proteins were then separated on a 5–50% sucrose gradient at 33,000 rpm in a SW41Ti rotor at 4 °C for 17.5 h. 750-μl fractions were collected from the top. Aliquots of individual fractions that contained an equal amount of proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot. Bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), thyroglobulin (669 kDa), and blue dextran (2,000 kDa) were used as size standards for sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. The peak of the PCDH-γ complexes lies around 600 kDa. The protein concentration in each fraction was first determined by a BCA protein assay kit from Pierce, and the equal loading of proteins from two genotypes was then confirmed by Coomassie staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were conducted in identical gels, transferred, probed, with antibodies, and developed with ECL at the same time. The Western blot results were reproduced at least three times.In Ovo Electroporation of Chick Spinal Cord—Fertilized white leghorn chicken eggs were incubated at 38 °C to stage 12 by Hamburger and Hamiltons' criteria prior to electroporation. DNA mixtures of both V5-PYK2-expressing PB transposon and PB transposase were injected into the central canal of the neural tube, and electroporation was performed in the thoracic segment of the spinal cord as previously described (27Nakamura H. Funahashi J. Methods.. 2001; 24: 43-48Google Scholar). For BrdUrd labeling, 50 μl of BrdUrd (Sigma; 100 mm in phosphate-buffered saline) were dropped on chicken embryos, and embryos were incubated for 1 h before harvesting.RESULTSPCDH-γ Interacts with PYK2 and FAK in Vitro—To investigate the intracellular signaling mechanism of PCDH-γ, we employed a yeast CytoTrap two-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with the shared cytoplasmic domain of PCDH-γ (γC). The CytoTrap system relies on the ability of the human SOS protein to rescue a temperature-sensitive yeast mutant in the Ras signaling pathway when localized in the proximity of plasma membrane. The bait we used is a fusion protein between human SOS and the first 115 amino acids in γC. The last 10 amino acids of γC were deleted, because the bait containing this sequence had a background activity in the CytoTrap system. We screened 2 × 106 clones from a mouse adult brain cDNA library and identified 20 different candidate proteins that specifically interacted with pSOS-γC bait. One positive clone encodes an in-frame fusion between the myristoylation signal and N-terminal truncated PYK2 (amino acids 364–967 of mouse proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2) (28Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature.. 1995; 376: 737-745Google Scholar). Since PYK2 and FAK share significant sequence homology, we tested both full-length PYK2 and FAK for their interactions with the bait pSOS-γC. As shown in Fig. 1A, pSOS-γC specifically interacted with both pMyr-PYK2 and pMyr-FAK and rescued the growth of temperature-sensitive yeast at 37 °C. To determine if γC could bind to PYK2 or FAK, we purified a bacterially expressed GST fusion protein containing the entire shared cytoplasmic domain of PCDH-γ (GST-γC, including the last 10 amino acids that were excluded in the CytoTrap) and tested for its binding to 9E10 Myc-tagged PYK2 or FAK expressed in 293T cell lysates. Both Myc-tagged PYK2 and FAK interacted with GST-γC immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads but not with GST alone beads (Fig. 1B). To demonstrate that the interaction is direct, we tested whether the purified GST-γC protein can bind to a commercially available His-PYK2 purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells and detected a robust interaction between these two proteins (Fig. 1B, bottom). Unfortunately, the GST tag on an available recombinant FAK protein prevented us from performing a similar experiment on FAK.To demonstrate the interaction between PCDH-γ and PYK2 in mammalian cells, 293T cells were transfected with FLAG epitope-tagged PYK2 and full-length PCDH-γ-C5, one of 22 PCDH-γ isoforms that have distinct extracellular domains but share a common γC. In the cells expressing both proteins, we found that PCDH-γ C5 was associated with PYK2 (Fig. 1C, top). We repeated a reciprocal experiment using FLAG-tagged PCDH-γ for immunoprecipitation (IP) and Myc-tagged PYK2 for Western blot, and the result confirmed that PCDH-γ interacted with PYK2 (Fig. 1C, bottom). In parallel, we performed co-IP experiments to determine the association of PCDH-γ with FAK. These experiments showed that PCDH-γ interacted with FAK in transfected 293T cells (Fig. 1D, top and bottom). Two other PCDH-γ isoforms, C4 and B2, were also found to interact with PYK2 and FAK (data not shown). Taken together, we conclude that PCDH-γ proteins can bind directly to both PYK2 and FAK through their common cytoplasmic domain.PCDH-α Interacts with FAK and PYK2 in Vitro—Since different PCDH families contain distinct cytoplasmic domains, we asked whether interactions with PYK2 and FAK are specific to the PCDH-γ family. To test this possibility, we also determined whether PYK2 and FAK could be pulled down using GST fused to the cytoplasmic domain from PCDH-α (GST-αC). We did not include PCDH-β in the analysis, because individual PCDH-β isoforms have unique cytoplasmic domains. To our surprise, we found that both Myc-tagged PYK2 and FAK interacted with GST-αC in this assay (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2PCDH-α interacts with PYK2 and FAK in vitro. A, PYK2 and FAK interact with αC in the GST pull-down assay. Like GST-γC, GST-αC interacted with Myc-tagged PYK2 or FAK from 293T cell lysates. B, the lysine-rich tail of γC but not that of αC is required for binding to FAK. GST pull-down assays using αC-(1–152), αC-(1–119), γC-(1–125), and γC-(1–115) demonstrated that the last 10 amino acids in γC are important for the binding of FAK to PCDH-γ but have less effect on the binding to PYK2. C and D, PYK2 and FAK interact with full-length PCDH-α in 293T cells. FLAG-tagged PYK2 or FAK proteins were expressed with full-length C2 isoform of PCDH-α in 293T cells. Anti-FLAG IP and Western blots show PYK2 (C) or FAK (D) is associated with PCDH-α.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the CytoTrap two-hybrid system, we noticed that the interaction of pMyr-FAK with the bait pSOS-γC was relatively weak, whereas FAK interacted strongly with PCDH-γ in GST pull-down (Figs. 1 and 2A). One difference in these experiments is that pSOS-γC does not contain the last 10 lysine-rich amino acids. The shared cytoplasmic domain for PCDH-α (αC) contains an even longer lysine-rich tail. To evaluate whether the lysine-rich tails in both γC and αC contribute to the interactions among PCDH, PYK2, and FAK, we purified GST-γC-(1–115) and GST-αC-(1–119) lacking lysine-rich tails and examined their interactions with PYK2 and FAK using GST pull-down (Fig. 2B). This experiment demonstrated that the lysine tail in γC is important for binding of FAK but contributes less to the binding of PYK2 (Fig. 2B, right panels), providing an explanation for the weak interaction observed in the CytoTrap assay. The lysine tail in αC is not required for binding of either FAK or PYK2 (Fig. 2B, left panels).To confirm the in vitro interaction between αC and PYK2 or FAK, we expressed the full-length C2, one of the PCDH-α isoforms, and FLAG-tagged PYK2 or FAK in 293T cells and used co-IP experiments to determine their biochemical interactions. In both cases, PYK2 and FAK bound to PCDH-α C2 specifically (Fig. 2, C and D). Thus, our data have shown that PCDH-α can also interact with PYK2 and FAK in vitro.PCDH-α, PCDH-γ, FAK, and PYK2 Are in Protein Complexes in Vivo—The fact that both PCDH-α and PCDH-γ directly bind PYK2 and FAK, combined with evidence that PCDH-α and PCDH-γ physically interact in vivo (29Murata Y. Hamada S. Morishita H. Mutoh T. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 49508-49516Google Scholar, 30Bonn S. Seeburg P.H. Schwarz M.K. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2007; 27: 4121-4132Google Scholar), suggested the possibility that together these proteins form protein complexes in vivo. We first used co-IP experiments to confirm the association of PCDH-α and PCDH-γ in transfected 293T cells (Fig. 3A). PCDH-α and PCDH-γ are enriched in the membrane and even more in postsynaptic fractions from brain lysates. The affinity purification of PCDH from these fractions would be the most straightforward way to detect such protein complexes; our PCDH antibodies were, however, unsuitable for this application. For these experiments, we chose to affinity-purify PCDH-γ-containing complexes from brain lysates of a PCDH-γ-GFP knock-in mouse line (Pcdh-γfusg (16Wang X. Weiner J.A. Levi S. Craig A.M. Bradley A. Sanes J.R. Neuron.. 2002; 36: 843-854Google Scholar), in which a GFP cDNA is fused in-frame with the third constant exon of PCDH-γ. One advantage of this approach is that wild type mice would provide a negative control for co-IP using an anti-GFP antibody. Homozygous Pcdh-γfusg/fusg mice are grossly normal, and thus it is likely that the C-terminal GFP sequence does not interfere with the function of the cytoplasmic tail. To test this assumption, fusion proteins of two different PCDH-γ isoforms, PCDH-γ-C4-GFP (Fig. 3B) and PCDH-γ-B2-GFP (Fig. 3C), were tested for binding to FLAG-tagged FAK and PYK2 in transfected 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 3, B and C, GFP fusion at the C terminus of PCDH-γ did not interfere with PCDH-γ-FAK or PCDH-γ-PYK2 interaction. After validating our affinity purification strategy, we prepared total membrane fractions from Pcdh-γ+/fusg mouse brain lysates at two different developmental stages (neonatal P0 and postnatal day 6 (P6)), affinity-purified protein complexes with anti-GFP beads, and detected associated proteins by Western blot. Results in Fig. 3, D and E, illustrate that PCDH-α, PCDH-γ, FAK, and PYK2 co-immunoprecipitate with PCDH-γ-GFP. The choice of Pcdh-γ+/fusg heterozygous mice allows us to demonstrate that at least two different PCDH-γ molecules exist in a complex. This experiment, however, does not distinguish whether FAK and PYK2 are in the same PCDH-γ complex or in several separate complexes. The formation of PCDH-γ dimers or oligomers (Fig. 3D) in the cells makes it difficult to determine whether a single PCDH-γ molecule can bind to PYK2 and FAK simultaneously. Using the GST pull-down assay (Fig. 3F), we determined that both PYK2 and FAK interact with the same region within the shared cytoplasmic domain of PCDH-γ (the last 61 amino acids). This does not prove but suggests that PYK2 and FAK may compete for the same binding motif in a single PCDH-γ molecule. Nevertheless, PYK2 and FAK could still coexist in a large complex through bridges between PCDH-γ-PCDH-γ, PCDH-α-PCDH-α, and PCDH-α-PCDH-γ. In summary, the discovery of protein complexes that consist of PCDH-α, PCDH-γ, FAK, and/or PYK2 provides further evidence that α- and γ-protocadherins are associated with the two kinases in vivo.FIGURE 3PCDH-γ, PCDH-α, FAK, and/or PYK2 are in protein complexes in the brain. A, PCDH-α and PCDH-γ are associated with each other in 293T cells. Anti-FLAG IP showed that FLAG-tagged PCDH-α bound to PCDH-γ in cells transfected with both expression vectors. B and C, FAK and PYK2 interact with PCDH-γ-GFP fusion proteins in transfected 293T cells. D and E, PCDH-γ protein complexes consist of multiple PCDH proteins and FAK or PYK2. PCDH-γ containing protein complexes were affinity-purified with anti-GFP beads using Pcdh-γ+/fusg brain tissues. The protein compositions of the complexes were analyzed by the indicated Western blots. P6 and P0 brain samples were used in D and E, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2065544945,"Transcription factor Nrf3 (NF-E2 p45-related factor 3) is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mouse Nrf3 is subject to proteolysis, Asn glycosylation, and deglycosylation reactions. It is synthesized as a ∼96-kDa protein that is subsequently converted into isoforms of ∼90, 80, and 70 kDa. In the ER, the ∼90-kDa glycoprotein is predominant and gives rise to ∼80- and ∼70-kDa isoforms. The ∼90- and ∼80-kDa polypeptides were observed in the nuclear envelope, whereas the ∼70-kDa isoform was detected primarily in the nucleoplasm. Our experiments showed the N-terminal homology box 1 (NHB1, residues 12-31) is part of a tripartite signal peptide sequence, comprising n, h, and c regions. The h region (residues 12-23) was demonstrated to target Nrf3 to the ER and is necessary for its Asn glycosylation. The n region (residues 1-11) controlled the abundance of the ∼90-kDa glycoprotein. The c region (residues 24-39) was found to contain a signal peptidase cleavage site that is responsible for production of the ∼90-kDa mature Nrf3 glycoprotein from a ∼96-kDa precursor. We have found that Nrf3 is activated by the ER stressors tunicamycin and brefeldin A, and that NHB1 is required for this response. Amino acids between the c region and NHB2 (residues 76-100) controlled the proteolytic processing of mouse Nrf3 into cleavage products of ∼80-kDa (glycated) and ∼70-kDa (non-glycated); by contrast, human Nrf3 lacked a signal peptidase cleavage site between its c region and NHB2. Lastly, data are presented suggesting that the NHB2 sequence in mouse Nrf3 may regulate the topology of the transcription factor within the ER membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2020915455,"Variants in the complement cascade genes and the LOC387715/HTRA1, have been widely reported to associate with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the most common cause of visual impairment in industrialized countries.We investigated the association between the LOC387715 A69S and complement component C3 R102G risk alleles in the Finnish case-control material and found a significant association with both variants (OR 2.98, p = 3.75 x 10(-9); non-AMD controls and OR 2.79, p = 2.78 x 10(-19), blood donor controls and OR 1.83, p = 0.008; non-AMD controls and OR 1.39, p = 0.039; blood donor controls), respectively. Previously, we have shown a strong association between complement factor H (CFH) Y402H and AMD in the Finnish population. A carrier of at least one risk allele in each of the three susceptibility loci (LOC387715, C3, CFH) had an 18-fold risk of AMD when compared to a non-carrier homozygote in all three loci. A tentative gene-gene interaction between the two major AMD-associated loci, LOC387715 and CFH, was found in this study using a multiplicative (logistic regression) model, a synergy index (departure-from-additivity model) and the mutual information method (MI), suggesting that a common causative pathway may exist for these genes. Smoking (ever vs. never) exerted an extra risk for AMD, but somewhat surprisingly, only in connection with other factors such as sex and the C3 genotype. Population attributable risks (PAR) for the CFH, LOC387715 and C3 variants were 58.2%, 51.4% and 5.8%, respectively, the summary PAR for the three variants being 65.4%.Evidence for gene-gene interaction between two major AMD associated loci CFH and LOC387715 was obtained using three methods, logistic regression, a synergy index and the mutual information (MI) index."
https://openalex.org/W2081663420,"Determining how deubiquitinating enzymes discriminate between ubiquitin-conjugated substrates is critical to understand their function. Through application of a novel protein cleavage and tagging technique, sortagging, we show that human UCHL3 and the Plasmodium falciparum homologue, members of the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase family, use a unique active site crossover loop to restrict access of bulky ubiquitin adducts to the active site. Although it provides connectivity for critical active site residues in UCHL3, physical integrity of the crossover loop is dispensable for catalysis. By enlarging the active site crossover loop, we have constructed gain-of-function mutants that can accept substrates that the parent enzyme cannot, including ubiquitin chains of various linkages."
https://openalex.org/W1982271544,"The formation of insoluble cross beta-sheet amyloid is pathologically associated with disorders such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, and Huntington diseases. One exception is the nonpathological amyloid derived from the protein Pmel17 within melanosomes to generate melanin pigment. Here we show that the formation of insoluble MalphaC intracellular fragments of Pmel17, which are the direct precursors to Pmel17 amyloid, depends on a novel juxtamembrane cleavage at amino acid position 583 between the furin-like proprotein convertase cleavage site and the transmembrane domain. The resulting Pmel17 C-terminal fragment is then processed by the gamma-secretase complex to release a short-lived intracellular domain fragment. Thus, by analogy to the Notch receptor, we designate this cleavage the S2 cleavage site, whereas gamma-secretase mediates proteolysis at the intramembrane S3 site. Substitutions or deletions at this S2 cleavage site, the use of the metalloproteinase inhibitor TAPI-2, as well as small interfering RNA-mediated knock-down of the metalloproteinases ADAM10 and 17 reduced the formation of insoluble Pmel17 fragments. These results demonstrate that the release of the Pmel17 ectodomain, which is critical for melanin amyloidogenesis, is initiated by S2 cleavage at a juxtamembrane position."
https://openalex.org/W2063173757,"In the presence of GTP, purified dimers of alpha- and beta-tubulin will interact longitudinally and laterally to self-assemble into microtubules (MTs). This property provides a powerful in vitro experimental system to describe MT dynamic behavior at the micrometer scale and to study effects and functioning of a large variety of microtubule associated proteins (MAPs). Despite the plethora of such data produced, the molecular mechanisms of MT assembly remain disputed. Electron microscopy (EM) studies suggested that tubulin dimers interact longitudinally to form short oligomers which form a tube by lateral interaction and which contribute to MT elongation. This idea is however challenged: Based on estimated association constants it was proposed that single dimers represent the major fraction of free tubulin. This view was recently supported by measurements suggesting that MTs elongate by addition of single tubulin dimers. To solve this discrepancy, we performed a direct measurement of the longitudinal interaction energy for tubulin dimers. We quantified the size distribution of tubulin oligomers using EM and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). From the distribution we derived the longitudinal interaction energy in the presence of GDP and the non-hydrolysable GTP analog GMPCPP. Our data suggest that MT elongation and nucleation involves interactions of short tubulin oligomers rather than dimers. Our approach provides a solid experimental framework to better understand the role of MAPs in MT nucleation and growth."

Cloning of Toxin B Fragments—For toxin B fragments 1–955, 544–955, and 579–777 primers were designed to amplify fragments of C. difficile toxin B with flanking BamHI and NotI restriction sites from genomic DNA of C. difficile VPI 10463 (toxinB-1-BamHI-sense (cccggatccatgagtttagttaatagaaaacag), toxinB-544-BamHI-sense (cggatccggtgaagatgataatcttg) and toxinB-955-NotI-antisense (cgcggccgcttcgtgtgtagtatctaaatttac); toxinB-579-BamHI-sense (cggatcccactatattgttcagttacaagg) and toxinB-777-NotI-antisense-stop (cgcggccgctcattcttttgatgaaatatcatttataatactttc). PCR was performed by using Pfu Turbo polymerase (Fermentas GmbH, St. Leon-Rot, Germany), and the PCR products were cloned into pCR-BluntII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany), then subcloned into pET-28a(+) (Novagen, EMD Biosciences) as BamHI-NotI fragments. Primers for amplification of toxin B fragment 544–2366 and toxin B fragment 900–2366 were toxinB-544-BamHI-sense (cggatccggtgaagatgataatcttg) and toxinB-2366-EcoRI-antisense (gaattcctattcactaatcactaattg), and toxinB-900-BamHI-sense (cggatcctttattaataaagaaactggagaatc) and toxinB-2366-XhoI-antisense (cctcgagctattcactaatcactaattg), respectively. The generated PCR products were cloned into pGEX4T-1 vector (toxin B-(544–2366)) and pGEX2T vector (toxin B-(900–2366)) (Amersham Biosciences). Toxin B fragment 1–544 was cloned as already described (14Egerer M. Giesemann T. Jank T. Satchell K.J. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 25314-25321Google Scholar, 18Pfeifer G. Schirmer J.

Generation of Point Mutations within the Recombinant Toxin B-(1–955) and Toxin B-(544–955)—Point mutations within pET-28a toxin B-(1–955) and pET-28a toxin B-(544–955) were produced using QuikChange mutagenesis method (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid DNA was prepared using standard procedures and sequenced with ABI PRISM™ dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit and an ABI 310 cycle sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Rodgau-Jügesheim, Germany) to confirm gene sequence. Expression and Purification of Native and Recombinant Proteins—For purification of the native toxins A and B, C. difficile VPI 10463 was grown under anaerobic conditions, and the proteins were separated by ammonium sulfate precipitation from the culture supernatant. Toxin A and toxin B were separated by anion exchange chromatography (21Just I. Selzer J. Hofmann F. Aktories K. Aktories K. Bacterial Toxins-Tools in Cell Biology and Pharmacology. Chapman & Hall, Weinheim1997Google Scholar). Toxin A was additionally purified by thyroglobulin affinity chromatography, based on the high affinity of the toxin to Galα1–3Galβ1–4GlcNac (22Krivan H.C. Wilkins T.D. Infect. Immun.. 1987; 55: 1873-1877Google Scholar). All recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). Toxin B-(1–955), toxin B-(544–955) and toxin B-(579–777) transformed E. coli cells were induced at A600 = 1 with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and the His fusion proteins were expressed for 3 h at 29 °C. Purification was performed by affinity chromatography with Protino®-Ni-IDA (Macherey-Nagel GmbH & Co. KG, Düren, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins toxin B-(1–543), toxin B-(544–2366), and toxin B-(900–2366) were expressed overnight at 29 °C after induction at A600 = 0.6–0.8 with 200 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The recombinant GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's instructions. N-terminal His and GST tags were removed by thrombin cleavage, followed by inactivation of thrombin utilizing benzamidine beads. Note E. coli-expressed toxin B-(544–955) had an N-terminal and a C-terminal His tag; only the N-terminal His-tag was cleaved (toxin B-(544–955)-His). Toxin B-(1–955) and toxin B-(544–955)-His wild-type protein and mutants were additionally purified by anion exchange chromatography (Resource™ Q, Amersham Biosciences) and gel filtration (Superdex™ 200, Amersham Biosciences), respectively. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF. Concentrations of different protein preparations were estimated by the Bradford reagent (supplemental Fig. S1). In Vitro Cleavage Assay and Western Blotting—Cleavage assays were performed in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, at a final volume of 20 μl with 1 μg of toxin B. Reactions were initiated by addition of InsP6 or InsS6 at indicated final concentrations and were incubated for 30 min at 23 °C. The reaction was stopped by heating the samples at 95 °C in Laemmli buffer, and probes were separated by SDS-PAGE (3–12% gradient gel). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane with a semi-dry blotter (Bio-Rad). Monoclonal anti-toxin B-(1–546) antibody at a dilution of 1:100,000 followed by the anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (1:5000; Biotrend, Cologne, Germany) was used for detection of the catalytic domain of toxin B. Corresponding bands were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). In Vitro Transcription/Translation of Toxin B Fragments—The in vitro transcription/translation was performed with EasyXpress™ Protein Synthesis Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) using radioactive labeled l-[14C]leucine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following a 60-min incubation at 37 °C, 10 μl of the lysate were incubated with or without 10 mm InsP6 for 30 min at 23 °C. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and labeled proteins visualized by autoradiography (Phosphorimager, GE Healthcare). Filter Binding Assay with Radioactive Labeled [3H]InsP6—Binding of [3H]InsP6 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was assayed in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, with a mixture of 100 nm [3H]InsP6 and 29.9 μm unlabeled InsP6 and 0.5 μm protein. Additionally, 50 μg of bovine serum albumin was added to all samples with toxins and toxin fragments. After incubation for 10 min at 4 °C, reactions were terminated by rapid vacuum filtration through pre-wetted 0.45 μm nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman GmbH, Dassel, Germany) followed by washing with 3 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer to separate free and bound [3H]InsP6. Membrane-bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. For saturation assays, toxin B fragment (544–955)-His (0.5 μm) was incubated with increasing concentrations of InsP6 for 10 min at 4 °C. Bound [3H]InsP6 was measured as described above. For competition assays 0.5 μm toxin B fragment 1–955 H653A/C698A was incubated with 100 nm [3H]InsP6 for 10 min at 4 °C. Specific binding of [3H]InsP6 to toxin B fragments was challenged with different concentrations of unlabeled InsP6, inositol hexakissulfate (InsS6), inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) and GTPγS by further incubation for 30 min at 4 °C. Bound [3H]InsP6 was measured as described above. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—The interaction between InsP6 and toxin B fragment (544–955)-His was characterized by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC200, MicroCal, Milton Keynes, UK) using LEW-buffer pH 8.0 (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl) at 20 °C. The cell was filled with 36 μm protein and from the syringe 2-μl aliquots of 300 μm InsP6 were injected. As a control, the same InsP6 solution was injected into the cell filled with buffer only. For data evaluation, the manufacturer's software was used. Proteinase K Digestion Assay—Toxin B fragment 544–955 and the mutant toxin B-(544–955)-K600E were expressed with TnT®-coupled Reticulocyte Lysate Systems from Promega (Madison, WI) by using radioactive labeled l-[14C]leucine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Following 90 min of incubation at 30 °C, 3 μl of the lysate were incubated with or without 10 mm InsP6 for 30 min at 23 °C. Digestion was performed with proteinase K (25 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 10 min and was inhibited with phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride for 2 min at 4 °C. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Signals were visualized by autoradiography. We expressed the C. difficile toxin B fragment 1–955 by in vitro transcription/translation. When InsP6 was added to this toxin fragment, cleavage was induced (Fig. 1A). As expected, mutations (D587N, H653A, C698A) of the putative catalytic cysteine protease triad inhibited cleavage of mutants (Fig. 1B). The concentration of InsP6 to stimulate autocleavage was in the same range as observed previously for autocatalytic cleavage of the holotoxin (12Reineke J. Tenzer S. Rupnik M. Koschinski A. Hasselmayer O. Schrattenholz A. Schild H. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Nature.. 2007; 446: 415-419Google Scholar) starting at ∼1 μm. These data indicated that InsP6 acts in a region encompassed by amino acids 1–955. Because of the evident potency of InsP6 to cleave toxin B, we were prompted to study direct binding of InsP6 to the protein toxin. For this purpose several toxin fragments, as well as the holotoxin B (see Fig. 2, A and B; supplemental Fig. S1) were incubated for 10 min with 30 μm [3H]InsP6, followed by a membrane filter assay. Binding of [3H]InsP6 was observed for the wild-type toxin fragment 1–955 (Fig. 2C) as well as for the holotoxin B albeit to a lower extent than with fragment 1–955. We were not able to detect binding to holotoxin A. This is probably because of the fact that the affinity for InsP6 is lower. Accordingly, it has been reported that much higher concentration of InsP6 (1–10 mm) is necessary for induction of autocleavage of toxin A than for that of toxin B (12Reineke J. Tenzer S. Rupnik M. Koschinski A. Hasselmayer O. Schrattenholz A. Schild H. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Nature.. 2007; 446: 415-419Google Scholar, 14Egerer M. Giesemann T. Jank T. Satchell K.J. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 25314-25321Google Scholar). No binding was detected with the toxin B fragment 900–2366, which starts after the proposed cysteine protease domain (Fig. 2C). This finding is in line with the hypothesis that InsP6 interacts with the N-terminal residues 1–955 of the toxin (14Egerer M. Giesemann T. Jank T. Satchell K.J. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 25314-25321Google Scholar). Previously reported data did not exclude the possibility that InsP6 also interacts with the glucosyltransferase domain of the toxin. Therefore, we separately tested binding of [3H]InsP6 to the glucosyltransferase domain (fragment 1–543) or to the protease domain (toxin fragment (544–955)-His). The glucosyltransferase domain did not exhibit any binding of [3H]InsP6. By contrast, the protease domain was able to bind radioactive labeled InsP6. To further narrow down the region of InsP6 binding, we studied the fragment 579–777 of toxin B. However, this fragment was not able to bind [3H]InsP6 in the filter assay. Finally, we tested binding properties of the fragment 1–955 with mutations at the proposed catalytic residues histidine 653 and cysteine 698 (toxin B H/C), which have been shown to block autoproteolytic activity (14Egerer M. Giesemann T. Jank T. Satchell K.J. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 25314-25321Google Scholar). This double mutant was able to bind [3H]InsP6 in the same manner as the wild-type fragment 1–955. This finding suggests that the protease activity plays no major role in InsP6 binding under the conditions studied. We studied binding in more detail with the minimal toxin B fragment (544–955)-His. A binding saturation experiment was performed with the concentration range of 0.1–300 μm [3H]InsP6 in the presence of 25 pmol of toxin fragment. Saturation was achieved at 30 μm and a half-maximal effect was observed at ∼3 μm (Fig. 3). To obtain precise information about the affinity as well as the stoichiometry of the complex we employed isothermal titration calorimetry (Fig. 4). The titration was carried out twice and yielded Kd values of 2.1 μm and 2.7 μm, respectively, confirming the result obtained with [3H]InsP6. The number obtained for the stoichiometry of the complex (stoichiometry factor of 0.86) indicated that InsP6 binds at a ratio of 1:1 to the toxin. As binding of the wild-type and mutant fragments were similar, we decided to test the specificity of InsP6-binding with the mutant fragment of toxin B (toxin B H/C), because this fragment was not cleaved. Fragment 1–955 (toxin B H/C) was incubated with 100 nm [3H]InsP6 for 10 min, then increasing amounts of unlabeled InsP6, InsP3, inositol hexakissulfate, and GTPγS were added. As shown in Fig. 5A, displacement occurred with the highest potency by InsP6. The rank order of competition of binding of [3H]InsP6 was InsS6 > InsP3 >GTPγS with InsS6 being at least 300-fold less potent than InsP6. This is in line with the previously reported specificity of inositol phosphates to induce toxin cleavage (12Reineke J. Tenzer S. Rupnik M. Koschinski A. Hasselmayer O. Schrattenholz A. Schild H. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Nature.. 2007; 446: 415-419Google Scholar). We also observed that InsS6 not only competed with [3H]InsP6 binding but also induced autocatalytic processing of holotoxin B at high concentrations (Fig. 5B). The highly charged InsP6 is likely to interact with positively charged amino acids of the toxin. We compared the sequences of the putative cysteine protease domains from the various clostridial glucosylating toxins to identify conserved lysine and arginine residues. Accordingly, two lysines (lysine 600 and lysine 689) in the protease domain of toxin B, which were identically positioned in other clostridial toxins and even conserved in the related RTX toxin, were changed to glutamate in the toxin fragment 1–955. We also made a double mutant of two arginine residues (Arg-751/Arg-752), which were either arginine or lysine in the other clostridial toxins or in RTX (supplemental Fig. S2). The mutant toxin fragments (residues 1–955) were expressed as 14C-labeled proteins by in vitro transcription/translation. The cleavage of the labeled proteins was studied in the absence and presence of InsP6 (10 mm). As shown in Fig. 6A, the mutant K600E of fragment 1–955 was not longer cleaved, whereas K689E exhibited no change in cleavage as compared with the wild-type fragment. Also the double mutants R751E/R752E were not cleaved after addition of InsP6. To test the binding of [3H]InsP6, the mutants were expressed in E. coli and purified. In line with the autocleavage results, binding of [3H]InsP6 was observed with wild-type and K689E mutant of fragment 1–955 (Fig. 6B). In contrast, the K600E mutant, which was not autocatalytically cleaved (Fig. 6A), was also not able to bind [3H]InsP6. This result was confirmed by the identical mutation in fragment (544–955)-His of toxin B (Fig. 6B). To detect possible structural consequences of InsP6 binding to the toxin fragment, we performed a proteinase K digestion assay with in vitro transcribed and translated 14C-labeled toxin B fragment 544–955. Proteinase K was able to completely cleave the toxin B fragment. However, when InsP6 was added, a ∼30-kDa fragment remained (Fig. 7). In line with the InsP6 binding data, the K600E mutant of fragment 544–955, which was not able to bind InsP6, was not protected against degradation by proteinase K.FIGURE 7Effects of InsP6 binding on the structure of the cysteine protease domain (CPD) of toxin B. Reticulocyte lysates, containing in vitro translated 14C-labeled toxin B fragment 544–955 or point mutant K600E toxin B fragment 544–955 (50 kDa) were preincubated with InsP6 (10 mm) for 30 min, followed by incubation with or without proteinase K (PK) for 10 min at 4 °C. Proteolysis was monitored by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Addition of InsP6 to the proteins protects a ∼30-kDa fragment from wild-type toxin B fragment 544–955 against degradation by proteinase K, but not the point mutant K600E toxin B fragment 544–955.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Clostridial glucosylating toxins are processed by autocatalytic cleavage. Recent studies suggested a aspartate activity around residue 1665 (12Reineke J. Tenzer S. Rupnik M. Koschinski A. Hasselmayer O. Schrattenholz A. Schild H. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Nature.. 2007; 446: 415-419Google Scholar). However, in analogy with the cysteine protease activity of RTX toxin from Vibrio cholerae,we and others proposed a cysteine protease activity in the region covering residues 544–955 (13Sheahan K.-L. Cordero C.L. Fullner Satchell K.J. EMBO J.. 2007; 26: 2552-2561Google Scholar, 14Egerer M. Giesemann T. Jank T. Satchell K.J. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 25314-25321Google Scholar). To resolve this discrepancy, we undertook studies to determine the localization of the protease activity in toxin B. By using a transcription/translation method different from that applied previously (14Egerer M. Giesemann T. Jank T. Satchell K.J. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 25314-25321Google Scholar), we were able to express uncleaved toxin B fragment 1–955. When InsP6 was added to this fragment, cleavage of the toxin B fragment into two parts was detected. Moreover, this processing was blocked with mutants of the putative active site of the cysteine protease. The data corroborate our previous hypothesis that autocatalytic cleavage is caused by a putative cysteine protease located in the region 544–955. Although the precise function of InsP6 is not clear, this highly charged molecule might activate cleavage by inducing structural changes in the protease domain and perhaps also in the glucosyltransferase domain. To gain further insights into the role of InsP6, we performed binding studies with radioactive labeled InsP6. We detected binding of InsP6 in the protease domain but not in the catalytic domain. Moreover, a toxin B fragment, consisting of the glucosyltransferase domain and the protease domain, exhibited similar binding properties as the protease activity domain alone, indicating that the N-terminal glucosyltransferase has no effect on InsP6 binding. Binding was also observed with mutants (H653A and C698A) of the protease active site, indicating that the enzyme activity of the protease is not essential for binding. The binding saturation experiment performed with [3H]InsP6 as well as data obtained by isothermal titration calorimetry suggested that binding is stoichiometric (1:1). Furthermore, competition experiments showed high affinity binding of InsP6 with a half-maximal displacement of the prebound [3H]InsP6 with unlabeled InsP6 at about 1–3 μm. Again these data were confirmed by isothermal titration calorimetry. Although enhancement of cleavage was achieved at high concentrations (1 mm) of InsS6, this compound and also InsP3 were several orders of magnitude less potent to compete with InsP6. Similarly, while it has been shown that guanine nucleotides facilitated cleavage of the related RTX toxin (13Sheahan K.-L. Cordero C.L. Fullner Satchell K.J. EMBO J.. 2007; 26: 2552-2561Google Scholar), GTPγS was a poor competitor of InsP6 in the binding assay with the toxin B fragment. We identified lysine 600 as an essential residue for binding of InsP6. This residue is conserved in all clostridial glucosylating toxins and also in the RTX toxin. In line with the InsP6-binding data, we observed that the Lys-600 mutants of fragment 1–955 were not cleaved in the presence of InsP6. Additionally, we observed that change of Arg-751/Arg-752 to glutamate blocked cleavage of the toxin fragment in the presence of InsP6. We propose that these residues are also involved in interaction with InsP6 (see below). Altogether, the data indicate that inhibition of InsP6 binding also blocks autocatalytic cleavage of the toxin fragment. So far the molecular mechanism of the action of InsP6 on the cysteine protease activity of toxin B is not clear. It has been shown that InsP6 can cause major changes in the structure of proteins after binding (23Datta S.A. Zhao Z. Clark P.K. Tarasov S. Alexandratos J.N. Campbell S.J. Kvaratskhelia M. Lebowitz J. Rein A. J. Mol. Biol.. 2007; 365: 799-811Google Scholar). More recently, the crystal structure of cysteine protease domain of the V. cholerae RTX toxin in complex with InsP6 has been solved (24Lupardus P.J. Shen A. Bogyo M. Garcia K.C. Science.. 2008; 322: 265-268Google Scholar). Deduced from this study it has been suggest that InsP6 causes an allosteric switch, which activates the cysteine protease domain of RTX. Major changes in the structure of the cysteine protease domain also appear to occur after binding of InsP6 to toxin B as evidenced from the effect of InsP6 on the protein stability in the presence of proteinase K. Addition of InsP6 prevented complete degradation of the protease domain (residues 544–955) of toxin B by proteinase K. The effect was specific for InsP6 and was not observed with the mutant fragment of toxin B, which is not able to bind InsP6, excluding the possible action of the highly charged compound on proteinase K activity or on chelation of cations. Mass spectrometric data suggest that the ∼30-kDa fragment covers at least amino acid residues 544–798 (data not shown). Prochazkova and Satchell (25Prochazkova K. Satchell K.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2008; 283: 23656-23664Google Scholar) reported recently on the binding of InsP6 to the cysteine protease domain of RTX toxin. Similar as reported here, the authors found that the equivalent residue in RTX to that of Lys-600 of toxin B is also important for interaction with InsP6. However, our findings with toxin B differ in several important aspects from that reported for RTX toxin. Prochazkova and Satchell (25Prochazkova K. Satchell K.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2008; 283: 23656-23664Google Scholar) suggested that InsP6 interacts in a catalytic manner with RTX protease and is released after cleavage. Therefore, the RTX protease domain by itself is not able to bind InsP6 after cleavage and also inactive RTX protease cannot bind InsP6. In contrast, we observed binding with the protease domain in the absence of the glucosyltransferase domain. Furthermore, mutants of the active site of the cysteine protease of toxin B were still able to bind InsP6. The recently obtained crystal structure of the cysteine protease domain of RTX toxin (24Lupardus P.J. Shen A. Bogyo M. Garcia K.C. Science.. 2008; 322: 265-268Google Scholar) confirms the role of conserved lysine (e.g. Lys-600 in toxin B and Lys-3482 in RTX) and arginine (e.g. Arg-751 in toxin B and Arg-3610 in RTX) residues in binding of InsP6. The structural data may also explain why no InsP6-binding was obtained with a fragment of toxin B, consisting of amino acids 579–777, which includes the proposed catalytic residues of the protease and the region that is highly similar to the autocatalytic protease domain of the RTX toxin. However, this fragment lacks additional N-terminal and C-terminal residues, which appear to be involved in InsP6 binding in the related RTX toxin (e.g. residues Arg-575 and Lys-788 of toxin B might be equivalent to the essential residues Arg-3457 and Lys-3628 in RTX) (supplemental Fig. S2). Although surprising similarities exist between toxin B and the distantly related protease domain of RTX, even among the family of clostridial glucosylating toxins major differences in the interaction of InsP6 with the protease domain are evident. For example, InsP6 exhibits ∼1,000-fold lower potency in activation of the autocatalytic processing of toxin A, as compared with toxin B (12Reineke J. Tenzer S. Rupnik M. Koschinski A. Hasselmayer O. Schrattenholz A. Schild H. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Nature.. 2007; 446: 415-419Google Scholar, 14Egerer M. Giesemann T. Jank T. Satchell K.J. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 25314-25321Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the various clostridial toxins differ in their mode of activation of their autocatalytic protease domain.

https://openalex.org/W2093499426,"Background Adult neurogenesis occurs in specific regions of the mammalian brain such as the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. In the neurogenic region, neural progenitor cells continuously divide and give birth to new neurons. Although biological properties of neurons and glia in the hippocampus have been demonstrated to fluctuate depending on specific times of the day, it is unclear if neural progenitors and neurogenesis in the adult brain are temporally controlled within the day. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we demonstrate that in the dentate gyrus of the adult mouse hippocampus, the number of M-phase cells shows a day/night variation throughout the day, with a significant increase during the nighttime. The M-phase cell number is constant throughout the day in the subventricular zone of the forebrain, another site of adult neurogenesis, indicating the daily rhythm of progenitor mitosis is region-specific. Importantly, the nighttime enhancement of hippocampal progenitor mitosis is accompanied by a nighttime increase of newborn neurons. Conclusions/Significance These results indicate that neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus occurs in a time-of-day-dependent fashion, which may dictate daily modifications of dentate gyrus physiology."
https://openalex.org/W1989834597,"Choline is an essential nutrient that serves as a donor of metabolic methyl groups used during gestation to establish the epigenetic DNA methylation patterns that modulate tissue-specific gene expression. Because the mammary gland begins its development prenatally, we hypothesized that choline availability in utero may affect the gland's susceptibility to cancer. During gestational days 11-17, pregnant rats were fed a control, choline-supplemented, or choline-deficient diet (8, 36, and 0 mmol/kg of choline, respectively). On postnatal day 65, the female offspring received 25 mg/kg of a carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz[alpha]anthracene. Approximately 70% of the rats developed mammary adenocarcinomas; prenatal diet did not affect tumor latency, incidence, size, and multiplicity. Tumor growth rate was inversely related to choline content in the prenatal diet, resulting in 50% longer survival until euthanasia, determined by tumor size, of the prenatally choline-supplemented rats compared with the prenatally choline-deficient rats. This was accompanied by distinct expression patterns of approximately 70 genes in tumors derived from the three dietary groups. Tumors from the prenatally choline-supplemented rats overexpressed genes that confer favorable prognosis in human cancers (Klf6, Klf9, Nid2, Ntn4, Per1, and Txnip) and underexpressed those associated with aggressive disease (Bcar3, Cldn12, Csf1, Jag1, Lgals3, Lypd3, Nme1, Ptges2, Ptgs1, and Smarcb1). DNA methylation within the tumor suppressor gene, stratifin (Sfn, 14-3-3sigma), was proportional to the prenatal choline supply and correlated inversely with the expression of its mRNA and protein in tumors, suggesting that an epigenetic mechanism may underlie the altered molecular phenotype and tumor growth. Our results suggest a role for adequate maternal choline nutrition during pregnancy in prevention/alleviation of breast cancer in daughters."

The molecular mechanisms regulating this process, however, remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we sought to define the responses evoked in endothelial cells exposed to shear stress waveforms characteristic of coronary collateral vessels and the subsequent paracrine effects on smooth muscle cells. A lumped parameter model of the human coronary collateral circulation was used to simulate normal and adaptive remodeling coronary collateral shear stress waveforms. These waveforms were then applied to cultured human endothelial cells (EC), and the resulting differences in EC gene expression were assessed by genome-wide transcriptional profiling to identify genes distinctly regulated by collateral flow. Analysis of these transcriptional programs identified several genes to be differentially regulated by collateral flow, including genes important for endothelium-smooth muscle interactions. In particular, the transcription factor KLF2 was up-regulated by the adaptive remodeling coronary collateral waveform, and several of its downstream targets displayed the expected modulation, including the down-regulation of connective tissue growth factor. To assess the effect of endothelial KLF2 expression on smooth muscle cell migration, a three-dimensional microfluidic assay was developed. Using this three-dimensional system, we showed that KLF2-expressing EC co-cultured with SMC significantly reduce SMC migration compared with control EC and that this reduction can be rescued by the addition of exogenous connective tissue growth factor. Collectively, these results demonstrate that collateral flow evokes distinct EC gene expression profiles and functional phenotypes that subsequently influence vascular events important for adaptive remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2052168634,"Background Genetically encoded tag is a powerful tool for protein research. Various kinds of tags have been developed: fluorescent proteins for live-cell imaging, affinity tags for protein isolation, and epitope tags for immunological detections. One of the major problems concerning the protein tagging is that many constructs with different tags have to be made for different applications, which is time- and resource-consuming. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we report a novel multifunctional green fluorescent protein (mfGFP) tag which was engineered by inserting multiple peptide tags, i.e., octa-histidine (8×His), streptavidin-binding peptide (SBP), and c-Myc tag, in tandem into a loop of GFP. When fused to various proteins, mfGFP monitored their localization in living cells. Streptavidin agarose column chromatography with the SBP tag successfully isolated the protein complexes in a native form with a high purity. Tandem affinity purification (TAP) with 8×His and SBP tags in mfGFP further purified the protein complexes. mfGFP was clearly detected by c-Myc-specific antibody both in immunofluorescence and immuno-electron microscopy (EM). These findings indicate that mfGFP works well as a multifunctional tag in mammalian cells. The tag insertion was also successful in other fluorescent protein, mCherry. Conclusions and Significance The multifunctional fluorescent protein tag is a useful tool for a wide variety of protein research, and may have the advantage over other multiple tag systems in its higher expandability and compatibility with existing and future tag technologies."
https://openalex.org/W2021593111,"Small GTPases of the Rho family play versatile roles in the formation and development of axons and dendrites, effects often studied by the Rho-inactivating C3 transferase (C3bot) from Clostridium botulinum. Recently, we reported that transferase-deficient C3bot also exerted axonotrophic activity. Using overlapping peptides from the C3bot sequence, we identified a small peptide of 29 amino acids (covering residues 154-182) from the C-terminal region of C3bot that promotes both axonal and dendritic growth, as well as branching of hippocampal neurons, at submicromolar concentrations. Several C3bot constructs, including the short peptide, enhanced the number of axonal segments from mid- to higher-order segments. C3bot(154-182) also increased the number of synaptophysin-expressing terminals, up-regulated various synaptic proteins, and functionally increased the glutamate uptake. Staining against the vesicular glutamate and GABA transporters further revealed that the effect was attributable to a higher number of glutamatergic and GABAergic inputs on proximal dendrites of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-transfected neurons. Using organotypical slice cultures, we also detected trophic effects of C3bot(154-182) on length and density of outgrowing fibers from the entorhinal cortex that were comparable to the effects elicited by full-length C3bot. In addition, an enhanced reinnervation was observed in a hippocampal-entorhinal lesion model. In summary, the neurotrophic effect of C3bot is executed by a C-terminal peptide fragment covering aa 154-182 of C3; it triggers dendritic and axonal growth and branching as well as increased synaptic connectivity. In contrast to full-length C3, this C3 peptide selectively acts on neurons but not on glial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1971965689,"Factor VIIIa functions as a cofactor for factor IXa in the phospholipid surface-dependent activation of factor X. Both the C2 domain of factor VIIIa and the Gla domain of factor IXa are involved in phospholipid binding and are required for the activation of factor X. In this study, we have examined the close relationship between these domains in the factor Xase complex. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based and surface plasmon resonance-based assays in the absence of phospholipid showed that Glu-Gly-Arg active site-modified factor IXa bound to immobilized recombinant C2 domain (rC2) dose-dependently (Kd = 108 nm). This binding ability was optimal under physiological conditions. A monoclonal antibody against the Gla domain of factor IXa inhibited binding by ∼95%, and Gla domainless factor IXa failed to bind to rC2. The addition of monoclonal antibody or rC2 with factor VIIIa inhibited factor IXa-catalyzed factor X activation in the absence of phospholipid. Inhibition was not evident, however, in similar experiments in the absence of factor VIIIa, indicating that the C2 domain interacted with the Gla domain of factor IXa. A fragment designated C2-(2182–2259), derived from V8 protease-cleaved rC2, bound to Glu-Gly-Arg active site-modified factor IXa. Competitive assays, using overlapping synthetic peptides encompassing residues 2182–2259, demonstrated that peptide 2228–2240 significantly inhibited both this binding and factor Xa generation, independently of phospholipid. Our results indicated that residues 2228–2240 in the factor VIIIa C2 domain constitutes an interactive site for the Gla domain of factor IXa. The findings provide the first evidence for an essential role for this interaction in factor Xase assembly.

Factor VIII, a plasma protein that participates in the blood coagulation cascade, is deficient or defective in individuals with hemophilia A. Factor VIII circulates in plasma as a noncovalent complex with VWF, 2The abbreviations used are: VWF, von Willebrand factor; Gla, γ-carboxyglutamic acid; rC2, recombinant C2 domain; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; GDless, Gla domainless; EGR-ck, Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethylketone; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; LC/MS, liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry; EGR-factor IXa, Glu-Gly-Arg active site-modified factor IXa; EGR-GDless factor IXa, Glu-Gly-Arg active site-modified Gla domainless factor IXa; BSA, bovine serum albumin; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; mAb, monoclonal antibody. which stabilizes the synthesis and activity of the cofactor. Mature factor VIII is synthesized as a single chain polypeptide of ∼300 kDa consisting of 2,332 amino acid residues (1Toole J.J. Knopf J.L. Wozney J.M. Sultzman L.A. Buecker J.L. Pittman D.D.

Based on internal homologies of the amino acid sequence, factor VIII has three types of domains arranged in the order of A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2 (3Vehar G.A. Keyt B. Eaton D. Rodriguez H. O'Brien D.P.

Factor VIII circulates in the plasma as a heterodimer of a heavy chain, consisting of the A1, A2, and heterogeneous fragments of partially proteolyzed B domains, together with a light chain consisting of the A3, C1, and C2 domains (1Toole J.J. Knopf J.L. Wozney J.M. Sultzman L.A. Buecker J.L. Pittman D.D. Kaufman R.J. Brown E. Shoemaker C. Orr E.C. Amphlett G.W. Foster W.B. Coe M.L. Knudson G.J. Fass D.N. Hewick R.M.

Nature.. 1984; 312: 337-342Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal 159 amino acids of factor VIII comprise the C2 domain, which is involved in binding to both VWF (4Shima M. Scandella D. Yoshioka A.

Binding in this domain appears to be competitive and mutually exclusive (4Shima M. Scandella D. Yoshioka A. Nakai H. Tanaka I. Kamisue S. Terada S. Fukui H. Thromb. Haemost.. 1993; 69: 240-246Google Scholar, 5Saenko E.L. Shima M. Rajalakshmi K.J. Scandella D. J. Biol. Chem.. 1994; 269: 11601-11605Google Scholar, 8Nogami K. Shima M. Nakai H. Tanaka I. Suzuki H.

J. Hematol.. 2007; 85: 317-322Google Scholar). The C2 domain has also been shown to participate in binding to factor Xa and thrombin (10Nogami K. Shima M. Hosokawa K. Nagata M. Koide T. Saenko E.L. Tanaka I. Shibata M. Yoshioka A. J. Biol. Chem.. 2000; 275: 25774-25780Google Scholar, 11Nogami K. Shima M. Hosokawa K. Suzuki T. Koide T. Saenko E.L. Scandella D. Shibata M. Kamisue S. Tanaka I. Yoshioka A. J. Biol. Chem.. 1999; 274: 31000-31007Google Scholar). Additionally, a major epitope for allo- and autoantibodies and for monoclonal antibodies has been located within the C2 domain (4Shima M. Scandella D. Yoshioka A. Nakai H. Tanaka I. Kamisue S. Terada S. Fukui H. Thromb. Haemost.. 1993; 69: 240-246Google Scholar, 6Shima M. Nakai H. Scandella D. Tanaka I. Sawamoto Y. Kamisue S. Morichika S. Murakami T. Yoshioka A. Br. J.

Blood.. 1998; 92: 3701-3709Google Scholar), indicating that this region could be an antigenic “hot spot.” Consequently, important aspects of the expression and regulation of factor VIII appear to be governed by the structure and function of the C2 domain. Factor VIIIa functions as a cofactor for factor IXa in the anionic, phospholipid surface-dependent conversion of factor X to Xa. In intrinsic factor Xase, factor VIIIa binds to factor IXa and increases the kcat for factor Xa formation by several orders of magnitude compared with factor IXa alone (13van Dieijen G. Tans G. Rosing J. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem.. 1981; 256: 3433-3442Google Scholar). The A2 domain of factor VIIIa interacts with the catalytic domain of factor IXa, and the A3 domain interacts with the first epidermal growth factor domain (14Schmidt A.E. Bajaj S.P. Trends Cardiovasc. Med.. 2003; 13: 39-45Google Scholar). Although the affinity of isolated A2 for factor IXa is low (Kd ∼ 300 nm), it amplifies the enzyme activity of factor IXa by modulating an active site in the catalytic domain, and this interaction defines the cofactor activity of factor VIIIa (15Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem.. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Google Scholar). Factor IXa-interactive sites in the A2 domain are located in at least three regions, within residues 484–509 (16Fay P.J. Scandella D. J. Biol. Chem.. 1999; 274: 29826-29830Google Scholar), 558–565 (17Fay P.J. Beattie T. Huggins C.F. Regan L.M. J. Biol. Chem.. 1994; 269: 20522-20527Google Scholar), and 708–717 (18Jenkins P.V. Dill J.L. Zhou Q. Fay P.J. Biochemistry.. 2004; 43: 5094-5101Google Scholar), respectively. In contrast, the high affinity (Kd ∼ 15 nm) of the isolated factor VIIIa light chain for factor IXa provides the majority of the binding energy for this interaction. To date, one region within the A3 domain, residues 1804–1818, has been identified as a factor IXa-interactive site (19Lenting P.J. Donath M.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem.. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Google Scholar, 20Lenting P.J. van de Loo J.W. Donath M.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem.. 1996; 271: 1935-1940Google Scholar). Recently, Blostein et al. (21Blostein M.D. Furie B.C. Rajotte I. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem.. 2003; 278: 31297-31302Google Scholar) demonstrated that the light chain of factor VIIIa interacts with the Gla domain of factor IXa, which contains 12 post-translationally modified glutamic acid residues (γ-carboxyglutamic acid) and functions in calcium-dependent phospholipid binding (22Freedman S.J. Blostein M.D. Baleja J.D. Jacobs M. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem.. 1996; 271: 16227-16236Google Scholar). However, the site in the light chain of factor VIIIa responsible for interaction with the Gla domain of factor IXa remains to be identified. The C2 domain of factor VIIIa and the Gla domain of factor IXa are involved in phospholipid binding, and both bound sequences could be aligned structurally close. We speculated, therefore, that the C2 domain of factor VIIIa might interact with the Gla domain of factor IXa in the factor Xase complex. In the present study, we have examined the interaction between the C2 domain of factor VIIIa and the Gla domain of factor IXa in the factor Xase complex, using a combination of functional and binding assays employing recombinant C2 domain (rC2), V8 protease-digested C2 fragments, synthetic peptides, and monoclonal antibodies. Our results indicated that residues 2228–2240 in the C2 domain contain an interactive site for the Gla domain of factor IXa. The findings provide the first evidence for an essential role of this interaction in factor Xase assembly. Reagents—Purified recombinant factor VIII was a generous gift from Bayer Corp. (Osaka, Japan). Two monoclonal antibodies, mAb IXa-GD, against the Gla domain of factor IXa and specific for calcium-dependent conformation, and mAb 3A6 against the heavy chain of factor IXa, were prepared (23Sugo T. Mizuguchi J. Kamikubo Y. Matsuda M. Thromb. Res.. 1990; 58: 603-614Google Scholar, 24Mimuro J. Mizukami H. Ono F. Madoiwa S. Terao K. Yoshioka A. Ozawa K. Sakata Y. J. Thromb. Haemost.. 2004; 2: 275-280Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody, ESH8, against the C2 domain of factor VIII and recognizing residues 2248–2285 (4Shima M. Scandella D. Yoshioka A. Nakai H. Tanaka I. Kamisue S. Terada S. Fukui H. Thromb. Haemost.. 1993; 69: 240-246Google Scholar, 5Saenko E.L. Shima M. Rajalakshmi K.J. Scandella D. J. Biol. Chem.. 1994; 269: 11601-11605Google Scholar) was purchased from American Diagnostica Inc. (Stamford, CT). A horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled monoclonal antibody was prepared using Peroxidase Labeling Kit-NH2 (Dojindo Molecular Technologies Inc., Kumamoto, Japan). Human factor IXa, factor X, and EGR-ck (Hematologic Technologies, Inc., Essex Junction, VT), factor Xa (Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc., South Bend, IN), thrombin (Sigma), recombinant hirudin (Calbiochem), and chromogenic Xa substrate S-2222 (Chromogenix, Milano, Italy) were purchased commercially. Gla domainless (GDless) factor IXa was prepared from factor IXa by limited chymotryptic digestion (25Morita T. Kisiel W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 1985; 130: 841-847Google Scholar). Briefly, α-chymotrypsin was incubated with factor IXa in a 1:24 ratio (w/w) at 4 °C. The reaction was then quenched using 5 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, and the GDless factor IXa was separated from undigested factor IXa and the Gla domain-containing peptide (residues 1–42) using ion exchange chromatography. Molecular mass was estimated by SDS-PAGE. The amidolytic activity of GDless factor IXa was less than 0.2%. Phospholipid vesicles containing 10% phosphatidylserine, 60% phosphatidylcholine, and 30% phosphatidylethanolamine (Sigma) were prepared using N-octyl glucoside (26Mimms L.T. Zampighi G. Nozaki Y. Tanford C. Reynolds J.A. Biochemistry.. 1981; 20: 833-840Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides consisting of overlapping sequences of 13 residues encompassing 2182–2249 within the factor VIII C2 domain were prepared by Biosynthesis (Lewisville, TX). They were purified by reverse phase HPLC (purity >95%) and were confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis. Construction, Expression, and Purification of Factor VIII rC2—The rC2 was prepared using the protocol described by Takeshima et al. (27Takeshima K. Smith C. Tait J. Fujikawa K. Thromb. Haemost.. 2003; 89: 788-794Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA encoding the C2 domain of human factor VIII with a 4-amino acid NH2-terminal extension (Val2169–Tyr2332) was constructed, transformed, and expressed in Pichia pastoris cells. The product was purified using ammonium sulfate fractionation and cation exchange HPLC (TSKGEL CM-3SW; TOSOH Corp., Tokyo, Japan). SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated >95% purity. The rC2 protein was identified as a single peak by a gel filtration and had a mass 18,626.6 on LC/MS analysis, closely matching the expected mass of 18,627.3. Preparation of EGR-GDless Factor IXa—Factor IXa (10 μm) or GDless factor IXa (2.3 μm) was inactivated overnight at 4 °C by the addition of a 20-fold molar excess of EGR-ck in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.01% Tween 20 (HBS buffer). Unbound EGR-ck was removed by extensive dialysis at 4 °C in the same buffer. Chromogenic assays demonstrated less than 0.2% residual activity of factor IXa or GDless factor IXa, respectively. Preparation of rC2 Proteolytic Fragments—The rC2 (16.7 μm) was digested for 96 h at 37 °C with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease (5.4 μm; Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Osaka, Japan) in 100 mm Tris-Tricine, pH 8.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% SDS. The digest was treated with the SDS-Out™ precipitation kit (Pierce) to remove the SDS and was fractionated by reverse phase HPLC using TSKgel ODS-100Z (5 μm; Tosoh Corp.). The reaction mixture was loaded onto a column equilibrated with 90% distilled H2O, 10% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted with a linear gradient of 10–50% acetonitrile over 60 min. Fragments were detected at 216 nm and automatically collected in 500-μl aliquots and lyophilized. The fragments exhibited excellent solubility following their resuspension in HBS buffer. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem.. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Electrophoresis of the purified fragments followed by staining with GelCode Blue Stain Reagent (Pierce) showed >95% purity. ELISA-based Binding Assay—Microtiter wells were coated with 200 nm rC2 (100 μl) in 100 mm sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.6, overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed with HBS buffer and were blocked with the same buffer containing 5% BSA for 2 h at 37 °C. EGR-factor IXa or EGR-GDless factor IXa was then added and incubated in HBS buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 5% BSA for 2 h at 37 °C. Bound EGR-factor IXa was quantified by the addition of HRP-labeled anti-factor IXa mAb 3A6 and o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride substrate. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 2 m H2SO4, and absorbances were measured at 492 nm using a Labsystems Multiskan Multisoft microplate reader (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland). Control experiments demonstrated that mAb 3A6 did not affect the reaction between factor VIII and factor IXa (data not shown). The amount of nonspecific binding of HRP-labeled IgG in the absence of factor VIII was <5% of the total signal. Specific binding was recorded after subtracting the nonspecific binding. In competitive inhibition assays, the competitor proteins were incubated with 100 nm EGR-factor IXa for 2 h at 37 °C prior to the addition to immobilized rC2. The percentage of inhibition was calculated using the equation, (bound absorbance – nonspecific absorbance)/(maximum – nonspecific) × 100 (%). Absorbance in the absence of competitive protein or immobilized rC2 was regarded as maximum or nonspecific, respectively. SPR-based Binding Assay—The kinetics of rC2 and EGR-factor IXa interaction were determined in SPR-based assays using a Biacore X instrument (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). EGR-factor IXa was covalently coupled to the surface of a CM5 chip at a coupling density of ∼7 ng/mm2. Binding (association) of the ligand was monitored in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.005% surfactant P20, at a flow rate of 20 μl/min for 2 min at 37 °C. The dissociation of bound ligand was monitored for a 2-min period by replacing the ligand-containing buffer with buffer alone. The level of nonspecific binding corresponding to ligand binding to the uncoated chip was subtracted from the signal. The rate constants for association (ka) and dissociation (kd) were determined by nonlinear regression analysis (29Karlsson R. Anal. Biochem.. 1994; 221: 142-151Google Scholar, 30O'Shannessy D.J. Brigham-Burke M. Soneson K.K. Hensley P. Brooks I. Anal. Biochem.. 1993; 212: 457-468Google Scholar) using the evaluation software provided by Biacore AB. Equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated as kd/ka. Factor Xa Generation Assays—The rate of conversion of factor X to factor Xa was monitored in a purified system (18Jenkins P.V. Dill J.L. Zhou Q. Fay P.J. Biochemistry.. 2004; 43: 5094-5101Google Scholar, 31Nogami K. Freas J. Manithody C. Wakabayashi H. Rezaie A.R. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 33104-33113Google Scholar). Factor Xa was generated at 22 °C in HBS buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.1% BSA. For assays in the absence of phospholipid, 200 nm factor VIII was activated by 10 nm thrombin. Thrombin activity was inhibited after 1 min by the addition of 2.5 units/ml hirudin, and factor Xa generation was initiated by the addition of 5 nm factor IXa and 1 μm factor X. Experiments in the absence of factor VIIIa were performed under the same conditions except for 20 nm factor IXa. For assays in the presence of phospholipid, 30 nm factor VIII was activated by 10 nm thrombin in the presence of 20 μm phospholipid. Thrombin activity was inhibited after 1 min by hirudin, and factor Xa generation was initiated by the addition of 0.5 nm factor IXa and the indicated amounts of factor X. Aliquots were removed at appropriate times to assess initial rates of product formation and added to tubes containing EDTA (100 mm final concentration) to stop the reaction. Rates of factor Xa generation were determined at 405 nm using a microtiter plate reader after the addition of chromogenic substrate, S-2222 (0.46 mm final concentration). Factor Xa generation was quantified by extrapolation from a standard curve prepared using known amounts of factor Xa. ELISA for Factor VIII or EGR-factor IXa Binding to Phosphatidylserine—ELISA were performed using a minor modification of a previously reported method (7Foster P.A. Fulcher C.A. Houghten R.A. Zimmerman T.S. Blood.. 1990; 75: 1999-2004Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μm 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (Sigma) in methanol was immobilized onto each well of a microtiter plate and allowed to air dry at 4 °C overnight. After washing with HBS buffer, the wells were blocked for 2 h at 37 °C with HBS buffer containing 5% BSA. Factor VIII or EGR-factor IXa was added to each well in HBS buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 5% BSA and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Bound factor VIII was detected using anti-factor VIII mAb ESH8, followed by HRP-labeled anti-mouse second antibody. Bound EGR-factor IXa was detected using HRP-labeled mAb 3A6. NH2-terminal Sequence Analysis—The C2 fragments were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, stained with Gelcode Blue, and excised. NH2-terminal sequence analyses of the purified fragments were performed using an Applied Biosystems model 491 sequencer (Foster City, CA). Samples were subjected to 5 or 7 cycles of automated sequencing. Solvent-accessible Surface Area Analysis—The solvent accessibilities at the interface for the residues 2182–2259 of the C2 domain were calculated from the atomic coordinates using Marc Gerstein's calc-surface program (32Gerstein M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A.. 1992; 48: 271-276Google Scholar) available from the Helix Systems Web site. The atomic coordinates of human factor VIII and C2 domain were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (code 2R7E and 1D7P, respectively). Values that are more positive represent a greater probability of surface exposure. Binding of EGR-factor IXa to the C2 Domain—Blostein et al. (21Blostein M.D. Furie B.C. Rajotte I. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem.. 2003; 278: 31297-31302Google Scholar) have recently reported that the Gla domain of factor IXa interacts with the light chain of factor VIIIa. The C2 domain of factor VIIIa and the Gla domain of factor IXa are involved in phospholipid-binding, and we surmised, therefore, that they could be juxtaposed in the factor Xase complex and that the C2 domain might associate directly with the Gla domain of factor IXa. To investigate this hypothesis, we initially examined the direct binding of factor IXa to immobilized rC2 using microtiter-based, solid phase binding assays. An active site-modified EGR-factor IXa preparation was used in these experiments to eliminate difficulties of interpretation in the presence of enzymatically active factor IXa. Various concentrations of EGR-factor IXa were incubated with immobilized rC2 (200 nm). Bound EGR-factor IXa was detected using anti-factor IXa mAb 3A6, recognizing the heavy chain of its protease. EGR-factor IXa bound to immobilized rC2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Control experiments using an anti-C2 mAb demonstrated that immobilized rC2 was not affected by the ionic strength of the wash buffer or the duration of the wash and incubation steps subsequent to C2 binding (data not shown). To confirm the specificity of this binding, various concentrations of factor VIII or rC2 were preincubated with EGR-factor IXa (100 nm) in the fluid phase prior to addition to the immobilized rC2. Factor VIII and rC2 inhibited EGR-factor IXa binding to immobilized rC2 by ∼90 and ∼60%, respectively (data not shown), confirming specificity of the assay. We further evaluated interactions by an alternative approach using real time SPR-based assays. This technique provides information on kinetic and equilibrium binding constants (29Karlsson R. Anal. Biochem.. 1994; 221: 142-151Google Scholar, 30O'Shannessy D.J. Brigham-Burke M. Soneson K.K. Hensley P. Brooks I. Anal. Biochem.. 1993; 212: 457-468Google Scholar). A range of concentrations of rC2 were added to EGR-factor IXa immobilized onto a sensor chip. Fig. 1B shows representative curves corresponding to the association/dissociation of rC2. The data could be comparatively well fitted by nonlinear regression using a 1:1 binding model with drifting base line. Kinetic constants showed that rC2 bound to EGR-factor IXa with mild affinity (Kd = 108 ± 27 nm, kd/ka = 2.45 × 10–2 s–1/2.36 × 105m–1 s–1). In ELISA-based assays, the apparent Kd value appeared to be higher (∼400 nm), compared with that obtained by SPR-based assays. Since ELISA is not an equilibrium binding assay, the multiple steps of incubation and wash may affect the detection for lower concentrations of EGR-FIXa. The results indicated that the C2 domain of factor VIII interacted directly with factor IXa. Characterization of the Interaction between the C2 Domain and EGR-factor IXa—The light chain of factor VIIIa interacts with factor IXa in electrostatic and calcium-dependent mechanisms (19Lenting P.J. Donath M.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem.. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Google Scholar). To further characterize this interaction, factor IXa (100 nm) was mixed with various amounts of NaCl and incubated with immobilized rC2. Control experiments showed that the amount of immobilized rC2 or the reactivity of antibody was not affected even at a higher concentration of NaCl (data not shown). Binding of EGR-factor IXa to rC2 was maximal at physiological concentrations of NaCl (∼150 mm; Fig. 2A). Higher concentrations of NaCl incrementally weakened this interaction, however, and consequently binding was significantly decreased by ∼95% at elevated ionic strengths, supporting the salt sensitivity of this interaction. The Na+-bound factor IXa drastically enhances catalytic activity toward factor X and increases the affinity for factor VIIIa (33Schmidt A.E. Stewart J.E. Mathur A. Krishnaswamy S. Bajaj S.P. J. Mol. Biol.. 2005; 350: 78-91Google Scholar, 34Dang Q.D. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1996; 93: 10653-10656Google Scholar). However, other monovalent cations, K+ and Li+, also inhibited this binding similarly, suggesting that this effect was not due to a specific interaction of Na+-factor IXa. Ca2+ is known to be required for the structural and functional integrity of factor IXa, and hence the effect of Ca2+ on factor IXa-rC2 interaction was also examined in the current experiments. Binding of factor IXa to immobilized rC2 was investigated in buffer containing various amounts of CaCl2. EDTA (10 mm) was added to the reaction mixtures to assess binding in the absence of Ca2+. The presence of Ca2+ up to ∼1.0 mm markedly increased factor IXa binding by ∼6-fold compared with that in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2B). Optimal binding was observed at approximately physiological concentrations of free Ca2+ (∼1.3 mm). Binding was significantly inhibited by increments of Ca2+ >1 mm. The data were consistent, therefore, with a role for Ca2+ in C2-factor IXa interaction, although it was not possible to distinguish between a direct or indirect role for Ca2+ in mediating this effect. Binding of the Gla Domain of Factor IXa to the C2 Domain—To investigate whether the Gla domain of factor IXa participates in direct interactions with the C2 domain of factor VIII, EGR-GDless factor IXa was prepared by chymotrypsin digestion and EGR-ck labeling, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Control experiments demonstrated that EGR-GD-less factor IXa and EGR-factor IXa were similarly reactive with anti-factor IXa mAb 3A6 in the ELISA (data not shown). The binding of EGR-GDless factor IXa to immobilized rC2 was markedly lower than that of EGR-factor IXa even at the maximum concentration employed (500 nm; Fig. 3A). SPR-based assays also showed that rC2 failed to react with EGR-GDless factor IXa (data not shown). In addition, competitive experiments using an anti-factor IXa mAb, mAb IXa-GD, recognizing the Gla domain of factor IXa and dependent on the presence of Ca2+, demonstrated that the monoclonal antibody blocked binding of EGR-factor IXa to rC2 (up to ∼95%) in a dose-dependent manner (IC50; 758 ± 93 nm) (Fig. 3B). These findings were in keeping with a significant role for the Gla domain of factor IXa in direct binding to the C2 domain of factor VIII. To assess the functional role of the interaction between the C2 domain and Gla domain of factor IXa in the factor Xase complex, we examined the effect of rC2 or mAb IXa-GD on factor VIIIa/factor IXa-mediated activation of factor X in an amidolytic assay. For this assay, 200 nm factor VIII was activated by thrombin and incubated with mixtures of 5 nm factor IXa and various concentrations of rC2 or mAb IXa-GD. Factor Xa generation was initiated by the addition of 1 μm factor X. The rC2 competes with factor VIII for binding to phospholipid membranes, and for this reason, the assays were performed in the absence of phospholipid. The addition of rC2 and mAb IXa-GD markedly decreased the rates of factor Xa generation (by >90%) in a dose-dependent manner, with the IC50 values of 10.9 ± 3.8 μm and 43.2 ± 15.3 nm, respectively (Fig. 4, A and B). To exclude the possibility that rC2 and mAb IXa-GD directly affected factor IXa-catalyzed activation of factor X, factor Xa generation was further examined in the absence of factor VIIIa. As expected, there was little inhibition of facto"

The latter is of clinical interest if the primary tumor is not known.In this study, tissue from colon-derived liver metastases (n = 17) were classified, laser-microdissected, and analysed by ProteinChip arrays (SELDI). The resulting spectra were compared with data for primary colorectal (CRC) and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) from our former studies. Of 49 signals differentially expressed in primary HCC, primary CRC, and liver metastases, two were identified by immunodepletion as S100A6 and S100A11. Both proteins were precisely localized immunohistochemically in cells. S100A6 and S100A11 can discriminate significantly between the two primary tumor entities, CRC and HCC, whereas S100A6 allows the discrimination of metastases and HCC.Both identified proteins can be used to discriminate different tumor entities. Specific markers or proteomic patterns for the metastases of different primary cancers will allow us to determine the biological characteristics of metastasis in general. It is unknown how the protein patterns of tumors change during metastasis or whether markers are present that allow metastases to be allocated to a specific tumor entity.

https://openalex.org/W2074593188,"Clinical, epidemiological, and biochemical studies have highlighted the role of obesity-induced insulin resistance in various metabolic diseases. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be established. In the present study, we show that palmitate-induced serine phosphorylation of phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) negatively regulates insulin signaling. PDK1-mediated Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 in the activation loop is reduced in C2C12 myotubes treated with palmitate or overexpressing protein kinase C theta (PKCtheta), a kinase that has been implicated in hyperlipidemia-induced insulin resistance. Palmitate treatment also inhibited platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated Akt phosphorylation, suggesting that the inhibition could occur at a site independent of IRS1/2. The inhibitory effect of palmitate on PDK1 and Akt was diminished in PKCtheta-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) by treating C2C12 myotubes with PKCtheta pseudosubstrates. In vivo labeling studies revealed that PDK1 undergoes palmitate-induced phosphorylation at two novel sites, Ser504 and Ser532. Replacing Ser504/532 with alanine disrupted PKCtheta-catalyzed PDK1 phosphorylation in vitro and palmitate-induced PDK1 phosphorylation in cells. PDK1-deficient MEFs transiently expressing PDK1S504A/S532A but not PDK1S504E/S532D showed increased basal and insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 when compared with MEFs expressing wild-type PDK1. Taken together, our results identify PDK1 as a novel target in free fatty acid-induced insulin resistance and PKCtheta as the kinase mediating the negative regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2123589240,"Chlorophyll biomass in the surface ocean is regulated by a complex interaction of physiological, oceanographic, and ecological factors and in turn regulates the rates of primary production and export of organic carbon to the deep ocean. Mechanistic models of phytoplankton responses to climate change require the parameterization of many processes of which we have limited knowledge. We develop a statistical approach to estimate the response of remote-sensed ocean chlorophyll to a variety of physical and chemical variables. Irradiance over the mixed layer depth, surface nitrate, sea-surface temperature, and latitude and longitude together can predict 83% of the variation in log chlorophyll in the North Atlantic. Light and nitrate regulate biomass through an empirically determined minimum function explaining nearly 50% of the variation in log chlorophyll by themselves and confirming that either light or macronutrients are often limiting and that much of the variation in chlorophyll concentration is determined by bottom-up mechanisms. Assuming the dynamics of the future ocean are governed by the same processes at work today, we should be able to apply these response functions to future climate change scenarios, with changes in temperature, nutrient distributions, irradiance, and ocean physics."
https://openalex.org/W1987651033,"The intestinal epithelium is repetitively deformed by shear, peristalsis, and villous motility. Such repetitive deformation stimulates the proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells on collagen or laminin substrates via ERK, but the upstream mediators of this effect are poorly understood. We hypothesized that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT cascade mediates this mitogenic effect. PI3K, AKT, and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) were phosphorylated by 10 cycles/min strain at an average 10% deformation, and pharmacologic blockade of these molecules or reduction by small interfering RNA (siRNA) prevented the mitogenic effect of strain in Caco-2 or IEC-6 intestinal epithelial cells. Strain MAPK activation required PI3K but not AKT. AKT isoform-specific siRNA transfection demonstrated that AKT2 but not AKT1 is required for GSK-3beta phosphorylation and the strain mitogenic effect. Furthermore, overexpression of AKT1 or an AKT chimera including the PH domain and hinge region of AKT2 and the catalytic domain and C-tail of AKT1 prevented strain activation of GSK-3beta, but overexpression of AKT2 or a chimera including the PH domain and hinge region of AKT1 and the catalytic domain and C-tail of AKT2 did not. These data delineate a role for PI3K, AKT2, and GSK-3beta in the mitogenic effect of strain. PI3K is required for both ERK and AKT2 activation, whereas AKT2 is sequentially required for GSK-3beta. Furthermore, AKT2 specificity requires its catalytic domain and tail region. Manipulating this pathway may prevent mucosal atrophy and maintain the mucosal barrier in conditions such as ileus, sepsis, and prolonged fasting when peristalsis and villous motility are decreased and the mucosal barrier fails."
https://openalex.org/W1994678168,"Clathrin-coated vesicles are responsible for the trafficking of several internalized biological cargos. We have observed that the endogenous F-actin-linker moesin co-distributes with constitutive components of clathrin-coated structures. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy studies have shown that short interference RNA of moesin enhances the lateral movement of clathrin-coated structures and provokes their abnormal clustering. The aggregation of clathrin-coated structures has also been observed in cells overexpressing N-moesin, a dominant-negative construct unable to bind to F-actin. Only overexpressed moesin constructs with an intact phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-binding domain co-distribute with clathrin-coated structures. Hence, this N-terminal domain is mostly responsible for moesin/clathrin-coated structure association. Biochemical endosome fractioning together with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy comparative studies, between intact cells and plasma-membrane sheets, indicate that moesin knockdown provokes the accumulation of endocytic rab5-clathrin-coated vesicles carrying the transferrin receptor. The altered trafficking of these endocytic rab5-clathrin-coated vesicles accounts for a transferrin receptor recycling defect that reduces cell-surface expression of the transferrin receptor and increases the amount of sequestered transferrin ligand. Therefore, we propose that moesin is a clathrin-coated vesicle linker that drives cargo trafficking and acts on nascent rab5-clathrin-coated vesicles by simultaneously binding to clathrin-coated vesicle-associated phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and actin cytoskeleton.

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a key process that governs the internalization of a plethora of cell-surface receptors in metazoans, such as G-protein-coupled receptors and epithelial growth factor receptors, and is essential for controlling cell integrity, division, and signaling (1Maldonado-Baez L.

Similarly, several lines of evidence have suggested a close association between the endocytic machinery in mammalian cells and the actin cytoskeleton (9Schafer D.A. Curr. Opin.

Cortical actin dynamics is affected by cytoskeleton-associated proteins, such as those responsible for the growth and capping of actin filaments (15Mangeat P. Roy C. Martin M. Trends Cell Biol.. 1999; 9: 187-192Google Scholar). Therefore, the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) proteins from the band 4.1 superfamily are fundamental in determining signaling-induced cell shape, membrane-protein localization, cell adhesion, motility, cytokinesis, phagocytosis, and the integration of membrane transport with signaling pathways (15Mangeat P. Roy C. Martin M. Trends Cell Biol.. 1999; 9: 187-192Google Scholar, 16Bretscher A. Edwards K. Fehon R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2002; 3: 586-599Google Scholar). These ERM functions rely directly on their regulated and reversible link between membrane-associated proteins and the actin cytoskeleton (15Mangeat P. Roy C. Martin M. Trends Cell Biol.. 1999; 9: 187-192Google Scholar). Remarkably, the F-actin-linker ezrin has recently been related to clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the α1β-adrenergic receptor, thereby contributing to receptor recycling to the plasma membrane (17Stanasila L. Abuin L. Diviani D. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 4354-4363Google Scholar). Moreover, the trafficking of some G-protein-coupled receptors seems to be regulated by the ERM linker EBP50, also known as NHERF1 (17Stanasila L. Abuin L. Diviani D. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 4354-4363Google Scholar, 18Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature.. 1999; 401: 286-290Google Scholar, 19Li J.G. Chen C. Liu-Chen L.Y. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 27545-27552Google Scholar). These data suggest that the interaction of EBP50 and ERM proteins is necessary for receptor recycling, although the mechanism that relates EBP50/ERM/F-actin linking and the receptor membrane traffic pathway is still unknown. It is interesting that ezrin and moesin proteins have been found to be associated with endosomes in an annexin-II-dependent manner (20Harder T. Kellner R. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 1997; 8: 533-545Google Scholar). However, there were no reports indicating functional evidence for moesin involvement during CCV formation, internalization, or recycling. In the present work, we have studied the functional involvement of the F-actin-linker moesin in the trafficking of CCVs. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) using the clathrin light-chain a DsRed fusion protein (LCa-DsRed) (21Merrifield C.J. Feldman M.E. Wan L. Almers W. Nat.

N-terminal ECFP-tagged pleckstrin homology domain of the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase Cδ1 (ECFP-PH) was provided by Dr. Senena Corbalán-García (Universidad de Murcia, Spain), and was used as a PIP2 biosensor in the plasma membrane (23Stauffer T.P.

The 4K/4N-moesin-GFP construct was prepared by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (Cedar Creek, TX). The oligonucleotides (sense, (5′-3′)) used for introducing the K253N/K254N and the K262N/K263N mutations in the FL-moesin-GFP-(1-578) molecule were (the changed bases are underlined) GGAACATCTCTTTCAATGATAACAACTTTGTGATCAAGCCC and GTCATCAAGCCCATCGATAACAACGCCCCGGACTTCGTC, respectively. Both oligonucleotides were used as follows: 18 cycles, 95 °C, 50 s; 60 °C, 50 s; and 68 °C, 10 min. Cells and Transfection—The human HeLa cell line was grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Lonza, Verviers, Belgium) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Lonza), 1% of l-glutamine and 1% of the penicillin-streptomycin antibiotics. Cells were harvested and resuspended at a density of 50-70% in fresh supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 24 h before cell transfection with siRNA and/or DNA construct. Specific Amaxa-kits (Amaxa GmbH, Koeln, Germany) were used for delivery of DNA constructs and/or siRNA into HeLa cells. Cells were nucleofected with 1 μm siRNA and/or 2 μg of each used DNA construct and assayed 24 h or 48 h later. None of the nucleofected protein constructs or siRNA oligonucleotides were toxic to the cells. Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescent HeLa cells were grown on glass coverslips. The cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed for 3 min in 2% formaldehyde in PBS. Cells were washed three times with PBS after fixation and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. The cells were washed with PBS after permeabilization and immunostained for 1 h at room temperature for primary antibodies diluted in PBS. The fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody was also diluted in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, several washings with PBS were performed at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted in Mowiol-antifade (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and imaged in xy mid-sections in a FluoView™ FV1000 confocal microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA), for high-resolution imaging of fixed cells. The final images were analyzed with Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downington, PA). Western Blotting—The extent of protein expression or gene silencing was assessed by Western blot of cell lysates. Cells nucleofected with scrambled oligonucleotides or short interference RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides against moesin (siRNA-moesin or -moesin2) or with the different DNA constructs were lysed 24 h later at +4 °C in 1% SDS sample buffer with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and homogenized by sonication. Equivalent amounts of proteins, measured using the bicinchoninic acid method (BCA protein assay kit from Pierce), were separated by SDS-PAGE, using 12% gradient gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Sigma-Aldrich). Cell lysates were immunoblotted with specific antibodies, and protein bands were detected by luminescence using an ECL System (Pierce). Messenger RNA Silencing—Alexa 546-conjugated or non-fluorescence siRNA oligonucleotides, scrambled or siRNA-moesin, were from Qiagen. siRNA-moesin was generated against the following mRNA sequence of moesin: 5′-agaucgaggaacagacuaa-3′. siRNA-moesin2 was generated against the following mRNA sequence of moesin: 5′-acuaacucccaagauaggcuuc-3′. Irrelevant scrambled siRNA served as a control. The siRNAs for moesin sustained specific interference of moesin protein expression for at least 72 h. Tf Uptake and Recycling Assays—Tf internalization assay: HeLa cells nucleofected with scrambled or siRNA-moesin oligonucleotides (1.5 μm) were detached with PBS/5 mm EDTA, washed three times with PBS, and balanced for 1 h at 37 °C in Tf uptake buffer (Krebs-Hepes buffer with 2 mm of Ca2+), before starting the experiment. Then, equivalent amounts of cells (1 × 106 cells·ml-1) were kept on ice-cold Tf uptake buffer, and incubated with 200 nm of Alexa 488-labeled Tf ligand at +4 °C for 30 min. Cells were washed in cold Tf uptake buffer to remove unbound ligand, and surface-bound fluorescent Tf was measured at +4 °C, under any experimental condition. This prebound Alexa 488-labeled Tf ligand was internalized at 37 °C for the indicated early times. Returning the samples to ice stopped the internalization of fluorescent Tf. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, and the remaining surface-bound Tf was removed by acid washing (PBS-glycine 150 mm, pH 2.3) for 3 min. Alexa 488-associated fluorescence Tf uptake was measured in cells by flow cytometry, and normalized by the total amount of Tf ligand prebound at +4 °C, as described (26Sever S. Damke H. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol.. 2000; 150: 1137-1148Google Scholar). Tf Recycling Assay—HeLa cells nucleofected with scrambled or siRNA-moesin oligonucleotides (1.5 μm) were detached as described for Tf uptake. Cells (1 × 106 cells·ml-1) were then incubated with Alexa 488-labeled Tf (200 nm in Tf uptake buffer) at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were put in ice-cold buffer to stop the uptake and recycling processes and washed in acidic buffer (PBS-glycine 150 mm, pH 2.3) to remove recycled surface-Tf ligand. Cells were then reincubated to 37 °C to allow the recycling of the internalized fluorescent Tf for the indicated time points. At these time points, cells were put on ice, washed with acidic buffer to remove recycled Tf from the cell surface, and fixed (in PBS/2% paraformaldehyde). The amount of the fluorescent Tf ligand remained (non-released) in cells was measured by flow cytometry and expressed as the percentage of the initial intracellular Tf amount detected in cells (100%, time 0 of recycling), in each experimental condition. Cell Surface Expression of the TfR—To detect cell-surface TfR, cells were labeled for 1 h at +4 °C with mouse monoclonal anti-CD71 primary antibody diluted in PBS buffer, washed, and incubated 1 h at +4 °C with goat anti-mouse Alexa 568-conjugated secondary antibody. The cells were washed, fixed for 3 min in 2% paraformaldehyde, and fluorescence intensity was analyzed using FACScan (BD Biosciences, San José, CA). Data were analyzed using WinMDI 2.9 application software (1993-2000 Joseph Trotter). TIRFM—Cells were imaged with an inverted microscope Zeiss 200 m (Zeiss, Germany) through a 1.45-numerical aperture objective (alpha Fluar, 100×/1.45, Zeiss) in a Krebs-Hepes buffer containing 2 mm Ca2+. The objective was coupled to the coverslip using an immersion fluid (n488 = 1.518, Zeiss). The expanded beam of an argon ion laser (Lasos, Lasertechnik GmbH, Germany) was band-pass filtered and used to selectively excite different fluorescent proteins, for evanescent field illumination. Different filters were used for each analyzed fluorophor. The beam was focused at an off-axis position in the back focal plane of the objective. Light, after entering the coverslip, underwent total internal reflection as it struck the interface between the glass and the solution or cell at a glancing angle. Total internal reflection generates an evanescent field that declines exponentially with increasing distance from the interface, depending on the angle at which light strikes the interface. The angle was measured using a hemicylinder, as described previously (21Merrifield C.J. Feldman M.E. Wan L. Almers W. Nat. Cell Biol.. 2002; 4: 691-698Google Scholar). The images were projected onto a back-illuminated charge-coupled device camera (AxioCam MRm, Zeiss) through a dichoric and specific band-pass filter for each fluorophor. Each cell was imaged using Axiovision (Zeiss) for up to 2 min with 0.25-s exposures at 1 Hz when illuminated under the evanescent field. Tracking Analysis of CCSs Movement by TIRFM Imaging—Tracking analysis of single LCa-DsRed-labeled structures was performed by using Metamorph. CCSs were excluded if they were larger than 0.5 μm or if they became oblong at any time. We marked the position of each tagged pit and tracked their x-y position as a function of time. The average radius for the x-y lateral trajectories of tracked CCSs were determined in single cells, as described (27Gaidarov I. Santini F. Warren R.A. Keen J.H. Nat. Cell Biol.. 1999; 1: 1-7Google Scholar), and calculated from the total number of cells analyzed by Metamorph. TIRFM or Confocal Co-distribution Analysis—The overlap between different fluorescence molecules was determined by taking evanescent field and confocal images. The images were low-pass filtered using Metamorph. We plotted a small circle of 0.9-μm diameter around each analyzed spot and five circles outside these spots. These circles were used to calculate the local background. We drew 0.9-μm diameter circles around clathrin spots, duplicated the circles into the image of the pair molecule at identical pixel locations, and then determined whether the new circle contained a fluorescent point concentric to within 0.15 μm to quantify the degree of co-distribution of endogenous moesin with endogenous clathrin or α-adaptin molecules (by confocal), or the overexpressed fluorescent rab5, rab7, rab11, TfR, or α-adaptin molecules with LCa-DsRed-labeled CCSs (by TIRFM). Circles were scored as positive if they contained a fluorescent spot and negative if they did not. Moreover, co-localization was scored positive when the fluorescence intensity average was at least three times the standard deviation of the background. The percentage of co-distribution was determined in single cells after random co-distribution subtraction, and the average values were calculated from the total number of cells analyzed. Images were rotated 90 degrees and molecule co-distribution was calculated again, as described above, to determine that the observed correlation was not due to random signal overlap. If the observed co-localization was random, rotation of the image would not change the degree of signal overlap obtained before the rotation of the image. TIRFM-based Analysis of the Tf Binding to Cell-surface TfR—To study the binding of the Tf ligand to TfR at the cell surface by TIRFM, Alexa 568-labeled Tf (50 nm in Tf uptake buffer (Krebs-Hepes with 2 mm of Ca2+)) was added at +4 °C for 30 min to control (scrambled) or moesin-silenced cells. Both of these cells transiently expressed the TfR-phl receptor. Cells were kept in starvation medium before Tf incubation, incubated on ice in Tf uptake buffer for 30 min, and washed with cold-Tf uptake buffer. After binding of Alexa 568-labeled Tf to TfR-phl, the cell-surface-associated fluorescence was analyzed by TIRFM, as described above for TIRFM co-distribution analysis. Imaging TfR Exocytosis by TIRFM—Exocytosis of the TfR-phl receptor was monitored by TIRFM in control (scrambled) and moesin-silenced cells, both transiently overexpressing the fluorescent TfR-phl molecule. The frequency of TfR-phl exocytosis was calculated as the number of events recorded per cell for 60 s (3 frames/s), and comparing the frequency average between control and moesin-silenced cells (total events analyzed from 12 cells per each experimental condition). Preparation of Plasma-membrane Sheets—Freshly nucleofected cells were grown on glass coverslips (ø, 12 mm) overnight. The coverslip was then rinsed in HEPES buffer (25 mm, pH 7.4), and put in contact with poly-l-Lysine (0.2 mg·ml-1)-precoated glass coverslip (ø, 18 mm) for 30 min at room temperature. Afterward, this coverslip sandwich was placed onto moist filter paper for 10 min without applying pressure. The sandwich was transferred to a Petri dish and filled with HEPES buffer, and the large coverslip (ø, 18 mm) was positioned on top. The coverslips were spontaneously separated while floating, thereby ripping off the cells to obtain plasma-membrane sheets on the poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslip (ø, 18 mm), as described (28Burns A.R. Oliver J.M. Pfeiffer J.R. Wilson B.S. Methods Mol. Biol.. 2008; 440: 235-245Google Scholar). These preparations were analyzed by TIRFM to visualize the different fluorescent nucleofected proteins at the cell surface. PIP2 Binding Assay and Dot-blot Analysis—Binding assay of FL-moesin-GFP or 4K/4N-moesin-GFP to soluble PIP2 was performed with purified moesin molecules from lysates of respective nucleofected cells. Cells were lysed at +4 °C (PBS-1% Triton X-100, completed with a protease inhibitor mixture), and sonicated for 10 s. These lysates were precleared, and then incubated (500 μg of total protein) overnight at +4 °C with anti-GFP polyAb (40 μg), non-covalently complexed to protein G-Sepharose beads (100 μl). Co-immunoprecipitated proteins were washed with PBS buffer and incubated with 100 μl of soluble PIP2 (0.5 mg·ml-1 in chloroform:methanol:1 n HCl: H2O; at a volume ratio of 20:10:1:1) for 2 h at room temperature. The samples were washed with PBS and boiled in β-mercaptoethanol-Laemmli sample buffer for 1 min at 90 °C. Protein G-Sepharose beads were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants were spotted in polyvinylidene fluoride membranes using a dot-blot apparatus (Slotblot, GE Healthcare). PIP2 bands were probed with a specific anti-PIP2 mAb (1:200). The dot blots were then reprobed, after membrane stripping with anti-GFP polyAb (1:200). PIP2 and GFP fusion protein bands were detected by luminescence using the ECL system (Pierce). Subcellular Fractionation and Protein Precipitation—Scrambled (control) or siRNA-moesin-treated HeLa cells (1 × 107 cells) were washed twice with PBS at +4 °C. Cells were gently scraped from culture plates and collected by centrifugation. They were then homogenized in 200 μl of buffer (78 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 8.37 mm CaCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.0) containing 250 mm sucrose and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. The supernatants (from scrambled or siRNA-moesin cells) were placed on a 5-20% linear Optiprep™ (Nycomed, Amersham Biosciences) gradient, formed in 12 ml of the above buffer, and centrifuged at +4 °C, for 20 h at 100,000 × g, in an SW28 rotor (Beckman, Germany). Following the centrifugation, the total volume gradient was separated into 1-ml fractions, collected from top to bottom (from 5% to 20% Optiprep™ concentration, respectively). The protein precipitation was as follows: the volume of each collected fraction (1 ml) was duplicated with cool acetone (1 ml, -20 °C) in acetone-compatible tubes. The samples were then vortexed and incubated for 1 h at -20 °C, and further centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g. Samples were decanted, and the protein pellets were resuspended in Laemmli buffer to be resolved by SDS-PAGE (12%) and Western blot techniques using specific antibodies. Statistics—Data were compared using Student's t test. Asterisks indicate p < 0.05. Moesin Co-distributes with Constitutive Components of CCSs—To study the involvement of moesin in CCV trafficking, we first analyzed the distribution of endogenous moesin with constitutive components of CCSs by using fluorescence confocal microscopy. We observed that endogenous moesin presented a punctated pattern of distribution in HeLa cells (Fig. 1), partially co-distributing with the endogenous CHC (Fig. 1A; quantified in Fig. 1D), a main component of the clathrin triskelion that forms CCPs and CCVs (29Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Biochem.. 2000; 69: 699-727Google Scholar, 30Musacchio A. Smith C.J. Roseman A.M. Harrison S.C. Kirchhausen T. Pearse B.M. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 3: 761-770Google Scholar, 31Ybe J.A. Brodsky F.M. Hofmann K. Lin K. Liu S.H. Chen L. Earnest T.N. Fletterick R.J. Hwang P.K. Nature.. 1999; 399: 371-375Google Scholar). We also observed a partial co-distribution of moesin with endogenous α-adaptin (Fig. 1B; quantified in Fig. 1D), a key component of the AP2 complex for CCV formation and clathrin-mediated endocytosis (32Brodsky F.M. Chen C.Y. Knuehl C. Towler M.C. Wakeham D.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol.. 2001; 17: 517-568Google Scholar, 33Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. Nature.. 2003; 422: 37-44Google Scholar). However, endogenous moesin slightly co-distributed with the γ-adaptin protein (Fig. 1C; quantified in Fig. 1D), a component of the heterotetrameric adaptor protein complex AP-1, which has been involved in mediating cargo sorting from the trans-Golgi network to the endosome compartment (reviewed in Refs. 34Schmid S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem.. 1997; 66: 511-548Google Scholar, 35Knuehl C. Chen C.Y. Manalo V. Hwang P.K. Ota N. Brodsky F.M. Traffic.. 2006; 7: 1688-1700Google Scholar, 36Robinson M.S.

Cell.. 2001; 12: 2907-2920Google Scholar), as well as in promoting retrograde endosome to trans-Golgi network transport (39Meyer C. Zizioli D. Lausmann S. Eskelinen E.L. Hamann J. Saftig P. von Figura K. Schu P. EMBO J.. 2000; 19: 2193-2203Google Scholar). The quantification of moesin co-distribution with these molecules was performed as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” These data indicate that a pool of endogenous moesin mostly co-distributes with specific components of CCSs that are associated with plasma membrane-derived CCSs. Moesin Silencing Alters Movement and Causes Clustering of CCSs—To investigate the functional involvement of moesin in CCV trafficking, we first performed TIRFM experiments tracking LCa-DsRed-labeled structures in cells where endogenous moesin was silenced by siRNA (Fig. 2, A and B). We observed that overexpressed LCa-DsRed displayed a diffraction-limited punctated pattern in transfected cells (Fig. 2C, white arrows in scrambled and siRNA-moesin images), which is characteristic of CCSs (8Merrifield C.J. Perrais D. Zenisek D. Cell.. 2005; 121: 593-606Google Scholar, 21Merrifield C.J. Feldman M.E. Wan L. Almers W. Nat. Cell Biol.. 2002; 4: 691-698Google Scholar, 27Gaidarov I. Santini F. Warren R.A.

https://openalex.org/W2094354182,"The anaphase promoting complex (APC) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase required for the metaphase-to-anaphase transition and mitotic exit. However, APC also plays roles in G1, where it is regulated by Cdh1, and APC activity has also been detected in differentiated and non-proliferating cells, suggesting that it may play roles outside the cell cycle. Here, we report that disrupting APCCdh1 activity inhibits neurite outgrowth of both PC12 pheochromocytoma cells and primary cerebellar granule cells. APCCdh1 activity dramatically increases as PC12 cells differentiate in response to nerve growth factor. Furthermore, a key target degraded by APCCdh1 following nerve growth factor treatment is the F-box protein Skp2, and APCCdh1-mediated destruction of Skp2 is essential for proper terminal differentiation of neuronal precursors.

Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis controls essentially every transition of the cell cycle (1Reed S.I. Nat. Rev. Mol.

For example, the metaphase-to-anaphase transition and mitotic exit are initiated after degradation of specific substrates (3Peters J.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 931-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar), which are mediated by the anaphase promoting complex (APC) 3The abbreviations used are: APC, anaphase promoting complex; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; NGF, nerve growth factor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; P, postnatal day; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; EGL, external granule layer. 3The abbreviations used are: APC, anaphase promoting complex; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; NGF, nerve growth factor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; P, postnatal day; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; EGL, external granule layer. E3 ubiquitin ligase (1Reed S.I. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). APC is a multisubunit ubiquitin ligase that associates with one of two known activators (Cdh1 (Cdc20 homolog 1) or Cdc20), which recruit substrates and bring them into close proximity to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 (1Reed S.I. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Following conjugation, substrates are ubiquitinated by APC, and ubiquitinated substrates are then degraded by the 26 S proteasome (1Reed S.I. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The essential role of APCCdc20 in initiating mitotic transitions is firmly established (1Reed S.I. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). However, the roles of the non-mitotic form of APC, APCCdh1, are just emerging (4Harper J.W. Burton J.L. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2179-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), and they appear complex, as APCCdh1 is active throughout G1, in differentiating cells, and in terminally differentiated cells (5Brandeis M. Hunt T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5280-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 6Gieffers C. Peters B.H. Kramer E.R. Dotti C.G. Peters J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11317-11322Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In G1, APCCdh1 is known to target essential DNA replication factors for destruction (7Mailand N. Diffley J.F. Cell. 2005; 122: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 8Araki M. Wharton R.P. Tang Z. Yu H. Asano M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6115-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, APCCdh1 activity may be responsible for G1 maintenance by inhibiting the initiation of DNA replication. Consistent with this notion, depletion of the APC activator Cdh1 induces premature entry into S phase (9Sorensen C.S. Lukas C. Kramer E.R. Peters J.M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7613-7623Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 10Wei W. Ayad N.G. Wan Y. Zhang G.J. Kirschner M.W. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nature. 2004; 428: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Although signaling pathways that regulate the mitotic form of APC are known (1Reed S.I. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 4Harper J.W. Burton J.L. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2179-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), those that control APCCdh1 activity during G1 have not been extensively characterized. Regulatory control is operational because APCCdh1 activity is high during early G1 but progressively decreases as cells approach S phase; therefore, in addition to intrinsic cell cycle controls, extrinsic pathways also likely control APCCdh1 activity during late G1 (11Rape M. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 2004; 432: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). One extracellular signal that positively regulates APCCdh1 activity is transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) (12Wan Y. Liu X. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1027-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). For example, TGF-β stimulation of epithelial cells induces hyperactivation of APC (12Wan Y. Liu X. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1027-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 13Liu W. Wu G. Li W. Lobur D. Wan Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2967-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and these changes occur within minutes, suggesting that APC activation is an immediate response to TGF-β or is a cue to withdraw from the cell cycle. Furthermore, APC activity is necessary for mediating the TGF-β signal because inhibiting APCCdh1-mediated degradation of the substrate Sno-1 or Skp2 (S phase-associated kinase protein 2) diminishes TGF-β responsiveness of cells (13Liu W. Wu G. Li W. Lobur D. Wan Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2967-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Drawing upon the studies linking APCCdh1 and the TGF-β pathway, we hypothesized that signals provoked by nerve growth factor (NGF) regulate APCCdh1 during neuronal differentiation. Indeed, we report here that the NGF signaling pathway rapidly induces APCCdh1 activity and that NGF induces the rapid degradation of APC substrates, including cyclin B1 and the F-box protein Skp2, which is necessary for degradation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 (14Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). Furthermore, APCCdh1 activity and degradation of Skp2 is required for neurite outgrowth in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells and in primary cerebellar granule cells. Therefore, APCCdh1-mediated destruction of Skp2 appears to coordinate cell cycle exit and the terminal differentiation of neurons. Degradation and Ubiquitinylation Assays—In vitro degradation assays were performed essentially as described (15Ayad N.G. Rankin S. Ooi D. Rape M. Kirschner M.W. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 399: 404-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, PC12 cells were treated for various times with NGF, and cell extracts were prepared after hypotonic swelling and repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Extracts were supplemented with ubiquitin (0.1 μg/ml), cycloheximide (1 μg/ml), and an energy-regenerating system. In vitro translated (35S-labeled) cyclin B, Δdboxcyclin B, Skp2, or Δdbox-Skp2 proteins were incubated in 20 μl of cell extract for the indicated times at room temperature, and the reactions were stopped by adding SDS-containing sample buffer. In vitro ubiquitination assays were performed as described (10Wei W. Ayad N.G. Wan Y. Zhang G.J. Kirschner M.W. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nature. 2004; 428: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of NGF for 2 h. Lysates were then prepared from these cells as described above and incubated with 4 μg of anti-Cdc27 antibody complexed to protein A-Affi-Prep beads (Bio-Rad). Immunopurified APC was washed four times with buffer A (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2) supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, once with buffer A with 300 mm NaCl, and once with buffer A. Washed beads (5 μl) were incubated with 1 μl of 35S-labeled N-terminal cyclin B, Skp2, or Δdbox-Skp2; UbcH10 (2.8 μm; Boston Biochem); E1 (1 μm; Boston Biochem); and an ATP-regenerating system in a final volume of 7.5 μl at room temperature with shaking. Ubiquitin (10 mg/ml; Boston Biochem) was also included. 1-μl aliquots of the ubiquitination reactions were removed at the indicated times and mixed with SDS-containing sample buffer. The relative extent of polyubiquitination was measured by quantifying entire lanes after subtracting the signal generated from input cyclin B (1 arbitrary unit = signal generated from input). N-cyclin B1-Luciferase Assays—The first 100 amino acids of Xenopus cyclin B1 were fused to firefly luciferase (N-cyclin B1-luciferase) using the HindIII and NcoI sites of the pGL3 control vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Subconfluent HeLa cells (40,000/well) on a Corning 3917 96-well plate were reverse-transfected with 125 ng of N-cyclin B1-luciferase along with an equal amount of pCS2-Myc (Myc-tagged vector-only control), pCS2-Myc-Xenopus CDH1, or pCS2-Myc-emi-1 using Trans-IT (Mirus Bio, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated at 37 °C and 10% CO2 in a humidified incubator for 20–24 h. Steady-state levels of luciferase were determined by adding an equal volume of britelite (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Relative luciferase units of transfected cells were analyzed with Multi-Analyst GT. PC12 Cell Neurite Outgrowth Assays—PC12 cells were grown on 50 μg/ml laminin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum, and streptomycin/penicillin. PC12 cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) in 6-well plates using 1 μg of total DNA (Cdh1, N-Cdh1, Skp2, or Δdbox-Skp2 cotransfected with enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP)). Cells were subsequently cultured for 24 h before NGF was added. The extent of neurite outgrowth was assayed 48 h later using an inverted Axiophot epifluorescence microscope. Neurite-positive cells were scored as those cells containing any processes greater in length as twice the diameter of one cell body. Neurite outgrowth of enhanced GFP-positive cells was assayed using an inverted Axiophot epifluorescence microscope. Cerebellar Granule Cell Slice Cultures—1.2 ml of serum-free medium (Eagle's basal medium, 0.5% glucose, insulin/transferrin/selenium supplement, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1% bovine serum albumin) was added to each well of a 6-well dish. Millipore tissue culture inserts were then placed into each well and allowed to equilibrate for 1 h in a cell culture incubator. Slices (300 μm) of cerebella from postnatal day (P) 5 or P6 mice were isolated using a McIlwain tissue chopper and placed into tissue culture inserts. 400 μl of medium was then removed, and equivalent amounts of respective viral supernatants were added. An additional 400 μl of medium was added to the slices 4 h later. The slices were then cultured for 48 h, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and processed for GFP (Abcam) immunoreactivity. The Purkinje cell layer was identified by calbindin (Abcam) staining. Cdh1 Knockdown Constructs—HeLa cells were transfected with Lipofectamine in 10-cm dishes with 4 μg of pCS2-FLAG-mouse CDH1 and 4 μg of either short hairpin RNA (shRNA) vector or three CDH1 shRNA knockdown constructs or Sport6 as a control. After 24 h, whole cell lysates were prepared, resolved on 4–20% Tris glycine gradient gels, and transferred to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes. The membrane was probed with affinity-purified anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 produced in mouse (F1804, Sigma) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG used as the secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). The membrane was reprobed with rabbit anti-lamin A IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) as a loading control using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare) as the secondary antibody. Blots were developed with ECL Plus (GE Healthcare). To characterize endogenous CDH1 expression after transfection with knockdown constructs, we cultured P19 cells and transfected them using FuGENE 6 with control shRNA (shRNA1) or shRNA4 and isolated cells 48 h after transfection. The sequences of CDH1 knockdown construct sequences attained from GenScript Corp. are as follows: control or shRNA1 vector only, pRNAT-H1.4/Retro(SD1253); shRNA2, ACGCGTCGTATGAGTGGCCAGTGAGCTTGTTGATATCCGCAAGCTCACTGGCCACTCATATTTTTTCCAACTCGAG; shRNA3, ACGCGTCGTAGAAGTCGTCCTGAAGCTCTTTGATATCCGAGAGCTTCAGGACGACTTCTATTTTTTCCAACTCGAG; and shRNA4, ACGCGTCGTGATCCTGTGGAAGTTCACGCTTGATATCCGGCGTGAACTTCCACAGGATCATTTTTTCCAACTCGAG. Production of Retroviruses—Retroviruses were isolated from tissue culture supernatants of 293T transfected cells. 293T cells were grown in 60-mm dishes and transfected with 2 μg of pCL-Eco and 2 μg of retroviral construct (pRNAT-H1.4/Retro for shRNA constructs and pMX-GFP or pMX-GFP-N-Cdh1) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. Virus-containing supernatant was collected 48 and 72 h post-transfection and used in slice culture assays. The medium of transfected cells was changed 4 h after transfection to granule cell medium (Eagle's basal medium, 10% horse serum, 5% fetal calf serum, 1% glucose, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). NGF Induces APCCdh1 Activity in PC12 Cells—Among many possible systems to evaluate the role of APC in cell differentiation, neuronal differentiation seemed particularly attractive given the high levels of APC expression in the brain (6Gieffers C. Peters B.H. Kramer E.R. Dotti C.G. Peters J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11317-11322Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 has been widely used as a model system of neuronal differentiation because, in response to NGF, it recapitulates many of the morphological features of differentiating neurons, including the outgrowth of neurites (16Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 78: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). To initially evaluate the activity of APC during NGF-induced differentiation, concentrated somatic cell extracts from NGF-treated or untreated PC12 cells were prepared and tested for their in vitro degradation activity using the model mitotic APC substrate cyclin B1. Cyclin B1 degradation increased dramatically 15 min after NGF addition (Fig. 1, A and B) and remained high for at least 3 h (supplemental Fig. S1; data not shown). Furthermore, cyclin B1 degradation was contingent upon the presence of the N-terminal destruction box sequence in cyclin B1, as a mutant form of cyclin B1 lacking the destruction box (Δdbox-cyclin B) was not efficiently degraded (Fig. 1, A and B). Moreover, increased cyclin B degradation was accompanied by enhanced APC-dependent ubiquitination (Fig. 1C) and was not due to overt changes in the cell cycle, as these events were manifest long before changes in the cell cycle were observed (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, the increase in cyclin B1 degradation was not due to changes in proteasome activity as determined by a succinyl-LLVY-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin fluorogenic substrate assay (data not shown). APCCdh1 Targets Skp2 for Destruction after NGF Treatment of PC12 Cells—NGF stimulation provokes G1 arrest and terminal differentiation of PC12 cells (17Durand B. Fero M.L. Roberts J.M. Raff M.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 431-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Among the known G1 substrates of APC is the F-box protein Skp2 (10Wei W. Ayad N.G. Wan Y. Zhang G.J. Kirschner M.W. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nature. 2004; 428: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 18Bashir T. Dorrello N.V. Amador V. Guardavaccaro D. Pagano M. Nature. 2004; 428: 190-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Skp2 harbors a highly conserved N-terminal destruction box that is present in most APC substrates. Furthermore, APC targets F-box proteins for degradation during G1 (10Wei W. Ayad N.G. Wan Y. Zhang G.J. Kirschner M.W. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nature. 2004; 428: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 18Bashir T. Dorrello N.V. Amador V. Guardavaccaro D. Pagano M. Nature. 2004; 428: 190-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Skp2 regulates the turnover of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1, a potent inducer of cell cycle exit and differentiation in various systems (19Durand B. Gao F.B. Raff M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 20Vernon A.E. Devine C. Philpott A. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To initially test whether APC targets Skp2 for degradation during NGF-induced differentiation, we prepared concentrated cell extracts from either NGF-treated or untreated PC12 cells. As observed for cyclin B1, Skp2 degradation was accelerated after 1 h of NGF stimulation (Fig. 2, A and B, and supplemental Fig. S1). Furthermore, a Skp2 mutant lacking the destruction box (Δdbox-Skp2) was not degraded as efficiently as wild-type Skp2, suggesting that APC is required for degradation of Skp2 in these extracts, although other pathways may also be involved (Fig. 2A). Finally, the role of APC in Skp2 degradation was indicated by the ability of excess N-terminal cyclin B (N-cyclin B) to inhibit Skp2 degradation (Fig. 2B) and by the inability of Δdbox-Skp2 to be efficiently ubiquitinated by extracts isolated from NGF-treated PC12 cells (supplemental Fig. S2). APCCdh1 Activity Is Required for Neurite Outgrowth of PC12 Cells—The unexpected finding that NGF rapidly induced significant increases in APC-mediated cyclin B1 and Skp2 degradation suggested that APC might play critical roles in NGF-mediated differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we disrupted APC function by evaluating the effects of a dominant-negative form of the G1 APC activator Cdh1, termed N-Cdh1, and the inhibitor of the APC Emi-1 (early mitosis inhibitor 1) (21Pfleger C.M. Lee E. Kirschner M.W. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2396-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 22Hsu J.Y. Reimann J.D. Sorensen C.S. Lukas J. Jackson P.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 358-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). We initially tested their activity by cotransfection of HeLa cells with an expression vector encoding a fusion of the N terminus of cyclin B and firefly luciferase (Fig. 3), which acts as an accurate surrogate target of APC and a direct measure of APC activity (23Lukas C. Sorensen C.S. Kramer E. Santoni-Rugiu E. Lindeneg C. Peters J.M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 1999; 401: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). As expected, overexpression of Cdh1 repressed N-cyclin B1-luciferase levels, whereas overexpression of N-Cdh1 or Emi-1 led to marked increases in N-cyclin B1-luciferase (Fig. 3). Therefore, the N-Cdh1 mutant and Emi-1 indeed act as effective inhibitors of APC by disrupting its association with endogenous substrates, as has been shown previously by multiple groups (21Pfleger C.M. Lee E. Kirschner M.W. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2396-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 22Hsu J.Y. Reimann J.D. Sorensen C.S. Lukas J. Jackson P.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 358-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). To test the effects of disrupting APC activity on NGF-induced differentiation, PC12 cells were transfected with Cdh1, N-Cdh1, or Emi-1 (Fig. 4) along with the gene encoding GFP. As a control, PC12 cells were transfected with wild-type Cdh1 or GFP alone. The transfected PC12 cells were then induced to differentiate with NGF for 48 h, and the effects on differentiation were determined by scoring neurite outgrowth. Notably, enforced expression of either N-Cdh1 or Emi-1 significantly inhibited (by at least 50%) the differentiation of PC12 cells compared with cells expressing comparable levels of wild-type Cdh1 or those expressing GFP alone (Fig. 4, A and B; data not shown). Again, these effects were not a consequence of simply inducing cell cycle arrest, as fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of transfected cells indicated no overt differences in their cell cycle profiles (supplemental Fig. S3). Furthermore, overexpression of N-Cdh1 or Emi-1 did not induce apoptosis (data not shown). Therefore, APC activity contributes to neurite formation in differentiating neuronal cells. APCCdh1 Activity Is Required for Migration of Cerebellar Granule Cells—To test the function of APCCdh1 in a more physiologically relevant context, we tested the role of APCCdh1 in cerebellar granule cell differentiation using an in vitro cerebellar slice culture system, which has been utilized to study cerebellar granule cell differentiation and migration (24Stoppini L. Buchs P.A. Muller D. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1991; 37: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2512) Google Scholar). Cerebella from P5 or P6 mice were isolated, sliced, and then cultured for several days submerged in slice culture medium, and their differentiation state was assessed as they migrated within these slices. In this system, undifferentiated progenitors reside in the periphery of the cerebellum and then migrate inward as they differentiate, from the external granule layer (EGL) to the molecular layer and eventually the internal granule layer (24Stoppini L. Buchs P.A. Muller D. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1991; 37: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2512) Google Scholar). Thus, simply by marking a cell's position within the cerebellum, one can determine its differentiation state (Fig. 5A). To utilize the cerebellar slice system, we first generated a retrovirus encoding a GFP fusion protein fused to the dominant-negative N-Cdh1 form of the APC activator Cdh1 (GFP-N-Cdh1). P5 or P6 cerebellar slices were infected with GFP-N-Cdh1- or GFP only-expressing retroviruses, cultured for 48 h, and then stained for GFP using an anti-GFP antibody to detect infected cells. Notably, N-Cdh1 overexpression significantly compromised cerebellar granule cell migration and differentiation in slice cultures, and most of these failed to migrate from the slice edge (Fig. 5B). By contrast, control cerebellar cells expressing GFP alone migrated away from the EGL inward toward the Purkinje cell layer (data not shown). Finally, cerebellar cells overexpressing GFP-N-Cdh1 had significantly shorter neurites relative to control cells expressing GFP alone and slightly lower expression of the neuron-specific marker doublecortin (Fig. 5B and supplemental Fig. S4) (25Gleeson J.G. Lin P.T. Flanagan L.A. Walsh C.A. Neuron. 1999; 23: 257-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Therefore, APCCdh1 activity is also required for the migration and differentiation of primary cerebellar neurons. Cdh1 Is Essential for Cerebellar Neuron Migration—A caveat of our N-Cdh1 studies is that overexpression of this dominant-negative form of Cdh1 could have off-target effects. Therefore, we also tested the requirement for the APCCdh1 complex in neuronal differentiation by selectively knocking down Cdh1 expression. Three shRNA-expressing retroviruses that specifically target mouse Cdh1 and also express coral GFP in cis from an internal ribosome entry site were generated and tested for their ability to knock down cotransfected mouse Cdh1 in HeLa cells or endogenous Cdh1 in P19 mouse teratocarcinoma cells. One of these Cdh1-directed shRNAs (shRNA4) depleted Cdh1 (Fig. 6, A and B). To test the effects of Cdh1 knockdown in cerebellar cell migration, P5 cerebellar slice cultures were infected with retroviruses expressing CDH1 shRNA (shRNA4) or control shRNA, and the effects on cell migration from the outer EGL to the Purkinje cell layer were assessed by following coral GFP expression, which was detectable in cell bodies. Notably, knockdown of Cdh1 impaired cerebellar cell migration relative to control shRNA (Fig. 6C). The strength of signal for coral GFP was reduced compared with enhanced GFP, so we therefore could not follow its distribution in neurites throughout slice cultures. Skp2 Degradation Contributes to Neurite Outgrowth—Our N-Cdh1 overexpression and Cdh1 knockdown studies suggest that APCCdh1 activity is generally required for neuronal morphological differentiation. Because APCCdh1-mediated destruction of Skp2 increased following NGF treatment of PC12 cells (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S1), we tested whether Skp2 degradation is required for neuronal morphological differentiation. PC12 cells were transfected with either wild-type Skp2 or the Skp2 mutant that is resistant to degradation (Δdbox-Skp2), and cells were expanded in culture. These cells were then treated with NGF for 48 h. Overexpression of either wild-type Skp2 or GFP did not affect neurite formation (Fig. 7A). However, overexpression of Δdbox-Skp2 severely impaired neurite outgrowth (Fig. 7A). Therefore, Skp2 destruction appears to be required for neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. In analyses of the role of Skp2 degradation in neurite outgrowth in primary P5 granule cells, we observed that overexpression of either wild-type Skp2 or Δdbox-Skp2 impaired neurite outgrowth (data not shown), suggesting that supraphysiological levels of Skp2 override the degradative machinery to impair morphological differentiation. Regardless, the data support the conclusion that Skp2 degradation, which is directed by the APCCdh1 complex, is required for proper migration and differentiation of both normal and transformed neuronal progenitor cells. APCCdh1 Activity Is Required for Cell Cycle Exit and Differentiation—The studies presented herein support the emerging theme that APCCdh1 is required for the initiation and/or execution of differentiation programs. Indeed, similar to what we have observed in neuronal cells, other recent studies have demonstrated a required role for APC and the degradation of Skp2 during myogenesis and lens epithelial differentiation (13Liu W. Wu G. Li W. Lobur D. Wan Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2967-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 26Wu G. Glickstein S. Liu W. Fujita T. Li W. Yang Q. Duvoisin R. Wan Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1018-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 27Binne U.K. Classon M.K. Dick F.A. Wei W. Rape M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Naar A.M. Dyson N.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings indicate that APCCdh1 function is required to coordinate differentiation programs with cell cycle exit and that Skp2 is a key substrate in this response. In addition to intrinsic cues, our studies suggest that APCCdh1-mediated Skp2 degradation is regulated by extrinsic cues because APCCdh1 activity and Skp2 degradation are augmented by NGF-directed signaling. Precisely how NGF stimulates APCCdh1 activity is not clear, but this may be due to overt changes in the expression of APC components such as APC4, Cdc23, and Cdh1. (The mRNA levels of APC4, CDC23, and CDH1 increased 2–3-fold as judged by Affymetrix analysis of mRNA isolated from PC12 cells treated with NGF for 24 h. 4N. G. Ayad, unpublished data. ) Thus, we posit that NGF signaling may lead to modification of components of the APCCdh1 complex that increase its intrinsic E3 ubiquitin ligase activity toward Skp2. In turn, Skp2 degradation then leads to increases in p27Kip1 levels, which are well known to set the threshold for cell cycle exit and differentiation (Fig. 7B and supplemental Fig. S1), particularly during neuronal differentiation programs (17Durand B. Fero M.L. Roberts J.M. Raff M.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 431-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 20Vernon A.E. Devine C. Philpott A. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, we found that Emi-1-dependent inhibition of neurite outgrowth can be partially overcome by enforced p27 expression (supplemental Fig. S5). The observation that p27 expression only partially rescues the neurite outgrowth defect observed following inactivation of the APCCdh1 complex suggests that there are other APCCdh1 substrates that must be degraded for cell cycle exit and differentiation to proceed. Indeed, APCCdh1 targets the transcriptional regulators Id2 and Sno-N for destruction in neuronal systems (28Lasorella A. Stegmuller J. Guardavaccaro D. Liu G. Carro M.S. Rothschild G. de la Torre-Ubieta L. Pagano M. Bonni A. Iavarone A. Nature. 2006; 442: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 29Stegmuller J. Konishi Y. Huynh M.A. Yuan Z. Dibacco S. Bonni A. Neuron. 2006; 50: 389-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and T-cadherin is degraded via APC in PC12 cells, an event that is key for NGF-dependent neurite outgrowth (30Bai S. Datta J. Jacob S.T. Ghoshal K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27171-27180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there appears to be hierarchy in the degradation of APC substrates, where disabling the destruction of one substrate can influence the timing or efficiency of degradation of others (31Rape M. Reddy S.K. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 2006; 124: 89-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Such control could also be directed by signaling pathways operational during differentiation that affect the specificity or affinity of APCCdh1 for its substrates. APCCdh1 Has Distinct Functions in Proliferation Versus Differentiation—We found that disrupting APC activity inhibits neurite outgrowth and cerebellar cell migration in slice cultures. These findings conflict with those of Bonni and co-workers (32Konishi Y. Stegmuller J. Matsuda T. Bonni S. Bonni A. Science. 2004; 303: 1026-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), who reported that the lengths of neuronal processes were augmented by knockdown of rat Cdh1. One possible explanation is that we targeted APCCdh1 in proliferating cells using retroviruses, whereas the transfection procedure of Bonni and co-workers targeted all cells, including those that were terminally differentiated. Thus, the timing of APC inhibition may direct outcome, where APCCdh1 is required for cell cycle exit, migration, and neurite outgrowth during the early stages of cell cycle withdrawal yet controls the extension of processes once cells have differentiated. Consistent with the notion of distinct temporal roles for APCCdh1 in neuronal differentiation are the findings that APC inhibition can also lead to apoptosis of terminally differentiated cells and cell cycle exit defects in SH-SHY cells or in neural stem cells of Cdh1 heterozygous mice (33Almeida A. Bolanos J.P. Moreno S. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8115-8121Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 34Cuende J. Moreno S. Bolanos J.P. Almeida A.

Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 802-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the fact that mice lacking both alleles of Cdh1 in neurons were not reported may be a strong indication that Cdh1 plays an essential role in proliferation and cell cycle exit of neuronal precursors in vivo.

Activation occurs by a conformational change initiated by cleavage of a specific peptide bond. We have derived a monoclonal antibody (mAb-112) which binds with subnanomolar affinity to pro-uPA, the zymogen form of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). We mapped the epitope of the antibody to the autolysis loop, one of the structural elements known to change conformation during zymogen activation. A mechanistic evaluation with biophysical methods elucidated a novel bifunctional inhibitory mechanism whereby mAb-112 not only delays the proteolytic conversion of single-chain pro-uPA into the two-chain form but also subsequently averts the conformational transition to a mature protease by sequestering the two-chain form in a zymogen-like, noncatalytic state. Functional studies employing two variants of human HT-1080 cells, exhibiting high and low levels of dissemination in a chorioallantoic membrane assay, demonstrate that mAb-112 is an effective inhibitor of tumor cell intravasation. These findings show that pharmacological interference with zymogen activation is a plausible and robust means to regulate uPA activity and the downstream effects of plasminogen activation in the spread of cancer and other processes of pathological tissue remodeling. A strategy that targets regions related to pro-enzyme activation likely provide a unique inhibitor-protease interaction surface and is, thus, expected to enhance the chances of engineering high inhibitor specificity.

Our results provide new information about the structural flexibility underlying the equilibrium between active and inactive forms of serine proteases. In nature a key mechanism for regulation of serine proteases with a trypsin-like fold is the activation of secreted zymogens or proenzymes, which typically have activities orders of magnitude lower than the mature enzymes. Zymogen activation is the central step in natural protease cascade regulation, allowing for rapid amplification of the activation signal. The catalytic activity of a zymogen relative to the mature protease can generally be thought of as a problem of equilibrium between active and inactive conformational states of the protease domain. Zymogen activation generally occurs by cleavage of the bond between amino acid residues 15 and 16. 2Amino acid numbering used in the text and figures refers to the standard chymotrypsinogen template numbering. 2Amino acid numbering used in the text and figures refers to the standard chymotrypsinogen template numbering. The liberated amino terminus inserts into a hydrophobic binding cleft of the catalytic domain forming, in addition to hydrophobic interactions, a salt bridge to the side chain of Asp194 which stabilizes the substrate binding pocket and oxyanion hole in a catalytically productive conformation. Conformational changes after cleavage involves four disordered regions of the activation domain, including the activation loop (residues 16-21), the autolysis loop (residues 142-152), the oxyanion stabilizing loop (residues 184-194), and the S1 entrance frame (residues 216-223) (Fig. 1A) (for reviews, see Refs. 1Hedstrom L.

Nonetheless, classical development of small molecule inhibitors of serine proteases has proved a daunting task, with only limited success in engineering inhibitors with high affinity and specificity for related proteases possessing conserved active site architecture and P1 3P1, P2, P3, P4, etc. and P1′,P2′,P3′,P4′, etc. are of the nomenclature of Schechter and Berger (37Abramowitz N.

Thus far targeting zymogen activation instead of the mature protease has been a greatly under-exploited strategy in therapeutic regulation of protease activity. This approach provides an opportunity to target more unique interaction surfaces, thereby increasing inhibitor specificity, and ultimately offering novel inhibitory mechanisms. In addition, a more efficient inhibition is expected by targeting enzymes functioning high up in a catalytic cascade.A serine protease of particular relevance for pursuing therapeutic intervention is urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), 4The abbreviations used are: uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; uPAR, uPA receptor; CAM, chorioallantoic membrane; CMK, chloromethylketone; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; EGR, Glu-Gly-Arg. 4The abbreviations used are: uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; uPAR, uPA receptor; CAM, chorioallantoic membrane; CMK, chloromethylketone; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; EGR, Glu-Gly-Arg. which catalyzes the conversion of plasminogen to the active protease plasmin, which in turn acts directly on the degradation of extracellular matrix proteins (6Andreasen P.A. Egelund R. Petersen H.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Abnormal expression of uPA is implicated in tissue remodeling in several pathological conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, allergic vasculitis, and xeroderma pigmentosum. In particular, uPA is central to the invasive capacity of malignant tumors (6Andreasen P.A. Egelund R. Petersen H.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). As with all trypsin-like proteases, uPA has a catalytic serine protease domain with surface-exposed loops around residues 37, 60, 97, 110, 170, and 185. Besides the catalytic domain, uPA has an amino-terminal extension consisting of a kringle domain and an epidermal growth factor domain. The latter domain functions in binding to the cell surface-anchored uPA receptor (uPAR) (6Andreasen P.A. Egelund R. Petersen H.H. Cell. Mol.

The most specific inhibitors to date appear to be those derived from antibodies and peptidyl inhibitors, which utilize binding sites involving surface loops of uPA and extended exosite interactions to drive selectivity and specificity (for reviews, see Refs. 4Rockway T.W. Nienaber V. Giranda V.L. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2002; 8: 2541-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar and 5Stoppelli M.P. Andersen L.M. Votta G. Andreasen P.A. Edwards D.R. H⊘yer-Hansen G. Blase F.

Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York2008: 721-758Google Scholar).Here we present evidence that targeting zymogen activation is an effective means to regulate protease activity. This conclusion was realized through the development and biochemical analysis of an inhibitory monoclonal antibody, referred to as monoclonal antibody (mAb)-112, which not only delays cleavage of pro-uPA but acts to stabilize the activated two-chain protease in a non-catalytic conformation by restricting the conformational mobility of the activation domain. Characterization of mAb-112 further provides new insights into the flexibility of protease domains and uPA zymogen activation mechanisms. Moreover, mAb-112 was shown to efficiently inhibit human tumor cell intravasation, a step in the metastatic cascade in which activation of pro-uPA was previously implicated as a key event (10Madsen M.A. Deryugina E.I.

Chem. 2006; 281: 15997-16005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBuffer Conditions—Unless otherwise indicated, all reactions were carried out in a buffer containing 30 mm HEPES, 135 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4 (HBS-B).uPA—Human two-chain uPA was purchased from Wakamoto (Tokyo, Japan). Recombinant human pro-uPA was a gift from Abbott Laboratories. uPA-PAI-1 complex and diisopropyl fluorophosphate-uPA were prepared as described (11Egelund R. Petersen T.E. Andreasen P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Labeling of uPA (25 μm) with EGR-chloromethyl ketone (CMK; 1 mm) or 1,5-dansyl-EGR-CMK (1 mm) was carried out in phosphate-buffered saline at 25 °C for 60 min. Labeling of pro-uPA (12-20 μm) with EGR-CMK or 1,5-dansyl-EGR-CMK (10-20 mm) required the addition of 50 mm Ile-Ile dipeptide and incubation at 37 °C for 4 h. Excess inhibitor was removed by extensive dialysis against 20 mm citric acid, 50 mm NaCl, pH 4.5.Wild type and mutant recombinant human pro-uPA variants were expressed in HEK 293T cells (12Petersen H.H. Hansen M. Schousboe S.L. Andreasen P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4430-4439Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), cultured in the presence of 5 μg/ml aprotinin. The concentrations of wild type and mutant pro-uPA in the conditioned media were determined by surface plasmon resonance analysis using a BIACORE T100 instrument (see below) and were between 80 and 600 nm; however, for the most part variants were consistently expressed at concentrations close to 300 nm. In purified preparations, protease concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.36 ml mg-1 cm-1 and an Mr value of 54,000.Other Proteases—Recombinant human matriptase residues 596-855 was purchased from R&D systems (Wiesbaden-Nordenstadt, Germany). Human Glu-plasminogen was purchased from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT).Antibodies—mAbs were created in-house by immunization of Balb/c mice with recombinant human single chain pro-uPA by intraperitoneal injection. Booster injections of 100 ng of antigen were given on days 35, 65, 100, 130, and 132. Spleen cells were harvested on day 135 and fused with NSO myeloma cells for hybridoma generation (13Jespersen M.H. Jensen J. Rasmussen L.H. Ejlersen E. Moller-Petersen J. Sperling-Petersen H.U. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Investig. 1993; 53: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Hybridomas were screened for binding to pro-uPA by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, yielding 22 clones for further characterization. Conditioned media from these hybridomas were tested for the binding specificity of secreted mAbs toward pro-uPA and uPA using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Among those tested, one hybridoma produced an antibody, mAb-112, proven to be specific toward pro-uPA. This mAb was determined to belong to subclass IgG1. Antibodies were purified from hybridoma-conditioned medium using protein G-Sepharose 4FF (13Jespersen M.H. Jensen J. Rasmussen L.H. Ejlersen E. Moller-Petersen J. Sperling-Petersen H.U. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Investig. 1993; 53: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). One liter of cell culture supernatant yielded between 15 and 50 mg of purified antibody.To produce the Fab fragment of mAb-112, the antibody was treated with papain in a 1:100 (w/w) ratio of enzyme to antibody in 15 mm cysteine, 2 mm EDTA for 6 h at 37 °C. Fab-112 was purified from the cleavage reaction mixture by protein A affinity chromatography in phosphate-buffered saline followed by MonoS™ 5/50 GL cation exchange in 25 mm acetate, pH 5.5, using the AmershamÄKTA explorer 100 Air system (GE healthcare).The following, previously described antibodies were used: anti-uPA mAb-2 and anti-uPA mAb-6 (12Petersen H.H. Hansen M. Schousboe S.L. Andreasen P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4430-4439Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); rabbit polyclonal anti-uPA antibodies (14Knoop A. Andreasen P.A.

Andreasen P.A. Grondahl-Hansen J. Huang J.Y. Kristensen P. Dano K. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1986; 55: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Anti-uPA mAb-118 was from the same fusion as mAb-112 and found to bind the serine protease domain but did not affect uPA enzyme activity. 5G. E. Blouse and K. A. B⊘tkjær, unpublished information. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses were performed on a BIACORE T100 instrument using CM5 sensor chips, flow rates of 30 μl/min, and HBS-B with 0.05% Tween 20. Concentrations of pro-uPA in conditioned media from HEK 293T cells were determined by measuring the initial rate of binding to a chip with 200 response units of anti-uPA mAb-6 (12Petersen H.H. Hansen M. Schousboe S.L. Andreasen P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4430-4439Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) using a standard curve of purified pro-uPA. Affinities of mAb-112 for various forms of wild type or mutant pro-uPA and uPA were determined by injecting the proteases (0.5-150 nm), either purified or in conditioned media, over a chip with 200 response units of immobilized mAb-112. The affinity constants kon, koff, and KD were determined by global fitting to a 1:1 binding model with the BIA-CORE evaluation program. In an alternative approach, the binding of mAb-112 to uPA variants was assessed by capturing the variants (300 response units) on a chip with immobilized anti-uPA mAb-6 and subsequently injecting Fab-112 over the chip at a concentration of 100 nm and a flow rate of 10 μl/min.Amidolytic Assay of uPA Activity—Rates for the uPA-catalyzed hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate <Glu-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide (S-2444; Chromogenix, Mölndal, Sweden) were measured at 37 °C in HBS-B. Reactions of uPA (5 nm) in the presence or absence of mAb-112 (0-500 nm) were acquired over a range of substrate concentrations (0-0.8 mm). Initial rates of S-2444 hydrolysis were monitored at 405 nm.Plasminogen Activation Assays—Pro-uPA or uPA (0.25 nm) was preincubated with various concentrations of mAb-112 (5-160 nm) in HBS-B at room temperature for 30 min. The addition of 0.5 μm plasminogen and 0.5 mm plasmin substrate H-d-Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanilide (S-2251) initiated the reaction at 37 °C. S-2251 hydrolysis was monitored for the parabolic increase in absorbance at 405 nm.For assaying uPA-catalyzed plasminogen activation activity with uPA bound to uPAR at cell surfaces, U937 cells were cultured as described previously (16Lund L.R. Georg B. Nielsen L.S. Mayer M. Dano K. Andreasen P.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1988; 60: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), washed, and resuspended in HBS-B at a density of 107 cells/ml. Cells were preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 50 nm uPA or pro-uPA and subsequently washed three times with HBS-B to remove unbound uPA or pro-uPA. The cells were then distributed into the wells of non-transparent 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) in a total volume of 200 μl and a cell density of 5 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were preincubated for 30 min with mAb-112 or the unrelated anti-PAI-1 mAb-2 as a negative control before initiating the reactions with plasminogen (270 nm) and the fluorogenic plasmin substrate H-d-Val-Leu-Lys-7-amido-4-methylcoumarine (200 μm). The levels of fluorescence were monitored with 1-min intervals in a Spectromax Gemini fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices) using an excitation wavelength of 390 nm and an emission wavelength of 480 nm. uPA-uPAR Binding Analysis—Samples containing 1.0 × 106 U937 cells per ml, 100 pm 125I-pro-uPA or 125I-uPA (1 × 107 cpm/pmol) and varying concentrations of mAb-112 or control amino-terminal fragment were prepared in RPMI medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The following day cells were pelleted, and half of the supernatant was collected for γ-counting. The rest of the supernatant was removed, the cells were washed twice with 1 ml of serum-free RPMI medium and pelleted, and the bound pro-uPA or uPA was quantified by γ-counting plotted as a function of the mAb-112 or amino-terminal fragment concentration.Analysis of Pro-uPA Cleavage by SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting Analysis—Samples of pro-uPA (200 nm) were incubated in the presence or absence of 300 nm mAb-112 for 30 min at room temperature in 30 mm HEPES, 135 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% polyethylene glycol, pH 7.4. At various times after the addition of plasmin (5 nm) or matriptase (50 nm), samples were removed and analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with rabbit polyclonal anti-uPA antibodies.Fluorescence Emission Spectroscopy—Fluorescence emission spectra of dansyl-labeled pro-uPA or uPA were collected using a SPEX-3 spectrofluorimeter equipped with a Peltier temperature controller maintaining the measurement and incubation temperatures at 25 °C. Fluorescence experiments were carried out using semi-micro (0.5 × 1.0 cm) quartz cuvettes and in a Hepes-buffered saline reaction buffer containing 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000 to prevent protein adsorption to the quartz surface. The excitation wavelength used for studying the fluorescence of dansyl-EGR-pro-uPA or dansyl-EGR-uPA was 335 nm, and the emission spectra were scanned from 450 to 625 nm using an excitation bandwidth of 5 or 10 nm and an emission bandwidth of 5 nm. Emission spectra for 200 nm dansyl-EGR-pro-uPA or dansyl-EGR-uPA were recorded before and after the addition of plasmin (10 nm) and with or without 300 nm mAb-112. Results are presented as the averaged spectra of three independent titrations. All individual emission spectra were collected as averages of 3-5 emission scans using a 1.0-s integration over a 1.0-nm step resolution and corrected for background fluorescence and dilution effects, which were typically less than 5%.Human Tumor/Chick Embryo Chorioallantoic Membrane (CAM) Assay—HT-hi/diss and HT-lo/diss variants, previously selected in vivo from HT-1080 human fibrosarcoma (ATCC, Manassas, VA) for a 50-100-fold differential in their ability to intravasate (10Madsen M.A. Deryugina E.I. Niessen S. Cravatt B.F. Quigley J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15997-16005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), were cultured under standard conditions. The day before experiments, cells were passaged and, after an overnight incubation, detached with trypsin/EDTA, washed, and resuspended in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Fertilized SPAFAS White Leghorn eggs (Charles River, North Franklin, CT) were incubated in a humidified rotary incubator at 38 °C. On day 10 of incubation, 2 × 105 HT-hi/diss cells or 4 × 105 HT-lo/diss cells were grafted in 25 μl of serum-free medium on the CAM. The developing HT-hi/diss tumors were treated on days 1 and 3 with 0.1 ml of 1 mm aprotinin or 25 μg of normal mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), mAb-118, mAb-2, or mAb-112. A group of embryos was treated with mAb-112 on day 3 only. Control embryos were treated with 0.1 ml of vehicle (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 135 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% w/v polyethylene glycol 8000). On day 5, primary tumors were excised and weighed. Portions of the distal CAM were harvested and frozen on dry ice. Levels of human cell intravasation in the chick embryo were determined by quantitative PCR of the Alu repeats (10Madsen M.A. Deryugina E.I. Niessen S. Cravatt B.F. Quigley J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15997-16005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The actual numbers of tumor cells in each tissue sample were determined using a standard curve generated by a serial dilution of HT-1080 cells within a constant number (106) of chick embryo fibroblasts. To determine statistical significance, the data sets were analyzed by Fisher or Mann-Whitney two-tailed test for p < 0.05.RESULTSDiscovery of an Inhibitory Antibody to Pro-uPA—In hope of producing mAbs with preferential affinity to pro-uPA, mice were immunized with human pro-uPA. Hybridomas were generated by standard techniques and screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for binding to pro-uPA and uPA. Of the 22 hybridoma clones found to bind pro-uPA, seven produced antibodies that bound to the catalytic domain, whereas the remaining clones were specific for the amino-terminal fragment of uPA. A single hybridoma clone produced an antibody, mAb-112, which bound to the catalytic domain and demonstrated a clear preference for binding to pro-uPA over active uPA as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (data not shown).mAb-112 Inhibits Pro-uPA Activation—The functional effect of mAb-112 on pro-uPA activation was investigated in a coupled plasminogen activation assay in which pro-uPA was incubated with plasminogen and a plasmin substrate. The assay is designed so that trace amounts of plasmin in the plasminogen preparation will initiate pro-uPA activation and the further generation of plasmin, which in turn activates additional pro-uPA creating a reciprocal activation cycle stimulating plasmin generation (17Behrendt N. List K. Andreasen P.A. Dano K. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Preincubation of pro-uPA with mAb-112 inhibited the generation of plasmin with an estimated IC50 value in the 5 nm range (Fig. 2A). Plasminogen activation catalyzed directly by active two-chain uPA was also reduced by mAb-112, however at much higher effective concentrations of mAb-112, suggesting that mAb-112 preferentially targets pro-uPA activation (Fig. 2B). In contrast to mAb-112, no inhibitory effects on plasminogen activation by either pro-uPA or uPA were observed in the presence of a control antibody, anti-PAI-1 mAb-2 (data not shown).FIGURE 2mAb-112 inhibits in vitro plasminogen activation initiated by Pro-uPA or uPA. 0.25 nm pro-uPA (panel A) or 0.25 nm uPA (panel B) was incubated without (black dots) or with 5 nm (red dots), 10 nm (green dots), 20 nm (yellow dots), 40 nm (dark blue dots), 80 nm (pink dots), and 160 nm (light blue dots) of mAb-112. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, plasminogen was added to 0.5 μm and S-2251 to 0.5 mm. Substrate hydrolysis was followed at 37 °C by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm. Pro-uPA or uPA was omitted in controls (gray curves).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We further evaluated the effect of mAb-112 on the activation of pro-uPA by both plasmin and matriptase in a more direct way. To this end, pro-uPA was incubated with plasmin or matriptase for various time periods after which the activation reactions were quenched by the addition of aprotinin. The amount of generated active uPA was estimated from the rate of hydrolysis of the uPA amidolytic substrate S-2444. As shown in Fig. 3, the presence of mAb-112 in this assay resulted in a total inhibition of pro-uPA activation by both plasmin and matriptase.FIGURE 3mAb-112 inhibits the activation of Pro-uPA. Ten nm pro-uPA was incubated with 100 nm mAb-112 (black dots), 100 nm anti-PAI-1 mAb-2 (open circles), or buffer (black triangles). At time 0, 0.5 nm plasmin or 5 nm matriptase was added. Then the mixtures were incubated at room temperature for the indicated time periods, after which the activity of plasmin and matriptase was quenched by the addition of 1 μm aprotinin. S-2444 was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and the amount of active uPA formed was estimated by the rate of hydrolysis and comparison to a standard curve of active two-chain uPA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The ability of mAb-112 to inhibit uPAR-bound pro-uPA activation and, thus, downstream uPA activity on the cell surface was further examined using U937 cells, which up-regulates uPAR expression and surface display after stimulation with phorbol esters (18Picone R. Kajtaniak E.L. Nielsen L.S. Behrendt N. Mastronicola M.R. Cubellis M.V. Stoppelli M.P. Pedersen S. Dano K. Blasi F. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, cell surface plasminogen activation initiated by pro-uPA bound to uPAR at the surface of U937 cells was also dose-dependently inhibited. Inhibition of plasmin generation was considered to be in direct response to mAb-112 acting on cell surface-associated pro-uPA activity rather than an effect on the binding of pro-uPA to uPAR. This conclusion was supported by experiments demonstrating that mAb-112 was unable to compete 125I-pro-uPA or 125I-uPA binding to uPAR on the surface of U937 cells. One million cells/ml were incubated with 100 pm 125I-pro-uPA with or without mAb-112. In the absence of mAb-112, 4.1 ± 0.2% of the added tracer bound to the cells. In the presence of 150 nm mAb-112, 4.5 ± 0.2% bound. The amino-terminal fragment of uPA effectively competed for binding of the labeled proteases in control experiments.FIGURE 4mAb-112 inhibits cell surface-associated plasminogen activation initiated by pro-uPA. U937 cells (5 × 106 cells/ml) that had been saturated with pro-uPA were incubated at 37 °C in the absence (red dots) or in the presence of 5 nm (light green dots), 10 nm (yellow dots), 20 nm (blue dots), 40 nm (violet dots), 80 nm (cyan dots), or 160 nm of mAb-112 (gray dots). Cells incubated without pro-uPA (black dots) or with anti-PAI-1 mAb-2 (not shown) served as negative controls. After 30 min of incubation, the addition of plasminogen (270 nm) and the fluorogenic plasmin substrate H-d-Val-Leu-Lys-7-amido-4-methylcoumarine (200 μm) started the reaction, which was recorded by reading the fluorescence at regular time intervals for 120 min. The experiment shown is a"
https://openalex.org/W2090215718,"Background AKXD recombinant inbred strains of mice have proven to be very useful in the identification of potential oncogenes and tumor suppressors involved in the development of lymphoid and myeloid malignancies. In these tumors, the hematopoietic insertion of an active AKV murine leukemia virus (MuLV) is associated with the onset of disease. Common sites of retroviral insertion (CIS) identify genes causally associated with the development or initiation of lymphoma. Methodology In the present study, we analyzed a previously uncharacterized CIS, Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 32 (Evi32), which is located on mouse chromosome 1. We analyzed candidate genes in the region to identify those involved in Evi32 mediated oncogenesis. Results Here we show that proviral insertion at Evi32 correlates with significant overexpression of a putative transcription factor, PR-domain containing 14 (Prdm14). Tumors with insertions at Evi32 are consistently lymphoid in nature. Prdm14 is normally expressed early in embryonic development with the highest expression in undifferentiated embryonic stem (ES) cells. This study implicates Prdm14 as a proto-oncogene involved in lymphoblastic lymphoma formation."

The chemokine receptor CCR7 is important for lymphatic invasion of cancer cells and is overexpressed in metastatic breast cancer cells. A bioactive withanolide tubocapsanolide A (Tubo A) suppressed NF-κB-mediated CCR7 expression in breast cancer cells and attenuated their migration toward lymphatic endothelial cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed that binding of NF-κBto the consensus site localized at the –398/–389 of human CCR7 promoter was repressed by Tubo A. Tubo A inhibited IκB kinase (IKK) and p38 kinase and downstream mitogen and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1) activity to reduce IκB degradation and to suppress NF-κB activation. Co-expression of IKK and MSK1 fully rescued Tubo A-induced inhibition. In addition, ectopic expression of transforming growth factor-β-activating kinase (TAK1), the common upstream kinase of IKK and MSK1, also completely reversed the inhibition by Tubo A. Most importantly, Tubo A reduced NF-κB activation, CCR7 expression, and lymph node metastasis of breast cancer in vivo.

However, the control of CCR7 gene transcription in cancer cells is largely unclear, and no natural products have been shown to regulate CCR7 expression.We have isolated a new bioactive withanolide tubocapsanolide A (Tubo A) from Tubocapsicum anomalum (20Hsieh P.W. Huang Z.Y. Chen J.H. Chang F.R. Wu C.C. Yang Y.L. Chiang M.Y. Yen M.H. Chen S.L. Yen H.F. Lubken T. Hung W.C. Wu Y.C. J. Nat. Prod... 2007; 70: 747-753Google Scholar). Tubo A exhibited cytotoxic activity on various types of human cancer cells (20Hsieh P.W. Huang Z.Y. Chen J.H. Chang F.R. Wu C.C. Yang Y.L. Chiang M.Y. Yen M.H. Chen S.L. Yen H.F. Lubken T. Hung W.C. Wu Y.C. J. Nat. Prod... 2007; 70: 747-753Google Scholar). In addition, our recent results demonstrated that Tubo A suppressed the transcription of Skp2 oncogene and up-regulated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitory proteins p27 and p21 to inhibit proliferation of human lung cancer cells (21Chang H.C. Chang F.R. Wang Y.C. Pan M.R. Hung W.C. Wu Y.C. Mol. Cancer Ther... 2007; 6: 1572-1578Google Scholar). In this study, we address the following objectives: (a) the effect of Tubo A on the expression of CCR7 in breast cancer cells, (b) the effect of Tubo A on lymphatic migration of breast cancer cells, and (c) the underlying mechanism by which Tubo A regulates CCR7.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlant Material—The initial collection of T. anomalum (Solanaceae) was made on July 2003 near NanTao County and identified by Dr. Hsin-Fu Yen (National Museum of Natural Science, Taichung, Taiwan).

Cho C.Y. Hung W.C. Cancer Res... 2006; 66: 8413-8420Google Scholar). 3000 cells in 100 μl of medium with vehicle or Tubo A (0.5 μm) were placed in the upper part of the Transwell unit and allowed to invade for 24 h. The lower part of the Transwell unit was filled with LECs. After incubation, invaded cells on the bottom surface of the membrane were fixed in formaldehyde, stained with Giemsa solution, and counted under a microscope. In some experiments, cells transfected with various expression vectors were collected by trypsinization and placed into the upper well in the absence or presence of Tubo A for invasion assay.RT-PCR—Total RNA was subjected to RT-PCR analysis as described previously (22Chang H.C. Cho C.Y. Hung W.C. Cancer Res... 2006; 66: 8413-8420Google Scholar). The primer sequences: CCR7-forward, 5′-GGACCTGGGGAAACCAAT-3′; CCR7-reverse, 5′-GCCAGGTTGAGCAGGTAGGT-3′; GAPDH-forward, 5′-GAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGT-3′; and GAPDH-reverse, 5′-TGTGGTCATGAGTCCTTCCA-3′. Amplified cDNA products were run on 2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV light.Immunoblotting—Extraction of cellular proteins and immunoblotting were performed as previously described (23Hsu M.C. Chang H.C. Hung W.C. J. Biol. Chem... 2006; 281: 4718-4725Google Scholar).Preparation of Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Fractions—Cells were plated in 75-cm2 flasks and grown to 70–80% confluence. Treated cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Nuclei were spun down, and the supernatant was collected as the cytoplasmic fraction. Nuclei were further extracted in cold buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on ice for 20 min. Cellular debris was clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatant was collected as nuclear fraction.Flow Cytometry—For detection of CCR7 expression, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with biotinylated anti-CCR7 antibody at 4 °C for 30 min. After washing, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated avidin and subjected to flow cytometric analysis as described previously (24Berahovich R.D. Lai N.L. Wei Z. Lanier L.L. Schall T.J. J. Immunol... 2006; 177: 7833-7840Google Scholar).Promoter Activity Assay—In brief, cells were plated onto 6-well plates at the density of 100,000 cells/well and grown overnight. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of NF-κB or AP-1 luciferase reporter plasmid. After transfection, cells were treated with vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or various concentrations of Tubo A in 10% FCS medium for 24 h. Promoter activity was determined and normalized for the concentration of cellular proteins.Analysis of Protein Stability—Protein stability of IκB was measured by blocking protein synthesis with cycloheximide and harvesting the cells at various times. Cells were incubated with 10% FCS medium containing vehicle or various concentrations of Tubo A (0 or 0.5 μm) for 24 h. Cells were treated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide, and cellular proteins were harvested at various times. Protein level of IκB was determined by immunoblotting.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Vehicle- or Tubo A-treated cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A), scraped, and pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in a lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), incubated for 10 min on ice, and sonicated to shear DNA. After sonication, lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors). Anti-NF-κB (p65) or anti-Myc (negative control) antibodies were added to the supernatant and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. ChIP assays were performed as described previously (23Hsu M.C. Chang H.C. Hung W.C. J. Biol. Chem... 2006; 281: 4718-4725Google Scholar). DNA fragments were recovered and were subjected to PCR amplification by using the primers specific for the detection of regions which contained the first (NF-1, –797/–787) and the second NF-κB (NF-2, –398/–389) site of human CCR7 gene promoter. The sequences for the primers: NF-1-forward, 5′-AGAAGCCAGATGTGAAGGTCA-3′; NF-1-reverse, 5′-ACTCCCTCTCAAGAACCCTGT-3′; NF-2-forward, 5′-CCTCCCATTGGCCTAAACTA-3′; and NF-2-reverse, 5′-CAGGCCATGGGTTAGATGTT-3′.In Vivo Xenograft Study—We tested the anti-metastatic ability of Tubo A in nude mice and animal studies were approved by the Animal Care and Ethics Committee of the National Sun Yat-Sen University. Female BALB/cAnN-Foxn1 null mice (5 weeks old) were obtained from National Laboratory Animal Center (Taipei, Taiwan). MDA-MB-231 cells (1 × 106 cells/mice) were injected into left second thoracic mammary fat pad of nude mice. Tumor volumes were measured every 3 days from the second week after injection and were calculated using the formula, V = (length) × (width)2 × 0.5. After 4 weeks, tumors grew to ∼0.18–0.2 cm3. Mice were randomly divided into two groups (n = 5 for each group) and subjected to treatment. Animals of the control group received intraperitoneal injection of 0.1% of DMSO every 3 days. On the other hand, animals of the treatment group received intraperitoneal injection of Tubo A (4 mg/kg) every 3 days. Animal were sacrificed after continuous treatment for 21 days, and the tumors were excised and subjected for RT-PCR analysis. Left axillary, brachial, and inguinal lymph nodes (defined as proximal lymph nodes because they located at the same side of tumor injection site) were excised and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. In addition, right axillary, brachial, and inguinal lymph nodes (defined as distal lymph nodes because they located at the counter side of tumor injection site) were also excised. All lymph nodes were embedded in paraffin using route procedures and subjected for immunohistochemical analysis.Immunohistochemical Analysis—Lymph nodes were cut into 3-μm sections, and paraffin was removed by xylene. Tissues were placed in citrate buffer and incubated at 85 °C for 5 min for antigen retrieval. Tissues were blocked for 15 min with a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution to inhibit endogenous peroxidase activity and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Tissues were probed with antibodies directed against lymphatic marker LYVE-1 for the confirmation of lymphatic tissues or epithelial marker EpCAM for the identification of lymphatic invasion of breast cancer cells. EpCAM (also referred as CD326) is a glycoprotein of ∼40 kDa that was originally identified as a marker for carcinoma, attributable to its high expression on rapidly proliferating tumors of epithelial origin (25Linnenbach A.J. Wojcierowski J. Wu S.A. Pyrc J.J. Ross A.H. Dietzschold B. Speicher D. Koprowski H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1989; 86: 27-31Google Scholar). MDA-MB-231 cells have been shown to expressed a high level of EpCAM (26Osta W.A. Chen Y. Mikhitarian K. Mitas M. Salem M. Hannun Y.A. Cole D.J. Gillanders W.E. Cancer Res... 2004; 64: 5818-5824Google Scholar), whereas lymph node tissues do not express this epithelial marker (27Kubuschok B. Passlick B. Izbicki J.R. Thetter O. Pantel K. J. Clin. Oncol... 1999; 17: 19-24Google Scholar). Bound primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and then developed by diaminobenzidine substrate. Finally, sections were co-stained with hematoxylin. In addition, tissues were also subjected to hematoxylin & eosin stain for identify tumor metastasis. We also addressed the effect of Tubo A on NF-κB activation in vivo. Tumor tissues were stained with anti-NF-κB antibody, and the cell number with positive staining was counted for each tumor section. Percentages of positive staining cells with nuclear signal, which indicated nuclear translocation and activation of NF-κB, were determined and compared between control and the Tubo A-treated group.Statistical Analysis—Student's t test was used to evaluate the difference between various experimental groups. Differences were considered to be significant at p < 0.05.RESULTSTubo A Inhibited CCR7 Expression in Breast Cancer Cells and Attenuated Their Migration toward LECs—The chemical structure of Tubo A is shown in supplemental Fig. S1. We found that CCR7 was highly expressed in metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1A). Conversely, CCR7 expression was low in non-metastatic MCF-7 cells. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated a positive correlation between CCR7 mRNA and protein expression in these two breast cancer cell lines (Fig. 1A). Because MDA-MB-231 cells expressed high level of CCR7, we used this cell line to study the regulation of CCR7 and lymphatic invasion by Tubo A. Our previous studies have demonstrated that Tubo A at the concentration higher than 0.5 μm showed significant cytotoxic activity on various human cancer cell lines (20Hsieh P.W. Huang Z.Y. Chen J.H. Chang F.R. Wu C.C. Yang Y.L. Chiang M.Y. Yen M.H. Chen S.L. Yen H.F. Lubken T. Hung W.C. Wu Y.C. J. Nat. Prod... 2007; 70: 747-753Google Scholar, 21Chang H.C. Chang F.R. Wang Y.C. Pan M.R. Hung W.C. Wu Y.C. Mol. Cancer Ther... 2007; 6: 1572-1578Google Scholar). Because we addressed the anti-metastatic effect of Tubo A in this study, we consistently used low doses (0–0.5 μm) of Tubo A to treat cells to prevent the nonspecific effect caused by cell death. Tubo A at the concentrations of 0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 μm inhibited CCR7 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). In addition, CCR7 mRNA level was also down-regulated by Tubo A in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). In addition to inhibit basal CCR7 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells, Tubo A also repressed tumor necrosis factor-α-induced CCR7 expression (supplemental Fig. S2). Therefore, Tubo A inhibited both basal and extracellular signal-stimulated CCR7 expression. We also compared the effect of another bioactive withanolide Withaferin A on CCR7 expression and found that these two withanolides exhibited similar potency on the inhibition of CCR7 (supplemental Fig. S3). We next tested whether CCR7 was required for the migration of breast cancer cells toward LECs. Primary cultured LECs used in these assays expressed high levels of CCL21 (supplemental Fig. S4). LECs were placed on the lower part of a Transwell unit, and MDA-MB-231 cells were added on the upper part. As shown in Fig. 1D, Tubo A suppressed the invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells toward LECs in a dose-dependent manner. Our previous results also showed that knockdown of CCR7 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells reduced their migration toward LECs (28Pan M.R. Hou M.F. Chang H.C. Hung W.C. J. Biol. Chem... 2008; 283: 11155-11163Google Scholar). Our data suggested that Tubo A inhibited CCR7 expression in breast cancer cells and reduced their migration toward LECs.Tubo A Attenuated IκB Degradation and NF-κB (p65) Nuclear Translocation—Because CCR7 has been found to be a target gene for NF-κB (29Hopken U.E. Foss H.D. Meyer D. Hinz M. Leder K. Stein H. Lipp M. Blood.. 2002; 99: 1109-1116Google Scholar) and a bioactive withanolide withaferin A has been shown to inhibit NF-κB-mediated gene transcription (30Ichikawa H. Takada Y. Shishodia S. Jayaprakasam B. Nair M.G. Aggarwal B.B. Mol. Cancer Ther... 2006; 5: 1434-1445Google Scholar), we tested the effect of Tubo A on the IκB degradation and NF-κB activation. As shown in Fig. 2A, Tubo A up-regulated IκB protein level in MDA-MB-231 cells. Pulse-chase analysis indicated that protein stability of IκB was increased by Tubo A in a dose-dependent manner and Tubo A at the concentration of 0.5 μm effectively reduced IκB degradation (Fig. 2A). On the contrary, the protein level of NF-κB was not significantly changed. Increase of IκB might sequester NF-κB in cytoplasm to attenuate gene transcription. Therefore, we investigated the effect of Tubo A on nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Fig. 2B showed that NF-κB was mainly located in the nucleus of MDA-MB-231 cells possibly due to constitutive activation of some upstream signaling pathways, and this nuclear accumulation was attenuated by Tubo A. On the contrary, Tubo A treatment induced increase of cytoplasmic NF-κB. To verify that NF-κB in the nucleus was active, we used an antibody that specifically recognized the phosphorylated (at Ser-276) NF-κB to perform immunoblotting and confirmed that phosphorylated NF-κB was located in the nucleus of DMSO-treated cells while Tubo A treatment reduced nuclear accumulation (Fig. 2B). In agreement with these data, the NF-κB-dependent reporter activity in MDA-MB-231 cells was also inhibited by Tubo A in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). This effect is NF-κB-specific, because Tubo A did not significantly inhibit AP-1-mediated reporter activity under the same experimental condition. Analysis of the human CCR7 promoter sequence revealed two potential NF-κB binding sites at –797/–787 and –398/–389 regions. Prediction of potential NF-κB consensus sites in human CCR7 promoter had also been reported by Hopken et al. (29Hopken U.E. Foss H.D. Meyer D. Hinz M. Leder K. Stein H. Lipp M. Blood.. 2002; 99: 1109-1116Google Scholar). We studied the in vivo binding of NF-κB to CCR7 promoter by ChIP assays and found that binding of NF-κBto the –797/–787 consensus sequence was very weak (data not shown). Conversely, NF-κB constitutively bound to the –398/–389 region of CCR7 promoter, and its binding was attenuated by Tubo A (Fig. 2D). Binding of NF-κB to this consensus site was specific, because knockdown of NF-κB by short hairpin RNA reduced the binding of NF-κBto this site while a control short hairpin RNA targeting luciferase had no effect. Because no Myc binding site was found in the CCR7 promoter region amplified by PCR primers used in our study, addition of anti-Myc antibody did not get any nonspecific signal, which further verified the specificity of our ChIP assays (Fig. 2D). These data indicated that Tubo A repressed CCR7 by suppressing NF-κB activation.FIGURE 2Inhibition of IκB degradation and NF-κB nuclear translocation by Tubo A. A, MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with 10% FCS medium containing vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or various concentrations of Tubo A for 24 h. Cells were treated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide, and cellular proteins were harvested at 0, 2, and 4 h. Protein levels of IκB and NF-κB were determined by Western blotting. B, cells were treated with vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or Tubo A (0.5 μm) for 24 h. Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared. The subcellular distribution of NF-κB and phosphor-276 NF-κB was studied by immunoblotting. Retinoblastoma (Rb) and Raf-1 kinase were used as internal control to verify purification of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions and equal loading of proteins. C, cells were transfected with 1 μg of NF-κB (N) or AP-1 (A) luciferase reporter plasmids. After transfection, cells were untreated (–) or treated with vehicle (D, 0.1% DMSO) or various concentrations of Tubo A (T1, 0.125 μm; T2, 0.25 μm; and T3, 0.5 μm) in 10% FCS medium for 24 h. Promoter activity was determined and normalized for the concentration of cellular proteins. Results of three independent assays were expressed as mean ± S.D. *, p < 0.05 when the Tubo A-treated groups compared with the control group without Tubo A treatment. D, vehicle- or Tubo A-treated cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min. Cells were harvested and resuspended in a lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), incubated for 10 min on ice, and sonicated to shear DNA. Anti-NF-κB (p65) or anti-Myc (negative control) antibodies were added to the supernatant and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. DNA fragments were recovered and were subjected to PCR amplification by using the primers specific for the detection of the NF-κB(–398/–389) site of human CCR7 gene promoter. Cell transfected with short hairpin RNA targeting luciferase gene (C) or NF-κB gene (sh-NF) were harvested at 48 h after transfection and subjected to ChIP assay as described above. Western blot analysis was performed to verify the down-regulation of NF-κB in transfected cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Ectopic Expression of IKK-β Only Partly Counteracted Tubo A-induced Down-regulation of CCR7—Our aforementioned data suggested that Tubo A reduced IκB degradation to attenuate NF-κB-mediated transcription of CCR7. The main upstream kinase that phosphorylates IκB and controls its protein stability is IKK, so we tested the effect of Tubo A on IKK activity. Phosphorylation on Ser-177/181 of IKK-β or Ser-176/180 on IKK-α is an indication for kinase activation. We used anti-phospho-IKK antibody to investigate the activation of IKK, and our data indicated that IKK-α and -β activity were attenuated by Tubo A (Fig. 3A). Ectopic expression of IKK-β in MDA-MB-231 cells increased IKK-β activity and induced degradation of IκB in these cells (Fig. 3B). In addition, overexpression of IKK-β increased the binding of NF-κB to CCR7 promoter (Fig. 3C). However, reduction of NF-κB promoter binding by Tubo A was only partly reversed. Moreover, Tubo A-induced down-regulation of CCR7 protein on the cell surface was only partly reversed by IKK-β (Fig. 3D). Similar results were observed when IKK-α was ectopically expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells (data not shown). Our data suggested that IKK was not the only one target for Tubo A to inhibit CCR7.FIGURE 3Partial reversion of Tubo A-induced down-regulation of NF-κB promoter binding and CCR7 expression by ectopic expression of IKK-β.

https://openalex.org/W2020848716,"Background Mutation, promoter hypermethylation and loss of heterozygosity involving the tumor suppressor gene p16 (CDKN2a/INK4a) have been detected in a wide variety of human cancers, but much less is known concerning the frequency and spectrum of p16 mutations in premalignant conditions. Methods and Findings We have determined the p16 mutation spectrum for a cohort of 304 patients with Barrett's esophagus, a premalignant condition that predisposes to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Forty seven mutations were detected by sequencing of p16 exon 2 in 44 BE patients (14.5%) with a mutation spectrum consistent with that caused by oxidative damage and chronic inflammation. The percentage of patients with p16 mutations increased with increasing histologic grade. In addition, samples from 3 out of 19 patients (15.8%) who underwent esophagectomy were found to have mutations. Conclusions The results of this study suggest the environment of the esophagus in BE patients can both generate and select for clones with p16 mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2029967426,"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) plays an important regulatory role in bone development. However, the regulatory mechanisms controlling FGFR2 expression remain poorly understood. Here we have identified a role for the nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) in constitutive activation of FGFR2. A unique DNase I hypersensitive site was detected in the region encompassing nucleotides -270 to +230 after scanning a large range covering 33.3 kilobases around the transcription start site of FGFR2. Using a PCR-based chromatin accessibility assay, an open chromatin conformation was detected around the proximal 5' fragment of FGFR2 gene. Deletion constructs of the 5'-flanking region of FGFR2 were fused to a luciferase reporter gene. After transient transfection in C3H10T1/2, ME3T3-E1, and C2C12 as well as primary osteoblasts, a minimal region -86/+139 that is highly homologous to the human sequence and bears a CCAAT box was identified as the core promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay supershift and chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that the CCAAT box was the binding site for NF-Y. Deletion of NF-Y consensus sequence resulted in the total loss of NF-Y promoter activity. Overexpression of NF-Y protein and transfection of NF-Y small interfering RNAs in the cells substantially changed the promoter activity. Moreover, NF-Y small interfering RNAs greatly inhibited the endogenous FGFR2 transcription level and the chromatin accessibility and H3 acetylation across the promoter. Taken together, our results demonstrate that interaction of NF-Y at the CCAAT box is pivotal to FGFR2 gene transcription partly through the construction of a local open chromatin configuration across the promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2145020646,"Background Chromatin organizational and topological plasticity, and its functions in gene expression regulation, have been strongly revealed by the analysis of nucleolar dominance in hybrids and polyploids where one parental set of ribosomal RNA (rDNA) genes that are clustered in nucleolar organizing regions (NORs), is rendered silent by epigenetic pathways and heterochromatization. However, information on the behaviour of dominant NORs is very sparse and needed for an integrative knowledge of differential gene transcription levels and chromatin specific domain interactions. Methodology/Principal Findings Using molecular and cytological approaches in a wheat-rye addition line (wheat genome plus the rye nucleolar chromosome pair 1R), we investigated transcriptional activity and chromatin topology of the wheat dominant NORs in a nucleolar dominance situation. Herein we report dominant NORs up-regulation in the addition line through quantitative real-time PCR and silver-staining technique. Accompanying this modification in wheat rDNA trascription level, we also disclose that perinucleolar knobs of ribosomal chromatin are almost transcriptionally silent due to the residual detection of BrUTP incorporation in these domains, contrary to the marked labelling of intranucleolar condensed rDNA. Further, by comparative confocal analysis of nuclei probed to wheat and rye NORs, we found that in the wheat-rye addition line there is a significant decrease in the number of wheat-origin perinucleolar rDNA knobs, corresponding to a diminution of the rDNA heterochromatic fraction of the dominant (wheat) NORs. Conclusions/Significance We demonstrate that inter-specific interactions leading to wheat-origin NOR dominance results not only on the silencing of rye origin NOR loci, but dominant NORs are also modified in their transcriptional activity and interphase organization. The results show a cross-talk between wheat and rye NORs, mediated by ribosomal chromatin dynamics, revealing a conceptual shift from differential amphiplasty to ‘mutual amphiplasty’ in the nucleolar dominance process."
https://openalex.org/W2017890169,"Scatter factor (SF) (hepatocyte growth factor) is a pleiotrophic cytokine that accumulates in tumors, where it may induce invasion, angiogenesis, and chemoresistance. We have studied the mechanisms by which SF and its receptor (c-Met) protect cells against the DNA-damaging agent adriamycin (ADR) as a model for chemoresistance of SF/c-Met-overexpressing tumors. Previous studies identified a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/c-Akt/Pak1/NF-κB cell survival pathway in DU-145 prostate cancer and Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells. Here we studied Src signaling pathways involved in SF cell protection. Src enhanced basal and SF stimulated NF-κB activity and SF protection against ADR, in a manner dependent upon its kinase and Src homology 3 domains; and endogenous Src was required for SF stimulation of NF-κB activity and cell protection. The ability of Src to enhance SF stimulation of NF-κB activity was due, in part, to its ability to stimulate Akt and IκB kinase activity; and Src-mediated stimulation of NF-κB was due, in part, to a Rac1/MKK3/6/p38 pathway and was Akt-dependent. SF caused the activation of Src and the Rac1 effector Pak1. Furthermore, SF induced activating phosphorylations of MKK3, MKK6, and p38 within the c-Met signalsome in an Src-dependent manner. The NF-κB-inducing kinase was found to act downstream of TAK1 (transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1) as a mediator of SF- and Src-stimulated NF-κB activity. Finally, the Src/Rac1/MKK3/6/p38 and Src/TAK1/NF-κB-inducing kinase pathways exhibited cross-talk at the level of MKK3. These findings delineate some novel signaling pathways for SF-mediated resistance to ADR.

(hepatocyte growth factor) is a pleiotrophic cytokine that can stimulate cell motility, invasion, proliferation, morphogenesis, and differentiation in different cell types and contexts. It is postulated to play roles in development, tissue repair and remodeling, tumorigenesis, and angiogenesis (1Rosen E.M. Nigam S.K. Goldberg I.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1783-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Although SF was also identified as a “tumor cytotoxic factor” for hepatocarcinoma cells (2Higashio K. Shima N. EXS (Basel). 1993; 65: 351-368PubMed Google Scholar), in most cell types and contexts, SF inhibits apoptosis and promotes cell survival (3Frisch S.M. Francis H. J.

We have studied the anti-apoptotic activity of SF against cancer therapy agents, particularly DNA-damaging agents (5Bowers D.C. Fan S. Walter K.A. Abounader R. Williams J.A. Rosen E.M. Laterra J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4277-4283PubMed Google Scholar, 6Fan S. Ma Y.X. Wang J.A. Yuan R.Q. Meng Q. Cao Y. Laterra J.J. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M.

These studies showed that SF protects epithelial, carcinoma, and glioma cells against adriamycin (ADR) (a topoisomerase IIα inhibitor), ionizing radiation (which causes breakage of the sugar-phosphate backbone of DNA), cis-platinum (which cross-links DNA), and other agents. SF and its receptor c-Met are often overexpressed in tumors (8Rosen E.M. Lamszus K. Laterra J. Polverini P.J. Rubin J.S. Goldberg I.D. CIBA Found. Symp. 1997; 212: 215-229PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hurle, R. A., Davies, G., Parr, C., Mason, M. D., Jenkins, S. A., Kynaston, H. G., and Jiang, W. G. (2005) 20, 1339–1349Google Scholar), and their overexpression is associated with a poor prognosis in breast cancer and other tumor types (10Yamashita J. Ogawa M. Yamashita S. Nomura K. Kuramoto M. Saishoji T. Shin S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1630-1633PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kang J.Y. Dolled-Filhart M. Ocal I.T. Singh B. Lin C.Y. Dickson R.B. Rimm D.L. Camp R.L.

Thus, besides promoting invasion and metastasis, SF and c-Met overexpression in tumors may contribute to chemo/radioresistance. Previous studies have identified some of the pathways through which SF protects epithelial and cancer cells against DNA-damaging agents. The core protective pathway involves signaling from c-Met to PI 3-kinase to the survival-promoting serine/threonine kinase c-Akt (5Bowers D.C. Fan S. Walter K.A. Abounader R. Williams J.A. Rosen E.M. Laterra J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4277-4283PubMed Google Scholar, 6Fan S. Ma Y.X. Wang J.A. Yuan R.Q. Meng Q. Cao Y. Laterra J.J. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M.

Biol. 2001; 21: 4968-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition to apoptosis inhibition, this pathway enhances the repair of DNA strand breaks (6Fan S. Ma Y.X. Wang J.A. Yuan R.Q.

Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4968-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this pathway, c-Akt acts upstream of Pak1 (p21-associated kinase 1) to stimulate NF-κB transcriptional activity and induce the expression of anti-apoptotic genes (TRAF2, cIAP1, and cIAP2) (7Fan S.

Gab1 (Grb2-associated binder-1), a multisubstrate adaptor protein, and the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) act upstream of c-Akt as negative regulators of SF protection (7Fan S.

Pestell R.G. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1749-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). c-Src, the homolog of the Rous sarcoma virus oncogene (v-src), is a member of a family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. Src can function as a signal transducer for growth factor-stimulated cell migration, invasion, proliferation, survival, and tumorigenesis (15Frame M.C. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). However, its roles in cell motility and proliferation are better understood than its role in cell survival. One mechanism by which v-src or activated c-Src mutants can stimulate cell survival (and other functions) is through a PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway (16Liu A.X. Testa J.R. Hamilton T.C. Jove R. Nicosia S.V. Cheng J.Q. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2973-2977PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hakak Y. Hsu Y.S. Martin G.S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3164-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because it is frequently overexpressed and/or activated in human cancers, Src (and other Src family kinases) is a potential target for cancer therapy (18Levin V.A. Cancer Treat. Res. 2004; 119: 89-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Src and Src family kinases (e.g. Fyn) interact with the activated c-Met receptor, in part, via a “multifunctional docking site” (1349YVHVXXXYVNV) in the carboxyl terminus of the receptor (19Ponzetto C.

This interaction causes activation of Src (19Ponzetto C. Bardelli A. Zhen Z. Maina F. dalla Zonca P. Giordano S. Graziani A. Panayotou G. Comoglio P.M.

Poteryaev D. Arighi E. Meng X. Angers-Loustau A. Kaplan D. Saarma M. Sariola H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22Wojcik E.J. Sharifpoor S. Miller N.A.

Previously, we showed that Src can stimulate NF-κB activity and that inhibition of Src (e.g. using the pharmacologic inhibitor PP1) blocks the ability of SF to stimulate NF-κB activity (14Fan S. Gao M. Meng Q. Laterra J.J. Symons M.H. Coniglio S. Pestell R.G. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1749-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that Src is required for SF cell protection, and we identify pathways by which Src stimulates NF-κB activity and cell survival. Cell Lines and Culture-DU-145 human prostate cancer and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were cultured in DMEM containing 5% fetal calf serum, nonessential amino acids (100 mm), l-glutamine (5 mm), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml) (from BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD). The cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Reagents-Recombinant human two-chain SF was a gift from Dr. Ralph Schwall (Genentech, South San Francisco, CA). Adriamycin (doxorubicin) and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) dye were obtained from Sigma. The p38 inhibitor SB-202190 was purchased from Calbiochem.

Shalloway (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY) (23Reddy S. Mazzu D. Mahan D. Shalloway D. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3545-3550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Src cDNAs were cloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Clontech) using a PCR-based strategy, and the success of cloning was confirmed by sequence analysis. A dominant negative (DN) kinase-dead Akt mutant (K179A) in the pCIS2 vector was provided by Dr. M. J. Quon (NHLBI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda) (24Cong L.N. Chen H. Li Y. McGibbon M.A. Taylor S.I. Quon M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1881-1890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). WT-PTEN and a phosphatase-defect mutant (C124S) in the pFLAG-CMV vector were provided by Dr. M. Georgescu (Rockefeller University, New York) (25Yamauchi J. Tsujimoto G. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol.

Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). The DN-NIK vector encodes a kinase-dead mutant NIK with a KK → AA substitution within the ATP-binding domain. TAK1 and DN-TAK1 cDNAs in the pcDNA3 vector were provided by Dr. Hongbing Shu (National Jewish Medical Center, Denver, CO) (28Yang X. Kovalenko D. Nadeau R.J. Harkins L.K. Mitchell J. Zubanova O.

Transient Transfections-Subconfluent proliferating cells were transfected overnight with the vector(s) of interest or the empty pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) (10 μg of plasmid DNA per 100-mm dish or 5 μg per well in 6-well dishes) using Lipofectamine™ (Invitrogen) and washed to remove the excess vector and Lipofectamine. Small Interfering (si) RNA-Human NIK-siRNA (sc-36065) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Src-siRNA (M-005196) and nontargeting siRNA pools (Control siRNA, D-001206-13-01) were obtained from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). siRNAs were transfected into cells using Oligofectamine® (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Treatment of cells with 50 nm gene-specific siRNA for 48 h was sufficient to significantly knock down the target protein levels. Measurement of NF-κB Transcriptional Activity-The NF-κB-Luc reporter (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) contains five copies of the NF-κB enhancer element upstream of a TATA box and luciferase. Briefly, subconfluent proliferating cells in 2-cm2 wells were transfected overnight with 0.25 μgofNF-κB-Luc and 0.25 μg of each indicated vector, using Lipofectamine™. The cells were washed, allowed to recover for several hours, treated ± SF (100 ng/ml) for 24 h, and harvested for measurement of luciferase activity, using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Piscataway, NJ). Relative transfection efficiency was determined using the Galacto-Star mammalian reporter gene assay system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to manufacturer's protocol. Luciferase values were means ± S.E. of quadruplicate wells. Adriamycin Treatment-Subconfluent proliferating cells in 6-well dishes were transfected overnight with the indicated vector(s) (5 μg of plasmid DNA per well), washed, and allowed to recover in fresh culture medium for several hours. The cells were harvested, inoculated into 96-well dishes in complete culture medium, allowed to attach overnight, washed, incubated ± SF (100 ng/ml for 48 h) in serum-free DMEM, exposed to different doses of ADR (2 h at 37 °C), and post-incubated for 48 h in fresh drug-free complete culture medium (again ± SF). They were then analyzed for cell viability using MTT assays. For each assay condition, cell viability was determined in 10 replicate wells. MTT Cell Viability Assay-This assay is based on the ability of viable mitochondria to convert MTT, a soluble tetrazolium salt, into an insoluble formazan precipitate, which is dissolved in DMSO and quantitated by spectrophotometry (29Alley M.C. Scudiero D.A. Monks A. Hursey M.L. Czerwinski M.J. Fine D.L. Abbott B.J. Mayo J.G. Shoemaker R.H. Boyd M.R. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 589-601PubMed Google Scholar). After ADR treatment as above, cells in 96-well dishes were tested for MTT dye conversion. The cell viability was calculated as the amount of MTT dye conversion relative to sham-treated control cells. Measurement of Src Kinase Activity-Whole cell lysates were prepared, and equal aliquots of total cellular protein (500 μg) were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Src antibody, as described previously (23Reddy S. Mazzu D. Mahan D. Shalloway D. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3545-3550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The precipitates were incubated with 10 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm PIPES (pH 7.0), 10 mm MnCl2, 10 μm Na3VO4), 1 μl of freshly prepared acid-denatured enolase (Sigma) (5 μg of enolase plus 1 μl of 50 mm HCl incubated at 30 °C for 10 min then neutralized with 1 μl of 1 m PIPES (pH 7.0)), and 10 μCi of [32P]ATP. After 10 min of incubation at 30 °C, reactions were terminated by addition of 2× SDS sample buffer, and samples were analyzed on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Serine and threonine phosphorylations were hydrolyzed by incubating the gel in 1 m KOH at 45 °C for 30 min, followed by fixing in 45% methanol and 10% acetic acid for 30 min at 25 °C, and vacuum drying for 2 h at 80 °C. Autoradiograms were produced and quantitated using a Storm PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Pak1 Kinase Activity-Rac1 activity was assessed by measuring the kinase activity of the Rac1 effector Pak1 (30Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). DU-145 cells were harvested, and whole cell lysates were prepared (see below). Pak1 was immunoprecipitated from 150 to 250 μgof cell lysate in lysis buffer (see below) with a rabbit polyclonal anti-Pak1 antibody (ab3844, Chemicon) and dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. As a control, one-fifth of each IP sample was Western blotted for Pak1, using a polyclonal Pak1 antibody (N-19, 1:500 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Pak1 kinase activity was determined using an in-gel kinase assay (31Ding J. Knaus U.G. Lian J.P. Bokoch G.M. Badwey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24869-24873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, the precipitates were run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5 mg/ml myelin basic protein. Proteins in the gel were then renatured; and their kinase activity toward myelin basic protein was initiated by soaking the gels in kinase buffer containing 25 μCi/ml [32P]ATP and 10 μm unlabeled ATP. The gels were washed extensively and autoradiographed to detect 32P-labeled proteins. Pak1 activity was quantitated by densitometry, using an AlphaImager 2000 (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). IKK-β Kinase Activity-IKK-β kinase activity was measured using the HTScan™ IKK-β kinase assay kit (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). This assay measures the ability of a cell lysate to phosphorylate a biotinylated IκB-α (Ser-32) substrate peptide. A phospho-IκB-α (Ser-32/36)-specific mouse monoclonal antibody was used to detect the phosphorylated substrate peptide. For assay standardization, the kit provides an active GST-IKK-β kinase fusion protein. Each assay condition was tested in five replicate wells, and IKK-β activity was expressed relative to untransfected, non-SF-treated controls. Immunoprecipitation-Subconfluent proliferating DU-145 cells were washed and incubated in serum-free DMEM ± SF (100 ng/ml) for 20 min. The cells were then scraped into lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture set I (Calbiochem)) (1 ml per 100-mm dish). The lysates were incubated for 30 min at 0 °C and centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. After protein quantitation, 500 μg of supernatant protein was pre-cleared for 1 h by addition of Bio-Mag beads (Qiagen) and incubated with 5 μg of IP antibody plus Bio-Mag beads at 4 °C overnight. The IP antibodies were rabbit polyclonal Src antibody (sc-6096, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit polyclonal c-Met antibody (ab14570, Abcam, Inc., Cambridge, MA). The beads were washed four times with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer; and 1× loading buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.5), 5% glycerol, 1% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue) was added. The samples were boiled for 3 min before Western blotting. Western Blotting-After treatment, the cells were collected using trypsin, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in RIPA buffer, placed on ice for 30 min, and spun for 15 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C to remove the insoluble material. Western blotting was performed as described earlier (14Fan S. Gao M. Meng Q. Laterra J.J. Symons M.H. Coniglio S. Pestell R.G. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1749-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots of cell protein (50 μg) were electrophoresed in 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Alternatively, immunoprecipitated proteins (see above) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blotted using the following primary antibodies: phospho-Akt (serine 473) (9271S, Cell Signaling Technology; 1:500 dilution); phospho-Akt (threonine 309) (monoclonal 244F9, Cell Signaling Technology); total Akt (9271, Cell Signaling Technology; 1:500); c-Met (H-190, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:1000); phospho-c-Met (tyrosine 1349) (BIOSOURCE); IκB-α (C-15, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:500); IKK-α (rabbit polyclonal IKK-α, Sigma; 1:1000); IKK-β (mouse monoclonal 62AT216, Abgent, San Diego; 1:500); phospho-IKK-α/β (sc-21661, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:1000); MKK3 (rabbit polyclonal, 9232, Cell Signaling Technology; 1:1000); MKK6 (rabbit polyclonal, 9264, Cell Signaling Technology; 1:1000); NIK (rabbit polyclonal, H248, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:200); phospho-p38 (threonine 180/182) (rabbit polyclonal, 9211, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000); total p38 (mouse monoclonal 9228, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000); phospho-Src (tyrosine 418) (2101S, Cell Signaling Technology); Src (mouse monoclonal, AH01152, BIOSOURCE; 1:1000); TAK1 (rabbit polyclonal, M579, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:500); and actin (goat polyclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:1000). The membranes were then blotted with the appropriate secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:1000); and the blotted proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences), with colored molecular size markers (Bio-Rad). Anoikis Assays-Assays of anoikis (apoptotic cell death triggered by detachment of the cell from its substratum) were performed by a modification of previously described protocols (3Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar, 32Zeng Q. McCauley L.K. Wang C.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50137-50142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, subconfluent proliferating MDCK cells were transiently transfected overnight with the indicated vector(s), washed, and allowed to recover for several hours. Plastic 100-mm Petri dishes were coated with 8 ml of a 10 mg/ml solution of polyhydroxyethyl methacrylate (poly-HEMA), a polymer to which the cells cannot attach. The transfected cells were then suspended using trypsin, counted, and inoculated into poly-HEMA-coated dishes (3 × 106 cells per dish) in cell growth medium ± SF (100 ng/ml). At 48 h after inoculation, the cells were harvested, and any cell aggregates were dispersed using trypsin. Cell viability was determined by trypan dye exclusion analysis (33Bae I. Fan S. Meng Q. Rih J.K. Kim H.J. Kang H.J. Xu J. Goldberg I.D. Jaiswal A.K. Rosen E.M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7893-7909Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). For each dish, at least 200 cells were counted. Each assay was performed in duplicate, and the results represent the means ± ranges from two independent experiments. Statistical Analyses-Where appropriate, comparisons were made using the two-tailed Student's t test Src Modulates SF Stimulation of NF-κB Transcriptional Activity and IKK-β Kinase Activity-We tested the role of Src in SF stimulation of NF-κB activity, using a set of Src mutant expression vectors. DU-145 or MDCK cells were transiently transfected with different vectors plus the NF-κB-Luc reporter, treated ± SF (100 ng/ml) for 24 h, and assayed for luciferase activity. Typically, SF caused a 50–70-fold increase in NF-κB activity. With SF present, WT-Src caused a 3–4-fold increase in NF-κB activity (p < 0.001, two-tailed t test) beyond that observed with SF alone or SF + empty vector (Fig. 1A). Two activated Src mutants (Y527F and Y530F) caused increases in SF-stimulated NF-κB activity (p < 0.001) similar to WT-Src. In contrast, a DN kinase-dead Src mutant (K295R) (23Reddy S. Mazzu D. Mahan D. Shalloway D. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3545-3550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) abrogated basal and SF-stimulated NF-κB activity; and an SH3 domain mutant (D99N) (34Weng Z. Rickles R.J. Feng S. Richard S. Shaw A.S. Schreiber S.L. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5627-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) reduced the SF-stimulated NF-κB activity to about 20% of that due to SF alone (p < 0.001). DU-145 and MDCK cells gave similar responses. In the absence of SF, WT-Src and the activated mutants stimulated NF-κB activity by about 5–6-fold, compared with untransfected or empty vector (pcDNA3)-transfected controls (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1A). The K295R (DN) and D99N mutants severely attenuated or abrogated the basal NF-κB activity in the absence of SF (p < 0.001). Because DN-Src might have other effects than inhibition of Src, we also tested the effects of Src knockdown. A control-siRNA had no effect on basal or SF-stimulated NF-κB activity, but Src-siRNA caused a ≥10-fold reduction in SF-stimulated as well as basal NF-κB activity (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1B). These findings suggest that Src stimulates basal and SF-induced NF-κB activity in a manner requiring its kinase and SH3 domains and that Src is required for SF-induced NF-κB activity. IκB kinase (IKK) stimulates NF-κB activity by causing phosphorylation and degradation of IκB proteins, the cytoplasmic inhibitors of NF-κB (35Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). We tested the effects of Src on the kinase activity of IKK-β, the catalytic subunit, which phosphorylates IκB-α and IκB-β on serine residues. SF caused a 5-fold increase in IKK-β activity in DU-145 cells (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1C). WT-Src, Y527F, and Y530F enhanced IKK-β activity ≥6-fold beyond that due to SF alone or SF+pcDNA3 (p < 0.001), whereas K295R and D99N blocked the SF-stimulated increases in IKK-β activity (p < 0.001). Without SF, WT-Src caused a 4-fold increase in IKK-β activity (p < 0.001), whereas K295R and D99N inhibited IKK-β activity (Fig. 1C). These findings suggest that Src contributes to SF-stimulated (and basal) IKK-β. Effects of SF and Src Mutant Proteins on Src Activity-We performed IP kinase assays using enolase as the substrate (23Reddy S. Mazzu D. Mahan D. Shalloway D. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3545-3550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to confirm that SF stimulates endogenous Src kinase activity. Here, a 20-min exposure to SF stimulated Src activity in DU-145 and MDCK cells by 4.5–6.5-fold (supplemental Fig. 1A). In DU-145 cells, expression of WT-Src or activated Src mutants (Y527F or Y530F) further enhanced the SF-stimulated Src activity (supplemental Fig. 1B). In contrast, th"

Given the importance of the NF-kappaB transcription factor family in these host cell responses, we examined the effect of FHA on NF-kappaB activation in macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells, both of which are relevant cell types during natural infection.Exposure to FHA of primary human monocytes and transformed U-937 macrophages, but not BEAS-2B epithelial cells, resulted in early activation of the NF-kappaB pathway, as manifested by the degradation of cytosolic IkappaB alpha, by NF-kappaB DNA binding, and by the subsequent secretion of NF-kappaB-regulated inflammatory cytokines. However, exposure of macrophages and human monocytes to FHA for two hours or more resulted in the accumulation of cytosolic IkappaB alpha, and the failure of TNF-alpha to activate NF-kappaB. Proteasome activity was attenuated following exposure of cells to FHA for 2 hours, as was the nuclear translocation of RelA in BEAS-2B cells.These results reveal a complex temporal dynamic, and suggest that despite short term effects to the contrary, longer exposures of host cells to this secreted adhesin may block NF-kappaB activation, and perhaps lead to a compromised immune response to this bacterial pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W1978630578,"Tactile object discrimination is an essential human skill that relies on functional connectivity between the neural substrates of motor, somatosensory and supramodal areas. From a theoretical point of view, such distributed networks elude categorical analysis because subtraction methods are univariate. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify the neural networks involved in somatosensory object discrimination using a voxel-based principal component analysis (PCA) of event-related functional magnetic resonance images.Seven healthy, right-handed subjects aged between 22 and 44 years were required to discriminate with their dominant hand the length differences between otherwise identical parallelepipeds in a two-alternative forced-choice paradigm. Of the 34 principal components retained for analysis according to the 'bootstrapped' Kaiser-Guttman criterion, t-tests applied to the subject-condition expression coefficients showed significant mean differences between the object presentation and inter-stimulus phases in PC 1, 3, 26 and 32. Specifically, PC 1 reflected object exploration or manipulation, PC 3 somatosensory and short-term memory processes. PC 26 evinced the perception that certain parallelepipeds could not be distinguished, while PC 32 emerged in those choices when they could be. Among the cerebral regions evident in the PCs are the left posterior parietal lobe and premotor cortex in PC 1, the left superior parietal lobule (SPL) and the right cuneus in PC 3, the medial frontal and orbitofrontal cortex bilaterally in PC 26, and the right intraparietal sulcus, anterior SPL and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in PC 32.The analysis provides evidence for the concerted action of large-scale cortico-subcortical networks mediating tactile object discrimination. Parallel to activity in nodes processing object-related impulses we found activity in key cerebral regions responsible for subjective assessment and validation."
https://openalex.org/W2064281193,"Protein-tyrosine sulfation is mediated by two Golgi tyrosyl-protein sulfotransferases (TPST-1 and TPST-2) that are widely expressed in vivo. However, the full substrate repertoire of this enzyme system is unknown and thus, our understanding of the biological role(s) of tyrosine sulfation is limited. We reported that whereas Tpst1(-/-) male mice have normal fertility, Tpst2(-/-) males are infertile despite normal spermatogenesis. However, Tpst2(-/-) sperm are severely defective in their motility in viscous media and in their ability to fertilize eggs. These findings suggest that sulfation of unidentified substrate(s) is crucial for normal sperm function. We therefore sought to identify tyrosine-sulfated proteins in the male genital tract using affinity chromatography on PSG2, an anti-sulfotyrosine monoclonal antibody, followed by mass spectrometry. Among the several candidate tyrosine-sulfated proteins identified, RNase 9 and Mfge8 were examined in detail. RNase 9, a catalytically inactive RNase A family member of unknown function, is expressed only in the epididymis after onset of sexual maturity. Mfge8 is expressed on mouse sperm and Mfge8(-/-) male mice are subfertile. Metabolic labeling coupled with sulfoamino acid analysis confirmed that both proteins are tyrosine-sulfated and both proteins are expressed at comparable levels in wild type, Tpst1(-/-), and Tpst2(-/-) epididymides. However, we demonstrate that RNase 9 and Mfge8 are tyrosine-sulfated in wild type and Tpst1(-/-), but not in Tpst2(-/-) mice. These findings suggest that lack of sulfation of one or both of these proteins may contribute mechanistically to the infertility of Tpst2(-/-) males."
https://openalex.org/W2002492372,"Cell surface glycosylation patterns are markers of cell type and status. However, the mechanisms regulating surface glycosylation patterns remain unknown.Using a panel of carbohydrate surface markers, we have shown that cell surface sialylation and fucosylation were downregulated in L1(-/y) neurons versus L1(+/y) neurons. Consistently, mRNA levels of sialyltransferase ST6Gal1, and fucosyltransferase FUT9 were significantly reduced in L1(-/y) neurons. Moreover, treatment of L1(+/y) neurons with L1 antibodies, triggering signal transduction downstream of L1, led to an increase in cell surface sialylation and fucosylation compared to rat IgG-treated cells. ShRNAs for both ST6Gal1 and FUT9 blocked L1 antibody-mediated enhancement of neurite outgrowth, cell survival and migration. A phospholipase Cgamma (PLCgamma) inhibitor and shRNA, as well as an Erk inhibitor, reduced ST6Gal1 and FUT9 mRNA levels and inhibited effects of L1 on neurite outgrowth and cell survival.Neuronal surface sialylation and fucosylation are regulated via PLCgamma by L1, modulating neurite outgrowth, cell survival and migration."
https://openalex.org/W1999060793,"Background Optic flow is an important cue for object detection. Humans are able to perceive objects in a scene using only kinetic boundaries, and can perform the task even when other shape cues are not provided. These kinetic boundaries are characterized by the presence of motion discontinuities in a local neighbourhood. In addition, temporal occlusions appear along the boundaries as the object in front covers the background and the objects that are spatially behind it. Methodology/Principal Findings From a technical point of view, the detection of motion boundaries for segmentation based on optic flow is a difficult task. This is due to the problem that flow detected along such boundaries is generally not reliable. We propose a model derived from mechanisms found in visual areas V1, MT, and MSTl of human and primate cortex that achieves robust detection along motion boundaries. It includes two separate mechanisms for both the detection of motion discontinuities and of occlusion regions based on how neurons respond to spatial and temporal contrast, respectively. The mechanisms are embedded in a biologically inspired architecture that integrates information of different model components of the visual processing due to feedback connections. In particular, mutual interactions between the detection of motion discontinuities and temporal occlusions allow a considerable improvement of the kinetic boundary detection. Conclusions/Significance A new model is proposed that uses optic flow cues to detect motion discontinuities and object occlusion. We suggest that by combining these results for motion discontinuities and object occlusion, object segmentation within the model can be improved. This idea could also be applied in other models for object segmentation. In addition, we discuss how this model is related to neurophysiological findings. The model was successfully tested both with artificial and real sequences including self and object motion."
https://openalex.org/W1993577311,"Transglutaminase-1 (TGase-1) is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent enzyme capable of cross-linking a variety of proteins and promoting wound healing in the skin. In this study, we examined the role of TGase-1 in proliferation of renal proximal tubular cells (RPTC). TGase-1, but not TGase-2, -5, and -7, was expressed in RPTC. Treatment with monodansylcadarevine (MDC), a selective TGase inhibitor or down-regulation of TGase-1 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) decreased RPTC proliferation. Proliferation of RPTC was accompanied by activation of Akt and Stat-3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-3). Treatment with MDC or TGase-1 siRNA decreased Stat-3 but not Akt phosphorylation. Further studies showed that the Janus-activated kinase 2 (JAK2) mediates phosphorylation of Stat-3, and knockdown of either JAK2 or Stat-3 by siRNA decreased RPTC proliferation. However, inhibition of TGase-1 decreased phosphorylation of Stat-3 but not JAK2. Overexpression of Stat-3, JAK2, and/or TGase-1 in RPTC revealed that JAK2 is indispensable for TGase-1 to induce Stat-3 phosphorylation and TGase-1 potentiates JAK2-induced Stat-3 phosphorylation. Consistent with these observations, we found that inhibition of TGase-1 and the JAK2-Stat-3 signaling pathway decreased the transcriptional activity of Stat-3 and expression of the Stat-3-targeted genes, cyclin D1 and cyclin E. Conversely, overexpresssion of TGase-1 enhanced the JAK2-dependent transcriptional activity of Stat-3. Finally, TGase-1 was found to interact with JAK2, and this interaction was inhibited by MDC. These results demonstrate that TGase-1 plays an important role in regulation of renal epithelial cell proliferation through the JAK2-Stat-3 signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1994440449,"Vector construction with restriction enzymes (REs) typically involves the ligation of a digested donor fragment (insert) to a reciprocally digested recipient fragment (vector backbone). Creating a suitable cloning plan becomes increasingly difficult for complex strategies requiring repeated insertions such as constructing multiple short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression vectors for RNA interference (RNAi) studies. The problem lies in the reduced availability of suitable RE recognition sites with an increasing number of cloning events and or vector size. This report details a technically simple, directional cloning solution using REs with compatible cohesive ends that are repeatedly destroyed and simultaneously re-introduced with each round of cloning. Donor fragments can be made by PCR or sub-cloned from pre-existing vectors and inserted ad infinitum in any combination. The design incorporates several cloning cores in order to be compatible with as many donor sequences as possible. We show that joining sub-combinations made in parallel is more time-efficient than sequential construction (of one cassette at a time) for any combination of 4 or more insertions. Screening for the successful construction of combinations using Taq polymerase based PCR became increasingly difficult with increasing number of repeated sequence elements. A Pfu polymerase based PCR was developed and successfully used to amplify combinations of up to eleven consecutive hairpin expression cassettes. The identified PCR conditions can be beneficial to others working with multiple shRNA or other repeated sequences, and the infinitely expandable cloning strategy serves as a general solution applicable to many cloning scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W2087630093,"A model or hybrid network consisting of oscillatory cells interconnected by inhibitory and electrical synapses may express different stable activity patterns without any change of network topology or parameters, and switching between the patterns can be induced by specific transient signals. However, little is known of properties of such signals. In the present study, we employ numerical simulations of neural networks of different size composed of relaxation oscillators, to investigate switching between in-phase (IP) and anti-phase (AP) activity patterns. We show that the time windows of susceptibility to switching between the patterns are similar in 2-, 4- and 6-cell fully-connected networks. Moreover, in a network (N = 4, 6) expressing a given AP pattern, a stimulus with a given profile consisting of depolarizing and hyperpolarizing signals sent to different subpopulations of cells can evoke switching to another AP pattern. Interestingly, the resulting pattern encodes the profile of the switching stimulus. These results can be extended to different network architectures. Indeed, relaxation oscillators are not only models of cellular pacemakers, bursting or spiking, but are also analogous to firing-rate models of neural activity. We show that rules of switching similar to those found for relaxation oscillators apply to oscillating circuits of excitatory cells interconnected by electrical synapses and cross-inhibition. Our results suggest that incoming information, arriving in a proper time window, may be stored in an oscillatory network in the form of a specific spatio-temporal activity pattern which is expressed until new pertinent information arrives."

Cervical length was assessed via transvaginal sonography pre-procedure, 1 and 24 hours post-procedure, and results compared between amnioreduction and control procedures. Amniotic fluid index (AFI) was measured pre- and post-procedure.Pre-procedural cervical length correlated with AFI (linear fit = 5.07 -0.04x, R(2) = 0.17, P = 0.03) in patients with polyhydramnios (n = 28). Drainage of 2000 ml fluid (range 700-3500 ml), reduced AFI from 42 cm to 21 cm (P<0.001). Their pre-procedural cervical length did not change at one (mean Delta:-0.1cm, 95%CI, -0.4 to 0.2) or 24 hours (0.2 cm, -0.1 to 0.6) after amnioreduction. There was no change in cervical length at control procedures.Cervical shortening in twins with polyhydramnios does not appear to be an acute process; cervical length can be measured before or after therapeutic procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2015749994,"The article describes DNA sequences of mammalian genomes that are longer than 50 bases, but consist exclusively of G's and A's (‘pure GA-sequences’). Although their frequency of incidence should be 10−16 or smaller, the chromosomes of human, chimpanzee, dog, cat, rat, and mouse contained many tens of thousands of them ubiquitously located along the chromosomes with a species-dependent density, reaching sizes of up to 1300 [b]. With the exception of a small number of poly-A-, poly-G-, poly-GA-, and poly-GAAA-sequences (combined <0.5%), all pure GA-sequences of the mammals tested were unique individuals, contained several repeated short GA-containing motifs, and shared a common hexa-nucleotide spectrum. At most 2% of the human GA-sequences were transcribed into mRNAs; all others were not coding for proteins. Although this could have made them less subject to natural selection, they contained 160 times fewer point mutations than one should expect from the genome at large. As to the presence of other sequences with similarly restricted base contents, there were approximately as many pure TC-sequences as pure GA-sequences, but many fewer pure AC-, TA, and TG-sequences. There were practically no pure GC-sequences. The functions of pure GA-sequences are not known. Supported by a number of observations related to heat shock phenomena, the article speculates that they serve as genomic sign posts which may help guide polymerases and transcription factors to their proper targets, and/or as spatial linkers that help generate the 3-dimensional organization of chromatin."
