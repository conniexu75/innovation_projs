https://openalex.org/W2077752374,"The observation of vanishing electrical resistance in condensed matter has led to the discovery of new phenomena such as, for example, superconductivity, where a zero-resistance state can be detected in a metal below a transition temperature T(c) (ref. 1). More recently, quantum Hall effects were discovered from investigations of zero-resistance states at low temperatures and high magnetic fields in two-dimensional electron systems (2DESs). In quantum Hall systems and superconductors, zero-resistance states often coincide with the appearance of a gap in the energy spectrum. Here we report the observation of zero-resistance states and energy gaps in a surprising setting: ultrahigh-mobility GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures that contain a 2DES exhibit vanishing diagonal resistance without Hall resistance quantization at low temperatures and low magnetic fields when the specimen is subjected to electromagnetic wave excitation. Zero-resistance-states occur about magnetic fields B = 4/5 Bf and B = 4/9 Bf, where Bf = 2pifm*/e,m* is the electron mass, e is the electron charge, and f is the electromagnetic-wave frequency. Activated transport measurements on the resistance minima also indicate an energy gap at the Fermi level. The results suggest an unexpected radiation-induced, electronic-state-transition in the GaAs/AlGaAs 2DES."

By means of time-resolved, high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy, we unraveled an adsorbate-mediated diffusion mechanism of oxygen vacancies on rutile TiO2(110). Adsorbed oxygen molecules mediate vacancy diffusion through the loss of an oxygen atom to a vacancy and the sequential capture of an oxygen atom from a neighboring bridging oxygen row, leading to an anisotropic oxygen vacancy diffusion pathway perpendicular to the bridging oxygen rows."
https://openalex.org/W1970818558,"The proteasome plays a central role in the degradation of regulatory and misfolded proteins. Current models suggest that substrates access the internal catalytic sites by processively threading their termini through the gated substrate channel. Here, we found that latent (closed) and activated (open) proteasomes degraded two natively disordered substrates at internal peptide bonds even when they lacked accessible termini, suggesting that these substrates themselves promoted gating of the proteasome. This endoproteolysis provides a molecular mechanism for regulated release of transcription factors from inactive precursors as well as a means of accessing internal folding defects of misfolded multidomain proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1972848138,"Explaining the evolutionary maintenance of sex remains a key problem in evolutionary biology. One potential benefit of sex is that it may allow a more rapid adaptive response when environmental conditions change, by increasing the efficiency with which selection can fix beneficial mutations. Here I show that sex can increase the rate of adaptation in the facultatively sexual single-celled chlorophyte Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, but that the benefits of sex depend crucially on the size of the population that is adapting: sex has a marked effect in large populations but little effect in small populations. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the benefits of sex in a novel environment, including stochastic effects in small populations, clonal interference and epistasis between beneficial alleles. These results indicate that clonal interference is important in this system."

We have purified the six Saccharomyces cerevisiae MCM proteins as recombinant proteins inEscherichia coli and have reconstituted the Mcm2-7p complex from individual subunits. Study of MCM ATPase activity demonstrates that no MCM protein hydrolyzes ATP efficiently. ATP hydrolysis requires a combination of two MCM proteins. The fifteen possible pairwise mixtures of MCM proteins yield only three pairs of MCM proteins that produce ATPase activity. Study of the Mcm3/7p ATPase shows that an essential arginine in Mcm3p is required for hydrolysis of the ATP bound to Mcm7p. Study of the pairwise interactions between MCM proteins connects the remaining MCM proteins to the Mcm3/7p pair.

Cell. 1997; 90: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The six proteins (Mcm2-7p) form a heterohexamer that is thought to be the replicative helicase in eukaryotic cells. Consistent with this idea, MCM proteins are required for replication initiation and elongation (3Labib K. Tercero J.A. Diffley J.F.

Although helicase activity with all six MCM proteins has remained elusive, a subcomplex of Mcm4/6/7p is a helicase (6Ishimi Y. J. Biol.

A. 2001; 98: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Similar to replicative helicases in other systems, Mcm2-7p appears to be ring shaped, consistent with electron microscope studies of Mcm2-7p and Mcm4/6/7p (9Adachi Y. Usukura J. Yanagida M.

Biol. 2000; 300: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). An archaeal MCM protein also has helicase activity and is an oligomeric ring (11Chong J.P. Hayashi M.K. Simon M.N. Xu R.M.

Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As their name implies (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities), members of this family are usually ATPases and are involved in many different cellular processes. The structures of some AAA+ family members have been solved, and provide insight into Mcm2-7p structure and function. These structures include the heteropentameric Escherichia coli γ complex clamp loader (16Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), the homohexameric membrane trafficking proteins,N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF) and p97 (17Zhang X.

Wetmur J.G. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). A striking feature of these AAA+ machines is the location of ATP sites at the interface of subunits. Residues from both subunits are thought to be required for ATP hydrolysis. An arginine residue of one subunit is required for hydrolysis of ATP bound to a neighboring subunit. A catalytic Arg residue that reaches across a subunit interface to promote nucleotide hydrolysis is referred to as an arginine finger, first described in the Ras GTP-binding protein and its cognate GAP (GTPase activating protein) (21Ahmadian M.R. Stege P. Scheffzek K. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). These signaling proteins are important regulators of cell growth and differentiation (22Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). When bound to GTP, Ras is active but is inactive when bound to GDP. Ras hydrolyzes GTP very slowly and requires an arginine residue from GAP to promote rapid hydrolysis. Structural and biochemical studies have suggested that the Arg finger in GAP stabilizes the transition state thereby greatly increasing the catalytic rate of the Ras GTPase (21Ahmadian M.R. Stege P. Scheffzek K. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the purification of Mcm2-7p as individual subunits. We find that the Mcm2-7p heterohexamer can be reconstituted from these individual subunits. MCM proteins have been studied alone and in combinations for intrinsic ATPase activity. We find that no individual MCM protein contains significant ATPase activity even though they each have an ATP binding site. ATPase activity is produced by a combination of at least two MCM proteins, implying that ATPase activity requires residues from both subunits (i.e. a catalytic arginine from one subunit and an ATP binding site in another). Although one may anticipate six ATPase pairs, we find that only three different pairwise combinations of MCM proteins have ATPase activity. In-depth study of one of these combinations, Mcm3/7p, demonstrates that Mcm3p contributes a catalytic arginine residue for hydrolysis of ATP bound to Mcm7p. Examination of the fifteen different pairwise combinations of MCM proteins for physical interaction, along with the ATPase data, indicates which subunits contribute catalytic arginine residues and which bind ATP in the other two ATPase pairs. The results also suggest a unique arrangement of MCM proteins in a heterohexameric ring. Tris/sucrose (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10% (w/v) sucrose); Buffer A is 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Buffer B is 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 0.1 mmEDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 10% (v/v, glycerol). Buffer C is 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9 and 0.5 m NaCl. Each of the MCMgenes was amplified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic DNA (S288C, MATα SUC2 mal mel gal2 CUP1 flo1 flo8–1; from ATCC) using either Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) or Elongase enzyme mix (Invitrogen). Yeast genomic DNA was obtained as described previously (23Burke D. Dawson D. Stearns T. Methods in yeast genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory course manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1998Google Scholar). Amplified genes were ligated, as described below, into various pET plasmids so that expression of the MCM genes is under control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and inducible by IPTG. All genes were sequenced to ensure that there were no mutations introduced by PCR. The MCM2 gene was amplified using primer 2D, 5′-d(CTACAATATAACATATGTCTGATAATAGCAGCCGTAGCCGTGAGGAAGATG)-3′, which inserts a NdeI site at the MCM2 start codon, and primer 2U, 5′-(dTAGGAATGGATCCGTTTTAGTGACCCAAGG-3′), which inserts a BamHI site 4-bp downstream of theMCM2 stop codon. The resulting 2632-bp PCR fragment was digested with NdeI and BamHI and was inserted into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET11a (Novagen) to yield pET11a-MCM2. The MCM3 gene was amplified using primer 3D, 5′-d(GATACAAACGTCACATATGGAAGGCTCAACG)-3′ which inserts anNdeI restriction site at the MCM3 start codon, and primer 3U, 5′-d(TTAGTAAACAGAGCTCTGACATCAGAC)-3′, which inserts a SacI restriction site 6-bp downstream of theMCM3 stop codon. The PCR fragment was ligated into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) using the manufacturer's instructions to yield pMD132. The 2923-bp NdeI-SacI fragment from pMD132, containing MCM3, was inserted into theNdeI-SacI sites of pET21b (Novagen) to yield pET21b-MCM3. The MCM4 gene was amplified using the primers, 4D, 5′-d(CTCAAGAACTTCATATGTCTCAACAGTC)-3′, which inserts an NdeI restriction site at the MCM4 start codon and 4U, 5′-d(TGATTGTAGTAGATCTCATCAGACACG)-3′, which inserts aBglII site 3-bp downstream of the MCM4 stop codon. The 2829-bp PCR fragment was ligated into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) to create pMD134. The 2809-bpNdeI-BglII fragment from pMD134, containingMCM4, was inserted into the NdeI andBglII sites of pET11a to yield pET11a-MCM4. The primers used to amplify MCM5 from the yeast genome were 5D, 5′-d(TAACTGCATATGTCATTTGATAGACCG)-3′, which inserts anNdeI restriction site at the MCM5 start codon and 5U, 5′-d(GCTAAGACTTAGATCTTGTCATACACCAC)-3′, which inserts aBglII restriction site 3 bp downstream of theMCM5 stop codon. The-2535 bp PCR fragment was amplified, digested with NdeI and BglII, and then inserted into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET16b (Novagen) to yield pET16b-MCM5. The MCM6 gene was amplified using the primers 6D, 5′-d(CTGGTTTTTTCATATGTCATCCCCTTTTCC)-3′, which inserts anNdeI site at the start codon of MCM6 and 6U, 5′-d(GAAAATCCGCAAGGATCCACTGAATTAGC)-3′, which inserts aBamHI site 8-bp downstream of the MCM6 stop codon. The 3086-bp PCR fragment was digested with NdeI andBamHI and inserted into the NdeI andBamHI sites of pET16b to yield pET16b-MCM6. The MCM7 gene was amplified using primer 7D, 5′-d(GATAGACCAGATCATGAGTGCGGCACTTC)-3′, which inserts aBspHI restriction site at the MCM7 start codon, and primer 7U, 5′-d(GTTGCTTGACGTCGCTGAGCTTTCAAGCGTC)-3′, which inserts aBlpI restriction site 5 bp downstream of the MCM7stop codon. The resulting 2545-bp PCR fragment was inserted into pCR2.10-TOPO to yield pMD131. The 1491-bp BspHI fragment from pMD131, encoding an N-terminal fragment of Mcm7p, was inserted into the NcoI site of pET16b to yield pMD135. A plasmid encoding full-length Mcm7p (pET16b-MCM7) was produced by inserting the 2075-bp BamHI-BlpI fragment from pMD131 into theBamHI-BlpI sites of pMD135. For the Mcm3p SRF mutation, the Arg at residue 542 was changed to alanine so that nucleotides 1761–1765 (numbering begins at the start codon) were changed from 5′-d(TCTCG)-3′ to 5′-d(AGCGC)-3′. The Arg of the Mcm7p SRF motif (R593) was changed to alanine by altering nucleotides 1924–1929 from 5′-d(TCCAGA)-3′ to 5′d(AGCGCA)-3′, also introduces aHaeII restriction site. The lysine at residue 415 in Mcm3p was replaced with alanine by changing nucleotides 1373–1378 from 5′-d(AAGTCC)-3′ to 5′-d(GCTAGC)-3′, which also introduces aNheI restriction site. Lysine 466 in Mcm7p was changed to alanine by PCR. A portion of the MCM7 gene was amplified from an internal BamHI site to a Bsu36I restriction site using the primers 7BAM, 5′-d(CACGATGGATCCACCCTCTTC)-3′, which anneals across theBamHI site and 7KA, 5′-d(GACCAACGCCTGAGGAACCCTTACCAGTGGTATACACTCCTCGAGGTGATATTTTGCAAATGGCCTTCAGCAGTTGAGATGCGGCAACACCGGGATCACC)-3′, which changes the lysine codon to alanine and anneals across theBsu36I site. The amplified fragment was inserted into pET16b-MCM7 digested with the same restriction enzymes. All mutant genes were sequenced to confirm the changes and mutant proteins were purified in the same manner as their wild type counterparts (see below). Expression plasmids were transformed into BL21 DE3 Codon+ RIL cells (Strategene, E. coli B F− ompT hsdS (rB−mB−) dcm +Tetr gal (λDE3) endA Hte (argU ileY leuW Camr)). Fresh transformants were grown in 24 liters of LB containing 100 μg of ampicillin and 25 μg of chloramphenicol per ml to a density of OD600 = 0.5–0.8. Cells were then chilled to 15 °C on ice, and then IPTG was added to 1 mm. Cells were incubated another 20 h with shaking at 15 °C, then pelleted and resuspended in Tris/sucrose (total volume, ∼200 ml). For cell lysis, cells were brought to a final volume of 250–300 ml with a final concentration of 30 mm spermidine, 1m NaCl, and 2 mm DTT in Tris/sucrose. Cells were lysed by two passages through a French Press at 17,000 psi, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 40 min at 4 °C in an SLA1500 rotor. The supernatant was decanted and referred to below as the cell lysate or FrI (Fraction I). FrI of the Mcm2p expression strain was treated with 0.25 g/ml of ammonium sulfate. After stirring at 4 °C, the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 min in a SLA1500 rotor. The resulting supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in Buffer A containing 0.2 g/ml ammonium sulfate and then re-pelleted. After repeating this step, the pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of Buffer A and dialyzed against Buffer A for ∼3 h. The protein was diluted to a conductivity equal to 60 mm NaCl with Buffer A (final volume, 220 ml) and then applied to a 225 ml of Fast Flow Q Sepharose column equilibrated in Buffer A. Protein was eluted with a 2250 ml, 0–600 mm NaCl gradient in Buffer A. Fractions containing Mcm2p, as determined by Coomassie-stained gels, were pooled (FrIII, 200 ml, 1.6 mg/ml) and then precipitated with 0.25 g/ml ammonium sulfate. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of Buffer B and dialyzed against Buffer B for 2.5 h.

The pellet was resuspended in 200 ml of Buffer A containing 0.2 g/ml ammonium sulfate and then re-pelleted. The pellet was resuspended in 200 ml of Buffer A, then dialyzed against Buffer A for ∼3 h. The preparation was diluted with Buffer A to a conductivity equal to 100 mm NaCl (final volume, 400 ml), then applied to a 200-ml Fast Flow Q Sepharose column equilibrated in Buffer A. The protein was eluted with a 2 liter, 0–500 mm NaCl gradient, in Buffer A. Peak fractions containing Mcm3p were pooled (Fr III, 130 ml, 1 mg/ml) and then dialyzed against Buffer B for 2 h. The protein was diluted with Buffer B before it was applied to a 100-ml heparin-agarose column equilibrated in Buffer B. The column was washed in Buffer B, then Mcm3p was eluted with a 1000-ml, 0–500 mm NaCl gradient in Buffer B. Fractions containing Mcm3p were pooled (FrIV, 280 ml, 0.25 mg/ml) and then 0.3 g/ml of ammonium sulfate was added.

The preparation was diluted with Buffer A to a conductivity equivalent to 50 mm NaCl (final volume, 60 ml) before being applied to an 8-ml Mono Q column equilibrated in Buffer A. The column was washed, and then Mcm3p was eluted with a 160-ml gradient of 0–500 mmNaCl in Buffer A. Peak fractions containing Mcm3p were pooled (FrV, 40 ml, 3.3 mg/ml) and stored at −80 °C. FrI containing Mcm4p was treated with 0.3 g/ml ammonium sulfate. After centrifugation at 4 °C and 12,000 rpm in an SLA1500 rotor, the pellet was resuspended in Buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl. Then, 0.25 g/ml ammonium sulfate was added and re-pelleted. This step was repeated two more times. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 150 ml Buffer A, then dialyzed against Buffer A. The protein was applied to a 200-ml Fast Flow Q Sepharose column equilibrated in Buffer A + 100 mm NaCl, and the column was washed with the same buffer. Mcm4p was eluted with a 2-liter, 100–500 mm NaCl gradient in Buffer A. Peak fractions containing Mcm4p were pooled (FrIII, 300 ml, 0.51 mg/ml) and 0.3 g/ml ammonium sulfate was added. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of Buffer B and dialyzed against Buffer B for 4 h. The protein was applied to a 70-ml heparin-agarose column equilibrated in Buffer B with 100 mm NaCl, and then the column was washed in Buffer B containing 100 mm NaCl. Mcm4p was eluted from the column with a 700 ml, 100–500 mmNaCl gradient in Buffer B. The peak fractions containing Mcm4p were pooled (FrIV, 180 ml, 0.12 mg/ml) and precipitated with 0.3 g/ml ammonium sulfate. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of Buffer B and dialyzed against Buffer B for 2.5 h. The protein was applied to a 1-ml Mono S column equilibrated in Buffer B, and the column was washed with Buffer B + 100 mm NaCl. Mcm4p was eluted from the column with a 20 ml, 100–500 mmNaCl gradient in Buffer A. Peak fractions were pooled (FrV, 2.5 ml, 2.8 mg/ml) and stored at −80 °C. Lysis of induced cells harboring pET16b-MCM5 was performed as described above, except that DTT was omitted, the pH was adjusted to 7.9, and 5 mm imidazole was added. After centrifugation to remove cell debris, the supernatant was applied to a 50-ml Ni-charged chelating-Sepharose (AmershamBiosciences) column equilibrated in Buffer C containing 5 mm imidazole. The column was washed with 600 ml of Buffer C containing 5 mm imidazole and then 500 ml of Buffer C containing 60 mm imidazole. Bound proteins were eluted with a 500 ml, 60 mm to 1 m imidazole gradient in Buffer C. Peak fractions containing His-Mcm5p were pooled (FrII, 40 ml, 0.25 mg/ml) and then dialyzed first against Buffer A containing 0.5m NaCl, but no DTT, and then against Buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl. After dialysis, the preparation was clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 rpm in an SS34 rotor at 4 °C, then applied to a 1-ml Mono Q column equilibrated in Buffer A with 100 mm NaCl. The column was washed with the same buffer then eluted with a 20 ml, 100–500 mm NaCl gradient in Buffer A. Peak fractions were pooled (FrIII, 9 ml, 0.5 mg/ml) and stored at −80 °C. The Mcm6p-expressing cells were lysed as described above except that DTT was omitted, the pH was 7.9, and 5 mm imidazole was added to the cell slurry. After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to a 25-ml Ni-NTA Sepharose column equilibrated in Buffer C containing 5 mm imidazole.

The column was eluted with a 40-ml, 100–500 mm NaCl gradient in Buffer A (40 ml). Peak fractions were pooled (FrIII, 65 ml, 0.6 mg/ml), dialyzed against Buffer A for 2 h, and then applied to an 8-ml Mono Q column equilibrated in Buffer A. The column was eluted with an 80 ml, 0.1–0.5 m NaCl gradient. Peak fractions containing Mcm6p were pooled (FrIV, 30 ml, 0.44 mg/ml) and stored at −80 °C. Cell lysate of Mcm7p-expressing cells was treated with 0.3 g/ml ammonium sulfate. After centrifugation for 30 min at 12,000 rpm in an SLA1500 rotor at 4 °C, the pellet was resuspended in Buffer A containing 0.25 g/ml ammonium sulfate and then centrifuged as above. This step was repeated using Buffer A containing 0.2 g/ml ammonium sulfate. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of Buffer A and dialyzed against Buffer A for 2 h (final conductivity equal to 110 mm NaCl). The protein (FrII, 100 ml, 3.6 mg/ml) was applied to a 120-ml Fast Flow Q Sepharose column equilibrated in Buffer A, and the column was washed with the same buffer. The column was eluted with a 1.2-liter, 0–500 mmNaCl gradient in Buffer A. Peak fractions containing Mcm7p were pooled (FrIII, 105 ml, 2.4 mg/ml) and treated with 0.3 g/ml ammonium sulfate. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of Buffer B, then dialyzed overnight against Buffer B containing 100 mmNaCl. The protein was diluted to a conductivity equal to 80 mm NaCl with Buffer B and then applied to a 170 ml Heparin agarose column equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was washed with Buffer B and then eluted with a 1.5-liter, 0–500 mmNaCl gradient in Buffer B. Peak fractions containing Mcm7p were pooled (FrIV, 450 ml, 0.30 mg/ml) and 0.3 g/ml ammonium sulfate was added. After centrifugation the pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of Buffer A and dialyzed against Buffer A for 2.5 h. The protein was diluted with Buffer A before being applied to an 8-ml Mono Q column equilibrated in Buffer A. Bound proteins were eluted with an 80-ml, 0–500 mm NaCl gradient in Buffer A. Peak fractions containing Mcm7p were pooled and then stored at −80 °C. An equimolar amount (44 nmol) of each MCM protein was mixed and concentrated using a Centricon-50 ultrafiltration device at 4 °C to a final volume of 2.5 ml and a conductivity equivalent to 50 mm NaCl in Buffer A. After incubation at 15 °C for 30 min, the sample was applied to a 1-ml Mono Q column equilibrated in Buffer A. The column was eluted with a 20-ml, 0–500 mm NaCl gradient in Buffer A. A portion (3 mg in 250 μl) of the peak fractions containing all six MCM proteins was dialyzed against Buffer A with 50 mm NaCl and then was applied to a Superose 6 gel filtration column as described below. A portion (2 μl) of the peak fractions from the gel filtration column was examined for ATPase activity as described below, except that the reactions were incubated for 60 min at 30 °C. The presence of Mcm2p and Mcm4p in the gel filtration fractions was determined by Western blotting using standard protocols. Gel filtration was performed at 4 °C in Buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl using a Superose 6 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). To test for interactions between MCM proteins, the indicated amounts of proteins were mixed, diluted to a conductivity equivalent or below 100 mm NaCl and then, if necessary, concentrated to 2 mg/ml using a Centricon-50 ultrafiltration device (Amicon). The sample was incubated at 15 °C for 30 min. Any debris was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 rpm in a table top centrifuge, and then the sample was applied to the gel filtration column and eluted in Buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl. After the first 5.9 ml, fractions of 175 μl were collected at 4 °C. A portion of each fraction, as indicated, was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (6%). Densitometric analysis was performed using a laser densitometer and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Nucleotide hydrolysis was measured by thin layer chromatography. For analysis of individual MCM proteins and the pairwise combinations, each reaction (15 μl) contained 1 mm [α-32P]ATP (8–30 μCi/ml; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 2 mm DTT as well as 0.5 μm of each MCM protein. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and then quenched by addition of 15 μl of 50 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. For the Mcm3/7p mutant study, 18 μm of Mcm3p and 0.5 μm of Mcm7p, mutant or wild type, was used, and the reactions were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. A portion (1 μl) of each reaction was spotted onto a polyethyleneimine cellulose thin layer chromatography sheet (EM Science) and then developed in 0.6 m potassium phosphate pH 3.4 for 35 min. The amount of ADP produced was quantitated using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). After determining the volume of the ADP spot and the ATP spot, the amount of ADP produced (in μm) was determined by: ((volume ADP)/(volume ADP + volume ATP)) × 1000 μm.

To test this we constructed E. coli expression plasmids for each MCM protein and purified the individual MCM proteins as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Mcm5p and Mcm6p had low yields and therefore ten histidine residues were placed on the N termini of these proteins for purification by nickel affinity chromatography. Yields were 10–200 mg of pure protein from 24 liters of cell culture. The final preparation of each protein is shown in Fig. 1 A. To determine whether these six recombinant MCM proteins could assemble into a heterohexamer, the six individual MCM proteins were combined and analyzed by ion exchange chromatography on a Mono Q column and then by gel filtration. Results of the Mono Q column showed that several MCM proteins resolved from one another, but toward the end of the gradient all six of the proteins co-eluted, indicating that the Mcm2-7p complex may have assembled (not shown). Some MCM proteins (Mcm2p and/or Mcm4p) appeared in stoichiometric excess, indicating that the putative hexamer formed but eluted along with excess single subunits. Fractions containing the putative Mcm2-7p complex were pooled and analyzed by gel filtration on a Superose 6 column to separate any free proteins from the heterohexamer (Fig. 1 B). All six subunits co-eluted at the expected size of a Mcm2-7p hexamer comprised of one of each subunit (607 kDa) suggesting that heterohexamer had formed. The complex resolves from the excess Mcm2p/Mcm4p and elutes earlier than any of the MCM proteins analyzed individually (compare Figs. 1 and 4 A). Furthermore, the Mcm2-7p complex elutes earlier that any of the pairwise complexes described later (see Fig. 4 B). However, it is still possible that other subcomplexes, comprised of fewer subunits, elute at the same position as Mcm2-7p heterohexamer. Indeed, there appears to be some slight variation in subunit ratios in different fractions (co"

We have identified a novel thiophene diketo acid, 4-[5-(benzoylamino)thien-2-yl]-2,4-dioxobutanoic acid, that selectively inhibits polymerase-independent RNase H cleavage (IC50 = 3.2 μm) but has no effect on DNA polymerization (IC50 > 50 μm). The activity profile of the diketo acid is shown to be distinct from previously described compounds, including the polymerase inhibitor foscarnet and the putative RNase H inhibitor 4-chlorophenylhydrazone. Both foscarnet and the hydrazone inhibit RNase H cleavage and DNA polymerization activities of RT, yet neither inhibits the RNase H activity of RT containing a mutation in the polymerase active site (D185N) or an isolated HIV-1 RNase H domain chimera containing the α-C helix from Escherichia coli RNase HI, suggesting these compounds affect RNase H indirectly. In contrast, the diketo acid inhibits the RNase H activity of the isolated RNase H domain as well as full-length RT, and inhibition is not affected by the polymerase active site mutation. In isothermal titration calorimetry studies using the isolated RNase H domain, binding of the diketo acid is independent of nucleic acid but strictly requires Mn2+implying a direct interaction between the inhibitor and the RNase H active site. These studies demonstrate that inhibition of HIV-1 RNase H may occur by either direct or indirect mechanisms, and they provide a framework for identifying novel agents such as 4-[5-(benzoylamino)thien- 2-yl]-2,4-dioxobutanoic acid that specifically targets RNase H.

This heterodimeric protein is composed of two polypeptide subunits: p66 and p51. The two catalytic activities of reverse transcriptase are carried out within discrete active sites located in the p66 subunit. The N terminus of p66 catalyzes RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, while the p15 domain at the C terminus of p66 catalyzes ribonuclease H (RNase H) activity. RNase H is required to cleave the RNA strand of the RNA:DNA heteroduplex intermediates in reverse transcription. This activity is essential for HIV-1 replication (1Repaske R. Hartley J.W.

All RT inhibitors currently licensed for the treatment of HIV-1 infection inhibit the polymerase activity and bind to the polymerase domain of RT (reviewed in Ref. 4Parniak M.A. Sluis-Cremer N. Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 49: 67-109Google Scholar). Although there are several published examples of compounds that inhibit RNase H activity in vitro(5Loya S. Tal R. Kashman Y. Hizi A. Antimicrob.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14279-14291Google Scholar), it is still unclear whether their affect on RNase H function is mediated by direct binding to the RNase H domain. In some cases, these inhibitors have been shown to affect both the polymerase and RNase H activities of RT (8Borkow G. Fletcher R.S. Barnard J. Arion D. Motakis D. Dmitrienko G.I. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3179-3185Google Scholar, 9Sluis-Cremer N. Arion D. Parniak M.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 398-405Google Scholar), which superficially suggests that these compounds may bind at both active sites. However, several studies have demonstrated that there is significant interdomain communication between the polymerase and RNase H domains of RT (e.g. Ref.12Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4861-4869Google Scholar), and potential allosteric effects on RNase H function are usually not ruled out. In this report we have employed a series of RT polymerase and RNase H mutants to characterize the effects of several known inhibitors on each enzymatic function and to explore the behavior of a novel diketo acid inhibitor of HIV-1 RNase H: 4-[5-(benzoylamino)thien-2-yl]-2,4-dioxobutanoic acid (Compound I, Fig. 1). We demonstrate here that inhibitors that bind to the polymerase domain, such as foscarnet, can inhibit the RNase H activity in the absence of polymerization. The phenylhydrazone (Compound II) previously reported to be an RNase H inhibitor (10Gabbara S. Davis W.R. Hupe L. Hupe D. Peliska J.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13070-13076Google Scholar, 11Davis W.R. Tomsho J. Nikam S. Cook E.M. Somand D. Peliska J.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14279-14291Google Scholar) is also shown to work by this mechanism. In contrast, 4-[5-(benzoylamino)thien-2-yl]-2,4-dioxobutanoic acid selectively binds to and inhibits the RNase H domain of HIV-1 RT. The metal-dependent behavior of this novel RNase H inhibitor is analogous to the mechanism of action proposed for HIV-1 integrase inhibitors of the same structural class (13Hazuda D.J. Felock P.

These studies demonstrate that inhibitors of RNase H function can be either direct or allosteric modulators of activity and suggest that prototype structures that have proven successful in developing integrase inhibitors with potent antiretroviral activity can be exploited to develop selective inhibitors of the RNase H activity of HIV-1 RT. All buffer components were obtained from either Sigma-Aldrich or Ambion, Inc. unless specified. 4-[5-(Benzoylamino)thien-2-yl]-2,4-dioxobutanoic acid (Compound I) was synthesized according to published methods (15Young, S.

[γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) was used to 5′-end-label RNA substrates in standard T4 polynucleotide kinase reactions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The 32-mer PAGE-purified RNA oligonucleotide (tC5U: 5′-CCCCCUCUCAAAAACAGGAGCAGAAAGACAAG-3′) (18Carroll S.S. Olsen D.B. Bennett C.D. Gotlib L. Graham D.J. Condra J.H. Stern A.M. Shafer J.A. Kuo L.C.

The 12-mer DNA oligonucleotide (p12: 5′-GTCTTTCTGCTC-3′) was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. HIV-1 RT mutants D185N (polymerase domain active site) and D443N (RNase H domain active site) were generated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Full-length wild type and mutant RT proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and purified as described previously (19Stahlhut M., Li, Y. Condra J.H., Fu, J. Gotlib L. Graham D.J. Olsen D.B. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 614-621Google Scholar) with two variations: a 20-ml Hi-Prep 16/10 Heparin FF column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) replaced the phosphocellulose P-11 resin, and as a final step, an 8 ml poly(U)-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) was added to eliminate residual E. coli RNase HI. The chimeric isolated HIV-1 RNase H domain protein containing an α-C helix substrate-binding loop derived from E. coli RNase HI (20Stahl S.S. Kaufman J.D. Vikic-Topic S. Crouch R.J. Wingfield P.T. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1103-1108Google Scholar,21Keck J.L. Marqusee S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2740-2744Google Scholar) (p15-EC) was overexpressed from a synthetic codon-optimized gene encoding the HIV-1 NL4–3 sequence, and this protein was purified by methods described previously (21Keck J.L. Marqusee S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2740-2744Google Scholar). RNase H activity was measured in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 6 mm MgCl2, 80 mm KCl, 0.2% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 mmEGTA, and 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO, Pierce Endogen, Inc.). Compounds were preincubated with 5 nm HIV-1 RT for 10 min at 37 °C, and 40-μl reactions were subsequently initiated with 50 nm nucleic acid substrate composed of the 32-mer 5′-[32P]tC5U RNA template annealed to the complementary 12-mer DNA oligomer. Reactions proceeded for 20 min and were quenched with an equal volume of formamide gel-loading buffer. Substrate and product (25-mer) oligomers were resolved on a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gel containing 8 m urea in Tris borate-EDTA buffer (Fig. 2 A), and results were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Cleavage reactions with p15-EC were conducted in the same buffer with magnesium replaced by 2 mm MnCl2. After the 10-min preincubation of 1 nm p15-EC with each compound of interest, reactions were initiated with 200 nm substrate and quenched after 10 min. The two product bands (25-mer and 28-mer) observed with p15-EC reflect the ability of this truncated protein to carry out multiple independent endonuclease cleavages (Fig. 2 B); both bands were summed for quantification. To determine inhibitory potency (IC50), compounds were titrated with 2-fold dilutions (Fig. 2 C). The heterodimeric nucleic acid substrate used in the HIV-1 RT polymerase reactions was generated by annealing pD500, the DNA primer, to t500, the 500 nucleotide RNA template created by in vitrotranscription (22Carroll S.S. Sardana V. Yang Z. Jacobs A.R. Mizenko C. Hall D. Hill L. Zugay-Murphy J. Kuo L.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8243-8249Google Scholar). This primer-template substrate (100 nmfinal concentration) was combined with HIV-1 RT enzyme (5 nm) in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 6 mm MgCl2, 80 mm KCl, 0.2% polyethylene glycol 8000) and immediately mixed with inhibitor or Me2SO (5%) prior to addition of dNTPs (5 μm dNTPs, 5 μm[α-33P]dATP) to initiate the reactions (50 μl total volume). After 1-h incubation at 37 °C, reactions were quenched by EDTA, spotted onto DE81 filter plates (Whatman), and washed (twice with 250 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, once with 250 μl of water, and once with 50 μl of ethanol). After drying for 15 min, 50 μl of scintillation fluid was added prior to quantification via Topcount (Packard). Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were conducted in a MicroCal VP-ITC calorimeter. Protein samples were dialyzed in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 5% glycerol). The p15-EC protein was suspended to 18.6 μm in Buffer A, and 200 μm MnCl2 was added when experiments were conducted with divalent cation. Ligand solutions were made in the same buffer as the protein. After p15-EC was added to the 1.4 ml of calorimeter sample cell and equilibrated at 30 °C with a stirring speed of 490 rpm, a total of 25 aliquots (5 μl) were injected into the cell. The heat released with each injection was measured, and heats of reaction were determined by integration of peak areas. Base-line correction, peak integration, and binding parameters (stoichiometry,K d and ΔH°) were performed using the ORIGIN analysis software. Gibbs free energy (ΔG° = −RT ln(1/K d)) and entropy of binding (TΔS° = ΔH° − ΔG°) were calculated from measured experimental values. Samples were run in triplicate and results were averaged to obtain binding parameters. There are striking structural and functional homologies between HIV-1 integrase and the RNase H domain of HIV-1 RT. Potent and specific compounds containing a diketo acid motif have been shown to inhibit HIV-1 integrase in vitro and in cell culture (13Hazuda D.J. Felock P. Witmer M. Wolfe A. Stillmock K. Grobler J.A. Espeseth A. Gabryelski L. Schleif W. Blau C. Miller M.D. Science. 2000; 287: 646-650Google Scholar). As the purported mechanism of these inhibitors invokes sequestration of the active site divalent metals in integrase, it has been hypothesized that a similar mechanism could be exploited for other phosphotransferase enzymes. In screening a library of diketo acids we identified 4-[5-(benzoylamino)thien-2-yl]-2,4-dioxobutanoic acid (Compound I) as a novel inhibitor of the RNase H activity of HIV-1 RT. In RNase H cleavage assays, the activity of Compound I against full-length wild type HIV-1 RT (IC50 = 3.2 μm, Table I) was as potent as the most active RNase H inhibitors reported previously (8Borkow G. Fletcher R.S. Barnard J. Arion D. Motakis D. Dmitrienko G.I. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3179-3185Google Scholar, 23Arion D. Sluis-Cremer N. Min K-L. Abram M.E. Fletcher R.S. Parniak M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1370-1374Google Scholar). Inhibition of RNase H by Compound I was independent of the order of addition to the assay; reactions initiated by either enzyme or substrate behaved identically. To further characterize this activity, Compound I was also evaluated in RNase H cleavage assays using an RT polymerase active site mutant (D185N) and a chimeric isolated HIV-1 RNase H domain, p15-EC. As expected for a bona fide RNase H inhibitor, the activity of the diketo acid against p15-EC (IC50 = 4.7 μm) was comparable with wild type HIV-1 RT (Table I, Fig. 2) and was only slightly weaker when assayed against the D185N mutant (IC50= 8.8 μm). Compound I did not inhibit E. coliRNase HI activity under similar conditions when tested at concentrations up to 50 μm. Neither the nucleoside RT inhibitor (NRTI) AZT-TP nor the non-nucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI; Compound III) inhibited the RNase H activity of the wild type, D185N, or p15-EC enzymes at concentrations up to 100 μm (TableI).Table IInhibition of HIV-1 RNase H cleavageCompoundWild type, IC50 in MgCl2D185N mutant, IC50 in MgCl2Isolated RNase H (p15-EC), IC50 in MnCl2μmCompound I3.2 ± 1.78.8 ± 1.84.7 ± 3.2Compound II6.1 ± 1.0>100>100Compound III>100>100>100Foscarnet1.8 ± 0.7>100>100AZT-TP>100>100>100Cleavage reactions were conducted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values represent the mean and S.D. of at least three independent experiments. Open table in a new tab Cleavage reactions were conducted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values represent the mean and S.D. of at least three independent experiments. The HIV-1 RT inhibitor foscarnet and a previously described RNase H inhibitor, 4-chlorophenylhydrazone (Compound II), were also effective inhibitors of the RNase H activity of HIV-1 RT. However, in contrast to the diketo acid, both foscarnet and the phenylhydrazone inhibited RNase H cleavage only when the assays were conducted with full-length wild type RT (IC50 = 1.8 and 6.1 μm, respectively) and not with either the D185N mutant or p15-EC (IC50 > 100 μm). The lack of activity observed for foscarnet and Compound II with p15-EC cannot be attributed to the unique manganese requirement for this enzyme. Foscarnet, Compound I, and Compound II were comparably active in RNase H assays using full-length RT when assayed in either 6 mm MgCl2 (IC50= 2–6 μm) or in 2 mm MnCl2(IC50 = 50–100 nm). Although the effect of foscarnet on RNase H function was initially surprising because this compound is well known as a pyrophosphate mimetic inhibitor of RT polymerization, the lack of activity observed with the D185N mutant is consistent with binding at the polymerase active site. These results strongly suggest that foscarnet and Compound II are polymerase inhibitors which indirectly affect RNase H function. Their affect on RNase H activity may be due to an indirect change in either RT conformation or nucleic acid positioning. An allosteric effect on the RNase H function is not unprecedented; several NNRTIs have been shown to enhance RNase H activity. In particular, Compound III (data not shown) and nevirapine (12Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4861-4869Google Scholar) increase RNase H cleavage rates and alter the position and number of cleavage products observedin vitro. To substantiate that the allosteric effect of foscarnet and Compound II on RNase H function is as a result of binding to the polymerase domain of RT, the compounds were evaluated in HIV-1 RT polymerization assays using wild type HIV-1 RT and an active site RNase H mutant (D443N). Wild type HIV-1 RT polymerase activity was inhibited by foscarnet and Compound II as well as AZT-TP and the NNRTI Compound III, but not by Compound I (TableII). The potencies listed are consistent with previously reported values for foscarnet, AZT-TP, and Compound III (17Goldman M.E. Nunberg J.H. O'Brien J.A. Quintero J.C. Schleif W.A. Freund K.F. Gaul S.L.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11363-11367Google Scholar). In contrast to the effect of D185N mutation on RNase H inhibition, polymerase inhibition by foscarnet and Compound II was not affected by the RNase H active site mutation, D443N.Table IIInhibition of HIV-1 RNA-dependent DNA polymerizationCompoundIC50Wild typeD443N mutantμmCompound I>50>50Compound II2.3 ± 1.62.1 ± 0.1Compound III0.04 ± 0.020.01 ± 0.003Foscarnet0.16 ± 0.040.9 ± 0.1AZT-TP0.05 ± 0.030.05 ± 0.04Polymerization reactions were conducted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values represent the mean and S.D. of at least three independent experiments. Open table in a new tab Polymerization reactions were conducted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values represent the mean and S.D. of at least three independent experiments. Under these conditions, Compound II was a moderately potent polymerase inhibitor (IC50 = 2.3 μm). The negligible change in potency observed with the RNase H active site D443N mutant (IC50 = 2.1 μm) is consistent with the observation that both foscarnet and Compound II are affected by the D185N mutation and likely bind at or near the polymerase active site. Although in previously published work Compound II did not inhibit DNA polymerization (10Gabbara S. Davis W.R. Hupe L. Hupe D. Peliska J.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13070-13076Google Scholar), the reaction conditions were not optimal for evaluation; DNA synthesis is not rate-limiting when enzyme is equivalent or in excess of substrate, thus explaining the apparent discordance from results presented here. Unlike foscarnet and the hydrazone, the diketo acid did not inhibit RNA-dependent DNA polymerization of wild type or D443N RT (IC50 > 50 μm). Although all three compounds had activity in RNase H cleavage assays using wild type RT, these results suggest that only Compound I is a selective inhibitor of HIV-1 RNase H catalysis. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were conducted with the isolated RNase H domain hybrid protein (p15-EC) to characterize the interaction between the diketo acid (Compound I) and the RNase H domain of HIV-1 RT. Although no binding was observed either in the absence of metal or in the presence of Mg2+ (Fig. 3 B), a robust signal corresponding to the heat released was detected in the presence of MnCl2 (Fig. 3, A and B). The divalent cation specificity observed for Compound I binding to p15-EC is consistent with the strict manganese requirement for p15-EC catalytic activity and supports the hypothesis that Compound I might interact with metal ions in the RNase H active site. As expected, no change in the heat of reaction was detected when either foscarnet or Compound II were titrated into buffer containing p15-EC (data not shown). For Compound I, the fitted parameters (Fig. 3 B,insert) derived from the ITC studies suggest that there is one binding site (n = 0.9 ± 0.2) on the RNase H domain for the diketo acid with an exothermic reaction upon association as shown by the negative Gibbs free energy and enthalpy changes. In addition, the dissociation constant calculated from the ITC analysis (8.9 ± 3.5 μm) is consistent with the IC50 determined in enzymatic activity assays (3.2 μm, Table I); the slight difference between the values may be due to a shift in solvent proton concentration (pH 7.0versus pH 7.8, respectively). As the ITC studies were performed in the absence of nucleic acid substrate, the observation that binding is metal-dependent and that the calculatedK d is comparable with the observed IC50suggests nucleic acid is not required for either binding of the inhibitor or the active site metals. In summary, we have demonstrated that compounds from the diketo acid structural class can inhibit HIV-1 RNase H catalysis in vitro. Compound I is distinct from previously described RNase H inhibitors, and it selectively inhibits RNase H cleavage without affecting RNA-dependent DNA polymerization. Isothermal titration calorimetry studies confirm a direct interaction with the isolated RNase H domain and demonstrate a requirement for divalent cation. The suggestion that the thiophene diketo acid may interact with metals in the RNase H active site is consistent with the metal sequestration mechanism by which similar compounds affect HIV-1 integrase activity. Compound I also inhibits HIV-1 integrase in vitro (1.9 μm) 2D. Hazuda, personal communication. ; however, the activity relationship for RNase H inhibition is clearly distinct from integrase, as previously described integrase inhibitors with the diketo acid pharmacophore have no effect on RNase H activity (Refs. 13Hazuda D.J. Felock P. Witmer M. Wolfe A. Stillmock K. Grobler J.A. Espeseth A. Gabryelski L. Schleif W. Blau C. Miller M.D. Science. 2000; 287: 646-650Google Scholarand 14Grobler J.A. Stillmock K., Hu, B.

A. 2002; 99: 6661-6666Google Scholar and data not shown). Although Compound I does not inhibit HIV-1 replication in cell culture, it provides an important proof of concept for direct inhibitors of the RNase H activity of HIV-1 RT. This work also outlines methods to distinguish indirect affects on RNase H function by compounds that bind to the polymerase domain and to identify selective RNase H inhibitors that may ultimately lead to the development of novel chemotherapeutics for HIV-1 infection. We are grateful to Steve Young for the synthesis of Compound II, Paul Darke for the use of the VP-ITC instrument, and we appreciate the assistance of Susan Barr during preparation of this manuscript."

Several lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, both receptors were co-immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with specific anti-S1P(1) antibodies, indicating that they form a complex. Second, treatment of airway smooth muscle cells with PDGF stimulated the phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK, and this phosphorylated p42/p44 MAPK associates with the PDGF beta receptor-S1P(1) receptor complex. Third, treatment of cells with antisense S1P(1) receptor plasmid construct reduced the PDGF- and S1P-dependent activation of p42/p44 MAPK. Fourth, S1P and/or PDGF induced the formation of endocytic vesicles containing both PDGF beta receptors and S1P(1) receptors, which was required for activation of the p42/p44 MAPK pathway. PDGF does not induce the release of S1P, suggesting the absence of a sequential mechanism. However, sphingosine kinase 1 is constitutively exported from cells and supports activation of p42/p44 MAPK by exogenous sphingosine. Thus, the presentation of sphingosine from other cell types and its conversion to S1P by the kinase exported from airway smooth muscle cells might enable S1P to act with PDGF on the PDGF beta receptor-S1P(1) receptor complex to induce biological responses in vivo. These data provide further evidence for a novel mechanism for G-protein-coupled receptor and receptor tyrosine kinase signal integration that is distinct from the transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases by G-protein-coupled receptor agonists and/or sequential release and action of S1P in response to PDGF."

In contrast with Mb, which is expressed in muscle tissue in the millimolar range, Ngb and Cygb are expressed at a much lower level (micromolar range) (2Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T.

Flash photolysis studies of Ngb, at normal temperature, show high recombination (k on) and low dissociation (k off) rates for O2 and CO, suggesting a high intrinsic affinity for both ligands. However, since the rate-limiting step in ligand binding to the ferrous deoxy-hx form involves dissociation of the distal HisE7 residue, ligand bindingin vivo is suggested to be low (P50 = 1 Torr) (6Trent III, J.T.

It can be extrapolated that hxHbs are universally spread over the living world and thus may have essential function(s) in cell metabolism. The physiological role of low expressed hxHb is not well understood. Several functions have been suggested.

https://openalex.org/W2160360025,"The underlying causes of type I congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG I) have been shown to be mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in the biosynthesis of the dolichyl-linked oligosaccharide (Glc(3)Man(9)GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichyl) that is required for protein glycosylation. Here we describe a CDG I patient displaying gastrointestinal problems but no central nervous system deficits. Fibroblasts from this patient accumulate mainly Man(9)GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichyl, but in the presence of castanospermine, an endoplasmic reticulum glucosidase inhibitor Glc(1)Man(9)GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichyl predominates, suggesting inefficient addition of the second glucose residue onto lipid-linked oligosaccharide. Northern blot analysis revealed the cells from the patient to possess only 10-20% normal amounts of mRNA encoding the enzyme, dolichyl-P-glucose:Glc(1)Man(9)GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichyl alpha3-glucosyltransferase (hALG8p), which catalyzes this reaction. Sequencing of hALG8 genomic DNA revealed exon 4 to contain a base deletion in one allele and a base insertion in the other. Both mutations give rise to premature stop codons predicted to generate severely truncated proteins, but because the translation inhibitor emetine was shown to stabilize the hALG8 mRNA from the patient to normal levels, it is likely that both transcripts undergo nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. As the cells from the patient were successfully complemented with wild type hALG8 cDNA, we conclude that these mutations are the underlying cause of this new CDG I subtype that we propose be called CDG Ih."

Mounting evidence suggests that both C-terminal extensions and N-terminal truncations help precipitate amyloid plaque formation. Although mechanisms underlying the increased generation of C-terminally extended peptides have been extensively studied, relatively little is known about the cellular mechanisms underlying production of N-terminally truncated Aβ. Thus, we used human NT2N neurons to investigate the production of Aβ11–40/42 from amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) by β-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE). When comparing undifferentiated human embryonal carcinoma NT2− cells and differentiated NT2N neurons, the secretion of sAPP and Aβ correlated with BACE expression. To study the effects of BACE expression on endogenous APP metabolism in human cells, we overexpressed BACE in undifferentiated NT2− cells and NT2N neurons. Whereas NT2N neurons produced both full-length and truncated Aβ as a result of normal processing of endogenous APP, BACE overexpression increased the secretion of Aβ1–40/42 and Aβ11–40/42 in both NT2− cells and NT2N neurons. Furthermore, BACE overexpression resulted in increased intracellular Aβ1–40/42 and Aβ11–40/42. Therefore, we conclude that Aβ11–40/42 is generated prior to deposition in senile plaques and that N-terminally truncated Aβ peptides may contribute to the downstream effects of amyloid accumulation in Alzheimer's disease.

Aβ has classically been described as a 4-kDa peptide, derived from proteolytic processing of APP, varying in length from 40 to 42 amino acids due to C-terminal heterogeneity. The generation of the longer Aβ1–42 peptide is specifically increased by several mutations linked to familial Alzheimer's disease (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5191) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Aβ1–42 is more fibrillogenic than Aβ1–40 in vitro (2Jarrett J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar), consistent with the finding that both diffuse and senile plaques are composed of primarily Aβ peptides that terminate at position 42 (3). However, several N-terminal truncations are also found in Aβ peptides derived from AD brains, demonstrated as early as the first biochemical isolation of Aβ peptides from senile plaques (4Masters C.L.

Also, overexpression of APP harboring disease-associated mutations within the Aβ domain (i.e. A692G and E693G) results in increased secretion of Aβ11–40/42 (8Haass C. Hung A.Y. Selkoe D.J.

Whereas some truncations may be due to the partial degradation of full-length Aβ after secretion of peptides into the extracellular milieu, Aβ peptides beginning with glutamine at position 11 are derived from the membrane-bound β-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE) (10Vassar R.

To generate full-length Aβ, BACE cleaves APP between the methionine and aspartate at position 1 (Asp-1) of the N terminus of Aβ (β-cleavage), resulting in the secretion of a large N-terminal ectodomain, sAPPβ, and the retention of a 99-amino acid C-terminal fragment, C99. To generate N-terminally truncated Aβ, BACE cleaves APP between tyrosine and glutamate at position 11 (Glu-11) within the Aβ domain (β′-cleavage), resulting in the secretion of a slightly larger N-terminal ectodomain, sAPPβ′, and the retention of an 89-amino acid C-terminal fragment, C89. C89 can also be produced by proteolysis of C99 by BACE at Glu-11 (11Liu K. Doms R.W. Lee V.M.-Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3128-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Alternatively, APP may also be cleaved at position 16 by α-secretase (13Esch F.S. Keim P.S. Beattie E.C. Blacher R.W. Culwell A.R. Oltersdorf T. McClure D. Ward P.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1122-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar, 14Sisodia S.S. Koo E.H. Beyreuther K. Unterbeck A. Price D.L. Science. 1990; 248: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar), resulting in secretion of the N-terminal sAPPα along with the retention of an 83-amino acid C-terminal fragment, C83. Membrane-bound C-terminal fragments are subjected to further proteolysis within the transmembrane domain by γ-secretase, with cleavage typically occurring at either position 40 or 42 within the Aβ region. Whereas all of the components of γ-secretase have not been identified, the presenilin proteins are necessary for secretion of Aβ peptides and have been postulated to contain the active site of γ-secretase (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5191) Google Scholar). However, multiple γ-secretases may exist as presenilin is not needed for Aβ1–42 production early in the secretory pathway (15Wilson C.A. Doms R.W. Zheng H. Lee V.M.-Y. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Untransfected non-neuronal cells and murine cells are not well suited toward the study of BACE-derived N-terminally truncated Aβ. Many non-neuronal cells preferentially use the α-secretase pathway at the expense of β-cleavage of APP (13Esch F.S. Keim P.S. Beattie E.C. Blacher R.W. Culwell A.R. Oltersdorf T. McClure D. Ward P.J.

Sweeney D. Gandy S.E. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31894-31902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), consistent with evidence that β′-cleavage is species-specific (23Cai H. Wang Y. McCarthy D. Wen H. Borchelt D.R. Price D.L. Wong P.C. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 233-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). Furthermore, rodent neuronal cells preferentially cleave endogenous APP at position 11, whereas the presence of β′-cleavage in human neuronal cells has not been adequately addressed. Therefore, rodent cell culture models may not accurately reflect the proteolytic processing of APP in human neurons. NT2N neurons are a post-mitotic, terminally differentiated human neuronal cell culture model derived from retinoic acid treatment of the human embryonal carcinoma cell line NTera2/c1.D1 (NT2−) (24Andrews P.W. Damjanov I. Simon D. Banting G.S. Carlin C. Dracopoli N.C. Fogh J. Lab. Invest. 1984; 50: 147-162PubMed Google Scholar, 25Andrews P.W. Dev.

Their high APP expression and β-secretase activity make them amenable to biochemical analysis of both neuronal specific and human-specific characteristics of APP processing (18Forman M.S. Cook D.G.

We have shown that NT2N neurons generate Aβ1–40/42 intracellularly prior to secretion and that endogenous secretion of Aβ1–40/42 from NT2N neurons increases with age in culture (19Wertkin A.M. Turner R.S. Pleasure S.J. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9513-9517Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 20Turner R.S. Suzuki N.

Furthermore, a detergent-insoluble pool of intracellular Aβ accumulates with time in NT2N neurons (28Skovronsky D.M. Doms R.W. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that sAPP and Aβ secretion increase upon neuronal differentiation of NT2N neurons, correlating with BACE expression. Given a recent report (29Holsinger R.M. McLean C.A. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Evin G. Ann. Neurol. 2002; 51: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) that BACE protein expression and activity are increased in AD, we sought to refine further our understanding of APP metabolism in NT2N neurons by examining the effect of exogenous expression of BACE in undifferentiated NT2− cells and differentiated NT2N neurons. We found that the increase in Aβ production due to BACE overexpression was more pronounced in NT2N neurons than in non-neuronal NT2− cells. Furthermore, we found that Aβ11–40/42 is produced endogenously by NT2N neurons and that BACE overexpression increases the secretion of both full-length and truncated Aβ peptides. We further demonstrate that Aβ11–40/42 is generated intracellularly, indicating that Aβ11–40/42 is produced prior to deposition in senile plaques. The effect of BACE expression on the generation of both full-length and N-terminally truncated Aβ underscores the role of BACE activity in the generation of Aβ peptides and indicates that N-terminally truncated Aβ peptides may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. Undifferentiated NTera2/c2.D1 cells were maintained as described previously (26Pleasure S.J. Page C. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1802-1815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Pleasure S.J. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurosci.

Cells were differentiated by twice weekly 10 μm retinoic acid treatments for 5 weeks and then replated (replate 2 neurons) in DMEM with high glucose, 5% FBS, and mitotic inhibitors (10 μm uridine, 10 μm 5-fluoro-2′deoxyuridine, 1 μm cytosine arabinoside, Sigma) to obtain nearly pure NT2N neurons (26Pleasure S.J. Page C. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1802-1815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Greater than 99% pure neurons (replate 3 neurons) (27Pleasure S.J. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 585-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) were isolated by mechanical separation of neurons after brief trypsinization of mixed cultures and replated into 6-well plates coated with Matrigel and poly-d-lysine. Cell lysates were collected in RIPA buffer (0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA in TBS, pH 8.0) in the presence of protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml each of pepstatin A, leupeptin,l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and briefly sonicated. Protease inhibitors were also added to conditioned media samples. Samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 20 min at 4 °C, electrophoresed on 7.5% Tris-glycine acrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose. When indicated, samples were immunoprecipitated with Karen, a goat polyclonal antibody raised against sAPP, prior to electrophoresis. APP and total sAPP were probed with Karen. sAPPα and sAPPβ′ were probed with Ban50, a mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing Aβ residues 1–10, or with NAB228, a mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing Aβ residues 1–11. 2E. B. Lee and V. M.-Y. Lee, unpublished data. sAPPβ was specifically probed with C5A4/2, a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a synthetic peptide (CSEVKM) corresponding to the C terminus of sAPPβ (11Liu K. Doms R.W. Lee V.M.-Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3128-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). sAPPβ′ was specifically probed with C10A4, a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a synthetic peptide (CHDSGY) corresponding to the C terminus of sAPPβ′. The specificity of C5A4 and C10A4 was determined by their lack of immunoreactivity with full-length APP or C-terminal APP fragments, and by blocking experiments in which only peptides with the corresponding free C terminus are able to block immunoreactivity (data not shown). Immunoblots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) after application of species-specific horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). However, for quantification of APP and sAPP, Karen immunoblots were labeled with 125I-protein A (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) after application of a rabbit anti-goat IgG linker. Radiolabeled APP and sAPP were quantified using PhosphorImager analysis (Amersham Biosciences). For detection of BACE, crude membrane fractions were prepared by first collecting cells in hypotonic buffer (10 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7, protease inhibitors) followed by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. After an additional wash with hypotonic buffer, membrane proteins were extracted by sonication of the pellet in 1 m NaCl, 40 mm Tris, 4 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7. The fraction was cleared by another round of centrifugation, and the BACE-containing supernatants were electrophoresed as above and immunoblotted with a rabbit polyclonal anti-BACE (CT) antibody (ProSci, Poway, CA). Cells were incubated in methionine-free DMEM (Invitrogen) for 30 min, labeled with [35S]methionine (250 μCi/ml in methionine-free DMEM supplemented with 5% dialyzed FBS; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 90 min, and chased for 1 h. Cells were treated with 10 μm PMA in Me2SO (Sigma) during the chase period and/or with 10 μm TAPI in Me2SO (Peptides International, Louisville, KY) 30 min prior to and throughout the chase period. Protease inhibitors were added to conditioned media, and sAPP was immunoprecipitated with Ban50 prior to electrophoresis on 7.5% Tris-glycine acrylamide gels. For C-terminal fragment analysis, cells were labeled for 2 h with [35S]methionine in the presence of 200 μm MG132 (Peptides International), rinsed, and lysed in 1000 μl of RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors for immunoprecipitation. Lysates were briefly sonicated, and both lysates and media were cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. C-terminal fragments were immunoprecipitated with 2493, a rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing the C-terminal region of APP, and resolved on 10/16.5% step gradient Tris-Tricine gels. Gels were fixed in 50% methanol, 5% glycerol, dried, and exposed to PhosphorImager plates for visualization. Finally, to detect both secreted and intracellular Aβ, two 10-cm dishes of replate 2 NT2N neurons were infected with recombinant Semliki Forest virus encoding wild type APP695, prepared as described previously (18Forman M.S. Cook D.G. Leight S. Doms R.W. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32247-32253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,30Liljestrom P. Garoff H. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Cells were infected in serum-free medium for 1 h, cultured in complete growth medium for 14 h, and then labeled with [35S]methionine (500 μCi/ml) for 8 h. Conditioned media and RIPA cell lysates were collected, cleared by centrifugation, and immunoprecipitated with 4G8 (Senetek, Maryland Heights, MO) prior to electrophoresis on 10/16.5% step gradient Tris-Tricine gels. Total RNA was extracted from NT2− cells and NT2N neurons with the Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen) as per manufacturer's protocol. RNA concentrations were determined by optical density readings, and equal amounts of RNA were separated on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels. RNA was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and hybridized with a radiolabeled probe generated by either PstI digestion orAccI-HincII double digestion of a BACE cDNA. The blot was washed and exposed to a PhosphorImager plate for visualization. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase levels were obtained by using a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). 28 S and 18 S ribosomes were visualized by staining a duplicate gel with ethidium bromide. NT2− cells were stably transduced with a vesicular stomatitis virus surface glycoprotein (VSV-G) pseudotyped self-inactivating lentiviral vector. 3Watson, D. J., Longhi, L., Lee, E. B., Fulp, C.

To generate the virus, QBI 293A cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated 10-cm dishes. Cells were transfected with pMD.G (containing the VSV-G envelope glycoprotein), pCMVΔR8.2 (containing viral structural, enzymatic, and accessory genes), and SIN-EFp-GFP/SIN-EFp-BACE (containing minimal human immunodeficiency virus-based viral sequences, the elongation factor 1-α promoter, and either a GFP or BACE cDNA) using standard CaPO4 techniques. Media conditioned with viral particles were harvested over 3 days, centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min, and passaged through a 0.45-μm filter to remove any cellular debris. Viral supernatants were added to NT2− cells, and transduced NT2− cultures were subcloned by limited dilution into 96-well plates. Uniform expression was verified either by direct fluorescence for GFP-expressing cells or indirect immunofluorescence with BaceN1, a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the N terminus of BACE (32Huse J.T.

Media conditioned for 10 days were collected in the presence of protease inhibitors and cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Media were immunoprecipitated with 4G8, and immunoprecipitated material was eluted with a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile. Data were collected on an ABI/Perspective (Framingham, MA) Voyager DE-PRO MALDI-TOF instrument in the positive-ion mode at the Protein Microchemistry/Mass Spectrometry Facility of the Wistar Institute (Philadelphia). Samples were spotted to a 100-well plate using α-cyano-4-cinnamic acid matrix (Sigma) at 10 mg/ml. Reflector mode with the accelerating potential at 20 kV was used. External calibration was performed on all samples. Secreted Aβ was detected using ELISA protocols described previously (20Turner R.S. Suzuki N. Chyung A.S. Younkin S.G. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol.

After application of culture media samples, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated BA-27 and BC-05 were used to report Aβ species ending at position 40 and 42, respectively. For quantification of Aβ levels, synthetic Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 purchased from Bachem Bioscience Inc. (King of Prussia, PA) were serially diluted in unconditioned cell culture media to generate standard curves. Monoclonal antibodies, Ban50, BNT77, BA-27, and BC-05 were prepared as described previously (33Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.D. Odaka A. Otvos Jr., L. Eckman C. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G.

To detect intracellular Aβ, cells were washed thoroughly with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors. Lysates were sonicated and spun at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Aβ from RIPA lysates was captured with either JRF/cAβ40/10 or JRF/cAβ42/26, monoclonal antibodies specific for Aβ40 and Aβ42, respectively (36Janus C. Pearson J. McLaurin J. Mathews P.M. Jiang Y.

Prior to studying BACE activity and β′-cleavage in NT2N neurons, we quantified the differences in the expression and proteolytic processing of APP between NT2− cells and NT2N neurons. Whereas both NT2− cells and NT2N neurons express high levels of APP, the two cell types express different isoforms of APP (Fig. 1 A). We have shown previously (19Wertkin A.M. Turner R.S.

A., Gatalica, Z., and Fields, A. P. (2001) Cancer Res. 61, 1375–1381). Expression of PKCβII in the colon of transgenic mice leads to hyperproliferation and increased susceptibility to colon carcinogenesis due, at least in part, to repression of transforming growth factor beta type II receptor (TGF-βRII) expression (Murray, N. R., Davidson, L. A., Chapkin, R. S., Gustafson, W. C., Schattenberg, D. G., and Fields, A. P. (1999)J. Cell Biol., 145, 699–711). Here we report that PKCβII induces the expression of cyclooxygenase type 2 (Cox-2) in rat intestinal epithelial (RIE) cells in vitro and in transgenic PKCβII mice in vivo. Cox-2 mRNA increases more than 10-fold with corresponding increases in Cox-2 protein and PGE2 production in RIE/PKCβII cells. PKCβII activates the Cox-2 promoter by 2- to 3-fold and stabilizes Cox-2 mRNA by at least 4-fold. The selective Cox-2 inhibitor Celecoxib restores expression of TGF-βRII both in vitro and in vivo and restores TGFβ-mediated transcription in RIE/PKCβII cells. Likewise, the ω-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which inhibits PKCβII activity and colon carcinogenesis, causes inhibition of Cox-2 protein expression, re-expression of TGF-βRII, and restoration of TGF-β1-mediated transcription in RIE/PKCβII cells. Our data demonstrate that PKCβII promotes colon cancer, at least in part, through induction of Cox-2, suppression of TGF-β signaling, and establishment of a TGF-β-resistant, hyperproliferative state in the colonic epithelium. Our data define a procarcinogenic PKCβII → Cox-2 → TGF-β signaling axis within the colonic epithelium, and provide a molecular mechanism by which dietary ω-3 fatty acids and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents such as Celecoxib suppress colon carcinogenesis.

Environ. Health Perspect. 1991; 93: 175-179Google Scholar). Carcinogenesis is a multistep process characterized by progressive changes in the amounts or activity of proteins that regulate cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival (1Weinstein I.B. Environ. Health Perspect. 1991; 93: 175-179Google Scholar, 2Fearon E.R. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1990; 61: 759-767Google Scholar). These changes can be mediated through both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Protein kinase C (PKC)1 is a family of ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine protein kinases whose members play central roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 3Murray N.R. Thompson L.J. Fields A.P. Parker P.J. Dekker L. Molecular Biology Intelligence Unit. R. G. Landes Press, Austin, TX1997: 97-120Google Scholar). The discovery that PKC is a major cellular target for the tumor-promoting phorbol esters suggested a role for aberrant PKC signaling in tumor initiation and progression (4Castagna M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Sano K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7847-7851Google Scholar). However, the relative contribution of individual PKC isozymes to carcinogenesis is not well understood. Ultimately, the role of individual PKC isozymes in carcinogenesis will be understood through identification of downstream targets that participate in specific aspects of the transformed phenotype. We have focused our recent efforts on deciphering the role of specific PKC isozymes in the development of colon cancer (5Gokmen-Polar Y. Murray N.R. Velasco M.A. Gatalica Z. Fields A.P.

We have shown that colon carcinogenesis is accompanied by changes in PKC isozyme expression, including a dramatic increase in the level of PKCβII expression (5Gokmen-Polar Y. Murray N.R. Velasco M.A. Gatalica Z. Fields A.P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1375-1381Google Scholar). PKCβII protein levels are elevated in preneoplastic lesions in the colon, aberrant crypt foci, and are further elevated in colon tumors (5Gokmen-Polar Y. Murray N.R. Velasco M.A. Gatalica Z. Fields A.P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1375-1381Google Scholar). To determine whether elevated PKCβII levels contribute to colon carcinogenesis, we developed transgenic PKCβII mice that express elevated PKCβII in the colonic epithelium to levels comparable with those observed in carcinogen-induced colon tumors (6Murray N.R.

Schattenberg D.G. Fields A.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 699-711Google Scholar). We recently characterized the transforming growth factor β receptor type II (TGF-βRII) as a target for PKCβII-mediated transcriptional repression in intestinal epithelial cells and in the colonic epithelium of transgenic PKCβII mice (7Murray N.R. Weems C. Chen L. Leon J. Yu W. Davidson L.A. Jamieson L. Chapkin R.S. Thompson E.A. Fields A.P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 915-920Google Scholar). PKCβII-induced inhibition of TGF-βRII renders intestinal epithelial cells insensitive to growth inhibition by TGF-β and accounts, at least in part, for the colonic hyperproliferation and increased sensitivity to colon carcinogenesis characteristic of transgenic PKCβII mice (6Murray N.R. Davidson L.A. Chapkin R.S. Gustafson W.C. Schattenberg D.G. Fields A.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 699-711Google Scholar, 7Murray N.R. Weems C. Chen L. Leon J. Yu W. Davidson L.A. Jamieson L. Chapkin R.S. Thompson E.A. Fields A.P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 915-920Google Scholar). Our studies to date indicate that PKCβII plays a critical role in the early stages of colon carcinogenesis by inducing the loss of TGF-β responsiveness, thereby imposing a hyperproliferative phenotype, two prominent characteristics of colon cancer. We reasoned that the cellular phenotype induced by PKCβII is mediated through changes in gene expression. Thus, we have initiated a genomic analysis to identify PKCβII target genes in rat intestinal epithelial (RIE-1) cells. Among the gene targets induced by PKCβII is the inducible form of cyclooxygenase, Cox-2. Cox-2 was originally cloned as a phorbol ester-inducible gene (8Hla T. Neilson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7384-7388Google Scholar, 9Jones D.A. Carlton D.P. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9049-9054Google Scholar), and it has been implicated in the etiology of colon cancer in rodents and humans (10Kutchera W. Jones D.A. Matsunami N. Groden J. McIntyre T.M.

Our present data demonstrate that Cox-2 is a specific genomic target of PKCβII and that PKCβII-mediated repression of TGF-βRII depends on Cox-2. Finally, we show that the chemopreventive ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), a known PKCβII inhibitor in vivo and in vitro (7Murray N.R. Weems C. Chen L. Leon J. Yu W. Davidson L.A. Jamieson L. Chapkin R.S. Thompson E.A. Fields A.P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 915-920Google Scholar), inhibits Cox-2 expression, induces TGF-βRII expression, and restores TGF-β responsiveness in RIE/PKCβII cells. RIE-1 cells and derivatives were grown in 5% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as previously described (14Ko T.C. Yu W. Sakai T. Sheng H.M. Shao J. Beauchamp R.D. Thompson E.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3445-3454Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Mid-log-phase cultures were used for all experiments unless otherwise specified. Construction of RIE/PKCβII cells has been described elsewhere (7Murray N.R. Weems C. Chen L. Leon J. Yu W. Davidson L.A. Jamieson L. Chapkin R.S. Thompson E.A. Fields A.P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 915-920Google Scholar). RIE/PKCι cells were produced by infection of RIE-1 cells with a retrovirus containing the full-length human PKCι cDNA. RIE/H-Ras and RIE/Cox-2 cells were generous gifts of Drs. Hongmiao Sheng and Ray DuBois, Vanderbilt University (11Sheng G.G. Shao J. Sheng H. Hooton E.B. Isakson P.C. Morrow J.D. Coffey R.J. DuBois R.N. Beauchamp R.D. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1883-1891Google Scholar). In some experiments, cells were incubated with the ω-3 fatty acid EPA (Cayman Biochemicals) at the concentrations and for the times indicated in the figure legends. In some cases, cells were incubated with 25 μm Celecoxib (UTMB Pharmacy) and/or 120 pm TGF-β1 (BD Biosciences) in the culture medium for the times indicated in the figure legends. EPA and Celecoxib were solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). A final Me2SO concentration of 0.1% was used for all treatments, and 0.1% Me2SO was used as a diluent control. The stability of the Cox-2 mRNA was determined in RIE-1 and RIE/PKCβII cells by treatment of cells with 25 μm 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside to inhibit RNA polymerase II. Total cellular RNA was isolated as described previously (14Ko T.C. Yu W. Sakai T. Sheng H.M. Shao J. Beauchamp R.D. Thompson E.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3445-3454Google Scholar) at various times after dichlorobenzimidazole riboside exposure and subjected to real-time RT-PCR analysis for Cox-2 mRNA expression as described below. For immunoblot analysis, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in protein lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) for 30 min on ice. After removing particulate matter by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min, aliqouts of total cellular protein (50 μg) were electrophoresed in 10% acrylamide Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membranes were incubated with 5% nonfat dried milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) overnight at 4 °C to block excess protein sites. Membranes were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against PKCβI (Santa Cruz; 1:2,000 dilution), PKCβII (Santa Cruz; 1:6,000 dilution), Cox-2 (Cayman; 1:1,000 dilution), TGF-βRII (Santa Cruz; 1:1,000 dilution), or actin (Santa Cruz; 1:10,000 dilution) in TBST at room temperature for 3 h, after which the membranes were washed in TBST three times for 15 min each. The membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories,1:125,000 dilution) in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed three times in TBST for 15 min each, and antigen-antibody complexes were detected using chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transgenic PKCβII mice expressing PKCβII in the colonic epithelium were characterized previously (6Murray N.R. Davidson L.A. Chapkin R.S. Gustafson W.C. Schattenberg D.G. Fields A.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 699-711Google Scholar, 7Murray N.R. Weems C. Chen L. Leon J. Yu W. Davidson L.A. Jamieson L. Chapkin R.S. Thompson E.A. Fields A.P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 915-920Google Scholar). Transgenic PKCβII mice and nontransgenic littermates were administered 6 mg/kg Celecoxib by oral gavage twice daily for 3 days. As controls, some mice were administered an equivalent volume of diluent (0.5% carboxylmethylcellulose). Mice were terminated on the morning of the fourth day. The colonic epithelium was isolated by scraping and subjected to immunoblot analysis for TGF-βRII expression as described previously (7Murray N.R. Weems C. Chen L. Leon J. Yu W. Davidson L.A. Jamieson L. Chapkin R.S. Thompson E.A. Fields A.P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 915-920Google Scholar). Total RNA from RIE-1, RIE/PKCβII, and RIE/Cox-2 cells was isolated by the guanidinium-thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Total RNA (10 μg) from each cell line was electrophoresed in 1% agarose gels containing 0.66 m formaldehyde and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Intermountain Scientific Corp). After incubation at 80 °C for 2 h, the membranes were prehybridized for 2h in a solution containing 50% formamide in 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 5× SSPE (750 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4 pH 7.4, 5 mmEDTA), and 100 μg/ml single-stranded sperm DNA and then hybridized overnight at 42 °C with a radiolabeled cDNA probe to the rat Cox-2 gene consisting of 0.81 kb of the rat Cox-2 cDNA excised from PCB7-cox2. The probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (800 Ci/mm, PerkinElmer) by the random priming method (Amersham Biosciences). After hybridization, membranes were washed three times in 0.1× SSPE, 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 55 °C and exposed to Eastman Kodak X-Omat AR film at 80 °C. The intensity of the autoradiographic signal was quantified by a Lynx densitometer (Applied Imaging). To verify equivalency of RNA loading of individual samples, the blot was stripped of radioactivity and rehybridized with an 18S rRNA probe as described previously (14Ko T.C. Yu W. Sakai T. Sheng H.M. Shao J. Beauchamp R.D. Thompson E.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3445-3454Google Scholar). PGE2 analysis was conducted on equal numbers of RIE-1, RIE/PKCβII, and RIE/Cox-2 cells cultured in 100-mm tissue culture plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum for 2 days. Aliquots of culture medium (50 μl) were collected and subjected to a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for PGE2 (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. Culture medium was diluted or concentrated appropriately to achieve values within the linear range of the assay (50–6400 pg/ml). The range of the standard PGE2 curve was from 2.5 pg to 320 pg/well. Triplicate samples were analyzed in each experiment, and the results were expressed as pg of PGE2/ml of culture medium. Cox-2 promoter activity and TGF-β transcriptional responses were assessed by transient transfection of RIE-1, RIE/PKCβII, or RIE/H-Ras cells with either a Cox-2 promoter or TGF-β-responsive promoter construct linked to a luciferase reporter gene, respectively. Cox-2 promoter activity was determined using 4 kb of the mouse Cox-2 promoter cloned into the PGL3 reporter plasmid (16Inoue H. Nanayama T. Hara S. Yokoyama C. Tanabe T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 51-54Google Scholar). TGF-β transcriptional responses were assessed using the 3TP-Luc reporter as described previously (7Murray N.R. Weems C. Chen L. Leon J. Yu W. Davidson L.A. Jamieson L. Chapkin R.S. Thompson E.A. Fields A.P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 915-920Google Scholar). The appropriate expression vector was cotransfected with TK-pRL (Renilla luciferase transcribed from the HSV TK promoter) into 70–80% confluent RIE-1, RIE/PKCβII, or RIE/H-ras cell lines in 6-well plates using Tfx-50 (Promega) at a DNA:liposome ratio of 1:3 as described previously (7Murray N.R. Weems C. Chen L. Leon J. Yu W. Davidson L.A. Jamieson L. Chapkin R.S. Thompson E.A. Fields A.P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 915-920Google Scholar). Fresh medium was added 3 h after transfection, and cells were harvested after 24 h. Total cell extracts were prepared for dual-luciferase assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega) using a Monolight 2010 Luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). The activity of Renilla luciferase was used as an internal control. Results are expressed as the mean of triplicate determinations ± standard deviation. Gene-profiling analysis was performed on RIE-1 and RIE/PKCβII cells using RG-U34A Gene Chips® microarrays (Affymetrix). Total RNA (25 μg) was used for first-strand cDNA synthesis using a T7–(dT)24 oligomer (5′-GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCGG-dT24–3′) and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The cDNA was converted to double-stranded DNA by transcription in vitro. cRNAs were synthesized using bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of biotinylated nucleotides. Biotin-labeled target RNAs were fragmented to a mean size of 200 bases according to the manufacturer's protocol. Hybridization of the rat RG-U34A microarrays was performed at 45 °C for 16 h in 0.1 m 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid (MES) pH 6.6, 1 m NaCl, 0.02 m EDTA, and 0.01% Tween 20. Microarrays were washed using both nonstringent (1m NaCl, 25 °C) and stringent (1 m NaCl, 50 °C) conditions prior to staining with phycoerythrin-labeled streptavidin (10 μg/ml final concentration). Data were collected using a Gene Array Scanner (Hewlett Packard) and analyzed using the Affymetrix Gene Chip Analysis Suite 5.0 software. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (real time RT-PCR) assays were used to determine gene expression using TaqMan technology on an Applied Biosystems 7000 sequence detection system. Applied Biosystems Assays-By-Design containing a 20× assay mix of primers and TaqMan MGB probes (FAMTM dye-labeled) were used for all target genes and the endogenous control, rat β-actin. These assays were designed using primers that span exon-exon junctions so as not to detect genomic DNA. All primer and probe sequences were searched against the Celera data base to confirm specificity. The primer and probe sequences used were as follows: rat PAI1-probe spanning exon8 CCAACAGAGACAATCC, forward primer ACCGATCCTTTCTCTTTGTGGTT, reverse primer CATCAGCTGGCCCATGAAG; rat Cox-2-probe spanning exon8 CCCAGCAACCCGG, forward primer GAGTCATTCACCA-GACAGATTGCT, reverse primer GTACAGCGATTGGAACATTCCTT; human PKCβII-probe spanning the PKCβI/PKCβII alternative splice junction TCGCCCACAAGCT, forward primer AAACTTGAACGCAAAGAGATCCA, reverse primer ATCGGTCGAAGTTTTCAGCATT. The efficiency of target amplification was validated using a reference amplification reaction. Absolute values of the slope of log input RNA amount versus ΔCT were <0.1 in all experiments. One-step RT-PCR reactions were performed on 20 ng of input RNA for both target genes and endogenous controls using the TaqMan one-step RT-PCR master mix reagent kit (Applied Biosystems). The cycling parameters were as follows: reverse transcription, 48 °C for 30 min; AmpliTaq activation, 95 °C for 10 min; denaturation, 95 °C for 15 s; and annealing/extension, 60 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles. Duplicate CT values were analyzed in Microsoft Excel using the comparative CT(ΔΔCT) method as described by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems). Our recent studies demonstrated that elevated expression of PKCβII in the colonic epithelium is an early, promotive event in colon carcinogenesis (5Gokmen-Polar Y. Murray N.R. Velasco M.A. Gatalica Z. Fields A.P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1375-1381Google Scholar, 6Murray N.R. Davidson L.A. Chapkin R.S. Gustafson W.C. Schattenberg D.G. Fields A.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 699-711Google Scholar, 7Murray N.R. Weems C. Chen L. Leon J. Yu W. Davidson L.A. Jamieson L. Chapkin R.S. Thompson E.A. Fields A.P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 915-920Google Scholar). To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which PKCβII mediates increased colon carcinogenesis, we established a cell model system in which to explore PKCβII-mediated signaling. RIE-1 cells are immortalized but not transformed and consequently express abundant PKCβI but little or no detectable PKCBII protein (Fig. 1 A). This pattern of expression of PKCβI and PKCβII is consistent with that observed in the colonic epithelium in vivo (5Gokmen-Polar Y. Murray N.R. Velasco M.A. Gatalica Z. Fields A.P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1375-1381Google Scholar). To assess the cellular and genomic effects of PKCβII expression, we created the RIE/PKCβII cell line that expresses abundant human PKCβII (Fig. 1 A). A real-time RT-PCR assay for human PKCβII mRNA demonstrated that RIE/PKCβII cells expressed human PKCβII mRNA at levels somewhat lower than those observed in human HEK293 cells, which express abundant endogenous PKCβII protein (Fig. 1 B). We previously demonstrated that the growth rate of RIE/PKCβII cells is indistinguishable from that of RIE-1 cells (7Murray N.R. Weems C. Chen L. Leon J. Yu W. Davidson L.A. Jamieson L. Chapkin R.S. Thompson E.A. Fields A.P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 915-920Google Scholar), indicating that overexpression of PKCβII has no significant effect on proliferation or apoptosis of RIE-1 cells in culture. Similarly, no changes in gross cellular morphology were noted in RIE/PKCβII cells, nor were these cells able to form colonies in soft agar, indicating that expression of PKCβII is not sufficient to cause cellular transformation (data not shown). Affymetrix Gene Chips® were used to identify genes that are either induced or inhibited in RIE/PKCβII cells when compared with RIE-1 cells. Significance analysis of microarrays (17Tusher V. Tibshirami R. Chu C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Google Scholar) was used to compare expression profiles of RNA extracted from control RIE-1 cells (n = 7) and RIE/PKCβII cells (n = 3). Among the probe sets whose expression changed by >2.0-fold in RIE/PKCβII cells was that encoding the inducible form of cyclooxygenase, Cox-2. Because Cox-2 expression can be induced by phorbol esters (8Hla T. Neilson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7384-7388Google Scholar, 9Jones D.A. Carlton D.P. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9049-9054Google Scholar), and because of the strong association between Cox-2 expression and colon cancer (10Kutchera W. Jones D.A. Matsunami N. Groden J. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. White R.L. Prescott S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4816-4820Google Scholar, 11Sheng G.G. Shao J. Sheng H. Hooton E.B. Isakson P.C. Morrow J.D. Coffey R.J.

Cell. 1996; 87: 803-809Google Scholar), we focused our analysis on this gene. We confirmed our microarray analysis using a quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay specific for Cox-2 mRNA (Fig.2 A). The mean signal intensities obtained from Cox-2 probe sets in microarrays from RIE-1 (n = 7) and RIE/PKCβII (n = 3) cells (gray bars) correlated well with the level of Cox-2 mRNA detected by real time RT-PCR (black bars), providing independent confirmation of elevated expression of Cox-2 RNA in RIE/PKCβII cells. Northern blot analysis indicated that Cox-2 mRNA expression was increased >10-fold in RIE/PKCβII cells when compared with RIE-1 cells (Fig. 2 B), providing an independent confirmation of the microarray and real-time RT-PCR data. As a positive control, RIE/Cox2 cells, which express a Cox-2 transgene that is deleted of the 3′-untranslated region (18O'Mahony C.A. Beauchamp R.D. Albo D. Tsujii M. Sheng H.M. Shao J. Dubois R.N. Berger D.H. Surgery. 1999; 126: 364-370Google Scholar), was used to compare the abundance of Cox-2 mRNA in RIE/PKCβII cells expressing the endogenous, full-length Cox-2 transcript. The data in Fig.2 B indicate that Cox-2 mRNA is even more abundant in RIE/PKCβII cells than in RIE/Cox2 cells. Real-time RT-PCR analysis confirmed that RIE/PKCβII cells express 1.4-fold more PKCβII mRNA than RIE/Cox-2 cells. Taken together, these data provide conclusive evidence that Cox-2 mRNA is induced by PKCβII in RIE-1 cells. Immunoblot analysis was used to assess the level of Cox-2 protein expression in RIE-1, RIE/PKCβII, and RIE/Cox2 cells (Fig.3 A). Cox-2 protein was expressed at nearly undetectable levels in RIE-1 cells. In contrast, RIE/PKCβII cells expressed abundant Cox-2 protein comparable with the amount of Cox-2 protein expressed in RIE/Cox2 cells. To assess whether induction of Cox-2 expression is specific for PKCβII expression, we assayed Cox-2 protein levels in RIE/PKCι cells, which were engineered to overexpress transgenic human PKCι (Fig. 3 B). RIE/PKCι cells expressed very low levels of Cox-2 (which could be observed only after very long exposures of the immunoblots) comparable with those observed in RIE-1 cells. These results are consistent with our microarray analysis of RIE/PKCι cells, which did not identify Cox-2 as a potential transcriptional target of PKCι (data not shown). These results indicate that induction of Cox-2 is not a general response to the expression of any PKC isozyme, but rather is a specific response to PKCβII expression. To assess whether the Cox-2 protein expressed in RIE/PKCβII cells was functional, RIE-1, RIE/PKCβII, and RIE/Cox-2 cells were assayed for production of PGE2, a product of Cox-2 enzyme activity (Fig.3 C). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis of culture supernatants demonstrated that RIE/PKCβII cells, like RIE/Cox2 cells, secreted 3- to 4-fold higher levels of PGE2 than RIE-1 cells. These results demonstrate that PKCβII induced the expression of active Cox-2 enzyme in RIE/PKCβII cells. We next wished to determine whether Cox-2 is also a target for PKCβII regulation in the colonic epithelium in vivo. We have developed transgenic PCKβII mice overexpressing PKCβII in the colonic epithelium that exhibit an increased sensitivity to azoxymethane-mediated colon carcinogenesis (6Murray N.R. Davidson L.A. Chapkin R.S. Gustafson W.C. Schattenberg D.G. Fields A.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 699-711Google Scholar, 7Murray N.R. Weems C. Chen L. Leon J. Yu W. Davidson L.A. Jamieson L. Chapkin R.S. Thompson E.A. Fields A.P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 915-920Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of colonic epithelium from nontransgenic and transgenic PKCβII mice demonstrate that transgenic PKCβII mice expressed significantly more PKCβII and Cox-2 protein than their nontransgenic littermates (Fig.3 D). These data demonstrate that Cox-2 is a significant genomic target of PKCβII both in RIE-1 cells in culture and in the colonic epithelium in vivo. We next assessed the mechanism by which PKCβII leads to elevated Cox-2 mRNA levels in RIE-1 cells. For this purpose, a Cox-2 promoter/luciferase reporter gene was transiently cotransfected into RIE-1 cells along with a PKCβII expression vector to assess the effect of PKCβII on Cox-2 promoter activity (Fig.4 A). The activity of the Cox-2/luciferase reporter was increased by 2- to 3-fold in RIE-1 cells in which a PKCβII expression vector was simultaneously introduced. These experiments utilized a human Cox-2 promoter construct consisting of 4 kb of 5′-flanking sequence, but consistent results were also obtained using promoters containing 7 kb or 1.4 kb of 5′-flanking sequence (data not shown). To independently assess the effect of PKCβII expression on Cox-2 promoter activity, the Cox-2 promoter/luciferase reporter was transfected into RIE-1, RIE/PKCβII, and RIE/Ras cells, and the activity of the reporter w"

The ArabidopsisH+/Ca2+ exchanger CAX1 contains an N-terminal autoinhibitory domain that prevents Ca2+transport when CAX1 is heterologously expressed in yeast. Using a yeast screen, we have identified three different proteins that activate CAX1. One of these, CXIP1 (CAX-interactingprotein-1; 19.3 kDa) has amino acid similarity to the C terminus of PICOT (protein kinase C-interacting cousin ofthioredoxin) proteins. Although PICOT proteins are found in a variety of organisms, a function has not been previously ascribed to a plant PICOT protein. We demonstrate that CXIP1 activated the CAX1 homolog CAX4, but not CAX2 or CAX3. An Arabidopsis homolog of CXIP1 (CXIP2) weakly activated CAX4, but not CAX1. In a yeast two-hybrid assay, CXIP1 interacted with the N terminus of CAX1. In competition analysis, CXIP1 and a CAX1 N-terminal peptide appeared to bind to similar N-terminal domains of CAX1. Chimeric CAX3 constructs containing the N terminus of CAX1 were activated by CXIP1. InArabidopsis, CXIP1transcripts, likeCAX1, accumulated in response to different metal conditions. This work thus characterizes a new class of signaling molecules in plants that may regulate CAX transporters in vivo. Regulation of Ca2+ transporters is a vital component of signaling.

This work thus characterizes a new class of signaling molecules in plants that may regulate CAX transporters in vivo. Ca2+ signal transduction requires the judicious control of cytosolic Ca2+ levels. Cytosolic “Ca2+ spikes” are either directly or indirectly translated into biological responses that govern all aspects of growth and development (1McAnish M.R. Heatherington A.M. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 32-36Google Scholar, 2Sanders D. Pelloux J. Brownlee C. Harper J.F. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: S401-S417Google Scholar). Endomembrane Ca2+ transporters are believed to play an important role in specifying the duration and amplitude of these cytosolic Ca2+ fluctuations (2Sanders D. Pelloux J. Brownlee C. Harper J.F.

Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of these Ca2+transporters is a fundamental component in dissecting signaling specificity. Expression in yeast has facilitated the cloning of numerous plant genes, including plant endomembrane Ca2+ transporters (4Hirschi K.D. Zhen R.G. Cunningham K.W. Rea P.A. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8782-8786Google Scholar,5Sze H. Liang F. Hwang I. Curran A.C. Harper J.F. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 51: 433-462Google Scholar). Initially, plant H+/Ca2+ antiporter genes were cloned by their ability to suppress the Ca2+-hypersensitive phenotype of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant (4Hirschi K.D. Zhen R.G. Cunningham K.W. Rea P.A. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8782-8786Google Scholar, 6Ueoka-Nakanishi H. Tsuchiya T. Sasaki M. Nakanishi Y. Cunningham K.W. Maeshima M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3090-3098Google Scholar). These genes are termedCAX for cation exchangers, and CAX1 from Arabidopsis thaliana is a high capacity Ca2+ transporter. Arabidopsis appears to have up to 11 other putative cation/H+ antiporters (CAX2–11 and MHX) (7Mäser P. Thomine S. Schroeder J.I. Ward J.M. Hirschi K. Sze H. Talke I.N. Amtmann A. Maathuis F.J.M. Sanders D. Harper J.F. Tchieu J. Gribskov M. Persans M.W. Salt D.E. Kim S.A. Guerinot M.-L. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1646-1667Google Scholar). CAX1, CAX2, CAX4, and MHX have been shown to localize to the plant vacuole (8Shaul O. Hilgemann D.W. de-Almeida-Engler J. Van Montagu M.V. Inze D. Galili G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3973-3980Google Scholar, 9Hirschi K.D. Korenkov V.D. Wilganowski N.L. Wagner G.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 125-134Google Scholar, 10Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D.

The activity of CAX1 appears to be regulated by an N-terminal autoinhibitory domain that was absent in the initial clone characterized by heterologous expression in yeast (12Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1020-1029Google Scholar, 13Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26452-26459Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of deregulated CAX1 missing the N-terminal autoinhibitor (sCAX1) in tobacco increases Ca2+ levels in the plants and causes numerous stress-sensitive phenotypes often associated with Ca2+ deficiencies (14Hirschi K.D. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2113-2122Google Scholar, 15Hirschi K. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 100-104Google Scholar). Thus, a wide range of environmental responses appear to require regulation of CAX1 transport activity; however, the mechanism by which CAX1 transport becomes activated is currently not understood. From recent studies, it has become clear that the N termini of particular plant Ca2+-ATPases act as points of convergence between Ca2+-signaling molecules that can both positively and negatively regulate Ca2+ transport (3Harper J.F. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 395-397Google Scholar, 5Sze H. Liang F. Hwang I. Curran A.C. Harper J.F. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 51: 433-462Google Scholar). A Ca2+-dependent protein kinase competes with calmodulin for binding to the N termini of these Ca2+-ATPases to negatively regulate pump activity (16Hwang I. Sze H. Harper J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6224-6229Google Scholar). Interestingly, the N terminus of CAX1 does not contain a calmodulin-binding site, and biochemical studies show that CAX1 cannot be activated by exogenous calmodulin (12Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1020-1029Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of an activated Ca2+-dependent protein kinase in yeast strains harboring CAX1 does not alter activity. 1J. K. Pittman and K. D. Hirschi, unpublished observations. 1J. K. Pittman and K. D. Hirschi, unpublished observations. These findings strongly suggest that a unique set of signal transduction molecules physically interact with the N terminus of CAX1 to modulate Ca2+ transport. We propose that one possible mechanism of activation of CAX1 is through a protein cofactor that directly interacts with the antiporter. In this work, we have utilized autoinhibited CAX1 in a yeast screen to identify and characterize plant gene products that activate CAX1-mediated H+/Ca2+ transport. We have characterized the specificity of this activation and the regions of CAX1 involved in the physical interaction between CAX1 and one of these activators. This study details a new class of signaling molecules in plants that may be involved in activation of H+/Ca2+ transporters in plants.

Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Google Scholar) was used in all yeast experiments involving the expression of CAX genes with or withoutCXIP (CAX-interactingprotein) genes. Yeast strain Y190 (MAT a gal4 gal180 his3 trp1-901 ade2-101 ura3-52 leu2-3,112 + URA3::GAL→ lacZ, LYS2::GAL(UAS) →HIS3 cyh r) was used in the yeast two-hybrid assay (18Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Google Scholar). The A. thaliana Columbia ecotype was used in this study. Yeast strain K667 expressing CAX1, which is hypersensitive to high concentrations of Ca2+, was transformed with an A. thaliana (ecotype Landsberg) cDNA library constructed in the episomal yeast-Escherichia colishuttle vector pFL61 (19Minet M. Dufour M.E. Lacroute F. Plant J. 1992; 2: 417-422Google Scholar). Stable transformants were selected on synthetic complete medium lacking His and Ura (20Sherman F. Hicks J.B. Fink G.R. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Of these, ≈2 × 105 colonies were replicated onto yeast extract/peptone/dextrose (YPD) medium supplemented with 200 mm CaCl2 to identify Ca2+-tolerant transformants. cDNA clones of interest were isolated, and plasmid DNA was retransformed into the CAX1-expressing K667 yeast cells to confirm that the activation of CAX1 Ca2+ transport activity was attributable to the Arabidopsis cDNA inserts. All cDNA inserts were subcloned into pBluescript and completely sequenced. Yeast cells expressing aCAX gene (CAX1, CAX3, orCAX4 or chimeric CAX constructs) with the CXIP1gene were assayed on YPD medium supplemented with 200 mmCaCl2 (13Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26452-26459Google Scholar, 21Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43152-43159Google Scholar). Chimeric CAX constructs sCAX3-β, sCAX3-γ, sCAX3-δ, sCAX1-α, sCAX3-α1, and sCAX1-9 were constructed in a previous study (21Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43152-43159Google Scholar). Amino acid substitutions were introduced into the CXIP1 PICOT (protein kinase C-interacting cousin ofthioredoxin) homology domain (HD)2 using a modified phoenix mutagenesis protocol with the Type IIS restriction enzymeBsmBI (22Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 118-120Google Scholar). To change amino acids CGFS to AAAA, forward primer 5′-GAA TCC CGT CTC CCC ATG GCT GCG GCA GCC AAC ACT GTG GTT CAG ATT TTG-3′ (where italic letters indicate the mutated residues) and reverse primer 5′-G AAA GGA ACG AGA GAC TTC CCC ATG GAG ACG GAA TTC-3′ were used.

All mutant constructs were completely sequenced and subcloned into the yeast expression vector piHGpd (23Nathan D.F. Vos M.H. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1409-1414Google Scholar). mRNA transcript expression in yeast cells was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR (24Witte S. Villalba M. Bi K. Liu Y.-H. Isakov N. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1902-1909Google Scholar). A. thaliana (ecotype Columbia) seeds were germinated in artificial soil (Metro-Mix 200, Scotts, Marysville, OH) and grown under continuous light. Sample preparation and RNA extraction were performed as previously described (14Hirschi K.D. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2113-2122Google Scholar). To analyze gene expression, 20 μg of total RNA was loaded onto a formaldehyde-containing 1.0% agarose gel and blotted onto nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Filters were hybridized overnight at 42 °C with a32P-labeled gene-specific probe in 2× SSC and 50% formamide, washed twice with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS and twice with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS (both at 55 °C), and exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −80 °C for an appropriate time. Microsomal membrane-enriched vesicles were isolated from yeast as described previously (13Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26452-26459Google Scholar). Time-dependent H+/Ca2+ transport into endomembrane vesicles was examined using the direct filtration method as described previously (12Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1020-1029Google Scholar). Measurement of Ca2+transport in the presence of a synthetic peptide was performed as previously described (13Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26452-26459Google Scholar). The yeast two-hybrid system used in this study was described previously (13Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26452-26459Google Scholar, 18Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Google Scholar). The two CAX1 N-terminal fragments (residues 1–65 and 37–73) were amplified by PCR and cloned in-frame into the NcoI and BamHI sites of pAS2. CXIP1 was amplified by PCR and cloned in-frame into theNcoI and XhoI sites of pACT2. Protein expression in yeast was confirmed as previously described (13Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26452-26459Google Scholar). A pmc1vcx1cnb1 yeast strain (K667) lacking the vacuolar Ca2+ transporters Pmc1 and Vcx1 and calcineurin (Cnb1) is hypersensitive to high levels of Ca2+(17Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Google Scholar). CAX1-expressing K667 cells grow well in standard medium, but do not grow in medium containing high levels of Ca2+ (12Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1020-1029Google Scholar). Only expression of deregulated CAX1 (containing mutations or truncations of the N terminus) can suppress the yeast vacuolar Ca2+ transport defect (4Hirschi K.D. Zhen R.G. Cunningham K.W. Rea P.A. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8782-8786Google Scholar, 13Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26452-26459Google Scholar). Using a yeast expressionArabidopsis cDNA library (19Minet M. Dufour M.E. Lacroute F. Plant J. 1992; 2: 417-422Google Scholar), we have isolatedArabidopsis cDNAs that allow full-length CAX1-expressing K667 strains to grow in medium containing high levels of Ca2+. The cDNAs were isolated from the yeast and then retransformed into K667 strains with or without CAX1 to verify that they do not suppress the Ca2+ sensitivity of K667 by themselves and to confirm that the clones are indeed required for CAX1 to suppress the Ca2+ sensitivity of K667. We have used the term CXIP (CAX-interactingprotein) for the protein products of these cDNAs. Six different CXIP cDNA clones have been identified using this yeast activation approach (TableI). One of the cDNA clones,CXIP1, which is the focus of this study, encodes a novelArabidopsis protein with sequence homology at the C terminus to PICOT proteins (24Witte S. Villalba M. Bi K. Liu Y.-H. Isakov N. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1902-1909Google Scholar, 25Rahlfs S. Fischer M. Becker K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37133-37140Google Scholar, 26Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Bellı́ G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Google Scholar). We cloned an Arabidopsis homolog of CXIP1 that we have termed CXIP2, which encodes a protein of 293 amino acids (32 kDa). The yeast activation approach also identified CXIP3, which encodes an FKBP protein (A. thaliana FKBP15-2) (27Luan S. Kudla J. Gruissem W. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6964-6969Google Scholar). Four of the six cDNA clones identified in the yeast activation screen are identical and encode a protein whose function has not been previously characterized. We have termed this gene CXIP4.Table ISummary of CXIPsCXIP1CXIP2aA homolog of CXIP1 that was cloned from an Arabidopsis gene expression library using PCR amplification.CXIP3CXIP4GeneBank™/EBI accession no.AY157988AY157989U52047AY163162Location in Arabidopsis genomeChromosome 3Chromosome 2Chromosome 5Chromosome 2mRNA (bp)522882662999Amino acids173293163332Molecular mass (kDa)bDeduced using the protein analysis program ProtParam Tool (available at www.expasy.ch/cgi_bin/protparam).19.3321537.8BLAST search resultscDetermined using the BLAST program.A. thaliana PICOT proteinA. thaliana PICOT proteinA. thaliana FKBP15–2A. thalianaunknown proteinMotif or functionPICOT domainPICOT domainFK506- and rapamycin-sensitive rotamase activitya A homolog of CXIP1 that was cloned from an Arabidopsis gene expression library using PCR amplification.b Deduced using the protein analysis program ProtParam Tool (available at www.expasy.ch/cgi_bin/protparam).c Determined using the BLAST program. Open table in a new tab K667 yeast cells expressing CXIP1 or CAX1 alone were unable to grow on 200 mm CaCl2, whereas coexpression of CXIP1 with CAX1 significantly enhanced the growth of K667 (Fig.1 A). However, growth of the (CAX1 + CXIP1)-expressing strain was not as strong as growth of K667 cells expressing N-terminally truncated sCAX1. The ability to suppress the Ca2+ sensitivity of the yeast mutants inferred activation of autoinhibited CAX1; however, it was important to demonstrate directly through biochemical studies that the combination of full-length CAX1 and CXIP1 mediated H+/Ca2+antiport activity in yeast. Therefore, we measured ΔpH-dependent 10 μm45CaCl2 uptake into microsomal vesicles isolated from K667 yeast strains expressing both ArabidopsiscDNAs. H+/Ca2+ transport activity was observed in membrane vesicles from a (CAX1 + CXIP1)-expressing strain and an sCAX1-expressing strain (Fig. 1 B). However, no H+/Ca2+ antiport activity was detectable in vesicles from full-length CAX1-expressing or CXIP1-expressing yeast strains (Fig. 1 B and data not shown). The H+/Ca2+ antiport activity measured in CAX1 + CXIP1 vesicles was consistently ∼10% of the activity measured in sCAX1 vesicles. The CXIP1 cDNA consists of 522 base pairs (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AY157988). The amino acid sequence consists of 173 amino acids (with a predicted molecular mass of 19.3 kDa) and has extensive homology to PICOT proteins found in a broad taxonomic distribution, including mammals, yeast, and bacteria (28Isakov N. Witte S. Altman A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 537-539Google Scholar). In other organisms, these proteins appear to play a negative regulatory role in cellular stress responses (24Witte S. Villalba M. Bi K. Liu Y.-H. Isakov N. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1902-1909Google Scholar, 29Isakov N. Altman A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 761-794Google Scholar). The primary amino acid sequence of CXIP1 (Fig. 2) is 26% identical (38% similar) to the 171-amino acid GLP-1 PICOT protein from Plasmodium falciparum (PfGLP-1) and 33% identical (45% similar) to the 335-amino acid human PICOT (HsPICOT) protein. The PICOT proteins contain a modular unit of 84 amino acid located in the C terminus that is highly conserved (PICOT-HD) (Fig. 2). The human PICOT protein has two tandem PICOT-HD repeats, whereas both CXIP1, CXIP2, and P. falciparum GLP-1 have a single PICOT-HD in their C termini. Within the PICOT-HD, several stretches of amino acids appear to be highly conserved, for example, -CGFS- and -SNWPT- (amino acids 97–100 and 133–137, respectively) (Fig. 2). Among the various PICOT proteins, several include a single thioredoxin (Trx) HD in their N termini. The human PICOT protein is involved in the interaction with protein kinase C through this Trx-HD and negatively regulates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/AP-1 and NF-κB pathway (24Witte S. Villalba M. Bi K. Liu Y.-H. Isakov N. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1902-1909Google Scholar). CXIP2 is 30% identical (43% similar) to CXIP1 overall and is >54% identical (71% similar) to CXIP1 within the PICOT-HD. CXIP2 contains a Trx-HD in the N terminus like that of the human PICOT protein (Fig.2). Using the yeast Ca2+suppression assay, we were interested in determining whether CXIP1 and CXIP2 can activate various CAX transporters. Three close homologs of CAX1 (CAX2–4) also appear to be N-terminally regulated, and neither full-length CAX3 nor CAX4 is able to suppress the Ca2+sensitivity of K667 (10Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 1245-1254Google Scholar, 30Pittman J.K. Sreevidya C.S. Shigaki T. Ueoka-Nakanishi H. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1054-1062Google Scholar). Unlike CXIP1, CXIP2 could not activate CAX1 (Fig. 3 A). CXIP1 and CXIP2 could both weakly activate full-length CAX4 (Fig. 3 B); however, both CXIP1 and CXIP2 failed to activate CAX2 2The abbreviations used are: HD, homology domain; Trx, thioredoxin and CAX3 (data not shown). As an initial step toward deducing the mechanism of CAX1 activation by CXIP1, we tested the ability of CXIP1 to activate various chimeric CAX constructs. CAX3 could not suppress the K667 Ca2+-sensitive phenotype. In fact, an N-terminal truncation of CAX3 (sCAX3) (21Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43152-43159Google Scholar) was also unable to suppress the Ca2+ toxicity despite lacking its autoinhibitory domain (Fig. 4 A). Just as CXIP1 was unable to activate full-length CAX3, CXIP1 coexpressed with sCAX3 was unable to suppress the yeast Ca2+ sensitivity (Fig.4 A). Numerous sCAX3-CAX1 constructs + CXIP1 were unable to suppress the Ca2+ sensitivity of K667 yeast cells. For example, K667 strains in which CXIP1 was coexpressed with chimeric sCAX3-CAX1 constructs containing the central region or C terminus of CAX1 were unable to suppress the Ca2+-sensitive phenotype (Fig. 4, B and C). However, when a chimeric construct (called sCAX3-α1) was used that contained 37 amino acids of the N-terminal region of CAX1 (Met37–Leu73) fused to CAX3, CXIP1 could activate this chimeric construct (Fig. 4 C). We have previously shown that a 9-amino acid domain within CAX1, which we termed the “Ca2+ domain,” is required for Ca2+ transport (21Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43152-43159Google Scholar). Furthermore, when this 9-amino acid domain from CAX1 is swapped into an N-terminally truncated CAX3 construct (to give sCAX3-9), this “activated” CAX3 mutant can transport Ca2+ (21Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43152-43159Google Scholar). The activation of CAX3 (sCAX3-α1) in the presence of CXIP1 demonstrated in Fig. 4 C did not require the CAX1 9-amino acid Ca2+ domain. The chimera sCAX3-α1, when coexpressed with CXIP1 in K667 yeast strains, demonstrated ΔpH-dependent 10 μm45CaCl2 uptake into microsomal vesicles (Fig.4 D). This H+/Ca2+ antiport activity was comparable to that measured for sCAX1 (data not shown). The sCAX1-CAX3 chimera sCAX1-9 (21Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43152-43159Google Scholar), with the 9-amino acid Ca2+domain removed and replaced with the equivalent 9-amino acid region of CAX3, was not able to strongly suppress the Ca2+sensitivity of K667; however, expression of CXIP1 + sCAX1-9 strongly suppressed the Ca2+ toxicity (Fig. 4 C). To determine whether this activation of CAX1 by CXIP1 is caused by a physical interaction between CXIP1 and the CAX1 N terminus, a yeast two-hybrid experiment was performed. CXIP1 coexpressed with the N terminus of CAX1 (Met37–Leu73 or Met1–Asn65) caused the lacZ gene in the Y190 yeast strain to be activated, indicating that a direct interaction between CXIP1 and the CAX1 N terminus had occurred (Fig.5 A). No color reaction occurred in the absence of CXIP1 or in the absence of the CAX1 N-terminal fragments. We have previously demonstrated that a synthetic peptide corresponding to the first 36 amino acids of the CAX1 N terminus is able to inhibit H+/Ca2+ transport mediated by N-terminally truncated CAX1 (sCAX1), but does not inhibit Ca2+ transport by other truncated H+/Ca2+ antiporters (13Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26452-26459Google Scholar). The interaction of this N-terminal peptide with CAX1 was mapped to include residues 56–62 within CAX1 (13Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26452-26459Google Scholar). We were interested in coexpressing CXIP1 and sCAX1 to determine whether the presence of CXIP1 would alter the amount of synthetic peptide needed to inhibit N-terminally truncated CAX1. A peptide concentration of 5 ± 1.5 μm was sufficient to inhibit 50% of 10 μmCa2+ transport activity mediated by sCAX1 (Fig.5 B) (13Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26452-26459Google Scholar), whereas 12 ± 2 μm peptide was required to inhibit 50% of sCAX1 transport in the presence of CXIP1 (Fig. 5 B). To determine whether the CXIP1 PICOT-HD is required for activation of full-length CAX1, we mutated two highly conserved regions within the PICOT-HD (Fig. 2). The conserved CGFS domain (amino acids 97–100) was changed to AAAA, and the SNWPT domain (amino acids 133–137) was changed to AAAAA. Growth of CAX1-expressing K667 cells on 200 mm CaCl2 was virtually absent in the presence of either of the CXIP1 mutants (data not shown). Northern blot analysis was used to assess the expression of CXIP1 mRNA in variousArabidopsis tissues. Hybridization with the CXIP1probe revealed expression of CXIP1 in all tissues, with abundant expression in leaves and low level expression in roots and flowers, compared with almost equal expression of CAX1 in leaf, stem, and flower tissue and very low expression in roots (Fig.6). When seedlings were exposed to different metals, there were alterations in the expression ofCXIP1. CXIP1 levels were modestly increased when Ca2+ was added to the medium and decreased when Na+, Mn2+, and Ni2+ were added to the medium (Fig. 6). Using a yeast-based approach to activate full-length CAX1, we have identified an Arabidopsis cDNA termedCXIP1 gene, encoding a predicted protein containing a PICOT domain (Figs. 1 and 2). This domain is highly conserved throughout evolution, and comparative sequence analysis indicates that the PICOT-HD is distinct from all protein domains (28Isakov N. Witte S. Altman A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 537-539Google Scholar). The physiological function of the PICOT-HD has not been identified; and until this study, no plant gene with this motif has been functionally characterized. In this work, we have demonstrated that, in a yeast expression system, CXIP1 interacted with the N terminus of CAX1 to modify vacuolar H+/Ca2+ antiport activity. This study thus ascribes, for the first time, a function to a plant gene containing a PICOT-HD. Like all PICOT-HD-containing proteins, CXIP1 appears to be a soluble protein. Two other non-transmembranous proteins that activated CAX1 Ca2+ transport in yeast were also identified in this study (Table I). CXIP3 is identical to a previously characterized protein, A. thaliana FKBP15-2, a member of the FKBP-type immunophilin family (27Luan S. Kudla J. Gruissem W. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6964-6969Google Scholar), whereas CXIP4 is a novel protein of unknown function that appears to be unique to plants. We chose to confine this study to further analysis of CXIP1. Several proteins that contain a PICOT-HD also contain a Trx-HD, including Arabidopsis CXIP2, which weakly activated CAX4 Ca2+ transport (Fig. 3 B). Proteins containing the Trx-HD are important in a range of cellular process, including controlling the redox state of the cell (31Balmer Y. Buchanan B.B. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 191-193Google Scholar). In plant Ca2+ signaling, there have been some reports linking the plasma membrane redox state with release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (32Long J.C. Jenkins G.I. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 2077-2086Google Scholar); however, the mechanisms for transducing these signals have not been elucidated. The inability of CXIP2 to activate CAX1 suggests specificity in the CXIP1-CAX1 interaction. Three different experimental approaches suggest this specificity depends on the N terminus of CAX1. Two-hybrid analysis demonstrated an interaction between CXIP1 and the N terminus of CAX1 (Fig. 5 A). This interaction did not require the first 36 amino acids of CAX1, as a construct containing Met37–Leu73 interacted with CXIP1 in a manner indistinguishable from the CAX1 Met1–Asn65construct. The second approach utilized chimeric CAX3 constructs to demonstrate the importance of the N terminus of CAX1. Only the chimeric CAX3 construct containing Met37–Leu73 from CAX1, but lacking the first 36 amino acids of CAX1 (sCAX3-α1), was capable of being activated by CXIP1 (Fig. 4, C andD). The third approach utilized a competition experiment to suggest that CXIP1 binds to the N terminus of CAX1. Our previous studies have demonstrated that a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 1–36 of CAX1 specifically inhibits Ca2+transport mediated by sCAX1 lacking these 36 N-terminal amino acids (13Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26452-26459Google Scholar). Furthermore, we showed that these 36 amino acids physically interact with amino acids 56–62 at the N terminus of CAX1 to facilitate autoinhibition of CAX1 (13Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26452-26459Google Scholar). We hypothesized that if CXIP1 binds to this same region (amino acids 56–62) of CAX1, more peptide should be required to cause Ca2+ transport inhibition. Indeed, approximately double the peptide concentration was needed to inhibit 50% of sCAX1 transport activity in the presence of CXIP1 (Fig. 5 B). The requirement for the CXIP1 PICOT-HD in this interaction was inferred by the inability of mutant forms of CXIP1 to activate CAX1 (data not shown). However, at this time, we cannot rule out the possibility that these mutants perturb protein expression or stability. Computer analysis suggests that the PICOT-HD may form a globular topology, which includes three α-helices and intervening β-strands (26Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Bellı́ G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Google Scholar). It has been proposed that this structure can (i) form a transient intermolecular interaction; (ii) bind to substrates, regulators, or cofactors; or (iii) tether proteins to specific subcellular compartments. In the future, it will be interesting to further delineate the mechanism of CXIP1-mediated CAX1 regulation. We suggest that CXIP1 may activate CAX1 through a direct interaction that disrupts autoinhibition and thus alters the confirmation of autoinhibited CAX1 to allow Ca2+ transport. However, the Ca2+ transport mediated by CXIP1-activated CAX1 is much less than that of deregulated sCAX1 (Fig. 1). Evidence suggests that activation of CAX1 by N-terminal truncation (as with sCAX1) is artificial and does not occur in planta (11Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Barkla B.J. Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D. Plant Cell. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar), and we believe that the strong Ca2+ transport activity mediated by sCAX1 may not be realized by fully activated CAX1. For example, Ca2+ transport mediated by a version of full-length CAX1 activated by point mutations within the N terminus is less than that meditated by sCAX1.1 Similarly, Ca2+ transport mediated by the calmodulin-activated ArabidopsisCa2+-ATPase ACA2 is significantly less than that mediated by an N-terminally truncated version of ACA2 lacking its calmodulin-binding autoinhibitory domain (33Hwang I. Harper J.F. Liang F. Sze H. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 157-168Google Scholar). However, the level of H+/Ca2+ antiport activity measured for CXIP1-activated CAX1 is still much less than the activity measured inArabidopsis tissue. It is possible that additional protein interactions, such as with a multiple protein complex, are required to fully activate CAX1. Other proteins may be required to interact directly with CAX1 or cooperatively with CXIP1, or CXIP1 itself may require additional regulation. Interestingly, it appears that CXIP1 is able to strongly activate some chimeric CAX constructs. The level of Ca2+ transport measured in yeast vesicles expressing CXIP1-activated sCAX3-α1 was equivalent to the level of activity in vesicles expressing sCAX1 (Fig.4 D). Our previous findings show that the sCAX1-CAX3 chimera sCAX1-9 is unable to transport Ca2+ (21Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43152-43159Google Scholar). This construct contains an N-terminal truncation, but also contains the 9-amino acid region from CAX3 (residues 87–95) that replaced the equivalent 9-amino acid Ca2+ domain of CAX1 and was thought to abolish function due to the inability of this CAX3 domain to allow Ca2+ transport. However, we show here that sCAX1-9 could also be activated by coexpression of CXIP1 and that this activity was equivalent to that of sCAX1 (Fig. 4 C). Previously, we demonstrated that truncations or additions to the N terminus of CAX1 or CAX4 can activate these Ca2+transporters in yeast (10Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 1245-1254Google Scholar). Similarly, CAX3 can also be activated by the addition of amino acids to the N terminus (10Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 1245-1254Google Scholar). These findings imply that any protein binding to the N-terminal region could activate CAX1 transport in yeast by altering the autoinhibitory region or the conformation of the transporter. Thus, although CXIP1 clearly interacts with CAX1 at the N terminus in our various yeast assays, we cannot discriminate between gene products that activate or repress CAX1 transport in plants. The expression pattern of CXIP1RNA mirrors the expression pattern of CAX1in plants (Fig. 6). That is, they were both expressed in all tissues; both were modestly induced by exogenous Ca2+; and both were repressed by certain ions. Interestingly, aside from the low level expression of CXIP1in flowers, the gene appears to be expressed at higher levels thanCAX1. The expression patterns of CXIP3(A. thaliana FKBP15-2) and CXIP4were both also induced by Ca2+ and regulated by different ions (data not shown); however, the expression levels and tissue distribution of these genes differed from those of CXIP1, suggesting that thoseCXIP genes might play different roles in the regulation of CAX1 activity in planta. The use of yeast to reconstitute a plant response pathway has been achieved with genes involved in Na+ homeostasis (34Quintero F.J. Ohta M. Shi H. Zhu J.-K. Pardo J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9061-9066Google Scholar). However, these genes were first identified using standard genetic approaches (35Zhu J.-K. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2001; 4: 401-406Google Scholar). Here we have demonstrated that CXIP1, but not its homolog CXIP2, can regulate the Ca2+ transport activity of CAX1 in yeast. Furthermore, CXIP1 and CXIP2 may be involved in the regulation of another putative H+/Ca2+antiporter, CAX4. Indeed, we have previously proposed that each CAX transporter may be regulated by different pathways (30Pittman J.K. Sreevidya C.S. Shigaki T. Ueoka-Nakanishi H. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1054-1062Google Scholar). We speculate that multiple components (or CXIPs) are required for regulation of CAX1 and other plant CAX transporters and that each CXIP may differ in its interaction with CAX1. Future work using reverse genetics inArabidopsis will help clarify the contribution of CXIPs to CAX-mediated H+/Ca2+ transport. We thank Sherry LeClere and Jon Pittman for comments."
https://openalex.org/W1971170907,"We have cloned and functionally characterized two Na+-coupled dicarboxylate transporters, namely ceNaDC1 and ceNaDC2, from Caenorhabditis elegans. These two transporters show significant sequence homology with the product of theIndy gene identified in Drosophila melanogasterand with the Na+-coupled dicarboxylate transporters NaDC1 and NaDC3 identified in mammals.

These are NaDC1 and NaDC3. NaDC1 is Na+-coupled, electrogenic, and exhibits low affinity for its dicarboxylate substrates. The K t value (Michaelis-Menten constant) is in the range of 0.1–4.0 mm(1Pajor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5779-5785Google Scholar, 2Pajor A.M. Sun N. Am. J.

This isoform is expressed primarily in the brush border membrane of intestinal and renal epithelial cells. The physiological function of NaDC1 is to absorb the intermediates of the citric acid cycle, such as citrate, succinate, α-ketoglutarate, fumarate, and malate, in the intestine and kidney. NaDC3 is also a Na+-coupled and electrogenic dicarboxylate transporter, but it exhibits relatively higher affinity for its substrates compared with NaDC1 (5Kekuda R. Wang H. Huang W. Pajor A.M.

The K t value is in micromolar range. The NaDC3 is expressed primarily in the basolateral membrane of intestinal and renal epithelial cells. However, it is also found in tissues such as liver, placenta, and brain. NaDC3 in the kidney is involved in generating the driving force for the organic anion transporter OAT1 to facilitate the active entry of organic anions into the tubular cells across the basolateral membrane (8Russel F.G. Masereeuw R. van Aubel R.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 563-594Google Scholar). In the brain, NaDC3 mediates the cellular uptake of N-acetylaspartate, a process closely linked to myelination (9Huang W. Wang H. Kekuda R. Fei Y.J. Friedrich A. Wang J. Conway S.J. Cameron R.S. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 295: 392-403Google Scholar). Therefore, the physiological functions of the NaDCs may extend beyond the mediation of cellular entry of citric acid cycle intermediates. Recently, we reported on the molecular identification of the third member of this family in mammals (10Inoue K. Zhuang L. Maddox D.M. Smith S.B. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39469-39476Google Scholar, 11Inoue K. Zhuang L. Ganapathy V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 465-471Google Scholar). This transporter, known as Na+-coupled citrate transporter (NaCT), mediates the cellular uptake of citrate in a Na+-coupled manner. In a recent study by Rogina et al. (12Rogina B. Reenan R.A. Nilsen S.P. Helfand S.L. Science. 2000; 290: 2137-2140Google Scholar), a NaDC-like transporter, coded by the Indy (for I amnot dead yet) gene, has been implicated in the regulation of life span in Drosophila. The investigators of this study suggested that defects in one copy of theIndy gene (heterozygosity) can lead to less efficient production of cellular energy and that, as a consequence, the metabolic profile of the fruit fly changes resulting in life span extension. The eating behavior of the organism is not altered, however. The decreased generation of cellular energy due to the heterozygous mutation in theIndy gene creates a biological situation resembling that of caloric restriction, which in other animal models leads to an extension of life span (13Sohal R.S. Weindruch R. Science. 1996; 273: 59-63Google Scholar). Recently, we have identified (14Inoue K. Fei Y.J. Huang W. Zhuang L. Chen Z. Ganapathy V. Biochem. J. 2002; 317: 313-319Google Scholar) the transport function of Drosophila INDY. This transporter mediates the cellular uptake of a broad spectrum of citric acid cycle intermediates in a Na+-independent manner. These characteristics of drINDY have now been confirmed independently by Knauf et al.(15Knauf F. Rogina B. Jiang Z. Aronson P.S. Helfand S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14315-14319Google Scholar). Studies of life span extension are difficult, if not impossible, to conduct in mammals, particularly in humans. But it is relatively a simple task to monitor the mean and maximum life span in other animal models such as Caenorhabditis elegans. A number of features make C. elegans especially suitable for studies of life span extension. This organism has a short life span with a mean life span of ∼15 days. In addition, there are techniques available to silence genes in this organism as a means of assessing the role of specific genes in the maintenance of life span. Therefore, with an aim to investigate the potential role of NaDC family in life span, we set out to clone the C. elegans counterparts of mammalian NaDCs and subsequently to monitor the influence of these transporters on life span by using the RNAi technique to down-regulate their function. These studies have successfully led to the molecular and functional identification of two different Na+-coupled dicarboxylate transporters (ceNaDC1 and ceNaDC2) analogous to the mammalian NaDC1 and NaDC3. In addition, studies of the influence of these two transporters on life span have shown that disruption of the function of the high affinity transporter ceNaDC2, but not that of the low affinity transporter ceNaDC1, leads to a significant extension of the average life span in C. elegans. A wild type nematode strain, C. elegans N2 (Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.), was obtained from theCaenorhabditis Genetics Center (St. Paul, MN). Nematode culture was carried out using a standard procedure with a large scale liquid cultivation protocol (16Fei Y.J. Fujita T. Lapp D.F. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 565-572Google Scholar, 17Fei Y.J. Romero M.F. Krause M. Liu J.C. Huang W. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9563-9571Google Scholar, 18Lewis J.A. Fleming J.T.

The pellet was then used for total RNA preparation. Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Poly(A)+ mRNA was purified by affinity chromatography using oligo(dT)-cellulose. A pair of PCR primers specific for the putativeC. elegans nadc1 gene was designed based on the sequence of the cosmid F31F6.6 (GenBankTM accession number Z69884), 5′-GCC TCC AAG CAA AAT GTC TC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CTA ACG CAA ATC CAC CTC C-3′ (reverse primer). A second pair of PCR primers specific for putative C. elegans nadc2 gene was designed based on the sequence of the cosmid K08E5.2 (GenBankTMaccession number Z30974), 5′-TCA TCC TTC CAA CAC CAT CC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-ACC ATT CCA CTT CCA AAC AC-3′ (reverse primer). Poly(A)+ RNA (∼0.5 μg) isolated from mixed stageC. elegans was taken as template to perform RT-PCR using an RT-PCR kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. A single RT-PCR product was obtained with an estimated size of ∼1.0 and ∼0.9 kb for thecenadc1 and the cenadc2 genes, respectively, as predicted by the distance between the two primers in each pair. The RT-PCR products were gel-purified and subcloned into pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The molecular identity of the inserts was established by sequencing. These cDNA fragments were used as probes to screen a C. elegans cDNA library. The SuperScript Plasmid System from Invitrogen was used to establish the cDNA library using the poly(A)+ RNA from C. elegans. The transformation of the ligated cDNA into Escherichia coli was performed by electroporation using ElectroMAX DH10B competent cells. The bacteria plating, the filter lifting, the DNA fragment labeling, and the hybridization methods followed the routine procedure (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.31-9.50Google Scholar). The DNA sequencing of the full-length ceNaDC1 cDNA and ceNaDC2 cDNA clones was performed using an automated PerkinElmer Life Sciences Applied Biosystems 377 Prism DNA sequencer and the Taq DyeDeoxy terminator cycle sequencing protocol. Functional expression of the ceNaDC cDNAs in mammalian cells was done in human retinal pigment epithelial (HRPE) cells using the vaccinia virus expression system as described previously (5Kekuda R.

The virus was allowed to adsorb for 30 min at 37 °C with gentle shaking of the plate. Cells were then transfected with the plasmid DNA (empty vector pSPORT or ceNaDC1 cDNA or ceNaDC2 cDNA constructs) using the lipofection procedure (Invitrogen). The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 12 h and then used for determination of transport activity. Cells transfected with pSPORT alone without the cDNA insert were used as the control to determine endogenous transport activity in these cells. [3H]Succinate uptake was determined at 37 °C as described previously (5Kekuda R. Wang H. Huang W. Pajor A.M. Leibach F.H. Devoe L.D. Prasad P.D. Ganapathy V. J. Biol.

In most experiments, the uptake medium was 25 mm Hepes/Tris (pH 7.5), containing 140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, and 5 mm glucose. In experiments in which the cation and anion dependence of the transport process was investigated, NaCl was replaced iso-osmotically by LiCl, KCl, sodium gluconate, orN-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG) chloride. The transport activity in cDNA-transfected cells was adjusted for the endogenous activity to calculate the ceNaDC cDNA-specific activity. The endogenous succinate transport activity in vector-transfected cells was always less than 10% compared with the succinate transport activity measured in cells transfected with either ceNaDC1 cDNA or ceNaDC2 cDNA. Experiments were done in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least three times. Results are presented as means ± S.E. An RT-PCR assay with thecenadc1- or cenadc2-specific primers described above was used to study the developmental stage-specific expression pattern of ceNaDC1 mRNA and ceNaDC2 mRNA. A Quantum RNA 18 S internal standard (Ambion, Austin, TX) was used for the semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Total RNA (∼1.0 μg) isolated from different developmental stages of C. elegans (embryo, early larva, late larva, and adult) was taken as template to perform reverse transcription using an RT-PCR kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The reverse transcription was initiated with random hexamers and carried out in a DNA thermal cycler (GeneAmp PCR System 9600) and thin-walled reaction tubes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 42 °C for 60 min, followed by incubation at 99 °C for 5 min to inactivate the reverse transcriptase (Maloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase). Reverse transcription was followed by PCR in a multiplex format, in which the gene-specific primers and the primers for the internal control (18 S rRNA) with their competimers were combined at a predefined ratio. The PCR cycle number was titrated according to the manufacturer's protocol to ensure that the reaction was within the linear range. A competimer was included to prevent the highly abundant rRNA from being overwhelmingly amplified during the reaction, and an optimal 18 S primer:competimer ratio was also pre-established by trial and error. The resultant multiplex PCR products were resolved in an 1.0% agarose gel, and the intensity of the gene-specific and the 18 S rRNA-specific bands was determined using SpectraImager 5000 Imaging system and AlphaEase 32-bit software (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). The steady state levels of ceNaDC1 mRNA and ceNaDC2 mRNA at different developmental stages were assessed from the relative ratios of the intensity of the ceNaDC1-specific RT-PCR product or ceNaDC2-specific RT-PCR product to the intensity of the 18 S rRNA-specific RT-PCR product at each of these stages. To study the tissue-specific expression pattern of thenadc1 and nadc2 genes in C. elegans, transcriptional cenadc1::gfp and cenadc2::gfp fusion genes were constructed, and transgenic animals expressing these transgenes were developed. The expression pattern of the cenadc1 and cenadc2genes was investigated in live transgenic animals based on the expression pattern of the GFP reporter. A pair of primers for construction of a transcriptionalcenadc1::gfp fusion gene was designed to amplify the cenadc1 promoter. The forward primer, 5′-CGC GTC GAC GCT TAC ATC ATT CTT GTA TTT TTC-3′, corresponds to the nucleotide positions 28,630–28,659 of the cosmid F31F6 (GenBankTM accession number Z69884). The primer contains an incorporated SalI restriction site at its 5′ end. The reverse primer, 5′-ATA GGA TCC ATG ATT GGA GGC TCT GCA ATA CTA-3′, corresponds to the nucleotide positions 29,797–29,772 in the same cosmid. A BamHI site was incorporated in this primer at the 5′ end. The SalI and BamHI sites were introduced into these primers for subsequent cloning into a GFP expression vector. An ∼1.2-kb DNA fragment of the cenadc1 promoter was amplified using the cosmid F31F6 DNA as template. Similarly, a pair of primers for construction of a transcriptionalcenadc2::gfp fusion gene was also designed. The forward primer, 5′-GTC GAC AAA ATA TGT ATT AGC CAC ATA AAA CCC-3′, corresponds to the nucleotide positions 13,966–13,998 of the cosmid K08E5 (GenBankTM accession number Z30974). The reverse primer, 5′-GGA TCC ATT TTC CGC ACA TGC CGA ATT TGC AT-3′, corresponds to the nucleotide positions 15,461–15,432 in the same cosmid. A SalI site and a BamHI site were incorporated in these primers for subsequent subcloning purposes. A ∼1.5-kb DNA fragment of the cenadc2 promoter was amplified using the cosmid K08E5 as template. The PCR products were digested withSalI and BamHI and inserted into a GFP expression vector pPD117.01 (a generous gift from Dr. A. Fire, Carnegie Institution, Baltimore, MD) at a SalI/BamHI site. In these minigene constructs, a built-in mec7 promoter (∼0.9 kb) in the expression vector was replaced by thecenadc1 and cenadc2 promoter fragments in such a way that the GFP transcription is under control of the putative promoters of the cenadc1 and cenadc2 genes, respectively. The minigene fusion constructs were verified by sequence analysis. Transgenic lines were established using a standard germ line transformation protocol (17Fei Y.J. Romero M.F. Krause M. Liu J.C. Huang W. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9563-9571Google Scholar, 18Lewis J.A. Fleming J.T. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 3-29Google Scholar). Syncytial gonad injection was carried out according to a standard procedure (18Lewis J.A. Fleming J.T. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 3-29Google Scholar). For microinjection, a computerized injection system, Transjector 5246 and Micromanipulator 5171 from Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany), and a Nikon Eclipse TE 300 inverted microscope with Nomarski differential interference contrast optics were used. A cloned mutant collagen gene containing the rol-6 (plasmid pRF4, kindly provided by Dr. M. Koelle, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT) was used as a dominant genetic marker for DNA transformation. Coinjection of this dominant marker with the GFP fusion constructs allowed progeny selection of the transformed animals by their “roller” phenotype. The F1 rollers were picked up according to their characteristic rolling behavior and cultured individually to establish transformed lines. F2 rollers with extrachromosome arrays were selected for fluorescence microscopy to determine the GFP expression pattern. Stable transgenic lines were established by the γ-irradiation method from the F2 rollers, and the background was cleaned up by several times of outcross (17Fei Y.J. Romero M.F. Krause M. Liu J.C. Huang W. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9563-9571Google Scholar, 21Anderson P. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 31-58Google Scholar). Two modified versions of the Aequora victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP), designated as CFP and YFP with cyan-shifted and yellow-shifted spectra (22Miller III, D.M. Desai N.S. Hardin D.C. Piston D.W. Patterson G.H. Fleenor J. Xu S. Fire A. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 914-921Google Scholar), respectively, were used to simultaneously follow the expression patterns of ceNaDC1 and ceNaDC2 in C. elegans. For the construction of the cenadc1promoter-driven CFP and the cenadc2 promoter-driven YFP expression vectors, the GFP coding region in the GFP-expression vectorcenadc1::gfp (pPD117) andcenadc2::gfp (pPD117) was substituted by the CFP and YFP coding regions, respectively. The CFP and YFP coding regions (∼950 bp) were obtained by anEcoRI/KpnI digestion of the vectors L4666 (pPD133.58) and L4664 (pPD133.51), respectively (kindly provided by Dr. A. Fire, Carnegie Institution, Baltimore, MD). Thecenadc1::cfp andcenadc2::yfp expression vectors were linearized by SalI digestion and coinjected into the distal arms of the C. elegans syncytial gonads as described earlier. The extrachromosome arrays were used for fluorescence microscopy to compare the expression pattern of CFP and YFP in the same transgenic animal. Epi-fluorescence microscopic analysis of the expression of CFP and YFP was performed using an Axiophot microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Excitation and emission filter settings are as follows: for CFP examination, excitation at 436 ± 20 nm, dichroic 455 nm LP, and emission at 480 ± 40 nm; for YFP examination, excitation at 500 ± 20 nm, dichroic 515 nm LP, and emission at 535 ± 30 nm LP (22Miller III, D.M. Desai N.S. Hardin D.C. Piston D.W. Patterson G.H. Fleenor J. Xu S. Fire A. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 914-921Google Scholar). The filter sets were purchased from Chroma Technology (Brattleboro, VT). The SPOT-cooled CCD color digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc., St. Sterling Heights, MI) and its associated data acquisition software were used to record the fluorescence images. A fragment of the coding region of ceNaDC1 cDNA was generated by PCR and subcloned into a pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The DNA fragment was released by EcoRI digestion and inserted into a “double T7” plasmid (pPD129.36, a generous gift from Dr. A. Fire, Carnegie Institution, Baltimore, MD) at an EcoRI site within the multiple cloning site. A host strain DH5α was used for the first transformation. Competent host bacteria HT115 (DE3) (kindly provided by the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center, St. Paul, MN)) expressing T7-RNA polymerase from an inducible promoter was prepared using a standard CaCl2 method (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.31-9.50Google Scholar). The double T7 promoter-containing plasmid with the cenadc1 gene-specific DNA fragment inserted between the two T7 promoter regions was transformed into the competent HT115 (DE3) cells and plated onto standard LB + tetracycline (12.5 μg/ml) + ampicillin (100 μg/ml) plates. HT115 cells harboring the double-T7 plasmid were cultured and induced to express dsRNA using 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C for 4 h. The experimental worms were transferred onto isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside-containing nematode growth medium plates with the induced bacteria HT115 lawn for bacteria feeding experiments. The empty vector pPD129 was processed similarly for use as a negative control, and the bacteria harboring this plasmid were used to feed the control worms. Sufficient quantities of bacteria HT115 were seeded on the testing plates for the worms to consume to prevent the worms from starving and to ensure that dsRNA was always present in the testing plates during the entire experimental period for the experimental worms. A similar experimental strategy was used for ceNaDC2. To serve as a positive control for the bacteria-mediated RNAi in the assessment of the influence of ceNaDC1 and ceNaDC2 on life span, we monitored the influence of DAF-2 on life span using an identical experimental approach. Homozygous daf-2−/−knockout in C. elegans is known to enhance the life span dramatically (∼2-fold) (23Kenyon C. Chang J. Gensch E. Rudner A. Tabtiang R. Nature. 1993; 366: 461-464Google Scholar, 24Wolkow C.A. Kimura K.D. Lee M.S. Ruvkun G. Science. 2000; 290: 147-150Google Scholar). Therefore, if the knockdown of DAF-2 function by bacteria-mediated RNAi in C. elegans doubles the life span, this can be taken as a positive control for the validity of the experimental approach to assess the role of ceNaDC1 and ceNaDC2 in life span. For this purpose, we obtained an ∼0.8-kb DNA fragment specific for C. elegans DAF-2 by RT-PCR using the following primer pairs: 5′-CGAACAAAACACATCACAGAC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-TCCATCATTTCCATCACAACC-3′ (reverse primer) using the nematode total RNA as the template. This fragment was then subcloned into pGEM-T easy vector. The fragment was then released from the vector byEcoRI digestion, and the released insert was cloned into the double T7 plasmid pPD129.36 at the EcoRI site at the multiple cloning region. Shuttling of this plasmid into HT115 (DE3) bacteria, induction of double-stranded RNA, and feeding of the worms with the bacteria were carried out as described earlier. Life span of age-synchronous nematodes was determined at 20 °C. Eggs obtained from gravid hermaphrodites using an alkaline hypochlorite treatment procedure (18Lewis J.A. Fleming J.T. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 3-29Google Scholar) were dispensed on nematode growth medium Petri dishes with bacteria lawn and allowed to hatch. Worms were inspected every day until death and were scored as dead when they were no longer able to move even in response to prodding with a platinum-wire pick. Each day, dead worms were removed from plates and the deaths were recorded. Experiments were started with 60 worms for each RNAi treatment (10 per plate). The worms were transferred to a new plate every day during the reproductive period and every 3 days afterward to avoid contamination by their offspring. Worms that died from matricidal hatching (the bag-of-worms phenotype) and the worms that crawled off the plates or burrowed into the agar were replaced by spare worms. A backup reservoir plate of ∼30 spare worms was started at the same time as the experimental worms and was identically treated for this purpose. To avoid the influence of any potential subjective judgment of the experimenter in identifying the dead worms on the experimental outcome, the life span measurement studies were repeated with the experimenter blinded with regard to the identity of the individual experimental groups. Statistical analysis was performed using the Microsoft EXCEL 2000 analysis ToolPak. Mean life spans from different groups were compared using the Student's t test assuming unequal population variances. The cloned ceNaDC1 cDNA is 1,989 bp long and contains a poly(A) tail (GenBankTM accession number AY090484). The 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of this cDNA are 12 and 173 bp long, respectively. The ceNaDC1 protein, deduced from the coding region of the cDNA, contains 582 amino acids (Fig.1) with a predicted molecular mass of 64 kDa and an isoelectric point of 6.64. The ceNaDC2 cDNA is 2,250 bp long and contains a poly(A) tail (GenBankTM accession number AY090485). The 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of this cDNA are 50 and 500 bp long, respectively. The ceNaDC2 protein, deduced from the coding region of the cDNA, contains 566 amino acids (Fig. 1) with a predicted molecular mass of 62 kDa and an isoelectric point of 7.69. According to the Kyte-Doolittle plot with a 21-amino acid window size, ceNaDC1 as well as ceNaDC2 possess 12 putative transmembrane domains. Following a multiple"

https://openalex.org/W2139778577,"Glucose exerts powerful effects on hepatocyte gene transcription by mechanisms that are incompletely understood. c-Myc regulates hepatic glucose metabolism by increasing glycolytic enzyme gene transcription while concomitantly decreasing gluconeogenic and ketogenic enzyme gene expression. However, the molecular mechanisms by which c-Myc exerts these effects is not known. In this study, the glucose-mediated induction of L-type pyruvate kinase and glucose-6-phosphatase mRNA levels was diminished by maneuvers involving recombinant adenoviral vectors that interfere with (i) c-Myc protein levels by antisense expression or (ii) c-Myc function through a dominant-negative Max protein. These results were obtained using both HL1C rat hepatoma cells and primary rat hepatocytes. Furthermore, a decrease in c-Myc abundance reduced glucose production in HL1C cells, presumably by decreasing glucose-6-phosphatase activity. The repression of hormone-activated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene transcription by glucose was not affected by a reduction in c-Myc levels. The basal mRNA levels for L-pyruvate kinase and glucose-6-phosphatase were not altered to any significant degree by adenoviral treatment. Furthermore, adenoviral overexpression of the c-Myc protein induced glucose-6-phosphatase mRNA in the absence of glucose stimulation. We conclude that multiple mechanisms exist to communicate the glucose-derived signal and that c-Myc has a key role in the hepatic glucose signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2123681843,"The Alzheimer-linked neural protein S100B is a signaling molecule shown to control the assembly of intermediate filament proteins in a calcium-sensitive manner. Upon binding calcium, a conformational change occurs in S100B exposing a hydrophobic surface for target protein interactions. The synthetic peptide TRTK-12 (TRTKIDWNKILS), derived from random bacteriophage library screening, bears sequence similarity to several intermediate filament proteins and has the highest calcium-dependent affinity of any target molecule for S100B to date (K d <1 μm). In this work, the three-dimensional structure of the Ca2+-S100B-TRTK-12 complex has been determined by NMR spectroscopy. The structure reveals an extended, contiguous hydrophobic surface is formed on Ca2+-S100B for target interaction. The TRTK-12 peptide adopts a coiled structure that fits into a portion of this surface, anchored at Trp7, and interacts with multiple hydrophobic contacts in helices III and IV of Ca2+-S100B. This interaction is strikingly different from the α-helical structures found for other S100 target peptides. By using the TRTK-12 interaction as a guide, in combination with other available S100 target structures, a recognition site on helix I is identified that may act in concert with the TRTK-12-binding site from helices III and IV. This would provide a larger, more complex site to interact with full-length target proteins and would account for the promiscuity observed for S100B target protein interactions. The Alzheimer-linked neural protein S100B is a signaling molecule shown to control the assembly of intermediate filament proteins in a calcium-sensitive manner.

This would provide a larger, more complex site to interact with full-length target proteins and would account for the promiscuity observed for S100B target protein interactions. The S100 proteins are low molecular weight (10–12 kDa) members of the EF-hand family of calcium-binding proteins. Many of these proteins, including several of the S100s, the muscle contractile protein troponin C, and the ubiquitous protein calmodulin act as signaling molecules by converting an influx of cellular calcium into a biological response. Calcium binding to these EF-hand proteins triggers a conformational change and allows the protein to interact with an appropriate target molecule. The S100 proteins are unique among this family because, unlike troponin C or calmodulin, they exist in solution as homo- or heterodimers. Each S100 monomer contains two helix-loop-helix calcium-binding motifs as follows: a basic N-terminal pseudo EF-hand comprising 14 residues (site I), and a canonical and acidic C-terminal EF-hand of 12 residues (site II). A central linker region joining the two EF-hands along with the extreme N and C termini of these proteins exhibit the most sequence divergence among family members and are therefore believed to provide specificity for target protein interactions. This feature, along with the dimeric state of the S100 proteins, likely indicates these calcium-signaling proteins have the distinctive ability to interact with more than one target molecule at a time. S100B, 1The abbreviations used are: S100B, dimeric S100β; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; TRTK-12, acetyl-TRTKIDWNKILS-NH2; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid a homodimer of 91-residue S100β monomers, is found primarily in glial cells and has been implicated in neurological diseases including Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome (1Marshak D.R.

More than 20 calcium-sensitive in vitro binding partners have been identified for S100B (4Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Google Scholar) including several cellular architecture proteins such as tubulin (5Donato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 106-110Google Scholar) and GFAP (6Bianchi R. Garbuglia M. Verzini M. Giambanco I. Ivanenkov V.V. Dimlich R.V.W. Jamieson Jr., G.A. Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1313: 258-267Google Scholar), where S100B can inhibit polymerization of these oligomeric molecules. Furthermore, S100B inhibits the phosphorylation of multiple kinase substrates including the Alzheimer protein tau (7Baudier J. Mochly-Rosen D. Newton A. Lee S.-H. Koshland D.E. Cole R.D. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2886-2893Google Scholar,8Baudier J. Cole R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5876-5883Google Scholar) and neuromodulin (GAP-43) (9Lin L.-H. Van Eldik L.J. Osheroff N. Norden J.J. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 25: 297-304Google Scholar) through a calcium-sensitive interaction with the protein substrates. Consistent with the calcium-induced conformational change mechanism, a comparison of three-dimensional structures of apo- and calcium-bound S100B reveals that binding of calcium leads to the exposure of a hydrophobic surface(s) for protein-protein interactions (10Smith S.P. Shaw G.S. Structure. 1998; 6: 211-222Google Scholar). The 12-residue peptide TRTK-12, derived from random bacteriophage library experiments, has been used in previous studies as a model for S100B-target protein interactions. Experiments utilizing this peptide have indicated that peptides containing the consensus sequence (R/K)(L/I)(XWXXIL) bind specifically to S100B in a calcium-sensitive manner (11Ivanenkov V.V. Jamieson Jr., G.A. Gruenstein E. Dimlich R.V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14651-14658Google Scholar). Furthermore, this consensus sequence is conservatively found in the cytoskeletal proteins tubulin, desmin, vimentin, and GFAP, shown previously to interact with Ca2+-S100B (12McClintock K.A. Shaw G.S. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2043-2046Google Scholar). The TRTK-12 peptide competes with S100B target proteins including CapZ-α and GFAP for Ca2+-S100B binding (6Bianchi R. Garbuglia M. Verzini M.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14651-14658Google Scholar) and has the highest affinity (K d∼260 nm) (13McClintock K.A. Van Eldik L.J. Shaw G.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5421-5428Google Scholar) of any known S100B target. Fluorescence studies (13McClintock K.A. Van Eldik L.J. Shaw G.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5421-5428Google Scholar) have shown that Trp7 of TRTK-12 is a key residue for the calcium-sensitive interaction with S100B becoming buried at the protein-peptide interface. In addition, deletion of residues 85–91 from S100B leads to a >2000-fold decrease in affinity for TRTK-12 indicating the C-terminal helix is an important site of interaction. To date, only three structures are available for S100-target peptide complexes. In each case the target peptide adopts a 2.5 turn α-helical structure that interacts via two distinct modes with the S100 protein. The structures of human S100A10 and S100A11 in complex with peptides from the binding regions of annexin II and I, respectively, are nearly identical (14Rety S. Sopkova J. Renouard M. Osterloh D. Gerke V. Tabaries S. Russo- Marie F. Lewit-Bentley A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 89-95Google Scholar, 15Rety S. Osterloh D. Arie J.-P. Tabaries S. Seeman J. Russo-Marie F. Gerke V. Lewit-Bentley A. Structure. 2000; 8: 175-184Google Scholar) with the annexin peptides bridging the two S100 monomers through contacts in the linker region and C terminus of one monomer and the N terminus of the other monomer. Surprisingly, this similarity of interaction occurs despite little sequence similarity between the annexin peptides. In contrast, the interaction of rat S100B with a 23-residue peptide from the tumor suppressor protein p53 shows each S100β monomer binds to a single peptide through interactions with helix III and a portion of helix IV (16Rustandi R.R. Baldisseri D.M. Weber D.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 570-574Google Scholar). This orients the α-helical p53 peptide about 90° from that found for the annexin peptides with respect to their S100 partners. These structural variations of the S100A10, S100A11, and S100B complexes indicate that recognition differences in the protein and the target must exist for S100 proteins. In an effort to clarify these interactions, we present the three-dimensional solution structure of Ca2+-S100B in complex with the TRTK-12 peptide. The amino acid sequence of TRTK-12 does not correspond to a natural sequence for any known S100B target. However, its unusually high affinity for S100B may indicate that it contains structural determinants that remain to be uncovered for recognition of an S100 binding partner. The binding interaction of TRTK-12 is unexpected with the peptide adopting an extended and reversed orientation compared with the p53 interaction. Furthermore, there is no interaction with helix I of S100B as found in the S100A11/S100A10 annexin structures thus providing a novel third mode of recognition for an S100-target protein complex. Human S100B protein was expressed inEscherichia coli (strain N99) and purified as described previously (17Smith S.P. Barber K.R. Dunn S.D. Shaw G.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8805-8814Google Scholar). Uniformly 15N-labeled or15N/13C-labeled S100B was prepared using M9 minimal media containing 1 g/liter 99% 15NH4Cl or 1 g/liter 99% 15NH4Cl and 2 g/liter [13C]glucose. Uniformly2H/15N-labeled S100B was prepared in M9 minimal media containing 1 g/liter 99% 15NH4Cl and 99% D2O. Unlabeled TRTK-12 peptide (Ac-TRTKIDWNKILS-NH2) and [13C]isoleucine/[13C]acetyl-labeled peptide (*Ac-TRTK*IDWNK*ILS-NH2) were synthesized by the Queen's Peptide Synthesis Lab (Queen's University, Kingston, Canada). Purity was confirmed using reversed phase-high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Typically, NMR samples contained 1 mm S100β monomer, 1.2 mm TRTK-12 peptide, 35 mm KCl, 4 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm dithiothreitol in 90% H2O, 10% D2O (v/v), pH 7.05. For a single sample, a mixed13C/12C S100B dimer was prepared by incubating 20 mg each of 13C-labeled S100B and unlabeled S100B (total S100B concentration) in D2O at 37 °C for 150 h. Evolution of the mixed dimer over time was monitored by mass spectrometry. The final concentration of13C/12C S100B dimer in the NMR sample was ∼1.5 mm, and the sample was prepared in 100% D2O. Experimental conditions were otherwise identical to those reported above. NMR experiments were performed at 35 °C on Varian 500-, 600-, and 800-MHz spectrometers with pulsed field gradient probes. Backbone resonances for Ca2+-S100B in the complex were sequentially assigned using HNCACB (18Wittekind M. Mueller L. J. Magn. Reson. Ser.

Some aromatic ring protons were assigned using (HB)CB(CGCD)HD and (HB)CB(CGCDCE)HE experiments (23Yamazaki T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 11054-11055Google Scholar).

Spectra were processed and analyzed on a Silicon Graphics work station using NMRPipe, NMRDraw (24Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 263: 277-293Google Scholar), and Pipp and Stapp (25Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Google Scholar) programs. Approximate interproton distances in S100B were determined using 15N-filtered NOESY (26Zhang O. Kay L.E. Olivier J.P. Foreman-Kay J.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 845-858Google Scholar)(τmix = 150 ms) and simultaneous13C/15N-separated three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC (27Pascal S.M. Muhandiram D.R. Yamazaki T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Mag. Reson. Ser. B. 1994; 103: 197-201Google Scholar)(τmix = 100 ms) experiments. NOEs derived from the15N-filtered NOESY were calibrated based on knownd HNα and sequentiald αHN distances. The13C/15N-separated three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC was calibrated to geminal protons or protons on adjacent carbon atoms. In cases where direct calibration was not possible, the maximum distance of 6.0 Å was used. φ and ψ angles for Ca2+-S100B and the bound TRTK-12 peptide were incorporated where greater than 9 of 10 predictions fell within the same region of the Ramachandran plot based on the TALOS program (28Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Google Scholar). Minimum standard deviations of ±20° and ±30° were used for φ and ψ, respectively. φ angle restraints were confirmed with3 J NH-Hα coupling constants derived from an HNHA experiment (29Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Google Scholar). Hydrogen bond distance restraints of r NH-O = 1.4–2.7 Å andr N-O = 2.4–3.7 Å were implemented based on the identification of helical regions in initial structures. NOEs between the two S100β monomers were unambiguously assigned using a mixed13C/12C S100B dimer and a 13C F1-edited F3-filtered NOESY-HMQC experiment (30Lee W. Revington M. Arrowsmith C. Kay L.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 87-90Google Scholar) which detects only NOEs between a proton attached to13C and a proton attached to12C. These NOEs were calibrated in the same fashion as cross-peaks from the13C/15N-separated three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC. Secondary structure of the TRTK-12 peptide was determined using a two-dimensional wetNOESY experiment and 15N,2H S100B protein. Dihedral restraints for the peptide were included using the same stipulations as for Ca2+-S100B. Intermolecular NOEs between S100B and TRTK-12 were unambiguously identified using the same 13C F1-edited F3-filtered NOESY-HMQC experiment (30Lee W. Revington M. Arrowsmith C. Kay L.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 87-90Google Scholar) described above with13C/15N-labeled S100B protein and unlabeled TRTK-12 as well as a simultaneously13C/15N-separated three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC using 15N-labeled S100B and specifically labeled TRTK-12. Initial structures were calculated using the hybrid distance geometry and simulated annealing protocol in the Crystallography and NMR System program, version 1.1. The two monomeric subunits of S100B were constrained to be identical using the non-crystallographic symmetry definition and a force constant of 10 kcal/mol. The same constraint was applied for the two molecules of TRTK-12. Experiments were performed at 25 °C on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter. For the TRTK-12, Ca2+-S100B, and Ca2+-S100B-TRTK-12 samples, spectra from three scans (200–250 nm) in a 1-mm path length cuvette were averaged, and the buffer background was subtracted. Protein samples were prepared in 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm CaCl2 to final protein concentrations of 100 μm for S100β and 100 μm for TRTK-12 and 100 μm S100β; 100 μm TRTK-12 for the complex. Binding of the TRTK-12 peptide has been monitored previously by NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy and found to have aK d = 260 nm (13McClintock K.A. Van Eldik L.J. Shaw G.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5421-5428Google Scholar). In this work, formation of the complex was measured using a 15N-labeled S100B sample and monitoring the change in resonances as a function of added TRTK-12 peptide. Complex formation was complete at a ratio of 2:1 TRTK-12:S100B indicating that two TRTK-12 peptides bind to each S100B dimer protein. The resulting 1The abbreviations used are: S100B, dimeric S100β; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; TRTK-12, acetyl-TRTKIDWNKILS-NH2; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidH-15N HSQC spectrum of this complex showed a single set of resonances in the NMR spectra for most residues (Fig. 1) indicating the arrangement of the Ca2+-S100B-TRTK-12 complex dimer is symmetric.

A comparison of this spectrum with that for Ca2+-S100B alone indicated that several residues including Ile47, Val53, Ala78, Ala83, and Cys84 had shifted upon TRTK-12 binding. To identify the specific interactions between TRTK-12 and human Ca2+-S100B, the solution structure of the complex (24 kDa) was determined using 2072 experimental distance restraints in combination with 536 dihedral and 136 hydrogen bond restraints. This generated a family of 17 well defined structures (Fig. 2) based on the superposition of the 8 helices in the dimer (root mean square deviation 0.63 ± 0.07) (Table I). The TRTK-12 peptide was well defined between residues 4 and 12 forming a coil structure that folds back on itself. As observed in the rat S100B-p53 structure (16Rustandi R.R. Baldisseri D.M. Weber D.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 570-574Google Scholar), each S100B monomer binds one TRTK-12 molecule.Table INMR restraints and structure statisticsNo. experimental restraints (Å)aNumber of restraints listed is for the entire complex except for the dimer interface and the S100B-TRTK-12 interface.⋄NOETotal2072Intraresidue788Sequential440Medium range406Long range202Intermolecular (dimer interface)32Intermolecular (S100B-TRTK-12 interface)56Dihedral268H-bond136Rmsd from experimental distance restraintsbAll root mean square deviation (Rmsd) values are the average ± S.D. for the best 17 low energy structures.0.017 ± 0.0114Rmsd from experimental dihedral restraintsbAll root mean square deviation (Rmsd) values are the average ± S.D. for the best 17 low energy structures.0.502 ± 0.1036Rmsd from idealized covalent geometryBonds (Å)0.002 ± 0.0002Angles (°)0.435 ± 0.0191Impropers (°)0.282 ± 0.0221Residues in favored regionscPROCHECK (37) was used to obtain the Ramachandran plot. 72% of residues were in most allowed regions, 25.8% in other allowed regions, and 2.2% in disallowed regions.93.2%Lennard-Jones potential energy (kcal mol−1)dLennard-Jones van der Waals energy was calculated using the CHARMM empirical energy function and was not included in any stage of structure calculations.−496.36 ± 50.95Rmsds to the mean structure (Å)eCalculation included Cα, N, and C′ atoms in helices I–IV in S100B and residues 4–12 of TRTK-12.All structured backbone0.71 ± 0.08All structured heavy atoms1.13 ± 0.10a Number of restraints listed is for the entire complex except for the dimer interface and the S100B-TRTK-12 interface.b All root mean square deviation (Rmsd) values are the average ± S.D. for the best 17 low energy structures.c PROCHECK (37Laskowski R.A.

Open table in a new tab Overall, the structure of human Ca2+-S100B in the TRTK-12 complex retains many structural features of the calcium-bound form alone (32Smith S.P. Shaw G.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 77-88Google Scholar). The dimer interface is characterized by antiparallel interactions between helices I and I′ (interhelical angle (Ω) = 164 ± 4°) and helices IV and IV′ (Ω = 172 ± 4°) forming an X-type four helix bundle (Fig. 2). Each S100β monomer consists of an N-terminal pseudo EF-hand motif (site I) comprising helix I (Leu3–Tyr17), calcium binding loop I (Ser18–Glu31), and helix II (Ser30–Glu39) and a C-terminal canonical EF-hand (site II) comprising helix III (Gln50–Leu60), calcium binding loop II (Asp61–Glu72), and helix IV (Phe70–Cys84). Calcium binding loops I and II are associated through a short antiparallel β-sheet (Lys26–Lys28 and Glu67–Asp69). The arrangement of helices I and II in site I (Ω = 129 ± 3°) is similar to that of Ca2+-S100B (Ω = 138 ± 4°) and calbindin D9k (Ω = 130 ± 2°), indicating that TRTK-12 binding to Ca2+-S100B results in little conformational change to this region. In contrast, significant changes are identified in site II. The helix III–IV interhelical angle (Ω = 104 ± 4°) is dramatically opened by more than 90° than found in apo-S100B (Ω = −166 ± 1°). Furthermore, the arrangement of helices III–IV shows distinct differences from human Ca2+-S100B (Ω = 148 ± 4°) being more similar to the III–IV arrangement found in the S100A11-annexin I complex (Ω = 103°) and more “open” compared with either the S100B-p53 (Ω = 110 ± 1°) or S100A10-annexin II (Ω = 117°) complexes. These observations suggest that the relative orientations of helices III and IV may be a governing factor for target specificity. Our previous studies (33Barber K.R. McClintock K.A. Jamieson Jr., G.A. Dimlich R.V. Shaw G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1502-1528Google Scholar) have shown that the TRTK-12 peptide is unstructured in the absence of Ca2+-S100B. Consistent with this, the circular dichroism spectrum of TRTK-12 (Fig. 3) showed an ellipticity minimum at <200 nm indicative of a random coiled structure. Upon binding, TRTK-12 assumes a coiled conformation that folds back upon itself (Fig. 2). The structure determination of TRTK-12 was aided by using a peptide having uniform 13C-labeling at Ile5 and Ile10 and the N-terminal acetyl CH3 positions thus providing 13C markers throughout the peptide length. The coiled structure of TRTK-12 was supported by definitive NOEs between the side chains of residues Trp7–Leu11, and peptide spectra were characterized by an absence of α-helical NOEs and α-proton (and αC for Ile5 and Ile10) chemical shifts not consistent with α-helical structure. These findings are supported by CD spectra of Ca2+-S100B (Fig. 3) that show ellipticity minima at 208 and 222 nm typical of an α-helical protein. Upon addition of 1 eq of TRTK-12 per S100β monomer (Fig. 3). little difference in this spectrum occurs indicating the TRTK-12 peptide does not assume an α-helical conformation. Furthermore, the θ208/θ222 ratio for the complex appears nearly identical to that of Ca2+-S100B, indicating little change in helix-helix interactions occurs. The interface between Ca2+-S100B and TRTK-12 is defined by several residues in helix III (Val52, Lys55, Val56, Thr59, and Leu60) and helix IV (Phe76, Ala80, Ala83, and Cys84). In particular, 13C-labeled Ile5 and Ile10 revealed definitive interactions to residues Thr82 in helix IV and Val52 and Val56 in helix III, respectively (Fig.4). Furthermore, residues Lys9, Ile10, and Leu11 in the C terminus of TRTK-12 have multiple contacts in helix III, and Thr 1The abbreviations used are: S100B, dimeric S100β; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; TRTK-12, acetyl-TRTKIDWNKILS-NH2; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid, Thr3, and Lys4 are in close proximity to Ala83 in helix IV. These interactions position the N terminus of the TRTK-12 peptide near helix IV and the C terminus near helix III resulting in a peptide orientation opposite to that observed for the S100B-p53 complex. Although 13C labeling of the N-terminal acetyl group in TRTK-12 was used, no observable peptide-protein cross-peaks resulting from this label were observed in13C-edited NOE spectra, indicating the extreme N terminus of TRTK-12 is exposed to solvent and does not interact with residues in helix I as the annexin peptides do in the S100A10 and S100A11 structures. A large hydrophobic cavity exists on Ca2+-S100B where TRTK-12 is bound (Fig. 5). This observation is consistent with previous results showing that calcium binding to human S100B results in exposure of a hydrophobic surface (10Smith S.P. Shaw G.S. Structure. 1998; 6: 211-222Google Scholar). Trp7 of the peptide is the anchoring residue nestled in a hydrophobic pocket including residues Val56, Thr59, Phe76, and Val80 of S100B. This environment results in the observed blue shift and an increase in fluorescence intensity for Trp7 upon protein binding (33Barber K.R. McClintock K.A. Jamieson Jr., G.A. Dimlich R.V. Shaw G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1502-1528Google Scholar). Comparison of the exposed surface area between Ca2+-S100B alone and in complex with TRTK-12 shows the side chains of Val56, Thr59, and Ala83 decrease their surface exposure by 86, 96, and 99%, respectively, upon TRTK-12 binding. Similarly, residues Trp7 and Ile10 of TRTK-12 have more than 84 and 90%, respectively, of their surface area buried in the complex. Recent fluorescence studies of the S100B-TRTK-12 interaction have indicated that deletion of the C-terminal 7 residues in S100B results in a drastic decrease in TRTK-12 binding affinity (13McClintock K.A. Van Eldik L.J. Shaw G.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5421-5428Google Scholar). This was attributed to a loss in α-helical structure near Ala83 in the truncated S100B protein. Presumably this would considerably alter the arrangement of residues Val80, Ala83, and Cys84 resulting in a significantly reduced affinity.Figure 5Electrostatic potential surface showing the TRTK-12-binding site on Ca2+-S100B.

B, environment of the anchoring Trp7residue from TRTK-12 (green) showing interactions with S100B residues (blue) in helix III (Val56 and Thr59) and IV (Phe76 and Val80).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Examination of the structure of Ca2+-S100B-TRTK-12 and comparison to the existing structures of S100A10-annexin II, S100A11-annexin I, and S100B-p53 allows a distinction to be made between target recognition by these S100 proteins. Furthermore, the TRTK-12 sequence was identified from random bacteriophage peptide selection and therefore may contain unique binding features in comparison to the natural sequences for the annexin and p53 peptides. In the current structure, the TRTK-12 peptide lies in a hydrophobic cleft formed between helices III and IV maximizing the interaction of the hydrophobic residues Ile5, Trp7, Ile10, and Leu11 with residues in both helices of S100B. Nearly all the interaction is hydrophobic in nature reaffirming earlier work that the S100B-TRTK-12 interaction is tighter at increased ionic strength (13McClintock K.A. Van Eldik L.J. Shaw G.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5421-5428Google Scholar). The interaction is distinct from that of the rat S100B-p53 peptide (16Rustandi R.R. Baldisseri D.M. Weber D.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 570-574Google Scholar), likely due to the sequence differences of the interacting peptides. The target sequence for p53 (SRHKKLMFKT) bears little similarity to TRTK-12 containing a highly positively charged C terminus that orients near the highly acidic N terminus of helix III (EEIKEEQE). In contrast, the charged residues in TRTK-12 are more dispersed throughout its sequence and most are occupied through potential hydrogen-bonding interactions. Nevertheless, some similarities between the target peptide molecules exist. The anchoring residues for the p53 peptide are Leu383 and Phe385, spaced only one residue apart, as are Ile5 and Trp7 in TRTK-12. The distinguishing feature of these two residues in each peptide is their positions with respect to S100B. In the current work Trp7is positioned in an analogous region to Leu383 in p53, whereas the side chain of Ile5 is located nearby that of Phe385 in p53, albeit somewhat shifted due to a different orientation. The reverse nature of these two interactions together with the differential charge balance in the peptides likely results in the reversal of orientation of TRTK-12 to p53 upon binding to S100B. The regions of interaction of TRTK-12 and p53 differ significantly from that of both annexin I and II with S100A11 and S100A10, respectively. Both of the annexin peptides have interactions with several residues in the N-terminal helix I of these S100 proteins (Fig.6 A). An examination of the sequences and interactions reveals three key residues in the annexin peptides (Val3, Glu5, and Leu7) that have identical interactions with the N-terminal residues Glu5, Met8, Glu9, and Met12 in S100A10 (Glu9, Ile12, Glu13, and Ile16 in S100A11). This pattern in the target peptide, where two hydrophobes are separated by three residues, including a central acidic residue, is not found in either the TRTK-12 or p53 peptides. Furthermore, the side chain carboxylate of Glu9 in S100A10 (Glu13 in S100A11) has conserved hydrogen bonds to the Thr2 and Val3amides in annexin II (Met2 and Val3, in S100A11). In S100B the position of Glu9 (Glu13) is held by a hydrophobe (Val8) removing its side chain hydrogen bonding ability. Interestingly, this position is among the least conserved within the S100 protein family. This sequence divergence in both the S100B and S100A10/S100A11 proteins and in the peptide motif is likely responsible for the different target peptide recognition sites between the proteins. Consistent with this, previous experiments have shown that TRTK-12 shows no observable interaction with S100A11 (33Barber K.R. McClintock K.A. Jamieson Jr., G.A. Dimlich R.V. Shaw G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1502-1528Google Scholar) when monitored by Trp7fluorescence. The interaction of Trp7 in TRTK-12 likely contributes to the tightest binding for any S100B target to date. It is also interesting that replacement of Phe385 in the p53 peptide with a Trp residue increases its affinity for rat S100B by about 5-fold (34Rustandi R.R. Drohat A.C. Baldisseri D.M. Wilder P.T. Weber D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1951-1960Google Scholar). In addition, important similarities exist between the environments of Trp7 (TRTK-12) and Trp11(annexin I) even though the orientation of the two target peptides is different with respect to the protein helices in each complex. A comparison of the anchoring Trp7 of TRTK-12 reveals side chain interactions (<6.5 Å) with Ile47, Val52, and Val56 in a majority of the NMR structures. The analogous interactions, involving Gln52, Val57, and Met61 exist for S100A11 (Fig.6 B). Despite this similarity, the differences of the peptide orientations for TRTK-12 and annexin I result in a significant hydrophobic surface for each protein that remains exposed, even in the presence of the bound peptide (Fig. 5 A and Fig.6 C). This may occur simply because the target peptides presently used are too short or that the interaction can be modulated through a second region of interaction. As a result, it has been suggested recently (35Otterbein L.R. Kordowska J. Witte-Hoffmann C. Wang C.-L.A. Dominguez R. Structure. 2002; 10: 557-567Google Scholar) that S100 proteins may bind full-length targets using more than one site. The similarity of the locations for Trp7 (TRTK-12) and Trp11 (annexin I) would provide a unique bridging residue to encompass a larger, contiguous binding region that includes an α-helical annexin type interaction, utilizing the VEL residues found in annexin I and II, and an extended TRTK-12 type interaction based on hydrophobic interactions anchored by Trp7 (Fig. 6 C). It is interesting that the recent structure of the calmodulin-calmodulin kinase kinase peptide complex displays exactly these features, where the N-terminal portion of the peptide forms an α-helical structure and the C-terminal region is more extended (36Kurokawa H. Osawa M. Kurihara H. Katayama N. Tokumitsu H. Swindells M.B. Kainosho M. Ikura M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 59-68Google Scholar), folding back on the helix in addition to having important protein contacts. As in calmodulin, this larger interaction site would also provide a rationale for the promiscuity of S100B target interactions, including cellular architecture proteins such as tubulin, vimentin, desmin, GFAP, and caldesmon, which contain the TRTK-12 consensus motif (12McClintock K.A. Shaw G.S. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2043-2046Google Scholar). It remains to be seen whether the natural sequences for the intermediate filament proteins interact in a similar manner as TRTK-12 or via the α-helical mode found for either annexin or p53 peptides.

To delineate mechanisms involved in retinoid-mediated control of cardiac gene expression, the regulatory effects of the retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) on atrial naturietic factor (ANF) gene transcription was investigated. The transcriptional activity of an ANF promoter-reporter in rat neonatal ventricular myocytes was repressed by RXRα in the presence of 9-cis-RA and by the constitutively active mutant RXRαF318A indicating that liganded RXR confers the regulatory effect. The RXRα-mediated repression mapped to the proximal 147 bp of the rat ANF promoter, a region lacking a consensus retinoid response element but containing several known cardiogenic cis elements including a well characterized GATA response element. Glutathione S-transferase “pull-down” assays revealed that RXRα interacts directly with GATA-4, in a ligand-independent manner, via the DNA binding domain of RXRα and the second zinc finger of GATA-4. Liganded RXRα repressed the activity of a heterologous promoter-reporter construct containing GATA-response element recognition sites in cardiac myocytes but not in several other cell types, suggesting that additional cardiac-enriched factors participate in the repression complex. Co-transfection of liganded RXRα and the known cardiac-enriched GATA-4 repressor, FOG-2, resulted in additive repression of GATA-4 activity in ventricular myocytes. In addition, RXRα was found to bind FOG-2, in a 9-cis-RA-dependent manner. These data reveal a novel mechanism by which retinoids regulate cardiogenic gene expression through direct interaction with GATA-4 and its co-repressor, FOG-2.

Retinoids are compounds, derived from vitamin A, which exert pleiotropic effects on cellular differentiation, morphogenesis, and metabolism. The effects of retinoids on cardiac growth and development are well recognized. Offspring of rodents and birds fed a vitamin A-deficient diet display congenital defects involving many organ systems including the cardiovascular system (1Wilson J.G. Roth C.B. Warkany J. Am. J. Anat. 1953; 92: 189-217Google Scholar, 2Kostetskii I. Jiang Y. Kostetskaia E. Yuan S. Evans T. Zile M. Dev. Biol. 1999; 206: 206-218Google Scholar). Vitamin A replacement at different stages of embryonic development in these animals actually alters the severity and type of heart defects seen at birth indicating that retinoid signaling pathways play key roles in a variety of developmental programs (1Wilson J.G. Roth C.B. Warkany J. Am. J. Anat. 1953; 92: 189-217Google Scholar). Similarly, retinaldehyde dehydrogenase-deficient mice die in utero at embryonic day 8 secondary to poor maturation of the ventricular myocardium, an effect that can be rescued by supplementation of maternal vitamin A (3Niederreither K. Subbarayan V. Dolle P. Chambon P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 444-448Google Scholar, 4Niederreither K. Vermot J. Messaddeq N. Schuhbaur B. Chambon P. Dolle P. Development. 2001; 128: 1019-1031Google Scholar). In addition, retinoids can exert teratogenic effects. Human offspring born of mothers who ingested isotretinoin, a vitamin A analog, during pregnancy exhibited a high incidence of complex cardiac malformations including transposition of the great vessels, tetralogy of Fallot, hypoplastic aortic arch, and ventricular septal defects (5Lammer E.J.

Moreover, in the developing chick, local application of high concentrations of retinoic acid disrupts the migration of the pre-cardiac mesoderm, an effect that is dose-dependent and developmental stage-specific (6Osmond M.K. Butler A.J. Voon F.C. Bellairs R. Development. 1991; 113: 1405-1417Crossref Google Scholar). Retinoids bind to ligand-activated nuclear receptor transcription factors called retinoid receptors. The retinoid receptors comprise a subfamily within the nuclear receptor superfamily including the retinoic acid receptors (RARs) 1The abbreviations used are: RAR, retinoic acid receptor; RXR, retinoid X receptor; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors; ANF, atrial naturietic factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SRF, serum response factor; RE, receptor element; aa, amino acid(s); ZF, zinc finger and the 9-cis-retinoic acid or retinoid X receptors (RXRs). RXRs participate in nuclear receptor regulatory pathways in two distinct manners. First, RXRs serve as heterodimeric partners for other class II nuclear receptors such as thyroid receptor, vitamin D receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), or RARs. Heterodimeric complexes containing RXR in the presence of ligand, recognize and bind cognate DNA elements within the regulatory regions of target genes. Alternatively, RXR can form homodimers in the presence its own ligand, 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA). Thus, RXR has been termed a “master regulator” of retinoid signaling pathways. Interestingly, the transcriptional regulatory effects mediated by retinoids is influenced at multiple levels including specificity of the ligand-receptor interaction, temporal and spatial variations in receptor expression, selection of heterodimeric partners (some of which are permissive for liganded RXR), and the levels of specific co-activators and co-represssor molecules within target tissues. More recently, RXRs and other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily have been shown to interact with non-nuclear receptor transcription factors providing yet another level of complexity in the retinoid signaling pathway (7Kim S.W.

Accordingly, it is not surprising that the observed effects of retinoids on cardiac morphogenesis involves multiple developmental stages and cell types. The cardiac phenotype of RXRα-null mice provides additional evidence for the importance of retinoid signaling in the development, growth, and maturation of the heart. The ventricular myocardium does not develop normally in RXRα-null mice leading to heart failure at embryonic day 15 (10, 11). The incidence of conotruncal defects in RXRα−/− mice is greater than 50% (12Gruber P.J. Kubalak S.W. Pexieder T. Sucov H.M. Evans R.M.C.K.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1332-1343Google Scholar). Furthermore, RXRα heterozygous animals display a wide array of defects involving the conotruncal region, atrioventricular canal, and ventricular myocardium. Taken together, these data indicate that retinoid signaling via RXRα serves a critical role in cardiac growth and development programs. However, the molecular mechanisms by which RXR exerts regulatory effects within the complex process of cardiac morphogenesis remains unclear. As an initial step in the characterization of mechanisms involved in retinoid-mediated cardiac gene regulation, we sought to use an experimental system in which retinoid signaling was isolated from the myriad of signals concurrent during development. To this end, we focused on the observations of others that retinoids inhibit cardiac myocyte hypertrophic growth in vitro. In response to a variety of mechanical or hormonal stimuli, the terminally differentiated cardiomyocyte undergoes hypertrophic growth, a physiological response characterized by an increase in cell size, an increase in sarcomeric organization, and activation of the fetal expression pattern of contractile and metabolic genes (reviewed in Ref.13Chien K.R. Zhu H. Knowlton K.U. Miller-Hance W. van Bilsen M. O'Brien T.X. Evans S.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 77-95Google Scholar). The cellular regulatory pathways involved in the induction of cardiac hypertrophy and development of heart failure are currently being unraveled. Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) gene expression is increased during cardiac hypertrophic growth and has been used as a consistent marker of the hypertrophy program. Several groups have shown that RXRα, in the presence of 9-cis-RA, represses the hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes in culture (14Zhou M.D. Sucov H.M. Evans R.M. Chien K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7391-7395Google Scholar, 15Wu J. Garami M. Cheng T. Gardner D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1577-1588Google Scholar). We hypothesized that delineation of cis-elements andtrans-acting factors mediating the effects of 9-cis-RA on ANF gene transcription would provide information about the mechanisms involved in the regulation of cardiogenic gene transcription by retinoids. In this report, we demonstrate that liganded RXRα regulates ANF gene transcription through a mechanism uncharacteristic of previously described retinoid signaling pathways. Our results indicate that RXRα represses ANF promoter activity in cardiomyocytes by interacting directly with the transcription factor GATA-4 and its co-repressor FOG-2. These results identify a mechanism whereby retinoid signaling modulates gene expression in the heart and unveils a new permutation in the retinoid signaling pathway. Rat neonatal cardiomyocyte cultures were prepared as described (16Brandt J. Djouadi F. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23786-23792Google Scholar). Briefly, hearts were removed from 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats, the atria and great vessels were trimmed off, and tissue was finely minced followed by sequential digestion with 0.5 mg/ml collagenase (WAKO, Richmond, VA). Ventricular cardiomyocytes were separated from fibroblasts by differential plating and were cultured in gelatin-coated 12-well tissue culture plates (0.4 hearts/well) in media containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% horse serum, 5% fetal calf serum, 100 μmbromodeoxyuridine, penicillin, streptomycin, andl-glutamine. Cardiomyocytes were transfected with promoter-reporter constructs and transcription factors using the calcium-phosphate precipitation method (17Tunnacliffe A. Parkar M. Povey S. Bengtsson B.O. Stanley K. Solomon E. Goodfellow P. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1577-1584Google Scholar) with 4 μg of reporter and 0.5 μg of receptor per well. After 24 h, media was changed to serum-free media containing 10 μg/ml transferrin, 10 μg/ml insulin, and 100 μm bromodeoxyuridine, with the addition of phenylephrine (5 μm) and retinoid ligand daily for 3 days. CV-1 cells (African green monkey kidney fibroblasts, obtained from ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in minimal essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections of CV-1 cells were also performed using the calcium-phosphate precipitation method in minimal essential medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum that was pre-stripped using activated charcoal, to remove retinoid ligand normally present in serum. 9-cis-Retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) and TTNPB ((E)-4-(2-(5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthalenyl)-1-propenyl)benzoic acid) were obtained from Sigma. Luciferase was assayed in cardiomyocytes 48–72 h after transfection. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed using Promega reporter lysis buffer. Luciferase activity in the cell lysates was assayed using BD Pharmingen substrates A and B according to the manufacturer's instructions in a analytical luminescence luminometer. Growth hormone was assayed from supernatants 72 h after transfection of cardiocytes or 48 h after transfection of CV-1s, using a kit from Nichols Institute Diagnostics (San Juan Capistrano, CA). All reporter activities were corrected for the activity of an SV40-β-galactosidase plasmid. Serial truncations of the rat ANF gene promoter were produced by PCR amplification followed by cloning into pGL2 basic (Promega) using MluI and XhoI sites to produce −633ANF.luc, −316ANF.luc, −147ANF.luc, and −107ANF.luc using the following 5′ primers: 5′-gatcgcacgcgttttagacctgtatcatgttgg-3′ (for −633), 5′-tagataacgcgtccagggagaaggaaatcctga-3′ (for −316), 5′-agttatacgcgtgggctgtgacaagcttcg-3′ (for −147), and 5′-atattaacgcgtgcatcttctcctggccgc-3′ (for −107) and the same 3′ primer 5′-agatcactcgagatctgatgtttgctgtctcgg-3′. Point mutations of the rat ANF promoter were performed as follows: the GATA response element at −122 was mutated in both the −316ANF.luc and the −147ANF.luc constructs from TGATAA to TACTAA by site-directed mutagenesis using the following primers: 5′-GCTGTGACAAGCTTCGCTGGACTACTAACTTTAAAAGCGCATCTTCTCCTGGC-3′ and 5′-GCCAGGAGAAGATGCGCTTTTAAAGTTAGTAGTCCAGCGAAGCTTGTCACAGC-3′. pSG5mRXRαF318A was produced by site-directed mutagenesis of pSG5 mRXRα (Pierre Chambon) using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions with the following oligonucleotide primer pairs: 5′-gctgctgatcgcctccgcctcccaccgctccatagc-3′ and 5′-gctatggagcggtgggaggcggaggcgatcagcagc-3′. RXR truncation mutants were made by PCR into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pSG5, using the following primers: pSG5mRXRα aa 132–467, 5′-catgtagaattccatgagttagtcgtagacatgtgtgctatctgtggggaccgctcc-3′ and 5′-gattctaagcttctggagctgagcagctgtgtccaggca-3′; pSG5mRXRα aa 132–238, 5′-catgtagaattccatgagttagtcgtagacatgtgtgctatctgtggggaccgctcc-3′ and 5′-aaagcttctatacaggcatgtcctcgttggcact-3′; pSG5mRXRα ΔAF-2, 5′-cctgtcgaattgatggacaccaaagatttc-3′ and 5′-ctcgagaggcttctagatgagcttgaagacaggtgctcctggca-3′; pCR2.1mRXRα203–467 was constructed by using 5′-atgaagcgggaagcgggaagctgtg-3′ and 5′-gattctaagcttctggagctgagcagctgtgtccaggca-3′. GST-RXR was produced using the pGEX 2TKG vector (a gift from Ellen Li, Washington University) and the EcoRI/HindIII fragment from pSG5.mRXRα. GST-mRXRα F318A was made using site-directed mutagenesis, with the same primers as the pSG5mRXRαF318A mutant. The pMT2 mGATA-4, GATA-RE.growth hormone, and GST-mGATA-4 have been described (18Arceci R.J. King A.A. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Wilson D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2235-2246Google Scholar). GATA-4 mutants used in GST “pull-down” experiments were cloned by PCR amplification using pSG5mGATA-4 as template into theEcoRI/SalI sites in pSG5 using the following primers: for GATA, aa 1–440, 5′-agaatcgaattccttggggcgatgtaccaaagcctgccatgg-3′ and 5′-gttacagtcgacttacgcggtgattatgacccctag-3′; aa 1–186, 5′-agaatcgaattccttggggcgatgtaccaaagcctgccatgg-3′ and 5′-ataaaagtcgacttatgggctgtcgaaggggccggcaga-3′; aa 204–300, 5′-agcgctgaattccttggggcgatgtttgatgacttctcagaaggcaga-3′ and 5′-agactggtcgacttacatggagcttcatgtagaggccgc-3′; aa 244–440, 5′-attacagaattccttggggcgatgaacggcatcaaccggccc-3′ and 5′-gttacagtcgacttacgcggtgattatgacccctag-3′. The point mutation in ZF2 of GATA-4 (C290293S(ΔZF2)) was made by site-directed mutagenesis as above using oligonucleotide primer pairs 5′-ggtgagccctgtaagtaatgccagcggcctctacatgaagc-3′ and 5′-gcctcatgtagaggccgctggcattacttacaggctcacc-3′ Plasmids were verified by sequence analysis using ABI prism automated sequencing technology at the institutional core facility. GST fusion proteins were produced using pGEX vectors (Amersham Biosciences) in DE3 bacteria according to the manufacturer's instructions with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction of bacterial protein expression with some modifications: insoluble proteins were solubilized in 7 m urea/phosphate-buffered saline followed by dialysis. Proteins were verified by Coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE gels and by Western blot using an anti-GST antibody. Bacterial lysate containing 2 μg of the GST fusion protein or control GST protein were bound to 15 μl of glutathione-Sepharose in bead binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 60 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 15% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (Calbiochem)) at room temperature and then washed in bead binding buffer. Five μl of in vitrotranslated protein (tnT T7 Quick-coupled kit according to the manufacturer's instructions) was incubated for 1 h at room temperature, washed with bead binding buffer, and resolved on SDS-PAGE, then visualized by autoradiography. In binding studies involving retinoid ligand, ligand was included in the wash buffers as well as the protein incubation period. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were determined using unpaired, two-tailed Student t tests. The traditional mechanism of retinoid-mediated transcriptional control occurs via the action of liganded retinoid receptors bound to DNA recognition sequences within regulatory regions of target genes. Analysis of the rat ANF promoter sequence failed to reveal retinoid receptor recognition sequences (AGGTnA). Thus, we hypothesized that the known repression of ANF gene transcription by retinoids occurs through an indirect mechanism such as the modulation of trans-acting factors by RXR. Thecis-acting regulatory elements necessary for RXR-mediated repression of ANF gene transcription were localized by assaying a 5′ deletion series of the rat ANF promoter fused to a luciferase reporter (ANF.Luc) in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. The experiments were performed in the absence and presence of the α1-adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine, to allow evaluation of effects on basal activity and hypertrophic response. Cotransfection of an expression plasmid for RXRα markedly repressed the activity of −633ANF.luc in a 9-cis-RA-dependent manner in the presence or absence of phenylephrine (Fig.1 A). Similar RXRα-dependent repression was observed for the −316ANF.luc and −147ANF.luc constructs (Fig. 1 A). Given that the basal activity of the smallest construct (−107ANF.luc) was very low it was not possible to determine with certainty whether it localized the cis-acting element mediating the repression by retinoids. These results localized the cis-acting elements involved in the RXR-mediated repression of ANF gene transcription to a region within 147 nucleotides of the transcription start site. Importantly, this region contains response elements for several transcription factors known to be critical for the transcriptional control of ANF and other cardiac genes; GATA-4, a zinc finger transcription factor important in cardiogenesis and the cardiac hypertrophic program (19Wilson D.B.

Chem. 2001; 276: 1026-1033Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of the proximal GATA-response element (GATA-RE) in the retinoid-mediated repression of the ANF gene promoter, the site was mutated in the context of −316ANF.luc (−316ΔGATA.ANF.luc) and −147ANF.luc (−147ΔGATA.ANF.luc) for use in cotransfection assays. The basal activity of both −316ΔGATA.ANF.luc and −147ΔGATA.ANF.luc, although still active, was significantly diminished compared with the corresponding wild-type constructs (Fig. 1 B). The retinoid-mediated repression observed with −316ΔGATA.ANF.luc was significantly less than that of −316ANF.luc but was not completely obliterated (30% compared with 94%, Fig. 1 B). Similarly, the repression of the −147ΔGATARE ANF.luc construct was also significantly less than that of the wild-type construct (42 compared with 88%, Fig. 1 B). Taken together, these data indicate that the GATA-response element is necessary for the full repression conferred by retinoids in cardiomyocytes, but also suggest that other elements may play a role. Furthermore, the importance of the interaction between adjacent elements within the native promoter cannot be underestimated, especially in light of the known cooperativity between GATA, Nkx2.5, and SRF. RXR is capable of heterodimerizing with other nuclear receptors including members of the RAR, vitamin D receptor, and PPAR families. To define the receptor specificity of the RXRα-mediated repression of the ANF promoter, the requirement of its activation domain and the effects of RXR homodimerization were analyzed using two mutants, mRXRαF318A and RXRΔAF-2. RXRαF318A is a constitutively active mutant (31Vivat V. Zechel C. Wurtz J.M. Bourguet W. Kagechika H. Umemiya H. Shudo K. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5697-5709Google Scholar). The conformational change induced by the phenylalanine to alanine substitution allows the RXRαF318A mutant to exist in the dimer but not the tetramer form and to possess constitutivetrans-activation properties in the absence of exogenous ligand (32Egea P.F. Mitschler A. Rochel N. Ruff M. Chambon P. Moras D. EMBO J. 2000; 11: 2592-2601Google Scholar, 33Kersten S. Dong D. Lee W. Reczek P.R. Noy N. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 21-32Google Scholar). RXRΔAF-2, which lacks the COOH-terminal 19 amino acids, is unable to recruit co-activator molecules (31Vivat V. Zechel C. Wurtz J.M. Bourguet W. Kagechika H. Umemiya H. Shudo K. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5697-5709Google Scholar, 34Mascrez B. Mark M. Dierich A. Ghyselinck N.B. Kastner P. Chambon P. Development. 1998; 125: 4691-4707Google Scholar). We confirmed the predicted activity of the RXRα mutants in CV-1 cells using a known RXR-response element (RXR-RE) derived from the cellular retinoid-binding protein II gene (Fig.2 A). CV-1 cells were used for these experiments because they are largely devoid of endogenous retinoid receptor activity. As expected, wild-type RXRα conferred marked activation of the RXR-RE only in the presence of the ligand 9-cis-RA (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, the mRXRαF318A mutant activated the RXR-RE in the absence of ligand. As expected, RXRΔAF-2 was inactive with the RXR-RE. We then assayed the effect of these mutants on ANF promoter-reporter activity in ventricular cardiomyocytes (Fig. 2 B). ANF promoter activity was profoundly repressed with the F318A mutant in the absence of ligand. In contrast, the RXRΔAF-2 mutant did not confer repression. These latter results indicated that as predicted by the 9-cis-RA dependence, an intact AF-2 domain is required for the repressive effects of RXRα on the ANF promoter. Moreover, these data demonstrate that the repressive effect is mediated largely by RXRα rather than one of its nuclear receptor partners. The RXR specificity of the repressive response was further evaluated by dose-response studies using RXR- and RAR-specific ligands in the cardiomyocyte culture system. The RXR ligand, 9-cis-RA, repressed −633ANF.luc in a dose-dependent manner only in the presence of RXRα (Fig. 2 C). Addition of RARα had no affect on the 9-cis-RA response (Fig. 2 B). Specifically, 9-cis-RA did not mediate a repressive response in the presence of RARα alone, and the effects observed with addition of both RXRα and RARα were similar to that of RXRα alone. Moreover, a dose-response analysis using the RAR-specific ligand TTNPB revealed that at no concentration did liganded RAR alone confer repression (Fig. 2 D). In the presence of RXRα, however, repression was observed at a concentration 100-fold greater than the effective 9-cis-RA concentration (Fig. 2 D). Similar studies to analyze “permissive” RXR heterodimers demonstrated that PPARα/RXRα heterodimers, at high concentrations of the PPARα ligand ETYA (10−5m), conferred only 40% repression of ANF promoter activity in cardiomyocytes (data not shown). Furthermore, VDR/RXRα heterodimers demonstrated a ligand dose-dependent repressive effect on ANF promoter activity, with 30 and 60% repression at 10−7 and 10−6m vitamin D, respectively (data not shown). Accordingly, the effects of ligands specific for permissive heterodimeric partners of RXR did not approach the potency seen with RXR ligands. Taken together these results indicate that liganded RXR is the dominant receptor conferring repression of the ANF promoter. The data shown in Fig. 1demonstrated that the GATA-response element present in the proximal region of the ANF gene promoter was involved in the retinoid-mediated repression. However, a role for SRF or Nkx2.5 was not excluded. To explore this further, the effect of RXRα on GATA-4, SRF, and Nkx2.5 was explored using independent reporters containing response elements for each of the factors. RXRα/9-cis-RA had no affect in cardiomyocytes on the activity of reporters containing heterologous Nkx2.5 or SRF-response elements, respectively (data not shown). In striking contrast, the activity of a GATA-4 responsive construct (GATA-RE6.GH) was markedly repressed by RXRα/9-cis-RA. Specifically, the high level activity of GATA-RE6.GH in cardiomyocytes was abolished by RXRα in a 9-cis-RA-dependent manner (Fig.3 A). Interestingly, the RXRα-mediated repression of GATA-RE6.GH was not observed in the noncardiomyocyte cell line CV-1, even in the presence of overexpressed GATA-4 (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, addition of Nkx-2.5, SRF, or the known co-repressing RXR interacting partner SHP, alone or in combination, did not recapitulate the RXRα-mediated repression in CV-1 cells (data not shown). These results together with the data shown in Fig. 1 B demonstrate that the GATA-response element is sufficient for retinoid-mediated repression and necessary for the full repressive effect on the ANF gene promoter. The data shown above suggested that liganded RXRα inhibits GATA-4 activity through a cardiomyocyte-specific mechanism, possibly via the effects of a cell-specific repressor recruited by RXRα. Alternatively, GATA-4 expression could be down-regulated by a retinoid signaling pathway. However, the amount of cardiomyocyte GATA-4 protein detected by Western blot analysis was not affected by overexpression of RXRα in the presence of 9-cis-RA (data not shown). To determine whether RXR interacts directly with GATA-4, GST pull-down assays were performed. GATA-4 bound to GST-RXRα in an interaction that, surprisingly, did not require ligand (Fig.4). Indeed, addition of 9-cis-RA had no effect on the binding. The specificity of this interaction was confirmed by the lack of binding with GST alone (Fig. 4). The interaction of RXRα with PPARα is also shown as a control. These data demonstrate a direct interaction between RXRα and GATA-4 but does not explain the precise role of ligand in the RXR-mediated repression of the ANF-promoter. To further characterize the specificity of the interaction between RXRα and GATA-4 and to map the relevant domains within RXRα, a series of RXRα truncation and point mutants were used in GST pull-down studies. The results demonstrated that the C domain of RXR, which contains the DNA binding site, is critical for the interaction with GATA-4 (Fig. 5 A). Specifically, an 35S-labeled RXRα amino-terminal deletion mutant protein containing the C domain (aa 132–467), bound GST-GATA-4 while an amino-terminal deletion mutant lacking the C domain (203–467) did not bind (Fig. 5 A). An RXRα fragment containing only the C domain (132–210) also bound GATA-4 (Fig. 5 A). In addition"

However, apart from phenylpropanoids and flavonoids, very few enzymes involved in coumarin biosynthesis have been identified. We report here the molecular and biochemical characterization of a gene encoding a novel O-methyltransferase that catalyzes the methylation of 7,8-dihydroxycoumarin, daphnetin. The recombinant protein displayed an exclusive methylation of position 8 of daphnetin. The identity of the methylated product was unambiguously identified as 7-hydroxy-8-methoxycoumarin by co-chromatography on cellulose TLC and coelution from high performance liquid chromatography, with authentic synthetic samples, as well as by UV, mass spectroscopy,1H NMR spectral analysis, and NOE correlation signals of the relevant protons. Northern blot analysis and enzyme activity assays revealed that the transcript and corresponding enzyme activity are up-regulated by both low temperature and photosystem II excitation pressure. Using various phenylpropanoid and flavonoid substrates, we demonstrate that cold acclimation of rye leaves increasesO-methyltransferase activity not only for daphnetin but also for the lignin precursors, caffeic acid, and 5-hydroxyferulic acid.

The significance of this novel enzyme and daphnetinO-methylation is discussed in relation to its putative role in modulating cold acclimation and photosystem II excitation pressure. photosystem II O-methyltransferase high performance liquid chromatography rye cDNA encodingO-methyltransferase thin layer chromatography photochemical quenching Low temperature is one of the most important environmental factors limiting the productivity and distribution of plants. Exposure of plants to low, nonfreezing temperatures, a process known as cold acclimation, induces the genetic system required for increased freezing tolerance. Knowledge of the molecular, physiological, and biochemical changes that occur during this process could lead to the improvement of plant productivity. This complex process has been extensively studied and several cold-responsive genes have been isolated from a range of dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous species (1Hughes M.A. Dunn M.A. J. Exp. Bot. 1996; 47: 291-305Crossref Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 2Thomashow M.F. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 571-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2712) Google Scholar). Although the functions of some of these genes are known (3Jones P.G. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 4Nishida I. Murata N. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 541-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 5Chun J.U. Yu X.M. Griffith M.

Plant J. 1998; 16: 433-442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the details of the processes responsible for their regulation and detection of temperature changes are still incomplete. Previous studies have shown that development of freezing tolerance in winter cereals, such as wheat and rye, is correlated with an increase in their photosynthetic capacity (7Huner N.P.A. Öquist G. Hurry V. Krol M. Falk S. Griffith M. Photosynth. Res. 1993; 37: 19-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Thus, growth at low temperature not only induces freezing tolerance, but also results in an increased resistance to low temperature-induced photoinhibition of photosynthesis, and requires adjustment to a combination of light and low temperature. The common photosynthetic response of plants to low temperature and normal light is rationalized in terms of photosystem II (PSII)1 excitation pressure, which is a measure of the redox state of the first electron acceptor, quinone A (7Huner N.P.A. Öquist G. Hurry V. Krol M. Falk S. Griffith M. Photosynth. Res. 1993; 37: 19-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 8Gray G.R. Chauvin L.P. Sarhan F. Huner N.P.A. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 9NDong C. Danyluk J. Huner N.P. Sarhan F. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 45: 691-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It has been shown that cold-acclimated rye and wheat grown at 5 °C/250 μmol m−2 s−1 (5/250) (°C temperature/light intensity μmol m−2s−1) exhibit a similar tolerance to photoinhibition as plants grown at high light (20/800) because both cold-acclimated and high-light plants are exposed to a comparable high excitation pressure measured as 1-qP (10Gray G.R. Savitch L.V. Ivanov A.G. Huner N.P.A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Similarly, nonacclimated rye and wheat grown at 20/250 exhibit a similar sensitivity to photoinhibition as plants grown at low temperature but low light (5/50) because both nonacclimated plants and plants grown at 5/50 are exposed to comparable low excitation pressure. Our previous studies have shown that in addition to the traditional role of photosynthesis in energy transduction, the redox state acts as a signal that initiates a transduction pathway coordinating genetic and biochemical responses in wheat and rye plants (8Gray G.R. Chauvin L.P. Sarhan F. Huner N.P.A. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 9NDong C. Danyluk J. Huner N.P. Sarhan F. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 45: 691-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis revealed that several genes are associated with increased photosystem II excitation pressure (9NDong C. Danyluk J. Huner N.P. Sarhan F. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 45: 691-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Of these genes, one exhibited homology to several plant O-methyltransferases (OMTs). Methyltransferases are essential enzymes for directing intermediates into specific biosynthetic pathways (11Poulton J.E. Conn E.E. The Biochemistry of Plants. 7. Academic Press, New York1981: 667-723Google Scholar). EnzymaticO-methylation, catalyzed byS-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent OMTs, is a ubiquitous reaction that takes place in almost all organisms including bacteria, fungi, plants, and mammals. In plants,O-methylation of phenolic compounds such as phenylpropanoids, coumarins, and flavonoids, play an important role in processes such as structural support, flower pigmentation, chemical defense, and signaling (12Dixon R.A. Paiva N.L. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1085-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (3660) Google Scholar). Of the large number of plant OMTs that are involved in secondary metabolism (11Poulton J.E. Conn E.E. The Biochemistry of Plants. 7. Academic Press, New York1981: 667-723Google Scholar), only a few involved in coumarin biosynthesis have been enzymatically characterized (13Legrand M. Fritig B. Hirth L. Planta. 1978; 144: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Sharma S.K. Garrett J.M. Brown S.A. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1979; 34: 387-391Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 15Tsang Y.F. Ibrahim R.K. Phytochemistry. 1979; 18: 1131-1136Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, a cDNA encoding the 5-OMT for bergaptol (a linear furanocoumarin), has been cloned (16Lois R. Hahlbrock K. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1992; 47: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Simple plant coumarins are the cyclization products of their corresponding o-hydroxycinnamic acids (17Murray R. Mendez D.H. Brown S.A. The Natural Coumarins: Occurrence, Chemistry and Biochemistry. Wiley & Sons, New York1982Google Scholar). They are widely distributed in plants, although members of the Apiaceae, Rutaceae, and Moraceae are particularly rich sources of coumarins. Several members of these families are used as spices and vegetables in human diet, as well as for medicinal purposes (18Matern U. Lüer P. Kreusch D. Barton D. Nakanishi K. Meth-Cohn O. Sankawa U. Comprehensive Natural Products Chemistry. 1. Elsevier, Amsterdam1999: 623-637Google Scholar). Coumarins are considered to be components of the general defense response of plants to abiotic and biotic stresses. In addition, various substituted coumarins exhibit antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory activity and act as inhibitors of numerous enzyme systems (17Murray R. Mendez D.H. Brown S.A. The Natural Coumarins: Occurrence, Chemistry and Biochemistry. Wiley & Sons, New York1982Google Scholar). Furthermore, coumarins exhibit numerous effects of medicinal value (18Matern U. Lüer P. Kreusch D. Barton D. Nakanishi K. Meth-Cohn O. Sankawa U. Comprehensive Natural Products Chemistry. 1. Elsevier, Amsterdam1999: 623-637Google Scholar). We report here the molecular and biochemical characterization of a rye cDNA, ScOMT1 encoding a novel enzyme that exclusively methylates the 7,8-dihydroxycoumarin (daphnetin) at position 8 to yield 7-hydroxy-8-methoxycoumarin. This enzyme is regulated by both photosystem II excitation pressure and low temperature. The possible role of this enzyme in the modulation of photosystem II excitation pressure and cold acclimation is discussed. Seeds of winter rye (Secale cereale L., Gramineae, cv. Musketeer) were germinated in coarse vermiculite and grown at temperatures of either 20/16 or 5/5 °C (day/night) with a 16-h photoperiod in controlled environment chambers (Conviron, Manitoba, Canada) as described previously (9NDong C. Danyluk J. Huner N.P. Sarhan F. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 45: 691-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Growth irradiance was adjusted to 50 or 250 μmol m−2 s−1 at 5 °C (5/50 and 5/250, respectively) and 50, 250, or 800 μmol m−2s−1 at 20 °C (20/50, 20/250, or 20/800, respectively). S-Adenosyl-l-[14CH3]methionine (AdoMet; specific activity 55 Ci/mol) was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. (St. Louis, MO) and unlabeled AdoMet was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Montreal, Quebec). The phenolic substrates and reference compounds used were from our laboratory collection. The 7,8-dihydroxycoumarin (daphnetin) was purchased from Extrasynthèse (Lyon, France). Daphnetin was synthesized according to the method of Molyneux and Jurd (19Molyneuz R.J. Jurd L. Aust. J. Chem. 1974; 27: 2697-2702Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar), in which a mixture of pyrogallol and malic acid was heated in concentrated sulfuric acid under nitrogen. The gummy residue, which separated upon the addition of ice-water, was dissolved in methanol, which on cooling and concentration, yielded daphnetin: m.p. 256–257 °C; UV λmaxMeOH nm 265, 330; EIMSm/z (relative intensity (rel. int.) %) 178 [M+] (53), 150 (42Grayer R.J.

Because none of the methylated derivatives of daphnetin are available commercially, both methylated isomers were synthesized as follows. A mixture of trimethylsilyldiazomethane in hexane andN,N-diisopropylamine in dioxane-MeOH was stirred for 20 h at room temperature. The mixture was poured into 2 n HCl, extracted with EtOAc, and then washed with saturated aqueous NaCl. Solvent evaporation and chromatography of the residue on a silica gel column, using toluene-acetone (10:1, v/v) as eluent, gave rise to 7-hydroxy-8-methoxycoumarin, 8-hydroxy-7-methoxycoumarin, and 7,8-dimethoxycoumarin. UV spectra were obtained from the diode array detector during HPLC and are given as λmax nm. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a 270 MHz JEOL JHM-EX270 spectrometer in acetone-d 6 or in CDCl3; NOESY by a 500 MHz Bruker AMX500 in acetone-d 6 and coupling constants (J values) in Hz. m.p. 163–164 °C; UV λmaxMeOH nm 254, 324; EIMSm/z (rel. int.) 192 [M+] (100), 177 (19Molyneuz R.J.

The chemical structures of both methylated isomers were unambiguously verified by NOESY. In the spectrum of 7-hydroxy-8-methoxycoumarin, NOE (nuclear Overhauser effect) correlation signals were observed between 8-OCH3 at δ 3.93 (s) and 7-OH at δ 8.93 (s) (weak), 7-OH and H-6 at δ6.87 (d,J = 8.4 Hz) (weak), H-6 and H-5 at δ 7.26 (d,J = 8.4 Hz) (medium), H-5 and H-4 at δ 7.85 (d,J = 9.6 Hz) (medium), and between H-4 and H-3 at δ 6.17 (d,J = 9.6 Hz) (medium), whereas in that of 8-hydroxy-7-methoxycoumarin NOE strong correlation signals were observed between 7-OCH3 at δ 3.94 (s) and H-6 at δ 7.01 (d,J = 8.6 Hz) and medium correlation signals between H-6 and H-5 at δ 7.12 (d,J = 8.6 Hz), H-5 and H4 at δ 7.84 (d,J = 9.6 Hz), and H-4 and H-3 at δ 6.19 (d,J = 9.6 Hz). These results indicate unequivocally the substituted patterns of the methoxy protons, a hydroxy proton, two aromatic protons, and two olefinic protons in both compounds. Poly(A)+ RNA from plants grown at 20 °C/800 μmol m−2 s−1 was used to synthesize double stranded cDNA (Amersham kit) and ligated toXhoI-EcoRI adaptors as previously described (9NDong C. Danyluk J. Huner N.P. Sarhan F. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 45: 691-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The library was screened with 32P-labeled cDNA probes prepared from poly(A)+ RNA isolated from plants grown at 20 °C/800 μmol m−2 s−1 and at 20 °C/250 μmol m−2 s−1 (control plants). The plaques showing a differential hybridization signal with these probes were selected and purified using standard molecular biology techniques (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total RNA (10 μg) samples were separated on formaldehyde-agarose gels as previously described (9NDong C. Danyluk J. Huner N.P. Sarhan F. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 45: 691-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, RNA was transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and hybridized with ScOMT1 32P-labeled cDNA insert. Filters were washed at 65 °C with several buffer changes of decreasing sodium saline citrate concentration (5× to 0.1) and autoradiographed on Kodak X-Omat RP films with intensifying screens at −80 °C. The cDNAs were completely sequenced using a Li-Cor automated sequencing device (DNA Sequencing Facility, Centre for Applied Genomics, Toronto, ON). A computer-aided search of protein and DNA sequences was carried out with the FASTA and TFASTA programs of the Genetic Computer Group sequence analysis software Wisconsin package, version 10.0. The ScOMT1 open reading frame was amplified using the primers 5′-CGGTGATGGAGGATCCCAACGATG-3′ and 3′-AGTTTCACTTGCCATGGTATTTTC-5′ containing recognition sites forBamHI and KpnI, respectively. After PCR amplification, the ScOMT1 cDNA was digested withBamHI and KpnI and subcloned into theBamHI and KpnI site of pTrc-His vector (Novagen) containing a polyhistidine tag. Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with Escherichia colicarrying the ScOMT1 construct. The bacterial cells were grown to an A 600 of 0.5 at 37 °C and were induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 1 mm, then harvested 3 h later. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 8,000 ×g for 10 min, and resuspended in 8 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl. The mixture was sonicated using a sonic dismembrator 550 (Fisher Scientific) for 1 min 40 s and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The clear supernatant was collected for further purification and enzyme assays. The ScOMT1 fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography on Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) then desalted on PD10 columns (Amersham Biosciences). Alternatively, the pellets derived from 2-liter cultures were re-suspended in 100 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol, pH 7.5 (standard buffer). After sonication and centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the clear supernatant was brought to 40% ammonium sulfate saturation and the pellet obtained was dissolved in the standard buffer adjusted at pH 8.5, desalted on PD10 columns, then chromatographed on a DEAE-cellulose column previously equilibrated with the standard buffer, pH 8.5. The enzyme was eluted with the standard buffer containing 250 mm NaCl. The enzymatically active fraction was collected and used for subsequent analyses. Protein was routinely extracted from the plant material at 4 °C using phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g, the supernatant was desalted on a PD10 column before further use. Proteins were quantified by the method of Bradford using the Bio-Rad reagents and bovine serum albumin as the protein standard. The ScOMT1 assay was performed as previously described (21De Luca V. Ibrahim R.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 238: 596-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) using a final concentration of 200 μm substrate (in 1% dimethyl sulfoxide), 2.5 μm[14CH3]AdoMet (containing 25 nCi), and up to 100 μg of protein in 1× phosphate-buffered saline in a total volume of 100 μl. The reaction was started by the addition of the enzyme, incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, and stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 6 m HCl. The methylated product was extracted in a mixture of benzene-ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v) and an aliquot of the organic phase was counted for radioactivity using a toluene-based scintillation fluid. The remaining sample was chromatographed on either a cellulose TLC plate (20 × 20 cm) using ethyl acetate, acetic acid, H2O (1:3:7, v/v/v) or an Agilent Eclipse C18 silica column (4.6 × 250 mm; particle size, 5 μm; Waters, Milford, MA) using 20% methanol in 1% acetic acid for 2 min followed by a linear gradient to 40% methanol and 1% acetic acid for 30 min; maintained for 5 min, then equilibrated to the original conditions for 15 min. The developed TLC plate was then exposed in a Bio-Rad molecular imager system and the data were analyzed with the software provided. The nucleotide sequence ofScOMT1 (Secale cereale OMT1) comprises 1373 base pairs containing 71 nucleotides of 5′-untranslated and 237 nucleotides of 3′-untranslated sequences including the poly(A) tail. The cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 355 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 38 kDa and a predicted pI value of 7.4 (Fig. 1 A). Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with other plant OMTs reveals sequence identities ranging from 26 to 40% (Fig.1 B). However, the highest identity (57%) is observed with the maize herbicide Safener-binding protein, SafBP (22Scott-Craig J.S. Casida J.E. Poduje L. Walton J.D. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 1083-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A sequence alignment of these proteins shows five regions in the C-terminal portion (regions I to V, Fig. 1 B) that have been reported to be conserved among most plant OMTs (23Ibrahim R.K. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 249-250Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and proposed to be involved in the AdoMet binding site for plant OMTs (23Ibrahim R.K. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 249-250Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 24Bugos R.C. Chiang V.C. Campbell W.H. Plant Mol.

Several amino acids not included in the five conserved regions were found to be conserved between ScOMT1 and other plant OMTs (Fig. 1 B). They may correspond to binding sites for phenolic substrates, given that these compounds share some structural similarities.Figure 1ScOMT1 sequence analysis.

Sequence alignment was done using the Biology Workbench website version 3.2 at www.workbench.sdsc.edu and Canadian Bioinformatics Resource (CBR) at www.cbr.nrc.ca. Percentages of amino acid sequence identity of the various OMTs against ScOMT1 are indicated at the end of the alignment. Dashes represent inserted spaces for maximum sequence alignment. I toV correspond to the conserved regions proposed for plants OMTs (23Ibrahim R.K. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 249-250Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and the shaded areas indicate highly conserved sequences. C, phylogenetic analysis of various plant OMT amino acid sequences (substrate preferences in brackets) using Phylip (Phylogeny Interference Package version 3.57). ScOMT1 ishighlighted. Bootstrap confidence values (n= 100) are shown at the forks. OMT sequences used in this analysis are the ones listed in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The phylogenetic relationship of ScOMT1 to other plant OMTs was deduced from the amino acid alignment presented in Fig. 1 B. The parsimony tree generated from 13 different OMTs shows a good alignment of their sequences that is supported by high (72–100%) bootstrap frequencies. It also illustrates that the ScOMT1 and maize Safener-binding protein sequences occupy a distinct branch relative to the other plant OMTs (Fig. 1 C). The fact that Pinus radiata, Arabidopsis thaliana, andPopulus tremuloides OMTs are phylogenetically more distant and highly divergent from ScOMT1 and the other OMTs suggests that they may have evolved independently despite the conservation of their consensus motifs (Fig. 1 C). Expression of the recombinant ScOMT1 gave rise to a fusion product that possessed a six-histidine tag as part of a leader sequence at the N terminus of the protein. The molecular mass of this protein is consistent with the addition of a 3.7-kDa His tag leader sequence fused to the 38-kDa ScOMT1. The purified protein did not exhibit any significant enzyme activity. This may be attributed to the inhibiting effect of Ni2+ ions that may leach from the column and remain in contact with the enzyme protein (26Séguin J. Muzac I. Ibrahim R.K. Phytochemistry. 1998; 49: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, dialysis and the addition of both EDTA and β-mercaptoethanol to the protein extract following affinity chromatography did not prevent the loss of enzyme activity. On the other hand, ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by DEAE-cellulose chromatography resulted in an enzymatically active ScOMT1. The partially purified recombinant ScOMT1 exhibited exclusive specificity for daphnetin as a substrate forO-methylation. The enzyme did not accept either the 6,7-dihydroxy analog, esculetin, or caffeic acid, 5-hydroxyferulic acid, luteolin (a 3′,4′-dihyroxyflavone), quercetin (a 3′,4′-dihyroxyflavonol), umbelliferone (7-hydroxycoumarin), naringenin (a 4′-hydroxyflavanone), apigenin (a 4′-hydroxyflavone), or kaempferol (a 4′-hydroxyflavonol) among other substrates tested. This result indicates that this novel OMT exhibits a high degree of both substrate and stereospecificity. Kinetic analysis of the partially purified ScOMT1 gave an apparent K m of 152 μmfor daphnetin and 19 μm for AdoMet. TheK m value for daphnetin is comparable withK m values reported for other OMTs (11Poulton J.E. Conn E.E. The Biochemistry of Plants. 7. Academic Press, New York1981: 667-723Google Scholar). The ScOMT1 reaction product was unambiguously identified as 7-hydroxy-8-methoxycoumarin. It gave a single product when chromatographed in a nonpolar solvent system on cellulose TLC (Fig.2 A) with a higherR F value (0.6) than that of daphnetin (0.25), suggesting the presence of a methyl group and, consequently, the reaction product elutes later (R t 26.0 min) than daphnetin (R t 19.0 min) after HPLC on a C18 Agilent column (Fig. 2 B). The enzyme reaction product coeluted with an authentic sample of 7-hydroxy-8-methoxycoumarin (R t 25.8 ± 0.5 min) on HPLC, and was well separated from the 7-methoxy-8-hydroxy isomer (R t 27.5 ± 0.4 min) (Fig.2 C). Moreover, the UV absorption maxima of the enzyme reaction product, which were identical to that of an authentic sample of 7-hydroxy-8-methoxycoumarin, is lower than that of daphnetin (λmax 265 and 330), whereas its mass is increased by 15 mass units, indicating the introduction of a methyl group into daphnetin. In addition, the chemical structure of the enzyme reaction product was verified by NOESY in comparison with the other methylated isomer, which indicates unequivocally the substitution pattern of the methoxy protons, a hydroxy proton, two aromatic protons, and two olefinic protons in both 7-hydroxy-8-methoxycoumarin and 8-hydroxy-7-methoxycoumarin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Table Isummarizes the estimated 1-qP values for PSII excitation pressure for rye plants that were grown at either 20 or 5 °C under increasing irradiance. The data demonstrate that increasing irradiance results in an increased 1-qP at both 20 and 5 °C. It is significant to note that plants grown at either 20/800 or 5/250 not only exhibited comparable 1-qP values but also displayed the highest values, thus, considered to be grown under high excitation pressure. In contrast, plants grown at either 20/250 or 5/50 exhibited a comparable low excitation pressure relative to those grown at either 20/800 or 5/250. As expected, plants grown at 20/50 exhibit the lowest 1-qP value and are considered to be grown at a very low PSII excitation pressure relative to those grown at 20/250 or 5/50. Thus, by employing an experimental design that includes plants grown at 20/50, 20/250, 20/800, 5/50, and 5/250, it may be possible to discern the individual effects of low temperature, light, and excitation pressure.Table IEffect of growth temperature and irradiance on 1-qPGrowth regime1-qP20/500.031 ± 0.00920/2500.134 ± 0.05720/8000.325 ± 0.0625/500.143 ± 0"

The rod domain is made up of 24 spectrin-like repeats and has been shown to modify the physical properties of lipid membranes. The nature of this association still remains unclear. Tryptophan residues tend to cluster at or near to the water-lipid interface of the membrane. To assess dystrophin rod domain-membrane interactions, tryptophan residues properties of two recombinant proteins of the rod domain were examined by 1The abbreviations used are: DOPC, 1,2-dioleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DOPS, 1,2-dioleyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine; DOPE, 1,2-dioleyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-ethanolamine; 6, 7-diBrPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-(6,7)-dibromo-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; 11, 12-diBrPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-(11,12)-dibromo-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; PSPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; SUVs, small unilamellar vesicles; TCE, 2,2,2-trichloroethanol; 5-DSA, 5-doxylstearic acid; 16-DSA, 16-doxylstearic acidH NMR and fluorescence techniques in the presence of membrane lipids.

By contrast, F125 (residues 439–564) is a folded compact protein. Tryptophan fluorescence quenching shows that both proteins are characterized by structural fluctuations with their tryptophan residues only slightly buried from the surface. In the presence of negatively charged small vesicles, the fluorescence characteristics of F125 change dramatically, indicating that tryptophan residues are in a more hydrophobic environment. Interestingly, these modifications are not observed with F114. Fluorescence quenching experiments confirm that tryptophan residues are shielded from the solvent in the complex F125 lipids by a close contact with lipids.

The use of membrane-bound quenchers allowed us to conclude that dystrophin rod domain lies along the membrane surface and may be involved in a structural array comprising membrane and cytoskeletal proteins as well as membrane lipids. Dystrophin is a filamentous 427-kDa protein whose deficiency is at the origin of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (1Hoffman E.P. Brown R.H. Kunkel L.M. Cell. 1987; 51: 919-928Google Scholar). The dystrophin molecule is composed of four domains: an actin-binding amino-terminal domain, a rod domain comprising 24 spectrin-like repeats, and a carboxyl-terminal end made up of cysteine-rich and dystroglycan-interacting domains anchoring the dystrophin molecule at the sarcolemma (2Koenig M. Monaco A.P. Kunkel L.M. Cell. 1988; 53: 219-226Google Scholar, 3Ervasti J. Campbell K. Cell. 1991; 66: 1121-1131Google Scholar, 4Campbell K.P. Cell. 1995; 80: 675-679Google Scholar). The amino-terminal end (5Ervasti J.M. Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Soc. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 52: 31-44Google Scholar) and a cluster of basic repeats of the rod domain (6Amann K.J. Renley B.A. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28419-28423Google Scholar) are clearly associated with F-actin, suggesting a lateral association between dystrophin and actin. All these associations point to a model of dystrophin acting as a flexible linker between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix (7Ervasti J. Campbell K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 82-87Google Scholar, 8Brown S.C. Lucy J.A. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 413-419Google Scholar, 9Rybakova I.N. Patel J.R. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1209-1214Google Scholar). However, it has also been observed that a repeat of the rod domain is able to modify the physical properties of lipid membranes containing anionic phospholipids (10DeWolf C. McCauley P. Sikorski A.F. Winlove C.P. Bailey A.I. Kahana E. Pinder J.C. Gratzer W.B. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2599-2604Google Scholar). This result is consistent with the observation that, in the muscle of patients expressing genetic variants of dystrophin lacking the carboxyl-terminal end, the truncated dystrophin is nevertheless well localized at the sarcolemma (11Hoffman E. Carlos P. Garcia A. Chamberlain J. Angelini P.C. Lupski J. Fenwick R. Ann. Neurol. 1991; 30: 605-610Google Scholar, 12Helliwell T. Ellis J. Mountford R. Appleton R. Morris G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1992; 50: 508-514Google Scholar, 13Recan D. Chafey P. Leturcq F. Hugnot J. Vincent N. Tome F. Collin H. Simon D. Czernichow P. Nicholson L. Fardeau M. Kaplan J. Chelly J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 712-716Google Scholar). It is also compatible with the evidence for the presence of several repeats and hinges of the rod domain between the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends, which is essential for a complete rescue of the dystrophic phenotype of themdx mouse (14Harper S.Q. Hauser M.A. DelloRusso C. Duan D. Crawford R.W. Phelps S.F. Harper H.A. Robinson A.S. Engelhardt J.F. Brooks S.V. Chamberlain J.S. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 253-261Google Scholar). The above studies lead to the view that the rod domain may target the dystrophin molecule onto the sarcolemma by a lateral association not only with F-actin but also with membrane phospholipids. Interactions with membrane lipids have already been reported for spectrin (15Sikorski A.F. Michalak K. Bobrowska M. Kozubek A. Studia Biophysica. 1987; 121: 183-191Google Scholar, 16Diakowski W. Prychidny A. Swistak M. Nietubyc M. Bialkowska K. Szopa J. Sikorski A.F. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 83-90Google Scholar) and have been shown to be involved in the shape regulation of the red cell membrane (17O'Toole P.J. Morrison I.E.G. Cherry R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1466: 39-46Google Scholar) and more recently in its membrane stability (18Manno S. Takakuwa Y. Mohandas N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1943-1948Google Scholar). Because spectrin and dystrophin belong to the same protein family, these results suggest a similar function for the two proteins. However, the nature of the association of the rod domain with membrane lipids is still unclear. Tryptophan (Trp) residues are often involved in the membrane lipid association of interfacial proteins (19Yau W.-M. Wimley W.C. Gawrisch K. White S.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14713-14718Google Scholar, 20Killian J.A. von Heijne G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 429-434Google Scholar, 21Clayton A.H. Sawyer W.H. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1066-1073Google Scholar). Because several tryptophan residues are present in the rod domain repeats, we investigated these tryptophan properties and accessibility in two recombinant proteins of the rod domain, both in aqueous solution and in the presence of membrane lipids. Calvert et al. (22Calvert R. Kahana E. Gratzer W.B. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1605-1610Google Scholar) have made several interesting constructs of the second repeat of the human dystrophin rod domain involving a constant amino-terminal end but with variable carboxyl-terminal ends. In the present study, we chose to investigate two of these fragments, namely, the 114- and 125-residue-long proteins. Four Trp residues are present in the 114 protein, whereas there is one extra Trp residue in the 125 fragment (10DeWolf C. McCauley P. Sikorski A.F. Winlove C.P. Bailey A.I. Kahana E. Pinder J.C. Gratzer W.B. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2599-2604Google Scholar). Although the 114 fragment does not fully fold, proteins longer than the 117 residues such as the 125 fragment are able to adopt a high percentage of α-helical content (22Calvert R. Kahana E. Gratzer W.B. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1605-1610Google Scholar, 23Kahana E. Gratzer W.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8110-8114Google Scholar). We first used 1The abbreviations used are: DOPC, 1,2-dioleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DOPS, 1,2-dioleyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine; DOPE, 1,2-dioleyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-ethanolamine; 6, 7-diBrPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-(6,7)-dibromo-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; 11, 12-diBrPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-(11,12)-dibromo-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; PSPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; SUVs, small unilamellar vesicles; TCE, 2,2,2-trichloroethanol; 5-DSA, 5-doxylstearic acid; 16-DSA, 16-doxylstearic acid H NMR spectroscopy, a technique that can give indications about the shielding of Trp residues in proteins. In addition, magnetization transfer between water and amide protons of Trp residues (24Dempsey C. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Res. Spect. 2001; 39: 135-170Google Scholar) may provide information about their respective accessibility to water. In addition, intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy of tryptophan (Trp) is a valuable tool for studying the conformation of proteins by means of time-resolved fluorescence and quenching experiments (25Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Google Scholar, 26Lakowicz J. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic, Norwell, MA1999Google Scholar, 27Wimley W.C. White S.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 161-170Google Scholar). This can provide information about the environment of the indole ring of Trp, including its charge and polarity. Comparative Trp fluorescence spectroscopy of the two fragments of dystrophin rod domain proteins having different folding states can be used to determine the status of the Trp residues in these proteins and assess the possibility of their involvement in an interaction with membrane phospholipids. Proteins with lengths of 114 (F114) and 125 (F125) 1The F125 fragment was initially assumed to be F123, as proposed by DeWolf et al. . (4Campbell K.P. Cell. 1995; 80: 675-679Google Scholar), but checking by mass spectroscopy and DNA sequence analysis showed that it is a F125 fragment, i.e. the carboxyl-terminal end is at the 564th residue of human dystrophin. residues of the second repeat of human dystrophin rod domain were prepared by expression in Escherichia coli (strain BL21(DE3)) of plasmids kindly provided by W. B. Gratzer (22Calvert R. Kahana E. Gratzer W.B. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1605-1610Google Scholar). The amino terminus is common to the two proteins and taken at the 439th residue of human dystrophin (NCBI Protein Data base NP_003997), and the C terminus ends were at the 553rd and 564th residues for F114 and F125, respectively. Trp residues are situated at positions 25, 102, 108, and 112 for F114, whereas a fifth is situated at position 123 in F125. Expressed proteins were recovered as inclusion bodies from the E. coliexpression strain and purified as described previously (28Kahana E. Marsh P.J. Henry A.J. Way M. Gratzer W.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1271-1277Google Scholar). The proteins were recovered by dispersion in 6 m guanidinium chloride, 10 mm dithiothreitol and then purified by gel chromatography in the same solvent on Sephacryl-S100. Fractions were screened by UV absorption at 280 nm and SDS-gel electrophoresis. The purified protein was kept in guanidinium chloride and dialyzed when required against the desired buffer, typically 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6 (buffer A). Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using molar extinction coefficients of 23,350 and 28,570 cm−1m−1 for F114 and F125, respectively (23Kahana E. Gratzer W.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8110-8114Google Scholar). Multilamellar vesicles were first prepared. Mixtures containing a 2:1 molar ratio of the lipids DOPC2 and DOPS or DOPE in chloroform were dried overnight under vacuum and suspended in solution A containing NaCl 150 mm, EDTA 0.1 mmbuffered with Tris-HCl (100 mm), pH 7.6. Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were prepared extemporaneously from multilamellar vesicles diluted at 25 mg/ml and subjected to sonication at room temperature with the micro-tip of a sonicator (U200S, UKA Labortechnic) for 5 min with half-duty cycles. They were then centrifuged to eliminate titanium impurities. For fluorescence quenching experiments with membrane-bound quenchers, SUVs containing 10% brominated phosphatidylcholine (BrPSPC, dibromine palmitoylstearoylphosphatidylcholine), i.e. with the composition DOPC/DOPS/BrPSPC (1.9:1:0.1, m/m), were prepared. BrPSPC is commercially available (Avanti Polar, Birmingham, AL) and brominated at either 6 and 7, or 11 and 12, of the stearoyl acyl chains. For these SUVs, sonication was reduced to 1 min to avoid degradation of the spin label (29Abrams F. London E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5312-5322Google Scholar). SUVs with 10% non-brominated PSPC were used as control. Circular dichroism was measured (Jobin-Yvon CD6) at 281 K, with a path length of 0.02 cm and at a concentration of 50 μm protein. The percentage of molar ellipticity was calculated using a 100% α-helix coefficient of −36,000 deg·cm2·dmol−1 at 222 nm (23Kahana E. Gratzer W.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8110-8114Google Scholar). 1The abbreviations used are: DOPC, 1,2-dioleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DOPS, 1,2-dioleyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine; DOPE, 1,2-dioleyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-ethanolamine; 6, 7-diBrPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-(6,7)-dibromo-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; 11, 12-diBrPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-(11,12)-dibromo-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; PSPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; SUVs, small unilamellar vesicles; TCE, 2,2,2-trichloroethanol; 5-DSA, 5-doxylstearic acid; 16-DSA, 16-doxylstearic acidH NMR spectra were acquired at 500 MHz on a Bruker DMX spectrometer (11.5 teslas) equipped with a 5-mm probe (Bruker Spectrospin, Wissembourg, France). Protein concentration was 200–500 μm in the presence of 3% D2O. Spectral width was 12 ppm, and the number of scans was 512–1024, using a repetition delay of 2 s with a 90° pulse angle. Proton decoupling sequences were used with a solvent presaturation or a WATERGATE sequence. Fourier transform was applied after a line broadening of 0.2 Hz. Chemical shifts were referenced against DSS by means of residual water resonance. Progressive magnetization transfer between water and NH protons was measured at 313 K with variable solvent presaturation delays (0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2s). The degree of magnetization transfer was estimated from the peak areas measurements. Tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra were recorded between 320 and 450 nm using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm (bandwidth, 8.4 nm) on a SPEX 112 spectrofluorometer (Jobin-Yvon, Longjumeau, France), using a 10- × 10-mm quartz cuvette at 293 K. Blanks were always subtracted in the same experimental conditions (buffer, SUVs). Fluorescence intensities were obtained by integrating the spectra in the range 320–450 nm. Quantum yields were calculated by comparing the fluorescence intensities of the proteins with a solution of dl-Trp in buffer A, corrected to the same absorption at 295 nm (i.e.the excitation wavelength). A value of 0.13 was used for the quantum yield of free Trp (26Lakowicz J. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic, Norwell, MA1999Google Scholar). Fluorescence quenching data were obtained with I− (KI), Cs+ (CsCl), 2,2,2-trichloroethanol (TCE) and acrylamide as follows: small-volume aliquots of stock solutions at 5 m of KI, CsCl, and acrylamide prepared in the protein buffer A and at 1.3m for TCE in ethylene glycol were successively added to the samples. After each addition, the solution was gently stirred and the decrease of fluorescence intensity was measured at the initial λmax. A spectrum was recorded at the end of each series to check that the quencher had no effect on the λmax of the protein. As controls, KCl and ethylene glycol were shown to have no effect on the fluorescence of the proteins. Appropriate corrections for dilution were made for these experiments. The same procedure was used for quenching experiments with 5- and 16-doxyl stearoyl acids dissolved as a 20 mm stock solution in Me2SO except that a 5-min incubation delay was allowed before data acquisition after each 1-μl addition. Effective Stern-Volmer constants (K sv) were obtained from the fluorescence data according to the Stern-Volmer equation for dynamic quenching (in which collisional quenching is mainly governed by diffusion processes) (25Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Google Scholar, 26Lakowicz J. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic, Norwell, MA1999Google Scholar), F0/F=1+Ksv[Q],with Ksv=kq⋅τ0(Eq. 1) where F 0 and F are the fluorescence intensities without and with the presence of the quencherQ, respectively, k q is the bimolecular collisional constant, and τ0 is the life time constant in the absence of quencher. In the case of dynamic quenching, we obtained a linear array of points on the plots. The Stern-Volmer constant (K sv) is derived from the slope of these plots. However, in some experiments, the plots deviated upward from linearity, and this could be explained by the existence of both static and dynamic quenching. Because of this, we used a modified Stern-Volmer equation (26Lakowicz J. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic, Norwell, MA1999Google Scholar), F0/F=(1+K[Q])expV(Q)(Eq. 2) where K is the constant for dynamic quenching and V the constant for static quenching. Concerning quenching experiments with doxyl stearic acids, which are not soluble quenchers, “apparent” Stern-Volmer constants were calculated with Equation1. Titration of the Trp fluorescence emission of F125 with increasing concentrations of SUVs was effected as follows: small-volume aliquots of stock SUVs (31 mm total lipids) were successively added to F125 1 μm in a quartz cuvette. After each addition, 15 min of incubation was allowed under gently stirring before spectrum acquisition. Fluorescence intensity was determined by integrating spectra from 320 to 450 nm. Control spectra from SUVs alone were performed under the same conditions and subtracted from the respective protein spectra. When fluorescence spectra were acquired with SUVs containing brominated phosphatidylcholine, the depth of insertion was calculated using the “parallax” analysis (29Abrams F. London E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5312-5322Google Scholar, 30Chattopadhyay A. London E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 39-45Google Scholar) with the following equation, Zcf=Lc1+[−ln(F1/F2)/πC−L122]/2L12(Eq. 3) where Z cf is the transverse distance from the plane of the bilayer center to the plane containing the Trp residues, F1 and F2, are fluorescence intensities in presence of the shallow quencher and deeper quencher, respectively,L c1 is the transverse distance from the bilayer center to the shallow quencher, L 12 is the transverse distance between the depths of the two quenchers, andC is the two-dimensional quencher concentration in the plane of the membrane in mole fraction of quencher lipid in total lipid per unit area. The values for the constants were L c1= 10.8 Å, L 12 = 4.5 Å for the distance between 6,7- and 11,12-diBrPC according to x-ray diffraction (31McIntosh T. Holloway P. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1783-1788Google Scholar);C = (0.1)/70 Å2, the average surface area of quencher (32Lewis B. Engelman D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 211-216Google Scholar). All the experimental data were fitted to the cited equations using non-linear regression analysis with Sigma-Plot software (Jandel Scientific). Fluorescence intensity decays were obtained by the time-correlated single photon counting technique from the I vv(t) andI vh(t) components recorded on the experimental setup installed on the SB1 window of the synchrotron radiation source Super-ACO (Anneau de Collision d'Orsay), which has been described elsewhere (33Vincent M. Gallay J. Demchenko A. J. Phys. Chem. 1995; 99: 14931-14941Google Scholar). The excitation wavelength was selected by a double monochromator (Jobin-Yvon UV-DH10, bandwidth 4 nm). An MCP-PMT Hamamatsu instrument (model R3809U-02) was used for the fluorescence measurements. Time resolution was around 20 ps, and the data were stored in 2048 channels. Automatic sampling cycles included 30-s accumulation time for the instrumental response function and 90-s acquisition time for each polarized component. The sampling was carried out such that a total number of 2–4 × 106 counts was attained in the fluorescence intensity decay. For measurements in the presence of SUVs, a cut-off filter (300 AELP filter, Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT) was used to minimize contamination of the fluorescence decays by scattered excitation light. Analyses of fluorescence intensity decay as exponential sums were performed by the maximum entropy method (33Vincent M. Gallay J. Demchenko A. J. Phys. Chem. 1995; 99: 14931-14941Google Scholar). The circular dichroic spectra of the purified proteins F114 and F125 measured at 281 K exhibit molar residue ellipticities at the extremum (222 nm) of −18,000 and −30,000 deg·cm2·dmol−1, respectively. This correspond to α-helicities of 50 and 83% for F114 and F125, respectively. The 1The abbreviations used are: DOPC, 1,2-dioleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DOPS, 1,2-dioleyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine; DOPE, 1,2-dioleyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-ethanolamine; 6, 7-diBrPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-(6,7)-dibromo-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; 11, 12-diBrPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-(11,12)-dibromo-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; PSPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; SUVs, small unilamellar vesicles; TCE, 2,2,2-trichloroethanol; 5-DSA, 5-doxylstearic acid; 16-DSA, 16-doxylstearic acidH NMR spectra obtained from the two proteins are shown in Fig.1. The F114 spectrum corresponds to an only partly folded protein as indicated by the unresolved signals, particularly for the NH resonances. In contrast, the F125 spectrum displays a high chemical shift dispersion that is characteristic of folded proteins. A good marker of the tertiary structure is the presence of the two high-field shifted resonances at −0.03 and −0.19 ppm, as well as the sharp proton signals between 11.5 and 9.5 ppm. These resonances, labeled 1–5, are assigned to the NH indole protons of the five Trp residues of F125. The 1The abbreviations used are: DOPC, 1,2-dioleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DOPS, 1,2-dioleyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine; DOPE, 1,2-dioleyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-ethanolamine; 6, 7-diBrPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-(6,7)-dibromo-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; 11, 12-diBrPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-(11,12)-dibromo-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; PSPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; SUVs, small unilamellar vesicles; TCE, 2,2,2-trichloroethanol; 5-DSA, 5-doxylstearic acid; 16-DSA, 16-doxylstearic acidH NMR spectra of F125 show only slight changes between 278 and 313 K (data not shown). This observation is in good agreement with the reported temperature of half denaturation of 347 K (22Calvert R. Kahana E. Gratzer W.B. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1605-1610Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the signals labeled 1–5 in Fig. 1 become modified at 313 K compared with 298 K (Fig.2). It is known that, under conditions of relatively fast exchange, hydrogen exchange rates can be measured by NMR spectroscopy to access information about the solvent accessibility and the participation of exchangeable hydrogen within hydrogen bonds (24Dempsey C. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Res. Spect. 2001; 39: 135-170Google Scholar). When using a presaturation sequence, we observe a signal decrease for several of these protons by comparison with the spectra acquired with the WATERGATE sequence (Fig. 1). This decrease of signal for some hydrogen from the NH region indicates that, at 313 K, there is an efficient magnetization transfer between water and NH protons during the presaturation delay. We therefore investigated the magnetization transfer occurring in F125 between water protons and NH protons at 313 K, using variable delays of presaturation. The results are shown in Fig. 2. It appears that there is no magnetization transfer onpeaks 1 (10.75 ppm) and 2 (10.18 ppm). By contrast, peaks 3–5 (10.12 ppm) are strongly reduced by the presaturation of water. Because peaks 1, 2, and3–5 are derived from the five Trp residues of F125, it appears that at least two Trp residues out of five show no significant exchange with water protons at 313 K and pH 7.5. We did not attempt to study the temperature dependence of the exchange with F114, because this protein is known to have a half-denaturation temperature lower than 300 K (22Calvert R. Kahana E. Gratzer W.B. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1605-1610Google Scholar). Fluorescence emission spectra acquired with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm were centered at 352 nm for F125 and at 356 nm for F114, compared with the maximum at 362 nm for a dl-Trp solution obtained in buffer A (Table I). The measured quantum yield was 0.07 and 0.05 for F114 and F125, respectively, taking a value of 0.13 for Trp in solution (34Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy.

Open table in a new tab The fluorescence decay of each protein was also observed (see Fig.3 A, for an example). The curves are different for the two proteins and could not be approximated by a single-exponential function. Using the maximum entropy method, the decays are well fitted by three lifetime populations for F125 and F114 (Fig. 3 B, upper part). Overall, average lifetimes were calculated as 1.4 and 2.2 ns for F125 and F114, respectively (Table I). These results are in good agreement with the quantum yield values and indicate that the folded state of F125 partly “buries” some Trp residues in a more hydrophobic environment than in F114. The anisotropy decays of each protein exhibited two different correlation time patterns (Fig. 3, A and B,lower part). For F125, we obtained only one correlation time at 6.8 ns (Fig. 3, lower part). This value is characteristic of Brownian mobility for a compact globular protein of the size of F125 (14.9 kDa). By contrast, we obtained three rotational correlation time peaks for F114 at 0.18, 1.4, and 5.2 ns (Fig. 3, lower part); the two shorter peaks are characteristic of the high mobility of the indole ring in the protein, whereas the longest peak is characteristic o"

Yeast overexpression of both the oxygenase and reductase domains of human eNOS,i.e. eNOSox and eNOSred, has been established to accomplish this goal. UV-visible and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectral characterization for the resting eNOSox and its complexes with various ligands indicated a standard NOS heme structure as a thiolate hemeprotein. Two low spin imidazole heme complexes but not the isolated eNOSox were resolved by EPR indicating slight difference in heme geometry of the dimeric eNOSox domain. Stoichiometric titration of eNOSox demonstrated that the heme has a capacity for a reducing equivalent of 1–1.5. Additional 1.5–2.5 reducing equivalents were consumed before heme reduction occurred indicating the presence of other unknown high potential redox centers. There is no indication for additional metal centers that could explain this extra electron capacity of eNOSox. Ferrous eNOSox, in the presence of l-arginine, is fully functional in forming the tetrahydrobiopterin radical upon mixing with oxygen as demonstrated by rapid-freeze EPR measurements. Calmodulin binds eNOSred at 1:1 stoichiometry and high affinity. Stoichiometric titration and computer simulation enabled the determination for three redox potential separations between the four half-reactions of FMN and FAD. The extinction coefficient could also be resolved for each flavin for its semiquinone, oxidized, and reduced forms at multiple wavelengths.

J. 2000; 357: 593-615Google Scholar). There are three mammalian NOS isozymes: the constitutive neuronal NOS (nNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS) require calmodulin for enzyme activity, whereas the inducible NOS (iNOS) contains tightly bound calmodulin (1Roman L.J. Martásek P. Masters B.S.S. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 1179-1189Google Scholar, 2Raman C.S. Martásek P. Masters B.S.S. Kadish K.M. Smith K.M. Guilard R. The Porphyrin Handbook.

J. 2000; 357: 593-615Google Scholar). All three isozymes have a common bi-domain structure with the reductase domain containing FAD, FMN, and NADPH binding sites, and the oxygenase domain harboring the heme center and binding sites forl-arginine and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) (1Roman L.J. Martásek P. Masters B.S.S. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 1179-1189Google Scholar, 2Raman C.S. Martásek P. Masters B.S.S. Kadish K.M. Smith K.M. Guilard R. The Porphyrin Handbook.

J. 2000; 357: 593-615Google Scholar). The main function of the reductase domain is to provide reducing equivalents to the heme center in the oxygenase domain where the key chemistry of l-arginine conversion occurs. Three substrates and four products are involved in NOS catalysis. The overall reaction is a complicated five-electron oxidation of the key guanidine nitrogen plus three additional electrons from NADPH to reduce two molecules of oxygen to water and form the l-citrulline and nitric oxide. Several x-ray crystallographic structures for the iNOS and eNOS oxygenase domains have been reported (5Raman C.S. Li H. Martásek P. Král V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 1-20Google Scholar, 6Fischmann T.O. Hruza A. Xiao D.N. Fossetta J.D. Lunn C.A. Dolphin E. Prongay A.J. Reichert P. Lundell D.J. Narula S.K. Weber P.C. Nat. Struct.

The x-ray crystallographic data at 1.9-Å resolution of the C-terminal FAD-NADPH binding domain of the nNOS reductase domain was also published recently (8Zhang J. Martásek P. Paschke R. Shea T. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37506-37513Google Scholar). These data reveal a three-domain modular design. The FAD and NADPH binding subdomains are superimposable on those of cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) with a root mean square deviation of 1.3 Å, whereas the more flexible FMN-connecting domain shows a 3.9-Å root mean square deviation to the α-chain of CPR. The fourth domain that binds FMN is lost during crystallization, but the structure is projected to be similar to that of CPR. These crystallographic data give firm support for a modular design of NOS and thus provide a basis to prepare subdomains for structure/function and reaction mechanism studies. Investigation into individual breakdown modules could simplify the data interpretation for each redox center and should be a useful approach in elucidation of the complicated reaction mechanism for NOS. Overexpression systems for the individual oxygenase and reductase domain of NOS have been developed in bacterial and baculovirus systems, including our own group (9Hurshman A.R.

Only a few are related to eNOS (6Fischmann T.O. Hruza A. Xiao D.N. Fossetta J.D. Lunn C.A. Dolphin E. Prongay A.J. Reichert P. Lundell D.J. Narula S.K. Weber P.C. Nat. Struct.

Gross S.S. Sessa W.C. Masters B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 359-365Google Scholar). Although the baculovirus system is useful (17Chen P.-F. Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14631-14635Google Scholar), it is both time-consuming and costly. The bacterial expression system (18Martásek P. Liu Q. Liu J. Roman L.J. Gross S.S. Sessa W.C. Masters B.S. Biochem.

Yeast expression could be an alternative vehicle to generate large amounts of active mammalian enzymes (19Romanos M.A. Scorer C.A. Clare J.J. Yeast. 1992; 8: 423-488Google Scholar). Yeast has been shown to be effective in overexpressing eNOS and the reductase domain of nNOS (14Gachhui R. Presta A. Bentley D.F. Abu-Soud H.M. McArthur R. Brudvig G. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

Here, we report the overexpression in yeast the oxygenase, eNOSox, and reductase, eNOSred, domains of human eNOS and the characterization for their oxidation-reduction activities. Both domains show behaviors very similar to the domains present in the whole eNOS and should be useful tools for future biophysical and mechanistic investigations. BH4 was obtained from Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). Plasmids containing human eNOS cDNA in pGEM3Z and human eNOS polyclonal antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Pei-Feng Chen in our division (21Chen P.-F. Tsai A.-L. Wu K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 1119-1129Google Scholar). PCR kits (Expand High Fidelity PCR system) were the product of Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Restriction enzyme PmeI was purchased from New England BioLabs, and the other restriction enzymes were from Invitrogen. All reagents and devices for DNA extraction and isolation were products of Qiagen. An Easyselect Pichia Expression kit, containing the expression vector pPICZB, Pichia strain GS115, and Escherichia coil strain TOP10F′, was purchased from Invitrogen and used for the expression of both eNOS domains. Reagents for electrophoresis and Western blotting were from Bio-Rad. The remaining chemicals were from Sigma. PCR was used to amplify the cDNA product. Human eNOS cDNA in pGEM3Z was used as template, and DNA fragments encoding oxygenase (amino acids 1–491) and reductase domain (amino acids 482–1204) were amplified with specific primers. For oxygenase domain, the forward primer was 5′-CGGAATTCAACATGCATCACCATCACCATCACGGCAACTTGAAGAGCGTG-3′ (translation start codon is underlined), and the backward primer was 5′-GCTCTAGATCAGGTGATGCCGGTGCCCTTGGC-3′ (translation stop codon is underlined). For reductase domain, the forward primer was 5′-CGGAATTCAACATGCATCACCATCACCATCACGGGAGTGCCGCCAAGGGC-3′, and the backward primer was 5′-GCTCTAGATCAGGGGCTGTTGGTGTCTGAGCC-3′. In both forward primers, the EcoRI site and His6 tag were added, and in each backward primer an XbaI site was added. The correct sequences of the PCR products were confirmed by primer extension sequencing. Both PCR products were double-digested with EcoRI and XbaI and subcloned separately into the corresponding sites of an alcohol oxidase promoter-driven expression vector pPICZB to obtain a 1.5-kb insert of eNOSox and a 2.1-kb insert of eNOSred. The constructs were linearized with PmeI, transformed into yeastPichia pastoris GS115, and selected by growing them on the YPDS/Zeocin plates containing 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose, 1 m sorbitol, and 100 μg/ml Zeocin. The colony that grew fastest was inoculated into 25 ml of buffered minimal glycerol medium (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base with ammonium sulfate without amino acids, 4 × 10−5% biotin and 1% glycerol) and cultured at 30 °C overnight. This culture was then transferred to a 250-ml buffered minimal glycerol medium and grown at 30 °C overnight to A 600 = 7–10. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 250 ml of buffered minimal methanol medium (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base with ammonium sulfate without amino acids, 4 × 10−5% biotin, and 0.5% methanol) and cultured for 72 h at 30 °C to induce protein expression. Yeast cells were harvested and washed with buffer 1 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) with protease inhibitors (1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm antipain, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and resuspended in an equal volume of buffer 1 with protease inhibitors. An equal volume of glass beads (425–600 μm) was added to the suspension. Cells were broken by 10 cycles of 30-s vortexing and brief chilling on ice. Cell debris and glass beads were removed by centrifugation at 3,400 rpm. The supernatant, obtained after another centrifugation at 12,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge, was applied to a 2-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column. The column was first washed with a 50-bed volume of buffer 1 plus protease inhibitors, then washed with a ∼30-bed volume of buffer 1 plus 0.3 m NaCl and 1 mml-histidine, then by a ∼20-bed volume buffer 1 plus 0.1 m NaCl and 5 mml-histidine. Finally, buffer 1 plus 40 mml-histidine was used to elute bound oxygenase domain and 100 mml-histidine for the reductase domain. The eluate was concentrated by Centriprep-50 then applied to a 10-DG column (Bio-Rad) and eluted with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 m NaCl and 10% glycerol, to remove histidine. The content of BH4, FAD, and FMN of purified eNOS domains was measured as described previously (17Chen P.-F. Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14631-14635Google Scholar, 21Chen P.-F. Tsai A.-L. Wu K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 1119-1129Google Scholar) and quantified from a standard curve of authentic BH4, FAD, or FMN, respectively. Biopterin determination was done on eNOSox with or without reconstitution with exogenous BH4. BH4reconstitution was done similarly to procedures that were published previously (9Hurshman A.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3439-3456Google Scholar, 22Rusche K.M. Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 421-427Google Scholar) under anaerobic condition. The excess amount of BH4 was removed by gel filtration, and the amount of bound BH4 was determined using our HPLC quantitation similar to the published procedure using authentic BH4 to build a standard curve (23Lunte C.E. Kissinger P.T. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 129: 377-386Google Scholar). Heme content was determined by the formation of pyridine hemochromogen as previously described (24Berka V. Palmer G. Chen P.-F. Tsai A.-L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6136-6144Google Scholar). The total heme content was determined from difference spectrum of bis-pyridine heme (reduced minus oxidized) using Δε556–538 nm = 24 mm−1cm−1. Surface-exposed thiol groups were determined by chemical modification using 4,4′-dithiopyridine to form a 4-thiopyridone chromophore with major absorbance at 343 nm. The 4,4′-dithiopyridine itself has almost no absorption at that wavelength (25Grassetti D.R. Murray Jr., J.F. J. Chromatogr. 1996; 41: 121-123Google Scholar). Cytochrome creductase activity was measured as the absorbance increase at 550 nm using Δε = 21 mm−1 cm−1as described previously (17Chen P.-F. Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14631-14635Google Scholar). Ferricyanide or 2,6-dichlorophenol indolphenol oxidation assay was carried out using Δε = 1 mm−1 cm−1 at 400 nm and Δε = 21 mm−1 cm−1 at 600 nm, respectively (14Gachhui R. Presta A. Bentley D.F. Abu-Soud H.M. McArthur R. Brudvig G. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20594-20602Google Scholar). This activity measurement essentially followed previous published procedure for iNOSox (26Hurshman A.R. Krebs C. Edmondson D.E. Huynh B.H. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15689-15696Google Scholar, 27Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Wang Q. Meade A.L. Hemann C. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 315-319Google Scholar). High concentration of BH4-reconstituted eNOSox was reduced anaerobically in a tonometer by dithionite titration in the presence of 1 mm l-arginine. The ferrous eNOSox was then reacted with oxygenated buffer using a rapid-freeze/EPR technique as we previously published (28Tsai A.-L. Wu G. Palmer G. Bambai B. Koehn J.A. Marshall P.J. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21695-21700Google Scholar, 34Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Kulmacz R.J. Wu G. Palmer G. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 264: 165-171Google Scholar). The rapid-freeze apparatus, System 1000 (Update Instrument, Madison, WI), was placed inside an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory). The oxygen level was lower than 5 ppm during the whole experiment procedure and monitored by an oxygen/hydrogen analyzer (Model 10, Coy Laboratory). One or two push programs were used to obtain samples freeze-trapped at different reaction times. UV-visible spectra were measured on an HP8453 diode array spectrophotometer with a 1-nm spectral bandwidth. EPR results were recorded at liquid helium or liquid nitrogen temperature on a Bruker EMX EPR spectrometer. For liquid helium system, a GFS600 transfer line and an ITC503 temperature controller were used to maintain the temperature. An Oxford ESR900 cryostat was used to accommodate the sample. For liquid nitrogen transfer, a silver-coated double-jacketed glass transfer line and a BVT3000 temperature controller were used. Data analysis was conducted using WinEPR, and spectral simulations were done using SimFonia programs provided by Bruker. Flavin fluorescence was measured using an SLM SPF-500C spectrofluorometer using the ratio mode. About 2 μmeNOSred in a 1-cm quartz cuvette was excited at 450 nm (5-nm spectral bandwidth), and the emission spectrum between 450 and 650 nm (7.5-nm spectral bandwidth) was collected at 24 °C. The redox capacities of eNOSred and eNOSox were determined by anaerobic stoichiometric titration using sodium dithionite. Stock solution of sodium dithionite was freshly prepared by dissolving powdered reagent in 50 mm, pH 8.2 pyrophosphate buffer pre-saturated with pure nitrogen gas. The concentration of sodium dithionite was standardized by titration against a fixed amount of lumiflavin-3-acetic acid (ε444 = 1.08 × 104m−1cm−1) anaerobically before and after individual real sample titration (29Foust G.P. Burleigh Jr., B.D. Mayhew S.G. Williams D.H. Massey V. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 530-535Google Scholar). The average concentration was used to calculate the number of reducing equivalents consumed in the titrations. Each protein sample was placed in an anaerobic titrator and made anaerobic by 5 cycles of evacuation (30 s) and argon replacement (5 min). Standardized dithionite solution contained in a gas-tight syringe engaged to the side arm of the titrator was quantitatively delivered and mixed with the protein sample under argon atmosphere. The electronic spectrum was recorded on an HP8452 diode array spectrophotometer to confirm that the system was equilibrated after each addition of dithionite reflected by a static absorbance. The protein content was determined by BCA method (30Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed on 10% Ready-Gels in a Bio-Rad mini-gel apparatus. Gel filtration chromatography was performed on a Sephacryl 200 HR column (1.5 × 50 cm). A kit for molecular weight 12,000–200,000 (product code: MW-GF-200) was used as the gel filtration marker. The SCoP program (Simulation Resources Inc., Redlands, CA) was used for simulating the data obtained from stoichiometric titration, mainly the eNOSred similar to the method used by Iyanagi et al. (31Iyanagi T. Makino N. Mason H.S. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 1701-1710Google Scholar). The absorbance changes at different monitoring wavelengths during titration were simulated against accumulated reducing equivalents added, Aλ=ɛ1×F1+ɛ2×F1H+ɛ3×F1H2+ɛ4×F2+ɛ5×F2H+ɛ6×F2H2(Eq. 1) where A λ is the observed absorbance at wavelength λ, and ε1 through ε6 are the extinction coefficients for each flavin redox species (F1, F1H, and F1H2 represent fully oxidized, semiquinone, and fully reduced forms of the first flavin, respectively, and F2, F2H, and F2H2 are the equivalents for the second flavin). The concentrations of each flavin intermediate during a stoichiometric titration are expressed as follows, F1=[(x1×x2)/(1+x2+x1+x2)]×f1(Eq. 2) F1H=[x2/(1+x2+x1×x2)]×f1(Eq. 3) F1H2=[1/(1+x2+x1×x2)]×f1(Eq. 4) F2=[(x3×x4)/(1+x4+x3×x4)]×f2(Eq. 5) F2H=[x4/(1+x4+x3×x4)]×f2(Eq. 6) F2H2=[1/(1+x4+x3×x4)]×f2(Eq. 7) where f1 and f2 are the total amounts of each flavin and, x1=exp{[F/(R×T)]×(Eh–E1)}(Eq. 8) x2=exp{[F/(R×T)]×(Eh–E2)}(Eq. 9) x3=exp{[F/(R×T)]×(Eh–E3)}(Eq. 10) x4=exp{[F/(R×T)]×(Eh–E4)}(Eq. 11) where E1 through E4 are midpoint potentials of the four half-reactions of the two flavins in eNOSred, Eh is any measured redox potential value, F is the Faraday constant (96,485 Coulomb mol−1), R is the gas constant (8.314 J K−1mol−1), and T is temperature (298 K). The total reducing equivalents were simply expressed as, Equivalents=2×[(F1H+2×F1H2+F2H+2×F2H2)/ft](Eq. 12) Where f t is the total flavin,i.e. the sum of f1 and f2. Simulation was generated by sweeping the Eh values in any desired potential range and seeking optimal values forE1–E4 to achieve the best fit to the observed data. It is not possible to achieve a set of absolute midpoint potentials, but the relative midpoint potential values can be converged. In other words, once one of the E1–E4 values is fixed, the other three can be located by simulation. Absorbance extinction coefficients for the fully oxidized and fully reduced flavins are readily available, and those for the flavin semiquinone can be properly estimated from the spectrum at the stage of one- and three-electron-reduced states. We also let these two coefficients be variable in a narrow range and optimized their values via simulation. The yeast expression vector containing the AOX promoter is promising in overexpressing both domains of eNOS in P. pastoris. By introducing a His6 tag in the N terminus of both domains, purification of the target protein can be conveniently done by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column chromatography. The average yields of the purified oxygenase domain and the reductase domain are ∼8 and ∼22 mg/liter, respectively. Both purified eNOSoxand eNOSred resulted in a single band on SDS-PAGE with apparent molecular masses of 54 and 82 kDa, respectively (Fig.1 A) and exhibited immunoreactivity with polyclonal antibodies against eNOS (Fig.1 B). The heme content determined by pyridine hemochromogen assay was 0.93 ± 0.04 (n = 7), almost stoichiometric to the protein subunit (Table I). Replenishing hemin or δ-aminolevulinic acid to the cell medium during yeast growth did not further increase the heme content in purified eNOSox. The purified oxygenase domain also contained endogenous biopterin at a stoichiometry lower than 0.3/monomer. Because our sample buffers did not include dithiothreitol, most of these biopterin molecules were present as dihydrobiopterin, BH2, as analyzed by our HPLC method (data not shown). The functional form of biopterin, BH4, can be reconstituted back to the purified eNOSox according to the anaerobic procedure similar to that described by Rusche and Marletta (22Rusche K.M. Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 421-427Google Scholar). The reconstituted eNOSox has biopterin content as high as 0.72 per monomer (Table I) and is present as the fully reduced form, BH4, as analyzed by our HPLC method (data not shown).Table IStoichiometry of the cofactors of purified eNOS subdomains (n = 7)HemeFADFMNBH40.93 ± 0.04aThis study, for eNOSox.1.0 ± 0.33bThis study, for eNOSred.1.14 ± 0.21bThis study, for eNOSred.0.72 ± 0.12aThis study, for eNOSox.0.85 ± 0.09 (A 398)cData from Ref. 20, determined for whole eNOS.0.56 ± 0.060.79 ± 0.08NDdND, not determined.0.71 ± 0.02 (HPLC)a This study, for eNOSox.b This study, for eNOSred.c Data from Ref. 20Leber A.

Open table in a new tab The content of both FAD and FMN in purified eNOSred is essentially stoichiometric based on our HPLC determination against authentic FAD and FMN standards (Table I). The ratios of FAD and FMN to that of the eNOSred monomer are 1.0 and 1.14, respectively, thus further reconstitution of flavins is unnecessary. UV-visible spectral analyses from 250 to 700 nm of purified eNOSox showed a Soret peak at 400–404 nm, 81 mm−1cm−1, a broad α/β band at 518 nm, 15.4 mm−1cm−1, and a charge-transfer band at 645 nm, 5.8 mm−1cm−1. Treatment withl-arginine shifted the Soret peak to 396 nm with comparable amplitude, 82 mm−1cm−1, and only slight changes in the visible region (Fig.2). When eNOSox was reduced by dithionite, the Soret band is red-shifted to 413 nm with a sizable decrease in intensity, 66.7 mm−1cm−1. The α/β band also shifted to 552 nm, 13.0 mm−1cm−1, and the charge-transfer band at about 650 nm was abolished as the lower lying three metal d-orbitals were completely filled. Further addition of CO resulted in the hallmark 444-nm Soret band for P450 hemeproteins with an extinction of 91.3 mm−1cm−1 with the features found at the visible region very similar to that of ferrous eNOSox. These spectral behaviors are very similar to our bacterial-expressed eNOSox and other NOS oxygenase domains (9Hurshman A.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3439-3456Google Scholar, 13Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 801-807Google Scholar, 17Chen P.-F. Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14631-14635Google Scholar). The ratio of 280 nm to the Soret peak to either the resting or l-arginine-treated eNOSox was ∼1.5, which is an index of the purity of the hemeprotein and is a reliable number compared with other NOS preparations (9Hurshman A.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3439-3456Google Scholar, 13Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 801-807Google Scholar,17Chen P.-F. Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14631-14635Google Scholar). Liquid helium temperature EPR of the resting eNOSox showed a mixture of high spin and low spin heme structures (Fig.3, spectrum A). The rhombic high spin heme has g values of 7.53, 4.23, and 1.83 (theg min was only observable at somewhat lower temperature, ∼ 4 K), and the low spin heme show conspicuous rhombicg values at 2.43, 2.28, and 1.90. Both sets of parameters are typical for NOS and other P450 type hemeproteins containing a cysteine thiolate proximal heme ligand (32Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20547-20550Google Scholar, 33Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Chen P.-F. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32563-32571Google Scholar). Addition of excess amounts of l-arginine essentially wiped out the low spin heme signals and substantially increased the high spin heme signals (Fig. 3, spectrum B). The g values of the high spin heme shifted to 7.56, 4.17, and 1.82, corresponding to a small rhombicity shift from 20.6 to 21.1%. On the other hand, imidazole converted eNOSox to fully low spin heme complex (Fig. 3,spectrum C). There are two well-resolved rhombic low spin heme complexes with g values of 2.71/2.29/1.75 and 2.60/2.29/1.81. Resolution in the EPR spectrum of the two imidazole low spin heme was even better than that found for whole eNOS (33Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Chen P.-F. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32563-32571Google Scholar). To determine the redox capacity of the purified eNOSox, a stoichiometric"
https://openalex.org/W1978406948,"Eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II is a dimeric nuclear enzyme essential for DNA metabolism and chromosome dynamics. It changes the topology of DNA by coupling binding and hydrolysis of two ATP molecules to the transport of one DNA duplex through a temporary break introduced in another. During this process the structurally and functionally complex enzyme passes through a cascade of conformational changes, which requires intra- and intersubunit communication. To study the importance of ATP binding and hydrolysis in relation to DNA strand transfer, we have purified and characterized a human topoisomerase IIα heterodimer with only one ATP binding site. The heterodimer was able to relax supercoiled DNA, although less efficiently than the wild type enzyme. It furthermore possessed a functional N-terminal clamp and was sensitive to ICRF-187. This demonstrates that human topoisomerase IIα can pass through all the conformations required for DNA strand passage and enzyme resetting with binding and hydrolysis of only one ATP. However, the heterodimer lacked the normal stimulatory effect of DNA on ATP binding and hydrolysis as well as the stimulatory effect of ATP on DNA cleavage. The results can be explained in a model, where efficient catalysis requires an extensive communication between the second ATP and the DNA segment to be cleaved.

However, the heterodimer lacked the normal stimulatory effect of DNA on ATP binding and hydrolysis as well as the stimulatory effect of ATP on DNA cleavage. The results can be explained in a model, where efficient catalysis requires an extensive communication between the second ATP and the DNA segment to be cleaved. DNA topoisomerase II is a multifunctional and highly complex enzyme, which uses the energy of ATP to resolve topological problems generated during DNA metabolic processes, including DNA replication, transcription, and recombination (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Google Scholar, 2Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Google Scholar). Beyond these functions, topoisomerase II is an abundant component of the mitotic chromosome scaffold (3Strick R. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1995; 83: 1137-1148Google Scholar), and it alleviates constraints in the DNA during chromosome segregation and condensation (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Google Scholar).To preserve the topological integrity of the genome, the dimeric topoisomerase II enzyme strictly controls the passage of one duplex DNA (the T-segment) through another duplex (the G-segment) coordinately cleaved by the enzyme. ATP is required during the process to drive the enzyme through a series of conformations, which are essential to topoisomerase II catalysis.During the last years, extensive research has provided valuable information about the usage of ATP during the reaction pathway of topoisomerase II, but still several steps in this highly complex process remain to be unraveled. A study of the ATP consumption in yeast topoisomerase II has indicated that a tight coupling exists between ATP utilization and DNA transport under unsaturated ATP concentrations (5Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8096-8104Google Scholar). However, a human topoisomerase II enzyme lacking amino acids 350–407 at the interface between the ATPase and the cleavage/ligation domain was unable to perform strand passage, although ATPase and cleavage activities were intact (6Bjergbaek L. Kingma P. Nielsen I.S. Wang Y. Westergaard O. Osheroff N. Andersen A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13041-13048Google Scholar). These results indicate that correct interdomain communication as well as signaling of ATP binding and hydrolysis to the rest of the enzyme are essential for the coupling of ATP consumption and DNA transport.The binding of ATP is cooperative in the presence of DNA (5Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8096-8104Google Scholar) and is thought to be stimulated by the binding of the G-segment (7Morris S.K. Harkins T.T. Tennyson R.B. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3446-3452Google Scholar). A study of a yeast topoisomerase II heterodimer having only one ATP binding site has demonstrated that conformational changes are induced in the entire enzyme upon ATP binding, because the enzyme was still able to trap circular DNA by closing the N-terminal clamp. This indicates that allosteric communication exists between the two enzyme subunits (8Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 749-750Google Scholar). Together with results obtained from studies employing nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues (9Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Google Scholar, 10Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9944-9950Google Scholar), this initially led to the assumption that ATP binding triggers the conformational changes needed for one DNA transport event, whereas ATP hydrolysis and product release are exclusively coupled to enzyme resetting (4Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Google Scholar).However, recent discoveries employing rapid quench techniques and pre-steady-state analysis of ATP hydrolysis in the yeast enzyme have revealed that hydrolysis of the two ATP molecules occurs sequentially with one of the two ATP molecules being rapidly hydrolyzed before the rate determining step in the reaction cycle (11Harkins T.T. Lewis T.J. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7299-7312Google Scholar). This sequential hydrolysis is explained in terms of a model, where hydrolysis of one ATP precedes and accelerates transport of the T-segment, although the reaction can occur in the absence of hydrolysis (12Baird C.L. Harkins T.T. Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13685-13690Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of the first ATP and release of Pi and ADP are supposed to induce conformational changes in the N-terminal ATPase region of the enzyme, which are transmitted to the central DNA cleavage/ligation domain, where large rotations are proposed to form a gate in the cleaved G-segment to allow transport of the T-segment. This conformational cascade is predicted to occur in both subunits, such that the enzyme maintains structural symmetry, despite the different nucleotide bound states of the two subunits (4Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Google Scholar, 12Baird C.L. Harkins T.T. Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13685-13690Google Scholar). Investigations of a yeast topoisomerase II heterodimer, which hydrolyzes only one of the two bound ATP molecules, have shown that this enzyme is able to perform DNA strand passage at the same rate as the wild type enzyme, although resetting of the enzyme is delayed, probably due to the bound unhydrolyzed ATP, which keeps the clamp closed. Based on these results, it has been hypothesized that the second hydrolysis event and the subsequent product release are linked to resetting of the enzyme (12Baird C.L. Harkins T.T. Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13685-13690Google Scholar). However, it is still unknown to what extend binding of the second ATPper se influences the individual steps in the catalytic cycle.To investigate the coupling of ATP binding and hydrolysis to DNA strand passage and enzyme resetting, a human topoisomerase IIα heterodimer, constructed to bind only one ATP, has been purified and characterized. The results obtained with the heterodimer demonstrate that topoisomerase II can perform strand passage and resetting with only one ATP bound and hydrolyzed. However, the second ATP molecule facilitates interdomain communication, especially between the N-terminal ATP binding region and the central cleavage/ligation domain and is thus important for efficient catalysis.DISCUSSIONThe current mechanistic model of topoisomerase II catalysis involves a complex sequential mechanism of ATP hydrolysis, where binding and hydrolysis of ATP drive the enzyme through a series of conformations. Whereas hydrolysis of one ATP is thought to accelerate transport of the T-segment through a gate formed upon cleavage of the G-segment, it is presently unclear how the second ATP is correlated to the remaining steps of the catalytic cycle, although a connection to the resetting of the enzyme has been suggested (11Harkins T.T. Lewis T.J. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7299-7312Google Scholar, 12Baird C.L. Harkins T.T. Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13685-13690Google Scholar). In the present study we have investigated the coupling between ATP binding/hydrolysis and DNA strand passage/resetting by studying a human topoisomerase IIα heterodimer, G164I/wt, constructed to bind ATP in only one of the two subunits.Investigation of the enzyme having the G164I mutation in both subunits showed that it was unable to bind and hydrolyze ATP, demonstrating that Gly-164 is essential for ATP interaction in human topoisomerase IIα. Based on this, we assume that the heterodimer only binds and hydrolyzes one ATP molecule, although we cannot exclude the possibility that a second ATP molecule binds to the wild type subunit in the heterodimer upon hydrolysis of the first ATP. In this case a second ATP could contribute to the driving force for one catalytic cycle.The amino acid residue mutated in G164I/wt is located in the highly conserved Walker A motif, which is a glycine-rich region found in the ATP binding domain of all known type II topoisomerases (29O'Dea M.H. Tamura J.K. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9723-9729Google Scholar). Assuming that the ATP binding domain folds into a structure similar to the one formed in gyrase B, Gly-164 would be located on a flexible loop of the Walker A motif. This motif is in close contact with another loop, which extends from an enzyme domain located further toward the cleavage/ligation domain. Both loops contact the γ-phosphate of the bound nucleotide as revealed from the crystal structure of gyrase B (18Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Google Scholar), and in this way information regarding the nucleotide bound state of the enzyme could be transmitted to the central domain. In a recent report on yeast topoisomerase II, it has been suggested that release of the γ-phosphate from the first ATP hydrolysis event triggers conformational changes associated with DNA transport. Such a model predicts that conformational changes in the two subunits rely on a signal initiated in only one subunit (30Baird C.L. Gordon M.S. Andrenyak D.M. Marecek J.F. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27893-27898Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that human topoisomerase IIα still mediates DNA relaxation with only one ATP bound and hydrolyzed, in support of this model. In agreement with the relaxation data, our G164I/wt heterodimer was found to close the N-terminal clamp properly, demonstrating that binding of one ATP induces a conformational change in both subunits leading to dimerization of the N-terminal arms. These findings correlate with results obtained with the yeast homologue, which also possessed a normal clamp-closing activity, although ATP binding only occurred in one subunit (8Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 749-750Google Scholar).The ability of G164I/wt to perform clamp closure was further manifested through its sensitivity to the bisdioxopiperazine ICRF-187. Recent data have indicated that ATP binding is required for efficient binding of bisdioxopiperazines to the enzyme (25Morris S.K. Baird C.L. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2613-2618Google Scholar). In fact, investigations performed by Lindsley and coworkers have suggested that bisdioxopiperazines bind to the enzyme-ADP complex after hydrolysis of both ATPs and after dissociation of the products of the first hydrolysis (25Morris S.K. Baird C.L. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2613-2618Google Scholar). The sensitivity of G164I/wt to ICRF-187 predicts that binding and hydrolysis of only one ATP induce a specific conformation in the N-terminal clamp, where binding of the drug is possible. This suggests that the N-terminal conformation adopted by the G164I/wt heterodimer after hydrolysis of the first ATP at a point becomes similar to the conformation attained by the wild type enzyme after hydrolysis of the second ATP.The ability of G164I/wt to perform more than stoichiometric relaxation demonstrates that the enzyme is able to go through successive catalytic cycles. Binding and hydrolysis of only one ATP molecule is therefore sufficient for resetting of the enzyme, although we cannot exclude that the decreased relaxation activity observed with the heterodimer to some extent is caused by a less efficient resetting. However, the lack of DNA-stimulated ATP binding and hydrolysis and the lack of ATP-stimulated DNA cleavage observed in the heterodimer demonstrate that steps in the catalytic cycle prior to the resetting event are affected, when the second ATP is inhibited from binding. Thus, although the clamp closing data suggest that the intersubunit communication is retained in the N-terminal region, lack of a second ATP seems to influence the intrasubunit communication at least between the ATP binding region and the central cleavage/ligation domain.Studies of a yeast topoisomerase II mutant lacking cleavage activity have indicated that DNA stimulation of the ATP binding rate is primarily mediated through G-segment binding, and it has been suggested that binding of the T-segment might be required to obtain full stimulation of ATP hydrolysis (7Morris S.K. Harkins T.T. Tennyson R.B. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3446-3452Google Scholar). Additionally, investigation of wild type human topoisomerase IIα using DNA fragments of different lengths have revealed that stimulation of the ATPase rate may be dependent upon both G- and T-segment binding (28Hammonds T.R. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32696-32703Google Scholar). According to these results, an impaired ability to bind either of the two DNA duplexes could cause the DNA-independent ATP binding and hydrolysis activities observed by G164I/wt. However, the cleavage results showed that the mutation at Gly-164 did not affect the intrinsic cleavage activity, indicating that the mutant binds the G-segment normally. The relaxation data further demonstrated that the enzyme is able to capture a T-segment. Thus, it seems unlikely that the inability of DNA to stimulate the ATP binding and hydrolysis activities of the heterodimer are caused by impaired DNA interactions. It is, however, more likely that the stimulatory effect of DNA on ATP binding is normally exerted through binding of the second ATP after clamp closure, which would correlate with the earlier observation that ATP binding in topoisomerase II is cooperative only in the presence of DNA (5Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8096-8104Google Scholar). In that case we would not expect any DNA stimulation of ATP binding in G164I/wt.Like ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis in G164I/wt is unaffected by DNA binding, and the enzyme does not show the normal stimulatory effect of ATP on DNA cleavage. When topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage is performed in the presence of ATP or an ATP analogue, the DNA cleavage/ligation equilibrium is normally shifted toward cleavage. This shift has been suggested to result from a delay in the ligation reaction due to formation of a transient gate in the cleaved G-segment that can accommodate T-segment transport (10Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9944-9950Google Scholar, 31Robinson M.J. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2511-2515Google Scholar). However, the heterodimer lacked the stimulatory effect of ATP on cleavage complex formation, although the active site tyrosines were able to move apart to allow transport of the T-segment. Based on these results, binding of the second ATP molecule could be required for stabilization of a gate already formed upon binding of the first ATP, or it could influence the rate of cleavage per se. Alternatively, if signaling between the ATP binding domain and the cleavage/ligation domain requires a functional interaction between the two ATP binding sites, the stimulatory effect of the nucleotide on cleavage could be abolished in the heterodimer.Cleavage might indirectly be related to a DNA-dependent stimulation of ATP hydrolysis. This has been suggested earlier from studies with yeast topoisomerase II, where an active site mutant unable to perform DNA cleavage was found to have a decreased rate of ATP hydrolysis in the presence of DNA. The data were explained by an inability of the mutant enzyme to adopt a specific cleavage conformation needed for the stimulatory effect of DNA on ATP hydrolysis or by an inability of the enzyme to interact properly with the T-segment, thus causing a decreased ATP hydrolysis (7Morris S.K. Harkins T.T. Tennyson R.B. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3446-3452Google Scholar). In the G164I/wt heterodimer, ATP hydrolysis is unaffected by DNA, although the heterodimer can trap a T-segment. It is therefore more likely that binding of the second ATP molecule, either directly or indirectly, is necessary for the ability of DNA to stimulate the rate of ATP hydrolysis at least of the first ATP molecule. Such a coupling between binding of the second ATP and hydrolysis of the first would seem natural, because it would place the different events in the correct order, ensuring that G-segment binding and cleavage have occurred before ATP hydrolysis allows T-segment transport.Together, our data can be explained in a model in which the catalytic cycle begins with binding of a G-segment and one ATP molecule to the enzyme. Binding of the first ATP will lead to clamp closure and consequently trapping of a T-segment. After clamp closure the G-segment will facilitate binding of another ATP molecule. This ATP could now stimulate G-segment cleavage or stabilize the gate in the G-segment. Either through this event or via the T-segment the second ATP will stimulate hydrolysis of the first ATP molecule, which will force the T-segment through the subunit interface and the gate in the G-segment. Because DNA ligation is favored over cleavage in the normal cleavage/ligation equilibrium, the gate in the G-segment might be passively ligated following strand passage. At this step, the T-segment needs to be expelled through the primary dimerization region, and the enzyme subsequently resets with opening of the N-terminal clamp. Either one or both of these events might be facilitated by hydrolysis of the second ATP. Although the precise details of some of these steps are not yet known, it is clear from the present study that binding of a second ATP is not essential for DNA transfer and enzyme resetting but exerts an important function in the communication between the N-terminal ATPase domain and the cleavage/ligation domain to promote efficient catalysis. DNA topoisomerase II is a multifunctional and highly complex enzyme, which uses the energy of ATP to resolve topological problems generated during DNA metabolic processes, including DNA replication, transcription, and recombination (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Google Scholar, 2Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Google Scholar). Beyond these functions, topoisomerase II is an abundant component of the mitotic chromosome scaffold (3Strick R. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1995; 83: 1137-1148Google Scholar), and it alleviates constraints in the DNA during chromosome segregation and condensation (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Google Scholar). To preserve the topological integrity of the genome, the dimeric topoisomerase II enzyme strictly controls the passage of one duplex DNA (the T-segment) through another duplex (the G-segment) coordinately cleaved by the enzyme. ATP is required during the process to drive the enzyme through a series of conformations, which are essential to topoisomerase II catalysis. During the last years, extensive research has provided valuable information about the usage of ATP during the reaction pathway of topoisomerase II, but still several steps in this highly complex process remain to be unraveled. A study of the ATP consumption in yeast topoisomerase II has indicated that a tight coupling exists between ATP utilization and DNA transport under unsaturated ATP concentrations (5Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8096-8104Google Scholar). However, a human topoisomerase II enzyme lacking amino acids 350–407 at the interface between the ATPase and the cleavage/ligation domain was unable to perform strand passage, although ATPase and cleavage activities were intact (6Bjergbaek L. Kingma P. Nielsen I.S. Wang Y. Westergaard O. Osheroff N. Andersen A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13041-13048Google Scholar). These results indicate that correct interdomain communication as well as signaling of ATP binding and hydrolysis to the rest of the enzyme are essential for the coupling of ATP consumption and DNA transport. The binding of ATP is cooperative in the presence of DNA (5Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8096-8104Google Scholar) and is thought to be stimulated by the binding of the G-segment (7Morris S.K. Harkins T.T. Tennyson R.B. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3446-3452Google Scholar). A study of a yeast topoisomerase II heterodimer having only one ATP binding site has demonstrated that conformational changes are induced in the entire enzyme upon ATP binding, because the enzyme was still able to trap circular DNA by closing the N-terminal clamp. This indicates that allosteric communication exists between the two enzyme subunits (8Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 749-750Google Scholar). Together with results obtained from studies employing nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues (9Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Google Scholar, 10Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9944-9950Google Scholar), this initially led to the assumption that ATP binding triggers the conformational changes needed for one DNA transport event, whereas ATP hydrolysis and product release are exclusively coupled to enzyme resetting (4Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Google Scholar). However, recent discoveries employing rapid quench techniques and pre-steady-state analysis of ATP hydrolysis in the yeast enzyme have revealed that hydrolysis of the two ATP molecules occurs sequentially with one of the two ATP molecules being rapidly hydrolyzed before the rate determining step in the reaction cycle (11Harkins T.T. Lewis T.J. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7299-7312Google Scholar). This sequential hydrolysis is explained in terms of a model, where hydrolysis of one ATP precedes and accelerates transport of the T-segment, although the reaction can occur in the absence of hydrolysis (12Baird C.L. Harkins T.T. Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13685-13690Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of the first ATP and release of Pi and ADP are supposed to induce conformational changes in the N-terminal ATPase region of the enzyme, which are transmitted to the central DNA cleavage/ligation domain, where large rotations are proposed to form a gate in the cleaved G-segment to allow transport of the T-segment. This conformational cascade is predicted to occur in both subunits, such that the enzyme maintains structural symmetry, despite the different nucleotide bound states of the two subunits (4Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Google Scholar, 12Baird C.L. Harkins T.T. Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13685-13690Google Scholar). Investigations of a yeast topoisomerase II heterodimer, which hydrolyzes only one of the two bound ATP molecules, have shown that this enzyme is able to perform DNA strand passage at the same rate as the wild type enzyme, although resetting of the enzyme is delayed, probably due to the bound unhydrolyzed ATP, which keeps the clamp closed. Based on these results, it has been hypothesized that the second hydrolysis event and the subsequent product release are linked to resetting of the enzyme (12Baird C.L. Harkins T.T. Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13685-13690Google Scholar). However, it is still unknown to what extend binding of the second ATPper se influences the individual steps in the catalytic cycle. To investigate the coupling of ATP binding and hydrolysis to DNA strand passage and enzyme resetting, a human topoisomerase IIα heterodimer, constructed to bind only one ATP, has been purified and characterized. The results obtained with the heterodimer demonstrate that topoisomerase II can perform strand passage and resetting with only one ATP bound and hydrolyzed. However, the second ATP molecule facilitates interdomain communication, especially between the N-terminal ATP binding region and the central cleavage/ligation domain and is thus important for efficient catalysis. DISCUSSIONThe current mechanistic model of topoisomerase II catalysis involves a complex sequential mechanism of ATP hydrolysis, where binding and hydrolysis of ATP drive the enzyme through a series of conformations. Whereas hydrolysis of one ATP is thought to accelerate transport of the T-segment through a gate formed upon cleavage of the G-segment, it is presently unclear how the second ATP is correlated to the remaining steps of the catalytic cycle, although a connection to the resetting of the enzyme has been suggested (11Harkins T.T. Lewis T.J. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7299-7312Google Scholar, 12Baird C.L. Harkins T.T. Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13685-13690Google Scholar). In the present study we have investigated the coupling between ATP binding/hydrolysis and DNA strand passage/resetting by studying a human topoisomerase IIα heterodimer, G164I/wt, constructed to bind ATP in only one of the two subunits.Investigation of the enzyme having the G164I mutation in both subunits showed that it was unable to bind and hydrolyze ATP, demonstrating that Gly-164 is essential for ATP interaction in human topoisomerase IIα. Based on this, we assume that the heterodimer only binds and hydrolyzes one ATP molecule, although we cannot exclude the possibility that a second ATP molecule binds to the wild type subunit in the heterodimer upon hydrolysis of the first ATP. In this case a second ATP could contribute to the driving force for one catalytic cycle.The amino acid residue mutated in G164I/wt is located in the highly conserved Walker A motif, which is a glycine-rich region found in the ATP binding domain of all known type II topoisomerases (29O'Dea M.H. Tamura J.K. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9723-9729Google Scholar). Assuming that the ATP binding domain folds into a structure similar to the one formed in gyrase B, Gly-164 would be located on a flexible loop of the Walker A motif. This motif is in close contact with another loop, which extends from an enzyme domain located further toward the cleavage/ligation domain. Both loops contact the γ-phosphate of the bound nucleotide as revealed from the crystal structure of gyrase B (18Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Google Scholar), and in this way information regarding the nucleotide bound state of the enzyme could be transmitted to the central domain. In a recent report on yeast topoisomerase II, it has been suggested that release of the γ-phosphate from the first ATP hydrolysis event triggers conformational changes associated with DNA transport. Such a model predicts that conformational changes in the two subunits rely on a signal initiated in only one subunit (30Baird C.L. Gordon M.S. Andrenyak D.M. Marecek J.F. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27893-27898Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that human topoisomerase IIα still mediates DNA relaxation with only one ATP bound and hydrolyzed, in support of this model. In agreement with the relaxation data, our G164I/wt heterodimer was found to close the N-terminal clamp properly, demonstrating that binding of one ATP induces a conformational change in both subunits leading to dimerization of the N-terminal arms. These findings correlate with results obtained with the yeast homologue, which also possessed a normal clamp-closing activity, although ATP binding only occurred in one subunit (8Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 749-750Google Scholar).The ability of G164I/wt to perform clamp closure was further manifested through its sensitivity to the bisdioxopiperazine ICRF-187. Recent data have indicated that ATP binding is required for efficient binding of bisdioxopiperazines to the enzyme (25Morris S.K. Baird C.L. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2613-2618Google Scholar). In fact, investigations performed by Lindsley and coworkers have suggested that bisdioxopiperazines bind to the enzyme-ADP complex after hydrolysis of both ATPs and after dissociation of the products of the first hydrolysis (25Morris S.K. Baird C.L. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2613-2618Google Scholar). The sensitivity of G164I/wt to ICRF-187 predicts that binding and hydrolysis of only one ATP induce a specific conformation in the N-terminal clamp, where binding of the drug is possible. This suggests that the N-terminal conformation adopted by the G164I/wt heterodimer after hydrolysis of the first ATP at a point becomes similar to the conformation attained by the wild type enzyme after hydrolysis of the second ATP.The ability of G164I/wt to perform more than stoichiometric relaxation demonstrates that the enzyme is able to go through successive catalytic cycles. Binding and hydrolysis of only one ATP molecule is therefore sufficient for resetting of the enzyme, although we cannot exclude that the decreased relaxation activity observed with the heterodimer to some extent is caused by a less efficient resetting. However, the lack of DNA-stimulated ATP binding and hydrolysis and the lack of ATP-stimulated DNA cleavage observed in the heterodimer demonstrate that steps in the catalytic cycle prior to the resetting event are affected, when the second ATP is inhibited from binding. Thus, although the clamp closing data suggest that the intersubunit communication is retained in the N-terminal region, lack of a second ATP seems to influence the intrasubunit communication at least between the ATP binding region and the central cleavage/ligation domain.Studies of a yeast topoisomerase II mutant lacking cleavage activity have indicated that DNA stimulation of the ATP binding rate is primarily mediated through G-segment binding, and it has been suggested that binding of the T-segment might be required to obtain full stimulation of ATP hydrolysis (7Morris S.K. Harkins T.T. Tennyson R.B. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3446-3452Google Scholar). Additionally, investigation of wild type human topoisomerase IIα using DNA fragments of different lengths have revealed that stimulation of the ATPase rate may be dependent upon both G- and T-segment binding (28Hammonds T.R. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32696-32703Google Scholar). According to these results, an impaired ability to bind either of the two DNA duplexes could cause the DNA-independent ATP binding and hydrolysis activities observed by G164I/wt. However, the cleavage results showed that the mutation at Gly-164 did not affect the intrinsic cleavage activity, indicating that the mutant binds the G-segment normally. The relaxation data further demonstrated that the enzyme is able to capture a T-segment. Thus, it seems unlikely that the inability of DNA to stimulate the ATP binding and hydrolysis activities of the heterodimer are caused by impaired DNA interactions. It is, however, more likely that the stimulatory effect of DNA on ATP binding is normally exerted through binding of the second ATP after clamp closure, which would correlate with the earlier observation that ATP binding in topoisomerase II is cooperative only in the presence of DNA (5Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8096-8104Google Scholar). In that case we would not expect any DNA stimulation of ATP binding in G164I/wt.Like ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis in G164I/wt is unaffected by DNA binding, and the enzyme does not show the normal stimulatory effect of ATP on DNA cleavage. When topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage is performed in the presence of ATP or an ATP analogue, the DNA cleavage/ligation equilibrium is normally shifted toward cleavage. This shift has been suggested to result from a delay in the ligation reaction due to formation of a transient gate in the cleaved G-segment that can accommodate T-segment transport (10Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9944-9950Google Scholar, 31Robinson M.J. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2511-2515Google Scholar). However, the heterodimer lacked the stimulatory effect of ATP on cleavage complex formation, although the active site tyrosines were able to move apart to allow transport of the T-segment. Based on these results, binding of the second ATP molecule could be required for stabilization of a gate already formed upon binding of the first ATP, or it could influence the rate of cleavage per se. Alternatively, if signaling between the ATP binding domain and the cleavage/ligation domain requires a functional interaction between the two ATP binding sites, the stimulatory effect of the nucleotide on cleavage could be abolished in the heterodimer.Cleavage might indirectly be related to a DNA-dependent stimulation of ATP hydrolysis. This has been suggested earlier from studies with yeast topoisomerase II, where an active site mutant unable to perform DNA cleavage was found to have a decreased rate of ATP hydrolysis in the presence of DNA.

It is demonstrated that not only the spatial contacts among residues and between residues and heme, but the magnetic axes that can be related to the direction and magnitude of the steric tilt of the FeCN unit are strongly conserved in the two HO complexes. The results indicate that very similar contributions of steric blockage of several meso positions and steric tilt of the attacking ligand are operative. A distal H-bond network that involves numerous very strong H-bonds and immobilized water molecules is identified in HmuO that is analogous to that previously identified in hHO (Li, Y., Syvitski, R. T., Auclair, K., Wilks, A., Ortiz de Montellano, P. R., and La Mar, G. N. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 33018–33031). The NMR results are completely consistent with the very recent crystal structure of the HmuO·substrate complex. The H-bond network/ordered water molecules are proposed to orient the distal water molecule near the catalytically key Asp136 (Asp140 in hHO) that stabilizes the hydroperoxy intermediate. The dynamic stability of this H-bond network in HmuO is significantly greater than in hHO and may account for the slower catalytic rate in bacterial HO compared with mammalian HO.

In contrast to the better understood heme peroxidases and cytochromes P450, which pass through the common ferryl intermediate, the reactive form of HO is a ferric hydroperoxy intermediate (2Ortiz de Montellano P.R.

In mammals, the ∼300-residue membrane-bound enzyme occurs as an inducible HO-1, whose primary roles are iron homeostasis and heme catabolism (5Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. J. Biol.

Toxicol. 1997; 37: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2198) Google Scholar) to generate CO as a neural messenger. In higher plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, HO generates the open tetrapyrroles as light-harvesting pigments (8Beale S.I. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston, MA1994: 519-558Crossref Google Scholar). HO has also been identified in several pathogenic bacteria, where its role appears to be the essential “mining” of iron from hemes in the host (9Zhu W. Hunt D.J. Richardson A.R. Stojiljkovic I. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 10Schmitt M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 838-845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plant and bacterial HOs are soluble and somewhat shorter (∼200 residues) (9Zhu W. Hunt D.J. Richardson A.R. Stojiljkovic I. J.

Kadish K.M. Smith K.M. Guilard R. The Porphyrin Handbook. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA2003Google Scholar). Among the characterized bacterial HOs, sequence homology to the more extensively studied mammalian HO varies from relative high (33% sequence identity/70% similarity) for HmuO from Corynebacterium diphtheriae (10Schmitt M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 838-845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to low (<25%) for HemO from Neisseria meningitides(9Zhu W. Hunt D.J. Richardson A.R. Stojiljkovic I. J.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These structures shed light on a key determinant of the α-stereoselectivity, in that the distal helix covers the heme so as to sterically completely block access to the β- and δ-meso positions and partially block access to the γ-meso positions (15Schuller D.J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 16Sugishima M. Omata Y. Kakuta Y. Sakamoto H. Noguchi M. Fukuyama K.

John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2001: 317-327Google Scholar). Although no distal residue that would stabilize the hydroperoxy unit could be identified, the occurrence in the crystal of a localized water molecule H-bonded to the distal helix Asp140 carboxylate, together with the observation that mutating Asp140 to a non-anionic side chain abolishes HO activity (12Fujii H.

An annoying, but functionally irrelevant property of the mammalian HOs is that binding of the native substrate, protohemin (PH; R = vinyl in Fig. 1), leads to ∼1:1 orientational isomerism about the α/γ-axis (18Hernández G.

Nevertheless, the pattern of dipolar shifts for the protons on the proximal helix allowed determination of the orientation of the major magnetic axis, which could be correlated with a ∼20° tilt of the FeCN in the direction of the α-meso position (19Gorst C.M.

The initially assembled HmuO·PH·CN complex exhibits two sets of hyperfine shifted resonances (data not shown; see Supplemental Material), one set of which loses intensity over several days to yield an Mi:mi or Hj:hj isomer equilibrium ratio of ∼3:1 (Mi and Hi represent a methyl and single proton of the major or only equilibrium species, respectively; and mi and hj reflect a methyl and hydrogen of the minor equilibrium species, respectively), as illustrated in Fig. 3 B. The subscript i refers to heme pyrrole substituent positions 1–8, heme α/δ-meso positions, or the residue number and proton position. Hence, the substrate is initially bound disordered about the α/γ-meso axis and, like mammalian HO complexes, equilibrates to a ∼3:1 ratio with the more stable heme orientation depicted in Fig. 1 (18Hernández G.

This event occurs under conditions that do not favor productive replication (i.e. absence of helper virus coinfection), thereby establishing a latent infection (10Berns K.I. Linden R.M.

Although intermediate steps in the integration process remain undefined, its initiation is thought to parallel events that occur at the viral origin of replication during a productive infection (8Linden R.M.

Virol. 2001; 75: 3230-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The AAV2 minimal origin of DNA replication consists of two motifs, the RBS and TRS (6Linden R.M. Winocour E. Berns K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7966-7972Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 15Ward P. Berns K.I. Virology. 1995; 209: 692-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 16Smith D.H. Ward P. Linden R.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2930-2937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During viral DNA replication, the virally encoded Rep protein binds to the RBS. This event is followed by site- and strand-specific endonuclease activity directed at the TRS. Through this activity, Rep generates a 3′-hydroxyl group to allow for unidirectional DNA replication of its hairpinned ends (17Berns K.I. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. 3rd Ed. Fields Virology. 2. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 2173-2197Google Scholar). The RBS and TRS motifs are also present within AAVS1, and together with Rep have been shown to be both necessary and sufficient for targeted AAV2 integration at this site (6Linden R.M. Winocour E. Berns K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7966-7972Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Current models suggest that Rep interacts with the AAVS1 motifs in a manner that is similar to its interaction with the viral origin of DNA replication thereby targeting the AAV2 genome for integration at this site (8Linden R.M. Ward P. Giraud C. Winocour E. Berns K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11288-11294Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 13Kotin R.M. Hum. Gene Ther. 1994; 5: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain of AAV Rep has been shown to contain all of the residues necessary for site-specific DNA binding and endonuclease activity (14Yoon M. Smith D.H. Ward P. Medrano F.J. Aggarwal A.K. Linden R.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3230-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 18Cathomen T. Collete D. Weitzman M.D. J.

This domain includes an active tyrosine residue, Tyr-156, which is conserved in all parvovirus nonstructural Rep proteins. This residue is responsible for the covalent attachment of Rep during transesterification to the nicked DNA strand through a 5′-phosphotyrosyl linkage to a thymidine residue at the TRS (20Snyder R.O. Im D.S. Muzyczka N. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 6204-6213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Im D.S. Muzyczka N. Cell. 1990; 61: 447-457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). As expected, mutation of this active site tyrosine results in the abrogation of TRS nicking activity (19Davis M.D. Wu J. Owens R.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2936-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 22Smith R.H. Kotin R.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3122-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Both Davis et al. (19Davis M.D. Wu J. Owens R.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2936-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and our laboratory (14Yoon M. Smith D.H. Ward P. Medrano F.J. Aggarwal A.K. Linden R.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3230-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that Rep variants consisting of the amino-terminal 200 or 208 amino acids, respectively, retained specific endonuclease activity. Sequence comparison between related parvoviruses reveals that Asn-208 is within a region that is not conserved, suggesting that it may serve as a linker between the endonuclease and highly conserved helicase domains. Taken together, these observations suggest that the relevant boundary with respect to endonuclease function lies close to asparagine 208 and thus defines the endonuclease domain. A prerequisite to nicking by Rep is that the TRS is single-stranded, which in vitro is accomplished via ATP- and Mg2+-dependent Rep helicase activity (23Brister J.R. Muzyczka N. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9325-9336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On a single-stranded TRS substrate, helicase activity is no longer a prerequisite for nicking activity. Therefore, endonuclease activity itself is ATP-independent. However, the presence of a divalent metal cofactor is absolutely necessary. Our previous data using the truncation variant Rep78N208Δ demonstrated that the amino-terminal domain is able to nick the TRS in a metal-dependent manner. These observations support that, in addition to the putative metal-binding site for helicase activity and the carboxyl-terminal zinc fingers (24Horer M. Weger S. Butz K. Hoppe-Seyler F. Geisen C. Kleinschmidt J.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5485-5496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), there exists an independent metal-binding site dedicated to endonuclease activity within the amino-terminal domain. The existence of an amino-terminal metal-binding site for Rep has recently been confirmed by the crystal structure of the AAV type 5 Rep endonuclease domain (25Hickman A.B. Ronning D.R. Kotin R.M. Dyda F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 327-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Hickman et al. (25Hickman A.B. Ronning D.R. Kotin R.M. Dyda F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 327-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that two histidines and a glutamate residue act to coordinate the divalent metal ion. Interestingly, type 5 and type 2 appear to be among the most disparate serotypes among the AAV family members (26Chiorini J.A. Kim F. Yang L. Kotin R.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1309-1319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, using a conditional mutagenesis approach specific for acidic residues, we demonstrate a metal binding role for the same glutamate residue, Glu-83 in AAV2, and also provide evidence that indicates that Glu-164 is likely to be in close proximity to the active site. Taken together, the coordination of the structural data for AAV5 Rep and the functional data described here serve to provide an accurate picture of the AAV2 Rep endonuclease domain. All mutant Rep proteins were generated using pHisRep68/15b, which contains the AAV2rep68 gene in a pET15b vector (Novagen). Site-directed mutagenesis for mutants D14C and E83C were generated via overlapping PCR using NdeI and SacI for cloning back into pHisRep68. Mutants E6C, D16C, E36C, D42C, E57C, E75C, E96C, E114C, E125C, E173C, E184C, E201C, E83A, and E164A were generated using the QuikChange Site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Double mutants E83C/Y156F, and E83C/K340H were generated by subcloning sequences carrying one mutation into vectors carrying the complementary mutation. In all cases, sequences generated by PCR were confirmed by sequencing. All recombinant proteins were isolated via nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column chromatography as described previously (14Yoon M. Smith D.H. Ward P. Medrano F.J. Aggarwal A.K. Linden R.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3230-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). 50-ml cultures of BL21(DE3)pLysS cells were prepared and induced as per the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen), and induced bacterial pellets were frozen at −80 °C until processed. Column chromatography, using 1-ml Hi-Trap Chelating columns (AmershamBiosciences), was performed as per the manufacturer's instructions using the His·Bind Buffer kit (Novagen). Proteins were eluted in 300 mm imidazole and desalted over PD-10 columns (AmershamBiosciences) into a buffer containing 25 mm Tris·Cl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 20% glycerol. Proteins were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until use. Protein concentrations were estimated by Coomassie Blue staining after SDS-PAGE using wild type Rep68, quantified by Bio-Rad Protein Assay reagent, as a reference. Substrates for endonuclease assays were made by first kinase labeling the TRS-containing oligonucleotide, RML76 (5-CTAGATGATGGAGTTGGCCACTCCCTCTCTGCGCGCTCGCTCGCTCACTG-3′), followed by annealing to the appropriate complementary strand, either RML77 (5′-TCGACAGTGAGCGAGCGAGCGCGCAGAGAGGGAGTGGCCAACTCCATCAT-3′) for the dsTRS substrate or MY** (5′-TCGACAGTGAGCGAGCGAGCGCGC-3′) for the ssTRS substrate. Nicking assays were performed as described previously (14Yoon M. Smith D.H. Ward P. Medrano F.J. Aggarwal A.K. Linden R.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3230-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20-μl reactions containing 25 mm HEPES·KOH (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 ng of bovine serum albumin, 5 pmol of kinase-labeled substrate, and, where indicated, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm metal cofactor, and 100 ng of Rep. Reactions were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C and ethanol-precipitated at −20 °C in the presence of 2 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA (Stratagene). Precipitated DNA was resuspended in 5 μl of formamide loading buffer and fractionated on 15% polyacrylamide, 50% urea gels in 1× Tris·borate·EDTA (pH 8.3). Gel shift substrates were made by annealing RML76 and RML77 (AAVori) or RML102 (5′-CTTTCCTCGTTGGAATCAGAGCGGGAGCTAAACAGGAGG-3′) and RML115 (5′-CGGCCTCCTGTTTAGCTCCCGCTCTGATTCCAAC-3′) (RS1) followed by Klenow labeling with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences). Assays were performed as follows. In a total reaction volume of 14 μl, 100 ng of protein was incubated with 50 fmol of radiolabeled DNA in a buffer consisting of 0.25× TBE (22.5 mmTris·borate, pH 8.3; 0.5 mm EDTA), 1.25 mmdithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 500 ng of poly(dI-dC), and 3 μl of loading buffer (40% sucrose, 1% xylene cyanol, 1% bromphenol blue in 0.25× TBE). Reactions were loaded onto a 6% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE, incubated an additional 10 min, and run at 18 V/cm at room temperature. Electrophoresed gels were then fixed in 10% trichloroacetic acid, dried, and visualized using a STORM860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Quantification of PhosphorImager data was performed using ImageQuant version 1.11 software (AmershamBiosciences). The assay was performed as described previously (14Yoon M. Smith D.H. Ward P. Medrano F.J. Aggarwal A.K. Linden R.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3230-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In a total reaction volume of 10 μl, 50 or 100 ng of protein was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 30 fmol of Klenow-labeled AAVori. Each protein was adjusted to 100 ng/μl in the appropriate storage buffer, and a total of 1 μl of protein and/or protein storage buffer was added to each reaction. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 3 μl of loading buffer (10 mm Tris·Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 0.1% each bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol, and 20% glycerol) and loaded onto an 8% native polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE. The electrophoresed gel was then fixed, dried, and visualized as per the EMSA. To visualize the covalently attached PDCs formed as a result of nicking at the TRS, ssTRS substrates were used in which the TRS-containing strand (RML76) was labeled at the 3′ terminus using terminal dideoxytransferase (New England Biolabs) and 3′-α-[32P]ddATP. This resulted in the addition of a single labeled nucleotide. Nicking assays were performed as usual, except that the final reaction volume was adjusted to 10 μl. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C and terminated by the addition of 1 μl of 0.5 m EDTA and 3 μl of loading buffer. Reactions were run on 6% native polyacrylamide gels in 1× TBE and treated as per the EMSA and helicase assay. Cysteine replacement of acidic residues has been used previously to identify the metal-binding sites of several endonucleases of the “DDE” motif-containing family. These include TnsA, a subunit of the Tn7 transposase (27Sarnovsky R.J. May E.W. Craig N.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6348-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), the Tn10 transposase (28Allingham J.S. Pribil P.A. Haniford D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1195-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and most recently, the RAG1 endonuclease which facilitates V(D)J recombination of the immunoglobulin locus (29Fugmann S.D. Villey I.J. Ptaszek L.M. Schatz D.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 30Landree M.A. Wibbenmeyer J.A. Roth D.B. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3059-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This method takes advantage of the different side chain chemistries between acidic amino acids, aspartate and glutamate, and cysteine with respect to their ability to interact with divalent metal ions Mg2+ and Mn2+(31Pecoraro V.L. Hermes J.D. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5262-5271Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The oxygen of aspartate and glutamate acts as a good ligand for both metal ions, whereas the sulfur of cysteine is only able to interact efficiently with Mn2+. Accordingly, a cysteine substitution of an acidic amino acid that results in a change in the divalent metal ion requirement for catalysis strongly implicates that residue in metal binding. A multiple sequence alignment of the AAV2 Rep endonuclease domain (amino acids 1–208) (14Yoon M. Smith D.H. Ward P. Medrano F.J. Aggarwal A.K. Linden R.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3230-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with the nonstructural proteins from different parvoviruses was performed. This analysis resulted in the identification of several candidate metal-binding residues (ClustalW alignment, Blosum similarity matrix, open gap penalty = 10, extend gap penalty = 0.1). A total of 3 aspartate and 13 glutamate residues were highly conserved (Fig. 1 A). Of these, residues Glu-6, Asp-14, Asp-16, Asp-42, and Glu-83 were of particular interest, because it was previously shown that alanine substitution at these positions abrogated nicking activity, but maintained wild type origin binding ability (32Urabe M. Hasumi Y. Kume A. Surosky R.T. Kurtzman G.J. Tobita K. Ozawa K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2682-2693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although E164A was shown to have wild type nicking activity, it was determined that this mutant was unable to mediate integration in a PCR-based assay and was therefore included in this group. Alanine substitution at residues Glu-36, Glu-49, Glu-57, Glu-75, Glu-96, Glu-114, Glu-125, Glu-173, Glu-184, and Glu-201 had no effect on nicking activity (32Urabe M. Hasumi Y. Kume A. Surosky R.T. Kurtzman G.J. Tobita K. Ozawa K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2682-2693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were controls for this study. All variants used in this study were cloned into bacterial expression vectors that place a His6 tag at the amino terminus of the protein. Recombinant proteins were isolated by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column chromatography in comparable quantities and at greater than 95% purity (Fig. 1 B). It should be noted that variant E6C required a lower induction temperature (18 °C) in order for the protein to be recovered in the soluble fraction. In order to determine whether or not the cysteine mutants displayed conditional activity in the presence of either Mg2+ or Mn2+, TRS endonuclease assays were performed using two related substrates (Fig. 2). Both substrates contain the AAV2 minimal origin of DNA replication and differ in whether or not the TRS region is single-stranded (ssTRS, Fig. 2 A) or double-stranded (dsTRS, Fig. 2 B). Wild type Rep68 protein retains nicking activity in both Mg2+ and Mn2+ regardless of the state of the TRS; although consistent with previous studies, the wild type enzyme clearly favors Mn2+ on the ssTRS substrate (Fig. 2 A,lanes 2–4,top and bottom) (14Yoon M. Smith D.H. Ward P. Medrano F.J. Aggarwal A.K. Linden R.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3230-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 22Smith R.H. Kotin R.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3122-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Mn2+ enhancement of nicking is not as pronounced when the dsTRS is used (Fig. 2 B,lanes 2–4,top and bottom). Cysteine mutants D14C, D16C, and D42C follow a wild type-like pattern of nicking in that they retain activity on both substrates in the presence of either divalent metal ion. E83C, however, clearly displays a conditional phenotype. Although nicking is barely detectable in Mg2+ (Fig. 2, A andB,top,lanes 17–19), it is recoverable to some extent in the presence of Mn2+ on the dsTRS substrate (Fig. 2 B,bottom, lanes 17–19) and to significant levels on the ssTRS substrate (Fig. 2 A,bottom, lanes 17–19). This switch in divalent metal ion requirement compared with the wild type enzyme strongly implicates this residue in coordination of the metal cation. Although not as remarkable as the conditional phenotype observed for E83C, E164C nicking activity is also suppressed in Mg2+ but rescued in Mn2+ (Fig. 2, A andB,top and bottom, lanes 20–22). Nicking was not observed when a divalent metal cation was omitted from the reaction or when an endonuclease negative variant, Y156F, was used (data not shown). The results from the experiment in Fig. 2 are summarized in Table I. The total nicking activity of each of the variants was quantified relative to that of wild type Rep68 on each substrate and metal ion. Overall, that the nicking activity of E83C and E164C is suppressed in Mg2+ and active in Mn2+ is apparent, although the extent of rescue is more pronounced on the ssTRS substrate. Mg2+ is unable to efficiently support nicking by E83C or E164C on the ssTRS (0 and 11% of wild type, respectively). For both variants, nicking is restored in the presence of Mn2+ to approximately half of wild type Rep68 levels (55% for E83C and 66% for E164C). The control variants, Glu-36, Glu-49, Glu-57, Glu-75, Glu-96, Glu-114, Glu-125, Glu-173, Glu-184, and Glu-201 were assayed in the same manner as described in Fig. 2 and, as predicted, possessed a wild type phenotype in that they were active in both divalent metal ions (data not shown). This supports the notion that although Asp/Glu to Cys substitutions are not conservative, they are tolerated by the enzyme. E6C is an exception, in that it showed no activity in our assays. As noted above, it was not possible to isolate this mutant under the same conditions as the others, suggesting that this mutation had a more global effect on protein integrity.Table ISubstrate nicking by cysteine mutants in the presence of Mg2+or Mn2+ divalent metal cofactor.ssTRSdsTRSMg2+Mn2+Mg2+Mn2+Wild type∼1∼1∼1∼1E6C0.000.030.000.05D14C0.860.880.770.42D16C0.890.910.650.56D42C1.000.860.750.43E83C0.000.550.000.11E164C0.110.660.040.17Nicking values are relative. Nicking of wild type Rep68 was set to 1. Values represent the average of triplicate assays. Open table in a new tab Nicking values are relative. Nicking of wild type Rep68 was set to 1. Values represent the average of triplicate assays. The decreased ability of E83C nicking activity to be rescued in Mn2+ on the dsTRS compared with the ssTRS could be the result of competition between the putative metal-binding site of the helicase domain and that of the endonuclease domain on the same metal cofactor pool. This prospect is magnified because it has been demonstrated that Rep helicase activity is not efficiently supported in Mn2+ at the same concentrations as in Mg2+ (21Im D.S. Muzyczka N. Cell. 1990; 61: 447-457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar,33Zhou X. Zolotukhin I. Im D.S. Muzyczka N. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1580-1590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To overcome this possibility, nicking assays using E83C on the dsTRS substrate were performed such that both Mg2+ and Mn2+ were titrated into the same reaction (Fig. 3). Although the wild type enzyme was active over a broad range of total Me2+ concentrations, nicking by E83C was only observed when Mn2+ was present in the reaction (Fig. 3, lanes 13–19). Strong nicking activity by E83C, comparable with the wild type enzyme, was restored at an Mg2+ to Mn2+ ratio of 1:1 (Fig. 3, lanes 13 and 17). The lack of nicking activity in Mg2+ by E83C and E164C could also be attributed to a decreased affinity for the metal due to the substitution. In order to rule out this possibility, experiments were performed in which each divalent metal cofactor was titrated into the reaction. This approach assumes that a lower affinity for the divalent cation could be overcome by an increase in its concentration in the reaction. As Fig. 4 shows, an increase in the concentration of Mg2+ on either the ssTRS (A) or dsTRS (B) substrate did not result in recovery of nicking activity for either variant, in support of our hypothesis that the activity of the cysteine substitution mutants is specifically dependent on Mn2+. The origin of the higher migrating products in the presence of Mg2+ on the dsTRS substrate (Fig. 4 B,lanes 6,13, and19) is unknown. However, it is possible that they may be the result of a conformational change in the DNA substrate that occurs at high magnesium concentrations that promote nonspecific nicking by Rep. A control mutant, E83C/Y156F, did not possess any nicking activity, thus making the possibility of a copurifying, nonspecific nuclease unlikely (data not shown). In order to verify that the conditional phenotype displayed by E83C and the partially conditional phenotype of E164C was specific for the presence of cysteine at these positions, single alanine substitutions of these residues were made. As expected, mutant E83A nicking activity was shown to be severely impaired (Fig. 5, lanes 12–16). However, there is residual activity in the presence of Mn2+ (Fig. 5,lane 14), suggesting that Glu-83 does not act alone in metal binding. The generation of E164A allowed us to determine the relative contribution of this residue to nicking when compared with wild type Rep68 and Glu-83 variants. Because the nicking phenotype of E164C was not fully conditional, we hypothesized that this residue may not play a direct role in metal binding but may perhaps act to maintain the integrity of the metal-binding pocket within the enzyme. This hypothesis is based on the position of Glu-164 and its relative proximity to the active tyrosine residue at position 156 with respect to the amino acid sequence. However, E164A activity was only slightly affected when compared with the wild type enzyme, indicating that Glu-164 does not play a significant role, if any, in metal interactions. Other divalent metal cations were tested for their ability to support nicking by the conditional mutants. Zn2+- and Ca2+-supplemented buffers were also used for the nicking assay, respectively. Wild type Rep showed very weak activity in Ca2+, in addition to the stronger activity typically observed in Mg2+ and Mn2+. However, nicking by the cysteine-substituted enzymes was only efficiently supported by Mn2+, as expected. Zn2+ was unable to support nicking by any of the proteins tested, as reported previously (21Im D.S. Muzyczka N. Cell. 1990; 61: 447-457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 34Im D.S. Muzyczka N. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1119-1128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Smith R.H. Kotin R.M. J.

Because origin binding and helicase-mediated extrusion of the TRS (on the dsTRS substrate) are prerequisites to endonuclease activity, it is possible that the conditional phenotype observed for E83C and the partially conditional phenotype for E164C are not specific to endonuclease activity per se but have their effect on the steps prior to transesterification at the TRS. To rule out this possibility, E83C and E164C were tested for the origin binding and helicase activities in separate assays under conditions that did not favor their nicking activity, i.e. in buffers lacking Mn2+. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed using wild type Rep68 and the nicking mutant Rep68Y156F as a control. This mutation has been shown previously to have no effect on origin binding or unwinding and is thus consistent with a catalytic endonuclease mutant (19Davis M.D. Wu J. Owens R.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2936-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 22Smith R.H. Kotin R.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3122-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Both E83C and E164C retain wild type origin-binding affinities in the absence of Mn2+, demonstrating the independence of this activity from Mn2+(Fig. 6 A). The same held true for"

By comparison, the percentage of cells in Lac Z virus-infected cultures containing translocated Bax and cytoplasmic cytochrome c was markedly less even after RA treatment. Despite this, RA-treated Lac Z and untreated cyclin D1 virus-infected cultures contained similarly low proportions of cells with active caspase or cells that were permeable to propidium iodide.

Although constitutive Bcl-2 expression prevented Bax activation, it did not alter cyclin D1-induced cell cycle arrest, illustrating the independence of these events.

The importance of cyclin D1 in oncogenesis is reflected in numerous tumor types that display amplification and/or overexpression of the cyclin D1 gene (1Hunter T. Pines J. Cell. 1994; 79: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2147) Google Scholar). On the other hand, high levels of cyclin D1 can also result in growth suppression and apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 3Han E.K.-H. Begemann M. Sgambato A. Soh J.-W. Doki Y. Xing W.-Q. Liu W.

Similar to other protooncogene products such as Myc, high level expression of cyclin D1 elicits an apoptotic response in the absence of trophic factors, although apoptosis can occur even in the presence of serum (5Katayama K.

There are now numerous members of this family defined by the presence of four conserved α-helical Bcl-2 homology domains called BH-1–4. The central role of the Bcl-2 family in the regulation of cell death is control over mitochondrial membrane permeability and release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm, where it is free to interact with Apaf-1 and caspase-9 to form an active “apoptosome” complex, inducing a cascade of protease activity and ensuing cell death (6Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6156) Google Scholar). Proapoptotic molecules including Bax and Bak do not have the BH-4 domain, but their activity depends on the presence of the BH-3 domain (7Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 18: 1899-1911Crossref Scopus (3222) Google Scholar, 8Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3225-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Bax is a cytoplasmic monomer in thriving cells and undergoes mitochondrial translocation in response to stress or damage signals following a conformational change in the molecule. Cytochrome c release is thought to occur as a result of the formation of large Bax conductance channels in the outer mitochondrial membrane as multimers, alone or in protein/lipid complexes, or in coordination with the voltage-dependent anion channel (9Martinou J.C. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E41-E43Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Although membrane integration of this “activated” Bax requires the hydrophobic C terminus, the translocation/insertion process is also associated with exposure of the normally occluded N terminus (10Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar, 11Nechushtan A. Smith C.L. Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). Experimentally enforced dimerization of Bax results in mitochondrial translocation but no cytochrome c release and death as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction (13Gross A. Jockel J. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3878-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Other types of proapoptotic molecules are the BH3 domain-only proteins including Bid, Bim, Bad, and the p53-regulated NOXA (14Huang D.C.S. Strasser S. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Bid can activate Bax directly, whereas the latter three proteins can be bound and sequestered by Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, which is thought to represent their major antiapoptotic activity (14Huang D.C.S. Strasser S. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). The caspase family of cysteine proteases plays an integral role in apoptosis. The apoptosome constituent, caspase-9, is the apical enzyme in the mitochondrial death pathway responsible for activation of effector caspases including caspase-2, -3, -6, -7, and -10 (16Slee E. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.-G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). Regulation of caspase activity is afforded by a growing family of inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) gene products, which contain from one to three domains homologous to the initially described baculovirus IAP repeat domain (17Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar, 18Miller L.K. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 323-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). IAP activity may be inhibited by mitochondrial release of the Smac/DIABLO protein, which then allows for full activation of caspase-9 within the Apaf-1 cytochrome ccomplex (19Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2870) Google Scholar, 20Verhagen A.M. Ekert P.G. Pakusch M. Silke J. Connolly L.M. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Vaux D.L. Cell. 2000; 102: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). Although apoptosis is usually defined as a caspase-dependent process, an inefficient apoptosis or necrotic cell death can also occur as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction (21Borner C. Monney L. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 22Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work, we have acutely expressed cyclin D1 by adenoviral-mediated gene transfer into breast cancer cell lines, resulting in G2/M phase arrest, p53-dependent Bax mitochondrial translocation, and cytochrome c release without accompanying caspase activation. The addition of RA or antisense Bcl-2 to these cells markedly increased caspase activation. The results support the notion that Bcl-2 can not only prevent Bax recruitment to the mitochondrial membrane but can also interfere with caspase activation during the course of an apoptotic signal. MCF-7 cells and ZR-75 human breast cancer cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) at 37 °C/5% CO2 with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1% non-essential amino acids, 110 μg/ml sodium pyruvate, and 10 μg/ml gentamicin. For treatment with RA, 100-mm plates were seeded with 5 × 105 cells and made 1 μm with RA or the equivalent amount of vehicle after attachment. Cells were harvested at the indicated times. To generate stable HPV-16 E6 clones, CMV-HPV-16 E6 was cotransfected with CMV-puromycin into MCF-7 cells using the calcium phosphate precipitate method as described previously (23Niu M.-Y. Menard M. Reed J.C. Krajewski S. Pratt M.A.C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3506-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cells were selected in 2 μg/ml puromycin, and individual clones were isolated and expanded and then evaluated for the expression of theE6 gene by Northern analysis of RNA. p53 protein was assessed in E6-positive clones by immunoblot analysis. Two clones were chosen for experimentation based on very low levels of p53 protein as compared with control MCF-7 cells. The HPV-16 E6 oncoprotein cDNA was obtained from Peter Howley (Harvard University). Anti-cyclin D1 monoclonal (HD11) and polyclonal (M20), anti-p53 (Pab 240), anti-Bcl-2, and anti-Bax were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-Apaf-1 was purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA); monoclonal (mAb) anti-Bax 6A7 was purchased from Trevigen (Gaithersburg, MD); anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody was purchased from Pharmingen; and polyclonal antibody (H-104) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-cytochrome c oxidase was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); anti-mitochondrial hsp 70 was purchased from ABR (Golden, CO); anti-Smac/DIABLO was purchased from Prosci (Poway, CA); and secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, CY3, and fluorescein were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Lac Z-expressing adenovirus was obtained from Dr. Ruth Slack (Ottawa, ON), and adenovirus expressing human cyclin D1 was obtained from Dr. J Albrecht (Minnesota) (24Hansen L.K. Albrecht J.H. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2971-2981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Viruses were generated by ligation of either Lac Z or cyclin D1 into pACCMV.pLpA followed by cotransfection with pJM17 into 293 cells. Briefly, MCF-7 and ZR-75 cells were split and plated on coverslips. After attachment, cultures were infected with the Lac Z adenovirus or cyclin D1 adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 75 for 3 h in a minimum of medium without serum. Following infection, medium with 5% fetal bovine serum and 1 μm RA or vehicle was added to cultures for 96 h unless otherwise stated. For antisense Bcl-2 experiments, cells were transfected in serum-free medium at 37 °C/5% CO2 with the oligonucleotide 5′-TCTCCCAGCGTGCGCCAT-3′ from Trilink Bio Technologies Inc. at a final concentration of 150 nm using Lipofection reagent (Invitrogen). A control oligonucleotide contained the same base composition in a random order. Four h later, the transfection medium was replaced with complete medium for the final 48 h of culture. Subconfluent cultures were collected after trypsinization, centrifuged in medium containing 5% serum, and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (137 mm NaCl, 27 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, KH2PO4). The insoluble microsomal fraction containing mitochondria was isolated exactly as described (23Niu M.-Y. Menard M. Reed J.C. Krajewski S. Pratt M.A.C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3506-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) except that final supernatants were transferred to ultrafuge tubes and further clarified following a 1-h centrifugation at 100,000 × g. Cultures were harvested into prechilled microfuge tubes in 500 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture. Lysates were processed, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for immunodetection and visualization by chemiluminescence as described previously (23Niu M.-Y. Menard M. Reed J.C. Krajewski S. Pratt M.A.C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3506-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Densitometric analysis was performed using a Kodak Image Station 440 CF. For Bax 6A7 staining, cells were cultured in 35-mm dishes on coverslips, and at the appropriate times, they were fixed with 3% formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature and then permeabilized for 2 min with 0.2% CHAPS in PBS. Mouse anti-Bax monoclonal 6A7 was used at a 1:300 dilution in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS and incubated with coverslips for 1 h at room temperature. For double-staining, the anti-cyclin D1 polyclonal antibody was used at a dilution of 1:50. Immunostained cells were detected following a 1-h incubation at room temperature with CY3-labeled goat anti-mouse or fluorescein-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Cytochrome c staining (1:50) was performed on cold methanol-fixed cells, and antibody was detected with CY-3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Coverslips were mounted with anti-fade (glycerol containing 1 mg/mlp-phenylene-diamine). For Hoechst staining, cells were fixed on coverslips with cold methanol at −20 °C for 5 min and then incubated in a 1:1500 dilution of Hoechst 33258 at room temperature, washed with PBS, and then mounted on coverslips with anti-fade. Intensely stained nuclei of reduced size were scored as apoptotic. Image capture and slide evaluations were performed using a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope equipped with Northern Eclipse image analysis software (EMPIX Imaging Inc., Mississauga, ON). All histogram bars represent results from evaluation of at least 1000 cells enumerated on coverslips from multiple microscopic fields. Cells were trypsinized for 96 h following viral infection and culture in the presence or absence of RA, and 3 × 105 cells were resuspended in 300 μl of complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. 2 μl of propidium iodide solution (250 μg/ml) was added to the suspension just prior to flow analysis. Detection of caspase activity was performed using the CaspaTag fluorescein caspase VAD activity kit (Intergen, Purchase, NY) containing the inhibitor FAM-VAD-FMK according to the manufacturer's instructions. Caspase activity in camptothecin-treated cells was used as a positive control. Flow analysis of ungated fluorescence-labeled cells was performed on a Coulter Epics Altra cytometer (Hialeah, FL) equipped with an Argon laser and EXPO II software (Applied Cytometry Systems). Background levels of FAM-VAD-FMK and PI staining in uninfected cells were subtracted from experimental values. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 4 °C in PBS with 1 mm EDTA and then resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold PBS/EDTA and fixed by the addition of 3 ml of 80% ice-cold ethanol. For flow cytometric analysis, an aliquot of cells was pelleted at 500 × g for 5 min, washed with PBS/EDTA, and then resuspended in PBS/EDTA containing 100 μg/ml RNase A for 20 min at room temperature and made 32 μm with propidium iodide. Following flow cytometry, data analysis was performed using the Multicycle AV program for Windows (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA). For the last 2 h of culture, infected cells on coverslips that had been treated with 1 μm RA or vehicle for 96 h were incubated in medium containing 250 nm Mitotracker Red CM-H2XRos (Molecular Probes), which fluoresces only in cells with an intact mitochondrial membrane potential. Coverslips were then rinsed twice in PBS, fixed, and permeabilized as described above for immunostaining with the Bax 6A7 antibody and then stained with Hoechst. To investigate the effects of amplified expression of cyclin D1, we infected MCF-7 and ZR-75 cells with an adenovirus expressing human cyclin D1 (adeno-cyclin D1) or the same virus expressing Lac Z (adeno-Lac Z). The immunoblot in Fig.1A shows that cells infected with adeno-cyclin D1 express cyclin D1 at more than 20-fold (determined densitometrically) above the endogenous level assayed in adeno-Lac Z-infected cells at 96 h following infection. Staining for Lac Z in the adeno-Lac Z-infected cultures revealed Lac Z activity in at least 75% of the cells at 96 h after infection (not shown). Initially, we determined the sensitivity to RA-induced cell death and the availability of the N-terminal epitope of Bax in adeno-cyclin D1-expressing cells. Monoclonal antibody 6A7 (25Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) recognizes the N terminus of Bax associated with its mitochondrial membrane insertion and oligomerization early in apoptosis but does not bind to soluble Bax. Fig. 1B contains micrographs of Bax 6A7 immunoreactivity and Hoechst staining of MCF-7 cells infected with either adeno-Lac Z or cyclin D1. Numerous mAb 6A7-positive cells can be seen in the adeno-cyclin D1 cultures but not in the adeno-Lac Z-infected cultures. Strikingly, almost no apoptotic nuclei as determined morphologically following Hoechst stain were present in adeno-cyclin D1-infected cells despite the widespread Bax activation in these cultures. Fig. 1C shows that there were few 6A7-positive cells in adeno-Lac Z-infected MCF-7 and ZR-75 populations. RA increased the percentage 4–5-fold in both cell lines. In remarkable contrast, percentages of 6A7-positive cells in adeno-cyclin D1-infected MCF-7 and ZR-75 cells were increased 10- and 36-fold, respectively, over those observed in Lac Z virus-infected cells. Although RA further increased the percentage of 6A7-reactive cells, this increase was fractional as compared with the severalfold increase in apoptotic nuclei following RA treatment of adeno-cyclin D1-infected cells. Surprisingly, less than 2% of both untreated Lac Z and adeno-cyclin D1-infected MCF-7 and ZR-75 cells contained morphologically apoptotic nuclei. Only small increases in apoptotic nuclei were obtained after RA treatment of adeno-Lac Z-infected cultures. This contrasts with the much larger increase in percentages of apoptotic cells induced by RA in the cyclin D1 virus-infected cells. Thus cyclin D1 induces Bax translocation but not apoptosis in these breast cancer cell lines. Moreover, RA acts synergistically with cyclin D1 to increase apoptosis by a factor that far exceeds that by which it increases Bax translocation. When vehicle-treated adeno-cyclin D1-infected cells were left in culture past 96 h, what appeared morphologically to be necrotic cell death occurred involving cell swelling without blebbing beginning at about day 6 after infection. To ensure that cyclin D1 overexpression was coincident with activated Bax, we co-immunostained cells with both mAb 6A7 and anti-cyclin D1. Fig. 2A shows intense nuclear staining for cyclin D1 in cells indicated by the arrowheads. The accompanying panel shows that the same cells stain positively with mAb 6A7. A time course of cyclin D1 expression is shown in Fig. 2B, indicating that 24 h after viral infection, cyclin D1 protein levels began to increase and were markedly increased 96 h after adeno-cyclin D1 infection. A time course of the progressive increase in immunoreactivity with mAb 6A7 in Fig.2C indicated that Bax activation began at levels of cyclin D1 expressed at ∼72 h in both control and RA-treated cultures and increased further by 96 h. Together, these data indicate that high cyclin D1 expression results in a conformational change in Bax that does not itself cause apoptosis. The insertion of Bax into the mitochondrial membrane results in release of cytochrome c to the cytosol, potentially through Bax-associated pore formation (7Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 18: 1899-1911Crossref Scopus (3222) Google Scholar, 26Desagher S. Martinou J.-C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 369-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). To see whether the large increase in 6A7 immunostaining was associated with cytochrome c translocation, we treated MCF-7 cells with vehicle or RA for 96 h following infection with either the Lac Z or cyclin D1 virus and performed immunocytochemistry for cytochromec. Fig. 3A shows punctate staining that was predominantly perinuclear in control Lac Z virus-infected cells. After RA treatment, about 5% of these cells showed evidence of more uniform staining throughout the cytoplasm, which often obscured the nucleus. By contrast, in control cyclin D1 virus-infected cultures, between 20 and 25% of the cells appeared to lose the perinuclear staining as immunoreactivity became more widespread throughout the cell, and this percentage appeared increased after the addition of RA. To more quantitatively compare the relative levels of cytochrome c release in these treatment groups, we next isolated membrane and cytosolic fractions from both RA-treated and untreated adeno-cyclin D1- and adeno-Lac Z-infected cultures for immunoblot analysis of cytochrome c. The results in Fig.3B indicate that 96 h after infection, cytochromec is clearly present in the cytoplasmic fractions from untreated adeno-cyclin D1-infected ZR-75 and MCF-7 cultures, and this level is slightly increased in RA-treated cultures. Immunoblots were reacted with anti-cytochrome c oxidase as a control for the integrity of the fractionation. Ratios of cytoplasmic:mitochondrial cytochrome c from two separate experiments each using MCF-7 and ZR-75 cells are shown below. Depending on the cell type and the mode of induction of apoptosis, a number of studies have shown that the release of cytochromec can precede or follow the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. For example, although tumor necrosis factor-α treatment of hepatocytes results in simultaneous release of cytochrome cand mitochondrial membrane depolarization (27Bradham C.A. Qian T. Streetz K. Trautwein C. Brenner D.A. Lemasters J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6353-6364Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), UV- or staurosporine-treated HeLa and HL-60 cells do not lose mitochondrial membrane potential until well after the appearance of cytoplasmic cytochrome c (28Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar, 29Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4362) Google Scholar). To determine the status of mitochondrial membrane potential, we loaded cells for 1 h prior to harvest with the reduced form of MitoTracker Red and then immunostained with Bax 6A7 and counterstained with Hoechst. Fig. 3C shows bright punctate MitoTracker labeling in untreated MCF-7 cells infected with adeno-Lac Z. Adeno-cyclin D1-infected cultures also showed a similar pattern of MitoTracker labeling in many of the cells that also stained positive with the 6A7 antibody. Reduced staining was observed in the balance of 6A7-positive cells. Both these populations were devoid of apoptotic nuclei as determined by Hoechst staining. As expected, apoptotic nuclei were abundant in the RA-treated 6A7-positive adeno-cyclin D1-infected population, and a number of these cells showed a more diffuse pattern of MitoTracker staining or highly reduced staining. The percentages of mAb 6A7-positive cells displaying MitoTracker Red labeling are shown in Fig. 3D and indicate that over 50% of the untreated 6A7-positive cells retained mitochondrial membrane potential, whereas it was drastically reduced after RA treatment. Thus amplified expression of cyclin D1 causes widespread Bax activation and cytochrome c translocation, often without loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Only after the addition of RA is there a more complete loss of membrane potential. Overexpression of Bax can result in formation of Bax homodimers and mitochondrial membrane insertion; therefore, cyclin D1 overexpression could increase activated Bax by inducing an increase in Bax expression. The immunoblots in Fig.4A indicate that after a 96-h infection, Bax or Bcl-2 levels were equivalent in Lac Z- and cyclin D1-expressing cell extracts. Concomitant treatment with RA resulted in either no change (MCF-7) or a slight increase (ZR-75) in Bax levels while producing a profound decrease in Bcl-2 levels, which we have seen previously in MCF-7 cells (23Niu M.-Y. Menard M. Reed J.C. Krajewski S. Pratt M.A.C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3506-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus Bax activation in cyclin D1-infected cells is not the result of altered levels of Bax or Bcl-2. To assess Bax and Bcl-2 protein in mitochondria, the same membrane fractions used in the immunoblot in Fig. 3A were subjected to analysis for Bax and Bcl-2. Fig. 4B shows that mitochondrial Bax levels are more than doubled in cyclin D1-expressing cells as compared with those expressing Lac Z. The blot was reincubated with Bcl-2 antibody and, as expected, cyclin D1 had no effect on mitochondrial Bcl-2 levels. Importantly, although RA decreased mitochondrial Bcl-2 in the cyclin D1-expressing cultures, it had no effect on Bax levels. Mitochondrial heat shock protein (mt hsp) 70 is exclusively localized to mitochondria in most cells (30Dahlseid J.N. Lill R. Green J.M. Xu X. Qui Y. Pierce S.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and was used as a marker for intact mitochondria and a gel-loading control. These data support the notion that RA-induced apoptosis in cells ectopically expressing cyclin D1 is not the result of increased mitochondrial Bax but rather is due to a reduction in Bcl-2 levels. p53 can mediate both G1 and G2 arrest as well as apoptosis. G1 arrest is mostly attributed to p21 induction, whereas arrest in G2 in response to damaged DNA or nucleotide depletion in S phase involves induction of Gadd45, p21, and 14-3-3F, all of which contribute to cdc2 inhibition (31Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1803-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). Induction of apoptosis is facilitated by a number of p53 targets including Bax, Noxa, PUMA, as well as components of the death receptor pathway (32Balint E. Vousden K.H. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 85: 1813-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). To determine whether p53 was induced by cyclin D1 overexpression and might therefore be involved in the response to cyclin D1 overexpression, we performed immunoblot analysis of whole cell extracts from adeno-cyclin D1 and Lac Z-infected MCF-7 and ZR-75 cells in the presence or absence of RA. The results in Fig. 5A show that p53 protein levels were induced in both cell lines by cyclin D1; however, RA did not augment these levels. Although MCF-7 reportedly contains wild-type p53, it remained possible that some highly passaged isolates may have acquired p53 mutation. Fig. 5B shows that adeno-cyclin D1 infection increased p53 expression by 24 h, and it remained expressed throughout the duration of the experiment. Tran"

It has been proposed that, at the beginning of the infection, protein p17 could be recruiting limiting amounts of initiation factors at the viral origins. Once the infection process is established and the replication proteins reach optimal concentration, protein p17 becomes dispensable. In this paper we focused, on the one hand, on the study of protein p17 dimerization and the role of a putative coiled-coil region. On the other hand, we focused on its interaction with the viral origin-binding protein p6. Based on our results we propose that protein p17 function is to optimize binding of protein p6 at the viral DNA ends, thus favoring the initiation of replication and negatively modulating its own transcription.

Processes like DNA replication, transcription, compaction, or recombination occur in all organisms, and all of them have to be regulated and coordinated in order to obtain biological activity. Factors involved in these regulations are found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. In eukaryotes there are proteins like HMG-1 (renamed HMGB1) and HMG-2 that enhance the DNA binding of a variety of proteins (1Oñate S. Prendergast P. Wagner J.P. Nissen M. Reeves R. Pettijohn D.E.

In prokaryotes, there are histone-like proteins that can function in global regulation, acting as transcriptional modulators in multiprotein complexes with DNA. For example, H-NS influences transcription of a number of genes involved in diverse biological processes (5Falconi M. Higgins N.P. Spurio R. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 6Zuber F. Kotlarz D. Rimsky S. Buc H. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 7Atlung T.

Another histone-like protein, HU, has been shown to stimulate the action of different DNA-binding proteins (10Flashner Y. Gralla J.D.

Adhya S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), to participate in the initiation of DNA replication assisting other replication proteins (14Polaczek P. Kwan K. Campbell J.L. Plasmid. 1998; 39: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), or to be involved in post-transcriptional regulation (15Balandina A. Claret L. Hengge-Aronis R. Rouvière-Yaniv J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1069-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Generally, regulation requires homo- and/or hetero-protein-protein interactions, and different domains involved in these associations have been described: coiled-coiled (16Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar), the RING-B box coiled-coil, renamed recently TRIM (17Peng H. Begg G.E. Schultz D.C. Friedman J.R. Jensen D.E. Speicher D.W. Rauscher III, F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1139-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), EHV1 motif (18Ball L.J. Jarchau T. Oschkinat H. Walter U. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), or the Eps15 homology domain (19Confalonieri S. Di Fiore P.P.

Bacillus subtilis phage Φ29 has a linear double-stranded DNA with a terminal protein (TP) 1The abbreviations used are: TP, terminal protein; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; GGH, tripeptide glycine-glycine-histidine; DSS, disuccinimidyl suberate; IPTG, isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside; wt, wild type; PVDF, polyvinylidene fluoride; OD, oligomerization domain; DBD, DNA binding domain; M̄ w, a, apparent weight average molecular weights 1The abbreviations used are: TP, terminal protein; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; GGH, tripeptide glycine-glycine-histidine; DSS, disuccinimidyl suberate; IPTG, isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside; wt, wild type; PVDF, polyvinylidene fluoride; OD, oligomerization domain; DBD, DNA binding domain; M̄ w, a, apparent weight average molecular weights covalently linked to the 5′ ends. Φ29 DNA replication starts by recognition of the origins of replication, i.e. the TP-containing DNA ends, by a TP/DNA polymerase heterodimer (20Salas M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 39-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Protein p6 is a viral nonspecific DNA-binding protein that is involved in different DNA processes forming a nucleoprotein complex that plays an essential role in the initiation of Φ29 DNA replication activating the replication origins (21Pastrana R. Lázaro J.M. Blanco L. Garcı́a J.A. Méndez E. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 3083-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 22Serrano M. Gutiérrez J. Prieto I. Hermoso J.M. Salas M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1879-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This complex has been shown to cover most of the Φ29 genome, suggesting that p6 may also have a structural role in organizing the genome (23Gutiérrez C. Freire R. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Also, it has been demonstrated that protein p6 is involved in regulating the viral transcription; binding of protein p6 to the right genomic end represses transcription from the early C2promoter (see Fig. 1) (24Whiteley H.R. Ramey W.D. Spiegelman G.B. Holder R.D. Virology. 1986; 155: 392-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 25Barthelemy I. Mellado R.P. Salas M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 460-462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Camacho A. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28927-28932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition, it cooperates with the regulatory viral protein p4 in the switch from early to late transcription (27Elı́as-Arnanz M. Salas M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2502-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 28Camacho A. Salas M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6060-6070Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar); as a result, the A2b and A2c early promoters are repressed, and the late A3 promoter is activated. Thus, proteins like p4 or p6 help to coordinate and regulate the main viral processes. On the other hand, under conditions of limiting amounts of the viral DNA and replication proteins (DNA polymerase, TP, single-stranded DNA-binding protein, and protein p6),in vitro Φ29 DNA amplification is stimulated by the presence of the gene 17 product, protein p17 (29Crucitti P. Lázaro J.M. Benes V. Salas M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 223: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Gene 17, located at the right end of the Φ29 DNA molecule (30Carrascosa J.L. Camacho A. Moreno F. Jiménez F. Mellado R.P. Viñuela E. Salas M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 66: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), encodes a 19-kDa protein involved in the in vivo viral DNA replication. In fact, when a B. subtilis non-suppressor strain (su−) was infected with the Φ29 mutantsus17 (112), a reduced phage yield and viral DNA synthesis were observed (30Carrascosa J.L. Camacho A. Moreno F. Jiménez F. Mellado R.P. Viñuela E. Salas M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 66: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 31Moreno F. Camacho A. Viñuela E. Salas M. Virology. 1974; 62: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 32Jiménez F. Camacho A. de la Torre J. Viñuela E. Salas M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 73: 57-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Moreover, when the infection was in solid medium, Φ29 mutant sus17 (112) showed a “leaky” phenotype, characterized by the late appearance of very tiny lysis plaques, suggesting that protein p17 can be partially dispensable (33Mellado R.P. Moreno F. Viñuela E. Salas M. Reilly B.E. Anderson D.L. J. Virol. 1976; 19: 495-500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that gene 17 is dispensable under conditions of high m.o.i., but it is indispensable at low m.o.i., which are probably the natural conditions for infection (29Crucitti P. Lázaro J.M. Benes V. Salas M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 223: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The C2 promoter controls protein p17 transcription and is strongly inhibited by the viral histone-like protein p6, both in vivo and in vitro (24Whiteley H.R. Ramey W.D. Spiegelman G.B. Holder R.D. Virology. 1986; 155: 392-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 25Barthelemy I. Mellado R.P. Salas M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 460-462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Camacho A. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28927-28932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This fact is probably because of the formation of a p6-DNA nucleoprotein complex at the right end of the viral genome (34Prieto I. Serrano M. Lázaro J.M. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, protein p17 is synthesized very early after infection, and its synthesis declines later on due to the inhibition of the C2 promoter by protein p6. At late times after Φ29 infection, the number of copies of protein p6 in B. subtilis cells has been calculated to be enough to cover the entire viral DNA progeny (35Abril A.M. Salas M. Andreu J.M. Hermoso J.M. Rivas G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11901-11908Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The self-association ability of protein p6 was studied by analytical ultracentrifugation at thein vivo protein p6 concentration. Protein p6 shows a monomer-dimer equilibrium that shifts to higher order association at the highest concentrations. These oligomeric structures have been proposed to act as a scaffold for the DNA into the appropriate configuration (36Abril A.M. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We were interested in analyzing the role of p17 at early infection times, when protein p6 is still limiting in the host cell. In these conditions, protein p17 seems to be required for viral DNA replication (29Crucitti P. Lázaro J.M. Benes V. Salas M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 223: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To understand further the function of protein p17, we studied its capacity to self-interact and to bind to the viral DNA-binding protein p6 under conditions that can parallel those of the beginning of infection: limiting amount of protein p6 and high amount of protein p17. In this paper we show that protein p17 self-associates both in vivo and in vitro, independently from other viral or host factors. Protein prediction suggests the existence of a 28-amino acid-long coiled-coil region, possibly involved in in vivoself-association. We also show that protein p17 interacts with the viral protein p6, facilitating the binding of protein p6 to the Φ29 DNA ends, thus probably favoring the initiation of replication and negatively modulating its own transcription. GGH cross-linking agent was purchased from Sigma, and DSS was from Pierce. Pre-stained high molecular weight protein markers were from Invitrogen. IPTG and ampicillin were from Sigma. Restriction enzymes HindIII, EcoRV, andBamHI, T4 ligase, Vent polymerase, and DNase I were from New England Biolabs; oligonucleotides were from Genset SA; dNTPs, [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol), and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were from AmershamBiosciences. The wt Φ29 bacteriophage was obtained as described (31Moreno F. Camacho A. Viñuela E. Salas M. Virology. 1974; 62: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 37Talavera A. Jiménez F. Salas M. Viñuela E. Virology. 1971; 46: 586-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). B. subtilis 110NA (try−, spoA−, su−) was used as a host (31Moreno F. Camacho A. Viñuela E. Salas M. Virology. 1974; 62: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). B. subtilis110NA cells were grown at 30 °C in LB medium to anA 560 of 0.4 and infected with wt Φ29 at m.o.i. 5 as described (29Crucitti P. Lázaro J.M. Benes V. Salas M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 223: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Infected cells were harvested 30 min after infection, washed once with 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, and concentrated 20-fold in the permeabilization buffer (50 mmHepes, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 20% sucrose). Cross-linking reaction was carried out in 100 μl with DSS at the indicated concentration, incubated for 20 min at room temperature, and quenched with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After addition of 25 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), samples were sonicated, and 15 μl of each reaction mixture was run onto 12% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE to be electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) and probed with polyclonal antibody αp17 as described (29Crucitti P. Lázaro J.M. Benes V. Salas M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 223: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Plasmid pBF21 containing the λcI gene under control of a tandemlacUV5 promoter-operator region (39Spurio R. Falconi M. Brandi A. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1795-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) was digested withHindIII and EcoRV to remove the cIgene fragment encoding for the oligomerization domain (OD). Plasmid pΔcI17w and mutants pΔcIL70A, pΔcIL70R, and pΔcIL84P were constructed by PCR from gene 17 cloned in plasmid pET17 (29Crucitti P. Lázaro J.M. Benes V. Salas M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 223: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A silent mutation in gene 17 was introduced to eliminate an internal HindIII restriction site in a two-step PCR procedure. PCR conditions are as follows: 1 μmoligonucleotides, 0.1 μg of plasmid pET17 as template, 100 μm dNTPs, and 2 units of Vent polymerase on its reaction buffer. Gene 17 was first amplified in two steps as follows: the first step with primer 5′G17 (TAGGAaagcttACACATGAATAACTAT) containing a HindIII external restriction site, and 3′consLys (CCTGGCTACAAGTTTATTGATCTC) having a single nucleotide substitution to eliminate the HindIII restriction site internal to the gene; the second step with primer 5′consLys (GAGATCAATAAACTTGTAGCCAAG) having a single mutation to substitute theHindIII site internal to the gene, and TG17 (GTTGTAACGgatatcTTACTTGTT) to introduce an EcoRV external site. Fragments were purified from agarose gel and used in a second step of PCR with external primers 5′G17 and TG17. The PCR product, consisting in gene 17 lacking internalHindIII site, was purified from agarose gel, and after digestion with HindIII and EcoRV was cloned into digested pBF21, to generate plasmid pΔcI17w, that contains a chimerical gene encoding for the DNA binding domain from the cI repressor cI(DBD) fused with the gene coding for protein p17. Gene17 point mutants of lysine at positions 70 and 84 were obtained with the same two-step PCR procedure, using the following internal primers: for mutant L70A, primers L70A (GTTGAAGAGGCAGGCACACAA) and L70Ac (TTGTGTGCCTGCCTCTTCAAC) were used; for mutant L70R, primers L70R (GTTGAAGAGCGAGGCACACAA) and L70Rc (TTGTGTGCCTCGCTCTTCAAC); and for mutant L84P, primers L84P (TTAGAAGATCGAGACGGTGAAA) and L84Pc (TTTCACCGTCTCGATCTTCTAA). Amplified fragments were cloned as described above for gene 17 lacking the internalHindIII restriction site. Escherichia coli 71-18lacIq cells were electrotransformed with the plasmids described above and grown at 37 °C up to A 620of 0.6 in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). The production of chimeric proteins was induced by addition of 250 μl of 100 mm IPTG to 0.4 ml of culture. After induction, cells were infected with λ146 hypervirulent phage (40Bailone A. Devoret R. Virology. 1978; 84: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) essentially as described (39Spurio R. Falconi M. Brandi A. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1795-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). At the indicated times, 0.4-ml aliquots were centrifuged, and the plaque-forming unit/ml was determined in each supernatant usingE. coli 71-18 lacIq as recipient strain. The experiments were performed in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge using an An60Ti rotor. Protein p17 was equilibrated in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5 (90 μl of 70 μm), and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm, and absorbance scans at 280 nm were taken at sedimentation equilibrium. The equilibrium temperature was 4 °C. High speed sedimentation (42,000 rpm) was conducted afterward for base-line correction. Whole-cell apparent weight average molecular weights (M̄ w,a) were determined by fitting a sedimentation equilibrium model for a single sedimenting solute to individual data sets with the program EQASSOC (supplied by Beckman Instruments; see Ref. 41Minton A.P. Shuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhauser Boston, Inc., Cambridge, MA1994: 81-93Crossref Google Scholar). The partial specific volume of protein p17 was 0.737 ml/g, and the monomer relative molecular mass was taken as 19,173, both of them calculated from the amino acid composition of the protein, deduced from the gene 17 sequence (42Garvey K.J. Yoshikawa H. Ito J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 40: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A value of 5,800 m−1 cm−1 was used for the extinction coefficient of protein p17 at 280 nm (43Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Purified protein p17 in phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (15 μm final concentration), was incubated in 50 μl containing 100 μm GGH-Ni(II) as cross-linking agent, at the indicated NaCl concentrations, for 5 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and, after addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer, loaded onto 12% SDS-PAGE gel, and after electrophoresis stained with Coomassie Blue. When cross-linking was performed in the presence of protein p6 (12 μm final concentration, equimolar to that of protein p17), the gel was electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P, MilliporeTM) and probed with polyclonal antibodies as described (29Crucitti P. Lázaro J.M. Benes V. Salas M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 223: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). DNase I footprinting was carried out essentially as described (44Galas D.J. Schmitz A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3157-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar). Right and left Φ29 DNA terminal fragments, obtained from clones in pBluescript vectors (obtained from V. Gonzalez-Huici), were end-labeled at the 3′ end by Klenow filling ofBamHI protruding strand. In a final volume of 25 μl containing 10 mm MgCl2, DNA fragments were added to protein p6 or to protein p6 preincubated with protein p17 at the indicated concentrations and incubated for 5 min at room temperature, before addition of 2 ng of DNase I to initiate the reaction. The digestion was allowed to proceed for 5 min at room temperature and stopped with 20 mm EDTA final concentration. DNA was ethanol-precipitated in the presence of carrier tRNA and run onto 8 m urea 6% PAGE. The viral protein p17 is required in vivo to infect B. subtilis at low m.o.i. and shows a stimulatory effect on in vitro Φ29 DNA amplification. As a step to understand protein p17 function, we have studied its oligomerization state. Extracts of B. subtiliscells infected with wt Φ29 were collected and treated with DSS as cross-linking agent and analyzed by Western blotting with α p17 polyclonal antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 2 shows protein p17 dimers formation at increasing DSS concentration. In addition, higher molecular weight complexes containing protein p17 could be detected in the presence of increasing concentrations of DSS. The high molecular weight material could correspond to protein p17 homocomplexes, although we cannot rule out the formation of heterocomplexes with other proteins. To check whether protein p17 self-association capacity was influenced by other viral and/or host components, we performed in vitroanalytical ultracentrifugation using purified protein p17 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The theoretical value for the wt protein p17 monomer is 19,173, calculated from the amino acid composition of the protein deduced from the gene 17 sequence (42Garvey K.J. Yoshikawa H. Ito J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 40: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Purified protein p17, at a concentration of 70 μm, was shown to be a dimer in solution with an average molecular weight (M̄ w,a) of 39,304 ± 400 (Fig. 3). Thus, we can conclude that protein p17 self-associates independently from other components. The in vivo accumulated protein p17 was calculated to be 15,000 molecules at 30 min post-infection (29Crucitti P. Lázaro J.M. Benes V. Salas M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 223: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), which is almost 45 μm intracellular protein p17 concentration taking into account the cell volume of 10−15 liters determined (35Abril A.M. Salas M. Andreu J.M. Hermoso J.M. Rivas G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11901-11908Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Our in vitro results at 70 μm protein concentration demonstrate that protein p17 forms dimers, in agreement with the finding of dimers in vivo. Data obtained by cross-linking with GGH-Ni(II) suggested that oligomerization of protein p17 was favored at high salt concentration. Fig. 4 A shows in vitro increasing of p17 dimer as well as oligomer formation from 50 to 200 mm salt concentration. To confirm this effect on protein p17 self-association, we performed sedimentation equilibrium studies at 50 and 200 mm NaCl. The results presented in Fig. 4 B show that at 50 mm NaCl the best fit function (line) is for a single solute of aM̄ w,a = 44,400 ± 200 and at 200 mm NaCl for a single solute of aM̄ w,a = 51,100 ± 100. As NaCl favors self-association, we can suggest that protein p17 self-association is not dependent on charged residues but possibly on hydrophobic ones. A secondary structure prediction program to look for coiled-coil domains (COILS) (16Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar) revealed that the region of p17 spanning amino acids Leu63 to Glu92 has a high probability of forming a coiled-coil structure (see Fig. 5 A). This structure is formed by repetition of seven amino acids, adopting an helical conformation, in which hydrophobic residues are arranged on one face of the helix (positions a and d of the repetition), forming a spine (see Ref. 16Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar for a review). The hypothetical coiled-coil region of protein p17 is shown in Fig. 5 B. These types of structures (see also leucine zipper motifs) (45Landshulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2535) Google Scholar, 46O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Kim P.S. Science. 1989; 243: 538-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar) are involved in protein-protein interactions, homo- and/or hetero-dimerization, by the facing of hydrophobic spines belonging to two (or more) helices in a parallel or antiparallel orientation. To test for the involvement of the coiled-coil region in protein p17 self-association, we analyzed its behavior in an in vivosystem based on the λcI repressor dimerization (39Spurio R. Falconi M. Brandi A. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1795-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The λcI repressor is a protein that binds to DNA through a DNA binding domain (DBD) at the N terminus and dimerizes through an oligomerization domain (OD) at the C terminus. Dimerization is required for an efficient binding to the operator, so that E. coli cells carrying the λcIwt gene are immune to hypervirulent phage λ146 infection, whereas those carrying only the λcI(DBD) are sensitive to the infection (see Fig. 6 A). Substitution of cI(OD) with another protein provides an assay for its self-associationin vivo. By using the plasmid pBF21 (39Spurio R. Falconi M. Brandi A. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1795-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), expressing the λcI repressor under control of the lac promoter, we constructed plasmid pΔcI17w which encodes for a fusion protein containing the λcI(DBD) at the N terminus and protein p17 at the C terminus. E. coli cells bearing plasmid pΔcI17w were induced by IPTG to express the fusion protein and were assayed for hypervirulent phage λ146 development. Cells expressing fusion protein ΔcI17w were immune to phage infection; this result suggests that protein p17 was able to self-associate efficiently in this in vivo system (see Fig. 6 A). It is interesting to notice that λ phage development was slower in the case of fusion protein ΔcI17w than in the case of the control λcIwt, suggesting that substitution of the cI(OD) with protein p17 at the C terminus gave rise to the formation of a complex of high efficiency in repression. However, the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. Expression of the fusion protein ΔcI17w was confirmed by Western blot analysis using αp17 antibody (not shown). In order to get more information on specific residues involved in the coiled-coil region of protein p17, we constructed point mutants to be tested in the in vivo system described above. Because hydrophobic residues of the helical turn have been shown to be responsible for protein-protein interaction (16Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar), and because hydrophobic forces seem to be involved in p17 self-association (Fig. 4,A and B), we mutated Leu70 into Ala and Arg and Leu84 into Pro. Fig. 6 B shows the time course development of phage λ146 resulting from infection ofE. coli cells expressing different mutant fusion proteinsversus the fusion protein carrying wt protein p17 (ΔcI17w). Substitution of Leu70 into Arg and Leu84 into Pro showed a lytic phenotype. These results indicate that repression has not been carried out, suggesting that mutant protein self-association is affected. On the other hand, change of Leu70 into Ala showed a phenotype similar to that found in cells carrying ΔcI17w. Change of Leu84 into Pro could destroy completely the helical coiled-coil structure and destabilize the protein local structure. The change of Leu70 into Arg may alter the surrounding charges at the helical spine, making self-interaction more difficult, whereas change of Leu70 into Ala seems not to have an effect in protein p17 self-association. These results suggest that Leu70 and Leu84 could be involved in protein p17 self-association. To further investigate protein p17 function, we studied its role in the viral infection system. It is known that (i) protein p17 is synthesized early from the C2 promoter; (ii) the viral histone-like protein p6 represses the C2 promoter and activates initiation of Φ29 DNA replication by forming a nucleoprotein complex; and (iii) protein p17 stimulates in vitro phage DNA replication at low doses of DNA and initiation proteins (DNA polymerase, TP, single-stranded DNA-binding protein, and protein p6). To underlie the mechanisms by which protein p17 stimulates viral DNA replication, and because protein p17 does not bind DNA (not shown), we performed protein-protein in vitro cross-linking experiments using protein p17 and different proteins involved in Φ29 initiation of replication. Equimolar concentrations of proteins p17 and p6 were cross-linked and analyzed by Western blotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The same blotting was first analyzed with αp6 antibodies and then, after stripping, with αp17 antibodies to compare hetero-oligomers bands. Fig. 7shows that when the two proteins are present, two extra bands are formed (indicated with an asterisk) that can be explained as the result of an interaction between proteins p6 and p17. It should be noticed that under the experimental conditions used, protein p6 migrates with an approximate molecular mass of 13 kDa (the theoretical one is of 11.8 kDa) and protein p17 as 23 kDa. The lower extra band of ∼36 kDa can be due to the formation of an heterodimer between one molecule of protein p6 and one of protein p17. The upper extra band (∼48 kDa) could result from interaction of two molecules of protein p6 and one of protein p17. The presence of the hetero-complexes supports the idea of a direct interaction among proteins p17 and p6. To investigate further the possible effect of protein p17 on protein p6 function, we performed DNase I footprinting experiments of protein p6 in the absence or in the presence of protein p17 with the left or the right viral DNA ends. As shown in Fig. 8, the presence of protein p6 at the viral DNA ends produces a characteristic pattern of DNase I-hypersensitive bands regularly spaced every 24 bp and protected regions in between. In the presence of protein p17 less amount of protein p6 is needed to obtain the characteristic pattern at both DNA ends. This result suggests that protein p17, through its interaction with protein p6, enhances its binding to the DNA. In this study we show that protein p17 self-associates both in vivo and in vitro. This association seems to involve hydrophobic forces and to occur through an α-helical coiled-coil sequence located between residues Leu63 and Glu92. In addition, by using anin vivo system we showed that residues Leu70 and Leu84, which are located at the hydrophobic d position of the heptad repeats, are essential for self-association. We have also demonstrated that protein p17 interacts with the viral histone-like protein p6 enhancing its DNA binding ability. Because it has been described that binding of protein p6 to DNA has a dynamic nature (23Gutiérrez C. Freire R. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we suggest that protein p17 could play an important role at the initial steps of replication (29Crucitti P. Lázaro J.M. Benes V. Salas M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 223: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) in favoring p6 binding to DNA, when its concentration is still limiting. This binding could help to activate viral DNA replication and also to repress the C2 promoter, giving rise to a negative autoregulation of protein p17."

An ATP-Mg2+·Fe2+ complex was found to act as an affinity cleavage reagent in the presence of dithiothreitol/H2O2. Selective enzyme cleavage required bound adenine nucleotide, either ATP or ADP, in the presence of Mg2+. The fragment profile included a predominant N-terminal 61-kDa fragment, a minor 37-kDa fragment, and three prominent C-terminal fragments of 39, 36, and 30 kDa. The 61-kDa N-terminal and 39-kDa C-terminal fragments were predicted to originate from cleavage within the conserved MLT558GDAVG sequence. The 37-kDa fragment was consistent with cleavage within the S4/M4 sequence PVGLPA340V, while the 30-kDa and 36-kDa C-terminal fragments appeared to originate from cleavage in or around sequences D646TGIAVE and DMPGS595ELADF, respectively. The latter are spatially close to the highly conserved motif GD634GVND638APSL and conserved residues Thr558 and Lys615, which have been implicated in coordinating Mg2+ and ATP.

This study provides support for a three-dimensional organization of the phosphorylation region of the yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase that is consistent with, but not identical to, typical P-type enzymes. The fungal plasma membrane H+-ATPase is a typical P-type, class II, non-heavy metal-transporting enzyme. The catalytic cycle of the H+-ATPase, like all P-type membrane ATPases, comprises several transient phosphorylated forms that are tightly coupled to the binding or dissociation of transported ions at distant transport sites (1Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Google Scholar). The catalytic ATP hydrolysis domain is comprised of two interacting segments, a larger central segment of ∼340 amino acid residues, extending from transmembrane segments M4-M5, containing the nucleotide-binding domain and site of phosphorylation (Asp378) and a smaller interacting domain of ∼127 amino acid residues extending from M2-M3. Both domains contain large amounts of β-strand and alternating β-strand and α-helix regions as seen in the recent crystal structure of the related Ca2+-ATPase from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA1a) (2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Google Scholar). The catalytic region shows conservation with a large superfamily of hydrolases that are structurally typified by thel-2-haloacid dehalogenases (3Hisano T. Hata Y. Fujii T. Liu J.Q. Kurihara T. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20322-20330Google Scholar, 4Aravind L. Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 127-129Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanism of these pumps will require atomic structures of several of the key conformational intermediates within the transport cycle. As a first step, it is important to confirm the molecular architecture of the nucleotide binding region in the related P-type pumps and dissect the subtle structural differences that contribute to their catalytic behavior.The oxidative cleavage of proteins by oxygen radicals generated by tightly bound Fe2+(3+) or Cu2+ has been used to probe interacting protein structure elements in a number of nucleotide-binding proteins (5Goldshleger R. Patchornik G. Shimon M.B. Tal D.M. Post R.L. Karlish S.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 387-399Google Scholar, 6Mustaev A. Kozlov M. Markovtsov V. Zaychikov E. Denissova L. Goldfarb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6641-6645Google Scholar). The process appears to involve cleavage of peptide bonds in close proximity to bound metals by the local formation of oxygen radicals, most likely OH radicals, by the Fenton reaction or a reactive metal-peroxyl derivative (7Stadtman E.R. Berlett B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17201-17211Google Scholar, 8Stadtman E.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 797-821Google Scholar). In the presence of Fe3+ or Cu2+, ascorbate or DTT 1The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight; ACP, acetyl phosphate; SERCA1a, calcium ATPase of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum 1The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight; ACP, acetyl phosphate; SERCA1a, calcium ATPase of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum promotes the generation of reactive oxygen species (⋅OH, O 2−, H2O2, and ferryl ion). Because several peptide bonds are cleaved from the same Fe2+ site, these cleavage positions must be in proximity in the native protein. For this reason, it has been useful in mapping the architecture of the active center of various metal-binding enzymes (5Goldshleger R. Patchornik G. Shimon M.B. Tal D.M. Post R.L. Karlish S.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 387-399Google Scholar,6Mustaev A. Kozlov M. Markovtsov V. Zaychikov E. Denissova L. Goldfarb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6641-6645Google Scholar). This approach is also highly sensitive to the conformational state of the protein and can be used to assess changes in interacting protein structure elements. Karlish and co-workers have used this approach of oxidative cleavage to probe the spatial organization of the renal Na+,K+-ATPase in definedE 1 and E 2 conformations (9Patchornik G. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11954-11959Google Scholar, 10Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16213-16221Google Scholar, 11Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9596-9601Google Scholar). In this study, Fe2+ associated with ATP and Mg2+ has been used to probe the architecture of the phosphorylation region of the yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase by analyzing peptide fragments generated by oxidative cleavage.DISCUSSIONFe2+-catalyzed cleavage has been used as a valuable tool to explore local protein structure interactions associated with binding of free metal and metal-nucleotide complexes in animal P-type ATPases (5Goldshleger R. Patchornik G. Shimon M.B. Tal D.M. Post R.L. Karlish S.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 387-399Google Scholar, 9Patchornik G. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this study, metal associated with nucleotide was used to explore the molecular architecture of the phosphorylation domain of the yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase. Free metal produced nonspecific enzyme degradation, while selective cleavage occurred only under conditions that promoted ATP binding (Fig. 2). Only ATP and ADP in the presence of Mg2+ and Fe2+ produced selective cleavage events. An E 1 state was sufficient for cleavage as trapping the enzyme in other conformational states with vanadate or with transition state mimics such as fluoroaluminate or beryllofluoride had no influence on the cleavage pattern. Blocking the adenine binding pocket by pretreatment of the H+-ATPase with 8-azido-ATP abolished cleavage with ATP, while neither inorganic phosphate nor acetyl phosphate, which is readily hydrolyzed by the H+-ATPase (20Wang G. Perlin D.S. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 309-315Google Scholar), promoted cleavage in the presence of Fe2+. Unlike other P-type enzymes, Fe2+substitutes poorly for Mg2+ in the hydrolysis reaction (1–2% of maximal activity) presumably because nucleotide binding, which is normally weak (K d ∼ mm range) under optimal conditions (equimolar Mg2+ and ATP), is diminished in the absence of Mg2+. Trace amounts of iron-induced cleavage were observed in the absence of Mg2+, even with equimolar ATP and Fe2+ in the mmrange, but maximal cleavage was obtained only under optimal nucleotide binding conditions. Excess Mg2+ reduced the cleavage reaction as the molar amount of Mg2+ was increased over that of ATP at a fixed Fe2+ concentration. It is important to note that the cleavage pattern did not change with time, rather the intensity of each fragment increased (Fig. 1) suggesting that the cleavage reaction occurred at a fixed locus. In addition, since large stable fragments were generated, it is likely that the metal-nucleotide complex is lost following the initial cleavage events. Thus, the fragments produced effectively defined a fixed conformational state.The architecture of the nucleotide binding and phosphorylation domains of P-type enzymes has been illuminated in recent years by the recognition of an apparent similarity with the haloacid dehalogenase and related enzymes (4Aravind L. Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 127-129Google Scholar, 21Ridder I.S. Dijkstra B.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 223-226Google Scholar, 24Collet J.F. Stroobant V. Van Schaftingen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33985-33990Google Scholar) and more significantly by the emergence of a 2.6-Å high resolution structure of the Ca2+-ATPase (2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Google Scholar). Critical residues responsible for coordinating metal-nucleotide complexes have been identified in conserved sequence motifs, which for yeast PMA1 include CSD378KTGTLT, containing the site of phosphorylation (Asp378), RVXMLT558GD, PQXK615XXVVE, and TGD634GVND638APXL. These sequence stretches all lie within the large central cytoplasmic domain bordered by M4 and M5. The spatial organization of these critical residues for ATP binding and hydrolysis are shown in Fig.4, which represents a superposition model of the yeast H+-ATPase on a SERCA1a template (25Soteropoulos P. Valiakhmetov A. Kashiwazaki R. Perlin D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16265-16270Google Scholar). The phosphorylation site (Asp378) is >25 Å away from the bound nucleotide, and domain closure within this region is presumed to occur to facilitate phosphate transfer (2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Google Scholar). Additional domain movements occur during catalysis that bring other conserved sequences into close proximity with this region, such as TGE233S on the cytoplasmic loop between M2 and M3 (9Patchornik G. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11954-11959Google Scholar).Since Fe2+ cleavage is dependent on bound nucleotide, it is likely that the cleavage sites should help define protein structure in close proximity to the nucleotide, which should better define similarities and differences between the yeast H+-ATPase and related P-type enzymes. Antibody directed to the N terminus ofPMA1 revealed a prominent fragment at ∼61 kDa and a minor fragment at 37 kDa. A C-terminal-directed antibody identified three prominent fragments of 30, 36, and 39 kDa. The N-terminal fragments, which were marked with a polyhistidine tag, were purified by nickel chromatography, and analysis of the fragments by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy yielded two prominent fragment masses of 61,479–62,351 Da and 37,488 Da. Given these apparent masses, it can be assumed that cleavage resulting in the 61-kDa fragment occurred within the region consisting of amino acids MLT558GDAVG, which includes the highly conserved Thr558. The minor 37-kDa fragment represented cleavage within PVGLPA340V, which is near the interface region between membrane-spanning helix 4 (M4) and stalk 4 (S4). The prominent C-terminal fragments were more difficult to isolate. Their sizes and identity could only be inferred from their migration behavior by SDS-gel electrophoresis (Figs. 1 and 2) and peptide antibody evaluation (Table I). The 30-kDa fragment would correspond to cleavage around D646TGIAVE, which is near to the highly conserved motif GD634GVND638APSL. The 36-kDa fragment would correspond to the region DMPGS595ELADF, which lies between the regions containing conserved residues Thr558 and Lys615. Interestingly, 22 residues of SERCA1a in this region are absent in PMA1, which would tend to bring these two highly conserved residues closer together in real space. Finally, the 39-kDa fragment would correspond to cleavage within LT558GDAVGIAKET, which contains the highly conserved Thr558 and is consistent with cleavage producing the 61-kDa N-terminal fragment.It is noteworthy that prominent cleavage occurred in or around conserved regions GXRVXKLT558GD, D591MPGS, and GD634GVND638APSLKK suggesting that these regions were in most direct contact to the bound Fe2+-nucleotide complex. Fig. 4 shows the close proximity of this region to the site of phosphorylation (ASP378). Residues Thr558, Asp634, and Asp638in these sequences help coordinate the metal-nucleotide complex, as is apparent in the phosphorylation domain of haloacid dehalogenases (2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Google Scholar, 4Aravind L. Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 127-129Google Scholar,21Ridder I.S. Dijkstra B.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 223-226Google Scholar) In this model, substrate binding is mediated by Thr558and a Mg2+ ion, which presumably shields the negatively charged phosphate group. Mg2+ is believed to be coordinated by oxygen atoms from Asp378 and Asp634 (21Ridder I.S. Dijkstra B.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 223-226Google Scholar). In the Na+,K+-ATPase, the conserved sequence TGD710GVND contributes to coordination of Mg2+during transfer of γ-phosphate to Asp369 in theE 1 form of the enzyme. In contrast, the transition from E 1P toE 2P in coupling with Na+ is accompanied by a shift of Mg2+ binding away from Asp710 and Asn713 (26Scarborough G.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 517-522Google Scholar). Lys615 is expected to help coordinate the carboxylate group of Asp378in the enzyme-substrate complex. It is likely that in the presence of nucleotide, Fe2+ and Mg2+ are complexed by the key residues described in this local structure. As further validation, conserved amino acids Thr384, Asp634, Asp638, Thr558, and Lys615 inPMA1 were modified by site-directed mutagenesis. In all cases, conservative and non-conservative substitutions resulted in reduced activity even when enzymes were poorly assembled, confirming the importance of these residues for enzymatic function in H+-ATPase. Overall, these data suggest that the phosphorylation domain of the yeast H+-ATPase conforms to typical P-type spatial architecture.Despite the gross spatial similarity of coordinating residues, subtle differences in catalytic site architecture are expected given the kinetic differences between the H+-ATPase and related P-type family members. Some of these differences are apparent in the superposition model (Fig. 4) where the backbone trace of the SERCA1a pump is used to display conserved, non-conserved, and absent residues. The model serves to illustrate that while overall features are conserved, important differences are apparent that distinguish the two enzymes and most likely explain their differential kinetic properties. While considerable structural homology exists between the various enzymes, there are important differences between the N and P domains. In particular, the large amount of diversity in the nucleotide binding domain of the enzyme, including large stretches of absent sequence inPMA1 is striking. The affinity of the H+-ATPase for ATP is considerably weaker than its animal cell counterparts. When compared with the SERCA1a enzyme, ∼24% of the structure from Ala326 near the interface of M4 to Arg751 near M5 (more than 100 residues) is absent in the yeast H+-ATPase. These large deletions are expected to contribute to the kinetic diversity observed between H+-ATPase and other P-type pumps (26Scarborough G.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 517-522Google Scholar).The adenosine binding pocket in the N-domain is reasonably well defined. Derivatization of Lys492 or Lys515(SERCA1a) interferes specifically with binding and delivery of ATP substrate to the catalytic site but does not necessarily disrupt the catalytic mechanism. Yet binding of a reagent like 4-diisothioryano-2,2 disulfonic acid stilbene (DIDS) to these residues effectively closes the nucleotide pocket and prevents proper interaction of the N and P domains (27Hua S. Ma H. Lewis D. Inesi G. Toyoshima C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2264-227228Google Scholar). Both Lys492 and Lys515 are conserved in the yeast H+-ATPase as is Arg511, which is equivalent to Arg544(Na+,K+-ATPase) or Arg560(SERCA1a). These residues appear to play a critical role in ATP binding in the Na+,K+-ATPase (28Pedersen P.A. Jorgensen J.R. Jorgensen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37588-37595Google Scholar) and Ca2+-ATPase (27Hua S. Ma H. Lewis D. Inesi G. Toyoshima C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2264-227228Google Scholar). In the Na+,K+-ATPase, reduced affinity for ATP was observed with mutation of residue Arg544, as well as nearby residues Asp555, Glu556, Asp565, and Asp567 (29Jorgensen P.L. Pedersen P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1505: 57-74Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the region Leu551–Glu568, which is upstream from the cluster of residues important for nucleoside binding and which contains most of these acidic residues, is absent in the yeast PMA1enzyme.It is also important to note that there are some significant differences between our findings on the yeast H+-ATPase and those of Karlish and colleagues on the Na+,K+-ATPase (5Goldshleger R. Patchornik G. Shimon M.B. Tal D.M. Post R.L. Karlish S.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 387-399Google Scholar, 9Patchornik G. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11954-11959Google Scholar, 11Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9596-9601Google Scholar, 22Shimon M.B. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34190-34195Google Scholar, 23Goldshleger R. Bar Shimon M. Or E. Karlish S.J. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1998; 643: 89-97Google Scholar). Firstly, there is no evidence for a metal binding site in the absence of nucleotide. In the Na+,K+-ATPase, it was suggested that Fe2+ binding occurs at a site, HFIH, in stalk segment 3 just above M3. However, we created the equivalent site in the yeast PMA1 (286HFTE → HFIH) but failed to detect any specific cleavage at this or any other site even at elevated Fe2+ levels (>500 μm). More significantly, oxidative cleavage was observed in the conserved motif TGE214SE in the Na+,K+-ATPase in the E 2 state providing strong evidence for interacting domains (9Patchornik G. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11954-11959Google Scholar). Similar evidence for interacting domains was not obtained in our study. The simplest interpretation is that Fe2+ associated with nucleotide was not in close enough proximity to the interacting loop bound by M2 and M3 during catalysis even when the enzyme was inhibited by vanadate, BeF3, or AlF3.Finally, a minor N-terminal cleavage product of 37 kDa was readily observed (Figs. 1 and 2) and could be purified by polyhistidine affinity chromatography. Surprisingly, cleavage is predicted to occur within PVGLPA340V, which is near the interface region between membrane-spanning helix 4 (M4) and stalk 4 (S4). This result suggests that this region during catalysis may move closer to the site of phosphorylation than would be anticipated, perhaps further indicating that M4 also undergoes a significant displacement. The fungal plasma membrane H+-ATPase is a typical P-type, class II, non-heavy metal-transporting enzyme. The catalytic cycle of the H+-ATPase, like all P-type membrane ATPases, comprises several transient phosphorylated forms that are tightly coupled to the binding or dissociation of transported ions at distant transport sites (1Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Google Scholar). The catalytic ATP hydrolysis domain is comprised of two interacting segments, a larger central segment of ∼340 amino acid residues, extending from transmembrane segments M4-M5, containing the nucleotide-binding domain and site of phosphorylation (Asp378) and a smaller interacting domain of ∼127 amino acid residues extending from M2-M3. Both domains contain large amounts of β-strand and alternating β-strand and α-helix regions as seen in the recent crystal structure of the related Ca2+-ATPase from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA1a) (2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Google Scholar). The catalytic region shows conservation with a large superfamily of hydrolases that are structurally typified by thel-2-haloacid dehalogenases (3Hisano T. Hata Y. Fujii T. Liu J.Q. Kurihara T. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20322-20330Google Scholar, 4Aravind L. Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 127-129Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanism of these pumps will require atomic structures of several of the key conformational intermediates within the transport cycle. As a first step, it is important to confirm the molecular architecture of the nucleotide binding region in the related P-type pumps and dissect the subtle structural differences that contribute to their catalytic behavior. The oxidative cleavage of proteins by oxygen radicals generated by tightly bound Fe2+(3+) or Cu2+ has been used to probe interacting protein structure elements in a number of nucleotide-binding proteins (5Goldshleger R. Patchornik G. Shimon M.B. Tal D.M. Post R.L. Karlish S.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 387-399Google Scholar, 6Mustaev A. Kozlov M. Markovtsov V. Zaychikov E. Denissova L. Goldfarb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6641-6645Google Scholar). The process appears to involve cleavage of peptide bonds in close proximity to bound metals by the local formation of oxygen radicals, most likely OH radicals, by the Fenton reaction or a reactive metal-peroxyl derivative (7Stadtman E.R. Berlett B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17201-17211Google Scholar, 8Stadtman E.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 797-821Google Scholar). In the presence of Fe3+ or Cu2+, ascorbate or DTT 1The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight; ACP, acetyl phosphate; SERCA1a, calcium ATPase of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum 1The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight; ACP, acetyl phosphate; SERCA1a, calcium ATPase of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum promotes the generation of reactive oxygen species (⋅OH, O 2−, H2O2, and ferryl ion). Because several peptide bonds are cleaved from the same Fe2+ site, these cleavage positions must be in proximity in the native protein. For this reason, it has been useful in mapping the architecture of the active center of various metal-binding enzymes (5Goldshleger R. Patchornik G. Shimon M.B. Tal D.M. Post R.L. Karlish S.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 387-399Google Scholar,6Mustaev A. Kozlov M. Markovtsov V. Zaychikov E. Denissova L. Goldfarb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6641-6645Google Scholar). This approach is also highly sensitive to the conformational state of the protein and can be used to assess changes in interacting protein structure elements. Karlish and co-workers have used this approach of oxidative cleavage to probe the spatial organization of the renal Na+,K+-ATPase in definedE 1 and E 2 conformations (9Patchornik G. Goldshleger R.

In this study, Fe2+ associated with ATP and Mg2+ has been used to probe the architecture of the phosphorylation region of the yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase by analyzing peptide fragments generated by oxidative cleavage. DISCUSSIONFe2+-catalyzed cleavage has been used as a valuable tool to explore local protein structure interactions associated with binding of free metal and metal-nucleotide complexes in animal P-type ATPases (5Goldshleger R.

It is important to note that the cleavage pattern did not change with time, rather the intensity of each fragment increased (Fig. 1) suggesting that the cleavage reaction occurred at a fixed locus.
