https://openalex.org/W1658991581,"Abstract 1. An enzyme, has been purified to apparent homogeneity from extracts of Proteus vulgaris, NCTC 4636, which was adapted on a medium containing chondroitin sulfate C. It has the following properties. (a) At pH 8, it degrades chondroitin sulfates A, B, and C at greater rates than chondroitin and hyaluronic acid. It does not attack keratosulfate, heparin, or heparitin sulfate. (b) It carries out an elimination reaction, yielding Δ4,5-unsaturated disaccharides. (c) In the crude extract it is accompanied by two different types of sulfatase, which are removed during purification. 2. The two sulfatases, chondro-4-sulfatase and chondro-6-sulfatase, have been separated from chondroitinase-ABC and from each other; both are required for the hydrolytic desulfation of chondroitinase products, Δ4,5-unsaturated disaccharide sulfates. They do not attack polymer chondroitin sulfates, hexa-, penta-, tetra-, or trisaccharides derived from chondroitin sulfates A and C by digestion with crude testicular hyaluronidase, or acetylgalactosamine 4-and 6-sulfates. One of these enzymes, chondro-4-sulfatase, catalyzes the conversion of Δ4,5-unsaturated disaccharide 4-sulfate (i.e. the product from the degradation of chondroitin sulfate A or B by chondroitinase-ABC) and its saturated analogue (i.e. acetylchondrosin 4-sulfate) to the corresponding nonsulfated disaccharides and inorganic sulfate, but does not attack Δ4,5-unsaturated disaccharide 6-sulfate (i.e. the product from the degradation of chondroitin sulfate C by chondroitinase-ABC) or its saturated analogue (i.e. acetylchondrosin 6-sulfate). In contrast, chondro-6-sulfatase carries out the desulfation of the disaccharide 6-sulfates and acetylgalactosamine 4,6-disulfate at position 6 while it does not attack the disaccharide 4-sulfate isomers. 3. Another type of chondroitinase, chondroitinase-AC, has been purified also to apparent homogeneity from extracts of Flavobacterium heparinum, ATCC 13125, which was adapted on a medium containing chondroitin sulfate C. Its properties have been compared with those of chondroitinase-ABC from P. vulgaris. (a) Unlike chondroitinase-ABC, it has no measurable activity with chondroitin sulfate B; like chondroitinase-ABC it carries out essentially the same reactions with chondroitin sulfates A and C, chondroitin, and hyaluronic acid. (b) In the crude extract it is accompanied by an enzyme similar to chondroitinase-ABC, an enzyme similar to chondro-4-sulfatase, and a glucuronidase which hydrolyzes the β-glucuronidic bond of unsaturated disaccharides but not the bond of saturated disaccharides. All these accompanying enzymes are removed during purification."

We believe that this enzymic defect is responsible for the accumulation of ganglioside GM(1) and is the fundamental enzyme defect in generalized gangliosidosis."
https://openalex.org/W2091844374,"The pineal organ of the house sparrow, Passer domesticus, is essential for persistence of the circadian locomotor rhythm in constant conditions. Upon removal of the pineal body, activity becomes arrhythmic. However, pinealectomy does not abolish the rhythm of locomotor activity in birds exposed to light-dark cycles. Pinealectomized birds are entrained by light cycles in much the same manner as are normal birds. Our data demonstrate that the pineal organ is a crucial component of the endogenous time-measuring system of the sparrow."
https://openalex.org/W1503648662,"Abstract By means of enzymatic digestion with chondroitinase-ABC, a novel unsaturated disaccharide bearing two sulfate residues has been derived from chondroitin sulfate of squid cartilage. Various data, particularly the formation of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(β-d-gluco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-4-O-sulfo-d-galactose and its 6-O-sulfate isomer by hydrolysis with chondro-6-sulfatase and chondro-4-sulfatase, respectively, and the formation of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-4,6-di-O-sulfo-d-galactose by mild acid hydrolysis, indicate that the two sulfate residues are located at positions 4 and 6 of the hexosamine moiety. A distinct unsaturated disaccharide also bearing two sulfate residues has been obtained from chondroitin sulfate B preparations of bovine lung and pig skin. One of the sulfate residues has been shown to be substituted at position 4 of the hexosamine moiety. The resistance of the second residue to both chondro-4-sulfatase and chondro-6-sulfatase and of the uronic acid moiety to Flavobacterium heparinum glucuronidase suggests that the sulfate residue is substituted at position 2 or 3 of the uronic acid moiety. These disulfated disaccharides are, therefore, isomers of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(2- or 3-O-sulfo-β-d-gluco-4-ene-pyranosyluronic acid)-6-O-sulfo-d-galactose, the compound previously found in the digest of chondroitin sulfate from shark cartilage. The three isomeric disulfated disaccharides were separated from nonsulfated and monosulfated homologues and from one another by paper chromatography in 1-butyric acid-0.5 n ammonia (5:3). The separation of disaccharides from chondroitinase digests by paper chromatography permits comparison of chondroitinase digests from different chondroitin sulfate preparations and detection of slight variations in the types of sulfate linkage."
https://openalex.org/W1506245646,"Most of the studies on yeast invertase have been concerned only with the external enzyme (a mannan protein which is localized in the cell wall), but recently it has been reported that the invertase inside the cytoplasmic membrane is a smaller form. This paper presents a comparative study of the distribution of invertase isozymes in two stains of yeast and, after the selection of the best conditions and source, the purification of the internal or small enzyme. The major purification is obtained by chromatography on diethylaminoethyl Sephadex, although ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel filtration in Sephadex G-200 are also used to separate the large and small enzymes. The purified internal invertase is homogeneous on the basis of chromatographic criteria and its behavior in the analytical ultracentrifuge. The molecular weight of the enzyme is approximately 135,000, and the specific activity is 2,900 units per mg of protein."
https://openalex.org/W1672879977,"Fibroblasts derived from normal human skin and from cells in amniotic fluid and grown in tissue culture have cystathionine synthase activity. Skin from homocystinuric patients gives rise to fibroblast lines with normal activities of methionine-activating enzyme, but with very low or undetectable cystathionine synthase activity. Thus, the enzyme lesion in homocystinuria is demonstrable in readily available human cells. Neither cystathionine synthase nor methionine-activating enzyme could be detected in intact normal skin."
https://openalex.org/W2090278031,"Alligator Purkinje cells generate action potentials in the peripheral dendritic tree, after synaptic depolarization via superficial parallel fibers. These action potentials are inhibited at the dendrite level by preceding parallel-fiber volleys at close intervals. We conclude that this inhibition is produced by the activation of the inhibitory interneurons of the molecular layer, the stellate cells, which establish synaptic contacts with the dendrites of the Purkinje cells."
https://openalex.org/W1591098852,"Abstract The administration of penicillamine to rats causes an accumulation of soluble collagen in soft tissues. The preponderance of α components in the tropocollagen subunits isolated indicates a lack of intramolecular cross-links, while the marked solubility of the collagen fibers in 0.5 m NaCl reflects the absence of covalent intermolecular bonds. Penicillamine does not affect the rate of synthesis of tropocollagen, but blocks almost quantitatively the formation of new insoluble collagen. In addition, it accelerates the turnover of the pre-existing insoluble material by presumably cleaving intermolecular bonds, which stabilize the fibrous structure. It will inhibit or retard fibrillogenesis in vitro, or cause a redissolution of the formed fibers upon cooling, depending on its concentration in the medium."
https://openalex.org/W1621536383,"Abstract 1. The heterogeneity of cytochrome c obtained in the monomeric form from different organs of rat was studied. Disc electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel revealed the presence of four forms in heart muscle, liver, and kidney. In the kidney, the mean percentage distribution was Cy I 86.2%, Cy II 8.0%, Cy III 4.2%, and Cy IV 1.6%. 2. The rate at which radioactive iron (59Fe) is incorporated into cytochrome c of heart and kidney was followed in rats in a metabolic steady state. It was found that the isotope was taken up into Cy I at a rate which was approximately 30 times higher in the kidney than in the heart, which is comparable with the difference in the rate of DNA synthesis and cell turnover in these two organs. Furthermore, it was shown that the first fraction to become labeled was Cy I. Thus a distinct heterogeneity of 59Fe labeling of Cy I to Cy III was observed in the kidney, and the change in the degree of labeling as a function of time revealed the characteristics of a precursor-product relationship. This result supports previous observations indicating that only Cy I represents molecules synthesized by the cells, and that Cy II to Cy III are formed from Cy I by simple conversion in vivo. Based on previous studies on multiple forms of bovine heart cytochrome c, as well as on the conversion of rat kidney Cy I in vitro, it is concluded that the chemical basis for the in vivo conversion is a deamidation of asparagine or glutamine residues, or both. 3. The true life span of cytochrome c in the kidney was calculated to be approximately 80 days when based upon the conversion of Cy I into Cy II to Cy III. This value is in good agreement with the rate of conversion as determined in vitro (t½ = 95 days) at 37° and in an electrolyte solution corresponding to the intracellular fluid. From a functional point of view, however, the life span is even longer since Cy III also is capable of electron transfer in biological systems, even though it is less efficient than Cy I and Cy II. 4. The results are discussed in relation to the more general problems concerning the determination of protein turn-over within mammalian tissues. It is stressed that, when dealing with enzymes, one has to differentiate between a physicochemical and a functional turnover, since the rates of these two processes are not necessarily the same."
https://openalex.org/W1528920781,"Abstract Spinach chloroplasts very actively incorporated radioactivity from UDP-galactose-14C into lipids. Among the products formed, monogalactosyl and digalactosyl diglycerides together with a third compound, tentatively identified as the trigalactosyl diglyceride, contained 95% of the total lipid radioactivity. Chloroplasts from young leaves showed higher enzymic activity than those obtained from mature leaves. Dissociation of the enzymes from the acceptors was accomplished by acetone powder preparation of the chloroplasts. It was shown that diolein could serve as an efficient acceptor for the monogalactosyl diglyceride synthesis but not for the digalactosyl diglyceride synthesis. Monogalactosyl diglyceride, naturally found in chloroplasts, was shown to be the acceptor for the second galactosylation. Incubation of radioactive digalactosyl diglyceride with the acetone powder of spinach chloroplasts resulted in the formation of trigalactosyl diglyceride when cold UDP-galactose was used as the substrate. Evidence indicated that two enzymes were involved in galactolipid synthesis in spinach chloroplasts. The enzyme responsible for the synthesis of monogalactosyl diglyceride was more tightly bound to the membranes than the enzyme synthesizing digalactosyl diglyceride. Particles from etiolated pea leaves as well as other nonchlorophyllous tissues were shown to contain active enzymes that synthesize the galactolipids. A light-induced increase in the enzyme activity was observed in pea leaves."
https://openalex.org/W1541686953,"Abstract Effects of cortisol on rat and rabbit lymphoid cells incubated in vitro have been studied. Cells either obtained from cortisol-treated rats or exposed to cortisol in vitro at concentrations of 1 x 10-8 to 1 x 10-5 m showed a diminished degree of incorporation of radioactive precursors into RNA, DNA, and protein. The onset of the effects of cortisol added in vitro was gradual and the effects increased in magnitude with time. Removal of steroid from the cell suspension did not alter the degree of inhibition that already existed. However, with further incubation after removal of steroid there was no further progression or diminution of the inhibitory effect. Cells were not affected when incubated with steroid at 2°. The gradual onset of the effects of cortisol added in vitro was not eliminated by increasing steroid concentration or by varying of several other parameters. In studies with the use of thymocytes with prelabeled RNA, DNA, or protein, incubation with cortisol did not enhance degradation or produce leakage from the cell of the macromolecules. The relative order of sensitivity of lymphoid cells to cortisol added in vitro was as follows: rat thymocytes, rabbit mesenteric node cells, rat mesenteric node cells, and rabbit thymocytes. The steroid inhibitory effects on rabbit node cells also occurred when cells were stimulated in vitro by a thymic fraction containing thymosin, a lymphocytopoietic factor. Thymocytes incubated in vitro after exposure to cortisol in vivo or in vitro exhibited decreased incorporation of precursors into the trichloracetic acid-soluble as well as the trichloracetic acid-insoluble fraction. Medium requirements and the time course for effects on both fractions were the same. Cortisol added in vitro also inhibited α-aminoisobutyric acid and 1-aminocyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid uptake. The data presented indicate a steroid influence on amino acid transport as well as on intracellular accumulation of phosphorylated nucleosides and guanine."

When the depth is less than about 5 millimeters the crown that is ejected is more unstable than that from a splash on a deep liquid. As the depth is decreased from 25 to 7 millimeters, there is an increase in the maximum height to which the Rayleigh jet rises, and in the number of drops that break away from the jet. With depths less than 7 millimeters these two quantities fall off sharply, and no jet drops are produced for depths less than about 3 millimeters."
https://openalex.org/W2139697139,"Pollen of the ozone-sensitive tobacco variety Bel W-3 undergoes a reduction in germination rate and tube elongation when exposed to ozone. As little as 0.1 part of ozone per million for a 5.5-hour exposure period is sufficient to cause a 40 to 50 percent reduction in germination and a 50 percent reduction in pollen-tube elongation. Ozone causes these effects to approximately the same degree whether the pollen is exposed to ozone in vitro or agar disks, or in vivo when the intact plant is exposed. Exposure to ozone at a concentration of 1.0 part per million for more than 3 hours in vitro completely prevents germination of Bel W-3 pollen."

With these compounds as substrates for propionyl-CoA carboxylase, the deuterium isotope effect was found to be small and probably secondary. No tritium isotope effect was observed when enzymatically prepared 2-3H-propionyl-CoA was used as substrate. The rate of release of tritium was the same as that of the over-all reaction. Tritium from 3H2O was not incorporated into propionyl-CoA in the absence of the reverse reaction. The data were consistent with a concerted mechanism in which an α-proton was removed simultaneously with carboxylation of propionyl-CoA. By various techniques the reaction was shown to proceed with retention of configuration about the α-carbon."

https://openalex.org/W2020013460,"Rats exposed to heat learn to take showers and thus defend themselves against hyperthermia; thereafter the rate of showering is a direct function of ambient temperature. The showering effectively replaces spreading of saliva as the major defense against heat in desalivate rats, and appears to be highly preferred to the use of saliva by the intact animal. Since rats will work to obtain heat when cold, it is now clear that learned behavior is effective and physiologically appropriate for thermoregulation at temperatures both above and below the neutral range."
https://openalex.org/W1573437493,"Abstract The non-nucleotide product formed in the hydroxylamine kinase reaction, previously shown to be catalyzed by pyruvate kinase, has been identified as O-phosphorylhydroxylamine. The reaction exhibits an absolute requirement for bicarbonate, a nucleoside triphosphate (which cannot be replaced by phosphoenolpyruvate), and a divalent metal (Mn++ or Zn++, but not Mg++ ions). N-Methylhydroxylamine and, to a lesser extent, N,N-dimethylhydroxylamine also undergo phosphorylation, whereas the O-methyl derivative does not. The Michaelis constants of adenosine triphosphate, bicarbonate, and hydroxylamine for pyruvate kinase from rabbit skeletal muscle are 1.7 x 10-3 m, 1.9 x 10-2 m, and 2.4 x 10-2 m, respectively. A study of the effects of bicarbonate and hydroxylamine on the kinetics of the pyruvate kinase reaction showed that these compounds are apparently bound at the site which binds pyruvate or phosphoenolpyruvate but do not interact with the site which binds adenosine diphosphate or adenosine triphosphate. Bicarbonate, which is significantly inhibitory at physiological concentrations, is a competitive inhibitor with respect to phosphoenolpyruvate in the presence of either Mg++ or Mn++ ions. With the latter metal the Ki of bicarbonate is 0.02 m. Hydroxylamine exhibited mixed inhibition with respect to phosphoenolpyruvate with Mg++ ions present and uncompetitive inhibition with Mn++ ions, whereas an equimolar mixture of hydroxylamine and bicarbonate gave mixed inhibition kinetics with either of these metals. On the other hand, hydroxylamine, bicarbonate, or both compounds together showed no significant inhibitory kinetic effects with respect to adenosine diphosphate, with either metal present. No evidence was obtained that N-hydroxycarbamate, formed by the reaction of bicarbonate with hydroxylamine, serves as the substrate in the hydroxylamine kinase reaction. It is proposed that bicarbonate and hydroxylamine occupy the pyruvate-binding site of the enzyme and that Zn++ or Mn++ ions form a complex with the nitrogen atom of hydroxylamine, thereby polarizing the N—O bond and increasing the likelihood of a nucleophilic attack on the terminal phosphorus atom of adenosine triphosphate by the oxygen atom of hydroxylamine with the formation of O-phosphorylhydroxylamine and adenosine diphosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1551963644,"Abstract 1. The rate of inactivation of phosphorylase b by isocyanate is affected by various ligands which bind to the enzyme. 2. AMP, the activator of the enzyme, decreases the rate of inactivation in proportion to the amount added. 3. The substrates, Pi and glucose-1-P, and the competitive inhibitor, UDP-glucose, by themselves have no effect on the rate of inactivation by isocyanate but in the presence of AMP they provide further protection. 4. The allosteric inhibitors, ATP, ADP, and glucose-6-P, do not affect the rate of inactivation but they antagonize the protection offered by AMP. 5. The interrelationships among these ligands are analogous to those previously seen in kinetic studies. They have been interpreted on the basis of the proposed model for allosteric transitions between two conformational states. This interpretation assumes that the enzyme in these different conformations is inactivated at different rates by isocyanate. 6. Glycogen caused only a slight effect on the rate of inactivation by isocyanate and its possible role in allosteric transitions is difficult to assess at this time. 7. The protection against isocyanate inactivation has been used to calculate an apparent dissociation constant of 2 x 10-4 m for AMP and the free enzyme. Similarly, the apparent dissociation constants for enzyme already associated with AMP were calculated to be 2.3 mm for UDP-glucose, 6 mm for glucose-1-P, and 11 mm for Pi. Comparisons with dissociation constants determined by other means have been presented and discussed. 8. Studies on the binding of AMP to phosphorylase b by the ultracentrifugal separation or equilibrium dialysis methods indicated positive homotropic cooperativity between the two binding sites. ATP inhibits the binding while glucose-1-P improves it."

https://openalex.org/W1622355915,"Abstract By chromatography on diethylaminoethyl Sephadex, three enzyme fractions with pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase activity have been separated from extracts of normal or regenerating liver of rats. Two of these probably represent isoenzymes of uridine phosphorylase. Both are phosphate-dependent and both exhibit maximal activities toward uridine, deoxyuridine, and thymidine at pH values of 7.9 to 8.2, 6.4 to 6.8, and 5.6 to 5.8, respectively. One isoenzyme is of nuclear origin, whereas the other is predominantly of cytoplasmic origin. At the pH optimum of the respective substrates, as well as at physiological pH, both isoenzymes catalyze the phosphorolysis of uridine at a more rapid rate than the phosphorolysis of deoxyuridine and are much less active toward thymidine. The third enzyme, thymidine phosphorylase, is mainly of cytoplasmic origin. It is also phosphate-dependent; it is most active toward deoxyuridine at pH 5.8 and toward thymidine at pH 5.4, but shows no activity toward uridine or deoxycytidine. It has more deoxyuridine- than thymidine-cleaving activity over the pH range studied, but is probably the enzyme mainly responsible for catalyzing the phosphorolysis of thymidine in liver cells. Under the standard conditions of assay the specific activities of the nuclear and cytoplasmic uridine phosphorylases were found to be increased about 3-fold when assayed in the presence of uridine, deoxyuridine, or thymidine 6 hours after the injection of uridine. Six hours after the injection of cytidine the specific activities of both enzymes with each of the three substrates were increased about 2-fold. Concomitantly, the specific activity of thymidine phosphorylase when assayed with deoxyuridine or thymidine was not changed by uridine injection but was decreased after the injection of cytidine."

https://openalex.org/W1821428993,"Abstract Addition of small amounts of Ca++ to liver mitochondria incubated in the absence of phosphate or acetate results in an inhibition of respiration. The inhibition of respiration is reversed by increasing the concentration of substrate anions in the medium, and is enhanced by increasing the ionic strength or the pH of the medium. The H+:O and Ca++:O ratios are increased severalfold when measured under conditions of inhibited respiration. Furthermore, mitochondria which have entered a state of inhibited respiration continue to take up Ca++ and to release H+. It is concluded that the above stoichiometries in the absence of phosphate or acetate are determined by both uninhibited and inhibited respirations. The higher the concentration of Ca++, the larger is the contribution of the inhibited respiration. In the presence of acetate, the Ca++ to total oxygen ratio is in the region of 2.0 to 2.5 with succinate as substrate. The inhibition of respiration is related to the increase of the intramitochondrial pH as followed kinetically with the bromthymol blue technique. The bromthymol blue response is dependent on the rate of influx of anions. Increasing the ionic strength and pH enhances the bromthymol blue response, presumably by restraining the influx of anions. The mechanism by which the inhibition of respiration causes the superstoichiometric ratios is discussed."
