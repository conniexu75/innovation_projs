https://openalex.org/W2009800174,"Development of the acute and chronic inflammatory responses known as gout and pseudogout are associated with the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) or calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals, respectively, in joints and periarticular tissues. Although MSU crystals were first identified as the aetiological agent of gout in the eighteenth century and more recently as a 'danger signal' released from dying cells, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying MSU- or CPPD-induced inflammation. Here we show that MSU and CPPD engage the caspase-1-activating NALP3 (also called cryopyrin) inflammasome, resulting in the production of active interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18. Macrophages from mice deficient in various components of the inflammasome such as caspase-1, ASC and NALP3 are defective in crystal-induced IL-1beta activation. Moreover, an impaired neutrophil influx is found in an in vivo model of crystal-induced peritonitis in inflammasome-deficient mice or mice deficient in the IL-1beta receptor (IL-1R). These findings provide insight into the molecular processes underlying the inflammatory conditions of gout and pseudogout, and further support a pivotal role of the inflammasome in several autoinflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2090859543,"The inflammasome is a complex of proteins involved in the activation of the innate immune system, an evolutionarily ancient antimicrobial defence found in most multicelled animals. When activated the inflammasome sets in motion a cascade of events that leads to the production of active molecules including interleukins. Three papers in this issue report the identification of endogenous danger signals and bacterial components that activate inflammasomes containing cryopyrin (also known as NALP3). Mariathasan et al. show that cryopyrin activates the inflammasome in response to bacterial toxins and to ATP. Kanneganti et al. show that cryopyrin is activated by bacterial RNA and by the immune response modifiers R837 and R848. And Martinon et al. show that gout-associated uric acid crystals have a similar effect. In sum these results show that cryopyrin has a vital role in host antibacterial defences and may act as a sensor of cellular stress. In addition, this work provides insight into the mechanisms of autoinflammatory disorders in which abnormalities in the innate immune system have been implicated. A crucial part of the innate immune response is the assembly of the inflammasome, a cytosolic complex of proteins that activates caspase-1 to process the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18. The adaptor protein ASC is essential for inflammasome function1,2, binding directly to caspase-1 (refs 3, 4), but the triggers of this interaction are less clear. ASC also interacts with the adaptor cryopyrin (also known as NALP3 or CIAS1)5,6. Activating mutations in cryopyrin are associated with familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome, Muckle–Wells syndrome and neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease, diseases that are characterized by excessive production of IL-1β5,7. Here we show that cryopyrin-deficient macrophages cannot activate caspase-1 in response to Toll-like receptor agonists plus ATP, the latter activating the P2X7 receptor to decrease intracellular K+ levels8,9. The release of IL-1β in response to nigericin, a potassium ionophore, and maitotoxin, a potent marine toxin, was also found to be dependent on cryopyrin. In contrast to Asc-/- macrophages, cells deficient in the gene encoding cryopyrin (Cias1-/-) activated caspase-1 and secreted normal levels of IL-1β and IL-18 when infected with Gram-negative Salmonella typhimurium or Francisella tularensis. Macrophages exposed to Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus or Listeria monocytogenes, however, required both ASC and cryopyrin to activate caspase-1 and secrete IL-1β. Therefore, cryopyrin is essential for inflammasome activation in response to signalling pathways triggered specifically by ATP, nigericin, maitotoxin, S. aureus or L. monocytogenes."

In addition, this work provides insight into the mechanisms of autoinflammatory disorders in which abnormalities in the innate immune system have been implicated. Missense mutations in the CIAS1 gene cause three autoinflammatory disorders: familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome, Muckle–Wells syndrome and neonatal-onset multiple-system inflammatory disease1. Cryopyrin (also called Nalp3), the product of CIAS1, is a member of the NOD-LRR protein family that has been linked to the activation of intracellular host defence signalling pathways2,3. Cryopyrin forms a multi-protein complex termed ‘the inflammasome’, which contains the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) and caspase-1, and promotes caspase-1 activation and processing of pro-interleukin (IL)-1β (ref. 4). Here we show the effect of cryopyrin deficiency on inflammasome function and immune responses. Cryopyrin and ASC are essential for caspase-1 activation and IL-1β and IL-18 production in response to bacterial RNA and the imidazoquinoline compounds R837 and R848. In contrast, secretion of tumour-necrosis factor-α and IL-6, as well as activation of NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) were unaffected by cryopyrin deficiency. Furthermore, we show that Toll-like receptors and cryopyrin control the secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 through different intracellular pathways. These results reveal a critical role for cryopyrin in host defence through bacterial RNA-mediated activation of caspase-1, and provide insights regarding the pathogenesis of autoinflammatory syndromes."

https://openalex.org/W2073629764,"Environmental and genetic aberrations lead to neural tube closure defects (NTDs) in 1 out of every 1,000 births. Mouse and frog models for these birth defects have indicated that Van Gogh-like 2 (Vangl2, also known as Strabismus) and other components of planar cell polarity (PCP) signalling might control neurulation by promoting the convergence of neural progenitors to the midline. Here we show a novel role for PCP signalling during neurulation in zebrafish. We demonstrate that non-canonical Wnt/PCP signalling polarizes neural progenitors along the anteroposterior axis. This polarity is transiently lost during cell division in the neural keel but is re-established as daughter cells reintegrate into the neuroepithelium. Loss of zebrafish Vangl2 (in trilobite mutants) abolishes the polarization of neural keel cells, disrupts re-intercalation of daughter cells into the neuroepithelium, and results in ectopic neural progenitor accumulations and NTDs. Remarkably, blocking cell division leads to rescue of trilobite neural tube morphogenesis despite persistent defects in convergence and extension. These results reveal a function for PCP signalling in coupling cell division and morphogenesis at neurulation and indicate a previously unrecognized mechanism that might underlie NTDs."

Here we analyse the results of this communication and show that tandem running is an example of teaching, to our knowledge the first in a non-human animal, that involves bidirectional feedback between teacher and pupil. This behaviour indicates that it could be the value of information, rather than the constraint of brain size, that has influenced the evolution of teaching."

https://openalex.org/W1966308718,"Although cell invasion is a necessary early step in cancer metastasis, its regulation is not well understood. We have previously shown, in human prostate cancer, that transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)-mediated increases in cell invasion are dependent upon activation of the serine/threonine kinase, p38 MAP kinase. In the current study, downstream effectors of p38 MAP kinase were sought by first screening for proteins phosphorylated after TGFβ treatment, only in the absence of chemical inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase. This led us to investigate mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK2), a known substrate of p38 MAP kinase, as well as heat-shock protein 27 (HSP27), a known substrate of MAPKAPK2, in both PC3 and PC3-M human prostate cells. After transient transfection, wild-type MAPKAPK2 and HSP27 both increased TGFβ-mediated matrix metalloproteinase type 2 (MMP-2) activity, as well as cell invasion, which in turn was inhibited by SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase. Conversely, dominant-negative MAPKAPK2 blocked phosphorylation of HSP27, whereas dominant-negative MAPKAPK2 or mutant, non-phosphorylateable, HSP27 each blocked TGFβ-mediated increases in MMP-2, as well as cell invasion. Similarly, knock down of MAPKAPK2, HSP27 or both together, by siRNA, also blocked TGFβ-mediated cell invasion. This study demonstrates that both MAPKAPK2 and HSP27 are necessary for TGFβ-mediated increases in MMP-2 and cell invasion in human prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1999641808,"Glioblastoma multiforme is a highly invasive tumor bearing a dismal prognosis. Experimental strategies that focus on the specific biological cues governing the invasive capacity of these tumors may hold significant therapeutic promise. In this context, we describe the in vitro and in vivo association of the cell surface chemokine receptor, CXCR4, with the development of an invasive phenotype in malignant glioblastoma. We demonstrate that invasive populations of glioma cells overexpress CXCR4 at the message and protein levels, and that this expression ranges from 25- to 89-fold higher than that found in noninvasive tumor cells. Furthermore, neutralization of CXCR4 significantly impairs the in vitro invasive capacity of malignant glial cells. In addition, glioma cells secrete CXCL12 and demonstrate robust invasive capacity toward a CXCL12 gradient in vitro. These findings underscore the importance of CXCR4 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of invasive glioblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2008985630,"The Z-disk of striated and cardiac muscle sarcomeres is one of the most densely packed cellular structures in eukaryotic cells1. It provides the architectural framework for assembling and anchoring the largest known muscle filament systems by an extensive network of protein–protein interactions, requiring an extraordinary level of mechanical stability. Here we show, using X-ray crystallography, how the amino terminus of the longest filament component, the giant muscle protein titin, is assembled into an antiparallel (2:1) sandwich complex by the Z-disk ligand telethonin. The pseudosymmetric structure of telethonin mediates a unique palindromic arrangement of two titin filaments, a type of molecular assembly previously found only in protein–DNA complexes. We have confirmed its unique architecture in vivo by protein complementation assays, and in vitro by experiments using fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The model proposed may provide a molecular paradigm of how major sarcomeric filaments are crosslinked, anchored and aligned within complex cytoskeletal networks."

https://openalex.org/W2006964316,"Relapses following chemotherapy are a major hindrance to patients’ survival in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To investigate the role of the hematopoietic niche in the chemoresistance of leukemic cells, we examined two pathways: one mediated by adhesion molecules/integrins, and the other by soluble factors of the morphogen Wnt pathway. In our study, both the adhesion of leukemic blasts to fibronectin and the addition of Wnt antagonists induced, independently, resistance of AML cells to daunorubicin in a cell survival assay. Using pharmacological inhibitors and siRNA, we showed that both resistance pathways required the activity of the glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). Moreover, the AML cell protection downstream of GSK3β was mediated by NF-κB. A link between the adhesion and the Wnt pathway was found, as adhesion of U937 on human osteoblasts, a component of the hematopoietic niche, triggered the secretion of the Wnt antagonist sFRP-1 and supported resistance to daunorubicin. The osteoblast-conditioned medium could also confer chemoresistance to U937 cells cultured in suspension, and this cell protective effect was abrogated after depletion of sFRP-1. In the context of this potential double in vivo resistance, modulators of the common signal GSK3β and of its target NF-κB could represent important novel therapeutic tools."

https://openalex.org/W2040991087,"p21(Cip1/WAF1) is a known inhibitor of the short-gap filling activity of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) during DNA repair. In agreement, p21 degradation after UV irradiation promotes PCNA-dependent repair. Recent reports have identified ubiquitination of PCNA as a relevant feature for PCNA-dependent DNA repair. Here, we show that PCNA ubiquitination in human cells is notably augmented after UV irradiation and other genotoxic treatments such as hydroxyurea, aphidicolin and methylmethane sulfonate. Intriguingly, those DNA damaging agents also promoted downregulation of p21. While ubiquitination of PCNA was not affected by deficient nucleotide excision repair (NER) and was observed in both proliferating and arrested cells, stable p21 expression caused a significant reduction in UV-induced ubiquitinated PCNA. Surprisingly, the negative regulation of PCNA ubiquitination by p21 does not depend on the direct interaction with PCNA but requires the cyclin dependent kinase binding domain of p21. Taken together, our data suggest that p21 downregulation plays a role in efficient PCNA ubiquitination after UV irradiation."
https://openalex.org/W1993002855,"Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells of the head and neck specifically express collagenase-3 (matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13)), the expression of which correlates with their invasion capacity. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) enhances MMP-13 and collagenase-1 (MMP-1) expression and invasion of SCC cells via p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Here, we have examined the role of Smad signaling in regulating MMP-13 expression and in invasion of head and neck SCC cells. Treatment with TGF-β resulted in activation of Smad2 and Smad3 in SCC cells, but had no effect on their proliferation or viability. Basal activation of Smad3 and p38 was noted in SCC cells without exogenous TGF-β stimulation, and adenoviral delivery of Smad7 and dominant-negative Smad3 inhibited p38 activation in these cells. Adenoviral overexpression of Smad3 augmented the upregulatory effect of TGF-β on MMP-13 expression by SCC cells. Disruption of Smad signaling by adenoviral expression of kinase-defective TGF-β type I receptor (activin-receptor-like kinase-5), Smad7, and dominant-negative Smad3 potently suppressed the basal and TGF-β-induced expression of MMP-13 and MMP-1 in SCC cells, and inhibited their basal and TGF-β-induced invasion through Matrigel and type I collagen. Adenoviral overexpression of Smad7 in cutaneous and oral SCC cells significantly inhibited their implantation in skin of SCID mice and growth of xenografts in vivo, as compared to LacZ adenovirus-transduced control cells. Together, these results show that Smad signaling plays an important role in promoting the invasive phenotype of human head and neck SCC cells by upregulating their collagenase expression."
https://openalex.org/W2006177211,"N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4HPR), a synthetic retinoid effective in cancer chemoprevention and therapy, is thought to act via apoptosis induction resulting from increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. As ROS can activate MAP kinases and protein kinase C (PKC), we examined the role of such enzymes in 4HPR-induced apoptosis in HNSCC UMSCC22B cells. 4HPR increased ROS level within 1 h and induced activation of caspase 3 and PARP cleavage within 24 h. Activation of MKK3/6 and MKK4, JNK, p38 and ERK was detected between 6 and 12 h, increased up to 24 h and preceded apoptosis. 4HPR-induced activation of these kinases was abrogated by the antioxidants BHA and vitamin C. SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, suppressed 4HPR-induced c-Jun phosphorylation, cytochrome c release from mitochondria and apoptosis. Suppression of JNK1 and JNK2 using siRNA decreased, whereas overexpression of wild type-JNK1 enhanced 4HPR-induced apoptosis. PD169316, a p38, inhibitor suppressed phosphorylation of Hsp27 and apoptosis. PD98059, an MEK1/2 inhibitor, also suppressed ERK1/2 activation and apoptosis induced by 4HPR. Likewise, PKC inhibitor GF109203X suppressed ERK and p38 phosphorylation and PARP cleavage. These data indicate that 4HPR-induced apoptosis is triggered by ROS increase, leading to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein serine/threonine kinases JNK, p38, PKC and ERK, and subsequent apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2122757904,"The neurosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) at 1 nM protects NMDA-/GABAA-receptor negative neural crest-derived PC12 cells from apoptosis. We now report that membrane-impermeable DHEA-BSA conjugate replaces unconjugated DHEA in protecting serum-deprived PC12 cells from apoptosis (IC50=1.5 nM). Protection involves phosphorylation of the prosurvival factor Src and induction of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and is sensitive to pertussis toxin. Binding assays of [3H]DHEA on isolated PC12 cell membranes revealed saturation within 30 min and binding of DHEA with a Kd of 0.9 nM. A similar binding activity was detectable in isolated membranes from rat hippocampus and from normal human adrenal chromaffin cells. The presence of DHEA-specific membrane binding sites was confirmed by flow cytometry and confocal laser microscopy of DHEA-BSA-FITC stained cells. In contrast to estrogens and progestins, glucocorticoids and androgens displaced DHEA from its membrane binding sites but with a 10-fold lower affinity than DHEA (IC50=9.3 and 13.6 nM, respectively). These agents acted as pure antagonists, blocking the antiapoptotic effect of DHEA as well as the induction of Bcl-2 proteins and Src kinase activation. In conclusion, our findings suggest that neural crest-derived cells possess specific DHEA membrane binding sites coupled to G proteins. Binding to these sites confers neuroprotection."

https://openalex.org/W2135843341,"The dopamine-D2-agonist pramipexole (PPX) was tested for blocking mitochondrial permeability transition (PT) in order to give a possible explanation for its neuroprotective effect seen in PPX-treated Parkinson's disease patients. Patch-clamp techniques for studying single-channel currents in the inner mitochondrial membrane and large-amplitude swelling of energized mitochondria were used to study PPX action on the permeability transition pore (PTP), a key player in the mitochondrial route of the apoptotic cascade. Identity of the PTP was proven by measuring the concentration-response relation for cyclosporin A-blockade (IC50=26 nM). PPX inhibits the PTP reversibly with an IC50 of 500 nM, which is close to the values determined earlier as plasma concentrations after PPX medication in patients. Interaction of PPX with the PTP is further supported by demonstrating that it abolished Ca2+-triggered swelling in functionally intact mitochondria. Blockade of the PTP by PPX was attenuated by increasing concentrations of inorganic phosphate and by acidification. We suggest that PPX could exert part of its neuroprotective effect by inhibition of the PTP and thus, probably, blocking of the mitochondrial pathway of the apoptosis cascade."

https://openalex.org/W1963554058,"Increasing evidence suggests that tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) can directly regulate cell growth and apoptosis independent of its matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)-inhibitory activity. While TIMP-1's antiapoptotic activity has been well demonstrated, conflicting data has been reported regarding TIMP-1's role in growth regulation. Here we show that TIMP-1 reduces the growth rate of human breast epithelial (MCF10A) cells by inducing cell cycle arrest at G(1). TIMP-1-mediated cell cycle arrest is associated with its downregulation of cyclin D(1) and upregulation of p27(KIP1), resulting in inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase activity necessary for phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein. We further show that TIMP-1 modulation of cyclin D(1) and p27(KIP1) is achieved through TIMP-1-mediated differential regulation of protein stability independent of growth factor signaling. We also show that TIMP-1-mediated differential regulation of cyclin D(1) and p27(KIP1) is independent of cell adhesion signaling. Whereas approximately 50% of MCF10A cells with reduced TIMP-1 expression underwent cell death following loss of cell adhesion (anoikis), TIMP-1 overexpressing cells remained viable with prominent cell cycle arrest without detectable cell death. Taken together, we propose that TIMP-1-mediated cell survival independent of cell adhesion is accompanied with cell cycle arrest in human breast epithelial cells, although cell cycle regulation may not be a prerequisite for TIMP-1 regulation of apoptosis in general."

https://openalex.org/W2095784946,"The balance between hematopoietic progenitor commitment and self-renewal versus differentiation is controlled by various transcriptional regulators cooperating with cytokine receptors. Disruption of this balance is increasingly recognized as important in the development of leukemia, by causing enhanced renewal and differentiation arrest. We studied regulation of renewal versus differentiation in primary murine erythroid progenitors that require cooperation of erythropoietin receptor (EpoR), the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Kit and a transcriptional regulator (glucocorticoid receptor; GR) for sustained renewal. However, mice defective for GR- (GRdim/dim), EpoR- (EpoRH) or STAT5ab function (Stat5ab–/–) show no severe erythropoiesis defects in vivo. Using primary erythroblast cultures from these mutants, we present genetic evidence that functional GR, EpoR, and Stat5 are essential for erythroblast renewal in vitro. Cells from GRdim/dim, EpoRH, and Stat5ab–/– mice showed enhanced differentiation instead of renewal, causing accumulation of mature cells and gradual proliferation arrest. Stat5ab was additionally required for Epo-induced terminal differentiation: differentiating Stat5ab–/– erythroblasts underwent apoptosis instead of erythrocyte maturation, due to absent induction of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-XL. This defect could be fully rescued by exogenous Bcl-XL. These data suggest that signaling molecules driving leukemic proliferation may also be essential for prolonged self-renewal of normal erythroid progenitors."
https://openalex.org/W2129547785,"The cyclolignan PPP was recently demonstrated to inhibit the activity of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), without affecting the highly homologous insulin receptor. In addition, PPP caused complete regression of xenografts derived from various types of cancer. These data highlight the use of this compound in cancer treatment. However, a general concern with antitumor agents is development of resistance. In light of this problem, we aimed to investigate whether malignant cells may develop serious resistance to PPP. After trying to select 10 malignant cell lines, with documented IGF-1R expression and apoptotic responsiveness to PPP treatment (IC50s less than 0.1 μ M), only two survived an 80-week selection but could only tolerate maximal PPP doses of 0.2 and 0.5 μ M, respectively. Any further increase in the PPP dose resulted in massive cell death. These two cell lines were demonstrated not to acquire any essential alteration in responsiveness to PPP regarding IGF-1-induced IGF-1R phosphorylation. Neither did they exhibit any increase in expression of the multidrug resistance proteins MDR1 or MRP1. Consistently, they did not exhibit decreased sensitivity to conventional cytostatic drugs. Rather, the sensitivity was increased. During the first half of the selection period, both cell lines responded with a temporary and moderate increase in IGF-1R expression, which appeared to be because of an increased transcription of the IGF-1R gene. This increase in IGF-1R might be necessary to make cells competent for further selection but only up to a PPP concentration of 0.2 and 0.5 μ M. In conclusion, malignant cells develop no or remarkably weak resistance to the IGF-1R inhibitor PPP."
https://openalex.org/W2008492030,"Our laboratory has recently reported that the enzyme phospholipase D2 (PLD2) exists as a ternary complex with PTP1b and the growth factor receptor bound protein 2 (Grb2). Here, we establish the mechanistic underpinnings of the PLD2/Grb2 association. We have identified residues Y169 and Y179 in the PLD2 protein as being essential for the Grb2 interaction. We present evidence indicating that Y169 and Y179 are located within two consensus sites in PLD2 that mediate an SH2 interaction with Grb2. This was demonstrated with an SH2-deficient GSTGrb2 R86K mutant that failed to pull-down PLD2 in vitro. In order to elucidate the functions of the two neighboring tyrosines, we created a new class of deletion and point mutants in PLD2. Phenylalanine replacement of Y169 (PLD2 Y169F) or Y179 (PLD2 Y179F) reduced Grb2 binding while simultaneous mutation completely abolished it. The role of the two binding sites on PLD2 was found to be functionally nonequivalent: Y169 serves to modulate the activity of the enzyme, whereas Y179 regulates total tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein. Interestingly, binding of Grb2 to PLD2 occurs irrespectively of lipase activity, since Grb2 binds to catalytically inactive PLD2 mutants. Finally, PLD2 residues Y169 and Y179 are necessary for the recruitment of Sos, but only overexpression of the PLD2 Y179F mutant resulted in increased Ras activity, p44/42Erk phosphorylation and enhanced DNA synthesis. Since Y169 remains able to modulate enzyme activity and is capable of binding to Grb2 in the PLD2 Y179F mutant, we propose that Y169 is kept under negative regulation by Y179. When this is released, Y169 mediates cellular proliferation through the Ras/MAPK pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2086276891,"Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) has no intrinsic enzymatic function, but functions as a sliding platform to mediate protein interactions with the DNA strand. Many proteins interact with PCNA through a small conserved motif with consensus QxxLxxFF. This work uses Schizosaccharomyces pombe and human cells to analyse the function of PCNA-binding peptides. Interacting peptides were identified using two-hybrid screening; one (pep102) binds directly to a physiologically relevant site on PCNA. The EGFP-pep102 overexpression phenotype is consistent with competitive blocking of PCNA-protein interactions. Various PCNA-binding peptides were all shown to inhibit PCNA function by competitive binding in both human and S. pombe cells as EGFP fusion proteins. The action of a p21(WAF1/Cip1)-derived peptide was complicated by the presence of additional functional domains and possible post-translational modification. The activity of pep102 was hampered by low expression in both model systems. The peptide derived from rational design (con1) was stable, highly active in inhibiting PCNA function both S. pombe and human cells and showed a high affinity for PCNA both in vitro and in vivo. These results validate the use of functional screening in yeast to identify peptide aptamers that are functional in mammalian cells; such aptamers provide excellent leads for small molecule antiproliferative therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2114848786,"This study provides evidence for the importance of p21CDKN1A for the repair of replication-mediated DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by topoisomerase I. We report that defects of p21CDKN1A and p53 enhance camptothecin-induced histone H2AX phosphorylation (γH2AX), a marker for DNA DSBs. In human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells with wild-type (wt) p53, γH2AX reverses after camptothecin removal. By contrast, γH2AX increases after camptothecin removal in HCT116 cells deficient for p53 (p53−/−) or p21CDKN1A (p21−/−) as the cells reach the late-S and G2 phases. Since p21−/− cells exhibit similar S-phase arrest as wt cells in response to camptothecin and aphidicolin does not abrogate the enhanced γH2AX formation in p21−/− cells, we conclude that enhanced γH2AX formation in p21−/− cells is not due to re-replication. The cell cycle checkpoint abrogator and Chk1/Chk2 inhibitor 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01) also increases camptothecin-induced γH2AX formation and inhibits camptothecin-induced p21CDKN1A upregulation in HCT116 wt cells. TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling) assays demonstrate that γH2AX formation in late S and G2 cells following CPT treatment corresponds to DNA breaks. However, these breaks are not related to apoptotic DNA fragmentation. We propose that p21CDKN1A prevents the collapse of replication forks damaged by stabilized topoisomerase I cleavage complexes."

A novel missense mutation with presumed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and 10 polymorphisms were identified in these samples. The novel mutation of STK11/LKB1 at nucleotide position 613 G → A, which causes the amino-acid substitution from alanine to threonine at residue 205 within the catalytic kinase domain, was identified in cell line RPMI 2650. To further determine whether this point mutation affects the gene function, constructs of the wild type and A205T mutant of the STK11/LKB1 gene expression vectors were created and transfected into RPMI 2650 cells. Our results showed that the reintroduction of the wild-type but not the mutant STK11/LKB1 construct into RPMI 2650 cells induced suppression of the cell growth. The mutation also affected the kinase activity of the Stk11/Lkb1 protein. This led us to conclude that the A205T point mutation of the STK11/LKB1 gene produces functionally inactive proteins. This is the first described mutation of the STK11/LKB1 gene in HNSCC. While the mutation frequency of the STK11/LKB1 gene in HNSCC remains to be determined in future studies, our data strongly suggests that STK11/LKB1 is involved in the carcinogenesis of HNSCC."

Other studies have described selective deletion of exon 1beta of p14(ARF) or methylation of the p16(INK4A) promoter. Therefore, it is unclear from these studies whether loss of p16(INK4A) and/or p14(ARF) contributes to the development of T-ALL. To elucidate the relative contribution of the ink4a/arf locus to T-cell leukemogenesis, we mated our tal1 transgenic mice to ink4a/arf-/-, p16(ink4a)-/-, and p19(arf)-/- mice and generated tal1/ink4a/arf+/-, tal1/p16(ink4a)+/-, and tal1/p19(arf)+/- mice. Each of these mice developed T-cell leukemia rapidly, indicating that loss of either p16(ink4a) or p19(arf) cooperates with Tal1 to induce leukemia in mice. Preleukemic studies reveal that Tal1 expression stimulates entry into the cell cycle and thymocyte apoptosis in vivo. Interestingly, mice expressing a DNA-binding mutant of Tal1 do not exhibit increases in S phase cells. The S phase induction is accompanied by an increase in thymocyte apoptosis in tal1 transgenic mice. Whereas apoptosis is reduced to wild-type levels in tal1/ink4a/arf-/- mice, S phase induction remains unaffected. Thus, Tal1 stimulates cell cycle entry independent of the ink4a/arf locus, but its ability to induce apoptosis is Ink4a/Arf-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W1971117660,"Dysregulated expression of the homeobox gene, HOX11 is a frequent etiologic event in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias. HOX11-transgenic mice (IgHμ-HOX11Tg)-expressing HOX11 in the B-cell compartment develop B-cell lymphomas with extended latency. The latency suggests that additional genetic events are required prior to the onset of malignant lymphoma. We report the identification of 17 HOX11 collaborating genes, revealed through their propensity to be targeted in a proviral insertional mutagenesis screen. Seven integrations disrupted genes in mitotic spindle checkpoint control, suggesting that cells with elevated HOX11 expression are especially sensitive to dysregulation of chromosome segregation during mitosis. IgHμ-HOX11Tg primary B-lymphocyte cultures exposed to the aneugenic agents, colchicine and colcemid, exhibited increased incidences of chromosome missegregation as assessed by cytokinesis-block micronucleus assays. Additionally, IgHμ-HOX11Tg cultures were shown to exhibit aberrant bypass of spindle checkpoint arrest, as assessed by the increased presence of cycling cells determined by assessment of DNA content and by BrdU immunolabelling. Western immunoblotting revealed elevated expression of the mitotic effector molecules, cyclin A, cyclin B1 and cdc20 in IgHμ-HOX11Tg cultures. Moreover, spontaneously arising lymphoid neoplasms in IgHμ-HOX11Tg mice frequently exhibit aberrant expression of mitotic regulators, concomitant with increased development of micronuclei, abnormal mitotic checkpoint control and increased incidences of abnormal karyotypes when expanded in culture. Collectively, these findings indicate that abnormal regulation of spindle checkpoint control as a result of HOX11 overexpression leads to a heightened predisposition for development of aneuploidy, contributing to oncogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2165170086,"Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) plays important roles in tumor development. Especially in the early-stage colorectal tumors, COX-2 expression is often observed in the tumor stroma. However, the mechanism regulating such stromal expression of COX-2 remains unknown. In the present study, we simulated the indirect interaction between epithelial cells and stromal cells in the process of colorectal tumor development using an in vitro co-culture model in which NIH3T3 fibroblasts were co-cultured with ‘sparsely’ or ‘densely’ populated intestinal epithelial cells, Intestine-407 as a model of premalignant or benign intestinal epithelial cells, and DLD-1 and Caco-2 as models of malignant epithelial cells. COX-2 expression in NIH3T3 fibroblasts was upregulated when co-cultured with the ‘dense’ epithelial cells regardless of their character. Interestingly, there was pericellular hypoxia in the vicinity of NIH3T3 fibroblasts when co-cultured with ‘dense’ epithelial cells, and the recovery of the partial pressure of oxygen level resulted in the reduction of enhanced COX-2 expression only in NIH3T3 fibroblasts co-cultured with ‘dense’ Intestine-407 cells. Furthermore, COX-2 expression was also reduced by the inhibition of transcription factor AP-1. Thus, pericellular hypoxia of the stromal cells caused by densely populated epithelial cells may be one of the potent COX-2 enhancers before completion of malignant transformation during intestinal tumor development."
