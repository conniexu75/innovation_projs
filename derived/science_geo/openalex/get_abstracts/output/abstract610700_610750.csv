https://openalex.org/W2949369413,"Over the past 20 years, neuroscience research on reward-based learning has converged on a canonical model, under which the neurotransmitter dopamine 'stamps in' associations between situations, actions and rewards by modulating the strength of synaptic connections between neurons. However, a growing number of recent findings have placed this standard model under strain. We now draw on recent advances in artificial intelligence to introduce a new theory of reward-based learning. Here, the dopamine system trains another part of the brain, the prefrontal cortex, to operate as its own free-standing learning system. This new perspective accommodates the findings that motivated the standard model, but also deals gracefully with a wider range of observations, providing a fresh foundation for future research."
https://openalex.org/W2803052640,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the main cause of female infertility worldwide and corresponds with a high degree of comorbidities and economic burden. How PCOS is passed on from one generation to the next is not clear, but it may be a developmental condition. Most women with PCOS exhibit higher levels of circulating luteinizing hormone, suggestive of heightened gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release, and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) as compared to healthy women. Excess AMH in utero may affect the development of the female fetus. However, as AMH levels drop during pregnancy in women with normal fertility, it was unclear whether their levels were also elevated in pregnant women with PCOS. Here we measured AMH in a cohort of pregnant women with PCOS and control pregnant women and found that AMH is significantly more elevated in the former group versus the latter. To determine whether the elevation of AMH during pregnancy in women with PCOS is a bystander effect or a driver of the condition in the offspring, we modeled our clinical findings by treating pregnant mice with AMH and followed the neuroendocrine phenotype of their female progeny postnatally. This treatment resulted in maternal neuroendocrine-driven testosterone excess and diminished placental metabolism of testosterone to estradiol, resulting in a masculinization of the exposed female fetus and a PCOS-like reproductive and neuroendocrine phenotype in adulthood. We found that the affected females had persistently hyperactivated GnRH neurons and that GnRH antagonist treatment in the adult female offspring restored their neuroendocrine phenotype to a normal state. These findings highlight a critical role for excess prenatal AMH exposure and subsequent aberrant GnRH receptor signaling in the neuroendocrine dysfunctions of PCOS, while offering a new potential therapeutic avenue to treat the condition during adulthood."

https://openalex.org/W2803310861,"Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is an indispensable immune receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major component of the Gram-negative bacterial cell wall. Following LPS stimulation, TLR4 transmits the signal from the cell surface and becomes internalized in an endosome. However, the spatial regulation of TLR4 signaling is not fully understood. Here, we investigated the mechanisms of LPS-induced TLR4 internalization and clarified the roles of the extracellular LPS-binding molecules, LPS-binding protein (LBP), and glycerophosphatidylinositol-anchored protein (CD14). LPS stimulation of CD14-expressing cells induced TLR4 internalization in the presence of serum, and an inhibitory anti-LBP mAb blocked its internalization. Addition of LBP to serum-free cultures restored LPS-induced TLR4 internalization to comparable levels of serum. The secretory form of the CD14 (sCD14) induced internalization but required a much higher concentration than LBP. An inhibitory anti-sCD14 mAb was ineffective for serum-mediated internalization. LBP lacking the domain for LPS transfer to CD14 and a CD14 mutant with reduced LPS binding both attenuated TLR4 internalization. Accordingly, LBP is an essential serum molecule for TLR4 internalization, and its LPS transfer to membrane-anchored CD14 (mCD14) is a prerequisite. LBP induced the LPS-stimulated phosphorylation of TBK1, IKKϵ, and IRF3, leading to IFN-β expression. However, LPS-stimulated late activation of NF-κB or necroptosis were not affected. Collectively, our results indicate that LBP controls LPS-induced TLR4 internalization, which induces TLR adaptor molecule 1 (TRIF)-dependent activation of the TBK1–IKKϵ–IRF3–IFN-β pathway. In summary, we showed that LBP-mediated LPS transfer to mCD14 is required for serum-dependent TLR4 internalization and activation of the TRIF pathway.

LBP binds LPS micelles via the N-terminal basic patch and forms transient ternary complexes with secreted (sCD14) or membrane-bound GPI CD14 (mCD14) on the C terminus (17Ryu J.K. Kim S.J. Rah S.H.

Following the generation of CD14/LBP/LPS micelles, CD14 dissociates from LBP and receives monomeric LPS (17Ryu J.K. Kim S.J. Rah S.H. Kang J.I. Jung H.E. Lee D. Lee H.K. Lee J.O. Park B.S. Yoon T.Y.

In CD14-positive cells (e.g. macrophages), TLR4 is internalized in endosomes where it dissociates from MyD88 and interacts with TRIF to activate IRF3 (7Rosadini C.V. Kagan J.C.

For example, the bactericidal/permeability–increasing proteins, which show the highest structural homology to LBP, neutralize LPS and also elicit bactericidal activity against Gram-negative bacteria (27Iovine N.M.

Among the LBP/bactericidal/permeability–increasing protein family, LBP is unique in that it binds LPS micelle and transfers a monomer to CD14, which enhances the TLR4/MD-2 response (17Ryu J.K.

We previously showed that LBP is an essential mediator of TLR4/MD-2 dimerization in mCD14-expressing cells and responded to LPS (16Tsukamoto H. Fukudome K. Takao S. Tsuneyoshi N. Kimoto M.

Notably, LPS-induced type I IFN production was increased in monocytes stimulated with LBP (33Kato A. Ogasawara T. Homma T. Saito H. Matsumoto K. Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein critically regulates lipopolysaccharide-induced IFN-β signaling pathway in human monocytes.J.

However, the mechanistic details for such events have not been resolved. In this study, we investigated the serum components that mediated TLR4 internalization and demonstrated an essential role for LPS transfer by LBP to mCD14, which was required for TLR4 internalization and activation of the TRIF-mediated pathway. To identify the molecular mechanisms underlying LPS-induced TLR4 internalization, we examined the requirement for serum components using HEK293 cells expressing human TLR4/MD-2 and CD14. The surface expression of TLR4/MD-2 was assessed using flow cytometry in LPS-stimulated cells. In the presence of FCS and human serum, TLR4 was internalized upon LPS stimulation; however, internalization did not occur in the absence of serum, even in cells with mCD14 surface expression (Fig. 1, A and B). Serum dependence was also observed in the mCD14-positive macrophage cell line, RAW264, and in bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMMs) (Fig. 1, C and D). In contrast to the reduced surface expression, LPS stimulation did not change the total amount of TLR4 (Fig. 1, E and F). These findings indicate that LPS-induced TLR4/MD-2 internalization was regulated by serum components. Serum contains multiple LPS-binding molecules (5Lee C.C. Avalos A.M. Ploegh H.L.

Thus, we investigated whether LBP directly mediates the dimerization of the TLR4 extracellular domain using co-IP assays. The soluble extracellular domains of human TLR4 (sTLR4F or sTLR4G), which were complexed with HA-tagged MD-2 but lacked the transmembrane (TM) and intracellular signaling domains, were FLAG- or GFP-tagged and incubated with LPS in the presence of FLAG-tagged sCD14 and LBP. sTLR4G was immunoprecipitated with an anti-GFP Ab, and sTLR4F was detected by Western blotting using an anti-FLAG mAb. sTLR4F co-precipitated with sTLR4G following LPS incubation with LBP and sCD14 (Fig. 2). Conversely, incubation of LPS with sCD14 or LBP alone did not result in co-precipitation. Dimerization also failed to occur in the absence of LPS. These findings indicate that LBP-mediated LPS-induced TLR4 dimerization via the extracellular domain in a CD14-dependent manner. Thus, we hypothesized that LBP is an essential serum component that mediated TLR4 internalization following receptor dimerization. To test this hypothesis, HEK293 cells expressing TLR4/MD-2/CD14 were stimulated in serum-free medium with recombinant human LBP prepared from CHO cells. LBP restored LPS-induced TLR4 internalization to levels comparable with those seen in the presence of complete serum (Fig. 3, A and B).

https://openalex.org/W2883335943,"Creating typologies is a way to summarize the large heterogeneity of smallholder farming systems into a few farm types. Various methods exist, commonly using statistical analysis, to create these typologies. We demonstrate that the methodological decisions on data collection, variable selection, data-reduction and clustering techniques can bear a large impact on the typology results. We illustrate the effects of analysing the diversity from different angles, using different typology objectives and different hypotheses, on typology creation by using an example from Zambia's Eastern Province. Five separate typologies were created with principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), based on three different expert-informed hypotheses. The greatest overlap between typologies was observed for the larger, wealthier farm types but for the remainder of the farms there were no clear overlaps between typologies. Based on these results, we argue that the typology development should be guided by a hypothesis on the local agriculture features and the drivers and mechanisms of differentiation among farming systems, such as biophysical and socio-economic conditions. That hypothesis is based both on the typology objective and on prior expert knowledge and theories of the farm diversity in the study area. We present a methodological framework that aims to integrate participatory and statistical methods for hypothesis-based typology construction. This is an iterative process whereby the results of the statistical analysis are compared with the reality of the target population as hypothesized by the local experts. Using a well-defined hypothesis and the presented methodological framework, which consolidates the hypothesis through local expert knowledge for the creation of typologies, warrants development of less subjective and more contextualized quantitative farm typologies."
https://openalex.org/W2803646510,"NK cells are effector lymphocytes involved in tumor immunosurveillance; however, in patients with solid malignancies, NK cells have compromised functions. We have previously reported that lung tumor-associated NK cells (TANKs; peripheral blood) and tumor-infiltrating NK cells (TINKs) show proangiogenic, decidual NK-like (dNK) phenotype. In this study, we functionally and molecularly investigated TINKs and TANKs from blood and tissue samples of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), a neoplasm in which inflammation and angiogenesis have clinical relevance, and compared them to NK cells from controls and patients with nononcologic inflammatory bowel disease. CRC TINKs/TANKs showed decreased expression for the activatory marker NKG2D, impaired degranulation activity, a decidual-like NK polarization toward the CD56brightCD16dim/−CD9+CD49+ subset. TINKs and TANKs secreted cytokines with proangiogenic activities, and induce endothelial cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, and the formation of capillary-like structures in vitro. dNK cells release specific proangiogenic factors; among which, angiogenin and invasion-associated enzymes related to the MMP9-TIMP1/2 axis. Here, we describe, for the first time, to our knowledge, the expression of angiogenin, MMP2/9, and TIMP by TANKs in patients with CRC. This phenotype could be relevant to the invasive capabilities and proangiogenic functions of CRC-NK cells and become a novel biomarker. STAT3/STAT5 activation was observed in CRC-TANKs, and treatment with pimozide, a STAT5 inhibitor, reduced endothelial cell capability to form capillary-like networks, inhibiting VEGF and angiogenin production without affecting the levels of TIMP1, TIMP2, and MMP9, indicating that STAT5 is involved in cytokine modulation but not invasion-associated molecules. Combination of Stat5 or MMP inhibitors with immunotherapy could help repolarize CRC TINKs and TANKs to anti- tumor antimetastatic ones.—Bruno, A., Bassani, B., D'Urso, D.

https://openalex.org/W2773178162,"The methylation of histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79) is an active chromatin marker and is prominent in actively transcribed regions of the genome; however, demethylase of H3K79 remains unknown despite intensive research. Here, we show that KDM2B, also known as FBXL10 and a member of the Jumonji C family of proteins known for its histone H3K36 demethylase activity, is a di- and trimethyl H3K79 demethylase. We demonstrate that KDM2B induces transcriptional repression of HOXA7and MEIS1 via occupancy of promoters and demethylation of H3K79. Furthermore, genome-wide analysis suggests that H3K79 methylation levels increase when KDM2B is depleted, which indicates that KDM2B functions as an H3K79 demethylase in vivo. Finally, stable KDM2B- knockdown cell lines exhibit displacement of NAD+-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) from chromatin, with concomitant increases in H3K79 methylation and H4K16 acetylation.

https://openalex.org/W2799483776,"Current treatment for advanced stage ovarian clear cell cancer is severely hampered by a lack of effective systemic therapy options, leading to a poor outlook for these patients. Sequencing studies revealed that ARID1A is mutated in over 50% of ovarian clear cell carcinomas. To search for a rational approach to target ovarian clear cell cancers with ARID1A mutations, we performed kinome-centered lethality screens in a large panel of ovarian clear cell carcinoma cell lines. Using the largest OCCC cell line panel established to date, we show here that BRD2 inhibition is predominantly lethal in ARID1A mutated ovarian clear cell cancer cells. Importantly, small molecule inhibitors of the BET (bromodomain and extra terminal domain) family of proteins, to which BRD2 belongs, specifically inhibit proliferation of ARID1A mutated cell lines, both in vitro and in ovarian clear cell cancer xenografts and patient-derived xenograft models. BET inhibitors cause a reduction in the expression of multiple SWI/SNF members including ARID1B, providing a potential explanation for the observed lethal interaction with ARID1A loss. Our data indicate that BET inhibition may represent a novel treatment strategy for a subset of ARID1A mutated ovarian clear cell carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2804395927,"The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of two forms (CuCO3 (CuS); and Cu nanoparticles (CuNP)) and dosages (standard 6.5 mg/kg (H), half of the standard (L)) of additional dietary Cu administered to growing rats on gastrointestinal and hepatic function and morphology. Copper in the form of CuNP vs CuS caused lower Cu faecal/urinal excretion and increased Cu accumulation in the brain tissue. Hepatic high-grade hydropic degeneration and necrotic lesions were observed only in the CuNP-H animals. In the lower gut, the dietary application of CuNP stifled bacterial enzymatic activity of caecal gut microbiota and resulted in lower SCFA production. That diminishing effect of CuNP on caecal microbiota activity was accompanied by a relative increase in the secretion of glycoside hydrolases by bacterial cells. The results showed that in comparison to Cu from CuCO3, Cu nanoparticles to a greater extent were absorbed from the intestine, accumulated in brain tissue, exerted antimicrobial effect in the caecum, and at higher dietary dose caused damages in the liver of rats."
https://openalex.org/W2803786491,"Accumulating studies have defined a role for the intestinal microbiota in modulation of host behavior. Research using gnotobiotic mice emphasizes that early microbial colonization with a complex microbiota (conventionalization) can rescue some of the behavioral abnormalities observed in mice that grow to adulthood completely devoid of bacteria (germ-free mice). However, the human infant and adult microbiomes vary greatly, and effects of the neonatal microbiome on neurodevelopment are currently not well understood. Microbe-mediated modulation of neural circuit patterning in the brain during neurodevelopment may have significant long-term implications that we are only beginning to appreciate. Modulation of the host central nervous system by the early-life microbiota is predicted to have pervasive and lasting effects on brain function and behavior. We sought to replicate this early microbe-host interaction by colonizing gnotobiotic mice at the neonatal stage with a simplified model of the human infant gut microbiota. This model consortium consisted of four infant-type Bifidobacterium species known to be commensal members of the human infant microbiota present in high abundance during postnatal development. Germ-free mice and mice neonatally-colonized with a complex, conventional murine microbiota were used for comparison. Motor and non-motor behaviors of the mice were tested at 6-7 weeks of age, and colonization patterns were characterized by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Adult germ-free mice were observed to have abnormal memory, sociability, anxiety-like behaviors, and motor performance. Conventionalization at the neonatal stage rescued these behavioral abnormalities, and mice colonized with Bifidobacterium spp. also exhibited important behavioral differences relative to the germ-free controls. The ability of Bifidobacterium spp. to improve the recognition memory of both male and female germ-free mice was a prominent finding. Together, these data demonstrate that the early-life gut microbiome, and human infant-type Bifidobacterium species, affect adult behavior in a strongly sex-dependent manner, and can selectively recapitulate the results observed when mice are colonized with a complex microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W2799622464,"Models of firing rate homeostasis such as synaptic scaling and the sliding synaptic plasticity modification threshold predict that decreasing neuronal activity (for example, by sensory deprivation) will enhance synaptic function. Manipulations of cortical activity during two forms of visual deprivation, dark exposure (DE) and binocular lid suture, revealed that, contrary to expectations, spontaneous firing in conjunction with loss of visual input is necessary to lower the threshold for Hebbian plasticity and increase miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) amplitude. Blocking activation of GluN2B receptors, which are upregulated by DE, also prevented the increase in mEPSC amplitude, suggesting that DE potentiates mEPSCs primarily through a Hebbian mechanism, not through synaptic scaling. Nevertheless, NMDA-receptor-independent changes in mEPSC amplitude consistent with synaptic scaling could be induced by extreme reductions of activity. Therefore, two distinct mechanisms operate within different ranges of neuronal activity to homeostatically regulate synaptic strength."
https://openalex.org/W2803007624,"Mutations in thin filament regulatory proteins that cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) increase myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity. Mouse models exhibit increased Ca2+ buffering and arrhythmias, and we hypothesized that these changes are primary effects of the mutations (independent of compensatory changes) and that increased Ca2+ buffering and altered Ca2+ handling contribute to HCM pathogenesis via activation of Ca2+-dependent signaling. Here, we determined the primary effects of HCM mutations on intracellular Ca2+ handling and Ca2+-dependent signaling in a model system possessing Ca2+-handling mechanisms and contractile protein isoforms closely mirroring the human environment in the absence of potentially confounding remodeling. Using adenovirus, we expressed HCM-causing variants of human troponin-T, troponin-I, and α-tropomyosin (R92Q, R145G, and D175N, respectively) in isolated guinea pig left ventricular cardiomyocytes. After 48 h, each variant had localized to the I-band and comprised ∼50% of the total protein. HCM mutations significantly lowered the Kd of Ca2+ binding, resulting in higher Ca2+ buffering of mutant cardiomyocytes. We observed increased diastolic [Ca2+] and slowed Ca2+ reuptake, coupled with a significant decrease in basal sarcomere length and slowed relaxation. HCM mutant cells had higher sodium/calcium exchanger activity, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ load, and sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2 (SERCA2) activity driven by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) phosphorylation of phospholamban. The ryanodine receptor (RyR) leak/load relationship was also increased, driven by CaMKII-mediated RyR phosphorylation. Altered Ca2+ homeostasis also increased signaling via both calcineurin/NFAT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways. Altered myofilament Ca2+ buffering is the primary initiator of signaling cascades, indicating that directly targeting myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity provides an attractive therapeutic approach in HCM."
https://openalex.org/W2803846659,"Pyrethroid-treated clothing is commonly worn for protection against mosquitoes; pyrethroids are both insecticides and repellents. Pyrethroid resistance has become increasingly common in Aedes aegypti, the vector of dengue, Zika, and other arboviruses, but it is not clear whether resistance is associated with reductions in repellency. In order to determine whether long-lasting permethrin impregnated (LLPI) clothing is protective, we used Aedes aegypti from New Orleans, LA (pyrethroid-sensitive) and San Juan, PR (resistant) to measure both lethality and repellency. PCR and Sanger sequencing were used to confirm resistance status by detecting mutations in the kdr gene at positions 1016 and 1534. Arm-in-cage trials of 100 Aedes aegypti females from both populations were performed for 10 minutes to bare arm or an arm clothed in untreated military camouflage or military camouflage impregnated with deltamethrin, permethrin, or etofenprox. Trials were repeated 4–5 times on different days. Number of landings, number of blood meals, and immediate and 24-hour mortality were recorded. Mortality was extremely low in all trials. Compared to untreated cloth, mosquitoes demonstrated a trend towards a 2%-63% reduction in landings and a statistically significant 78–100% reduction in blood feeding on pyrethroid-treated cloth for most insecticides. Effects were observed in both pyrethroid-sensitive and pyrethroid-resistant mosquito populations. Our data show that kdr mutations are associated with pyrethroid resistance but are likely not the only contributors. Pyrethroids appear to maintain repellent effect against resistant mosquitoes. This finding suggests that even in places where pyrethroid resistance is widespread, permethrin still has a role for use as a repellent on clothing to protect against mosquito bites."

https://openalex.org/W2803853298,"Purpose To compare anthropometric data (body mass index [BMI]) in patients without lithiasis to patients with symptomatic simple cholelithiasis or choledocholithiasis. Methods We retrospectively reviewed data from 147 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy between 2001–2015. Complete growth data from 98 patients was compared with anthropometric data from the population of the Czech Republic and a control group (BMI of 100 consecutive patients without biliary stones in abdominal ultrasound who were admitted to a surgical department for suspected appendicitis). Results The BMI of 75 children with simple cholelithiasis and 23 with choledocholithiasis was compared to the standard Czech pediatric population and to the control group. The median age (simple cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis) was 16 years, and 35 patients (24%) had a family history of gallstones. Types of lithiasis included multiple (n = 120), solitary (n = 11), and sludge (n = 10). Five cases had polyps and one had gallbladder dysplasia. Patients with simple cholelithiasis had significantly higher BMI compared to the control group without cholelithiasis (p<0.0001) and the standard Czech population (p = 0.03). Patients with choledocholithiasis had a mean BMI significantly higher than that of the general population (p = 0.001) and the control group (p = 0.0001). Patients with choledocholithiasis had significantly higher BMI than those with simple cholelithiasis (p = 0.03). Conclusion Patients with cholelithiasis had significantly higher BMI than the general population, and patients with choledocholithiasis had significantly higher BMI than patients with simple lithiasis. Elevated BMI is a risk factor for developing choledocholithiasis. ERCP and early laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with choledocholithiasis offer equivalent outcomes in patients with simple cholelithiasis."
https://openalex.org/W2804758746,"Metformin, the medicine most commonly prescribed for treatment of Type II diabetes, is among the most abundant pharmaceuticals being introduced into the environment. Pharmaceuticals are increasingly found in wastewater and surface waters around the world, often due to incomplete metabolism in humans and subsequent excretion in human waste. Risk analyses and exposure studies have raised concerns about potential negative impacts of pharmaceuticals at current environmental levels. Results of the present study indicate that metformin at concentrations in the range of what has been documented in freshwater systems and waste-water effluent (40 μg/L) affects aggressive behavior in adult male Betta splendens. Subjects exhibited less aggression toward a male dummy stimulus after four weeks exposure to metformin-treated water when compared to behavior measured immediately prior to their exposure, and in comparison to a separate cohort of un-exposed control fish. This effect persisted after 20 weeks exposure as well. Subjects exposed to metformin at a concentration twice that currently observed in nature (80 μg/L) exhibited an even more substantial reduction in aggressive behaviors compared to controls and pre-exposure measurements than those observed in the low-dose treatment group. Such changes in behavior have the potential to affect male fitness and possibly impact the health of natural populations of aquatic organisms exposed to the drug."

Up to date, among marine demosponges, only representatives of the Verongiida order have been known to synthetize biologically active substances as well as skeletons made of structural polysaccharide chitin. This work, to our knowledge, demonstrates for the first time that chitin is an important structural component within skeletons of non-verongiid demosponges Acarnus wolffgangi and Echinoclathria gibbosa collected in the Red Sea. Calcofluor white staining, FTIR and Raman analysis, ESI-MS, SEM, and fluorescence microscopy as well as a chitinase digestion assay were applied in order to confirm, with strong evidence, the finding of α-chitin in the skeleton of both species. We suggest that, the finding of chitin within these representatives of Poecilosclerida order is a promising step in the evaluation of these sponges as novel renewable sources for both biologically active metabolites and chitin, which are of prospective application for pharmacology and biomedicine."
https://openalex.org/W2804012949,"Despite the technological progress made with cochlear implants (CI), impedances and their diagnosis remain a focus of interest. Increases in impedance have been related to technical defects of the electrode as well as inflammatory and/or fibrosis along the electrode. Recent studies have demonstrated highly increased impedances as the result of corroded platinum (Pt) electrode contacts. This in vitro study examined the effects of Pt ions and compounds generated by corrosion of the electrode contacts of a human CI on cell metabolism. Since traces of solid Pt in surrounding cochlear tissues have been reported, the impact of commercially available Pt nanoparticles (Pt-NP, size 3 nm) on the cell culture model was also determined. For this purpose, the electrode contacts were electrically stimulated in a 0.5% aqueous NaCl solution for four weeks and the mass fraction of the platinum dissolute (Pt-Diss) was determined by mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Metabolic activity of the murine fibroblasts (NIH 3T3) and the human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells was determined using the WST-1 assay following exposure to Pt-Diss and Pt-NP. It was found that 5-50 μg/ml of the Pt-NP did not affect the viability of both cell types. In contrast, 100 μg/ml of the nanoparticles caused significant loss in metabolic activity. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed mitochondrial swelling in both cell types indicating cytotoxicity. Additionally, TEM demonstrated internalized Pt-NP in NIH 3T3 cells in a concentration dependent manner, whereas endocytosis in SH-SY5Y cells was virtually absent. In comparison with the Pt-NP, the corrosion products (Pt-Diss) with concentrations between 1.64 μg/ml and 8.2 μg/ml induced cell death in both cell lines in a concentration dependent manner. TEM imaging revealed both mitochondrial disintegration and swelling of the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that Pt ions trigger cytotoxicity in both NIH 3T3 and SH-SY5Y cell lines by interacting with the respiratory chain."
https://openalex.org/W2803993999,"Despite increased interest in physician wellness, little is known about patients' views on the topic. We explore patients' perceptions of physician wellness and how it links to patient care. This exploratory, qualitative study employed semi-structured interviews with a convenience sample of 20 patients from outpatient care settings in a western Canadian city. Using inductive thematic analysis, interview transcripts were independently coded by two authors and then discussed to ensure consensus and to abstract into higher-level themes. Three overarching premises were identified. First, patients notice cues that they interpret as signs of physician wellness. These include overt indicators, such as a physician's demeanor or physical appearance, along with a general impression about a physician's wellness. Second, patients form judgments based on what they notice, and these judgments affect patients' views about their care; feelings, such as trust, in their interactions with physicians; and actions, such as following care plans. Third, participants perceive a bi-directional link between physician wellness and patient care. Physician wellness impacts patient care, but physician wellness is also impacted by the care they provide and the challenges they face within the healthcare system. Patients' judgments regarding physician wellness may have important impacts on the doctor-patient relationship. Furthermore, patients appear to have a nuanced understanding about how physicians' work may put physicians at risk for being unwell. Patients may be powerful allies in supporting physician wellness initiatives focused on the shared responsibility of individual physicians, the medical profession, and healthcare organizations."
https://openalex.org/W2803215035,"Surgical site infections (SSI) are amongst the most common health care-associated infections and have adverse effects for patient health and for hospital resources. Although surgery guidelines recognize poor nutritional status to be a risk factor for SSI, they do not tell how to identify this condition. The screening tool Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 is commonly used at hospitals to identify patients at nutritional risk. We investigated the association between nutritional risk and the incidence of SSI among 1194 surgical patients at Haukeland University Hospital (Bergen, Norway). This current study combines data from two mandatory hospital-based registers: a) the incidence of SSI within 30 days after surgery, and b) the point-prevalence of patients at nutritional risk. Patients with more than 30 days between surgery and nutritional risk screening were excluded. Associations were assessed using logistic regression, and the adjusted odds ratio included age (continuous), gender (male/female), type of surgery (acute/elective) and score from The American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System. There was a significant higher incidence of SSI among patients at nutritional risk (11.8%), as compared to those who were not (7.0%) (p = 0.047). Moreover, the incidence of SSI was positively associated with the prevalence of nutritional risk in both simple (OR 1.76 (95% CI: 1.04, 2.98)) and adjusted (OR 1.81 (95% CI: 1.04, 3.16)) models. Answering “yes” to the screening questions regarding reduced dietary intake and weight loss was significantly associated with the incidence of SSI (respectively OR 2.66 (95% CI: 1.59, 4.45) and OR 2.15 (95% CI: 1.23, 3.76)). In conclusion, we demonstrate SSI to occur more often among patients at nutritional risk as compared to those who are not at nutritional risk. Future studies should investigate interventions to prevent both SSI and nutritional risk among surgical patients."
https://openalex.org/W2803983735,"Background The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention combining Life Review Therapy (LRT) and Memory Specificity Training (MST) (LRT-MST) to improve ego-integrity and despair among cancer patients in palliative care. Methods In this multicentre randomized controlled trial, cancer patients in palliative care were randomized to the intervention group (LRT-MST; n = 55) or waiting-list control group (n = 52). LRT-MST is a 4-session home-based psychological intervention that aims to retrieve specific positive memories, to re-evaluate life events and to reconstruct the story of a patient’s life, including the diagnosis of incurable cancer. Outcome measures were ego-integrity and despair (NEIS), psychological distress, anxiety and depression (HADS), quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL), and specificity of the autobiographical memory (AMT). NEIS, HADS and EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL were assessed at baseline (T0), 1 month later (post-treatment; T1), and at 1 month follow-up (T2). AMT was assessed at T0 and T1. Linear mixed models (intention to treat) were used to assess group differences in changes over time. Independent samples t-tests were used to assess group differences at T0, T1, and T2, and effect sizes (ES) were calculated at T1 and T2. Results The course of ego-integrity (not despair) improved significantly over time (p = .007) in the intervention group compared to the waiting-list control group, with moderate, but insignificant, effect sizes at T1 (ES = .42) and T2 (ES = .48). Compliance rate was 69% and total dropout rate was 28%, both primarily related to disease progression and death. Conclusions LRT-MST seems effective among cancer patients in palliative care to improve the course of ego-integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2803236122,"Pathogenic Neisseria are responsible for significantly higher levels of morbidity and mortality than their commensal relatives despite having similar genetic contents. Neisseria possess a disparate arsenal of surface determinants that facilitate host colonisation and evasion of the immune response during persistent carriage. Adaptation to rapid changes in these hostile host environments is enabled by phase variation (PV) involving high frequency, stochastic switches in expression of surface determinants. In this study, we analysed 89 complete and 79 partial genomes, from the NCBI and Neisseria PubMLST databases, representative of multiple pathogenic and commensal species of Neisseria using PhasomeIt, a new program that identifies putatively phase-variable genes and homology groups by the presence of simple sequence repeats (SSR). We detected a repertoire of 884 putative PV loci with maxima of 54 and 47 per genome in gonococcal and meningococcal isolates, respectively. Most commensal species encoded a lower number of PV genes (between 5 and 30) except N. lactamica wherein the potential for PV (36–82 loci) was higher, implying that PV is an adaptive mechanism for persistence in this species. We also characterised the repeat types and numbers in both pathogenic and commensal species. Conservation of SSR-mediated PV was frequently observed in outer membrane proteins or modifiers of outer membrane determinants. Intermittent and weak selection for evolution of SSR-mediated PV was suggested by poor conservation of tracts with novel PV genes often occurring in only one isolate. Finally, we describe core phasomes—the conserved repertoires of phase-variable genes—for each species that identify overlapping but distinctive adaptive strategies for the pathogenic and commensal members of the Neisseria genus."
https://openalex.org/W2803206242,"The vehicle routing problem (VRP) has a wide range of applications in the field of logistics distribution. In order to reduce the cost of logistics distribution, the distance-constrained and capacitated VRP with split deliveries by order (DCVRPSDO) was studied. We show that the customer demand, which can't be split in the classical VRP model, can only be discrete split deliveries by order. A model of double objective programming is constructed by taking the minimum number of vehicles used and minimum vehicle traveling cost as the first and the second objective, respectively. This approach contains a series of constraints, such as single depot, single vehicle type, distance-constrained and load capacity limit, split delivery by order, etc. DCVRPSDO is a new type of VRP. A new tabu search algorithm is designed to solve the problem and the examples testing show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. This paper focuses on constructing a double objective mathematical programming model for DCVRPSDO and designing an adaptive tabu search algorithm (ATSA) with good performance to solving the problem. The performance of the ATSA is improved by adding some strategies into the search process, including: (a) a strategy of discrete split deliveries by order is used to split the customer demand; (b) a multi-neighborhood structure is designed to enhance the ability of global optimization;"
https://openalex.org/W2804999808,"Consistent individual differences in behavioral tendencies (animal personality) can affect individual mate choice decisions. We asked whether personality traits affect male and female mate choice decisions similarly and whether potential personality effects are consistent across different mate choice situations. Using western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) as our study organism, we characterized focal individuals (males and females) twice for boldness, activity, and sociability/shoaling and found high and significant behavioral repeatability. Additionally, each focal individual was tested in two different dichotomous mate choice tests in which it could choose between computer-animated stimulus fish of the opposite sex that differed in body size and activity levels, respectively. Personality had different effects on female and male mate choice: females that were larger than average showed stronger preferences for large-bodied males with increasing levels of boldness/activity (i.e., towards more proactive personality types). Males that were larger than average and had higher shoaling tendencies showed stronger preferences for actively swimming females. Size-dependent effects of personality on the strength of preferences for distinct phenotypes of potential mating partners may reflect effects of age/experience (especially in females) and social dominance (especially in males). Previous studies found evidence for assortative mate choice based on personality types or hypothesized the existence of behavioral syndromes of individuals’ choosiness across mate choice criteria, possibly including other personality traits. Our present study exemplifies that far more complex patterns of personality-dependent mate choice can emerge in natural systems."
https://openalex.org/W2803440312,"Bandaging of limb wounds in horses leads to formation of exuberant granulation tissue (EGT) that retards healing due to protracted inflammation, aberrant vascularisation and delayed epithelialisation. EGT is not observed if wounds are left undressed or when wounds are on the body. A previous study showed that short-term administration of proteins derived from orf virus dampened inflammation and promoted epithelialisation of open wounds in horses. Here, we investigated the impact of orf virus interleukin-10 and vascular endothelial growth factor-E on the development and resolution of EGT. Excisional wounds were created on the forelimb of four horses, and bandages were maintained until full healing to induce EGT formation. Matching body wounds were created to ensure EGT was limited to the limb, and to differentiate the effects of the viral proteins on normal healing and on EGT formation. Viral proteins or the hydrogel vehicle control were administered topically to site-matched wounds at day 1, with repeat administration at day 8. Wound healing and EGT formation were monitored macroscopically. Wound margin samples were harvested at 2, 7 and 14 days, and at full healing, with histology used to observe epithelialisation, immunofluorescence used to detect inflammatory cells, angiogenesis and cell death, and qPCR to measure expression of genes regulating inflammation and angiogenesis. Limb wounds developed EGT, and exhibited slower healing than body wounds. Viral protein treatment did not accelerate healing at either location nor limit EGT formation in limb wounds. Treatment of limb wounds did however increase epithelialisation and angiogenesis, without dampening inflammatory cell infiltration or gene expression. The healed wounds also had less occlusion and death of blood vessels and fewer epidermal rete ridges following viral protein treatment. These findings indicate that the viral protein treatment does not suppress wound inflammation or EGT formation, but does promote vascular and epidermal repair and EGT resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2803453368,"Asthma affects ~300 million people worldwide. Despite multiple treatment options, asthma treatment remains unsatisfactory in a subset of patients. Airway obstruction is a hallmark of allergic asthma and is largely due to airway smooth muscle hypercontractility induced by airway inflammation. Identification of molecular pathways that regulate airway smooth muscle hypercontractility is of considerable therapeutic interest. We previously identified roles for milk fat globule epidermal growth factor–like 8 (Mfge8) in opposing the effects of allergic inflammation on increasing airway smooth muscle contractile force. In this study, we delineate the signaling pathway by which Mfge8 mediates these effects. By using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we show that the α8β1 integrin and the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) mediate the effects of Mfge8 on preventing IL-13–induced increases in airway contractility. Tracheal rings from mice with smooth muscle–specific deletion of α8β1 or PTEN have enhanced contraction in response to treatment with IL-13. Enhanced IL-13–induced tracheal ring contraction in Mfge8-/- mice was abolished by treatment with the PI3K inhibitor. Mechanistically, IL-13 induces ubiquitination and degradation of PTEN protein. Our findings identify a role for the Mfge8–α8β1–PTEN pathway in regulating the force of airway smooth muscle contraction in the setting of allergic inflammation.—Khalifeh-Soltani, A., Gupta, D., Ha, A., Podolsky, M.

https://openalex.org/W2804444461,"Objectives The aims of the study were to identify the associations between multimorbidity and specific physical function domains among community-dwelling adults in Singapore, and to examine sex differences in the associations. Methods This study was conducted using baseline data of 1,940 participants in the Population Health Index Survey conducted in the Central Region of Singapore from November 2015 to November 2016. Physical function was assessed using the Function Component of the Late-life Function and Disability Instrument and compared between men and women. Multiple linear regressions were conducted to examine associations between multimorbidity and different physical function domains for all participants, and in men and women separately. Results The prevalence of multimorbidity in the study population was 35.0% for adults aged 21 years and above, with no differences between men and women. Multimorbidity was associated with reduced upper extremity function, basic and advanced lower extremity function, and overall function in men and women after adjusting for demographic factors. Multimorbidity had a stronger association with advanced lower extremity function and overall physical function in women than in men. Conclusions The findings of this study indicate that multimorbidity is associated with physical function domains in men and women, and in particular advanced lower extremity for women. Effective community-based interventions need to be implemented to preserve physical function in individuals with multimorbidity to keep them functionally independent and physically active in the community. Additional focus on advanced lower extremity function for women is needed."
https://openalex.org/W2804647359,"There is a lack of knowledge about health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in Saudi patients with musculoskeletal impairment, particularly among older adult populations. Thus, the current research aimed to determine the association of knee osteoarthritis (OA) severity with knee pain (KP) and HRQoL among older patients in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.In a multicenter cross-sectional study, we recruited 209 consecutive males and females aged ≥55 years with radiographically diagnosed knee OA from five hospitals across Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. According to the Kellgren & Lawrence classification, patients were classified into two groups: mild/moderate knee OA (n = 126) and severe knee OA (n = 83). KP and HRQoL were assessed using the pain visual analogue scale (VAS) and the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), respectively. A higher score on the pain VAS and the SF-36 represented worse KP and better HRQoL, respectively.Severe knee OA was significantly associated with an increased score of 3.47 (p <.0001) points on the pain VAS compared with the score reported by patients with mild/moderate knee OA. Additionally, it was significantly associated with reduced scores of 6.83 and 5.82 (both: p <.0001) points on the physical and mental composite summary subscales of the SF-36, respectively, compared with the scores of patients with mild/moderate knee OA, even after adjusting for all covariates.Older patients with severe knee OA had significantly worse KP and reduced HRQoL compared to patients with mild/moderate knee conditions, even after controlling for confounders."
https://openalex.org/W2803754430,"Microvascular endothelial cells play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced inflammatory responses and multiple organ failure. Therefore, they represent an important target for pharmacological intervention in the treatment of sepsis. Glucocorticosteroids were widely used in the treatment of sepsis but vast evidence to support their systemic use is lacking. The limited effects of glucocorticoids in the treatment of sepsis may be explained by differential effects of drug initiated NF-κB inhibition in different cell types and insufficient drug delivery in target cells. The current study aimed therefore to investigate the effects of an endothelial targeted delivery of dexamethasone in a mouse model of endotoxemia induced by two consecutive i.p. injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). To achieve endothelial cell specific delivery of dexamethasone, we modified SAINT-O-Somes, a new generation of liposomes that contain the cationic amphiphile SAINT-C18 (1-methyl-4-(cis-9-dioleyl) methyl-pyridinium chloride, with antibodies against vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). In LPS challenged mice, the systemic administration of free dexamethasone had negligible effects on the microvascular inflammatory endothelial responses. Dexamethasone-loaded anti-VCAM-1 SAINT-O-Somes specifically localized at VCAM-1 expressing endothelial cells in the microvasculature of inflamed organs. This was associated with a marginal attenuation of the expression of a few pro-inflammatory genes in kidney and liver, while no effects in the lung were observed. This study reveals that, although local accumulation of the targeted drug was achieved, endothelial targeted dexamethasone containing anti-VCAM-1 SAINT-O-Somes exhibited marginal effects on inflammatory endothelial cell activation in a model of endotoxemia. Studies with more potent drugs encapsulated into anti-VCAM-1 SAINT-O-Somes will in the future reveal whether this delivery system can be further developed for efficacious endothelial directed delivery of drugs in the treatment of sepsis."

We evaluated whether adjunctive inhibition of MMP-9 could improve the response to standard TB treatment in a mouse model that develops necrotic lesions. Six weeks after an aerosol infection with M. tuberculosis, C3HeB/FeJ mice received standard TB treatment (12 weeks) comprising rifampin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide alone or in combination with either anti-MMP-9 antibody, etanercept (positive control) or isotype antibody (negative control) for 6 weeks. Anti-MMP-9 and the isotype control had comparable high serum exposures and expected terminal half-life. The relapse rate in mice receiving standard TB treatment was 46.6%. Compared to the standard TB treatment, relapse rates in animals that received adjunctive treatments with anti-MMP-9 antibody or etanercept were significantly decreased to 25.9% (P = 0.006) and 29.8% (P = 0.019) respectively, but were not different from the arm that received the isotype control antibody (25.9%). Immunostaining demonstrated localization of MMP-9 primarily in macrophages in both murine and human lung tissues infected with M. tuberculosis, suggesting the importance of MMP-9 in TB pathogenesis. These data suggest that the relapse rates in M. tuberculosis-infected mice may be non-specifically improved by administration of antibodies in conjunction with standard TB treatments. Future studies are needed to evaluate the mechanism(s) leading to improved outcomes with adjunctive antibody treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2803541621,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a well-established modality for the treatment of advanced knee osteoarthritis (OA). However, the detrimental effects of intramedullary reaming used in conventional TKA for distal femur cutting are of concern. Avoiding intramedullary reaming with the use of computer-assisted navigation TKA can not only provide superior prosthetic alignment, but also mitigate perioperative blood loss and the dissipation of marrow emboli. We quantified local and systemic concentrations of inflammation markers for both techniques. Forty-four participants undergoing computer-assisted navigation and 53 receiving conventional TKA for advanced knee OA were recruited between 2013/02/08 and 2015/12/09. Blood samples were collected from all participants at baseline then again at 24 and 72 hours postoperatively and analyzed by ELISA for interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1); these markers were also measured in Hemovac drain fluid collected at 24 and 72 hours. Serum levels of IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α and TGF-β1(unit for all markers: pg/mL) were increased from baseline by smaller increments in the navigation TKA cohort compared with the conventional TKA group at 24 hours (17.06 vs 29.39, p = 0.02; 0.51 vs 0.83, p = 0.16; -0.04 vs 0.36, p < 0.01 and -48.18 vs 63.24, p< 0.01, respectively) and at 72 hours (12.27 vs 16.87, p = 0.01; -0.40 vs 0.48, p < 0.01; 0.58 vs 0.98, p = 0.07 and -55.16 vs 63.71, p < 0.01, respectively). IL-10 levels in drainage fluids collected 24 hours after TKA were also significantly lower in the navigation group versus the conventional TKA group (8.55 vs 12.32, p < 0.01). According to our evidence, the merits of computer-assisted navigation TKA are augmented by low levels of inflammation markers."
https://openalex.org/W2804418342,"Visual impairment is a significant public health concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where eye care is predominantly provided at the primary healthcare (PHC) level, known as primary eye care. This study aimed to perform an evaluation of primary eye care services in three districts of South Africa and to assess whether an ophthalmic health system strengthening (HSS) package could improve these services. Baseline surveys were conducted in Cape Winelands District, Johannesburg Health District and Mopani District at 14, 25 and 36 PHC facilities, respectively. Thereafter, the HSS package, comprising group training, individual mentoring, stakeholder engagement and resource provision, was implemented in 20 intervention sites in Mopani District, with the remaining 16 Mopani facilities serving as control sites. At baseline, less than half the facilities in Johannesburg and Mopani had dedicated eye care personnel or sufficient space to measure visual acuity. Although visual acuity charts were available in most facilities, <50% assessed patients at the correct distance. Median score for availability of nine essential drugs was <70%. Referral criteria knowledge was highest in Cape Winelands and Johannesburg, with poor clinical knowledge across all districts. Several HSS interventions produced successful outcomes: compared to control sites there was a significant increase in the proportion of intervention sites with eye care personnel and resources such as visual acuity charts (p = 0.02 and <0.01, respectively). However, engaging with district pharmacists did not improve availability of essential drugs (p = 0.47). Referral criteria knowledge improved significantly in intervention sites (p<0.01) but there was no improvement in clinical knowledge (p = 0.76). Primary eye care in South Africa faces multiple challenges with regard to organisation of care, resource availability and clinical competence. The HSS package successfully improved some aspects of this care, but further development is warranted together with debate regarding the positioning of eye services at PHC level."

We assessed the long-term impact of a PLA intervention in rural Nepal on women’s agency in the household. In 2014, we conducted a follow-up study to a cluster randomised controlled trial on the impact of PLA women’s groups from 2001–2003. Agency was measured using the Relative Autonomy Index (RAI) and its subdomains. Multi-level regression analyses were performed adjusting for baseline socio-demographic characteristics. We additionally adjusted for potential exposure to subsequent PLA groups based on women’s pregnancy status and conduct of PLA groups in areas of residence. Sensitivity analyses were performed using two alternative measures of agency. We analysed outcomes for 4030 mothers (66% of the cohort) who survived and were recruited to follow-up at mean age 39.6 years. Across a wide range of model specifications, we found no association between exposure to the original PLA intervention with women’s agency in the household approximately 11.5 years later. Subsequent exposure to PLA groups was not associated with greater agency in the household at follow-up, but some specifications found evidence for reduced agency. Household agency may be a prerequisite for actualising the benefits of PLA groups rather than a consequence."
https://openalex.org/W2803432864,"Although heterosis has significantly contributed to increases in worldwide crop production, the molecular mechanisms regulating this phenomenon are still unknown. In the present study, we used a comparative proteomic approach to explore hybrid vigor via the proteome of both the popcorn L54 ♀ and P8 ♂ genotypes and the resultant UENF/UEM01 hybrid cross. To analyze the differentially abundant proteins involved in heterosis, we used the primary roots of these genotypes to analyze growth parameters and extract proteins. The results of the growth parameter analysis showed that the mid- and best-parent heterosis were positive for root length and root dry matter but negative for root fresh matter, seedling fresh matter, and protein content. The comparative proteomic analysis identified 1343 proteins in the primary roots of hybrid UENF/UEM01 and its parental lines; 220 proteins were differentially regulated in terms of protein abundance. The mass spectrometry proteomic data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier “PXD009436”. A total of 62 regulated proteins were classified as nonadditive, of which 53.2% were classified as high parent abundance (+), 17.8% as above-high parent abundance (+ +), 16.1% as below-low parent abundance (− −), and 12.9% as low parent abundance (-). A total of 22 biological processes were associated with nonadditive proteins; processes involving translation, ribosome biogenesis, and energy-related metabolism represented 45.2% of the nonadditive proteins. Our results suggest that heterosis in the popcorn hybrid UENF/UEM01 at an early stage of plant development is associated with an up-regulation of proteins related to synthesis and energy metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2804891908,"Background The prevalence of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in primary Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) had been reported to be rare. However, recent studies using echocardiography as a screening method showed conflicting results, and the true prevalence is still unclear. Since diagnosing primary SS is difficult because of its heterogeneous nature, a number of patients with primary-SS-associated PAH may be misdiagnosed with idiopathic PAH, losing their chance to undergo immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the prevalence of primary SS among patients who initially present with PAH. Methods From our prospective institutional PAH database, 40 consecutive patients without any obvious cause of PAH at the time of PAH diagnosis were identified. We retrospectively evaluated the prevalence of primary SS diagnosed during or after the initial assessment of PAH. Results During the initial assessment, one patient was diagnosed with primary-SS-associated PAH. Among the 25 patients who were initially diagnosed with idiopathic PAH, five were diagnosed with primary SS during their course of the disease. Of the five patients, three had key signs suggesting primary SS and were probably underdiagnosed at the time of initial evaluation. The remaining two patients, who were finally diagnosed with primary SS, did not have any specific signs suggesting primary SS at the time of initial evaluation but showed positive conversion of their autoantibodies during the course of PAH. Conclusion The prevalence of primary-SS-associated PAH may be relatively high among patients who undergo initial evaluation for PAH. Furthermore, primary-SS-associated PAH may be underdiagnosed with routine evaluation for the primary cause of PAH. Clinicians should pay specific attention and carefully evaluate the possibility of primary SS in patients with PAH."

Insect wax is a good source of policosanol, which may is a candidate supplement in foodstuff and pharmaceuticals that has important physiological activities. Therefore, this work aims to investigate a high-yield and rapid method for policosanol fabrication from insect wax. Results The conditions for policosanol fabrication were optimized as follows: an oil bath temperature of 112.7°C and reductant dosage of 0.97 g (used for the reduction of 10.00 g of insect wax). The yield of policosanol reached 83.20%, which was 4 times greater than that of existing methods, such as saponification. The total content of policosanol obtained under the optimal conditions reached 87%. In other words, a high yield of policosanol was obtained from insect wax (723.84 mg/g), that was 55 times higher than that generated from beeswax-brown via saponification. The concentrations of metal residues in policosanol were within the limits of the European Union regulations and EFSA stipulation. The LD50 values for oral doses of insect wax and policosanol were both > 5 g/kg. Conclusion Policosanol was fabricated via solvent-free reduction from insect wax using LiAlH4 at a high yield. The fabrication conditions were optimized. Policosanol and insect wax showed high security, which made them potential candidates as supplements in foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. The rapid and high-yield method has great potential for commercial manufacturing of policosanol."

Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics were collected from 307 children and adolescents aged 2-18 years and receiving antiretroviral therapy. Nutritional status was assessed by height-for-age, weight-for-height and body mass index-for-age. Dietary data was collected through a 24 hour recall, and through a weekly food frequency questionnaire. Dietary patterns were identified by principal component analysis. Bivariate and multivariable statistical methods were used to assess the factors associated with ""high adherence"" to the ""healthy diet"" pattern.More than a third of the study group (33.2%) were stunted, 3.3% were identified as being wasted, and 10% were overweight or obese. Their diets were predominantly based on a high consumption of cereals, beans, eggs and processed foods and a low consumption of fruits, vegetables and dairy products. Three dietary patterns were identified: ""healthy diet"", ""high fat/sugar diet"" and ""low diversity diet"". Being female (OR: 1.63; 95%CI: 0.97-2.75), younger (OR: 2.37; 95%CI: 1.28-4.36) and institutionalized (OR: 14.5; 95%CI: 5.35-39.50) increased the odds to adhere to the ""healthy diet"" pattern.Our findings reveal a high prevalence of stunting and overweight in HIV-infected children in El Salvador. Institutionalized children were more likely to adhere to a healthy dietary pattern whereas children in poverty were more likely to have less varied and healthy diets. These results highlight the need to assess the dietary patterns of HIV-infected children and adolescents in order to guide public policies to design healthy life style interventions for this population at risk."
https://openalex.org/W2801064922,"A set of missense mutations in the gene encoding profilin-1 has been linked to the onset of familial forms of ALS (fALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. The pathogenic potential of these mutations is linked to the formation of intracellular inclusions of the mutant proteins and correlates with the mutation-induced destabilization of its native, fully folded state. However, the mechanism by which these mutations promote misfolding and self-assembly is yet unclear. Here, using temperature-jump and stopped-flow kinetic measurements, we show that, during refolding, WT profilin-1 transiently populates a partially folded (PF) state endowed with hydrophobic clusters exposed to the solvent and with no detectable secondary structure. We observed that this conformational state is marginally stable at neutral pH but becomes significantly populated at mildly acidic pH. Interestingly, the fALS-associated mutations did not cause a change in the refolding mechanism of profilin-1, but induced a stabilization of the PF state. In the presence of preformed profilin-1 aggregates, the PF state, unlike the unfolded and folded states, could interact with these aggregates via nonspecific hydrophobic interactions and also increase thioflavin-T fluorescence, revealing its amyloidogenic potential. Moreover, in the variants tested, we found a correlation between conformational stability of PF and aggregation propensity, defining this conformational state as an aggregation-prone folding intermediate. In conclusion, our findings indicate that mutation-induced stabilization of a partially folded state can enhance profilin-1 aggregation and thereby contribute to the pathogenicity of the mutations. A set of missense mutations in the gene encoding profilin-1 has been linked to the onset of familial forms of ALS (fALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. The pathogenic potential of these mutations is linked to the formation of intracellular inclusions of the mutant proteins and correlates with the mutation-induced destabilization of its native, fully folded state. However, the mechanism by which these mutations promote misfolding and self-assembly is yet unclear. Here, using temperature-jump and stopped-flow kinetic measurements, we show that, during refolding, WT profilin-1 transiently populates a partially folded (PF) state endowed with hydrophobic clusters exposed to the solvent and with no detectable secondary structure. We observed that this conformational state is marginally stable at neutral pH but becomes significantly populated at mildly acidic pH. Interestingly, the fALS-associated mutations did not cause a change in the refolding mechanism of profilin-1, but induced a stabilization of the PF state. In the presence of preformed profilin-1 aggregates, the PF state, unlike the unfolded and folded states, could interact with these aggregates via nonspecific hydrophobic interactions and also increase thioflavin-T fluorescence, revealing its amyloidogenic potential. Moreover, in the variants tested, we found a correlation between conformational stability of PF and aggregation propensity, defining this conformational state as an aggregation-prone folding intermediate. In conclusion, our findings indicate that mutation-induced stabilization of a partially folded state can enhance profilin-1 aggregation and thereby contribute to the pathogenicity of the mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2801547470,"Internet-based social networks are used by nurses with different purposes, including the creation of working groups and to share and create knowledge.To evaluate the utility of social networks in the dissemination of an online questionnaire and to measure Spanish RNs' knowledge about palliative care.A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out. Using social networks we distributed an online questionnaire with the Spanish version of Palliative Care Quiz for Nurses (PCQN-SV) throughout August 2015.A direct relationship between the number of responses and the questionnaire's apparitions in each social network was found. Comparing the results obtained by the 446 RNs participating in this study with those obtained in the study to pilot the PCQN-SV we identify that differences found are related to the participants' features (years of experience and hours of training in palliative care) and not to the type of questionnaire they answered.Social networks have shown to be a useful tool for nursing research by its ability, to recruit participants as well as to collect data, so their role as an instrument of research should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W2803253684,"Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare, almost exclusively female lung disease linked to inactivating mutations in tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2), a tumor suppressor gene that controls cell metabolic state and growth via regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTORC1) signaling. mTORC1 is frequently activated in human cancers and, although the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin has a cytostatic effect, it is, in general, unable to elicit a robust curative effect or tumor regression. Using RNA-Seq, we identified (1) Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF2) as one of the genes with the highest fold-change difference between human TSC2-null and TSC2-expressing angiomyolipoma cells from a patient with LAM, and (2) the mouse IGF2 homolog Igf2, as a top-ranking gene according to fold change between Tsc2-/- and Tsc2+/+ mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). We extended transcript-level findings to protein level, observing increased Igf2 protein expression and Igf2 secretion by Tsc2-/- MEFs. Increased Igf2 expression was not due to epigenetic imprinting, but was partially mediated through the Stat3 pathway and was completely insensitive to rapamycin treatment. An siRNA-mediated decrease of Igf2 resulted in decreased Stat3 phosphorylation, suggesting presence of an autocrine Igf2/Stat3 amplification cycle in Tsc2-/- MEFs. In human pulmonary LAM lesions and metastatic cell clusters, high levels of IGF2 were associated with mTORC1 activation. In addition, treatment of three primary IGF2-expressing LAM lung cell lines with rapamycin did not result in IGF2 level changes. Thus, targeting of IGF2 signaling may be of therapeutic value to LAM patients, particularly those who are unresponsive to rapamycin."
https://openalex.org/W2803831736,"The provision of written information is a low-cost and readily available intervention that has been found to reduce pain and anxiety in a variety of clinical settings. The current study was undertaken to determine if information provision may improve patients' experience during conventional electrodiagnostic studies.128 participants were recruited from a tertiary teaching hospital who were referred for electrodiagnostic studies. They were randomized into 2 groups where the intervention group was provided with written information about the electrodiagnostic testing. Patients were invited to complete a questionnaire that included pain and anxiety using a visual analogue scale (VAS) following the testing. All participants underwent nerve conduction studies (NCS) whilst a subset also underwent subsequent needle electromyography (EMG).Those who received information had a statistically significant lower perception of anxiety during NCS, whilst only females who received information had a statistically significant lower perception of pain to both NCS and EMG.The provision of written information can reduce the degree of pain and anxiety experienced during electrodiagnostic testing.Improving patient comfort and tolerability during electrodiagnostic testing may have practical implications towards more reliable and accurate results obtained from such investigations that may in turn improve patient diagnosis and management."
https://openalex.org/W2801539239,"Traditional restriction endonuclease-based cloning has been routinely used to generate replication-competent simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIV) and simian tropic HIV (stHIV). This approach requires the existence of suitable restriction sites or the introduction of nucleotide changes to create them. Here, using an In-Fusion cloning technique that involves homologous recombination, we generated SHIVs and stHIVs based on epidemiologically linked clade C transmitted/founder HIV molecular clones from Zambia. Replacing vif from these HIV molecular clones with vif of SIVmac239 resulted in chimeric genomes used to generate infectious stHIV viruses. Likewise, exchanging HIV env genes and introducing N375 mutations to enhance macaque CD4 binding site and cloned into a SHIVAD8-EO backbone. The generated SHIVs and stHIV were infectious in TZMbl and ZB5 cells, as well as macaque PBMCs. Therefore, this method can replace traditional methods and be a valuable tool for the rapid generation and testing of molecular clones of stHIV and SHIV based on primary clinical isolates will be valuable to generate rapid novel challenge viruses for HIV vaccine/cure studies."
https://openalex.org/W2803249138,"Background Achieving proper rotational alignment of the femoral component in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for valgus knee is challenging because of lateral condylar hypoplasia and lateral cartilage erosion. Gap-based navigation-assisted TKA enables surgeons to determine the angle of femoral component rotation (FCR) based on the posterior condylar axis. This study evaluated the possible factors that affect the rotational alignment of the femoral component based on the posterior condylar axis. Materials and methods Between 2008 and 2016, 28 knees were enrolled. The dependent variable for this study was FCR based on the posterior condylar axis, which was obtained from the navigation system archives. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to identify factors that might predict FCR, including body mass index (BMI), Kellgren-Lawrence grade (K-L grade), lateral distal femoral angles obtained from the navigation system and radiographs (NaviLDFA, XrayLDFA), hip-knee-ankle (HKA) axis, lateral gap under varus stress (LGVS), medial gap under valgus stress (MGVS), and side-to-side difference (STSD, MGVS − LGVS). Results The mean FCR was 6.1° ± 2.0°. Of all the potentially predictive factors evaluated in this study, only NaviLDFA (β = −0.668) and XrayLDFA (β = −0.714) predicted significantly FCR. Conclusions The LDFAs, as determined using radiographs and the navigation system, were both predictive of the rotational alignment of the femoral component based on the posterior condylar axis in gap-based TKA for valgus knee. A 1° increment with NaviLDFA led to a 0.668° decrement in FCR, and a 1° increment with XrayLDFA led to a 0.714° decrement. This suggests that symmetrical lateral condylar hypoplasia of the posterior and distal side occurs in lateral compartment end-stage osteoarthritis with valgus deformity."
https://openalex.org/W2803471256,"We retrospectively reviewed the evolution of segmentectomy for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and the feasibility of multi- and single-incision video-assisted thoracoscopic segmentectomy.Of 348 patients undergoing surgery for TB, the medical records of 121 patients undergoing segmentectomy between January 1996 and November 2015 were reviewed. Clinical information and computed tomography (CT) image characteristics were investigated and analyzed.Eighteen patients underwent direct or intended thoracotomy. Sixty-four underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic segmentectomy (VATS), including 53 multi-incision thoracoscopic segmentectomy (MITS), and 11 single-incision thoracoscopic segmentectomy (SITS). Thirty-nine were converted to thoracotomy. The intended thoracotomy group had more operative blood loss (p = 0.005) and hospital stay (p = 0.001) than the VATS group although the VATS group had higher grade of cavity (p = 0.007). The intended thoracotomy group did not differ from converted thoracotomy in operative time, blood loss, or hospital stay, and the grade of pleural thickening was higher in the converted thoracotomy group (p = 0.001). The converted thoracotomy group had more operative blood loss, hospital stay, and complication rate than the MITS group (p = 0.001, p<0.001, and p = 0.009, respectively). The MITS group had lower pleural thickening, peribronchial lymph node calcification, cavity, and tuberculoma grading than the converted thoracotomy group (p<0.001, p = 0.001, 0.001, and 0.017, respectively). The SITS group had lower grading in pleural thickening, peribronchial lymph node calcification, and aspergilloma grading than the converted thoracotomy group (p = 0.002, 0.010, and 0.031, respectively). Four patients in the intended thoracotomy group and seven in the converted thoracotomy group had complications compared with three patients in the MITS and two in the SITS group. Risk factors of conversion were pleural thickening and peribronchial lymph node calcification.Although segmentectomy is technically challenging in patients with pulmonary TB, it could be safely performed using MITS or SITS and should be attempted in selected patients. Its efficacy for medical treatment failure needs investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2804868671,"Background 
Little is known about how freelance street-based sex workers navigate condom use while soliciting. Traditional behavioural model may fail to account for the complex risk environment that most street-based sex workers work within. We examine first the association of self-efficacy and the infrequent condom use, then we investigated the roles of clients and venues frequented on this association.


Method 
Using a purposive chain-referral sampling method, we surveyed 248 street-based sex workers in Shanghai. The survey focused on sex workers HIV risk factors, sex work patterns, HIV knowledge, and related HIV self-efficacy. Clients types and behaviours, and characteristics of the venues frequented by these commercial sex workers were also collected. We conducted a series of multiple logistic regression models to explore how the association between a sex worker’s self-efficacy with infrequent condom use change as client and venue characteristics were added to the models.


Results 
We find that within the basic model, low self-efficacy was marginally associated with infrequent condom use (54.9% vs. 45.1%, AOR = 1.70, 95% CI = 0.95–3.03). As client- and venue- characteristics were added, the associations between self-efficacy and condom use were strengthened (AOR = 2.10 95% CI = 1.12–3.91 and 2.54 95% CI = 1.24–5.19 respectively). Those who reported middle-tiered income were more likely to report infrequent condom use compared to their peers of high income (AOR = 3.92 95% CI = 1.32–11.70) whereas such difference was not found between low income and high income sex workers. Visiting multiple venues and having migrant workers as clients were also associated with infrequent condom use.


Conclusion 
Our findings suggest sex worker’s self-efficacy matters in their HIV risk behaviours only when environment characteristics were adjusted. Risk environment for street-based sex workers are complex. Programming addressing behavioural changes among female sex workers should adopt holistic, multilevel models with the consideration of risk environments."
