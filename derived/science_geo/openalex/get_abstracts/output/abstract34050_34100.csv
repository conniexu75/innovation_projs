https://openalex.org/W2057409012,"Drug development is needed to improve chemotherapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic colon carcinoma, who otherwise have an unfavorable prognosis. DNA topoisomerase I, a nuclear enzyme important for solving topological problems arising during DNA replication and for other cellular functions, has been identified as a principal target of a plant alkaloid 20(S)-camptothecin. Significantly increased concentrations of this enzyme, compared to that in normal colonic mucosa, were found in advanced stages of human colon adenocarcinoma and in xenografts of colon cancer carried by immunodeficient mice. Several synthetic analogs of camptothecin, selected by tests with the purified enzyme and tissue-culture screens, were evaluated in the xenograft model. Unlike other anticancer drugs tested, 20(RS)-9-amino-camptothecin (9-AC) induced disease-free remissions. The overall drug toxicity was low and allowed for repeated courses of treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2044458947,"The pituitary hormone thyrotropin, or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), is the main physiological agent that regulates the thyroid gland. The thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) was cloned by selective amplification with the polymerase chain reaction of DNA segments presenting sequence similarity with genes for G protein-coupled receptors. Out of 11 new putative receptor clones obtained from genomic DNA, one had sequence characteristics different from all the others. Although this clone did not hybridize to thyroid transcripts, screening of a dog thyroid complementary DNA (cDNA) library at moderate stringency identified a cDNA encoding a 4.9-kilobase thyroid-specific transcript. The polypeptide encoded by this thyroid-specific transcript consisted of a 398-amino acid residue amino-terminal segment, constituting a putative extracellular domain, connected to a 346-residue carboxyl-terminal domain that contained seven putative transmembrane segments. Expression of the cDNA conferred TSH responsiveness to Xenopus oocytes and Y1 cells and a TSH binding phenotype to COS cells. The TSHR and the receptor for luteinizing hormone-choriogonadotropin constitute a subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors with distinct sequence characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2127508135,"A vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) would be highly effective in stopping the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic. A comprehensive evaluation of potential vaccine methodologies can be made by means of the simian model for AIDS, which takes advantage of the similarities in viral composition and disease potential between simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of rhesus macaques and HIV infection in humans. Immunization with a formalin-inactivated whole SIV vaccine potentiated with either alum and the Syntex adjuvant threonyl muramyl dipeptide (MDP) or MDP alone resulted in the protection of eight of nine rhesus monkeys challenged with ten animal-infectious doses of pathogenic virus. These results demonstrate that a whole virus vaccine is highly effective in inducing immune responses that can protect against lentivirus infection and AIDS-like disease."

https://openalex.org/W2101011253,"We have identified a 19 kd protein of the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM19). Monospecific IgG and Fab fragments directed against MOM19 inhibit import of precursor proteins destined for the various mitochondrial subcompartments, including porin, cytochrome c1, Fe/S protein, F0 ATPase subunit 9, and F1 ATPase subunit beta. Inhibition occurs at the level of high affinity binding of precursors to mitochondria. Consistent with previous functional studies that suggested the existence of distinct import sites for ADP/ATP carrier and cytochrome c, we find that import of those precursors is not inhibited. We conclude that MOM19 is identical to, or closely associated with, a specific mitochondrial import receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1995646607,"Several transcription factors interact with GC-rich sequences and positively regulate both housekeeping genes and cellular oncogenes. We have cloned a human cDNA that encodes a factor that binds to the GC-rich sequences present in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), beta-actin, and calcium-dependent protease (CANP) promoters. This cDNA encodes a 91 kd protein with an extremely basic region at its amino terminus. Deletion analyses with bacterially expressed proteins containing fragments of this factor indicate that this basic region of the protein functions as the DNA binding domain. Expression of this factor in CV1 cells shows that it represses expression originating from both the EGFR and beta-actin promoters as well as chimeric promoters containing the CANP gene. It also represses transcription in cell-free extracts. These results suggest that positive and negative factors may interact with the same control element to account for the diversity of transcriptional regulation."

https://openalex.org/W1568484052,"We have evaluated the possibility that a major, abundant cellular substrate for protein kinase C might be a calmodulin-binding protein. We have recently labeled this protein, which migrates on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis with an apparent Mr of 60,000 from chicken and 80,000-87,000 from bovine cells and tissues, the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS). The MARCKS proteins from both species could be cross-linked to 125I-calmodulin in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of either protein by protein kinase C prevented 125I-calmodulin binding and cross-linking, suggesting that the calmodulin-binding domain might be located at or near the sites of protein kinase C phosphorylation. Both bovine and chicken MARCKS proteins contain an identical 25-amino acid domain that contains all 4 of the serine residues phosphorylated by protein kinase C in vitro. In addition, this domain is similar in sequence and structure to previously described calmodulin-binding domains. A synthetic peptide corresponding to this domain inhibited calmodulin binding to the MARCKS protein and also could be cross-linked to 125I-calmodulin in a calcium-dependent manner. In addition, protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of the synthetic peptide inhibited its binding and cross-linking to 125I-calmodulin. The peptide bound to fluorescently labeled 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl-calmodulin with a dissociation constant of 2.8 nM, and inhibited the calmodulin-dependent activation of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase with an IC50 of 4.8 nM. Thus, the peptide mimics the calmodulin-binding properties of the MARCKS protein and probably represents its calmodulin-binding domain. Phosphorylation of these abundant, high affinity calmodulin-binding proteins by protein kinase C in intact cells could cause displacement of bound calmodulin, perhaps leading to activation of Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent processes."
https://openalex.org/W2095202174,"While the nuclear lamin proteins (A, B, and C) assemble specifically at the surface of the nuclear membrane, their sequences do not reveal stretches of hydrophobic amino acids that might explain their association with the nuclear membranes. However, the A and B lamin proteins possess Ras-like C-terminal CaaX sequence motifs, which in Ras proteins are sites of hydrophobic modifications required for membrane association and function. From the analysis of single and double lamin A mutants affecting the CaaX motif, the nuclear localization signal, and higher-order assembly properties, we propose that the CaaX motif functions as a nonspecific, low affinity membrane probe for proteins ultimately segregated to specific cellular membrane systems. Committed association with specific membranes requires additional interactions with membrane-resident factors."

https://openalex.org/W1592913469,"Membrane-associated and soluble forms of folate binding protein (FBP) have been identified in mammalian tissues and biological fluids. Despite their solubility differences, these two forms are functionally similar, immunologically cross-reacting, and have the same apparent molecular weights. In this study we demonstrate, for the first time, that the membrane FBP of cultured human KB cells contains a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) tail which is responsible for its hydrophobic properties and distinguishes it from the soluble FBP released into the medium. Treatment of the purified membrane FBP with phospholipase C specific for phosphatidylinositol (PI-PLC) removed the GPI tail and converted it to the soluble form without a change in apparent Mr by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In addition, virtually all of the folate binding sites on the plasma membrane of the intact cells were released as soluble, functional FBP following treatment with PI-PLC. The GPI tail contained 1-O-alkyl-2-O-acylglycerol as a mixture of fatty alcohols in ether linkage at C1 of the glycerol backbone and almost exclusively docosanoic acid (22:0) as the fatty acid on C2. The inositol also contained a mixture of fatty acids (16:0, 18:0, 18:1, 20:4, 22:0) located on a site other than the C2 position since the FBP was susceptible to PI-PLC cleavage. After nitrous acid deamination, the aqueous portion of the FBP contained covalently bound fatty acids, predominantly palmitate (16:0) and stearate (18:0), indicating the presence of additional acyl groups attached to the peptide in the form of amide, ester, or thioester linkage."
https://openalex.org/W1486362699,"Abstract DARPP-32 (dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphorprotein, Mr = 32,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) is an inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1 and is enriched in dopaminoceptive neurons possessing the D1 dopamine receptor. Purified bovine DARPP-32 was phosphorylated in vitro by casein kinase II to a stoichiometry greater than 2 mol of phosphate/mol of protein whereas two structurally and functionally related proteins, protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 and G-substrate, were poor substrates for this enzyme. Sequencing of chymotryptic and thermolytic phosphopeptides from bovine DARPP-32 phosphorylated by casein kinase II suggested that the main phosphorylated residues were Ser45 and Ser102. In the case of rat DARPP-32, the identification of these phosphorylation sites was confirmed by manual Edman degradation. The phosphorylated residues are located NH2-terminal to acidic amino acid residues, a characteristic of casein kinase II phosphorylation sites. Casein kinase II phosphorylated DARPP-32 with an apparent Km value of 3.4 microM and a kcat value of 0.32 s-1. The kcat value for phosphorylation of Ser102 was 5-6 times greater than that for Ser45. Studies employing synthetic peptides encompassing each phosphorylation site confirmed this difference between the kcat values for phosphorylation of the two sites. In slices of rat caudate-putamen prelabeled with [32P]phosphate, DARPP-32 was phosphorylated on seryl residues under basal conditions. Comparison of thermolytic phosphopeptide maps and determination of the phosphorylated residue by manual Edman degradation identified the main phosphorylation site in intact cells as Ser102. In vitro, DARPP-32 phosphorylated by casein kinase II was dephosphorylated by protein phosphatases-1 and -2A. Phosphorylation by casein kinase II did not affect the potency of DARPP-32 as an inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1, which depended only on phosphorylation of Thr34 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. However, phosphorylation of DARPP-32 by casein kinase II facilitated phosphorylation of Thr34 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase with a 2.2-fold increase in the Vmax and a 1.4-fold increase in the apparent Km. Phosphorylation of DARPP-32 by casein kinase II in intact cells may therefore modulate its phosphorylation in response to increased levels of cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W1977515340,"The covalently closed circular form of the conjugative transposon Tn916, which acts as an intermediate in transposition, is produced by a novel type of recombination. Excision of the element pairs noncomplementary base pairs, which flank the transposon in a heteroduplex, at the joint of a circular form. By a reversal of the excision process, the base pairs from the heteroduplex are inserted into the next target. We present a detailed molecular model for the movement of conjugative transposons that involves the initial formation of staggered nicks in the ""coupling regions"" that flank the inserted element. The different products of excision and insertion of Tn916 can be explained by this model."
https://openalex.org/W1529699615,"Insulin-like growth factors I and II (IGF-I and II) and insulin are chemotactic agents for the human melanoma cell line A2058. As shown in this report, the motility receptor mediating this response is the heterodimeric type I IGF receptor. These three factors are able to compete with 125I-labeled IGF-I for binding to the cell surface with IC50 values equal to approximately 2 (IGF-I), approximately 150 (IGF-II), and approximately 300 nM (insulin). Cross-linking of 125I-IGF-I to the cell surface with disuccinimidyl suberate followed by analysis with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography reveals a 130-kDa protein (reduced) consistent with the alpha component of a type I receptor and a 38-kDa protein which does not bind insulin, and thus could be another IGF-I cell surface binding protein. The anti-IGF-I receptor monoclonal antibody (alpha IR-3) also competes with labeled IGF-I in binding experiments. In contrast, a control monoclonal antibody, matched to alpha IR-3 with respect to IgG subclass, has no significant effect on IGF-I binding. While alpha IR-3 inhibits the motility induced by IGF-I, IGF-II, and insulin, pertussis toxin (0.01-1.0 micrograms/ml) has no significant effect on the motility induced by the insulin-like growth factors or insulin on this cell line. Therefore, the type I IGF receptor appears to mediate a highly potent pertussis toxin-insensitive motility response to IGF-I, IGF-II, and insulin. In contrast, motility induced by the autocrine motility factor, a cytokine produced by the A2058 cells, is not affected by alpha IR-3 but is extremely sensitive to pertussis toxin. When mixtures of autocrine motility factor and IGF-I are employed to induce chemotaxis, the resulting motility is greater than that induced by either agent alone. These data indicate that motility in this melanoma cell line can be initiated through multiple receptors that stimulate the cells by separate transduction pathways. This capability to respond to multiple stimuli could enhance the metastatic potential."
https://openalex.org/W1548061249,"The kinetics of insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of specific tyrosines in the beta subunit of the mouse insulin receptor and activation of receptor kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of a model substrate were compared. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mouse proreceptor was determined to locate tyrosine-containing tryptic peptides. Receptor was first incubated with unlabeled ATP to occupy nonrelevant autophosphorylation sites, after which [32P]autophosphorylation at relevant sites and attendant activation of substrate phosphorylation were initiated with [gamma-32P]ATP and insulin. Activation of substrate phosphorylation underwent an initial lag of 10-20 s during which there was substantial 32P-autophosphorylation of tryptic phosphopeptides p2 and p3, but not p1. Following the lag, incorporation of 32P into p1 and the activation of substrate phosphorylation increased abruptly and exhibited identical kinetics. The addition of substrate to the receptor prior to ATP inhibits insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation, and consequently substrate phosphorylation. Insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of the receptor in the presence of substrate inhibited primarily the incorporation of 32P into p1 and drastically inhibited substrate phosphorylation. From Edman radiosequencing of 32P-labeled p1, p2, and p3 and the amino acid sequence of the mouse receptor, the location of each phosphopeptide within the beta subunit was determined. Further characterization of these phosphopeptides revealed that p1 and p2 represent the triply and doubly phosphorylated forms, respectively, of the region within the tyrosine kinase domain containing tyrosines 1148, 1152, and 1153. The doubly phosphorylated forms contain phosphotyrosines either at positions 1148 and 1152/1153 or positions 1152 and 1153. These results indicate that insulin stimulates sequential autophosphorylation of tyrosines 1148, 1152 and 1153, and that the transition from the doubly to the triply phosphorylated forms is primarily responsible for the activation of substrate phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1554568866,"The nonheme iron oxidase isopenicillin N synthase catalyzes the formation of two new internal bonds in the tripeptide δ-(L-α-aminoadipoyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine (ACV) to form the β-lactam and thiazolidine rings of isopenicillin N. Concomitantly, O2 is reduced to 2 H2O. The recombinant enzyme from Cephalosporium acremonium (Mr = 38,400), expressed as an apoenzyme in Escherichia coli, binds 1 g atom of Fe2+/mol of enzyme to reconstitute full activity. Mossbauer spectra of the 57Fe-enriched enzyme exhibit parameters (δ = 1.30 mm/s, Δ EQ = 2.70 mm/s) which unambiguously show that the active site iron is high spin Fe2+. Anaerobic binding of ACV causes a substantial decrease in the isomer shift parameter δ (δ = 1.10 mm/s, ΔEQ = 3.40 mm/s) showing that the substrate perturbs the iron site and makes its coordination environment much more covalent. Nitric oxide (NO) binds to the EPR silent active site iron to give an EPR active species (g = 4.09, 3.95, 2.0; S = 3/2) similar to those of the nitrosyl complexes of many other mononuclear Fe2+-containing enzymes. The rhombicity of the EPR spectrum is increased (g = 4.22, 3.81, 1.99) by anaerobic addition of ACV suggesting that the substrate binds to or near the iron without displacing NO. Interestingly, the enzyme·ACV·NO complex displays an optical spectrum similar to that of ferric rubredoxin in which the iron has only thiol coordination. This suggests that the Fe2+ of the enzyme· ACV·NO complex acquires Fe3+ character and that the cysteinyl thiol moiety of ACV coordinates to the iron. Similar substrate thiol coordination to the iron of the enzyme·ACV complex is the most probable explanation for the large decrease in isomer shift observed. These results provide the first evidence for the direct involvement of iron in this unique O2-dependent reaction and suggest novel roles for iron and oxygen in biological catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1510630022,"Lipid peroxyl radicals resulting from the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids by soybean lipoxygenase were directly detected by the method of rapid mixing, continuous-flow electron spin resonance spectroscopy. When air-saturated borate buffer (pH 9.0) containing linoleic acid or arachidonate acid was mixed with lipoxygenase, fatty acid-derived peroxyl free radicals were readily detected; these radicals have a characteristic g-value of 2.014. An organic free radical (g = 2.004) was also detected; this may be the carbon-centered fatty acid free radical that is the precursor of the peroxyl free radical. The ESR spectrum of this species was not resolved, so the identification of this free radical was not possible. Fatty acids without at least two double bonds (e.g. stearic acid and oleic acid) did not give the corresponding peroxyl free radicals, suggesting that the formation of bisallylic carbon-centered radicals precedes peroxyl radical formation. The 3.8-G doublet feature of the fatty acid peroxyl spectrum was proven (by selective deuteration) to be a hyperfine coupling due to a gamma-hydrogen that originated as a vinylic hydrogen of arachidonate. Arachidonate peroxyl radical formation was shown to be dependent on the substrate, active lipoxygenase, and molecular oxygen. Antioxidants are known to protect polyunsaturated fatty acids from peroxidation by scavenging peroxyl radicals and thus breaking the free radical chain reaction. Therefore, the peroxyl signal intensity from micellar arachidonate solutions was monitored as a function of the antioxidant concentration. The reaction of the peroxyl free radical with Trolox C was shown to be 10 times slower than that with vitamin E. The vitamin E and Trolox C phenoxyl radicals that resulted from scavenging the peroxyl radical were also detected."
https://openalex.org/W1575065817,"A DNA consensus sequence for topoisomerase II cleavage sites was derived previously based on a statistical analysis of the nucleotide sequences around 16 sites that can be efficiently cleaved by Drosophila topoisomerase II (Sander, M., and Hsieh, T. (1985) Nucleic Acids Res. 13, 1057-1072). A synthetic 21-mer DNA sequence containing this cleavage consensus sequence was cloned into a plasmid vector, and DNA topoisomerase II can cleave this sequence at the position predicted by the cleavage consensus sequence. DNase I footprint analysis showed that topoisomerase II can protect a region of approximately 25 nucleotides in both strands of the duplex DNA, with the cleavage site located near the center of the protected region. Similar correlation between the DNase I footprints and strong topoisomerase II cleavage sites has been observed in the intergenic region of the divergent HSP70 genes. This analysis therefore suggests that the strong DNA cleavage sites of Drosophila topoisomerase II likely correspond to specific DNA-binding sites of this enzyme. Furthermore, the extent of DNA contacts made by this enzyme suggests that eucaryotic topoisomerase II, in contrast to bacterial DNA bacterial DNA gyrase, cannot form a complex with extensive DNA wrapping around the enzyme. The absence of DNA wrapping is probably the mechanistic basis for the lack of DNA supercoiling action for eucaryotic topoisomerase II."
https://openalex.org/W2138120786,"α-Tocopherol (vitamin E) is a lipophilic chain-breaking antioxidant which inhibits lipid peroxidation in isolated mitochondrial membranes and protects membranes from oxidative damage. The primary oxidation product of vitamin E is the tocopheroxyl radical. Reduction of the tocopheroxyl radical can occur by reactions with water-soluble anti-oxidants such as ascorbate or glutathione, resulting in the recycling of vitamin E. Physiological concentrations of vitamin E are too low to allow detection of tocopheroxyl radical by ESR. After dietary supplementation with vitamin E, a 10-20-fold increase in the rat liver mitochondrial membrane content of vitamin E was achieved and this allowed for direct detection of the tocopheroxyl radical by ESR, after treatment with an oxidizing system composed of lipoxygenase and arachidonic acid. By using submitochondrial particle membranes, it was shown that NADH, succinate, and reduced cytochrome c-linked oxidation reduce the tocopheroxyl radical, preventing both accumulation of the radical and vitamin E consumption. As the electron transport chain can reduce tocopheroxyl radical it may have an important physiological role in recycling vitamin E."
https://openalex.org/W1606227954,"In nonpolar excitable cells, guanine nucleotide regulatory (G) proteins have been shown to modulate ion channel activity in response to hormone receptor activation. In polarized epithelia, hormone receptor-G protein coupling involved in the generation of cAMP occurs on the basolateral membrane, while the physiological response to this messenger is a stimulation of ion channel activity at the apical membrane. In the present study we have utilized the patch-clamp technique to assess if the polarized renal epithelia, A6, have topologically distinct G proteins at their apical membrane capable of modulating Na+ channel activity. In excised inside-out patches of apical membranes, spontaneous Na+ channel activity (conductance 8-9 picosiemens) was inhibited by the addition of 0.1 mM guanosine 5'-O-(2-thio)diphosphate to the cytosolic membrane surface without an effect on single channel conductance. In contrast, the percent open time of spontaneous Na+ channels increased from 6 to 50% following the addition of 0.1 mM GTP. The addition of preactivated pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml) to the cytosolic bathing solution of the excised patch inhibited spontaneous Na+ channel activity within a minute by 85% from approximately 47 to 7% open time and reduced the percent open time for Na+ channel activity to zero after approximately 3 min. The addition of 0.1 mM guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate or the addition of 20 pM purified human alpha i-3 subunit to pertussis toxin-treated membrane patches restored Na+ channel activity from zero to 35% open time. As little as 0.2 pM alpha i-3 subunit was capable of restoring Na+ channel activity. These data provide evidence for a role of pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins in the apical plasma membrane of renal epithelia distal to signal transduction pathways in the basolateral membrane of these cells. This raises the possibility of a topologically distinct signal transducing pathway co-localized with the Na+ channel."
https://openalex.org/W1502559266,"In a previous study we demonstrated that cells of Staphylococcus aureus strain Cowan bind 125I-collagen in a receptor-ligand type of interaction (Speziale, P., Raucci, G., Visai, L., Switalski, L.M., Timpl, R., and Hook, M. (1986) J. Bacteriol. 167, 77-81). In the present communication we report on the isolation and preliminary characterization of a putative collagen receptor from a lysate of S. aureus strain Cowan. Antibodies raised against a collagen receptor positive strain inhibit the binding of 125I-collagen to bacterial cells, whereas antibodies raised against a collagen receptor negative strain were without effect. Solubilized cell surface components did not exhibit any measurable affinity for collagen-Sepharose. However, the inhibitory effect of the antibodies against bacterial cells was neutralized by the lysate from a receptor-positive but not receptor-negative strain. A collagen receptor assay was designed based on this observation and used to develop a receptor purification protocol involving anion exchange chromatography, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and gel chromatography. Using this procedure a protein with an apparent Mr of 135,000 was purified. This protein which was present on a collagen receptor-positive strain but not on a receptor-negative strain could completely neutralize the inhibitory activity of the antibodies raised against S. aureus strain Cowan. Furthermore, antibodies raised against the 135-kDa protein inhibited the binding of collagen to bacteria, and this protein is tentatively identified as a collagen receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1542561369,"Insulin and Mn/MgATP treatment of immunoaffinity-purified alpha beta heterodimeric insulin receptors induced the formation of an alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric insulin receptor complex. In contrast, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) treatment was completely ineffective in inducing the association of alpha beta heterodimeric insulin receptors. Similarly, IGF-1 or Mn/MgATP, but not insulin, treatment of immunoaffinity-purified alpha beta heterodimeric IGF-1 receptors induced the formation of an alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric IGF-1 receptor complex. A monoclonal antibody specific for the insulin receptor (MA5) completely immunoprecipitated all the insulin binding activity from both the alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric and alpha beta heterodimeric insulin receptor complexes but did not immunoprecipitate IGF-1 receptors. Conversely, the IGF-1 receptor-specific monoclonal antibody (alpha IR-3) immunoprecipitated all the IGF-1 binding activity, but not insulin receptors. The simultaneous treatment of pooled equal amounts of alpha beta heterodimeric insulin and IGF-1 receptors with a combination of insulin and IGF-1 resulted in the formation of alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric insulin and IGF-1 receptor complexes. However, in the mixed alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric receptor fraction MA5 immunoprecipitated 94% of the insulin binding in addition to 27% of the IGF-1 binding activity whereas alpha IR-3 immunoprecipitated 97% of the IGF-1 binding in addition to 38% of the insulin binding activity. Treatment of the mixed alpha beta heterodimeric insulin and IGF-1 receptors with Mn/MgATP also resulted in the formation of cross-immunoreactive (42-46%) alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric receptors. These data directly demonstrate the formation of insulin/IGF-1 hybrid receptors by both a combination of insulin plus IGF-1 or Mn/MgATP treatment of purified human placenta alpha beta heterodimeric insulin and IGF-1 half-receptors in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1555144752,"Valyl-tRNA synthetase occurs as a high molecular mass entity of approximately ≌ 700 kDa in the crude extract from rabbit liver. The enzyme was purified as a heterotypic complex comprising four polypeptides of 140, 50, 35, and 27 kDa in the molar proportions of 1:2:1:1, respectively, as determined by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Co-purification of these components at each step of the purification supports the conclusion that they are physically associated within the same complex. In addition to valyl-tRNA synthetase activity, which was assigned to the 140-kDa component, the purified complex exhibits a potent Elongation Factor 1 activity, determined by its ability to sustain poly(U)-dependent polyphenylalanine synthesis in the presence of Elongation Factor 2. Our results are essentially in agreement with those from a recent report (Motorin, Y., Wolfson, A., Orlovsky, A., and Gladilin, K. (1988) FEBS Lett. 238, 262–264), according to which the polypeptides other than that assigned to valyl-tRNA synthetase correspond to the subunits of Elongation Factor 1H."

Nuclear extracts from infected cells contain an activity that increases processing efficiency specifically at a late herpes simplex virus poly(A) site. By contrast, a second virus poly(A) site is processed with equal efficiency by nuclear extracts from infected and mock-infected cells. Using precursor RNAs containing these two virus poly(A) sites in tandem, which allows ready detection of the processing factor, we show that this specific activity is heat labile. Analysis of RNAs produced by virus recombinants that contain the poly(A) site sequences in tandem also indicates that increased processing at the late virus poly(A) site occurs in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1606200728,"Abstract Variant forms of mammalian gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) (pGlu-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Arg-Pro-Gly.NH2) are present in chicken ([Gln8] GnRH and [His5, Trp7, Tyr8]GnRH), salmon ([Trp7, Leu8]GnRH), and lamprey ([Tyr3, Leu5, Glu6, Trp7, Lys8] GnRH). To delineate the functional importance of the variant amino acids in positions 5, 7, and 8, the natural peptides and chimeric analogues were tested for gonadotropin-releasing activity and receptor-binding activity in rat, sheep, and chicken pituitaries. The results demonstrate that (i) the mammalian receptor has a high fidelity for Arg8 while the chicken receptor is less discriminatory and accepts basic or neutral amino acids in this position. Arg8 may contribute to conformational stabilization, and conformational constraint with D-Trp6 restored activity to analogues lacking Arg8 in the mammalian systems. D-Trp6 incorporation did not generally enhance activity in the chicken pituitary. (ii) His5 accompanying Arg8 in analogues markedly diminished activity in the chicken while gonadotropin-releasing activity was retained in the sheep pituitary. Receptor-binding activity was increased in the sheep indicating an uncoupling of receptor occupancy and activation. (iii) Substitution in position 7 is tolerated by the mammalian and chicken receptor. With Trp7-substituted analogues receptor-binding activity was relatively lower than gonadotropin-releasing activity in the sheep pituitary, suggesting an enhanced receptor activation by these analogues or the existence of different GnRH receptors."

https://openalex.org/W1575960707,"Cyclic AMP accumulation in response to forskolin, cholera toxin, or isoproterenol is dramatically increased in HIT T-15 cells, a clonal cell line of Syrian hamster pancreatic islet beta cells, as a function of passage number. Forskolin and cholera toxin elevate cyclic AMP levels 5- to 10-fold higher in later passages (87-100) than in earlier passages (70-80). A similar phenomenon is observed with isoproterenol (10 microM) which increases cyclic AMP levels 56-fold in older HIT cells (passage 94), whereas only marginally stimulating cyclic AMP production in younger cells (passage 70-82). To determine whether a change in the stimulatory or inhibitory guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins, Gs or Gi, was responsible for these observations, ADP-ribosylation of HIT cell membranes with cholera toxin and pertussis toxin was examined. All passages contained two cholera toxin substrates at 52 and 45 kDa. The amount of 52 kDa did not appear to change with passage number, but the amount of 45 kDa increased in the later passages (89 and 94). The ratio of 45 to 52 kDa cholera toxin substrate, as determined by densitometric analysis, increased from 0.1 in passages 70, 75, and 82 to 0.45 at passage 89. No passage related changes in a 40-kDa pertussis toxin substrate were observed. An increase in the amount of the 45-kDa alpha-subunit of Gs was confirmed on immunoblots using antisera specific for the alpha-subunits of Gs. The amount of functional Gs present in various HIT cell passages was examined by determining the extent to which extracts from HIT cell membranes reconstituted guanine nucleotide-sensitive adenylyl cyclase in S49 cyc- membranes. Extracts derived from passage 94 reconstituted three to four times more adenylyl cyclase activity in cyc- membranes than extracts from passages 70, 75, and 82. These data indicate that an increase in functional Gs in later passages may be the underlying cause for the increased responsiveness to isoproterenol and forskolin in later passages. These data also suggest that functional differences exist between the Gs alpha-subunits, with the smaller 45-kDa subunit being more efficacious in coupling to cyclic AMP synthesis than the larger 52-kDa subunit. This is a departure from the commonly held view that the two subunits have similar efficacies in stimulating adenylyl cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1921583691,"A cDNA encoding transforming growth factor type alpha (TGF alpha) was fused to the 5' end of a gene encoding a modified form of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE), which is devoid of the cell recognition domain (domain Ia). The chimeric molecule, termed TGF alpha-PE40, was expressed in Escherichia coli and isolated from the periplasm or inclusion bodies depending on the construction expressed. TGF alpha-PE40 was found to be extremely cytotoxic to cells displaying epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors. Comparison with a similar molecule in which TGF alpha was placed at the carboxyl end of PE40 demonstrated the importance of the position of the cell recognition element; TGF alpha-PE40 was found to be about 30-fold more cytotoxic to cells bearing EGF receptors than PE40-TGF alpha. In addition, TGF alpha-PE40 was shown to be extremely cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell lines including liver, ovarian, and colon cancer cell lines, indicating high levels of EGF receptor expression in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1558845814,"Abstract GTP cyclohydrolase I, an enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the biosynthetic pathway of tetrahydrobiopterin, has been purified about 38,000-fold to apparent homogeneity from rat liver extract with a yield of 5%. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be 300,000 by gel filtration on Ultrogel AcA 34. The purified enzyme gave a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at a position corresponding to a molecular weight of 30,000. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis gave a single amino acid at every step of the Edman degradation up to residue 10. These results suggest that the enzyme is probably a homopolymer. The enzyme showed positive cooperativity with a Hill coefficient of 2.4 at a substrate (GTP) concentration of 10-50 microM. The Vmax value of the enzyme was 45 nmol/min.mg protein. The GTP concentration producing half-maximal velocity was 30 microM at a KCl concentration of 0.1 M. This value increased as the KCl concentration rose, without any change in Vmax or Hill number. Biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin may be controlled by the intracellular level of GTP."
https://openalex.org/W1537162160,"Apolipoprotein (apo) E3-Leiden is a variant of apoE that is associated with dominant expression of type III hyperlipoproteinemia and that is defective in binding to the low density lipoprotein receptor. Therefore, the structure of apoE3-Leiden was investigated. Upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis apoE3-Leiden and its 22-kDa amino-terminal thrombolytic fragment migrated with a higher than normal apparent molecular weight. The structural abnormality of apoE3-Leiden was determined by sequencing its CNBr-, tryptic-, and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease-generated peptides. In contrast to normal apoE3, which has a cysteine at residue 112, apoE3-Leiden does not contain any cysteine and has an arginine at position 112 (as does apoE4, which also completely lacks cysteine). The basis for the molecular weight difference was determined to be a seven-amino acid insertion that is a tandem repeat of residues 121-127 of normal apoE3, i.e. Glu-Val-Gln-Ala-Met-Leu-Gly, resulting in apoE3-Leiden having 306 amino acids rather than 299. The negatively charged glutamyl residues within the insertion compensates for the arginine substitution at residue 112; thus apoE3-Leiden focuses in the E3 position. The low density lipoprotein receptor binding activities of both intact apoE3-Leiden and its 22-kDa thrombolytic fragment were determined in an in vitro assay. Although apoE3-Leiden had only about 25% of normal binding activity, its 22-kDa thrombolytic fragment had nearly normal binding, suggesting that the carboxyl-terminal domain of apoE3-Leiden modulates the receptor binding function of its amino-terminal domain."

These circular DNA molecules were used to analyze in vitro DNA repair synthesis by cell extracts from normal human lymphoid cell lines. Both types of lesions stimulate DNA repair synthesis at the site of the adduct. DNA repair synthesis induced by the 2-(acetyl-amino)fluorene adduct took place in the damaged strand and was confined to a region within a 31-base pair restriction fragment around the adduct."
https://openalex.org/W1493863118,"Transfection of the cDNA encoding the activated c-raf-1 protein or addition of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or dibutyryl cAMP to NIH/3T3 cells activated the c-fos gene enhancer linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase or luciferase reporter gene. Prolonged treatment of NIH/3T3 cells with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate caused down-regulation of protein kinase C. In these cells, addition of TPA did not stimulate the c-fos gene enhancer any more, but transfection of the c-raf-1 cDNA or addition of dibutyryl cAMP still stimulated the c-fos gene enhancer to the same extent as those induced in the control cells. Transfection of the c-raf-1 cDNA or addition of TPA to NIH/3T3 cells stimulated the serum response element and TPA response element but not the cAMP response element. In contrast, addition of dibutyryl cAMP to NIH/3T3 cells stimulated the cAMP response element but not the serum response element or TPA response element. These results indicate that the activated c-raf-1 protein stimulates the serum response element and TPA response element in a manner independent of protein kinase C and cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Since the c-fos gene enhancer has been shown to contain the serum response element and cAMP response element, it is most likely that the c-raf-1 protein is involved in the regulation of c-fos gene expression through the serum response element."

In this in vitro system SecB and not trigger factor could stabilize a translocation-competent state of prePhoE. In contrast, translocation competency of proOmpA could be induced by both trigger factor and SecB protein, suggesting specificity in interactions between cytosolic factors and precursors in outer membrane protein translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1543803803,"We have studied the protein factors that promote transcription via binding to the cAMP response element (CRE) present in the adenovirus early region III (EIII) and early region IV (EIV) promoters. Three sets of CRE-binding phosphoproteins, ranging in molecular mass from 65-72, 38-43, and 31-37 kDa, were identified in vivo from HeLa cells. Western blot analysis revealed that all three sets of proteins identified were immunologically related to the transcription factor AP1. We found that binding of these proteins to the CRE could be regulated by phosphorylation in vitro. EivF, a 65-72-kDa protein was found to bind specifically to the adenovirus EIV promoter. We have also shown that the smaller molecular mass proteins of 31-37 and 38-43 kDa were able to bind to the CRE present in the adenovirus EIV promoter, as well as to two related DNA elements present in the adenovirus EIII promoter, the ATF and AP1 sites. Phosphorylation of these proteins with the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, affected their transcriptional activity and binding affinity to the three sites. Furthermore, the binding specificity of the 31-37-kDa polypeptides was mediated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase in vitro. Our data suggests that phosphorylation of factors that bind to the CRE may, in part, underlie the cellular response to the adenovirus-encoded Ela protein."
https://openalex.org/W1523169583,"Treatment of hepatocytes with 2,5-di-(tert-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone (tBuBHQ), a novel mobilizer of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ pool, produces a sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i (Kass, G. E. N., Duddy, S. K., and Orrenius, S. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 15192-15198). Exposure of hepatocytes to the Ca2(+)-mobilizing hormones, vasopressin, angiotensin II, or ATP following [Ca2+]i elevation by tBuBHQ produced a rapid return of [Ca2+]i to basal or near basal levels. Release of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ pool by tBuBHQ following pretreatment with vasopressin or angiotensin II resulted in a [Ca2+]i transient and not the sustained [Ca2+]i elevation observed in the absence of the Ca2(+)-mobilizing hormones. The G-protein activator, NaF plus AlCl3, mimicked both effects of the Ca2(+)-mobilizing hormones on [Ca2+]i. The mechanism for Ca2+ removal from the cytosol by Ca2(+)-mobilizing hormones did not involve cyclic nucleotides nor did it require protein kinase C activation or cyclo- and lipoxygenase-dependent metabolites of arachidonic acid. Furthermore, the hormone-mediated decrease in [Ca2+]i did not involve the pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi-protein. Removal of the tBuBHQ-mobilized Ca2+ from the cytosol of hepatocytes by Ca2(+)-mobilizing hormones was mediated by stimulation of a Ca2+ efflux pathway. Thus, in addition to initiating [Ca2+]i transients by releasing Ca2+ from the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ store and stimulating Ca2+ influx, Ca2(+)-mobilizing hormones also regulate the termination of the [Ca2+]i transient by stimulating a Ca2+ efflux pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1574807898,"Abstract The two iron-only hydrogenases (I and II) from Clostridium pasteurianum have been investigated by variable temperature magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies. Samples were studied both reduced with dithionite under an atmosphere of H2 and after oxidation with thionine. The results are consistent with four and two [4Fe-4S]1+,2+ (F)-clusters in hydrogenases I and II, respectively. All four F-clusters are reduced and paramagnetic in reduced hydrogenase I, with up to one exhibiting an S = 3/2 ground state and the remainder having conventional S = 1/2 ground states. Both F-clusters have S = 1/2 ground states in reduced hydrogenase II; however, one appears to be only partially reduced under the conditions used for reduction. MCD studies of the oxidized enzymes show no temperature-dependent features in the visible region which can be attributed to the EPR-active S = 1/2 hydrogen-activating cluster, suggesting predominantly oxygen and nitrogen coordination for the iron atoms of this center. However, temperature-dependent MCD transitions arising from a hitherto undetected S greater than 1/2 Fe-S clusters are apparent in both oxidized hydrogenases. Detailed EPR studies of oxidized hydrogenase I revealed resonances from an S = 3/2 species, however, spin quantitation reveals this to be a trace component that is unlikely to be responsible for the observed low temperature MCD spectrum. The nature and origin of these S greater than 1/2 Fe-S clusters are discussed in light of the available spectroscopic data for these and other iron-only hydrogenases."
https://openalex.org/W1536004934,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) is a potent inhibitor of adrenocortical cell differentiated functions, whereas corticotropin (ACTH) is the main physiological hormone which acts positively on these functions. We have studied the effects of both TGF beta and ACTH on ovine adrenocortical cell ACTH receptors. Ovine adrenocortical cells contained specific high affinity (Kd = 2.7 +/- 1.6 x 10(-10) M) and low capacity (1190 +/- 120 sites/cell) ACTH receptors. Pretreatment of cells with TGF beta resulted in a time- and dose-dependent (ED50 = 50 pg/ml) decrease of 125I-ACTH1-39 binding. The observed decrease in ACTH binding was due to a 2-3-fold decrease in the number of binding sites without modification of the binding affinity. On the contrary, pretreatment of cells with ACTH caused a 4-4.5-fold increase in the number of ACTH binding sites without an effect on the Kd. When cells were pretreated with both ACTH and TGF beta, TGF beta blocked completely the positive trophic effect of ACTH on its own receptors. The variations in ACTH receptor number were associated with parallel changes on acute ACTH-induced cyclic AMP production. Thus, the effects of TGF beta on ACTH receptor content are likely another important negative action of this peptide on adrenocortical cell differentiation. Moreover, these results suggest that regulation of ACTH receptor number may be one mechanism by which hormones and growth factors control adrenocortical differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1572920176,"Abstract Several studies have suggested that heterogeneity exists in the type I insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptor beta subunit. We have examined type I IGF receptor mRNA transcripts by ribonuclease (RNase) protection assay to determine if the heterogeneity could result from alternative splicing of the gene. An area that corresponded to the nucleotide sequence just upstream of the region encoding the transmembrane domain of the beta subunit was identified as being a potential site of alteration in the transcript. Since the 5' and 3' ends were known, polymerase chain reaction was used to clone a cDNA that included this region. Analysis revealed that an alternate type I IGF receptor mRNA transcript with a 3-base pair deletion could account for the results of the RNase protection assay. The deletion changes the amino acid sequence at position 899 substituting Arg for a Thr-Gly. Furthermore, this alternate transcript was ubiquitously found in tissue and cell line RNAs. Although the identified transcript cannot fully account for the documented heterogeneity in type I IGF receptor beta subunit sizes, the results suggest that a form of the beta subunit with an alternate primary sequence may exist."
https://openalex.org/W1495692294,"Abstract Competition between Ca2+ and Mg2+ for binding to a single high affinity site on actin has been confirmed. Occupancy of this site only by either Ca2+ or Mg2+ affects the conformation of actin and its ability to form nuclei and hydrolyze ATP. G-actin binds the beta gamma-bidentate CrATP, a substitution inert analog of metal-ATP complexes, and shows a high specificity for the lambda isomers. Binding of CrATP to ADP-actin is accompanied by the dissociation of tightly bound ADP and Ca2+. CrATP-actin shows a high tendency to form nuclei, like MgATP-actin. Polymerization of CrATP-actin is accompanied by cleavage of the gamma-phosphate, but subsequent Pi release cannot occur because the product of the reaction is the stable CrADP-Pi complex. All these results support the view that the divalent metal ion tightly bound to actin interacts with the beta- and gamma-phosphates of ATP in the nucleotide site."
https://openalex.org/W1555816121,"Abstract An enzyme catalyzing homologous pairing of DNA chains has been extensively purified from mitotic yeast. The most highly purified fractions are enriched for a polypeptide with a molecular mass of approximately 120 kDa as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein-dependent pairing of single-stranded DNAs requires a divalent cation (Mg2+ or Ca2+) but proceeds rapidly in the absence of any nucleoside triphosphates. The kinetics of reassociation are extremely rapid, with more than 60% of the single-stranded DNA becoming resistant to S1 nuclease within 1 min at a ratio of 1 protein monomer/50 nucleotides. The results of enzyme titration and DNA challenge experiments suggest that this protein does not act catalytically during renaturation but is required stoichiometrically. The protein promotes formation of joint molecules between linear M13 replicative form DNA (form III) containing short single-stranded tails and homologous single-stranded M13 viral DNA. Removal of approximately 50 nucleotides from the ends of the linear duplex using either exonuclease III (5' ends) or T7 gene 6 exonuclease (3' ends) activates the duplex for extensive strand exchange. Electron microscopic analysis of product molecules suggests that the homologous circular DNA initially associates with the single-stranded tails of the duplexes, and the heteroduplex region is extended with displacement of the noncomplementary strand. The ability of this protein to pair and to promote strand transfer using either exonuclease III or T7 gene 6 exonuclease-treated duplex substrates suggests that this activity promotes heteroduplex extension in a nonpolar fashion. The biochemical properties of the transferase are consistent with a role for this protein in heteroduplex joint formation during mitotic recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae."
https://openalex.org/W1505655411,"Previous photoaffinity-labeling studies with [3H]azidopine, (+) [3H]PN200-110, and [3H]LU 49888 have demonstrated that 1,4-dihydropyridines (nifedipine-like drugs) and phenylalkylamines (verapamil-like drugs) bind exclusively to the 165-kDa alpha 1 subunit of skeletal muscle calcium channels. However, it has not been conclusively determined whether benzothiazepines (diltiazem-like drugs), which represent the third group of calcium antagonists, also bind to the alpha 1 subunit. Here we report data obtained with a newly developed benzothiazepine photoaffinity probe, [3H]azidobutyryl diltiazem. This drug competes with diltiazem for the benzothiazepine-binding site and, in purified calcium channel preparations, specifically labels the 165-kDa polypeptide which does not change its electrophoretic mobility upon disulfide reduction. These data show that benzothiazepines, just like 1,4-dihydropyridines and phenylalkylamines, bind to the alpha 1 subunit of the skeletal muscle calcium channels."

Chem. 264, 21131-21137) described the purification to apparent homogeneity from rabbit liver, of a heterotypic complex comprising valyl-tRNA synthetase and Elongation Factor 1H. In the present study, valyl-tRNA synthetase was dissociated and separated from the other components of this complex by hydroxylapatite chromatography in the presence of 0.5 M NaSCN. The properties of the homogeneous mammalian enzyme were compared to those of the corresponding enzyme from yeast. Both behaved as monomeric entities, with apparent molecular masses of 140 and 125 kDa, respectively. Furthermore, both displayed strong affinity toward the polyanionic support heparin-Ultrogel, a property not manifested by the corresponding prokaryotic enzyme. However, unlike the yeast enzyme, that of mammalian origin additionally exhibited hydrophobic properties, as reflected by its affinity toward phenyl-Sepharose. A structural model is proposed according to which mammalian valyl-tRNA synthetase has conserved the polycationic N-terminal domain that distinguishes the corresponding lower eukaryotic enzyme from its prokaryotic counterpart, while acquiring a hydrophobic domain most likely responsible for its association to Elongation Factor 1H."
https://openalex.org/W1538180920,"Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is able to activate the respiratory burst oxidase in a system containing cytosol and solubilized membranes from human neutrophils. When SDS was used to treat cytosol in an otherwise identical system in which the solubilized membrane solution was omitted, the ability of the SDS-treated cytosol to support O2- production was lost in a first-order reaction whose rate constant was virtually identical to the rate constant for the first-order activation of the oxidase in the complete system. Studies with chronic granulomatous disease cytosols showed that the component whose activity was lost was the oxidase-related 67-kDa cytosolic protein. The similarity in the rates of oxidase activation and p67 inactivation suggested that the activation of the respiratory burst oxidase in the cell-free system could involve an SDS-mediated alteration in p67. Further support for this idea was provided by kinetic experiments demonstrating that, although the yield of oxidase showed a 2.5-order dependence on cytosol concentration, oxidase activation was nevertheless kinetically irreversible. These two findings, incompatible in general, can be reconciled by a mechanism in which SDS acts specifically on a single oxidase component (i.e. p67), but with an effect that depends on circumstances: oxidase activation, if the SDS-sensitive component is part of a completely assembled oxidase precursor; loss of p67 activity, if not."
https://openalex.org/W1589541158,"Kinetics of regulation of membrane receptors for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) in human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells was investigated. When MCF-7 cells were incubated with radioiodinated human recombinant TNF, they bound TNF specifically and accumulated it intracellularly. Preincubation of cells with native TNF up to 1 x 10(-9) M for 12 h stimulated specific binding of TNF, indicating that concentrations of membrane receptors for TNF were regulated by the ligand. Accumulation of radioactivity in cells incubated with [125I]TNF proceeded at a constant rate for up to 24 h. Kinetics of binding and internalization of TNF were similar in the presence and absence of protein synthesis for at least 1 h, suggesting that the TNF receptor was either replenished from an intracellular pool of receptors or was recycled (reutilized) during the course of TNF internalization. Data were analyzed kinetically by fitting equations of compartmental models of ligand-cell interactions with and without the term for receptor recycling. Fits were obtained only for the model with receptor recycling; absence of the term for receptor recycling resulted in physically impossible best-fit parameter values. Analysis of the best-fit parameters indicated that both internalization and recycling of the receptor were stimulated by the ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1500244768,"The STE2 gene of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a 431-residue polypeptide that has been shown by chemical cross-linking and genetic studies to be a component of the receptor for the peptide mating pheromone, alpha-factor. To demonstrate directly that the ligand binding site of the alpha-factor receptor is comprised solely of the STE2 gene product, the STE2 protein was expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Oocytes microinjected with synthetic STE2 mRNA displayed specific surface binding for 35S-labeled alpha-factor (up to 40 sites/micron2/ng RNA). Oocytes injected with either STE2 antisense RNA or heterologous receptor mRNA (nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha, beta, gamma, and delta subunit mRNAs) showed no binding activity (indistinguishable from uninjected control oocytes). The apparent KD (7 nM) of the alpha-factor binding sites expressed on the oocyte surface, determined by competition binding studies, agreed with the values reported for intact yeast cells and yeast plasma membrane fractions. These findings demonstrate that the STE2 gene product is the only yeast polypeptide required for biogenesis of a functional alpha-factor receptor. Electrophysiological measurements indicated that the membrane conductance of oocytes injected with STE2 mRNA, or with both STE2 and GPA1 (encoding a yeast G protein alpha-subunit) mRNAs, did not change and was not affected by pheromone binding. Thus, the alpha-factor receptor, like mammalian G protein-coupled receptors, apparently lacks activity as an intrinsic or ligand-gated ion channel. This report is the first instance in which a membrane-bound receptor from a unicellular eukaryote has been expressed in a vertebrate cell."
https://openalex.org/W1579065292,"Abstract The recA protein promotes the formation and processing of joint molecules of homologous double- and single-stranded DNAs in vitro. Under a set of specified conditions, we found that the substitution of a single amino acid in the recA protein (recA430 mutation) depresses its activity for the homologous pairing to about 1/100 of that by the wild type protein when compared by the rate for the first 2-3 min of the reaction, but that the mutation only slightly, if at all, affects its ability to bind progressively to double-stranded DNA to unwind the double helix (processive unwinding). This is in striking contrast to an anti-recA protein monoclonal IgG, ARM193, which severely inhibits the processive unwinding but not the homologous pairing, providing further support for our conclusion that the homologous pairing and processive unwinding are functionally independent of each other. Antibody ARM193 caused the breakdown of spontaneously formed filaments of the recA protein, but the recA430 mutation did not affect the self-polymerization of the protein. The recA430 protein was apparently proficient in the functional binding to a single-stranded DNA and in the hydrolysis of ATP. However, we found that under the above conditions the mutant protein was defective as to homology-independent conjunction of DNA molecules to form a (of macromolecules). These results suggest that (i) only one DNA-binding site is sufficient for the recA protein to promote the processive unwinding (the ability of the protein to form spontaneous filaments is closely related to this process) and that (ii) two DNA-binding sites on each of the recA polypeptides or those composed of a dimer (or oligomer) of the polypeptide are required for the recA protein to promote both the conjunction of parental DNA molecules and the homologous pairing (the ability to form the spontaneous filaments is not essential to this process). (iii) The simultaneous inactivation of the activity to promote the homologous pairing and that to form the ternary complex by the single substitution of the amino acid provides a physical support for the conclusion that the ternary complex is an indispensable intermediate in the homologous pairing."
