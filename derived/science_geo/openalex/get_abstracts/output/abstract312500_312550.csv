https://openalex.org/W1973438267,"Since the dawn of the industrial era, the atmospheric concentrations of several radiatively active gases have been increasing as a result of human activities. The radiative heating from this inadvertent experiment has driven the climate system out of equilibrium with the incoming solar energy. According to the greenhouse theory of climate change, the climate system will be restored to equilibrium by a warming of the surfacetroposphere system and a cooling of the stratosphere. The predicted changes, during the next few decades, could far exceed natural climate variations in historical times. Hence, the greenhouse theory of climate change has reached the crucial stage of verification. Surface warming as large as that predicted by models would be unprecedented during an interglacial period such as the present. The theory, its scope for verification, and the emerging complexities of the climate feedback mechanisms are discussed."

Analyses of the particle size, composition, and mass accumulation rate of dust grains provide independent evidence of the intensity of atmospheric circulation and the availability of material in the eolian source region. These data provide information on atmospheric circulation and on the climate of the source area at time scales ranging from 103 to 108 years and have the potential to test computer-generated global circulation models."
https://openalex.org/W1967349283,"Although amino acid auxotrophs are among the most frequently isolated mutations in microorganisms, no mutants that require amino acids have been isolated at the whole plant level. Tryptophan-requiring mutants of the cruciferous plant Arabidopsis thaliana have now been isolated by selecting for resistance to 5-methylanthranilic acid. The tryptophan requirement of one mutant, trp1-1, results from a defect in the second step of the tryptophan pathway catalyzed by anthranilate phosphoribosyl transferase. Mutant trp1-1 plants are highly fluorescent and aromatic because they accumulate anthranilic acid and anthranilate β-glucoside. Plants homozygous for the trp1-1 mutation exhibit a syndrome of morphological defects suggestive of a defect in the biosynthesis, metabolism, or localization of a tryptophan derivative such as auxin. All of these morphological phenotypes cosegregate with the tryptophan requirement as a simple Mendelian recessive trait."
https://openalex.org/W2063582321,"In order to investigate the functional significance of membrane lipid unsaturation, we have isolated a series of mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana which are deficient in particular membrane fatty acids. The first of these mutants completely lacks Δ3-trans-hexadecenoate, an acyl group that until now has been thought to play an important role in the structure or function of thylakoid membranes in photosynthetic eukaryotes. The apparent absence of any marked physiological effect of the mutation illustrates the potential of this approach to the analysis of membrane structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W1969251157,"The aggregation of displaying males in lek-breeding birds is often associated with disruption of courtship and mating but effects of this disruption on mate choice have not been shown. In a 4-year study of Rupicola rupicola in Suriname, interference among territorial adult males disrupted 31 percent of all female courtship visits and terminated 32 percent of all matings at a lek where there were an average of 55 territorial males. Disruption in this rain forest species caused females to modify their courtship and mating patterns, and males that used intense and persistent disruption received a disproportionate share of this redirected mate choice."
https://openalex.org/W2095533110,Laser-controlled chemical reactions are being explored for use in all phases of the processing of semiconductor devices. Laser-induced chemical processing can produce submicrometer features without the aid of photolithography. Research is also providing new information on light-excited and light-enhanced interface reactions.
https://openalex.org/W2035825795,"Three instances of R gene instability were found in maize stocks carrying the controlling elements Dissociation (Ds) and Modulator (Mp). In each, Ds or a Ds-like element had transposed to R, inhibiting kernel pigmentation irregularly. When Mp was removed from the genome, R expression stabilized at low to intermediate levels. Strong pigmenting action was restored through recombination in heterozygotes of the three new forms with an R allele that specifies only plant pigmentation. The sites of Ds insertion mapped distal to the region that specifies seed versus plant expression. The evidence suggests that an R functional unit consists of one component that both governs tissue-specific expression and another that is common to alleles of different tissue-specific activities"

https://openalex.org/W2062764982,"An industrial relations system describes the basic values, laws, institutions, and organizational practices that govern employment relationships. To be effective, an industrial relations system must be well matched to its economic and social environment and able to meet the strategic needs of employers, the workforce, and the larger society. The current state of American industrial relations is assessed against these criteria. The general proposition advanced is that the U.S. system of industrial relations that grew out of the New Deal labor legislation of the 1930s performed effectively from the 1940s through the 1960s. Pressures for change on the system began to build through the 1970s because of changes in the economic and technological environment and in the strategic behavior and needs of the parties. These pressures erupted in the early 1980s to produce a period of experimentation and fundamental change in union-management relations. The critical question in industrial relations today is whether the process of adaptation will be sustained and expanded to cover a broader range of employment relationships."

https://openalex.org/W2014676842,"The papers presented at the International Conference on High-Temperature Superconductors and Materials and Mechanism of Superconductivity in Interklaken, Switzerland on 29 February to 4 March, 1988 are briefly reviewed from a newsworthy standpoint. The conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory developed in 1957 to help understand the microscopic behavior of current flow in almost all earlier superconducting materials is reviewed briefly. The most recent developments in superconducting materials, the thallium- and bismuth-based materials, are discussed. The transmission of new information by facsimile machines even as the conference was in progress was evidence of the rapidity with which the field of superconducting materials was changing. Organic semiconductor materials and heavy electron superconductors such as UPt/sub 3/ and UBe/sub 13/ are mentioned briefly."
