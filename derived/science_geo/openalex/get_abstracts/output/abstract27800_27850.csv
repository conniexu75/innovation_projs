https://openalex.org/W2060786724,"Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) is a DNA tumor virus that is associated with human anogenital cancers and encodes two transforming proteins, E6 and E7. The E7 protein has been shown to bind to the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene product, pRB. This study shows that the E6 protein of HPV-16 is capable of binding to the cellular p53 protein. The ability of the E6 proteins from different human papillomaviruses to form complexes with p53 was assayed and found to correlate with the in vivo clinical behavior and the in vitro transforming activity of these different papillomaviruses. The wild-type p53 protein has tumor suppressor properties and has also been found in association with large T antigen and the E1B 55-kilodalton protein in cells transformed by SV40 and by adenovirus type 5, respectively, providing further evidence that the human papillomaviruses, the adenoviruses, and SV40 may effect similar cellular pathways in transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1481438484,"A newly synthesized isoquinolinesulfonamide, H-89 (N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinoline-sulfonamide), was shown to have a potent and selective inhibitory action against cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A), with an inhibition constant of 0.048 +/- 0.008 microM. H-89 exhibited weak inhibitory action against other kinases and Ki values of the compound for these kinases, including cGMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase G), Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C), casein kinase I and II, myosin light chain kinase, and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II were 0.48 +/- 0.13, 31.7 +/- 15.9, 38.3 +/- 6.0, 136.7 +/- 17.0, 28.3 +/- 17.5, and 29.7 +/- 8.1 microM, respectively. Kinetic analysis indicated that H-89 inhibits protein kinase A, in competitive fashion against ATP. To examine the role of protein kinase A in neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells, H-89 was applied along with nerve growth factor (NGF), forskolin, or dibutyryl cAMP. Pretreatment with H-89 led to a dose-dependent inhibition of the forskolin-induced protein phosphorylation, with no decrease in intracellular cyclic AMP levels in PC12D cells, and the NGF-induced protein phosphorylation was not not inhibited. H-89 also significantly inhibited the forskolin-induced neurite outgrowth from PC12D cells. This inhibition also occurred when H-89 was added before the addition of dibutyryl cAMP. Pretreatment of PC12D cells with H-89 (30 microM) inhibited significantly cAMP-dependent histone IIb phosphorylation activity in cell lysates but did not affect other protein phosphorylation activity such as cGMP-dependent histone IIb phosphorylation activity, Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent histone IIIs phosphorylation activity, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain phosphorylation activity, and alpha-casein phosphorylation activity. However, this protein kinase A inhibitor did not inhibit the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth from PC12D cells. Thus, the forskolin- and dibutyryl cAMP-induced neurite outgrowth is apparently mediated by protein kinase A while the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth is mediated by a protein kinase A-independent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2002945532,"The neurotrophic proteins BDNF and NGF are related in their primary structures, and both have high- and low-affinity receptors on their responsive neurons. In this study, we investigate the extent to which these receptors can discriminate between BDNF and NGF. We found that a 1000-fold excess of the heterologous ligand is needed to reduce binding to the high-affinity receptor by 50%, but that the same concentrations of BDNF and NGF similarly reduce the binding of either ligand to the low-affinity receptor. Results obtained with cells transfected with the low-affinity NGF receptor gene indicate that these cells bind BDNF, in addition to NGF, whereas cells before transfection do not. These data indicate that the low-affinity NGF receptor is also a low-affinity BDNF receptor and that whatever is conferring high-affinity binding and biological response also considerably reinforces the ability of the low-affinity receptor to discriminate between NGF and BDNF."
https://openalex.org/W2078835916,"Profilin is generally thought to regulate actin polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and actin raised the possibility that profilin might also regulate lipid metabolism. Profilin isolated from platelets binds with high affinity to small clusters of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) molecules in micelles and also in bilayers with other phospholipids. The molar ratio of the complex of profilin with PIP2 is 1:7 in micelles of pure PIP2 and 1:5 in bilayers composed largely of other phospholipids. Profilin competes efficiently with platelet cytosolic phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C for interaction with the PIP2 substrate and thereby inhibits PIP2 hydrolysis by this enzyme. The cellular concentrations and binding characteristics of these molecules are consistent with profilin being a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in addition to its established function as an inhibitor of actin polymerization."
https://openalex.org/W2081861970,"The ras proto-oncogene products appear to relay intracellular signals via the Ras guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activator protein, GAP. In dog epithelial cells expressing human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors, binding of PDGF caused approximately one-tenth of the total GAP molecules to complex with the receptor. Studies with mutant PDGF receptors showed that maximum association required both receptor kinase activity and phosphorylatable tyrosine residues at both the identified sites of receptor autophosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W1487780734,"The receptor for human urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) was purified from phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated U937 cells by temperature-induced phase separation of detergent extracts, followed by affinity chromatography with immobilized diisopropyl fluorophosphate-treated u-PA. The purified protein shows a single 55-60 kDa band after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining. It is a heavily glycosylated protein, the deglycosylated polypeptide chain comprising only 35 kDa. The glycosylated protein contains N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and sialic acid, but no N-acetyl-D-galactosamine. Glycosylation is responsible for substantial heterogeneity in the receptor on phorbol ester-stimulated U937 cells, and also for molecular weight variations among various cell lines. The amino acid composition and the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence are reported. The protein has a high content of cysteine residues. The NH2-terminal sequence is not closely related to any known sequence. The identification of the purified and sequenced protein with the human u-PA receptor is based on the following findings: 1) the ability of the purified protein to bind u-PA and its amino-terminal fragment; 2) the identical electrophoretic mobilities observed for cross-linked conjugates, formed between either the purified protein or the u-PA receptor on intact U937 cells and the above ligands; 3) the identity of the apparent molecular weight of the purified protein to that predicted for the u-PA receptor in the same cross-linking studies; 4) the identical extent of glycosylation of the purified protein and of the u-PA receptor in crude membrane fractions, as detected after cross-linking; 5) the ability of antibodies raised against the purified protein to inhibit cellular binding of the amino-terminal fragment of u-PA."
https://openalex.org/W2063685774,"High concentrations of potent N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) agonists can trigger degeneration of cultured mouse cortical neurons after an exposure of only a few minutes; in contrast, selective non-NMDA agonists or low levels of NMDA agonists require exposures of several hours to induce comparable damage. The dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist nifedipine was used to test whether this slow neurotoxicity is mediated by a calcium influx through voltage-gated channels. Nifedipine had little effect on the widespread neuronal degeneration induced by brief exposure to high concentrations of NMDA but substantially attenuated the neurotoxicity produced by 24-hour exposure to submaximal concentrations of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate, kainate, or quinolinate. Calcium ion influx through dihydropyridine-sensitive, voltage-dependent calcium channels may be an important step in the neuronal injury induced by the prolonged activation of NMDA or non-NMDA glutamate receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1543368646,"The M1-muscarinic cholinergic receptor (M1AChR) stimulates the release of inositol phosphates (IPs) but does not activate adenylyl cyclase. The beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) stimulates adenylyl cyclase but has no effect on IP release. Amino acid sequences corresponding to the second (I2) and third (I3) intracellular loops of the turkey erythrocyte beta-AR and a 12-amino acid segment near the N-terminal end of the I3 region were substituted into the corresponding regions of the human M1AChR. Chimeric receptors that contained either the entire I3 loop or the N-terminal dodecapeptide of that loop both mediated the 2-4-fold stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity in membrane fractions of COS, A293, or Sf9 cells in response to carbachol. These chimeric receptors also retained the ability to stimulate IP release to the same extent as did the M1AChR. In COS cells transfected with the I3 chimeric receptor, the EC50 for carbachol was approximately 7 microM for the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and approximately 2 microM for the release of IP; M1AChR-mediated IP release displayed an EC50 of approximately 0.2 microM. Substitution of the I2 region of the beta-AR into the M1AChR did not by itself alter selectivity for signaling. However, the I2+I3 and I2+dodecapeptide combined replacements stimulated adenylyl cyclase fully and caused at most 25% of the maximal stimulation of IP release observed with the M1AChR. Thus, a small region in the third cytoplasmic loop can alter the G proteins to which a receptor is coupled, but interaction among loops is evidently involved in fully determining G protein selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W1522206572,"The processing of precursor interleukin 1 beta (IL1 beta) by elastase, cathepsin G, and collagenase, the major proteases released at sites of inflammation, was investigated using recombinant pro-IL1 beta. Each of these proteases cleaved the 31-kDa inactive precursor to a form similar in size and specific activity (greater than 10(8) units/mg) to the 17-kDa mature protein isolated from activated monocytes. Elastase, collagenase, and cathepsin G cleaved the IL1 beta precursor at distinct sites which are amino-terminal to the monocyte-processing site, Ala-117 (Cameron, P., Lumjuco, G., Rodkey, J., Bennett, C., and Schmidt, J. A. (1985) J. Exp. Med. 162, 790-801). Amino-terminal sequencing of the products of digestion by elastase and cathepsin G determined that resultant active IL1 beta proteins contained an additional 13 or 3 amino acids relative to mature IL1 beta. Synovial fluid collected from patients with inflammatory polyarthritis and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with sarcoidosis supplied similar processing activity(s). Control fluids from patients who had no symptoms of inflammatory disease did not exhibit processing activity. Lavage fluids that processed precursor IL1 beta were demonstrated to contain cathepsin G and/or elastase activity, whereas controls were negative. Because a significant fraction of IL1 beta may be secreted from monocytes as the inactive 31-kDa precursor (Hazuda, D. J., Lee, J. C., and Young, P. R. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8473-8479, Bomford, R., Absull, E., Hughes-Jenkins, C., Simpkin, D., and Schmidt, J. (1987) Immunology 62, 543-549, and Mizel, S. B. (1988) in Cellular and Molecular Aspects of Inflammation Poste, G., and Crooke, S., eds) pp. 75-93, Plenum Publishing Corp., New York), these results suggest that in vivo the IL1 beta precursor can be processed after secretion by any of several proteases released at inflammatory sites."
https://openalex.org/W1532704140,"Tetracycline uptake into inverted membrane vesicles from Tn10-bearing Escherichia coli cells required divalent cations. The degree of the stimulation of tetracycline uptake by various divalent cations showed the following decreasing order: Co2+ greater than Mn2+ greater than Mg2+ greater than Cd2+ greater than Ca2+. This order is consistent with the increasing order of the dissociation constants for metal chelate complexes of tetracycline. The Hill constants for the tetracycline uptake rate with various divalent cation concentrations were one. These observations strongly suggested that a 1:1 complex of tetracycline and a divalent cation was transported by a tetracycline resistance protein. This notion was confirmed by our observations that 60Co2+ was actively taken up with tetracycline by the membrane vesicles prepared from resistant cells. In the absence of tetracycline, no uptake of 60Co2+ was observed. It is clear that the 60Co2+ uptake was mediated by the tetracycline resistance protein, because the membrane vesicles from tetracycline-sensitive cells did not show the uptake of 60Co2+ and tetracycline. The 60Co2+ uptake was inhibited in the presence of other divalent cations, without any significant effect on tetracycline uptake, indicating that these cations are also transported with tetracycline by the tetracycline resistance protein."
https://openalex.org/W1532668077,"Sex hormone-binding globulins (SHBG) is a plasma glycoprotein that binds certain steroids. It, in turn, binds to a specific receptor on cell membranes. This work was undertaken to investigate the role of steroids in the interaction of SHBG with its receptor. Because the probe for the interaction of SHBG with its receptor is 125I-SHBG, we first showed that 125I-SHBG binds [3H]dihydrotestosterone (DHT) at 4 degrees C and 37 degrees C with KD values similar to those published previously for pure radioinert SHBG. 125I-SHBG could be prevented from binding to its receptor by a variety of steroids whose relative inhibitory activity (dihydrotestosterone much greater than 2-methoxyestradiol greater than testosterone greater than estradiol much greater than methyltrienolone greater than cortisol) was almost identical to their relative ability to bind to SHBG. Because significant binding of [3H]DHT to the SHBG receptor could not be demonstrated, steroid inhibition of SHBG binding must be noncompetitive. If steroids bound to SHBG prevent binding to the SHBG receptor, then liganded SHBG should have a higher apparent KD for its receptor than unliganded SHBG. This is the case. The KD was 0.86 +/- 0.25 nM for the high affinity receptor site using liganded SHBG and 0.19 +/- 0.024 nM for unliganded SHBG. Thus, only liganded SHBG assumes a conformation that prohibits interaction with the SHBG receptor. However, when unliganded SHBG was prebound to its receptor, it retained its ability to bind [3H] DHT. The model that emerges from these observations is as follows. Unliganded SHBG can bind either steroids or receptor in a reversible reaction; SHBG bound to a steroid cannot bind to the receptor, but unliganded SHBG that first binds to the receptor can subsequently bind steroids."

https://openalex.org/W1590182320,"Recognition of substrates by the protein kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) usually requires prior phosphorylation of the substrate. Using a peptide based on the glycogen synthase sequence PRPAS(3a)VPPS (3b)PSLS(3c)RHSS(4)PHQS(5)EDEEEP (where the numbers in parentheses denote sites of phosphorylation), we showed previously that phosphorylation of site 5 by casein kinase II was necessary for GSK-3 to phosphorylate the peptide at sites 3a, 3b, 3c, and 4 (Fiol, C. J., Mahrenholz, A. M., Wang, Y., Roeske, R. W., and Roach, P. J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 14042-14048). In the present study, variant peptides were synthesized in which sites 3a, 3b, 3c, and 4 were individually replaced by Ala residues (denoted Ala-3c, etc.). All of the variant peptides were substrates for casein kinase II. The peptide Ala-4,Ser(P)-5 was not a substrate for GSK-3 confirming the minimal recognition sequence for the protein kinase as -SXXXS(P)-. The peptides Ala-3c,Ser(P)-5, Ala-3b,Ser(P)-5, and Ala-3a,Ser(P)-5, however, were all good substrates for GSK-3 with apparent Km values in the range 3-6 microns, comparable with that of the parent peptide. GSK-3 could introduce 1, 2, and 3 phosphates, respectively, into these substrates, always COOH-terminal to the substituted Ala residue. Ala-4,Ser(P)-5 and Ala-3c,Ser(P)-4,Ser(P)-5 were competitive inhibitors for phosphorylation of the parent peptide, with Ki values of 2 and 5 microns, respectively. The data suggest (i) that GSK-3 recognizes serines in the motif -SXXXS(P)-, and (ii) that multiple phosphorylation of the peptide substrate has an obligate order, with the sequential formation of new recognition sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1926332751,"Actin depolymerization specifically blocks the rapid thyroid hormone-dependent inactivation of type II iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase. Thyroid hormone appears to regulate enzyme inactivation by modulating actin-mediated internalization of this plasma membrane-bound protein. In this study, we examined the interrelationships between thyroxine-dependent enzyme inactivation and the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in cultured astrocytes. Steady-state enzyme levels were inversely related to actin content in dibutyryl cAMP-stimulated astrocytes, and increases in filamentous actin resulted in progressively shorter enzyme half-lives without affecting enzyme synthesis. In the absence of thyroxine, filamentous actin decreased by approximately 40% and soluble actin correspondingly increased; thyroxine normalized filamentous actin levels without changing total cell actin. Thyroxine treatment for only 10 min resulted in an approximately 50% loss of enzyme and increased filamentous actin 2-fold. Neither cycloheximide nor actinomycin D affected the thyroxine-induced actin polymerization. Astrocytes grown without thyroxine also showed a disorganized actin cytoskeleton, and 10 nM thyroxine or 10 nM reverse triiodothyronine normalized the actin cytoskeleton appearance within 20 min; 10 nM 3,3',5-triiodothyronine had no effect. These data show that thyroxine modulates the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in astrocytes and suggest that regulation of actin polymerization may contribute to thyroid hormone's influence on arborization, axonal transport, and cell-cell contact in the developing brain."

https://openalex.org/W2009995344,"A complementary DNA (cDNA) clone that encodes inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase was isolated from a rat brain cDNA expression library with the use of monoclonal antibodies. This clone had an open reading frame that would direct the synthesis of a protein consisting of 449 amino acids and with a molecular mass of 49,853 daltons. The putative protein revealed a potential calmodulin-binding site and six regions with amino acid compositions (PEST regions) common to proteins that are susceptible to calpain. Expression of the cDNA in COS cells resulted in an approximately 150-fold increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase activity of these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1559390072,"We have previously shown that platelets adhere to collagen substrates via a Mg2(+)-dependent mechanism mediated by the surface glycoprotein Ia-IIa (human leukocyte very late activation protein 2, alpha 2 beta 1 integrin) complex. The adhesion is specific for collagen and is supported by collagen types I, II, III, IV, and VI. Several other members of the integrin family of adhesive protein receptors recognize discrete linear amino acid sequences within their adhesive glycoprotein ligands. Experiments with both intact platelets and with liposomes containing the purified receptor complex indicated that the alpha 2 beta 1 receptor recognized denatured type I collagen in a Mg2(+)-dependent manner. To further localize the binding site, the alpha 1 and alpha 2 chains of type I collagen were purified by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography and tested as adhesive substrates. Both the alpha 1(I) and alpha 2(I) chains effectively supported Mg2(+)-dependent platelet adhesion. The purified alpha 1(I) collagen chain was then subjected to cleavage with cyanogen bromide, and the resultant peptides were separated by chromatography on carboxymethylcellulose. Only the alpha 1(I)-CB3 fragment supported Mg2(+)-dependent platelet adhesion. The monoclonal antibody P1H5 which recognizes an epitope on the alpha 2 subunit of the integrin receptor and which inhibits the adhesion of both intact platelets and liposomes bearing the purified receptor to collagen also inhibited platelet adhesion to the alpha 1(I)-CB3 fragment. These results indicate that the alpha 2 beta 1 receptor recognizes a sequence of amino acids present in the alpha 1(I)-CB3 fragment of type I collagen. An identical or similar sequence likely mediates binding of the receptor to other collagen polypeptides."
https://openalex.org/W1591439874,"Mammalian liver peroxisomes are capable of beta-oxidizing a variety of substrates including very long chain fatty acids and the side chains of the bile acid intermediates di- and trihydroxycoprostanic acid. The first enzyme of peroxisomal beta-oxidation is acyl-CoA oxidase. It remains unknown whether peroxisomes possess one or several acyl-CoA oxidases. Peroxisomal oxidases from rat liver were partially purified by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation and heat treatment, and the preparation was subjected to chromatofocusing, chromatography on hydroxylapatite and dye affinity matrices, and gel filtration. The column eluates were assayed for palmitoyl-CoA and trihydroxycoprostanoyl-CoA oxidase activities and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The results revealed the presence of three acyl-CoA oxidases: 1) a fatty acyl-CoA oxidase with a pI of 8.3 and an apparent molecular mass of 145 kDa. The enzyme consisted mainly of 52- and 22.5-kDa subunits and could be induced by clofibrate treatment; 2) a noninducible fatty acyl-CoA oxidase with a pI of 7.1 and an apparent molecular mass of 427 kDa. It consisted mainly, if not exclusively, of one polypeptide component of 71 kDa; and 3) a noninducile trihydroxycoprostanoyl-CoA oxidase with a pI of 7.1 and an apparent molecular mass of 139 kDa. It consisted mainly, if not exclusively, of one polypeptide component of 69 kDa. Our findings are probably related to the recent discovery of two species of acyl-CoA oxidase mRNA in rat liver (Miyazawa, S., Hayashi, H., Hijikata, M., Ishii, N., Furata, S., Kagamiyama, H., Osumi, T., and Hashimoto, T. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 8131-8137) and they probably also explain why in human peroxisomal beta-oxidation defects an accumulation of very long chain fatty acids is not always accompanied by an excretion of bile acid intermediates and vice versa."
https://openalex.org/W1546539443,"The effect of expression of the Harvey-ras oncogene on phosphatidylcholine metabolism in C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblast cells was examined. There were multiple changes in the CDP-choline pathway for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in the ras-expressing cells. The activity of the first enzyme in the pathway, choline kinase, was stimulated 1.9-fold, while the activity of the second enzyme, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, was decreased by one-half. High levels of intracellular phosphocholine measured in the ras cells were consistent with the altered activities of choline kinase and cytidylyltransferase. The overall rate of phosphatidylcholine synthesis appeared to be increased because the turnover rate of phosphocholine from the intracellular pool was higher in the ras-transfected cells. There also appeared to be an increased rate of phosphatidylcholine degradation in ras-expressing C3H10T1/2 cells. Very high levels of glycerophosphocholine (6-fold increased over control cells) suggested that phospholipase A was activated in these cells. These results indicate that the ras oncogene product directly or indirectly causes an increased turnover of phosphatidylcholine in C3H10T1/2 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2146329839,"We have used a cloned fusion protein as antigen to generate an antiserum specific for the rat Na,K-ATPase beta 2 subunit. Utilizing this antiserum, we analyzed some of the structural features and tissue distribution of the beta 2 subunit. Treatment of a rat brain microsomal membrane fraction with N-glycanase F revealed that the beta 2 subunit is composed of an approximately 32 kDa core protein and at least two N-linked carbohydrate chains. The beta 2 subunit also was found to copurify with ouabain-inhibitable Na,K-ATPase activity from rat brain. Western blot analysis of rat tissue microsomes showed that beta 2 subunits were expressed in brain, pineal gland, and thymus. However, no beta 2 subunits were detected in kidney, heart, spleen, liver, mammary gland, or lung. These results suggest that the beta 2 subunit is a functional component of the rat brain Na,K-ATPase. The restricted tissue distribution of beta 2 subunits may reflect important differences in the functions of individual beta subunit isoforms."

https://openalex.org/W1499289187,"The abilities of different GTP-binding proteins to serve as phosphosubstrates for the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor/tyrosine kinase have been examined in reconstituted phospholipid vesicle systems. During the course of these studies we discovered that a low molecular mass, high affinity GTP-binding protein from bovine brain (designated as the 22-kDa protein) served as an excellent phosphosubstrate for the tyrosine-agarose-purified human placental EGF receptor. The EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of the purified 22-kDa protein occurs on tyrosine residues, with stoichiometries approaching 2 mol of 32Pi incorporated/mol of [35S]guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S)-binding sites. The EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of the brain 22-kDa protein requires its reconstitution into phospholipid vesicles. No phosphorylation of this GTP-binding protein is detected if it is simply mixed with the purified EGF receptor in detergent solution or if detergent is added back to lipid vesicles containing the EGF receptor and the 22-kDa protein. The EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of this GTP-binding protein is also markedly attenuated by guanine nucleotides, i.e. GTP, GTP gamma S, or GDP, suggesting that maximal phosphorylation occurs when the GTP-binding protein is in a guanine nucleotide-depleted state. Purified preparations of the 22-kDa phosphosubstrate do not cross-react with antibodies against the ras proteins. However, they do cross-react against two different peptide antibodies generated against specific sequences of the human platelet (and placental) GTP-binding protein originally designated Gp (Evans, T., Brown, M. L., Fraser, E. D., and Northrup, J. K. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 7052-7059) and more recently named G25K (Polakis, P. G., Synderman, R., and Evans, T. (1989) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 160, 25-32). When highly purified preparations of the human platelet Gp (G25K) protein are reconstituted with the purified EGF receptor into phospholipid vesicles, an EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of the platelet GTP-binding protein occurs with a stoichiometry approaching 2 mol of 32Pi incorporated/mol of [35S]GTP gamma S-binding sites. As is the case for the brain 22-kDa protein, the EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of the platelet GTP-binding protein is attenuated by guanine nucleotides. Overall, these results suggest that the brain 22-kDa phosphosubstrate for the EGF receptor is very similar, if not identical, to the Gp (G25K) protein. Although guanine nucleotide binding to the brain 22-kDa protein or to the platelet. GTP-binding protein inhibits phosphorylation, the phosphorylated GTP-binding proteins appear to bind [35S]GTP gamma S slightly better than their nonphosphorylated counterparts."
https://openalex.org/W1624457704,"Defining the structural and catalytic properties of the ion transport site(s) of enzyme-phosphorylating ATPases is of key importance in understanding the mechanism of ion transport by these enzymes. In the case of the H+, K(+)-ATPase, SCH 28080 (3-(cyanomethyl)-2-methyl-8-(phenylmethoxy)imidazo[1,2a]-pyridine) has been shown to act as a high affinity, extracytosolic, K(+)-competitive inhibitor of Mg2+, K(+)-ATPase activity (Wallmark, B., Briving, C., Fryklund, J., Munson, K., Jackson, R., Mendlein, J., Rabon, E., and Sachs, G. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 2077-2084). To define the nature of the SCH 28080-binding site in relation to the catalytic cycle of the enzyme, we have investigated the effects of this potential K+ transport site probe on the steady-state and partial reactions of the H+, K(+)-ATPase. In the absence of K+, SCH 28080 inhibits Mg2(+)-ATPase activity with high affinity (apparent Ki = 30 nM). Inhibition is due to K(+)-like prevention of phosphoenzyme formation. SCH 28080 has no effect on Mg2(+)-catalyzed dephosphorylation. SCH 28080, at concentrations less than 0.5 microM, increases the apparent Km for K+ for Mg2+, K(+)-ATPase activity with little effect on the maximum velocity. At higher concentrations of SCH 28080, reversal of inhibition by higher K+ concentrations is not complete, due to inhibition of ATPase activity by high K+. In contrast, SCH 28080 inhibits K(+)-stimulated dephosphorylation by competitively displacing K+ from phosphoenzyme with an extracytosolic conformation of the monovalent cation site (E2P) at low concentrations of SCH 28080 and K+. At higher concentrations, 10 microM SCH 28080 and 50 mM K+, a slowly dephosphorylating complex with both SCH 28080 and K+ bound to E2P may form which represents a small fraction of the total E2P (15-25%). Preincubation of SCH 28080 with E2P completely blocks K(+)-stimulated dephosphorylation, and K+ is unable to reverse this preincubation effect, indicating that the SCH 28080 dissociation rate is at least as slow as K(+)-independent dephosphorylation of E2P. These findings indicate that SCH 28080 inhibits K(+)-stimulated ATPase activity by competing with K+ for binding to E2P and blocking K(+)-stimulated dephosphorylation. In the absence of K+, SCH 28080 has a higher apparent affinity for E2P, but it permits K(+)-independent dephosphorylation. Since the dissociation rate of SCH 28080 from the enzyme is slow, phosphoenzyme formation is prevented by SCH 28080 remaining bound to the extracytosolic conformation of the monovalent cation site, thereby reducing the steady-state level of phosphoenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1545693482,"Rabbit thrombomodulin (TM) influences blood coagulation by serving as a cofactor for thrombin-induced protein C activation (activity a), by directly affecting the procoagulant activity of thrombin (activity b) and by accelerating the inhibition of thrombin by antithrombin III (AT III) (activity c). Although high molecular weight cationic compounds, such as poly-L-lysine and the ionophore-releasate from human platelets, only partly affected activity a in a concentration-dependent manner, activities b and c, however, were almost totally inhibited by these cationic compounds. Likewise, a heparin- and dermatan sulfate-binding peptide which represents a portion of the glycosaminoglycan-binding domain of vitronectin (VN) selectively inhibited activities b and c, indicating the presence of clustered acidic domain(s) in TM responsible for these activities. While heparinase or heparitinase did not affect rabbit TM function at all, digestion of rabbit TM with chondroitin ABC-lyase abolished activities b and c, whereas activity a remained unaffected. Modification of rabbit TM with chondroitin ABC-lyase was associated with a decrease in molecular mass of the receptor by about 10 kDa and a 2- to 3-fold decrease in affinity to thrombin as deduced from direct binding studies. These results suggest that at least two acidic thrombin binding domains are present in rabbit TM, whereby a dermatan sulfate-like glycosaminoglycan moiety constitutes the secondary binding domain for thrombin, eliciting both the direct as well as the AT III-dependent anticoagulant function of rabbit TM (activities b and c) but not protein C activation (activity a). In contrast to rabbit TM, human TM isolated from placenta only showed weak activities b and c. These differences in reactivity of TM from different sources appeared to be due to the masking (or absence) of the proposed secondary thrombin binding site in human TM, since VN could be identified as a major contamination in the human TM preparation as revealed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis. In addition, the major part of human TM could be immunoprecipitated by monospecific antibodies to VN. These findings indicate a possible modulatory function for VN in the human thrombin-TM system."
https://openalex.org/W1588124305,"Site-specific recombination by Tn3 resolvase normally occurs in vitro and in vivo only between directly repeated res sites on the same supercoiled DNA molecule. However, with multiply interlinked catenane substrates consisting of two DNA rings each containing a single res site, resolvase efficiently carried out intermolecular recombination. The topology of the knots produced by several rounds of this reaction proves that the DNA within the synaptic intermediate is coiled in an interwound (plectonemic) fashion rather than wrapped solenoidally around resolvase as in previously characterized supercoiled DNA-protein complexes. The synaptic intermediate can contain equivalently supercoil, catenane, or knot crossings as long as the res sites have a right-handed coiling and a particular relative orientation. The structure of the product knots and catenanes also shows the path the DNA takes during strand exchange. Intermolecular recombination within multiply linked catenanes required negative supercoiling, as does the standard intramolecular reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1502274943,"We examined the effect of insulin treatment on HTC cells transfected with large numbers of either normal insulin receptors (HTC-IR) or insulin receptors defective in tyrosine kinase (HTC-IR/M-1030). In both HTC-IR and HTC-IR/M-1030 cells, 20 h of insulin treatment (1 microM) at 37 degrees C resulted in a 65% decrease in the number of binding sites with a reciprocal 6-fold increase in affinity. In contrast, treatment with 10 nM insulin (20 h, 37 degrees C) also increased receptor affinity but had a smaller effect on the number of binding sites. 125I-Insulin binding to soluble receptors from HTC-IR and HTC-IR/M-1030 cells pretreated with insulin showed results similar to those obtained in intact cells. In both HTC-IR and HTC-IR/M-1030 cells, insulin enhanced insulin receptor degradation. In HTC-IR/M-1030 cells a 1-h incubation with insulin did not change receptor number and had only a small effect on receptor affinity; also there was no effect of insulin after a 20-h incubation at 15 degrees C. Inhibiting protein synthesis by pretreatment with cycloheximide (100 microM) did not block either the decrease in receptor number or the increase in receptor affinity. Both HTC-IR and HTC-IR/M-1030 cells exhibited a very slow rate of insulin and insulin receptor internalization and no differences were seen in this parameter when HTC-IR cells were compared to HTC-IR/M-1030 cells. These studies indicate, therefore, that in cells expressing kinase-defective insulin receptors, insulin down-regulates insulin receptor number via enhanced receptor degradation, and up-regulates receptor affinity. These effects were time- and temperature-dependent, but not dependent on new protein synthesis, and suggest that activation of tyrosine kinase may not be a prerequisite for certain mechanisms whereby insulin regulates its receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1541595061,"Although undifferentiated F9 teratocarcinoma cells express low levels of mRNAs for collagen IV, previous transient transfection experiments using an alpha 1(IV) collagen gene promoter-enhancer-CAT construct revealed a high level of transcriptional activity in these cells. In this report, we find that when this construct is introduced stably into undifferentiated F9 teratocarcinoma cells, expression does not occur unless the cells are treated with retinoic acid and dibutyryl-cAMP. Such activation mimics the endogenous gene activity. Treatment of the cells containing the integrated construct with 5-azacytidine, an agent which prevents DNA methylation, also activates transcription and acts synergistically with retinoic acid and cAMP. Analysis of DNA isolated from F9 teratocarcinoma cells revealed that there was a specific demethylation of the DNA within the 5'-flanking region of the collagen IV genes following treatment with retinoic acid and cAMP. These results suggest that during differentiation, DNA demethylation may play an important role in transcriptional regulation of the collagen IV genes."

https://openalex.org/W1487363849,A relatively pure and stable compound III of bovine spleen myeloperoxidase was prepared from native enzyme using the aerobic oxidation of dihydroxyfumarate to generate O2-(.). Spectral scans show well defined peaks at 450 and 625 nm and an isosbestic point between compound III and native enzyme at 440 nm. Compound III decayed to native enzyme without any detectable intermediate. The rate of decay was faster at alkaline pH values and also in the presence of superoxide dismutase. Ascorbic acid reduces compound III to native enzyme with a second order rate constant of (4.0 +/- 0.1) x 10(2) M-1 s-1. The ascorbic acid reduction of compound III has potential physiological relevance since it could help maintain the catalytic cycle of myeloperoxidase to generate the bactericidal agent hypochlorous acid.
https://openalex.org/W1546582376,"A truncated regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase I was constructed which contained deletions at both the carboxyl terminus and at the amino terminus. The entire carboxyl-terminal cAMP-binding domain was deleted as well as the first 92 residues up to the hinge region. This monomeric truncated protein still forms a complex with the catalytic subunit, and activation of this complex is mediated by cAMP. The affinity of this mutant holoenzyme for cAMP and its activation by cAMP are nearly identical to holoenzyme formed with a regulatory subunit having only the carboxyl-terminal deletion and very similar to native holoenzyme. The off rate for cAMP from both mutant regulatory subunits, however, is monophasic and very fast relative to the biphasic off rate seen for the native regulatory subunit. The effects of NaCl, urea, and pH on cAMP binding are also very similar for the mutant and native holoenzymes. Like the native type I holoenzyme, both mutant holoenzymes bind ATP with a high affinity. The positive cooperativity seen for MgATP binding to the native holoenzyme, however, is abolished in the double deletion mutant. The Hill coefficient for ATP binding to this mutant holoenzyme is 1.0 in contrast to 1.6 for the native holoenzyme. The Kd (cAMP) is increased by approximately 1 order of magnitude for both mutant forms of the holoenzyme in the presence of MgATP. A similar shift is seen for the native holoenzyme. Further characterization of the MgATP-binding properties of the wild-type holoenzyme indicates that a binary complex containing catalytic subunit and MgATP is required, in particular, for reassociation with the cAMP-bound regulatory subunit. This binary complex is required for rapid dissociation of the bound cAMP and is probably responsible for the observed reduction in cAMP-binding affinity for the type I holoenzyme in the presence of MgATP."
https://openalex.org/W1494772917,"This paper presents the first purification of the branched chain aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.42) from rat heart mitochondria. The enzyme has been purified from the 100,000 x g supernatant obtained after sonication and ultracentrifugation of rat heart mitochondria. A combination of open column chromatography, high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), and discontinuous polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis was used. The key step in the procedure was hydrophobic interaction chromatography on HPLC. The final purification step was polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis where the enzyme appeared as a doublet. When electroeluted from the gel, each of these bands had the same specific activity demonstrating that there are two forms of the purified enzyme which differ slightly in electrical charge. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, these two enzyme forms appeared as a single band with a molecular mass of 43 kDa. Size exclusion chromatography on Sephacryl S-100 identified the enzyme as a 50-kDa protein. These experiments argue against the existence of a dimeric form of this enzyme. The ratio of enzyme activity with leucine (0.84), valine (0.88), or glutamate (0.66) as amino acid substrate versus isoleucine remained constant throughout the purification procedure. Specific activity of the final preparation was 66 units/mg of enzyme protein. Polyclonal antibodies against the purified enzyme were raised in rabbits. On an immunoblot the antiserum recognized a 43-kDa protein in the 100,000 x g supernatant from a rat heart mitochondrial sonicate but did not recognize any proteins in rat brain cytosol. Quantitative immunodot assay resulted in an estimated enzyme content of about 100 micrograms of branched chain aminotransferase protein/g of heart, wet weight. Finally, 97% of the heart branched chain aminotransferase activity could be neutralized by the antiserum, but the antiserum would not neutralize aminotransferase activity in brain cytosol. These data suggest that close sequence homology does not exist between the two proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1512015902,"To define the inhibitory requirements of mammalian collagenase, several N-substituted amide and peptide derivatives of the mercaptomethyl analogue of leucine, 2-[(R,S)mercaptomethyl]-4-methylpentanoic acid (H psi[SCH2]-DL-leucine), were synthesized and tested as inhibitors of pig synovial collagenase with soluble type I collagen as substrate. H psi[SCH2]-DL-leucine (IC50 = 320 microM) was about 10 times more potent than the beta-mercaptomethyl compound, N-acetylcysteine. The amide of H psi[SCH2]-DL-leucine was six times more potent than the parent thiol acid. Aliphatic N-substituted amides were less potent than the unsubstituted amide, whereas the N-benzyl amide was slightly more potent. Dipeptides, particularly those with an aromatic group at P2', were up to 20-fold more potent, while tripeptides with an aromatic L-amino acid at P2' and Ala-NH2 at P3' were up to 2200 times more potent than H psi[SCH2]-DL-leucine. The resolved diastereomers of H psi[SCH2]-DL-Leu-Phe-Ala-NH2 inhibited by 50% at 0.3 and 0.04 microM, respectively. The most potent inhibitor synthesized, an isomer of H psi[SCH2]-DL-Leu-L-3-(2'-naphthyl)alanyl-Ala-NH2, exhibited an IC50 of 0.014 microM, a value about 300 times less than similar thiol-based analogues of the P'-cleavage sequence of type I collagen, H psi[SCH2]-DL-Leu-Ala-Gly-Gln-. These structure-function studies establish within the present series of compounds that the most effective inhibitors of mammalian collagenase are not closely related to the P2'-P3' elements of the cleavage site of the natural substrate but rather have an aromatic group at the P2' position and Ala-NH2 at the P3' position."
https://openalex.org/W1569442967,"Red blood cell-mediated microinjection was used to introduce radioiodinated ubiquitin into ts85 cells, a mouse cell line that contains a thermolabile ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1). The proportion of ubiquitin present as histone conjugates, high molecular weight conjugates, and free molecules was then determined by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. When ts85 cells were incubated at the nonpermissive temperature, 39.5 degrees C, high molecular weight conjugates accumulated. This unexpected result was confirmed by Western blot analyses. To determine whether ubiquitin conjugates formed under nonpermissive conditions or merely persisted after the temperature increase, ts85 cells were incubated at 39.5 degrees C to generate large amounts of conjugates and then shifted to 42 degrees C. The higher temperature resulted in a 25% reduction in conjugates, but upon return to 39.5 degrees C, the ubiquitin conjugates were restored to pre-42 degrees C amounts. Since all changes in ubiquitin conjugate levels occurred above 39.5 degrees C, ts85 cells can couple ubiquitin to cellular proteins even after prolonged culture at nonpermissive temperatures. Western blot analyses showed that less than 10% of the E1 molecules present in ts85 cells at 31 degrees C remained after 2 h at 39.5 degrees C. However, when 125I-ubiquitin was added to extracts from heated ts85 cells an apparent high molecular weight form of E1 and thiol ester adducts between ubiquitin and the E2 carrier proteins were detected by electrophoresis at 4 degrees C. Considering both in vivo and in vitro demonstrations that heated ts85 cells retain the ability to conjugate ubiquitin to endogenous proteins, considerable caution must be exercised in the design and interpretation of proteolysis experiments using this mutant cell line."

https://openalex.org/W1545300349,"Neuropeptide Y (NPY), a neurotransmitter contained within intrinsic nerves of the small intestine, inhibits secretion when added to the serosal side of intestinal mucosa mounted in Ussing chambers. Using NPY radiolabeled with IODO-GEN, lactoperoxidase, or the Bolton-Hunter reagent, we have localized high affinity NPY receptors to the serosal laterobasal membranes of the rat intestinal epithelial cell, isolated according to a recently described protocol that minimizes contamination with endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and brush-border membranes. In addition, certain species of radiolabeled NPY, including those labeled with IODO-GEN at the tyrosine residue 36, also demonstrated an ability to bind to brush-border membranes. These receptors were specific for NPY since the homologous peptides, pancreatic polypeptide and peptide YY, were less efficient than NPY in inhibiting the membrane binding of radiolabeled NPY. By cross-linking NPY to its receptor with either disuccinimidyl suberate or dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) and analyzing the resulting complexes on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by radioautography, we identified two NPY receptor species with molecular sizes of 52-59 kDa and 37-39 kDa. The 37-39-kDa species further possesses a disulfide bond which may attach it to a separate approximately 5-kDa subunit, as evidenced by retarded migration in the absence of the reducing agent dithiothreitol. The intestinal NPY receptor is slightly smaller than the rat brain receptor previously characterized using similar techniques. The localization of NPY receptors on laterobasal membranes is consistent with previous anatomic and physiologic findings, and their identification by cross-linking techniques will constitute the basis for detailed characterization."
https://openalex.org/W134753042,"The kinetics of sodium dodecyl sulfate-induced activation of respiratory burst oxidase (NADPH oxidase) in a fully soluble cell-free system from resting (control) or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulated human neutrophils were investigated. In a cell-free system containing solubilized membranes and cytosol fractions (cytosol) derived from control neutrophils (control cell-free system), the values of Km and Vmax for NADPH of the NADPH oxidase from control neutrophils continuously increased with increasing concentrations of cytosol, but with increasing concentrations of solubilized membranes from the control neutrophils, Km values continuously decreased, suggesting cytosolic activation factor-dependent continuous changes in the affinity of NADPH oxidase to NADPH. In a cell-free system containing solubilized membranes and cytosol prepared from PMA-stimulated neutrophils, NADPH oxidase was not activated after the addition of NADPH. However, cytosol from control neutrophils activated the NADPH oxidase of PMA-stimulated neutrophils in a cell-free system. Cytosol from PMA-stimulated neutrophils did not activate the control neutrophil oxidase, although it contained no inhibitors of NADPH oxidase activation. The results suggest that, in PMA-stimulated neutrophils, cytosolic activation factors may be consumed or exhausted with an increasing period of time after the stimulation of neutrophils, and that the affinity of PMA-stimulated neutrophil NADPH oxidase to NADPH may almost be the same as that of control neutrophil oxidase. It was concluded that the affinity of NADPH oxidase to NADPH was closely associated with interaction between solubilized membranes and cytosolic activation factors, as indicated by the concentration ratio."

Purified CF0 contains four subunits corresponding to subunits I, II, III, and IV. CF0 mediated proton translocation across the membrane after incorporation into asolectin liposomes. The CF0-mediated proton transport was inhibited by N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and the binding of chloroplast coupling factor 1 (CF1). Rebinding of CF1 to CF0 liposomes resulted in reconstitution of N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and uncoupler sensitive energy-transducing activities. Like CF0 in native thylakoid membranes, purified CF0 bound CF1 as well as CF1 deficient in either the delta or epsilon subunits."

https://openalex.org/W1572191227,"In bovine cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles, an outward H+ gradient stimulated the initial rate of amiloride-sensitive uptake of 22Na+, 42K+, or 86Rb+. Release of H+ from the vesicles was stimulated by extravesicular Na+, K+, Rb+, or Li+ but not by choline or N-methylglucamine. Uptakes of Na+ and Rb+ were half-saturated at 3 mM Na+ and 3 mM Rb+, but the maximal velocity of Na+ uptake was 1.5 times that of Rb+ uptake. Na+ uptake was inhibited by extravesicular K+, Rb+, or Li+, and Rb+ uptake was inhibited by extravesicular Na+ or Li+. Amiloride-sensitive uptake of Na+ or Rb+ increased with increase in extravesicular pH and decrease in intravesicular pH. In the absence of pH gradient, there were stimulations of Na+ uptake by intravesicular Na+ and K+ and of Rb+ uptake by intravesicular Rb+ and Na+. Similarly, there were trans stimulations of Na+ and Rb+ efflux by extravesicular alkali cations. The data suggest the existence of a nonselective antiporter catalyzing either alkali cation/H+ exchange or alkali cation/alkali cation exchange. Since increasing Na+ caused complete inhibition of Rb+/H+ exchange, but saturating K+ caused partial inhibitions of Na+/H+ exchange and Na+/Na+ exchange, the presence of a Na(+)-selective antiporter is also indicated. Although both antiporters may be involved in pH homeostasis, a role of the nonselective antiporter may be in the control of Na+/K+ exchange across the cardiac sarcolemma."

https://openalex.org/W1505383361,"The anion-linked polymerization of the tetrameric hemoglobin from Scapharca inaequivalvis has been characterized by means of sedimentation velocity experiments in terms of its dependence on the binding of other protein ligands, oxygen, and protons. The linkage with oxygen manifests itself at any given anion concentration in the markedly different sedimentation behavior of the oxygenated and deoxygenated protein; whereas the former sediments always as a single peak (congruent to 4.3 S), the latter exhibits bimodal Schlieren patterns with a fast peak that attains congruent to 10 S. A comparison of experimental and computer-simulated (Cox, D. J. (1971) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 146, 181-195) boundaries shows that the behavior of oxyhemoglobin can be represented by a rapidly reversible dimerization of the native 4.3 S molecule, whereas the behavior of the deoxygenated protein can be described adequately in terms of the polymerization of the native structure into tetramers and octamers. The interplay between the binding of protons and anions is brought out by the different dependence of polymer formation on anion concentration at different pH values. In the case of chloride, polymerization goes through a maximum at around 20-50 mM Cl- at pH 6.3 but decreases monotonically above 5 mM at pH 5.5. On the basis of these data and of the effect of other anions such as phosphate and perchlorate, a tentative picture of the high affinity anion-binding sites has been proposed. From a functional point of view, the hemoglobin polymers are characterized by a lower oxygen affinity and a higher cooperativity than the tetrameric structure; hence, polymerization results in a shift of the lower asymptote of the Hill plots while the upper asymptote is unaltered. The effect of polymerization on oxygen binding has been analyzed in terms of the polysteric linkage scheme (Colosimo, A., Brunori, M., and Wyman, J. (1974) Biophys. Chem. 2, 338-343). The data obtained at pH 6.3 as a function of chloride concentration could be fitted satisfactorily by taking the self-association behavior of the protein into account."
