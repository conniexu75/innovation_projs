Glioblastoma is the most prevalent primary malignant brain tumor in adults (Ostrom et al., 2018Ostrom Q.T. Gittleman H. Truitt G. Boscia A. Kruchko C. Barnholtz-Sloan J.S.

Despite many clinical trials (Paolillo et al., 2018Paolillo M. Boselli C. Schinelli S. Glioblastoma under Siege: An Overview of Current Therapeutic Strategies.Brain Sci. 2018; 8: E15Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the standard of care therapy for over a decade has been maximal surgical resection followed by temozolomide chemotherapy and radiation treatment, which improves the median survival duration to 14.6 months when compared to 12.1 months with surgery and radiation alone (Stupp et al., 2005Stupp R.

Inability of positive phase II clinical trials of investigational treatments to subsequently predict positive phase III clinical trials in glioblastoma.Neuro-oncol. 2018; 20: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Characterizing this heterogeneity and developing new models for timely empirical testing of personalized treatment strategies for glioblastoma remain both pre-clinical and clinical challenges. Several model systems have contributed tremendously to our current understanding of biological mechanisms underlying glioblastoma pathogenesis, but have their limitations. Traditional in vitro culture models, both monolayer and tumor sphere cultures, can require a substantial amount of time to establish and use exogenous EGF, bFGF, and/or serum to propagate tumor cells over serial passages with clonal expansion, which are not favorable to maintain various cellular subtypes and key driver gene expression of parental tumors (Ledur et al., 2017Ledur P.F.

Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, in which primary dissociated tumor cells are directly injected into mice, are thought to better retain these important features of glioblastomas (Giannini et al., 2005Giannini C. Sarkaria J.N. Saito A. Uhm J.H. Galanis E. Carlson B.L. Schroeder M.A. James C.D. Patient tumor EGFR and PDGFRA gene amplifications retained in an invasive intracranial xenograft model of glioblastoma multiforme.Neuro-oncol. 2005; 7: 164-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). However, these PDX models exhibit variable engraftment efficiency and host infiltration by tumor cells, have very limited throughput, and are subject to a long latency in tumor generation ranging from 2 to 11 months (Patrizii et al., 2018Patrizii M. Bartucci M. Pine S.R. Sabaawy H.E. Utility of Glioblastoma Patient-Derived Orthotopic Xenografts in Drug Discovery and Personalized Therapy.Front. Oncol. 2018; 8: 23Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The protracted time required to establish clonal tumor cell cultures and PDX models hinders their clinical applicability for testing personalized therapy as current treatment regimens are typically initiated 1 month following surgery, and the median survival time of patients upon diagnosis is 14.6 months. Recently, 3D organoid culture systems have been developed that capture the phenotypic and molecular heterogeneity found in various organs (Clevers, 2016Clevers H. Modeling Development and Disease with Organoids.Cell. 2016; 165: 1586-1597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar), including cerebral organoids (Kadoshima et al., 2013Kadoshima T.

In most cases, dissociated tumor cells of epithelial origin are cultured within Matrigel in the presence of exogenous growth factors to form 3D structures, and various cancer organoid biobanks have been established as valuable resources (Bleijs et al., 2019Bleijs M. van de Wetering M.

To study glioblastoma, cerebral organoids have been genetically manipulated to develop oncogenic properties (Bian et al., 2018Bian S. Repic M. Guo Z. Kavirayani A. Burkard T. Bagley J.A.

Nakayama Y. et al.Modeling Patient-Derived Glioblastoma with Cerebral Organoids..Cell Rep. 2019; 26: 3203-3211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Furthermore, patient-derived glioblastoma organoids generated with Matrigel and exogenous EGF/bFGF over several weeks have demonstrated stem cell heterogeneity and a hypoxic gradient (Hubert et al., 2016Hubert C.G. Rivera M. Spangler L.C. Wu Q. Mack S.C. Prager B.C. Couce M. McLendon R.E. Sloan A.E. Rich J.N. A Three-Dimensional Organoid Culture System Derived from Human Glioblastomas Recapitulates the Hypoxic Gradients and Cancer Stem Cell Heterogeneity of Tumors Found In Vivo.Cancer Res. 2016; 76: 2465-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The degree to which these glioblastoma organoid systems recapitulate key molecular features of patient tumors remains unclear. Here, we report a robust method to rapidly generate glioblastoma organoids (named GBOs) in a defined culture medium directly from fresh tumor specimens without single-cell dissociation. We generated a live biobank of GBOs and performed comprehensive histological, molecular, and genomic analyses to show that GBOs recapitulate inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity and retain many key features of their corresponding parental tumors. These GBOs can be efficiently xenografted into the adult mouse brain, displaying rapid and aggressive infiltration and maintaining key driver mutation expression. We further show that GBOs can be employed to test responses to standard of care therapy as well as targeted treatments, including drugs from clinical trials and chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell immunotherapy, on a clinically relevant timescale. Together, these results highlight the potential utility of our patient-derived glioblastoma organoid model and biobank for basic and translational research and for testing personalized therapies. To preserve the local cytoarchitecture and native cell-cell interactions of original tumors, and to avoid clonal selection of specific cell populations in culture, we developed a protocol to generate glioblastoma organoids (GBOs) without mechanical or enzymatic dissociation of the resected tumor tissue into single cells (Figure 1A). Furthermore, the optimized medium to establish and maintain GBOs is fully defined, serum-free, and with no added EGF/bFGF or extracellular matrix that may contribute to further selection. We obtained fresh surgically resected glioblastoma tumor tissue from patients after informed consent (Table S1). Optimal GBOs were generated from tissue along the tumor margin with minimal necrosis and little surrounding brain tissue. The resected tissue was cut into ∼1 mm diameter pieces using fine dissection scissors (Figure 1A). Debris and red blood cells were removed and tumor pieces were cultured in the GBO medium on an orbital shaker to facilitate organoid formation and increase nutrient and oxygen diffusion. Tumor pieces generally formed round organoids within 1–2 weeks (Figure 1A). GBOs were propagated by cutting them into ∼0.5 mm diameter pieces to avoid necrotic cell death in the inner core (Figure 1A). To assess whether GBOs resemble their corresponding parental tumors, we first performed histological analyses. Each GBO was independently confirmed by a neuropathologist to retain features of high-grade gliomas using H&E staining (Figure 1B). These GBOs displayed the cellular and nuclear atypia of patient tumors, often containing abundant mitotic figures and pleomorphic nuclei (Figure 1B). In particular, GBOs exhibited many characteristic cellular morphologies of their parental tumors, such as gemistocytic cells (UP-7966), multinucleated giant cells (UP-8036 and UP-7955), and cells with abundant vacuoles (UP-7884). Many GBOs also retained CD31+ vasculature (Figure 1C). GBOs allowed to grow larger developed hypoxia gradients (Figure 1D), a hallmark of glioblastomas (Hubert et al., 2016Hubert C.G. Rivera M. Spangler L.C. Wu Q. Mack S.C. Prager B.C. Couce M. McLendon R.E. Sloan A.E. Rich J.N. A Three-Dimensional Organoid Culture System Derived from Human Glioblastomas Recapitulates the Hypoxic Gradients and Cancer Stem Cell Heterogeneity of Tumors Found In Vivo.Cancer Res. 2016; 76: 2465-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Hypoxia increased substantially around 300 μm from the surface, correlating with absence of KI67+ proliferating cells (Figure 1D). To further characterize cellular identities, we performed immunohistological analyses using a panel of neurodevelopmental markers, including glial markers GFAP and S100B, immature neuronal marker DCX, and neural progenitor and glioma stem cell markers NESTIN, BLBP, HOPX, SOX2, and OLIG2. We observed robust heterogeneity in cell identity and morphology in GBOs with close resemblance to the cellular composition of corresponding parental tumors, which exhibited marked inter-tumoral heterogeneity (Figures 2A and S1A). Quantitative analysis of 8 tumor samples showed similar percentages of cells expressing SOX2 and OLIG2 between parental tumors and corresponding GBOs for up to 4 weeks in the majority of cases (Figure 2B). GBOs largely maintained the proliferation rate of corresponding parental tumors as quantified by KI67 immunostaining (Figures 2A and 2B). We observed small numbers of dying cells in non-necrotic regions for some parental tumors and derived GBOs, but not for others (Figure S1B). To examine GBO expansion, we pulsed GBOs with 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU). At 1 h after labeling, the majority of EdU+ cells were NESTIN+, S100B+, DCX+, or OLIG2+, revealing progenitor subtypes that were actively dividing in these GBOs (Figures 2C and 2D). Two weeks later, EdU-retaining cells included NESTIN+, HOPX+, DCX+, S100B+, OLIG2+, and GFAP+ cells, indicating continuous generation of diverse cell types that were typically present in parental tumors (Figures 2A and 2D). We have also monitored GBO growth by measuring the size of individual GBOs over time (Figures S2A and S2B).Figure S1GBOs and Biobanked Samples Retain Cellular Diversity of Parental Tumors as Shown by immunostaining, Related to Figure 2.Show full captionShown are sample confocal images of immunostaining for neural progenitor, glial, and glioma stem cell markers (A) and cell death marker (Cleaved-Caspase-3/CC3; B) for six additional parental tumors, corresponding GBOs and GBOs recovered from the biobank.Biobanked GBOs (cryopreserved at 4 weeks after culture) were all examined at 2 weeks after recovery.

Also see Table S1 for a summary of mutations detected in our patient cases. We have generated GBOs with high reliability from glioblastomas of 53 patient cases, including from anatomical subregions of the same tumors and from recurrent tumors (Figure S2C; Table S1). We defined successful GBO generation as microdissected tumor pieces that could survive, develop a spherical morphology, and continuously grow in culture for 2 weeks. Using these criteria, our overall success rate for generating GBOs was 91.4%, with 66.7% for IDH1 mutant tumors and 75% for recurrent tumors (Table S1). GBOs could be cultured for over 48 weeks and maintained similar expression of markers examined (Figures S2D and S2E). We also developed protocols for freezing cultured GBOs and recovering them from cryopreservation. These recovered GBOs exhibited continuous growth (Figures 2E and 2F) and similar expression of various markers to their corresponding parental tumors (Figures 2A, 2B, S1, and S2D). So far, we have established a biobank of 70 GBOs from 53 patient cases (including subregional samples) carrying a variety of genomic alterations commonly found in glioblastomas (Brennan et al., 2013Brennan C.W. Verhaak R.G. McKenna A. Campos B. Noushmehr H. Salama S.R. Zheng S. Chakravarty D. Sanborn J.Z. Berman S.H. et al.TCGA Research NetworkThe somatic genomic landscape of glioblastoma.Cell. 2013; 155: 462-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3052) Google Scholar) (Figure S2F; Table S1) and performed additional characterizations for a subset of these GBOs (Table S2). We next assessed whether GBOs also maintained gene expression signatures and genomic landscapes similar to their corresponding parental tumors. We performed transcriptome analysis by bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) across 12 patients, including 2 patients with subregional samples, for a total of 17 parental tumor samples and 64 derived GBOs in culture for 1 to 12 weeks (Table S3). Overall, transcriptome-wide comparisons of GBOs with their corresponding parental tumors demonstrated high similarity (Figures 3A and S3A). Given the large inter-tumoral heterogeneity for glioblastomas, we identified unique gene expression signatures for individual parental tumors and found that corresponding GBOs maintained these patterns of gene expression in culture over time (Figure 3B). For example, EGFR expression was maintained at high levels in UP-7788-ANT-GBOs and at low levels in UP-7790-GBOs, as shown by both RNA-seq and immunohistology (Figures S3B and S3C). Systematic comparison between parental tumors and derived GBOs showed that the major difference was downregulation of blood- and immune-related genes in GBOs (Figures S3D–S3F), likely reflecting the elimination of blood cells and a lack of immune cell expansion in GBOs over time. Few genes were upregulated in GBOs compared to parental tumors (Figures S3D and S3F).Figure S3Bulk RNA-Seq and Exome Sequencing Analyses of Parental Tumors and Corresponding GBOs, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Scatterplots comparing gene expression in UP-7788-PMS parental tumor and corresponding GBOs at 1, 2, 4, and 12 weeks in culture.(B-C) Expression of EGFR in UP-7788-ANT and UP-7790 parental tumors and corresponding GBOs shown by RNA-seq (B) and immunohistology (C; Scale bar, 50 μm).(D-F) Differential expression between parental tumors and derived GBOs.

https://openalex.org/W2997765786,"KCNQ1, also known as Kv7.1, is a voltage-dependent K+ channel that regulates gastric acid secretion, salt and glucose homeostasis, and heart rhythm. Its functional properties are regulated in a tissue-specific manner through co-assembly with beta subunits KCNE1-5. In non-excitable cells, KCNQ1 forms a complex with KCNE3, which suppresses channel closure at negative membrane voltages that otherwise would close it. Pore opening is regulated by the signaling lipid PIP2. Using cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), we show that KCNE3 tucks its single-membrane-spanning helix against KCNQ1, at a location that appears to lock the voltage sensor in its depolarized conformation. Without PIP2, the pore remains closed. Upon addition, PIP2 occupies a site on KCNQ1 within the inner membrane leaflet, which triggers a large conformational change that leads to dilation of the pore's gate. It is likely that this mechanism of PIP2 activation is conserved among Kv7 channels."
https://openalex.org/W2997832844,"Autophagy is a conserved catabolic homeostasis process central for cellular and organismal health. During autophagy, small single-membrane phagophores rapidly expand into large double-membrane autophagosomes to encapsulate diverse cargoes for degradation. It is thought that autophagic membranes are mainly derived from preformed organelle membranes. Instead, here we delineate a pathway that expands the phagophore membrane by localized phospholipid synthesis. Specifically, we find that the conserved acyl-CoA synthetase Faa1 accumulates on nucleated phagophores and locally activates fatty acids (FAs) required for phagophore elongation and autophagy. Strikingly, using isotopic FA tracing, we directly show that Faa1 channels activated FAs into the synthesis of phospholipids and promotes their assembly into autophagic membranes. Indeed, the first committed steps of de novo phospholipid synthesis at the ER, which forms stable contacts with nascent autophagosomes, are essential for autophagy. Together, our work illuminates how cells spatially tune synthesis and flux of phospholipids for autophagosome biogenesis during autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2996859213,"The propagation of electrical impulses along axons is highly accelerated by the myelin sheath and produces saltating or ""jumping"" action potentials across internodes, from one node of Ranvier to the next. The underlying electrical circuit, as well as the existence and role of submyelin conduction in saltatory conduction remain, however, elusive. Here, we made patch-clamp and high-speed voltage-calibrated optical recordings of potentials across the nodal and internodal axolemma of myelinated neocortical pyramidal axons combined with electron microscopy and experimentally constrained cable modeling. Our results reveal a nanoscale yet conductive periaxonal space, incompletely sealed at the paranodes, which separates the potentials across the low-capacitance myelin sheath and internodal axolemma. The emerging double-cable model reproduces the recorded evolution of voltage waveforms across nodes and internodes, including rapid nodal potentials traveling in advance of attenuated waves in the internodal axolemma, revealing a mechanism for saltation across time and space."
https://openalex.org/W2998055946,"Rapid regeneration of smooth muscle after vascular injury is essential for maintaining arterial function. The existence and putative roles of resident vascular stem cells (VSCs) in artery repair are controversial, and vessel regeneration is thought to be mediated by proliferative expansion of pre-existing smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Here, we performed cell fate mapping and single-cell RNA sequencing to identify Sca1+ VSCs in the adventitial layer of artery walls. After severe injury, Sca1+ VSCs migrate into the medial layer and generate de novo SMCs, which subsequently expand more efficiently compared with pre-existing smooth muscle. Genetic lineage tracing using dual recombinases distinguished a Sca1+PDGFRa+ VSC subpopulation that generates SMCs, and genetic ablation of Sca1+ VSCs or specific knockout of Yap1 in Sca1+ VSCs significantly impaired artery repair. These findings provide genetic evidence of a bona fide Sca1+ VSC population that produces SMCs and delineates their critical role in vessel repair."
https://openalex.org/W2997217931,"The human-specific gene ARHGAP11B is preferentially expressed in neural progenitors of fetal human neocortex and increases abundance and proliferation of basal progenitors (BPs), which have a key role in neocortex expansion. ARHGAP11B has therefore been implicated in the evolutionary expansion of the human neocortex, but its mode of action has been unknown. Here, we show that ARHGAP11B is imported into mitochondria, where it interacts with the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) and inhibits the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). BP expansion by ARHGAP11B requires its presence in mitochondria, and pharmacological inhibition of ANT function or mPTP opening mimic BP expansion by ARHGAP11B. Searching for the underlying metabolic basis, we find that BP expansion by ARHGAP11B requires glutaminolysis, the conversion of glutamine to glutamate for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Hence, an ARHGAP11B-induced, mitochondria-based effect on BP metabolism that is a hallmark of highly mitotically active cells appears to underlie its role in neocortex expansion."

On Gram-negative bacteria, S-layers are anchored to cells via lipopolysaccharide. Here, we report an electron cryomicroscopy structure of the Caulobacter crescentus S-layer bound to the O-antigen of lipopolysaccharide. Using native mass spectrometry and molecular dynamics simulations, we deduce the length of the O-antigen on cells and show how lipopolysaccharide binding and S-layer assembly is regulated by calcium. Finally, we present a near-atomic resolution in situ structure of the complete S-layer using cellular electron cryotomography, showing S-layer arrangement at the tip of the O-antigen. A complete atomic structure of the S-layer shows the power of cellular tomography for in situ structural biology and sheds light on a very abundant class of self-assembling molecules with important roles in prokaryotic physiology with marked potential for synthetic biology and surface-display applications."
https://openalex.org/W2997266051,"Summary The remarkable regenerative capacity of the endometrium (the inner lining of the uterus) is essential for the sustenance of mammalian life. Over the years, the role of stem cells in endometrial functions and their pathologies has been suggested; however, the identity and location of such stem cells remain unclear. Here, we used in vivo lineage tracing to show that endometrial epithelium self-renews during development, growth, and regeneration and identified Axin2, a classical Wnt reporter gene, as a marker of long-lived bipotent epithelial progenitors that reside in endometrial glands. Axin2-expressing cells are responsible for epithelial regeneration in vivo and for endometrial organoid development in vitro. Ablation of Axin2+ cells severely impairs endometrial homeostasis and compromises its regeneration. More important, upon oncogenic transformation, these cells can lead to endometrial cancer. These findings provide valuable insights into the cellular basis of endometrial functions and diseases."

Eukaryotic genomes direct a plethora of gene expression programs crucial for cell differentiation and development (Yadav et al., 2018Yadav T. Quivy J.P. Almouzni G.

Typically, heterochromatin is enriched within the perinuclear zone, whereas euchromatin is distributed in the nuclear interior (Akhtar and Gasser, 2007Akhtar A. Gasser S.M.

Peripheral localization of chromatin is also subject to developmental control and becomes more critical for maintaining lineage-specific expression patterns in differentiated cells (Peric-Hupkes et al., 2010Peric-Hupkes D.

Heterochromatin domains are hypoacetylated and bear the hallmark histone H3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me) established by methyltransferases such as Clr4SUV39H. H3K9me creates binding sites for HP1 proteins (Bannister et al., 2001Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Partridge J.F. Miska E.A. Thomas J.O. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T.

Jia S. Heterochromatin revisited.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). Core components of heterochromatin also connect with the nuclear periphery. In mammals, HP1 proteins and modified histones are implicated in tethering heterochromatin to the nuclear lamina (Akhtar and Gasser, 2007Akhtar A. Gasser S.M. The nuclear envelope and transcriptional control.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 507-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, van Steensel and Belmont, 2017van Steensel B. Belmont A.S.

In C. elegans, the chromodomain protein CEC-4 directly mediates tethering to H3K9me (Gonzalez-Sandoval et al., 2015Gonzalez-Sandoval A. Towbin B.D. Kalck V. Cabianca D.S. Gaidatzis D. Hauer M.H. Geng L. Wang L. Yang T.

Despite these advances, it remains unclear how the perinuclear environment contributes to heterochromatic repression. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, heterochromatin coats the silent mating-type (mat) region, pericentromeric dg and dh repeats and telomeric regions, and discrete facultative heterochromatin islands (Cam et al., 2005Cam H.P. Sugiyama T. Chen E.S. Chen X. FitzGerald P.C. Grewal S.I. Comprehensive analysis of heterochromatin- and RNAi-mediated epigenetic control of the fission yeast genome.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). How heterochromatin is assembled and maintained is arguably best studied at the mat locus. H3K9me and HP1 proteins are enriched at the ∼20 kb domain encompassing the silent mat2 and mat3 loci (Noma et al., 2001Noma K. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I. Transitions in distinct histone H3 methylation patterns at the heterochromatin domain boundaries.Science. 2001; 293: 1150-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) (Figure S1A). Nucleation of heterochromatin occurs at the cenH element that bears homology to centromeric repeats (Hall et al., 2002Hall I.M. Shankaranarayana G.D. Noma K. Ayoub N. Cohen A. Grewal S.I. Establishment and maintenance of a heterochromatin domain.Science. 2002; 297: 2232-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). RNAi machinery, which processes cenH transcripts into siRNAs, targets Clr4 to methylate H3K9 (Bayne et al., 2010Bayne E.H. White S.A. Kagansky A. Bijos D.A. Sanchez-Pulido L. Hoe K.L. Kim D.U.

Clr4 can uniquely catalyze H3K9 methylation (“write”) and also bind to H3K9me via its chromodomain (“read”) to promote heterochromatin spreading across the entire silent domain (Al-Sady et al., 2013Al-Sady B. Madhani H.D. Narlikar G.J. Division of labor between the chromodomains of HP1 and Suv39 methylase enables coordination of heterochromatin spread.Mol.

The boundaries of the heterochromatin domain at the mat locus are demarcated by inverted repeat elements IR-L and IR-R, which contain high-affinity binding sites for the transcription factor TFIIIC (Noma et al., 2006Noma K.

Similarly, the borders of pericentromeric heterochromatin domains often coincide with tRNAs that are also bound by TFIIIC (Noma et al., 2006Noma K. Cam H.P. Maraia R.J. Grewal S.I.

Remarkably, heterochromatin can be epigenetically inherited in a self-templated manner (Grewal and Klar, 1996Grewal S.I. Klar A.J. Chromosomal inheritance of epigenetic states in fission yeast during mitosis and meiosis.Cell. 1996; 86: 95-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, Hall et al., 2002Hall I.M.

The inherent property of heterochromatin to suppress turnover of histones is believed to preserve parental H3K9 methylated histones (Aygün et al., 2013Aygün O. Mehta S. Grewal S.I.

Cell. 2017; 66: 50-62 e56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which serve as an epigenetic template for the recruitment of Clr4 via its chromodomain to maintain heterochromatin (Zhang et al., 2008Zhang K.

Biol. 2008; 15: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Indeed, in cells lacking the cenH nucleation site at the mat locus, the suppression of histone turnover and dual “read-write” activity of Clr4 are crucial for the stable propagation of heterochromatin in cis (Taneja et al., 2017Taneja N. Zofall M. Balachandran V. Thillainadesan G. Sugiyama T. Wheeler D. Zhou M. Grewal S.I.

Roles of the Clr4 methyltransferase complex in nucleation, spreading and maintenance of heterochromatin.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The fundamental features of the epigenetic inheritance mechanism described at the mat locus can be recapitulated using an artificial system at an ectopic site (Audergon et al., 2015Audergon P.N. Catania S. Kagansky A. Tong P. Shukla M. Pidoux A.L. Allshire R.C. Epigenetics. Restricted epigenetic inheritance of H3K9 methylation.Science. 2015; 348: 132-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, Ragunathan et al., 2015Ragunathan K. Jih G. Moazed D. Epigenetics. Epigenetic inheritance uncoupled from sequence-specific recruitment.Science. 2015; 348: 1258699Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our previous work identified the HP1 family protein Swi6 as a dosage critical factor essential for epigenetic maintenance of heterochromatin (Nakayama et al., 2000Nakayama J. Klar A.J. Grewal S.I. A chromodomain protein, Swi6, performs imprinting functions in fission yeast during mitosis and meiosis.Cell. 2000; 101: 307-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, the precise contribution of this conserved protein is not known. To gain further insight into epigenetic inheritance mechanisms, we screened for factors that affect the propagation of heterochromatin at the silent mat region. This led to identification of the nuclear rim protein Amo1, which shares homology to mammalian NUPL2. In addition to the heterochromatic mat locus, Amo1 is also critical for perinuclear sequestration and sequence-independent epigenetic inheritance of an artificially induced ectopic heterochromatin domain. To fulfill this role, Amo1 associates with the Rix1PELP1-containing protein complex RIXC and the histone chaperone FACT. RIXC localized across heterochromatin domains anchors these loci to the Amo1-enriched perinuclear subdomain, which facilitates loading of FACT that is required for epigenetic maintenance of heterochromatin. Investigations of gene silencing at the mat region in S. pombe have elucidated conserved pathways involved in the nucleation, spreading, and propagation of heterochromatin. To search for additional factors affecting heterochromatin assembly, we leveraged the observation that deletion of a cis-acting silencer (termed REII) adjacent to mat2P enables heterochromatin defects to be easily detected (Thon et al., 1994Thon G. Cohen A. Klar A.J. Three additional linkage groups that repress transcription and meiotic recombination in the mating-type region of Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Genetics. 1994; 138: 29-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), allowing us to develop a highly sensitized reporter system. Silencing of mat2P is enforced by two distinct mechanisms, repressive heterochromatin that coats the silent mat interval and the recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs) by REII (Cam et al., 2008Cam H.P. Noma K. Ebina H. Levin H.L. Grewal S.I. Host genome surveillance for retrotransposons by transposon-derived proteins.Nature. 2008; 451: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, Noma et al., 2001Noma K. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I. Transitions in distinct histone H3 methylation patterns at the heterochromatin domain boundaries.Science. 2001; 293: 1150-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Thus, cells lacking REII are entirely dependent upon heterochromatin for silencing mat2P. In non-switchable mat1-M (mat1-Msmt0) cells, impaired silencing of mat2P is indicated by “haploid meiosis,” an aberrant sporulation phenotype resulting from coexpression of M and P mating-type information in haploid cells (Thon et al., 1994Thon G. Cohen A. Klar A.J. Three additional linkage groups that repress transcription and meiotic recombination in the mating-type region of Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Genetics. 1994; 138: 29-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Iodine stains the starch-like compound produced by meiotic cells a dark color, whereas wild-type (WT) colonies appear yellow. The ura4+ reporter inserted near mat2P (mat2P::ura4+) provides an additional readout for heterochromatic silencing. Importantly, this sensitive reporter can detect the variegated expression phenotype resulting from defects in the stable propagation of heterochromatin (Taneja et al., 2017Taneja N. Zofall M. Balachandran V. Thillainadesan G. Sugiyama T. Wheeler D. Zhou M. Grewal S.I. SNF2 family protein Fft3 suppresses nucleosome turnover to promote epigenetic inheritance and proper replication.Mol. Cell. 2017; 66: 50-62 e56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The reporter strain was crossed with the S. pombe gene deletion library followed by detection of haploid meiosis using iodine vapor (Figure 1A) (see STAR Methods). These analyses identified known heterochromatin factors and the cohesin-associated protein Pds5 (Folco et al., 2019Folco H.D. McCue A. Balachandran V. Grewal S.I.S. Cohesin impedes heterochromatin assembly in fission yeast cells lacking Pds5.Genetics. 2019; 213: 127-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). However, we also manually crossed 240 slow-growing deletion strains in a follow-up screen. This screen identified Amo1 (a nuclear rim protein) (Pardo and Nurse, 2005Pardo M. Nurse P. The nuclear rim protein Amo1 is required for proper microtubule cytoskeleton organisation in fission yeast.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1705-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), Apl5 (a predicted subunit of AP3 adaptor complex), and Shd1 (a predicted cytoskeletal protein) (Figure S1B). Loss of Apl5 or Shd1 showed a weak silencing defect, whereas loss of Amo1 showed significant haploid meiosis and mat2P::ura4+ de-repression (Figures 1A, 1B, S1B, and S1C) that was confirmed by real-time qPCR (Figure 1C). These results implicate Amo1 in heterochromatin silencing at the mat region. Loss of Amo1 produced a weaker silencing phenotype compared to loss of the core heterochromatin assembly factor Clr4 (Figures 1A–1C). Notably, amo1Δ displayed a variegated expression pattern that contrasted with the uniform de-repression of mat2P and the ura4+ reporter in clr4Δ. Cells lacking Amo1 yielded a mixture of highly stained (dark brown) to unstained (yellow) colonies and also showed variegated mat2P::ura4+ expression as indicated by growth on medium lacking uracil (-Ura) and counter-selective medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (FOA) (Figures 1B and S1D). Variegated expression is observed in mutants defective in clonal propagation of heterochromatin during cell division (Taneja et al., 2017Taneja N. Zofall M. Balachandran V. Thillainadesan G. Sugiyama T. Wheeler D. Zhou M. Grewal S.I. SNF2 family protein Fft3 suppresses nucleosome turnover to promote epigenetic inheritance and proper replication.Mol.

The conserved Amo1 protein has homologs in higher eukaryotic species, including mammals (Figure 1D). However, no apparent ortholog of Amo1 exists in S. cerevisiae. The domain architecture comprising the CCCH-ZnF zinc finger domain and nucleoporin (Nup)-like Phe-Gly (FG) repeats present in human NUPL2 (also known as NUP42/hCG1) and its homologs is conserved in S. pombe Amo1 (Figure 1D). Amo1 may be a component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) (Asakawa et al., 2014Asakawa H. Yang H.J. Yamamoto T.G. Ohtsuki C. Chikashige Y. Sakata-Sogawa K. Tokunaga M. Iwamoto M. Hiraoka Y. Haraguchi T. Characterization of nuclear pore complex components in fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Nucleus. 2014; 5: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but it has also been found to be distinct from that of the NPC (Pardo and Nurse, 2005Pardo M. Nurse P. The nuclear rim protein Amo1 is required for proper microtubule cytoskeleton organisation in fission yeast.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1705-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To address whether Amo1 acts as a part of the NPC to affect heterochromatic silencing, we examined Amo1 localization relative to the NPC scaffold protein (Nup40NUP53) and to peripheral nuclear basket Nups (Nup124NUP153 and Nup189NUP98) by live-cell microscopy of endogenously tagged proteins. Although Amo1 localized to the nuclear periphery on the same circumference, it only partially overlapped with Nups (Figure 1E). Indeed, super-resolution fluorescence microscopy revealed Amo1 puncta that were distinct from NPC dots (Figure 1F), confirming two Amo1 pools at the nuclear rim. Individual deletions of four different NPC subunits, including those implicated in the organization of chromatin and gene regulation (Chen and Gartenberg, 2014Chen M. Gartenberg M.R.

We also considered that Amo1 might collaborate with other factors, including nuclear membrane proteins Lem2, Man1, and Bqt4 (Barrales et al., 2016Barrales R.R. Forn M. Georgescu P.R. Sarkadi Z. Braun S. Control of heterochromatin localization and silencing by the nuclear membrane protein Lem2.Genes Dev. 2016; 30: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, Ebrahimi et al., 2018Ebrahimi H.

Saito A. Sazer S. Fission yeast Lem2 and Man1 perform fundamental functions of the animal cell nuclear lamina.Nucleus. 2012; 3: 60-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, unlike amo1Δ, loss of Lem2, Man1, or Bqt4 caused only a minor or no increase in haploid meiosis and mat2P::ura4+ de-repression (Figure S1E). Thus, the nuclear rim protein Amo1 is uniquely required to enforce heterochromatic silencing at the mat locus. To further probe the role of Amo1, we performed mass spectrometry analysis of immuno-affinity-purified Amo1-GFP. This identified a number of proteins, including several Nups, consistent with our colocalization results (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2A; Table S1). The Nup-associated mRNA export factors Gle1 and Rae1 also copurified with Amo1, as in higher eukaryotes (Kendirgi et al., 2005Kendirgi F. Rexer D.J. Alcázar-Román A.R. Onishko H.M. Wente S.R.

https://openalex.org/W2997329361,"Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is an inhibitory receptor on T lymphocytes that is critical for modulating adaptive immunity. As such, it has been successfully exploited for cancer immunotherapy. Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and PD-L2 are ligands for PD-1; the former is ubiquitously expressed in inflamed tissues, whereas the latter is restricted to antigen-presenting cells. PD-L2 binds to PD-1 with 3-fold stronger affinity compared with PD-L1. To date, this affinity discrepancy has been attributed to a tryptophan (W110PD-L2) that is unique to PD-L2 and has been assumed to fit snuggly into a pocket on the PD-1 surface. Contrary to this model, using surface plasmon resonance to monitor real-time binding of recombinantly-expressed and -purified proteins, we found that W110PD-L2 acts as an elbow that helps shorten PD-L2 engagement with PD-1 and therefore lower affinity. Furthermore, we identified a latch between the C and D β-strands of the binding face as the source of the PD-L2 affinity advantage. We show that the 3-fold affinity advantage of PD-L2 is the consequence of these two opposing features, the W110PD-L2 elbow and a C-D region latch. Interestingly, using phylogenetic analysis, we found that these features evolved simultaneously upon the emergence of placental mammals, suggesting that PD-L2-affinity tuning was part of the alterations to the adaptive immune system required for placental gestation."

However, it has not been possible to precisely determine the interaction between neuronal activity patterns and transcription factor activity. Here we present a technique using two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging (2pFLIM) with new FRET biosensors to chronically image in vivo signaling of CREB, an activity-dependent transcription factor important for synaptic plasticity, at single-cell resolution. Simultaneous imaging of the red-shifted CREB sensor and GCaMP permitted exploration of how experience shapes the interplay between CREB and neuronal activity in the neocortex of awake mice. Dark rearing increased the sensitivity of CREB activity to Ca2+ elevations and prolonged the duration of CREB activation to more than 24 h in the visual cortex. This technique will allow researchers to unravel the transcriptional dynamics underlying experience-dependent plasticity in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2997844998,"Morphological convergence is an intensely studied macroevolutionary phenomenon. It refers to the morphological resemblance between phylogenetically distant taxa. Currently available methods to explore evolutionary convergence either: rely on the analysis of the phenotypic resemblance between sister clades as compared to their ancestor, fit different evolutionary regimes to different parts of the tree to see whether the same regime explains phenotypic evolution in phylogenetically distant clades, or assess deviations from the congruence between phylogenetic and phenotypic distances. We introduce a new test for morphological convergence working directly with non-ultrametric (i.e. paleontological) as well as ultrametric phylogenies and multivariate data. The method (developed as the function search.conv within the R package RRphylo) tests whether unrelated clades are morphologically more similar to each other than expected by their phylogenetic distance. It additionally permits using known phenotypes as the most recent common ancestors of clades, taking full advantage of fossil information. We assessed the power of search.conv and the incidence of false positives by means of simulations, and then applied it to three well-known and long-discussed cases of (purported) morphological convergence: the evolution of grazing adaptation in the mandible of ungulates with high-crowned molars, the evolution of mandibular shape in sabertooth cats, and the evolution of discrete ecomorphs among anoles of Caribbean islands. The search.conv method was found to be powerful, correctly identifying simulated cases of convergent morphological evolution in 95% of the cases. Type I error rate is as low as 4–6%. We found search.conv is some three orders of magnitude faster than a competing method for testing convergence."
https://openalex.org/W2996915373,"Traffic-light labelling (TLL) is a promising front-of-pack system to help consumers make informed dietary choices. It has been shown that adopting TLL in Canada, through an optimistic scenario of avoiding, if possible, foods with red traffic lights, could effectively reduce Canadians' intakes of energy, total fat, saturated fat, and sodium by 5%, 13%, 14% and 6%, respectively. However, the potential health impact of adopting TLL has not been determined in the North American context.This study modelled the potential impact of adopting TLL on mortality from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in Canada, due to the previously predicted improved nutrient intakes.Investigators used data from adults (n = 19,915) in the 2004 nationally representative Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS)-Cycle 2.2. Nutrient amounts in foods consumed by CCHS respondents were profiled using the 2013 United Kingdom's TLL criteria. Whenever possible, foods assigned at least one red light (non-compliant foods) were replaced with similar, but compliant, foods identified from a Canadian brand-specific food database. Respondents' nutrient intakes were calculated under the original CCHS scenario and the counterfactual TLL scenario, and entered in the Preventable Risk Integrated ModEl (PRIME) to estimate the health impact of adopting TLL. The primary outcome was the number of deaths attributable to diet-related NCDs that could be averted or delayed based on the TLL scenario compared with the baseline scenario.PRIME estimated that 11,715 deaths (95% CI 10,500-12,865) per year due to diet-related NCDs, among which 72% are specifically related to cardiovascular diseases, could be prevented if Canadians avoided foods labelled with red traffic lights. The reduction in energy intakes would by itself save 10,490 deaths (9,312-11,592; 90%).This study, although depicting an idealistic scenario, suggests that TLL (if used to avoid red lights when possible) could be an effective population-wide intervention to improve NCD outcomes in Canada."
https://openalex.org/W2996883588,"Background The objective of the present study was to compare the effects of a traditional resistance training program (fixed exercises and repetition ranges) to a resistance training program where exercises and repetition ranges were randomized on a session-by-session basis on markers of muscular adaptations and intrinsic motivation. Methods Twenty-one resistance trained men were randomized to perform an 8-week resistance training program using either a fixed exercise selection (CON) or having exercises randomly varied each session via a computerized app. Both groups performed 3 sets of 6 exercises, with training carried out 4 times per week. Results Both conditions promoted large, statistically significant increases in the bench press and back-squat 1 repetition maximum without differences between groups. Muscle thickness (MT) measures for the individual quadriceps showed large, statistically significant increases in of the vastus lateralis and rectus femoris for both conditions, with no observed between-group differences. Although no between-group in MT were noted for the vastus intermedius, only the CON displayed significant increases from baseline. Participants in EXP showed a significant, moderate improvement in the intrinsic motivation to training, while participants in the CON group presented non-significant decreases in this variable. Conclusions Varying exercise selection had a positive effect on enhancing motivation to train in resistance-trained men, while eliciting similar improvements in muscular adaptations."
https://openalex.org/W2998365363,"Background Evidence points to a clear link between air pollution exposure and several chronic diseases though investigations regarding arthritis are still lacking. Emerging evidence suggests an association between ambient air pollution and rheumatoid arthritis. Household air pollution exposure, conversely, is largely unstudied but may be an important consideration for arthritis, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where cooking and heating activities can generate high indoor air pollutant levels. Methods We investigated the association of household air pollution (electricity vs. gas; kerosene/paraffin; coal/charcoal; wood; or agriculture/crop/animal dung/shrubs/grass as the main fuel used for cooking) and arthritis in six LMICs (China, Ghana, India, Mexico, the Russian Federation, South Africa) using data from Wave I of the World Health Organization Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health (SAGE) (2007–2010). Multivariable analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic, household and lifestyle characteristics and several comorbidities. Results The use of gas (aOR = 1.76, 95%CI: 1.40–2.21); coal (aOR = 1.74, 95%CI: 1.22–2.47); wood (aOR = 1.69, 95%CI: 1.30–2.19); or agriculture/crop/animal dung/shrubs/grass: aOR = 1.95 (1.46–2.61) fuels for cooking were strongly associated with an increased odds of arthritis, compared to electricity in cluster and stratified adjusted analyses. Gender (female), age (≥50 years), overweight (25.0 ≤BMI<30.0 kg/m2), obesity (BMI ≥30.0 kg/m2), former and current alcohol consumption, and the comorbidities angina pectoris, diabetes, chronic lung disease, depression and hypertension were also associated with a higher odds of arthritis. Underweight (BMI<18.5 kg/m2) and higher education levels (college/university completed/post-graduate studies) were associated with a lower odds of arthritis. Conclusions These findings suggest that exposure to household air pollution from cook fuels is associated with an increased odds of arthritis in these regions, which warrants further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2997239061,"Platinum-based therapeutics are used to manage many forms of cancer, but frequently result in peripheral neuropathy. Currently, the only option available to attenuate chemotherapy-induced neuropathy is to limit or discontinue this treatment. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a lipid-based signaling molecule involved in neuroinflammatory processes by interacting with its five cognate receptors: S1P 1–5 . In this study, using a combination of drug pharmacodynamic analysis in human study participants, disease modeling in rodents, and cell-based assays, we examined whether S1P signaling may represent a potential target in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced neuropathy. To this end, we first investigated the effects of platinum-based drugs on plasma S1P levels in human cancer patients. Our analysis revealed that oxaliplatin treatment specifically increases one S1P species, d16:1 S1P, in these patients. Although d16:1 S1P is an S1P 2 agonist, it has lower potency than the most abundant S1P species (d18:1 S1P). Therefore, as d16:1 S1P concentration increases, it is likely to disproportionately activate proinflammatory S1P 1 signaling, shifting the balance away from S1P 2 . We further show that a selective S1P 2 agonist, CYM-5478, reduces allodynia in a rat model of cisplatin-induced neuropathy and attenuates the associated inflammatory processes in the dorsal root ganglia, likely by activating stress-response proteins, including ATF3 and HO-1. Cumulatively, the findings of our study suggest that the development of a specific S1P 2 agonist may represent a promising therapeutic approach for the management of chemotherapy-induced neuropathy."
https://openalex.org/W2998466942,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ion channel protein that is defective in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). To advance the rational design of CF therapies, it is important to elucidate how mutational defects in CFTR lead to its impairment and how pharmacological compounds interact with and alter CFTR. Here, using a helical-hairpin construct derived from CFTR's transmembrane (TM) helices 3 and 4 (TM3/4) and their intervening loop, we investigated the structural effects of a patient-derived CF-phenotypic mutation, E217G, located in the loop region of CFTR's membrane-spanning domain. Employing a single-molecule FRET assay to probe the folding status of reconstituted hairpins in lipid bilayers, we found that the E217G hairpin exhibits an altered adaptive packing behavior stemming from an additional GXXXG helix–helix interaction motif created in the mutant hairpin. This observation suggested that the misfolding and functional defects caused by the E217G mutation arise from an impaired conformational adaptability of TM helical segments in CFTR. The addition of the small-molecule corrector Lumacaftor exerts a helix stabilization effect not only on the E217G mutant hairpin, but also on WT TM3/4 and other mutations in the hairpin. This finding suggests a general mode of action for Lumacaftor through which this corrector efficiently improves maturation of various CFTR mutants."

However, the mechanism underlying CYP2E1 transcriptional regulation has not been clarified. This study focused on the NF-κB-mediated transcriptional regulation of rat CYP2E1 by two independent signaling pathways in alcohol-induced and immune-mediated liver injury rat models. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used in pharmacokinetic, molecular pharmacology, and morphology experiments. A rat model of alcohol-induced liver injury (AL) was established by feeding an ethanol-containing diet (42 g/kg/day) for 5 weeks as indicated. A rat immune-mediated liver injury (IM) model was established by the sequential injection of bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG, 125 mg/kg, once) via the tail vein after test day 21 and 10 μg/kg LPS 13 days later. HPLC, real-time PCR, western blot and ELISA analyses were performed. CYP2E1 expression was enhanced during the process of alcohol-induced liver injury (increased by 56%, P < 0.05) and significantly reduced during that of immune-mediated liver injury (reducedby52%, P < 0.05). NF-κB was activated in both the AL and IM groups (increased by 56% and76%, respectively, P < 0.05). Compared to those in the livers of AL model rats, the interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and iNOS levels in IM model rat livers were increased (increased by 26%, 21% and 101%, respectively, P < 0.05). The differential changes in CYP2E1 in the processes of alcohol-induced and immune-mediated liver injury may result from the differential expression of inflammatory cytokines and iNOS after NF-κB activation, leading to the NF-κB-mediated transcriptional regulation of rat CYP2E1 by two independent signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2997976644,"MicroRNA 199 (miR-199) negatively impacts pancreatic β-cell function and its expression is highly increased in islets from diabetic mice as well as in plasma of diabetic patients. Here we investigated how miR-199 expression is regulated in β-cells by assessing expression of miR-199 precursors (primiR-199a1, primiR-199a2, and primiR-199b) and mature miR-199 (miR-199-3p and miR-199-5p) and promoter transcriptional activity assays in mouse islets and mouse insulinoma cells (MIN6) under different stimuli. We found that mouse islets equally express miR-199-3p and miR-199-5p. However, the primiRNA expression levels differed; although primiR-199a1 expression was about 30% greater than that of primiR-199a2, primiR-199b is barely detected in islets. We observed a 2-fold increase in primiR-199a1 and primiR-199a2 mRNA levels in mouse islets cultured in 10 mm glucose compared with 5.5 mm glucose. Similar responses to glucose were observed in MIN6 cells. Exposure to 30 mm KCl to induce membrane depolarization and calcium influx increased expression of primiR-199a2 but not of primiR-199a1 in MIN6 cells, indicating that calcium influx was involved. Transcriptional activity studies in MIN6 cells also revealed that primiR-199a2 promoter activity was enhanced by glucose and reduced by 2-deoxy-D-glucose-induced starvation. KCl and the potassium channel blocker tolbutamide also stimulated primiR-199a2 promoter activity. Calcium channel blockade by nifedipine reduced primiR-199a2 promoter activity in MIN6 cells, and diazoxide-mediated calcium influx inhibition blunted glucose up-regulation of miR-199-3p in islets. In conclusion, we uncover that glucose acutely up-regulates miR-199 family expression in β-cells. Glucose metabolism and calcium influx are involved in primiR-199a2 expression but not primiR-199a1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2998466113,"The natural resistance-associated macrophage protein (Nramp) family encompasses transition metal and proton cotransporters that are present in many organisms from bacteria to humans. Recent structures of Deinococcus radiodurans Nramp (DraNramp) in multiple conformations revealed the intramolecular rearrangements required for alternating access of the metal-binding site to the external or cytosolic environment. Here, using recombinant proteins and metal transport and cysteine accessibility assays, we demonstrate that two parallel cytoplasm-accessible networks of conserved hydrophilic residues in DraNramp, one lining the wide intracellular vestibule for metal release and the other forming a narrow proton transport pathway, are essential for metal transport. We further show that mutagenic or posttranslational modifications of transmembrane helix (TM) 6b, which structurally links these two pathways, impede normal conformational cycling and metal transport. TM6b contains two highly conserved histidines, His 232 and His 237 . We found that different mutagenic perturbations of His 232 , just below the metal-binding site along the proton exit route, differentially affect DraNramp's conformational state, suggesting that His 232 serves as a pivot point for conformational changes. In contrast, any replacement of His 237 , lining the metal exit route, locked the transporter in a transport-inactive outward-closed state. We conclude that these two histidines, and TM6b more broadly, help trigger the bulk rearrangement of DraNramp to the inward-open state upon metal binding and facilitate return of the empty transporter to an outward-open state upon metal release."

The aim of this study was the improvement of raloxifene bioavailability by enhancing its solubility and cellular penetration through formulation of D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate based transferosomes and augmenting their effect with the cationic cell-penetrating peptide transactivator of transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus. Particle size, zeta potential, and transmission electron microscope investigation of the formed nanocarriers were carried out. Ex vivo raloxifene permeation through rat skin and cell viability studies was investigated. The results of D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate- transactivator of transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus transferosomes showed an average vesicle size of 96.05 nm with positively charged vesicles 39.4 mV of zeta potential value. The results revealed significant (p < 0.05) enhancement of raloxifene permeation from raloxifene transferosomes- loaded film when compared with raw raloxifene film. IC50 results showed significant improvement of formulated raloxifene cytotoxicity by 1.42-fold in comparison with raw raloxifene against MCF-7 cell lines. The developed raloxifene—transferosomes are considered promising nano-lipid carriers for the enhancement delivery of raloxifene."
https://openalex.org/W2997929940,"Rearing dual-purpose chickens is a practicable approach to avoid culling one-day-old male layer chicks. The present study examined the impact of a conventional fattening diet on the liver of a novel dual-purpose chicken line (Lohmann Dual, LD) in comparison to a broiler (Ross 308) chicken line. Age-related changes of structure and lipid content of the liver were assessed. One hundred twenty and newly hatched chicks (LD = 66, Ross = 54) were kept under the same husbandry conditions and fed a commercial diet for 5 weeks for Ross and 9 weeks for LD. Six birds of each line were examined weekly. Their body weight (BW) and liver mass were recorded. Microscopic structure and ultrastructure of the liver were investigated and the liver lipid content was measured using a pre-validated method. During the study period, liver mass increased with age, while normalized liver mass decreased. Furthermore, liver mass of Ross birds was greater than that of LD birds of the same BW. Overall, no significant differences were observed in the hepatic structure or ultrastructure between the two chicken lines. The hepatic lymphatic aggregations were without fibrous capsules and their number and area increased throughout the first week, then the values began to fluctuate with age in both chicken lines. The changes in the liver lipid content of the two chicken lines were within the normal physiological range over the term of the study. The liver lipid content correlated negatively with age and body weight in both lines. It was the highest on the first day then decreased until day 7 and thereafter did not change in both chicken lines. However, given the same body weight, the Ross chickens had a 9% greater liver lipid content than LD chickens. It is concluded that there is no apparent adverse effect of a high-energy diet on the liver of LD chickens."
https://openalex.org/W2998407875,"Plant homeodomain (PHD) proteins are prevalent in eukaryotes and play important roles in plant growth, development and abiotic stress response. In this study, the comprehensive study of the PHD family (StPHD) was performed in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). Seventy-two PHD genes (named StPHD1-72) were identified and grouped into 10 subfamilies based on phylogenetic analysis. Similar structure organizations were found within each subfamily according to the exon/intron structures and protein motif analysis. These genes were unequally scattered on the chromosomes of potato, with 9 pairs of segmental duplicated genes and 6 pairs of tandem duplicated genes showing that both segmental duplicated and tandem duplicated events contributed to the expansion of the potato PHD family. The gene ontology (GO) analysis suggests that StPHD mainly functioned at the intracellular level and was involved in various binding, metabolic and regulation processes. The analysis of expression patterns of StPHD genes showed that these genes were differentially expressed in 10 different tissues and responded specifically to heat, salt and drought stress based on the FPKM (Fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads) values of the RNA-seq data. Furthermore, the real-time quantitative PCR for 12 selected StPHD genes revealed the various levels of gene expression corresponding to abiotic stress. Our results provide useful information for a better understanding of PHD genes and provide the foundation for additional functional exploration of the potato PHD gene family."

A sample of 1552 track and field athletes (mean age 18.57±0.41 years) who were finalists at the national high school (junior) championships in Jamaica between 2000 and 2017 were evaluated from the Jamaica Athletics Administrative Association database. The database provided birth date, school attendance and performance results. A retrospective analysis was completed to investigate the relationship between junior and senior successes and dropout rates. Chi-square analyses were conducted to examine the distribution of birth date quartiles based on the selection year. Using the Jamaican census information, the population size of regions where participants attended school were categorized and used as a proxy for athletes’ place of development. Results showed that the majority of the participants did not progress to senior levels (81%). The relative age effect was evident for athletes who progressed to the senior level but was not evident for athletes who did not progress. There was a bias towards participants who attended school in regions with a population size between 5000–29 999. This study illuminates some of the contextual factors that may influence the likelihood of progressing from junior to senior levels which may help to inform talent identification, selection and development in the sport of track and field."
https://openalex.org/W2996851187,"We monitored the survival of human pathogenic bacteria [Escherichia coli (ATCC), extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing E. coli (Clinical isolate), New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase-producing E. coli (clinical isolate), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC)] on dry materials (vinyl chloride, aluminum, plastic, stainless steel) at distinct temperatures (room temperature or 15°C–37°C). These bacteria favored a lower temperature for their prolonged survival on the dry fomites, regardless of the material type. Interestingly, when mixed with S. aureus, E. coli survived for a longer time at a lower temperature. Cardiolipin, which can promote the survival of S. aureus in harsh environments, had no effect on maintaining the survival of E. coli. Although the trends remained unchanged, adjusting the humidity from 40% to 60% affected the survival of bacteria on dry surfaces. Scanning electron microscopic analysis revealed no morphological differences in these bacteria immediately before or after one day of dry conditions. In addition, ATP assessment, a method used to visualize high-touch surfaces in hospitals, was not effective at monitoring bacterial dynamics. A specialized handrail device fitted with a heater, which was maintained at normal human body core temperature, successfully prohibited the prolonged survival of bacteria [Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC), E. coli (ATCC), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC), S. aureus (ATCC), Acinetobacter baumannii (clinical isolate), and Serratia marcescens (clinical isolate)], with the exception of spore-forming Bacillus subtilis (from our laboratory collection) and the yeast-like fungus Candida albicans (from our laboratory collection)] on dry surfaces. Taken together, we concluded that the tested bacteria favor lower temperatures for their survival in dry environments. Therefore, the thermal control of dry fomites has the potential to control bacterial survival on high-touch surfaces in hospitals."
https://openalex.org/W2997169514,"Staphylococcus aureus is known to produce persistent and chronic infections in both humans and animals. It is recognized that small-colony variants (SCVs), which produce higher levels of biofilm and that are capable of intracellular persistence, contribute to the chronicity or recurrence of infections and that this phenotype is inherent to the pathogenesis process. Prevention of S. aureus infections through vaccination has not yet met with considerable success. Some of the current vaccine formulations for S. aureus bovine mastitis consist of inactivated S. aureus bacteria, sometimes combined to E. coli J5. As such, the stimulation of cell-mediated immunity by these vaccines might not be optimal. With this in mind, we recently engineered a genetically stable double mutant SCV (ΔvraGΔhemB), which was highly attenuated in a mastitis model of infection. The present work describes the immune responses elicited in mice by various experimental vaccine compositions including the live-attenuated SCV double mutant and its inactivated form, combined or not with inactivated E. coli J5. The live-attenuated SCV was found to provoke a strong and balanced humoral response in immunized mice, as well as strong proliferation of ex-vivo stimulated splenocytes isolated from these animals. These splenocytes were also found to release high concentration of IL-17 and IFN-γ when compared to every other vaccination formulation. Inversely, the inactivated whole-cell vaccine, alone or in combination with the E. coli J5 bacterin, elicited lower antibody titers and failed to induce Th1 or Th17 cell-mediated responses in the splenocyte proliferation assay. Our results suggest that live-attenuated SCVs can trigger host immunity differently than inactivated bacteria and could represent a suitable vector for inducing strong humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, which are crucial for protection. This could represent an important improvement over existing vaccine formulations for preventing S. aureus bovine mastitis and other infections caused by this pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2997767664,"The importance of the microbiome in health and its disruption in disease is continuing to be elucidated. However, the multitude of host and environmental factors that influence the microbiome are still largely unknown. Here, we examined UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N -acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 3 ( Galnt3 )-deficient mice, which serve as a model for the disease hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis (HFTC). In HFTC, loss of GALNT3 activity in the bone is thought to lead to altered glycosylation of the phosphate-regulating hormone fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), resulting in hyperphosphatemia and subdermal calcified tumors. However, GALNT3 is expressed in other tissues in addition to bone, suggesting that systemic loss could result in other pathologies. Using semiquantitative real-time PCR, we found that Galnt3 is the major O -glycosyltransferase expressed in the secretory cells of salivary glands. Additionally, 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that the loss of Galnt3 resulted in changes in the structure, composition, and stability of the oral microbiome. Moreover, we identified the major secreted salivary mucin, Muc10, as an in vivo substrate of Galnt3. Given that mucins and their O -glycans are known to interact with various microbes, our results suggest that loss of Galnt3 decreases glycosylation of Muc10, which alters the composition and stability of the oral microbiome. Considering that oral findings have been documented in HFTC patients, our study suggests that investigating GALNT3-mediated changes in the oral microbiome may be warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2997849032,"Objectives To measure the prevalence and correlates of abnormal menstruation among women living with HIV (WLWH) in Canada. Methods We used cross-sectional questionnaire data from the community-based Canadian HIV Women’s Sexual and Reproductive Health Cohort Study (CHIWOS), which enrolled WLWH aged ≥16 from British Columbia (BC), Ontario, and Quebec. For this analysis, we excluded women >45 years, who had primary amenorrhea, were pregnant, on hormonal contraception, or who reported history of endometrial cancer, last menstrual period >12 months ago, or premature ovarian failure. The primary outcome was abnormal menstruation (Yes vs No) based on responses to five questions about menstrual regularity, frequency, volume, duration, and intermenstrual bleeding in the six months prior to interview. An exploratory multivariable logistic regression analysis examined independent correlates of abnormal menstruation. Results Of 1422 women enrolled, 521 (37%) met eligibility criteria. Overall, 55.9% (95% CI:52%-60%) reported abnormal menstruation. In adjusted analyses, abnormal menstruation was associated with having a biologic sister/mother who entered menopause before age 40 (AOR 5.01, 95%CI 1.39–18.03), Hepatitis B co-infection (AOR 6.97, 95%CI 1.52–31.88), current smoking (AOR 1.69, 95%CI 1.55–3.41); and currently taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) (AOR 2.36, 95%CI 1.25–4.45) compared to being ART-naïve. Women in BC had higher adjusted odds of abnormal menstruation (AOR 2.95, 95%CI 1.61–5.39), relative to women in Ontario and Quebec. Conclusions Over half of WLWH in this analysis had abnormal menstruation. Correlates of abnormal menstruation include genetic, socio-behavioural factors (province of residence, smoking), Hepatitis B co-infection, and current ART use."

The effects of oat β-glucan concentration and pressure on the properties of mixed gels with the different ratios of varying molecular weight (MW) β-gulcan induced by HPP were investigated. The results showed that the lowest β-glucan concentration forming a gel was 15% at 200 MPa, while 8% β-glucan was required to form a gel at 500 MPa. The gel intensity and textural properties increased with elevating β-glucan total concentration and pressure. The characteristic compact and smooth mixed gel formed with 12% β-glucan at a ratio of 50:50 at 400 MPa for 30 min. Under this optimal parameters, the mixed solution showed a relatively lower particle size and turbidity, and the hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction played the main role during the gel formation process by high pressure. In addition, the core molecular structure of β-glucan was maintained in the mixed gel formed under the optimal parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2998428485,"Cyclophilins are structurally conserved pan-allergens showing extensive cross-reactivity. So far, no precise information on cross-reactive IgE-epitopes of cyclophilins is available. Here, an 18-kDa IgE-reactive cyclophilin (Rhi o 2) was purified from Rhizopus oryzae, an indoor mold causing allergic sensitization. Based on LC-MS/MS-derived sequences of natural Rhi o 2, the full-length cDNA was cloned, and expressed as recombinant (r) allergen. Purified rRhi o 2 displayed IgE-reactivity and basophil degranulation with sera from all cyclophilin-positive patients. The melting curve of properly folded rRhi o 2 showed partial refolding after heat denaturation. The allergen displayed monomeric functional peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity. In IgE-inhibition assays, rRhi o 2 exhibited extensive cross-reactivity with various other cyclophilins reported as allergens from diverse sources including its homologous human autoantigen. By generating a series of deletion mutants, a conserved 69-residue (Asn81-Asn149) fragment at C terminus of Rhi o 2 was identified as crucial for IgE-recognition and cross-reactivity. Grafting of the Asn81-Asn149 fragment within the primary structure of yeast cyclophilin CPR1 by replacing its homologous sequence resulted in a hybrid molecule with structural folds similar to Rhi o 2. The IgE-reactivity and allergenic activity of the hybrid cyclophilin were greater than that of CPR1. Therefore, the Asn81-Asn149 fragment can be considered as the site of IgE recognition of Rhi o 2. Hence, Rhi o 2 serves as a candidate antigen for the molecular diagnosis of mold allergy, and determination of a major cross-reactive IgE-epitope has clinical potential for the design of next-generation immunotherapeutics against cyclophilin-induced allergies."
https://openalex.org/W2996895379,"The metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 1 (mGluR1) is a major subtype of group I mGluRs, which contributes to the development and plasticity of synapses in the brain. In the sensory thalamus, the thalamocortical neuron receives sensory afferents and massive feedback input from corticothalamic (CT) fibers. Notably, mGluR1 is more concentrated in CT synapses in the sensory thalamus. In the visual thalamus, mGluR1 maintains mature afferent synaptic connectivity. However, it is unknown whether mGluR1 contributes to strengthening of immature synapses or weakening of excess synapses during development and whether mGluR1 at CT synapses heterosynaptically regulates the development or refinement of afferent synapses. Here we investigated the effects of knocking out the gene encoding mGluR1 or pharmacologically blocking cortical activity on the development and maintenance of lemniscal synapses, i.e., the somatosensory afferent synapses, in the ventral posteromedial somatosensory thalamus. mGluR1-knockout (KO) mice exhibited delayed developmental strengthening as well as incomplete elimination and remodeling after maturation of lemniscal synapses. Similar to the phenotypes exhibited by mGluR1-KO mice, pharmacological blockade of somatosensory cortical activity from P12 or P21 for 1 week in wild-type mice perturbed elimination or maintenance of lemniscal synapses, respectively. The same manipulation in mGluR1-KO mice failed to induce additional abnormalities in lemniscal synaptic connectivity. These results suggest that activation of mGluR1, driven by CT input, regulates multiple stages of the development of lemniscal synapses, including strengthening, refinement, and maintenance in the somatosensory thalamus."
https://openalex.org/W2997881125,"The Auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) cadre was created to focus on maternal and child health. ANMs are respected members of their communities and established providers of maternal and child health care within the community and at the facility level. Over time, additional roles and responsibilities have been added. Despite the importance of ANMs in the primary healthcare system in India, studies that consider factors governing the performance of ANMs in their workplaces are limited. We aimed to study factors governing performance of ANMs in Pune district, India.Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 purposely selected key informants at facility, district, state, and national levels. Focus group discussions were conducted with 41 ANMs and 25 members of the community. Non-participatory observations with eight ANMs provided information to expand on and scrutinise findings that emerged from the other lines of inquiry. A realist lens was applied to identify ANMs' performance as a result of ""mechanisms"" (training, supervision, accountability mechanisms) within the given ""context"" (regulatory system, infrastructure and resources, ANMs' expanded scope of work, gender roles and norms).Weak enforcement of regulatory system led to poor standardisation of training quality among training institutions. Challenges in internal accountability mechanisms governing ANMs within the health system hierarchy made it difficult to ensure individual accountability. Training and supervision received were inadequate to address current responsibilities. The supervisory approach focused on comparing information in periodic reports against expected outputs. Clinical support in workplaces was insufficient, with very little problem identification and solving.Focusing on the tasks of ANMs with technical inputs alone is insufficient to achieve the full potential of ANMs in a changing context. Systematic efforts tackling factors governing ANMs in their workplaces can produce a useful cadre, that can play an important role in achieving universal health coverage in India."

This study examines the perceived returns on secondary schooling in Burkina Faso, where secondary school completion is among the lowest globally (<10%). Methods We conducted a two-staged qualitative study using semi-structured interviews (N = 49). In the first stage, we sampled students, dropouts, parents and teachers from a random sample of five schools (n = 39). In the second stage, we interviewed key informants knowledgeable of the school context using snowball sampling (n = 10). Systematic analysis was based on a grounded theory approach with a reading of transcripts, followed by coding of the narratives in NVivo 12. Results Respondents nearly universally perceived health benefits to schooling. In particular, key health benefits included improved sexual and reproductive health outcomes, hygiene knowledge and practices, as well as better interactions with the formal health system. Common economic returns on schooling included improved employment opportunities and the provision of support to family members, in addition to generally attaining success and recognition. Indirect and long-term health returns, however, were infrequently mentioned by respondents. Conclusions While respondents reported nearly universally short-term health benefits to schooling, responses with regard to economic as well as indirect and long-term health benefits were more ambiguous. Future intervention studies on the perceived returns on formal education are needed to inform policy and reach education and health targets in the region."
https://openalex.org/W2996965708,"In this study, essential oils (EO)-incorporated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) filters were developed for achieving dual functions in effective removing bacteria from aqueous solutions and inactivating bacteria cells captured on the filters. Tea tree essential oil (TTO), lemon essential oil (LEO), and TTO-LEO-mixture were coated on MWCNTs filters with different MWCNTs loadings ranging from 3 mg to 6 mg. MWCNTs filters with 6.0 mg MWCNTs showed complete removal (100%) of E. coli cells from PBS buffer with 6.35 log10 decrease of cell numbers. TTO, LEO, and TTO/LEO Mix (1:1) coatings at the volume of 50 μL on MWCNTs filters achieved bacterial removal rates of >98%, and highly effective inactivation efficiency. TTO coatings had the highest antimicrobial efficacies than LEO and Mix coatings, MWCNTs filters with 50 μL TTO coating showed 100% inhibitory rate of the captured bacteria on the filter surfaces. Those captured but survived cells on filters with less TTO coating (20μL) significantly reduced their salt tolerances to 30 and 40 g/L NaCl in LB agar, and became less salt tolerance with longer incubation time on the filters. The developed TTO-MWCNTs filters had much higher antimicrobial efficacies than the filters with dual functions developed previously."

We asked here whether training on stimuli containing temporal-envelope cues without speech content can improve the perception of spectrally-degraded (vocoded) speech in which the temporal-envelope (but not the temporal fine structure) is mainly preserved. Two groups of listeners were trained on different amplitude-modulation (AM) based tasks, either AM detection or AM-rate discrimination (21 blocks of 60 trials during two days, 1260 trials; frequency range: 4Hz, 8Hz, and 16Hz), while an additional control group did not undertake any training. Consonant identification in vocoded vowel-consonant-vowel stimuli was tested before and after training on the AM tasks (or at an equivalent time interval for the control group). Following training, only the trained groups showed a significant improvement in the perception of vocoded speech, but the improvement did not significantly differ from that observed for controls. Thus, we do not find convincing evidence that this amount of training with temporal-envelope cues without speech content provide significant benefit for vocoded speech intelligibility. Alternative training regimens using vocoded speech along the linguistic hierarchy should be explored."

The aim of this study was to describe the association between childhood obesity and asthma severity, frequency of hospital and emergency department visits as well as pattern of aeroallergen sensitization. A retrospective study was conducted at pediatric outpatient clinics in University Hospital Sharjah. All consecutive patients aged 6 years and above, with confirmed diagnosis of asthma visiting the outpatient pediatric clinics during 2018 were included in this study. Sources of information were the patient's medical file, laboratory data, pharmacy data, as well as reports from the pediatric in charge. This study included 164 children with asthma. 63% of asthma patients were male. The vast majority of patients were from Arab ethnicities (n = 154, 94%), majority had mild asthmatic conditions (n = 133, 81%), and one-third were either overweight or obese (n = 52, 32%). Overweight or obese asthmatic children with BMI percentile of equal or more than 85% was associated with more asthma severity (odds ratio [OR]: 3.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.42-7.54; P = 0.005), as well as more frequent asthma related hospital visits (OR: 2.53, 95% CI: 1.22-5.26; P = 0.013).

https://openalex.org/W2997487063,"Background Sodium intake is excessive among Spanish children, but the salt use behaviors of parents and children are unknown. This study aims to determine behaviors related to salt intake in both schoolchildren and parents and the relationship between parental behaviors and 24 h urinary sodium excretion (UNa-24h) in children. Subjects and methods A convenience sample was taken from a cross-sectional analysis. Parents completed a self-reported questionnaire about their behaviors related to salt, and their responses were compared with the UNa-24h of their own children. The median test was used to identify differences in UNa-24h according to behaviors. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between the behaviors of parents and high sodium excretion in the children and the risk of children’s use of table salt, adjusting for age, sex, and BMI. Multinomial logistic regression models, adjusted by the covariates, were used to study the children’s salt preferences. Results A total of 329 schoolchildren from different Spanish provinces were included in the study (mean age: 9.0 ± 1.2 years, 157 girls). The majority of families (parents mean age: 42.0 ± 5.2 years) reported adding salt to food during cooking (92%), and 59% of them never looked at the sodium content on food labels. However, none of these behaviors were related to UNa-24h (p > 0.05). The use of iodized salt (53%), the presence of a salt shaker on the table (6%), and the use of table salt by fathers (57%), mothers (52%) or children (17%) increased the odds (p < 0.05) of children having a higher UNa-24h. Checking sodium content on food labels and the use of table salt by the children or father was associated with a lower preference for salty foods (p < 0.05). Conclusions It is important to make parents aware of the relationship between their behaviors regarding the use of discretionary salt and their children's sodium intake. Our data suggest that salt-specific education programs on how to reduce salt both in-home and outside the home should be implemented to improve behavior skills related to salt consumption in parents and children."
https://openalex.org/W2997518500,"It is well proven that electrical energy can be harvested from the living plants which can be used as a potential renewable energy source for powering wireless devices in remote areas where replacing or recharging the battery is a difficult task. Therefore, harvesting electrical energy from living plants in remote areas such as in farms or forest areas can be an ideal source of energy as these areas are rich with living plants. The present paper proposes a design of a power management circuit that can harness, store and manage the electrical energy which is harvested from the leaves of Aloe Barbadensis Miller (Aloe Vera) plants to trigger a transmitter load to power a remote sensor. The power management circuit consists of two sections namely; an energy storage system that acts as an energy storage reservoir to store the energy harvested from the plants as well as a voltage regulation system which is used to boost and manage the energy in accordance to a load operation. The experimental results show that the electrical energy harvested from the Aloe Vera under a specific setup condition can produce an output of 3.49 V and 1.1 mA. The harvested energy is being channeled to the power management circuit which can boost the voltage to 10.9 V under no load condition. The harvested energy from the plants boosted by the power management circuit can turn ON the transmitter automatically to activate a temperature and humidity sensor to measure the environmental stimuli periodically with a ton of 1.22 seconds and toff of 0.46 seconds. This proves that this new source of energy combined with a power management circuit can be employed for powering the wireless sensor network for application in the Internet of Things (IoT)."

This study investigates whether the facilitative effect of kūsho, the existence of which has been exclusively confirmed in younger adults, is present in old age. Moreover, to further understand the interaction between finger movement and cognitive processing, we analyzed the correlation between the kūsho effect and factors such as age, mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score, and number of years of education. The kūsho effect was assessed by a task where participants mentally assembled a set of kanji subparts to form an actual character. The results showed a significant facilitative effect of kūsho and a strong negative correlation between kūsho effect and education. This study confirms the benefits of finger movement for solving cognitive tasks involving visual processing of written language among older adults and suggests the kūsho effect may be mediated by education."

Fast and accurate determination of transgene levels is advantageous for a variety of use cases across the food, feed and fuel value chain. With the growing number of new transgenic crops, any technology used to quantify them should have robust assays that are simple to design and optimize, thereby facilitating the addition of new traits to an assay. Here we describe a PCR-based method that is simple to design, starts from whole seeds, and can be run to end-point in less than 5 minutes. Subsequent relative quantification (trait vs. non-trait) using capillary electrophoresis performed in 5% increments across the 0–100% range showed a mean absolute error of 1.9% (s.d. = 1.1%). We also show that the PCR assay can be coupled to non-optical solid-state nanopore sensors to give seed-to-trait quantification results with a mean absolute error of 2.3% (s.d. = 1.6%). In concert, the fast PCR and nanopore sensing stages demonstrated here can be fully integrated to produce seed-to-trait quantification results in less than 10 minutes, with high accuracy across the full dynamic range."
https://openalex.org/W2998640113,"The HIV genome is rich in A but not G or U and deficient in C. This nucleotide bias controls HIV phenotype by determining the highly unusual composition of all major HIV proteins. The bias is also responsible for the high frequency of narrow DNA minor groove sites in the double-stranded HIV genome as compared to cellular protein coding sequences and the bulk of the human genome. Since drugs that bind in the DNA minor groove disrupt nucleosomes on sequences that contain closely spaced oligo-A tracts which are prevalent in HIV DNA because of its bias, it was of interest to determine if these drugs exert this selective inhibitory effect on HIV chromatin. To test this possibility, nucleosomes were reconstituted onto five double-stranded DNA fragments from the HIV-1 pol gene in the presence and in the absence of several minor groove binding drugs (MGBDs). The results demonstrated that the MGBDs inhibited the assembly of nucleosomes onto all of the HIV-1 segments in a manner that was proportional to the A-bias, but had no detectable effect on the formation of nucleosomes on control cloned fragments or genomic DNA from chicken and human. Nucleosomes preassembled onto HIV DNA were also preferentially destabilized by the drugs as evidenced by enhanced nuclease accessibility in physiological ionic strength and by the preferential loss of the histone octamer in hyper-physiological salt solutions. The drugs also selectively disrupted HIV-containing nucleosomes in yeast as revealed by enhanced nuclease accessibility of the in vivo assembled HIV chromatin and reductions in superhelical densities of plasmid chromatin containing HIV sequences. A comparison of these results to the density of A-tracts in the HIV genome indicates that a large fraction of the nucleosomes that make up HIV chromatin should be preferred in vitro targets for the MGBDs. These results show that the MGBDs preferentially disrupt HIV-1 chromatin in vitro and in vivo and raise the possibility that non-toxic derivatives of certain MGBDs might serve as a novel class of anti-HIV agents."

Whilst retail footwear is commonly recommended by health professionals, there is no current consensus on recommended features of retail footwear for women with RA. This study aimed to determine consensus from health professionals about the important features of retail footwear for women with RA. Methods An international Delphi exercise using online survey software was conducted with 39 participants from health care backgrounds. Three iterative rounds were conducted. In the first round, participants listed features of retail footwear that would be important for women with RA. Responses of the first round, combined with results of a scoping review of patient-reported outcome measures used in assessing footwear in arthritis and a qualitative analysis of female patients’ perspectives of retail footwear in RA were used to create items for the second round. Items were scored by a 9-point rating scale with consensus defined by the RAND/UCLA disagreement index. The third round consisted of items which did not reach consensus or scored >1 on the RAND/UCLA disagreement index from round two. Results Fifty-eight items (n = 58) were generated for rating and at the end of three iterative rounds, there was agreement that thirty-eight items were important, that two were not important, and there was no agreement for a further eighteen items. Item themes reaching consensus included footwear characteristics and acceptability and psychosocial aspects of footwear. Footwear characteristics related to heel height, shape, cushioning, toe box size, adjustable fastening, removable insoles, mid-foot support and soft accommodative uppers. Acceptability and psychosocial aspects included affordability, comfort, aesthetic, style, colour and impact on femininity. Conclusion This consensus exercise has identified the important features of retail footwear for women with RA."
https://openalex.org/W2997866194,"Background Sputum remains the most preferred specimen for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis due to its non-invasive method of production. Good quality sputum specimen is essential for accurate diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). It is therefore imperative to assess factors that are related to the production of sputum that is of the best quality. Objective We assessed the intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics of presumed tuberculosis patients and the quality of sputum they produced. Methods This was a cross-sectional study in which consenting enrolled presumed tuberculosis patients were subjected to medical examination and a structured questionnaire administered to collect clinical history, demographic information, environmental and behavioral characteristics. The enrolled participants were instructed on how to collect spot and morning sputum specimens for macroscopic and microscopic assessment to determine any association. Results A total of 309 patients were enrolled into the study with an even distribution on gender (50.5% males). Of these, 202 (65.3%) submitted both a spot and a morning specimen for analysis. On macroscopic examination, 70% spot and 68% morning sputum were characterized as good quality (Purulent/mucoid). The factors associated (p<0.05) with quality specimen included both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The intrinsic factors included: difficulty in breathing, presence of conjunctivitis and knowledge of the disease whereas the only extrinsic factor associated with production of good quality sputum for tuberculosis diagnosis was time taken by patient to seek tuberculosis treatment after occurrence of any of the TB symptoms. Conclusion Both intrinsic and extrinsic factors affected the quality of sputum produced by presumed tuberculosis patients. Clinical and behavioral characteristics including conjunctivitis, difficulty in breathing and delay in seeking treatment were important factors that determined the production of good quality sputum specimens, while knowledge of tuberculosis disease did not compel presumed tuberculosis patients to produce good quality sputum for diagnosis of the disease."
