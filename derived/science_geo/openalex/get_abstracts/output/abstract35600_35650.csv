https://openalex.org/W2042391719,The three-dimensional structure of human serum albumin has been solved at 6.0 angstrom (A) resolution by the method of multiple isomorphous replacement. Crystals were grown from solutions of polyethylene glycol in the infrequently observed space group P42(1)2 (unit cell constants a = b = 186.5 +/- 0.5 A and c = 81.0 +/- 0.5 A) and diffracted x-rays to lattice d-spacings of less than 2.9 A. The electron density maps are of high quality and revealed the structure as a predominantly alpha-helical globin protein in which the course of the polypeptide can be traced. The binding loci of several organic compounds have been determined.

The hydrolytic activity was precipitated by antibody to human IgG, it was bound by immobilized protein G and showed a molecular mass close to 150 kilodaltons by gel filtration chromatography, properties similar to those of authentic IgG. The Fab fragment, prepared from IgG by papain treatment, retained the VIP hydrolytic activity of the IgG. Peptide fragments produced by treatment of VIP with the antibody fraction were purified by reversed-phase HPLC and identified by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry and peptide sequencing. The scissile bond in VIP deduced from these experiments was Gln16-Met17. The antibody concentration (73.4 fmol per milligram of IgG) and the Kd (0.4 nM) were computed from analysis of VIP binding under conditions that did not result in peptide hydrolysis. Analysis of the antibody-mediated VIP hydrolysis at varying concentrations of substrate suggested conformity with Michaelis-Menton kinetics (Km). The values for Km (37.9 × 10-9M) and the turnover number kcat (15.6 min-1) suggested relatively tight VIP binding and a moderate catalytic efficiency of the antibody."
https://openalex.org/W2072723883,"Neurotransmitter receptors are usually restricted to neuronal cells, but the signaling pathways activated by these receptors are widely distributed in both neural and non-neural cells. The functional consequences of activating a brain-specific neurotransmitter receptor, the serotonin 5HT1c receptor, in the unnatural environment of a fibroblast were examined. Introduction of functional 5HT1c receptors into NIH 3T3 cells results, at high frequency, in the generation of transformed foci. Moreover, the generation and maintenance of transformed foci requires continued activation of the serotonin receptor. In addition, the injection of cells derived from transformed foci into nude mice results in the generation of tumors. The serotonin 5HT1c receptor therefore functions as a protooncogene when expressed in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1598270217,"This study examined the role of extracellular matrix in regulating matrix phenotype of hepatic lipocytes, the major source of matrix in liver. Lipocytes (Ito, stellate, or fat-storing cells) were purified from normal rat liver and established in primary culture on either uncoated plastic, plastic coated with individual matrix proteins, or a complete gel matrix, a basement membrane-like matrix derived from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) murine tumor. The ultrastructure of lipocytes cultured on the gel matrix resembled that of cells in normal liver, whereas lipocytes on plastic had dispersed nuclear chromatin and expanded rough endoplasmic reticulum, consistent with active proliferation and secretion. Lipocytes on the gel matrix exhibited no proliferative activity; cells maintained on plastic proliferated and produced type I collagen predominantly. Total collagen secretion by lipocytes on the gel matrix was 29% of that of cells on plastic, and consisted of type III collagen only. This difference extended to proteoglycan production, which was less than 5% of the amount produced by cells in conventional culture on plastic. The effects of the EHS gel were not reproduced by the individual components of the gel (laminin, type IV collagen, and heparan sulfate proteoglycan) or by a type I collagen gel. They were also reversible upon transfer of the cells to conventional culture. In contrast to lipocytes, collagen synthesis by hepatocytes was similar whether cultured on EHS gel or on plastic. These results show that the extracellular matrix can modulate matrix protein production by lipocytes and imply that, in early hepatic inflammation, changes in the hepatic subendothelial matrix may underlie stimulation of lipocyte matrix production and progression of the fibrotic process."
https://openalex.org/W2030684274,"Two types of potassium-selective channels activated by intracellular arachidonic acid or phosphatidylcholine have been found in neonatal rat atrial cells. In inside-out patches, arachidonic acid and phosphatidylcholine each opened outwardly rectifying potassium-selective channels with conductances of 160 picosiemens (IK.AA) and 68 picosiemens (IK.PC), respectively. These potassium channels were not sensitive to internally applied adenosine triphosphate (ATP), magnesium, or calcium. Lowering the intracellular pH from 7.2 to 6.8 or 6.4 reversibly increased IK.AA channel activity three- or tenfold, respectively. A number of fatty acid derivatives were tested for their ability to activate IK.AA. These potassium-selective channels may help explain the increase in potassium conductance observed in ischemic cells and raise the possibility that fatty acid derivatives act as second messengers."
https://openalex.org/W2060297361,"A molecular dynamics simulation method is used to determine the contributions of individual amino acid residues and solvent molecules to free energy changes in proteins. Its application to the hemoglobin interface mutant Asp G1(99) beta----Ala shows that some of the contributions to the difference in the free energy of cooperativity are as large as 60 kilocalories (kcal) per mole. Since the overall free energy change is only -5.5 kcal/mole (versus the experimental value of -3.4 kcal/mole), essential elements of the thermodynamics are hidden in the measured results. By exposing the individual contributions, the free energy simulation provides new insights into the origin of thermodynamic changes in mutant proteins and demonstrates the role of effects beyond those usually considered in structural analyses."

https://openalex.org/W1605371693,"Reaction of horse myoglobin with H2O2 oxidizes the iron to the ferryl (Fe(IV) = O) state and produces a protein radical that is rapidly dissipated by poorly understood mechanisms. As reported here, the reaction with H2O2 results in covalent binding of up to 18% of the prosthetic heme group to the protein. The chromophore of the protein-bound prosthetic group is very similar to that of heme itself. High performance liquid chromatography of tryptic digests indicates that the formation of heme-bound peptides is associated with disappearance of the peptide with the sequence YLE-FISDAIIHVLHSK corresponding to residues 103-118 of horse myoglobin. Amino acid analysis, terminal amino acid sequencing, and liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry establish that the heme is primarily attached to this peptide. The heme appears to be bound to the tyrosine residue because the tyrosine is the only amino acid that disappears from the amino acid analysis. The mass spectrometric data indicates that the heme-peptide is formed without addition or loss of an oxygen or other major structural fragment. The site of attachment to the heme group has not been unambiguously determined, but the heme vinyl groups are not essential for the reaction because equal cross-linking is observed in H2O2-treated mesoheme-reconstituted myoglobin. The results are most consistent with binding of tyrosine 103 to a meso-carbon of the prosthetic heme group."
https://openalex.org/W1975525528,"The eye needs to biosynthesize 11-cis-retinoids because the chromophore of rhodopsin is 11-cis-retinal. The critical metabolic step is the endergonic isomerization of free all-trans-retinol (vitamin A) into 11-cis-retinol. This isomerization process can take place in isolated membranes from the retinal pigment epithelium in the absence of added energy sources. Specific binding proteins probably do not serve as an energy source, and since all of the reactions in the visual cycle are shown here to be reversible, trapping reactions also do not participate in the isomerization reaction. One previously unexplored possibility is that the chemical energy in the bonds of the membrane itself may drive the isomerization reaction. A group transfer reaction is proposed that forms a retinyl ester from a lipid acyl donor and vitamin A. This transfer can drive the isomerization reaction because the all-trans-retinyl ester is isomerized directly to 11-cis-retinol. Thus, the free energy of hydrolysis of the ester is coupled to the thermodynamically uphill trans to cis isomerization. The prediction of an obligate C-O bond cleavage in the vitamin A moiety during isomerization is borne out. Although the natural substrate for isomerization is not known, all-trans-retinyl palmitate is processed in vitro to 11-cis-retinol by pigment epithelial membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1993692199,"THE adhesion of neutrophils to vascular endothelium is an early event in their recruitment into acute inflammatory lesions1. In evaluating potential neutrophil–endothelial adhesive mechanisms in acute inflammation, important considerations are that adhesion in vivo may occur very rapidly following injury2–4 and that the specificity of the reaction resides in altered endothelium5. That is, neutrophils adhere only to altered endothelium adjacent to an inflammatory focus, rather than at random as would be expected if activation of neutrophils were the initiator of adhesion. We have explored a possible bridging role for complement in causing early neutrophil–endothelial cell adhesion. The complement system is involved in inflammatory processes, is capable of rapid amplification, and endothelial complement fixation at sites of inflammation could generate an endothelium-restricted signal for neutrophil adhesion. We have now developed a model in which this can be investigated without complicating factors such as immunoglobulin deposition, by constructing a novel molecule, a hybrid of the endothelial binding lectin Ulex europaeus I (ref. 6) and of the complement activator cobra venom factor7,8. This molecule has the capacity to cause fixation of complement on human unbilical vein endothelial cells. We show that complement fixation is a potent and rapid stimulus for neutrophil adhesion. Neutrophil adhesion requires only endothelial deposition of C3, and is mediated through the type 3 complement receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1540941492,"In a number of cell lines, epidermal growth factor (EGF) rapidly stimulates the breakdown of inositol phospholipids. Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PLC), therefore, plays an important role in this biological response to EGF, but the mechanism by which EGF-receptor complexes modulate the activation of PLC is not understood. We have previously suggested that tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC or an unknown PLC-associated protein by the EGF receptor is involved in the activation process (Wahl, M. I., Daniel, T. O., and Carpenter, G. (1988) Science 241, 968–970) and have recently shown by immunoprecipitation that the addition of EGF to 32P-labeled cells increases tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of PLC-II (Wahl, M. I., Nishibe, S., Suh, P.-G., Rhee, S. G., and Carpenter, G. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 86,1568–1572). In this communication we demonstrate that PLC-II (Mr = 145,000) purified from bovine brain can be phosphorylated in vitro in an EGF-dependent manner by the tyrosine kinase activity of the purified EGF receptor. While PLC-II is an efficient phosphorylation substrate for the purified EGF receptor, PLC-I is a poor substrate and PLC-IH is not phosphorylated to any detectable extent. Though all three PLC isozymes possess typical tyrosine phosphorylation sequences, the EGF receptor is surprisingly selective in vitro for the phosphorylation of PLC-II. High performance liquid chromatography comparison of tryptic phosphotyrosyl peptides from PLC-II phosphorylated in vivo and in vitro indicated a similar pattern of multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. These findings show that the EGF receptor can directly phosphorylate PLC-II in an efficient and selective manner."

https://openalex.org/W1495117278,"The fate of the acetyl-CoA units released during peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation was studied in isolated hepatocytes from normal and peroxisome-proliferated rats. Ketogenesis and hydrogen peroxide generation were employed as indicators of mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation, respectively. Butyric and hexanoic acids were employed as mitochondrial substrates, 1, omega-dicarboxylic acids as predominantly peroxisomal substrates, and lauric acid as a substrate for both mitochondria and peroxisomes. Ketogenesis from dicarboxylic acids was either absent or very low in normal and peroxisome-proliferated hepatocytes, but free acetate release was detected at rates that could account for all the acetyl-CoA produced in peroxisomes by dicarboxylic and also by monocarboxylic acids. Mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation also led to free acetate generation but at low rates relative to ketogenesis. The origin of the acetate released was confirmed employing [1-14C]dodecanedioic acid. Thus, the activity of peroxisomes might contribute significantly to the free acetate generation known to occur during fatty acid oxidation in rats and possibly also in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1564988623,"We have studied the incorporation and interconversion of purines into nucleotides by freshly isolated Toxoplasma gondii. They did not synthesize nucleotides from formate, glycine, or serine. The purine bases hypoxanthine, xanthine, guanine, and adenine were incorporated at 9.2, 6.2, 5.1, and 4.3 pmol/10(7) cells/h, respectively. The purine nucleosides adenosine, inosine, guanosine, and xanthosine were incorporated at 110, 9.0, 2.7, and 0.3 pmol/10(7) cells/h, respectively. Guanine, xanthine, and their respective nucleosides labeled only guanine nucleotides. Inosine, hypoxanthine, and adenine labeled both adenine and guanine nucleotide pools at nearly equal ratios. Adenosine kinase was greater than 10-fold more active than the next most active enzyme in vitro. This is consistent with the metabolic data in vivo. No other nucleoside kinase or phosphotransferase activities were found. Phosphorylase activities were detected for guanosine and inosine; no other cleavage activities were detected. Deaminases were found for adenine and guanine. Phosphoribosyltransferase activities were detected for all four purine nucleobases. Interconversion occurs only in the direction of adenine to guanine nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1552103205,"The effects of botulinum neurotoxins or their light and heavy chain subunits were investigated in digitonin-permeabilized adrenal chromaffin cells. Because these cells are permeable to proteins, the toxin had direct access to the cell interior. Botulinum type A neurotoxin and its light chain subunit inhibited Ca2+-dependent catecholamine secretion in a dose-dependent manner. The heavy chain subunit had no effect. Inhibition required introduction of the neurotoxin or light chain into the cell and was not seen when intact cells were incubated with these proteins. The inhibition of secretion by type A neurotoxin and light chain was incomplete, the maximal response being 65%. The inhibition was not overcome by increasing Ca2+ concentrations. The action of the light chain was irreversible and rapid. Botulinum type E neurotoxin also inhibited secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Its potency was increased 30-fold following mild trypsinization, which nicked the single chain protein to the dichain form. In contrast to the results seen with types A and E, botulinum type B neurotoxin did not inhibit secretion, while its light chain totally abolished secretion. Trypsinization of the neurotoxin produced the dichain form, which did not inhibit secretion. Reduction of the trypsinized neurotoxin with dithiothreitol produced inhibition equivalent to that seen with the purified light chain subunit. Isolated type A heavy chain had no effect on the inhibitory action of type A or B light chains. The data demonstrate that the ability of botulinum neurotoxins to inhibit secretion is confined to the light chain region of these proteins. Furthermore, while the botulinum neurotoxin types A, B, and E have similar macrostructures, they are not identical with respect to their biological activities."
https://openalex.org/W2013280951,"The scanning tunneling microscope can image uncoated DNA submerged in water. The grooves of the double helix were clearly resolved in images of the 146-base pair fragment extracted from calf thymus nucleosome. In contrast to images obtained with dry DNA, the helix pitch varied only a small amount (36 +/- 5 angstroms). The path of the helix shows considerable variation. It is quite straight when the molecules are densely packed, but it curves and bends in isolated molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1482652685,"Previous studies have demonstrated that rat aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC) show marked changes in smooth muscle (SM) alpha-actin content and fractional synthesis as a function of cell density and growth (Owens, G. K., Loeb, A., Gordon, D., and Thompson, M. M. (1986) J. Cell Biol. 102, 343-352; Blank, R., Thompson, M. M., and Owens, G. K. (1988) J. Cell Biol. 107, 299-306). Results of this study show that, although there is a 6-fold increase in SM alpha-actin content in postconfluent density arrested cultures as compared to proliferating subconfluent cultures, SM alpha-actin mRNA levels are not different between these cells. This suggests that the SM alpha-actin gene is constitutively active under both of these conditions and that accumulation of SM alpha-actin in postconfluent cells is due to translational and/or post-translational controls. The relationship between growth and cytodifferentiation was further explored by examining the effects of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)- or serum-induced growth on actin expression in postconfluent, quiescent cultures maintained in a defined serum-free media. Although both factors have been shown to stimulate proliferation and decrease fractional SM alpha-actin synthesis (Blank et al., 1988), their effects on actin mRNA levels were quite different. PDGF was found to induce a dramatic drop in SM alpha-actin steady state mRNA level but had no effect on nonmuscle beta-actin mRNA level. In contrast, serum stimulation was shown to increase nonmuscle beta-actin mRNA level, whereas SM alpha-actin mRNA level remained constant. Taken together these results indicate that PDGF is a specific and potent repressor of SM alpha-actin expression in vascular SMC and implicate a possible developmental role for PDGF in control of SMC differentiation. In addition, the observation that the level of SM alpha-actin mRNA is unaltered in serum-stimulated cells indicates that an absolute decrease in SM alpha-actin mRNA is not obligatory for cell cycle entrance."

https://openalex.org/W1562925340,"Abstract Transcription factor IIIC2 (TFIIIC2), together with other transcription factors (TFIIIB and TFIIIC1), is required for the in vitro transcription of tRNA and adenovirus VA genes by RNA polymerase III. Previous studies have shown that TFIIIC2 is a high molecular weight (approximately 500,000) protein which binds with high affinity to the B-box promoter element of tRNA-type genes. A polypeptide of Mr approximately 250,000 is in close association with DNA in the specific complex between TFIIIC2 and the B-box promoter element. Here we describe the purification of TFIIIC2 by a factor of approximately 25,000 from nuclear extracts of HeLa cells by ionic exchange, affinity, and hydrophobic chromatography and sedimentation velocity centrifugation. The most purified fractions contain polypeptides of approximately 230 kDa (corresponding to the polypeptide which can be cross-linked to VA1 DNA), 110, 100, 80, and 60 kDa which co-sediment with TFIIIC2 B-box specific binding and in vitro transcriptional activities."

https://openalex.org/W1497000878,"By using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura 2, we show that the concentration of free calcium in the cytoplasm of Leishmania donovani promastigotes is maintained at very low levels (73.5 +/- 10-94 +/- 8 nM at a [Ca2+]i range of 0-1 mM). The maintenance of low [Ca2+]i is energy-dependent as it is disrupted by KCN, H+-ATPase inhibitors, and ionophores. KCN, nigericin, and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide increase cytosolic free calcium by mobilizing calcium from intracellular pools. Monensin and oligomycin increase [Ca2+]i by allowing influx of calcium from the external medium through the plasma membrane, but they have no effect on intracellular pools. Intracellular traffic of calcium was examined by measuring the transport of 45Ca2+ in digitonin-permeabilized promastigotes. Two transport systems for calcium were identified in these cells. One is respiration-dependent, suggesting a mitochondrial localization. A second system is respiration-independent but requires either endogenous or externally added ATP. The ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport is optimal at pH 7.1, has high affinity for calcium (Km = 92 nM, Vmax = 1 nmol/min/mg of protein), and is sensitive to orthovanadate. These properties suggest the presence of a Ca2+-ATPase similar to that of mammalian endoplasmic reticulum. Taken together, the results indicate that [Ca2+]i in L. donovani promastigotes is regulated at low concentration by mechanisms similar to those found in higher eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1549375498,"It was found previously that the enzyme ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3) contains specific protein substrate binding sites that are responsible for the selection of proteins for degradation by the ubiquitin system. In the present study, we have tried to gain more insight into the mode of action of E3 by the characterization of other binding sites of this enzyme. Following the ligation of ubiquitin to 125I-lysozyme, the conjugates produced are very tightly bound to E3, as indicated by size analysis on glycerol density gradient centrifugation. The strong binding of ubiquitin-protein conjugates to the enzyme may account for the apparently processive addition of multiple molecules of ubiquitin to the protein substrate. Both the protein substrate moiety and the ubiquitin moiety participate in the interaction of ubiquitin-protein conjugates with E3, as indicated by competition with specific agents and by the comparison of the binding of ubiquitin-conjugated protein to that of free protein. In addition to the binding of its substrates and products, E3 also appears to interact with some of the enzymes with which it acts in concert. When E3 is incubated with the ubiquitin-carrier protein E2, a complex is formed between the two enzymes as analyzed on glycerol gradients. The formation of an E2.E3 complex may facilitate the transfer of activated ubiquitin from E2 to the protein substrate bound to the ligase."

https://openalex.org/W1591408368,"Human neutrophil elastase catalyzes the inactivation of antithrombin by a specific and limited proteinolytic cleavage. This inactivation reaction is greatly accelerated by an active anticoagulant heparin subfraction with high binding affinity for antithrombin. A potentially complex reaction mechanism is suggested by the binding of both neutrophil elastase and antithrombin to heparin. The in vitro kinetic behavior of this system was examined under two different conditions: 1) at a constant antithrombin concentration in which the active anticoagulant heparin was varied from catalytic to saturating levels; and 2) at a fixed, saturating heparin concentration and variable antithrombin levels. Under conditions of excess heparin, the inactivation could be continuously monitored by a decrease in the ultraviolet fluorescence emission of the inhibitor. A Km of approximately 1 microM for the heparin-antithrombin complex and a turnover number of approximately 200/min was estimated from these analyses. Maximum acceleratory effects of heparin on the inactivation of antithrombin occur at heparin concentrations significantly lower than those required to saturate antithrombin. The divergence in acceleratory effect and antithrombin binding contrasts with the anticoagulant functioning of heparin in promoting the formation of covalent antithrombin-enzyme complexes and is likely to derive from the fact that neutrophil elastase is not consumed in the inactivation reaction. A size dependence was observed for the heparin effect since an anticoagulantly active octasaccharide fragment of heparin, with avid antithrombin binding activity, was without effect on the inactivation of antithrombin by neutrophil elastase. Despite the completely nonfunctional nature of elastase-cleaved antithrombin and the altered physical properties of the inhibitor as indicated by fluorescence and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the inactivated inhibitor exhibited a circulating half-life in rabbits that was indistinguishable from native antithrombin. These results point to an unexpected and apparently contradictory function for heparin which may relate to the properties of the vascular endothelium in pathological situations."
https://openalex.org/W1549615992,"Abstract We have studied the biosynthesis of rat gastric mucin in stomach segments using an antiserum against rat gastric mucin specific for peptide epitopes. Pulse-chase experiments were performed with [35S]methionine, [3H]galactose, and [35S]sulfate to label mucin precursors in different stages of biosynthesis, which were analyzed after immunoprecipitation. The earliest mucin precursor that could be detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was a 300-kDa protein. The occurrence of N-linked high-mannose oligosaccharides on this protein was shown by susceptibility to degradation by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H. This precursor could be labeled with [35S]methionine and not with [3H]galactose or [35S]sulfate. The 300-kDa precursor was converted into mature mucin after extensive glycosylation and sulfation. The mature mucin but not the 300-kDa precursor was in part secreted into the medium. Specific inhibition of sulfation with sodium chlorate had no effect on rate and amount of mucin secretion. In addition, we show that two core proteins are expressed in rats, slightly varying in Mr among individual animals."

https://openalex.org/W1581104570,"The plasma membrane lipid order of 3T3F442A cells was examined during the course of adipocyte differentiation by measuring the fluorescence polarization of 1-[4-(trimethylamino)phenyl]-6-phenylhexatriene. This cationic fluorophore labels the plasma membrane but does not rapidly redistribute to intracellular organellar membranes and can, therefore, be used to specifically probe the plasma membrane of intact cells. Studies with whole cells demonstrated that the plasma membrane of 3T3F442A cells becomes less ordered during the course of adipocyte conversion and that this alteration begins relatively early during the differentiation process. In addition, the lipid order of plasma membranes isolated from adipocyte-stage cells was found to be lower than the lipid order of the early, fibroblast-stage cells. Analysis of membrane lipid composition suggests that the molecular bases for the decrease in adipocyte plasma membrane lipid order are a large increase in the level of monounsaturated phospholipid acyl chains and a decrease in the molar ratio of cholesterol to phospholipid. The alteration in plasma membrane lipid composition may be specifically required for integral membrane protein function, since the differentiation-dependent fatty acid desaturase activity is known to be maintained even in the absence of triacylglycerol accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W1562992265,"Abstract We describe the covalent attachment of palmitate to the fusion glycoprotein of respiratory syncytial virus and the identification of the attachment site. Labeling of respiratory syncytial virus-infected Vero cells with [3H]palmitate, followed by the purification and subsequent analysis of the fusion glycoprotein in conjunction with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, demonstrated that the fatty acid is covalently attached to the F1 subunit of the fusion glycoprotein. The bound palmitate was sensitive to 1 M hydroxylamine at neutral pH. In addition, the release of palmitate label by reduction with sodium borohydride showed that the palmitate is linked to the protein through a thioester bond. Isolation of a radiolabeled peptide from a tryptic digest of the protein and subsequent amino-terminal sequence analysis revealed that the cysteine residue (amino acid residue 550) within the anchor sequence, located at the carboxyl terminus of the F1 subunit, is the covalent attachment site for palmitate."
https://openalex.org/W1543567085,"The 13C NMR spectrum of isolated nucleosome core particles contains many sharp resonances, including resonances of alpha- and beta-carbons, indicating that certain terminal segments of histones rich in basic residues are highly mobile (Hilliard, R. R., Jr., Smith, R. M., and Rill, R. L. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 5992-5998). Specific histone termini can be removed sequentially from nucleosome core particles by mild treatment with alpha-chymotrypsin or chymotrypsin plus trypsin (Rosenberg, N. L., Smith. R. M., and Rill, R. L. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 12375-12383). Comparisons of the 13C NMR spectra of native and several partially proteolyzed core particles indicated that a minimum of residues 1-20 of H3 and 1-11 and 118-128 of H2a are contained in mobile segments of native cores. H4 did not appear to contribute to the resonances from mobile histone segments, but a possible contribution of H2b residues 1-16 could not be ruled out. The 13C NMR spectra of oligonucleosomes containing and lacking lysine-rich histones (H1, H5) were similar to each other and to that of native nucleosome cores both when the oligonucleosomes were in an extended conformation at low ionic strength and when they were in a more compact conformation at higher ionic strength. This similarity suggests that histones H1 and H5 must be largely immobilized upon chromatin binding and that the segments of core histones that are mobile in isolated nucleosome cores are not strongly bound to adjacent linker regions in intact chromatin, and are not immobilized by compaction to the degree achieved in 50 mM phosphate buffer."
https://openalex.org/W1534287043,"Abstract RNA secondary structure analysis was performed to understand the translation function of the adenovirus tripartite leader, a 200-nucleotide 5' noncoding region found on all late viral mRNAs. The tripartite leader facilitates the translation of viral mRNAs at late but not early times after infection and eliminates the normal requirement for the eukaryotic initiation factor 4F or cap binding protein complex. Secondary structures were determined by probing 5' or 3' end-labeled tripartite leader RNAs under nondenaturing conditions with various single strand-specific nucleases, and the information was used to generate a potential model structure. The resulting structure is attractive since it may explain the unusual translation behavior conferred by the tripartite leader. We demonstrate that the first leader segment is predominantly single-stranded, a property consistent with the ability to enhance translation and provide independence from cap binding protein complex. In contrast, the remaining two leader segments form a moderately stable base-paired structure, except for a large hairpin loop. To confirm these findings, the secondary structure of the tripartite leader was also probed when it was attached to a large segment of a messenger RNA and was found to be very similar to that of the individual leader RNA. These findings suggest several possible mechanisms to account for the translation activity of the tripartite leader."
https://openalex.org/W1526457094,"Abstract Cholinesterases represent a ubiquitous, polymorphic family of acetylcholine hydrolyzing enzymes. The multileveled tissue-specific heterogeneity which characterizes these enzymes makes the cholinesterases an appropriate model for studying the mechanisms involved in regulating divergent pathways in protein biogenesis. For this purpose, a cDNA coding for human butyrylcholine esterase (BuChE) was subcloned into the SP 6 transcription vector. Synthetic mRNA transcribed from this construct was microninjected into Xenopus laevis oocytes alone, and in conjunction with poly(A)+ RNAs extracted from human brain or muscle. Injected BuChE-mRNA induced the biosynthesis of a protein exhibiting the catalytic activity, substrate specificity, and sensitivity to selective inhibitors characteristic of native human serum BuChE, and clearly distinct from the related enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The nascent BuChE was reproducibly distributed into low salt-soluble and detergent-extractable pools. Sucrose gradient analysis demonstrated that the nascent human enzyme was capable of limited subunit assembly, appearing as functional dimeric molecules in both of these fractions. Co-injection with brain or muscle-derived mRNAs facilitated higher order oligomeric assembly. Co-injected brain mRNA induced the appearance of tetramers while co-injected muscle mRNA induced the appearance of an array of heavy molecular forms, including a heavy 16 S form. These results indicate that the molecular determinants which distinguish BuChE from AChE are inherent to its primary amino acid sequence and that additional, tissue-specific protein(s) are involved in the modulation of subunit assembly within particular biological milieues."
https://openalex.org/W1604527618,"Abstract A mathematical description of polyglutamated folate kinetics for human breast carcinoma cells (MCF-7) has been formulated based upon experimental folate, methotrexate (MTX), purine, and pyrimidine pool sizes as well as reaction rate parameters obtained from intact MCF-7 cells and their enzyme isolates. The schema accounts for the interconversion of highly polyglutamated tetrahydrofolate, 5-methyl-FH4, 5-10-CH2FH4, dihydrofolate (FH2), 10-formyl-FH4 (FFH4), and 10-formyl-FH2 (FFH2), as well as formation and transport of the MTX polyglutamates. Inhibition mechanisms have been chosen to reproduce all observed non-, un-, and pure competition inhibition patterns. Steady state folate concentrations and thymidylate and purine synthesis rates in drug-free intact cells were used to determine normal folate Vmax values. The resulting average-cell folate model, examined for its ability to predict folate pool behavior following exposure to 1 microM MTX over 21 h, agreed well with the experiment, including a relative preservation of the FFH4 and CH2FH4 pools. The results depend strongly on thymidylate synthase (TS) reaction mechanism, especially the assumption that MTX di- and triglutamates inhibit TS synthesis as greatly in the intact cell as they do with purified enzyme. The effects of cell cycle dependence of TS and dihydrofolate reductase activities were also examined by introducing G- to S-phase activity ratios of these enzymes into the model. For activity ratios down to at least 5%, cell population averaged folate pools were only slightly affected, while CH2FH4 pools in S-phase cells were reduced to as little as 10% of control values. Significantly, these folate pool dynamics were indicated to arise from both direct inhibition by MTX polyglutamates as well as inhibition by elevated levels of polyglutamated FH2 and FFH2."
https://openalex.org/W1973569538,"Stereoscopic depth can be reversed by interchanging the left- and right-eye views (pseudoscopy) when abstract stereograms are used, but not when stereograms contain natural objects or scenes. This resistance to reversal of depth has traditionally been attributed to familiarity with the shape of objects and the presence of monocular depth cues. However, when texture disparity is neutralized by making the texture perspective of surfaces identical for both eyes, even a highly familiar object, like a monocularly recognizable human face, appears as concave (nose pointing inwards) when viewed pseudoscopically."

https://openalex.org/W1511046525,"Abstract All four subunits of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) are labeled by the lipid-soluble photolabel 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine [( 125I]TID) with different stoichiometries and levels of saturable modification sites, dependent on the conformational state of the AChR. This probe is specific for hydrophobic targets such as the membrane-spanning regions of intrinsic proteins. In the resting state, the gamma subunit is labeled 4.5 times greater and the beta and delta subunits 1.65-1.69 greater than the alpha subunit. Carbamylcholine-induced desensitization of the AChR lowers the level and alters the stoichiometry of [125I]TID incorporation into each subunit. This effect is shown to be specific in two ways. First, it is eliminated by prior equilibration with excess alpha-bungarotoxin, which does not change the [125I]TID-labeling pattern of the AChR from that of the resting state. Second, bacteriorhodopsin is labeled by [125I]TID to the same extent both in the presence and absence of carbamylcholine. The noncompetitive blocker phencyclidine does not alter [125I]TID labeling of the AChR relative to the resting state. The 43-kDa protein, which is believed to cross-link the AChR to the cytoskeleton at the synapse, is not modified by [125I]TID, in agreement with earlier conclusions that the 43-kDa protein is not an intrinsic membrane protein."
https://openalex.org/W1577432028,"The secretory proteins of Chironomus tentans larvae form insoluble fibers that are spun into threads used to construct underwater feeding and pupation tubes. We began in vitro studies of the mechanism of assembly into fibers, the structure of the assembled proteins, and the contribution of individual proteins to the assembled structure. From measurements of turbidity and electron micrographs, we observed that the secretory proteins were isolated as complexes. These complexes are most likely at initial stages of assembly; further assembly into insoluble fibers must occur in vivo. Denaturation and reduction disrupted the complexes, and removal of the denaturing and reducing agents resulted in reassembly of the complexes. The circular dichroic spectrum of the complexes indicated that the assembled proteins had the tertiary structure α + β. The largest secretory proteins were purified and shown to have both similar morphology, using electron microscopy, and a similar dichroic spectrum to that of the native complexes. We concluded that the large secretory proteins form the fibrous backbone of the complexes that we observe."
https://openalex.org/W1534119485,"Abstract Despite multiple procedures used to isolate transverse tubule vesicles from rabbit skeletal muscle, few proteins have been identified and shown to be specific to transverse tubule vesicles. Markers for purified transverse tubules have included high affinity dihydropyridine binding, cholesterol content, Mg2+-ATPase activity, (Na+,K+)-ATPase activity, and [3H] ouabain binding. Despite these markers, few proteins from purified transverse tubules can be unequivocally identified using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). In this report we have biochemically and immunologically identified rabbit albumin as a major component of purified transverse tubule membranes from rabbit skeletal muscle. Albumin composed between 5.1 and 9.8% (n = 4) of the total protein in purified transverse tubules based on scans of SDS-PAGE. Furthermore, albumin and other serum proteins are present in preparations of transverse tubules and triads but not in light sarcoplasmic reticulum. Extraction of triads with low concentrations of saponin or sodium dodecyl sulfate completely removes albumin without removing intrinsic membrane proteins. Our results suggest that albumin and other serum proteins are present in the lumen of preparations of transverse tubules and albumin may be used as a marker for the transverse tubules when analyzed on SDS gels."
https://openalex.org/W1565828087,"Abstract The immunological properties of a panel of synthetic peptides that represent the most accessible and mobile segments of the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-C4 molecule were characterized. Peptides corresponding to mouse LDH-C4 amino acid sequences: 1-14b, 5-15, 49-58, 97-110, 211-220, 231-243, 274-286, 304-316, and 318-330 were synthesized and compared in terms of binding antibodies raised in rabbits against the intact protein. Six of these sequences were covalently coupled to diphtheria toxoid and used to immunize groups of rabbits. LDH-C4-specific antibodies were detectable in immune sera by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation assays. The immunogenicity of the mouse LDH-C4 peptides in rabbits could be ranked in the following order: 5-15, 304-316 greater than 211-220, 274-286 greater than 49-58, 97-110. The immunological properties of these short synthetic peptides did not correlate with features of the mouse LDH-C4 structure except that the most active sequences appeared to be those that differed from the somatic isozymes to the greatest extent. These results have direct bearing on the selection of immunogenic LDH-C4 peptides for contraceptive vaccine studies in humans and non-human model systems."
https://openalex.org/W1524448361,"Abstract The effect of ligand binding on the environment near the SH2 and SH1 thiols in myosin subfragment 1 has been investigated by photocross-linking after specific labeling of these thiols individually with 4-(N-maleimido)benzophenone (MBP). On photolysis, cross-linking occurred from SH2-MBP to the middle 50-kDa segment, and subsequent immunopeptide mapping revealed that the cross-link was made to a peptide stretch 31-32 kDa from the N terminus in the absence of MgADP, whereas in its presence the cross-link occurred at about 60-61 kDa from the N terminus. Photolysis of SH1-MBP in the absence of MgADP resulted in a major cross-link to the 27-kDa N-terminal segment and minor cross-links to the 50-kDa middle segment. In the presence of MgADP, no new cross-link occurred but the amount of cross-linking to the 50-kDa segment increased at the expense of the other. Immunopeptide mapping indicated that the regions in the 27- and 50-kDa peptides that were cross-linked to SH1-MBP are at about 14-16 and 55-56 kDa from the N terminus respectively. These results indicate that when nucleotide binds to S1, SH2 is displaced relative to the 50-kDa segment, whereas the local environment around SH1 does not change significantly because photolysis in the presence of MgADP resulted in a change at the site of cross-linking for SH2-MBP but caused only a redistribution of the relative amounts of the cross-links formed from SH1-MBP."

Isomer III was prepared in a manner so that it was the only reactive species in the reaction mixture. The biphasic reaction time course in both the on and off reactions of isomer III and the CO combination reaction of Hb Rothschild are attributed to slow relaxation between the fast and slow CO-reacting species in the two proteins: isomer III: l'f = 6 x 10(6) M-1 s-1, l'dimer = 1.7 x 10(6) M-1 s-1, l's = 2.2 x 10(5) M-1 s-1, lf = 0.15 s-1, ls = 0.01 s-1; Hb Rothschild: l'f = 2.8 x 10(6) M-1 s-1; l's = 2.7 x 10(5) M-1 s-1."
