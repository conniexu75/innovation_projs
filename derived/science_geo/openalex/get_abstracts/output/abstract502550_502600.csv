https://openalex.org/W2133902177,"TYRO3, AXL, and MER receptors (TAMs) are three homologous type I receptor-tyrosine kinases that are activated by endogenous ligands, protein S (PROS1) and growth arrest-specific gene 6 (GAS6). These ligands can either activate TAMs as soluble factors, or, in turn, opsonize phosphatidylserine (PS) on apoptotic cells (ACs) and serve as bridging molecules between ACs and TAMs. Abnormal expression and activation of TAMs have been implicated in promoting proliferation and survival of cancer cells, as well as in suppressing anti-tumor immunity. Despite the fact that TAM receptors share significant similarity, little is known about the specificity of interaction between TAM receptors and their ligands, particularly in the context of ACs, and about the functional diversity of TAM receptors. To study ligand-mediated activation of TAMs, we generated a series of reporter cell lines expressing chimeric TAM receptors. Using this system, we found that each TAM receptor has a unique pattern of interaction with and activation by GAS6 and PROS1, which is also differentially affected by the presence of ACs, PS-containing lipid vesicles and enveloped virus. We also demonstrated that γ-carboxylation of ligands is essential for the full activation of TAMs and that soluble immunoglobulin-like TAM domains act as specific ligand antagonists. These studies demonstrate that, despite their similarity, TYRO3, AXL, and MER are likely to perform distinct functions in both immunoregulation and the recognition and removal of ACs."

The 148-amino acid nsp10 subunit contains two zinc fingers and is known to interact with both nsp14 and nsp16, stimulating their respective 3′-5′ exoribonuclease and 2′-O-methyltransferase activities. Using alanine-scanning mutagenesis, in cellulo bioluminescence resonance energy transfer experiments, and in vitro pulldown assays, we have now identified the key residues on the nsp10 surface that interact with nsp14. The functional consequences of mutations introduced at these positions were first evaluated biochemically by monitoring nsp14 exoribonuclease activity. Disruption of the nsp10-nsp14 interaction abrogated the nsp10-driven activation of the nsp14 exoribonuclease. We further showed that the nsp10 surface interacting with nsp14 overlaps with the surface involved in the nsp10-mediated activation of nsp16 2′-O-methyltransferase activity, suggesting that nsp10 is a major regulator of SARS-CoV replicase function. In line with this notion, reverse genetics experiments supported an essential role of the nsp10 surface that interacts with nsp14 in SARS-CoV replication, as several mutations that abolished the interaction in vitro yielded a replication-negative viral phenotype. In contrast, mutants in which the nsp10-nsp16 interaction was disturbed proved to be crippled but viable. These experiments imply that the nsp10 surface that interacts with nsp14 and nsp16 and possibly other subunits of the viral replication complex may be a target for the development of antiviral compounds against pathogenic coronaviruses.

https://openalex.org/W2085961304,"SIRT2 belongs to a highly conserved family of NAD+-dependent deacylases, consisting of seven members (SIRT1-SIRT7), which vary in subcellular localizations and have substrates ranging from histones to transcription factors and enzymes. Recently SIRT2 was revealed to play an important role in inflammation, directly binding, deacetylating, and inhibiting the p65 subunit of NF-κB.A Sirt2 deficient mouse line (Sirt2-/-) was generated by deleting exons 5-7, encoding part of the SIRT2 deacetylase domain, by homologous recombination. Age- and sex-matched Sirt2-/- and Sirt2+/+ littermate mice were subjected to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and analyzed for colitis susceptibility.Sirt2-/- mice displayed more severe clinical and histological manifestations after DSS colitis compared to wild type littermates. Notably, under basal condition, Sirt2 deficiency does not affect the basal phenotype and intestinal morphology Sirt2 deficiency, however, affects macrophage polarization, creating a pro-inflammatory milieu in the immune cells compartment.These data confirm a protective role for SIRT2 against the development of inflammatory processes, pointing out a potential role for this sirtuin as a suppressor of colitis. In fact, SIRT2 deletion promotes inflammatory responses by increasing NF-κB acetylation and by reducing the M2-associated anti-inflammatory pathway. Finally, we speculate that the activation of SIRT2 may be a potential approach for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease."
https://openalex.org/W2158512646,"Mitochondrial potassium channels have been implicated in myocardial protection mediated through pre-/postconditioning. Compounds that open the Ca2+- and voltage-activated potassium channel of big-conductance (BK) have a pre-conditioning-like effect on survival of cardiomyocytes after ischemia/reperfusion injury. Recently, mitochondrial BK channels (mitoBKs) in cardiomyocytes were implicated as infarct-limiting factors that derive directly from the KCNMA1 gene encoding for canonical BKs usually present at the plasma membrane of cells. However, some studies challenged these cardio-protective roles of mitoBKs. Herein, we present electrophysiological evidence for paxilline- and NS11021-sensitive BK-mediated currents of 190 pS conductance in mitoplasts from wild-type but not BK−/− cardiomyocytes. Transmission electron microscopy of BK−/− ventricular muscles fibres showed normal ultra-structures and matrix dimension, but oxidative phosphorylation capacities at normoxia and upon re-oxygenation after anoxia were significantly attenuated in BK−/− permeabilized cardiomyocytes. In the absence of BK, post-anoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) production from cardiomyocyte mitochondria was elevated indicating that mitoBK fine-tune the oxidative state at hypoxia and re-oxygenation. Because ROS and the capacity of the myocardium for oxidative metabolism are important determinants of cellular survival, we tested BK−/− hearts for their response in an ex-vivo model of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Infarct areas, coronary flow and heart rates were not different between wild-type and BK−/− hearts upon I/R injury in the absence of ischemic pre-conditioning (IP), but differed upon IP. While the area of infarction comprised 28±3% of the area at risk in wild-type, it was increased to 58±5% in BK−/− hearts suggesting that BK mediates the beneficial effects of IP. These findings suggest that cardiac BK channels are important for proper oxidative energy supply of cardiomyocytes at normoxia and upon re-oxygenation after prolonged anoxia and that IP might indeed favor survival of the myocardium upon I/R injury in a BK-dependent mode stemming from both mitochondrial post-anoxic ROS modulation and non-mitochondrial localizations."
https://openalex.org/W2112272591,"The gut microbiota of fish larvae evolves fast towards a complex community. Both host and environment affect the development of the gut microbiota; however, the relative importance of both is poorly understood. Determining specific changes in gut microbial populations in response to a change in an environmental factor is very complicated. Interactions between factors are difficult to separate and any response could be masked due to high inter-individual variation even for individuals that share a common environment. In this study we characterized and quantified the spatio-temporal variation in the gut microbiota of tilapia larvae, reared in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) or active suspension tanks (AS). Our results showed that variation in gut microbiota between replicate tanks was not significantly higher than within tank variation, suggesting that there is no tank effect on water and gut microbiota. However, when individuals were reared in replicate RAS, gut microbiota differed significantly. The highest variation was observed between individuals reared in different types of system (RAS vs. AS). Our data suggest that under experimental conditions in which the roles of deterministic and stochastic factors have not been precisely determined, compositional replication of the microbial communities of an ecosystem is not predictable."
https://openalex.org/W2037419514,"Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes display specific banding pattern; the underlying genetic organization of this pattern has remained elusive for many years. In the present paper, we analyze 32 cytology-mapped polytene chromosome interbands. We estimated molecular locations of these interbands, described their molecular and genetic organization and demonstrate that polytene chromosome interbands contain the 5' ends of housekeeping genes. As a rule, interbands display preferential ""head-to-head"" orientation of genes. They are enriched for ""broad"" class promoters characteristic of housekeeping genes and associate with open chromatin proteins and Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) components. In two regions, 10A and 100B, coding sequences of genes whose 5'-ends reside in interbands map to constantly loosely compacted, early-replicating, so-called ""grey"" bands. Comparison of expression patterns of genes mapping to late-replicating dense bands vs genes whose promoter regions map to interbands shows that the former are generally tissue-specific, whereas the latter are represented by ubiquitously active genes. Analysis of RNA-seq data (modENCODE-FlyBase) indicates that transcripts from interband-mapping genes are present in most tissues and cell lines studied, across most developmental stages and upon various treatment conditions. We developed a special algorithm to computationally process protein localization data generated by the modENCODE project and show that Drosophila genome has about 5700 sites that demonstrate all the features shared by the interbands cytologically mapped to date."
https://openalex.org/W2001032218,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive form of breast cancer resistant to many common treatments. In this study, we compared the effects of 12 phytochemical drugs on four cancer cell lines, and noticed that Cucurbitacin E (CuE) significantly inhibited TNBC cell growth by inducing cell cycle G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis. CuE reduced expression of Cyclin D1, Survivin, XIAP, Bcl2, and Mcl-1 in MDA-MB-468 and SW527, and within MDA-MB-468, CuE significantly increased activation of JNK and inhibited activation of AKT and ERK. Collectively, these results suggest that CuE may be a viable compound for developing novel TNBC therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2066415997,"Ecdysone is the key hormone regulating insect growth and development. Ecdysone synthesis occurs in the prothoracic glands (PGs) and is regulated by several neuropeptides. Four prothoracicotropic and three prothoracicostatic factors have been identified to date, suggesting that ecdysone biosynthesis is intricately regulated. Here, we demonstrate that the neuropeptide pigment dispersing factor (PDF) stimulates ecdysone biosynthesis and that this novel signaling pathway partially overlaps with the prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) signaling pathway. We performed transcriptome analysis and focused on receptors predominantly expressed in the PGs. From this screen, we identified a candidate orphan G protein coupled receptor (GPCR), Bombyx neuropeptide GPCR-B2 (BNGR-B2). BNGR-B2 was predominantly expressed in ecdysteroidogenic tissues, and the expression pattern in the PGs corresponded to the ecdysteroid titer in the hemolymph. Furthermore, we identified PDF as a ligand for BNGR-B2. PDF stimulated ecdysone biosynthesis in the PGs, but the stimulation was only observed in the PGs during a specific larval stage. PDF did not affect the transcript level of known ecdysone biosynthetic enzymes, and inhibiting transcription did not suppress ecdysone biosynthesis, suggesting that the effects of PDF might be mediated by translational regulation and/or post-translational modification. In addition, the participation of protein kinase A (PKA), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), target of rapamycin (TOR) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein (4E-BP) in the PDF signaling pathway was discovered."
https://openalex.org/W2033695651,"Stem rust has become a renewed threat to global wheat production after the emergence and spread of race TTKSK (also known as Ug99) and related races from Africa. To elucidate U.S. winter wheat resistance genes to stem rust, association mapping was conducted using a panel of 137 lines from cooperative U.S. winter wheat nurseries from 2008 and simple sequence repeat (SSR) and sequence tagged site (STS) markers across the wheat genome. Seedling infection types were evaluated in a greenhouse experiment using six U.S. stem rust races (QFCSC, QTHJC, RCRSC, RKQQC, TPMKC and TTTTF) and TTKSK, and adult plant responses to bulked U.S. races were evaluated in a field experiment. A linearization algorithm was used to convert the qualitative Stakman scale seedling infection types for quantitative analysis. Association mapping successfully detected six known stem rust seedling resistance genes in U.S. winter wheat lines with frequencies: Sr6 (12%), Sr24 (9%), Sr31 (15%), Sr36 (9%), Sr38 (19%), and Sr1RSAmigo (8%). Adult plant resistance gene Sr2 was present in 4% of lines. SrTmp was postulated to be present in several hard winter wheat lines, but the frequency could not be accurately determined. Sr38 was the most prevalent Sr gene in both hard and soft winter wheat and was the most effective Sr gene in the adult plant field test. Resistance to TTKSK was associated with nine markers on chromosome 2B that were in linkage disequilibrium and all of the resistance was attributed to the Triticum timopheevii chromosome segment carrying Sr36. Potential novel rust resistance alleles were associated with markers Xwmc326-203 on 3BL, Xgwm160-195 and Xwmc313-225 on 4AL near Sr7, Xgwm495-182 on 4BL, Xwmc622-147 and Xgwm624-146 on 4DL, and Xgwm334-123 on 6AS near Sr8. Xwmc326-203 was associated with adult plant resistance to bulked U.S. races and Xgwm495-182 was associated with seedling resistance to TTKSK."
https://openalex.org/W2056200835,"We look at the possibility of integrating the percepts from multiple non-communicating observers as a means of achieving better joint perception and better group decisions. Our approach involves the combination of a brain-computer interface with human behavioural responses. To test ideas in controlled conditions, we asked observers to perform a simple matching task involving the rapid sequential presentation of pairs of visual patterns and the subsequent decision as whether the two patterns in a pair were the same or different. We recorded the response times of observers as well as a neural feature which predicts incorrect decisions and, thus, indirectly indicates the confidence of the decisions made by the observers. We then built a composite neuro-behavioural feature which optimally combines the two measures. For group decisions, we uses a majority rule and three rules which weigh the decisions of each observer based on response times and our neural and neuro-behavioural features. Results indicate that the integration of behavioural responses and neural features can significantly improve accuracy when compared with the majority rule. An analysis of event-related potentials indicates that substantial differences are present in the proximity of the response for correct and incorrect trials, further corroborating the idea of using hybrids of brain-computer interfaces and traditional strategies for improving decision making."
https://openalex.org/W1990193698,"Background Hepatitis delta frequently leads to liver cirrhosis and hepatic decompensation. As treatment options are limited, there is a need for biomarkers to determine disease activity and to predict the risk of disease progression. We hypothesized that anti-HDV IgM could represent such a marker. Methods Samples of 120 HDV-infected patients recruited in an international multicenter treatment trial (HIDIT-2) were studied. Anti-HDV IgM testing was performed using ETI-DELTA-IGMK-2-assay (DiaSorin). In addition, fifty cytokines, chemokines and angiogenetic factors were measured using multiplex technology (Bio-Plex System). A second independent cohort of 78 patients was studied for the development of liver-related clinical endpoints (decompensation, HCC, liver transplantation or death; median follow up of 3.0 years, range 0.6–12). Results Anti-HDV IgM serum levels were negative in 18 (15%), low (OD<0.5) in 76 (63%), and high in 26 (22%) patients of the HIDIT-2 cohort. Anti-HDV IgM were significantly associated with histological inflammatory (p<0.01) and biochemical disease activity (ALT, AST p<0.01). HDV replication was independent from anti-HDV IgM, however, low HBV-DNA levels were observed in groups with higher anti-HDV IgM levels (p<0.01). While high IP-10 (CXCL10) levels were seen in greater groups of anti-HDV IgM levels, various other antiviral cytokines were negatively associated with anti-HDV IgM. Associations between anti-HDV IgM and ALT, AST, HBV-DNA were confirmed in the independent cohort. Clinical endpoints occurred in 26 anti-HDV IgM positive patients (39%) but in only one anti-HDV IgM negative individual (9%; p = 0.05). Conclusions Serum anti-HDV IgM is a robust, easy-to-apply and relatively cheap marker to determine disease activity in hepatitis delta which has prognostic implications. High anti-HDV IgM levels may indicate an activated interferon system but exhausted antiviral immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2001293002,"Studies in Polar Base stations, where personnel have no access to sunlight during winter, have reported circadian misalignment, free-running of the sleep-wake rhythm, and sleep problems. Here we tested light as a countermeasure to circadian misalignment in personnel of the Concordia Polar Base station during the polar winter. We hypothesized that entrainment of the circadian pacemaker to a 24-h light-dark schedule would not occur in all crew members (n = 10) exposed to 100–300 lux of standard fluorescent white (SW) light during the daytime, and that chronic non-time restricted daytime exposure to melanopsin-optimized blue-enriched white (BE) light would establish an a stable circadian phase, in participants, together with increased cognitive performance and mood levels. The lighting schedule consisted of an alternation between SW lighting (2 weeks), followed by a BE lighting (2 weeks) for a total of 9 weeks. Rest-activity cycles assessed by actigraphy showed a stable rest-activity pattern under both SW and BE light. No difference was found between light conditions on the intra-daily stability, variability and amplitude of activity, as assessed by non-parametric circadian analysis. As hypothesized, a significant delay of about 30 minutes in the onset of melatonin secretion occurred with SW, but not with BE light. BE light significantly enhanced well being and alertness compared to SW light. We propose that the superior efficacy of blue-enriched white light versus standard white light involves melanopsin-based mechanisms in the activation of the non-visual functions studied, and that their responses do not dampen with time (over 9-weeks). This work could lead to practical applications of light exposure in working environment where background light intensity is chronically low to moderate (polar base stations, power plants, space missions, etc.), and may help design lighting strategies to maintain health, productivity, and personnel safety."
https://openalex.org/W2009085606,"Background Arginase competes with nitric oxide synthase for their common substrate L-arginine. Up-regulation of arginase in coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus may reduce nitric oxide bioavailability contributing to endothelial dysfunction and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Arginase inhibition reduces infarct size in animal models. Therefore the aim of the current study was to investigate if arginase inhibition protects from endothelial dysfunction induced by ischemia-reperfusion in patients with CAD with or without type 2 diabetes (Clinical trial registration number: NCT02009527). Methods Male patients with CAD (n = 12) or CAD + type 2 diabetes (n = 12), were included in this cross-over study with blinded evaluation. Endothelium-dependent vasodilatation was assessed by flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the radial artery before and after 20 min ischemia-reperfusion during intra-arterial infusion of the arginase inhibitor (Nω-hydroxy-nor-L-arginine, 0.1 mg/min) or saline. Results The forearm ischemia-reperfusion was well tolerated. Endothelium-independent vasodilatation was assessed by sublingual nitroglycerin. Ischemia-reperfusion decreased FMD in patients with CAD from 12.7±5.2% to 7.9±4.0% during saline administration (P<0.05). Nω-hydroxy-nor-L-arginine administration prevented the decrease in FMD in the CAD group (10.3±4.3% at baseline vs. 11.5±3.6% at reperfusion). Ischemia-reperfusion did not significantly reduce FMD in patients with CAD + type 2 diabetes. However, FMD at reperfusion was higher following nor-NOHA than following saline administration in both groups (P<0.01). Endothelium-independent vasodilatation did not differ between the occasions. Conclusions Inhibition of arginase protects against endothelial dysfunction caused by ischemia-reperfusion in patients with CAD. Arginase inhibition may thereby be a promising therapeutic strategy in the treatment of ischemia-reperfusion injury."
https://openalex.org/W2084087805,"As the incidence of azole resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus is rising and the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in immunocompromised patients is rarely based on positive culture yield, we screened our Aspergillus DNA sample collection for the occurrence of azole resistance mediating cyp51 A key mutations. Using two established, a modified and a novel polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays followed by DNA sequence analysis to detect the most frequent mutations in the A. fumigatus cyp51 A gene conferring azole resistance (TR34 (tandem repeat), L98H and M220 alterations). We analyzed two itraconazole and voriconazole and two multi-azole resistant clinical isolates and screened 181 DNA aliquots derived from clinical samples (blood, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), biopsies, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)) of 155 immunocompromised patients of our Aspergillus DNA sample collection, previously tested positive for Aspergillus DNA and collected between 1995 and 2013. Using a novel PCR assay for the detection of the cyp51 A 46 bp tandem repeat (TR46) directly from clinical samples, we found the alteration in a TR46/Y121F/T289A positive clinical isolate. Fifty stored DNA aliquots from clinical samples were TR46 negative. DNA sequence analysis revealed a single L98H mutation in 2010, two times the L98H alteration combined with TR34 in 2011 and 2012 and a so far unknown N90K mutation in 1998. In addition, four clinical isolates were tested positive for the TR34/L98H combination in the year 2012. We consider our assay of epidemiological relevance to detect A. fumigatus azole resistance in culture-negative clinical samples of immunocompromised patients; a prospective study is ongoing."

Both proteins bound to three of the four proteolytically cleaved fragments of MSP1 (p42, p38, and p83). In addition, MSPDBL1 and MSPDBL2, but not MSP1, bound directly to human erythrocytes.

In vivo Atf3-silencing reversed ethanol-mediated Gck down-regulation and β-cell dysfunction, followed by the amelioration of impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. Together, we identified that ethanol-induced Atf3 fosters β-cell dysfunction via Gck down-regulation and that its loss ameliorates metabolic syndrome and could be a potential therapeutic target in treating type 2 diabetes.

https://openalex.org/W2026652749,"By addressing several key features overlooked in previous studies, i.e. human disturbance, integration of ecosystem- and species-level conservation features, and principles of complementarity and representativeness, we present the first national-scale systematic conservation planning for China to determine the optimized spatial priorities for biodiversity conservation. We compiled a spatial database on the distributions of ecosystem- and species-level conservation features, and modeled a human disturbance index (HDI) by aggregating information using several socioeconomic proxies. We ran Marxan with two scenarios (HDI-ignored and HDI-considered) to investigate the effects of human disturbance, and explored the geographic patterns of the optimized spatial conservation priorities. Compared to when HDI was ignored, the HDI-considered scenario resulted in (1) a marked reduction (∼9%) in the total HDI score and a slight increase (∼7%) in the total area of the portfolio of priority units, (2) a significant increase (∼43%) in the total irreplaceable area and (3) more irreplaceable units being identified in almost all environmental zones and highly-disturbed provinces. Thus the inclusion of human disturbance is essential for cost-effective priority-setting. Attention should be targeted to the areas that are characterized as moderately-disturbed, <2,000 m in altitude, and/or intermediately- to extremely-rugged in terrain to identify potentially important regions for implementing cost-effective conservation. We delineated 23 primary large-scale priority areas that are significant for conserving China's biodiversity, but those isolated priority units in disturbed regions are in more urgent need of conservation actions so as to prevent immediate and severe biodiversity loss. This study presents a spatially optimized national-scale portfolio of conservation priorities – effectively representing the overall biodiversity of China while minimizing conflicts with economic development. Our results offer critical insights for current conservation and strategic land-use planning in China. The approach is transferable and easy to implement by end-users, and applicable for national- and local-scale systematic conservation prioritization practices."
https://openalex.org/W2138452279,"Chronic cocaine exposure in both human addicts and in rodent models of addiction reduces prefrontal cortical activity, which subsequently dysregulates reward processing and higher order executive function. The net effect of this impaired gating of behavior is enhanced vulnerability to relapse. Previously we have shown that cocaine-induced increases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a neuroadaptive mechanism that blunts the reinforcing efficacy of cocaine. As BDNF is known to affect neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity, we tested the hypothesis that abstinence from cocaine self-administration would lead to alterations in neuronal morphology and synaptic density in the PFC. Using a novel technique, array tomography and Golgi staining, morphological changes in the rat PFC were analyzed following 14 days of cocaine self-administration and 7 days of forced abstinence. Our results indicate that overall dendritic branching and total synaptic density are significantly reduced in the rat PFC. In contrast, the density of thin dendritic spines are significantly increased on layer V pyramidal neurons of the PFC. These findings indicate that dynamic structural changes occur during cocaine abstinence that may contribute to the observed hypo-activity of the PFC in cocaine-addicted individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2328512272,"Seabirds, as long-lived top predators, accumulate contaminants such as mercury (Hg), an established endocrine disruptor. In long lived species hormonal secretion varies with age; therefore, Hg-induced endocrine disruption may be exacerbated in some age classes. Here we investigated relationships between blood total Hg and luteinizing hormone (LH, a key pituitary hormone for the onset of breeding), in pre-laying known-age (11–45 years old) snow petrels (Pagodroma nivea) from Adélie Land, Antarctica. We predicted that 1) blood Hg would increase with advancing age as a consequence of bio-accumulation; and that 2) increasing blood Hg would be related to decreased concentrations of LH in the most Hg-contaminated individuals. Hg concentrations were higher in females than in males (p<0.001), and contrary to our prediction, decreased with advancing age in males (p = 0.009) and tended to do so in females (p = 0.06). The analysis of stable isotopes (δ13C and δ15N) suggested that this unexpected pattern could originate from age and sex-related variations in trophic niche, and hence Hg exposure. Regarding LH, our prediction was only supported in young birds (≤23 years) where baseline LH was inversely correlated with Hg concentrations (p = 0.04). Hg burden did not predict baseline LH or GnRH-induced LH in birds that were more than 23 years old. These results show that age and contaminants may interfere with major endocrine mechanisms and, together with other recent studies, support the view that Hg could be connected to LH secretion and could then impair the fitness of long-lived birds."

https://openalex.org/W2034954559,"It is well established that the mechanical environment influences cell functions in health and disease. Here, we address how the mechanical environment influences tumor growth, in particular, the shape of solid tumors. In an in vitro tumor model, which isolates mechanical interactions between tumor cells and a hydrogel, we find that tumors grow as ellipsoids, resembling the same, oft-reported observation of in vivo tumors. Specifically, an oblate ellipsoidal tumor shape robustly occurs when the tumors grow in hydrogels that are stiffer than the tumors, but when they grow in more compliant hydrogels they remain closer to spherical in shape. Using large scale, nonlinear elasticity computations we show that the oblate ellipsoidal shape minimizes the elastic free energy of the tumor-hydrogel system. Having eliminated a number of other candidate explanations, we hypothesize that minimization of the elastic free energy is the reason for predominance of the experimentally observed ellipsoidal shape. This result may hold significance for explaining the shape progression of early solid tumors in vivo and is an important step in understanding the processes underlying solid tumor growth."
https://openalex.org/W2006934911,"The neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a key regulator of neuronal development and plasticity. BDNF is a major pharmaceutical target in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. However, pharmacological modulation of this neurotrophin is challenging because BDNF is generated by multiple, alternatively spliced transcripts with different 5'- and 3'UTRs. Each BDNF mRNA variant is transcribed independently, but translation regulation is unknown. To evaluate the translatability of BDNF transcripts, we developed an in vitro luciferase assay in human neuroblastoma cells. In unstimulated cells, each BDNF 5'- and 3'UTR determined a different basal translation level of the luciferase reporter gene. However, constructs with either a 5'UTR or a 3'UTR alone showed poor translation modulation by BDNF, KCl, dihydroxyphenylglycine, AMPA, NMDA, dopamine, acetylcholine, norepinephrine, or serotonin. Constructs consisting of the luciferase reporter gene flanked by the 5'UTR of one of the most abundant BDNF transcripts in the brain (exons 1, 2c, 4, and 6) and the long 3'UTR responded selectively to stimulation with the different receptor agonists, and only transcripts 2c and 6 were increased by the antidepressants desipramine and mirtazapine. We propose that BDNF mRNA variants represent ""a quantitative code"" for regulated expression of the protein. Thus, to discriminate the efficacy of drugs in stimulating BDNF synthesis, it is appropriate to use variant-specific in vitro screening tests."
https://openalex.org/W2018360110,"Efforts to reduce the negative impacts of roads on wildlife may be hindered if individuals within the population vary widely in their responses to roads and mitigation strategies ignore this variability. This knowledge is particularly important for medium-sized carnivores as they are vulnerable to road mortality, while also known to use available road passages (e.g., drainage culverts) for safely crossing highways. Our goal in this study was to assess whether this apparently contradictory pattern of high road-kill numbers associated with a regular use of road passages is attributable to the variation in behavioral responses toward the highway between individuals. We investigated the responses of seven radio-tracked stone martens (Martes foina) to a highway by measuring their utilization distribution, response turning angles and highway crossing patterns. We compared the observed responses to simulated movement parameterized by the observed space use and movement characteristics of each individual, but naïve to the presence of the highway. Our results suggested that martens demonstrate a diversity of responses to the highway, including attraction, indifference, or avoidance. Martens also varied in their highway crossing patterns, with some crossing repeatedly at the same location (often coincident with highway passages). We suspect that the response variability derives from the individual's familiarity of the landscape, including their awareness of highway passage locations. Because of these variable yet potentially attributable responses, we support the use of exclusionary fencing to guide transient (e.g., dispersers) individuals to existing passages to reduce the road-kill risk."
https://openalex.org/W2003478485,"Background We analyzed the prognostic value of b-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and sensitive cardiac Troponin (s-cTnI) in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) and their significance in predicting stroke aetiology. Methods In a prospectively enrolled cohort we measured BNP and s-cTnI levels upon admission. Primary endpoints were mortality, unfavorable functional outcome and stroke recurrence after 90 days and after 12 months. Secondary endpoint was cardioembolic aetiology. Results In 441 patients BNP but not s-cTnI remained an independent predictor for death with an adjusted HR of 1.2 (95% CI 1.1–1.4) after 90 days and 1.2 (95% CI 1.0–1.3) after one year. The comparison of the Area under Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) of model A (age, NIHSS) and model B (age, NIHSS, BNP) showed an improvement in the prediction of mortality (0.85 (95% CI 0.79–0.90) vs. 0.86 (95% CI 0.81–0.92), Log Rank p = 0.004). Furthermore the category free net reclassification improvement (cfNRI) when adding BNP to the multivariate model was 57.5%, p<0.0001. For the prediction of functional outcome or stroke recurrence both markers provided no incremental value. Adding BNP to a model including age, atrial fibrillation and heart failure lead to a higher discriminatory accuracy for identification of cardioembolic stroke than the model without BNP (AUC 0.75 (95% CI 0.70–0.80) vs. AUC 0.79, (95% CI 0.75–0.84), p = 0.008). Conclusion BNP is an independent prognostic maker for overall mortality in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA and may improve the diagnostic accuracy to identify cardioembolic aetiology.

The tumor microenvironment contains immunosuppressive components, which can be diminished, and immunogenic components, which can be augmented by immunotherapies in order to generate a productive immune response. In the current study, we employ the α-tocopherol succinate isomer of vitamin E to reduce immunosuppression by myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) as well as adoptive transfer of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells to generate potent antitumor effects against the HPV16 E7-expressing TC-1 tumor model. We show that vitamin E alone induces necrosis of TC-1 cells and elicits antitumor effects in TC-1 tumor-bearing mice. We further demonstrate that vitamin E reverses the suppression of T cell activation by MDSCs and that this effect is mediated in part by a nitric oxide-dependent mechanism. Additionally, treatment with vitamin E reduces the percentage of MDSCs in tumor loci, and induces a higher percentage of T cells, following T cell adoptive transfer. Finally, we demonstrate that treatment with vitamin E followed by E7-specific T cell adoptive transfer experience elicits potent antitumor effects in tumor-bearing mice. Our data provide additional evidence that vitamin E has anticancer properties and that it has promise for use as an adjuvant in combination with a variety of cancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2107766188,"Background Different indexes of regional adiposity have been proposed for identifying persons at higher risk of death. Studies specifically assessing these indexes in large cohorts are scarce. It would also be interesting to know whether a dietary intervention may counterbalance the adverse effects of adiposity on mortality. Methods We assessed the association of four different anthropometric indexes (waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI) and height) with all-cause mortality in 7447 participants at high cardiovascular risk from the PREDIMED trial. Forty three percent of them were men (55 to 80 years) and 57% were women (60 to 80 years). All of them were initially free of cardiovascular disease. The recruitment took place in 11 recruiting centers between 2003 and 2009. Results After adjusting for age, sex, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, intervention group, family history of coronary heart disease, and leisure-time physical activity, WC and WHtR were found to be directly associated with a higher mortality after 4.8 years median follow-up. The multivariable-adjusted HRs for mortality of WHtR (cut-off points: 0.60, 0.65, 0.70) were 1.02 (0.78–1.34), 1.30 (0.97–1.75) and 1.55 (1.06–2.26). When we used WC (cut-off points: 100, 105 and 110 cm), the multivariable adjusted Hazard Ratios (HRs) for mortality were 1.18 (0.88–1.59), 1.02 (0.74–1.41) and 1.57 (1.19–2.08). In all analyses, BMI exhibited weaker associations with mortality than WC or WHtR. The direct association between WHtR and overall mortality was consistent within each of the three intervention arms of the trial. Conclusions Our study adds further support to a stronger association of abdominal obesity than BMI with total mortality among elderly subjects at high risk of cardiovascular disease. We did not find evidence to support that the PREDIMED intervention was able to counterbalance the harmful effects of increased adiposity on total mortality.

https://openalex.org/W2066275377,"MicroRNAs are implicated in the response to biotic stresses. Papaya meleira virus (PMeV) is the causal agent of sticky disease, a commercially important pathology in papaya for which there are currently no resistant varieties. PMeV has a number of unusual features, such as residence in the laticifers of infected plants, and the response of the papaya to PMeV infection is not well understood. The protein levels of 20S proteasome subunits increase during PMeV infection, suggesting that proteolysis could be an important aspect of the plant defense response mechanism. To date, 10,598 plant microRNAs have been identified in the Plant miRNAs Database, but only two, miR162 and miR403, are from papaya. In this study, known plant microRNA sequences were used to search for potential microRNAs in the papaya genome. A total of 462 microRNAs, representing 72 microRNA families, were identified. The expression of 11 microRNAs, whose targets are involved in 20S and 26S proteasomal degradation and in other stress response pathways, was compared by real-time PCR in healthy and infected papaya leaf tissue. We found that the expression of miRNAs involved in proteasomal degradation increased in response to very low levels of PMeV titre and decreased as the viral titre increased. In contrast, miRNAs implicated in the plant response to biotic stress decreased their expression at very low level of PMeV and increased at high PMeV levels. Corroborating with this results, analysed target genes for this miRNAs had their expression modulated in a dependent manner. This study represents a comprehensive identification of conserved miRNAs inpapaya. The data presented here might help to complement the available molecular and genomic tools for the study of papaya. The differential expression of some miRNAs and identifying their target genes will be helpful for understanding the regulation and interaction of PMeV and papaya."
https://openalex.org/W1967271835,"The mitochondrial matrix GTPase NOA1 is a nuclear encoded protein, essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis, oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production. Here, we demonstrate that newly translated NOA1 protein is imported into the nucleus, where it localizes to the nucleolus and interacts with UBF1 before nuclear export and import into mitochondria. Mutation of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) prevented both nuclear and mitochondrial import while deletion of the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) or the C-terminal RNA binding domain of NOA1 impaired mitochondrial import. Absence of the MTS resulted in accumulation of NOA1 in the nucleus and increased caspase-dependent apoptosis. We also found that export of NOA1 from the nucleus requires a leptomycin-B sensitive, Crm1-dependent nuclear export signal (NES). Finally, we show that NOA1 is a new substrate of the mitochondrial matrix protease complex ClpXP. Our results uncovered an unexpected, mandatory detour of NOA1 through the nucleolus before uptake into mitochondria. We propose that nucleo-mitochondrial translocation of proteins is more widespread than previously anticipated providing additional means to control protein bioavailability as well as cellular communication between both compartments."
https://openalex.org/W1978187346,"IL-6/STAT3 pathway is involved in a variety of biological responses, including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and inflammation. In our present study, we found that CO releasing molecules (CORMs) suppress IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation and transactivity in endothelial cells (ECs). CO is a byproduct of heme degradation mediated by heme oxygenase (HO-1). However, CORMs can induce HO-1 expression and then inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation. CO has been found to increase a low level ROS and which may induce protein glutathionylation. We hypothesized that CORMs increases protein glutathionylation and inhibits STAT3 activation. We found that CORMs increase the intracellular GSSG level and induce the glutathionylation of multiple proteins including STAT3. GSSG can inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation and increase STAT3 glutathionylation whereas the antioxidant enzyme catalase can suppress the glutathionylation. Furthermore, catalase blocks the inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation by CORMs treatment. The inhibition of glutathione synthesis by BSO was also found to attenuate STAT3 glutathionylation and its inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation. We further found that HO-1 increases STAT3 glutathionylation and that HO-1 siRNA attenuates CORM-induced STAT3 glutathionylation. Hence, the inhibition of STAT3 activation is likely to occur via a CO-mediated increase in the GSSG level, which augments protein glutathionylation, and CO-induced HO-1 expression, which may enhance and maintain its effects in IL-6-treated ECs."

https://openalex.org/W2069762912,"The viral integrase (IN) is an essential protein for HIV-1 replication. IN inserts the viral dsDNA into the host chromosome, thereby aided by the cellular co-factor LEDGF/p75. Recently a new class of integrase inhibitors was described: allosteric IN inhibitors (ALLINIs). Although designed to interfere with the IN-LEDGF/p75 interaction to block HIV DNA integration during the early phase of HIV-1 replication, the major impact was surprisingly found on the process of virus maturation during the late phase, causing a reverse transcription defect upon infection of target cells. Virus particles produced in the presence of an ALLINI are misformed with the ribonucleoprotein located outside the virus core. Virus assembly and maturation are highly orchestrated and regulated processes in which several viral proteins and RNA molecules closely interact. It is therefore of interest to study whether ALLINIs have unpredicted pleiotropic effects on these RNA-related processes. We confirm that the ALLINI BI-D inhibits virus replication and that the produced virus is non-infectious. Furthermore, we show that the wild-type level of HIV-1 genomic RNA is packaged in virions and these genomes are in a dimeric state. The tRNAlys3 primer for reverse transcription was properly placed on this genomic RNA and could be extended ex vivo. In addition, the packaged reverse transcriptase enzyme was fully active when extracted from virions. As the RNA and enzyme components for reverse transcription are properly present in virions produced in the presence of BI-D, the inhibition of reverse transcription is likely to reflect the mislocalization of the components in the aberrant virus particle."

In this study, we compared fungi associated with grass (Poaceae) roots from two ecosystems: the temperate pine barrens in New Jersey, USA and tropical rain forests in Yunnan, China, using the same sampling, isolation and species identification methods. A total of 426 fungal isolates were obtained from 1600 root segments from 80 grass samples. Based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences and morphological characteristics, a total of 85 fungal species (OTUs) belonging in 45 genera, 23 families, 16 orders, and 6 classes were identified, among which the pine barrens had 38 and Yunnan had 56 species, with only 9 species in common. The finding that grass roots in the tropical forests harbor higher fungal species diversity supports that tropical forests are fungal biodiversity hotspots. Sordariomycetes was dominant in both places but more Leotiomycetes were found in the pine barrens than Yunnan, which may play a role in the acidic and oligotrophic pine barrens ecosystem. Equal number of undescribed fungal species were discovered from the two sampled ecosystems, although the tropical Yunnan had more known fungal species. Pine barrens is a unique, unexplored ecosystem. Our finding suggests that sampling plants in such unexplored habitats will uncover novel fungi and that grass roots in pine barrens are one of the major reservoirs of novel fungi with about 47% being undescribed species."
https://openalex.org/W2115587111,"Introduction A significant proportion of patients undergoing salvage radiotherapy (RT) for biochemical recurrence (BCR) following radical prostatectomy (RP) may again experience BCR after salvage RT. Thus, we evaluated the clinical significances of different parameters on the biochemical outcome of RT in salvage setting. Methods We reviewed the records of 212 patients who underwent salvage RT between November 2003 and December 2012 for BCR following primary RP. BCR-free survivals after salvage RT were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to evaluate the impacts of clinicopathologic parameters on BCR following salvage RT. Results The overall median follow-up duration was 63.5 months. The BCR-free survival rate after salvage RT was 58.2% at 5 years. Multivariate analysis showed that a pre-RT prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of ≤0.5 ng/mL, a pre-RT PSA doubling time (PSADT) of >4.5 months, concomitant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with salvage RT, and a positive surgical margin were independent predictors of favorable biochemical outcomes after salvage RT (hazard ratios [HR] = 3.012, 1.132, 2.000, and 1.805, respectively, p = less than 0.001, 0.013, 0.005, and 0.036, respectively). In the early (pre-RT PSA ≤0.5 ng/mL) salvage RT setting, concomitant ADT administration was also shown to be significantly associated with higher risk of BCR-free survival following salvage RT (HR = 2.611, p = 0.038). Conclusion Lower pre-RT PSA value, longer PSADT before salvage RT, concomitant ADT administration, and a positive surgical margin were significant predictors of favorable biochemical outcomes following salvage RT performed for BCR after primary RP."

However, the association between vitamin D and insulin resistance has not been fully studied, especially in the general adolescent population. Therefore, we assessed the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level and insulin resistance among apparently healthy Korean adolescents. Methods A total of 260 (135 male and 125 female) adolescents in a rural high school were assessed for serum 25(OH)D, fasting plasma glucose, and insulin. All of the participants were aged 15 to 16 years old, and without known hypertension or diabetes. Serum 25(OH)D was analyzed both as a continuous and categorical variable in association with insulin resistance. Insulin resistance was estimated by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR). Increased insulin resistance was operationally defined as a HOMA-IR value higher than the sex-specific 75th percentile. Results In male adolescents, every 10 ng/ml decrease in 25(OH)D level was associated with a 0.25 unit increase in HOMA-IR (p = 0.003) after adjusting for age and BMI. Compared to those in the highest quartile, male adolescents in the lowest 25(OH)D quartile were at significantly higher risk for insulin resistance: unadjusted odds ratio 4.06 (95% CI, 1.26 to 13.07); age and BMI adjusted odds ratio 3.59 (95% CI, 1.03 to 12.57). However, 25(OH)D level, either in continuous or categorical measure, was not significantly associated with insulin resistance among female adolescents. Conclusions This study suggests that serum 25(OH)D level may be inversely associated with insulin resistance in healthy male adolescents."

To overcome the dose-limiting toxicity of doxorubicin (DOX), a sulfatide-containing nanoliposome (SCN) encapsulation approach was employed to improve treatment efficacy and reduce side effects of free DOX. This study analysed in vitro characteristics of sulfatide-containing nanoliposomal DOX (SCN-DOX) and assessed its cytotoxicity in vitro, as well as biodistribution, therapeutic efficacy, and systemic toxicity in a human glioblastoma U-118MG xenograft model. SCN-DOX was shown to achieve highest drug to lipid ratio (0.5∶1) and a remarkable in vitro stability. Moreover, DOX encapsulated in SCN was shown to be delivered into the nuclei and displayed prolonged retention over free DOX in U-118MG cells. This simple two-lipid SCN-DOX nanodrug has favourable pharmacokinetic attributes in terms of prolonged circulation time, reduced volume of distribution and enhanced bioavailability in healthy rats. As a result of the improved biodistribution, an enhanced treatment efficacy of SCN-DOX was found in glioma-bearing mice compared to the free drug. Finally, a reduction in the accumulation of DOX in the drug's principal toxicity organs achieved by SCN-DOX led to the diminished systemic toxicity as evident from the plasma biochemical analyses. Thus, SCN has the potential to be an effective and safer nano-carrier for targeted delivery of therapeutic agents to tumors with elevated expression of tenascin-C in their microenvironment."

Drug-selected human lung cancer stem cells: cytokine network, tumorigenic and metastatic properties.PLoS One. 2008; 3: e3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). hESCs depend on extracellular signals to initiate their differentiation, and some cell surface molecules are involved in the interaction of ESCs with extracellular stimulus (2.Gu B. Zhang J. Wang W. Mo L. Zhou Y. Chen L. Liu Y. Zhang M. Global expression of cell surface proteins in embryonic stem cells.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e15795Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A wide range of cell surface markers have been reported to be indicative of undifferentiated hESCs (3.Zhao W. Ji X. Zhang F. Li L. Ma L. Embryonic stem cell markers.Molecules. 2012; 17: 6196-6236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These include carbohydrate-associated molecules such as TRA-1–60 and SSEA-3, cell adhesion molecules such as E-cadherin and CD9, and plasma membrane receptors.

The ability of pluripotency and self-renewal makes stem cells unique and important in physiological and pathological conditions (4.Hombach-Klonisch S. Panigrahi S. Rashedi I. Seifert A. Alberti E. Pocar P. Kurpisz M. Schulze-Osthoff K. Mackiewicz A. Los M. Adult stem cells and their trans-differentiation potential-perspectives and therapeutic applications.J. Mol. Med. 2008; 86: 1301-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that ESCs possess a loose chromatin structure, and most genes in the genome of ESCs are associated with activating epigenetic modifications (2.Gu B. Zhang J. Wang W. Mo L. Zhou Y. Chen L. Liu Y. Zhang M. Global expression of cell surface proteins in embryonic stem cells.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e15795Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Once stem cells have defects in differential potential or proliferative capacity, these mutated self-renewing stem cells may potentially become tumorigenic (3.Zhao W. Ji X. Zhang F. Li L. Ma L. Embryonic stem cell markers.Molecules. 2012; 17: 6196-6236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cancer stem cells are the malignant counterparts of normal adult tissue stem cells, and they are thought to be responsible for cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, recurrence, and drug resistance (5.Tomao F. Papa A. Rossi L. Strudel M. Vici P. Lo Russo G. Tomao S. Emerging role of cancer stem cells in the biology and treatment of ovarian cancer: basic knowledge and therapeutic possibilities for an innovative approach.J. Exp. Clin. Cancer Res. 2013; 32: 48-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Several cell surface hESC markers have been reported to overlap with those of cancer stem cells. TRA-1–60 has originally been raised against human embryonal carcinoma cells, and a previous study showed that the epitope of TRA-1–60 is the sialylated keratan sulfate proteoglycan on podocalyxin (6.Schopperle W.M. DeWolf W.C. The TRA-1–60 and TRA-1–81 human pluripotent stem cell markers are expressed on podocalyxin in embryonal carcinoma.Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). SSEA-3 was shown to be expressed in human teratocarcinoma cells, and its epitope has been identified as globo-series ganglioside (7.Kannagi R. Cochran N.A. Ishigami F. Hakomori S. Andrews P.W. Knowles B.B. Solter D. Stage-specific embryonic antigens (SSEA-3 and -4) are epitopes of a unique globo-series ganglioside isolated from human teratocarcinoma cells.EMBO J. 1983; 2: 2355-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). To discover novel cell surface molecules expressed on hESCs, we generated a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against undifferentiated hESCs using the mouse medial iliac lymph node method and evaluated their ability to mark cancer cells as well as hESCs. In this study, we found that MAb7 strongly recognized not only undifferentiated hESCs but also liver-metastatic pancreatic cancer cells and poorly differentiated gastric cancer cells. Although features of MAb7 epitope were similar with those of TRA-1–60, distribution of MAb7 antigen in cancer cells was different from that of TRA-1–60 antigen. Analyses of MAb7 antigen revealed that the clustered NeuAcα2–3Galβ O-linked oligosaccharides on DMBT1 (deleted in malignant brain tumors 1) were critical for MAb7 binding in cancer cells. In addition, our results suggested that expression of MAb7 epitope in differentiated gastric cancer cells is silenced under epigenetic modification, and MAb7 epitope is involved in the adhesion of metastatic pancreatic cancer cells to endothelial cells. These results raised the possibility that MAb7 epitope is a novel marker for undifferentiated cells such as hESCs and cancer stem-like cells and plays a possible role in the undifferentiated cells. hESCs, KhES-1, were used following the hESC research guidelines of the Japanese government and maintained as previously described (8.Nakano T. Ando S. Takata N. Kawada M. Muguruma K. Sekiguchi K. Saito K. Yonemura S. Eiraku M. Sasai Y. Self-formation of optic cups and storable stratified neural retina from human ESCs.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 10: 771-785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). For neural differentiation of hESCs, the quick serum-free culture of embryoid body-like aggregates (SFEBq) method was used as previously described (9.Watanabe K. Ueno M. Kamiya D. Nishiyama A. Matsumura M. Wataya T. Takahashi J.B. Nishikawa S. Muguruma K. Sasai Y. A ROCK inhibitor permits survival of dissociated human embryonic stem cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). The combination of three-dimensional cell aggregation and cAMP signaling induced the hepatic differentiation of hESCs (10.Ogawa S. Surapisitchat J. Virtanen C. Ogawa M. Niapour M. Sugamori K.S.

Three-dimensional culture and cAMP signaling promote the maturation of human pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocytes.Development. 2013; 140: 3285-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Human cancer cell lines and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were obtained from Health Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan) and maintained in accordance with the supplier's protocol. Primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells were purchased from DS Pharma Biomedical (Osaka, Japan). Human amniotic epithelial cells were purchased from ScienCell Research Laboratories (Carlsbad, CA) and maintained in accordance with the supplier's protocol. Normal human epidermal keratinocytes (Kurabo, Osaka, Japan) and dermal fibroblasts (Clontech) were obtained. FLAG-tagged UDP-N-acetyl-α-d-galactosamine:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1 (GALNT1) and like-glycosyltransferase (LARGE) expression plasmids were obtained by subcloning the entire coding sequence into a pFLAG-CMV-2 expression vector (Sigma-Aldrich). The antibodies TRA-1–60 (Millipore, Danvers, MA), Pax-6 (Covance, Princeton, NJ), DMBT1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), DYKDDDDK tag (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), and control mouse IgM (Biolegend, San Diego, CA) were obtained. Dynabeads rat anti-mouse IgM was purchased from Invitrogen. Neuraminidases, peptide-N-glycanase F (PNGase F), heparinase I, keratanase, chondroitinase ABC, AG-108, and Scriptaid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 3′-O-Acetyl-2′,7′-bis (carboxyethyl)-4 or 5-carboxyfluorescein, diacetoxymethyl ester was purchased from Dojindo (Kumamoto, Japan). Glycan polymers conjugated with polyacrylamide (PAA) were purchased from GlycoTech (Gaithersburg, MD). Mouse anti-hESC monoclonal antibodies were generated based on the mouse medial iliac lymph node method (11.Yokoyama C. Katoh-Fukui Y. Morohashi K. Konno D. Azuma M. Tachibana T. Production and characterization of monoclonal antibodies to mouse germ cells.Hybridoma. 2010; 29: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, the lysates of hESCs were injected to the rear footpads with Freund's complete adjuvant. Two weeks later, cells from the lymph nodes of the immunized mice were fused with mouse myeloma Sp2/0-Ag14 cells at a ratio of 5:1 in 50% polyethylene glycol solution. The resulting hybridoma cells were plated onto 96-well plates and cultured in HAT (hypoxanthine aminopterin thymidine) selection medium. Monoclonal antibodies were purified from the desired hybridoma supernatants (11.Yokoyama C. Katoh-Fukui Y. Morohashi K. Konno D. Azuma M. Tachibana T. Production and characterization of monoclonal antibodies to mouse germ cells.Hybridoma. 2010; 29: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The cancer cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. After blocking, the cells were incubated with primary antibody at 10 μg/ml (12.Hasegawa M. Matsushita Y. Horikawa M. Higashi K. Tomigahara Y. Kaneko H. Shirasaki F. Fujimoto M. Takehara K. Sato S. A novel inhibitor of Smad-dependent transcriptional activation suppresses tissue fibrosis in mouse models of systemic sclerosis.Arthritis Rheum. 2009; 60: 3465-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Localization of antigens was visualized using appropriate secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 594 or 488; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cryosections of SFEBq-cultured hESC aggregates were immunostained with the respective antibodies (9.Watanabe K. Ueno M. Kamiya D. Nishiyama A. Matsumura M. Wataya T. Takahashi J.B. Nishikawa S. Muguruma K. Sasai Y. A ROCK inhibitor permits survival of dissociated human embryonic stem cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). Cancer cells were dissociated to single cells by trypsin/EDTA, incubated with antibodies at 4 °C, and counted and sorted with FACSAria (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The comprehensive gene expression analyses were performed using the GeneChip system as previously described (13.Suzuki N. Ando S. Sumida K. Horie N. Saito K. Analysis of altered gene expression specific to embryotoxic chemical treatment during embryonic stem cell differentiation into myocardiac and neural cells.J. Toxicol. Sci. 2011; 36: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Plus Micro kit (Qiagen), and cDNA for in vitro transcription was prepared from 50 ng of total RNA. Fragmented in vitro transcripts were hybridized overnight onto Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 microarrays, stained, washed, and scanned with an Affimetrix Gene Chip Scanner 3000 7G. The obtained image files were analyzed with the Affimetrix data suite system (Expression Console version 1.1). Expressions of human GALNT1 and LARGE were quantified using MESA Blue qPCR Mastermix (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) as previously described (14.Higashi K. Hasegawa M. Yokoyama C. Tachibana T. Mitsui S. Saito K. Dermokine-β impairs ERK signaling through direct binding to GRP78.FEBS Lett. 2012; 586: 2300-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The PCR primers used were as follows: GALNT1 forward, 5′-ATGACCTATGGTGGGTTCAACT-3′ and reverse, 5′-CTGACAGGAAGAGTCCGATCA-3′; LARGE forward, 5′-TCCGAGCAGTGCTACAGAGA-3′ and reverse, 5′-TTGCGAAAAAACTCCACATG-3′. The relative expression levels were normalized against those of GAPDH gene in the same RNA preparation. Cancer cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. The total amount of DNA in each transfection was kept constant by the addition of appropriate empty vectors. Cells were grown in 96-well plates and then treated with different concentrations of antibody for 1–24 h. Cell proliferation was estimated using a CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay kit (Promega). To examine the effect of antibody on migration of cancer cells, cells were cultured in 6-well plates and grown until reaching a confluent state. The cell layer with antibody was scratched with a sterile tip, washed with culture medium, and then cultured for 1–24 h. At different time points, the distance between the two edges of the scratch was measured. The ability of cancer cells labeled with 3′-O-Acetyl-2′,7′-bis (carboxyethyl)-4 or 5-carboxyfluorescein, diacetoxymethyl ester to adhere to endothelial cells was determined as previously described (15.Dimitroff C.J. Pera P. Dall'Olio F. Matta K.L. Chandrasekaran E.V. Lau J.T. Bernacki R.J. Cell surface N-acetylneuraminic acid α2,3-galactoside-dependent intercellular adhesion of human colon cancer cells.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 105 labeled cancer cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml of antibody for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing, cells were added to confluent endothelial cells and incubated for 1 h, washed three times with PBS(−) to remove nonadhesive cells, and then incubated with 100 μl of Triton X-100 for 2 h at room temperature. The percentage of adherent cells was calculated from the fluorescence intensity. Free O-linked oligosaccharides labeled with Fmoc were prepared from MKN45 cells (16.Yamada K. Hirabayashi J. Kakehi K. Analysis of O-glycans as 9-fluorenylmethyl derivatives and its application to the studies on glycan array.Anal. Chem. 2013; 85: 3325-3333Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Capillary affinity electrophoresis was performed on a P/ACE MDQ Glycoprotein System (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) equipped with a helium-cadmium laser-induced fluorescence detector (excitation, 325 nm; emission, 405 nm) as previously described (17.Yamada K Watanabe S Kita S Kinoshita M Hayakawa T Kakehi K. Determination of Tn antigen released from cultured cancer cells by capillary electrophoresis.Anal. Biochem. 2010; 396: 161-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Briefly, after incubation of labeled O-linked oligosaccharides with antibody for 30 min at room temperature, sample solutions were introduced into the capillary by pressure injection at 1 p.s.i. for 10 s. Separation was performed by applying the potential of 25 kV at 25 °C. Glycan polymers conjugated with PAA were fixed on glass slides in accordance with a method previously described with minor modifications (16.Yamada K. Hirabayashi J. Kakehi K. Analysis of O-glycans as 9-fluorenylmethyl derivatives and its application to the studies on glycan array.Anal. Chem. 2013; 85: 3325-3333Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μg of glycan polymers was dissolved in 20 μl of spotting solution for DNA micro arrays (Matsunami Glass Ind., Ltd., Osaka, Japan), and aliquot was spotted on an epoxy-coated glass slide (Schott AG, Mainz, Germany) with a diameter of ∼1 mm kept for 16 h at room temperature. After incubation, the unreacted epoxy groups were blocked with Tris-HCl buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.8% NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 4% BSA) at room temperature for 1 h. An 80-μl portion of the probing buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.8% NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2) containing 0.8 μg of antibody was applied to the array and was kept at room temperature for 3 h. After removing the antibody solution, the probing buffer containing 10 μg/ml of Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgM antibody (80 μl) was added, and then fluorescent images were acquired using an Ettan DIGE imager (GE Healthcare, Tokyo, Japan). For inhibition assays, 10 μg/ml of antibody was pretreated with monomer or polymer of oligosaccharide as a competitor for 1 h at room temperature, and mixtures were applied to the glycan array. Five milligrams of KP-3L cell lysates were prepared, and immunoprecipitation was performed using MAb7 followed by Dynabeads rat anti-mouse IgM as previously described (18.Higashi K. Tomigahara Y. Shiraki H. Miyata K. Mikami T. Kimura T. Moro T. Inagaki Y. Kaneko H. A novel small compound that promotes nuclear translocation of YB-1 ameliorates experimental hepatic fibrosis in mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 4485-4492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Proteins bound to beads were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and then visualized by silver staining. Desired bands were excised, in-gel-digested with trypsin, and solvent-extracted, and the resulting MS/MS spectra were searched using the MASCOT search engine (18.Higashi K. Tomigahara Y. Shiraki H. Miyata K. Mikami T. Kimura T. Moro T. Inagaki Y. Kaneko H. A novel small compound that promotes nuclear translocation of YB-1 ameliorates experimental hepatic fibrosis in mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 4485-4492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and blocked with 5% skim milk for 30 min at room temperature (19.Evron A. Goldman S. Shalev E. Human amniotic epithelial cells cultured in substitute serum medium maintain their stem cell characteristics for up to four passages.Int. J. Stem Cells. 2011; 4: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). After incubation with primary antibodies, the proteins of interest on immunoblots were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system. Values are expressed as means ± S.D. Student's t test was used to evaluate the statistical significance of differences between groups. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Because cell surface molecules have been used as markers for isolating, purifying, and targeting cancer cells, we first screened numerous hybridoma supernatants by immunofluorescence (data not shown). The monoclonal antibody, referred to herein as MAb7 (mouse IgM), recognized cell surface antigens of the undifferentiated hESCs (Fig. 1A, Undifferentiated). However, MAb7 hardly reacted with mouse embryonic stem cells (data not shown). hESCs are pluripotent and have the capability to generate all the differentiating cells present in the embryo. A previous study demonstrated an efficient culture method for the selective neural differentiation of hESCs using the SFEBq culture (9.Watanabe K. Ueno M. Kamiya D. Nishiyama A. Matsumura M. Wataya T. Takahashi J.B. Nishikawa S. Muguruma K. Sasai Y. A ROCK inhibitor permits survival of dissociated human embryonic stem cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). Cryosections of SFEBq-cultured hESC aggregates were immunostained with MAb7. As shown in Fig. 1A, an intense signal of MAb7 was observed on the periphery of the embryoid body-like aggregates of the undifferentiated hESCs (day 0). The expression level of MAb7 antigen was gradually reduced and had almost disappeared by 7 days after the neural differentiation. In contrast, expression of the neural marker Pax-6 was significantly elevated 7 days after neural differentiation of hESCs (Fig. 1A, Day 7). Expression of TRA-1–60 antigen, one of the most specific markers of undifferentiated hESCs, showed similar localization and a time-dependent alteration with that of MAb7 antigen (Fig. 1B). We next examined the expression levels of MAb7 antigen during hESC differentiation into neural cells by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1C, a diffuse band with molecular mass of >239 kDa was detected in the undifferentiated hESCs, and the amount of MAb7 antigen was decreased in a time-dependent manner. In addition, a time-dependent decrease in MAb7 antigen expression was observed during hESC differentiation into hepatic cells (data not shown). TRA-1–60 antigen, which has higher molecular weight than MAb7 antigen, was also diminished during hESC differentiation into neural cells (Fig. 1C). Conversely, the amount of Pax-6 was obviously increased 7 days after neural differentiation of hESCs. These results suggested that the >239 kDa molecules strongly expressed in the undifferentiated hESCs were MAb7 antigen. We further investigated the expression levels of MAb7 antigen in normal cultured cells. Human amniotic epithelial cells have been reported to retain stem cell characteristics and express stem cell-specific markers (19.Evron A. Goldman S. Shalev E. Human amniotic epithelial cells cultured in substitute serum medium maintain their stem cell characteristics for up to four passages.Int. J. Stem Cells. 2011; 4: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, 5–10% of amniotic epithelial cells expressed MAb7 and TRA-1–60 antigens. In contrast, the expressions MAb7 and TRA-1–60 antigens were not observed in normal human keratinocytes, fibroblasts, or endothelial cells (data not shown). These results suggested that MAb7 marks nontumor undifferentiated cells. We then tested the possibility of using MAb7 antigen as a cancer cell marker. For this purpose, we first screened 20 cancer cell lines by immunofluorescence. As a result, the expression of MAb7 antigen was detected only in pancreatic and gastric cancer cells, whereas its expression was barely observed in cancer cell lines derived from cervix (HeLa), brain (Hs683), breast (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231), lung (HARA, HARA-B, A549), bladder (TCCsup, RT-112), bone (Saos-2), liver (HepG2), prostate (LNCap, PC3), gallbladder (1TKB), colon (HCT-15), connective tissue (HT1080), and skin (A431, G361, A2058) (data not shown). In nonmetastatic pancreatic cancer cell line KP-3, 30% of cells expressed MAb7 antigen in the0 cytoplasm and on the cell surface (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, MAb7 antigen was strongly expressed on the periphery of colonies in liver-metastatic pancreatic cancer cells, KP-3L. In gastric cancer cells, almost all cells expressed MAb7 antigen on the plasma membrane in the poorly differentiated cancer cell line MKN45, whereas none of cells produced MAb7 antigen in the differentiated cell line MKN74 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, some KP-3 and KP-3L cells expressed TRA-1–60 antigen in the cytoplasm and on the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B). Although TRA-1–60 antigen was not detected in MKN74 cells, 50% of MKN45 cells expressed TRA-1–60 antigen on the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B). Expression of MAb7 antigen on the plasma membrane of KP-3L cells was confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig. 2C). Because MAb7 antigen is distributed on the cell surface of cancer cells, we tried to determine its content in the conditioned medium. The same number of cancer cells was seeded, and equal aliquots of culture medium were supplied for Western blotting. At each time point, the number of cancer cells was almost the same (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2D, the secreted MAb7 antigen from KP-3L was remarkably elevated in a time-dependent manner. The MAb7 antigen from KP-3 was detectable only 4 days after the seeding. In contrast, bone-metastatic lung cancer cells HARA-B produced no detectable amounts of MAb7 antigen (Fig. 2D), consistent with the results from immunofluorescence (data not shown). These results suggested that MAb7 antigen distinct from TRA-1–60 antigen is a cell type-specific secreted protein. The results described above led us to identify the MAb7 antigen. The features of MAb7 antigen, the diffused pattern by Western blotting, and the distribution on the plasma membrane shown by immunofluorescence raised the possibility of glycoproteins. To determine whether the MAb7 antigen appears to be associated with N- or O-linked oligosaccharides, we first tested the susceptibility to digestion with PNGase F or mild alkaline hydrolysis. Intriguingly, the MAb7 antigen was completely destroyed by mild alkaline digestion (Fig. 3A). In contrast, PNGase F had no effect on its antigenicity. These results suggested that MAb7 recognizes O-linked oligosaccharides. Thus, we further defined the epitope of MAb7 using enzymes that degrade carbohydrates. As shown in Fig. 3B, treatment of KP-3L lysate with keratanase abrogated the antigenic activity of MAb7, whereas the molecular mass of the antigen was not altered by digestion with heparinase I or chondroitinase ABC. Furthermore, neuraminidase from Arthrobacter ureafaciens (α2–3,6,8,9-specific) efficiently abolished MAb7 binding to the lysate; however, digestion of lysate with other bacterial neuraminidases, Streptococcus pneumoniae (α2–3-specific) and Clostridium perfringens (α2–3,6-specific), had no effect on the MAb7 binding (Fig. 3C). We have shown that the heavily glycosylated O-glycans were abundantly present on the cell surface of MKN45 cells (20.Yamada K. Kinoshita M. Hayakawa T. Nakaya S. Kakehi K. Comparative studies on the structural features of O-glycans between leukemia and epithelial cell line.J. Proteome Res. 2009; 8: 521-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To identify the precise structure of MAb7 epitope, we first examined the effects of MAb7 on the binding to the liberated carbohydrates prepared from MKN45 cells by capillary affinity electrophoresis. Asialo, monosialo, disialo, and trisialo glycans were successfully separated as previously reported (16.Yamada K. Hirabayashi J. Kakehi K. Analysis of O-glycans as 9-fluorenylmethyl derivatives and its application to the studies on glycan array.Anal. Chem. 2013; 85: 3325-3333Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3D, the electrophoresis profiles of control and MAb7 were almost the same. In contrast, the incubation of MAM (Maackia amurensis) lectins recognizing NeuAcα2–3Gal within O-glycans significantly delayed th"
https://openalex.org/W1971022694,"Icosahedral capsids of viruses are lattices of defined geometry and homogeneous size. The (quasi-)equivalent organization of their protein building blocks provides, in numerous systems, the binding sites to assemble arrays of viral polypeptides organized with nanometer precision that protrude from the capsid surface. The capsid of bacterial virus (bacteriophage) SPP1 exposes, at its surface, the 6.6-kDa viral polypeptide gp12 that binds to the center of hexamers of the major capsid protein. Gp12 forms an elongated trimer with collagen-like properties. This is consistent with the fold of eight internal GXY repeats of gp12 to build a stable intersubunit triple helix in a prokaryotic setting. The trimer dissociates and unfolds at near physiological temperatures, as reported for eukaryotic collagen. Its structural organization is reacquired within seconds upon cooling. Interaction with the SPP1 capsid hexamers strongly stabilizes gp12, increasing its Tm to 54 °C. Above this temperature, gp12 dissociates from its binding sites and unfolds reversibly. Multivalent binding of gp12 trimers to the capsid is highly cooperative. The capsid lattice also provides a platform to assist folding and association of unfolded gp12 polypeptides. The original physicochemical properties of gp12 offer a thermoswitchable system for multivalent binding of the polypeptide to the SPP1 capsid surface."
https://openalex.org/W1999534365,"Risk heightens motivation and, if used appropriately, may have the potential to improve engagement in the classroom. We have developed a risk-based learning game for school pupils in order to test whether such learning games can improve later recall of information. The study was performed during a series of public engagement workshops delivered by undergraduate students. Undergraduate neuroscience students delivered 90-minute science workshops to 9–10 year old school pupils (n = 448) that were divided into ‘Risk’, ‘No risk’ and ‘Control’ classes. ‘Risk’ classes received periodic multiple-choice questions (MCQs) during the workshops which required small teams of pupils to assign tokens to the answer(s) they believed to be correct. Tokens assigned to the correct answer were returned to the group and an equal number given back as a prize; tokens assigned to incorrect answers were lost. Participation was incentivised by the promise of a brain-related prize to the team with the most tokens at the end of the workshop. ‘No risk’ classes received MCQs without the risk component whilst the ‘Control’ classes received no MCQs. When presented with a neuroscience quiz based on workshop content at the end of the workshop, pupils in the ‘Risk’ classes exhibited significantly greater recall of information one week later. Quiz scores were higher than scores from the day of the workshop which suggested pupils may have discussed the workshop content outside of the classroom, thereby increasing knowledge over and above what was learned during the workshop. This is supported by feedback from pupils in ‘Risk’ classes which indicated that ‘Risk’ workshops were more interesting than ‘No risk’ and ‘Control’ workshops. These data suggest that there is a role for risk in the classroom but further investigations are required to elucidate the causal mechanisms of improved retention of information."
https://openalex.org/W2109228982,"The provision of healthcare in rural African communities is a highly complex and largely unsolved problem. Two main difficulties are the identification of individuals that are most likely affected by disease and the prediction of responses to health interventions. Social networks have been shown to capture health outcomes in a variety of contexts. Yet, it is an open question as to what extent social network analysis can identify and distinguish among households that are most likely to report poor health and those most likely to respond to positive behavioural influences. We use data from seven highly remote, post-conflict villages in Liberia and compare two prominent network measures: in-degree and betweenness. We define in-degree as the frequency in which members from one household are named by another household as a friends. Betweenness is defined as the proportion of shortest friendship paths between any two households in a network that traverses a particular household. We find that in-degree explains the number of ill family members, whereas betweenness explains engagement in preventative health. In-degree and betweenness independently explained self-reported health and behaviour, respectively. Further, we find that betweenness predicts susceptibility to, instead of influence over, good health behaviours. The results suggest that targeting households based on network measures rather than health status may be effective for promoting the uptake of health interventions in rural poor villages."
https://openalex.org/W2120163993,"Hakai, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, disrupts cell-cell contacts in epithelial cells and is up-regulated in human colon and gastric adenocarcinomas. Hakai acts through its phosphotyrosine-binding (HYB) domain, which bears a dimeric fold that recognizes the phosphotyrosine motifs of E-cadherin, cortactin, DOK1, and other Src substrates. Unlike the monomeric nature of the SH2 and phosphotyrosine-binding domains, the architecture of the HYB domain consists of an atypical, zinc-coordinated tight homodimer. Here, we report a C-terminal truncation mutant of the HYB domain (HYB(ΔC)), comprising amino acids 106-194, which exists as a monomer in solution. The NMR structure revealed that this deletion mutant undergoes a dramatic structural change caused by a rearrangement of the atypical zinc-coordinated unit in the C terminus of the HYB domain to a C2H2-like zinc finger in HYB(ΔC). Moreover, using isothermal titration calorimetry, we show that dimerization of HYB(ΔC) can be induced using a phosphotyrosine substrate peptide. This ligand-induced dimerization of HYB(ΔC) is further validated using analytical ultracentrifugation, size-exclusion chromatography, NMR relaxation studies, dynamic light scattering, and circular dichroism experiments. Overall, these observations suggest that the dimeric architecture of the HYB domain is essential for the phosphotyrosine-binding property of Hakai."
https://openalex.org/W2088271914,"Oxysterol sulfation plays an important role in regulation of lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses. In the present study, we report the discovery of a novel regulatory sulfated oxysterol in nuclei of primary rat hepatocytes after overexpression of the gene encoding mitochondrial cholesterol delivery protein (StarD1). Forty-eight hours after infection of the hepatocytes with recombinant StarD1 adenovirus, a water-soluble oxysterol product was isolated and purified by chemical extraction and reverse-phase HPLC. Tandem mass spectrometry analysis identified the oxysterol as 5-cholesten-3β, 25-diol, disulfate (25HCDS), and confirmed the structure by comparing with a chemically synthesized compound. Administration of 25HCDS to human THP-1-derived macrophages or HepG2 cells significantly inhibited cholesterol synthesis and markedly decreased lipid levels in vivo in NAFLD mouse models. RT-PCR showed that 25HCDS significantly decreased SREBP-1/2 activities by suppressing expression of their responding genes, including ACC, FAS, and HMG-CoA reductase. Analysis of lipid profiles in the liver tissues showed that administration of 25HCDS significantly decreased cholesterol, free fatty acids, and triglycerides by 30, 25, and 20%, respectively. The results suggest that 25HCDS inhibits lipid biosynthesis via blocking SREBP signaling. We conclude that 25HCDS is a potent regulator of lipid metabolism and propose its biosynthetic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2155112671,"To investigate the differences in gene expression between children and adults with Kashin-Beck disease (KBD).12 children with KBD and 12 healthy children were selected and divided into 4 KBD vs. control pairs matched according to age and gender, with each pair having 3 KBD children and 3 healthy children. Additionally, 15 adults with KBD and 15 healthy adults were selected and divided into 5 KBD vs. control pairs matched according to age and gender, with each pair having 3 KBD adults and 3 healthy adults. Total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) respectively. A total of 367 target genes were selected based on previous genome-wide gene expression profile analysis. Expression levels of the 367 genes were evaluated by customized oligonucleotide microarray and the differentially expressed genes were identified. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was conducted to validate the microarray data.A total of 95 (25.9%) genes in KBD children and 158 (43.1%) genes in KBD adults were found to exhibit more than two-fold change in gene expression level relative to healthy controls. By comparing differentially expressed genes identified in KBD children to those of KBD adults, 42 genes were found to be differentially expressed only in KBD children. And 105 genes were found to be differentially expressed only in KBD adults. Further, 16 differentially expressed genes common to both KBD children and adults were found to be asynchronously expressed in KBD children compared to KBD adults.Significant differences in gene expression pattern were identified between KBD children and KBD adults, indicating different molecular mechanisms underlying cartilage lesions of KBD children and KBD adults. In addition, bone development-related genes GDF5 (expression ratio = 2.14±0.02) and DIO2 (expression ratio = 0.11±0.05) may contribute to the development of KBD in children rather than in adults."
https://openalex.org/W1970740836,"There is an established role for the endocytic pathway in regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling to downstream effectors. However, because ligand-mediated EGFR endocytosis utilizes multiple ""moving parts,"" dissecting the spatial versus temporal contributions has been challenging. Blocking all endocytic trafficking can have unintended effects on other receptors as well as give rise to compensatory mechanisms, both of which impact interpretation of EGFR signaling. To overcome these limitations, we used epidermal growth factor (EGF) conjugated to polystyrene beads (EGF beads). EGF beads simultaneously activate the EGFR while blocking its endocytosis and allow analysis of EGFR signaling from the plasma membrane. Human telomerase immortalized corneal epithelial (hTCEpi) cells were used to model normal epithelial cell biology. In hTCEpi cells, both cell surface and intracellular EGFRs exhibited dose-dependent increases in effector activity after 15 min of ligand stimulation, but only the serine phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was statistically significant when accounting for receptor phosphorylation. However, over time with physiological levels of receptor phosphorylation, cell surface receptors produced either enhanced or sustained mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (c-Cbl), and the pro-oncogene Src activity. These increases in effector communication by cell surface receptors resulted in an increase in EGFR ubiquitylation with sustained ligand incubation. Together, these data indicate that spatial regulation of EGFR signaling may be an important regulatory mechanism in receptor down-regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1998716948,"Pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses cause considerable morbidity and mortality in the general human population. Protection from severe disease may result from vaccines that activate antigen-presenting DC for effective stimulation of influenza-specific memory T cells. Special attention is paid to vaccine-induced CD8+ T-cell responses, because they are mainly directed against conserved internal influenza proteins thereby presumably mediating cross-protection against circulating seasonal as well as emerging pandemic virus strains. Our study showed that influenza whole virus vaccines of major seasonal A and B strains activated DC more efficiently than those of pandemic swine-origin H1N1 and pandemic-like avian H5N1 strains. In contrast, influenza split virus vaccines had a low ability to activate DC, regardless which strain was investigated. We also observed that whole virus vaccines stimulated virus-specific CD8+ memory T cells much stronger compared to split virus counterparts, whereas both vaccine formats activated CD4+ Th cell responses similarly. Moreover, our data showed that whole virus vaccine material is delivered into the cytosolic pathway of DC for effective activation of virus-specific CD8+ T cells. We conclude that vaccines against seasonal and pandemic (-like) influenza strains that aim to stimulate cross-reacting CD8+ T cells should include whole virus rather than split virus formulations."
https://openalex.org/W2066315990,"Adelphophagy, development where embryos grow large by consuming morphologically distinct nutritive embryos or their own normal siblings is widespread but uncommon among animal phyla. Among invertebrates it is particularly common in some families of marine gastropods and segmented worms, but rare or unknown in other closely related families. In calyptraeid gastropods phylogenetic analysis indicates that adelphophagy has arisen at least 9 times from species with planktotrophic larval development. This pattern of frequent parallel evolution of adelphophagy suggests that the embryos of planktotrophic species might be predisposed to evolve adelphophagy. Here we used embryos of three species of planktotrophic calyptraeids, one from each of three major genera in the family (Bostrycapulus, Crucibulum, and Crepidula), to answer the following 3 questions: (1) Can embryos of species with planktotrophic development benefit, in terms of pre-hatching growth, from the ingestion of yolk and tissue from experimentally damaged siblings? (2) Does ingestion of this material from damaged siblings increase variation in pre-hatching size? and (3) Does this experimentally induced adelphophagy alter the allometry between the velum and the shell, increasing morphological similarity to embryos of normally adelphophagic species? We found an overall increase in shell length and velum diameter when embryos feed on damaged siblings within their capsules. There was no detectable increase in variation in shell length or velum diameter, or changes in allometry. The overall effect of our treatment was small compared to the embryonic growth observed in naturally adelphophagic development. However each embryo in our experiment probably consumed less than one sibling on average, whereas natural adelphophages often each consume 10–30 or more siblings. These results suggest that the ability to consume, assimilate, and benefit from yolk and tissue of their siblings is widespread across calyptraeids."
https://openalex.org/W1976217935,"We recently reported a reciprocal relationship between tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and insulin-like receptor growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) in whole retina of normal and IGFBP-3 knockout mice. A similar relationship was also observed in cultured retinal endothelial cells (REC). We found that TNFα significantly reduced IGFBP-3 levels and vice-versa, IGFBP-3 can lower TNFα and TNFα receptor expression. Since IGFBP-3 is protective to the diabetic retina and TNFα is causative in the development of diabetic retinopathy, we wanted to better understand the cellular mechanisms by which TNFα can reduce IGFBP-3 levels. For these studies, primary human retinal endothelial cells (REC) were used since these cells undergo TNFα-mediated apoptosis under conditions of high glucose conditions and contribute to diabetic retinopathy. We first cultured REC in normal or high glucose, treated with exogenous TNFα, then measured changes in potential signaling pathways, with a focus on P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase alpha (P38α) and casein kinase 2 (CK2) as these pathways have been linked to both TNFα and IGFBP-3. We found that TNFα significantly increased phosphorylation of P38α and CK2. Furthermore, specific inhibitors of P38α or CK2 blocked TNFα inhibition of IGFBP-3 expression, demonstrating that TNFα reduces IGFBP-3 through activation of P38α and CK2. Since TNFα and IGFBP-3 are key mediators of retinal damage and protection respectively in diabetic retinopathy, increased understanding of the relationship between these two proteins will offer new therapeutic options for treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2035120577,"Melanoma is recognized as one of the most aggressive cancers with a relatively high propensity for metastasis. The prognosis of melanoma remains poor in spite of treatment advances, emphasizing the importance of additional preventive measures. Isoflavonoids have become not only potential chemopreventive, but also important therapeutic natural agents. We evaluated the antiproliferative and proapoptotic properties of biotransformed soybean extract (BSE) in A375 melanoma cells. Previous analyses demonstrated that the concentration of daidzein, genistein and aminoacids/peptides present in BSE, fermented by Aspergillus awamori is much higher than in the non biotransformed extract (NBSE). Experiments comparing the efficacy of the extracts in preventing cancer cell growth showed that treatment (24 h) of aggressive melanoma cells (A375 and 451Lu) with BSE resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of growth and viability. In contrast, treatment with similar doses of NBSE failed to inhibit melanoma cell viability. Further studies in A375 cells showed that decrease in cell viability with BSE treatment (1.5–1.9 mg/ml; 24 h) was associated with induction of apoptosis. Immunoblot analysis revealed that BSE treatment resulted in induction of PARP cleavage, activation of caspase-3, -7, and -8 and increased expression of TRAIL and its receptor DR4. BSE did not activate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in A375 cells, as no change was observed in caspase-9 expression. The expression of Bcl-2 apoptotic proteins such as Bid and Bax remained unaffected with BSE treated cells. Interestingly, we also showed that BSE treatment increased the phosphorylation and activation of IKK, IκBα degradation and p65/NF-κB translocation to the nucleus, and that stimulation of the NF-???B pathway was required for BSE-induced apoptosis of A375 cells. Our findings indicate that the biotransformation of soybean plays a crucial role in the extract anti-cancer effect observed in melanoma cells. However, further studies are warranted to define the active anti-cancer agent(s) present in BSE."
https://openalex.org/W2058898739,"Hif1p is an H3/H4-specific histone chaperone that associates with the nuclear form of the Hat1p/Hat2p complex (NuB4 complex) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. While not capable of depositing histones onto DNA on its own, Hif1p can act in conjunction with a yeast cytosolic extract to assemble nucleosomes onto a relaxed circular plasmid.To identify the factor(s) that function with Hif1p to carry out chromatin assembly, multiple steps of column chromatography were carried out to fractionate the yeast cytosolic extract. Analysis of partially purified fractions indicated that Hif1p-dependent chromatin assembly activity resided in RNA rather than protein. Fractionation of isolated RNA indicated that the chromatin assembly activity did not simply purify with bulk RNA. In addition, the RNA-mediated chromatin assembly activity was blocked by mutations in the human homolog of Hif1p, sNASP, that prevent the association of this histone chaperone with histone H3 and H4 without altering its electrostatic properties.These results suggest that specific RNA species may function in concert with histone chaperones to assemble chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W2066825395,"Extrapolating landscape regression models for use in assessing vector-borne disease risk and other applications requires thoughtful evaluation of fundamental model choice issues. To examine implications of such choices, an analysis was conducted to explore the extent to which disparate landscape models agree in their epidemiological and entomological risk predictions when extrapolated to new regions. Agreement between six literature-drawn landscape models was examined by comparing predicted county-level distributions of either Lyme disease or Ixodes scapularis vector using Spearman ranked correlation. AUC analyses and multinomial logistic regression were used to assess the ability of these extrapolated landscape models to predict observed national data. Three models based on measures of vegetation, habitat patch characteristics, and herbaceous landcover emerged as effective predictors of observed disease and vector distribution. An ensemble model containing these three models improved precision and predictive ability over individual models. A priori assessment of qualitative model characteristics effectively identified models that subsequently emerged as better predictors in quantitative analysis. Both a methodology for quantitative model comparison and a checklist for qualitative assessment of candidate models for extrapolation are provided; both tools aim to improve collaboration between those producing models and those interested in applying them to new areas and research questions."
https://openalex.org/W2119237156,"Regulated proteolysis mediated by the ubiquitin proteasome system is a fundamental and essential feature of the eukaryotic cell division cycle. Most proteins with cell cycle-regulated stability are targeted for degradation by one of two related ubiquitin ligases, the Skp1-cullin-F box protein (SCF) complex or the anaphase-promoting complex (APC). Here we describe an unconventional cell cycle-regulated proteolytic mechanism that acts on the Acm1 protein, an inhibitor of the APC activator Cdh1 in budding yeast. Although Acm1 can be recognized as a substrate by the Cdc20-activated APC (APCCdc20) in anaphase, APCCdc20 is neither necessary nor sufficient for complete Acm1 degradation at the end of mitosis. An APC-independent, but 26S proteasome-dependent, mechanism is sufficient for complete Acm1 clearance from late mitotic and G1 cells. Surprisingly, this mechanism appears distinct from the canonical ubiquitin targeting pathway, exhibiting several features of ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation. For example, Acm1 degradation in G1 requires neither lysine residues in Acm1 nor assembly of polyubiquitin chains. Acm1 was stabilized though by conditional inactivation of the ubiquitin activating enzyme Uba1, implying some requirement for the ubiquitin pathway, either direct or indirect. We identified an amino terminal predicted disordered region in Acm1 that contributes to its proteolysis in G1. Although ubiquitin-independent proteasome substrates have been described, Acm1 appears unique in that its sensitivity to this mechanism is strictly cell cycle-regulated via cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) phosphorylation. As a result, Acm1 expression is limited to the cell cycle window in which Cdk is active. We provide evidence that failure to eliminate Acm1 impairs activation of APCCdh1 at mitotic exit, justifying its strict regulation by cell cycle-dependent transcription and proteolytic mechanisms. Importantly, our results reveal that strict cell-cycle expression profiles can be established independent of proteolysis mediated by the APC and SCF enzymes."
