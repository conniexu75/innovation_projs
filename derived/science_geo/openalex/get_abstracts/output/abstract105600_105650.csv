https://openalex.org/W1978014671,"We have used affinity panning of libraries of bacteriophages that display random octapeptide or dodecapeptide sequences at the N-terminus of the adsorption protein (pIII) to characterize peptides that bind to the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP and to develop a scoring system that predicts potential BiP-binding sequences in naturally occurring polypeptides. BiP preferentially binds peptides containing a subset of aromatic and hydrophobic amino acids in alternating positions, suggesting that peptides bind in an extended conformation, with the side chains of alternating residues pointing into a cleft on the BiP molecule. Synthetic peptides with sequences corresponding to those displayed by BiP-binding bacteriophages bind to BiP and stimulate its ATPase activity, with a half-maximal concentration in the range 10-60 microM."
https://openalex.org/W1967804600,"A change in the probability of neurotransmitter release (Pr) is an important mechanism underlying synaptic plasticity. Although Pr is often assumed to be the same for all terminals at a single synapse, this assumption is difficult to reconcile with the nonuniform size and structure of synaptic terminals in the central nervous system. Release probability was measured at excitatory synapses on cultured hippocampal neurons by analysis of the progressive block of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated synaptic currents by the irreversible open channel blocker MK-801. Release probability was nonuniform (range of 0.09 to 0.54) for terminals arising from a single axon, the majority of which had a low Pr. However, terminals with high Pr are more likely to be affected by the activity-dependent modulation that occurs in long-term potentiation."

https://openalex.org/W1604013791,"We have recently identified several naturally occurring variants of the human beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta 2AR). One of these polymorphisms, which is relatively uncommon, is a mutation occurring in the fourth transmembrane spanning domain, with Ile substituted for Thr at amino acid 164 within the proposed ligand binding pocket. This mutation is adjacent to Ser165 which has been predicted to interact with the beta-carbon hydroxyl group of adrenergic ligands. To determine the functional significance of this variant, we constructed by site-directed techniques a mutated beta 2AR (Ile164) with this substitution and expressed it in CHW-1102 cells. In the presence of guanine nucleotide, Ile164 displayed a lower binding affinity for epinephrine as compared with the wild-type beta 2AR (Ki = 1450 +/- 79 versus 368 +/- 39 nM; p < 0.001). A similarly decreased affinity was found with the catecholamines isoproterenol and norepinephrine, but not with dobutamine or dopamine which lack hydroxyl groups on their beta-carbons. In addition, antagonists without aromatic ring polar substituents displayed a decreased affinity for the mutated receptor. In agonist competition experiments conducted in the absence of guanine nucleotide, Ile164 failed to exhibit detectable high affinity binding, suggesting an impairment in the formation of the agonist-receptor-Gs complex. Consistent with this finding, functional coupling to Gs as determined in adenylyl cyclase assays was significantly (approximately 50%) depressed with Ile164 under both basal and agonist-stimulated conditions. beta 2AR sequestration, which is also triggered by agonist binding, was also found to be approximately 65% reduced in the Ile164 polymorphism. This study represents the first characterization of a naturally occurring mutation of a human adrenergic receptor. Our findings generally support the hypothesized role of this region of the receptor for ligand binding and receptor activation, as well as for establishing critical interactions for overall receptor conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1572887479,"The role of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) in regulating fatty acid oxidation was investigated in isolated fatty acid perfused working rat hearts. Overall fatty acid oxidation rates were determined by addition of 1.2 mM [3H]palmitate to the perfusate of hearts in which the endogenous triglyceride pool was prelabeled with [14C]palmitate. Rates of both exogenous and endogenous fatty acid oxidation were measured by simultaneous measurement of 3H2O and 14CO2 production, respectively. A second series of hearts were perfused under similar conditions except that [U-14C]glucose was present in the perfusate for measurement of glucose oxidation rates. Addition of dichloroacetate (DCA, 1 mM) to the perfusate resulted in a dramatic stimulation of glucose oxidation (a 411% increase), with a parallel decrease in fatty acid oxidation (from 305 +/- 51 to 206 +/- 40 nmol/g dry weight.min.unit work). DCA treatment increased the contribution of glucose oxidation to ATP production from 7.1 to 30.6%, while decreasing the contribution of overall fatty acid oxidation from 92.9 to 69.4%. Tissue levels of malonyl-CoA in hearts treated with DCA were higher compared to controls (14.0 +/- 0.6 and 10.0 +/- 0.7 nmol/g dry weight, respectively) and were negatively correlated (r = -0.85) with overall fatty acid oxidation rates. Acetyl-CoA levels were also significantly higher in DCA-treated hearts, and a positive correlation (r = 0.88) was seen between myocardial acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA levels. This suggests that DCA treatment increased the supply of acetyl-CoA for ACC. Western blots revealed the presence of both the 280-kDa (ACC-280) and the 265-kDa (ACC-265) isoforms of ACC in cardiac tissue, with a predominance of ACC-280. The activity of ACC extracted from hearts was similar in both groups when assayed under optimal conditions of acetyl-CoA and citrate. However, using affinity purified ACC, it was demonstrated that heart ACC (predominantly ACC-280) had a higher Km for acetyl-CoA than ACC isolated from white adipose tissue (predominantly ACC-265). We conclude that ACC is an important regulator of fatty acid oxidation in the heart and that acetyl-CoA supply is a key determinant of heart ACC-280 activity. As acetyl-CoA levels increase, ACC-280 is activated resulting in an increase in malonyl-CoA inhibition of fatty acid oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W2032255062,"N-type calcium channels play a dominant role in controlling synaptic transmission in many peripheral neurons. Transmitter release from mammalian central nerve terminals, however, is relatively resistant to the N channel antagonist ω-conotoxin GVIA. We studied the sensitivity of glutamatergic synaptic transmission in rat hippocampal slices to ω-conotoxin and to ω-Aga-IVA, a P channel antagonist. Both toxins reduced the amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic potentials in CA1 pyramidal neurons, but ω-Aga-IVA was the more rapid and efficacious. These results were corroborated by biochemical studies measuring subsecond, calcium-dependent [3H]glutamate release from hippocampal synaptosomes. Thus, at least two calcium channel types trigger glutamate release from hippocampal neurons, but P-type plays a more prominent role. Eliminating synaptic transmission in the CNS, therefore, may require inhibiting more than a single calcium channel type."
https://openalex.org/W1546743612,"H-Ras, the protein product of the cellular homologue of the Harvey ras oncogene, undergoes a complex series of post-translational modifications that include C-terminal isoprenylation, proteolysis, methylation, and palmitoylation. Palmitoylation has been shown to enhance the transformation efficiency of H-Ras about 10-fold in vivo. A recent study (Magee, A. I., Gutierrez, L., McKay, I. A., Marshall, C. J., and Hall, A. (1987) EMBO J. 6, 3353-3357) has provided strong evidence that the palmitate undergoes a dynamic acylation-deacylation cycle, but details concerning the enzymology of this process and its regulation are lacking. To begin to dissect this event, we have developed an assay for the enzymatic removal of palmitate from [3H]palmitate-labeled H-Ras. This substrate was produced in a baculovirus expression system and was used to purify to homogeneity a novel 37-kDa enzyme from bovine brain cytosol that removes the radiolabeled palmitate. The purified enzyme is sensitive to diethyl pyrocarbonate and insensitive to phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and N-ethylmaleimide. Interestingly, the thioesterase recognizes H-Ras as a substrate only when H-Ras is in its native conformation (bound to Mg2+ and guanine nucleotide). The palmitoylated alpha subunits of the heterotrimeric G proteins are also substrates for the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1975923899,"Synapsin I, the major phosphoprotein of synaptic vesicles, is thought to play a central role in neurotransmitter release. Here we introduce a null mutation into the murine synapsin I gene by homologous recombination. Mice with no detectable synapsin I manifest no apparent changes in well-being or gross nervous system function. Thus, synapsin I is not essential for neurotransmitter release. Electrophysiology reveals that mice lacking synapsin I exhibit a selective increase in paired pulse facilitation, with no major alterations in other synaptic parameters such as long-term potentiation. In addition to potential redundant functions shared with other proteins, synapsin I in normal mice may function to limit increases in neurotransmitter release elicited by residual Ca2+ after an initial stimulus."

https://openalex.org/W1608154971,"P-glycoprotein, the multidrug transporter, is proposed to act as an ATP-driven drug efflux pump. We previously reported the partial purification of P-glycoprotein from multidrug-resistant cells (Doige, C. A., Yu, X., and Sharom, F. J. (1992) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1109, 149-160). We now report the reconstitution of this preparation into phospholipid bilayers using rapid detergent removal by gel filtration chromatography. The resulting proteoliposomes displayed ATP-dependent [3H]colchicine uptake over a time period of 0-4 min. No drug uptake was observed for liposomes of lipid alone, or liposomes reconstituted with a similar extract from drug-sensitive cells. Drug uptake was osmotically sensitive, and abolished by detergent permeabilization, indicating that it represented true transport into the vesicle lumen. Steady-state levels of drug uptake increased with drug concentration, approaching saturation at approximately 150 microM colchicine, with half-maximal accumulation at 50 microM. Drug was accumulated actively against a 5.6-fold concentration gradient. Multidrug resistance spectrum drugs and chemosensitizers inhibited colchicine uptake by P-glycoprotein proteoliposomes, whereas cytosine arabinoside and methotrexate had no effect. Reconstituted liposomes showed high levels of ATPase activity, which was stimulated over 2-fold by verapamil and trifluoperazine. These results suggest that P-glycoprotein functions as an active drug transporter with constitutive ATPase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2059893091,"The assembly of different types of virulence-associated surface fibers called pili in Gram-negative bacteria requires periplasmic chaperones. PapD is the prototype member of the periplasmic chaperone family, and the structural basis of its interactions with pilus subunits was investigated. Peptides corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of pilus subunits bound PapD and blocked the ability of PapD to bind to the pilus adhesin PapG in vitro. The crystal structure of PapD complexed to the PapG carboxyl-terminal peptide was determined to 3.0 A resolution. The peptide bound in an extended conformation with its carboxyl terminus anchored in the interdomain cleft of the chaperone via hydrogen bonds to invariant chaperone residues Arg8 and Lys112. Main chain hydrogen bonds and contacts between hydrophobic residues in the peptide and the chaperone stabilized the complex and may play a role in determining binding specificity. Site-directed mutations in Arg8 and Lys112 abolished the ability of PapD to bind pilus subunits and mediate pilus assembly in vivo, an indication that the PapD-peptide crystal structure is a reflection of at least part of the PapD-subunit interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2065965042,"Influx of Ca2+ through the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptor is widely accepted as a trigger for many forms of neural plasticity. However, direct support for this model has been elusive, since indirect activation of dendritic voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels is difficult to exclude. We have optically measured synaptically induced changes in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration in pyramidal cell dendrites in hippocampal slices. Steady postsynaptic depolarization to the synaptic reversal potential eliminated the effect of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels. Under these conditions, synaptically induced Ca2+ transients were observed, which were blocked by the NMDA receptor antagonist APV. In addition, the magnitude of LTP was diminished when induced with the postsynaptic membrane held at progressively more positive potentials. LTP could be completely suppressed at potentials near +100 mV. These results provide important experimental support for a role for Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptors in synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1597150658,"The pseudotetrasaccharide acarbose has high affinity for the active site (Ki,app = 1 microM) and low affinity for a secondary site (Kd = 2.3 mM) in barley alpha-amylase 1, distinguished by inhibition kinetics and spectral perturbation. Mutants of putative catalytic residues, D180N, E205Q, and D291N, are inactive and display low affinity for acarbose-Sepharose. H93N and H290N mutants, at invariant residues, have kcat/Km for p-nitrophenylmaltoheptaoside of 0.3 and 1.2% of wild-type. A corresponding 370- and 85-fold increased Ki,app for acarbose and a lack of shifts in pH activity profiles indicate that these histidines participate in transition state stabilization but not directly in catalysis. This finding agrees with H bonding to OH groups of the valienamine ring of acarbose in the three-dimensional structure. Loss of inhibition above pH 6 supports that acarbose is most potent in protonated form. The low affinity site contains Trp278 and Trp279, known to bind cyclomaltoheptaose. While the W279A mutant has 10-fold decreased affinity for starch granules, production of Trp278 mutants failed. The invariant Trp278 is perhaps critical for stability or folding in cereal alpha-amylases."
https://openalex.org/W1574772208,"The gene product of an open reading frame of the chloroplast genome, accD, that has sequence similarity with a subunit of acetyl-CoA carboxylase from Escherichia coli was detected immunochemically in pea chloroplasts. The apparent molecular mass of the accD protein was 87 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein was acidic and had less mobility than the calculated value, 67,116. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity solubilized from pea chloroplasts was inhibited by antibodies against recombinant accD protein. The antibodies precipitated a polypeptide of 35 kDa containing biotin and a polypeptide of 91 kDa together with the 87-kDa-accD protein. The accD protein formed a complex with the molecular mass of about 700 kDa, probably with the 35- and 91-kDa proteins. These results indicate that the chloroplast-encoded polypeptide, accD protein, is a component of a functional acetyl-CoA carboxylase in chloroplasts and this enzyme is a multi-subunit complex, like that from E. coli. The synthesis of accD protein was not induced by light."
https://openalex.org/W1542238138,"Fasted rats were intragastrically infused with either [2,3-13C]lactate or [1,2,3-13C]lactate. The infusate also contained 14C-labeled lactate and [3-3H]glucose. Glucose, alanine, glutamate, and glutamine were isolated from liver and blood. There was near complete equilibration of lactate and alanine, and the relative specific activities and relative enrichments were the same in blood and liver. Glucose was cleaved enzymatically to lactate. The compounds were examined by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. From the mass isotopomer spectra of the lactate, glutamate, and glutamine and their cleavage fragments the positional isotopomer composition of these compounds was obtained. The enrichment and isotopomer pattern in the lactate from cleaved glucose represents that in phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). When [1,2,3-13C]lactate was infused the mass isotopomer spectrum of glutamates consisted only of compounds containing either one, two, or three 13C carbons per molecule (m1, m2, and m3). There was little 13C in C-4 and C-5 of glutamate. The rate of pyruvate decarboxylation is low, and 3-4% of the acetyl-CoA flux in the Krebs cycle is contributed by lactate carbon. The major isotopomers in lactate, alanine, and PEP were m3 and m2 with 13C in C-2 and C-3. The predominant isotopomer in PEP from [2,3-13C]lactate was m2 with 13C in C-2 and C-3. There was much more of m1 isotopomer with 13C in C-3 and C-2 than the m1 isotopomer with 13C in C-1. There was very little m3, the isotopomer with 13C in all three carbons. Most of the 13C in C-3 and C-4 of glucose and C-1 of glutamate was introduced via 13CO2 fixation. From the isotopomer distribution and the rate of glucose turnover we deduced, applying the analysis described in the Appendix, the absolute rates of gluconeogenic pathways, recycling of PEP and the Cori cycle, and flux in the Krebs cycle. The flux from oxaloacetate (OAA)-->PEP was seven times that of OAA-->citrate, and about half of PEP was recycled to pyruvate via pyruvate kinase. The mass isotopomer patterns in glutamate and glutamine were similar but differed from those of lactate and glucose. It appears that the glutamates are derived from alpha-ketoglutarate from a different Krebs cycle pool than PEP. The flux from OAA to PEP in this pool was two to three times that of OAA to citrate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1523374635,"Nicotine, a major component of tobacco smoke, stimulates catecholamine secretion and activates catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes such as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) in adrenal medullary cells. We investigated the effect of long term treatment with nicotine on TH and DBH gene expression in rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cells. Nicotine treatment for 1-2 days increased both the TH and DBH mRNA levels. The effect of nicotine on TH mRNA seems to be transcriptionally mediated. Deletion analysis of the 5' promoter region of the TH gene showed that the region containing a cyclic AMP/calcium regulatory element is sufficient for the nicotinic induction of TH. Nicotine did not induce TH mRNA or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter activity in mutant PC12 cells deficient in protein kinase A activity. However, the deficiency in protein kinase A activity did not affect the elevation in intracellular calcium concentration caused by nicotine, indicating normal receptor function. These results suggest that a cAMP-mediated pathway plays a crucial role in the long term nicotine-induced activation of the TH gene."

https://openalex.org/W1484878776,"The effect of melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) on the differentiation of mammalian melanocytes has been widely studied since the early 1950s. There have been many reports about the stimulatory effect of MSH on melanin production and specifically on the activity of tyrosinase, the critical enzyme in the melanogenic pathway. However, few and variable results have been obtained concerning the effect of this hormone on the regulation of DOPAchrome tautomerase (TRP2), another melanogenic enzyme which functions later in the melanogenic pathway, or on other melanogenic activities, such as TRP1. In this study, we show that the MSH-induced stimulation of tyrosinase is accompanied by no significant change in the synthesis or catalytic activities of other melanogenic enzymes such as TRP1 or TRP2. This in turn elicits a dramatic increase in melanin production accompanied by a significant decrease in the incorporation of carboxylated precursors into that melanin biopolymer, although the biological implication of that is still unclear."
https://openalex.org/W1600665231,"Transmembrane topology of polytopic integral membrane proteins is established during protein synthesis at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. For some polytopic proteins, sequential and independent signal, stop transfer, and/or signal anchor sequences contained in the nascent chain direct this process. Here we define the topology of human P-glycoprotein (MDR1) through the first two transmembrane regions (TM1 and TM2, respectively) of the amino-terminal half of the protein. We show that unlike TM7 and TM8, which comprise homologous regions in the carboxyl half of the protein (Skach, W., Calayag, M. C., and Lingappa, V. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 6903-6908), TM1 and TM2 achieve the orientation predicted by conventional structural models. However, TM1 and TM2 appear to utilize a mechanism of biogenesis different in a key respect from that observed in multispanning proteins studied previously. TM1 and TM2, with their flanking regions, independently direct the topology observed for each of these sequences in the native protein. Each can interact with signal recognition particle to direct targetting to the endoplasmic reticulum, nascent chain translocation, and correct transmembrane orientation. Unlike the transmembrane regions of previously studied multispanning membrane proteins, neither TM1 nor TM2 alone is sufficient to integrate the chain into the membrane. However, when TM1 and TM2 are both present, as occurs in native MDR1, integration is achieved. These results suggest that cooperative interactions between TM1 and TM2 are necessary for chain integration and thus add a new complexity to the current view of polytopic integral membrane protein biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1539101560,"EICAR (5-ethynyl-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylimidazole-4-carboxamide) is a cytostatic agent that inhibits murine leukemia L1210 and human lymphocyte CEM cells at a 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.80-1.4 microM, respectively. EICAR causes a rapid and marked inhibition of inosinate (IMP) dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.205) activity in intact L1210 and CEM cells reflected by a concentration-dependent accumulation of IMP and depletion of GTP and dGTP levels. EICAR 5'-monophosphate is a potent inhibitor of purified L1210 cell IMP dehydrogenase (Ki/Km 0.06). Inhibition of IMP dehydrogenase by EICAR 5'-monophosphate is competitive with respect to IMP. L1210 cells that were selected for resistance to the cytostatic action of EICAR proved to be adenosine kinase-deficient. Also, studies with other mutant L1210 and CEM cell lines revealed that adenosine kinase, as well as an alternative pathway, may be responsible for the conversion of EICAR to its 5'-monophosphate. Purified 2'-deoxycytidine kinase, 2'-deoxyguanosine kinase, cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase, and nicotinamide dinucleotide (NAD) pyrophosphorylase do not seem to be markedly involved in the metabolism of EICAR."
https://openalex.org/W1510441648,"P-glycoprotein is phosphorylated in cells, and it has been suggested that phosphorylation may regulate the drug transport activity of P-glycoprotein. Domain mapping, utilizing a combination of cyanogen bromide digestion and immunoblot analysis, was used to reveal the major phosphorylation sites in murine mdr1b P-glycoprotein. After labeling of J7.V1-1 cells with [32P]Pi, or labeling membranes with [gamma-32P]ATP and either protein kinase A or protein kinase C, it was found that the majority of the label was contained within a single cyanogen bromide fragment (amino acid 627-682) that encompassed the majority of the linker region. The in vitro protein kinase C phosphorylation sites within this fragment were analyzed by a combination of fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FABMS) and two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. FABMS analysis of a protein kinase C-phosphorylated synthetic peptide, corresponding to a segment of the linker region of P-glycoprotein, identified serine 669 as the single site of phosphorylation. Comparison of two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide maps prepared from synthetic peptide and P-glycoprotein, both of which were phosphorylated in vitro with protein kinase C, revealed that serine 669 was also the major phosphorylation site in the intact glycoprotein. The in vitro protein kinase A phosphorylation site was identified as serine 681 by site-directed mutagenesis. Inspection of the gene organization and the deduced amino acid sequence of mdr1b P-glycoprotein revealed that the linker region, although shorter than the R domain (55 versus 241 amino acids), fits the operational definition of the R domain of cystic fibrosis conductance regulator. Like the R domain, the linker region is encoded by a single exon, is highly charged with alternating acidic and basic side chains, and contains several protein kinase A/protein kinase C consensus phosphorylation sites. Since the R domain is believed to be involved in the regulation of cystic fibrosis conductance regulator function by phosphorylation, it is possible that the linker region plays a similar regulatory role in P-glycoprotein function."
https://openalex.org/W1529940313,"The potent and site-selective nephrotoxicity of S-(1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl)-L-cysteine (TFEC) in vivo has been associated with difluorothioamidyl-L-lysine formation on critical mitochondrial target proteins. Dose-response studies in the Fischer 344 rat indicate that five proteins with apparent molecular masses of 99, 84, 66, 52, and 48 kDa are predominantly adducted in vivo after nephrotoxic doses of TFEC (> 10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). Microsequence analysis of the major difluorothioamidyl-L-lysine proteins indicated that P66 is identical, over 14 NH2-terminal residues, to mitochondrial P1 protein (HSP60, a chaperonin) and that P84 is identical, over 14 residues, to a recently isolated novel member of the HSP70 family known as mortalin. These studies indicate that mitochondrial heat shock proteins are major targets for modification by reactive metabolites of TFEC. The implications of these data in relation to the nephrotoxicity of cysteine conjugates are discussed."

Selectivity of the process was shown by the absence of translocation activity of transferrin and horseradish peroxidase used as membrane-bound and fluid-phase endosome labels, respectively. Endocytosed 125I-ricin translocation was found to be strictly ATP- (Km approximately 4 mM) and temperature-dependent, with up to 30% endosomal 125I-ricin appearing in the external medium after 2 h at 37 degrees C. No treatments neutralizing the acidic endosome pH (ammonium chloride, nigericin, chloroquine) significantly impaired ricin translocation, and the pH gradient across the endosome membrane is not required for this process. Chase experiments showed that the ability of 125I-ricin to translocate increases with its depth in the endocytic system (i.e. plasma membrane < early endosomes < late endosomes). Both A and B ricin chains displayed translocation ability as demonstrated by the results of our assay on ricin, ricin B, transferrin-ricin A, and transferrin-ricin B conjugates. Biological activity of both ricin chains is preserved after translocation as shown by the inhibitory effect of the A chain on cell-free protein synthesis and the binding of the B chain to lactose-agarose."
https://openalex.org/W1487293552,"The role of the extracellular domain of the Na,K-ATPase beta subunit in assembly with the alpha subunit was investigated. A chimeric protein consisting of the extracellular domain of the beta subunit fused with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of dipeptidyl peptidase IV assembles with the alpha subunit. An inverse chimera consisting of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of the beta subunit fused with the extracellular domain of dipeptidyl peptidase IV does not assemble with the alpha subunit. The assembly data from these chimeras demonstrate that the extracellular domain of the beta subunit is both necessary and sufficient for assembly with the alpha subunit. Deletions of up to 146 extracellular amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of the beta subunit appear to result in misfolding of the subunit, but do allow reduced assembly with the alpha subunit. Together, the assembly data from chimeras and carboxyl-terminal deletions have identified a 96-residue extracellular domain which contains sequences involved in subunit assembly. While the chimeric subunits properly localize to the plasma membrane, deletion of as few as 4 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus impairs the ability of the beta subunit to be transported to the plasma membrane."

A set of 913 distance constraints derived from NOEs was used, together with a large set of lower distance bounds based on the absence of NOEs in the spectrum. Eight published structures for neurotoxin I were refined independently to give structures which agree better with the experimental data, as reflected in reduced R factors calculated over well resolved cross-peaks of the two-dimensional NOE spectra and a lower total volume of peaks in back-calculated spectra that are absent from experimental spectra. The refined structures are also more precisely defined, with mean pairwise root mean square differences over backbone heavy atoms of 0.62 A for well defined residues and 1.14 A for all residues, compared with previous values of 1.09 and 2.41 A, respectively. The consensus constraint set from the 8 refined structures was also used to generate 12 new structures, with corresponding root mean square differences of 0.76 and 1.26 A. In all 20 structures the loop linking the first and second strands of the beta-sheet is considerably better defined than before. A type I beta-turn encompassing the functionally important residues Asp6, Asp7, and Glu8 is evident in the refined structures."
https://openalex.org/W1590640212,"Molecular chaperones form a class of proteins that bind selectively to nascent, unfolded, misfolded, or aggregated polypeptides. This property is the basis of their implication in many cellular processes such as protein folding, protein targeting to membranes, or protein renaturation after stress. It has been suggested that the recognition of non-native proteins by chaperones is mediated by their binding to exposed hydrophobic areas, to the polypeptide backbone, or to specific secondary structures. We show in the present study that DnaK, the 70-kDa chaperone of Escherichia coli specifically recognizes hydrophobic amino acids. The peptide-dependent ATPase activity of DnaK is specifically stimulated by Ile, Phe, Leu, and Val in a manner which is consistent with an interaction of these amino acids with the polypeptide binding site of DnaK. Two classes of amino acid binding site can be distinguished, one being specific for the aliphatic amino acids and the other for the aromatic amino acids. Since the hydrophobic amino acids are buried inside the hydrophobic core of native proteins and are exposed in non-native forms, their interaction with DnaK could be the basis of the specific interaction of the chaperone with non-native proteins in protein folding, protein targeting to membranes, or protein renaturation."

In the absence of G proteins, the enzyme also catalyzes the hydrolysis of NAD+. Glu-129 was previously shown to be critical for both enzymatic activities. In this study, site-directed mutagenesis was used to make the conservative substitution of aspartate for Glu-129. The recombinant wild type and mutant proteins were purified to near homogeneity and used for enzymatic analyses. Kinetic experiments showed that the kcat of the mutant protein was about 200 times less than that of the wild type enzyme, whereas the Km for NAD+ of the two proteins were very similar, suggesting that Glu-129 is a catalytic residue for the NAD-glycohydrolase reaction of S1. This hypothesis was confirmed by a less than 2-fold change in Kd as measured by fluorescence quenching studies, indicating that the binding of NAD+ is not affected in the mutant protein in any important way. In another experiment, the replacement of Glu-129 by cysteine resulted in a disulfide bridge between Cys-129 and Cys-41 in rS1d-E129C, suggesting that the folding of the polypeptide chain is such that the catalytic Glu-129 residue is close to the amino-terminal NAD-binding site of S1. These findings imply that Glu-129 plays a key role in catalysis of the NAD-glycohydrolase reaction, possibly by electrostatically stabilizing a cationic transition state intermediate, or by serving as a general base to deprotonate the ADP-ribosyl acceptor substrates."

(1992) J. Bacteriol. 174, 5772-5779; Dougherty, T. J., Thanassi, J. A., and Pucci, M. J. (1993) J. Bacteriol. 175, 111-116), but its gene product has not been identified. We found that the amino acid sequence of protein deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the open reading frame of murI gene (ORF1) shows a significant homology with that of glutamate racemase of Pediococcus pentosaceus. The amino acid sequence of glutamate racemase of Lactobacillus fermenti recently reported also shows a homology with the deduced amino acid sequence of ORFI (Gallo, K. A., and Knowles, J. R. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 3981-3990). The murI (dga) gene was ligated into a plasmid, pKK223-3, with a designed ribosome binding site and expressed in E. coli JM109 cells. Glutamate racemase was produced by the transformant cells, whereas the enzyme was not found in the host cells. Accordingly, we newly termed the gene glr, which is more relevant than murI and dga. We partially purified the enzyme to characterize it. The enzyme consists of two identical subunits with a molecular weight of about 31,000 in contrast to the P. pentosaceus enzyme, a monomer protein."

https://openalex.org/W1575725526,"We have purified to apparent homogeneity an acyl-CoA hydrolase activity from rat intestinal villus cell microsomes by heparin and anion exchange and affinity chromatography. The purified 54-kDa acyl-CoA hydrolase along with several microsomal proteins form a covalent acyl-protein bond upon incubation with an activated fatty acid (acyl-CoA). The acyl moiety of the acylated acyl-CoA hydrolase is stable to denaturation and extraction with organic solvents, but is displaced by neutral hydroxylamine or mercaptoethanol, indicating a labile high energy (thio)ester linkage. The enzyme activity is inhibited by thiol-directed reagents and activated by the presence of dithiothreitol suggesting the presence of a cysteine residue(s) at or near the active site. Common serine-esterase inhibitors (NaF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and activators (Mg2+, Ca2+) had no effect on the hydrolase activity. The enzyme hydrolyzed (transferred to water) 14-20 carbon acyl-CoA with similar efficiencies and did not utilize glycerophospholipids or mono- and diacylglycerols as potential acyl donors/acceptors. Phospholipids and mono- and diradylglycerols at concentrations below 100 microM or polyclonal antibodies raised against the purified hydrolase did not inhibit the enzyme activity. However, the acyl-CoA hydrolase activity could be immunoprecipitated from solubilized microsomes or purified enzyme preparations with corresponding decrease of the hydrolase activity in the supernatant of the immunoprecipitate. Immunoblotting studies show cross-reactivity with a protein of an identical molecular mass in other rat or human tissues. It is concluded that the microsomal acyl-CoA hydrolase deserves consideration as a candidate acyl-enzyme intermediate in glycerolipid synthesis when associated with appropriate acyltransferases."

https://openalex.org/W1556100161,"We have isolated and characterized cDNA clones encoding the porcine liver octameric enzyme, 5-formiminotetrahydrofolate:L-glutamate N-formiminotransferase (EC 2.1.2.5)-formiminotetrahydrofolate cyclodeaminase (EC 4.3.1.4). The cDNA encodes a novel amino acid sequence of 541 residues which contains exact matches to two sequences derived by automated sequence analysis of CNBr cleavage fragments isolated from the porcine enzyme. The recombinant enzyme has been expressed as a soluble protein in Escherichia coli at levels 4-fold higher than those observed in liver, and is bifunctional, displaying both transferase and deaminase activities. With a calculated subunit molecular mass of 58,926 Da, it is similar in size to the enzyme isolated from porcine liver. Purification of the enzyme from E. coli involves chromatography on a novel polyglutamate column which might interact with the folylpolyglutamate binding site of the protein. The purified recombinant enzyme has a transferase specific activity of 39-41 units/mg/min."

https://openalex.org/W1563508394,"Chemical modifications of 2 specific residues present in angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) result in its inactivation, thereby suggesting that these 2 residues may be important for its enzyme activity. We directly tested this hypothesis by substituting Tyr-236 with Phe and Lys-154 with Glu in rabbit testicular ACE (ACET) using site-directed mutagenesis of the corresponding cDNA. Wild type ACET, the two single mutants, and the double mutant were expressed in HeLa cells using the vaccinia virus-T7 polymerase expression system. The rate of synthesis, post-translational modifications, and cleavage secretion pattern of all four proteins were indistinguishable. The enzymatic properties of the two single mutants and the wild type enzyme were also very similar. In contrast, the double mutant had about a 20-fold lower specific activity although its Km was only 6-fold higher than that of the wild type protein. The double mutant also had a 100-fold higher Ki for lisinopril, a competitive inhibitor of ACET, and was 17-fold less sensitive to stimulation by NaCl, an activator of ACET. These results directly demonstrate that Tyr-236 and Lys-154 are indeed critical for the catalytic activity, lisinopril inhibition, and NaCl activation of ACET."

https://openalex.org/W1574757248,"Guanylin is a 15-amino acid peptide hormone that was originally isolated from the jejunum of the rat small intestine and shown to be an endogenous activator of the intestinal heat-stable enterotoxin receptor-guanylyl cyclase. Guanylin is synthesized as a 115-amino acid prohormone, proguanylin, which is processed at a site yet to be determined, into a C-terminal bioactive fragment(s). In order to examine the processing of proguanylin in vitro, we have generated large quantities of the properly folded prohormone by constructing an expression vector that directs its secretion into the periplasmic space of Escherichia coli. The bacterially expressed human proguanylin was then processed to smaller C-terminal fragments by protease digestion. Digestion with trypsin or lysine-C generated C-terminal peptides of different length, which have been purified and characterized. Guanylin-22 and guanylin-32 have binding affinities and biological activities similar to guanylin-15, while guanylin-63 and the entire proguanylin have only minimal bioactivity. Circular dichroism spectroscopy reveals that proguanylin is a stably folded protein containing mostly beta-sheet and beta-turn structure."
