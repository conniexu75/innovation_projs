https://openalex.org/W1998487776,"Mammalian mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases include extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 subgroups. These MAP kinase isoforms are activated by dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine. Two human MAP kinase kinases (MKK3 and MKK4) were cloned that phosphorylate and activate p38 MAP kinase. These MKK isoforms did not activate the ERK subgroup of MAP kinases, but MKK4 did activate JNK. These data demonstrate that the activators of p38 (MKK3 and MKK4), JNK (MKK4), and ERK (MEK1 and MEK2) define independent MAP kinase signal transduction pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2053001031,"Integrin receptors mediate cell adhesion, signal transduction, and cytoskeletal organization. How a single transmembrane receptor can fulfill multiple functions was clarified by comparing roles of receptor occupancy and aggregation. Integrin occupancy by monovalent ligand induced receptor redistribution, but minimal tyrosine phosphorylation signaling or cytoskeletal protein redistribution. Aggregation of integrins by noninhibitory monoclonal antibodies on beads induced intracellular accumulations of pp125FAK and tensin, as well as phosphorylation, but no accumulation of other cytoskeletal proteins such as talin. Combining antibody-mediated clustering with monovalent ligand occupancy induced accumulation of seven cytoskeletal proteins, including alpha-actinin, talin, and F-actin, thereby mimicking multivalent interactions with fibronectin or polyvalent peptides. Integrins therefore mediate a complex repertoire of functions through the distinct effects of receptor aggregation, receptor occupancy, or both together."

https://openalex.org/W2011632934,"To determine if defects in the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) system can cause hypertension, mice were generated with a disruption of the proANP gene. Homozygous mutants had no circulating or atrial ANP, and their blood pressures were elevated by 8 to 23 millimeters of mercury when they were fed standard (0.5 percent sodium chloride) and intermediate (2 percent sodium chloride) salt diets. On standard salt diets, heterozygotes had normal amounts of circulating ANP and normal blood pressures. However, on high (8 percent sodium chloride) salt diets they were hypertensive, with blood pressures elevated by 27 millimeters of mercury. These results demonstrate that genetically reduced production of ANP can lead to salt-sensitive hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2078422108,"Members of the myocyte enhancer binding factor-2 (MEF2) family of MADS (MCM1, agamous, deficiens, and serum response factor) box transcription factors are expressed in the skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle lineages of vertebrate and Drosophila embryos. These factors bind an adenine-thymidine-rich DNA sequence associated with muscle-specific genes. The function of MEF2 was determined by generating a loss-of-function of the single mef2 gene in Drosophila (D-mef2). In loss-of-function embryos, somatic, cardiac, and visceral muscle cells did not differentiate, but myoblasts were normally specified and positioned. These results demonstrate that different muscle cell types share a common myogenic differentiation program controlled by MEF2."

The underlying gene has been localized to a 500-kilobase segment of the Xq21 band. Here, it is reported that a candidate gene for this disorder, Brain 4 (POU3F4), which encodes a transcription factor with a POU domain, maps to the same interval. In five unrelated patients with DFN3 but not in 50 normal controls, small mutations were found that result in truncation of the predicted protein or in nonconservative amino acid substitutions. These findings indicate that POU3F4 mutations are a molecular cause of DFN3."

https://openalex.org/W2082288587,"Arm movements made by newborn babies are usually dismissed as unintentional, purposeless, or reflexive. Spontaneous arm-waving movements were recorded while newborns lay supine facing to one side. They were allowed to see only the arm they were facing, only the opposite arm on a video monitor, or neither arm. Small forces pulled on their wrists in the direction of the toes. The babies opposed the perturbing force so as to keep an arm up and moving normally, but only when they could see the arm, either directly or on the video monitor. The findings indicate that newborns can purposely control their arm movements in the face of external forces and that development of visual control of arm movement is underway soon after birth."

https://openalex.org/W2061357866,"The guanine-uracil (G⋅U) base pair that helps to define the 5′-splice site of group I introns is phylogenetically highly conserved. In such a wobble base pair, G makes two hydrogen bonds with U in a geometry shifted from that of a canonical Watson-Crick pair. The contribution made by individual functional groups of the G⋅U pair in the context of the Tetrahymena ribozyme was examined by replacement of the G⋅U pair with synthetic base pairs that maintain a wobble configuration, but that systematically alter functional groups in the major and minor grooves of the duplex. The substitutions demonstrate that the exocyclic amine of G, when presented on the minor groove surface by the wobble base pair conformation, contributes substantially (2 kilocalories⋅mole-1) to binding by making a tertiary interaction with the ribozyme active site. It contributes additionally to transition state stabilization. The ribozyme active site also makes tertiary contacts with a tripod of 2′-hydroxyls on the minor groove surface of the splice site helix. This suggests that the ribozyme binds the duplex primarily in the minor groove. The alanyl aminoacyl transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetase recognizes the exocyclic amine of an invariant G⋅U pair and contacts a similar array of 2′-hydroxyls when binding the tRNAAla acceptor stem, providing an unanticipated parallel between protein-RNA and RNA-RNA interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1981831765,Specular neutron reflection has been used to determine the structure and composition of bovine beta-casein adsorbed on a solid surface from an aqueous phosphate-buffered solution at pH 7. The protein was adsorbed on a hydrophobic monolayer self-assembled from deuterated octadecyltrichlorosilane solution on a silicon (111) surface. A two-layer structure formed consisting of one dense layer of thickness 23 +/- 1 angstroms and a surface coverage of 1.9 milligrams per square meter adjacent to the surface and an external layer protruding into the solution of thickness 35 +/- 1 angstroms and 12 percent protein volume fraction. The structure of the (beta-casein) layer is explained in terms of the charge distribution in the protein.

https://openalex.org/W1975063875,"In China in recent years, male live births have exceeded those of females by amounts far greater than those that occur naturally in human populations, a trend with significant demographic consequences. The resulting imbalance in the first-marriage market is estimated to be about 1 million males per year after 2010. These ""excess"" males were not easily accommodated in models with substantial changes in first-marriage patterns. The current sex ratio at birth has little effect on a couple's probability of having at least one son, so future increases in the sex ratio may well occur, especially given increasing access to sex-selective abortion."
https://openalex.org/W2014075858,"Neurotrophic factors participate in the development and maintenance of the nervous system. Application of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), a protein that promotes survival of motor neurons, resulted in an immediate potentiation of spontaneous and impulse-evoked transmitter release at developing neuromuscular synapses in Xenopus cell cultures. When CNTF was applied at the synapse, the onset of the potentiation was slower than that produced by application at the cell body of the presynaptic neuron. The potentiation effect was abolished when the neurite shaft was severed from the cell body. Thus, transmitter secretion from the nerve terminals is under immediate somatic control and can be regulated by CNTF."

https://openalex.org/W2051624449,Analyses of long-term experimental data from the Chihuahuan desert revealed that species diversity of other rodents was higher on plots from which kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spp.) had been removed. The difference was due to consistently higher colonization and lower extinction probabilities of small granivorous rodents in the absence of competitively dominant kangaroo rats. The results of this ecosystem experiment demonstrate the importance of both competitive exclusion and metapopulation dynamics for biological diversity in a natural community.
