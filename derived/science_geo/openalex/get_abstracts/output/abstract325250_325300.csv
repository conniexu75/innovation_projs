https://openalex.org/W2011874881,"The thiophene oligomer alpha-hexathienylene (alpha-6T) has been successfully used as the active semiconducting material in thin-film transistors. Field-induced conductivity in thin-film transistors with alpha-6T active layers occurs only near the interfacial plane, whereas the residual conductivity caused by unintentional doping scales with the thickness of the layer. The two-dimensional nature of the field-induced conductivity is due not to any anisotropy in transport with respect to any molecular axis but to interface effects. Optimized methods of device fabrication have resulted in high field-effect mobilities and on/off current ratios of > 10(6). The current densities and switching speeds are good enough to allow consideration of these devices in practical large-area electronic circuits."
https://openalex.org/W1994228620,"The compound [Fe(tvp)2(NCS)2] ⋅ CH3OH, where tvp is 1,2-di-(4-pyridyl)-ethylene, has been synthesized and characterized by x-ray single-crystal diffraction. It consists of two perpendicular, two-dimensional networks organized in parallel stacks of sheets made up of edge-shared [Fe(II)]4 rhombuses. The fully interlocked networks define large square channels in the [001] direction. Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements and Mössbauer studies reveal that this compound shows low-spin to high-spin crossover behavior in the temperature range from 100 to 250 kelvin. The combined structural and magnetic characterization of this kind of compound is fundamental for the interpretation of the mechanism leading to the spin crossover, which is important in the development of electronic devices such as molecular switches."
https://openalex.org/W2027525749,"The polarization force between an electrically charged atomic force microscope tip and a substrate has been used to follow the processes of condensation and evaporation of a monolayer of water on mica at room temperature. Condensation proceeds in two distinct structural phases. Up to about 25 percent humidity, the water film grows by forming two-dimensional clusters of less than a few 1000 angstroms in diameter. Above about 25 percent humidity, a second phase grows, forming large two-dimensional islands with geometrical shapes in epitaxial relation with the underlaying mica lattice. The growth of this second water phase is completed when the humidity reaches about 45 percent. The reverse process of evaporation has also been imaged."
https://openalex.org/W1966772686,Laser scanning confocal microscopy can be used to image the pore structure of geologic materials in three dimensions at a resolution of 200 nanometers. The technique involves impregnation of the void space with an epoxy doped with a fluorochrome whose fluorescent wavelength matches the excitation wavelength. Optical sections with a thickness of less than 1 micrometer can be sliced from thick polished sections and combined to produce three-dimensional reconstructions. Application of the technique to rocks with porosities from 1 to 20 percent reveals the geometric complexity of the pore space. The technique can also be applied to other brittle solids such as ceramics.
https://openalex.org/W2067213694,"Highly localized chemical catalysis was carried out on the surface groups of a self-assembled monolayer with a scanning probe device. With the use of a platinum-coated atomic force microscope tip, the terminal azide groups of the monolayer were catalytically hydrogenated with high spatial resolution. The newly created amino groups were then covalently modified to generate new surface structures. By varying the nature of the catalyst and the chemical composition of the surface, it may be possible to synthesize molecular assemblies not readily produced by existing microfabrication techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2099748324,"Gravitational lensing provides a strict test of cosmogonic models because it is directly sensitive to mass inhomogeneities. Detailed numerical propagation of light rays through a universe that has a distribution of inhomogeneities derived from the standard CDM (cold dark matter) scenario, with the aid of massive, fully nonlinear computer simulations, was used to test the model. It predicts that more widely split quasar images should have been seen than were actually found. These and other inconsistencies rule out the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE)-normalized CDM model with density parameter Omega = 1 and the Hubble constant (H(o)) = 50 kilometers second(-1) megaparsec(-1); but variants of this model might be constructed, which could pass the stringent tests provided by strong gravitational lensing."

The composition is, in general, basaltic; the low sodium and high titanium contents, however, are distinctly different from the abundances in meteorites or common terrestrial rocks."
https://openalex.org/W2051232856,"The completed data set obtained from the 4-station Apollo seismic network includes signals from approximately 11,800 events of various types. Four data sets for use by other investigators, through the NSSDC, are in preparation. Some refinement of the lunar model based on seismic data can be expected, but its gross features remain as presented two years ago. The existence of a small, molten core remains dependent upon the analysis of signals from a single, far-side impact. Analysis of secondary arrivals from other sources may eventually resolve this issue, as well as continued refinement of the magnetic field measurements. Evidence of considerable lateral heterogeneity within the moon continues to build. The mystery of the much meteoroid flux estimate derived from lunar seismic measurements, as compared with earth-based estimates, remains; although, significant correlations between terrestrial and lunar observations are beginning to emerge."

https://openalex.org/W1964975719,"A modular multilane steel freeway bridge has been constructed from surplus railroad flatcar decks. It can be erected on-site in a few days' time. It has been built and static-load tested for emergency freeway bridge repair. This inexpensive modular bridge may also have broad application around the world for low-cost bridges in areas where funds are limited. On the basis of static-load testing performed by the California Department of Transportation and computer dynamic analysis, this simple modular-design concept has the potential of providing a strong bridge that can withstand the severe aftershocks expected immediately after a major earthquake."

https://openalex.org/W2003625057,"CERN, Europe`s particle physics center agreed December 1993 to spend $2 billion to build the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), hoping that an additional $500 million could be raised from non-member countries. CERN was hoping for a $300 million U.S. contribution to the accelerator and its various components. However, nothing was forthcoming from the U.S. and it was suggested the request wait until the 1996 budget is adopted. A final decision on the LHC is scheduled to be made in 1997."
