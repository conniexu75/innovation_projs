https://openalex.org/W2905188402,"The age-related functional exhaustion limits potential efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in treating cardiovascular disease. Therefore, rejuvenation of aged MSC in the elderly population is of great interest. We have previously reported that Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4) plays a critical role in regulating MSC survival under hypoxia. The aim of this study was to investigate whether ERBB4 rejuvenates aged MSC and how ERBB4 enhances therapeutic efficacy of aged MSC in treating myocardial infarction (MI). Compared with vector aged MSC (aged-MSC), ERBB4-engineered aged MSC (ER4-aged-MSC) conferred resistance to oxidative stress-induced cell death and ameliorated the senescent phenotype in vitro. Four weeks after MI, the ER4-aged-MSC group exhibited enhanced blood vessel density, reduced cardiac remodeling and apoptosis with improved heart function compared with the aged-MSC group. Overexpression of ERBB4 caused an increase in phosphorylated v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT), and phosphorylated ERK expression under hypoxia. ER4-aged-MSC secreted higher levels of angiopoietin, epithelial neutrophil activating peptide 78, VEGF, and fibroblast growth factor 2, and enhanced tube formation in HUVEC. The impact of ERBB4 on protein expression, proangiogenesis, cell behavior, and cytokine secretion was abolished by inhibiting PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathway.—Liang, X., Ding, Y., Lin, F., Zhang, Y., Zhou, X., Meng, Q., Lu, X., Jiang, G., Zhu, H., Chen, Y., Lian, Q., Fan, H., Liu, Z.

The aim of this study is to examine the prevalence, distribution, and associated factors of suicide attempts among young adolescents in 40 low-income and middle-income countries. We used data from the Global School-Based Student Health Survey (2009–2013) and a nationally representative study in China (2010), which are school-based surveys of students primarily aged 12–18 years that assess health behaviors using an anonymous, standardized, self-reported questionnaire. We calculated the prevalence of suicide attempts in young adolescents from 40 low-income and middle-income countries using the surveys. Multilevel logistic models were used to estimate the associations between suicide attempts and potential risk factors, adjusting for gender, age, school and survey year. Results show that the mean 12-month prevalence of suicide attempts was 17.2%, ranging from 6.7% in Malaysia to 61.2% in Samoa. The overall prevalence of suicide attempts was higher for girls than for boys (18.2% vs 16.2%, P<0.05). Among the suicide attempts, the proportion of suicide attempts with a plan was higher for girls than for boys (62.7% vs 53.2%, P<0.05). Both the prevalence of suicide attempts and the proportion of suicide attempts with a plan increased with age. Factors associated with suicide attempts included poor socioeconomic status, history of bullying, loneliness and anxiety, tobacco and alcohol use, and weak family and social relationships. In conclusion, suicide attempts are frequent among young adolescents in low-income and middle-income countries. Girls and older adolescents tend to make suicide attempts with a plan. The data demonstrate the need to strengthen suicide intervention and prevention programs for young adolescents in low-income and middle-income countries."

Combination therapy for AD has garnered attention following a recent National Institute on Aging mandate, but this approach has not yet been fully validated. In this report, we combined the two most promising nutraceuticals with complementary anti-amyloidogenic properties: the plant-derived phenolics (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG, an α-secretase activator) and ferulic acid (FA, a β-secretase modulator). We used transgenic mice expressing mutant human amyloid β-protein precursor and presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) to model cerebral amyloidosis. At 12 months of age, we orally administered EGCG and/or FA (30 mg/kg each) or vehicle once daily for 3 months. At 15 months, combined EGCG–FA treatment reversed cognitive impairment in most tests of learning and memory, including novel object recognition and maze tasks. Moreover, EGCG- and FA-treated APP/PS1 mice exhibited amelioration of brain parenchymal and cerebral vascular β-amyloid deposits and decreased abundance of amyloid β-proteins compared with either EGCG or FA single treatment. Combined treatment elevated nonamyloidogenic soluble APP-α and α-secretase candidate and down-regulated amyloidogenic soluble APP-β, β-C-terminal APP fragment, and β-secretase protein expression, providing evidence for a shift toward nonamyloidogenic APP processing. Additional beneficial co-treatment effects included amelioration of neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and synaptotoxicity. Our findings offer preclinical evidence that combined treatment with EGCG and FA is a promising AD therapeutic approach. “Nutraceuticals” are well-tolerated natural dietary compounds with drug-like properties that make them attractive as Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutics.

AD is a fatal neurodegenerative illness that likely begins with brain changes 20 years or more prior to clinical symptoms. AD is characterized by progressive decline in memory and other cognitive functions, eventually leading to dementia and death. Neuropathological hallmarks of AD include extracellular senile plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, accompanied by neuroinflammation, synaptic toxicity, and neuron loss (1Selkoe D.J. Alzheimer's disease: genes, proteins, and therapy.Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81 (11274343): 741-76610.1152/physrev.2001.81.2.741Crossref PubMed Scopus (5156) Google Scholar). Amyloid β-protein (Aβ), a peptide derived from amyloid β-protein precursor (APP), has garnered major interest as a therapeutic target for AD. Two enzymes, the β- and γ-secretases, cleave APP into smaller amyloidogenic peptides: Aβ(1–40) and Aβ(1–42), which can form both oligomeric and multimeric aggregates (2De Strooper B. Saftig P.

Once cleaved from APP, Aβ enters into systemic equilibrium between soluble and deposited forms (6DeMattos R.B. Bales K.R. Cummins D.J. Paul S.M. Holtzman D.M.

Conversely, nonamyloidogenic α-secretase cleavage of APP precludes Aβ formation and produces soluble APP-α (sAPP-α) (3Sinha S. Lieberburg I. Cellular mechanisms of β-amyloid production and secretion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Despite intense investigation, a synthetic drug that is both safe and effective has not yet been developed for AD. This inconvenient truth has led to the consideration of alternative strategies, including naturally occurring dietary compounds with therapeutic potential (so-called “nutraceuticals”). Another important matter is a recent mandate to develop combination therapy for AD. Because nutraceuticals are generally safe and well-tolerated, these agents are more amenable to combination than designer drugs. In this report, we explore combination therapy with two promising nutraceuticals that have complementary anti-amyloidogenic properties: (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG, an α-secretase enhancer) (8Rezai-Zadeh K. Shytle D. Sun N. Mori T. Hou H. Jeanniton D. Ehrhart J. Townsend K. Zeng J. Morgan D. Hardy J. Town T. Tan J.

Guillot-Sestier M.V. Tan J. Town T. Ferulic acid is a nutraceutical β-secretase modulator that improves behavioral impairment and Alzheimer-like pathology in transgenic mice.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 (23409038)e5577410.1371/journal.pone.0055774Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). EGCG is a polyphenol catechin (the ester of epigallocatechin and gallic acid) (11Legeay S. Rodier M. Fillon L. Faure S. Clere N. Epigallocatechin gallate: a review of its beneficial properties to prevent metabolic syndrome.Nutrients. 2015; 7 (26198245): 5443-546810.3390/nu7075230Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) that is found in high abundance in tea leaves, including green tea, and in carob flour (i.e. Ceratonia siliqua) at lesser abundance. Trace amounts are found in fruits (e.g. apple and cranberries) and nuts (e.g. pecans and hazelnuts) (12Harnly J.M. Doherty R.F. Beecher G.R. Holden J.M. Haytowitz D.B. Bhagwat S. Gebhardt S.

EGCG has garnered attention as a medicinal agent to improve cognition, reduce inflammation, and even to treat cancer. Beneficial effects are often attributed to anti-oxidant, metal-chelating, anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic, and anti-apoptotic properties (13Singh N.A. Mandal A.K. Khan Z.A. Potential neuroprotective properties of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG).Nutr. J. 2016; 15 (27268025): 6010.1186/s12937-016-0179-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Substantial quantities pass from the small to the large intestine, where EGCG undergoes degradation by gut flora and absorption. EGCG can be reabsorbed from the intestine through enterohepatic re-circulation (14Lee M.J. Maliakal P. Chen L. Meng X. Bondoc F.Y. Prabhu S. Lambert G. Mohr S. Yang C.S.

It has been shown that EGCG crosses the blood–brain barrier after systemic administration (16Lin L.C. Wang M.N. Tseng T.Y. Sung J.S. Tsai T.H.

Shytle D. Sun N. Mori T. Hou H. Jeanniton D. Ehrhart J. Townsend K. Zeng J. Morgan D. Hardy J. Town T. Tan J.

A disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10) activation is mechanistically responsible for EGCG promotion of nonamyloidogenic α-secretase APP cleavage (9Obregon D.F.

Seed plants and leaves (e.g. rice, wheat, and oats), vegetables (e.g. tomatoes and carrots), and fruits (e.g. pineapples and oranges) are the main sources of dietary FA. The compound has both anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties (10Mori T. Koyama N. Guillot-Sestier M.V. Tan J. Town T.

We further reported that FA reverses cognitive/behavioral deficits and mitigates AD-like pathology after 6 months of oral treatment in a transgenic mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis, and it alters amyloidogenic β-secretase APP cleavage in mutant APP-overexpressing neuron-like cells (10Mori T. Koyama N. Guillot-Sestier M.V. Tan J. Town T. Ferulic acid is a nutraceutical β-secretase modulator that improves behavioral impairment and Alzheimer-like pathology in transgenic mice.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 (23409038)e5577410.1371/journal.pone.0055774Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Because FA has a relatively low molecular weight, the compound is freely cell-permeable and bioavailable. FA is absorbed in free form via stomach mucosa and is then transported into the hepatic portal vein where it is metabolized in the liver. Of note, oral FA can be recovered in rat plasma after only 5 min, when the ratio of free FA to total FA is markedly increased, but it rapidly gives rise to conjugated FA. Both free and conjugated FA are distributed via the systemic circulation into peripheral tissues (18Srinivasan M. Sudheer A.R. Menon V.P.

Whereas FA is negatively charged at physiological pH due to a hydroxyl moiety (21Sultana R. Ravagna A. Mohmmad-Abdul H. Calabrese V. Butterfield D.A.

Given that both compounds share anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties and have complementary modes of action on APP cleavage, we tested whether combination therapy with EGCG and FA (each at 30 mg/kg) ameliorated learning and memory changes, cerebral amyloidosis, AD-like pathology, and amyloidogenic APP processing in the mutant human APP and presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) transgenic mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis (APP/PS1 mice). We orally administered EGCG/FA (alone or in combination) or vehicle to APP/PS1 mice once daily for 3 months (beginning at 12 months of age) and evaluated animals at 15 months old. Here, our pre-clinical results show that combination therapy with EGCG plus FA has significant advantages over single treatment with either compound. APP/PS1 mice reportedly have transgene-associated behavioral impairment as early as 5–7 months of age (24Arendash G.W. King D.L. Gordon M.N. Morgan D. Hatcher J.M. Hope C.E. Diamond D.M. Progressive, age-related behavioral impairments in transgenic mice carrying both mutant amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1 transgenes.Brain Res. 2001; 891 (11164808): 42-5310.1016/S0006-8993(00)03186-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), so we began by assessing baseline cognitive status prior to dosing at 12 months. Data revealed behavioral impairment in novel object recognition, Y-maze, and radial arm water maze (RAWM) tests in our cohort of 12-month-old APP/PS1 mice versus wildtype (WT) littermate controls (data not shown). We then randomly assigned behaviorally impaired APP/PS1 mice (four treatments with n = 8 per group; equal numbers of four males and four females) and WT littermates (same group sizes and distribution as APP/PS1 mice). Single or double treatment (via gavage using a 6202 gastric tube with a rounded silicone-coated tip, Fuchigami Kikai, Kyoto, Japan) was given once daily for 3 months with EGCG and/or FA (each at 30 mg/kg) or vehicle beginning at 12 months in APP/PS1 and in WT littermate controls. This directly administered treatment more precisely delivers the targeted amount of agent compared with ad libitum access to drinking water or chow. At the end of treatment (15 months of age), we conducted a behavioral testing battery. We initially assessed episodic memory by novel object recognition test, and all eight mouse groups showed similar recognition indices (50.3–52.5%) in the training phase of the test (Fig. 1A, left; Table S1). In the retention phase, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc comparison disclosed statistically significant differences on recognition index between APP/PS1-V mice and the other seven mouse groups (Fig. 1A, right; Table S1; *, p < 0.05 for APP/PS1-V versus all other mouse groups). Singly- or doubly-treated APP/PS1 mice had significantly increased novel object exploration frequency by 60.8–71.6% versus APP/PS1-V mice (50.0%). Of note, EGCG/FA combination therapy completely mitigated episodic memory impairment (Fig. 1A, right; Table S1; †, p < 0.05, APP/PS1-EGCG/FA versus APP/PS1-EGCG or APP/PS1-FA mice), as there were no significant differences versus any of the WT mouse groups (Fig. 1A, right; Table S1; p > 0.05). We moved on to test exploratory activity and spatial working memory in the alternation Y-maze task. One-way ANOVA followed by post hoc testing revealed statistically significant differences for total arm entries between APP/PS1-V mice and the other seven mouse groups (Fig. 1B, left; Table S2; *, p < 0.05). This transgene-related behavioral phenotype has been noted in this and other mouse models of cerebral amyloidosis (10Mori T. Koyama N. Guillot-Sestier M.V. Tan J. Town T.

Of interest, APP/PS1 transgene-associated hyperactivity, often taken as anxiety-like behavior in APP/PS1 mice, was completely reversed by combined treatment with EGCG plus FA (Fig. 1B, left; Table S2; †, p < 0.05, APP/PS1-EGCG/FA versus APP/PS1-EGCG or APP/PS1-FA mice). Combination treatment completely stabilized hyperactivity, as the co-treatment group did not significantly differ from any of the WT mouse groups (Fig. 1B, left; Table S2; p > 0.05). Mice instinctively alternate arms in the Y-maze, such that they enter the three arms in sequence more often than by chance alone (50%, see dotted line in Fig. 1B, right; Table S2); this behavioral phenotype is generally interpreted as a measure of spatial working memory (24Arendash G.W. King D.L. Gordon M.N. Morgan D. Hatcher J.M. Hope C.E. Diamond D.M. Progressive, age-related behavioral impairments in transgenic mice carrying both mutant amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1 transgenes.Brain Res. 2001; 891 (11164808): 42-5310.1016/S0006-8993(00)03186-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). As expected, APP/PS1-V mouse behavior revealed less tendency to alternate versus WT controls. One-way ANOVA followed by post hoc testing showed statistically significant differences on Y-maze spontaneous alternation between APP/PS1-V mice and the other seven mouse groups (Fig. 1B, right; Table S2; *, p < 0.05). Of note, EGCG- plus FA-treated APP/PS1 mice had greater % alternation compared with EGCG or FA single treatment (Fig. 1B, right; Table S2; ††, p < 0.01, APP/PS1-EGCG/FA versus APP/PS1-EGCG or APP/PS1-FA mice), which did not significantly differ from any of the WT mouse groups (Fig. 1B, right; Table S2; p > 0.05). Therefore, combination treatment fully restored defective spatial working memory in the alternation Y-maze. Finally, we assessed hippocampus-dependent spatial reference learning and memory with the RAWM test. On day 1, overall ANOVA disclosed the main effects of block (p < 0.001 for both errors and escape latency), genotype (p < 0.05 for errors and p < 0.01 for escape latency), and treatment (p < 0.05 for escape latency). APP/PS1-V mice tended toward increased number of errors and longer escape latencies to reach the visible or hidden platform locations compared with the other seven mouse groups. On day 2, overall ANOVA revealed the main effects of block (p < 0.001 for both errors and escape latency), genotype (p < 0.05 for errors and p < 0.01 for escape latency), and treatment (p < 0.001 for both errors and escape latency). Repeated-measures ANOVA followed by post hoc assessment disclosed statistically significant differences between APP/PS1-V mice and the other seven mouse groups (Fig. 1, C and D, left; Tables S3 and S5; *, p < 0.05 for both errors and escape latency). APP/PS1-V mice had more errors and greater escape latencies to reach the visible or hidden platforms compared with the other seven mouse groups; yet, either singly- or doubly-treated APP/PS1 mice accomplished the task with significantly less errors and shorter latencies, and their behavior did not significantly differ from the four WT mouse groups (Fig. 1, C and D, left and right; Tables S3–S6; p > 0.05). There were no significant between-group differences (p > 0.05) on swim speed, nor did we find thigmotaxis (characteristic of extreme anxiety-like behavior) in any of the mice tested. Thus, behavioral differences in the RAWM test were not due to motivational issues, locomotor impairment, or anxiety. These results show that the 3-month treatment with EGCG and/or FA completely remediates spatial reference learning and memory impairment associated with the APP and PS1 transgenes. For all behavioral tests, sex was included as a categorical covariate in multiple ANOVA models, but we did not find significant main effects or interactive terms with sex (p > 0.05). Furthermore, we stratified all analyses by sex and did not find any significant differences (p > 0.05; data not shown). At 15 months of age, APP/PS1-V mice had progressive cerebral amyloid pathology (average of 7–8% cerebral β-amyloid burden) throughout the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), entorhinal cortex (EC), and hippocampus (H) regions of interest (ROI). Treatment with EGCG (32–40%) or FA (29–35%) significantly reduced β-amyloid burden (by Aβ(17–24) mAb 4G8) across all three brain regions (Figs. 2, A–D, and 3, A–C; ***, p ≤ 0.001). Importantly, combination therapy with EGCG plus FA further significantly mitigated cerebral amyloidosis in all three brain regions (50–60%) (Fig. 3, A–C; †, p < 0.05). To further examine whether the 3-month treatment prevented versus reversed cerebral β-amyloid deposition, we included a separate cohort of eight untreated 12-month-old APP/PS1 mice (the age when dosing started) in the analysis (Fig. 3, A–C). Intriguingly, combined treatment trended toward reversing cerebral amyloid pathology across all three brain regions (Fig. 3, A–C). This effect was sex-independent (data not shown).Figure 3Combined treatment with EGCG plus FA effectively attenuates cerebral parenchymal and vascular β-amyloid deposits and lowers Aβ levels.

https://openalex.org/W2904566222,"Introduction Animal and clinical studies suggest complementary effects of magnesium and high-dose pyridoxine (vitamin B6) on stress reduction. This is the first randomized trial evaluating the effects of combined magnesium and vitamin B6 supplementation on stress in a stressed population with low magnesemia using a validated measure of perceived stress. Methods In this Phase IV, investigator-blinded trial (EudraCT: 2015-003749-24), healthy adults with Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-42) stress subscale score >18 and serum magnesium concentration 0.45 mmol/L–0.85 mmol/L, were randomized 1:1 to magnesium–vitamin B6 combination (Magne B6 [Mg–vitamin B6]; daily dose 300 mg and 30 mg, respectively) or magnesium alone (Magnespasmyl [Mg]; daily dose 300 mg). Outcomes included change in DASS-42 stress subscale score from baseline to Week 8 (primary endpoint) and Week 4, and incidence of adverse events (AEs). Results In the modified intention-to-treat analysis (N = 264 subjects), both treatment arms substantially reduced DASS-42 stress subscale score from baseline to Week 8 (Mg–vitamin B6, 44.9%; Mg 42.4%); no statistical difference between arms was observed (p>0.05). An interaction (p = 0.0097) between baseline stress level and treatment warranted subgroup analysis (as per statistical plan); adults with severe/extremely severe stress (DASS-42 stress subscale score ≥25; N = 162) had a 24% greater improvement with Mg–vitamin B6 versus Mg at Week 8 (3.16 points, 95% CI 0.50 to 5.82, p = 0.0203). Consistent results were observed in the per protocol analysis and at Week 4. Overall, 12.1% of Mg–vitamin B6 treated and 17.4% of Mg-treated subjects experienced AEs potentially treatment related. Conclusions These findings suggest oral Mg supplementation alleviated stress in healthy adults with low magnesemia and the addition of vitamin B6 to Mg was not superior to Mg supplementation alone. With regard to subjects with severe/extremely severe stress, this study provides clinical support for greater benefit of Mg combined with vitamin B6."

Participants: Children born 1997-2014, 0-1 years of age diagnosed with fracture-diagnosis according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD10) were retrieved from the National Patient Register and linked to the Swedish Medical Birth Register and the Death Cause Register. Main outcome measures were fractures of the skull, long bone, clavicle and ribs, categorized by age (younger or older than 6 months), and accident or not.The incidence of fractures during infancy was 251 per 100 000 infants (n = 4663). Major fracture localisations were long bone (44·9%), skull (31·7%), and clavicle (18·6%), while rib fractures were few (1·4%). Fall accidents were reported among 71·4%. One-third occurred during the first 6 months. Metabolic bone disease risk factors, such as maternal obesity, preterm birth, vitamin D deficiency, rickets, and calcium metabolic disturbances, had increased odds of fractures of long bones and ribs in early infancy (0-6 months): birth 32-36 weeks and long bone fracture [AOR 2·13 (95%CI 1·67-2·93)] and rib fracture [AOR 4·24 (95%CI 1·40-12·8)]. Diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency/rickets/disorders of calcium metabolism had increased odds of long bone fracture [AOR 49·5 (95%CI 18·3-134)] and rib fracture [AOR 617 (95%CI 162-2506)]. Fractures without a reported accident had higher odds of metabolic risk factors than those with reported accidents. Abuse diagnosis was registered in 105 infants, with overrepresentation of preterm births, multiple births and small-for-gestational age.Metabolic bone disease risk factors are strongly associated with fractures of long bone and ribs in early infancy. Fracture cases with abuse diagnosis had a metabolic bone risk factor profile."
https://openalex.org/W2904812979,"Hepatocyte lipotoxicity is characterized by aberrant mitochondrial metabolism, which predisposes cells to oxidative stress and apoptosis. Previously, we reported that translocation of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria of palmitate-treated hepatocytes activates anaplerotic flux from glutamine to α-ketoglutarate (αKG), which subsequently enters the citric acid cycle (CAC) for oxidation. We hypothesized that increased glutamine anaplerosis fuels elevations in CAC flux and oxidative stress following palmitate treatment. To test this hypothesis, primary rat hepatocytes or immortalized H4IIEC3 rat hepatoma cells were treated with lipotoxic levels of palmitate while modulating anaplerotic pathways leading to αKG. We found that culture media supplemented with glutamine, glutamate, or dimethyl-αKG increased palmitate lipotoxicity compared with media that lacked these anaplerotic substrates. Knockdown of glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase activity significantly reduced the lipotoxic effects of palmitate, whereas knockdown of glutamate dehydrogenase (Glud1) had no effect on palmitate lipotoxicity. 13C flux analysis of H4IIEC3 cells co-treated with palmitate and the pan-transaminase inhibitor aminooxyacetic acid confirmed that reductions in lipotoxic markers were associated with decreases in anaplerosis, CAC flux, and oxygen consumption. Taken together, these results demonstrate that lipotoxic palmitate treatments enhance anaplerosis in cultured rat hepatocytes, causing a shift to aberrant transaminase metabolism that fuels CAC dysregulation and oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2903653861,"Mast cells (MCs) participate in allergy, inflammation, and defense against pathogens. They release multiple immune mediators via exocytosis, a process that requires SNARE proteins, including syntaxins (Stxs). The identity of the Stxs involved in MC exocytosis remains controversial. Here, we studied the roles of Stx3 and -4 in fully developed MCs from conditional knockout mice by electrophysiology and EM, and found that Stx3, and not Stx4, is crucial for MC exocytosis. The main defect seen in Stx3-deficient MCs was their inability to engage multigranular compound exocytosis, while leaving most single-vesicle fusion events intact. We used this defect to show that this form of exocytosis is not only required to accelerate MC degranulation but also essential to achieve full degranulation. The exocytic defect was severe but not absolute, indicating that an Stx other than Stx3 and -4 is also required for exocytosis in MCs. The removal of Stx3 affected only regulated exocytosis, leaving other MC effector responses intact, including the secretion of cytokines via constitutive exocytosis. Our in vivo model of passive systemic anaphylaxis showed that the residual exocytic function of Stx3-deficient MCs was sufficient to drive a full anaphylactic response in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2904519075,"The overactivity of cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R) is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes. First-generation CB1R antagonists, such as rimonabant, offered therapeutic advantages for the control of obesity and related metabolic abnormalities, but their therapeutic potential was limited by undesirable neuropsychiatrie side effects. Here, we evaluated AJ5012 as a novel potent peripheral CB1R antagonist and, using this antagonist, investigated the role of peripheral CB1R on adipose tissue inflammation in obese mouse models. AJ5012 had a high degree of CB1R and cannabinoid 2 receptor selectivity but a low brain:plasma concentration ratio without eliciting centrally mediated neurobehavioral effects. In diet-induced obese (DIO) mice, AJ5012 did not reduce food intake but did induce a significant weight loss, likely owing to an increased energy expenditure. It was as effective as rimonabant for the improvement of hormonal or metabolic abnormalities, glycemic control, and insulin sensitivity. The treatment of DIO and leptin receptor–deficient mice with AJ5012 also exhibited effects comparable to rimonabant for the prevention of macrophage infiltration, activation of the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 inflammasome, and production of proinflammatory cytokines, which resulted in the suppression of adipose tissue inflammation. In addition to macrophage, activation of CB1R in 3T3-L1 adipocytes induced the expression of proinflammatory genes, which was fully inhibited by AJ5012. Our findings identified AJ5012 as a novel peripheral CB1R antagonist and suggest that peripheral CB1R blockade might break the links between insulin resistance and adipose tissue inflammation.—Han, J.

https://openalex.org/W2905172544,"While the rise in opioid analgesic prescribing and overdose deaths was multifactorial, financial relationships between opioid drug manufacturers and physicians may be one important factor.Using national data from 2013 to 2015, we conducted a retrospective cohort study linking the Open Payments database and Medicare Part D drug utilization data. We created two cohorts of physicians, those receiving opioid-related payments in 2014 and 2015, but not in 2013, and those receiving opioid-related payments in 2015 but not in 2013 and 2014. Our main outcome measures were expenditures on filled prescriptions, daily doses filled, and expenditures per daily dose. For each cohort, we created a comparison group that did not receive an opioid-related payment in any year and was matched on state, specialty, and baseline opioid expenditures. We used a difference-in-differences analysis with linear generalized estimating equations regression models.We identified 6,322 physicians who received opioid-related payments in 2014 and 2015, but not in 2013; they received a mean total of $251. Relative to comparison group physicians, they had a significantly larger increase in mean opioid expenditures ($6,171; 95% CI: 4,997 to 7,346), daily doses dispensed (1,574; 95%CI: 1,330 to 1,818) and mean expenditures per daily dose ($0.38; 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.47). We identified 8,669 physicians who received opioid-related payments in 2015, but not in 2013 or 2014; they received a mean total of $40. Relative to comparison physicians, they also had a larger increase in mean opioid expenditures ($1,031; 95% CI: 603 to 1,460), daily doses dispensed (557; 95% CI: 417 to 697), and expenditures per daily dose ($0.06; 95% CI: 0.002 to 0.13).Our findings add to the growing public policy concern that payments from opioid drug manufacturers can influence physician prescribing. Interventions are needed to reduce such promotional activities or to mitigate their influence."
https://openalex.org/W2904419372,"The renin–angiotensin cascade is a hormone system that regulates blood pressure and fluid balance. Renin-mediated cleavage of the angiotensin I peptide from the N terminus of angiotensinogen (AGT) is the rate-limiting step of this cascade; however, the detailed molecular mechanism underlying this step is unclear. Here, we solved the crystal structures of glycosylated human AGT (2.30 Å resolution), its encounter complex with renin (2.55 Å), AGT cleaved in its reactive center loop (RCL; 2.97 Å), and spent AGT from which the N-terminal angiotensin peptide was removed (2.63 Å). These structures revealed that AGT undergoes profound conformational changes and binds renin through a tail-into-mouth allosteric mechanism that inserts the N terminus into a pocket equivalent to a hormone-binding site on other serpins. These changes fully extended the N-terminal tail, with the scissile bond for angiotensin release docked in renin's active site. Insertion of the N terminus into this pocket accompanied a complete unwinding of helix H of AGT, which, in turn, formed key interactions with renin in the complementary binding interface. Mutagenesis and kinetic analyses confirmed that renin-mediated production of angiotensin I is controlled by interactions of amino acid residues and glycan components outside renin's active-site cleft. Our findings indicate that AGT adapts unique serpin features for hormone delivery and binds renin through concerted movements in the N-terminal tail and in its main body to modulate angiotensin release. These insights provide a structural basis for the development of agents that attenuate angiotensin release by targeting AGT's hormone binding pocket.

https://openalex.org/W2905222171,"One of the beneficial effects of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) has been a decrease in the incidence of non-invasive infections, such as otitis media (OM) caused by vaccine serotypes. In this study, we analyzed the epidemiology of pneumococcal OM before and after PCV13 introduction in 2010. Between 2008 and 2016, the middle ear exudates from 2653 children under 14 years of age with OM were studied in two Spanish provinces (Gipuzkoa and Barcelona), and S. pneumoniae was isolated in 235 (8.9%) of cases. The 204 available isolates were serotyped and distributed in three 3-year periods: one before and two after PCV13 introduction (early and late post-PCV13). A significant decrease in the rate of OM caused by S. pneumoniae was observed mainly due to a decrease in infections caused by all PCV13 serotypes, although exceptions were observed including the persistence of serotype 3 in Gipuzkoa and a weak re-emergence of serotype 19F in both regions. The rate and diversity of non-PCV13 serotypes increased in both regions and an emerging clone causing OM was detected in each region: serotype 23B ST2372 in Gipuzkoa and serotype 11A ST838/ST6521 in Barcelona. The introduction of PCV13 has been followed by a change in the epidemiology of pneumococcal OM, with a decrease in the rate of vaccine serotypes accompanied by an increase in the diversity of non-vaccine serotype and the clonal spreading of different single clones in each region."

Other bacterial species have also been shown to respond to PQS, supporting a common biophysical mechanism. Here, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the specific interactions between PQS and a model P. aeruginosa OM at the atomistic scale. We discovered two characteristic states of PQS interacting with the biologically relevant membrane, namely attachment to the membrane surface and insertion into the lipid A leaflet. The hydrogen bonds between PQS and the lipid A phosphates drove the PQS–membrane association. An analysis of PQS trajectory and molecular conformation revealed sequential events critical for spontaneous insertion, including probing, docking, folding, and insertion. Remarkably, PQS bent its hydrophobic side chain into a closed conformation to lower the energy barrier for penetration through the hydrophilic headgroup zone of the lipid A leaflet, which was confirmed by the potential of mean force (PMF) measurements.

This study examined factors associated with self-reported falls and balance/walking difficulty in the past 12 months in older survivors of four major cancers.This was a cross-sectional study analyzing population-based data from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (SEER-MHOS). Data from cohorts 9 to 14 (January 2006 to December 2013) were extracted. Inclusion criteria were: age ≥65 years at cancer diagnosis, first MHOS completed during years 1-5 post-cancer diagnosis, first primary breast (n = 2725), colorectal (n = 1646), lung (n = 752), and prostate (n = 4245) cancer, and availability of cancer staging information. Primary outcomes were self-reported falls and balance/walking difficulty in the past 12 months. Multivariable logistic regression was constructed for each cancer type to examine independent factors associated with falls and balance/walking difficulty.In all cancer types, advancing age at cancer diagnosis and dependence in activities of daily living were significant independent factors associated with increased odds of reporting falls and balance/walking difficulty in the past 12 months. Additionally, depression was independently associated with falls and sensory impairment in feet was independently linked to balance/walking difficulty in all cancer types. Other independent factors of falls and balance/walking difficulty varied across cancer types. In breast cancer only, localized or regional cancer stage was significantly associated with increased odds of reporting falls and balance/walking difficulty, whereas treatment with radiation decreased the odds of falling. No association between falls and balance/walking difficulty with time since cancer diagnosis, cancer stage, or cancer treatment was found in colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer.There exists some heterogeneity in factors associated with self-reported falls and balance/walking difficulty between different cancer types. Future research is necessary to ascertain factors predictive of falls and balance/walking difficulty in older cancer survivors, particularly factors related to cancer diagnosis and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2905374384,"Lake Baikal has been experiencing limnological changes from recent atmospheric warming since the 1950s, with rising lake water temperatures, reduced ice cover duration and reduced lake surface-water mixing due to stronger thermal stratification. This study uses lake sediment cores to reconstruct recent changes (c. past 20 years) in Lake Baikal’s pelagic diatom communities relative to previous 20th century diatom assemblage records collected in 1993 and 1994 at the same locations in the lake. Recent changes documented within the core-top diatom records agree with predictions of diatom responses to warming at Lake Baikal. Sediments in the south basin of the lake exhibit clear temporal changes, with the most rapid occurring in the 1990’s with shifts towards higher abundances of the cosmopolitan Synedra acus and a decline in endemic species, mainly Cyclotella minuta and Stephanodiscus meyerii and to a lesser extent Aulacoseira baicalensis and Aulacoseira skvortzowii. The north basin, in contrast, shows no evidence of recent diatom response to lake warming despite marked declines in north basin ice cover in recent decades. This study also shows no diatom-inferred evidence of eutrophication from deep water sediments. However, due to the localised impacts seen in areas of Lake Baikal’s shoreline from nutrient pollution derived from inadequate sewage treatment, urgent action is vital to prevent anthropogenic pollution extending into the open waters."

This qualitative study explored experiences of participation in music and theater among people with long-term mental illness. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with 11 participants in a music and theater workshop carried out in a Norwegian mental health hospital context. Through a hermeneutical-phenomenological analysis, three central themes emerged: (a) engaging in the moment, (b) reclaiming everyday life, and (c) dreaming of a future. The findings indicate that participation in music and theater provided an opportunity to focus on enjoyable mundane activities and demonstrate how arts have the potential to bring meaning and more specifically small positive moments into participants’ lives. Despite seeming to be small in nature, these moments appeared to be able to add pleasure and meaning to the lives of those experiencing them. Consequently, there is a need to raise professionals’ awareness of these small positive moments of meaning, the power these experiences carry, and how to facilitate arenas which can provide such moments for people with long-term mental illness."

The prevalence of anemia among pregnant women before conception is not well known in Tanzania. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, types, and risk factors of preconception anemia in women of reproductive age from a rural Tanzanian setting. Methods Trained field workers visited households to identify all female residents aged 18–40 years and invited them to the nearby health facility for screening and enrolment into this study. Baseline samples were collected to measure hemoglobin levels, serum ferritin, vitamin B12, folate, C-reactive protein, alanine amino-transferase, the presence of malaria, HIV, and soil transmitted helminth infections. Anthropometric and socio-economic data were recorded alongside with clinical information of participants. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the adjusted odds ratios (AOR) for the factors associated with preconception anemia. Findings Of 1248 women enrolled before conception, 36.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 34.1–39.4) had anemia (hemoglobin <12 g/dL) and 37.6% (95% CI 34.9–40.4) had iron deficiency. For more than half of the anemic cases, iron deficiency was also diagnosed (58.8%, 95% CI 54.2–63.3). Anemia was independently associated with increased age (AOR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03–1.07), malaria infection at enrolment (AOR 2.21, 95% CI 1.37–3.58), inflammation (AOR 1.77, 95% CI 1.21–2.60) and iron deficiency (AOR 4.68, 95% CI 3.55–6.17). The odds of anemia were reduced among women with increased mid-upper arm circumference (AOR 0.90, 95% CI 0.84–0.96). Conclusion Anemia among women of reproductive age before conception was prevalent in this rural setting. Increased age, iron deficiency, malaria infection and inflammation were significant risk factors associated with preconception anemia, whereas increased mid-upper arm circumference was protective against anemia. Interventions to ensure adequate iron levels as well as malaria control before conception are needed to prevent anemia before and during pregnancy and improve birth outcomes in this setting.

https://openalex.org/W2905179411,"Stomata are important indexes in studies of plant origin, evolution, and classification and are important organs in plant phylogenetic relationship studies. Nine Aleurites montana provenances were used in this study to examine stomatal density, stomatal area, stomatal perimeter, long axis length, and short axis length. The correlation and cluster analyses were conducted among the morphological parameters of the pores. The results showed that there were significant differences in different A. Montana provenances in terms of stomatal morphology parameters. The average stomatal density, stomatal area, stomatal perimeter, stomatal long axis length, and stomatal short axis length of each provenance was between 224.16–307.10 stomata/mm2, 80.42–99.76 μm, 36.39–41.32 μm, 15.89–18.44 μm, and 6.53–7.46 μm, respectively, and the coefficient of variation was between 9.18%–20.15%, 17.57%–33.77%, 9.31%–18.79%, 9.71%–18.48%, and 10.26%–21.57%, respectively. Correlation analysis shows that there was a significant negative correlation between stomatal density and stomatal shape parameters (stomatal area, stomatal perimeter, stomatal long axis, stomatal short axis) and there was a significant positive correlation between stomatal parameters. There was no significant correlation between geographical environment factors and stomatal characteristics. There is a close relationship between stomatal morphology and stomatal conductance whereby dense small stomata can quickly adapt to changes in the environment; considering the characteristics A. montana stomata in terms of stomatal stability and ability to adapt to the environment, the Jianyang, Zhenghe, Fuding, Shaxian provenances were identified as being more suitable for planting at different sites. This study provides a theoretical basis for the genetic improvement and breeding of high quality A. montana provenances."
https://openalex.org/W2903844067,"Background Parents play critical roles in adolescents’ sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and discussions between parents and adolescents on this topic are fundamental in reducing adolescents’ risky sexual behaviors. However, SRH communication is a challenging issue in Myanmar due to socio-cultural taboos. This study assessed the communication barriers towards SRH issues among mothers and their adolescent girls. Methods A community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted from January to December 2017 in Taunggyi Township, Southern Shan State, Myanmar. In total, 112 pairs of mothers and adolescent daughters were recruited using a face-to-face interview method with semi-structured questionnaires. Logistic regression analysis was applied to examine communication barriers on SRH issues between mothers and their adolescent girls. Results More than half of both mother and adolescent girls had negative perceptions of communication on SRH issues. Only 2.7% of girls discussed SRH issues with their mothers more than four times in the last six months. The factors found to create SRH communication barriers were higher family incomes (adjusted odd ration [AOR] 2.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0, 6.2), good knowledge of puberty (AOR 4.5, 95% CI 1.6, 12.5), good knowledge of sexual and reproductive health issues (AOR 4.5, 95% CI 1.8, 11.5), and positive perception of communication (AOR 6.7, 95% CI 2.5, 17.9) among mothers, and good knowledge of contraception (AOR 5.7, 95% CI 1.5, 21.4) and good knowledge of sexually transmitted infections (AOR 2.5, 95% CI 1.0, 6.4) among adolescent girls. Conclusion Mothers and adolescent girls communicated on SRHs was narrow, occurring infrequently and late, with only limited topics discussed. Having higher levels of SRH knowledge were more likely to create communication barriers among mother and adolescent girls. Policy makers need to consider targeted sexual and reproductive health education programs that can be implemented at the school and community levels to increase parent-adolescent communication."
https://openalex.org/W2905311385,"Calorie restriction (CR) delays aging and affects the circadian clocks by reprogramming circadian rhythms in gene expression. To expand on the circadian mechanisms in CR, we assayed rhythms in the protein translation by analyzing polysome-associated mRNAs in the liver of mice fed ad libitum (AL) and CR diets. Global comparison of the diets revealed that <1% of transcripts were differentially abundant in the polysomes. In contrast, the large differential, up to 10%, was detected when CR and AL diets were compared at individual times throughout the day. Most transcripts that were rhythmic under AL lost their rhythms, and many new transcripts gained rhythms under CR. Only a small fraction of transcripts, including the circadian clock genes, were rhythmic under both diets. Thus, CR strongly reprograms translation. CR affected translation of enzymes regulating long-chain acetyl-coenzyme A (Acyl-CoA) metabolism. The expression of the Acyl-CoA thioesterase (ACOT) family was induced upon CR, leading to the increased transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α, the transcriptional factor regulated by the ACOT products. We propose that the differential translation induced by CR leads to a temporal partition and reprogramming of metabolic processes and provides a link between CR, lipid metabolism, and the circadian clock.—Makwana, K., Gosai, N., Poe, A., Kondratov, R.

https://openalex.org/W2904263969,"Background Social relationships have been proposed as a significant factor shaping obesity risk. The first year of college, a period of major social, behavioral, and weight changes, provides a context well-suited to tracking longitudinally the impact of shifting friendships on weight outcomes. This study sought to identify social mechanisms impacting BMI change among emerging adults. Methods An analytic sample of 276 college students (71.0% female, 52.2% non-White) provided repeated reports of relationships and BMI was measured up to four times during 2015–2016. Stochastic actor-oriented models were used to examine change in BMI through social influence and change in friendships over time, controlling for sex and race/ethnicity. Results At baseline, mean BMI was 24.2±4.5 kg/m2. Overall, mean BMI increased over time; individual decreases in BMI were uncommon. There was a selection effect of BMI: participants with BMIs between 22 and 26 kg/m2 were most likely to be nominated as a friend. While participants did not select friends based on BMI similarity, participants who were reported as friends were more likely to experience convergence in BMI over time relative to the BMIs of non-friends (p = 0.015). An increase in BMI (versus stability or a decrease) was more likely for those whose friends had a higher BMI on average compared to participants whose friends had the same or lower BMI (OR = 2.85, 95% CI = 1.22, 6.71). Conclusion Analyses indicated BMI affected friend selection, not through students selecting friends with similar BMI, but rather, by students avoiding friends with more extreme BMI levels."
https://openalex.org/W2905398406,"Travelers are at high risk of acquiring multi-drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae (MRE) while traveling abroad. Acquisition of extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) while traveling has been extensively described, but not that of plasmid-mediated cephalosporinase producing Enterobacteriaceae (pAmpC-E). Here, we characterized the pAmpC-E acquired in 574 French travelers to tropical areas enrolled in the VOYAG-R study. Among the 526 MRE isolated at return, 57 (10.8%) from 49 travelers were pAmpC-E. The acquisition rate of pAmpC-E was 8.5% (49/574) ranging from 12.8% (25/195) in Asia, 7.6% (14/184) in Latin America to 5.1% (10/195) in Africa. The highest acquisition rates were observed in Peru (21.9%), India (21.4%) and Vietnam (20%). The carriage of pAmpC-E decreased quickly after return with 92.5% of colonized travelers being negative at one month. Most enzymes were CMY types (96.5%, n = 55, only met in Escherichia coli), including 40 CMY-2 (70.2%), 12 CMY-42 (21.1%), 1 CMY-6 and two new CMY-2 variants. The remaining were two DHA observed in Klebsiella pneumoniae. CMY-2 producing strains were acquired worldwide whereas CMY-42, except for one, were all acquired in Asia. BlaCMY-2 genes were associated with different plasmid types, including IncI1 (45. 2%), IncF (10%), IncF-IncI (7.5%), IncA/C (5%) and IncR (2.5%) whereas blaCMY-42 were all associated with IncI1 plasmids. Even though the pAmpC-E acquisition rate was much lower than that of ESBL-E, it was significant, especially in Asia, showing that pAmpC-E, especially CMY-type producing E. coli have spread in the community settings of tropical regions."
https://openalex.org/W2903964235,"Measurements of biogeochemical fluxes at the sediment–water interface are essential to investigate organic matter mineralization processes but are rarely performed in shallow coastal areas of the Antarctic. We investigated biogeochemical fluxes across the sediment–water interface in Potter Cove (King George Island/Isla 25 de Mayo) at water depths between 6–9 m. Total fluxes of oxygen and inorganic nutrients were quantified in situ. Diffusive oxygen fluxes were also quantified in situ, while diffusive inorganic nutrient fluxes were calculated from pore water profiles. Biogenic sediment compounds (concentration of pigments, total organic and inorganic carbon and total nitrogen), and benthic prokaryotic, meio-, and macrofauna density and biomass were determined along with abiotic parameters (sediment granulometry and porosity). The measurements were performed at three locations in Potter Cove, which differ in terms of sedimentary influence due to glacial melt. In this study, we aim to assess secondary effects of glacial melting such as ice scouring and particle release on the benthic community and the biogeochemical cycles they mediate. Furthermore, we discuss small-scale spatial variability of biogeochemical fluxes in shallow water depth and the required food supply to cover the carbon demand of Potter Cove’s shallow benthic communities. We found enhanced mineralization in soft sediments at one location intermediately affected by glacial melt-related effects, while a reduced mineralization was observed at a location influenced by glacial melting. The benthic macrofauna assemblage constituted the major benthic carbon stock (>87% of total benthic biomass) and was responsible for most benthic organic matter mineralization. However, biomass of the dominant Antarctic bivalve Laternula elliptica, which contributed 39–69% to the total macrofauna biomass, increased with enhanced glacial melt-related influence. This is contrary to the pattern observed for the remaining macrofauna. Our results further indicated that pelagic primary production is able to fully supply Potter Cove’s benthic carbon demand. Therefore, Potter Cove seems to be an autotrophic ecosystem in the summer season."
https://openalex.org/W2904381051,"Background Tuberculosis (TB) is the deadliest infectious disease globally. Current case finding approaches may miss many people with TB or detect them too late. Data and methods This study was a retrospective, spatial analysis of routine TB surveillance and cadastral data in Go Vap district, Ho Chi Minh City. We geocoded TB notifications from 2011 to 2015 and calculated theoretical yields of simulated door-to-door screening in three concentric catchment areas (50m, 100m, 200m) and three notification window scenarios (one, two and four quarters) for each index case. We calculated average yields, compared them to published reference values and fit a GEE (Generalized Estimating Equation) linear regression model onto the data. Results The sample included 3,046 TB patients. Adjusted theoretical yields in 50m, 100m and 200m catchment areas were 0.32% (95%CI: 0.27,0.37), 0.21% (95%CI: 0.14,0.29) and 0.17% (95%CI: 0.09,0.25), respectively, in the baseline notification window scenario. Theoretical yields in the 50m-catchment area for all notification window scenarios were significantly higher than a reference yield from literature. Yield was positively associated with treatment failure index cases (beta = 0.12, p = 0.001) and short-term inter-province migrants (beta = 0.06, p = 0.022), while greater distance to the DTU (beta = -0.02, p<0.001) was associated with lower yield. Conclusions This study is an example of inter-departmental collaboration and application of repurposed cadastral data to progress towards the end TB objectives. The results from Go Vap showed that the use of spatial analysis may be able to identify areas where targeted active case finding in Vietnam can help improve TB case detection."
https://openalex.org/W2904433712,"Many erythrocyte processes and pathways, including glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), KCl cotransport, ATP release, Na+/K+-ATPase activity, ankyrin–band 3 interactions, and nitric oxide (NO) release, are regulated by changes in O2 pressure that occur as a red blood cell (RBC) transits between the lungs and tissues. The O2 dependence of glycolysis, PPP, and ankyrin–band 3 interactions (affecting RBC rheology) are controlled by O2-dependent competition between deoxyhemoglobin (deoxyHb), but not oxyhemoglobin (oxyHb), and other proteins for band 3. We undertook the present study to determine whether the O2 dependence of Na+/K+/2Cl− cotransport (catalyzed by Na+/K+/2Cl− cotransporter 1 [NKCC1]) might similarly originate from competition between deoxyHb and a protein involved in NKCC1 regulation for a common binding site on band 3. Using three transgenic mouse strains having mutated deoxyhemoglobin-binding sites on band 3, we found that docking of deoxyhemoglobin at the N terminus of band 3 displaces the protein with no lysine kinase 1 (WNK1) from its overlapping binding site on band 3. This displacement enabled WNK1 to phosphorylate oxidative stress-responsive kinase 1 (OSR1), which, in turn, phosphorylated and activated NKCC1. Under normal solution conditions, the NKCC1 activation increased RBC volume and thereby induced changes in RBC rheology. Because the deoxyhemoglobin-mediated WNK1 displacement from band 3 in this O2 regulation pathway may also occur in the regulation of other O2-regulated ion transporters, we hypothesize that the NKCC1-mediated regulatory mechanism may represent a general pattern of O2 modulation of ion transporters in erythrocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2904010329,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is a clinically important pathogen responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Disruption of the host gut microbiota by antibiotics reduces the pulmonary resistance to S. pneumoniae. The aim of our study was to determine the potential role of TLR4 in the reduced pulmonary resistance to S. pneumoniae following gut microbiota disruption. Wild-type and TLR4-deficient mice were given broad-spectrum antibiotics for 3 weeks by oral gavage to disrupt the gut microbiota, and subsequently inoculated intra-nasally with S. pneumoniae. The extent of the decline in pulmonary resistance in both animal groups was evaluated in terms of the overall survival and pulmonary bacterial clearance. Both survival and pulmonary clearance of S. pneumoniae were lower in the TLR4-deficient mice with disrupted gut microbiota, compared to their intestinally healthy counterparts after pneumococcal infection. However, the degree of decline was much lower in the TLR4-deficient mice compared to the wild-type mice. Our findings indicate that impaired TLR4 function might be the basis of the reduced pulmonary resistance to S. pneumoniae caused by gut microbiota disruption."
https://openalex.org/W2904256670,"Reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) is a popular adopted technique to detect gene expression, and the selection of appropriate reference genes is crucial for data normalization. In the present study, seven candidate reference genes were screened to evaluate their expression stability in various flower buds, leaf buds, tissues and cultivars of the English walnut (Juglans regia L.) based on four algorithms (geNorm, Normfinder, Bestkeeper and RefFinder). The results demonstrated that TUA, EF1 and TUB were appropriate reference genes for flower buds at different stages of female flower buds differentiation; TUB and 18S rRNA were best for leaf buds at different stages of female flower buds differentiation; TUB and TUA were suitable for different cultivars; and ACT2, 18S rRNA and GAPDH were useful for different tissues. Moreover, the expression of ACT was not stable among different flower buds, leaf buds and cultivars. The stability of reference genes were confirmed through the analysis of the expression of SPL18 gene. These results will contribute to a reliable normalization of gene expression in J. regia."
https://openalex.org/W2904714032,"Background Stating preferences about care beforehand using advance care planning and advance directives has become increasingly common in current medicine. There is still lack of clarity what happens over the course of time in relation to these preferences. We wanted to determine whether the preferences about end-of-life care of a person owning an advance directive stay stable after the experience of a life-event; how often advance directives are altered and discussed with family members and physicians over time. Design A longitudinal cohort study with a population consisting of people owning the most common advance directives in the Netherlands, with a follow-up of 6-years from 2005 until 2011. Respondents were recruited using two associations that provided the advance directives, Right to Die-NL (n = 4463) and the Dutch Patient Organisation (n = 1263). Each 1.5 year a questionnaire was sent. We analyzed the relationship between variables using generalized estimated equations. Results 96.9–98.1% of the respondents who had experienced a life-event had stable preferences. 89.9–93.7% of Right-to-Die-NL-members who had experienced a life-event didn’t make any alterations in their advance directives. During the 6-year course of our study, a minority of both groups didn’t discuss their advance directive with anyone (8.7–16.4%), while a majority didn’t discuss it with physicians (ranging 58.1–95.1%). Factors related to health, such as deterioration in experienced health, increased the odds to discuss advance directives. Conclusion Our results largely dispute criticism concerning usability of advance directives due to lack of stability of preferences. Whereas a change in health status and the experience of other life-events were not related to instability in preferences, they did increase the odds of communication about advance directives. Because our results show that the possession of an advance directive does not necessarily result in frequent discussions between patients and caregivers, a more structured approach like advance care planning might be a solution."
https://openalex.org/W2903905957,"The regulatory subunit of human DNA primase has a C-terminal domain (p58C) that contains a [4Fe4S] cluster and binds DNA. Previous electrochemical analysis of a p58C construct revealed that its affinity for DNA is sensitive to the redox state of the [4Fe4S] cluster. Concerns about the validity of this conclusion have been raised, based in part on differences in X-ray crystal structures of the p58C272-464 construct used for that study and that of a N-terminally shifted p58C266-456 construct and consequently, an assumption that p58C272-464 has abnormal physical and functional properties. To address this controversy, a new p58C266-464 construct containing all residues was crystallized under the conditions previously used for crystallizing p58C272-464, and the solution structures of both constructs were assessed using circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy. In the new crystal structure, p58C266-464 exhibits the same elements of secondary structure near the DNA binding site as observed in the crystal structure of p58C272-464. Moreover, in solution, circular dichroism and 15N,1H-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectra show there are no significant differences in the distribution of secondary structures or in the tertiary structure or the two constructs. To validate that the two constructs have the same functional properties, binding of a primed DNA template was measured using a fluorescence-based DNA binding assay, and the affinities for this substrate were the same (3.4 ± 0.5 μM and 2.7 ± 0.3 μM, respectively). The electrochemical properties of p58C266-464 were also measured and this p58C construct was able to engage in redox switching on DNA with the same efficiency as p58C272-464. Together, these results show that although p58C can be stabilized in different conformations in the crystalline state, in solution there is effectively no difference in the structure and functional properties of p58C constructs of different lengths."
https://openalex.org/W2905179001,"Professional football is a globalized game in which players are the most valuable assets for clubs. In this study, we explore the evolution of the football players’ transfer network among 21 European first leagues between the seasons 1996/1997 and 2015/2016. From a topological point of view, we show that this network achieved an upper limit expansion around season 2007/2008, thereafter becoming more connected and dense. Using a machine learning approach based on Self-Organizing Maps and Principal Component Analysis we confirm that European competitions, such as the UEFA Champions League or UEFA Europa League, are indeed a “money game” where the clubs with the highest transfer spending achieve better sportive performance. Some clubs’ transfer market activities also affect domestic performance. We conclude from our findings that the relationship between transfer spending and domestic or international sportive performance might lead to substantial inequality between clubs and leagues, while potentially creating a virtuous (vicious) circle in which these variables reinforce (weaken) each other."
https://openalex.org/W2905451798,"Background Kenya is 1 of 14 priority countries in Africa scaling up voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) for HIV prevention following the recommendations of the World Health Organization and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. To inform VMMC target setting, we modeled the impact of circumcising specific client age groups across several Kenyan geographic areas. Methods The Decision Makers’ Program Planning Tool, Version 2 (DMPPT 2) was applied in Kisumu, Siaya, Homa Bay, and Migori counties. Initial modeling done in mid-2016 showed coverage estimates above 100% in age groups and geographic areas where demand for VMMC continued to be high. On the basis of information obtained from country policy makers and VMMC program implementers, we adjusted circumcision coverage for duplicate reporting, county-level population estimates, migration across county boundaries for VMMC services, and replacement of traditional circumcision with circumcisions in the VMMC program. To address residual inflated coverage following these adjustments we applied county-specific correction factors computed by triangulating model results with coverage estimates from population surveys. Results A program record review identified duplicate reporting in Homa Bay, Kisumu, and Siaya. Using county population estimates from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, we found that adjusting for migration and correcting for replacement of traditional circumcision with VMMC led to lower estimates of 2016 male circumcision coverage especially for Kisumu, Migori, and Siaya. Even after addressing these issues, overestimation of 2016 male circumcision coverage persisted, especially in Homa Bay. We estimated male circumcision coverage in 2016 by applying correction factors. Modeled estimates for 2016 circumcision coverage for the 10- to 14-year age group ranged from 50% in Homa Bay to approximately 90% in Kisumu. Results for the 15- to 19-year age group suggest almost complete coverage in Kisumu, Migori, and Siaya. Coverage for the 20- to 24-year age group ranged from about 80% in Siaya to about 90% in Homa Bay, coverage for those aged 25–29 years ranged from about 60% in Siaya to 80% in Migori, and coverage in those aged 30–34 years ranged from about 50% in Siaya to about 70% in Migori. Conclusions Our analysis points to solutions for some of the data issues encountered in Kenya. Kenya is the first country in which these data issues have been encountered because baseline circumcision rates were high. We anticipate that some of the modeling methods we developed for Kenya will be applicable in other countries."
https://openalex.org/W2905523970,"Introduction Despite the global rise in waterpipe tobacco smoking (WTS), the effectiveness of waterpipe tobacco health warnings remain understudied, especially in countries with high WTS rates. Egypt has been employing waterpipe tobacco labelling for a decade, however, their effectiveness is unknown. Our overall aim was to measure the effectiveness of pictorial health warnings (PHWs) on waterpipe tobacco packs (WTPs) through participant memory recall and to investigate whether they induced behavioural responses in waterpipe smokers and deterred uptake of WTS in non-smokers, examining the differentials of effectiveness among socio-demographic subgroups. Subjects and methods We conducted two surveys including 1490 adult current waterpipe smokers, 73 former waterpipe smokers, and 451 non-smokers in Cairo and a rural village in Egypt between 2015–2017. Participants who noticed PHWs on WTPs were asked questions about salience, communication of health risks, public support, cognitive processing, and self-reported behavioural responses (current waterpipe smokers: reduce consumption, forgo a smoke, quit attempts; former waterpipe smokers: quit; non-smokers: deter WTS initiation). Univariate and multivariable statistical analyses were performed. Results Participants’ mean age was 35 years, mostly males (90.4%), waterpipe smokers (74.0%) and rural residents (59.3%). Approximately two-thirds of participants noticed PHWs on WTPs. Salience was significantly less among females, urban residents and participants with high literacy. More than three-quarters of participants reported that WTS health risks were communicated through the warnings. At least half of participants cognitively processed the warnings: 56.3% thought of the warnings when WTPs were out of sight; non-smokers understood the warnings (83.2%) and discussed them with others (90.3%) significantly more than current (76.0% and 72.5%, respectively) and former waterpipe smokers (81.0% and 61.9%, respectively). Participants reported that PHWs on WTPs motivated 58.5% of waterpipe smokers to think about quitting; 64.5% to reduce their consumption; 42.2% to forgo a smoke; 24.5% to attempt to quit; 57.1% of former waterpipe smokers to successfully quit; and 59.3% of non-smokers to remain smoke-free. Conclusions Findings suggest that inserting PHWs on WTPs is an effective waterpipe tobacco labelling policy. Countries with similarly high rates of WTS should consider adopting WTP PHWs within a comprehensive regulatory framework."
https://openalex.org/W2905545651,"Cutaneous mast cell tumours are one of the most common canine cancers. Approximately 25% of the tumours metastasise. Activating c-kit mutations are present in about 20% of tumours, but metastases occur in the absence of mutations. Tumour metastasis is associated with significantly diminished survival in spite of adjuvant chemotherapy. Available prognostic tests do not reliably predict whether a tumour will metastasise. In this study we compared the global expression profiles of 20 primary cutaneous mast cell tumours that metastasised with those of 20 primary tumours that did not metastasise. The objective was to identify genes associated with mast cell tumour metastatic progression that may represent targets for therapeutic intervention and biomarkers for prediction of tumour metastasis. Canine Gene 1.1 ST Arrays were employed for genome-wide expression analysis of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsies of mast cell tumours borne by dogs that either died due to confirmed mast cell tumour metastasis, or were still alive more than 1000 days post-surgery. Decreased gene expression in the metastasising tumours appears to be associated with a loss of cell polarity, reduced cell-cell and cell-ECM adhesion, and increased cell deformability and motility. Dysregulated gene expression may also promote extracellular matrix and base membrane degradation, suppression of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Down-regulation of gene expression in the metastasising tumours may be achieved at least in part by small nucleolar RNA-derived RNA and microRNA-effected gene silencing. Employing cross-validation, a linear discriminant analysis-based classifier featuring 19 genes that displayed two-fold differences in expression between metastasising and non-metastasising tumours was estimated to classify metastasising and non-metastasising tumours with accuracies of 90–100% and 70–100%, respectively. The differential expression of 9 of the discriminator genes was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR."
https://openalex.org/W2904498792,"The conserved Rho-family GTPase Cdc42 is a master regulator of polarity establishment in many cell types. Cdc42 becomes activated and concentrated in a region of the cell cortex, and recruits a variety of effector proteins to that site. In turn, many effectors participate in regulation of cytoskeletal elements in order to remodel the cytoskeleton in a polarized manner. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has served as a tractable model system for studies of cell polarity. In yeast cells, Cdc42 polarization involves a positive feedback loop in which effectors called p21-activated kinases (PAKs) act to recruit a Cdc42-directed guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), generating more GTP-Cdc42 in areas that already have GTP-Cdc42. The GTPase-interacting components (GICs) Gic1 and Gic2 are also Cdc42 effectors, and have been implicated in regulation of the actin and septin cytoskeleton. However, we report that cells lacking GICs are primarily defective in polarizing Cdc42 itself, suggesting that they act upstream as well as downstream of Cdc42 in yeast. Our findings suggest that feedback pathways involving GTPase effectors may be more prevalent than had been appreciated."
https://openalex.org/W2904526025,"Research suggests that frequent empathic engagement with others in distress places helpers in registered professional roles (e.g. medical practitioners, psychologists) at risk of functional impairment related to symptoms of psychological distress, including the delivery of sub-optimal care to patients. Preliminary research suggests that telephone crisis support workers may also be impacted in a similar way. This repeated measures study is the first known research to examine telephone crisis support workers’ functional impairment related to symptoms of psychological distress before and after speaking with callers in crisis. A representative sample of telephone crisis support workers from Lifeline Australia participated by completing three surveys: 1) directly before; 2) directly after; and 3) one week after completing a shift on the national crisis line. Surveys included standardised measures of functional impairment, psychological distress, lived experience of mental health issues and suicide, motivations for volunteering, coping strategies and help-seeking. Categorical items were used to assess personal and shift-related factors. Repeated measures analyses of variance were used to identify changes in symptoms of psychological distress and impairment across time points. Structural equation modelling was used to test relationships within a hypothesised model of impairment. A significant proportion of participants reported functional impairment related to symptoms of psychological distress. Significant differences in functional impairment and symptoms of psychological distress were detected, and were associated with different mechanisms, across time points. An important outcome of this study is empirically-supported models which explain how telephone crisis support workers come to experience functional impairment in relation to their TCS role, as well as other work/study, home/family and social/leisure activities. Results warrant the deliberate development and/or modification of existing service strategies to optimise telephone crisis support workers’ psychological wellbeing and functioning, including by structuring the work environment and emphasising certain messages during training and supervision."
https://openalex.org/W2904586118,"Pacific Halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) support culturally and economically important fisheries in the Gulf of Alaska, though recent decreases in mean size-at-age have substantially reduced fishery yields, generating concerns among stakeholders and resource managers. Among the prevailing hypotheses for reduced size-at-age is intensified competition with Arrowtooth Flounder (Atheresthes stomias), a groundfish predator that exhibited nearly five-fold increases in biomass between the 1960s and mid-2010s. To assess the potential for competition between Pacific Halibut and Arrowtooth Flounder, we evaluated their degree of spatiotemporal and dietary overlap in the Gulf of Alaska using bottom trawl survey and food habits data provided by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (NOAA; 1990 to 2017). We restricted analyses to fish measuring 30 to 69 cm fork length and used a delta modeling approach to quantify species-specific presence-absence and catch-per-unit-effort as a function of survey year, tow location, depth, and bottom temperature. We then calculated an index of spatial overlap across a uniform grid by multiplying standardized predictions of species’ abundance. Dietary overlap was calculated across the same uniform grid using Schoener’s similarity index. Finally, we assessed the relationship between spatial and dietary overlap as a measure of resource partitioning. We found increases in spatial overlap, moving from east to west in the Gulf of Alaska (eastern: 0.13 ± 0.20; central: 0.21 ± 0.11; western: 0.31 ± 0.13 SD). Dietary overlap was low throughout the study area (0.13 ± 0.20 SD). There was no correlation between spatial and dietary overlap, suggesting an absence of resource partitioning along the niche dimensions examined. This finding provides little indication that competition with Arrowtooth Flounder was responsible for changes in Pacific Halibut alHHsize-at-age in the Gulf of Alaska; however, it does not rule out competitive interactions that may have affected resource use prior to standardized data collection or at different spatiotemporal scales."
https://openalex.org/W2905588591,"Mammalian gene expression is a complex process regulated in part by CpG methylation. The ability to target methylation for de novo gene regulation could have therapeutic and research applications. We have previously developed a dCas9-MC/MN protein for targeting CpG methylation. dCas9-MC/MN is composed of an artificially split M.SssI methyltransferase (MC/MN), with the MC fragment fused to a nuclease-null CRISPR/Cas9 (dCas9). Guide RNAs directed dCas9-MC/MN to methylate target sites in E. coli and human cells but also caused some low-level off-target methylation. Here, in E. coli, we show that shortening the dCas9-MC linker increases methylation of CpG sites located at select distances from the dCas9 binding site. Although a shortened linker decreased methylation of other CpGs proximal to the target site, it did not reduce off-target methylation of more distant CpG sites. Instead, targeted mutagenesis of the methyltransferase’s DNA binding domain, designed to reduce DNA affinity, significantly and preferentially reduced methylation of such sites."
https://openalex.org/W2904447437,"Objective We tested whether the severity of depressive symptoms in acute stroke and 4 years later are predictors of long-time survival. Method We evaluated the severity of stroke in 82 patients with acute stroke by the Barthel index, the Scandinavian Stroke Scale and the Orgogozo scale, and we also quantified the severity of depressive symptoms by the Beck and the Hamilton scales in the first week of stroke, in 1995. We re-evaluated the scales 4 years after stroke in 41 out of 48 survivors. We checked the survival status of the initial cohort 18 years after stroke. In the assessment Kaplan-Meier graphs were constructed and the outcomes between groups were compared with log-rank tests. Results Clinically important depressive symptoms (≥10 on the Beck scale) was present in 16 patients (19,5%) with acute stroke one week after admission. Case fatality was 41% at 4 years and 84% at 18 years after stroke. Those patients who survived at 4 years were significantly younger (p<0,05). Depressive symptoms in acute stage were not independent predictor of the length of survival. More severe strokes were associated with more severe depressive symptoms 4 years after stroke. In the survival subgroup of patients, those who had more severe depression (≥10 on the Beck scale) at 4 years, had shorter post-stroke survival than those with milder or no depression (Mann-Whitney test, p = 0.022; log-rank-test, p = 0.047). In multivariate analyses, adjusted for age, sex, stroke severity and the severity of depressive symptoms, age, sex and stroke severity remained the significant predictors of the length of survival. Conclusions The severity of depressive symptoms either in the acute phase or 4 years after stroke is not an independent predictor of the length of survival in an 18-year follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W2904508040,"Objectives Admission rates have increased in China, despite the fact that accessibility to primary care is improving. Hospital care could be cost-inefficient, and little is currently known about the appropriateness of admissions to tertiary hospitals in China. This study aims to measure the extent of inappropriate admissions in the cardiology and orthopedics departments of a tertiary hospital in Shanghai, to explore the factors associated with inappropriateness for each department, and to identify the causes of inappropriate admissions. Methods The records of inpatients discharged on randomly sampled two days each week during March 2013 to February 2014 from the two departments were extracted. Two reviewers were recruited to assess the records according to the Chinese version of the Appropriateness Evaluation Protocol (C-AEP). Demographic, socio-economic, and other admissions-related variables were collected. Logistic regression analysis was adopted to determine the associated factors of inappropriateness. Results 35.0% (N = 120) of the 343 admissions and 38.7% (N = 179) of the 463 admissions of the cardiology and orthopedics departments were not justified by the C-AEP, respectively. Age (OR = 0.717), self-pay (OR = 3.752), admission via outpatient sector (OR = 5.332), and readmission (OR = 2.501) were identified as factors affecting the appropriateness of admissions in the cardiology department. Age (OR = 0.930), self-pay (OR = 2.597), admission during 12:00–17:59 (OR = 3.211), and admission via outpatient sector (OR = 7.060) were determined to be associated with appropriateness of admission in the orthopedics department. The main reason for inappropriateness was premature admission for both departments. Conclusions The magnitude of inappropriate admissions was considerable in the departments. To improve appropriateness, the results suggest that further interventions should be focused on both external and internal factors."
https://openalex.org/W2904865648,"Insulin-induced gene 1 (INSIG1) regulates sterol synthesis by mediating the activation of sterol regulatory element–binding protein (SREBP) and the degradation of the HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR). INSIG1 is up-regulated during HIV-1 infection, but its role in HIV-1 infection is unknown. In this report, using pseudovirus production, protein overexpression, and gene knockouts, we found that INSIG1 inhibits HIV-1 production by accelerating the degradation of the HIV-1 Gag protein. Unlike the degradation of HMGCR via the E3 ubiquitin ligase autocrine motility factor receptor (AMFR), a process that depends on the proteasome, INSIG1 coordinated with another ligase, translocation in renal carcinoma chromosome 8 (TRC8), and promoted Gag degradation through the lysosome pathway. We conclude that INSIG1 functions as a sentinel responsive to HIV-1 production and inhibits HIV-1 replication by degrading Gag, a process occurring at intracellular membrane sites such as the endoplasmic reticulum and endosomes where both INSIG1 and Gag may be located."
https://openalex.org/W2904581960,"Group B Streptococcus (GBS) colonizes the human lower intestinal and genital tracts and constitutes a major threat to neonates from pregnant carrier mothers and to adults with underlying morbidity. The pathogen expresses cell-surface virulence factors that enable cell adhesion and penetration and that counteract innate and adaptive immune responses. Among these, the complement interfering protein (CIP) was recently described for its capacity to interact with the human C4b ligand and to interfere with the classical- and lectin-complement pathways. In the present study, we provide evidence that CIP can also interact with C3, C3b, and C3d. Immunoassay-based competition experiments showed that binding of CIP to C3d interferes with the interaction between C3d and the complement receptor 2/cluster of differentiation 21 (CR2/CD21) receptor on B cells. By B-cell intracellular signaling assays, CIP was confirmed to down-regulate CR2/CD21-dependent B-cell activation. The CIP domain involved in C3d binding was mapped via hydrogen deuterium exchange–mass spectrometry. The data obtained reveal a new role for this GBS polypeptide at the interface between the innate and adaptive immune responses, adding a new member to the growing list of virulence factors secreted by gram-positive pathogens that incorporate multiple immunomodulatory functions.—Giussani, S., Pietrocola, G., Donnarumma, D., Norais, N., Speziale, P., Fabbrini, M., Margarit, I.

https://openalex.org/W2905472150,"Background Major depression is a prevalent mental disorder with a high risk of relapse or recurrence. Only few studies have focused on the cost-effectiveness of interventions aimed at the prevention of relapse or recurrence of depression in primary care. Aim To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a supported Self-help Preventive Cognitive Therapy (S-PCT) added to treatment-as-usual (TAU) compared with TAU alone for patients with a history of depression, currently in remission. Methods An economic evaluation alongside a multi-center randomised controlled trial was performed (n = 248) over a 12-month follow-up. Outcomes included relapse or recurrence of depression and quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) based on the EuroQol-5D. Analyses were performed from both a societal and healthcare perspective. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputations. Uncertainty was estimated using bootstrapping and presented using the cost-effectiveness plane and the Cost-Effectiveness Acceptability Curve (CEAC). Cost estimates were adjusted for baseline costs. Results S-PCT statistically significantly decreased relapse or recurrence by 15% (95%CI 3;28) compared to TAU. Mean total societal costs were €2,114 higher (95%CI -112;4261). From a societal perspective, the ICER for relapse or recurrence was 13,515. At a Willingness To Pay (WTP) of 22,000 €/recurrence prevented, the probability that S-PCT is cost-effective, in comparison with TAU, is 80%. The ICER for QALYs was 63,051. The CEA curve indicated that at a WTP of 30,000 €/QALY gained, the probability that S-PCT is cost-effective compared to TAU is 21%. Conclusions Though ultimately depending on the WTP of decision makers, we expect that for both relapse or recurrence and QALYs, S-PCT cannot be considered cost-effective compared to TAU."
https://openalex.org/W2904713095,"Knockdown of the suppression of tumorigenicity 14-encoding type II transmembrane serine protease matriptase (MTP) in neural stem/progenitor (NS/P) cells impairs cell mobility, response to chemo-attractants, and neurovascular niche interaction. In the present study, we showed by Western blot that a portion of MTP can be detected in the mitochondrial fraction of mouse NS/P cells by immunostaining that it is co-stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) inside the cells. Co-immunoprecipitation showed that MTP is bound to the β subunit of mitochondrial F0F1-ATP synthase complex (ATP-β). Cyto-immunofluorescence staining and an in situ proximity ligation assay further confirmed a physical interaction between MTP and ATP-β. This interaction relied on the presence of both Cls/Clr urchin embryonic growth factor, bone morphogenic protein 1 and low-density lipoprotein receptor motifs of MTP. We found that NS/P cell mitochondrial membrane potential is impaired by MTP knockdown, and ATP synthesis and oxygen consumption rate are significantly reduced in MTP-knockdown NS/P cells. Among the oxidative phosphorylation functions, the greatest effect of MTP knockdown is the reduction by over 50% in the mitochondrial energy reserve capacity. This made MTP-knockdown NS/P cells unable to overcome hydrogen peroxide stress, which leads to cessation of cell growth. This work identifies 2 previously unknown functions for MTP: first as a binding protein in the mitochondrial F1F0-ATP synthase complex and second as a regulatory mechanism of mitochondrial bioenergetics. Mitochondrial MTP may serve a protective function for NS/P cells in response to stress.-Fang, J.-D., Tung, H.-H., Lee, S.-L. Mitochondrial localization of St14-encoding transmembrane serine protease is involved in neural stem/progenitor cell bioenergetics through binding to F0F1-ATP synthase complex."
https://openalex.org/W2904939444,"As a useful technology, the horizontal drilling for underground coalmine has been applied in many fields such as gas drainage, water control, exploration and accurate drilling borehole engineering. In this paper, the annulus tubes are used to simulate the fluid transportation process between drilling rod and casing tube when drilling horizontally. The main goal of this research is to analyze the effects of eccentricity, fluid velocity, outer tube length and volume fraction on dynamic characteristics of partially liquid-filled annulus tube in a drillstring system. According to the Euler-Bernoulli beam model, the partially liquid-filled inner tube model and outer tube model are established respectively when considering the effect of transport fluid inside the annulus tubes. Based on the vibration characteristics of the tube, the added mass coefficient is proposed to calculate the natural frequencies of the outer tubes. And natural frequency is the frequency at which a system tends to oscillate in the absence of any driving or damping force. According to the compared results of experiments and simulations, the natural characteristics of outer tube depend on the tube design parameter (outer tube length) and the volume fraction of liquid filled in the outer tube. Furthermore, experiments have verified that the natural frequencies of the outer tubes can be directly calculated from the length of outer tubes. Therefore, it is feasible to propose the method of attaching liquid mass to tube mass to obtain the natural frequencies of outer tubes. According to the results, it can be concluded that: (i) The natural frequencies of tube decrease as the length of the tube increases; (ii) The increase of volume fraction of liquid in the tube can significantly reduce the natural frequencies of tube; (iii) The fluid velocity and eccentricity have less effects on the natural frequencies of tube; (ⅳ) The added mass coefficient of outer tubes can be calculated and it is not a fixed value, it varies with the volume fraction of fluid in annulus tubes. In this work, the inner and outer tube models are established respectively for fluid transportation process between a horizontal drilling rod and casing tube. The effects of four factors on the natural frequencies are compared, and the concept of added mass coefficient is proposed to obtain reasonable tube natural frequencies."
https://openalex.org/W2904947127,"Subanaesthetic ketamine has recently been proven to be a highly effective and fast acting alternative treatment for several psychiatric disorders. The mechanisms responsible for ketamine’s antidepressant effects remain unclear, but a possible explanation could be that ketamine interacts with regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). Therefore, the effects of two subanaesthetic ketamine doses on rCBF were evaluated. Twelve dogs were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment conditions (condition saline, condition 0.5 mg/kg ketamine or condition 2 mg/kg ketamine) and received in total five saline or ketamine infusions, with one week interval. Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) scans with the radiotracer 99mTc-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime were performed before the start of the infusions (baseline) and 24 hours after the first (single) and last (multiple) infusion. After a wash out period of 3 months, the animals were again assigned to one of the three treatment conditions described above and the infusion/scan protocol was repeated. During the infusions, cardiovascular parameters were evaluated every ten minutes. A one-way repeated measure ANOVA was set up to assess perfusion index for each ketamine dose for the left frontal cortex (alpha = 0.05). The remaining 11 brain regions were post hoc assessed. Perfusion index was significantly increased in the left frontal cortex and in the thalamus 24 hours after single and multiple ketamine infusions compared to baseline in the 2 mg/kg condition. No clinically relevant cardiovascular effects were observed during the ketamine infusions. This study shows that subanaesthetic ketamine can increase neuronal perfusion and therefore alter neuronal function in brain regions involved in depression and anxiety disorders. These perfusion increases may possibly contribute to ketamine’s beneficial effects in these psychiatric disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2905180189,"Infection with Schistosoma mansoni is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in endemic areas, and is increasingly diagnosed in migrants and travellers outside transmission areas. Markers for the assessment of morbidity and impact of control programs in endemic areas and for the clinical management of patients in the clinical setting are scant, especially for intestinal involvement. Ultrasonography is well established to evaluate hepatosplenic pathology; on the contrary, ultrasound evaluation of intestinal schistosomiasis is virtually unexplored. In this pilot study, we aimed to describe and evaluate the accuracy of unenhanced intestinal ultrasound for morbidity due to intestinal S. mansoni infection.We performed a blind case-control study of unenhanced intestinal ultrasound on 107 adults accessing the outpatient clinic of our Centre for Tropical Diseases between January-July 2018 as part of a screening for tropical diseases in migrants and travellers returning from endemic areas. Other clinical and laboratory data were obtained routine examination reports. We could not find any overtly pathological thickness of the gut wall in the sigma, proximal ascending colon, and terminal ileum, in patients with S. mansoni infection (n = 17), S. haematobium infection (n = 7), positive anti-Schistosoma serology (n = 31), and uninfected individuals (n = 52), with no difference among groups as assessed by ANOVA. No polyps or other intestinal abnormalities were visualized. There was no significant change in gut wall thickness one month after treatment with praziquantel in patients with S. mansoni infection (n = 11).Our preliminary results suggest that intestinal ultrasound might not be a sensitive tool for detecting minor intestinal morbidity due to schistosomiasis. Further studies in a hospital setting comparing colonoscopy and ultrasonography may be envisaged; in endemic areas, further studies are needed to describe and assess the usefulness of intestinal ultrasound in patients stratified by infection intensity and compared with markers such as calprotectin and fecal occult blood."
https://openalex.org/W2952831392,"Key to pharmacovigilance is spontaneously reporting all Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) during post-market surveillance. This facilitates the identification and evaluation of previously unreported ADR's, acknowledging the trade-off between benefits and potential harm of medications. Only 41% Antiretroviral (ARV) ADR's documented in Harare city clinical records for January to December 2016 were reported to Medicines Control Authority of Zimbabwe (MCAZ). We investigated reasons contributing to underreporting of ARV ADR's in Harare city.A descriptive cross-sectional study and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guided surveillance evaluation was conducted. Two hospitals were purposively included. Seventeen health facilities and 52 health workers were randomly selected. Interviewer-administered questionnaires, key informant interviews and WHO pharmacovigilance checklists were used to collect data. Likert scales were applied to draw inferences and Epi info 7 used to generate frequencies and proportions.Of the 52 participants, 32 (61.5%) distinguished the ARV ADR defining criteria. Twenty-nine (55.8%) knew system's purpose whilst 28 (53.8%) knew the reporting process. Knowledge scored average on the 5-point-Likert scale. Thirty-eight (73.1%) participants identified ARV ADR's following client complaints and nine (1.3%) enquired clients' medication response. Forty-six (88.5%) cited non-feedback from MCAZ for underreporting. Inadequate ARV ADR identification skills were cited by 21 (40.4%) participants. Reporting forms were available in five (26.3%) facilities and reports were generated from hospitals only. Forty-two (90.6%) clinicians made therapeutic decisions from ARV ADR's. Averaged usefulness score was 4, on the 5-point-Likert scale. All 642 generated signals were committed to Vigiflow by MCAZ, reflecting a case detection rate of 4/ 100 000. Data quality was 0.75-1.0 (WHO) and all reports were causally assessed.The pharmacovigilance system was useful, simple, and acceptable despite being unstable, not representative and not sensitive. It was threatened by suboptimal health worker knowledge, weak detection strategies and referral policy preventing ARV ADR identification by person place and time. Revisiting local policy, advocacy, communication and health worker orientation might improve pharmacovigilance performance in Harare city."
https://openalex.org/W2903992077,"The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that individuals with higher Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) scores would be more permissive of pragmatic impairments than those with lower AQ scores. We investigated the presence of a correlation between the AQ scores of mothers with children in grades 1 to 6 and their evaluation of assumed pragmatic impairments in children using the Maternal Evaluation of Pragmatic Impairments in Children (MEPC) measure. Mothers were asked to rate how they would feel if their child showed the communication behaviors listed in scales D (coherence), E (inappropriate initiation), F (stereotyped language), G (use of context), and H (nonverbal communication) of the Children's Communication Checklist-2, which measures pragmatic impairments. All responses were given on a five-point Likert scale. The results indicated that the higher the maternal AQ score, the less the mother tended to evaluate pragmatic impairments as a problem. We also examined whether the age and gender of assumed children influenced the correlation between AQ and MEPC scores, but found no significant correlation. The partial correlation coefficients were calculated for each subscale, none of which was significant. A negative correlation was found between AQ and MEPC scores as a whole."
https://openalex.org/W2904586551,"Current neuroscientific models of bodily self-consciousness (BSC) argue that inaccurate integration of sensory signals leads to altered states of BSC. Indeed, using virtual reality technology, observers viewing a fake or virtual body while being exposed to tactile stimulation of the real body, can experience illusory ownership over-and mislocalization towards-the virtual body (Full-Body Illusion, FBI). Among the sensory inputs contributing to BSC, the vestibular system is believed to play a central role due to its importance in estimating self-motion and orientation. This theory is supported by clinical evidence that vestibular loss patients are more prone to altered BSC states, and by recent experimental evidence that visuo-vestibular conflicts can disrupt BSC in healthy individuals. Nevertheless, the contribution of vestibular information and self-motion perception to BSC remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the relationship between alterations of BSC and self-motion sensitivity in healthy individuals. Fifteen participants were exposed to visuo-vibrotactile conflicts designed to induce an FBI, and subsequently to visual rotations that evoked illusory self-motion (vection). We found that synchronous visuo-vibrotactile stimulation successfully induced the FBI, and further observed a relationship between the strength of the FBI and the time necessary for complete vection to arise. Specifically, higher self-reported FBI scores across synchronous and asynchronous conditions were associated to shorter vection latencies. Our findings are in agreement with clinical observations that vestibular loss patients have higher FBI susceptibility and lower vection latencies, and argue for increased visual over vestibular dependency during altered states of BSC."
https://openalex.org/W2904771608,"A study has been made of the effect of chronic exercise on myocardial electrophysiological heterogeneity and stability, as well as of the role of cholinergic neurons in these changes. Determinations in hearts from untrained and trained rabbits on a treadmill were performed. The hearts were isolated and perfused. A pacing electrode and a recording multielectrode were located in the left ventricle. The parameters determined during induced VF, before and after atropine (1μM), were: fibrillatory cycle length (VV), ventricular functional refractory period (FRPVF), normalized energy (NE) of the fibrillatory signal and its coefficient of variation (CV), and electrical ventricular activation complexity, as an approach to myocardial heterogeneity and stability. The VV interval was longer in the trained group than in the control group both prior to atropine (78±10 vs. 68±10 ms) and after atropine (76±8 vs. 67±10 ms). Likewise, FRPVF was longer in the trained group than in the control group both prior to and after atropine (53±8 vs. 42±7 ms and 50±6 vs. 40±6 ms, respectively), and atropine did not modify FRPVF. The CV of FRPVF was lower in the trained group than in the control group prior to atropine (12.5±1.5% vs. 15.1±3.8%) and, decreased after atropine (15.1±3.8% vs. 12.2±2.4%) in the control group. The trained group showed higher NE values before (0.40±0.04 vs. 0.36±0.05) and after atropine (0.37±0.04 vs. 0.34±0.06; p = 0.08). Training decreased the CV of NE both before (23.3±2% vs. 25.2±4%; p = 0.08) and after parasympathetic blockade (22.6±1% vs. 26.1±5%). Cholinergic blockade did not modify these parameters within the control and trained groups. Activation complexity was lower in the trained than in the control animals before atropine (34±8 vs. 41±5), and increased after atropine in the control group (41±5 vs. 48±9, respectively). Thus, training decreases the intrinsic heterogeneity of the myocardium, increases electrophysiological stability, and prevents some modifications due to muscarinic block."
