https://openalex.org/W2149146712,"Human angiotensin-converting enzyme-related carboxypeptidase (ACE2) is a zinc metalloprotease whose closest homolog is angiotensin I-converting enzyme. To begin to elucidate the physiological role of ACE2, ACE2 was purified, and its catalytic activity was characterized. ACE2 proteolytic activity has a pH optimum of 6.5 and is enhanced by monovalent anions, which is consistent with the activity of ACE. ACE2 activity is increased ∼10-fold by Cl− and F− but is unaffected by Br−. ACE2 was screened for hydrolytic activity against a panel of 126 biological peptides, using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry detection. Eleven of the peptides were hydrolyzed by ACE2, and in each case, the proteolytic activity resulted in removal of the C-terminal residue only. ACE2 hydrolyzes three of the peptides with high catalytic efficiency: angiotensin II (1.Donoghue M. Hsieh F. Baronas E. Godbout K. Gosselin M. Stagliano N. Donovan M. Woolf B. Robison K.

ACE, a component of the renin-angiotensin system, is a zinc metalloprotease that catalyzes cleavage of the C-terminal dipeptide from Ang I to produce the potent vasopressor octapeptide Ang II (2.Skeggs L.T. Kahn J.R. Shumway N.P. J. Exp. Med. 1956; 103: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). ACE-inhibiting drugs have an antihypertensive effect and substantially lower the long-term risk of death, heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, heart failure, and complications related to diabetes mellitus (for review, see Ref.3.Francis G.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 201-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). ACE also inactivates bradykinin by catalyzing the cleavage of the C-terminal dipeptide from the nonapeptide hormone (4.Blais C.J. Marceau F. Rouleau J.-L. Adam A.

ACE2 was identified as a zinc metalloprotease due to its canonical HEXXH sequence (amino acids 374–378) (1.Donoghue M. Hsieh F. Baronas E. Godbout K. Gosselin M. Stagliano N. Donovan M. Woolf B.

The ACE inhibitors captopril, lisinopril, and enalaprilat are not inhibitors of ACE2 (1.Donoghue M. Hsieh F. Baronas E. Godbout K. Gosselin M. Stagliano N. Donovan M. Woolf B. Robison K.

To better understand the physiological role of ACE2, a detailed biochemical analysis of ACE2 substrate preference was undertaken. We reported previously that secreted recombinant ACE2 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells catalyzes cleavage of the C-terminal residue of the biological peptides Ang I, des-Arg9-bradykinin, neurotensin 1–13, and kinetensin (1.Donoghue M. Hsieh F. Baronas E. Godbout K. Gosselin M. Stagliano N. Donovan M. Woolf B. Robison K. Jeyaseelan R. Breitbart R.E. Acton S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, Tipnis et al. (6.Tipnis S.R. Hooper N.M. Hyde R. Karran E. Christie G. Turner A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33238-33243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar) reported that unpurified ACE2 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells catalyzes the hydrolysis of the C-terminal residue of Ang I and Ang II. Herein is the first report of characterization of the catalytic activity of purified ACE2. A sensitive fluorogenic substrate was developed and used to assess the dependence of ACE2 hydrolytic activity on pH and on the presence of monovalent anions. Also, ACE2 substrates were identified from screening biological peptides, and the kinetic constants were determined for hydrolysis of those peptides. The identified peptides are candidate ACE2 physiological substrates. HPLC columns were purchased from the Waters Corp. (Milford, MA). Toyopearl columns were purchased from Tosoh Biosep (Montgomeryville, PA). The peptide Mca-APK(Dnp) was synthesized by Anaspec, Inc. (San Diego, CA). Biological peptides were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co., Bachem Bioscience (King of Prussia, PA), and American Peptide Co. (Sunnyvale, CA). Specifically, Ang I, Ang II, and dynorphin A 1–13 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. 7-Methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl-YVADAPK(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-OH (M-2195), apelin-13, β-casomorphin, des-Arg9-bradykinin, Lys-des-Arg9-bradykinin, and neurotensin 1–8 were purchased from Bachem Bioscience. An expression vector was generated encoding a secreted form of human ACE2 (1.Donoghue M. Hsieh F. Baronas E. Godbout K. Gosselin M. Stagliano N. Donovan M. Woolf B. Robison K. Jeyaseelan R. Breitbart R.E. Acton S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (amino acids 1–740) in the pBac Pak9 vector (CLONTECH). Sf9 insect cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 with ACE2 baculovirus of titer 1.1 × 109 pfu/ml. A 10-liter fermentation run was carried out with SF9 cells grown to a density of 1.3 × 106 cells/ml in SF900II serum-free medium (Invitrogen), 18 mml-glutamine, and 1× antibiotic-antimycotic (from 100X stock; Invitrogen) at 27 °C. At 96 h after infection, cells were pelleted at 5000 × gcentrifugation, and the culture supernatant was collected, frozen, and stored at −80 °C. The thawed supernatant was filtered (0.2-μm filter) and loaded onto a Toyopearl QAE anion exchanger column, and the column was washed with buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). A 0–50% gradient elution was then performed with increasing buffer B (1.0 mNaCl and 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) using a total of 5 column volumes. The ACE2-containing fractions, as detected by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE, were pooled, and (NH4)2SO4 was added to a final concentration of 1.0 m. The sample was then loaded onto a Toyopearl Phenyl column. After loading, the column was washed with buffer C (1.0 m(NH4)2SO4 and 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0) using 5 column volumes and then gradient-eluted with buffer A (0–100%). The ACE2-containing fractions, as detected by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE, were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A at 4 °C overnight. The dialyzed ACE2 protein sample was sequentially loaded onto MonoQ column (Amersham Biosciences) and gradient-eluted with buffer B. The ACE2-containing fractions from the MonoQ column, as detected by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE, were concentrated with a Centricon (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) concentrator, with a molecular mass cutoff of 30 kDa. The concentrated sample was loaded onto a TSK G3000SWxl size exclusion column and eluted with buffer A. Mca-APK(Dnp) was dissolved in 100% Me2SO and quantitated by measuring absorbance at 350 nm using an extinction coefficient of 15,000m−1 cm−1. All reactions were performed in microtiter plates with a 100-μl total volume at ambient temperature. To each well, we added 75 μl of salt (NaCl, NaF, NaBr, or KCl), 5.0 μl of buffer (50 mm, final concentration), and 10 μl of Mca-APK(Dnp) (50 μm, final concentration), and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of ACE2 (0.15 nm, final concentration). The buffers used in the pH dependence studies were sodium acetate, MES, bis-Tris propane, CHES, and CAPS, and the buffer used in the anion dependence studies was MES. The final Me2SO concentration in the assay was 0.7%. The assay was monitored continuously by measuring the increase in fluorescence (excitation = 320 nm, emission = 405 nm) upon substrate hydrolysis using a Polarstar Galaxy fluorescence plate reader (BMG Lab Technologies, Durham, NC). Initial velocities were determined from the rate of fluorescence increase over the 15–60-min time course corresponding to ≤10% product formed. The pH was found to have no significant effect on product fluorescence across the range of pH 5 to pH 10 in the assay buffers. Reactions were performed in microtiter plates at ambient temperature. To each well, we added 5 μl of 1 mm peptide (50 μm, final concentration) and 45 μl of buffer (50 mm MES, 300 mm NaCl, 10 μmZnCl2, and 0.01% Brij-35 pH 6.5), and reaction was initiated by the addition of 50 μl of 100 nm ACE2 (50 nm, final concentration) or buffer (control). Reactions were performed at room temperature for 2 h and quenched with 20 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. Samples were then analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry for detection of hydrolysis and determination of products formed. Mass spectrometry was performed on a Voyager Elite biospectrometry MALDI-TOF spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) as described previously (1.Donoghue M. Hsieh F. Baronas E. Godbout K. Gosselin M. Stagliano N. Donovan M. Woolf B. Robison K. Jeyaseelan R. Breitbart R.E. Acton S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The peptides that were found to be hydrolyzed by ACE2 were re-assayed under the same conditions in the presence of a high concentration of a potent, specific inhibitor of ACE2 2E. Calderwood, N. Dales, A. Gould, B. Guan, T. Ocain, and M. Patane, unpublished results.to confirm specific cleavage by this protease. Rates of substrate hydrolysis were determined by reversed phase chromatography using a capillary HPLC system (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA). Reactions were performed in 100 μl in microtiter plates at ambient temperature. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 50 μl of ACE2 (0.025–0.70 nm, final concentration) to 50 μl of peptide in assay buffer (50 mmMES, 300 mm NaCl, 10 μm ZnCl2, and 0.01% Brij-35, pH 6.5). Reactions were performed at room temperature for 0, 15, 22.5, or 30 min and quenched by the addition of 10 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. Substrate concentrations ranged from 0.8–2000 μm, and hydrolysis was limited to ≤15% product formed (initial velocity conditions). Concentrations of the biological peptides were determined spectrophotometrically. Substrate and product peptides were resolved on a YMC ODS-A 1.0 × 50-mm 120A 5-μm column using a gradient of 10–45% B (A, water/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v); B, acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v)) and detected by absorbance at 215 nm. The peptide Mca-APK(Dnp) and its reaction product were resolved in the same manner using a gradient of 15–65% B and detected by absorbance at 350 nm. Injection volumes ranged from 0.5–20 μl. The extent of hydrolysis was determined from the areas of the substrate and product peaks (area of product peak/(area of product peak + area of substrate peak)) and converted to micromoles of product formed. Initial velocities (v) of substrate hydrolysis were calculated from the slopes of micromoles of product formed versus time. Initial velocities (v) were plotted versus substrate concentration and fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation (v =V max[S]/K m + [S]) using Grafit software (Erithacus Software Ltd., Surrey, United Kingdom). Turnover numbers (k cat) were calculated from the equation k cat = V max/[E], using a calculated ACE2 molecular mass of 85,314 Da and considering the enzyme sample to be essentially pure and fully active. Recombinant soluble human ACE2, encoding amino acids 1–740 of the 805-amino acid full-length enzyme and deleting the C-terminal transmembrane domain, was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and isolated to ∼90% purity by SDS-PAGE (as described previously, Ref.1.Donoghue M. Hsieh F. Baronas E. Godbout K. Gosselin M. Stagliano N. Donovan M. Woolf B. Robison K. Jeyaseelan R. Breitbart R.E. Acton S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This ACE2 sample was used to screen a number of commercially available intramolecularly quenched fluorescent peptides to identify a suitable fluorescent substrate for initial enzyme characterization. The caspase-1 substrate Mca-YVADAPK(Dnp) was found to be hydrolyzed by ACE2, as measured by a time-dependent increase in fluorescence (excitation = 320 nm, emission = 405 nm). Analysis of the reaction products by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry indicated hydrolysis of the Pro-Lys(2,4-dinitrophenyl) peptide bond. A truncated peptide with more efficient intramolecular fluorescence quenching, Mca-APK(Dnp), was synthesized and assayed as an ACE2 substrate with the goal of improving the fluorescence signal of the assay. Complete hydrolysis of 40 μm Mca-APK(Dnp) resulted in a 300-fold fluorescence increase over background, whereas complete hydrolysis of the same concentration of Mca-YVADAPK(Dnp) resulted in a 21-fold increase over background. The Mca-APK(Dnp) substrate is hydrolyzed by ACE2 and was used for characterization of the enzyme activity. Recombinant soluble human ACE2 was expressed in Sf9 insect cells and isolated to >98% purity, based on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 C), by a four-step chromatography protocol. The purified protein sample was confirmed to be ACE2 by peptide mapping of trypsin-digested protein, analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (data not shown). The molecular mass of the purified ACE2 (89.6 kDa, as determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry) is greater than that predicted from the peptide sequence (85.314 kDa). The higher molecular mass is likely to be due to glycosylation, as has been reported for ACE2 (6.Tipnis S.R. Hooper N.M. Hyde R. Karran E. Christie G. Turner A.J. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2160121103,"Leukocyte adhesion to the diabetic retinal vasculature results in blood-retinal barrier breakdown, capillary nonperfusion, and endothelial cell injury and death. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and the leukocyte integrin CD18 are required for these processes. Diabetes was induced in Long Evans rats, resulting in a two- to threefold increase in retinal leukocyte adhesion. Following one week of diabetes, neutrophil CD11a, CD11b, and CD18 expression was increased significantly, as were retinal ICAM-1 levels. Animals were treated with aspirin, a cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitor (meloxicam), or a soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) receptor/Fc construct (TNFR-Fc, etanercept). High-dose aspirin, etanercept, and high-dose meloxicam each reduced leukocyte adhesion and suppressed blood-retinal barrier breakdown. High-dose aspirin also reduced the expression of CD11a, CD11b, and CD18, whereas meloxicam and etanercept did not. High-dose aspirin, etanercept, and high-dose meloxicam each reduced retinal ICAM-1 expression. Aspirin and meloxicam both lowered retinal TNF-alpha levels. Notably, aspirin, meloxicam, and etanercept did not change retinal vascular endothelial growth factor levels. High-dose aspirin, etanercept and high-dose meloxicam, each suppressed the retinal expression of eNOS and the DNA-binding capacity of retinal nuclear factor-kappaB. High-dose aspirin also suppressed Erk kinase activity, which is involved in CD18 up-regulation. Taken together, these data identify COX-2 and TNF-alpha as operative in the early signature pathologies of diabetic retinopathy, a newly recognized inflammatory disease."
https://openalex.org/W2109457390,"Liver steatosis, which involves accumulation of intracytoplasmic lipid droplets, is characteristic of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. By use of an in vivo transgenic murine model, we demonstrate that hepatic overexpression of HCV core protein interferes with the hepatic assembly and secretion of triglyceride-rich very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). Core expression led to reduction in microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) activity and in the particle size of nascent hepatic VLDL without affecting accumulation of MTP and protein disulfide isomerase. Hepatic human apolipoprotein AII (apo AII) expression in double-core/apo AII transgenic mice diminished intrahepatic core protein accumulation and abrogated its effects on VLDL production. Apo AII and HCV core colocalized in human HCV-infected liver biopsies, thus testifying to the relevance of this interaction in productive HCV infection. Our results lead us to propose a new pathophysiological animal model for induction of viral-related steatosis whereby the core protein of HCV targets microsomal triglyceride transfer protein activity and modifies hepatic VLDL assembly and secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2122647692,"ATF6 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane transcription factor that is activated by the ER stress/unfolded protein response by cleavage of its N-terminal half from the membrane. We find that ER stress induces ATF6 to move from the ER to the Golgi, where it is cut in its luminal domain by site 1 protease. ATF6 contains a single transmembrane domain with 272 amino acids oriented in the lumen of the ER. We found that this luminal domain is required for the translocation of ATF6 to the Golgi and its subsequent cleavage, and we have mapped regions required for these properties. These results suggest that the conserved CD1 region is required for translocation, whereas the CD2 region is required for site 1 protease cleavage. We also find that ATF6's luminal domain is sufficient to sense ER stress and cause translocation to the Golgi when fused to LZIP, another ER transmembrane protein.

Eukaryotic cells, from yeast to humans, have therefore developed mechanisms to ensure proper quality control and folding of proteins in this compartment (1.Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar). The cellular responses to unfolded proteins have been termed the ER stress or unfolded protein response. Nutrient deprivation and drugs that cause unfolded proteins in the ER can activate the ER stress response and allow the cell to survive the insult (1.Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar). One part of the ER stress response is to activate new gene expression in the nucleus (2.Mori K. Cell. 2000; 101: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Genes encoding ER chaperones, such as GRP78/BiP and GRP94, are transcriptionally activated such that their gene products are elevated in the ER and decrease the level of unfolded proteins (1.Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar). The analysis of promoters of several target genes has identified a consensus ER stress response element (ERSE) that is necessary and sufficient to mediate the activation of reporter genes by ER stress inducers (3.Yoshida H.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The ERSE is bound constitutively by NF-Y, which is required for the inducible binding of ATF6 to the ERSE (5.Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 6.Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell.

ATF6 is an unusual basic leucine zipper (bZIP) factor in that it contains a central transmembrane domain and is localized to ER membranes (8.Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). It is activated by ER stress by cleavage from the membrane, freeing the N-terminal bZIP and transcriptional activation domains to move to the nucleus and activate transcription (3.Yoshida H. Haze K.

Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). Dominant negative ATF6 constructs inhibited induction of target genes, suggesting that ATF6 is required for ER stress induction in vivo (5.Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 7.Wang Y. Shen J. Arenzana N. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Prywes R. J. Biol.

ATF6 is similar to the CREB-RP/G13 gene (recently renamed ATF6β) in the bZIP and transmembrane domains as well as in two regions in the lumen, termed CD1 and CD2 here (Fig. 1A) (8.Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar, 9.Zhu C. Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4957-4966Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The role of CREB-RP is unclear; it appears to be activated similarly to ATF6, but its overexpression inhibited ER stress induction of the GRP78 promoter (3.Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T.

Sterol Response Element-binding Protein (SRE-BP) is a transcription factor that controls genes involved in maintaining cholesterol levels and is activated when cells are grown in low cholesterol (11.Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). SRE-BP is similar to ATF6 in that it is also an ER transmembrane protein that is activated by cleavage from the membrane. SRE-BP is cleaved in a two-step process, first by site 1 protease (S1P) in the luminal loop of SRE-BP and second by site 2 protease (S2P) near the cytoplasmic end of the transmembrane domain (11.Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). ATF6 is similarly regulated by S1P and S2P cleavage. An S1P-like site in ATF6's luminal domain and the S2P gene were required for ER stress-induced ATF6 cleavage (12.Ye J. Rawson R.B. Komuro R. Chen X. Dave U.P. Prywes R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1355-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar). A cell line lacking S1P was partially defective for ATF6 activation, suggesting that it participates in ATF6 regulation but that there is another protease that can cleave the S1P site (12.Ye J.

S1P is localized to the Golgi, and SRE-BP is activated to move from the ER to the Golgi in low cholesterol media (13.DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Li W.P. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 1999; 99: 703-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 14.Nohturfft A. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Scheek S. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11235-11240Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This suggested that ER stress may induce ATF6 translocation to the Golgi, where it can be cleaved by S1P. We tested this hypothesis here and have mapped regions of ATF6 required for its activation. These results suggest that the luminal domain of ATF6 has an integral role in sensing ER stress leading to ATF6 cleavage in the Golgi and activation of target gene expression. The HA-GAL4-ATF6 expression series were constructed to contain SV40 or CMV promoters and an N-terminal HA epitope tag. They encode the N-terminal 147 residues of yeast GAL4 fused to the indicated regions of human ATF6. The S1P site mutation contains a change of amino acids 415 and 416 from RR to AA. The HA-ATF6 series was constructed in pCGN (15.Tanaka M. Herr W. Cell. 1990; 60: 375-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) and contains a CMV promoter, an N-terminal HA epitope tag, and the indicated regions of human ATF6. The M2-ATF6 plasmid was constructed in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) and encodes the human ATF6 with a FLAG tag at its N terminus. The 3×FLAG-ATF6 plasmids were constructed in p3×FLAG-CMV7.1 (Sigma) and encode the indicated regions of human ATF6 with three copies of the FLAG epitope tag at the N terminus. The GFP-ATF6 plasmids were constructed in pEGFP-C3 (CLONTECH) and encode green fluorescence protein N-terminal to the indicated regions of ATF6. GFP-LZIP was constructed in pEGFP-C3 and encodes GFP fused to the N terminus of LZIP (full-length or aa 1–280). GFP-LZIP-(1–280)-ATF6-(430–670) encodes GFP fused in frame to LZIP-(1–280) and ATF6-(430–670). The LZIP cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Angus Wilson (New York University). The Golgi marker DS1-GT was kindly provided by Dr. Karin Schwab (DKFZ, Heidelberg) and encodes red fluorescent protein fused to the transmembrane region of galactosyl transferase. S1P-KDEL and S1P-KDAS were as described (13.DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Li W.P. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Espenshade P.J.

A retrovirus expression vector for ATF6, pBABE-puro-ATF6, was constructed with an HA epitope tag at its N terminus in pBABEpuro (17.Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). HeLa and NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium with 10% newborn calf serum. NIH3T3 cells stably expressing HA-tagged ATF6 were prepared by retroviral infection and selection with 1.5 μg/ml puromycin. The virus expressing ATF6 was generated by transfection of 293 cells with pBABE-puro-ATF6 and a packaging site-defective Moloney murine leukemia virus construct. HeLa cells were set at 1 × 105 cells/35-mm diameter culture dish. After 24 h, the cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation method as described (18.Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Each SV40-driven HA-GAL4-ATF6 fusion protein plasmid was transfected together with 0.5 μg of a firefly luciferase reporter construct, p5×GAL4-E1b-luc, which has five GAL4 DNA binding sites and 50 ng of the Renilla luciferase reporter pRL-SV40P as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Plasmid pcDNA3.1 was used to bring the total amount of DNA to 5 μg/dish. The cells were incubated with the transfection mixture for 20 h and then grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% newborn calf serum for 12 h. The cells were then either left untreated or treated with 2 μg/ml tunicamycin for 12 h. Cells were then lysed and assayed for firefly and Renillaluciferase activities as described (7.Wang Y. Shen J.

All experiments were performed with duplicate plates for each point, and data are shown as the average of three or more independent experiments ± S.E. HeLa cells were transfected, incubated for 2 days, and then either left untreated or treated with 10 mmDTT or 1.5 μm thapsigargin (Calbiochem) for the times indicated 2 days after transfection. Cells were lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (2% SDS, 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 0.001% bromphenol blue, 0.33% β-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 5 min. The lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting using a 1:2000 dilution of anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Babco) or a 1:1000 dilution of anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) was used as a secondary antibody at a 1:4000 dilution, and the signal was visualized using the ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). NIH cells stably expressing HA-tagged ATF6 were either left untreated or treated with 10 mm DTT for 1.5 h. Cells were fractionated at 4 °C into membrane and nuclear extract fractions. Cells from two 100-mm plates were washed twice, scraped into ice-cold PBS, and centrifuged at 800 ×g for 3 min, and the pellets were suspended in 5 volumes of hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). The cells were allowed to swell on ice for 30 min, disrupted with 50 strokes of a type B Dounce homogenizer, and centrifuged at 3000 rpm (1000 × g) for 10 min in a J-6B Beckman centrifuge. The resulting nuclear pellet was extracted with an equal volume of extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 25% glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) for 1 h and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min in a microcentrifuge. This supernatant was the nuclear extract. The supernatant from the initial low speed centrifugation (1000 ×g) was further centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 30 min. The pellet was the membrane fraction and was resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The fractions were immunoblotted with anti-HA or anti-SRF serum. Polyclonal SRF serum was generated in rabbits against human SRF purified from Escherichia coli. For detection of GFP-ATF6, HeLa cells were grown on uncoated 22 × 22-mm number 1 coverslips (Fisher) in a 60-mm dish (Figs. 4, 5, and 7) at 2 × 105 cells/dish. After 24 h, cells were transfected with 20 μg of GFP-ATF6 constructs alone or together with 4 μg of Golgi marker construct DS1-GT. 20 h later, cells were washed with PBS and grown in fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% newborn calf serum for 4 h. A slide-coverslip chamber was prepared as described (19.Dai J. Sheetz M.P. Cell. 1995; 83: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, two strips of double adhesive tape (1.5 × 30 mm) were placed on both edges of the slide, and then the coverslip, on which HeLa cells were growing, was pressed onto the adhesive tape with the cells facing downward into the chamber. Rapid solution exchanges were affected using a wick system as follows. A drop of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% newborn calf serum (with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.3), with or without 10 mm DTT, was placed at the end of one open edge of the slide-coverslip chamber, and tapered strips of filter paper were placed in contact with the medium at the other open edge. The medium-exchanged chamber was sealed with low melting point wax around the four edges. The assembly was mounted on the microscope stage's slide holder. The temperature was maintained at 37 °C as described (19.Dai J. Sheetz M.P. Cell. 1995; 83: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Fluorescence microscopy was carried out on an Optiphot-2 microscope at ×600 magnification with appropriate filters for fluorescence detection.

The cells were then incubated with anti-HA (1:200) or anti-FLAG (1:1000) monoclonal antibodies in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed with PBS for 10 min and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-linked goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce; 1:100) in blocking buffer for 60 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed twice with PBS at room temperature for 10 min each. The coverslips were mounted on microscope slides, and fluorescence microscopy was carried out on Nikon Diaphot 300 at ×400 magnification with appropriate filters for fluorescence detection. Pictures were taken with a Hamamatsu digital camera with Adobe Photoshop software. ATF6 is activated and cleaved in response to inducers of the ER stress response such as tunicamycin (an inhibitor of glycosylation), thapsigargin (an inhibitor of an ER Ca2+-ATPase), and DTT (a strong reducing agent) (1.Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar). We have found that ER stress induction of ATF6 can be reproduced with a GAL4-ATF6 fusion construct (7.Wang Y. Shen J. Arenzana N. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27013-27020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore mutagenized GAL4-ATF6 to test for the requirement of different domains. We first tested the importance of the S1P site in the functional activation of ATF6. The S1P site in SRE-BP requires the sequence R XXL (20.Duncan E.A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Sakai J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12778-12785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We therefore mutated a similar sequence in ATF6, RRHLL (aa 415–419), to AAHLL. The GAL4-ATF6 (aa 1–670) constructs were transfected into HeLa cells with a GAL4 site reporter gene. Wild type ATF6 mediated strong tunicamycin induction of the reporter gene, whereas mutation of the S1P site completely abolished induction (Fig. 1B). This regulation of GAL4-ATF6 requires low level expression such that we have used the relatively weak SV40 promoter without an enhancer to express GAL4-ATF6. Higher expression resulted in a low level of cleavage of ATF6, which is sufficient to activate the reporter gene in uninduced cells (data not shown). However, it was difficult to detect GAL4-ATF6 in immunoblots using the SV40 promoter. To compare expression and stability of the HA-tagged GAL4-ATF6 variants, we expressed the same variants with a CMV promoter. In this way, we found that both GAL4-ATF6 and GAL4-ATF6(S1P−) were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 1C). We previously had difficulty detecting cleavage of ATF6 in response to inducers of ER stress such as tunicamycin (7.Wang Y. Shen J. Arenzana N. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27013-27020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Possible reasons are that cleavage occurs at low levels and is not synchronous in response to tunicamycin. We used DTT as a stronger and more synchronous inducer of unfolded proteins in the ER (8.Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar, 21.Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar). We found that DTT was able to induce cleavage of GAL4-ATF6 after transfection into HeLa cells and that the S1P site mutations blocked this cleavage (Fig. 1C). Only a small amount of ATF6 cleavage was observed compared with full-length ATF6 after overexpression of GAL4-ATF6 in HeLa cells. To test whether lower levels of ATF6 would be more completely cleaved, we generated a stable cell line using a retroviral vector expressing ATF6 with an N-terminal HA epitope tag. In these cells, ATF6 was effectively cleaved in response to DTT with 80–90% of ATF6 cleaved after 1 h of treatment (Fig. 1D). Cleavage was also activated by another inducer of the ER stress response, thapsigargin, although the kinetics were slower (Fig. 1D). Two cleavage bands of ATF6 were observed after DTT treatment (Fig. 1D). This is consistent with the two-step cleavage by S1P and then S2P (12.Ye J. Rawson R.B. Komuro R. Chen X. Dave U.P. Prywes R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1355-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar). Cleavage by S1P would be predicted to result in a membrane-associated protein, while cleavage by both S1P and S2P frees the product to move to the nucleus. We tested whether the cleavage products conformed to this model by fractionation of the cell extracts. The upper cleavage product (labeled I) was in the membrane fraction, whereas the second product (N) was in both the membrane and nuclear extract fraction (Fig. 1E). As a control for the fractionation, we found that full-length ATF6 was exclusively in the membrane fraction, whereas a nuclear protein, SRF, was only in the nuclear extract fraction (Fig. 1E). It is not clear why the lower ATF6 product is in both the nuclear and membrane fractions. One possibility is that in some cases only a single monomer of the ATF6 homodimer is cleaved such that the cleaved monomer remains associated with the membrane through its dimerization with full-length or S1P-cleaved ATF6 (band I). It is also notable in Fig. 1D that there was not a clear precursor product relationship between the upper and lower ATF6 cleavage products. One explanation is that at least some of the S2P cleavage occurs quickly after S1P cleavage. One possible model for ATF6 activation is that its luminal domain senses ER stress. A prediction of this model is that deletions of this domain that do not affect the S1P cleavage site will affect activation. Possible significant domains of ATF6 are the CD1 (aa 467–506) and CD2 (aa 550–640) regions that are conserved with CREB-RP (9.Zhu C. Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4957-4966Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We made a series of C-terminal deletions of GAL4-ATF6 and tested for their activation by tunicamycin (Fig. 2A). Deletion to aa 640 had no effect, but deletion into the CD2 region abolished activation. An internal deletion spanning the CD1 region (Δ430–550) also strongly reduced induction. The basal level of luciferase expression with each of these deletion constructs varied but was always in the low range (data not shown). Immunoblot analysis of the GAL4-ATF6 variants showed that they were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 2B and data not shown). We tested whether the C-terminal domain was required for ATF6 cleavage. Transfected HeLa cells were treated with or without DTT for 1 h. While a cleavage product of full-length ATF6 was detected in immunoblots, no cleavage product was observed for GAL4-ATF6-(1–600) or -(1–550) (Fig. 2B). These results further correlate activation and cleavage of ATF6 and suggest that the CD2 domain is required for S1P cleavage of ATF6. S1P is localized in the Golgi, and SRE-BP must move from the ER to the Golgi in response to low cholesterol in order to be cleaved (13.DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Li W.P. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 1999; 99: 703-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 14.Nohturfft A. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Scheek S. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11235-11240Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The role of S1P in ATF6 cleavage therefore suggests that ATF6 also moves out of the ER in response to ER stress. We tested this prediction with a FLAG-tagged ATF6 construct that was transfected into HeLa cells. We detected FLAG-ATF6 by immunofluorescence in the perinuclear and cytoplasmic regions in a manner consistent with ER localization (Fig. 3A). DTT treatment for 30 min caused the movement of FLAG-ATF6 to a perinuclear spot that is similar to Golgi staining. To test this, we coexpressed GFP-ATF6 with a Golgi marker, galactosyl transferase, fused to red fluorescent protein (DS1-GT). There was a strong overlap of the signals as shown by the merged images in Fig. 3B, suggesting that FLAG-ATF6 moved from the ER to the Golgi in response to DTT. At 60 min after DTT treatment of transfected cells, we found that FLAG-ATF6 had moved to the nucleus as expected for cleavage of ATF6 by S1P and S2P (Fig. 3A). The localization to the nucleus was confirmed by colocalization with a nuclear red fluorescent protein marker (data not shown). The transient localization to the Golgi should be prolonged if S1P cleavage is blocked. We tested this by using FLAG-tagged ATF6 with mutations at the S1P site. This form of ATF6 moved to the Golgi similar to wild type ATF6 but was retained there even after 60 min of DTT treatment (Fig. 3C). To provide further evidence that ATF6 moves to the Golgi, we used brefeldin A, which causes the relocation of Golgi proteins into the ER (22.Misumi Y. Miki K. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11398-11403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Fujiwara T. Oda K. Yokota S. Takatsuki A. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18545-18552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we used a GFP-ATF6 construct with the S1P site mutated. The GFP fusion was used for ease of detection. Although it requires a higher level of expression to observe, we similarly found that GFP-ATF6 translocated to a perinuclear focus that colocalized with the Golgi-targeted DS1-GT (data not shown). The S1P site mutation was used, since, as with FLAG-ATF6, this caused a longer retention of GFP-ATF6 in a Golgi-like staining pattern after DTT treatment (data not shown). HeLa cells transfected with GFP-ATF6(S1P−) were treated with DTT for 1 h and then with or without brefeldin A (Fig. 4). DTT caused GFP-ATF6(S1P−) to move to the Golgi-like pattern. Brefeldin A then caused the pattern to disperse and return to a more ER-like pattern. This is consistent with a Golgi localization for ATF6 in DTT-treated cells. Another method to test for Golgi localization is to probe for a change in glycosylation with endoglycosidase H. N-Linked oligosacharides in the ER are sensitive to endoglycosidase H cleavage. They become resistant to endoglycosidase H digestion in the Golgi after they are modified by α-mannosidase II, which is localized in the medial and/or trans-Golgi compartment in most cell types (25.Maley F. Trimble R.B. Tarentino A.L. Plummer Jr., T.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 26.Velasco A. Hendricks L. Moremen K.W. Tulsiani D.R. Touster O. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). We did not detect clear resistance to endoglycosidase H digestion after DTT treatment (data not shown). While this does not show that ATF6 moves to the Golgi, it is consistent with movement to the cis-Golgi or an early compartment that does not contain α-mannosidase II. W"

We previously demonstrated in vivo that this inhibitor is necessary for optimal tumor invasion and vascularization. We also showed that PAI-1 angiogenic activity is associated with its control of plasminogen activation but not with the regulation of cell-matrix interaction. To dissect the role of the various components of the plasminogen activation system during angiogenesis, we have adapted the aortic ring assay to use vessels from gene-inactivated mice. The single deficiency of tPA, uPA, or uPAR, as well as combined deficiencies of uPA and tPA, did not dramatically affect microvessel formation. Deficiency of plasminogen delayed microvessel outgrowth. Lack of PAI-1 completely abolished angiogenesis, demonstrating its importance in the control of plasmin-mediated proteolysis. Microvessel outgrowth from PAI-1-/- aortic rings could be restored by adding exogenous PAI-1 (wild-type serum or purified recombinant PAI-1). Addition of recombinant PAI-1 led to a bell-shaped angiogenic response clearly showing that PAI-1 is proangiogenic at physiological concentrations and antiangiogenic at higher levels. Using specific PAI-1 mutants, we could demonstrate that PAI-1 promotes angiogenesis at physiological (nanomolar) concentrations through its antiproteolytic activity rather than by interacting with vitronectin."

Cell cycle progression occurs through distinct phases of the cell cycle, regulated by both intracellular and extracellular mechanisms. Growth factors are primarily involved in the exiting of a cell from a quiescent G0 state, and these factors are necessary until cells reach a so-called restriction point “R.” Phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein is a marker for the R point, and this step is regulated by G1cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). In turn, CDK activity is regulated by complexing with cyclins. Cyclin D1 plays a key role in the transition of cells from G1 to S, and abrogation of its expression leads to G1 cell cycle arrest. Based on our initial observation that ES causes endothelial cell cycle arrest in G1, we investigated the molecular events. We show here that cyclin D1 is a relevant target gene and that the LEF1 site in its promoter is critical for mediating the repressive effect of endostatin. Moreover, we use this target to analyze events affected by ES upstream of cyclin D1, such as the important intracellular mediator β-catenin. A unifying hypothesis that emerges is that ES targets β-catenin and subsequently transcription of genes such as c-myc and cyclin D1 containing LEF1/TCF binding sites in their promoters.

C-PAEs were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. All cell lines were grown at 37 °C in a 100% humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Cells were grown to 80–90% confluency, harvested with trypsin, and resuspended to the cell density required for each assay. For transient transfections, 50–60% confluent cells in 6-well plates were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Retrovirus production was performed as described before (14.Ory D.S. Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μg of retroviral vector cDNA was transfected into the 293 GPG packaging cell line using the Calphos transfection kit. 48 h after transfection, the packing cell line supernatant was collected and used to infect target cells (HUVECs) in complete medium (EGM-2MV). C-PAE and HUVEC cells were growth-arrested by contact inhibition for 48 h. The 0 h value refers to the percentage of cells in S phase at this time point. The cells (0.1 × 106 cells/well) were harvested and plated into a 6-well plate in 1% FCS/DMEM (for C-PAEs) or 1% FCS/EGM2-MV (for HUVECs) with recombinant VEFG or bFGF with or without ES. The cells were harvested at various time points and then fixed in ice-cold ethanol. Fixed cells were dehydrated at 4 °C for 30 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% FCS and 0.1% Tween 20 and then centrifuged and resuspended in 0.5 ml of the same buffer. RNase digestion (5 μg/ml) was carried out at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by staining with propidium iodide (5 μg/ml). The cells were analyzed using a FACScan BD PharMingen flow cytometer. After transient transfection of the cDNAs, cells were incubated for 20 h, and luciferase activity in the cell lysates was determined using a luminometer and normalized using Renilla luciferase activity under the control of the thymidine kinase promoter. Collected cell lysates were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (precast gels, Bio-Rad) followed by electroblotting onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After blocking with 2% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline/Tween-20 (TBS-T) for 1 h, the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was incubated overnight with each primary antibody. After washing with TBS-T, the membrane was incubated with the secondary anti-mouse Ig at a 1:5000 dilution for 30 min. Protein bands were detected using the SuperSignal® West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). We have previously reported that ES causes G1 arrest of endothelial cells (2.Dhanabal M. Volk R. Ramchandran R. Simons M. Sukhatme V.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 3.Dhanabal M. Ramchandran R. Waterman M.J. Lu H. Knebelmann B.

We began our mechanistic studies by defining the time course of this effect and its dependence on ES dose. At various times after treatment with VEGF with or without ES, we monitored the percentage of cells in S phase in both C-PAEs and HUVECs. VEGF induced both cell types into S phase, whereas addition of ES markedly reduced S phase entry (Fig. 1, A andB). Similar data were obtained with bFGF (data not shown). Moreover, mutant ES3.1, which has been shown not to bind to the cell surface, did not cause cell cycle arrest (data not shown). At the 18–21 h time points, which demonstrated this effect most clearly, we assessed ES dose dependence (Fig. 2,A and B). The half-maximal effect was noted at about 5 μg/ml ES.Figure 2Dose dependence and cell type specificity of the effect of ES on cell cycle. Growth-arrested C-PAEs (A) and HUVECs (B) were seeded in 1% FCS/DMEM or 1% FCS/EGM2-MV, respectively, supplemented with VEGF (10 ng/ml) and mES or hES as indicated. ES 3.1 represents the mutant endostatin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next examined the phosphorylation state of pRb protein in endothelial cells since it reflects the ability of a cell to exit G1. ES inhibited the hyper-phosphorylation of pRb induced by VEGF (Fig. 3 A) and bFGF (data not shown), thus providing molecular confirmation of a G1 arrest induced by ES. To clarify the mechanism of this effect, we examined the protein expression level of several cyclins and of cyclin-dependent kinases. Consistent with our retinoblastoma data, the cyclin D1 protein level in HUVECs was increased by treatment with VEGF or bFGF, and this up-regulation was inhibited by ES. Cyclin D1 was decreased as early as 8 h in HUVECs (Fig. 4 A) and in C-PAEs at later time points (Fig. 4 B). After cyclin D1 down-regulation (>14 h), cyclin A levels began to decrease; no changes were noted in the expression of cdk-2 or cdk-4 (data not shown).Figure 4ES down-regulates cyclin D1 protein expression. A, HUVECs incubated with the indicated combination of ES (10 μg/ml) and VEGF (10 ng/ml). At the indicated time points, cells were harvested, and Western blotting was performed. E and V represent endostatin and VEGF, respectively. VE refers to addition of both agents. ± represents with/without bFGF. B, similar data in C-PAE cells. Cyclin D1 protein expression was clearly down-regulated by endostatin. The actin blots serve as loading controls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To critically address the significance of the cyclin D1 changes observed upon ES addition, we generated cyclin D1 over-expressing HUVECs (cyclin D1-HUVECs) by retroviral infection and tested the effects of ES on these cells using cycle analysis. ES inhibited progression into S phase induced by VEGF in control HUVECs (infected with a LacZ-carrying retrovirus) but did not cause G1 arrest in cyclin D1-HUVECs (Fig. 5). These data point to cyclin D1 as a critical ES target in mediating its effects on the cell cycle. Northern blot analysis revealed that ES decreased cyclin D1 mRNA up-regulated by VEGF (not shown) or bFGF (Fig. 6). The decrease of cyclin D1 mRNA by ES was seen as early as 4 h with significant inhibition seen by 8 h. These data suggest that the changes noted in cyclin D1 protein expression are reflected by antecedent changes in cyclin D1 mRNA and could be accounted for either by effects on cyclin D1 mRNA transcription and/or on mRNA stability. To address this issue, we transfected a cyclin D1 promoter reporter construct into endothelial cells and assessed the effect of ES on this promoter. VEGF and bFGF up-regulated promoter activity, whereas ES down-regulated this activity in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 7, A–D) that roughly paralleled the dose dependence noted earlier on G1 arrest (Fig. 2, A and B). Mutant ES (ES3.1) containing a two-amino acid substitution (6.Karumanchi S.A. Jha V. Ramchandran R. Karihaloo A. Tsiokas L. Chan B. Dhanabal M. Hanai J.I. Venkataraman G. Shriver Z. Keiser N.

Cell. 2001; 7: 811-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) had no effect on cyclin D1promoter activity. Our data suggest that ES affects cyclin D1 transcription.Figure 7ES down-regulates cyclin D1promoter activity. Transcriptional activation of a luciferase reporter downstream of various cyclin D1 promoter elements was measured. HUVECs (A and B) and C-PAEs (C and D) were transfected with a −1745cyclin D1 promoter construct (0.4 μg/well) in the presence or absence of ES (μg/ml) or VEGF (ng/ml) and incubated in 1% FBS/EGM2-MV (for HUVECs) or 1% FBS/DMEM (for C-PAEs). After a 20–21 h incubation, cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was measured.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine site(s) in the cyclin D1 promoter responsive to ES, we used a series of deletion mutants of the cyclin D1promoter. As shown in Fig. 8 A, the responses to VEGF and ES were lost after the deletion of nucleotides between −141 and −66 (numbers are from the ATG start codon). The cyclin D1 promoter has both SP1 and LEF1 sites between −141 and −66. Since the SP1 site is thought to be the primary VEGF-responsive element (15.Nagata D. Suzuki E. Nishimatsu H. Satonaka H. Goto A. Omata M. Hirata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 662-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we utilized point mutants in the LEF1 site in the context of the −1745 and the −163 constructs. The results of these experiments (Fig. 8 B) point to the LEF1 site as the target for down-regulation of the cyclin D1 promoter by ES. Since the LEF1 site was important for the inhibitory effect of ES on the cyclin D1 promoter, we focused on intracellular signaling events upstream of transcription through the LEF1 site. β-catenin is known to interact with LEF/TCF transcription factors to activate transcription through this site. We, therefore, assessed the effects of ES on the −163 cyclin D1 promoter construct when β-catenin was over-expressed. Fig. 9 A shows that β-catenin enhanced luciferase activity from the −163 promoter construct and that ES inhibited this increase. Nearly identical results were obtained with the −1745 construct (Fig. 9 B). These data suggest that ES either acts on β-catenin or targets an event “downstream” of β-catenin. To further define the site of action of ES, we utilized an expression vector (TVP) coding for a constitutive activator (insensitive to β-catenin) acting through the LEF1 site. TVP expresses a fusion protein consisting of the transcriptional activator VP16 and (Xenopus) TCF-3 in which the β-catenin binding region has been deleted. As shown in Fig. 9, ES could not inhibit TVP-stimulated promoter activity from either the −163 or −1745 cyclin D1promoter constructs, suggesting that ES does not block LEF/TCF binding to DNA. We have used the fact that ES causes G1 arrest of endothelial cells to dissect part of its molecular mechanism of action. Our novel observations are that ES inhibits cyclin D1 RNA and protein expression in endothelial cells, that this suppression is via transcriptional inhibition through the LEF1 site in the cyclin D1 promoter, and that endostatin acts at the level of β-catenin or downstream of it. Finally, we have shown that over-expression of cyclin D1 protein overrides the effects of ES on the cell cycle. The importance of cyclin D1 in transitioning cells from G1 into S has been amply demonstrated (reviewed in Ref.16.Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4925) Google Scholar). Though cyclin D1 null animals are viable, abrogation of cyclin D1 expression in vitro (e.g. by antisense methods) causes cell cycle arrest or marked inhibition of cell proliferation (17.Lang S. Hartner A. Sterzel R.B. Schocklmann H.O. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 1398-1408PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Sauter E.R. Nesbit M. Litwin S. Klein-Szanto A.J. Cheffetz S. Herlyn M.

Of note, a dominant negative form of TCF causes cell arrest in G1 and can be rescued by cyclin D1 over-expression (24.Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3224) Google Scholar). Thus, our observation that cyclin D1 is an endostatin target is consistent with the known importance of this protein in cell cycle progression. Moreover, in cells over-expressing cyclin D1, endostatin was no longer efficacious in causing cell cycle arrest, indicating that there is no target downstream of cyclin D1 critical for ES action. Identification of cyclin D1 (and the LEF1 site in its promoter) as an ES target has provided an inroad into intracellular signaling events triggered by ES, namely the role of β-catenin. Another line of investigation has also converged with the data presented here. Very recently, we have shown that ES can block axis duplication inXenopus embryos induced by Wnt agonists. 2J.-i. Hanai, J. Gloy, V. P. Sukhatme, and S. Sokol, unpublished data. In particular, we have demonstrated that transcriptional targets of Wnt signaling (endogenous ones such as Siamois as well as synthetic constructs, e.g. TOP-FLASH containing multimerized LEF1 sites upstream of a reporter) can be inhibited by ES. Moreover, by utilizing numerous constructs in the canonical Wnt pathway upstream of β-catenin, we have shown that ES targets β-catenin through a Wnt-independent pathway. What this pathway is and how it connects to cell surface receptors for ES (e.g. the glypicans) remains to be elucidated. There are several relationships among c-myc, a previously established ES target gene, cyclin D1, and cell cycle control. c-Myc promotes cyclin E-Cdk2 activity and E2F-dependent transcription (reviewed in Ref. 25.Bartek J. Lukas J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) so that its expression is important for G1/S control. Moreover, c-Myc has been reported to induce cyclin D1 (26.Daksis J.I. Lu R.Y. Facchini L.M. Marhin W.W. Penn L.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3635-3645PubMed Google Scholar) (as well as cyclin D2 and E (25.Bartek J. Lukas J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar)) at the transcriptional level but can increase cyclin D1-kinase activity also (27.Steiner P. Philipp A. Lukas J. Godden-Kent D. Pagano M. Mittnacht S. Bartek J. Eilers M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4814-4826Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 28.Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Reutens A.T. Segall J.E. Lee R.J. Arnold A. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 501-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Moreover, c-Myc (29.He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar) and cyclin D1 (11.Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Simcha I. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Pestell R. Ben-Ze'ev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5522-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1891) Google Scholar) are targets for β-catenin through the LEF1 sites they share in their respective promoters. Thus, our observation that ES can target β-catenin and LEF sites suggests the unifying hypothesis that ES might target other promoters containing such sites, accounting for the observation that c-Myc is down-regulated by ES. It should be noted, however, that not all genes containing core LEF/TCF binding sites are targets for β-catenin. In a recent report, it was shown that of four candidate target genes identified by a GenBank™ computer search of genes involved in regulating cell growth, onlycyclin D1 but not cyclin A, cdc2, orcdc25 was a target for β-catenin when experimentally tested in reporter assays (24.Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3224) Google Scholar). Moreover, neither cyclin D2,D3, E, and G nor cdk-2,-4, -5, -6, and -7 have target LEF sites (24.Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3224) Google Scholar). To define physiologically relevant targets for ES, we are currently performing microarray analysis of RNA extracted from ES treated versus untreated cells with the expectation that a subset of the genes differentially expressed may be β-catenin targets and may contain LEF sites in their promoters. Future studies will be directed at further detailing the mechanisms by which ES affects cyclin D1 expression induced by VEGF and bFGF. Several possibilities exist. First, we believe that the transcriptional effect on the cyclin D1 promoter via the LEF1/TCF site may only be part of the story since mRNA and protein expression of cyclin D1 are somewhat more dramatically suppressed than the effects seen at the transcriptional level. Second, even at the transcriptional level,cyclin D1 gene activation occurs in a cell type- and mitogen-specific manner (reviewed in Ref. 28.Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Reutens A.T. Segall J.E. Lee R.J. Arnold A. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 501-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). VEGF and bFGF are not known to activate cyclin D1 expression via stabilization and translocation of β-catenin. Multiple elements in cyclin D1promoter including the ATF/CREB and SP1 sites have been delineated in endothelial cells (15.Nagata D. Suzuki E. Nishimatsu H. Satonaka H. Goto A. Omata M. Hirata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 662-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) as responsive to serum stimulation. It is therefore possible that there are cooperative interactions between factors that influence transcription through these elements and the LEF1 site.

We have investigated whether plasma membrane “rafts” are involved in cytokine-activated STAT signaling. Cytokine-free human hepatoma Hep3B cells or cells treated with interleukin-6 (IL-6) or orthovanadate (a general activator of STATs) were fractionated, and plasma membrane raft fractions were obtained by equilibrium sedimentation or flotation through discontinuous sucrose gradients using either non-detergent or detergent-based (saponin or Triton X-100) methods. By Western blotting the plasma membrane raft fractions obtained using either non-detergent or detergent-based methods contained significant amounts of STAT1 and STAT3 (up to ∼10% of the total cytoplasmic amount) as well as the integral raft proteins caveolin-1 and flotillin-1, the IL-6-receptor signal transducing chain gp130, the interferon-γ receptor α chain (IFN-γRα), and the chaperone glucose-regulated protein 58 (GRP58/ER-60/ERp57). Upon activation of signaling by IL-6 or orthovanadate the respective Tyr-phosphorylated STAT species were now also observed in the membrane raft fraction but in a form deficient in DNA binding. The data show pre-association of STATs with plasma membrane rafts in flotation fractions, which also contained caveolin-1 and flotillin-1, and suggest that Tyr phosphorylation may not in itself be sufficient to cause the departure of PY-STATs from plasma membrane rafts. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin, which sequesters cholesterol and disrupts plasma membrane rafts, markedly inhibited IL-6- and IFN-γ-induced STAT signaling. Signaling through specialized raft microdomains may be a general mechanism operating at the level of the plasma membrane through which cytokines and growth factors activate STAT species (the “raft-STAT signaling hypothesis”)."

The current report focuses on an analysis of the expression patterns of 50 metabolic genes in BAT under control conditions (22 degrees C), cold exposure (4 degrees C, 1 to 48 h), warm acclimation (33 degrees C, 3 wk), or food restriction/meal feeding (animals fed the same amount as warm mice). In general, expression of genes encoding proteins involving glucose uptake and catabolism was significantly elevated in the BAT of cold-exposed mice. The levels of mRNAs encoding proteins critical to de novo lipogenesis were also increased. Gene expression for enzymes associated with procurement and combustion of long chain fatty acids (LCFAs) was increased in the cold. Thus, a model was proposed in which coordinated activation of glucose uptake, fatty acid synthesis, and fatty acid combustion occurs as part of the adaptive thermogenic processes in BAT. Confirmation emerged from in vivo assessments of cold-induced changes in BAT 2-deoxyglucose uptake (increased 2.7-fold), BAT lipogenesis (2.8-fold higher), and incorporation of LCFA carboxyl-carbon into BAT water-soluble metabolites (elevated approximately twofold). It is proposed that temperature-sensitive regulation of distinct intracellular malonyl-CoA pool sizes plays an important role in driving this unique metabolic profile via maintenance of the lipogenic pool but diminution of the carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 inhibitory pool under cold conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2118076841,"Parasin I is a potent 19-residue antimicrobial peptide isolated from the skin mucus of wounded catfish (Parasilurus asotus). Here we describe the mechanism of parasin I production from histone H2A in catfish skin mucosa on epidermal injury. Cathepsin D is found to exist in the mucus as an inactive proenzyme (procathepsin D), and a metalloprotease, induced on injury, cleaves procathepsin D to generate active cathepsin D. This activated form of cathepsin D then cleaves the Ser19-Arg20 bond of histone H2A to produce parasin I. Immunohistochemical analysis reveals that unacetylated histone H2A, a precursor of parasin I, and procathepsin D are present in the cytoplasm of epithelial mucous cells and that parasin I is produced on the mucosal surface on epidermal injury. Western blot analysis shows that parasin I is also present in the skin mucus of other fish species. Furthermore, parasin I shows good antimicrobial activity against fish-specific bacterial pathogens. Taken together, these results indicate that cathepsin D and a metalloprotease participate in the production of parasin I from histone H2A and that parasin I contributes to the innate host defense of the fish against invading microorganisms."

Dysregulation of apoptosis has been correlated with degenerative diseases, autoimmune disorders, and cancer. Although the death signals that initiate the apoptotic program can originate from a number of sources, in most cases they lead to the activation of a family of cysteine proteases known as caspases (3.Hengartner M.O.

After recruitment into the apoptosome these caspases undergo autocatalytic processing and become fully active. The CARD domain is also present in the prodomains of several other caspases including human caspase-1, -2, -4, and -5, and mouse caspase-1, -2, -11, and -12. The CARD of caspase-1 mediates its interaction with the CARDs of RICK and Ipaf/CARD-12 (15.Geddes B.J. Wang L. Huang W.J. Lavellee M. Manji G.A. Brown M. Jurman M. Cao J. Morgenstern J. Merriam S.

The CARD-containing caspases have been shown to play important roles in diseases through gene knockout studies in mice. For example, caspase-1 knockout mice exhibit marked resistance to endotoxin-induced sepsis. Caspase-2 and caspase-11 knockout mice show less tissue loss in stroke models (19.Bergeron L. Perez G.I.

In addition to its role in apoptosis, the CARD domain mediates interactions of several upstream components of the NF-κB signaling pathway that play a role in the activation of genes involved in immunity, inflammation, and apoptosis. The CARD-containing adaptor protein RICK interacts with the CARD proteins CARD-4/Nod1 and Nod2 to form a large complex that activates the IKK complex (21.Inohara N. Koseki T. Lin J. del Peso L.

Similarly, the CARD-containing protein Bcl-10, which is implicated in the activation of NF-κB in response to stimulation of the antigen receptors in T and B cells, forms protein complexes with the upstream CARD proteins CARD-9, CARD-10, CARD-11, and CARD-14 (21.Inohara N.

In this study we identified and characterized a new member of the CARD-containing family of proteins designated CARD-8, which binds to caspase-1 and negatively regulates its activity. CARD-8 can also negatively regulate NF-κB activation and sensitize cells to apoptosis. Cells were cultured either in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (for 293T; Phoenix) or RPMI 1640 (for MCF-7; THP-1) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 200 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfatein. RPMI 1640 for THP-1 also contained 10 mm PIPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 55 μm β-mercaptoethanol. The full-length open reading frame of CARD-8 (CARD-8FL) was cloned by PCR using CARD-8 adaptor primers in modified HA-pCI, FLAG-pCMV, pRSC-LacZ, pEGFP, or pMSCV neo vectors. CARD-8 NTD (residues 1–340) and CARD-8-CARD (residues 341–431) were constructed by inserting the indicated domains in the same vectors. In vitro binding assays with CARD-8 and CARD proteins were performed as described previously (28.Ahmad M. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Talanian R.V. Litwack G. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 615-619PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, CARD-8FL and CARD-8-CARD were expressed in DH5-α bacteria as GST fusion proteins, and equal amounts of proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences).35S-labeled CARD-8FL, caspase-1, pseudo-ICE, ICEBERG, caspase-9, Bcl-10, and CRADD were prepared using the TNT-coupled transcription/translation kit (Promega) and incubated with the protein-bound Sepharose beads in 100 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Brij, and protease inhibitors) for 3 h. The beads were washed three times with the same buffer, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and visualized by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. 293T cells (5 × 106) in 100-mm dishes were transiently transfected with the expression plasmid(s) using the LipofectAMINETM reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and incubated with anti-FLAG-M2/M5 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) or HA.11 monoclonal antibody (Babco). The immune complexes were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose, washed extensively, and boiled in SDS sample buffer. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot analysis with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated T7 antibody (Novagen), anti-HA-peroxidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), or anti-caspase-1 (Santa Cruz). The total lysates were also resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western analysis using anti-FLAG-M2/M5, anti-HA-peroxidase, or T7 antibody. Full-length CARD-8 was subcloned into the adenovirus transfer vector pLE11φ. This placed the gene of interest under the transcriptional control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter. An internal ribosome entry site downstream to the gene of interest allowed a modified green fluorescent protein, KGFP (Kelly Theriault, Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), to be expressed off the same transcript. Adenovirus was generated by homologous recombination in 911 cells followed by plaque purification. VERO cells were infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing either CARD-8 or KGFP at a multiplicity of infection of 20. Cells were fixed 36 or 56 h after infection. The nuclei were then stained with Hoescht 33342, and the percentage of apoptotic versus healthy infected cells was scored. The apoptotic assays in MCF-7-Fas cells were performed as described previously (29.Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Ottilie S. Bullrich F. Banks S. Wang Y. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Croce C.M. Litwack G.

Nolan's laboratory, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA) was transfected with pMSCV neo vectors using the calcium phosphate/chloroquine method (31.Kinsella T.M. Nolan G.P. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the media of the cells containing retroviral particles were then collected and incubated with THP-1 cells (1 × 106 cells/well) in three cycles of infection in the presence of polybrene (Sigma). After changing the media, THP-1 cells were then selected using 1 mg/ml neomycin (Invitrogen). After 3 weeks of selection, viable cells were used for detection of protein and IL-1β. To assay for IL-1β, we incubated the cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) for 4 h with INFγ and then for 14 h with 1 μg/ml of LPS. Media of the cells were then used to quantify IL-1β by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). NF-κB activation was performed using a luciferase reporter gene. 293 cells were transfected with 5× κB-luciferase reporter, pRSC-LacZ plasmids, and various expression plasmids using the LipofectAMINETM method according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested and subjected to luciferase assay as described by Lin et al. (32.Lin X. Mu Y. Cunningham Jr., E.T. Marcu K.B. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5899-5907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In certain experiments, cells were treated with hTNF-α for 5 h prior to harvesting. To normalize for transfection efficiency, all lysates were assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Data represent the average of at least three different individual experiments. To identify and characterize new proteins involved in regulation of apoptosis, inflammation, and NF-κB activation, we searched the Millennium Pharmaceutical data base of expressed sequence tags (EST) for clones encoding CARD motifs. We identified an EST sequence encoding a novel CARD-containing protein with the calculated molecular mass of 48 kDa (Fig. 1A). A Blast search of the protein data base indicated that this protein contains at least two putative functional domains. The C-terminal region (residues 341–431) shares significant similarity to CARD motifs found in many apoptotic proteins, including those found in caspase-1/ICE (34% identity, 47% similarity) (Fig. 1B). The N-terminal domain has a high similarity to NAC/DEFCAP-L/CARD-7 (39% identity, 52% similarity) and contains several candidate phosphorylation sites including protein kinase C ((S/T)X(R/K)) sites at amino acids 72, 286, 313, and 416, casein kinase II ((S/T)X(D/E)) sites at 289, 376, 398, 414, and 416, and Map kinase/CDK ((S/T)P) sites at 187 and 289, which may serve to regulate CARD activity. This CARD-containing protein was designated CARD-8. To determine the tissue distribution of CARD-8 we performed RT-PCR analysis, using primers complementary to 5′ and 3′ of the CARD-8 open reading frame. RT-PCR analysis of multiple tissue and cell line mRNA revealed that CARD-8 is expressed mainly in placenta, spleen, lymph node, and bone marrow tissues and in the monocytic THP-1 cell line (Fig. 2, A and B). Similar distribution was observed for caspase-1, pseudo-ICE, and Ipaf (10.Dinarello C.A. Chest. 1997; 112 (suppl.): 321-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 16.Poyet J.L.

These results suggest that these genes may be under similar transcriptional regulation. Because CARD/CARD interactions are highly selective and most CARD-containing proteins segregate with discrete binding partners and modulate intracellular signaling pathways, we determined whether CARD-8 interacts with any of the known CARD proteins involved in apoptosis, inflammation, or NFκB activation. Based on the sequence homology between the prodomain of caspase-1 and the CARD domain of CARD-8, we tested whether CARD-8 could bind to caspase-1 and other CARD-containing proteins by in vitro GST pull-down assays. To this end,35S-labeled caspase-1, pseudo-ICE, ICEBERG, Bcl-10, and CRADD were incubated with GST fusion proteins of full-length CARD-8 (GST-CARD-8FL) and the isolated CARD domain of CARD-8 (GST-CARD-8-CARD). Among these proteins caspase-1 and pseudo-ICE interacted with both GST-CARD-8FL and the GST-CARD-8-CARD, whereas ICEBERG interacted only with the GST-CARD-8FL (Fig. 3A). Because pseudo-ICE shares high homology (∼93% identity) with the CARD domain of caspase-1, these observations suggest that CARD-8 interacts with caspase-1 through CARD-CARD interaction. This was confirmed by performing a reverse interaction between 35S-labeled CARD-8FL and an isolated caspase-1 CARD-GST fusion protein. Consistent with the above results, the isolated caspase-1 CARD-GST fusion protein but not the GST control was able to interact with CARD-8FL. (Fig. 3B). To further confirm the specificity of the CARD domain of CARD-8 toward caspase-1, we compared the binding of 35S-labeled caspase-1 and caspase-9 to the isolated CARD domain of CARD-8 (GST-CARD-8-CARD). CARD-8-CARD was only able to interact with caspase-1 but not with caspase-9 (Fig. 3C), indicating that CARD-8 specifically associates with caspase-1. Both caspase-1 and caspase-9 were able to interact with the GST-pseudo-ICE and GST-Apaf-1-CARD positive controls, respectively (Fig. 3C). To determine whether CARD-8 interacts with ICE, pseudo-ICE, and ICEBERG in transfected cells, T7-tagged caspase-1-C287A, pseudo-ICE, or ICEBERG were transfected together with FLAG-tagged CARD-8 into 293T cells. Total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the FLAG antibody, and the immunoprecipitated products were analyzed by Western blotting with the T7 antibody. As shown in Fig. 4A, caspase-1, pseudo-ICE, and ICEBERG were all able to associate with CARD-8. Of note, pseudo-ICE and ICEBERG were able to compete with caspase-1 for binding to CARD-8 because there was less binding of caspase-1 to CARD-8 in the presence of these two proteins (Fig. 4, A and B). The concept that oligomerization of caspases promotes autoprocessing has been investigated in different studies (33.Gu Y. Wu J. Faucheu C. Lalanne J.L. Diu A. Livingston D.J. Su M.S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1923-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 34.Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). These studies also suggest that self-association occurs through the prodomain of these caspases (35.Van Criekinge W. Beyaert R. Van de Craen M. Vandenabeele P. Schotte P. De Valck D. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27245-27248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Activation of many large prodomain initiator caspases is mediated by association with their respective upstream adaptor molecules. Inhibiting and/or displacing these upstream activators will result in decreased activation of the interacting caspases. Overexpression of caspase-1 leads to its oligomerization and autoprocessing. RICK is an adaptor molecule that has been shown to enhance the activation of caspase-1 by promoting its oligomerization. To determine the effect of CARD-8 on the processing of caspase-1, 293T cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged wild type caspase-1 and FLAG-tagged RICK together with or without CARD-8FL. As shown in Fig. 5A, cotransfection of CARD-8 with caspase-1 significantly decreased the 35-kDa processed form of caspase-1 that results from the autoprocessing of caspase-1 itself. Cotransfection of CARD-8 with caspase-1 and RICK also diminished the RICK-induced processing of caspase-1 into its 35- and 18-kDa fragments. These results suggest that CARD-8 interferes with caspase-1 activation possibly by preventing its oligomerization or its association with its adaptor molecule RICK. IL-1β secretion is one of the consequences of caspase-1 activation. Because CARD-8 binds to caspase-1 and interferes with its activation, we reasoned that it should also decrease IL-1β generation by caspase-1. To test this hypothesis we measured the effect of ectopically expressed CARD-8 on IL-1β secretion from 293T cells transiently transfected with wild type caspase-1 and IL-1β precursor. As shown in Fig. 5B, CARD-8 significantly diminished processing/activation of caspase-1 into its 35-kDa fragment in the transfected 293 cells. As a consequence, IL-1β generation was also inhibited by CARD-8 expression in these cells (Fig. 5B). Similar results were obtained with the caspase-1 activation inhibitor ICEBERG (Fig. 5B). Stable expression of CARD-8 in the THP-1 monocytic cell line significantly decreased caspase-1 activity in response to LPS stimulation in extracts of these cells (Fig. 5C). IL-1β processing and generation were also diminished by CARD-8 in these cells (Fig. 5, D and E). These effects of CARD-8 may be attributed to its ability to bind to caspase-1 and interfere with its activation and/or activity. Consistent with this, the stably transfected CARD-8 was able to immunoprecipitate the endogenous caspase-1 from the THP-1 cells (Fig. 5F). Several CARD-containing proteins are critical regulators of proinflammatory cytokine-induced NF-κB activation (18.Druilhe A. Srinivasula S.M. Razmara M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S.

Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Because our data suggest that CARD-8 is a negative regulator of IL-1β generation, which is a major pathway in the proinflammatory cytokine response, we decided to test the possibility that CARD-8 may also negatively regulate NF-κB activation by the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α. As shown in Fig. 6A, ectopic expression of the full-length CARD-8 or its isolated NTD significantly decreased NF-κB activation by TNF-α. Interestingly, expression of the isolated CARD domain of CARD-8 had an opposite effect and resulted in enhancement of TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation. These results indicate that the NTD is responsible for the observed NF-κB inhibition by CARD-8. CARD-8 was also able to suppress NF-κB activation by ectopically expressed RICK, a known activator of NF-κB (Fig. 6B). These results are consistent with the recent findings of Bouchier-Hayes et al. who demonstrated that CARDINAL (CARD-8) can inhibit multiple pathways of NF-κB activation (39.Bouchier-Hayes L. Conroy H. Egan H. Adrain C. Creagh E.M. MacFarlane M. Martin S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44069-44077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, we were unable to reproduce the finding that CARDINAL (CARD-8) interacts with IKKγ/NEMO (data not shown). Combined, the above results suggest that CARD-8 might be an important negative regulator of the proinflammatory cytokine response by acting at both the IL-1β generation and NF-κB activation levels. The NF-κB signaling pathway is essential for cell survival (40.Lee R. Collins T. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 262-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced differentiation of the promonocytic cell line U937 is associated with persistent NF-κB activation (41.Hida A. Kawakami A. Nakashima T. Yamasaki S. Sakai H. Urayama S. Ida H. Nakamura H. Migita K. Kawabe Y. Eguchi K. Immunology. 2000; 99: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Inhibition of NF-κB activation by a dominant negative IκB-α mutant or the NF-κB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate during PMA-induced differentiation leads to cell death (41.Hida A. Kawakami A. Nakashima T. Yamasaki S. Sakai H. Urayama S. Ida H. Nakamura H. Migita K. Kawabe Y. Eguchi K. Immunology. 2000; 99: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 42.Pennington K.N. Taylor J.A. Bren G.D. Paya C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1930-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that NF-κB activation is essential for survival of U937 cells induced to differentiate with PMA. Consistent with the ability of CARD-8 to inhibit NF-κB activation, we found that U937 and THP-1 cells stably transfected with a CARD-8 expression construct (but not an empty vector) undergo apoptosis in response to PMA-induced differentiation (Fig. 7A). These results indicate that CARD-8 may play an apoptotic role during cellular differentiation by inhibiting NF-κB activation. To determine whether transient overexpression of CARD-8 can induce apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, we transfected MCF-7 cells with HA-tagged CARD-8 or an empty vector and then stained the transfected cells with EthD-1, which stains selectively the nuclei of damaged or dead cells but not healthy cells. We also stained these cells with calcein AM, which stains preferentially live cells more intensely than dead cells, because live cells contain more estrase than dead cells to convert the nonfluorescent calcein AM to the intensely fluorescent calcein. As shown in Fig. 7B, the CARD-8 transfected cells showed significantly more EthD-1 and less calcein staining than the empty vector transfected cells, indicating that CARD-8 can indeed induce cell death in MCF-7 cells. The apoptotic activity of CARD-8 in MCF-7 cells was not as potent as that of the death domain-containing adaptor molecule FADD, but it was comparable with the activities of the CARD-containing adaptor molecules CRADD/RAIDD and Bcl-10 (Fig. 7C). Consistent with these results, CARD-8 can also potentiate Fas, TNF, and TRAIL-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells (data not shown). To determine the apoptotic activity of CARD-8 in another cell line we infected VERO cells with a recombinant adenovirus expressing either CARD-8 or KGFP. The percentage of apoptotic and control cells was scored using Hoescht 33342. As shown in Fig. 7D, CARD-8-overexpressing cells exhibited significantly more apoptotic nuclei after 36 or 56 h compared with control cells (15%versus 5 and 45% versus 12%, respectively), thus confirming the above observations in MCF-7 cells. To gain insight into the mechanisms by which CARD-8 induces apoptosis, we tested the effects of five inhibitors of apoptosis on MCF-7 cells transfected with CARD-8 (Fig. 8A). The direct caspase inhibitors zVAD-FMK, baculovirus p35, and CrmA were able to inhibit CARD-8-induced apoptosis suggesting that CARD-8 induces apoptosis via activation of caspases. Bcl-xL and caspase-9-C287A can also inhibit CARD-8-induced apoptosis suggesting that CARD-8 activates caspases by activating the Apaf-1-caspase-9 apoptotic complex. Our data are in complete contrast to recent findings, which indicated that TUCAN (CARD-8) is an antiapoptotic protein that inhibits caspase-9 activation by binding to the CARD region of procaspases-9 (43.Pathan N. Marusawa H. Krajewska M. Matsuzawa S. Kim H. Okada K. Torii S. Kitada S. Krajewski S. Welsh K. Pio F. Godzik A. Reed J.C. J. Biol.

In addition, S100 extracts prepared from 293 cells transfected with a CARD-8 expression construct had significantly more caspase cleaving activity than the control empty vector S100 extracts in the presence or absence of cytochrome c and dATP (Fig. 8, B and C). These observations indicate that overexpression of CARD-8 does not inhibit activation of caspases in S100 extracts by cytochrome c and dATP as suggested recently (43.Pathan N. Marusawa H. Krajewska M. Matsuzawa S. Kim H. Okada K. Torii S. Kitada S. Krajewski S. Welsh K. Pio F. Godzik A. Reed J.C. J. Biol.

On the contrary, CARD-8 overexpression can indeed activate caspases, which may explain its ability to induce apoptosis in transfected cells. These effects may be all related to its ability to inhibit the NF-κB survival pathway in the transfected cells. In conclusion we have identified and characterized the function of a new member of the human CARD-containing family of proteins. The CARD domain of CARD-8 has a high degree of homology to the CARD domain of caspase-1 and can bind to caspase-1 and its related proteins pseudo-ICE and ICEBERG. CARD-8 attenuates ICE activity and thereby decreasing IL-1β secretion. RT-PCR studies revealed that CARD-8 has the same pattern of expression as caspase-1. CARD-8 can also negatively regulate NF-κB activation by diverse stimuli, suggesting that this protein may control cell survival. Consistent with these results stable expression of CARD-8 sensitizes cells to differentiation-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, overexpression of CARD-8 can induce apoptosis in transfected cells. Although the precise function of CARD-8 is not clear, the results suggest that it may function as an adaptor molecule regulating caspase-1 activation (IL-1β production), NF-κB activation, and apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W2067501960,"DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification of DNA. There are currently three catalytically active mammalian DNA methyltransferases, DNMT1, -3a, and -3b. DNMT1 has been shown to have a preference for hemimethylated DNA and has therefore been termed the maintenance methyltransferase. Although previous studies on DNMT3a and -3b revealed that they act as functional enzymes during development, there is little biochemical evidence about how new methylation patterns are established and maintained. To study this mechanism we have cloned and expressed Dnmt3a using a baculovirus expression system. The substrate specificity of Dnmt3a and molecular mechanism of its methylation reaction were then analyzed using a novel and highly reproducible assay. We report here that Dnmt3a is a true de novo methyltransferase that prefers unmethylated DNA substrates more than 3-fold to hemimethylated DNA. Furthermore, Dnmt3a binds DNA nonspecifically, regardless of the presence of CpG dinucleotides in the DNA substrate. Kinetic analysis supports an Ordered Bi Bi mechanism for Dnmt3a, where DNA binds first, followed by S-adenosyl-l-methionine."

https://openalex.org/W2131005245,"Increased expression of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) during collateral artery growth, as well as its numerous effects on monocytes/macrophages and the smooth muscle cell cycle and differentiation, suggest a modulating role for this growth factor during arteriogenesis. We studied the effects of exogenously applied TGF-beta1 on arteriogenesis as well as its interactions with monocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. In a New Zealand White (NZW) rabbit model of femoral artery ligation, increased expression of active TGF-beta1 was found around proliferating arteries in NZW rabbits. The exogenous application of TGF-beta1 led to an increase in both the number of visible collateral arteries as well as the conductance of the collateral circulation (4.0 +/- 0.5 ml/min/100 mmHg vs. 28.9 +/- 3.7 ml/min/100 mmHg, P<0.05). Fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis showed an increase in the expression of the MAC-1 receptor in both rabbit and human monocytes after treatment with TGF-beta1 (control: 91.2 +/- 4.2/482 +/- 21.7; TGF-beta1 200 ng/ml 193.9 +/- 6.7/ 675.5 +/- 25.7, P<0.05 for all differences). TGF-beta1 treated monocytes showed an increased endothelial adhesion and transmigration in transendothelial migration assays (5.75 +/- 0.63 x 10(5) vs. 10.11 +/- 0.04 x 10(5), P<0.05). TGF-beta1 had no direct pro-angiogenic effect on human umbilical vein endothelial cells in a spheroid model of angiogenesis and inhibited the angiogenic effects of vascular endothelial growth factor."
https://openalex.org/W2086867296,"Recent studies using insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) knockout mice demonstrate that IGF-binding protein (IGFBP)-5, an important bone formation regulator, itself is a growth factor with cellular effects not dependent on IGFs. Because IGFBP-5 contains a nuclear localization sequence that mediates transport of IGFBP-5 into the nucleus, we propose that IGFBP-5 interacts with nuclear proteins to affect transcription of genes involved in bone formation. We therefore undertook studies to identify proteins that bind to IGFBP-5 using IGFBP-5 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a U2 human osteosarcoma cDNA library. Five related clones that interacted strongly with the bait corresponded to the FHL2 gene, which contains four and a half LIM domains. Co-immunoprecipitation studies with lysates from U2 cells overexpressing FHL2 and IGFBP-5 confirmed that interaction between IGFBP-5 and FHL2 occurs in whole cells. In vitro interaction studies revealed that purified FHL2 interacted with IGFBP-5 but not with IGFBP-3, -4, or -6. Northern blot analysis showed that FHL2 was strongly expressed in human osteoblasts.

Of the various IGF system components, IGFBP-5 has several features that suggest it is a key component of the IGF system. IGFBP-5 is the most abundant IGFBP stored in bone, because it is also the only IGFBP that binds avidly to hydroxyapatite (10.Mohan S. Baylink D.J. Rosenfeld R.G. Roberts C.T. The IGF System, Molecular Biology, Physiology, and Clinical Applications. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 457-496Crossref Google Scholar). Decreased skeletal content of IGFBP-5 has been shown to correlate with decreased skeletal content of IGF-I that may contribute to the impairment in coupling of bone formation to resorption (14.Nicolas V. Mohan S. Honda Y. Prewett A. Finkelman R.D. Baylink D.J. Farley J.R. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1995; 57: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Among the IGFBPs known, IGFBP-5 has been shown to stimulate both osteoblast cell proliferation and activity in vitro (15.Andress D.L. Loop S.M. Zapf J. Kiefer M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 16.Kling L. Dony C. Leser U. Popp F. Bauss F. Lang K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11 (Abstr. P249): 153Google Scholar, 17.Richman S.

Recent findings demonstrate that IGFBP-5 itself is a growth factor with cellular effects that are not dependent on IGFs (18.Miyakoshi N. Richman C. Kasukawa Y. Linkhart T.A. Baylink D.J. Mohan S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In this regard, IGFBP-5 treatment increased bone formation parameters in vitro and in vivo in osteoblasts derived from IGF-I knockout mice. IGFBP-5 binds to a putative receptor on the osteoblast cell surface, which may induce downstream signaling pathways (10.Mohan S. Baylink D.J. Rosenfeld R.G. Roberts C.T.

Physiol. 1998; 274: E744-E750PubMed Google Scholar). IGFBP-5 also contains a nuclear localization sequence that mediates transport of IGFBP-5 to the cell nucleus (21.Schedlich L.J. Le Page S.L.

Based on these exciting findings, we have proposed the concept that IGFBP-5 interacts with transcription factors to stimulate transcription of genes that lead to increased osteoblast proliferation. The idea that IGFBPs may affect cells by IGF-independent mechanisms is not restricted to IGFBP-5. For instance, IGFBP-3 has been shown to mediate its effects on a variety of cell types in part via an IGF-independent mechanism (23.Oh Y. Muller H.L. Lamson G. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14964-14971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Rajah R. Valentinis B. Cohen P. J. Biol.

Several IGFBP-3-interacting proteins have been discovered using the yeast two-hybrid assay (27.Shi Z. Xu W. Loechel F. Wewer U.M. Murphy L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18574-18580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar,28.Liu B. Lee H.Y. Weinzimer S.A. Powell D.R. Clifford J.L. Kurie J.M. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33607-33613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). For example, it has been shown that IGFBP-3 interacts with retinoid X receptor-α, and this interaction results in the modulation of the transcriptional activity of retinoid X receptor-α, which is essential for mediating IGFBP-3 effects on apoptosis (28.Liu B. Lee H.Y. Weinzimer S.A. Powell D.R. Clifford J.L. Kurie J.M. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33607-33613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). IGFBP-3-induced apoptosis was abolished in retinoid X receptor-α knockout cells, and IGFBP-3 and retinoid X receptor ligands enhanced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. To understand the molecular mechanism of how IGFBP-5 stimulates bone formation by an IGF-independent pathway, it is essential to identify cellular proteins that interact with IGFBP-5. These proteins could be IGFBP-5 receptors as well as nuclear proteins that regulate transcription. We therefore utilized a yeast two-hybrid assay (29.Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar) screen to identify proteins that bind to IGFBP-5 using human IGFBP-5 as bait for screening a human osteosarcoma U2 cDNA library. We have identified clones encoding the full or partial coding sequence of the LIM-only protein FHL2 (30.Genini M. Schwalbe P. Scholl F.A. Remppis A. Mattei M.G. Schafer B.W.

FHL2 monoclonal antibody was a kind gift from Dr. Muller, University of Freiberg, Germany (32.Muller J.M. Isele U. Metzger E. Rempel A. Moser M. Pscherer A. Breyer T. Holubarsch C. Buettner R. Schule R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Recombinant human IGFBP-4 and -5 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as previously described (17.Richman S. Baylink D.J. Lang K. Dony C. Mohan S. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4699-4705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Miyakoshi N. Richman C. Kasukawa Y. Linkhart T.A. Baylink D.J. Mohan S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). IGFBP-6 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY. Recombinant human IGFBP-3 was a gift from Dr. A. Sommer (Celtrix Corp., Palo Alto, CA). The yeast Matchmaker two-hybrid system 3 was purchased from CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA. BamHI and SalI double-digestion excised the cDNA fragment encoding the entire IGFBP-5 from the plasmid pGEM-T. Then the cDNA fragment was gel-purified and cloned into the BamHI/SalI-digested pGBKT7 vector, and DNA sequencing confirmed that the cDNA encoding the IGFBP-5 (bait) was in-frame with GAL4 BD (amino acids 1–147). The bait vector was transformed into the yeast reporter strain AH109, and protein samples were prepared from selected yeast cell lysates using standard protocols or as recommended by the supplier of the Matchmaker two-hybrid system 3 kit (CLONTECH). The expression level of the bait IGFBP-5/GAL4 BD fusion protein was determined by Western blot analysis using a GAL4 BD monoclonal antibody (CLONTECH). It is crucial to test each BD:bait plasmid construct for auto-activation of reporter gene promoters before performing the two-hybrid screen. To check for auto-activation, the yeast reporter strain AH109 was transformed with the BD:IGFBP-5 plasmid using the Lithium acetate method as described in the Matchmaker two-hybrid system 3 user manual. The AH109 reporter contains three reporter genes, ADE2, HIS3, and MEL1, with GAL4-responsive upstream-activating sequences (AUS) and TATA boxes. ADE2, HIS3, and MEL1 are expressed from GAL1 and GAL2 promoters, which strongly respond to GAL4. Transformed cells were plated on synthetic complete medium (CM) minus adenine and histidine as well as on CM minus tryptophan (bait plasmid contains a tryptophan as a selection marker for growth control). α-X-Gal was added to the medium at 20 mg/ml to screen for auto-activation of MEL1. The GAL4 AD:cDNA library constructed in the yeast plasmid pACT2 from U-2Os (U2) human osteosarcoma cell (ATCC HTB-96) mRNA was purchased from CLONTECH. Because a library screen requires up to 500 μg of AD:cDNA plasmid DNA, depending on the yeast strain and the BD:bait plasmid, the AD:cDNA plasmid library in pACT2 was amplified according to the supplier's instructions. We prepared 6 mg of plasmid DNA from amplified E. coli cells using the Nucleobond Mega plasmid prep kit (CLONTECH). The plasmid contains the ampicillin gene for selection in E. coli and a leucine marker for selection in the yeast host. The reporter strain AH109 containing the BD:IGFBP-5 plasmid was transformed with the 0.5 mg of AD:cDNA plasmid library using the lithium acetate method as outlined in the THS3 manual. The transformed cells were plated onto low stringency minimal selection medium (lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan) and incubated for 4–21 days at 30 °C. The plates were checked for colonies after 4 days of incubation at 30 °C, and positive colonies were picked over a 3-week time period. Positive colonies were transferred to high stringency minimal selection medium plates (lacking Ade, His, Leu, and Trp and containing α-X-gal) plates and incubated at 30 °C until sufficient growth was achieved and colonies turned blue. Positive colonies were maintained on high stringency selection media that select for reporter gene activation. Colonies that activated all of the reporter genes in the AH109 stain were further analyzed. The AD:cDNA plasmid encoding the interacting protein was isolated from yeast cells using a modified Qiagen (Valencia, CA) plasmid prep method obtained from Qiagen technical support. The plasmid DNA prepared was then used to transform E. coli (HB101), and colonies containing AD:cDNA plasmid were selected with ampicillin (50 μg/ml). The AmpR colonies were picked and inoculated into 5 ml of LB-Amp medium and grown overnight at 37 °C with shaking. Plasmid DNA was isolated using a Qiagen kit. AD:cDNA plasmids isolated from the primary screen were used to transform the AH109 strain containing the BD:IGFBP-5 plasmid to test for activation of reporter genes. Transformed cells were plated on high stringency selection medium containing α-X-gal. AD:cDNA clones that confirmed positive were further characterized by DNA sequencing with an automated Applied Biosystems 373A genetic analysis system. Clones that failed to grow in the reconfirmation screen were not pursued for any further analysis. Normal human osteoblasts were isolated as described (33.Linkhart T.A. Linkhart S.G. MacCharles D.C.

For the present study, cells isolated from calvaria and rib were grown from frozen stocks made at the second passage and were used at passage 3–4. These cells maintain an osteoblastic phenotype for more than six passages (34.Chevalley T. Strong D.D. Mohan S. Baylink D. Linkhart T.A. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 134: 591-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). U-2 Os (HTB-96) and MG63 (CRL-1427) human osteogenic sarcoma cells were from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). SaOs human osteosarcoma cells are a low alkaline phosphatase subline developed by Farley et al. (35.Farley J.R. Hall S.L. Herring S. Tarbaux N.M. Matsuyama T. Wergedal J.E. Metabolism. 1991; 40: 664-671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37 °C in humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Growth medium consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), 10% iron-supplemented newborn calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), and 1% antibiotics (Cellgro). Total RNA from untransformed normal human osteoblasts derived from calvaria and rib and human osteosarcoma cell lines (SaOs-2 and U2) was isolated using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). 20 μg of total RNA was loaded on a 1.2% agarose gel, and the gel was blotted using standard techniques (36.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) after electrophoresis. FHL2 full-length cDNA was randomly32P-labeled using a commercial kit (New England BioLabs) for Northern hybridization. A glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA was used as a control probe. Probes were hybridized at 42 °C in the presence of 50% formamide using standard protocols. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from normal human calvaria and rib osteoblasts and from U2 cells were prepared as described (37.Dailly Y.P. Zhou Y. Linkhart T.A. Baylink D.J. Strong D.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1518: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The nuclear extracts were then used for Western blot analysis using the FHL2 monoclonal antibody kindly provided by Dr. Muller, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany. MG63 cells were plated at 2000 cells/well in 96-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. The next day the medium was replaced with serum-free medium, and cells were incubated for an additional 24 h before 10 nm human recombinant IGFBP-5 was added. After 48 h of incubation in the presence or absence of recombinant IGFBP-5, cells were fixed, rendered permeable with ethanol, and rinsed with PBS. IGFBP-5 protein localization was detected using IGFBP-5 guinea pig polyclonal antibody and fluorescent anti guinea pig secondary antibody. After staining, cells were rinsed three times with PBS, stored in 50% glycerol, and visualized using an Olympus IX70 epifluorescence microscope. A full-length cDNA clone corresponding to the FHL2 was cloned into the expression vector pQE32 (Qiagen) in-frame with the 6-His tag. The FHL2 coding sequence was amplified by PCR from the selected AD:cDNA plasmid template. We used a primer pair to create BamHI and SalI restriction enzyme sites at 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The forward primer was 5′-CGCGGATCC TGACTGAGCGCTT-3′ (the bold sequence corresponds to BamHI site, and the underlined sequence correspond to the N terminus of FHL2), and the reverse primer was 5′-ACGCGTCGAC AAGTGAACTTGCGGGGTTTTCAGTATCTACG-3′ (the bold sequence corresponds to the SalI restriction site, and the underlined sequence corresponds to the pACT2 vector 3′ sequence). The PCR product was subsequently purified using QIAXII (Qiagen), digested with BamHI and SalI, and ligated to the vector pQE32. A selected clone was confirmed by DNA sequencing to be in-frame with the 6-His tag. The pQE32 expression vector was transformed into E. coli host M15, and expression was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The rFHL2 was purified according to instructions in the Qiagen Expressionist handbook. To overexpress the FHL2 and IGFBP-5 cDNAs in bone cells, we constructed a retroviral expression vector. We cloned the FHL2 and IGFBP-5 cDNA coding sequences of 850 and 750 bp, respectively, in place of the β-galactosidase gene in a murine leukemia virus-based retroviral vector plasmid, pCLSAβ-gal (38.Peng H.

The FHL2 850-bp cDNA fragment was generated by PCR using a pair of oligonucleotides; the forward primer was 5′-ACGCGTCGACATGACTGAGCGCTTT-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-GCGCGGATCCAATTCAGATGTCTTTCCCAC-3′; the IGFBP-5 cDNA fragment was generated by PCR using the forward primer 5′-ACGCGTCGACATGGGCTCCTTCGTGCAC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CGCGGATCCATCACTCAACGTTGCTGCTG-3′ (restriction sites noted in bold). The PCR product was digested SalI/BamHI, purified, and ligated to SalI/BamHI-digested retroviral vector plasmid, pCLSAβ-gal. The transcription of the FHL2 and IGFBP-5 cDNAs in pCLSA-FHL2 and pCLSA-IGFBP-5 was under the control of the murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat promoter. To produce retroviral expression vector, 293T cells were co-transfected with the pCLSA-FHL2 or pCLSA-IGFBP-5 plasmid and a viral envelope expression plasmid pCMV-G using the calcium phosphate method (39.Gasmi M. Glynn J. Jin M.J. Jolly D.J. Yee J.K. Chen S.T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1828-1834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The viral vectors were harvested 36 h post-transfection, and the titer of the viral vector was determined by end point dilution and by transducing HT1080 cells as described (38.Peng H. Chen S-T. Wergedal J.E. Polo J.M. Yee J-K. Lau W.K.-H. Baylink D.J. Mol. Ther. 2001; 4: 95-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). U2 cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates. After 24 h of incubation, the cells were transduced with 100 μl each of the viral stocks of pCLSA-FHL2 plus pCLSAβ-gal, pCLSA-IGFBP-5 plus pCLSAβ-gal, or pCLSA-FHL2 plus pCLSA-IGFBP-5 vectors as described (38.Peng H.

Multiplicity of infection was 10 based on viral vector titer of ∼1 × 107 transforming units/ml. Twenty-four hours after transduction, the cells were rinsed and passaged twice for expansion. The transduction efficiency was determined by staining the cells for β-galactosidase expression was estimated to be ∼90% after two passages. U2 cells transduced with pCLSA-FHL2 were used to prepare cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts for Western blot analysis using the FHL2 monoclonal antibody. U2 cells transduced with pCLSA-FHL2 and pCLSA-IGFBP-5 were used to prepare whole cell lysates. U2 cells transduced with pCLSA-FHL2 and pCLSA-IGFBP-5 were used to prepare whole cell lysates using a procedure recommended by Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). 250 μl of cell lysates were incubated in presence of 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose conjugated to FHL2 monoclonal antibody or to only 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 14 h on a rotary shaker. After incubation, samples were centrifuged for 1 min at 14,000 rpm. The protein A-Sepharose pellets were washed four times with the lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1.0% Triton X-100) and resuspended in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer. The immune complex was dissociated from protein A by boiling, and 20 μl was removed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE in 12% acrylamide gel. The IGFBP-5 in the immune precipitate was detected by IGFBP-5 antibody in Western blot analysis according to standard protocols (42.Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 269-309Google Scholar). IGFBP-5, IGFBP-4, and IGFBP-6 were 125I-labeled as described previously (40.Mohan S. Jennings J.C. Linkhart T.A. Baylink D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 966: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The ability of FHL2 to bind to IGFBP-5 was analyzed by immunoprecipitation. The FHL2 protein (100 ng/ml) was incubated with FHL2 monoclonal antibody (1:500 dilution) and 125I-IGFBP-5 (100,000 cpm/ml) for 14 h at 4 °C in 250 μl of incubation buffer (30 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 10 mmEDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.5% Tween 80) (41.Nam T.J. Busby Jr., W.H. Rees C. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1100-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For competitive binding experiments, 1 μg/ml unlabeled IGFBP-5 was included in addition to 125I-IGFBP-5. After incubation, 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Upstate Biotechnology) was added, and the samples were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with mixing every 10 min, then were centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 ×g. The pellets were washed three times with incubation buffer and re-suspended in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer. The immune complex was dissociated from protein A by boiling, and 20 μl were removed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE in 12% acrylamide gel. The125I-IGFBP-5 precipitated by FHL2 anti-body was detected by autoradiography. The same procedure was used to test binding of FHL2 to125I-IGFBP-4 and -6. IGFBP-5/FHL2 interaction using unlabeled proteins was also performed with IGFBP-5 polyclonal antibodies to immune precipitate and the 6-His-tag monoclonal antibody to detect FHL2 using the same procedure as mentioned above. FHL2 in the immune precipitate was detected by Western blot according to standard protocols (42.Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 269-309Google Scholar). PS1 ProteinChip arrays were used for the analysis of FHL2 interactions with IGFBPs. The spots in PS1 ProteinChip were pre-activated with iminodiacetate chemistry that covalently binds to the free primary amine groups (Ciphergen Biosystems, Inc., Fremont, CA). Briefly, 200 ng of FHL2 (50 μl) was added to each spot, incubated for 2 h at room temperature on an orbital shaker, and blocked with 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, for 30 min to remove nonspecific binding. After rinsing the spots with PBS, 50 μl of PBS or PBS containing 200 ng of IGFBP was added to each spot and incubated for 1 h at room temperature on an orbital shaker. The spots were are then rinsed with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl and 1% Triton X-100 before the addition of energy absorbing molecule (α-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The spots were air-dried and analyzed using the SELDI ProteinChip system (PBS-1, Ciphergen) as described previously (43.Li X. Mohan S. Gu W. Miyakoshi N. Baylink D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1524: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Data were collected using laser intensity of 80% and mass calibrated with protein standards (43.Li X. Mohan S. Gu W. Miyakoshi N. Baylink D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1524: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We used the THS3 to identify candidate proteins that interact with our protein of interest, IGFBP-5. The IGFBP-5 cDNA sequence was fused to the DNA binding domain sequence of GAL4 in the expression vector pGBDT7. The yeast reporter strain AH109 was transformed with this plasmid, and cells were plated on the appropriate selection medium. Expression of the GAL4-IGFBP-5 fusion protein in AH109 cells was subsequently confirmed by Western blot analysis using an antibody (CLONTECH) to the GAL4 DNA binding domain of the fusion protein (Fig. 1).

https://openalex.org/W2156262248,"α-Synuclein has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Although the function of α-synuclein remains largely unknown, recent studies have demonstrated that this protein can interact with phospholipids. To address the role of α-synuclein in neurodegenerative disease, we have investigated whether it binds phospholipase D (PLD) and affects PLD activity in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells overexpressing wild type α-synuclein or the mutant forms of α-synuclein (A53T, A30P) associated with Parkinson's disease. Tyrosine phosphorylation of α-synuclein appears to play a modulatory role in the inhibition of PLD, because mutation of Tyr125 to Phe slightly increases inhibitory effect of α-synuclein on PLD activity. Treatment with pervanadate or phorbol myristate acetate inhibits PLD more in HEK 293 cells overexpressing α-synuclein than in control cells. Binding of α-synuclein to PLD requires phox and pleckstrin homology domain of PLD and the amphipathic repeat region and non-Aβ component of α-synuclein. Although biologically important, co-transfection studies indicate that the interaction of α-synuclein with PLD does not influence the tendency of α-synuclein to form pathological inclusions. These results suggest that the association of α-synuclein with PLD, and modulation of PLD activity, is biologically important, but PLD does not appear to play an essential role in the pathophysiology of α-synuclein. α-Synuclein has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.

The recent observation that both mice and flies expressing a human α-synuclein transgene recapitulate some characteristics of PD suggests that α-synuclein could be involved directly in the development of this disease (10.Feany M.B.

Structurally, α-synuclein is a small acidic protein of 140 amino acid residues that contains three modular domain, including an amino-terminal lipid binding α-helix, an amyloid binding domain that encodes the non-Aβ component (NAC) of AD plaques, and a carboxyl-terminal acidic tail. The structure of α-synuclein allows the molecule to exist in either a random or a natively unfolded conformation or as an α-helix in the presence of phospholipids (12.Davidson W.S. Jonas A.

Recent studies have suggested various cellular roles for α-synuclein that include possible modifications of membrane and cell surface signaling events (19.Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Although normal cellular functions of α-synuclein are unknown, several observations suggest the synuclein may serve to integrate presynaptic signaling and membrane trafficking. Recently, α-synuclein has been identified as a potent and selective inhibitor of phospholipase D2 (PLD2) in vitro. PLD hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine to produce phosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol (20.Jenco J.M. Rawlingson A. Daniels B. Morris A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4901-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). This suggests that the level and modification of α-synuclein may affect phospholipase D2 activity in vitro, thereby modulating the cleavage of membrane lipids and membrane biogenesis (19.Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Thus far, two isoforms of PLD have been described, PLD1 and PLD2 (21.Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S.

Activity of 120-kDa PLD1 is regulated by multiple inputs, including phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, protein kinase C, the Rho family proteins, and ADP-ribosylation factor proteins. PLD2 is a 106-kDa protein that share 50–55% homology with PLD1. PLD2 is reported to have a much higher basal activity than PLD1 and appears to be insensitive to further stimulation by the known activators of PLD1. The primary lipid product of PLD, phosphatidic acid, exhibits a number of biological activities in vitro and may be an important mediator of processes controlling vesicular transport and changes in cell morphology (25.Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). In neuronal cells, PLD activation has been linked to pathways involved in cell growth, differentiation, and neurotransmitter release (26.Klein J. Chalifa V. Liscovitch M. Loffelholz K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 6: 1445-1455Google Scholar, 27.Min D.S. Ahn B.-H. Rhie D.-J. Yoon S.-H. Hahn S.J. Kim M.-S. Jo Y-H. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 41: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although many studies continue to focus on the functional relationships and the isozyme specificities of the PLD isozymes, the molecular mechanism of the regulation of the PLDs has not been fully elucidated. In this regard, the identification of PLD-binding partners may provide clues toward the understanding of complex regulatory mechanism of PLD in different cells. Since direct cell cytotoxicity of α-synuclein is still controversial, α-synuclein might interact with other proteins to cause neurodegeneration. The investigation of regulation of PLD by α-synuclein is required to gain insight into the role of these proteins under normal and pathological condition. As a step in this effort, we now report for the first time that α-synuclein binds to PLD1 and PLD2 and inhibits pervanadate-induced PLD activation in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Moreover, we show that the state of tyrosine phosphorylation of α-synuclein plays a modulatory role in pervanadate-induced PLD activity.

The cells were transfected with the indicated plasmid DNA and LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. G418 (500 μg/ml) was used for selection. HEK 293 cells were lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride) and precleared with preimmune IgG and protein A-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C with rocking. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Equal protein aliquots of precleared cell lysates (1 mg) were incubated with the indicated antibodies and 30 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads for 4 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed five times with a buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmNa3VO4, 10% glycerol, and 1% Nonidet P-40) and resuspended in sample buffer. Immune complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using the indicated antibody. The protein bands were visualized using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). The full-length cDNA of human PLD1 or PLD2 was digested into fragments containing specific domains. These individual PLD1 or PLD2 fragments were then ligated into the EcoRI or SmaI site of the pGEX4T1 vector. Subcloning and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to produce the expression vectors encoding the respective GST fusion proteins. Escherichia coli BL21 cells were transformed with individual expression vectors encoding the GST fusion proteins, and after harvesting the cells, the GST fusion protein expressed were purified by standard methods (29.Lee C.

Rat brain (2 g) was homogenized in lysis buffer using a polytron homogenizer. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, the resulting supernatant was used to investigate potential α-synuclein or PLD binding domains. Protein concentrations were determined using the methods developed by Bradford (30.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). Clarified lysates (1 mg) of rat brain were incubated with 3 μg of GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads in a final volume of 500 μl of lysis buffer for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Protein complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with washing buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Associated protein complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoreactivity was detected using the indicated antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were plated into 60-mm dishes at 5 × 105 cells per dish and grown for 1 day. The cells were then labeled with myo-[2-3H]inositol (2 μCi/ml) in inositol-free DMEM for 20 h. Subsequently, the labeled cells were washed and pretreated with 20 mm LiCl for 15 min in DMEM containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Stimulation was initiated by the addition of pervanadate for 50 min and terminated by the addition of ice-cold 5% HClO4. After 30 min in an ice bath, extracts were centrifuged, diluted with distilled water, and applied to Bio-Rad Dowex AG 1-X8 anion exchanger column. The column was then washed with 10 ml of distilled water followed by 10 ml of 60 mmammonium formate containing 5 mm of sodium tetraborate. Total inositol phosphates were eluted with a solution containing 1m ammonium formate and 0.1 m formic acid. PLD activity was assessed by measuring the formation of [3H]phosphatidylbutanol, the product of transphosphatidylation in the presence of 1-butanol. HEK 293 cells were subcultured in six-well plates at 2 × 105 cells/well. The cells were serum-starved in DMEM for 24 h before the start of the assay. For the final 20 h of serum starvation, the cells were labeled with 1 μCi/ml [9,10-3H]myristic acid. The cells were washed three times with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and pre-equilibrated in serum-free DMEM for 1 h. For the final 10 min of preincubation, 0.3% butan-1-ol was included. At the end of the preincubation, cells were treated with pervanadate or PMA for the indicated times. Incubations were terminated by removing the medium, washing with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS, and adding 1 ml of ice-cold methanol. Cells were scraped off the plates using a policeman, and the lipids were extracted and separated with methanol/chloroform/0.1 n HCl (1:1:1) according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (31.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar). The lower phase was dried under N2, resuspended in 30 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1), and spotted onto silica gel 60A thin layer chromatography plate (Whatman). The plates were developed in the upper phase of the solvent system of ethyl acetate/iso-octane/H2O/acetic acid (55:25:50:10) and stained with iodine. A phosphatidylbutanol standard (Avanti Polar Lipids) was used to locate the bands, which were scraped into scintillation mixture. Radioactivity incorporated into total phospholipids was measured, and the results were presented as percentage of total lipid counts/min incorporated into phosphatidylbutanol to normalize the results. To examine the co-localization of α-synuclein with PLD1, a double-immunofluorescence technique was used. Three male Sprague-Dawley rats (3–6 months old) were deeply anesthetized with 4% chloral hydrate (1 ml/100 mg) and were sacrificed by transcardial perfusion with a fixative containing 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Cryostat coronal sections (25 μm thick) were cut throughout the mesencephalon and were processed for double-immunofluorescence histochemistry. Free floating sections were blocked in 10% normal donkey serum and normal goat serum in 0.01 m PBS for 1 h. Incubation with primary antibodies was performed with a mouse monoclonal antibody against α-synuclein and an affinity-purified anti-PLD1 antibody overnight at 4 °C. After washing in PBS, the sections were incubated with a mixture of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch; diluted at 1:100) and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch; diluted at 1:100) for 2 h at room temperature. To test the specificity of immunostaining, control sections were processed in an identical manner but with the primary or secondary antibodies omitted. Slides were viewed using a confocal microscope (MRC-1024, Bio-Rad). Images were converted to TIFF format, and contrast levels of images were adjusted using Adobe Photoshop. We performed hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining according to standard cell biology techniques (16.Engelender S. Kaminsky Z. Guo X. Sharp A.H. Amaravi R.K. Kleiderlein J.J. Margolis R.L.

At 30 h post-transfection, the co-transfected HEK 293 cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde-PBS buffer for 15 min at room temperature and hydrated with distilled water for 10 min. The hydrated cells were stained with Mayer's hematoxylin solution (Sigma) for 5 min and washed in distilled water. Cells were destained with 1% HCl in ethanol for 30 s and neutralized with 0.2% ammonia for 30 s. The processed cells were stained with eosin solution (Eosin Y, 0.5% aqueous solution, Sigma) for 1 min, followed by washing in distilled water. The cells were dehydrated by rinsing in the following concentration series of ethanol, 70, 80, and 100%, at room temperature and then mounted with 100% glycerol. All cells were counted in fields chosen at random from five different circles of the cell culture well (all cells were counted in five randomly selected fields under a light microscope at a magnification of ×400). Values are expressed as percentages of cells containing eosinophilic protein aggregates with pinkish color relative to total cells. Error bars shown in this study represent S.D. derived from means for three independent replicates. Data are expressed as means ± S.D. The Student's t test was used where appropriate. A probability of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To investigate whether α-synuclein might affect PLD activity in human cell lines, we generated a line of 293 HEK cells overexpressing wild-type (wt), A30P, or A53T α-synuclein, as well as a vector transfected control cell line (Vec). Pervanadate, a complex of vanadate and hydrogen peroxide, is a competitive inhibitor of protein-tyrosine phosphatase that works by irreversible oxidation and functions on intact cells because of its cell permeability (33.Huyer G. Liu S. Kelly J. Moffat J. Payette P. Kennedy B. Tsaprailis G. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Pervanadate is also known to stimulate PLD activity (34.Min D.S. Kim E.-G. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29986-29994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 35.Rumenapp U. Schmidt M. Olesch S. Ott S. Eichel-Streiber C.V. Jakobs K.H. Biochem.

Pervanadate stimulated PLD activity less in wild-type, A30P, or A53T α-synuclein cell lines than in the control cell line (Fig. 1A). Inhibition of pervanadate-stimulated PLD activity in α-synuclein HEK 293 cells occurred in a time dependent manner, compared with that of control cells (Fig. 1B). We also examined an effect of α-synuclein on another activator of PLD, PMA. PMA-induced PLD activation in cells expressing α-synuclein also was more reduced, compared with that of control cells (Fig. 1C). To examine the relative contribution of PLD protein to PLD activity in HEK cells, we investigated the expression level of PLD isozymes. By immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis using anti-PLD antibody, cells overexpressing wild-type α-synuclein or vector-transfected cell line were found to express similar levels of PLD1 (Fig. 2). However, PLD2 was not detected in either cells (data not shown). Similar results were observed in HEK 293 cells stably transfected with A30P or A53T (data not shown). To further demonstrate the inhibitory effect of α-synuclein on the PLD activity, we transiently co-transfected α-synuclein and PLD1 or PLD2 into HEK 293 cells. Transfected cells were labeled with [3H]myristic acid and then either left untreated or stimulated with pervanadate (100 μm sodium orthovanadate and 0.5 mm H2O2). Cells co-transfected with α-synuclein and PLD1 or PLD2 showed less pervanadate-induced PLD activation than cells transfected with PLD and vector (Fig. 4). These results demonstrate that α-synuclein inhibits both PLD1 and PLD2 activation induced by pervanadate in mammalian cells.Figure 2Expression of PLD1 in HEK 293 cells. Vector or α-synuclein-expressing cells were lysed, and immunoprecipitates (IP) were prepared using anti-PLD or anti-α-synuclein (Syn) antibodies. Immunoprecipitants were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose membrane and Western blotting (Blot) with anti-PLD or α-synuclein (Syn) antibodies. The results shown are representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Effect of tyrosine phosphorylation state of α-synuclein on pervanadate-induced PLD activation.

Recently, it was reported that α-synuclein is tyrosine-phosphorylated by the Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases such as c-Src and Fyn (37.Ellis C.E. Schwartzberg P.L. Grider T.L. Fink D.W. Nussbaum R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3879-3884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We investigated tyrosine phosphorylation of α-synuclein in transfected cells. Immunoprecipitated α-synuclein from either pervanadate-treated stably transfected HEK 293 cells expressing human α-synuclein was separated by SDS-PAGE in duplicate. Western blot analysis was then performed with phosphotyrosine specific antibody (4G10), or α-synuclein antibody, which specifically recognizes α-synuclein (Fig. 3). The cell lysates were also immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-α-synuclein antibody. Pervanadate (100 μm sodium orthovanadate and 0.5 mmH2O2) induced tyrosine phosphorylation of α-synuclein. We investigated the effect of the tyrosine phosphorylation state of α-synuclein on pervanadate-induced PLD activity by mutating each of the tyrosines in α-synuclein. Mutation of Tyr125 to Phe was the only tyrosine mutation to alter the activity of α-synuclein. This reduced tyrosine phosphorylation to ∼5% of the wild-type control, whereas other single amino acid changes do not change tyrosine phosphorylation significantly. Next, we examined the effect of tyrosine phosphorylation state on the ability of α-synuclein to inhibit PLD activity. The cells were co-transfected with PLD1 or PLD2 along with the Y125F mutant construct or wild-type control α-synuclein. After co-transfection, cells were trated with or without pervanadate (100 μmNa3VO4 and 500 μmH2O2). Mutation of Tyr125 to Phe slightly increased the inhibitory effect of α-synuclein on pervanadate-induced PLD activity. (Fig. 4A). The expression level of PLDs or α-synuclein was similar in these transfection experiment (Fig. 4B). Thus, the tyrosine phosphorylation state of α-synuclein appears to modulate PLD activity. To explore the significance of this inhibition, we examined whether α-synuclein interacts with PLD isozymes. HEK 293 cells overexpressing α-synuclein were treated for 20 min with or without pervanadate. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-PLD antibody, and the precipitates were probed with monoclonal anti-α-synuclein antibody (Fig. 5A). The presence of α-synuclein in the PLD immune complex was apparent. In a reciprocal experiment, α-synuclein was immunoprecipitated by antibody to α-synuclein. Subsequent immunoblotting with the anti-PLD1 revealed PLD1 expression (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, α-synuclein was constitutively associated with PLD1. Furtheremore, both α-synuclein and PLD1 proteins were associated with PKCα in cells overexpressing α-synuclein (Fig. 5, B and C). α-Synuclein was also associated with PLD2 in co-t"
https://openalex.org/W2038619251,"The precise metabolic steps that couple glucose catabolism to insulin secretion in the pancreatic beta cell are incompletely understood. ATP generated from glycolytic metabolism in the cytosol, from mitochondrial metabolism, and/or from the hydrogen shuttles operating between cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments has been implicated as an important coupling factor. To identify the importance of each of these metabolic pathways, we have compared the fates of four fuel secretagogues (glucose, pyruvate, dihydroxyacetone, and glycerol) in the INS1-E beta cell line. Two of these fuels, dihydroxyacetone and glycerol, are normally ineffective as secretagogues but are enabled by adenovirus-mediated expression of glycerol kinase. Comparison of these two particular fuels allows the effect of redox state on insulin secretion to be evaluated since the phosphorylated products dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glycerol phosphate lie on opposite sides of the NADH-consuming glycerophosphate dehydrogenase reaction. Based upon measurements of glycolytic metabolites, mitochondrial oxidation, mitochondrial matrix calcium, and mitochondrial membrane potential, we find that insulin secretion most tightly correlates with mitochondrial metabolism for each of the four fuels. In the case of glucose stimulation, the high control strength of glucose phosphorylation sets the pace of glucose metabolism and thus the rate of insulin secretion. However, bypassing this reaction with pyruvate, dihydroxyacetone, or glycerol uncovers constraints imposed by mitochondrial metabolism, each of which attains a similar maximal limit of insulin secretion. More specifically, we found that the hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, related to the proton export from the mitochondrial matrix, correlates well with insulin secretion. Based on these findings, we propose that fuel-stimulated secretion is in fact limited by the inherent thermodynamic constraints of proton gradient formation."
https://openalex.org/W2017021371,"Stimulation of human platelets by cross-linking of the low affinity receptor for immunoglobulin, FcγRIIA, caused the rapid activation of the small GTPase Rap1B, as monitored by accumulation of the GTP-bound form of the protein. This process was totally dependent on the action of secreted ADP since it was completely prevented in the presence of either apyrase or creatine phosphate and creatine phosphokinase. Dose-dependent experiments revealed that the inhibitory effect of ADP scavengers was not related to the reduced increase of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in stimulated platelets. Activation of Rap1B induced by clustering of FcγRIIA was totally suppressed by AR-C69931MX, a specific antagonist of the Gi-coupled ADP receptor P2Y12, but was not affected by blockade of the Gq-coupled receptor, P2Y1. Similarly, direct stimulation of platelets with ADP induced the rapid activation of Rap1B. Pharmacological blockade of the P2Y1 receptor totally prevented ADP-induced Ca2+ mobilization but did not affect activation of Rap1B. By contrast, prevention of ADP binding to the P2Y12 receptor totally suppressed activation of Rap1B without affecting Ca2+ signaling. In platelets stimulated by cross-linking of FcγRIIA, inhibition of Rap1B activation by ADP scavengers could be overcome by the simultaneous recruitment of the Gi-coupled α2A-adrenergic receptor by epinephrine. By contrast, serotonin, which binds to a Gq-coupled receptor, could not restore activation of Rap1B. When tested alone, epinephrine was found to be able to induce GTP binding to Rap1B, whereas serotonin produced only a slight effect. Finally, activation of Rap1B induced by stimulation of the Gq-coupled thromboxane A2receptor by U46619 was completely inhibited by ADP scavengers under conditions in which intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was unaffected. Inhibition of U46619-induced Rap1B activation was also observed upon blockade of the P2Y12 but not of the P2Y1 receptor for ADP. These results demonstrate that stimulation of a Gi-dependent signaling pathway by either ADP of epinephrine is necessary and sufficient to activate the small GTPase Rap1B.

These results demonstrate that stimulation of a Gi-dependent signaling pathway by either ADP of epinephrine is necessary and sufficient to activate the small GTPase Rap1B. Rap1 proteins are members of a family of small GTPases highly related to the product of the ras protooncogene. Two isoforms of Rap1 are known, Rap1A and Rap1B: they share more than 90% sequence homology but are differently expressed in different cell types. For instance, in human platelets, expression of Rap1B is particularly high as it accounts for about 0.1% of the total cellular proteins, whereas Rap1A is almost undetectable (1.Torti M. Lapetina E.G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 2.Klinz F.J. Seifert R. Schwaner I. Gaussephol H. Frank R. Schultz G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For this reason, human platelets represent an excellent experimental model to study the biological and functional properties of Rap1B. In resting platelets, Rap1B is mainly located at the membrane as a consequence of post-translational modifications, including isoprenylation, proteolysis, and carboxylmethylation (3.Winegar D.A. Ohmstede C.A. Chu L. Reep B.R. Lapetina E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4375-4380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon stimulation of platelets with extracellular agonists, Rap1B associates with the actin-based cytoskeleton (4.Fischer T.H. Gatling M.N. Lacal J.C. White G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19405-19408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas upon platelet treatment with antagonists, such as prostacyclin, Rap1B undergoes cAMP-dependent phosphorylation and translocates from the membrane to the cytosol (5.Lapetina E.G. Lacal J.C. Reep B.R. Molina y Vedia L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3131-3134Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although Rap1B has been suggested to be involved in a number of cellular processes, its exact function in human platelets is still poorly understood. Like other GTPases, Rap1B is activated by binding of GTP. Several factors able to stimulate the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rap1 proteins have been discovered (6.Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nature Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). These exchange factors can be activated by different intracellular messengers, including Ca2+, cAMP, protein kinase C, and tyrosine kinases (6.Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nature Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). In human platelets, Rap1B is rapidly activated by thrombin, the most potent extracellular agonist (7.Torti M. Lapetina E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7796-7800Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 8.Franke B. Akkerman J.-W.N. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Experiments with cell-permeable Ca2+-chelating agents and with Ca2+ ionophores have suggested that the rapid activation of Rap1B induced by thrombin is mediated by the increase of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration (8.Franke B. Akkerman J.-W.N. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Moreover, a second, delayed phase of Rap1B activation has been observed and found to be regulated by protein kinase C (9.Franke B. van Triest M. de Bruijn K.M.T. van Willigen G. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Negrier C. Akkerman J.-W.N. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, multiple pathways for Rap1B activation clearly exist in human platelets. In addition to thrombin, a number of other strong and weak platelet agonists, including ADP, collagen, and PAF, have been described to induce binding of GTP to Rap1B (8.Franke B. Akkerman J.-W.N. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), but the biochemical mechanism underlying their action has not been characterized as yet. In the most recent studies, a mounting body of evidence indicates that platelet aggregation induced by many different agonists results from concomitant signaling through both Gq- and Gi-coupled receptors. This concept has been initially developed upon studies on ADP-induced platelet activation. ADP binds to two different membrane receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins: the P2Y1 receptor, coupled to Gq (10.Hechler B. Léon C. Vial C. Vigne P. Frelin C. Cazenave J.-P. Gachet C. Blood. 1998; 92: 152-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Jin J. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol.

Binding of ADP to the P2Y1 receptor induces phospholipase C activation, Ca2+ mobilization, and platelet shape change (10.Hechler B. Léon C. Vial C. Vigne P. Frelin C. Cazenave J.-P. Gachet C. Blood. 1998; 92: 152-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Jin J. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2030-2034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) but is unable to trigger aggregation unless the Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptor is concomitantly activated (14.Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8070-8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when the P2Y12 receptor is blocked by selective antagonists, full platelet response to ADP can be restored by the simultaneous activation of the Gi-coupled α2A-adrenergic receptor by epinephrine (14.Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8070-8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The critical role of Gi activation is also supported by many other findings. The P2Y12 receptor has been recently cloned and recognized as the target of antithrombotic drugs, such as clopidogrel and ticlopidine (12.Holloperter G. Jantzen H.-M. Vincent D. Li G. England L.

Sci. 1995; 16: 179-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover, this receptor is defective in patients with a selective congenital impaired response to ADP (17.Cattaneo M. Lecchi A. Randi A.M. McGregor J.L. Mannucci P.M. Blood. 1992; 80: 2787-2796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Nurden P. Savi P. Heilmann E. Bihour C. Herbert J.M. Maffrand J.P. Nurden A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1612-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Finally, in platelets from Gq knockout mice, high concentrations of ADP can still induce partial aggregation by binding to the P2Y12 receptor (19.Ohlmann P. Eckly A. Freund M. Cazenave J.-P. Offermanns S. Gachet C. Blood. 2000; 96: 2134-2139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several findings also indicate that the requirement for a Gi pathway for full platelet activation is not restricted to ADP but is a general feature of many platelet agonists. For instance, the thromboxane A2 analogue U46619 binds to a specific receptor on the platelet surface that is coupled to Gq (20.Habib A. FitzGerald G.A. Maclouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2645-2651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). U46619-induced platelet aggregation has been found to rely on the simultaneous stimulation of a Gi-dependent pathway by either secreted ADP or epinephrine (21.Paul B.Z.S. Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29108-29114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Similarly, platelet aggregation induced by the thrombin receptor-activating peptide, TRAP, which is a much weaker agonist than thrombin, is reversed by ADP scavengers or by selective antagonists of the P2Y12 receptor (22.Trumel C. Payrastre B. Plantavid M. Hechler B. Viala C. Presek P. Martinson E.A. Cazenave J.-P. Chap H. Gachet C. Blood. 1999; 94: 4156-4165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, even when platelet stimulation is promoted by the recruitment of receptors that are linked to tyrosine kinase-based signaling pathways rather than heterotrimeric G-proteins, such as in the case of FcγRIIA 1The abbreviations used are: FcγRIIAFcγIIA receptormAbmonoclonal antibodyCPcreatine phosphateCPKcreatine phosphokinaseGAPGTPase activating proteinRBDrap-binding domainGSTglutathione S-transferaseBAPTA-AM1,2-bis (o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N, N, N', N'-tetraacetic acid tetra (acetoxy-methyl) ester cross-linking, platelet responses largely depend on the activation of the Gi-coupled receptor P2Y12 by secreted ADP (23.Gratacap M.-P.

Although the essential role of a Gi-mediated signaling pathway in potentiating platelet activation by many agonists is very well documented, the exact mechanism of this effect is poorly understood. Several results indicate that inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by the Gi α-subunit may not be relevant, and therefore, suggest the involvement of a still unidentified intracellular effector (24.Haslam R.J.

This results reveal a new link between heterotrimeric G-proteins of the Gi family and small GTPases of the Rap family and suggest a potential mechanism responsible for the potentiation of platelet activation by Gi-coupled receptors. Sepharose CL-2B, GSH-Sepharose 2B, and the enhanced chemiluminescence substrate were for Amersham Biosciences, Inc. The thromboxane A2 analogue U46619, ADP, thrombin, sheep anti-mouse F(ab′)2 fragments, acetylsalicylic acid, and A3P5PS were from Sigma. AR-C69931MX was a generous gift from AstraZeneca R&D, Charnwood, UK. Fura-2/AM was fromCalbiochem. The monoclonal antibody IV.3 against the FcγRIIA was obtained from Medarex. The rabbit polyclonal antiserum against Rap1B was described previously (3.Winegar D.A. Ohmstede C.A. Chu L. Reep B.R. Lapetina E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4375-4380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA for the rap binding domain (RBD) of ralGDS was kindly provided by Dr. J. L. Bos (Department of Physiological Chemistry, University of Utrecht, The Netherlands). Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were from Bio-Rad. Human platelets from healthy donors were prepared by gel filtration on Sepharose CL-2B and eluted with Hepes buffer (10 mm HEPES, 137 mmNaCl, 2.9 mm KCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.4) as described previously (27.Torti M.

Platelet concentration was adjusted to 0.35 × 109 platelets/ml. Platelet samples (0.5 ml) were incubated at 37 °C in an aggregometer under constant stirring, and upon the addition of 1 mm CaCl2, stimulated with the indicated agonists. Cross-linking of FcγRIIA was obtained by incubation of platelets with 2 μg/ml monoclonal antibody IV.3 for 2 min followed by the addition of 30 μg/ml sheep anti-mouse F(ab′)2 fragments. Other platelet samples were stimulated with ADP (10 μm), epinephrine (1 μm), serotonin (5 μm), thromboxane A2 analogueU46619 (10 μm), or thrombin (0.6 units/ml). Platelet stimulation was typically performed for 1 min unless otherwise stated. When indicated, 1 unit/ml apyrase, 5 mm CP, 40 units/ml CPK, 500 μm A3P5PS, or 100 nmAR-C69931MX were added to the platelet samples 2 min before stimulation. Measurement of Rap1B activation was performed essentially as described by Franke et al. (8.Franke B. Akkerman J.-W.N. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), exploiting the specific and selective ability of the GST-tagged rap binding domain (GST·RBD) of ralGDS immobilized on GSH-Sepharose to bind and precipitate the active, GTP-bound form of Rap1B from a platelet lysate. Platelet stimulation was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold modified 2× RIPA buffer (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 400 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μmleupeptin, 0.2 μm aprotinin, 0.2 mmNa3VO4). Cell lysis was performed on ice for 10 min. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C. Recombinant purified GST·RBD was coupled to GSH-Sepharose by incubating 200 μg of the protein with 100 μl of GSH-Sepharose (75% slurry) for 2 h at room temperature under constant tumbling. In preliminary experiments, we determined that under these conditions, all the added GST·RBD was immobilized on the resin. GSH-Sepharose-coupled GST·RBD was added to the cleared platelet lysates (20 μg of GST·RBD/sample), and precipitation of GTP-bound Rap1B was performed by incubation at 4 °C for 45 min. The precipitates were collected by brief centrifugation, and the beads were washed three times with modified 1× RIPA buffer and finally resuspended with 25 μl of SDS sample buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, pH 8.3, 4% SDS, 1% dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue). Precipitated Rap1B was separated by SDS-PAGE on 10–20% acrylamide gradient gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. The presence of active Rap1B in precipitates with GST·RBD was evaluated by staining the nitrocellulose filters with a specific polyclonal antiserum directed against Rap1B, used at a final dilution of 1:1000. Reactive proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence reaction. All the presented figures are representative of at least three separate experiments. Platelets were prepared as described above with slight modifications. Platelet-rich plasma was incubated with 3 μm Fura-2/AM for 30 min at 37 °C. Platelets were recovered by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min at room temperature and resuspended in a small volume (0.5–1 ml) of autologous plasma. Platelets were then isolated by gel filtration on Sepharose CL-2B and eluted with Hepes buffer containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 5.5 mm glucose. Platelet count was then adjusted to 2 × 108 platelets/ml. Measurement of cytosolic Ca2+ was performed on 0.4-ml samples prewarmed at 37 °C under gentle stirring in a Perkin-Elmer LS3 spectrofluorimeter in the presence of either 1 mmCaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA. The fluorescence excitation and emission wavelengths were 340 and 510 nm, respectively. Fura-2 fluorescence signals were calibrated according to the method of Pollock et al. (28.Pollock W.K. Rink T.J. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 869-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Fmax was determined by the addition of 2% Triton X-100 and saturating concentrations of CaCl2, whereas Fmin was determined by the addition of 2 mm EGTA and 20 mm Tris base. All determinations were repeated at least three times with platelets from different donors. Samples of gel-filtered platelets were placed in an aggregometer under constant stirring and treated with 2 μg/ml anti-FcγRIIA mAb IV.3 and 30 μg/ml sheep anti-mouse F(ab′)2 fragments for increasing times. After cell lysis, the active, GTP-bound form of Rap1B was selectively precipitated with GST·RBD and identified by immunoblotting using a specific polyclonal antiserum. Fig. 1A shows that clustering of FcγRIIA caused a strong and rapid activation of Rap1B that was already maximal after 30 s of stimulation. The activation of Rap1B clearly preceded platelet aggregation. The amount of active Rap1B was found to decrease progressively after prolonged stimulation, in parallel with the progression of platelet aggregation (Fig. 1A). Although platelets were stimulated in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2, activation of Rap1B was found to be independent of extracellular calcium since it was also observed when 1 mm EGTA was present (Fig. 1B). Moreover, it did not require the production of thromboxane A2 since it was only minimally affected by the treatment of platelets with acetylsalicylic (Fig. 1B). It has been recently shown that FcγRIIA-mediated platelet activation is largely dependent on the action of secreted ADP (23.Gratacap M.-P. Hérault J.-P. Viala C. Ragab A. Savi P. Herbert J.-M. Chap H. Plantavid M. Payrastre B. Blood. 2000; 96: 3439-3446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Polgar J. Eichler P. Greinacher A. Clemetson K.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 549-554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate the impact of ADP on Rap1B activation, cross-linking of FcγRIIA was performed in the presence of two unrelated ADP scavengers, apyrase and CP-CPK. Fig. 2 shows that in the presence of these ADP scavengers, FcγRIIA-mediated activation of Rap1B was completely inhibited. The effect of apyrase and CP-CPK was found to be specific and selective since both scavengers were inactive when added immediately after cell lysis, and CP-CPK did not affect thrombin-induced activation of Rap1B (Fig. 2). Therefore, FcγRIIA-mediated activation of Rap1B was totally dependent on the action of secreted ADP. In previous studies, activation of Rap1B has been reported to be mediated by an increase of the intracellular Ca2+concentration (8.Franke B. Akkerman J.-W.N. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Moreover, the ADP scavenger CP-CPK has been found to inhibit Ca2+ mobilization from internal stores induced by clustering of FcγRIIA (23.Gratacap M.-P. Hérault J.-P. Viala C. Ragab A. Savi P. Herbert J.-M. Chap H. Plantavid M. Payrastre B. Blood. 2000; 96: 3439-3446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we verified whether inhibition of Rap1B activation by ADP scavengers was a consequence of the reduced cytosolic Ca2+ increase. Using Fura-2-loaded platelets, we actually confirmed that, even in the presence of extracellular CaCl2, both apyrase and CP-CPK reduced the increase of Ca2+ concentration triggered by clustering of FcγRIIA (Table I). The two scavengers were constantly found to be differently effective since reduction of cytosolic Ca2+ increase was greater with CP-CPK (about 60%) than with apyrase (about 20%). Using ADP as agonist, we found that both apyrase and CP-CPK totally prevented cytosolic Ca2+ increase, indicating that they were equally effective in neutralizing ADP (data not shown). Moreover, the addition of P2Y1 and P2Y12 receptor antagonists to apyrase-treated platelets did not result in any further reduction of intracellular Ca2+increase induced by clustering of FcγRIIA (data not shown), indicating that the ADP scavenger is actually able to completely neutralize released ADP at the microenvironment of the platelet cell surface. These results indicate that, even when secreted ADP was neutralized, a residual albeit variable increase of cytosolic Ca2+ persisted in platelets stimulated by cross-linking of FcγRIIA. We thus treated platelets with decreasing concentrations of anti-FcγRIIA monoclonal antibody IV.3. Fig. 3A shows that treatment of platelets with 0.2 μg/ml IV.3 caused an increase of cytosolic Ca2+ similar to that observed in platelets stimulated with 2 μg/ml IV.3 in the presence of CP-CPK and still lower than that measured in the presence of apyrase. In similar dose-dependent studies, activation of Rap1B was found to occur at concentrations of IV.3 as low as 0.1 μg/ml (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that inhibition of FcγRIIA-induced activation of Rap1B by ADP scavengers is not due to the reduced increase of intracellular Ca2+.Table IEffect of ADP scavengers on FcγRIIA-mediated increase of cytosolic Ca2+ concentrationTreatment[Ca2+]inmNone45 ± 12 (n = 13)FcγRIIA clustering397 ± 58 (n = 6)Apyrase + FcγRIIA clustering335 ± 41 (n = 3)CP-CPK + FcγRIIA clustering159 ± 28 (n = 4)Fura-2-loaded platelets were prewarmed at 37 °C in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2, and incubated without or with 1 unit/ml apyrase or 5 mm CP and 40 unit/ml CPK for 2 min.

The cytosolic concentration of Ca2+ was calculated as described under “Material and Methods.” Open table in a new tab Fura-2-loaded platelets were prewarmed at 37 °C in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2, and incubated without or with 1 unit/ml apyrase or 5 mm CP and 40 unit/ml CPK for 2 min. Platelets were then stimulated by clustering of FcγRIIA by addition of 2 μg/ml mAb IV.3 and 30 μg/ml sheep anti-mouse F(ab′)2fragments. The cytosolic concentration of Ca2+ was calculated as described under “Material and Methods.” ADP binds to two different purinergic receptors on the platelet surface, P2Y1 and P2Y12, which are coupled to Gq and Gi, respectively (30.Kunapuli S.P. Platelets (Edinburgh). 1998; 9: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To investigate the relative contribution of each one of these receptors on activation of Rap1B induced by clustering of FcγRIIA, we performed experiments with selective antagonists. Fig. 4 shows that pretreatment of platelets with A3P5PS, a specific antagonist of the Gq-coupled P2Y1 receptor, did not significantly affect FcγRIIA-mediated activation of Rap1B. By contrast, AR-C69931MX, an antagonist of the P2Y12 receptor, totally suppressed activation of Rap1B induced by clustering of FcγRIIA. These results clearly indicate that the action of secreted ADP on Rap1B activation was totally mediated by its binding to the Gi-coupled receptor on the platelet surface. To confirm these results, we investigated the activation of Rap1B triggered by exogenous ADP. When platelets were stimulated with 10 μm ADP, a rapid and sustained activation of Rap1B was observed (Fig. 5A). Experiments with selective inhibitors of P2Y1 and P2Y12 receptors revealed that the ability of exogenous ADP to activate Rap1B was exclusively mediated by agonist binding to the Gi-coupled receptor as it was completely inhibited by AR-C69931MX but unaffected by A3P5PS (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, using Fura-2-loaded platelets, we confirmed that, even under our experimental conditions, ADP-induced cytosolic Ca2+ increase was totally suppressed by the P2Y1 receptor antagonist A3P5PS but was unaffected by AR-C69931MX (Fig. 5C). Therefore, when ADP was allowed to bind exclusively to the P2Y12 receptor (i.e. in the presence of A3P5PS), Rap1B was activated, although cytosolic Ca2+ was not increased. By contrast, the sole binding of ADP to the P2Y1 receptor (i.e. in the presence of AR-C69931MX) did not result in Rap1B activation, although intracellular Ca2+ rose normally. These results indicate that a Gi-dependent pathway, rather than a cytosolic Ca2+ increase, is essential for activation of Rap1B. To confirm the essential role of a Gi pathway for Rap1B activation, we investigated whether, upon clustering of FcγRIIA, the inhibitory effect of ADP scavengers could be overcome by the simultaneous stimulation of the Gi-coupled α2A-adrenergic receptor by epinephrine. Fig. 6A actually shows that in the presence of apyrase, Rap1B activation triggered by FcγRIIA cross-linking could be restored by the simultaneous addition of epinephrine. By contrast, the addition of serotonin, which binds to a membrane Gq-coupled receptor, did not result in restoration of Rap1B activation. Our previous findings, indicating that stimulation of the Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptor by ADP is sufficient for activation of Rap1B, prompted us to investigate the ability of epinephrine alone to stimulate binding of GTP to Rap1B. As shown in Fig. 6B, treatment of platelets with 1 μm epinephrine caused a rapid and significant activation of Rap1B even in the absence of any other stimulus. Interestingly, stimulation of platelets with serotonin, which does not signal through Gi, produced only a slight activation of Rap1B (Fig. 6B). Using Fura-2-loaded platelets, we confirmed, in agreement with previous studies, that epinephrine did not cause any detectable Ca2+ movement (data not shown). By contrast, platelet stimulation with serotonin caused a small but significant increase of the intracellular concentration of Ca2+(from 50 ± 9 nm to 88 ± 16 nm, n = 6). Once again, these result"
https://openalex.org/W2109180697,"Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) belong to an evolutionary conserved family of transcription factors, the activity of which is tightly regulated by oxygen levels. We have recently demonstrated that hypoxia activates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in some cell types, and other works have suggested that this pathway is involved in the activation of HIF. In the present work we studied the role of this pathway in the induction of HIF by hypoxia. Under hypoxic conditions the PI3K/Akt pathway was activated in some (PC12 and HeLa) but not all cell types (HepG2) tested, whereas the HIF protein was induced by hypoxia in all cases. Kinetics analysis showed that, when observed, the activation of PI3K/Akt occurred after HIF induction. In addition, the chemical inhibition of PI3K had no significant effect on the induction of the HIF protein or its transcriptional activity but prevented Akt activation. Accordingly, transient overexpression of a dominant negative form of the regulatory subunit of PI3K in HEK293T cells did not interfere with the induction of the HIF-α protein by hypoxia or affect HIF-mediated transcription in any of the cell types tested. Moreover, forced activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway did not affect the transcriptional activity of HIF under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Thus, our data suggest that the activation of PI3K/Akt by hypoxia is cell type-specific and, when observed, lies downstream of HIF activation or in a parallel pathway. Furthermore, the activity of the PI3K/Akt is not sufficient for the activation of HIF nor is it essential for its induction by hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2141571845,"Since pharmacological interactions of the renin-angiotensin system appear to alter the neurological outcome of stroke patients significantly, we examined the effect of elevated levels of angiotensin II and the role of its receptor subtype AT1 in brain infarction in transgenic mice after focal cerebral ischemia. Angiotensinogen-overexpressing and angiotensin receptor AT1 knockout mice underwent 1 h or 24 h permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The current study revealed a much smaller penumbra size, i.e., brain tissue at risk, in angiotensinogen-overexpressing animals compared with their wild-type subgroup after 1 h MCAO, but an enlarged infarct size after 24 h. In contrast, a smaller lesion area of energy failure and a much larger penumbral area were found in AT1 knockout mice compared with wild-type littermates. Lower perfusion thresholds for ATP depletion and protein synthesis inhibition after MCAO in AT1-deficient mice and reduced cell damage in an in vitro model using embryonic neurons of AT1 knockout mice suggest injury mechanisms independent of arterial blood pressure. Our data, therefore, demonstrate a direct correlation between brain angiotensin II and the severity of ischemic injury in experimental stroke."

The cycle requires the reductive conversion of the characteristic intermediate 3-hydroxypropionate to propionyl-CoA. The specific activity of the 3-hydroxypropionate-, CoA-, K+-, and MgATP-dependent oxidation of NADPH in autotrophically grown cells was 0.09 μmol min−1 mg−1 protein, which was 2-fold down-regulated in heterotrophically grown cells.

The enzyme was purified 30-fold to near homogeneity and has a very large native molecular mass between 500 and 800 kDa, with subunits of about 185 kDa as judged by SDS-PAGE, suggesting a homotrimeric or homotetrameric structure. Upon incubation of this new enzyme, termed propionyl-CoA synthase, with the proteinase trypsin, the NADPH oxidation function of the enzyme was lost, whereas the enzyme still activated 3-hydroxypropionate to its CoA-thioester and dehydrated it to acrylyl-CoA.

C. aurantiacus grows optimally at 55 °C under heterotrophic conditions but can also grow in mineral salt medium with CO2 as sole carbon source (4.Holo H. Sirevåg R. Arch.

In thermal springs, filamentous Chloroflexus sp. and cyanobacteria form microbial mats that probably thrive photoautotrophically (11.van der Meer M.T.J. Schouten S. de Leeuw J.W. Ward D.M. Environ.

Indications for the operation of a similar pathway in autotrophic CO2 fixation have been obtained for acidophilic archaebacteria of the phylum Crenarchaeota, such as Acidianus brierleyi, Metallosphaera sedula, and Sulfolobus metallicus (12.Burton N.P.

The proposed 3-hydroxypropionate cycle is shown below in Fig. 1. Each turn of the cycle results in the net fixation of two molecules of bicarbonate into one molecule of glyoxylate. Acetyl-CoA is carboxylated to malonyl-CoA by conventional ATP-dependent acetyl-CoA carboxylase. In vitro, a straightforward reductive conversion of malonyl-CoA to propionyl-CoA was observed when NADPH, K+, CoA, and MgATP were added to cell extract (6.Strauss G. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 633-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This finding was surprising, because this conversion formally requires five enzymatic reactions and 3-hydroxypropionate as a free intermediate (see Fig. 1). 3-Hydroxypropionate formation is characteristic for the cycle; this metabolite is even excreted when cell growth becomes limited (3.Holo H. Arch. Microbiol. 1989; 151: 252-256Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Recently, we have purified the enzyme reducing malonyl-CoA and have shown that it is a bifunctional enzyme that requires two NADPH and forms 3-hydroxypropionate (15.Hügler, M., Ménendez, C., Schägger, H., and Fuchs, G. (2002) J. Bacteriol., in pressGoogle Scholar); 3-hydroxypropionate semialdehyde is an intermediate in this process. This new enzyme, malonyl-CoA reductase, has both alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase (CoA acylating) activity; the two partial reactions catalyzed are shown below in Fig. 1. The subsequent reductive conversion of 3-hydroxypropionate to propionyl-CoA formally requires three enzymatic reactions. The first step, activation to 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA, requires MgATP; the product of ATP hydrolysis, ADP or AMP, has not been identified. This knowledge is important for estimating the energy need for autotrophic CO2 fixation. So far, a CoA ligase catalyzing this reaction was assumed. The second step is the dehydration of 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA to acrylyl-CoA by an enoyl-CoA hydratase. The third step is the NADPH-specific reduction of acrylyl-CoA to propionyl-CoA by an enoyl-CoA reductase. This study originally aimed at purifying the first of these enzymes, the presumptive CoA ligase, converting 3-hydroxypropionate to its CoA-thioester. Much to our surprise, an enzyme is present in cell extracts of C. aurantiacus, which catalyzes the overall reductive conversion of 3-hydroxypropionate to propionyl-CoA. The enzyme was purified and characterized, and the gene encoding this new enzyme was identified. C. aurantiacus strain OK-70-fl (DSM 636) was grown at 55 °C anaerobically under photoautotrophic conditions on H2/CO2 (80%/20% (v/v)) or photoheterotrophically as described previously (15.Hügler, M., Ménendez, C., Schägger, H., and Fuchs, G. (2002) J. Bacteriol., in pressGoogle Scholar). The cells were harvested at an optical density (578 nm) of 3.5–4.0 and stored in liquid nitrogen until use. 3-Hydroxypropionate was obtained by hydrolysis of 3-hydroxypropionitrile as described previously (2.Herter S. Farfsing J. Gad′on N. Rieder C. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Fuchs G. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4305-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Two spectrophotometric assays were used.

Both reactions were started by the addition of 1 mm 3-hydroxypropionate and followed at 365 nm (εNAD(P)H = 3490 m−1cm−1). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (16.Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. dithioerythritol tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane 2-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid high performance liquid chromatography open reading frame acyl-CoA synthetase enoyl-CoA hydratase enoyl-CoA reductase All procedures were done aerobically at 4 °C. Thawed cell paste (10 g wet weight) of autotrophically grown cells was suspended in 15–20 ml of buffer A (100 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.8), 5 mmMgCl2) containing 0.25 mg of DNase I and passed twice through a chilled French pressure cell at 138 kPa. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The cell extract was incubated for 30 min at 63 °C and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min. Saturated ammonium sulfate solution was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 10% (NH4)2SO4 and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant from step ii was loaded onto a 25-ml Phenyl-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with buffer A containing 200 mm ammonium sulfate. After an 80-ml wash, the column was developed with a 250-ml decreasing linear gradient of 200–0 mm ammonium sulfate at 1 ml min−1. The peak of activity was eluted between 120 and 80 mm salt, and the pooled fractions were concentrated using an ultrafiltration unit fitted with a 10-ml membrane cell (cutoff, 10 kDa; Filtron, Karlstein, Germany). The concentrated enzyme solution from step iii was applied onto an 8-ml MonoQ HR 10/10 anion-exchange column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with buffer B (25 mm MOPS/NaOH (pH 7.2), 5 mm MgCl2). The column was washed with 15 ml of buffer B and developed with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl at 1 ml min−1. Propionyl-CoA synthase activity eluted between 300 and 340 mm salt. Active fractions were pooled and frozen at −20 °C. Aliquots of 1 ml from step iv were applied onto a 120-ml Superdex 200 HiLoad 16/60 column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with 20 mmMOPS/NaOH (pH 7.2), 100 mm NaCl. The column was developed at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1. The combined active fractions were concentrated as described above, and glycerol and DTE were added to a final concentration of 20% and 1 mm, respectively, and stored at −20 °C. The Km values of CoA, ATP, 3-hydroxypropionate or acrylate, and NADPH of the ATP-, CoA-, and NADPH-dependent reduction of 3-hydroxypropionate or acrylate were determined using propionyl-CoA synthase, obtained after the MonoQ chromatography step, and the standard reaction assay (a). The concentration of one substrate was varied, while keeping the concentration of the other substrates constant; the concentrations given were saturating. The stoichiometry of the reaction was determined by changing the concentration of either ATP, CoA, or 3-hydroxypropionate of the standard reaction assay to concentrations between 10 μm and 0.1 mm. After the reaction had come to completion, the amount of NADPH consumed was determined by measuring the overall absorption change at 365 nm. The stoichiometry of the 3-hydroyxpropionate-dependent formation of AMP was determined using assay (b) in the presence of NADH and NADPH. The pH optimum at 55 °C of the ATP-, CoA-, and NADPH-dependent reduction of 3-hydroxypropionate was determined by using the standard reaction assay (a) with 100 mm instead of 10 mm KCl and, instead of 100 mm Tris/HCl, the following buffers at 100 mmconcentrations (pH at 55 °C): MOPS/NaOH pH 6.8–7.3, HEPES/NaOH pH 7.2–8.1, TAPS/NaOH pH 7.7–8.9. The thermostability of the enzyme was determined by incubating the enzyme at 30, 40, 50, 60, 65, 72, 77, and 90 °C for 15 min. The enzyme solution was cooled to 4 °C before determining the activities relative to those of samples kept at 4 °C throughout the experiment. K+ and Mg2+dependencies were measured by omitting KCl or MgCl2 from the standard reaction assay and adding them back at defined concentrations. The specificity of the ATP-, CoA-, and NADPH-dependent reduction of 3-hydroxypropionate toward its substrate was determined by substituting 3-hydroxypropionate in the standard reaction assay by 10 mm neutralized 3-hydroxybutyrate, crotonate, acrylate, β-alanine, or by 1 mm glycolate and malonate; ATP by 3 mm GTP and UTP; NADPH by 0.4 mm NADH. An optical absorption spectrum of the purified enzyme (1.3 mg ml−1 in 20 mmMOPS/NaOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 300m KCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol) was collected at 25 °C using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda 2S spectrometer and the same buffer as a blank. To an aliquot of 200 μl of purified propionyl-CoA synthase (1.0 mg ml−1) 320 μl of 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.0), containing 20 μg of trypsin (Sigma), was added. To a second aliquot 320 μl of 10 mmammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.0), and no trypsin, was added and used as a control (“undigested”). After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, 20 μl of 1 mg ml−1 trypsin inhibitor was added. The activity of ATP-, CoA-, and 3-hydroyxpropionate-dependent oxidation of NADH and/or NADPH and the stoichiometry of 3-hydroxypropionate used per NAD(P)H supplied, was measured using assay (b), containing either 0.5 mm NADPH or 0.5 mm NADH or 0.25 mm NADPH plus 0.25 mm NADH. An optimized reaction mixture (0.6 ml), based on the standard reaction assay (a), containing 100 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.5), 2 mm DTE, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm CoA, 0.7 mm NADPH, and 25 μg of purified propionyl-CoA synthase was used. The enzymatic reaction was started by the addition of 1 mm 3-hydroxypropionate and stopped at different time points by transferring 100 μl of the reaction mixture to 3 μl of 25% HCl. CoA-thioesters were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC using an RP-C18 column (LiChrospher 100, endcapped, 5 μm, 125 × 4 mm; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). A 35-min gradient from 2% to 10% (v/v) acetonitrile, in 50 mm potassium phosphate-buffer, pH 6.7, at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1, was used. All CoA-esters were detected at 260 nm. Propionyl-CoA and acrylyl-CoA were synthesized enzymatically at 37 °C (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.5 mm NADH, 2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm CoA, 0.2 unit of myokinase, 0.1 unit of pyruvate kinase, 0.1 unit of lactate dehydrogenase, 0.1 unit of acetyl-CoA synthetase (Sigma), and 20 mm neutralized propionate or acrylate, reaction time: 3 min for propionate and 5 min for acrylate) and used as standards. SDS-PAGE (7%) was performed as described previously (17.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). The native molecular mass was determined on a 125-ml Sephacryl S-300 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) gel filtration column calibrated with ovalbumin (45 kDa), catalase (250 kDa), ferritin (450 kDa), and thyroglobulin (669 kDa). To an aliquot of 200 μl of purified propionyl-CoA synthase (0.6 mg ml−1) 320 μl of 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.0), containing 20 μg of trypsin (Sigma), was added. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, trichloroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 6% (w/v). The sample was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of 0.1 m NaOH. The trypsin-digested protein fragments were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon-Psq transfer membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). N-terminal sequencing was performed by TopLab (Martinsried, Germany) using an Applied Biosystems Procise 492 sequencer (Weiterstadt, Germany). The phenylthiohydantoin derivatives were identified with an on-line Applied Biosystems Analyzer 140 C. Small scale chromosomal DNA from C. aurantiacus was isolated using a standard technique (18.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

The PCR product was purified (19.Vogelstein B. Gillespie D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 615-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar) and sequenced at the sequencing facility at the University of Freiburg (Germany). The BLAST program (20.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59929) Google Scholar) was used to search protein data bases at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (Bethesda, MD), the local C. aurantiacus server (spider.jgi-psf.org/JGI_microbial/bin/psf_blast?PROJECT_ID = 2351478) at the DOE Joint Genome Institute (University of California, CA), and the Conserved Domain data base (Pfam) at Washington University (St. Louis, MO). Chemicals were obtained from Fluka (Neu-Ulm, Germany), Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), Sigma-Aldrich (Deisenhofen, Germany), or Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany); biochemicals were from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany), Applichem (Darmstadt, Germany), or Gerbu (Craiberg, Germany). Extracts of autotrophically grown cells of C. aurantiacus catalyzed the 3-hydroxypropionate-dependent oxidation of NADPH, provided that Mg2+, ATP, K+, and CoA were added. The specific activity at 55 °C was 0.09 μmol min−1mg−1 protein; this activity was 2-fold down-regulated in heterotrophically grown cells. The enzyme catalyzing the reductive transformation of 3-hydroxypropionate was purified from 10 g (wet weight) of autotrophically grown cells (Table I). An initial heat precipitation step was essential to remove large amounts of pigments. Three chromatographic steps yielded a nearly homogeneous protein, as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). The enzyme eluted as a symmetrical peak from the gel filtration column. The overall recovery was 16% and the enrichment about 30-fold, which means that this protein amounts to at least 3% of the soluble cell protein. Comparison of the soluble protein profile of cells grown hetero- versus autotrophically (Fig. 2) shows that the amount of enzyme is elevated under autotrophic growth condition, consistent with the higher specific activity measured under these conditions.Table IPurification of propionyl-CoA synthase from 10 g (wet weight) of autotrophically grown C. aurantiacusStepTotal activityProteinSpecific activityRecoveryPurificationμmol min−1mgμmol min−1mg−1%-foldCell extract37.44100.091(100)(1)30 min at 63 °C, 10% (NH4)2SO429.22800.10781.1Phenyl-Sepharose21.3171.35714MonoQ15.37.42.14123Gel filtration6.12.42.51628 Open table in a new tab SDS-PAGE of the purified enzyme showed a single protein band of ∼185 kDa (Fig. 2). Gel filtration chromatography of the native protein gave a molecular mass of 500–800 kDa. This indicates that the enzyme is a homotrimer or homotetramer. The UV-visible spectrum (250–800 nm) of the purified enzyme showed a single peak at 280 nm, with no indication for the presence of a chromophoric cofactor (data not shown). The enzyme was stable when incubated for 15 min at temperatures up to 65 °C and during storage in the presence of 20% glycerol and 1 mmDTE at −20 °C for a few weeks. The stoichiometry of the reaction was determined. Per mole of 3-hydroxypropionate added, 1 mol of NADPH was oxidized. The same stoichiometry was observed for ATP and for CoA. The products of the reaction were determined in different ways. HPLC analysis showed that propionyl-CoA was formed. To determine whether AMP plus pyrophosphate or ADP plus phosphate was formed from ATP, a coupled spectrophotometric assay was used. In the presence of NADH and NADPH the rate of NAD(P)H oxidation was increased by 190% over the rate of NADPH oxidation alone; this effect was strictly dependent on the addition of myokinase. Furthermore, the stoichiometry of NAD(P)H oxidized per mole of 3-hydroxypropionate added was 2.9:1. This shows ATP was hydrolyzed to AMP and pyrophosphate. The overall reaction catalyzed by the enzyme is as follows, 3­hydroxypropionate+MgATP+CoA+NADPH+H+→propionyl­CoA+MgAMP+PPi+H2O+NADP+ REACTION1 The enzyme is referred to as propionyl-CoA synthase. The enzyme showed high affinities for its substrates. The reaction followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with apparent Km values of 15 μm for 3-hydroxypropionate, 10 μm for NADPH, 50 μm for ATP, and 10 μm for CoA. The enzyme is also very specific; it does not act on glycolate, malonate, β-alanine, 3-hydroxybutyrate, or crotonate. Acrylate was transformed at the same rate as 3-hydroxypropionate, albeit with a much higher apparent Km value (0.5 mm). NADH could not substitute for NADPH, whereas ATP (100%) could be substituted by GTP (24%) and UTP (20%). Activity was dependent on K+, and half-maximal activity was observed at 4 mm KCl. The acrylate-dependent oxidation of NADPH in the presence of ATP and CoA was also dependent on K+, indicating that the CoA ligase step is K+-dependent. Monovalent cations with similar ionic radii (Rb+, NH4+, and Cs+) can partially substitute for K+ (95%, 85%, and 20%). There is a clear correlation of decrease in activity with the increase in ionic radius, relative to that of K+, indicating that this K+ dependence is not a general ionic strength effect. The pH dependence at 55 °C of the propionyl-CoA synthase catalyzed reaction shows a rather narrow pH optimum around pH 8 (Fig. 3). Between pH 6.8 and 7.9 the specific activity of the propionyl-CoA synthase increased 30-fold, indicating that a functional group in the enzyme with an estimated p Ka of 7.3 has to be deprotonated for maximum turnover. The vmax value was 4 μmol min−1 mg−1, corresponding to a turnover of 12 s−1 per subunit of 185 kDa. Product formation from 3-hydroxypropionate in the presence or absence of NADPH was studied to detect possible intermediates. In the absence of NADPH an unknown CoA-thioester (compound X) and acrylyl-CoA were formed (Fig. 4B). After addition of 1 mm NADPH, propionyl-CoA was formed (Fig. 4C), and the amount of compound X and acrylyl-CoA decreased. The consumption of compound X and acrylyl-CoA upon addition of NADPH suggests that both are intermediates of the reaction, and it is, therefore, likely that compound X represents 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA. The assignment of compound X as 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA is also consistent with its elution time after CoA and before propionyl-CoA. Native (undenatured) propionyl-CoA synthase was digested with the proteinase trypsin. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that the subunits of the enzyme were principally cleaved once, each subunit yielding two polypeptides, with estimated molecular masses of 150 and 40 kDa (Fig. 5). The trypsin-digested propionyl-CoA synthase was no longer able to catalyze the ATP-, CoA-, and 3-hydroxypropionate-dependent oxidation of NADPH (Table II). By coupling the formation of 1 mol of AMP to the oxidation of 2 mol of NADH using myokinase, phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase, it was shown that the trypsin-digested enzyme, however, still catalyzed the 3-hydroxypropionate- and CoA-dependent hydrolysis of ATP (Table II). The rate of 3-hydroxypropionate-, ATP-, and CoA-dependent formation of AMP for the trypsin-digested enzyme (0.5 μmol min−1 mg−1) was even increased over the rate of the same reaction catalyzed by undigested propionyl-CoA synthase (0.34 μmol min−1mg−1). In the presence of NADPH and trypsin-digested enzyme, only traces of propionyl-CoA were formed, whereas compound X was the major CoA-thioester formed (Fig. 4E). Acrylyl-CoA was also formed (Fig. 4E), indicating that the trypsin-digested propionyl-CoA synthase retained 3-hydroxypropionate-CoA ligase and acrylyl-CoA hydratase activity, whereas the acrylyl-CoA reductase activity was almost completely lost.Table IIRates of the ATP-, CoA-, 3-hydroxypropionate-dependent oxidation of NADPH and/or NADH by propionyl-CoA synthase and stoichiometry of NAD(P)H used per 3-hydroxypropionate suppliedPropionyl-CoA synthaseNADPHNADHSpecific activityStoichiometryaRatio is 3-hydroxypropionate used:NAD(P)H oxidized.mmmmμmol NAD(P)H oxidized min−1 mg−1Undigested0.501.51:1.000.50.671:2.20.250.254.31:2.8Trypsin digest0.50<0.1NAbNot applicable, because no activity was detected under these conditions.00.51.01:2.20.250.251.11:2.0The assay was performed in the presence of myokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and phosphoenolpyruvate at 45 °C to couple AMP formation to the oxidation of 2 NADH.a Ratio is 3-hydroxypropionate used:NAD(P)H oxidized.b Not applicable, because no activity was detected under these conditions. Open table in a new tab The assay was performed in the presence of myokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and phosphoenolpyruvate at 45 °C to couple AMP formation to the oxidation of 2 NADH. The N-terminal sequences of both polypeptides of the trypsin-digested propionyl-CoA synthase were determined as MIDTA for the 150-kDa polypeptide and ASTLLAAGAH for the 40 kDa polypeptide. A search of the data base of the almost completed genome of C. aurantiacus at the DOE Joint Genome Institute revealed a perfect match of the N-terminal sequence of the 150-kDa polypeptide to a putative protein encoded by an incomplete open reading frame (ORF) on contig 1024. A potential ribosome binding site (GGAGGA) ends 7 nucleotides upstream of the ATG codon for the N-terminal methionine. It is, therefore, concluded, that the MIDTA sequence represents the true N terminus of the propionyl-CoA synthase. The N-terminal sequence of the second (40 kDa) polypeptide revealed a perfect match to an internal sequence of a putative protein encoded by an incomplete ORF on contig 799. Based on the deduced amino acid sequence of this ORF, the N-terminal alanine of the 40-kDa polypeptide is preceded by an arginine residue in the native protein, which itself is preceded by four consecutive serine residues. This indicates a likely cleavage site for the proteinase trypsin. The missing DNA sequence between the two contigs was completed and deposited in the GenBankTM data base (accession number AF445079, Fig. 6). The gene encoding propionyl-CoA synthase from C. aurantiacus is referred to as pcs. The pcs gene encodes a protein with 1822 amino acids and a calculated molecular weight of 201,404. This value is within the estimated subunit molecular mass of 185 kDa for the purified protein (Fig. 2). The calculated molecular masses of the two polypeptides, after cleavage with trypsin, are 159 and 42 kDa, respectively. We have described a new enzyme, propionyl-CoA synthase, which functions in autotrophic CO2 fixation in C. aurantiacus and possibly other prokaryotes. Propionyl-CoA synthase catalyzes the irreversible reductive conversion of 3-hydroxypropionate to propionyl-CoA. The reaction consists of three partial reactions as shown in Fig. 1. The properties of the enzyme are summarized in Table III.Table IIIMolecular and catalytic properties of the new enzyme propionyl-CoA synthase from C. aurantiacusPropertySubstrates3-Hydroxypropionate, ATP, CoA, NADPHCocatalystsK+, Mg2+ProductsPropionyl-CoA, AMP + PPi, NADP+Specific activity4 μmol min−1 mg protein−1Apparent Km3-Hydroxypropionate 15 μm, CoA 10 μm, ATP 50 μm, NADPH 10 μmpH optimum8.1 (55 °C)Native molecular mass500–800 kDaSubunit molecular mass185 ± 10 kDaSuggested compositionα3 or α4Catalytic number12 s−1 (per subunit)Specificity3-Hydroxypropionate 100%, acrylate 100%, glycolate <1%, malonate <1%, β-alanine <1%, 3-hydroxybutyrate <1%, crotonate <1%, NADPH 100%, NADH <1%, ATP 100%, GTP 24%, UTP 20%Influence of cations (mm added)No divalent ions added 6%, Mg2+ (5) 100%, Mn2+ (5) 80%, Ca2+(5) 43%No monovalent ions added 3%, K+ (20) 100%, Rb+ (20) 95%, NH4+ (20) 85%, Cs+ (20) 30%, Li+ (20) 5% Open table in a new tab Propionyl-CoA synthase is a trifunctional enzyme. It belongs to the following enzyme classes: EC 6.2.1., ligases forming carbon–sulfur bonds (acid-thiol ligases); EC 4.2.1., carbon–oxygen lyases (hydro-lyases); and EC 1.3.1., oxidoreductases acting on the CH–CH groups of donors with NAD(P)+ as acceptor. The first partial reaction corresponds to organic acid-CoA ligase (AMP-forming), the second one to enoyl-CoA hydratase, and the third partial reaction to NADPH-dependent enoyl-CoA reductase. A search of protein data bases indicated that propionyl-CoA synthase consists of three protein domains (Fig. 6). Residues 18–850 of the deduced amino acid sequence of pcs showed significant sequence similarities to several acetyl-CoA and short fatty acid acyl-CoA synthetases from various organisms and was, therefore, named acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) domain. It showed highest percent sequence identity (35%) to an acetyl-CoA synthetase from Pyrobaculum aerophilum (GenBankTM accession number AAD09253). A multiple alignment of several homologous sequences indicated an untypical insertion of about 110 amino acids in the ACS domain of propionyl-CoA synthase, located within a consensus AMP binding domain (Pfam 00501) identified in all aligned sequences. The acyl-CoA synthetase (3-hydroxypropionate-CoA ligase) activity of propionyl-CoA synthase is K+-dependent, as has been shown for the acetyl-CoA synthetase from animal tissue (21.von Korff R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 203: 265-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enoyl-CoA hydratase (ECH) domain (Pcs amino acid residues 858–1051) showed 43% sequence identity to the 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase (crotonase) of Clostridium acetobutylicum(GenBankTM accession number AAK80658) and significant sequence similarity to other members of the enoyl-CoA hydratase family (Pfam 00378). Both glutamate residues shown to be involved in the enoyl-CoA hydratase-catalyzed reaction (22.Hofstein H.A Feng Y. Anderson V.E. Tonge P.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9508-9516Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) are conserved in propionyl-CoA synthase (E975 and E995). The enoyl-CoA reductase (ECR) domain (Pcs amino acid residues 1201–1816) is placed within the zinc-binding dehydrogenase family of proteins (Pfam 00107), however, the zinc-binding site is not conserved. An untypical insertion of about 180 amino acids is present in propionyl-CoA synthase compared with other members of this family, where this insertion is absent. Conserved residues of a NAD(P)H consensus binding motif (G XG X2A X3A) correspond to Gly-1415 to Ala-1424 of propionyl-CoA synthase. The highest sequence similarity (overall 28% sequence identity) was found with an alcohol dehydrogenase of Methylobacterium extorquens (GenBankTM accession number AAB26986) involved in an unknown acetyl-CoA to gloxylate pathway (23.Chistoserdova L.V. Lidstrom M.E. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1459-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The ECR domain is also homologous to NADPH-dependent crotonyl-CoA reductase of Streptomyces collinus (24.Wallace K.K. Bao Z.Y. Dai H. Digate R. Schuler G. Speedie M.K. Reynolds K.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 954-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The ECR domain has no significant sequence similarity to FAD-dependent acyl-dehydrogenases involved in fatty acid oxidation nor to enoyl-ACP reductases of the dissociated type II fatty acid synthases of prokaryotes. Significant similarity of the ECR domain of propionyl-CoA synthase was observed with the enoyl-ACP reductase domain of fatty acid type II synthases, however, this similarity only consists of a short region centered around the NAD(P)H consensus binding motif. It is this ECR domain that contains the site responsible for the cleavage of native propionyl-CoA synthase into two polypeptides by the proteinase trypsin (Figs. 5 and 6). Upon incubation of the enzyme with trypsin, propionyl-CoA synthase lost its ability to reduce acrylyl-CoA to propionyl-CoA almost completely (Table II and Fig. 4E). The residual activity is likely due to the incomplete digestion of propionyl-CoA synthase in the presence of trypsin (Fig. 5). The enzyme still showed 3-hydroxypropionate-CoA ligase and acylyl-CoA hydratase activity, consistent with the ACS and ECH domains staying mostly intact upon digestion of propionyl-CoA synthase with trypsin. The rate of the CoA- and 3-hydroxypropionate-dependent formation of AMP for the undigested enzyme in the absence of NADPH is 23% of the same rate in the presence on NADPH (Table II). A possible reason for the decrease in rate in the absence of NADPH is the slow release of 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA or acrylyl-CoA from the enzyme. This is consistent with the increased rate for AMP formation of the trypsin-digested enzyme, where a portion of the holoenzyme is missing, thus yielding possibly to a more open path for product release. The region between the ECH and ECR domains of propionyl-CoA synthase (residues 1132–1164) has 47% sequence identity to the linker region between the enoyl-CoA hydratase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase of the fatty acid oxidation complex (α subunit) of Vibrio cholerae (GenBankTM accession number AAF94206). There is, however, no entry in the protein data bases that represents a homolog to propionyl-CoA synthase having all three functional domains located on a single polypeptide. From a chemical point of view the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme is irreversible. The activation of the substrate to the CoA thioester and water elimination are reversible processes. However, pyrophosphate, the product of the CoA ligase reaction, is rapidly hydrolyzed in most cells, shifting the equilibrium to the product side. Notably, the NADPH-dependent reduction of enoyl-CoA compounds is irreversible. The standard potential of the NADPH/NADP+couple is −0.32 V; because in growing cells the NADPH/NADP+ ratio is normally ≥1, this value might be even slightly more negative under cellular conditions. The standard redox potential of the acrylyl-CoA/propionyl-CoA couple is +69 mV (25.Sato K. Nishina Y. Setoyama C. Miura R. Shiga K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 26: 668-675Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, the NADPH-dependent reduction of propionyl-CoA cannot be reversed. Reduction of 3-hydroxypropionate to propionyl-CoA is part of the proposed 3-hydroxy-propionate cycle. The enzyme fulfills the proposed role in all respects. First, the specific activity is high enough in autotrophically growing cells, which requires a specific activity for enzymes involved in the CO2 fixation cycle of at least 0.015 μmol−1 mg−1 protein (15.Hügler, M., Ménendez, C., Schägger, H., and Fuchs, G. (2002) J. Bacteriol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Second, the enzyme activity and protein levels are up-regulated in autotrophically versus heterotrophically growing cells. Third, propionyl-CoA synthase is highly specific for its substrates with Km values in the physiological range. Fourth, as a fusion protein catalyzing an entire reaction sequence of the pathway, leading from the key intermediate 3-hydropropionate to the CO2 acceptor propionyl-CoA, the enzyme is highly efficient. Its rate is only determined by the concentration of its diffusible substrates not in addition by the concentration of its intermediates. Furthermore, acrylyl-CoA, due to its double bond a reactive intermediate, is rapidly converted by the enzyme and, therefore, does not accumulate in the cell. These results show that propionyl-CoA synthase is a key enzyme in the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle of autotrophic CO2 fixation. It remains to be shown whether, using the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle, a similar trifunctional enzyme exists in other autotrophs, or whether a multifunctional enzyme complex or even separately functioning enzymes are operating.

After 24 h of infection, nearly half of interferon-γ-primed murine RAW 264.7 macrophage-like cells infected by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium contained filamentous bacteria. Bacterial filamentation indicates a defect in completing replication and has been previously observed in bacteria responding to a variety of stresses. To understand whether macrophage gene expression was responsible for this effect on Salmonella Typhimurium replication, we used gene arrays to profile interferon-γ-primed RAW 264.7 cell gene expression following infection. We observed an increase in MEK1 kinase mRNA at 8 h, an increase in MEK protein at 24 h, and measured phosphorylation of MEK's downstream target kinase, ERK1/2, throughout the 24-h infection period. Treatment of cells with MEK kinase inhibitors significantly reduced numbers of filamentous bacteria observed within macrophages after 24 h and increased the number of intracellular colony-forming units. Phagocyte NADPH oxidase inhibitors and antioxidants also significantly reduced bacterial filamentation. Either MEK kinase or phagocyte oxidase inhibitors could be added 4–8 h after infection and still significantly decrease bacterial filamentation. Oxidase activity appears to mediate bacterial filamentation in parallel to MEK kinase signaling, while inducible nitric-oxide synthase inhibitors had no significant effect on bacterial morphology. In summary, Salmonella Typhimurium infection of interferon-γ-primed macrophages triggers a MEK kinase cascade at later infection times, and both MEK kinase and phagocyte NADPH oxidase activity impair bacterial replication. These two signaling pathways mediate a host bacteriostatic pathway and may play an important role in innate host defense against intracellular pathogens.

These two signaling pathways mediate a host bacteriostatic pathway and may play an important role in innate host defense against intracellular pathogens. Macrophages serve a central role in host defense against pathogenic microbes by nature of their ability to rapidly recognize bacterial components, phagocytose pathogens, and activate an arsenal of antimicrobial effectors to contain and eliminate the microbe. A macrophage's repertoire of antimicrobial effectors includes the phagocyte NADPH oxidase (phox), 1The abbreviations used are: phoxphagocyte NADPH oxidasecfucolony-forming unitd-NMMANG-d-monomethyl arginineDPIdiphenyleneiodoniumERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinIFN-γinterferon-γiNOSinducible nitric-oxide synthasel-NMMANG-l-monomethylarginineLPSlipopolysaccharideROIreactive oxygen intermediateMEKmitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinaseDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFBSfetal bovine serumPBSphosphate-buffered salineGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), cationic antimicrobial peptides, and an endosomal system designed to restrict nutrients and traffic phagocytosed microbes to degradative lysosomes. Phox is a multisubunit complex that can be assembled on intracellular membranes, such as the phagosomal membrane and the plasma membrane. Phox activity produces superoxide that can lead to the generation of other toxic reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI), such as hydrogen peroxide, and combine with nitric oxide to generate peroxynitrite, all of which can directly cause oxidative damage to bacteria (1Vazquez-Torres A. Fang F.C. Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 29-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Macrophages activate many signaling pathways following recognition of bacterial components, although the relative contribution of each pathway to the induction of antibacterial effectors is not fully understood. For example, macrophages activate MEK/ERK kinase signaling in response to bacterial infection (2Procyk K.J. Kovarik P. von Gabain A. Baccarini M. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1011-1017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MEK is a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase that is activated by phosphorylation following Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium infection of macrophages in a Raf-dependent or -independent manner (3Jesenberger V. Procyk K.J. Ruth J. Schreiber M. Theussl H.C. Wagner E.F. Baccarini M. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Upon activation, MEK phosphorylates the downstream kinase ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), which then dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus where it activates transcription factors such as Elk-1 to modify gene expression (4Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). MEK/ERK signaling is involved in the activation of oxidative and nitrosative bursts, endosomal trafficking, and increased macrophage differentiation and therefore is a strong candidate for being involved in the augmentation of macrophage defenses against intracellular pathogens (5Rao K.M. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2001; 69: 3-10PubMed Google Scholar). phagocyte NADPH oxidase colony-forming unit NG-d-monomethyl arginine diphenyleneiodonium extracellular signal-regulated kinase green fluorescent protein interferon-γ inducible nitric-oxide synthase NG-l-monomethylarginine lipopolysaccharide reactive oxygen intermediate mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal bovine serum phosphate-buffered saline glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase In the murine model of human typhoid fever, SalmonellaTyphimurium resides intracellularly within macrophages (6Richter-Dahlfors A. Buchan A.M. Finlay B.B. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) in a specialized vacuole, and macrophages appear to be a preferred site for bacterial replication (7Wijburg O.L. Simmons C.P. van Rooijen N. Strugnell R.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 944-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As this intramacrophage niche helps to shield Salmonella from killing by components of the innate and humoral immune defenses, the responses of infected macrophages are thought to serve a central role in determining disease outcome (7Wijburg O.L. Simmons C.P. van Rooijen N. Strugnell R.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 944-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The interplay between host resistance factors and bacterial virulence factors are critical to determining the outcome of infection. On the host side, macrophages serve to limit the course of infection by destroying intracellular Salmonella Typhimurium or restricting bacterial replication by modifying its intracellular environment. Macrophages limit the availability of cations and nutrients required by Salmonella within its intracellular vacuole (8Kingsley R.A. Baumler A.J. Oelschlaeger T.A. Hacker J. Bacterial Invasion into Eukaryotic Cells. 33. Plenum, New York2000: 321-342Google Scholar). Both phox and iNOS are required for effective host resistance against Salmonella Typhimurium in the murine typhoid model (9Vazquez-Torres A. Jones-Carson J. Mastroeni P. Ischiropoulos H. Fang F.C. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 10Mastroeni P. Vazquez-Torres A. Fang F.C., Xu, Y. Khan S. Hormaeche C.E. Dougan G. J. Exp.

Immunity. 1999; 10: 29-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Cytokines secreted during infection, including interferon (IFN)-γ (12Gulig P.A. Doyle T.J. Clare-Salzler M.J. Maiese R.L. Matsui H. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 5191-5197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are essential for host defense against Salmonella infection. IFN-γ-primed macrophages may be important in mediating bacterial clearance in immune mice (7Wijburg O.L. Simmons C.P. van Rooijen N. Strugnell R.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 944-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and IFN-γ stimulation up-regulates the expression of many of these antimicrobial effectors and impairs replication of Salmonella Typhimurium within macrophages (12Gulig P.A. Doyle T.J. Clare-Salzler M.J. Maiese R.L. Matsui H. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 5191-5197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the bacterial side, while Salmonella Typhimurium initiate a pro-inflammatory response by macrophages, some bacteria are able to secure an intracellular niche within a distinct endosomal compartment where replication occurs 4–8 h after infection. Bacterial virulence protein mutants that cannot replicate within macrophages are strongly attenuated for systemic disease within the murine typhoid model, reinforcing the importance of Salmonella-macrophage interactions (13Fields P.I. Swanson R.V. Haidaris C.G. Heffron F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5189-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 14Shea J.E. Beuzon C.R. Gleeson C. Mundy R. Holden D.W. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 213-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Distinct antibacterial activities have been observed in macrophages at different times during infection (10Mastroeni P. Vazquez-Torres A. Fang F.C., Xu, Y. Khan S. Hormaeche C.E. Dougan G. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The responses of macrophages to intracellular Salmonella Typhimurium at later times post-infection are likely critical in mediating the outcome of infection but have not been well characterized, with most of the work centered upon the first few hours of infection. We demonstrate here that IFN-γ-primed RAW 264.7 macrophage-like cells are capable of restricting the bacterial replication that is permitted by naı̈ve RAW 264.7 cells. To identify host factors mediating this control of bacterial replication, we have used gene arrays to examine the transcriptional responses of IFN-γ-primed RAW 264.7 cells to intracellular Salmonella Typhimurium at 8 h post-infection. We identified up-regulated MEK1 kinase mRNA levels, which were confirmed at the levels of RNA, protein, and kinase activity. MEK activity correlated with inhibition of bacterial replication and induction of bacterial filamentation, an indicator of bacterial stress. MEK kinase and phox activities can impact each other, and we observed that phox inhibitors mimicked the effect of MEK inhibitors in reducing bacterial filamentation. MEK kinase or oxidase inhibitors added later during infection could significantly decrease bacterial filamentation, suggesting that MEK and phox activities at later times are primarily responsible for mediating bacterial filamentation. While phox activity can positively regulate as well as be regulated itself by MEK kinase activity, our results suggest that MEK and phox activities function in parallel to mediate bacterial filamentation. In summary, we provide evidence that Salmonella Typhimurium infection of IFN-γ-primed macrophages triggers a MEK kinase cascade and ROI production at later infection times and that both MEK kinase and phox activities impair bacterial replication, which is reflected by filamentation. The Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain SL1344 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA) and grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth. The plasmid pAT113-GFP (kindly provided by Dr. J. L. Gaillard, Paris, France) was introduced into SL1344 by electroporation (kindly provided by Dr. L. Knodler, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada). The Salmonella Typhimurium strain cs401 (14028S StrR) was kindly provided by Dr. S. Miller (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). For macrophage infections, 10 ml of LB in a 125-ml flask was inoculated from a frozen glycerol stock and cultured overnight with shaking at 37 °C to stationary phase. The murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 (TIB-72; ATCC) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) without antibiotics at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cultures were used between passage numbers 6 and 20. For the bacterial colony-forming unit (cfu) enumeration experiments described in Fig. 1, RAW 264.7 cells were either unprimed or cultured with 20 units/ml (2 ng/ml) IFN-γ (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 20–24 h prior to infection. For all subsequent experiments, cells were primed with IFN-γ prior to infection. For immunofluorescence and cfu experiments, IFN-γ-primed RAW 264.7 cells (1 × 105cells/well) were seeded in 24-well plates. Bacteria were diluted in culture medium to give a nominal multiplicity of infection of ∼100, bacteria were centrifuged onto the monolayer at 1000 rpm for 10 min to synchronize infection, and the infection was allowed to proceed for 20 min in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove extracellular bacteria and then incubated in DMEM + 10% FBS containing 100 μg/ml gentamicin (Sigma, Oakville, Ontario, Canada) to kill any remaining extracellular bacteria and prevent re-infection. After 2 h, the gentamicin concentration was lowered to 10 μg/ml and maintained throughout the assay. Intracellular survival/replication of Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344 was determined using the gentamicin resistance assay, as described previously (15Steele-Mortimer O. Meresse S. Gorvel J.P. Toh B.H. Finlay B.B. Cell Microbiol. 1999; 1: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with PBS to remove gentamicin, lysed with 1% Triton X-100/0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate in PBS at various times post-infection, and numbers of intracellular bacteria enumerated from cfu counts on LB agar plates. Under these infection conditions, macrophages contained an average of 1 bacterium per cell after 2 h as assessed by standard plate counts, which permitted analysis of macrophages at 24 h post-infection. IFN-γ-primed RAW 264.7 cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were seeded on 12-mm diameter glass coverslips in 24-well plates. Following infection with Salmonella Typhimurium for 24 h, fixation was performed with 2.5% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C. Fixed cells were washed three times with PBS and blocked in PBS containing 10% normal goat serum for 10 min. Extracellular bacteria were labeled by sequentially overlaying coverslips with a rabbit polyclonal primary antibody to Salmonella Typhimurium lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Difco, Detroit, MI) at 1:200 and an Alexa 568-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 1:400 in PBS + 10% normal goat serum for 20 min. Coverslips were mounted onto 1-mm glass sides using Mowiol (Aldrich). To quantify cells containing filamentous bacteria, only intracellular Salmonella Typhimurium were counted (not labeled by the extracellularly applied LPS-specific antibody). Bacteria were scored as “filamentous” when they were >3× longer than a typical bacterium (approximately >5 μm). Three populations were scored: the number of infected cells containing predominantly filamentous bacteria, the number of infected cells where >50% of intracellular bacteria were of normal size, and the number of infected cells containing bacteria that were all of normal size. Significance was determined by calculating p values using an unpaired two-tailed t test. The level of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Laval, Quebec, Canada) apoptotic cells was less than 10% for all conditions. At various times post-infection, IFN-γ-primed RAW 264.7 cells were washed once with PBS and scraped to detach the cells from the dish. RNA was then isolated using Trizol according to the manufacturer's directions (Invitrogen). RNA was extracted twice with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and once with chloroform. The RNA was then precipitated with 2.5 volumes of 100% ethanol and 0.10 volume sodium acetate, pH 5.2, resuspended in RNase-free water containing RNase inhibitor (Ambion, Austin, TX), and stored at −70 °C. RNA quality was assessed by gel electrophoresis and staining with ethidium bromide. Northern blots were prepared as described previously, using 5–10 μg of total RNA per lane (16Rosenberger C.M. Scott M.G. Gold M.R. Hancock R.E. Finlay B.B. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5894-5904Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). To prepare templates for probe synthesis, cDNA was prepared from total RNA purified from RAW 264.7 cells using oligo(dT) and SuperScriptII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The following primer pairs were designed to amplify portions of the indicated macrophage genes: MEK1, 5′-GTTGCTTTCAGGCCTCTCC-3′, 5′-AGTGATGGGCTCTGCTTAGG-3′; GAPDH, 5′-AGAACATCATCCCTGCATCC-3′, 5′-CTGGGATGGAAATTGTGAGG-3′. Antisense cDNA probes were prepared by PCR using 50 ng of the appropriate PCR product template, the reverse 3′-oligonucleotide, and modified nucleotides to facilitate repeated stripping of blots (Strip-EZ PCR, Ambion). These single-stranded PCR products were column-purified (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) and labeled with biotin using psoralen-biotin (Ambion) and cross-linking with 365 nm ultraviolet light. Overnight hybridization at 42 °C was with labeled probe in UltraHyb (Ambion). The BrightStar non-isotopic detection kit (Ambion) was used for probe detection according to the manufacturer's protocols. Northern blots were quantified by densitometry using an AlphaImager system (Alpha Innotech Co., San Leandro, CA). AtlasTM Mouse cDNA Expression Arrays I (7741-1; CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) consist of a matched set of positively charged membranes containing duplicate spots of 588 murine partial cDNAs.32P-Radiolabeled first strand cDNA probes were prepared from 5 μg of total RNA from each cell population using Moloney murine leukemia virus transcriptase and pooled primers specific for the 588 genes. Hybridization conditions and data analysis have been described previously (16Rosenberger C.M. Scott M.G. Gold M.R. Hancock R.E. Finlay B.B. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5894-5904Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). IFN-γ-primed RAW 264.7 cells (5 × 105/well) were seeded in six-well tissue culture plates and incubated overnight. At various times post-infection, cells were collected into 100 μl of boiling 5× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Total protein lysates were resolved on a 12% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gel, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline-0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. Antibodies were used at the following concentrations: rabbit anti-MEK1, 1:1000 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA); rabbit anti-phosphorylated MEK1, 1:1000 (New England Biolabs; kindly provided by Dr. B. Ellis, University of British Columbia); rabbit anti-ERK, 1:2000 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA); monoclonal phosphospecific anti-p44/p42 (ERK1/2), 1:2000 (New England Biolabs); and monoclonal anti-actin 1:15,000 (ICN, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Blots were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Baie d'Urfé, Quebec, Canada). Western blots were quantified by densitometry using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). IFN-γ-primed RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated with inhibitors for 30 min prior to infection at the following concentrations: 50 μm PD98059 (Calbiochem), 50 μm U0126 (Promega, Madison, WI), 4 μmdiphenyleneiodonium (DPI; Sigma), 250 μm acetovanillone (apocynin; Aldrich), 1 mm ascorbic acid (Sigma), 30 mmN-acetylcysteine (Sigma), 2 mmNG-l-monomethylarginine (l-NMMA, Molecular Probes), or 2 mmNG-d-monomethylarginine (d-NMMA, Molecular Probes). Fresh inhibitors were added immediately after infection, at 2 h, and 6–8 h post-infection to ensure potency. Control cells were treated with equivalent volumes of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) per ml of media. To remove inhibitors from pretreated cells, monolayers were washed three times with PBS at 8 h post-infection and then cultured for 16 h in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 10 μg/ml gentamicin. Intracellular ROIs were quantified by a luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence assay as described previously (17Dahlgren C. Karlsson A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 232: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 18Karlsson A. Nixon J.B. McPhail L.C. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2000; 67: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 106 IFN-γ-primed RAW 264.7 cells were seeded per well in six-well tissue culture plates and primed with IFN-γ for 24 h. Cells were pretreated with inhibitors or Me2SO in media and infected as described above. After 6 or 24 h of infection, cells were washed once with PBS, scraped into 200 μl of substrate warmed to 37 °C (PBS containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 5 × 10−5m luminol (5-amino-2,3-dihydro-1,4-phthalazinedione, Sigma) as an indicator of ROIs, and 50 units/ml superoxide dismutase (Sigma) and 2000 units/ml catalase (Sigma) to remove extracellular ROIs). Duplicate samples of 100 μl each were transferred to a clear-bottomed white 96-well plate, and chemiluminescence (light) units were quantified for 20 min using a TECAN spectrophotometer/luminometer (Männedorf, Switzerland), and the light units detected per minute over this time period were calculated. Nitrite concentration in extracellular medium of infected cells after 24 h was measured using a Griess reagent kit (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions. IFN-γ is essential for clearance of Salmonella Typhimurium within the murine typhoid model, and we have shown previously that IFN-γ has pleiotropic effects on macrophage transcriptional responses at early times to Salmonella Typhimurium infection (16Rosenberger C.M. Scott M.G. Gold M.R. Hancock R.E. Finlay B.B. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5894-5904Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). To establish a model for investigating macrophage responses that are effective in restricting Salmonella Typhimurium replication, we assessed the effect of IFN-γ on the ability of RAW 264.7 macrophage-like cells to control intracellular numbers of Salmonella Typhimurium. As shown in Fig. 1A, the number of intracellular Salmonella Typhimurium increased 6-fold over a 22.5-h period in RAW 264.7 cells. These cells permit Salmonella Typhimurium replication after 4–8 h, although avoidance of macrophage-mediated killing could partially contribute to the increase. In contrast, intracellular bacterial numbers did not increase in RAW 264.7 cells primed with IFN-γ over this same period (Fig. 1A). We hypothesized that IFN-γ-primed RAW 264.7 cells provide a more relevant model for studying macrophage responses that are effective in limiting Salmonella Typhimurium infection, as host factors should be maximally expressed in IFN-γ-primed RAW 264.7 cells that restrict intracellular bacterial numbers. This choice of model was strengthened by the observation that both primary murine macrophages and IFN-γ-primed RAW 264.7 cells restrict the intracellular load of Salmonella Typhimurium (19Buchmeier N.A. Heffron F. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 1-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IFN-γ priming of macrophages restricts intracellular Salmonella Typhimurium replication, but the precise mechanisms for this control are unclear (20Shtrichman R. Samuel C.E. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To better understand the interactions between macrophages and Salmonella Typhimurium, IFN-γ-primed RAW 264.7 cells were infected with Salmonella Typhimurium expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) and examined by fluorescence microscopy. While intracellular bacteria exhibited normal morphology after 8 h of infection, 47 ± 12% of infected cells contained filamentous bacteria that were >3× the length of a typical bacterium after 24 h (Fig. 1B). Filamentous bacteria were observed using another Salmonella Typhimurium strain (14028s), indicating that filamentation is shared by more than one strain of Salmonella Typhimurium (data not shown). Filamentous bacteria had partial or absent septa, suggesting a defect in completion of cell division, an indicator of bacterial stress (21Weiss D.S. Chen J.C. Ghigo J.M. Boyd D. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 508-520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hill T.M. Sharma B. Valjavec-Gratian M. Smith J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1931-1939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether macrophage gene expression was responsible for this effect on bacterial replication at later infection times, we used gene array analysis to profile the transcriptional responses of IFN-γ-primed RAW 264.7 cells to intracellular SalmonellaTyphimurium after infection for 4, 8, and 24 h. Hybridization of cDNA arrays indicated that MEK1 kinase mRNA levels were elevated in IFN-γ-primed RAW 264.7 cells at 8 h post-infection but not at 4 h post-infection (data not shown). This observed modest increase in MEK1 mRNA after 8 h of Salmonella Typhimurium infection was confirmed by Northern blot analysis. As seen in Fig. 2A, MEK1 mRNA was transiently up-regulated at 8 h and 18 h post-infection, was not observed prior to 8 h, and reduced to the level in uninfected cells at 24 h (n = 3). The increase in MEK1 mRNA 8 h after infection ranged from 1.2- to 2.5-fold relative to uninfected cells in each of eight experiments (Fig. 2B). We observed similar kinetics in the increase in MEK1 mRNA abundance in cells stimulated with 1 μg/ml Salmonella Typhimurium lipopolysaccharide for 8 or 24 h (LPS; data not shown). This increase in MEK1 mRNA after infection for 8 h was abrogated when cells were treated with the MEK kinase inhibitor U0126 prior to infection, suggesting that transcriptional up-regulation of MEK1 is mediated by prior kinase activity (Fig. 2A and quantification in Fig. 2B). While activation of MEK/ERK kinase cascades have previously been shown to occur within 1 h of Salmonella Typhimurium infection or LPS stimulation (2Procyk K.J. Kovarik P. von Gabain A. Baccarini M. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1011-1017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), MEK kinase activity at much later times of infection or its transcriptional regulation following infection has not previously been reported. The observed elevation of MEK1 mRNA level in Salmonella Typhimurium-infected IFN-γ-primed RAW 264.7 cells relative to uninfected cells was followed by increased MEK1 protein abundance at 24 h, as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2C). A modest increase in MEK1 protein of 1.5 ± 0.2-fold was detected at 24 h post-infection when normalized to actin protein and relative to uninfected cells (n = 4). This is of a comparable magnitude to the induction of MEK mRNA at 8 h post-infection. At the times when increases in MEK mRNA and protein abundance were measured, MEK protein was phosphorylated, an essential step in activation of MEK kinase. MEK phosphorylation was maximal at 1 h but remained sustained at a modest level in infected cells throughout 24 h, as seen in longer exposures of Western blots (Fig. 2C and data not shown). MEK activity could be detected throughout the infection period, as measured by Western blot analysis of phosphorylation of its downstream targets, the ERK1/2 kinases. As seen in Fig. 3,A–C, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was maximal within 1 h following stimulation, but phosphorylation remained elevated throughout the 24-h period examined when compared with uninfected cells (quantification of ERK2 phosphorylation in Fig. 3D). MEK1 abundance and activity were similar in IFN-γ-primed RAW 264.7 cells infected by Salmonella Typhimurium or stimulated with 1 μg/ml purified Salmonella Typhimurium LPS over 24 h. Therefore, up-regulated MEK1 mRNA, protein, and activity in IFN-γ-primed RAW 264.7 cells during a 24-h infection by S almonella Typhimurium ca"
https://openalex.org/W2053786654,"MENT (Myeloid andErythroid Nuclear Termination stage-specific protein) is a developmentally regulated chromosomal serpin that condenses chromatin in terminally differentiated avian blood cells. We show that MENT is an effective inhibitor of the papain-like cysteine proteinases cathepsins L and V. In addition, ectopic expression of MENT in mammalian cells is apparently sufficient to inhibit a nuclear papain-like cysteine proteinase and prevent degradation of the retinoblastoma protein, a major regulator of cell proliferation. MENT also accumulates in the nucleus, causes a strong block in proliferation, and promotes condensation of chromatin. Variants of MENT with mutations or deletions within the M-loop, which contains a nuclear localization signal and an AT-hook motif, reveal that this region mediates nuclear transport and morphological changes associated with chromatin condensation. Non-inhibitory mutants of MENT were constructed to determine whether its inhibitory activity has a role in blocking proliferation. These mutations changed the mode of association with chromatin and relieved the block in proliferation, without preventing transport to the nucleus. We conclude that the repressive effect of MENT on chromatin is mediated by its direct interaction with a nuclear protein that has a papain-like cysteine proteinase active site.

Woodcock C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3082-3089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In vitro, MENT brings about a dramatic remodeling and condensation of chromatin higher order structure by forming protein “bridges” connecting separate nucleosomes in nucleosome arrays (for review see Ref. 2.Grigoryev S.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). MENT has no homology with other known chromatin proteins but belongs to the intracellular branch of the serpin superfamily (3.Grigoryev S.A. Bednar J. Woodcock C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5626-5636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Serpins were originally characterized as serine proteinase inhibitors; however, more recently certain members have been shown to be capable of inhibiting other proteinase classes such as caspases (the viral serpin crmA (4.Ray C.A.

Silverman G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13465-13470Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar)). The inhibitory members of the serpin family are notable for their ability to undergo a large scale conformational transition (for review see Ref. 6.Whisstock J. Skinner R. Lesk A.M. Trends Biochem.

Multiple sequence alignments and comparison with known serpin structures reveal that MENT contains a large insertion, the “M-loop,” between the C- and D-helices. This loop contains two critical functional motifs as follows: a classical nuclear localization signal (NLS)1 that is required for nuclear import, and an AT-hook motif that is involved in chromatin and DNA binding (3.Grigoryev S.A. Bednar J. Woodcock C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5626-5636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Like other serpins, MENT possesses a reactive center loop (RCL) 2Numbering of the reactive center loop is according to the standard nomenclature defined by Schecter and Berger (48.Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4755) Google Scholar), in which the amino acids N-terminal to the site of cleavage are denoted P1, P2 … Pn, and those C-terminal to it are denoted P1′, P2′ … Pn′.2Numbering of the reactive center loop is according to the standard nomenclature defined by Schecter and Berger (48.Schechter I.

The presence of an inhibitory hinge motif (12.Hopkins P.C. Carrell R.W. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7650-7657Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) in its RCL suggests that MENT may retain the propensity for serpin-like conformational transitions and hence proteinase inhibition. An important question is whether MENT is indeed a proteinase inhibitor, and if so, whether this activity plays any role in the interaction between MENT and chromatin or fulfils an unrelated second function of the protein. We show that MENT is an effective inhibitor of the papain-like cysteine proteinase cathepsins K, L, and V, as well as a cysteine proteinase from CV-1 cells with characteristics similar to the recently described nuclear proteinase, SPase (13.Nishinaka T. Fu Y.H. Chen L.I. Yokoyama K. Chiu R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus MENT is the first known chromatin-associated cysteine proteinase inhibitor. We demonstrate that MENT imposes a strong repressive effect on cell proliferation when expressed in CV-1 and NIH/3T3 cells. Furthermore, by using a number of engineered variants (Fig. 1), we have found that the inhibitory activity of MENT, rather than DNA binding per se, is crucial for blocking cell proliferation. We thus show for the first time that a cysteine proteinase-inhibitor interaction can regulate cellular proliferation and modify chromatin structure. Unless otherwise noted, all fine chemicals were from Sigma. Sepharose resins and HiTrapTM columns were from Amersham Biosciences AB. Human cathepsins K, L, and V were expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified as described previously (14.Linnevers C.J. McGrath M.E. Armstrong R. Mistry F.R. Barnes M.G. Klaus J.L. Palmer J.T.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2377-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Papain was purchased from ICN (New South Wales, Australia). Sheep cathepsin L was purified from sheep liver as described previously (16.Dennison C. Moolman L. Pillay C.S. Meinesz R.E. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 284: 157-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Active enzyme concentration was determined by titration with the inhibitor E-64. A wild-type MENT (MENTWT)-expressing plasmid based on the pRc/cytomegalovirus vector (Invitrogen), pSG109, has been described previously (3.Grigoryev S.A. Bednar J. Woodcock C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5626-5636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Nucleotide substitutions and new endonuclease restriction sites were introduced into the MENT ORF by site-directed mutagenesis PCR (17.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar). The PCR amplifications employed the following primers encoding the 5′ and the 3′ ends of the MENT ORF: M49 (5′, forward), AGCAAGCTTAGATCTCAGCCATGGAACAGGTCTCGGCATC; M36 (3′, reverse), ATGTTCGAAGTGAGGAATAATTTATTCTAC. The following internal primers were used to introduce mutations: MENTP14R forward, AGAAAGGTCGCGAGGCAGCTGCTGCTACAGC, and MENTP14R reverse, AGCTGCCTCGCGACCTTTCTCATCAACTGC; MENTMLOOP- forward, TTCATTTCGAACAAGCTGAAAACATCCACTC, and MENTMLOOP- reverse, TCAGCTTGTTCGAAATGAAGAACCTCTGCCA; and MENTATHOOK- forward, AAAGGCGCCAAGGCGAAAGGAAAAAGAAGAAGAATGGACC, and MENTATHOOK-reverse, TTCGCC- TTGGCGCCTTTGGCCACAGAAGAGCTTTCAG. For each mutant, the first PCR amplification step was conducted between either M49 and one of the reverse primers or between M36 and one of the forward primers. Following this, the PCR products from the two reactions were mixed and the internal primers removed, and the PCR was continued using the flanking primers M49 and M36. PCR amplifications were carried out using Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Reaction cycles were carried out in a 30-μl volume using high-melting wax for “hot start” conditions, with 25 cycles each containing three 1-min steps at 94, 55, and 72 °C and finally 10 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were inserted between the HindIII and BstBI restriction sites in pSG109, replacing the MENTWT ORF. MENTOV was amplified using the reverse primer M36 and a pair of “nested” oligonucleotide primers: Mov2, GCTGGAGTGGATGCTGCTAGCGTCTCTGAAAAATTTAAGGTTGATCACC, and Mov1, AAAGGTCGCGAGGTGGTAGGGTCAGCAGAGGCTGGAGTGGATGCTGCT. The nested PCR product was used to replace MENTP14R by cutting and ligating at the NruI and BstBI restriction sites. To verify the DNA sequences, all plasmids were sequenced on both strands at the Hershey Medical Center sequencing facility. The resulting mutant ORFs were then excised by digestion with XhoI and EcoRI and ligated into XhoI/BamHI-cut pET-15b vector (Novagen) using EcoRI/BamHI linker DNA (GeneWorks, Australia). The location of the mutations is shown in Fig. 1. The pET-15b constructs were used to express MENT and its variants in the BL21Escherichia coli strain according to the vendor's protocol (18.NovagenpET System Manual. 9th Ed. Novagen, 2000Google Scholar), with the exception that expression was induced at an A600 of 1–1.1. Harvested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm NaPO4, pH 8.3, 2 m NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100) and disrupted using a final concentration of 1 mg/ml lysozyme and sonication. Following centrifugation, the soluble fraction was applied to nickel-charged chelating Sepharose resin and washed with 10 column volumes of lysis buffer. A buffer containing 50 mm NaPO4, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 25 mm imidazole was applied to the resin until the A280 returned to base line, and protein was eluted with 50 mm HEPES, 50 mmNaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 7.4. The eluate was diluted 2-fold into buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl) and loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrapTM SP column. After washing in the same buffer, a salt gradient was applied over 12 column volumes using 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1m NaCl; intact MENT eluted in the middle of the gradient. These fractions were diluted 1:10 into 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 1.7 m (NH4)2SO4, loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrapTM phenyl column, and eluted using a gradient over 10 column volumes into 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8. The (single band) purity of the proteins was verified using SDS-PAGE and their monomeric nature by using acid-PAGE (method appears below). The concentration of the protein was determined using an A280 measurement with reference to the predicted extinction coefficient (19.Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3436) Google Scholar). After dialysis into buffer A and concentration to ∼1 mg/ml, proteins were stored at −80 °C until use. A 20 μmconcentration of MENTWT was incubated with a 2 mm solution of a peptide corresponding to the P14–P9 residues of the antithrombin RCL (sequence SEAAAS, Auspep, Parkville, Australia) in buffer A at 37 °C for 16 h. A sample of MENTWT incubated in the absence of peptide did not lose activity under these conditions. Native gel electrophoresis confirmed the formation of complex with the peptide and, in conjunction with gel filtration, that peptide-complexed MENT did not polymerize. The gel system consisted of a 10% running gel (no stacking gel) with 260 mm Tris, pH 7.8, running gel, and 1× TBE tank buffer, pH 8.0, with migration of the protein toward the cathode. Enzyme assays were undertaken in pH 5.5 buffer (0.1 m acetate, pH 5.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) Brij-35, 10 mm cysteine) or an AMT buffer at pH 7.0 (0.05 m acetate, 0.05m MES, 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.0, 1 mmEDTA, 0.1% (w/v) Brij-35, 10 mm cysteine). The stability of cathepsin proteinases at neutral pH is often regarded as being low, although more recent studies (20.Dehrmann F.M. Coetzer T.H. Pike R.N. Dennison C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 324: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have indicated that the proteinases are more stable than previously thought in some buffer systems. Under the assay conditions used here, the cathepsins were found to be stable over the entire period of the experiment. The stoichiometry of inhibition (SI) was determined in pH 5.5 buffer. Briefly, 10 μl of 20 nm enzyme was mixed with varied concentrations of inhibitor, incubated for 45–100 min at 30 °C, diluted to 200 μl in buffer containing a final concentration of 10 μmN-Cbz-Phe-Arg-methylcoumarin substrate, and the residual enzyme activity measured using a Fluostar Galaxy plate reader (BMG Labtechnologies, Germany) with excitation/emission wavelengths of 370/460 nm, at 30 °C. Data analysis was carried out as described previously (21.Bjork I. Nordling K. Raub-Segall E. Hellman U. Olson S.T. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The second-order association rate constant (ka) was determined under pseudo first-order conditions using continuous kinetics. Within a given assay, the enzyme concentration was held constant, at a value between 0.025 and 0.5 nm, and the inhibitor concentration was always at least 20-fold higher, varying between 0.5 and 100 nm. All assays were conducted at 30 °C, using a 20 μm concentration of N-Cbz-Phe-Arg-methylcoumarin substrate in a total volume of 200 μl. Upon addition of enzyme to the inhibitor/substrate mixture, cleaved substrate fluorescence was monitored continuously using excitation/emission wavelengths of 370/460 nm. These fluorescence data were satisfactorily fitted, using least squares regression in PRISM (GraphPad Software), to Equation 1 describing slow, tight inhibitor binding (22.Rovelli G. Stone S.R. Guidolin A. Sommer J. Monard D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3542-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar),F=Vs·t+(V0−Vs)·1−e−kobs·tkobsEquation 1 where F is the absolute fluorescence value at time t; V0 is the velocity at time 0;Vs is the residual velocity once the reaction has run to completion; and kobs is the apparent second-order rate constant. The uncorrected second-order association rate constant (kunc) was obtained from the slope of the linear regression through a plot of kobsagainst inhibitor concentration. The substrate-corrected rate constant was finally obtained as shown in Equation 2,ka=kunc·1+[S]KmEquation 2 Km values for human cathepsin L and human cathepsin V were determined in this study for the hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate and were found to be essentially identical in both buffer systems. The Km values of 7.5 μm for human cathepsin K and 9.8 μm for sheep cathepsin L were obtained from previous studies (23.Brömme D. Okamoto K. Wang B.B. Biroc S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2126-2132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 24.Coetzer T.H. Dennehy K.M. Pike R.N. Dennison C. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 112: 429-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments showed that proteinase activity did not drop below 95% over the time course of the assays. Complex stability was assessed by incubating human cathepsin V with a 2-fold molar excess of MENTWT in pH 5.5 buffer at room temperature. Samples were removed at 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h, and activity was measured using the same conditions as when determining the SI (see above). An inhibitor-free control was also used and remained >80% active throughout the course of the assay. Molecular weight determinations of purified MENTWT and its products following digestion with cathepsin L were conducted using a linear MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Perseptive Biosystems Voyager) at the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine laboratory core facility. Molecular masses were found to be within 0.15%, using external and internal calibrants. The correspondence between mass determinations and the potential proteolytic products was analyzed using Protein Prospector 3.2.1 software. Complexes between MENT and cathepsins L or V were visualized using a modified version of a previously described native acid gel protocol (25.Zhou A. Faint R. Charlton P. Dafforn T.R. Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9115-9122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), in which the stacking gel, running gel, and tank buffers were 90 mmacetate, pH 6; 260 mm acetate, pH 5; and 40 mmβ-alanine, pH 5, respectively. Reaction mixtures with a final volume of 20 μl containing 4 μm MENT and 0–4 and 8 μm cathepsin V or 4 μm human cathepsin L in pH 5.5 buffer were incubated at room temperature for 5 min prior to electrophoresis. Protein migration was toward the cathode. Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (ICN, Australia). 4 μm MENT (20 μl volume) was incubated with 2 μm human cathepsin L or cathepsin V in 20 μl of pH 5.5 buffer for 5 min at room temperature and electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel (26.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar). CV-1 cells (ATCC CCL-70, derived from African green monkey kidney) were propagated in Eagle's BME medium (Invitrogen) with 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10% fetal calf serum, and 1× antibiotic/antimycotic solution. NIH/3T3 cells (ATCC CRL-658 derived from NIH Swiss mouse embryo) were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 g/liter glucose (Mediatech Inc.), 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 1× antibiotic/antimycotic solution, and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Cells were grown in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37.5 °C. Cells were transfected at about 80% confluency on 30-mm dishes using 12 μl of LipofectAMINE-2000 reagent (Invitrogen) for 5 h in serum-free growth media, as described in the vendor's manual. After transfection, cells were allowed to continue growing in their normal media for 48 h. To investigate SPase activity in CV-1 nuclei, control and MENT-expressing cells were grown on 100-mm plates to 90% confluency, washed in PBS buffer (0.14m NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 1.7 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.5), and resuspended in 4 ml Reticulocyte standard buffer (10 mm NaCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) also containing 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 (Invitrogen) and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Nuclei were separated from the cytoplasmic homogenate by centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 ×g. The pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of SPase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 400 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20% (v/v) glycerol (13.Nishinaka T. Fu Y.H. Chen L.I. Yokoyama K. Chiu R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar)). Nuclear debris was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 × g. The nuclear extract was diluted 5-fold into pH 5.5 buffer (see above), and the enzymatic activity was determined using N-Cbz-Phe-Arg-4-methoxy-β-naphthylamide substrate (13.Nishinaka T. Fu Y.H. Chen L.I. Yokoyama K. Chiu R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To assess Rb protein stability, the nuclear extract was incubated at 37 °C, and aliquots were taken and resuspended in Laemmli electrophoresis sample buffer. Rabbit polyclonal anti-MENT IgG was obtained and purified as described (27.Grigoryev S.A. Woodcock C.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 206: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Chicken polyclonal anti-sheep cathepsin L antibodies were obtained as described (28.Coetzer T.H. Pike R.N. Dennison C. Immunol. Invest. 1992; 21: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). For the immunoprecipitation reaction, 1.25 μg of MENT was mixed with 1.7 μg of sheep cathepsin L in 80 ml of buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, 4 mmdithiothreitol, pH 6.5, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction mixtures were then incubated with 5 μl of rabbit anti-MENT IgG at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction mixtures were rocked in a 1:1 suspension with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose, washed 3 times in reaction buffer, and finally resuspended by boiling in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. PAGE of proteins, Western blotting, and detection of MENT with anti-MENT antibodies and peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences RPN 2108) were conducted as described previously (1.Grigoryev S.A. Woodcock C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3082-3089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For detection of sheep cathepsin L, Western blots were first treated with chicken anti-cathepsin L antibodies (1:1000) and then with peroxidase-conjugated anti-chicken IgG (1:20,000). For detection of Rb protein, Western blots were first treated with mouse anti-human Rb antibodies (BD PharMingen; concentration 0.001 mg/ml in PBS containing 3.5% (w/v) BSA) and then with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences, dilution 1:2500). For fluorescent microscopy, CV-1 and NIH/3T3 cells expressing MENT were grown in 30-mm culture dishes on microscopy coverslips (thickness number 1, Fisher). Cells attached to the cover glasses were fixed with methanol/acetone (1:1 for 25 min at −20 °C), washed twice with PBS for 5 min, and blocked in PBS containing 3.5% (w/v) BSA for 5 min at room temperature. The specimens were overlaid with PBS containing 3.5% (w/v) BSA and anti-MENT IgG (dilution 1:400) and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. The washing and blocking was repeated, and the specimens were overlaid with PBS containing 3.5% (w/v) BSA and fluorescent secondary antibodies, Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes), and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed with PBS for 5 min, stained with 0.1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, and mounted in PBS containing 50% (v/v) glycerol and 0.5% (v/v) n-propyl gallate as an anti-bleach reagent. To detect the BrdUrd-incorporating nuclei, the coverslip-attached cells were stained with anti-MENT IgG as described above, washed for 5 min in PBS, and fixed by immersing in absolute methanol for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were then air-dried overnight in a light-protected space and rehydrated by immersing in PBS for 3 min. DNA was denatured by incubating coverslips in 4 m HCl for 30 min at room temperature. To neutralize the acid, the slips were immersed in 0.1m sodium borate buffer, pH 8.5, and the buffer was changed twice over a 10-min period. They were then washed 3 times for 3 min with PBS and overlaid with a 0.1-ml solution containing anti-bromodeoxyuridine-fluorescein (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Specimens were incubated for 60 min at room temperature in a dark, humidified chamber, washed twice for 5 min with PBS, and mounted for fluorescent microscopy as above. Fluorescence microscopy was conducted using an Eclipse E1000 automated microscope (Nikon Corp.) equipped with an Orca model C4742-95 digital camera (Hamamatsu Corp.). Image capturing and analysis was performed using Image-Pro Plus 4.1 software (Media Cybernetics), and image deconvolution was performed using the three-dimensional blind deconvolution algorithm by AutoDeblur 7.5 software (AutoQuant Imaging). Previous studies (1.Grigoryev S.A. Woodcock C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3082-3089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 3.Grigoryev S.A. Bednar J. Woodcock C.L. J.

We predicted that the bulky hydrophobic phenylalanine residue in the putative P2 position would allow MENT to inhibit members of the papain-like cysteine proteinase family. This is not unprecedented, because previous work by Schick et al. (29.Schick C. Pemberton P.A. Shi G.P. Kamachi Y. Cataltepe S. Bartuski A.J. Gornstein E.R. Brömme D. Chapman H.A. Silverman G.A.

It was found that recombinant MENT is an effective inhibitor of the human cysteine proteinases cathepsin L and V and sheep cathepsin L at pH 5.5, with ka values of 1.4 × 106m−1·s−1, 4.0 × 105m−1·s−1, and 2.2 × 105m−1·s−1, respectively (Tables I and II; Fig. 2a, right panel). The stoichiometry of inhibition was 1.0 with all three proteinases (Table I; Fig. 2a, left panel). MENT was also capable of inhibiting human cathepsins L and V at neutral pH (Table I). Intact MENT purified from chicken granulocyte nuclei (MENTNA) demonstrated similar inhibitory behavior (Table I) and was as efficient in immunoprecipitating sheep cathepsin L protein using anti-MENT antibodies as recombinant material, visualized by Western blot with antibodies against sheep cathepsin L (Fig. 2b, top left panel). A mutant lacking the M-loop (MENTMLOOP-, Fig. 1) gave almost identical SI and ka values to wild-type material, confirming that this region is not important for inhibitory activity (Table I).Table IThe inhibitory properties of MENTWT and its mutants at pH 5.5 and pH 7.0Cathepsin LCathepsin VInhibitor formSIKm= 15 μmSIKm= 15 μmka (m−1s−1)ka (m−1 s−1)pH 5.5 MENTWT1.01.4 × 1061.04.0 × 105 MENTMLOOP-1.21.2 × 1061.13.2 × 105 MENTNA1.03.9 × 1051.02.3 × 105 MENTP14RND1-aND, not detectable.503.4 × 103 MENTOVND112 MENT6-merNDNDpH 7.0 MENTWT2.6 × 1052.0 × 105 MENTMLOOP-1.9 × 1051.5 × 105The Km values of the enzymes for N-Cbz-Phe-Arg-methylcoumarin, determined in this study and essentially identical at both pH values, are shown.

As an indispensable protein in the NHEJ pathway, Ku has been hypothesized to be the first protein to bind at the DNA ends generated at a double strand break being repaired by this pathway. When bound to a DNA end, Ku improves the affinity of another DNA end-binding protein, DNA-PKcs, to that end. The Ku·DNA-PKcs complex is often termed the DNA-PK holoenzyme. It was recently shown that myo-inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) stimulates the joining of complementary DNA ends in a cell free system. Moreover, the binding data suggested that IP6 bound to DNA-PKcs (not to Ku). Here we clearly show that, in fact, IP6 associates not with DNA-PKcs, but rather with Ku. Furthermore, the binding of DNA ends and IP6 to Ku are independent of each other.

Double strand DNA breaks are among the most lethal DNA lesions, and they arise in somatic cells of multicellular eukaryotes spontaneously in the absence of external factors (1.Karanjawala Z.E.

Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Ku improves the DNA end binding affinity of the 469-kDa DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) (7.West R.B. Yaneva M. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5908-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). DNA-PKcs is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is only active when bound to DNA ends (8.Anderson C.W. Carter T.H. Jessberger R. Lieber M.R. Molecular Analysis of DNA Rearrangements in the Immune System. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1996: 91-112Google Scholar). When Ku and DNA-PKcs are both bound at the same DNA end, the complex is referred to as the DNA-PK holoenzyme, whereas the 469-kDa DNA-PKcs is termed the catalytic subunit (hence the subscript designation, cs) (9.Gottlieb T. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). The physiologic phosphorylation target of the 469-kDa DNA-PKcs has not been identified (10.Anderson C.W. Lees-Miller S.P. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1992; 2: 283-314PubMed Google Scholar). After the DNA ends are trimmed into a form that is ligatable, a complex of XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV is responsible for carrying out the ligation specifically of double-strand breaks (11.Wilson T.E.

Evidence for the importance of Ku in eukaryotic NHEJ has been documented by a large body of genetic evidence (reviewed in Refs. 6.Lieber M.R. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar,18.Lieber M.R. Am. J.

Res. 1999; 434: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Cells genetically deficient for either subunit of Ku are ionizing radiation sensitive. In addition, they are unable to carry out the rejoining phase of V(D)J recombination, which is a physiologic DNA double strand breakage and rejoining process restricted to lymphoid cells. The same phenotypic characteristics apply to other NHEJ components. In vitro, Ku has a high affinity for DNA ends (KD = 10−9) (7.West R.B. Yaneva M. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5908-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 20.Ma Y. Lieber M.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9638-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and binds other single to double strand DNA transitions (21.Smider V. Rathmell W.K. Brown G. Lewis S. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6853-6858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inositol phosphate metabolism is a known form of intracellular signaling, primarily in the cytoplasm (22.Irvine R.F. Schell M.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). There are only two lines of work describing effects of inositol phosphates on nuclear processes. One set of studies describes the roles of inositol phosphates on mRNA transport and transcriptional regulation (23.York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 24.Odom A.R. Stahlberg A. Wente S.R. York J.D. Science. 2000; 287: 2026-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The second nuclear role of inositol phosphates was in NHEJ in nuclear extracts in which compatible DNA ends were studied for joining (25.Hanakahi L. Bartlet-Jones M. Chappell C. Pappin D. West S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 721-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In this latter study, it was reported that inositol hexakisphosphate stimulates the joining of complementary DNA ends in a cell-free system and associates with DNA-PK based on the co-elution of IP6 and DNA-PK kinase activity from a gel filtration column. It was not determined in this study whether IP6 was binding to the 469-kDa DNA-PKcs or to the Ku that was in the DNA-PK preparation. However, the homology of DNA-PKcs to proteins related to phosphatidylinositol metabolism was taken as an implicit indication that the IP6 binds to the DNA-PKcs rather than to Ku. Here we demonstrate that, in fact, the IP6 binds to Ku but not to DNA-PKcs, and the binding of DNA ends and IP6 to Ku seem to be independent of each other. IP6 and myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) were purchased from Sigma. Tritiated IP6([3H]IP6, 20.5 Ci/mmol) and IP3([3H]IP3, 21.0 Ci/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Native DNA-PKcs was purified as described previously (26.Chan D.W. Mody C.H. Ting N.S. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) except that HeLa cells were used as the source for purification. C-terminal His-tagged Ku70 and nontagged Ku86 were co-expressed in the baculovirus system and purified as described previously (27.Yaneva M. Kowalewski T. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5098-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Nontagged Ku was expressed and purified as described previously (28.Walker J.R. Corpina R.A. Goldberg J. Nature. 2001; 412: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar) (a gift of Dr. J. Goldberg). The concentration of purified proteins was estimated by comparing to bovine serum albumin (BSA) standards on a Coomassie Blue stained SDS-PAGE gel. Immuno pull-down of IP6 was performed in 50-μl reactions that contain 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA. Anti-Ku70 monoclonal antibody (clone N3H10, NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA), anti-Ku86 monoclonal antibody (clone 111, NeoMarkers), and anti-DNA-PKcs monoclonal antibodies (clone 42-27 and 25-4) were used as indicated to reach a final total antibody amount of 20 μg in each reaction. The rest of the reagents were added to each 50-μl reaction as indicated: 1 pmol of [3H]IP6 or [3H]IP3, 25–50 pmol of 35-bp DNA YM-8/YM-9 (blunt ds DNA, YM-8 5′-AGG CTG TGT TAA GTA TCT GCG CTC GCC CTC AGA GG-3′), 6.2–10 pmol of Ku, and 2.5 pmol of DNA-PKcs. Then, 100 μl of 50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and 350 μl of binding buffer were added to make the final volume 500 μl. The pull-down reactions were allowed to proceed for 1 h at 4 °C with constant mixing. After washing in the same binding buffer (without BSA) for 4 times (0.8–1 ml of buffer for each time), the beads were resuspended in 200 μl (2 × 100 μl) of binding buffer (without BSA) then mixed into 2 ml of ScintiVerse II scintillation fluid (Fisher Scientific). The amounts of bead-associated 3H were measured in a liquid scintillation analyzer (model Tri-Carb 2100TR, Packard BioScience, Meriden, CT). In each 50-μl reaction (contains the same buffer components as the immuno pull-down reactions), 50 pmol of 5′-biotinylated 35-bp DNA YM-8/YM-9, 6.2 pmol of Ku, and 1 pmol of inositol phosphate were used. 100 μl of 50% streptavidin agarose (Sigma) were then added into each reaction. The binding, washing, and scintillation counting steps were carried out as described above. The gel shift assay was performed as described previously (20.Ma Y. Lieber M.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9638-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and 0.5 nm labeled YM-6/YM-7 (20.Ma Y. Lieber M.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9638-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and 1 nm Ku were used for all the reactions. IP6 and IP3 were diluted in H2O first and then added to the reaction mixtures to the indicated final concentrations. The SPR experiment was done as described previously (7.West R.B. Yaneva M. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5908-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 20.Ma Y. Lieber M.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9638-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A 5′-biotinylated 35-bp DNA (sequence is the same as YM-8/YM-9) was immobilized on the streptavidin-coated surface of the sensor chip (Sensor chip SA, Biacore, San Diego, CA). Ku was diluted in the running buffer and injected at a flow rate of 5 μl/min for 4 min. The injection of Ku was repeated to ensure that the surface-immobilized DNA on the sensor chip was saturated with Ku. Then DNA-PKcs (to a final concentration of 6.1 nm) and additional reagents (1 mm ATP, 1 mmMgCl2, and 0.1 mm IP6 or IP3, final concentration indicated) were mixed in the running buffer and injected at 5 μl/min for 4 min. Proteins bound to the sensor chip were allowed to dissociate for 6 min before the surface was regenerated with 0.05% SDS. The resulting sensorgrams were edited using the BIAevaluation software (version 3.0). A previous study on the association of DNA-PK and IP6 used a DNA-PK preparation that contained Ku and, possibly, contaminating DNA fragments (25.Hanakahi L. Bartlet-Jones M. Chappell C. Pappin D. West S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 721-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We were interested in testing whether binding of IP6 to DNA-PK was dependent on Ku and/or DNA ends. Native DNA-PKcs and recombinant Ku were purified as described previously. DNA-PKcs was immobilized on protein G-Sepharose beads via monoclonal antibodies against it. Tritiated-IP6was incubated with these Immunobeads in the absence or presence of Ku and a 35-bp DNA (under the buffer conditions specified under “Experimental Procedures”). The DNA length of 35 bp was chosen, because this permits the binding of Ku and DNA-PKcssimultaneously to the same DNA molecule (7.West R.B. Yaneva M. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5908-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The radioactivity associated with the extensively washed beads was then measured using a liquid scintillation counter. Surprisingly, IP6 showed no association with DNA-PKcs alone, above the low level of background binding to the protein G-Sepharose beads (Fig. 1A, histogram bar 2 versus bar 1). This lack of association between IP6 and DNA-PKcs was obtained regardless of the presence of the 35-bp linear DNA (Fig. 1A, bar 3 versus bar 2). When IP6 was added to DNA-PKcs immunobeads along with Ku, there was only a near background level of binding detcted (Fig. 1A, bar 4), in agreement with our observation that Ku does not associate with DNA-PKcs in the absence of DNA (see below). Interestingly, when the binding of IP6 to DNA-PKcs was tested in the presence of Ku and 35-bp DNA, a substantial amount of binding was observed (Fig. 1A, bar 5). This could be because Ku induces a conformational change in DNA-PKcs to permit its binding of IP6. Alternatively, IP6 might bind at the interface between Ku and DNA-PKcs when both are present on DNA, because 35 bp is long enough for Ku and DNA-PKcs to co-localize (7.West R.B. Yaneva M. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5908-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Alternatively, IP6 may simply bind to Ku. To test this, we omitted DNA-PKcs entirely and examined the binding of IP6 to bead-immobilized Ku via monoclonal anti-Ku antibodies. In this case, we observed a very high level of IP6 binding (Fig. 1A, bar 6). The specificity of binding of IP6 to Ku was tested with another inositol polyphosphate, IP3, and only a background level of binding was detected (Fig. 1A, bar 7). Hence, it appeared that IP6 was in fact binding to Ku rather than to DNA-PKcs We wanted to rule out the possibility that the six-amino acid histidine affinity tag on Ku70 might be responsible for the association between IP6 and recombinant Ku. To test this, we compared the binding of IP6 to purified Ku with and without the tag, and the association of IP6 to these different preparations of Ku was indistinguishable (Fig. 1B). Therefore, the binding of IP6 to Ku is completely unaffected by the affinity tag. To investigate the role of DNA in the interaction between IP6 and Ku, we used a monoclonal antibody against Ku70 to immobilize the Ku heterodimer. The level of binding was quite high, regardless of whether the 35-bp ds DNA was present (Fig. 2A, bars 1 and 2). Immobilization with an anti-Ku86 monoclonal antibody gave indistinguishable results (Fig. 2A, bars 3 and 4). As shown above, the binding of IP6 to Ku was specific because IP3 failed to bind (Fig. 2A, bar 5). As was the case for anti-DNA-PKcs monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 1, bars 1–4 and 7), none of the anti-Ku antibodies bound to IP6 (data not shown) nor to IP3 (Fig. 2A, bar 5). These data clearly indicate that IP6 binds to Ku rather than to DNA-PKcs, and this binding is independent of the presence of DNA. Further evidence for the binding of IP6 to Ku can be observed when the experiments are configured in a manner where a linear DNA fragment was immobilized on streptavidin-agarose beads via a 5′-biotin linkage, and Ku was added to these DNA beads. IP6associated with the Ku·DNA beads, while IP3 did not (Fig. 2B, bars 1 and 2). The streptavidin-agarose beads coated with biotinylated DNA could pull down the Ku·IP6 complex as efficiently as protein G-Sepharose coated with anti-Ku antibodies (Fig. 2B, bar 1 versus bars 3 and 5). This is additional conclusive evidence that IP6 binds to Ku, and this interaction is unaffected by DNA. We and others have previously done detailed studies of the binding of Ku to DNA ends. Recently, we showed that on linear DNA long enough to bind two Ku molecules (two-site linear DNA), the second Ku molecule loads with a 14-fold higher equilibrium constant (20.Ma Y. Lieber M.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9638-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Namely, the two Ku molecules bind cooperatively to a two-site DNA molecule. We were interested in testing whether the binding properties of the Ku·IP6 complex loading onto this two-site DNA would be altered compared with the loading of Ku alone onto the same DNA. To test this, concentrations of Ku and two-site DNA were chosen such that about 50% of Ku would bind to DNA; under these conditions, each 45-bp DNA molecule contains either one or two Ku molecules. The concentration of IP6 was then varied over a 100,000-fold range that surrounded the physiologic concentration range of IP6 in eukaryotic cells. Neither the noncooperative first Ku binding nor the cooperative second Ku binding was altered by IP6 (Fig. 3A). Hence, it does not appear that IP6 alters the association of Ku with DNA ends. Ku has been designated “the DNA-binding subunit” of DNA-PK holoenzyme due to the fact that it enhances the binding of DNA-PKcs to a Ku-bound DNA end and stimulates the kinase activity of DNA-PKcs (9.Gottlieb T. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Therefore, the binding of IP6 to Ku might affect the fraction of DNA-PKcsthat is in a complex with Ku and DNA. The kinase activity of DNA-PK on a synthetic substrate is not altered by IP6 (25.Hanakahi L. Bartlet-Jones M. Chappell C. Pappin D. West S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 721-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility that IP6 might interfere or enhance the binding of DNA-PKcs to a Ku-bound DNA end, an SPR experiment was designed. The SPR technology allows the real-time monitoring of the changes in the mass of macromolecules associated with a surface. In our experiment, a biotinylated 35-bp ds DNA was immobilized on a streptavidin-coated surface. Ku was then allowed to bind to the free end of the DNA molecules on the surface to saturation or near saturation (achieved by two consecutive injections of the same Ku solution). The binding of DNA-PKcs was tested in the presence of IP6 or IP3. Neither the association phase (the ascending phase starting with the injection of DNA-PKcs) nor the dissociation phase (the descending phase starting with the termination of injection) was altered by IP6. This suggests that IP6 does not affect DNA-PKcs in the association with the Ku·DNA complex. These results demonstrate that IP6, but not IP3, binds to Ku, and neither IP6 nor IP3 associate with DNA-PKcs. Previous work indicated that IP6enhanced the efficiency of DNA end joining in a cell extract system that was sensitive to inhibitors of DNA-PKcs (25.Hanakahi L. Bartlet-Jones M. Chappell C. Pappin D. West S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 721-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In that study when the mixture of IP6 and DNA-PK was fractionated by a gel filtration column, one peak of IP6 (detected by scintillation counting of each fraction) and the peak of DNA-PK (determined by assaying DNA-PK activity of each fraction) co-migrated. In light of our data, which indicate that Ku actually associates with IP6, one plausible explanation for the earlier observation could be that there was some contaminating DNA in the commercial DNA-PK preparation that allowed the association of Ku and DNA-PKcsand, therefore, the association of IP6 and DNA-PK. We have previously shown that DNA-PKcs and Ku do not associate in the absence of DNA ends (27.Yaneva M. Kowalewski T. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5098-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), and this observation has been confirmed by our laboratory (7.West R.B. Yaneva M. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5908-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In the current study, the failure to co-immunoprecipitate the Ku·IP6 complex by DNA-PKcs immunobeads (Fig. 1, bar 4) further supported this point. Trace levels of Ku·DNA-PKcsassociations seen by some laborartories may actually be due to low levels of contaminating DNA that can co-purify with DNA-PKcs, if specific purification steps are not included to remove the DNA. The contaminating DNA can then serve to bind both Ku and DNA-PKcs on the same fragments, given that Ku·DNA complexes bind DNA-PKcs 100-fold more efficiently than DNA alone can bind to DNA-PKcs. IP6 was reported to enhance the efficiency of joining of compatible DNA ends by crude cell extracts (25.Hanakahi L. Bartlet-Jones M. Chappell C. Pappin D. West S.C.

One possible significance of this interaction could be that IP6 alters some unidentified function(s) of Ku. A second possibility is that the Ku·IP6 complex might interact with other factors in a way such that the overall NHEJ efficiency could be stimulated. Ku has been reported to physically and functionally interact with DNA-PKcs (only in presence of DNA ends) (9.Gottlieb T. Jackson S.P.

The alteration of the activities of any of these enzymes might result in a profound effect on the outcome of NHEJ. The elucidation of the function of Ku-IP6 interaction awaits further studies.

Lieber and Dr. Steve West corresponded as it became clear that both laboratories had discovered that IP6 and Ku interact."
https://openalex.org/W2069502744,"Imaginal disc growth factor-2 (IDGF-2) is a member of a recently described family of Drosophila melanogaster-soluble polypeptide growth factors that promote cell proliferation in imaginal discs. Although their precise mode of action has not been established, IDGFs cooperate with insulin in stimulating the growth of imaginal disc cells. We report the crystal structure of IDGF-2 at 1.3-Å resolution. The structure shows the classical (βα)8 barrel-fold of family 18 glycosyl hydrolases, with an insertion of an α + β domain similar to that of Serratia marcescens chitinases A and B. However, amino acid substitutions in the consensus catalytic sequence of chitinases give IDGF-2 a less negatively charged environment in its putative ligand-binding site and preclude the nucleophilic attack mechanism of chitin hydrolysis. Particularly important is the replacement of Glu by Gln at position 132, which has been shown to abolish enzymatic activity in chitinases. Nevertheless, a modest conservation of residues that participate in oligosaccharide recognition suggests that IDGF-2 could bind carbohydrates, assuming several conformational changes to open the partially occluded binding site. Thus, IDGFs may have evolved from chitinases to acquire new functions as growth factors, interacting with cell surface glycoproteins implicated in growth-promoting processes, such as the Drosophila insulin receptor.

Thus, IDGFs may have evolved from chitinases to acquire new functions as growth factors, interacting with cell surface glycoproteins implicated in growth-promoting processes, such as the Drosophila insulin receptor. imaginal disc growth factor N-acetylglucosamine The different adult epidermal structures of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster derive from larval sheets of epithelial cells called imaginal discs. Although imaginal disc cells are dependent on soluble growth factors for their survival and proliferation, numerous attempts by homology searching and genetic analysis to identify proteins with direct mitogenic activity have been unsuccessful (1.Hipfner D.R. Cohen S.M. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 718-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Recently, however, protein factors with the ability to stimulate imaginal disc cell proliferation have been isolated by fractionating conditioned medium from imaginal disc cell cultures (2.Kawamura K. Shibata T. Saget O. Peel D. Bryant P.J. Development. 1999; 126: 211-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These growth-promoting molecules, termed imaginal disc growth factors (IDGFs),1 belong to a new family of glycoproteins that comprises at least five members (IDGF 1–5) having ∼50% amino acid sequence identity to one another. Although no specific growth-promoting activity has been assigned to a previously described glycoprotein designated DS47 (3.Kirkpatrick R.B. Matico R.E. McNulty D.E. Strickler J.E. Rosenberg M. Gene. 1995; 153: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), its sequence homology and a similar pattern of expression suggest that DS47 represents a sixth member of the IDGF family (2.Kawamura K. Shibata T. Saget O. Peel D. Bryant P.J. Development. 1999; 126: 211-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IDGFs, which act at nanomolar concentrations, are among the first polypeptide growth factors to be identified from invertebrates (2.Kawamura K. Shibata T. Saget O. Peel D. Bryant P.J. Development. 1999; 126: 211-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Homma K. Matsushita T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13770-13775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). IDGFs are expressed not only in larval imaginal discs but also throughout all developmental stages in variable patterns, from early embryo to different larval glands and tissues, as well as in adult nurse cells and oocytes (2.Kawamura K. Shibata T. Saget O. Peel D. Bryant P.J. Development. 1999; 126: 211-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IDGFs are also strongly expressed in the fat body (5.Bryant P.J. Novartis Found Symp. 2001; 237: 182-194PubMed Google Scholar), in accordance with early reports showing that the fat body produces mitogenic factors (6.Davis K.T. Shearn A. Science. 1977; 196: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 7.Shearn A. Davis K.T. Hersperger E. Dev. Biol. 1978; 65: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). At present, however, little is known about how IDGFs promote cell proliferation. These growth factors have been shown to act with mammalian insulin in stimulating imaginal disc cell growth through the Drosophila insulin receptor, suggesting a role as cofactors for Drosophila insulin or insulin-like molecules (2.Kawamura K. Shibata T. Saget O. Peel D. Bryant P.J. Development. 1999; 126: 211-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IDGFs present 15–25% amino acid sequence homology to family 18 glycosyl hydrolases, which includes the chitinases, enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of β-(1, 4)-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine linkages in chitin polymers of the arthropod cuticle (8.Henrissat B. Davies G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). However, IDGFs have no known catalytic activity. In this respect, several proteins with sequence homology to chitinases but no detectable enzymatic activity have been described in vertebrates, indicating that the typical chitinase-like fold may be present in proteins with a wide range of biological functions other than chitin degradation (9.Buhi W.C.

Arita H. Hayai N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1279-1286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and porcine GP38K is associated with tissue remodeling (14.Shackelton L.M. Mann D.M. Millis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13076-13083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Although IDGF-2 was first obtained and characterized from conditioned medium of imaginal disc cell cultures, we have found that the Schneider SL3 embryo-derived cell line produces IDGF-2 under similar growth conditions. This is in agreement with the identification of DS47, a likely member of the IDGF family, in culture supernatants of S2, also an embryo-derived cell line (3.Kirkpatrick R.B. Matico R.E. McNulty D.E. Strickler J.E. Rosenberg M. Gene. 1995; 153: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We have purified IDGF-2 from SL3 cells grown in supplemented complete medium and then allowed to condition serum-free medium. The purified glycoprotein was crystallized, and its three-dimensional structure was determined at high resolution, revealing the characteristic (βα)8 or triose-phosphate isomerase barrel-fold of family 18 glycosyl hydrolases (8.Henrissat B. Davies G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). The structure enables us to explain some of the unique characteristics of IDGF-2, including the lack of chitinase activity. Certain features of the site homologous to the chitin-binding site of chitinases may be of significance for the recognition of putative ligands, such as the insulin receptor, that may account for its potent growth-promoting effects on Drosophila cells. Embryo-derived Schneider SL3 Drosophila cells were routinely cultured in suspension (shaker flasks) at 28 °C, in Sf-900 II medium supplemented with 3% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). In the last passage before harvesting, cells were diluted 1:5 in Drosophila SFM medium (Invitrogen), without addition of fetal bovine serum. Cells were grown for 3 days in this medium and then harvested. After centrifugation, the culture supernatant was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, and concentrated 4-fold using a spiral cartridge ultrafiltration system (Amicon, Beverly, MA). The supernatant was then applied to a Q-Sepharose anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9. IDGF-2 eluted at 50 mm NaCl using a linear salt gradient. The protein was further purified with a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences) run under similar conditions. The final yield of IDGF-2 was ∼2 mg/liter culture. Protein identity was verified by N-terminal sequencing. Two crystal forms of IDGF-2 were obtained, trigonal and orthorhombic (Table I). The trigonal form belongs to space group P3221 with unit cell dimensions a = b = 106.4 Å, c = 90.0 Å, α = β = 90.0o, γ = 120o. These crystals were grown by mixing aliquots of protein solution, at 10 mg/ml, with an equal volume of the reservoir solution consisting of 12% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 msodium acetate, pH 5.0, at 4 °C. The orthorhombic form belongs to space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions a = 49.5 Å, b = 72.2 Å,c = 105.8 Å, α = β = γ = 90.0o. These crystals were obtained at 25 °C in 25% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.0, using IDGF-2 at 15 mg/ml. In both crystal forms, only one molecule is present in the asymmetric unit. For cryogenic data collection, crystals were harvested in a modified reservoir solution containing 20% ethylene glycol as cryoprotectant and flash-cooled by plunging into propane or liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at beamline X12B of the Brookhaven National Synchrotron Laboratory (for the trigonal form) and at beamline X11 of the Deutsche Elektronen Synchrotron (for the orthorhombic form) on ADSC quantum4 and Mar Research CCD plate detectors, respectively. Data were integrated, scaled, and merged using the HKL package (16.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar).

Normalized structure factors from 15 to 4.5 Å were used in AMoRe (18.Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar) rotation and translation functions. Model phases were improved by wARP (19.Perrakis A. Ouzounis C. Wilson K.S. Folding Des. 1997; 2: 291-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The resulting electron density map allowed unambiguous rebuilding of the molecule. The orthorhombic crystal form was readily solved by molecular replacement using partially refined coordinates from the trigonal form. For both crystal forms, refinement was performed using CNS1.0 (20.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar), including bulk solvent correction and overall anisotropic scaling, interspersed with iterative rounds of model rebuilding using O (21.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). A last round of individual anisotropic B-factor refinement was carried out using SHELX for both crystal forms (22.Sheldrick G. Shneider T. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar). Only procedures that minimized both Rcryst and Rfree were used. The final model includes 91.2 and 89.1% of all residues fitted to both averaged and unaveraged ςA-weighted 2Fo −Fc and Fo −Fc electron density maps, for the trigonal and orthorhombic forms, respectively. All regions of IDGF-2 are well ordered, with the exception of the missing loop between Val-141 and Ile-161. Both models contain residues 2 to 141 and 161 to 420; 701 and 439 solvent atoms were assigned for the trigonal and orthorhombic forms, respectively. The present Rcryst = 17.6% and Rfree= 20.2% for all data (F > 0) between 100 and 1.3 Å for the trigonal crystal form. For the orthorhombic form, Rcryst= 19.5% and Rfree = 25.9% for all data (F > 0) between 20 and 1.7 Å. Refinement statistics for both crystal forms are given in Table I. Atomic coordinates of the trigonal and orthorhombic forms of IDGF-2 have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession codes 1JND and 1JNE, respectively (http://www.rcsb.org). Structure superpositions were done with SHP (23.Stuart D.I. Levine M. Muirhead H. Stammers D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 134: 109-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Figs. were produced with GRASP (24.Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5311) Google Scholar), MOLSCRIPT (25.Kraulis P.J.

Sequence alignments were carried out in ClustalW at ExPASy (www.expasy.ch), and subsequently edited manually based on the known structures of chitinase A (Protein Data Bank accession code 1CNV), chitinase B (1E15), hevamine (2HVM), and Ym1 (1E9L). Sequences were retrieved from GenBankTM or SwissProt (IDGFs 1–4, AAC99417–20; IDGF-5, AAF57703.1; DS47, AAC48306; BRP39, S61550; HCGP-39, AAA16074; GP38K, AAA86482; YKL-39, AAC50597; oviduct specific glycoprotein, Q28990). Fig. 3 was drawn using ESPript (28.Gouet P. Courcelle E. Stuart D.I. Metoz F. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar). The structure of IDGF-2 was solved in two different crystal forms, trigonal and orthorhombic (Table I). Both forms show essentially the same structure, with a root-mean-square difference of 0.5 Å for 398 Cα atoms. The greatest deviation occurs in an external loop comprising residues 320–340 that can be attributed to differences in crystal packing. Because better resolution (1.3 Å) was achieved with the trigonal crystal, further description of the structure is based on this crystal form. The electron density maps are of high quality, as shown in Fig. 1. A carbohydrate chain can be traced attached to Asn-200 at the conserved N-linked glycosylation site in IDGFs (2.Kawamura K. Shibata T. Saget O. Peel D. Bryant P.J. Development. 1999; 126: 211-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The visible sugar residues include two N-acetylglucosamines (NAGs) and two mannoses. The NAGs are linked to their neighbor by β(1–4) linkages and a α(1–3) linkage binds the last Man residue. As predicted from amino acid sequence similarity, IDGF-2 adopts the characteristic fold of family 18 glycosyl hydrolases (8.Henrissat B. Davies G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar), the (βα)8 barrel (residues 2–279 and 371–420), consisting of an eight-stranded parallel β-barrel (β1-β8) surrounded by eight α-helices antiparallel to the barrel (α1-α8) (Fig. 2). An insertion in the barrel motif between strand β7 and helix α7 (residues 280–370) forms an additional domain with an α + β-fold that is also present in S. marcescens chitinases A and B (17.Perrakis A.

Interestingly, this feature is common to most chitinase-like proteins described to date, although the length of the insertion varies (Fig. 3).

Despite low sequence homology (22–25% similarity), a few conserved residues of family 18 glycosyl hydrolases, also present in IDGF-2, seem essential to maintain the barrel folding (Fig. 3; residues in white over red background) and, in the case of active chitinases, the catalytic and substrate-binding sites (33.Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Hennig M. Dijkstra B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). IDGF-2 has three cis peptide bonds, two of them not involving a proline residue: Gly-39–Tyr-40, Pro-295–Val-296, and Phe-394–Asp-395 (Fig. 3). The first and third are conserved in all family 18 chitinase structures and appear to be necessary for correct folding of the barrel. The aromatic residues involved in these cis bonds (Tyr-40 and Phe-394) seem to be important for binding of substrate in all glycosyl hydrolases with triose-phosphate isomerase barrel-folds (40.Jabs A. Weiss M.S. Hilgenfeld R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 291-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The Pro-295–Val-296 cis bond is located in the inserted α + β domain but is not conserved in chitinase A or B from S. marcescens (17.Perrakis A. Tews I. Dauter Z. Oppenheim A.B. Chet I. Wilson K.S. Vorgias C.E. Structure. 1994; 2: 1169-1180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). There are two disulfide bridges in the IDGF-2 structure, which are also found in the murine chitinase-like lectin Ym1 (39.Sun Y.-J. Chang N.-C.A. Hung S.-I. Chang A.C. Chou C.-C. Hsiao C.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17507-17514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The first, between Cys-6 and Cys-33, links strand β1 with the loop between helix α1 and strand β2. The second, formed by Cys-322 and Cys-405, connects the α-helix in the inserted α + β domain with the loop between strand β8 and helix α8. These Cys residues are conserved in all six IDGF family members, as well as in a human chitotriosidase (41.Renkema G.H. Boot R.G. Au F.L. Donker-Koopman W.E. Strijland A. Muijsers A.O. Hrebicek M. Aerts J.M.F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 504-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and in mammalian chitinase-like proteins with no chitinase activity (Fig. 3). In contrast, the Cys residues involved in disulfide bond formation in IDGF-2 are not present in family 18 glycosyl hydrolases from plants or bacteria. In (βα)8 barrel enzymes, loops between β strand C termini and the N-terminal portion of α-helices (loops βXαX, X being the number of the strand in the barrel) are usually involved in interactions with substrate and in catalytic activity. These loops, although fairly variable in length and amino acid composition, conserve some key residues responsible for catalysis and substrate binding (33.Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Hennig M. Dijkstra B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). This is also true for chitinase-like proteins with no apparent enzymatic activity, as seen in Fig. 3. Loop β4α4 (residues 131–165) is distinctly long in the IDGF family. Although neither of our two crystal forms shows electron density between Val-141 and Ile-161, the location of these boundary residues on the surface of the IDGF-2 structure suggests that the β4α4 loop should be fully exposed to solvent. Furthermore, this loop appears to have undergone proteolytic cleavage. Thus, SDS-PAGE analysis of purified IDGF-2, as well as of redissolved crystals, revealed only a faint band at 47 kDa (the expected molecular mass of the intact protein), along with two prominent bands at 18 and 29 kDa that together represented >90% of the total protein (data not shown). N-terminal sequencing of the 18-kDa band gave the sequence ASNLV XYYDSS XYTREGLGK, corresponding to the predicted N terminus following removal of the signal peptide during secretion of mature IDGF-2 to the external medium. The 29-kDa band yielded the sequence TGDFIVDPHAALHKEQ, implying a nick between Phe-156 and Thr-157. The lack of electron density for most residues of the 131–165 loop may reflect disorder resulting from this cleavage. It is also possible that at least some of residues 142–160 have been excised in our preparations. Importantly, cleaved and uncleaved IDGF-2 display comparable activity in imaginal disc cell proliferation assays, demonstrating that an intact 131–145 loop is not essential for IDGF-2 function. 2P. J. Bryant, personal communication. The active site of chitinases is situated in a cleft formed by the C termini of the β-strands and loops βXαX, which presents aromatic and negatively charged residues to the substrate (Fig. 4B). A Glu residue (e.g. Glu-315 in chitinase A) is the key proton donor during hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond (42.Lin F.-P. Chen H.-C. Lin C.-S. IUBMB Life. 1999; 48: 199-204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43.McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar) and is usually imbedded in a hydrophobic environment that contributes to substrate binding, with other negatively charged residues facilitating the nucleophilic attack of the catalytic Glu. In IDGF-2 and other IDGF family members, the corresponding residue is Gln-132 (Fig. 3, blue star; Fig. 4A). This substitution is seen in other chitinase-like proteins with no apparent enzymatic activity (Fig. 3) (13.Owhashi M. Arita H. Hayai N. J. Biol.

Previous studies have shown that these pumps comprise a membrane-integrated, proton-translocating (V0), and a soluble catalytic (V1) subcomplex connected to one another by a thin stalk region. We present two three-dimensional maps derived from electron microscopic images of the complete V-ATPase complex from the plant Kalanchoe daigremontiana at a resolution of 2.2 nm. In the presence of a non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue, the details of the stalk region between V0 and V1 were revealed for the first time in their three-dimensional organization. A central stalk was surrounded by three peripheral stalks of different sizes and shapes. In the absence of the ATP analogue, the tilt of V0changed with respect to V1, and the stalk region was less clearly defined, perhaps due to increased flexibility and partial detachment of some of the peripheral stalks. These structural changes corresponded to decreased stability of the complex and might be the initial step in a controlled disassembly."

The Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV) undergoes a remodelling akin to that of the host cell's endocytic pathway, but SCV progression is arrested prior to fusion with lysosomes. We studied the role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) in SCV maturation within HeLa cells. Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), monitored in situ using fluorescent conjugates of FYVE or PX domains, was found to accumulate transiently on the SCV. Wortmannin prevented PI3P accumulation and the recruitment of EEA1 but did not affect the association of Rab5 with the SCV. Importantly, inhibition of PI3-K also impaired fusion of the SCV with vesicles containing LAMP-1. Rab7, which is thought to be required for association of LAMP-1 with the SCV, still associated with SCV in wortmannin-treated cells. We have therefore concluded that a 3-phosphoinositide-dependent step exists following recruitment of Rab7 to the SCV. The data also imply that 3-phosphoinositide-dependent effectors of Rab5 are not an absolute requirement for recruitment of Rab7.

The net effect of these bacterial proteins is the induction of pronounced ruffling of the host cell membrane, leading to the internalization of the bacteria into a Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV).1Initially, the composition of the SCV resembles that of the host's early endocytic compartment. Distinctive endosomal markers such as the early endosome autoantigen 1 (EEA1), the transferrin receptor, and Rab5 are detectable on the membrane of the early SCV (5.Hashim S. Mukherjee K. Raje M.

At later stages, the SCV acquires selectively some, but not all, of the proteins known to be present in the host cell late endosomes. Thus, although the lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1) (12.Garcia-del Portillo F. Zwick M.B. Leung K.Y. Finlay B.B. Infect.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 81-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) is largely excluded. More importantly, unlike the late endosome, the SCV fails to merge with lysosomes. This diversion of the endocytic traffic is dictated by an additional set of bacterial proteins encoded by a separate pathogenicity island in the Salmonella genome. These proteins are also delivered via a type III system to the host cell cytosol, protecting the bacteria from exposure to the degradative environment of the lysosome (15.Hensel M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1015-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).The normal traffic of cellular endomembranes is directed by several types of regulatory proteins, including the Rab family of small GTPases (16.Bock J.B.

The fusion of early endosomes is directed by Rab5, in conjunction with several effector proteins that include EEA1 (17.Christoforidis S. Miaczynska M. Ashman K. Wilm M. Zhao L. Yip S.C.

Finlay B.B. Cell Microbiol. 1999; 1: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), but their precise roles in vacuolar maturation are not well defined. EEA1 attaches directly to Rab5, but this interaction needs to be stabilized by PI3P, a product of the type III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), VPS34. The latter is also thought to be a Rab5 effector (17.Christoforidis S. Miaczynska M. Ashman K. Wilm M. Zhao L. Yip S.C. Waterfield M.D. Backer J.M. Zerial M. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar).Recently, PI3P was reported to be an essential factor in the normal maturation of endosomes (19.Simonsen A. Wurmser A.E. Emr S.D. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) and also of phagosomes (20.Vieira O.V. Botelho R.J. Rameh L. Brachmann S.M. Matsuo T. Davidson H.W. Schreiber A. Backer J.M. Cantley L.C. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), which more closely resemble the SCV. It therefore appeared likely that this phosphoinositide could also play a role in SCV development and raised the possibility that alterations in the metabolism of PI3P may contribute to the maturation arrest of the vacuole. The purpose of the present experiments was therefore to analyze the metabolism of PI3P during the course of invasion of mammalian cells by Salmonella.It recently became apparent that modular domains within certain proteins have the ability to interact with the headgroups of defined phosphoinositides. Two types of domains have been identified that recognize PI3P with great selectivity and considerable affinity: FYVE domains, such as the one present in EEA1 (21.Gaullier J.M. Simonsen A. D'Arrigo A. Bremnes B. Stenmark H. Aasland R. Nature. 1998; 394: 432-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), and PX domains (22.Cheever M.L. Sato T.K. de Beer T. Kutateladze T.G. Emr S.D. Overduin M.

Toh B.H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Both Rab5 and EEA1 have been detected on the early SCV (5.Hashim S. Mukherjee K.

Finlay B.B. Cell Microbiol. 1999; 1: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), but their precise roles in vacuolar maturation are not well defined. EEA1 attaches directly to Rab5, but this interaction needs to be stabilized by PI3P, a product of the type III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), VPS34. The latter is also thought to be a Rab5 effector (17.Christoforidis S. Miaczynska M. Ashman K. Wilm M. Zhao L. Yip S.C. Waterfield M.D. Backer J.M. Zerial M. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Recently, PI3P was reported to be an essential factor in the normal maturation of endosomes (19.Simonsen A. Wurmser A.E. Emr S.D. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) and also of phagosomes (20.Vieira O.V. Botelho R.J. Rameh L. Brachmann S.M. Matsuo T. Davidson H.W. Schreiber A. Backer J.M. Cantley L.C. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), which more closely resemble the SCV. It therefore appeared likely that this phosphoinositide could also play a role in SCV development and raised the possibility that alterations in the metabolism of PI3P may contribute to the maturation arrest of the vacuole. The purpose of the present experiments was therefore to analyze the metabolism of PI3P during the course of invasion of mammalian cells by Salmonella. It recently became apparent that modular domains within certain proteins have the ability to interact with the headgroups of defined phosphoinositides. Two types of domains have been identified that recognize PI3P with great selectivity and considerable affinity: FYVE domains, such as the one present in EEA1 (21.Gaullier J.M. Simonsen A. D'Arrigo A. Bremnes B. Stenmark H. Aasland R. Nature. 1998; 394: 432-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), and PX domains (22.Cheever M.L. Sato T.K. de Beer T. Kutateladze T.G. Emr S.D. Overduin M.

https://openalex.org/W2074489367,"Belonging to the family of steroid hormones, glucocorticoids are essential for development and survival of vertebrates. The cellular response to glucocorticoids is attributed to the glucocorticoid receptor, which functions as a transcription factor. However, the majority of glucocorticoid-modulated genes lack a DNA binding site for the glucocorticoid receptor, raising the question of which mechanism mediates the responses to glucocorticoids. It has been suggested that besides direct DNA binding of the glucocorticoid receptor, interaction with members of other transcription factor families modulates the effect of the glucocorticoid receptor. However, the significance of such transcription factor interaction is not clear. In cultured human mesenchymal cells and peripheral blood leukocytes of human volunteers treated with glucocorticoids, we detected the formation of a complex between the GR and the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha. In in vitro experiments, this interaction turned out to be responsible for the inhibitory action of glucocorticoids on lymphocytic and mesenchymal cell proliferation. Our results suggest that complex formation of the GR with C/EBPalpha accounts for a novel pathway of glucocorticoid action."

DM43 inhibited the fibrinogenolytic activities of bothrolysin and jararhagin and formed 1:1 stoichiometric stable complexes with both metalloproteinases. DM43 was ineffective against atrolysin C or A. No complex formation was detected between DM43 and jararhagin C, indicating the essential role of the metalloproteinase domain for interaction. Homology modeling based on the crystal structure of a killer cell inhibitory receptor suggested the existence of an I-type Ig fold, a hydrophobic dimerization surface and six surface loops potentially forming the metalloproteinase-binding surface on DM43.

Enzymes from Snake Venom. Alaken, Inc., Fort Collins, CO1998: 1-10Google Scholar). They are classified as members of the reprolysin subfamily of metalloproteinases (6.Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar), which also includes ADAMs, proteins composed of adisintegrin and metalloproteinase domain, which function in various physiological processes such as fertilization, cytokine shedding, and neurogenesis (7.Primakoff P. Myles D.G. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 83-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). SVMPs and ADAMs present many similar structural features as evidenced by their sequence and domain homologies (8.Fox J.W. Long C. Bailey G.S. Enzymes from Snake Venom. Alaken, Inc., Fort Collins, CO1998: 151-178Google Scholar). The reprolysins share with matrix metalloproteinases a conserved overall topology, a zinc-binding consensus motif, and a strictly conserved methionine near their active sites. For these reasons, SVMPs, ADAMs, and matrix metalloproteinases have been classified together as the metzincins (6.Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 9.Stöcker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Reinemer P. Gomis-Ruth F.X. McKay D.B. Bode W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 823-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Some SVMPs induce local hemorrhage apparently as a primary consequence of the degradation of extracellular matrix proteins, although their exact mechanism of action is still unclear (10.Kamiguti A.S. Hay C.R. Theakston R.D. Zuzel M. Toxicon. 1996; 34: 627-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 11.Markland F.S.

SVMPs are organized into four classes (P-I to P-IV) according to their domain structure. The P-I class presents only the metalloproteinase domain. The P-II members have a disintegrin domain carboxyl-terminal to the proteinase domain. The P-III class has a disintegrin-like domain and a cysteine-rich domain following the proteinase domain. The P-IV class has, in addition to the previously described domains, a lectin-like domain carboxyl-terminal to the cysteine-rich domain. All classes share a homologous signal, latency, and metalloproteinase domain structure in their zymogen form (18.Hite L.A. Jia L.G. Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar,19.Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 345-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Less is known about the structural characteristics of the natural inhibitors of SVMPs isolated from the sera of resistant animals. Most of them are acidic glycoproteins with molecular masses varying from 52 to 90 kDa. They inhibit the enzymatic activity of hemorrhagic SVMPs through noncovalent complex formation, but are not effective against venom serine proteinases or non-venom proteolytic enzymes (20.Fox J.W. Bjarnason J. Bailèy G.S. Enzymes from Snake Venom. Alaken, Inc., Fort Collins, CO1998: 599-632Google Scholar, 21.Pérez J.C. Sánchez E.E. Toxicon. 1999; 37: 703-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The serum antihemorrhagins most thoroughly studied are as follows: 1) Habu serum factor from the Japanese Habu snake Trimeresurus flavoviridis (22.Yamakawa Y. Omori-Satoh T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and BJ46a from Bothrops jararaca (23.Valente R.H. Dragulev B. Perales J. Fox J.W. Domont G.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3042-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), members of the superfamily of cystatins; and 2) the inhibitors isolated from the North American opossum Didelphis virginiana (oprin) (24.Catanese J.J. Kress L.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and from the mongoose Herpestes edwardsii (antihemorrhagic factor 1–3) (25.Qi Z.Q. Yonaha K. Tomihara Y. Toyama S. Toxicon. 1994; 32: 1459-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26.Qi Z.Q. Yonaha K. Tomihara Y. Toyama S. Toxicon. 1995; 33: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), members of the immunoglobulin supergene family. Both Habu serum factor and BJ46a have had their complete amino acid structures determined: the former by Edman sequencing and the latter by cloning of its cDNA. However, no member of the immunoglobulin supergene family of natural inhibitors of SVMPs has been fully sequenced. Previously, we isolated an antihemorrhagic fraction (named the antibothropic factor) from the serum of the South American opossum Didelphis marsupialis. It showed antihemorrhagic, antilethal, antimyonecrotic, and antiedematogenic properties (27.Melo P.A. Suarez-Kurtz G. Toxicon. 1988; 26: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 28.Moussatché H. Perales J. Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz Rio J. 1989; 84: 391-394Crossref Google Scholar, 29.Perales J. Amorim C.Z.

Toxicon. 1994; 32: 1237-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and was active neither on snake venom serine proteinases nor on proteinases from other sources (31.Neves-Ferreira A.G.C. Perales J. Ovadia M. Moussatché H. Domont G.B. Toxicon. 1997; 35: 849-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recently, two antihemorrhagic proteins, DM40 and DM43, were isolated from the antibothropic factor and characterized as SVMP inhibitors from the immunoglobulin supergene family. It was shown that these acid glycoproteins form noncovalent complexes with jararhagin, the main hemorrhagic metalloproteinase from B. jararaca venom (32.Neves-Ferreira A.G.C. Cardinale N. Rocha S.L.G. Perales J. Domont G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1474: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this study, the complete amino acid sequence of DM43 and its disulfide bond pattern and homodimeric quaternary structure were determined. Functional analyses in addition to molecular modeling studies were performed to better understand how this inhibitor interacts with its target metalloproteinases. N-Isopropyliodoacetamide was from Molecular Probes, Inc. 4-Vinylpyridine was from Sigma. CNBr was from K&K Laboratories. Sequencing grade modified trypsin was from Promega; endoproteinase Asp-N was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany); and lysyl peptidase was from either Roche Molecular Biochemicals or Wako. All other chemicals were of analytical grade or higher quality. DM43 was isolated from D. marsupialis serum as previously described (32.Neves-Ferreira A.G.C. Cardinale N. Rocha S.L.G. Perales J. Domont G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1474: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Lyophilized B. jararaca venom was from the Army Biology Institute (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). Jararhagin was isolated from crude venom based on the procedure of Paine et al. (33.Paine M.J. Desmond H.P. Theakston R.D. Crampton J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22869-22876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that a Superdex 200 column (1.0 × 30 cm; Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated with 0.02 mTris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.02 m CaCl2 and 0.15 m NaCl was used in the first purification step. Using the same methodology as for jararhagin, we were also able to purify jararhagin C and bothrolysin. Lyophilized Crotalus atroxvenom was purchased from the Miami Serpentarium (Miami, FL). Atrolysins C and A were isolated from crude venom by previously described methods (34.Fox J.W. Bjarnason J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 368-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). DM43 was S-pyridylethylated and cleaved with CNBr as described (35.Allen G. Burdon R.H. van Knippenberg P.H. Sequencing of Proteins and Peptide. 2nd Ed. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1989: 95-99Google Scholar). The CNBr peptides were isolated by Tricine/SDS-PAGE (36.Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) and either digested in gel with trypsin as described below or transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and directly N-terminally sequenced. DM43 alkylated with N-isopropyliodoacetamide (37.Krutzsch H.C. Inman J.K. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was digested with lysyl peptidase (1 μg/μl in 20% glycerol and 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) without prior removal of alkylating reagents. To 200 pmol of N-isopropylcarboxyamidomethyl-DM43 was added 0.5 μl of enzyme solution, and this mixture was allowed to react at 37 °C for 18 h. The peptides obtained by lysyl peptidase digestion were isolated by RP-HPLC using either Zorbax (Agilent Technologies) or Jupiter (Phenomenex Inc.) C18 columns (2.1 × 150 mm) at 25 °C and at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The absorbance was monitored at 215 nm. The solvent system used was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O (solvent A) and 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B). The gradient program began with 10% solvent B for 5 min and was then ramped to 45% solvent B at 50 min and to 70% solvent B at 55 min. A sample of N-isopropylcarboxyamidomethyl-DM43 was divided in two aliquots. The first half was digested with Asp-N after diluting the urea solution used during the alkylation procedure to 1 mwith 0.05 m sodium phosphate (pH 8.0); the second half was desalted by RP-HPLC under the same conditions used for isolating the peptides obtained by lysyl peptidase digestion, dried by vacuum centrifugation, and dissolved in 0.05 m sodium phosphate (pH 8.0). Both aliquots were digested at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:200 (w/w) at 37 °C for 18 h. The peptides obtained by Asp-N digestion were purified by RP-HPLC as described above. CNBr peptides isolated by Tricine/SDS-PAGE were subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin (38.Shevchenko A. Wilm O. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar), and the tryptic peptides were isolated on a Vydac C18RP-HPLC column (1.0 × 150 mm; Separations Group) at 30 °C and at a flow rate of 0.05 ml/min. The absorbance was monitored at 215 nm. The solvent system used was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O (solvent A) and 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid in 70% acetonitrile (solvent B). The gradient program began with 15% solvent B for 10 min and was then ramped to 80% solvent B at 100 min. N-terminal Edman sequencing of N-isopropylcarboxyamidomethyl-DM43 and the digestion peptides isolated by RP-HPLC or by Tricine/SDS-PAGE was performed on an Applied Biosystems Procise 494 instrument according to the manufacturers' instructions. The complete DM43 amino acid sequence was used to scan the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank and the Swiss Protein and Protein Identification Resource Databases for homologous sequences with the BLAST program (39.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). A directed BLAST sequence search of the Protein Data Bank (40.Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27938) Google Scholar) was used to identify candidate parent structures for homology modeling. A final alignment of all sequences of interest was automatically derived by the program MULTALIGN (41.Barton G.J. Sternberg M.J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) and adjusted manually (see “Modeling Studies”). DM43 (57 μg, dry weight) was dissolved in 100 μl of 0.04 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 20% acetonitrile and digested overnight at 37 °C with 1 μg of lysyl peptidase. Peptides were separated on a Zorbax 300SB C18column (2.1 × 150 mm) at 32 °C and at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min, with detection at 215 nm. The solvent system was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O (solvent A) and 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B). The gradient program began with 20% solvent B for 5 min and was then ramped to 55% solvent B at 50 min and to 70% solvent B at 55 min. The molecular masses of the experimentally isolated peptides were determined by MALDI-TOF-MS on a Voyager DE-PRO mass spectrometer (Perseptive Biosystems) using 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix. Peptide masses were compared with theoretically possible disulfide-linked peptides and used as a guide to select peptides for Edman sequencing on the Procise 494 instrument. DM43 glycan moieties were analyzed after methanolysis, followed by re-N-acetylation of amino sugars and trimethylsilylation of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups. The volatile trimethylsilyl derivatives were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy on a Shimadzu gas chromatograph using a DB-1 capillary column (0.25 mm × 30 m), and the compounds were further characterized by electron impact mass spectroscopy (42.Previato J.O. Gorin P.A.J. Mazurek M. Xavier M.T. Fournet B. Wieruszesk J.M. Mendonça-Previato L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2518-2526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the molecular mass of the DM43 protein moiety, a sample of DM43 chemically deglycosylated by anhydrous trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (32.Neves-Ferreira A.G.C. Cardinale N. Rocha S.L.G. Perales J. Domont G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1474: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS as previously described. The molecular mass of DM43 was determined by size exclusion chromatography under different conditions: 1) a Superdex 200 fast protein liquid chromatography column equilibrated with 0.02 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.02m CaCl2 and 0.15 m NaCl; 2) the same column equilibrated with 0.05 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 0.15 m NaCl and 6 m guanidine HCl; and 3) a Protein-Pak 300 SW HPLC column (0.78 × 30 cm; Waters) eluted with 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), made 0.15 m with NaCl, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Size exclusion standards (Amersham Biosciences) were bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa). Di-bovine serum albumin (134 kDa) present in the bovine serum albumin standard was also used as a marker. Native DM43 molecular mass was also determined by dynamic laser light scattering at 20 °C using a DynaPro molecular sizing instrument (Protein Solutions, High Wicombe, United Kingdom). DM43 was dissolved in 0.05 msodium phosphate (pH 8.0) at 2 mg/ml and filtered through a 0.02-μm membrane. Approximately 25 individual Stokes radius values were acquired for each sample and statistically averaged. Based on this averaged value and assuming a globular conformation, the molecular mass was calculated using the software provided with the instrument. The requirement of divalent ions for DM43 dimerization was assessed after its incubation with 10 mm EDTA in 0.02 mTris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl for 1 or 20 h at 37 °C and analysis of the protein by size exclusion chromatography on Superdex 200 as described above. DM43 inhibitory ability was tested against different SVMPs from the venoms of B. jararaca(bothrolysin, P-I, EC 3.4.24.50; and jararhagin, P-III, EC 3.4.24.73) and C. atrox (atrolysin C, P-I, EC 3.4.24.42; and atrolysin A, P-III, EC 3.4.24.1). To evaluate the inhibition of SVMP activity by DM43, each enzyme (0.5 μg) was incubated with fibrinogen (enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:20 (w/w)) for 10 min in either the absence or presence of DM43 at a 1:1 molar ratio. Atrolysin A (1 μg) was incubated for 6 h. The fibrinogenolytic activity of the samples was analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. EDTA (10 mm) was used in the incubation mixture as a control of total SVMP inhibition (32.Neves-Ferreira A.G.C. Cardinale N. Rocha S.L.G. Perales J. Domont G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1474: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For complex formation analysis, equimolar amounts of DM43 and each SVMP were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in 0.02 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.02 mCaCl2 and 0.15 m NaCl. In one set of experiments, equimolar amounts of jararhagin and DM43 were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 10 mmEDTA in 0.02 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.15m NaCl. Samples were chromatographed at 0.5 ml/min on a Superdex 200 column equilibrated with the incubation buffer. The various eluted fractions were collected, precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid (final concentration), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under (non)reducing conditions. Jararhagin C, a disintegrin-like/cysteine-rich domain protein resulting from proteolytic processing of jararhagin from B. jararaca venom (43.Usami Y. Fujimura Y. Miura S. Shima H. Yoshida E. Yoshioka A. Hirano K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), was also tested for complex formation with DM43 using the above conditions. To check for dissociation, the DM43-jararhagin complex was isolated by Superdex 200 as described above, incubated with a 2-fold molar excess of bovine fibrinogen for 5 min at 37 °C, and reinjected onto the Superdex column. Finally, to evaluate whether DM43 forms a complex with jararhagin under “physiological conditions” (in the venom), crude B. jararaca venom and DM43 were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline at a 10:1 (w/w) ratio for 15 min at 37 °C and then analyzed by native PAGE (31.Neves-Ferreira A.G.C. Perales J. Ovadia M. Moussatché H. Domont G.B. Toxicon. 1997; 35: 849-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Proteins were either stained with Coomassie Blue or immunoblotted using anti-DM43 polyclonal antibodies as described by Neves-Ferreira et al. (31.Neves-Ferreira A.G.C. Perales J. Ovadia M. Moussatché H. Domont G.B. Toxicon. 1997; 35: 849-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A fixed amount of jararhagin was incubated with DM43 at different molar ratios (jararhagin/DM43 at 1:0.4 to 1:4.8). Protein contents were determined using molar coefficients at 280 nm for DM43 (60,305m−1 cm−1) and jararhagin (54,385m−1 cm−1) determined as described (44.Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar). Each sample was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography on Superdex 200 in Tris-HCl buffer as described previously. Jararhagin and DM43 controls were individually submitted to the same experimental procedure. The samples were collected, precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid (final concentration), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The molecular mass of the DM43-jararhagin complex was calculated by size exclusion chromatography as well as by dynamic laser light scattering as already described for DM43 alone. A specific BLAST sequence search of the Protein Data Bank (40.Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27938) Google Scholar) using default parameters was used to identify candidate parent structures for homology modeling. The first of the Ig-like domains of DM43, here denominated D0, was built on the D2 domain of the natural killer cell inhibitory receptor KIR2DL1 (Protein Data Bank code 1nkr) (45.Fan Q.R. Mosyak L. Winter C.C. Wagtmann N. Long E.O. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1997; 389: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), whereas the second and third domains (D1 and D2) were built concomitantly on the corresponding domains of the same parent structure (see Fig. 2). Models were constructed with the automated homology modeling program MODELLER 4 (46.Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar). The initial input alignment was automatically derived from the program MULTALIGN of the AMPS suite (41.Barton G.J. Sternberg M.J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) using the PAM250 matrix and a gap penalty of 8 prior to manual adjustment. The low sequence identity between the DM43 Ig domains and those of KIR2DL1 led to ambiguities in the alignment, requiring the construction of several alternative models (over 200 in total) in which slight modifications to the alignment were made. Typically, 10 models were built for each alignment using a protocol that involved coordinate copying for atoms in common with code 1nkr and using internal coordinates from the CHARM topology library (47.Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (14019) Google Scholar) for the remainder. A 4-Å coordinate randomization was applied to each structure prior to optimization using up to 300 cycles of the variable target function method employing conjugate gradients. Refinement was subsequently performed in Cartesian space using the standard full molecular dynamics algorithm with simulated annealing as implemented in MODELLER 4. Distance restraints were applied up to 14 Å in the case of C-α–C-α distances and 11 Å for N–O distances. Additional restraints were applied to the hydrogen bonds involving the O-γ atoms of the serines of the WS XWS box and to fix the C and C′ strands of the I-type Ig fold. The deviation permitted for the proline φ angle was also further restricted to avoid disallowed regions of Ramachandran space. The quality of the models generated was evaluated by reference to the MODELLER pseudo-energy term as well as by use of the structure verification programs PROCHECK (48.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and VERIFY_3D (49.Luthy R. Bowie J.U. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2616) Google Scholar) and the QUALITY option (50.Vriend G. Sander C. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 6: 47-60Crossref Scopus (290) Google Scholar) of WHATIF (51.Vriend G. J. Mol. Graphics. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar). Potential interface regions on the surface of the models were analyzed with the program PATCHES (52.Jones S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) using default parameters for dimeric contacts. The strategy used to elucidate the primary structure of DM43 was the N-terminal sequencing of the intact protein and the determination of the amino acid sequences of a set of peptides generated by cleavage at peptide bonds adjacent to methionine, lysine, aspartic acid or arginine, and lysine. A summary of the DM43 complete amino acid sequence is shown in Fig. 1, along with all peptides and overlaps necessary for the proof of the sequence. This SVMP inhibitor was found to be composed of 291 amino acid residues. Cycles corresponding to positions 23, 156, 160, and 175 produced no detectable phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives and could be identified as the first position of N-glycosylation consensus sequences. Analysis of the DM43 glycan part indicated the presence of N-acetylglucosamine, mannose, galactose, and sialic acid at 4:3:2:2 molar ratios. After chemical deglycosylation, the molecular mass of the DM43 protein moiety, as determined by MALDI-TOF-MS, was 33,651.6 Da (Table I). Compared with the previously determined mean molecular mass for native DM43 (42,691 Da) (32.Neves-Ferreira A.G.C. Cardinale N. Rocha S.L.G. Perales J. Domont G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1474: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), one can assume a molecular mass of 9039 Da for its glycan moiety, which represents 21% of the total molecular mass of DM43. The disulfide bond pattern of DM43 was determined using a combination of MALDI-TOF-MS and Edman sequencing of peptides isolated by RP-HPLC after lysyl peptidase digestion. The second bridge (Cys121–Cys163) was clearly established after parallel sequencing the disulfide-linked peptides119LHXRGMLLGMIFDLYQEGEQEP140and143SSQTPSAEATFIV XSTG XYSXLYRAPASAPSV174.

The initial events of odor detection occur in ORNs, making their survival vital to the survival of the animal (4.Buck L.B. Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 517-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Interspersed among olfactory epithelium is respiratory epithelium, consisting of columnar epithelial cells and underlying basal cells. Any contribution of respiratory epithelium in regulating or responding to olfactory epithelial injury/physiological changes is unknown.ORN axons project to the olfactory bulb (OB), which is their target. ORNs depend on the OB for their survival, and injury to the OB causes ORNs to degenerate, resulting in compromise of the olfactory epithelium (5.Constanzo R.M. Graziadei P.P.C. J. Comp. Neurol. 1983; 215: 370-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The degeneration of ORNs is followed by an increase in proliferation and maturation of basal cells to repopulate the olfactory epithelium. The OB can be lesioned experimentally, termed bulbectomy. Bulbectomy results in the hyper-induction of neurogenesis in the olfactory epithelium ipsilateral to the side of the lesion (6.Graziadei P.P.C. Kaplan M.S. Monti-Graziadei G.A. Brain Res. 1980; 186: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 7.Graziadei P.P.C. Monti-Graziadei G.A. J.

These cellular changes in the damaged olfactory epithelium are accompanied by the changes in expression for many molecules that participate in olfactory neurogenesis (5.Constanzo R.M. Graziadei P.P.C. J. Comp. Neurol. 1983; 215: 370-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 10.Lim J.H. Brunjes P.C. J.

These molecules may include neurotrophins, cytokines, growth factors, and, potentially, factors that serve a protective role during compromise of the olfactory epithelium.Subtraction suppression hybridization (SSH) (13.Diatchenko L. Lau Y.F. Campbell A.P. Chenchik A. Moqadam F. Huang B. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K. Gurskaya N. Sverdlov E.D. Siebert P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6025-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar), like representational difference analysis (14.Lisitsyn N. Wigler M. Science. 1993; 259: 946-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar) and differential display (15.Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4687) Google Scholar), is a PCR-based subtractive cDNA hybridization method used to identify and isolate cDNAs of differentially expressed genes. The method is based on suppression PCR and combines normalization and subtraction in a single procedure. The normalization step equalizes the abundance of cDNAs within the target population, and the subtraction step excludes common sequences between the target and driver populations (13.Diatchenko L. Lau Y.F. Campbell A.P. Chenchik A. Moqadam F. Huang B. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K. Gurskaya N. Sverdlov E.D. Siebert P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6025-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). The high level of enrichment, low background, and normalized abundance of cDNA in the subtracted mixture make this method ideal for rapid cloning of cDNAs from differentially expressed genes. By combining SSH with high throughput differential screening, 625 differentially expressed cDNAs from metastatic adenocarcinoma cell lines have been isolated with a true positive rate of 94%, when subtracted from its non-metastatic counterpart (16.von Stein O.D. Thies W.G. Hofmann M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2598-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar).Using similar approaches in this study, clones of differentially expressed gene fragments were isolated in the adult rat nasal epithelium after olfactory bulbectomy. We used this method to identify a number of differentially expressed genes and have characterized one of these clones in detail. A full-length clone was obtained from a rat olfactory cDNA library. This gene is highly homologous to a recently identified mouse gene, plunc (palate,lung, and nasal epithelium clone). Here, we provide data to indicate that Plunc is a secreted protein and generate insight into one or more of the potential functions of Plunc by investigating its differential expression in our olfactory epithelium damage model as well as sequence analysis.DISCUSSIONHere, we report the molecular cloning, expression profile study, and sequence analysis of a rat plunc. Rat pluncis highly homologous to mouse and human plunc, whose functions are still unclear. Based on the observation that Plunc is present in the nasal mucus and that its electrophoretic mobility in PAGE is higher than the estimated molecular weight, Plunc appears to be a secreted protein with post-translational modification. Rat Plunc was up-regulated in respiratory epithelium ipsilateral to the side of olfactory bulbectomy by both in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. In addition, Plunc appeared to “coat” the surface of the olfactory epithelium ipsilateral to the lesioned side. Because in situ hybridization analyses showed up-regulation after bulbectomy only in the respiratory epithelium, Plunc may be expressed and secreted from the respiratory epithelium and migrate into the olfactory epithelium.One of our goals was to identify candidate genes involved in the olfactory neurogenesis by isolating genes expressed olfactory epithelium that were up-regulated following bulbectomy. In all clones identified by SSH that had follow-up by Northern blot analysis, it appeared that our screening method indeed identified genes that were up-regulated following bulbectomy. The plunc fragment was chosen to investigate further. Unexpectedly, plunc was expressed in respiratory epithelium, not in olfactory epithelium. It is unlikely that Plunc is a stimulatory factor for neurogenesis in olfactory neuroepithelium, because bPlunc is expressed exclusively in the respiratory epithelium and localized in the apical layer of the respiratory epithelium. One might suspect that Plunc would have difficulty coming in contact with olfactory stem/precursor cells located in basal layer of olfactory epithelium, although Plunc proteins are present in the ciliary layer of the olfactory epithelium after bulbectomy. Instead, plunc may be the target gene of cytokines or growth factors that are up-regulated upon olfactory bulbectomy to serve another function in response to injury. This is the first report of a protein expressed in respiratory epithelial cells whose expression is altered by injury to the olfactory epithelium or olfactory bulb.Based on our data, Plunc is up-regulated after injury to the olfactory epithelium. It is not clear how Plunc is up-regulated in the respiratory epithelium after removal of olfactory bulb, which is the target for ORNs resident in olfactory epithelium. Our result implies that there may be some kind of communication between olfactory and respiratory epithelia. This communication might be caused by local fluctuation of cytokines, growth factors, or other factors after bulbectomy. Our results also demonstrate that Plunc is expressed in epithelial cells in segmental bronchi and in heart. By analogy to the olfactory system, Plunc may function in response to injury or insult in the respiratory epithelium. It is more difficult to hypothesize about the function of Plunc expression in heart. However, it would be very interesting to examine Plunc expression after injury to the heart and lung.The NCI-H647 adeno-squamous carcinoma cell line and the PG-3 adenocarcinoma cell line are known to express Plunc (19.Bingle C.D. Bingle L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 27.Iwao K. Watanabe T. Fujiwara Y. Takami K. Kodama K. Higashiyama M. Yokouchi H. Ozaki K. Monden M. Tanigami A. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 91: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that Plunc expression in NCI-H647 is reduced by interferon γ, implying that Plunc is regulated either directly or indirectly by this cytokine. Examination of the 5′ regulatory region of plunc to determine whether there is any cytokine-responding element would be interesting. In the mouse 5′ regulatory region, there are, in fact, seven potential binding sites for STATs, 2C. Moon, J.-Y. Yoo, and G. V. Ronnett, unpublished observations. which are known to regulate expression by various cytokines, including interferon γ (28.Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev.

Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar).By using peptide antibody to Plunc, we demonstrated that Plunc is secreted in the nasal mucus of rat and human. This finding, together with a conserved domain data base search that showed that Plunc has a bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPI) domain, suggest that Plunc might have secretory/antimicrobial functions. BPI is a cationic protein displaying a pivotal role in host defense against Gram-negative bacteria (31.Elsbach P. Weiss J. Immunobiology. 1993; 187: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 32.Elsbach P. Weiss J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The spleen is known to be a critical organ to clear a Gram-negative bacteremia (33.Scher K.S. Wroczynski F. Coil Jr., J.A. J. Trauma. 1982; 22: 407-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and asplenia can cause sudden death of children as a result of infections of the respiratory systems (9.Kanthan R. Moyana T. Nyssen J. Am. J. Forensic Med. Pathol. 1999; 20: 57-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Interestingly, plunc message is expressed in the upper airways and Plunc protein (but not message) is abundant in rat spleen. These findings suggest that plunc may be a host defense molecule against inhaled Gram-negative bacterial infection.Very recently, human Plunc (also called Lunx) was proposed as a marker of micrometastasis in non-small cell lung cancer (27.Iwao K. Watanabe T. Fujiwara Y. Takami K. Kodama K. Higashiyama M. Yokouchi H. Ozaki K. Monden M. Tanigami A. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 91: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Lunx has been identified by two independent groups (19.Bingle C.D. Bingle L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 27.Iwao K. Watanabe T. Fujiwara Y.

It is expressed around the developing palate and thymus, in nasal septum and nasal conchae, as well as in the trachea and main stem bronchi (18.Weston W.M. LeClair E.E. Trzyna W. McHugh K.M.

Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Lunx is found in all the lung carcinoma cell line, and it is differentially expressed in lymph nodes of cancer patients (27.Iwao K. Watanabe T. Fujiwara Y. Takami K. Kodama K. Higashiyama M. Yokouchi H. Ozaki K. Monden M. Tanigami A. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 91: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Although Lunx was proposed as a marker of micrometastasis in non-small cell lung carcinoma (27.Iwao K. Watanabe T. Fujiwara Y. Takami K. Kodama K. Higashiyama M. Yokouchi H. Ozaki K. Monden M. Tanigami A. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 91: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the nature and function of Plunc are largely unknown. Therefore, it would also be worth determining if there is a neuroproliferative and/or survival role of Plunc.There is a discrepancy between a previous report describing the expression patterns of mouse/human plunc (18.Weston W.M. LeClair E.E. Trzyna W. McHugh K.M. Nugent P. Lafferty C.M. Ma L. Tuan R.S. Greene R.M. J. Biol.

Acta. 2000; 1493: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and our rat plunc Northern result. Others did not detect mouse plunc expression in heart, but, in our study, rat plunc was highly expressed in heart by both Northern and Western analyses. Mouse plunc UniGene has a few ESTs derived from heart, so a possible explanation is that, in mouse, pluncexpression in the heart may not be as high as that in rat.Thus, Plunc may protect against infection in epithelial tissues post-injury. Variations in the level of Plunc expression could well be correlated with differences in susceptibility to infections. There is precedent for this hypothesis. The relative abundance of a salivary protein, bSP30, is correlated with susceptibility to bloat in cattle herds (21.Rajan G.H. Morris C.A. Carruthers V.R. Wilkins R.J. Wheeler T.T. Anim. Genet. 1996; 27: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A similar situation might exist for Plunc and respiratory infections. Alternatively, Plunc may also play a role in the etiology of bloat. The specific tissue expression pattern of Plunc provides invaluable tools to researchers interested in these tissues. The olfactory epithelium, situated within the nasal cavity, is composed of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs),1 sustentacular supporting cells, and a mixed population of basal cells, some of which serve as ORN stem/progenitor cells for the generation of new olfactory sensory neurons throughout life (1.Graziadei P.P.C.

The degeneration of ORNs is followed by an increase in proliferation and maturation of basal cells to repopulate the olfactory epithelium. The OB can be lesioned experimentally, termed bulbectomy. Bulbectomy results in the hyper-induction of neurogenesis in the olfactory epithelium ipsilateral to the side of the lesion (6.Graziadei P.P.C. Kaplan M.S. Monti-Graziadei G.A. Brain Res. 1980; 186: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 7.Graziadei P.P.C. Monti-Graziadei G.A. J.

These cellular changes in the damaged olfactory epithelium are accompanied by the changes in expression for many molecules that participate in olfactory neurogenesis (5.Constanzo R.M. Graziadei P.P.C. J. Comp. Neurol. 1983; 215: 370-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 10.Lim J.H. Brunjes P.C. J.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1294-1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These molecules may include neurotrophins, cytokines, growth factors, and, potentially, factors that serve a protective role during compromise of the olfactory epithelium. Subtraction suppression hybridization (SSH) (13.Diatchenko L. Lau Y.F. Campbell A.P. Chenchik A. Moqadam F. Huang B. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K. Gurskaya N. Sverdlov E.D. Siebert P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6025-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar), like representational difference analysis (14.Lisitsyn N. Wigler M. Science. 1993; 259: 946-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar) and differential display (15.Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4687) Google Scholar), is a PCR-based subtractive cDNA hybridization method used to identify and isolate cDNAs of differentially expressed genes. The method is based on suppression PCR and combines normalization and subtraction in a single procedure. The normalization step equalizes the abundance of cDNAs within the target population, and the subtraction step excludes common sequences between the target and driver populations (13.Diatchenko L. Lau Y.F. Campbell A.P. Chenchik A. Moqadam F. Huang B. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K. Gurskaya N. Sverdlov E.D. Siebert P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6025-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). The high level of enrichment, low background, and normalized abundance of cDNA in the subtracted mixture make this method ideal for rapid cloning of cDNAs from differentially expressed genes. By combining SSH with high throughput differential screening, 625 differentially expressed cDNAs from metastatic adenocarcinoma cell lines have been isolated with a true positive rate of 94%, when subtracted from its non-metastatic counterpart (16.von Stein O.D. Thies W.G. Hofmann M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2598-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Using similar approaches in this study, clones of differentially expressed gene fragments were isolated in the adult rat nasal epithelium after olfactory bulbectomy. We used this method to identify a number of differentially expressed genes and have characterized one of these clones in detail. A full-length clone was obtained from a rat olfactory cDNA library. This gene is highly homologous to a recently identified mouse gene, plunc (palate,lung, and nasal epithelium clone). Here, we provide data to indicate that Plunc is a secreted protein and generate insight into one or more of the potential functions of Plunc by investigating its differential expression in our olfactory epithelium damage model as well as sequence analysis. DISCUSSIONHere, we report the molecular cloning, expression profile study, and sequence analysis of a rat plunc. Rat pluncis highly homologous to mouse and human plunc, whose functions are still unclear. Based on the observation that Plunc is present in the nasal mucus and that its electrophoretic mobility in PAGE is higher than the estimated molecular weight, Plunc appears to be a secreted protein with post-translational modification. Rat Plunc was up-regulated in respiratory epithelium ipsilateral to the side of olfactory bulbectomy by both in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. In addition, Plunc appeared to “coat” the surface of the olfactory epithelium ipsilateral to the lesioned side. Because in situ hybridization analyses showed up-regulation after bulbectomy only in the respiratory epithelium, Plunc may be expressed and secreted from the respiratory epithelium and migrate into the olfactory epithelium.One of our goals was to identify candidate genes involved in the olfactory neurogenesis by isolating genes expressed olfactory epithelium that were up-regulated following bulbectomy. In all clones identified by SSH that had follow-up by Northern blot analysis, it appeared that our screening method indeed identified genes that were up-regulated following bulbectomy. The plunc fragment was chosen to investigate further. Unexpectedly, plunc was expressed in respiratory epithelium, not in olfactory epithelium. It is unlikely that Plunc is a stimulatory factor for neurogenesis in olfactory neuroepithelium, because bPlunc is expressed exclusively in the respiratory epithelium and localized in the apical layer of the respiratory epithelium. One might suspect that Plunc would have difficulty coming in contact with olfactory stem/precursor cells located in basal layer of olfactory epithelium, although Plunc proteins are present in the ciliary layer of the olfactory epithelium after bulbectomy. Instead, plunc may be the target gene of cytokines or growth factors that are up-regulated upon olfactory bulbectomy to serve another function in response to injury. This is the first report of a protein expressed in respiratory epithelial cells whose expression is altered by injury to the olfactory epithelium or olfactory bulb.Based on our data, Plunc is up-regulated after injury to the olfactory epithelium. It is not clear how Plunc is up-regulated in the respiratory epithelium after removal of olfactory bulb, which is the target for ORNs resident in olfactory epithelium. Our result implies that there may be some kind of communication between olfactory and respiratory epithelia. This communication might be caused by local fluctuation of cytokines, growth factors, or other factors after bulbectomy. Our results also demonstrate that Plunc is expressed in epithelial cells in segmental bronchi and in heart. By analogy to the olfactory system, Plunc may function in response to injury or insult in the respiratory epithelium. It is more difficult to hypothesize about the function of Plunc expression in heart. However, it would be very interesting to examine Plunc expression after injury to the heart and lung.The NCI-H647 adeno-squamous carcinoma cell line and the PG-3 adenocarcinoma cell line are known to express Plunc (19.Bingle C.D. Bingle L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 27.Iwao K. Watanabe T. Fujiwara Y. Takami K. Kodama K. Higashiyama M. Yokouchi H. Ozaki K. Monden M. Tanigami A. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 91: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that Plunc expression in NCI-H647 is reduced by interferon γ, implying that Plunc is regulated either directly or indirectly by this cytokine. Examination of the 5′ regulatory region of plunc to determine whether there is any cytokine-responding element would be interesting. In the mouse 5′ regulatory region, there are, in fact, seven potential binding sites for STATs, 2C. Moon, J.-Y. Yoo, and G. V. Ronnett, unpublished observations. which are known to regulate expression by various cytokines, including interferon γ (28.Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev.

Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar).By using peptide antibody to Plunc, we demonstrated that Plunc is secreted in the nasal mucus of rat and human. This finding, together with a conserved domain data base search that showed that Plunc has a bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPI) domain, suggest that Plunc might have secretory/antimicrobial functions. BPI is a cationic protein displaying a pivotal role in host defense against Gram-negative bacteria (31.Elsbach P. Weiss J. Immunobiology. 1993; 187: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 32.Elsbach P. Weiss J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The spleen is known to be a critical organ to clear a Gram-negative bacteremia (33.Scher K.S. Wroczynski F. Coil Jr., J.A. J. Trauma. 1982; 22: 407-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and asplenia can cause sudden death of children as a result of infections of the respiratory systems (9.Kanthan R. Moyana T. Nyssen J. Am. J. Forensic Med. Pathol. 1999; 20: 57-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Interestingly, plunc message is expressed in the upper airways and Plunc protein (but not message) is abundant in rat spleen. These findings suggest that plunc may be a host defense molecule against inhaled Gram-negative bacterial infection.Very recently, human Plunc (also called Lunx) was proposed as a marker of micrometastasis in non-small cell lung cancer (27.Iwao K. Watanabe T. Fujiwara Y. Takami K. Kodama K. Higashiyama M. Yokouchi H. Ozaki K. Monden M. Tanigami A. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 91: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Lunx has been identified by two independent groups (19.Bingle C.D. Bingle L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 27.Iwao K. Watanabe T. Fujiwara Y.

It is expressed around the developing palate and thymus, in nasal septum and nasal conchae, as well as in the trachea and main stem bronchi (18.Weston W.M. LeClair E.E. Trzyna W. McHugh K.M.

Lunx is found in all the lung carcinoma cell line, and it is differentially expressed in lymph nodes of cancer patients (27.Iwao K. Watanabe T. Fujiwara Y. Takami K. Kodama K. Higashiyama M. Yokouchi H. Ozaki K. Monden M. Tanigami A. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 91: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Although Lunx was proposed as a marker of micrometastasis in non-small cell lung carcinoma (27.Iwao K. Watanabe T. Fujiwara Y. Takami K. Kodama K. Higashiyama M. Yokouchi H. Ozaki K. Monden M. Tanigami A. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 91: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the nature and function of Plunc are largely unknown. Therefore, it would also be worth determining if there is a neuroproliferative and/or survival role of Plunc.There is a discrepancy between a previous report describing the expression patterns of mouse/human plunc (18.Weston W.M. LeClair E.E. Trzyna W. McHugh K.M. Nugent P. Lafferty C.M. Ma L. Tuan R.S. Greene R.M. J. Biol.

Others did not detect mouse plunc expression in heart, but, in our study, rat plunc was highly expressed in heart by both Northern and Western analyses. Mouse plunc UniGene has a few ESTs derived from heart, so a possible explanation is that, in mouse, pluncexpression in the heart may not be as high as that in rat.Thus, Plunc may protect against infection in epithelial tissues post-injury. Variations in the level of Plunc expression could well be correlated with differences in susceptibility to infections. There is precedent for this hypothesis. The relative abundance of a salivary protein, bSP30, is correlated with susceptibility to bloat in cattle herds (21.Rajan G.H. Morris C.A. Carruthers V.R. Wilkins R.J. Wheeler T.T. Anim. Genet. 1996; 27: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A similar situation might exist for Plunc and respiratory infections. Alternatively, Plunc may also play a role in the etiology of bloat. The specific tissue expression pattern of Plunc provides invaluable tools to researchers interested in these tissues.

The N terminus possesses a Rho GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity, whereas the C terminus comprises an ADP-ribosyltransferase domain. We investigated whether the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of ExoS influences its GAP activity. Although the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of ExoS is dependent upon FAS, a 14-3-3 family protein, factor-activating ExoS (FAS) had no influence on the activity of the GAP domain of ExoS (ExoS-GAP). In the presence of NAD and FAS, the GAP activity of full-length ExoS was reduced about 10-fold, whereas NAD and FAS did not affect the activity of the ExoS-GAP fragment. Using [32P]NAD, ExoS-GAP was identified as a substrate of the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of ExoS. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that auto-ADP-ribosylation of Arg-146 of ExoS was crucial for inhibition of GAP activity in vitro. To reveal the auto-ADP-ribosylation of ExoS in intact cells, tetanolysin was used to produce pores in the plasma membrane of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells to allow the intracellular entry of [32P]NAD, the substrate for ADP-ribosylation. After a 3-h infection of CHO cells with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteins of 50 and 25 kDa were preferentially ADP-ribosylated.

The C terminus of ExoS is a 14-3-3-dependent ADP-ribosyltransferase (8.Knight D.A. Finck-Barbancon V. Kulich S.M. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3182-3186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection of the C terminus into cultured cells results in cell death (9.Pederson K.J. Barbieri J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although cell death requires expression of ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, the mechanism responsible for eliciting cytotoxicity has not been established. In vitro, ExoS ADP-ribosylates numerous proteins (10.Coburn J. Wyatt R.T. Iglewski B.H. Gill D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9004-9008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including members of the Ras subfamily of monomeric GTPases. ExoS ADP-ribosylates multiple arginine residues in Ras and Rap, with Arg-41 the preferred site of ADP-ribosylation (11.Ganesan A.K. Frank D.W. Misra R.P. Schmidt G. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7332-7337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). ADP-ribosylation of Arg-41 inhibits binding of Ras GTPases to their specific guanine nucleotide-exchange factor (4.Ganesan A.K. Vincent T.S. Olson J.C. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21823-21829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Here we report that ExoS is auto-ADP-ribosylated in vitro, resulting in a reduction of its GAP activity. Utilizing tetanolysin as a pore-forming toxin to allow the intracellular entry of [32P]NAD, ExoS was observed to ADP-ribosylate various eukaryotic substrates, including Ras. Moreover, ExoS was auto-ADP-ribosylated in CHO cells, suggesting an intramolecular regulation of the functions of ExoS in intact cells. The following reagents were purchased: nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Agarose (Qiagen), glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), tetanolysin and Clostridium botulinum Exoenzyme C3 (List Biologicals), [32P]NAD (ICN), His-probe and a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), mouse α-HRas antibody (Transduction Laboratories), rat α-pan Ras antibody Y13-259 (Sigma), mouse α-GFP antibody (BAbCO), and rabbit α-HA antibody (Covance). P. aeruginosa PA103 ΔexoU, exoT::Tc(pUCP), which does not express the four known type III effectors (ExoS, ExoT, ExoU, ExoY), and P. aeruginosa PA103ΔexoU, exoT::Tc(pUCPExoS), which expresses only ExoS, were obtained from Dara Frank. Human α-ExoS antiserum has been described previously (12.Moss J. Ehrmantraut M.E. Banwart B.D. Frank D.W. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1185-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cell culture reagents were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Recombinant proteins were produced in Escherichia coli BL21 cells and purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography (ExoS fl, ExoS-transferase, and FAS (Haian Fu, Emory University) or affinity chromatography with glutathione-Sepharose (ExoS-GAP). Overnight cultures were diluted 1:10 with fresh LB medium. After 2 h at 30 °C, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.2 mm, final concentration) was added. After an additional 2-h incubation, cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in lysis-buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1% Triton X-100). His-tagged ExoS was extracted from the lysate with 1 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Agarose, which was washed three times in 10% glycerol in PBS, pH 6.0. Proteins were eluted from the resin in 0.5 mimidazole, 10% glycerol in PBS, pH 6.0, and stored at −20 °C. GST-ExoS was purified from the lysate by incubation with 1 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. Beads were washed twice in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 and 150 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5 at 4 °C before ExoS was released by thrombin cleavage (200 μg/ml thrombin, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm triethanolamine/HCl, pH 7.5, and 2.5 mmCaCl2, for 45 min at room temperature). Thrombin was removed by incubation with benzamidine-Sepharose, and the protein was stored in aliquots at −20 °C. Recombinant ExoS was cloned into pUCP and expressed in P. aeruginosa PA103. Recombinant ExoS was purified by gel filtration followed by ion exchange chromatography as previously described (13.Riese M.J. Wittinghofer A. Barbieri J.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3289-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Recombinant Rho proteins (2 μm, final concentration) were loaded with [γ-32P]GTP for 5 min at 37 °C in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol. MgCl2 (12 mm, final concentration) and unlabeled GTP (2 mm, final concentration) were added alone to stimulate intrinsic GTPase activity or with ExoS-GAP at 37 °C. GTPase hydrolysis was determined by a filter-binding assay. Ras (2 μm) or ExoS-GAP (2 μm) was incubated for 30 min at 29 °C with the indicated concentrations of ExoS-transferase (ExoS full-length (2 μm) was incubated without isolated transferase domain) in a reaction mix containing 0.2m sodium acetate (pH 6.0), 2 mmMgCl2, 100 μm [32P]NAD (specific activity of 25 μCi per 1.25 nmol of NAD) and 1 μm FAS. Reactions were stopped with gel-loading buffer and boiling. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. For microinjection, EBL cells were seeded subconfluently onto glass coverslips (CELLocate, Eppendorf) and cultivated for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in humidified CO2 at 37 °C. Purified ExoS1-234 was incubated for 30 min at 29 °C with the transferase domain (Exo-GAP: transferase domain = 10:1) or with buffer in the presence of NAD (1 mm) and FAS (1 μm). ADP-ribosylated and unmodified ExoS-GAP (both 800 ng/μl, in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)) was microinjected into EBL cells with an Eppendorf 5242 microinjector. As negative control ExoSR146K (mutant with no GAP activity, 800 ng/μl, in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)) was injected. Photographs were taken 90 min after injection. CHO cells were grown under 5% CO2 in F12 media supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum, 0.1% NaHCO3, and 2500 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. DNA was purified with Qiagen Midi-Kits. CHO cells were co-transfected with the indicated derivatives of pEGFP-N1, using LipofectAMINE and LipoPLUS (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. Transfection efficiency varied from 30% to 50% as determined by fluorescence of the reporter, EGFP. CHO cells were infected at an multiplicity of infection of 8:1 (bacteria:CHO cells). P. aeruginosa were quantified from the absorbance calculation 1 A540 = 4 × 108 bacteria. At confluent growth, the CHO cell number was 4 × 106 cells in 85-mm dishes and 2 × 105 cells/well in a 12-well plate. In 85-mm dishes, cells were washed with 12 ml of PBS and incubated with 6 ml of serum-free F12 medium, containing 0.1% NaHCO3. P. aeruginosa PA103 ΔexoU, exoT::Tc(pUCP) or P. aeruginosa PA103 ΔexoU, exoT::Tc (pUCP-ExoS) was added to CHO cells followed by incubation under 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 2, 3, or 4 h. Medium was removed, and CHO cells were washed with 10 ml of PBS before treatment with tetanolysin, as described in the next section. In 12-well plates, CHO cells were treated in the same way except that cells were washed with 1 ml of PBS and incubated in 0.7 ml of serum-free medium during infection. P. aeruginosa-infected CHO cells were permeabilized with tetanolysin (List Biologicals, CA) by a procedure adapted from Ahnert-Hilger et al. (14.Ahnert-Hilger G. Wegenhorst U. Stecher B. Spicher K. Rosenthal W. Gratz M. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Confluent CHO cells (85-mm dishes) were washed with 10 ml of PBS and incubated in 6 ml of ice-cold HGI buffer (20 mm PIPES, 2 mmNaATP, 4.8 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, 150 mm potassium glutamate, 2 mm EGTA, and KOH to obtain pH 7.0) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. Cells were incubated for 10 min at 4 °C, without or with 2.4 μg of tetanolysin, and washed with ice-cold HGI buffer, before 6 ml of HGI buffer containing 20 nm [32P]NAD (6 μCi) was added. After 25 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2, CHO cells were harvested in 0.5 ml of HB2 buffer (250 mm sucrose, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, and 0.5 mm EDTA). CHO cells were broken by passage (14 times) through a 25-gauge syringe; unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 2500 rpm for 5 min. Post-nuclear supernatants were centrifuged (68,000 × g in a TLA 100.3 Beckman rotor for 30 min) to obtain supernatant (cytosol) and pellet (membrane) fractions. Pellets were suspended in a volume of HB2 containing 1% Triton equal to that of the supernatant. CHO cells in 12-well plates were permeabilized with 0.4 μg of tetanolysin in 0.6 ml of HGI buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. Cells were harvested directly into 125 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer with β-mercaptoethanol and boiled. Immunoprecipitation with α-pan-Ras (Y13-259, Sigma Chemical Co.) was performed similar to a previous study (15.Zhang L. Wang H. Masters S.C. Wang B. Barbieri J.T. Fu H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12159-12164Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μl of Protein G-Sepharose and 3 μl of carrier Sepharose were blocked with CHO cell lysate for 30 min and then incubated for 2 h with CHO cell membranes without or with 0.5 μg of α-pan Ras antibody. Sepharose was pelleted with low speed centrifugation, washed with 300 μl of PBS, suspended in 25 μl of sample buffer without β-mercaptoethanol, and boiled. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF, which was exposed to x-ray film or for Western blot experiments subjected to ECL (Pierce) as described by the manufacturer. Primary antibody dilutions were 1/1000 (α-ExoS), 1/2000 (α-GFP), or 1/5000 (His probe). Trypan blue permeability was assayed as previously described (5.Pederson K.J. Vallis A.J. Aktories K. Frank D.W. Barbieri J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.4% Trypan Blue stain (Invitrogen) was added to CHO cells. After 5 min, stain was removed, and cells washed twice with PBS and inspected by light microscopy. ExoS ADP-ribosylates members of the Ras family at multiple sites, including Arg-41 and Arg-128, which disrupt Ras-mediated signal transduction (11.Ganesan A.K. Frank D.W. Misra R.P. Schmidt G. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7332-7337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). ExoS requiresFactor-Activating Exoenzyme S(FAS), a widely distributed member of the 14-3-3 protein family, to catalyze ADP-ribosylation (15.Zhang L. Wang H. Masters S.C. Wang B. Barbieri J.T. Fu H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12159-12164Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 16.Fu H. Coburn J. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2320-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, ExoS transferase (residues 232–453) ADP-ribosylated Ras and Ral only in the presence of NAD and FAS. The N terminus of ExoS stimulates GTP hydrolysis by Rho GTPases (3.Goehring U.-M. Schmidt G. Pederson K.J. Aktories K. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36369-36372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). To assess the influence of FAS on the Rho-GAP activity of ExoS, [γ-32P]GTP-bound RhoA was incubated with ExoS-GAP (residues 1–231) or full-length ExoS without and with FAS and GTPase activity was measured. As shown in Fig. 2(top), the presence of FAS did not enhance GTP hydrolysis by Rho proteins stimulated by the ExoS-GAP fragment. Similar results were obtained for ExoS-GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis by Rac and Cdc42 (not shown). Consistent with these findings, the GAP activity of full-length ExoS was not altered by FAS (Fig. 2, bottom). Also an increasing amount of FAS (up to 10 μm) had no influence on the GAP activity of ExoS. Moreover, FAS is not needed for Rho-GAP activity (not shown). To test if the GAP domain of ExoS is ADP-ribosylated, ExoS-GAP was incubated with different concentrations of the transferase domain (amino acids 232–453) and [32P]NAD with FAS, and the extent of labeling was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 3, the transferase domain catalyzed the ADP-ribosylation of the GAP domain in a concentration-dependent manner. ADP-ribosylation was detectable after incubation of 1 nm transferase with 2 μm GAP domain for 30 min at 30 °C. Modification was maximal with 50 nm transferase, indicating a catalytic action of the transferase. The effect of ADP-ribosylation of ExoS on its ability to stimulate RhoA GTPase activity was determined (Fig. 4). The GAP domain of ExoS that had been pretreated with NAD and FAS retained its RhoA GAP activity. In contrast, full-length ExoS that had been pretreated with both FAS and NAD had reduced RhoA GAP activity. Because FAS and NAD are essential for ADP-ribosyltransferase, it appeared that the full-length toxin had auto-ADP-ribosylated the GAP domain, which resulted in the inactivation of GAP activity. Because Arg-146 is essential for the GAP activity of ExoS (3.Goehring U.-M. Schmidt G. Pederson K.J. Aktories K. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36369-36372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), we asked if Arg-146 was ADP-ribosylated. When Arg-146 of ExoS was replaced by Lys, the auto-ADP-ribosylation of ExoS was significantly reduced (Fig. 5A), suggesting preferential, but not exclusive, modification of Arg-146 of ExoS. Quantification of the total amount of radiolabel incorporated under optimal conditions showed that the GAP domain was ADP-ribosylated by about 76 ± 15%. By contrast, up to 37 ± 3% of the mutant R146K was modified under the same conditions. Furthermore, we studied the incorporation of radioactively labeled ADP-ribose into full-length ExoS with the time (Fig. 5B). We found a maximal ADP-ribosylation of full-length ExoS after 15–30 min of incubation. Quantification of the data obtained after 15 min resulted in incorporation of 45.5 ± 4.3 pmol radiolabel into 50 pmol of full-length ExoS. Samples modified under the same conditions were used for the analysis of GAP activity. To analyze the effects of the ADP-ribosylation of the GAP domain of ExoS, we incubated purified ExoS1-234 with the transferase domain or with buffer in the presence of NAD and FAS and afterward microinjected the proteins into EBL (embryonic bovine lung) cells. We studied the morphology of the cells after 90 min. Microinjection of ExoS1-234 led to retraction of cells (Fig. 6A). By contrast, after injection of the GAP domain, which was preincubated with the transferase in the presence of NAD and FAS, no retraction of the cells was detected, indicating that ADP-ribosylation blocked the GAP activity of the protein (Fig. 6B). As a negative control, we injected ExoS R146K, which has no GAP activity. Cells injected with the GAP-deficient ExoS mutant R146K showed no retraction (Fig. 6C). To assess the ADP-ribosylation of ExoS in cultured CHO cells and to test whether auto-ADP-ribosylation occurs in vivo, tetanolysin was used to introduce pores in the plasma membrane and permit entry of [32P]NAD. The protocol used for pore formation in CHO cell plasma membranes essentially followed the procedure described by Ahnert-Hilger et al. (14.Ahnert-Hilger G. Wegenhorst U. Stecher B. Spicher K. Rosenthal W. Gratz M. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). C3 toxin, which ADP-ribosylates intracellular Rho (17.Aktories K. Mohr C. Koch G. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 175: 115-131PubMed Google Scholar), was used to test the permeability of the tetanolysin pores to NAD. Without tetanolysin treatment, C3 toxin did not incorporate radiolabel from [32P]NAD into intracellular proteins (Fig. 7, lane 1). After tetanolysin treatment, C3 toxin catalyzed the incorporation of radiolabel from [32P]NAD into a single protein (Fig. 7, lanes 2 and 3) of ∼25 kDa, the predicted molecular mass of Rho, which indicated that tetanolysin produced pores in the cell membrane that allowed the entry of C3 and [32P]NAD. This system could, therefore, be used to evaluate the intracellular ADP-ribosylation of proteins catalyzed by P. aeruginosa (type-III)-delivered ExoS. CHO cells were infected with an ExoS-producing strain of P. aeruginosa, PA103 ΔexoU, exoT::Tc (pUCP-ExoS), or an isogenic strain of P. aeruginosa transformed with the vector control (pUCP), for 2, 3, or 4 h. Infected cells were washed to remove unbound P. aeruginosa, treated with tetanolysin, and incubated with [32P]NAD. After a 2-h infection with ExoS-producing P. aeruginosa, radiolabeled proteins were not detected in cell lysate (data not shown). After a 3-h infection, CHO cell lysates contained several radiolabeled proteins, the appearance of which was dependent on tetanolysin treatment (compare Fig. 8, 3 h, − and 3 h, +). The two predominant radiolabeled proteins had apparent molecular masses of 25 and 50 kDa. Tetanolysin dependence of this radiolabeling indicated that the integrity of the CHO cell plasma membrane had been retained. Most radiolabeled proteins were in the membrane fraction (Fig. 8), although about 20% of the radiolabeled 50-kDa protein was in the cytosol. After a 4-h infection with ExoS-producing P. aeruginosa, cell lysates contained more radiolabeled protein than after the 3-h infection and the ratio of 32P in the 50-kDa protein to that in the 25-kDa protein increased, from 0.63 (± 0.27) at a 3-h infection to 1.70 (± 0.10) at a 4-h infection (Fig. 8), suggesting accumulation of the 50-kDa protein during the infection. After a 4-h infection, the incorporation of radiolabel was no longer dependent on tetanolysin (compare Fig. 8, 4 h, − and 4 h, +), indicating increased permeability of the plasma membrane in cells infected with ExoS-producing P. aeruginosa, which was confirmed by demonstration of permeability toward Trypan blue (data not shown). Radiolabeling of proteins in P. aeruginosa-infected cells was ExoS-dependent, because a 4-h infection with a vector-containing strain of P. aeruginosa, P. aeruginosa (PA103 ΔexoU, exoT::Tc (pUCP), did not result in the radiolabeling of proteins after tetanolysin treatment and incubation with [32P]NAD (Fig. 8, 4 h*, +). A 4-h infection with the vector-containing strain did not result in increased permeability toward Trypan blue (data not shown). α-Ras antibody immunoprecipitated a radiolabeled protein that co-migrated with the 25-kDa, radiolabeled protein (Fig. 9A, lane 4). Experiments were performed to determine the efficiency of immunoprecipitation to determine the amount of Ras present in the radiolabeled 25-kDa protein. His6-HRas-transfected CHO cells and control CHO cells that had been infected with ExoS-producing P. aeruginosa were treated with tetanolysin and [32P]NAD, and cell lysates were prepared. Immunoprecipitation of His6-HRas from cell lysates yielded a major radiolabeled band unique to His6-HRas-transfected cells (Fig. 9A, lane 6), and a lower molecular weight band. The lower molecular weight band appears to be a degradation product of His6Ras, because it is reactive in His-probe Western blots (data not shown). In immunoprecipitations, the intensity of radiolabeled endogenous Ras is one-fifth His6Ras, whereas in lysates, the intensity of radiolabel between 25 and 30 kDa is only 1.3 times greater in His6-HRas-transfected CHO cells (Fig. 9B). This indicates that Ras is a minor component of the radiolabeled 25-kDa proteins. The 50-kDa radiolabeled protein in lysates from CHO cells infected with ExoS-producing strains of P. aeruginosa co-migrated with authentic ExoS on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 9B), and the amount of radiolabeled 50-kDa protein increased with time of infection. Immunoreaction of the 50-kDa radiolabeled protein with antibody against α-ExoS confirmed its identification (Fig. 10, top). The lysates also contained a radiolabeled protein with an apparent molecular mass of 43 kDa that reacted with α-ExoS antibody after longer exposure of x-ray film (data not shown), which appeared to be a processed form of ExoS. In lysates of CHO cells infected with P. aeruginosa containing control vector, a radiolabeled α-ExoS reactive protein was not detected (Fig. 10, top, Bck). Pseudomonas aeruginosa ExoS is a bifunctional toxin containing N-terminal Rho-GAP and C-terminal ADP-ribosyltransferase domains. The ADP-ribosyltransferase activity depends strictly on the 14-3-3 protein FAS. Pretreatment of full-length ExoS with either FAS or NAD did not alter Rho-GAP activity; however, pretreatment with both NAD and FAS resulted in an inhibition of Rho-GAP activity, suggesting that auto-ADP-ribosylation interfered with Rho GTPase stimulation. The activity of the GAP domain (ExoS1–234) was also inhibited in the presence of the transferase domain (ExoS232–453) with NAD and FAS. In addition, auto-ADP-ribosylation of the Rho-GAP domain reduced its activity by about one order of magnitude. In vitro, the substrate specificity of ExoS ADP-ribosyltransferase is rather broad, and ExoS appears to ADP-ribosylate more than one arginine residue in its in vivo target Ras (11.Ganesan A.K. Frank D.W. Misra R.P. Schmidt G. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7332-7337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We sought to identify the acceptor amino acids in the GAP domain of ExoS that were modified by the C-terminal transferase domain. Previous mutational studies indicate that Arg-146 is important for expression of Rho-GAP activity (3.Goehring U.-M. Schmidt G. Pederson K.J. Aktories K. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36369-36372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Our studies reveal that Arg-146 (one of 11 in Rho-GAP domain of ExoS) is a site of preferential modification. Therefore, auto-ADP-ribosylation of Arg-146 by ExoS transferase blocks its GAP activity. Recently, it was shown that Arg-146 of ExoS is also essential for its cytotoxic effects (6.Pederson K.J. Pal S. Vallis A.J. Frank D.W. Barbieri J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 298-299Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In line with this notion is our finding that microinjection of the ExoS-GAP domain into EBL cells caused rounding up and retraction of cells, whereas microinjection of the ExoS-GAP domain, which was ADP-ribosylated by the transferase domain, did not cause the typical cytotoxic effects. Analysis of the crystal structure of the ExoS·Rac complex corroborates the importance of Arg-146 (7.Wurtele M. Wolf E. Pederson K.J. Buchwald G. Ahmadian M.R. Barbieri J.T. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Arg-146 stabilizes the transition state of GTP hydrolysis by Rho by positioning the interacting partners in the nucleotide hydrolysis reaction. A similar arginine finger is present in all known Rho GAPs. In the absence of Rho, Arg-146 is exposed on the surface of the ExoS molecule and is accessible to the transferase (18.Würtele M. Renault L. Barbieri J.T. Wittinghofer A. Wolf E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 26-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To permit the identification of intracellular substrates for ADP-ribosylation by ExoS, tetanolysin was used for pore formation in target cells to permit entry of [32P]NAD. In a frequently used alternative approach, intact cells are incubated with or without the ADP-ribosyltransferase and, thereafter, proteins in the cell lysate are subjected to in vitro[32P]ADP-ribosylation reactions (19.Xu Y. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 825-832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prior intracellular ADP-ribosylation is evidenced by the absence of labeling of a target protein in vitro. This approach has been used to provide a global assessment of in vivo ADP-ribosylation by several toxins, including cholera toxin and pertussis toxin. A limitation of this approach is that it is optimal only when both in vivo and in vitro ADP-ribosylation can be carried to completion. Utilization of this approach with ExoS failed to identify in vivo substrates, because labeling to completion in vitro resulted in the modification of hundreds of proteins (data not shown). Another approach used to detect in vivo ADP-ribosylation is the identification of a shift in the apparent molecular weight of proteins from cells treated with the ADP-ribosyltransferase. This method was used to demonstrate in vivo modification of Ras by ExoS (20.McGuffie E.M. Frank D.W. Vincent T.S. Olson J.C. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2607-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but is not applicable to global assessment of modified substrates. Furthermore, this approach requires that ADP-ribosylation shifts the electrophoretic mobility of a protein and that antibodies to identify the modified protein are available. ADP-ribosylation of EF-2 by diphtheria toxin did not shift the apparent molecular weight (21.Collier R.J. Moss J. Vaughan M. ADP-ribosylating Toxins and G Proteins. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1990Google Scholar). Moreover, molecular weight shift is an indirect measure of ADP-ribosylation. Shifted forms of wild-type ExoS introduced into cultured cells by Yersinia were observed and were absent when the ExoS was catalytically inactive (22.Sundin C. Henriksson M.L. Hallberg B. Forsberg A. Frithz-Lindsten E. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The nature of these posttranslational modifications was not defined. To assess in vivo ADP-ribosylation, a tetanolysin-based approach was developed. Tetanolysin is a 55-kDa member of the streptolysin O family of cholesterol-dependent pore-forming toxins. Tetanolysin pores, which permit diffusion of small proteins and molecules, have been used frequently, e.g. in studies of cAMP- and Ca2+-induced effects in T-cell signal transduction (23.Alava M.A. DeBell K.E. Conti A. Hoffman T. Bonvini E. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 24.Conti A. Brando C. DeBell K.E. Alava M.A. Hoffman T. Bonvini E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 783-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Exoenzyme C3, which in cells specifically ADP-ribosylates only Rho (25.Aktories K. Schmidt G. Just I. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), was employed to establish proof-of-principle for the detection of intracellular ADP-ribosylation where addition of C3 and [32P]NAD resulted in incorporation of radiolabel into a single 25-kDa protein. Thus, an assay with pore-forming proteins can be useful for identifying targets of ADP-ribosylation in vivo, because it permits observation of the entire population of intracellular proteins. Tetanolysin-mediated entry of [32P]NAD is practical for infection studies because it permits temporal control of substrate addition that allows analysis of a time course during infection and assessment of cell viability. Four hours after infection, tetanolysin was no longer required for the entry of [32P]NAD into infected CHO cells. The tetanolysin-independence of NAD diffusion indicated the loss of membrane integrity after 4 h of infection, a finding consistent with the failure of CHO cells to exclude Trypan blue at this time point (26.Vallis A.J. Finck-Barbancon V. Yahr T.L. Frank D.W. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2040-2044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Olson J.C. McGuffie E.M. Frank D.W. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 248-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tetanolysin itself did not introduce artifactual ADP-ribosylation, because it did not alter the pattern of labeled proteins seen after a 4-h infection. These experiments also established predominant labeling of 50- and 25-kDa proteins after a 3-h infection when cells were still viable. Early experiments by Coburn et al. (10.Coburn J. Wyatt R.T. Iglewski B.H. Gill D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9004-9008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that in vitro ExoS modified a specific group of 20–30-kDa proteins that included Ras. Consistent with those findings, we observed after a 3-h infection with ExoS-producing P. aeruginosa, the specific ADP-ribosylation of a group of proteins between 20 and 30 kDa that included Ras. Comparison of immunoprecipitates from GFP-transfected CHO cells and HRas-transfected cells after the 3-h infection revealed that Ras was a minor component of radiolabeled endogenous proteins. We are attempting to identify other proteins modified at that time. The 50-kDa band modified was identified as ExoS. Although auto-ADP-ribosylation of bacterial toxins has been noted in vitro, there are no reports that ADP-ribosylation alters toxin function. In mammalian cells, auto-ADP-ribosylation of ADP-ribosyltransferases ART5 (28.Stevens L.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. Pizza M. Rappuoli R. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 259-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and NADase EC 3.2.2.5 (29.Han M.-K. Lee J.-Y. Cho Y.-S. Song Y.M. An N.-H. Kim H.-R. Kim U.-H. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) modulates NAD glycohydrolase activity. In addition, auto-ADP-ribosylation of an arginine-specific chicken heterophil ADP-ribosyltransferase was reported to alter intrinsic transferase activity (30.Yamada K. Tsuchiya M. Nishikori Y. Shimoyama M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In amino acid sequence, ExoS more closely resembles eukaryotic ADP-ribosyltransferases than other bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferases (31.Ganesan A.K. Mende-Mueller L. Selzer J. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9503-9508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In vivo auto-ADP-ribosylation of ExoS and subsequent functional alteration establishes additional similarity with mammalian ADP-ribosyltransferases. Auto-ADP-ribosylation of ExoS modifies Arg-146, an arginine required for GAP activity. Modulation of Rho GAP activity by auto-ADP-ribosylation may reveal further differences between ExoS and ExoT, a type III-secreted P. aeruginosa effector which has GAP activity similar to ExoS, but lacks ADP-ribosyltransferase activity."

InXenopus, three members of the LEF/TCF family, XLEF-1, XTCF-3, and XTCF-4, with distinct but partially overlapping expression patterns have been identified. The individual XenopusLEF/TCF family members differ extremely in their properties of target gene regulation. We observed that in contrast to LEF-1, neither XTCF-3 nor XTCF-4 can induce secondary axis formation upon ventral overexpression in Xenopus embryos. To identify functional motifs within the LEF/TCF transcription factors responsible for target gene activation or repression, we created various mutants and a set of XLEF-1/XTCF-3 chimeras. In overexpression studies, we asked whether these constructs can mimic an activated Wnt/β-catenin pathway and lead to the formation of a secondary body axis. In addition, we examined their capacity to rescue a loss-of-function phenotype given by dominant negative LEF-1 expression. We further analyzed their ability to directly activate target genes in reporter gene assays using the LEF/TCF target promoters, siamois and fibronectin. We found that a region homologous to exon IVa of human TCF-1 is an activating element. This is flanked by two small repressing motifs, LVPQ and SXXSS. Our findings implicate that the motifs identified here play an essential role in determining cell type-specific activity of LEF/TCF transcription factors.

Besides the important function in early development, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway has been shown to be involved in cancer formation. Disregulation of this pathway either by loss of function mutations in the tumor suppressor APC or stabilizing mutations in the oncogene β-catenin, leading to the up-regulation of the target genes c-myc and cyclin D1, are found in numerous human cancers and cancer-derived cell lines (22.Peifer M.

They belong to the family of sequence-specific HMG box transcription factors. They have been originally described as architectural transcription factors that regulate gene expression by bending DNA (26.Giese K. Kingsley C. Kirshner J.R. Grosschedl R.

In the simplest model of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade, they interact with the transactivator β-catenin (19.Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kühl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D. Grosschedl R. Birchmeier W.

TCF-driven transcription is further complicated by the fact that they are differentially spliced, resulting in a multiplicity of splice variants as reported for hTCF-1 (38.van de Wetering M. Castrop J. Korinek V. Clevers H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and hLEF-1 (39.Hovanes K. Li T.W.H. Waterman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1994-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Different splice variants of the same TCF family member (e.g. XTCF-4) either activate or repress the promoter of the Wnt/β-catenin target gene fibronectin (40.Pukrop T. Gradl D. Henningfeld K. Knöchel W. Wedlich D. Kühl M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8968-8978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Their specific character is not due to variable DNA-binding properties or differences in the recruitment of β-catenin, Smads, or groucho. Instead, phosphorylation regulated by the LVPQ and SFLSS motifs seems to play a crucial role in regulating TCF activity and ternary complex formation (40.Pukrop T. Gradl D. Henningfeld K. Knöchel W. Wedlich D. Kühl M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8968-8978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Among the TCFs, the exon/intron structure is best characterized in hTCF-1 (38.van de Wetering M. Castrop J. Korinek V. Clevers H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison revealed that the LVPQ and SFLSS motifs in XTCF-4 flank a sequence motif homolog to exon IVa of hTCF-1. According to the genomic structure of hTCF-1, we hereafter refer to this motif as exon IVa. Thus far, three different members of the LEF/TCF family with distinct but partially overlapping expression patterns have been described inXenopus: XTCF-3 (25.Molenaar M. van de Wetering M. Oosterwegel M. Peterson-Maduro J. Godsave S. Korinek V. Roose J. Destree O. Clevers H. Cell. 1996; 86: 391-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar), XLEF-1 (41.Molenaar M. Roose J. Peterson J. Venanzi S. Clevers H. Destree O. Mech. Dev. 1998; 75: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and XTCF-4 (42.König A. Gradl D. Kühl M. Wedlich D. Mech. Dev. 2000; 93: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although there is no doubt that they are nuclear transducers of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, it has never been shown that a Xenopus-specific LEF/TCF family member can induce a secondary axis upon ventral injection. Instead, the early embryological data presented so far describe a repressive function of XTCF-3 on axis formation (20.Brannon M. Brown J.D. Bates R. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Development. 1999; 12: 3159-3170Crossref Google Scholar). To discriminate the functional role of the distinct LEF/TCF family members, it is important to know their common structure and to identify motifs responsible for target gene activation or repression.Xenopus provides a suitable assay system, since capacities of axis induction and target gene activation can be compared. In this study, we focus on the contribution of exon IVa and its flanking regions to the activity of these transcription factors in a detailed functional analysis using all known Xenopus LEF/TCFs. Our findings demonstrate that exon IVa is an activating element in LEF/TCF transcription factors, whereas the flanking LVPQ and SXXSS motifs together form a repressing element. Wild-type XLEF-1, XTCF-3, and XTCF-4 are the same as described (40.Pukrop T. Gradl D. Henningfeld K. Knöchel W. Wedlich D. Kühl M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8968-8978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Point mutations in XTCF-3 were constructed with a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the description of the manufacturer. PCR fragments were amplified using a proofreading polymerase (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany) and combined to create deletion mutants. The following primers were used: XTCF-3 5′, XTCF-3 3′, and XTCF-3ΔC 3′ as described (40.Pukrop T. Gradl D. Henningfeld K. Knöchel W. Wedlich D. Kühl M. J. Biol.

XTCF-3 exon IVa was inserted in XLEF-1 by combining PCR fragments from XLEF-1 and XTCF-3 amplified with the following primers: XLEF-1 5′ and XLEF-1 3′ as previously described (40.Pukrop T. Gradl D. Henningfeld K. Knöchel W. Wedlich D. Kühl M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8968-8978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).

Exon IVa from XTCF-3 was amplified using either wild-type XTCF-3 or the ΔLVPQΔSLVSS mutant as template. The constructs were N-terminally fused to six copies of the c-myc tag, inserted into theXhoI site of pCS2 expression vector (43.Rupp R. Weintraub H. Cell. 1991; 65: 927-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and verified by sequencing. MLEF-1 and dominant negative mLEF-1 (ΔHMGLEF-1) in psp64T3 were described elsewhere (19.Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kühl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D. Grosschedl R. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 382: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar). The fibronectin promoter in pGL2 and β-galactosidase under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter were as described (40.Pukrop T. Gradl D. Henningfeld K. Knöchel W. Wedlich D. Kühl M. J. Biol.

A6 cells were raised and transfected as previously described (40.Pukrop T. Gradl D. Henningfeld K. Knöchel W. Wedlich D. Kühl M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8968-8978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). h293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and transfected using the calcium phosphate method (44.Gorman C. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. IRL press, Oxford1985: 143-190Google Scholar) with 1 μg of cytomegalovirus β-galactosidase, 2 μg of promoter-luciferase construct, and 2 μg of LEF/TCF construct. Promoter activity was determined and normalized as previously described (31.Gradl D. Kühl M. Wedlich D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5576-5587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A6 cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and transfected with TCF constructs. Cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde 48 h after transfection, treated for 8 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in amphibian phosphate-buffered saline, blocked for 30 min with 1% bovine serum albumin in amphibian phosphate-buffered saline, incubated overnight with the TCF3/4 antibody (Biomol). The antibody was visualized using Cy3-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody. After co-staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, cells were embedded in Elvanol and analyzed using fluorescence microscopy (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). In vitrotranscribed mRNA of LEF/TCF constructs was injected either in ventral or dorsal blastomeres of Xenopus 4-cell stage embryos. Embryos were obtained by in vitrofertilization, cultivated, and injected as described (45.Geis K. Aberle H. Kühl M. Kemler R. Wedlich D. Dev. Genes Evol. 1998; 207: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and staged according to the normal table of Nieuwkoop and Faber (46.Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis (Daudin). North Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1975Google Scholar). Injected embryos were raised until stage 32, and then they were screened for the induction of secondary axis, or the dorso-anterior index (DAI) according to Kao and Elinson (47.Kao K.R. Elinson R.P. Dev. Biol. 1988; 127: 64-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) was calculated. To measure the induction of siamoisexpression upon injection of LEF/TCF constructs, complete RNAs of stage 10 Xenopus embryos were extracted using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) followed by a DNase digest. 1 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). cDNA according to 25 ng of RNA was amplified using the following primers: H4 forward (5′-CGGGATAACATTCAGGGTATCACT-3′) and H4 reverse (5′-ATCCATGGCGGTAACTGTCTTCCT-3′), 30 cycles; siamois forward (5′-CTCCAGCCACCAGTACCAGATC-3′) and siamois reverse (5′-GGGGAGAGTGGAAAGTGGTTG-3′), 34 cycles. To discriminate between the XTCF-4 isoforms, cDNA of differentXenopus stages was amplified with the following primers: XTCF-4 forward (5′-CCCTCGAGCCGCTCATTACCTACAGCAAC-3′) and XTCF-4 reverse (5′-CTTCTCGAGCAGCATGAACGCGTTTAGGGG-3′), 34 cycles. To identify the individual XTCF-4 variants the products were digested with RsaI and XbaI. Radioimmune precipitation assay lysate of one embryonic equivalent of stage 14 embryos was loaded on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and incubated with the 9E10 anti-myc antibody. Secondary antibody was a goat anti-mouse antibody coupled with horseradish peroxidase. Visualization was performed using ECL substrate (Amersham Biosciences). Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer lysates of 5 × 106cells were precipitated with 1 μg of protein A-purified 9E10 antibody. One-twentieth of the precipitate was loaded on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE. The transfected constructs were detected as described above. In Xenopus, three members of the LEF/TCF family, XLEF-1, XTCF-3, and XTCF-4, have been identified. They are highly homologous in the N-terminal β-catenin binding site (48.Omer C.A. Miller P.J. Diehl R.E. Kral A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 49.Graham T.A. Weaver C. Mao F. Kimelman D. Xu W.

Lower homology between the different LEF/TCF family members is found in the core region between the β-catenin binding site and the HMG box and within the C terminus (elements A, B, and C in Figs.1A and 7).Figure 7Overall structure of LEF/TCF transcription factors. All LEF/TCFs share highly homologous β-catenin binding and DNA binding sites, whereas domains A andB reveal lower homology. The activating exon IVa is flanked by the repressing elements LVPQ and SXXSS. The C terminus (domain C) is TCF-specific. The lower part lists the elements involved in axis formation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have isolated three variants of XTCF-4, XTCF-4A, XTCF-4B, and XTCF-4C, which differ in the presence or absence of the two small motifs, LVPQ and SFLSS, flanking exon IVa according to hTCF-1 (Refs. 38.van de Wetering M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 8968-8978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar; Fig. 1A). Recently, we have shown that XTCF-4A and -4B act as repressors of the Wnt/β-catenin target gene fibronectin, whereas XTCF-4C activates the fibronectin promoter (40.Pukrop T. Gradl D. Henningfeld K. Knöchel W. Wedlich D. Kühl M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8968-8978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This prompted us to identify regulatory motifs within the TCF-4 subgroup that are responsible for the subtype-specific gene control. Evidence for a physiological role of these isoforms is given by their temporal expression profile in early embryogenesis. We found by restriction pattern analysis of RT-PCR fragments that XTCF-4C, the activating form, is expressed first, starting at neurula stage 16 (46). As ontogenesis proceeds, the repressing XTCF-4 variants appear, XTCF-4A at stage 18 and XTCF-4B at stage 21. Coexpression of all three variants was observed from stage 21 until stage 35 (Fig. 1B). Although similar variants in hTCF-4 have not been identified yet, the genomic structure of hTCF-4 reveals putative splice acceptor and donor sites, which lead to variants containing or missing the LVPQ and SFLSS motifs (50.Duval A. Rolland S. Tubacher E. Bui H. Thomas G. Hamelin R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3872-3879PubMed Google Scholar). In Xenopus, XTCF-3 also contains these short motifs that are flanking exon IVa, whereas XLEF-1 possesses neither the short motifs nor an exon IVa-corresponding insert (25.Molenaar M. van de Wetering M.

XTCF-3 behaves as repressor in promoter reporter assays comparable with XTCF-4A and -4B (40.Pukrop T. Gradl D. Henningfeld K. Knöchel W. Wedlich D. Kühl M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8968-8978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), whereas XLEF-1 is an activator (40.Pukrop T. Gradl D. Henningfeld K. Knöchel W. Wedlich D. Kühl M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8968-8978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To elucidate the relevance of the two short motifs and exon IVa flanked by them in TCF function, we generated several mutants of XTCF-3 and XLEF-1 affecting this domain and compared their activities with those of the XTCF-4 isoforms. We exchanged, for example, the serine residues with alanines in the SSLVSS motif of XTCF-3 or deleted the entire motif. Additionally, the LVPQ motif was removed in some constructs (Fig. 1A). To exclude the influence of the co-repressor CtBP on XTCF-3 function, we also generated XTCF-3 mutants lacking the C terminus. As a well characterized activating XTCF-3 construct, which was found to activate the TOPFLASH reporter in coloncarcinoma cells (32.Roose J. Molenaar M. Peterson J. Hurenkamp J. Brantjes H. Moerer P. van de Weering M. Destree O. Clevers H. Nature. 1998; 395: 608-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) and to activate the fibronectin promoter in Xenopus A6 cells (31.Gradl D. Kühl M. Wedlich D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5576-5587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we included in our analyses the XTCF-3Δgrg mutant. To avoid recruitment of the corepressor CtBP, we additionally truncated the XTCF-3Δgrg construct at the C terminus (XTCF-3ΔgrgΔC). One of the main differences between XLEF-1 and the otherXenopus TCFs is the lack of exon IVa. In this context, it is remarkable that the corresponding exon in hLEF-1 has been found to be alternatively spliced and that the most commonly used LEF-1, the murine ortholog, contains this exon. With the aim of studying the functional role of this exon, we created chimeric XLEF-1 constructs, which contain exon IVa of XTCF-3 with or without the LVPQ and SLVSS flanking elements (Fig. 1A). Different assays were performed to compare the activating or repressing properties of our constructs. To study whether these transcription factors can mimic an activated Wnt/β-catenin signal, we injected their RNA at the ventral side of Xenopus four-cell stage embryos and screened for the induction of a secondary axis. We further tested whether coinjection of these constructs together with dominant negative mLEF-1 at the dorsal side rescues the formation of the endogenous axis. To analyze the repressing function of the constructs in axis induction, we coinjected them ventrally with mLEF-1 and proved whether they suppress the formation of a secondary axis. Finally, to demonstrate that the activation via the LEF/TCF constructs is direct and due to target gene activation, we examined their effects on the activity of target gene promoters in reporter gene assays. Injection of the LEF/TCF constructs into the ventral blastomeres ofXenopus 4-cell stage embryos revealed that, in addition to the β-catenin binding site and the HMG box, further elements are required for the induction of a secondary axis. Unlike murine LEF-1, none of the Xenopus TCFs were able to induce a secondary axis upon ventral injection (Fig. 2B and Table I). Even the XTCF-3Δgrg mutant, which does not interact with groucho corepressors (32.Roose J. Molenaar M. Peterson J. Hurenkamp J. Brantjes H. Moerer P. van de Weering M. Destree O. Clevers H. Nature. 1998; 395: 608-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), and the ΔgrgΔC mutant of XTCF-3, which additionally lacks the CtBP binding motif, could not induce the formation of a secondary axis (Fig. 2Band Table I). The failure of this ΔgrgΔC mutant in axis formation indicates that the DNA- and β-catenin-binding sites alone are not sufficient for the induction of a secondary axis.Table IInduction of ectopic axes by LEF/TCF constructsDouble axisTotal no. of experimentsTotal no. of embryos%Control011225MLef-159.07133XTCF-4A05105XTCF-4C05105XTCF-30353XTCF-3ΔC0250XTCF3ΔLVPQ 259,263SA0351XTCF3ΔLVPQ 259,263SAΔC0367XTCF-3ΔLVPQΔSLVSS0250XTCF-3Δgrg0369XTCF-3ΔgrgΔC0367XLEF-11-aThe secondary axes induced by these constructs are much less complete than the axes induced by mLEF-1 and XLEF-1 + exon IVa (see Fig. 2B).32.910160XLEF-1 + exon IVa64.55107XLEF-1 + exon IVa + LVPQ + SLVSS1-aThe secondary axes induced by these constructs are much less complete than the axes induced by mLEF-1 and XLEF-1 + exon IVa (see Fig. 2B).26.891811-a The second"

Recent data suggest that the second requisite pathway might involve the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl (10.Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. Biochem.

Cbl forms a complex with the adapter protein CAP,1 a member of the SoHo family of proteins that contains a flotillin-binding SoHo domain in its amino terminus and three adjacent SH3 domains in its carboxyl terminus (11.Ribon V.

A. 2001; 98: 9098-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Once phosphorylated, the Cbl/CAP complex is recruited to lipid raft plasma membrane subdomains through the interaction of CAP with flotillin. The expression of dominant-interfering CAP mutants that lack either the SH3 or SoHo domains prevented the localization of this complex to plasma membrane microdomains and inhibited the stimulation of glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation by insulin (13.Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Chiang S.H. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9098-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).Following insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation, Cbl recruits the SH2-containing adapter protein CrkII to lipid raft microdomains along with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G (14.Chiang S.H. Baumann C.A. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Watson R.T. Neudauer C.L. Macara I.G. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Upon its translocation, C3G appears to activate the Rho family protein TC10, a member of the family of small GTP-binding proteins expressed in muscle and adipose tissue (15.Drivas G.T. Shih A. Coutavas E. Rush M.G. D'Eustachio P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Upon overexpression in murine 3T3L1 adipocytes, insulin activates hTC10 in a CAP-dependent but PI 3-kinase-independent manner (14.Chiang S.H. Baumann C.A. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Watson R.T. Neudauer C.L. Macara I.G. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Although the physiologically relevant effectors that interact with TC10 are unknown, disruption of its activation blocks insulin-stimulated glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation. Moreover, the mistargeting of TC10 to a non-lipid raft domain by production of a TC10/K-Ras chimera or disruption of lipid raft microdomains via expression of a dominant-interfering mutant form of caveolin-3 also completely prevented the activation of TC10 by insulin (16.Watson R.T. Shigematsu S. Chiang S.H. Mora S. Kanzaki M. Macara I.G. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 829-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).Although these experiments suggest that TC10 is a critical player in the hormonal regulation of glucose transport, they relied almost exclusively on the overexpression of the human form of TC10 in mouse cells. To study the endogenous forms of TC10 in the highly insulin-responsive mouse 3T3L1 cell line, we cloned the mouse ortholog of TC10. Interestingly, these efforts led to the identification of a closely related gene, referred to as TC10β, and another variant termed TC10βLong (TC10βL). We describe here the characterization of this gene, the regulation of its gene product by insulin, and the evaluation of its role in glucose transport.DISCUSSIONThe stimulation of glucose transport by insulin requires both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent and -independent pathways (9.Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 19.Baumann C.A. Saltiel A.R. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We recently described a novel signaling pathway that is segregated into a lipid raft subdomain of the plasma membrane. The insulin receptor catalyzes the tyrosine phosphorylation of the protooncogene Cbl, which is recruited to the receptor with the adaptor protein CAP (10.Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 11.Ribon V. Printen J.A. Hoffman N.G. Kay B.K. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20706-20714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Upon Cbl phosphorylation, the CAP/Cbl complex is translocated to lipid rafts via the interaction of the SoHo domain of CAP with the hydrophobic protein flotillin (12.Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 13.Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Chiang S.H. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9098-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Phospho-Cbl can in turn recruit the SH2/SH3 adapter protein CrkII to these microdomains along with the guanyl nucleotide exchange protein C3G. The insulin-stimulated recruitment of C3G to lipid rafts brings the exchange factor into proximity with the Rho family protein TC10, which appears to reside in lipid rafts because of its unique carboxyl-terminal sequences (14.Chiang S.H. Baumann C.A. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Watson R.T. Neudauer C.L. Macara I.G. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 16.Watson R.T.

TC10 undergoes activation via the C3G-catalyzed exchange of GTP for GDP, and the blockade of this pathway by overexpression of dominant negative forms of CAP prevents the stimulation of glucose transport by insulin (13.Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Chiang S.H. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9098-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 14.Chiang S.H. Baumann C.A. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Watson R.T. Neudauer C.L. Macara I.G. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar).A key determinant in the activation of TC10 by insulin lies in its localization in lipid raft microdomains. This property of the protein appears to be defined by its carboxyl terminal sequences. A TC10/K-Ras chimera was not activated by insulin and did not target to lipid rafts, whereas a TC10/H-ras chimera was insulin sensitive and localized into lipid rafts (16.Watson R.T. Shigematsu S. Chiang S.H. Mora S. Kanzaki M. Macara I.G. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 829-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the second isoform of TC10 described here (TC10β) is also activated by insulin treatment and is also localized in lipid rafts, providing further support for the functional importance of spatial targeting of this protein. Indeed, TC10α and β are similarly activated by insulin in a CAP-dependent manner and localized in identical fractions by sucrose density gradients as well as by immunolocalization by confocal microscopy.Despite similarities in function, the three isoforms of mTC10 differ in their impact on insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. The overexpression of mTC10α profoundly inhibits GLUT4 translocation in response to insulin, as was observed for the human form of this protein. This inhibitory effect was produced with the wild type, constitutively active, and inactive forms of the protein. In contrast, TC10β only slightly inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, whereas TC10βL was essentially without effect. Although the underlying reasons for these differences in biological effect remain unknown, the ability to inhibit GLUT4 translocation appears to correlate with the disruption in cortical actin structure. This may also account for the surprising observation that overexpression of the wild type, constitutively active, and dominant-interfering mutants of the TC10α isoforms are all inhibitory. Furthermore, these findings suggest that there are important determinants of effector binding in the amino-terminal sequences, where the TC10 isoforms are the most divergent. Alternatively, the active form of the protein might prevent the interaction of endogenous TC10 with its effectors, perhaps targeting the protein to an incorrect location or dramatically changing the kinetics of the interaction. Indeed, preliminary results suggest that candidate effector molecules show different affinities for TC10α and β in pull-down and immunoprecipitation experiments. In any case, TC10 isoforms appear to serve as signaling intermediates in the CAP/Cbl pathway, and the identification of multiple TC10 proteins in lipid raft microdomains will provide important clues toward understanding how TC10 isoforms mediate the effects of insulin on its target cells. Insulin increases glucose uptake by stimulating the translocation of the GLUT4 glucose transporter isoform from intracellular storage sites to the cell surface (1.Pessin J.E. Thurmond D.C.

Cbl forms a complex with the adapter protein CAP,1 a member of the SoHo family of proteins that contains a flotillin-binding SoHo domain in its amino terminus and three adjacent SH3 domains in its carboxyl terminus (11.Ribon V.

A. 2001; 98: 9098-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Once phosphorylated, the Cbl/CAP complex is recruited to lipid raft plasma membrane subdomains through the interaction of CAP with flotillin. The expression of dominant-interfering CAP mutants that lack either the SH3 or SoHo domains prevented the localization of this complex to plasma membrane microdomains and inhibited the stimulation of glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation by insulin (13.Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Chiang S.H. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9098-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Following insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation, Cbl recruits the SH2-containing adapter protein CrkII to lipid raft microdomains along with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G (14.Chiang S.H. Baumann C.A. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Watson R.T. Neudauer C.L. Macara I.G. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Upon its translocation, C3G appears to activate the Rho family protein TC10, a member of the family of small GTP-binding proteins expressed in muscle and adipose tissue (15.Drivas G.T. Shih A. Coutavas E. Rush M.G. D'Eustachio P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Upon overexpression in murine 3T3L1 adipocytes, insulin activates hTC10 in a CAP-dependent but PI 3-kinase-independent manner (14.Chiang S.H. Baumann C.A. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Watson R.T. Neudauer C.L. Macara I.G. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Although the physiologically relevant effectors that interact with TC10 are unknown, disruption of its activation blocks insulin-stimulated glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation. Moreover, the mistargeting of TC10 to a non-lipid raft domain by production of a TC10/K-Ras chimera or disruption of lipid raft microdomains via expression of a dominant-interfering mutant form of caveolin-3 also completely prevented the activation of TC10 by insulin (16.Watson R.T.

Although these experiments suggest that TC10 is a critical player in the hormonal regulation of glucose transport, they relied almost exclusively on the overexpression of the human form of TC10 in mouse cells. To study the endogenous forms of TC10 in the highly insulin-responsive mouse 3T3L1 cell line, we cloned the mouse ortholog of TC10. Interestingly, these efforts led to the identification of a closely related gene, referred to as TC10β, and another variant termed TC10βLong (TC10βL). We describe here the characterization of this gene, the regulation of its gene product by insulin, and the evaluation of its role in glucose transport. DISCUSSIONThe stimulation of glucose transport by insulin requires both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent and -independent pathways (9.Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 19.Baumann C.A. Saltiel A.R. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We recently described a novel signaling pathway that is segregated into a lipid raft subdomain of the plasma membrane. The insulin receptor catalyzes the tyrosine phosphorylation of the protooncogene Cbl, which is recruited to the receptor with the adaptor protein CAP (10.Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 11.Ribon V. Printen J.A. Hoffman N.G. Kay B.K. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20706-20714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Upon Cbl phosphorylation, the CAP/Cbl complex is translocated to lipid rafts via the interaction of the SoHo domain of CAP with the hydrophobic protein flotillin (12.Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9098-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Phospho-Cbl can in turn recruit the SH2/SH3 adapter protein CrkII to these microdomains along with the guanyl nucleotide exchange protein C3G. The insulin-stimulated recruitment of C3G to lipid rafts brings the exchange factor into proximity with the Rho family protein TC10, which appears to reside in lipid rafts because of its unique carboxyl-terminal sequences (14.Chiang S.H. Baumann C.A. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Watson R.T. Neudauer C.L. Macara I.G. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 16.Watson R.T.

TC10 undergoes activation via the C3G-catalyzed exchange of GTP for GDP, and the blockade of this pathway by overexpression of dominant negative forms of CAP prevents the stimulation of glucose transport by insulin (13.Kimura A.

Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar).A key determinant in the activation of TC10 by insulin lies in its localization in lipid raft microdomains. This property of the protein appears to be defined by its carboxyl terminal sequences. A TC10/K-Ras chimera was not activated by insulin and did not target to lipid rafts, whereas a TC10/H-ras chimera was insulin sensitive and localized into lipid rafts (16.Watson R.T. Shigematsu S.

Interestingly, the second isoform of TC10 described here (TC10β) is also activated by insulin treatment and is also localized in lipid rafts, providing further support for the functional importance of spatial targeting of this protein. Indeed, TC10α and β are similarly activated by insulin in a CAP-dependent manner and localized in identical fractions by sucrose density gradients as well as by immunolocalization by confocal microscopy.Despite similarities in function, the three isoforms of mTC10 differ in their impact on insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. The overexpression of mTC10α profoundly inhibits GLUT4 translocation in response to insulin, as was observed for the human form of this protein. This inhibitory effect was produced with the wild type, constitutively active, and inactive forms of the protein. In contrast, TC10β only slightly inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, whereas TC10βL was essentially without effect. Although the underlying reasons for these differences in biological effect remain unknown, the ability to inhibit GLUT4 translocation appears to correlate with the disruption in cortical actin structure. This may also account for the surprising observation that overexpression of the wild type, constitutively active, and dominant-interfering mutants of the TC10α isoforms are all inhibitory. Furthermore, these findings suggest that there are important determinants of effector binding in the amino-terminal sequences, where the TC10 isoforms are the most divergent. Alternatively, the active form of the protein might prevent the interaction of endogenous TC10 with its effectors, perhaps targeting the protein to an incorrect location or dramatically changing the kinetics of the interaction. Indeed, preliminary results suggest that candidate effector molecules show different affinities for TC10α and β in pull-down and immunoprecipitation experiments. In any case, TC10 isoforms appear to serve as signaling intermediates in the CAP/Cbl pathway, and the identification of multiple TC10 proteins in lipid raft microdomains will provide important clues toward understanding how TC10 isoforms mediate the effects of insulin on its target cells. The stimulation of glucose transport by insulin requires both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent and -independent pathways (9.Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Clin.

Choroidal neovascularization is a hallmark of this disease, which closely resembles the exudative form of age-related macular degeneration. However, the mechanism by which TIMP-3 mutations induce the disease phenotype in SFD remains unknown. To address this question we established human retinal pigment epithelial cell lines expressing wild type or S156C (Ser156 changed to cysteine) mutant TIMP-3. S156C TIMP-3 had reduced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitory activity in retinal pigment epithelial cells and resulted in increased secretion and activation of gelatinase A and B. The conditioned medium from these cells induced angiogenesis in “in vivo” chick chorioallantoic membrane assays that could be reversed with recombinant wild type TIMP-3. Our data indicate that the choroidal neovascularization in SFD may be a result of increased MMP activity, which could lead to the stimulation of angiogenesis. These results also suggest the potential therapeutic use of TIMP-3 or synthetic MMP inhibitors in this disease.

SFD is a relatively rare disease, but it has generated significant interest because it closely resembles the exudative or “wet” form of age-related macular degeneration, the most common cause of blindness in the elderly population of the western world. SFD is characterized by accumulation of extracellular deposits (drusen)in Bruch's membrane, the five-layered sheet of connective tissue that separates the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) from the choriocapillaris (6.Capon M.R. Marshall J. Krafft J.I. Alexander R.A. Hiscott P.S. Bird A.C. Ophthalmology. 1989; 96: 1769-1777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The predominant histopathological feature in the eyes of a 63-year-old patient with SFD was a confluent 30-μm thick, lipid-containing amorphous deposit found between the basement membrane of the RPE and the inner collagenous layer of Bruch's membrane (6.Capon M.R. Marshall J. Krafft J.I. Alexander R.A. Hiscott P.S. Bird A.C. Ophthalmology. 1989; 96: 1769-1777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This is distinct from the basal linear deposits seen in age-related macular degeneration that consist of filamentous fine granular material and may represent a thickened basement membrane of the RPE (6.Capon M.R. Marshall J. Krafft J.I. Alexander R.A. Hiscott P.S. Bird A.C. Ophthalmology. 1989; 96: 1769-1777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The subretinal deposits in both SFD and age-related macular degeneration have been shown to be rich in tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3) (7.Fariss R.N. Apte S.S. Luthert P.J. Bird A.C.

A serious complication of SFD is the invasion of the thickened Bruch's membrane by newly formed, thin-walled vessels derived from the choriocapillaris. These vessels grow into the subretinal space causing exudative detachment of the RPE and loss of photoreceptors (5.Polkinghorne P.J. Capon M.R. Berninger T. Lyness A.L. Sehmi K. Bird A.C.

Sorsby's fundus dystrophy tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase matrix metalloproteinase chorioallantoic membrane retinal pigment epithelium extracellular matrix phosphate-buffered saline concanavalin A membrane-type choroidal neovascularization conditioned medium TIMP-3 is a member of a family of endogenous matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors of which there are currently four members (TIMPs 1–4). By virtue of their MMP inhibitory activity, TIMP family members play a potentially important role in regulating matrix composition and thereby affect a wide range of physiological processes that include cell growth, invasion, migration, angiogenesis, transformation, and apoptosis. Structurally TIMPs have a two-domain structure with each domain folded into three loops held together by three disulfide bonds (13.Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 799-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain contains the highly conserved CXC motif that is responsible for MMP inhibition. The C-terminal domain confers specific functions such as binding to pro-MMPs and, in the case of TIMP-3, has been shown to be partly responsible for the ability to bind to the extracellular matrix (ECM) (14.Langton K.P. Barker M.D. McKie N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16778-16781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, more recently the ECM binding function has also been attributed to the N-terminal region (15.Yu W.H. Yu S. Meng Q. Brew K. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31226-31232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). With one recent exception, all mutations associated with SFD change residues in exon 5 (which encodes the C-terminal domain of the molecule) into cysteines. The exception involves a truncation that also results in an unpaired cysteine residue in the C-terminal domain (10.Langton K.P. McKie N. Curtis A. Goodship J.A. Bond P.M. Barker M.D. Clarke M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27027-27031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of these mutations in generating the SFD phenotype is unclear. To study the effects of these mutations in retinal pigment epithelium, we generated stable RPE cell lines expressing wild type or S156C (Ser156 changed to cysteine) mutant TIMP-3 and investigated the effects on RPE functions. ARPE-19 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in T75 flasks in filter medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 plus 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). All cultures of ARPE-19 grown on tissue culture plastic were fed weekly. Cultures were routinely passaged by dissociation with 0.05% (w/v) trypsin and 0.02% (w/v) EDTA, tetrasodium salt, followed by replating at a split ratio ranging from 1:3 to 1:6. Wild type (WT)-Timp-3 and S156C-Timp-3 inserts from human cDNA clones were fused in-frame with FLAG epitope DYKDDDK at their C-terminal end and cloned into expression vector pcDNA3.1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). ARPE-19 cell lines were transfected by lipofection (LipofectAMINE reagent, Invitrogen) and selected in medium containing neomycin (0.5 mg/ml). As a control, cells were transfected with the vector alone. Conditioned medium, lysate, and ECM samples were prepared as described previously (16.Pavloff N. Staskus P.W. Kishnani N.S. Hawkes S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17321-17326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of transfected genes was confirmed by Western blot analysis with a polyclonal antibody to TIMP-3 (a kind gift of Suneel Apte, Cleveland, OH) or monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2) antibody (Sigma). Cells were plated onto six-well culture plates (Costar). When confluent, the cells were removed from the culture dishes following a 15-min incubation in Ca2+-, Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5 mm EGTA and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After several rinses in PBS and water the ECM was scraped in a small volume of electrophoresis sample buffer without reducing agent. For protein estimations, ECM was scraped in PBS containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein concentrations were estimated using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Equal amounts of protein were loaded on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel with 1 mg/ml gelatin for zymography or a 12% gel with 1 mg/ml gelatin plus baby hamster kidney cell-conditioned medium as a source of MMPs for reverse zymography. Following electrophoresis, gels were processed as described previously (16.Pavloff N. Staskus P.W. Kishnani N.S. Hawkes S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17321-17326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, gels were agitated in a solution of 25 mg/ml Triton X-100 to remove SDS and to promote renaturation of proteases and inhibitors. The Triton was washed off with water, and the gels were then incubated for 16 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 0.2 mg/ml sodium azide at 37 °C. Gels were stained with 5 mg/ml Coomassie Blue R-250 in acetic acid/methanol/water (1:3:6) for 2 h and destained with acetic acid/methanol/water (1:3:6). Gelatinase activity was also determined using a gelatinase activity assay kit (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Human laminin (Collaborative Biomedical Inc., Bedford, MA) was immobilized on 96-well nontissue culture-treated plates. Wells were washed and incubated with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Subconfluent RPE cells were harvested, washed, resuspended in culture medium (1 × 105 cells/ml) and allowed to attach to the wells for 30 min at 37 °C. Nonadherent cells were removed by washing, and the attached cells were stained for 10 min with crystal violet. The wells were washed three times with PBS, and cell associated crystal violet was eluted by addition of 100 μl of 10% acetic acid. Cell adhesion was quantified by measuring the optical density of eluted crystal violet at a wavelength of 600 nm. A modified Boyden chamber assay was carried out as described previously (17.Anand-Apte B. Pepper M.S. Voest E. Montesano R. Olsen B. Murphy G. Apte S.S. Zetter B. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1997; 38: 817-823PubMed Google Scholar). 8.0-μm pore polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate membranes were precoated with collagen type I (100 μg/ml). For migration of RPE cell transfectants, laminin (5 μg/ml) or 10% fetal bovine serum was placed in the lower wells, and RPE cells (1.0 × 105) were placed in the upper wells. For endothelial cell chemotaxis, human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (Clonetics, San Diego, CA) (3.0 × 105) were placed in the upper wells and allowed to migrate toward conditioned medium placed in the lower wells. Chambers were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. Cells remaining on the top of the filter were removed. The bottom surface of the filter was fixed, stained, and mounted. The number of cells migrating per well was counted microscopically, and mean ± S.E. was calculated from quadruplicate samples. This assay was carried out as described previously (18.Banyard J. Anand-Apte B. Symons M. Zetter B.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 580-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Boyden chambers were used, and 8.0-μm polyvinylpyrrolidone-free filters were coated with matrigel or collagen type I gel (Collaborative Biomedical Inc.). The assay was carried out at 37 °C for 18–24 h, and filters were fixed, stained, and mounted. Invaded cells were counted under a microscope, and mean ± S.E. was calculated from quadruplicate samples. This assay was carried out as described previously (17.Anand-Apte B. Pepper M.S. Voest E. Montesano R. Olsen B. Murphy G. Apte S.S. Zetter B. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1997; 38: 817-823PubMed Google Scholar). Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells were incubated for 72 h in the presence of conditioned medium from RPE cell transfectants. Cells were trypsinized and counted using a Coulter particle counter. The CAM assay was performed as described previously (19.Nguyen M. Shing Y. Folkman J. Microvasc. Res. 1994; 47: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Fertilized 3-day-old White Leghorn eggs (Sunnyside Inc., Beaver Dam, WI) were cracked, and embryos with the yolk intact were placed in 100- × 20-mm glass bottom Petri dishes. After incubation for 3 days at 37 °C in 3% CO2, CAMs were implanted with 5-mm diameter sterilized gelatin sponges (Gelfoam, Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, MI) loaded with equal protein amounts of conditioned medium from RPE cell transfectants and photographed on day 3. CAMs implanted with sponges loaded with serum-free medium alone or with basic fibroblast growth factor or vascular endothelial growth factor were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Recombinant TIMP-3 (a kind gift of Gillian Murphy, University of East Anglia, United Kingdom) was added to some pellets. Samples were always compared on the same CAM to avoid egg to egg variability. Responses were graded as >, =, or < by independent readers. To mimic the RPE cells in SFD, we generated stable human RPE cell lines expressing WT or mutant (S156C)Timp-3. The stable expression of protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis using polyclonal antibodies to TIMP-3 (Fig. 1a) and was quantified by scanning densitometry (Fig. 1b). Like the endogenous TIMP-3 in RPE cells, both wild type and mutant forms of TIMP-3 were expressed predominantly in the ECM (Fig. 1, a and b) with a small fraction being secreted into the conditioned medium (Fig. 1,c and d). Wild type and mutant TIMP-3 proteins were expressed at levels 3–5-fold over that of endogenous TIMP-3 present in ARPE-19 cells. Antibodies to the FLAG epitope also confirmed the expression of these proteins in the ECM (Fig. 1e). MMP inhibitory activity in the ECM of these cell lines was analyzed by reverse zymography (Fig. 1f) and quantified by scanning densitometry (Fig. 1, g and h). Mock-transfected RPE cells (pcDNA3.1 alone) expressed endogenous functional TIMP-3 inhibitor in the ECM with an approximate molecular mass of 24 kDa corresponding to the protein seen on Western blots (Fig. 1a) as well as the 27 kDa glycosylated form (Fig. 1f). This inhibitory activity was increased in cells that were transfected with the wild type Timp-3 construct. The glycosylated as well as the nonglycosylated forms of mutant (S156C) TIMP-3 in the ECM demonstrated reduced MMP inhibitory activity when compared with WT-TIMP-3 (Fig. 1, g and h). We hypothesized that a reduction in TIMP activity in the ECM of RPE cells expressing mutant TIMP-3 may affect the protease activity secreted by these cells. Gelatin zymograms were used to test the gelatinase activity in the conditioned medium, lysates, and ECM of the transfected RPE cells. Endogenous 72-kDa gelatinase (pro-MMP-2) activity was observed in the conditioned medium of mock-transfected RPE cells (Fig. 2a). Densitometric quantitation (data not shown) determined a marked increase in the expression of this activity in the conditioned medium (60.4%) (Fig. 2a), cell lysates (57.2%) (Fig. 2c), and ECM (72%) (Fig. 2e) of cells expressing S156C mutant TIMP-3. Like other MMPs, gelatinase A is secreted as an inactive proenzyme, and its cell-mediated activation requires binding of the C-terminal domain of the proenzyme to a membrane-associated complex of the membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase MT1-MMP and TIMP-2. Subsequent sequential proteolysis of the propeptide by MT1-MMP and gelatinase A is believed to generate the active form of gelatinase A, and this process can be regulated by TIMP-2 or TIMP-3 (20.Will H. Atkinson S.J. Butler G.S. Smith B. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17119-17123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Concanavalin A (ConA) can induce clustering of MT1-MMP, which plays a role in the activation of MMP-2 in other systems (21.Yu M. Sato H. Seiki M. Thompson E.W. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3272-3277PubMed Google Scholar). To study the potential role of mutant TIMP-3 in this process, RPE cells were treated with ConA, and the gelatinase activity in the conditioned medium (Fig. 2b) and cell lysate/ECM (Fig. 2d) fractions were examined by gelatin zymograms. RPE cells expressing mutant TIMP-3 showed an induction of the active forms in the conditioned medium (62 and 43 kDa) and lysate/ECM (62 kDa) (Fig. 2, b and d, respectively). MMP-9 activity was observed only in the conditioned medium of cells expressing mutant TIMP-3 (Fig. 2, a andb). Active MMP-2 in the conditioned medium of these cells was also quantitated with a gelatinase activity assay utilizing a biotinylated gelatinase substrate. This assay (Table I) confirmed an increase in the gelatinase activity in the conditioned medium of RPE cells expressing S156C TIMP-3 in the absence or presence of ConA.Table ISecretion of active MMP-2 by transfected ARPE-19 cellsRPE cellsUntreatedConAng/ml MMP-2Vector18.5 ± 1.340.1 ± 2.91-ap < 0.01versus untreated.WT-TIMP-317.7 ± 0.539.9 ± 3.01-ap < 0.01versus untreated.S156C TIMP-322.3 ± 0.51-bp < 0.01 versuswild type.1-cp < 0.05 versusmock.53.4 ± 3.61-ap < 0.01versus untreated.1-bp < 0.01 versuswild type.1-cp < 0.05 versusmock.1-a p < 0.01versus untreated.1-b p < 0.01 versuswild type.1-c p < 0.05 versusmock. Open table in a new tab Thus, in terms of MMP activity, expression of S156C TIMP-3 in RPE cells induced an increase in both pro-MMP-2 and active MMP-2 in the conditioned medium, lysate, and ECM of the cells possibly as a result of attenuated MMP inhibitory activity of the expressed mutant TIMP-3 protein. Since there is no decrease in the expression of MMP-2 in cells overexpressing WT-TIMP-3, the possibility that the increase in MMP-2 activity in the cells expressing mutant TIMP-3 may be a direct induction or activation of gelatinase A by the mutant TIMP-3 protein cannot be ruled out. Quiescent RPE cells rest on the inner aspect of Bruch's membrane, which contains collagen type IV and laminin. MMPs play a key role in the regulation of a variety of cellular functions. The adhesion of RPE cells to ECM and the migratory and invasive properties of the cell are critical for the maintenance of their physiological phenotype. RPE cell attachment was measured on laminin (Fig. 3a). Overexpression of WT-TIMP-3 had no effect on the adhesion of RPE cells to laminin relative to the mock-transfected cells. However, expression of S156C TIMP-3 resulted in a small but statistically significant decrease in adhesion to laminin (Fig. 3a). Migration of S156C TIMP-3-expressing RPE cells toward laminin (Fig. 3b) as well as 10% fetal bovine serum (Fig. 3c) was significantly increased. Invasive capability of RPE cells through matrigel and collagen type I matrix revealed an increase in the invasive potential of RPE cells expressing S156C TIMP-3 (Fig. 3, d ande, respectively). Overexpression of WT-TIMP-3 resulted in a slight decrease in invasion through both matrigel and the collagen matrix. Thus, expression of S156C TIMP-3 in the RPE resulted in attenuated adhesion to ECM with a concomitant increase in the migratory and invasive potential. Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a major complication of Sorsby's fundus dystrophy. RPE cells are believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of CNV (22.D'Amore P.A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 3974-3979PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Campochiaro P.A. Mol. Vis. 1999; 5: 24PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Campochiaro P.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the angiogenic potential of RPE cells expressing the S156C TIMP-3 mutation. We first examined the ability of the conditioned medium of RPE cells to induce migration and proliferation of endothelial cells. Conditioned medium from RPE cells expressing S156C TIMP-3 increased the migration of microvascular endothelial cells when compared with mock-transfected as well as WT-TIMP-3-expressing RPE cells (Fig. 4a) but had no effect on their proliferation (Fig. 4b). We also evaluated the effects of the conditioned medium on angiogenesis using the CAM assay. Interestingly conditioned medium from cells expressing S156C TIMP-3 showed an increase in the neovascularization response compared with that induced by WT-TIMP-3 (in 89% of the CAMs tested,n = 18) and control transfected cells (in 65% of the CAMs tested, n = 17) (Fig. 4, c,d, and e). Addition of recombinant human TIMP-3 to the S156C TIMP-3-conditioned medium inhibited the angiogenic response (Fig. 4f). These results are consistent with the data obtained from the migration experiments and suggest that the SFD mutant (S156C TIMP-3) induces a proangiogenic phenotype in RPE cells. The RPE is believed to play a modulating role in the maintenance of a vascularized and highly permeable fenestrated choriocapillaris on its outer basal side. In vivo studies as well as clinical observations have determined that the absence of RPE can lead to secondary atrophy of the choriocapillaris (25.Korte G.E. Gerszberg T. Pua F. Henkind P. Acta Anat. (Basel). 1986; 127: 171-175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Sakamoto T. Sakamoto H. Hinton D.R. Spee C. Ishibashi T. Ryan S.J. Curr.

Ophthalmol. 1995; 113: 512-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Polarized secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor by the RPE toward the basal surface where its receptor KDR (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2) is localized on the inner choriocapillaris suggests a possible mechanism for trophic paracrine signaling between RPE and choriocapillaris (28.Blaauwgeers H.G. Holtkamp G.M. Rutten H. Witmer A.N. Koolwijk P. Partanen T.A. Alitalo K. Kroon M.E. Kijlstra A. van Hinsbergh V.W. Schlingemann R.O. Am. J.

CNV is an important pathological feature of eye diseases such as Sorsby's fundus dystrophy and the more common age-related macular degeneration. During the course of CNV, encapsulation of growing vessels by RPE coincides with the stasis of further vascular growth (29.Miller H. Miller B. Ryan S.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1986; 27: 1644-1652PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the RPE might play a critical role in controlling the initiation and progression of CNV. A precise spatial and temporal regulation of extracellular proteolysis is required for neovascularization. Recent studies have indicated that members of the MMP family play an important role in angiogenesis (30.Hiraoka N. Allen E. Apel I.J. Gyetko M.R. Weiss S.J.

Mice deficient in MMP-2 and MMP-9 exhibit reduced angiogenesis in vivo (34.Itoh T. Tanioka M. Yoshida H. Yoshioka T. Nishimoto H. Itohara S. Hofman P. van Blijswijk B.C. Gaillard P.J. Vrensen G.F.

MMP-2 is the most widely distributed MMP and is localized on the surface of angiogenic blood vessels (36.Brooks P.C. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). TIMP-3, a regulator of MMPs, is deposited by RPE cells into Bruch's membrane where it is a component of ECM (8.Kamei M. Hollyfield J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 2367-2375PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Fariss R.N. Apte S.S. Olsen B.R. Iwata K. Milam A.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 323-328PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that TIMP-3 is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis (17.Anand-Apte B. Pepper M.S. Voest E. Montesano R. Olsen B. Murphy G. Apte S.S. Zetter B. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1997; 38: 817-823PubMed Google Scholar). Since CNV is a prominent feature of SFD, with accumulation of TIMP-3 deposits in Bruch's membrane (7.Fariss R.N. Apte S.S. Luthert P.J. Bird A.C. Milam A.H. Br. J. Ophthalmol. 1998; 82: 1329-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we proposed to examine the mechanisms by which mutations in the TIMP-3 gene lead to the characteristic ocular phenotype (38.Fata J.E.

Gowing K.L. Poole A.R. Wakeham A. Mak T.W. Khokha R. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 817-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Expression of S156C TIMP-3 in human RPE cells results in a reduction of MMP inhibitory (TIMP) activity in the ECM. Recombinant S156C TIMP-3 generated in NSO myeloma cells has association rate constants for a range of MMPs that are 2–3-fold reduced compared with wild type TIMP-3 (40.Yeow K.M. Kishnani N.S. Hutton M. Hawkes S.P. Murphy G. Edwards D.R. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the decrease in TIMP activity in RPE cells is in contrast to that reported previously with expression in COS-7 and baby hamster kidney cells (10.Langton K.P. McKie N. Curtis A. Goodship J.A. Bond P.M. Barker M.D. Clarke M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27027-27031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Yeow K.M. Kishnani N.S. Hutton M. Hawkes S.P. Murphy G. Edwards D.R. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In both of these cell types, high levels of expression of mutant TIMP-3 protein gives rise to dimers, which are not present in our study with RPE cells. We expressed protein at relatively low levels in cells that expressed endogenous wild type protein to mimic the heterozygous autosomal dominant phenotype. That TIMP-3 functions may be cell type-specific has been recently suggested with the observation that TIMP-3 may have antiapoptotic activity and is a critical survival factor during mammary gland involution (38.Fata J.E. Leco K.J. Voura E.B. Yu H.Y. Waterhouse P. Murphy G. Moorehead R.A. Khokha R. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to several reports that demonstrate that high levels of TIMP-3 are proapoptotic in both normal and cancer cell lines (41.Baker A.H. George S.J. Zaltsman A.B. Murphy G. Newby A.C.

Newby A.C. Baker A.H. Circulation. 2000; 101: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In our studies with RPE cells, overexpression of TIMP-3 at modest levels does not affect cell survival (data not shown). Thus the divergent effects of TIMP-3 on cell survival as well as its other potential functions may depend on the cell type, microenvironment, and amount of TIMP-3 in the microenvironment (38.Fata J.E. Leco K.J. Voura E.B. Yu H.Y. Waterhouse P. Murphy G. Moorehead R.A. Khokha R. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This might also explain the exclusive ocular phenotype seen in patients with the SFD mutation. Constitutive activation of gelatinase A was observed in the conditioned medium and ECM of RPE cells expressing S156C TIMP-3. This was not surprising given the finding that SFD mutant TIMP-3 was an inefficient MMP inhibitor. Unscheduled MMP-2 activation was also observed in the lungs and mammary glands of homozygous Timp-3-null mice (38.Fata J.E. Leco K.J. Voura E.B. Yu H.Y. Waterhouse P. Murphy G. Moorehead R.A. Khokha R. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 39.Leco K.J. Waterhouse P. Sanchez O.H. Gowing K.L. Poole A.R. Wakeham A. Mak T.W. Khokha R. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 817-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that, under normal physiological conditions, choroidal endothelial cells are maintained in a quiescent state because of an orchestrated balance between angiogenic inducers and inhibitors. WT-TIMP-3 deposited by RPE cells into Bruch's membrane efficiently inhibits neovascular invasion from the choriocapillaris by inhibiting MMP activity, resulting in an intact matrix, and/or binding directly to the surface of endothelial cells to inhibit endothelial cell responses. Our results suggest that, during pathological CNV as seen in SFD, expression of mutant TIMP-3 in RPE cells may result in an accentuation of MMP activity, which can contribute to an angiostimulatory phenotype. While it is clear that endothelial cell basement membrane degradation is critical for angiogenesis, very little is known about the basic mechanism responsible for this process. There are several possibilities. Intact matrix might provide a physical barrier that limits endothelial cell migration and invasion into the surrounding ECM. Breakdown of the basement membrane allows the endothelial cells to initiate the process of sprouting. Alternatively proteolysis of ECM may release sequestered angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor and/or basic fibroblast growth factor, which promote endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Finally a third possibility that has been recently proposed is the exposure of an angiogenic cryptic site upon proteolytic cleavage of ECM molecules such as collagen type IV (9.Xu J. Rodriguez D. Petitclerc E. Kim J.J. Hangai M. Yuen S.M. Davis G.E. Brooks P.C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1069-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In this study we show that the CNV phenotype seen in SFD may be a result of reduced MMP inhibitory activity with a concomitant increase in MMP-2 activity. This appears to provide the cells with the ability to induce angiogenesis as shown by both in vitro andin vivo assays. These results might explain the pathophysiological mechanism of CNV in SFD and suggest the potential use of MMP inhibitors locally in the subretinal space as a means of therapy.

Here, S1P stimulated proliferation of rat mesangial cells and phosphorylation of MAPKs at subconfluent cell density. Both effects were inhibited by pertussis toxin treatment. Mesangial cells expressed several S1P receptors of theendothelial differentiation gene family: EDG-1, -3, -5, and -8. Conversely, S1P induced apoptosis at low cell density (2 × 104cells/cm2), which was demonstrated by flow cytometry and Hoechst staining. Apoptosis was observed also in quiescent or growing cells and was not reverted by lysophosphatidic acid or platelet-derived growth factor. S1P enhanced phosphorylation of SAPKs. Incubation with [33P]S1P, [3H]S1P, and [3H]sphingosine demonstrated increased S1P hydrolysis, resulting in enhanced intracellular sphingosine levels and decreased S1P levels. A rise in total ceramide levels was also observed; however, ceramide did not originate from [3H]sphingosine, and S1P-induced apoptosis was not inhibited by fumonisin B, precluding involvement of de novo ceramide synthesis in apoptosis. Therefore, we suggest that sphingosine accumulation and decreased S1P are primarily responsible for S1P-induced apoptosis.

LPLs act through homologous G protein-coupled receptors of the endothelial differentiation gene (EDG) family, several members of which are known today. S1P preferentially activates EDG-1, -3, -5, -6, and -8, whereas LPA activates EDG-2, -4, and -7 (7.Lynch K.R. Im D.S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 473-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). LPLs promote cell growth by activating several EDG-evoked signaling pathways. Gi/o induces mitosis via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway; Gq mediates mobilization of intracellular calcium; and G12/13 activates Rho-related pathways. In addition, S1P may act as an intracellular second messenger (17.Spiegel S. Milstien S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 55-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). S1P activates multiple responses in various cells. For example, S1P induces migration of endothelial cells, and it is regarded, together with the expression of its receptor EDG-1, as a factor promoting angiogenesis (18.Liu Y. Wada R. Yamashita T. Mi Y. Deng C.X. Hobson J.P. Rosenfeldt H.M. Nava V.E. Chae S.S. Lee M.J. Liu C.H. Hla T. Spiegel S. Proia R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). S1P is also considered as a factor of cell survival. This is the case for both exogenous S1P (9.Spiegel S. Milstien S. Biochim. Biophys.

Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1573-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Contrary to this, cell proliferation is negatively influenced by other sphingolipids such as ceramides and sphingosine (24.Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E.

Thus, the balance between S1P and ceramide/sphingosine cellular levels is probably crucial to control the proliferation of mesangial cells (28.Sweeney E.A. Sakakura C. Shirahama T. Masamune A. Ohta H. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 66: 358-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 29.Sweeney E.A. Igarashi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We previously observed that the effect of S1P on mesangial cell proliferation is variable and depends upon the density of the cell culture (15.Gennero I. Simon M.F. Gaits F. Cariven C. Rogalle P. Fauvel J. Chap H. Salles J.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 905: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In the present study, we documented that an increased hydrolysis of S1P to sphingosine occurred in mesangial cells cultured at low cell density, leading to increased sphingosine and decreased S1P intracellular levels. This phenomenon, in association with the increased production of ceramide, seems a key factor in inducing the apoptosis of mesangial cells. To our knowledge, this is the first time that increased S1P hydrolysis as a mechanism leading to apoptosis has been observed in cells derived from a primary culture. It might also be relevant under pathophysiological conditions, where excessive mesangial cell proliferation is present. S1P, LPA, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; thiazolyl blue), collagenase, pertussis toxin, propidium iodide, and Hoechst 33342 were obtained from Sigma. RPMI 1640 medium with Glutamax I, trypsin, fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin, streptomycin, the SuperScript pre-amplification system, and TRIzol were from Invitrogen. RPMI 1640 medium with d-valine was purchased from BioMedia (Boussens, France).N-Hexanoyl[3-3H]sphingosine (C6-[3H]ceramide; 10–20 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [methyl-3H]Thymidine (25 Ci/mmol) and [γ-33P]ATP (2500 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Biosciences. Culture flasks and multiwells were from Falcon Plastic (Paisley, Scotland). Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P) was from Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA). Anti-phospho-Thr183/Thr185 ERK1/2 antibody, anti-phospho-SAPK antibody, and CDP star chemiluminescent reagent were from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). Anti-rabbit secondary antibody and the lactate dehydrogenase activity kit were from Promega (Madison, WI). Escherichia coli sn-1,2-diacylglycerol kinase,N-octanoyl-d-erythro-sphingosine (C8-ceramide) and N-palmitoyl-d-erythro-sphingosine (C16-ceramide) were from Calbiochem. Renal glomeruli were isolated from kidneys from 2-month-old male Wistar rats weighing 150–200 g. Most of the procedure was adapted from Striker and Striker (30.Striker G.E. Striker L.J. Lab. Invest. 1985; 53: 122-131PubMed Google Scholar) as previously described (31.Salles J.P. Gayral-Taminh M. Fauvel J. Delobbe I. Mignon-Conte M. Conte J.J. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12805-12811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the kidneys were removed from their capsule, and the cortex fragments (3–4 mm3) were submitted to four repeated enzymatic digestions with collagenase at 37 °C in PBS solution. The glomeruli purified by successive mechanical sieving were retained on the 100-, 80-, and 60-μm pore stainless steel sieves. Glomerular mesangial cells were obtained from glomerular preparations and cultured under standard conditions at 37 °C in a humidified 5% (v/v) CO2 incubator in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat inactivated FCS plus 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Passages of primary cultures were done after 3–4 weeks. To eliminate contamination by either epithelial or endothelial cells, the culture was performed in RPMI 1640 medium with d-valine until passage 5. Thereafter, experiments were performed between passages 5 and 20. Mesangial cells were characterized by their morphological appearance in phase contrast and their biological and biochemical properties as previously described (31.Salles J.P. Gayral-Taminh M. Fauvel J. Delobbe I. Mignon-Conte M. Conte J.J. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12805-12811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): 1) positive staining with antibodies against myosin or vimentin and negative staining with antibodies against factor VIII or cytokeratins by standard immunofluorescence; 2) ability to contract in response to 10−5m angiotensin; and 3) ability to grow in selective d-valine-containing medium. In all experiments, cells were made quiescent by serum starvation in RPMI 1640 medium with 0.5% (v/v) FCS for 48 h. When testing the effect of cell density, equivalent numbers of cells were seeded on variable culture areas. Consequently, for analysis, we used equal cell material originating from the cell at different densities. Cell density varied between 1 × 104 and 1.7 × 105cells/cm2 as indicated below and in the figure legends. Mesangial cells were seeded with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% (v/v) FCS in tissue culture dishes at different densities as indicated. After 24 h, the medium was changed for 48 h to RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.5% (v/v) FCS to make the cells quiescent. The agents to be tested were then added for 24 h. At this time, [3H]thymidine (0.5 μCi/ml) was added, and the incubation was continued for 4 h. Cells were washed with PBS, and the DNA was precipitated with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material was dissolved in 0.5m NaOH, and the radioactivity was measured with a liquid scintillation counter. Data from triplicate values are expressed as a percentage of the average control value. Cells were cultured as described above for thymidine incorporation, except that the agents to be tested were added for 36 h. Cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml MTT for 2 h at 37 °C. The medium was aspirated, the formazan crystals formed were dissolved in isopropyl alcohol with 60 mm HCl, and the absorbance at 570 nm was determined with a spectrophotometer (Beckman Instruments). Data from triplicate values are expressed as a percentage of the average control value. Mesangial cells were cultured at high (1 × 105 cells/cm2) or low (2 × 104 cells/cm2) cell density in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% (v/v) FCS. They were rendered quiescent by treatment in RPMI 1640 medium with 0.5% FCS for 48 h. 2 h before the stimulation, the medium was changed to RPMI 1640 medium alone. The cells were then stimulated, washed twice with PBS, and lysed with SDS sample buffer containing 62 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue. Homogenates were sonicated for 10 s, boiled for 5 min, clarified for 2 min at 13,000 rpm, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and then electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, incubated overnight with primary antibody (1:1000, v/v), washed twice, and finally incubated with anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:7500, v/v) for 30 min. Detection was performed with the CDP star chemiluminescent system. Total cellular RNA was extracted by the TRIzol method according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNAs encoding parts of the open reading frame of EDG receptors were amplified with the SuperScript pre-amplification system. The primers (MWG Biotech) used for cDNA PCR amplifications were as follows: for rat sequences: EDG-1 (5′-GCTATGGTGTCCTCCACCAG and 5′-CCGGTTTTAAGAAGAAGAATTGACG), EDG-2 (5′-TCATGGCAGCTGCCTCTACT and 5′-CCTTCTAAACCACAGAGTGGTCA), EDG-3 (5′-CATTGGCAACTTGGCTCTCT and 5′-ATCACTACGGTCCGCAGAAG), EDG-5 (5′-CCCCACCATGGGCG and 5′-ACATTTCCCCTCAGACCACTG), EDG-8 (5′-CGAGGTCATCGTCCTTCACT and 5′-GTTGGGAAGCGTCAGTCTGT), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (5′-ATGGTGAAGGTCGGTGTGAA and 5′-GGGCCCTCGGCCG); and for human sequence: EDG-6 (5′-ACATGCGGTCGCGACG and 5′-ATGCTCCGCACGCTGG). PCRs were performed for 30 cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 95 °C; annealing for 1 min at 58 °C for EDG-1 sequence, at 50 °C for EDG-2 sequence, and at 55 °C for the others; and elongation for 1 min at 72 °C. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis after staining with ethidium bromide. We precluded contamination with DNA by checking the absence of amplification of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from mRNA extracts not previously submitted to reverse transcription. Lactate dehydrogenase release from damaged cells was used to assess cytotoxicity. Quiescent mesangial cells were cultured in 12-well dishes and treated with the stimulus as indicated. Lactate dehydrogenase activity was determined in both the supernatant and cells according to the manufacturer's instructions as previously described (11.Gaits F. Salles J.P. Chap H. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1022-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Lactate dehydrogenase activity in the supernatant is expressed as percent of the total release (lactate dehydrogenase released from the supernatant and cells). Apoptotic cells were quantitatively evaluated by flow cytometry. Quiescent cells (5 × 105) were cultured at high or low density and treated with the agonist or vehicle. At the indicated times, both adherent and non-adherent cells were harvested, washed twice with PBS, and fixed in 70% cold ethanol. Briefly, cells were labeled with propidium iodide as described previously (32.Cui Z. Houweling M. Chen M.H. Record M. Chap H. Vance D.E. Terce F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14668-14671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and analyzed in a flow cytometer (Coulter ELITE). Intact cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 (5 μg/ml) and propidium iodide (10 μg/ml) for 10 min and analyzed in a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioskop) with excitation at 360 nm. Under these conditions, the Hoechst dye stained all nuclei, whereas propidium iodide stained the nuclei of only necrotic cells with disrupted plasma membranes. With Hoechst staining, viable cells were observed with intact nuclei, and apoptotic cells with fragmented or condensed nuclei. [33P]S1P was synthesized as described previously (33.Brindley D.N. Xu J. Jasinska R. Waggoner D.W. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The reaction uses the ability of E. coli diacylglycerol kinase to phosphorylate ceramides. C8-ceramide was solubilized in 5 mmcardiolipin, 7.5% octyl β-glucopyranoside, and 1 mmdiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid and resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm imidazole (pH 6.6), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.4 international units/ml diacylglycerol kinase. The reaction was started with 10 mm[γ-33P]ATP (25 Ci/mmol) overnight. C8-ceramide 1-[33P]phosphate was treated with 6 m HCl/butanol-1 (1:1, v/v) for 60 min at 100 °C to release [33P]S1P. This compound was purified by thin-layer chromatography using butanol-1/acetic acid/water (3:1:1, v/v). [33P]S1P migrated like S1P in the solvent system described above. [3H]S1P was synthesized from C6-[3H]ceramide using the same method with nonradioactive ATP. Quiescent cells were seeded, cultured at low or high density, and treated with 10 μm[33P]S1P (10 Ci/mol) in 0.1% (w/v) BSA. At the indicated times, 0.5 ml of the incubation medium was transferred into 0.5 ml of 1m HClO4 to precipitate proteins and the labeled lipid. The 33Pi present in the medium was measured as described previously (34.Jasinska R. Zhang Q.X. Pilquil C. Singh I. Xu J. Dewald J. Dillon D.A. Berthiaume L.G. Carman G.M. Waggoner D.W. Brindley D.N. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The radioactivity was counted in a scintillation counter. The initial rate was deduced from experimental data obtained between 0 and 10 min in the linear part of the activity curve. Activity is expressed as nanomoles of inorganic phosphate released per 106 cells. Mesangial cells were seeded, cultured at low or high density, and treated with the agonists or vehicle in RPMI 1640 medium plus 0.01% (w/v) BSA as indicated. Lipids were then extracted from the extracellular medium by the Bligh and Dyer method (35.Bligh E.D. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42865) Google Scholar). Lipids were extracted from cells as follows. Cells were washed twice with PBS and scraped in 0.75 ml of methanol. The plates were washed with an additional 0.75 ml of methanol, and 0.75 ml of chloroform was added to the pooled methanol extracts. The samples were stored overnight at −20 °C, and the precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation. S1P, sphingosine, and ceramides were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography with butanol-1/acetic acid/water (3:1:1, v/v) as solvent. Radioactivity was detected with an automatic TLC linear analyzer (Bertold, Wildbad, Germany). Spots corresponding to the different lipids were scraped, and the radioactivity was counted in a scintillation counter. A control incubation with radiolabeled substrates without cells demonstrated that ∼5% of the compounds remained bound to the plate, with no clear time dependence. This value was considered as the zero value and was subtracted from all experimental data. The cellular ceramide level was measured according to a method described previously (36.Preiss J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Quiescent cells were seeded, cultured at low or high density, and treated with S1P as indicated. Cells were washed twice with PBS and scraped in 2 ml of PBS. Lipids were extracted according to the Bligh and Dyer method (35.Bligh E.D. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42865) Google Scholar). Samples from the lower chloroform phase were dried and incubated with 0.08 n NaOH in chloroform/methanol (2:0.5, v/v) at 37 °C for 30 min for alkaline hydrolysis of diacylglycerol. The reaction was stopped by lipid extraction, and ceramide was converted to ceramide 1-[33P]phosphate by E. colidiacylglycerol kinase in the presence of [γ-33P]ATP (25 Ci/mmol) as described above, except that the reaction was carried out for 30 min with 1 IU/ml diacylglycerol kinase. The labeled lipids were extracted by the Bligh and Dyer method (35.Bligh E.D. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42865) Google Scholar) and separated by thin-layer chromatography in chloroform/methanol/acetone/acetic acid/water (10:2:4:2:1,v/v). The RF value for ceramide phosphate was 0.20 in this system. Radioactivity was measured with a PhosphorImager 445 SI (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Spots corresponding to ceramide phosphate were scraped, and the radioactivity was counted in a scintillation counter. Addition of C16-ceramide to the initial medium as a control testified for ∼70% recovery during the overall procedure. This rate of recovery was taken into account to estimate the quantity of ceramide initially present in the assay medium. Results (expressed as means ± S.E.) are representative of at least three experiments as indicated in the figure legends. Comparisons were done using Student's t test. Results were considered to be significant when p < 0.05. Although S1P acts as a mitogen toward diverse cell types, few reports have described an antiproliferative effect on cells derived from a primary culture (37.Moore A.N. Kampfl A.W. Zhao X. Hayes R.L. Dash P.K. Neuroscience. 1999; 94: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 38.Davaille J. Gallois C. Habib A. Li L. Mallat A. Tao J. Levade T. Lotersztajn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34628-34633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In a preliminary study, we observed that S1P exerts opposite effects on the proliferation rate of mesangial cells, depending upon the density of the cell culture (15.Gennero I. Simon M.F. Gaits F. Cariven C. Rogalle P. Fauvel J. Chap H. Salles J.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 905: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Therefore, our first aim was to assess precisely the effect of cell density on mesangial cell proliferation. We tested a range of cell densities varying between 1 × 104 and 1.7 × 105 cells/cm2 (Fig. 1). The effect of S1P on [3H]thymidine incorporation strongly depended upon the cell density, whereas under the same conditions, PDGF was constantly proliferative (data not shown). At subconfluent cell density, 10 μm S1P increased DNA synthesis by up to 6-fold. The effect of 10 μm S1P or 10 μm LPA tested under the same conditions was similar (Fig. 2C). Above 1.5 × 105 cells/cm2, the decrease in DNA synthesis was interpreted logically as a confluence-dependent inhibition of cell growth. When decreasing the cell density, the effect of S1P progressively reverted toward an unexpected antiproliferative one at the lowest densities. Because of these first results, we tested the effect of cell density more extensively. In the following experiments, low density corresponded to distinct cells with rare membrane contacts (1–2 × 104 cells/mm2), and high density corresponded to subconfluent cells (1–1.2 × 105cells/mm2).Figure 2Effects of S1P on mesangial cell proliferation at high cell density.A and B, various concentrations of S1P were tested on quiescent cells cultured at high cell density (1 × 105cells/cm2). In A, cells were tested for [3H]thymidine incorporation. Quiescent cells were incubated for 24 h with S1P or vehicle (0.01% (w/v) BSA in PBS). Cells were then incubated with [3H]thymidine for 4 h. In B, cells were tested with the MTT technique.C, [3H]thymidine incorporation was evaluated in quiescent cells treated with 10 μm S1P or 10 μm LPA, with or without pretreatment with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin (PTX) for 16 h. In A–C, results are means ± S.E. from triplicate determinations, representative of three independent experiments. The absolute value for [3H]thymidine incorporation in control cells was 50,000 cpm ± 20%. *, p < 0.05; ∗∗, p< 0.01. D, quiescent cells were stimulated with 10 μm S1P for various periods of time (5–120 min) (upper panel) or for 10 and 120 min with or without pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml) pretreatment for 16 h (lower panel). C indicates the control without S1P. MAPK phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blotting with an antibody against the phosphorylated fraction of the protein. Results are representative of two independent experiments. E, shown is the expression of EDG receptors in mesangial cells. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of EDG-1, -2, -3, -5, and -8 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression was carried out with RNA isolated from rat mesangial cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) At high cell density (1 × 105 cells/cm2), the treatment of mesangial cells with S1P increased DNA synthesis as demonstrated by [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 2A). Dose dependence was demonstrated by a significant difference between the effect of 1 and 10 μm S1P (p < 0.05). The proliferative effect of S1P was confirmed by the MTT technique. Fig. 2B shows a 2.5-fold increase with 10 μm S1P, with a 3-fold increase being induced by 10 μm LPA as a positive control. Pretreatment of mesangial cells with pertussis toxin almost completely inhibited the S1P-induced mitogenic response, as it did for 10 μm LPA (Fig. 2C), suggesting the involvement of a Gi-coupled pathway for the proliferative response to S1P. Phosphorylation of p42 and p44 MAPKs (ERK1/2) showed a two-wave phosphorylation profile induced by 10 μm S1P that persisted for >2 h, as tested by Western blot analysis using anti-phospho-p42/44 antibody (Fig. 2D). This is in agreement with the results of the thymidine incorporation assay. In addition, activation of ERK1/2 was partly inhibited by pertussis toxin treatment (Fig. 2D). Extracellular S1P is known to act through receptors of the EDG family. mRNA expression of EDG receptors by mesangial cells was examined using reverse transcription-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2E, most of the identified receptors for S1P were well expressed by mesangial cells, i.e. EDG-1, -3, -5, and -8, with EDG-1, -3, and -5 being expressed the most. As the sequence of the rat EDG-6 receptor was unknown, we amplified it using primers for human EDG-6. We could amplify a homologous form of human EDG-6 from genomic rat DNA. However, we were unable to amplify EDG-6 from either rat or human mesangial cell mRNAs. Altogether, these results suggest that mesangial cells do not express EDG-6. The ubiquitous LPA receptor EDG-2 was also well expressed by mesangial cells. As mentioned above, S1P inhibited the proliferation of rat mesangial cells at the lowest cell densities (1–2 × 104 cells/cm2) (Fig. 1). Th"
https://openalex.org/W2067342223,"We previously demonstrated that dendritic cell (DC) pulsing with antigen-encoded mRNA resulted in the loading of both major histocompatibility complex class I and II antigen presentation pathways and the delivery of an activation signal. Coculture of mRNA-pulsed DC with T cells led to the induction of a potent primary immune response. DC, in addition to recognizing foreign antigens through pattern recognition receptors, also must respond to altered self, transformed, or intracellularly infected cells. This occurs through cell surface receptors that recognize products of inflammation and cell death. In this report, we characterize two signaling pathways utilized by extracellular mRNA to activate DC. In addition, a novel ligand, poly(A), is identified that mediates signaling through a receptor that can be inhibited by pertussis toxin and suramin and can be desensitized by ATP and ADP, suggesting a P2Y type nucleotide receptor. The role of this signaling activity in vaccine design and the potential effect of mRNA released by damaged cells in the induction of immune responsiveness is discussed.

The role of this signaling activity in vaccine design and the potential effect of mRNA released by damaged cells in the induction of immune responsiveness is discussed. dendritic cell(s) T regulatory lipopolysaccharide double-stranded RNA, CD40L, CD40 ligand G-protein-coupled receptor single-stranded DNA phycoerythrin fluorescein isothiocyanate Toll-like receptor peripheral blood mononuclear cells creatine phosphokinase creatine phosphate major histocompatibility complex interleukin-12 interferon α tumor necrosis factor α fetal calf serum human immunodeficiency virus prostaglandin E2 regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 2-(methylthio)adenosine 5′-triphosphate 2-(methylthio)adenosine 5′-diphosphate Dendritic cells (DC)1are the sentinel cells of the adaptive immune system and function in the induction of primary and memory T cell immune responses (1.Steinman R.M.

They mainly populate tissues that interface with the environment and acquire antigens through high level constitutive macropinocytosis and endocytosis (3.Lanzavecchia A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 348-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Immature tissue DC sense invading organisms by recognizing evolutionarily conserved structures, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns, contained within microbial lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acid. This pattern recognition occurs through a set of germ-line encoded receptors, which are exemplified by the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family (4.Imler J.L. Hoffmann J.A. Rev. Immunogenet. 2000; 2: 294-304PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Pulendran B. Palucka K. Banchereau J. Science. 2001; 293: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 6.Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (3958) Google Scholar). Immature DC, upon receiving an activation signal, undergo phenotypical and functional changes, including: 1) decreased antigen acquisition with a coordinated increase in presentation of MHC-peptide complexes on the cell surface; 2) increased stability of MHC class II-peptide complexes; 3) increased expression of surface molecules that aid and promote T cell activation (7.Lanzavecchia A. Sallusto F. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar); 4) a changed pattern of release of chemokines and cytokines leading to attraction of T cells, promotion of T cell activation, and direction of their ultimate phenotype (Th0, Th1, Th2, or T regulatory (Treg)) (5.Pulendran B. Palucka K. Banchereau J. Science. 2001; 293: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 8.Liu Y.J. Kanzler H. Soumelis V. Gilliet M. Nat.

Des. 2001; 7: 977-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); and 5) a shift in the repertoire of chemokine receptor expression that allows and directs DC migration to lymphoid organs (10.Sallusto F. Lanzavecchia A. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 177: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 11.Allavena P. Sica A. Vecchi A. Locati M. Sozzani S. Mantovani A. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 177: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Identified categories of DC activators include: 1) conserved constituents of bacteria (lipopolysaccharide (LPS), cell wall lipoproteins, flagellar proteins, and DNA), 2) host cell-derived molecules released during cell injury and death (proinflammatory cytokines and nucleotides), 3) intermediates of viral replication (double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)) (12.Cella M. Salio M. Sakakibara Y. Langen H. Julkunen I. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), and 4) molecules on activated CD4+ T cells (CD40 ligand (CD40L)). The signaling by each DC activator leads to the transformation of a DC from antigen acquisition to antigen presentation but produces a DC that differs in the type of immune response it induces (13.Re F. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37692-37699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). DCs treated with TNF-α, a pleiotropic stimulus of DC activation, and prostaglandin E produce a low level of IL-12 and induce a mixed population of Th0 and Th1 T cells. DCs exposed to dsRNA secrete high levels of IL-12 and IFN-α leading to a strong Th1 response. DCs exposed to apoptotic cells or malaria-infected red blood cells do not secrete IL-12 but produce IL-10 (14.Urban B.C. Ferguson D.J. Pain A. Willcox N. Plebanski M. Austyn J.M. Roberts D.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 15.Urban B.C. Willcox N. Roberts D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8750-8755Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) leading to the induction of Treg cells (16.Ito T. Amakawa R. Inaba M. Ikehara S. Inaba K. Fukuhara S. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2961-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Nucleotide receptors are comprised of two families, a metabotropic family (P2Y) that belong to the 7-transmembrane, G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, and a pore-forming, cation-selective family (P2X). Human DCs express mRNA for P2Y1, -2, -4, -6, -11 and P2X1, -2, -4, -5, -7 nucleotide receptors (17.Berchtold S. Ogilvie A.L. Bogdan C. Muhl-Zurbes P. Ogilvie A. Schuler G. Steinkasserer A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Signaling through both families by selected nucleotides induces different aspects of DC activation. ATP, which can be released by damaged cells and has been demonstrated to synergize with TNF-α in the activation of DCs (18.Schnurr M. Then F. Galambos P. Scholz C. Siegmund B. Endres S. Eigler A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4704-4709Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar,19.Wilkin F. Duhant X. Bruyns C. Suarez-Huerta N. Boeynaems J.M. Robaye B. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7172-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), acts through P2Y11 receptor signaling. This signaling pathway leads to the generation of cAMP (19.Wilkin F. Duhant X. Bruyns C. Suarez-Huerta N. Boeynaems J.M. Robaye B. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7172-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The P2X7 receptor is important in cytokine secretion in human DC (20.Ferrari D. La Sala A. Chiozzi P. Morelli A. Falzoni S. Girolomoni G. Idzko M. Dichmann S. Norgauer J. Di Virgilio F. FASEB. J. 2000; 14: 2466-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and antigen presentation in murine DC (21.Mutini C. Falzoni S. Ferrari D. Chiozzi P. Morelli A. Baricordi O.R. Collo G. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Di Virgilio F. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1958-1965PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to DC activation, it has also been observed that signaling through nucleotide receptors by ATP leads to DC apoptosis (22.Coutinho-Silva R. Perfettini J.L. Persechini P.M. Dautry-Varsat A. Ojcius D.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 280: C81-C89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and aberrant DC activation. DC pretreated with low, non-toxic doses of ATP, produced lower amounts of IL-1α, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-12 after subsequent stimulation with LPS or CD40L (23.la Sala A. Ferrari D. Corinti S. Cavani A. Di Virgilio F. Girolomoni G. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1611-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The targeting of DC for antigen delivery in vivo and in vitro represents an important approach in vaccine research. The first step in immune responsiveness induced by vaccines is the delivery of antigen in a form that the DC can acquire, process, and present to CD4+ T, CD8+ T, and/or B cells. With this delivery of antigen, the vaccine also must deliver an activation signal to the DC. This is often done by the inclusion of adjuvants, such as mycobacterium to complete Freund's adjuvant, or with components of the antigen delivery system, such as CpG motifs in DNA vaccines (reviewed in Ref. 24.Leitner W.W. Ying H. Restifo N.P. Vaccine. 1999; 18: 765-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). We previously reported that pulsing DC with mRNA encoding antigen led to loading of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell antigen presentation pathways, delivery of an activation signal to DC, and the induction of potent antigen-specific T cell activation (25.Weissman D. Ni H. Scales D. Dude A. Capodici J. McGibney K. Abdool A. Isaacs S.N. Cannon G. Kariko K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4710-4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In this report, we determined the mechanisms whereby mRNA activates DC. Transcription was performed on Gag- and luciferase-encoding plasmid templates linearized downstream from a stretch of dA50 using the T7 message machine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) as described previously (25.Weissman D. Ni H. Scales D. Dude A. Capodici J. McGibney K. Abdool A. Isaacs S.N. Cannon G. Kariko K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4710-4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Purification of the transcripts was performed by DNase I digestion followed by LiCl precipitation and 70% EtOH washing. Additional poly(A) tail was added to the transcripts with yeast poly(A) polymerase (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Piscataway, NJ), and the mRNA was again purified. All Gag- or luciferase-encoding mRNA contained a poly(A) tail unless otherwise noted. Assays for LPS in RNA preparations using the Lumilus Amebocyte Lysate gel clot assay were negative with a sensitivity of 3 pg/ml (University of Pennsylvania, Department of Genetics, Cell Center Service Facility). The quality of each batch of mRNA was tested by agarose gel electrophoresis for degradation. Samples were stored in siliconized tubes at −20 °C until use. HL60, U937, and 293T cells (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and P2Y11 nucleotide receptor stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary and 1231N1 cells (26.Communi D. Govaerts C. Parmentier M. Boeynaems J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31969-31973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with glutamine (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD) and 10% FCS (HyClone, Ogden, UT). Leukapheresis samples were obtained from HIV-uninfected volunteers through an institutional review board-approved protocol. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were purified by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient purification. PBMC were cryopreserved in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) with 50% FCS and 10% Me2SO (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). DCs were produced as described previously with minor modifications (25.Weissman D. Ni H. Scales D. Dude A. Capodici J. McGibney K. Abdool A. Isaacs S.N. Cannon G. Kariko K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4710-4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Monocytes were obtained by the RosetteSep method (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) from leukapheresis samples (containing red blood cells) as described by the manufacturer. Monocytes were cultured in AIM V serum-free medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with granulocyte macrophage/colony-stimulating factor (50 ng/ml) and IL-4 (100 ng/ml) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Fresh medium containing cytokines was added on days 2 and 5. The resulting immature DCs were used between 6 and 9 days after initial culture of monocytes. DCs were treated with TNF-α (1 ng/ml) (R&D Systems) + PGE3 (500 nm) (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI), LPS (1.0–10 μg/ml) (Sigma), CD40L trimer (a kind gift of Elaine Thomas, Immunex, Seattle, WA), poly(A) and poly(U) single-stranded (ss) RNA, poly(I)·poly(C) dsRNA (20 μg/ml) (Sigma), Gag- or luciferase-encoding mRNA (0.22 μg/50 μl) complexed with Lipofectin (Invitrogen) (27.Kariko K. Kuo A. Barnathan E.S. Langer D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1369: 320-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or Lipofectin without nucleic acid. Higher concentrations of LPS were required for DC maturation, because no serum was present in the cultures, thus LPS bound and activated DC in the absence of serum-derived LPS-binding protein. Similar activation profiles were observed for LPS when exogenous serum was added. 293T cells were transiently transfected with a cytomegalovirus-driven P2Y4 expression plasmid (28.Communi D. Motte S. Boeynaems J.M. Pirotton S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 317: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) complexed to Lipofectin in the same manner as RNA. After 24 h, cells, or control transfected 293T cells, were analyzed for the ability to flux Ca2+ in response to poly(A) or UTP (Sigma). Ca2+ flux was determined by measuring fluorescence spectral changes of Fura-2 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The excitation wavelengths were 340 and 380 nm, and the measured emission wavelength was 510 nm. All experiments were performed at 37 °C using a Photon Technology International fluorescence spectrophotometer (London, Ontario, Canada) equipped with a magnetic stirrer. Cells were loaded with Fura-2AM for 1 h at 37 °C in RPMI 10% FCS followed by washing. One and one-half million Fura-2 loaded cells in 1 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution with Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Invitrogen) were added to a cuvette and analyzed to establish a baseline followed by addition of stimuli. Data are presented as the ratio of emissions at 510 nm. Certain cells were treated with pertussis toxin (30 μg/ml) (Sigma) 5 h before signaling or suramin (30 μm) or EGTA (200 μm) (Sigma) 10 min before signaling. Cells were stimulated with ATP (1–100 μm), 2MeSATP (1–5 μm), ADP (5–100 μm), UTP (20–100 μm), poly(A) (1–67 μm AMP equivalents), poly(U), poly(C), poly(G), poly(A,C), poly(A,G), poly(A,U) (67 μm AMP equivalents) (Sigma), Gag-encoding mRNA with or without a poly(A) tail (30 μg added to 1.5 ml cells) or RANTES (BD PharMingen, San Jose, CA) (33 ng/ml), and the calcium flux was monitored for up to 600 s at 1-s intervals. In certain experiments, ATP and 2MeSATP (1 mm) were treated for 90 min with creatine phosphokinase (CPK) (20 units/ml) and creatine phosphate (CP) (10 mm) (Sigma) to convert contaminating ADP and 2MeSADP to ATP and 2MeSATP, respectively (29.Communi D. Suarez Gonzalez N. Detheux M. Brezillon S. Lannoy V. Parmentier M. Boeynaems J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41479-41485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Desensitization was measured by adding the second or third stimulus when the calcium flux subsided and the baseline was re-established. DC were stained for the following markers with directly conjugated antibodies: CD83-phycoerythrin (PE) or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), CD80-PE (Research Diagnostics Inc., Flanders, NJ), HLA-DR-FITC, HLA-A, B,C-FITC, CD25-FITC, CCR5-FITC, CXCR4-PE, CD86-Cy-Chrome, CCR6-PE (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA) and analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD PharMingen) flow cytometer. Endocytosis/macropinocytosis was measured by incubating DCs with FITC-labeled bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C followed by washing and analysis. For studies of T cell activation, immature or activated DC were washed to remove the activating agent and cultured with autologous CD4+ T cells purified by negative selection (Human CD4+ T Cell Enrichment Column, R&D Systems) from cryopreserved PBMC at a ratio of 1 DC to 10 T cells and staphylococcal toxic shock surperantigen (Sigma) (0.01 ng/ml). One hour later, brefeldin A (20 μg/ml) (Sigma) was added. Five hours later, cells were stained with CD4-APC (BD PharMingen), permeabilized, and stained with CD69-Peridinin chlorophyll, IFN-γ-FITC, and IL-4-PE (BD PharMingen) as described previously (30.Scales D. Ni H. Shaheen F. Capodici J. Cannon G. Weissman D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6437-6443Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer, 500,000 events per sample. 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (5 μm)-treated (30 min) DCs were activated for 30 min and lysed for cAMP quantitation. cAMP level was measured by competitive chemiluminescence assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as per manufacturer's instructions. Supernatants of activated DC were collected at 48 h for cytokine measurement. IL-12 (p70) (BD PharMingen), TNF-α, IFN-α, and IL-8 (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA) were measured in supernatants by sandwich ELISA. Cultures were performed in duplicate and measured in duplicate. Student's t tests were performed using Microsoft Excel software. DC activation is induced by classes of stimuli through specific receptors (TLR, TNF family, nucleotide, prostaglandin) and signaling cascades. Although each of these classes of agents induces activation and maturation of DC, the function of the resulting DC regarding the type of immune response induced differs. We previously demonstrated that HIV Gag-encoding mRNA activates DC as measured by expression of the DC maturation marker CD83 and antigen-specific T cell activation (25.Weissman D. Ni H. Scales D. Dude A. Capodici J. McGibney K. Abdool A. Isaacs S.N. Cannon G. Kariko K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4710-4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To better define the phenotype of mRNA activated DC, we studied the following markers of DC activation: 1) MHC classes I and II and costimulatory (CD80, CD86) molecules necessary for T cell activation, 2) chemokine receptors (CCR5, CCR6, CXCR4) that traffic DC to peripheral tissues and lymphoid organs, 3) functional uptake of extracellular antigen, and 4) cytokines (IL-12, IL-8, IFN-α, TNF-α) released by DC that regulate and shape the resulting T cell response. mRNA in comparison to the standard DC activation agents, LPS, TNF-α + PGE3, dsRNA, and CD40L, demonstrated the greatest increase in surface proteins associated with T cell activation, CD80, CD86, and MHC classes I and II, and lesser regulation of chemokine receptor expression (Fig. 1 and Table I). Both Gag- and luciferase-encoding mRNA-containing poly(A) tails were used, and no difference in activation of DC was observed. Poly(A) minimally increased CD83 and induced a smaller subset of markers of DC activation while poly(U) did not induce markers of DC activation (Fig. 1 and Table I).Table IRank order change of DC activation markers by stimuliDC activators⇑CD83⇑HLA-ABC⇑HLA-DR⇑CD80⇑CD86⇑CD25⇓CCR5⇓CCR6⇑CXCR4⇓Endocytosis⇑IL-12⇑IFN-α⇑TNF-α⇑IL-8TNF + PGE3445333424421ND1-aND, not done.3LPS54533442445233CD40L44533342446133Poly(I) · poly(C)43433342443423Gag-encoding mRNA35644232344323Poly(A)22322121233112Poly(U)11211111121111None11111111111111The changes in DC activation markers induced by each stimuli after 24–48 h of treatment of immature DC were quantitated (mean fluorescence by flow cytometry for surface molecule expression and amount in supernatant by ELISA for cytokines) and rank-ordered with 1 being change compared to immature (no treatment).

Rank order placement of each activator was determined if a statistically different result was observed in comparing at least five separate experiments between activators. An equal rank was given if no statistically significant difference was observed between activators. The cytokines produced by activated DC during interactions with T cells determines, in part, the phenotype of the resulting T cell response. IL-12, IFN-α, TNF-α, and IL-8 are differentially produced in response to DC activation stimuli. IL-12 in humans acts on T cells to induce them to produce IFN-γ (Th1 response). IFN-α acts on DCs to down-regulate IL-12 and increase IL-10 production (16.Ito T. Amakawa R. Inaba M. Ikehara S. Inaba K. Fukuhara S. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2961-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The lack of IL-12 and the production of IL-10 favor Th2 and Treg T cells. IL-8 acts to attract inflammatory cells and potentiates the local immune response (31.Vissers J.L. Hartgers F.C. Lindhout E. Teunissen M.B. Figdor C.G. Adema G.J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2001; 69: 785-793PubMed Google Scholar). DC cytokine production induced by the different forms of activation demonstrated that mRNA led to moderate levels of IL-12 production compared with the very high levels observed with CD40L and the low amounts observed with TNF-α + PGE3 stimulation (Fig. 2 and Table I). Gag encoding mRNA induced moderate levels of IFN-α and TNF-α, whereas poly(A) did not increase IFN-α or TNF-α production but induced IL-12 suggesting that poly(A) represented a subset of mRNA activation of DC. Activated DCs are superior to immature DC in inducing T cell activation. A system that measures the ability of DC maturation agents to increase DC-induced T cell activation was employed. Unactivated T cells were cocultured with immature or activated DC in the presence of suboptimal concentrations of superantigen for 6 h and then analyzed for the early activation marker CD69. mRNA mediated activation of DC resulted in the induction of CD69 on T cells at similar levels observed for other potent DC-activating agents (Fig. 3 and Table II). Studies examining the cytokines made by T cells activated by DC demonstrated that immature DC induced both IL-4- and IFN-γ-secreting T cells (Fig. 4). This assay measured the percentage of cells induced to make IL-4 or IFN-γ by DC stimulation and differs from other studies that polyclonally stimulate T cells after coculture with DCs, which determine the potential to produce a cytokine induced by the DC (12.Cella M.

LPS induced predominantly IFN-γ-producing T cells with a small population of IL-4 producing CD4+ T cells. Poly(I)·poly(C) activation of DC resulted in CD4+ T cells that produced almost entirely IFN-γ but consistently had a lower percentage of total T cells making IFN-γ compared with other stimuli. mRNA-treated DC activated CD4+ T cells to produce mainly IFN-γ, similar to poly(I)·poly(C) and CD40L (Fig. 4 and data not shown).Table IICD69 expression on CD4− T cells was determined after coculture with immature or activated DCDC activatorCD69+ CD4+ T cells%TNF-α + PGE36.8LPS5.5CD40L7.0Poly(I) · poly(C)6.2Gag-encoding mRNA5.6Medium1.5CD4+ T cells, cocultured with activated DC for 6 h in the presence of superantigen, were stained for CD4 and CD69 and analyzed using flow cytometry.

DC activated with mRNA (4.4 μg/ml), LPS (1 μg/ml), or poly(I)·poly(C) (20 μg/ml) were cocultured with autologous CD4+ T cells, TSST-1 superantigen (0.01 ng/ml), and brefeldin A. After 6 h, cells were permeabilized, stained for IFN-γ, IL-4, and CD69, and flow cytometrically analyzed. Presented histograms showing IFN-γversus IL-4 were gated on CD69+ cells. Although the percentage of cytokine-positive cells appears similar for each condition, as CD69+ cells were analyzed under each condition, the number of cytokine-positive CD4+ T cells in the immature DC coculture were approximately one quarter of that observed under other conditions (Fig. 3).

We observed that poly(A) partially activated DC whereas mRNA fully induced DC maturation and that poly(A) did not whereas mRNA induced TNF-α secretion. It was recently demonstrated that ATP or TNF-α treatment of DC induced low level expression of the DC maturation marker CD83. The addition of both TNF-α and ATP resulted in a synergistic activation of DC (18.Schnurr M. Then F. Galambos P. Scholz C. Siegmund B. Endres S. Eigler A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4704-4709Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A similar synergy was also observed when TNF-α and poly(A) were used to activate DC (data not shown). ATP signals cells through nucleotide receptors that are divided into two families, one G-protein linked (P2Y) and the second through selective cation pore formation (P2X). Poly(A) at similar molar AMP equivalents as ATP stimulated a calcium flux in Fura-2-loaded DC (Fig. 5). Dose-response analysis demonstrated that 1.0 μm AMP equivalents of poly(A) could flux calcium in DC. In vitrotranscribed mRNA encoding the HIV Gag protein and containing a 50-nucleotide or longer poly(A) tail also fluxed Ca2+ in DC, whereas mRNA lacking a poly(A) tail did not (Fig. 5). The P2X receptors flux extracellular calcium through plasma membrane pores, and their signaling is inhibited by removal of extracellular Ca2+ with EGTA. RNA signaling of DC was not inhibited by the absence of extracellular calcium, suggesting that it did not signal through P2X receptors (Fig. 5). These data suggested that poly(A) signaled through P2Y receptors present on DC whose ligands were previously identified as nucleotides. P2Y nucleotide and many G-protein coupled 7-transmembrane receptors can be desensitized to subsequent signaling. This increase in EC50 required for subsequent signaling can be observed for the same or different ligands that share a receptor (33.Otero M. Garrad R.C. Velazquez B. Hernandez-Perez M.G. Camden J.M.

UTP stimulation did not inhibit subsequent signaling by poly(A) or RANTES (Fig. 6). ATP, at low concentrations (1–5 μm), desensitized DC to poly(A), with little or no effect on subsequent RANTES signaling (Fig. 6).

Upon NK cell activation by ligation of 2B4, the intracellular domain of 2B4 associates with the X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP) gene product, signaling lymphocytic activation molecule-associated protein/SH2D1A (SAP/SH2D1A). Defective intracellular association of 2B4 with mutated SAP/SH2D1A is likely to underlie the defects in cytotoxicity observed in NK cells from patients with XLP. We report here a role for phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in the recruitment and association of SAP/SH2D1A to 2B4 in human NK cells. The activation of normal NK cells by ligation of 2B4 leads to the phosphorylation of 2B4, recruitment of SAP/SH2D1A, and association of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K. The inhibition of PI3K enzymatic activity with either wortmannin or LY294002 prior to 2B4 ligation does not alter the association of 2B4 with the p85 subunit but prevents the recruitment of SAP/SH2D1A to 2B4. In addition, PI3K inhibitors significantly diminish the cytotoxic function of primary NK cells. This observed inhibition of cytotoxicity, present in normal NK cells, was less apparent or absent in NK cells derived from a patient with XLP. These data indicate that the cytotoxicity of activated NK cells is mediated by the association of 2B4 and SAP/SH2D1A, and that this association is dependent upon the activity of PI3K.

A large number of activating and inhibitory receptors are expressed on the surface of NK cells, and there is a general agreement that the effector function of NK cells is determined by a balance of positive and negative intracellular signals (3.Moretta A.

Upon 2B4 activation by a natural ligand, CD48, or with a monoclonal antibody, NK cells are induced to augment their cytotoxicity, secrete interferon-γ, and increase calcium flux, phosphoinositol turnover, and perforin degranulation.

In addition, 2B4 associates with signaling lymphocytic activation molecule-associated protein/SH2D1A (SAP/SH2D1A), an adaptor molecule containing a single SH2 domain (18.Tangye S.G. Phillips J.H.

Consistent with the expression of SAP/SH2D1A in NK cells and its intracellular association with 2B4, XLP patients manifest defects in NK cytotoxic function, particularly following 2B4 activation (18.Tangye S.G.

However, the detailed intracellular mechanisms by which SAP/SH2D1A influences 2B4 signaling and NK function are unclear, and in particular, the involvement of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in 2B4-mediated cytotoxicity is unknown. Class I PI3K, the isoform most linked to lymphocytes, comprises both a catalytic (p110α, β, γ, or δ) and a regulatory (p85α, p85β, p101, or p55 γ) subunit (25.Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 26.Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). In the case of tyrosine-phosphorylated membrane receptors such as 2B4, PI3K activation begins with the formation of a high affinity interaction between SH2 domains of either p85α or p85β and tyrosine-phosphorylated cytoplasmic domains of the membrane receptor. The association of the p85 subunit recruits the p110 catalytic subunit, which can phosphorylate the D-3 position of the inositol ring of phosphoinositol lipids. The phosphorylated inositol lipids and other metabolites including phosphatidylinositol 3,4-biphosphate are termed 3′-phosphoinositides and act as second messengers in signal transduction. A role for PI3K and 3′-phosphoinositides is suggested because PI3K is known to participate in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of NK cells (27.Kanakaraj P. Duckworth B. Azzoni L. Kamoun M. Cantley L.C. Perussia B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 551-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,28.Bonnema J.D. Karnitz L.M. Schoon R.A. Abraham R.T. Leibson P.J. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1427-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and inhibition of PI3K activity has been shown to decrease the cellular cytotoxicity of an NK cell line, NK92 (29.Jiang K. Zhong B. Gilvary D.L. Corliss B.C. Hong-Geller E. Wei S. Djeu J.Y. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the role of PI3K in the downstream signaling events of 2B4 following the activation of primary human NK cells. We show that the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K associates with 2B4, and that the association of 2B4 with SAP/SH2D1A is abrogated by the inhibition of PI3K enzymatic activity. We also provide evidence that PI3K activity induced by 2B4 stimulation is absent in NK cells expressing mutated SAP/SH2D1A. Finally, we show that PI3K inhibitors diminish the cytotoxicity of NK cells obtained from healthy individuals but have little or no effect on the cytotoxicity of NK cells from an XLP patient. Polyclonal antiserum to human SAP/SH2D1A was produced by immunizing rabbits with a C-terminal peptide (GTTGIREDPDVCLKAP) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (ImmuneChem Pharmaceuticals, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). Antibodies used included anti-2B4 (mAb C1.7, Biodesign International, Saco, ME), anti-p85 (BD Transduction Laboratories, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), antiphosphotyrosine (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NJ), anti-CD3 fluorescein isothiocyanate, and anti-CD56 PE (BD PharMingen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada).

The study was approved by the University of British Columbia Clinical Research Ethics Board, and informed consent was obtained from all subjects prior to blood collection. NK cells were selected from peripheral blood using RosetteSep (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) containing antibodies to CD3, CD36, CD4, CD66b, CD19, and glycophorin A followed by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. Cells were cultured in complete medium (CM) consisting of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% human serum, 10 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mml-glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, 5 × 10−5m2-mercaptoethanol, and 1000 IU/ml IL-2 (Teceleukin, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). These cells were used for all experiments and represent an IL-2-activated NK or lymphokine-activated killer cell phenotype. Prior to experiments, NK cells were rested for 6 h in AIM-V serum-free medium (Invitrogen). For inhibition experiments, chemical inhibitors (100 nm wortmannin, 100 μmLY294002, 25 μm PD98059, 100 μm protein kinase C inhibitor (residues 19–27 of sequence RFARKGALRQKNV), or 100 μm PP2) were added for 30 min at 37 °C. The concentrations for wortmannin and LY294002 were determined by dose response experiments (data not shown). For activation, NK cells were incubated for 5 min with mAb C1.7 and IL-2 (100 IU/ml). NK cells were prepared as described above and used in either an inactivated (CM alone) or activated (CM with anti-2B4 and IL-2) state as effector cells. The target cells were either the NK-sensitive chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, K562 (ATCC, Manassas, VA), or the NK-resistant lymphokine-activated killer-sensitive Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, Raji (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Target cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum and labeled with51Cr for 1 h. The effector to target ratio was adjusted to 20:1 and/or 10:1 in a total volume of 200 μl. The cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C, and 100 μl of supernatant was removed from each well for γ-radiation counting. Specific lysis was calculated as described previously (23.Benoit L. Wang X. Pabst H.F. Dutz J. Tan R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3549-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). NK cells (5 × 106 cells) were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors mixture). The preparation was centrifuged at 14,000 ×g at 4 °C for 15 min, and the lysate was precleared by incubation with protein A/G-agarose at 4 °C for 15 min to reduce the nonspecific binding of proteins to agarose beads. The protein concentration of the lysates was measured by the Bradford method, and equal amounts were used in Western blots or immunoprecipitates. For immunoprecipitates, the lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:100 dilution of the relevant antibody. The immune complexes were collected by the addition of protein A/G-agarose, and the pellet was washed three times in immunoprecipitated buffer before suspension in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 with the exception of tyrosine phosphorylation experiments where 1% bovine serum albumin was added to the Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. The membranes were incubated with primary antibody in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C and then with secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature before detection using either a color development method (Bio-Rad) or ECL using SuperSignal WestPico substrate (Pierce). For all assays, wide range molecular weight standards were used (Bio-Rad). PI3K assays were performed as described previously (30.al-Aoukaty A. Rolstad B. Maghazachi A.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3249-3255PubMed Google Scholar). NK cells were either left intact or pretreated with 100 nm wortmannin as described earlier and then were incubated in CM alone or CM with mAb C1.7 and IL-2 (100 IU/ml) for 5 min. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with mAb C1.7, and immunocomplexes were washed first with buffer containing 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris base, pH 7.5, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1% Nonidet P-40 and then with buffer containing 0.5 m LiCl, 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and finally with Tris/NaCl/EDTA buffer containing 0.1 mmsodium orthovanadate. The protein complexes were mixed with 50 μl of Tris/NaCl/EDTA buffer, 10 μl (20 μg) of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (Sigma), and 10 μl of 100 mm MgCl2. The reaction was started by the addition of 30 μCi/sample of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated for 10 min at 25 °C. MgCl2(20 mm) was then added to this mixture for an additional 15 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 6n HCl and 160 μl of CHCl3:MeOH (1:1). The organic phase was separated from the chloroform layer, and 50 μl was spotted on thin layer chromatography aluminum Silica Gel 60 F254 precoated sheets (Sigma). Thin layer chromatography plates were developed and resolved in CHCl3:MeOH:H2O:NH4OH (60:47:11.3:2), left to dry, and phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate products were visualized by autoradiography. Previous reports indicate that the activation of NK cell lines by the ligation of 2B4 is followed by 2B4 phosphorylation and the recruitment of SAP/SH2D1A (12.Tangye S.G. Lazetic S. Woollatt E. Sutherland G.R. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6981-6985PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Bottino C. Augugliaro R. Castriconi R. Nanni M. Biassoni R. Moretta L. Moretta A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 3718-3722Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Using NK cells from healthy individuals, we found that activation of primary NK cells with an antibody to 2B4 (31.Valiante N.M. Trinchieri G. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) results in 2B4 phosphorylation within 2 min of stimulation (Fig. 1A) and the recruitment of SAP/SH2D1A (Fig. 1B). The association of 2B4 and SAP/SH2D1A is present following ligation with anti-2B4 alone but is significantly enhanced when IL-2 is present, suggesting a synergistic interaction between 2B4 and IL-2 and also implying that downstream pathways of IL-2 signaling are important for the recruitment of SAP/SH2D1A (Fig. 1B). The association between 2B4 and SAP/SH2D1A begins at 5 min following NK activation and persists at least 20 min (Fig. 1C). In contrast, cells from an XLP patient who carries an inactivating arginine to leucine (R55L) mutation of SAP/SH2D1A (32.Dutz J.P. Benoit L. Wang X. Demetrick D.J. Junker A. de Sa D. Tan R. Blood. 2001; 97: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) failed to recruit SAP/SH2D1A to 2B4 following activation (Fig. 1D). The lack of association between 2B4 and SAP/SH2D1A was not because of an absolute lack of SAP/SH2D1A expression in mutated cells, although there was a decreased level of expression seen (Fig. 1E). Because PI3K has been previously implicated in both NK cytotoxicity (29.Jiang K. Zhong B. Gilvary D.L. Corliss B.C. Hong-Geller E. Wei S. Djeu J.Y. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and chemotaxis (30.al-Aoukaty A. Rolstad B. Maghazachi A.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3249-3255PubMed Google Scholar,33.Servant G. Weiner O.D. Herzmark P. Balla T. Sedat J.W. Bourne H.R. Science. 2000; 287: 1037-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), we investigated whether PI3K associates with 2B4 in activated NK cells. The PI3K isoform in lymphocytes consists of a regulatory subunit p85, which contains two SH2 domains, and a catalytic subunit p110, which functions as a lipid kinase. The presence of SH2 domains within the regulatory subunit suggests a potential association between phosphorylated 2B4 and PI3K. NK cells cultured from healthy individuals were either left inactivated or activated briefly with anti-2B4 and IL-2. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-2B4 and immunoblotted with anti-p85. Fig. 2A indicates that the p85 subunit of PI3K associates with 2B4 ∼3 min following NK activation and dissociates sometime between 10 and 20 min. The observed association between 2B4 and the p85 subunit of PI3K implies a role for 2B4 in the induction of PI3K activity and the subsequent generation of phosphorylated membrane lipids. To verify that the 2B4·p85 complex has associated enzymatic activity, we immunoprecipitated 2B4·p85 complexes from NK cells before and after 2B4 stimulation and determined the ability of the complexes to generate phospholipid products (Fig. 2B). A lipid substrate (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) was added to the immunoprecipitated complexes in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, and the lipid products were separated by thin layer chromatography and visualized by autoradiography. To determine specifically the role of SAP/SH2D1A in the activation of PI3K, we performed these experiments using normal and XLP-derived NK cells. After 2B4 stimulation, immunoprecipitates derived from normal controls were able to generate phosphoinositide 3′ products (phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate), indicating that PI3K associated with 2B4 is functionally active (Fig. 2B,lane 3). As expected, the addition of wortmannin inhibited this kinase activity (Fig. 2B, lane 2). However, in contrast to cells derived from healthy subjects, immunoprecipitates from NK cells expressing a mutated form of SAP/SH2D1A lacked any PI3K activity (Fig. 2B, lane 6). The loss of PI3K activity was not because of a lack of association between 2B4 and PI3K, although this association was weaker in XLP-derived NK cells (Fig. 2C). We also investigated the effect of PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin or LY294002, on the association of 2B4 with PI3K p85 itself. The pretreatment of NK cells with either inhibitor did not prevent the association of the p85 subunit with 2B4 (Fig. 2D). Therefore, the expression of mutated SAP/SH2D1A alters the association and/or function of PI3K in NK cells, and PI3K activity is absent following 2B4-mediated activation of XLP-derived NK cells. To investigate further the role of PI3K following 2B4 activation, we studied the effect of wortmannin on the association between 2B4 and SAP/SH2D1A (Fig. 3A). NK cells obtained from healthy individuals were left unstimulated or briefly stimulated with anti-2B4 and IL-2, and the lysates were harvested at 5 min. As expected, because 2B4 is phosphorylated following activation (Fig. 1A), 2B4 and SAP/SH2D1A were associated in stimulated NK cells, however, the pretreatment of cells with PI3K inhibitors but not with other kinase inhibitors resulted in a loss of this association. Because SAP/SH2D1A has previously been shown to associate only with phosphorylated 2B4 (34.Sayos J. Nguyen K.B. Wu C. Stepp S.E. Howie D. Schatzle J.D. Kumar V. Biron C.A. Terhorst C. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1749-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), we next determined the effect of wortmannin on 2B4 phosphorylation. NK cells from healthy individuals were pretreated with wortmannin and then activated with anti-2B4 to determine whether 2B4 phosphorylation was altered. In normal NK cells, wortmannin did not alter the phosphorylation of 2B4 at 3 min or the dephosphorylation of 2B4 that occurred within 5 min (Fig. 2A). However, in XLP-NK cells, the presence of wortmannin resulted in significantly less phosphorylated 2B4 at both 3 and 5 min, suggesting that dephosphorylation of 2B4 was occurring faster in XLP cells. These observed differences between healthy and XLP NK cells were not because of differences in the phenotype of the cells nor the levels of 2B4 expression (Fig. 3C). Together, these data demonstrate a critical and functional role for PI3K in the recruitment of SAP/SH2D1A to 2B4. In the experiments described above, we determined that the inhibition of PI3K activity prevents an association of SAP/SH2D1A with 2B4, and we showed that NK cells with a mutation of SAP/SH2D1A lack PI3K enzymatic activity. To assess the functional significance of abnormal PI3K signaling, we established NK cytotoxicity assays using cells derived from normal controls and an XLP patient. We showed previously that NK cells carrying the R55L mutation in SAP/SH2D1A have defective cytotoxicity when tested against K562 target cells (23.Benoit L. Wang X. Pabst H.F. Dutz J. Tan R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3549-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In those experiments, the reduction of killing by freshly isolated (uncultured) NK cells was a consequence of fewer (CD3-CD56+) NK cells present in XLP males. By using a stringent purification method for selecting NK cells and by culturing them in high dose IL-2, we have since been able to reliably generate CD3-CD56+ NK populations of >90% purity from both healthy volunteers and an XLP patient (Fig. 4A). We compared the cytotoxic function of these effector cells, both normal and XLP-derived, against K562 and Raji targets with or without 2B4 activation. Surprisingly, NK cytotoxicity against K562 cells was not significantly different between the two groups (Fig. 4B), suggesting that IL-2 cultured NK cells from XLP patients are fully capable of killing MHC class I-deficient/low target cells. However, when tested against Raji targets that express surface MHC class I, NK cells from normal controls exhibited more cytotoxicity than XLP NK cells (Fig. 4C,p = 0.002). Moreover, when NK cells were activated with anti-2B4, the differences in cytotoxicity were significantly more apparent against both K562 (Fig. 4D, p < 0.001) and Raji (Fig. 4E, p < 0.0001) cells. These data indicate that XLP-derived NK cells kill MHC class I-deficient target cells in normal fashion but display diminished cytotoxicity against cells expressing MHC class I. In addition, as previously reported, XLP-derived NK cells manifest a significant defect in 2B4-activated cytotoxicity. Using the system noted above, we investigated the effect of PI3K inhibitors on the cytotoxicity of normal and XLP-derived NK cells. NK cells were incubated in the presence or absence of PI3K inhibitors prior to cytotoxicity assays performed with or without 2B4 ligation. We found that both wortmannin and LY294002 significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of normal NK cells against K562 target cells with or without 2B4 activation (Fig. 5,A and C, *, p < 0.0001 in all cases comparing CM alone with wortmannin or LY294002). However, the reduction in cytotoxicity was far less significant in NK cells that carry the XLP mutation (Fig. 5A, ∗∗,p = 0.018, and C, ∗∗,p = 0.036). Against Raji target cells, normal NK cells were also significantly inhibited by wortmannin or LY294002 (Figs. 5,B and D, *, p < 0.0001 in all cases), but the inhibition of XLP-derived NK cytotoxicity was insignificant (Fig. 5, B, ∗∗,p = 0.18, and D, ∗∗, p = 0.17). These findings suggest that a mutation of SAP/SH2D1A partially conceals the effect that PI3K inhibitors have on NK cytotoxicity. We have investigated the role of PI3K in 2B4-mediated signal transduction following NK cell activation. In agreement with previous reports (12.Tangye S.G. Lazetic S. Woollatt E. Sutherland G.R. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6981-6985PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Watzl C. Stebbins C.C. Long E.O. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3545-3548Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we found that 2B4 is phosphorylated ∼2 min after 2B4 stimulation, and we showed that phosphorylation of 2B4 is followed first by the association of PI3K at ∼3 min and then by the association of SAP/SH2D1A at 5 min. These kinetics of association are consistent with a previous report (34.Sayos J. Nguyen K.B. Wu C. Stepp S.E. Howie D. Schatzle J.D. Kumar V. Biron C.A. Terhorst C. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1749-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) that SAP/SH2D1A interacts only with the phosphorylated form of 2B4. Interestingly, we found that by inhibiting PI3K activity either with wortmannin or with LY294002, the association of SAP/SH2D1A to 2B4 was prevented, implying that PI3K either directly or indirectly facilitates the binding of SAP/SH2D1A to 2B4. In an XLP patient with an inactivating mutation of SAP/SH2D1A, 2B4 and PI3K continued to be associated (Fig. 2C), but PI3K activity was not present (Fig. 2B), suggesting that conversely PI3K activity is dependent on functioning SAP/SH2D1A. These findings taken together imply a complex sequence of events following 2B4 stimulation where SAP/SH2D1A-2B4 association is dependent on PI3K activity and where PI3K activity is dependent on functional SAP/SH2D1A. These events suggest that SAP/SH2D1A has multiple functions beyond simply binding to phosphorylated 2B4 and may also bind to one or more other phosphotyrosine motifs that facilitate PI3K activity. For instance, it was shown previously that LAT constitutively associates with 2B4, and that the ligation of 2B4 leads to the phosphorylation of LAT and the recruitment of other intracellular proteins to the LAT·2B4 complex (17.Bottino C. Augugliaro R. Castriconi R. Nanni M. Biassoni R. Moretta L. Moretta A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 3718-3722Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested in T cells that the p85 subunit of PI3K associates with LAT directly or with the tyrosine-phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based motif of the FcR γ-chain via the SH2 domains of p85 (35.Gibbins J.M. Briddon S. Shutes A. van Vugt M.J. van de Winkel J.G. Saito T. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34437-34443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, SAP/SH2D1A may facilitate PI3K activation through its association with LAT rather than 2B4 (17.Bottino C. Augugliaro R. Castriconi R. Nanni M. Biassoni R. Moretta L. Moretta A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 3718-3722Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the above findings argue that PI3K plays an important role in mediating the cytotoxicity of 2B4-activated NK cells. PI3K and its downstream products have been implicated in basic cell processes that influence NK cytotoxicity including chemotaxis (33.Servant G. Weiner O.D. Herzmark P. Balla T. Sedat J.W. Bourne H.R. Science. 2000; 287: 1037-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), trafficking of perforin/granzyme B (29.Jiang K. Zhong B. Gilvary D.L. Corliss B.C. Hong-Geller E. Wei S. Djeu J.Y. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), and plasma membrane reorganization (36.Corvera S. Czech M.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 442-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). It is unclear as to which of these activities is most important in the context of 2B4-mediated NK cytotoxicity, because all three mechanisms may play critical roles. For example, the recruitment and activation of PI3K may affect NK plasma membrane reorganization. In support of this hypothesis, previous work (37.Yashiro-Ohtani Y. Zhou X.Y. Toyo-Oka K. Tai X.G. Park C.S. Hamaoka T. Abe R. Miyake K. Fujiwara H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1251-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 38.Grakoui A. Bromley S.K. Sumen C. Davis M.M. Shaw A.S. Allen P.M. Dustin M.L. Science. 1999; 285: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar) indicates that CD2, which is closely related to 2B4, assists in adhesion between T cells and antigen-presenting cells, and that the adhesion-promoting properties of CD2 are mediated by the formation of lipid rafts. Raft formation occurred in both activated T cells, a subset of which also express 2B4, (38.Grakoui A. Bromley S.K. Sumen C. Davis M.M. Shaw A.S. Allen P.M. Dustin M.L. Science. 1999; 285: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar, 39.Dustin M.L. Shaw A.S. Science. 1999; 283: 649-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and in NK cells (40.Davis D.M. Chiu I. Fassett M. Cohen G.B. Mandelboim O. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15062-15067Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 41.Lou Z. Jevremovic D. Billadeau D.D. Leibson P.J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and interestingly, it was dependent on PI3K activity (42.Moran M. Miceli M.C. Immunity. 1998; 9: 787-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Thus, 2B4 stimulation and the downstream functions of both SAP/SH2D1A and PI3K may assist in lipid raft formation, which is critical for signaling and cytotoxicity. In addition, defects of the perforin/granzyme B pathway would certainly affect NK cell cytotoxicity. In this regard, Djeu and colleagues (29.Jiang K. Zhong B. Gilvary D.L. Corliss B.C. Hong-Geller E. Wei S. Djeu J.Y. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 43.Wei S. Gamero A.M. Liu J.H. Daulton A.A. Valkov N.I. Trapani J.A. Larner A.C. Weber M.J. Djeu J.Y. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1753-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) have shown that intracellular redistribution of perforin granules is dependent on PI3K and its downstream effectors, MEK and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2 (ERK2). In addition to preventing the association of 2B4 with SAP/SH2D1A, wortmannin and LY294002 were able to inhibit significantly the cytotoxicity of normal NK cells (Fig. 5). This inhibition was much less apparent or absent in NK cells from a patient with XLP, suggesting that a block in signaling at the stage of PI3K was made redundant by a block at the stage of SAP/SH2D1A association. The implication of this redundancy is that PI3K and SAP/SH2D1A participate serially in the same signaling pathway. Therefore, we propose a model whereby the activation of PI3K allows SAP/SH2D1A to associate with 2B4, and we suggest that this association is critical for NK cell effector function. In XLP patients, SAP/SH2D1A is unable to bind to 2B4. Thus, any inhibition of PI3K has no further impact on cytotoxicity, and we conclude that the major effect of wortmannin and LY294002 on blocking cytotoxicity occurs via preventing the association of SAP with 2B4. This conclusion is also consistent with our finding that NK cells carrying mutated SAP/SH2D1A cannot induce PI3K activity following 2B4 stimulation (Fig. 3), although the precise mechanism is unknown. During investigation of the role of PI3K in NK cytotoxicity, we found as others have (18.Tangye S.G. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. Nichols K.E. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2932-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 24.Nakajima H. Cella M. Bouchon A. Grierson H.L. Lewis J. Duckett C.S. Cohen J.I. Colonna M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 3309-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) that NK cells expressing mutated SAP/SH2D1A lyse K562 target cells as efficiently as normal NK cells. The differences in cytotoxicity between normal and XLP cells only appeared when lymphokine-activated killer-sensitive (NK-resistant) Raji target cells were used or when NK cells were activated with anti-2B4. One difference between K562 cells and Raji cells is that the K562 cells lack or have very low MHC class I surface expression, whereas Raji cells express HLA A, B, C (44.Johnson D.R. Hum. Immunol. 2000; 61: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Taken together, one interpretation of these observations is that NK cells from XLP patients are fully capable of killing MHC class I-deficient targets, but because they lack functional SAP/SH2D1A, they are unable to achieve the broader killing repertoire of 2B4-activated NK cells. Because MHC class I-deficient target cells are likely to generate fewer NK inhibitory signals, unstimulated NK cells are still able to efficiently lyse them. We speculate that different viral infections may generate different expression levels of MHC class I on infected cells and that clinically apparent XLP develops only when containment of viral replication requires 2B4-dependent elimination of infected targets.

https://openalex.org/W2026949048,"Natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR)-A is the primary signaling receptor for atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide. Ligand binding to NPR-A rapidly activates its guanylyl cyclase domain, but its rate of cGMP synthesis declines with time. This waning of activity is called homologous desensitization and is mediated in part by receptor dephosphorylation. Here, we characterize two distinct NPR-A phosphatase activities. The serine/threonine protein phosphatase inhibitor, microcystin, inhibited the desensitization of NPR-A in membrane guanylyl cyclase assays in the absence of magnesium. EDTA also inhibited the desensitization, whereas MgCl2 stimulated the desensitization. Because the effects of microcystin and EDTA were additive, and microcystin did not block the magnesium-dependent desensitization, the targets for these agents appear to be distinct. Incubation of membranes at 37 °C stimulated the dephosphorylation of NPR-A, and microcystin blocked the temperature-dependent dephosphorylation. The addition of MgCl2 or MnCl2, but not CaCl2, further stimulated the dephosphorylation of NPR-A, and microcystin failed to inhibit this process. The desensitization required changes in the phosphorylation state of NPR-A because the guanylyl cyclase activity of a receptor variant containing glutamate substitutions at all six phosphorylation sites was unaffected by MgCl2, EDTA, or microcystin. Together, these data indicate that NPR-A is regulated by two distinct phosphatases, possibly including a member of the protein phosphatase 2C family. Finally, we observed that the desensitization of NPR-A in membranes from mouse kidneys and NIH3T3 cells was increased by prior exposure to atrial natriuretic peptide, suggesting that hormone binding enhances receptor dephosphorylation.

The clearance receptor consists of an extracellular domain, a single membrane-spanning region, and only 37 intracellular amino acids. It controls the local concentrations of natriuretic peptides through receptor-mediated internalization and degradation (11Maack T. Suzuki M. Almeida F.A. Nussenzveig D. Scarborough R.M. McEnroe G.A.

Experiments conducted on mice lacking NPR-A suggest that the known cardiovascular effects of ANP and BNP are mediated through this receptor (13Kishimoto I. Dubois S.K. Garbers D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad.

However, a signaling function for the clearance receptor has been observed by many laboratories (15Pagano M. Anand-Srivastava M.B. J. Biol.

Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 215-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Full-length NPR-A exists as a homodimer, and ligand binding does not promote further oligomerization (18Chinkers M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18589-18597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lowe D.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10421-10425Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast, hormone binding to a truncated monomeric extracellular form of NPR-A does stimulate dimerization (20Misono K.S. Sivasubramanian N. Berkner K. Zhang X. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 516-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), indicating that ligand coupling causes a significant tightening of the extracellular dimeric contacts between the two monomers. Recent data suggest that the intramolecular disulfide bond formed between Cys423 and Cys432 is critical for hormonal activation of NPR-A (21Huo X. Abe T. Misono K.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16941-16951Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22McLabrecque J. Nicoll N. Marquis M. De Lean A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9752-9759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ANP- and disulfide-dependent dimerization of a mutant form of NPR-A containing an unpaired Cys in place of Asp435 has recently been demonstrated, suggesting that one consequence of hormone binding is the packing of the extracellular juxtamembrane portions of the two monomers in closer proximity to each other. This “tightening” is presumably transduced across the membrane, where it facilitates ATP binding to the KHD, which alleviates the basal KHD-mediated repression of the cyclase domain.NPR-A is phosphorylated on four serine and two threonine residues within a 17-amino acid stretch of its KHD (23Potter L.R. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2164-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Replacement of any of these phosphorylated amino acids with alanine to mimic the uncharged nature of a dephosphorylated residue results in losses in hormone-dependent guanylyl cyclase activities. Receptors lacking four or more of these sites are completely unresponsive to ANP, which indicates that phosphorylation of the KHD is required for NPR-A activation. In the continued presence of natriuretic peptide, the guanylyl cyclase activity of NPR-A wanes (24Cahill P.A. Redmond E.M. Keenan A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21896-21906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Woods M. Houslay M.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 26Yasunari K.

This process is called homologous desensitization and is mediated, at least in part, by dephosphorylation of all six NPR-A phosphorylation sites, a process termed global dephosphorylation (27Potter L.R.

Consistent with this model of desensitization, a “constitutively phosphorylated” version of NPR-A containing glutamate residues at all six phosphorylation sites (NPR-A-6E) to mimic the negative charge of phosphate is hormonally responsive and resistant to homologous desensitization (31Potter L.R. Hunter T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1811-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). NPR-A is also desensitized in the absence of ANP or BNP by pressor hormones that antagonize the physiologic consequences of natriuretic peptides (32Haneda M. Kikkawa R. Maeda S. Togawa M. Koya D. Horide N. Kajiwara N. Shigeta Y. Kidney Int. 1991; 40: 188-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,33Jaiswal R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This process, called heterologous desensitization, may involve protein kinase C because pharmacological activators of protein kinase C, such as phorbol esters, mimic this response (26Yasunari K. Kohno M. Murakawa K. Yokokawa K. Horio T. Takeda T. Hypertension. 1992; 19: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The phorbol ester-dependent desensitization also is associated with the dephosphorylation of NPR-A (30Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14636-14642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it differs from the homologous desensitization process in that only a single or small subset of the total phosphorylation sites is dephosphorylated (30Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14636-14642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The identity of the residue(s) dephosphorylated in response to heterologous desensitization is currently unknown.Early work by Ingebritsen and Cohen (34Ingebritsen T.S. Cohen P. Science. 1983; 221: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) classified serine/threonine protein phosphatases (PPs) into two general categories, based on their ability to dephosphorylate the α or β subunit of phosphorylase kinase. PP1 preferentially dephosphorylates the β subunit, whereas members of the PP2 family prefer the α subunit. Experimentally, PP1 can be differentiated from other phosphatases by its nanomolar sensitivity to the thermostable protein inhibitors 1 and 2. The PP2 family, which is not sensitive to inhibitor 1 or inhibitor 2, can be further subclassified into PP2A, PP2B, and PP2C. Neither PP1 nor PP2A requires divalent cations for activity, and both are sensitive to inhibition by 0.1–10 nanomolar concentrations of microcystin, okadaic acid, tautomycin, and calyculin A. PP2B is not affected by these compounds, requires calcium and calmodulin for activity, and is specifically inhibited by cypermethyrine, cyclosporin, or FK-506. The distinguishing features of PP2C are that it requires relatively high concentrations of magnesium or manganese (∼1.5 mm) for activity, and it has no known specific inhibitor. Several additional protein phosphatases, such as PP4 (also called PPX), PP5, PP6, and PP7, have recently been identified by molecular cloning techniques (35Cohen P.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). PP4, PP5, and PP6 do not require divalent cations for activity and are inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of okadaic acid or microcystin, whereas PP7 requires magnesium for activity, is localized to the retina, and is insensitive to microcystin or okadaic acid (36Herzig S. Neumann J. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 173-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 37Sheppeck II, J.E. Gauss C.M. Chamberlin A.R. Bioorg. Med.

Chem. 2001; 276: 6057-6060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Microcystin prevents the desensitization of NPR-A in membrane fractions (38Foster D.C. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16311-16318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and experiments with the constitutively phosphorylated receptor variant (NPR-A-6E) indicated that the target of the microcystin-sensitive phosphatase is NPR-A itself (31Potter L.R. Hunter T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1811-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence for a second distinct NPR-A phosphatase that has characteristics in common with PP2C.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we have documented the dephosphorylation of NPR-A by two distinct protein phosphatase activities. One does not require magnesium for activity but is sensitive to microcystin/okadaic acid-like inhibitors and has been described previously by Foster and Garbers (38Foster D.C. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16311-16318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) as well as by our laboratory (31Potter L.R. Hunter T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1811-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The other phosphatase does require magnesium for activity but is not inhibited by microcystin and has not been described previously. The identity of the former phosphatase is not known, but based on its sensitivity to microcystin, PP1, PP2A, PP4, PP5, or PP6 are reasonable candidates (36Herzig S. Neumann J. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 173-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 37Sheppeck II, J.E. Gauss C.M. Chamberlin A.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 1739-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).In contrast to the microcystin-sensitive phosphatase, potential candidates for the magnesium-dependent phosphatase are limited to members of two families, PP2C or PP7, because these are the only known serine/threonine phosphatases that require magnesium for activity and are not inhibited by microcystin. Based on tissue distribution, we can eliminate PP7 from consideration because its expression is restricted to the retina (40Huang X. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1462-1468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), whereas NPR-A expression is widespread. Hence, it is likely that the magnesium-dependent NPR-A phosphatase is a member of the PP2C family. Based on primary amino acid sequence similarity, there are seven known mammalian gene products that comprise the PP2C family: α, β, γ, δ, Wip, FIN13, and CaMKIIPase (Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II phosphatase). Based on their exclusive nuclear localization, it is unlikely that Wip and FIN13 are involved in the dephosphorylation of NPR-A (41Fiscella M. Zhang H. Fan S. Sakaguchi K. Shen S. Mercer W.E. Vande Woude G.F. O'Connor P.M. Appella E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6048-6053Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 42Guthridge M.A. Bellosta P. Tavoloni N. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5485-5498Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Likewise, because of its disparate expression pattern compared with NPR-A (high in skeletal muscle and testis but low in kidney and lung), PP2Cγ seems an unlikely candidate. Similarly, the fact that manganese but not magnesium is required to activate PP2Cδ and CaMKIIPase appears to eliminate these phosphatases from consideration as well (43Ishida A. Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1904-1910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar,44Tong Y. Quirion R. Shen S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35282-35290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is not clear which of the two remaining PP2C family members regulates NPR-A, but because an antibody that recognizes PP2Cα and some PP2Cβ alternative splicing forms detected significant amounts of PP2C in membranes from baby hamster kidney cells, these two isoforms are prime candidates.One puzzling finding that we made during the course of these studies is that high concentrations of NaF (50 mm) did not affect the ANP/ATP-dependent guanylyl cyclase activity of NPR-A in time course experiments such as those shown in Fig. 1. This led us to suspect that the microcystin-sensitive phosphatase was novel because, to our knowledge, there are no known microcystin- or okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatases that are not also inhibited by NaF. However, when we subsequently tested the ability of NaF to inhibit the loss of NPR-A activity in the two-stage assay, we found that it completely blocked the temperature- and magnesium-dependent losses in cyclase activity. The reason for the discrepancy is not known at the moment, but it may be related to the fact the cyclase reaction mixture in the time course experiment contains compounds that might bind and decrease the amount of free fluoride available to inhibit the phosphatases. Alternatively, it may be that the receptor is rapidly rephosphorylated in the time course experiment due to the presence of ATP and magnesium. At the moment, a definitive explanation for these results is unavailable.In two of the three systems tested, ANP binding markedly decreased subsequent ANP/ATP-dependent guanylyl cyclase activities, suggesting either that hormone binding stimulates receptor dephosphorylation or that a liganded receptor is a better substrate for dephosphorylation. The reason for diminished effect in the 293 cells is not known, but it may be related to the fact that NPR-A in these cells is only slightly inhibited by phorbol ester treatment. 2L. R. Potter, unpublished observation. In our opinion, the mouse kidney membranes are the best model system to reproduce the regulation of NPR-A in vivo because they express physiologic amounts of the receptor and, unlike the transfected cells, express the necessary kinases and phosphatases in the appropriate stoichiometries. However, of the two established stable cell lines, it appears that the 3T3-NPR-A cell line is better suited for studies on the desensitization of NPR-A because it is regulated more like NPR-A in the mouse kidney membranes.Finally, it will be interesting to determine the relative contribution of these phosphatases to the dephosphorylation of NPR-A that is initiated by homologous and heterologous stimuli. Recently, Joubert et al. (28Joubert S. Labrecque J. De Lean A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11096-11105Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) reported that ANP-dependent dephosphorylation of NPR-A in whole transfected 293 cells results primarily from the inactivation of the NPR-A kinase, with little contribution from increased phosphatase activity. These data are completely consistent with our findings in the 293-NPR-A model system. Whether this is a general phenomenon or restricted to 293 cells remains to be determined, but our data using membranes from mouse kidneys and NIH3T3 cells suggest that ANP binding may increase NPR-A phosphatase activity as well. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)1 and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), found in the atria and ventricles of the heart, respectively, are cardiac hormones that counterbalance the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (1Levin E.R. Gardner D.G. Samson W.K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar, 2Wilkins M.R. Redondo J. Brown L.A. Lancet. 1997; 349: 1307-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Acutely, they decrease blood pressure by (i) increasing renal sodium and water excretion, (ii) stimulating vascular vasorelaxation, and (iii) inhibiting aldosterone and renin secretion. Chronically, ANP inhibits the hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes (3Kishimoto I. Rossi K. Garbers D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

ANP and BNP bind two distinct cell surface proteins known as the natriuretic peptide clearance receptor and NPR-A/guanylyl cyclase A (6Lucas K.A. Pitari G.M. Kazerounian S. Ruiz-Stewart I. Park J.

Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 215-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The clearance receptor consists of an extracellular domain, a single membrane-spanning region, and only 37 intracellular amino acids. It controls the local concentrations of natriuretic peptides through receptor-mediated internalization and degradation (11Maack T. Suzuki M. Almeida F.A. Nussenzveig D. Scarborough R.M. McEnroe G.A. Lewicki J.A. Science. 1987; 238: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar) and may signal through the heterotrimeric G proteins Gi and/or Go (12Anand-Srivastava M.B. Trachte G.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1993; 45: 455-497PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments conducted on mice lacking NPR-A suggest that the known cardiovascular effects of ANP and BNP are mediated through this receptor (13Kishimoto I. Dubois S.K. Garbers D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6215-6219Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 14Lopez M.J. Garbers D.L. Kuhn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23064-23068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, a signaling function for the clearance receptor has been observed by many laboratories (15Pagano M. Anand-Srivastava M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22064-22070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Trachte G.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 210-215PubMed Google Scholar, 17Murthy K.S.

NPR-A consists of an extracellular ligand binding domain, a single hydrophobic membrane-spanning region, an intracellular kinase homology domain (KHD), a coiled-coiled dimerization motif, and a carboxyl-terminal guanylyl cyclase domain (6Lucas K.A.

Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 215-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Full-length NPR-A exists as a homodimer, and ligand binding does not promote further oligomerization (18Chinkers M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18589-18597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lowe D.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10421-10425Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast, hormone binding to a truncated monomeric extracellular form of NPR-A does stimulate dimerization (20Misono K.S. Sivasubramanian N. Berkner K. Zhang X. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 516-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), indicating that ligand coupling causes a significant tightening of the extracellular dimeric contacts between the two monomers. Recent data suggest that the intramolecular disulfide bond formed between Cys423 and Cys432 is critical for hormonal activation of NPR-A (21Huo X. Abe T. Misono K.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16941-16951Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22McLabrecque J. Nicoll N. Marquis M. De Lean A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9752-9759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ANP- and disulfide-dependent dimerization of a mutant form of NPR-A containing an unpaired Cys in place of Asp435 has recently been demonstrated, suggesting that one consequence of hormone binding is the packing of the extracellular juxtamembrane portions of the two monomers in closer proximity to each other. This “tightening” is presumably transduced across the membrane, where it facilitates ATP binding to the KHD, which alleviates the basal KHD-mediated repression of the cyclase domain. NPR-A is phosphorylated on four serine and two threonine residues within a 17-amino acid stretch of its KHD (23Potter L.R. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2164-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Replacement of any of these phosphorylated amino acids with alanine to mimic the uncharged nature of a dephosphorylated residue results in losses in hormone-dependent guanylyl cyclase activities. Receptors lacking four or more of these sites are completely unresponsive to ANP, which indicates that phosphorylation of the KHD is required for NPR-A activation. In the continued presence of natriuretic peptide, the guanylyl cyclase activity of NPR-A wanes (24Cahill P.A. Redmond E.M. Keenan A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21896-21906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Woods M. Houslay M.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 26Yasunari K.

Vande Woude G.F. O'Connor P.M. Appella E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6048-6053Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 42Guthridge M.A. Bellosta P. Tavoloni N. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5485-5498Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Likewise, because of its disparate expression pattern compared with NPR-A (high in skeletal muscle and testis but low in kidney and lung), PP2Cγ seems an unlikely candidate. Similarly, the fact that manganese but not magnesium is required to activate PP2Cδ and CaMKIIPase appears to eliminate these phosphatases from consideration as well (43Ishida A. Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1904-1910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar,44Tong Y. Quirion R. Shen S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35282-35290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is not clear which of the two remaining PP2C family members regulates NPR-A, but because an antibody that recognizes PP2Cα and some PP2Cβ alternative splicing forms detected significant amounts of PP2C in membranes from baby hamster kidney cells, these two isoforms are prime candidates.One puzzling finding that we made during the course of these studies is that high concentrations of NaF (50 mm) did not affect the ANP/ATP-dependent guanylyl cyclase activity of NPR-A in time course experiments such as those shown in Fig. 1. This led us to suspect that the microcystin-sensitive phosphatase was novel because, to our knowledge, there are no known microcystin- or okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatases that are not also inhibited by NaF. However, when we subsequently tested the ability of NaF to inhibit the loss of NPR-A activity in the two-stage assay, we found that it completely blocked the temperature- and magnesium-dependent losses in cyclase activity. The reason for the discrepancy is not known at the moment, but it may be related to the fact the cyclase reaction mixture in the time course experiment contains compounds that might bind and decrease the amount of free fluoride available to inhibit the phosphatases. Alternatively, it may be that the receptor is rapidly rephosphorylated in the time course experiment due to the presence of ATP and magnesium. At the moment, a definitive explanation for these results is unavailable.In two of the three systems tested, ANP binding markedly decreased subsequent ANP/ATP-dependent guanylyl cyclase activities, suggesting either that hormone binding stimulates receptor dephosphorylation or that a liganded receptor is a better substrate for dephosphorylation. The reason for diminished effect in the 293 cells is not known, but it may be related to the fact that NPR-A in these cells is only slightly inhibited by phorbol ester treatment. 2L. R. Potter, unpublished observation. In our opinion, the mouse kidney membranes are the best model system to reproduce the regulation of NPR-A in vivo because they express physiologic amounts of the receptor and, unlike the transfected cells, express the necessary kinases and phosphatases in the appropriate stoichiometries. However, of the two established stable cell lines, it appears that the 3T3-NPR-A cell line is better suited for studies on the desensitization of NPR-A because it is regulated more like NPR-A in the mouse kidney membranes.Finally, it will be interesting to determine the relative contribution of these phosphatases to the dephosphorylation of NPR-A that is initiated by homologous and heterologous stimuli. Recently, Joubert et al. (28Joubert S. Labrecque J. De Lean A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11096-11105Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) reported that ANP-dependent dephosphorylation of NPR-A in whole transfected 293 cells results primarily from the inactivation of the NPR-A kinase, with little contribution from increased phosphatase activity. These data are completely consistent with our findings in the 293-NPR-A model system. Whether this is a general phenomenon or restricted to 293 cells remains to be determined, but our data using membranes from mouse kidneys and NIH3T3 cells suggest that ANP binding may increase NPR-A phosphatase activity as well. In this report, we have documented the dephosphorylation of NPR-A by two distinct protein phosphatase activities. One does not require magnesium for activity but is sensitive to microcystin/okadaic acid-like inhibitors and has been described previously by Foster and Garbers (38Foster D.C. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16311-16318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) as well as by our laboratory (31Potter L.R. Hunter T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1811-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The other phosphatase does require magnesium for activity but is not inhibited by microcystin and has not been described previously. The identity of the former phosphatase is not known, but based on its sensitivity to microcystin, PP1, PP2A, PP4, PP5, or PP6 are reasonable candidates (36Herzig S. Neumann J. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 173-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 37Sheppeck II, J.E. Gauss C.M. Chamberlin A.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 1739-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In contrast to the microcystin-sensitive phosphatase, potential candidates for the magnesium-dependent phosphatase are limited to members of two families, PP2C or PP7, because these are the only known serine/threonine phosphatases that require magnesium for activity and are not inhibited by microcystin. Based on tissue distribution, we can eliminate PP7 from consideration because its expression is restricted to the retina (40Huang X. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1462-1468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), whereas NPR-A expression is widespread. Hence, it is likely that the magnesium-dependent NPR-A phosphatase is a member of the PP2C family.

https://openalex.org/W2032518813,"Acute irrepairable UV-induced DNA damage leads to apoptosis of epidermal keratinocytes (KC) and the formation of sunburn cells, whereas less severely damaged cells survive but harbor the potential of tumor formation. Here we report that hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) prevents UVB-induced apoptosis in primary KC cultured in vitro. When we analyzed the signaling pathways initiated by the HGF/SF receptor c-met, we found that the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and its downstream-element AKT and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase were activated. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase led to a complete abrogation of the anti-apoptotic effect of HGF/SF, whereas blockade of the MAP kinase pathway had no effect. In contrast to the observation with primary KC, HGF/SF could not enhance survival after UVB irradiation of HaCaT and A431 cell lines, despite the fact that in these cells the PI 3-kinase and MAP kinase pathways were also activated by HGF/SF. Cell cycle analysis of KC revealed a G2/M arrest after UVB irradiation and a complete loss of proliferating cells. Because HGF/SF in the skin is produced by dermal fibroblasts, our findings suggest that the HGF/SF-mediated rescue of KC from apoptosis represents an important paracrine loop by which UVB-damaged KC can be kept alive to maintain the epidermal barrier function but cannot further proliferate, thereby preventing the induction of epithelial skin tumors.

It was first identified as a potent mitogen for hepatocytes (1.Montesano R. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Orci L. Cell. 1991; 67: 901-908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar, 2.Nakamura T. Nishizawa T. Hagiya M. Seki T. Shimonishi M. Sugimura A. Tashiro K. Shimizu S. Nature. 1989; 342: 440-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar), and more recently it was shown to promote cell motility and proliferation of KC, melanocytes, and kidney epithelial cells (for review see Ref.3.Rubin J.S. Bottaro D.P. Aaronson S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HGF/SF is able to induce scattering of cells (4.Stoker M. Gherardi E. Perryman M. Gray J. Nature. 1987; 327: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar) and their invasion into extracellular matrix (5.Giordano S. Zhen Z. Medico E. Gaudino G. Galimi F. Comoglio P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 649-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), thereby promoting tumor metastasis (6.Jeffers M. Rong S. Vande W.G. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Recently HGF/SF has been shown to promote or inhibit apoptosis depending on the cell type. For example, in the renal epithelial cell line HKC, HGF/SF acts as a survival factor after serum withdrawal (8.Liu Y. Sun A.M. Dworkin L.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 821-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 9.Yo Y. Morishita R. Nakamura S. Tomita N. Yamamoto K. Moriguchi A. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Higaki J. Ogihara T. Kidney.

Matsumoto K. Nagata S. Tsujimoto Y. Nakamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).The receptor for HGF/SF is a heterodimeric tyrosine kinase encoded by the c-met proto-oncogene, consisting of a 50-kDa extracellular α-subunit and a 145-kDa transmembrane β-subunit (12.Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Faletto D.L. Chan A.M. Kmiecik T.E. Vande W.G. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1991; 251: 802-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2066) Google Scholar). c-met signaling is mediated by autophosphorylation on Tyr1334 and Tyr1335 of the β-subunit, which leads to a strong up-regulation of its kinase activity (13.Longati P. Bardelli A. Ponzetto C. Naldini L. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, a multifunctional docking site for adaptor molecules on the C-terminal tail of the β-subunit becomes phosphorylated at the tyrosine residues on position Tyr1349 and Tyr1356. Their phosphorylation leads to interaction of c-met with several cytoplasmic signal transducers. This occurs either directly, such as with the PI 3-kinase, or indirectly via molecular adapters such as Grb2 (14.Ponzetto C. Zhen Z. Audero E. Maina F. Bardelli A. Basile M.L. Giordano S.

Battistini C. Comoglio P.M. Nature. 1998; 391: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The MAP kinase pathway has been shown to be responsible for cell growth (14.Ponzetto C. Zhen Z.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14119-14123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), whereas the phosphorylation of STAT-3 and the resulting nuclear signaling is required for triggering differentiation for branching morphogenesis (17.Boccaccio C. Ando M. Tamagnone L. Bardelli A. Michieli P. Battistini C. Comoglio P.M. Nature. 1998; 391: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The PI 3-kinase pathway is responsible for cell scattering by inducing the loss of intercellular junctions and cell migration (18.Royal I. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27780-27787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This pathway has recently been shown to also be involved in the anti-apoptotic activity of HGF/SF in renal tubular epithelial cell line (19.Liu Y.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F624-F633PubMed Google Scholar), in hepatocytes (20.Webster C.R. Anwer M.S. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (21.Xiao G.H. Jeffers M. Bellacosa A. Mitsuuchi Y. Vande Woude G.F. Testa J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar).For the skin, UV irradiation is the most important DNA damaging stimulus and represents the major risk factor for the development of epithelial skin tumors (22.Kraemer K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Whereas mild UV-induced damage induces DNA repair, severe UV exposure leads to irrepairable DNA damage resulting in KC apoptosis and the formation of sunburn cells (23.Brash D.E. Ziegler A. Jonason A.S. Simon J.A. Kunala S. Leffell D.J. J. Investig. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 1996; 1: 136-142PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Schwarz A. Bhardwaj R. Aragane Y. Mahnke K. Riemann H. Metze D. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 922-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this UV-induced apoptosis contributes to the homeostasis of the epidermis and helps to prevent skin cancer by preferentially eliminating DNA-damaged KC (25.Brash D.E. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 525-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, because a substantial loss of keratinocytes would result in a life-threatening damage of the skin barrier function, we are interested in mechanisms that counteract UV-induced KC apoptosis. In the present study we demonstrate that HGF/SF inhibits UV-induced apoptosis of KC and arrests them irreversibly in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle.DISCUSSIONApoptosis is the consequence of a genetically determined cell death program that can be initiated by a number of stimuli such as growth factor withdrawal, signaling through apoptotic receptors, or cell damaging stress (for review see Ref. 30.Rich T. Watson C.J. Wyllie A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 69-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Induction of apoptosis by DNA damaging agents plays a central role in the elimination of genetically altered cells, contributing to the inhibition of tumor development (23.Brash D.E. Ziegler A. Jonason A.S. Simon J.A. Kunala S. Leffell D.J. J. Investig. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 1996; 1: 136-142PubMed Google Scholar). In the skin UV irradiation is the most relevant DNA damaging stimulus and represents the major risk factor for the development of epithelial skin tumors (22.Kraemer K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Whereas mild UV-induced damage induces DNA repair, severe UV exposure leads to irrepairable DNA damage resulting in KC apoptosis and the formation of sunburn cells (23.Brash D.E. Ziegler A. Jonason A.S. Simon J.A. Kunala S. Leffell D.J. J. Investig. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 1996; 1: 136-142PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Schwarz A. Bhardwaj R. Aragane Y. Mahnke K. Riemann H. Metze D. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 922-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar).In the present study, we demonstrate that UVB-induced apoptosis of human KC in primary culture is completely inhibited by HGF/SF in the absence of other growth factors. In contrast to primary KC, identical treatment had no effect on the survival of the two autonomously growing KC-derived cell lines HaCaT and A431. In our experiments, we identified the PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway as the one responsible for conferring UV resistance to KC, i.e. both wortmannin and LY294002 completely abolished the anti-apoptotic effect of HGF/SF. This part of our data complements recent data by others who showed that HGF/SF confers protection against apoptosis of a renal epithelial cell line (19.Liu Y.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F624-F633PubMed Google Scholar), of NIH 3T3 cells (21.Xiao G.H. Jeffers M. Bellacosa A. Mitsuuchi Y. Vande Woude G.F. Testa J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), and of hepatocytes (20.Webster C.R. Anwer M.S. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) via the PI 3-kinase pathway. Blockade of the MAP kinase pathway by PD98059 had no effect on KC survival, which was surprising because activation of this pathway by insulin-like growth factor-1 has been shown to protect KC against UV-induced apoptosis (31.Kuhn C. Hurwitz S.A. Kumar M.G. Cotton J. Spandau D.F. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).Our finding that HGF/SF, although protecting KC, could not prevent apoptosis of A431 and HaCaT cells was unexpected because Tang et al. (32.Tang K.Q. Nie D.T. Cai Y.L. Honn K.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) have recently reported that activating the PI 3-kinase pathway via β4 integrin protects A431 cells from apoptosis. Our data exclude the possibility that the lack of protection was due to an impaired PI 3-kinase signaling, because we demonstrated that like in primary KC, activation via c-met led to AKT phosphorylation in A431 and HaCaT cells. In the light of the data of Tang et al., namely that the PI 3-kinase pathway is functional in prevention of apoptosis in A431 cells, our results suggest that in these cells, either pathways downstream of AKT cannot be activated efficiently via c-met or its activation does not lead to protection from UV-mediated apoptosis. As to the first possibility, although we could demonstrate that the MAP kinase signaling and although the activation of AKT via c-met is intact in all three cell types analyzed, we cannot rule out at present that the signaling downstream of AKT is disturbed. Phosphorylation of AKT leads to the activation and inactivation of several factors that have been shown to be involved in the induction or prevention of apoptosis. For example GSK-3, a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine protein kinase (33.Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar); FKHR, a member of the Forkhead family of transcription factors (33.Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 34.Rena G. Guo S. Cichy S.C. Unterman T.G. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17179-17183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar); and Bad, an apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family (35.Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4915) Google Scholar), are molecules that become phosphorylated by activated AKT. If any or a combination of these pathways is disturbed in the KC-derived cell lines, then no signal transduction would take place despite the presence of a functional receptor. Our finding that the amount of phosphorylated AKT was considerably lower in the cell lines than in KC suggests that in the cell lines activation of the downstream pathway might be less effective than in KC. As to the second possibility, it is tempting to speculate that different triggers of apoptosis, i.e. UV-induced DNA damage, as opposed to lack of membrane signaling via integrins might account for differing protection by HGF/SF in these cells. However, further studies will be necessary to test this hypothesis.Furthermore, with regard to the observed differences between primary cells and autonomously growing cell lines, different pathways of cell death signaling might be the cause for the distinct anti-apoptotic effects of HGF/SF. Both HaCaT and A431 cells contain mutations in the p53 gene, which plays a central role in UV-induced apoptosis (36.Henseleit U. Zhang J. Wanner R. Haase I. Kolde G. Rosenbach T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 722-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 37.Reiss M. Brash D.E. Munoz A.T. Simon J.A. Ziegler A. Vellucci V.F. Zhou Z.L. Oncol. Res. 1992; 4: 349-357PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is highly probable that UV-induced DNA damage leads to apoptosis via p53-dependent and -independent pathways in primary cells and cell lines, respectively. That indeed DNA damage and not UV-induced membrane effects such as the clustering of CD95 (38.Aragane Y. Kulms D. Metze D. Wilkes G. Poppelmann B. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) was the primary responsible apoptotic trigger in our experiments is strongly suggested by our finding that UV-induced apoptosis occurred after irradiation of cells at 25 °C as well as at 4 °C (data not shown). Irradiation at 4 °C blocks UVB-induced CD95 clustering but has no effect on UV-mediated DNA damage (38.Aragane Y. Kulms D. Metze D. Wilkes G. Poppelmann B. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar).As to the biological implications of our findings, it is important to keep in mind that in the skin dermal fibroblasts are a powerful source for HGF/SF (39.Stoker M. Perryman M. J. Cell Sci. 1985; 77: 209-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HGF/SF production is induced in these cells after stimulation with phorbol ester (40.Gohda E. Kataoka H. Tsubouchi H. Daikilara Y. Yamamoto I. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), interleukin-1 (41.Matsumoto K. Okazaki H. Nakamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and tumor necrosis factor-α (42.Tamura M. Arakaki N. Tsubouchi H. Takada H. Daikuhara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8140-8145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because production the latter two factors by KC is induced by UV irradiation (43.Kupper T.S. Chua A.O. Flood P. McGuire J. Gubler U. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 44.Kock A. Schwarz T. Kirnbauer R. Urbanski A. Perry P. Ansel J.C. Luger T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1609-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), their secretion would result in the triggering of HGF/SF production by fibroblasts and the establishment of a paracrine loop between epidermal and dermal symbionts, allowing the survival of KC after UV injury.UV-induced apoptosis is thought to contribute to skin homeostasis by preferentially eliminating KC with irreparable DNA damage,i.e. potentially precancerous cells, and has been referred to as “cellular proofreading” (25.Brash D.E. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 525-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), in analogy to proofreading and excision of incorrect base pairs during DNA synthesis. Indeed, mice that are deficient in p53 and therefore have a decreased capacity of DNA repair show a decreased tendency of sunburn cell formation and are more susceptible to the development of UV-induced tumors (45.Hill L.L. Ouhtit A. Loughlin S.M. Kripke M.L. Ananthaswamy H.N. Owen S.L. Science. 1999; 285: 898-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). For this reason UV-induced KC apoptosis by itself cannot merely be regarded as a harmful event but is thought to help reduce or prevent skin carcinogenesis (25.Brash D.E. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 525-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 45.Hill L.L. Ouhtit A. Loughlin S.M. Kripke M.L. Ananthaswamy H.N. Owen S.L. Science. 1999; 285: 898-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Protection of KC by the inhibition of apoptosis might therefore be a double-edged sword potentially favoring the survival of cells with DNA damage. A possibility to circumvent such a harmful scenario would be that HGF/SF-protected KC enter a postmitotic state. We could show in our experiments that KC protected by HGF/SF do not further proliferate in vitro. If this holds true in vivo, these cells would be removed from the replicating population, thereby reducing the risk of transformation while keeping them alive and thus maintaining the integrity of the skin barrier. With regard to the differences observed between cells in primary culture and cell lines bearing p53 mutations, it is tempting to speculate that HGF/SF might preferentially protect nontransformed KCin vivo while leaving transformed cells to be eliminated by UV irradiation, implying a possible beneficial effect of strong UV irradiation in the removal of precancerous epithelial skin lesions.

It was first identified as a potent mitogen for hepatocytes (1.Montesano R. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Orci L.

Bottaro D.P. Aaronson S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HGF/SF is able to induce scattering of cells (4.Stoker M. Gherardi E. Perryman M. Gray J. Nature. 1987; 327: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar) and their invasion into extracellular matrix (5.Giordano S. Zhen Z. Medico E. Gaudino G. Galimi F.

Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Recently HGF/SF has been shown to promote or inhibit apoptosis depending on the cell type. For example, in the renal epithelial cell line HKC, HGF/SF acts as a survival factor after serum withdrawal (8.Liu Y. Sun A.M. Dworkin L.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Science. 1991; 251: 802-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2066) Google Scholar). c-met signaling is mediated by autophosphorylation on Tyr1334 and Tyr1335 of the β-subunit, which leads to a strong up-regulation of its kinase activity (13.Longati P. Bardelli A. Ponzetto C. Naldini L. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, a multifunctional docking site for adaptor molecules on the C-terminal tail of the β-subunit becomes phosphorylated at the tyrosine residues on position Tyr1349 and Tyr1356. Their phosphorylation leads to interaction of c-met with several cytoplasmic signal transducers. This occurs either directly, such as with the PI 3-kinase, or indirectly via molecular adapters such as Grb2 (14.Ponzetto C. Zhen Z. Audero E. Maina F. Bardelli A. Basile M.L. Giordano S.

The PI 3-kinase pathway is responsible for cell scattering by inducing the loss of intercellular junctions and cell migration (18.Royal I. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27780-27787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This pathway has recently been shown to also be involved in the anti-apoptotic activity of HGF/SF in renal tubular epithelial cell line (19.Liu Y.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F624-F633PubMed Google Scholar), in hepatocytes (20.Webster C.R. Anwer M.S. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (21.Xiao G.H. Jeffers M. Bellacosa A. Mitsuuchi Y. Vande Woude G.F. Testa J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). For the skin, UV irradiation is the most important DNA damaging stimulus and represents the major risk factor for the development of epithelial skin tumors (22.Kraemer K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Whereas mild UV-induced damage induces DNA repair, severe UV exposure leads to irrepairable DNA damage resulting in KC apoptosis and the formation of sunburn cells (23.Brash D.E. Ziegler A.

Schwarz T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 922-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this UV-induced apoptosis contributes to the homeostasis of the epidermis and helps to prevent skin cancer by preferentially eliminating DNA-damaged KC (25.Brash D.E. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 525-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, because a substantial loss of keratinocytes would result in a life-threatening damage of the skin barrier function, we are interested in mechanisms that counteract UV-induced KC apoptosis. In the present study we demonstrate that HGF/SF inhibits UV-induced apoptosis of KC and arrests them irreversibly in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. DISCUSSIONApoptosis is the consequence of a genetically determined cell death program that can be initiated by a number of stimuli such as growth factor withdrawal, signaling through apoptotic receptors, or cell damaging stress (for review see Ref. 30.Rich T. Watson C.J. Wyllie A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 69-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Induction of apoptosis by DNA damaging agents plays a central role in the elimination of genetically altered cells, contributing to the inhibition of tumor development (23.Brash D.E. Ziegler A. Jonason A.S. Simon J.A. Kunala S. Leffell D.J. J. Investig. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 1996; 1: 136-142PubMed Google Scholar). In the skin UV irradiation is the most relevant DNA damaging stimulus and represents the major risk factor for the development of epithelial skin tumors (22.Kraemer K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Whereas mild UV-induced damage induces DNA repair, severe UV exposure leads to irrepairable DNA damage resulting in KC apoptosis and the formation of sunburn cells (23.Brash D.E. Ziegler A.

Schwarz T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 922-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar).In the present study, we demonstrate that UVB-induced apoptosis of human KC in primary culture is completely inhibited by HGF/SF in the absence of other growth factors. In contrast to primary KC, identical treatment had no effect on the survival of the two autonomously growing KC-derived cell lines HaCaT and A431. In our experiments, we identified the PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway as the one responsible for conferring UV resistance to KC, i.e. both wortmannin and LY294002 completely abolished the anti-apoptotic effect of HGF/SF. This part of our data complements recent data by others who showed that HGF/SF confers protection against apoptosis of a renal epithelial cell line (19.Liu Y.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F624-F633PubMed Google Scholar), of NIH 3T3 cells (21.Xiao G.H. Jeffers M. Bellacosa A. Mitsuuchi Y. Vande Woude G.F. Testa J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), and of hepatocytes (20.Webster C.R. Anwer M.S. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) via the PI 3-kinase pathway. Blockade of the MAP kinase pathway by PD98059 had no effect on KC survival, which was surprising because activation of this pathway by insulin-like growth factor-1 has been shown to protect KC against UV-induced apoptosis (31.Kuhn C. Hurwitz S.A. Kumar M.G. Cotton J. Spandau D.F. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).Our finding that HGF/SF, although protecting KC, could not prevent apoptosis of A431 and HaCaT cells was unexpected because Tang et al. (32.Tang K.Q. Nie D.T. Cai Y.L. Honn K.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) have recently reported that activating the PI 3-kinase pathway via β4 integrin protects A431 cells from apoptosis. Our data exclude the possibility that the lack of protection was due to an impaired PI 3-kinase signaling, because we demonstrated that like in primary KC, activation via c-met led to AKT phosphorylation in A431 and HaCaT cells. In the light of the data of Tang et al., namely that the PI 3-kinase pathway is functional in prevention of apoptosis in A431 cells, our results suggest that in these cells, either pathways downstream of AKT cannot be activated efficiently via c-met or its activation does not lead to protection from UV-mediated apoptosis. As to the first possibility, although we could demonstrate that the MAP kinase signaling and although the activation of AKT via c-met is intact in all three cell types analyzed, we cannot rule out at present that the signaling downstream of AKT is disturbed. Phosphorylation of AKT leads to the activation and inactivation of several factors that have been shown to be involved in the induction or prevention of apoptosis. For example GSK-3, a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine protein kinase (33.Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar); FKHR, a member of the Forkhead family of transcription factors (33.Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 34.Rena G. Guo S. Cichy S.C. Unterman T.G. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17179-17183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar); and Bad, an apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family (35.Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4915) Google Scholar), are molecules that become phosphorylated by activated AKT. If any or a combination of these pathways is disturbed in the KC-derived cell lines, then no signal transduction would take place despite the presence of a functional receptor. Our finding that the amount of phosphorylated AKT was considerably lower in the cell lines than in KC suggests that in the cell lines activation of the downstream pathway might be less effective than in KC. As to the second possibility, it is tempting to speculate that different triggers of apoptosis, i.e. UV-induced DNA damage, as opposed to lack of membrane signaling via integrins might account for differing protection by HGF/SF in these cells. However, further studies will be necessary to test this hypothesis.Furthermore, with regard to the observed differences between primary cells and autonomously growing cell lines, different pathways of cell death signaling might be the cause for the distinct anti-apoptotic effects of HGF/SF. Both HaCaT and A431 cells contain mutations in the p53 gene, which plays a central role in UV-induced apoptosis (36.Henseleit U. Zhang J. Wanner R. Haase I. Kolde G. Rosenbach T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 722-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 37.Reiss M. Brash D.E. Munoz A.T. Simon J.A. Ziegler A. Vellucci V.F. Zhou Z.L. Oncol.

Therefore, it is highly probable that UV-induced DNA damage leads to apoptosis via p53-dependent and -independent pathways in primary cells and cell lines, respectively.

Our data exclude the possibility that the lack of protection was due to an impaired PI 3-kinase signaling, because we demonstrated that like in primary KC, activation via c-met led to AKT phosphorylation in A431 and HaCaT cells. In the light of the data of Tang et al., namely that the PI 3-kinase pathway is functional in prevention of apoptosis in A431 cells, our results suggest that in these cells, either pathways downstream of AKT cannot be activated efficiently via c-met or its activation does not lead to protection from UV-mediated apoptosis. As to the first possibility, although we could demonstrate that the MAP kinase signaling and although the activation of AKT via c-met is intact in all three cell types analyzed, we cannot rule out at present that the signaling downstream of AKT is disturbed. Phosphorylation of AKT leads to the activation and inactivation of several factors that have been shown to be involved in the induction or prevention of apoptosis. For example GSK-3, a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine protein kinase (33.Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar); FKHR, a member of the Forkhead family of transcription factors (33.Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 34.Rena G. Guo S. Cichy S.C. Unterman T.G. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17179-17183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar); and Bad, an apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family (35.Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4915) Google Scholar), are molecules that become phosphorylated by activated AKT. If any or a combination of these pathways is disturbed in the KC-derived cell lines, then no signal transduction would take place despite the presence of a functional receptor. Our finding that the amount of phosphorylated AKT was considerably lower in the cell lines than in KC suggests that in the cell lines activation of the downstream pathway might be less effective than in KC. As to the second possibility, it is tempting to speculate that different triggers of apoptosis, i.e. UV-induced DNA damage, as opposed to lack of membrane signaling via integrins might account for differing protection by HGF/SF in these cells. However, further studies will be necessary to test this hypothesis. Furthermore, with regard to the observed differences between primary cells and autonomously growing cell lines, different pathways of cell death signaling might be the cause for the distinct anti-apoptotic effects of HGF/SF. Both HaCaT and A431 cells contain mutations in the p53 gene, which plays a central role in UV-induced apoptosis (36.Henseleit U. Zhang J. Wanner R. Haase I. Kolde G. Rosenbach T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 722-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 37.Reiss M. Brash D.E. Munoz A.T. Simon J.A. Ziegler A. Vellucci V.F. Zhou Z.L. Oncol. Res. 1992; 4: 349-357PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is highly probable that UV-induced DNA damage leads to apoptosis via p53-dependent and -independent pathways in primary cells and cell lines, respectively. That indeed DNA damage and not UV-induced membrane effects such as the clustering of CD95 (38.Aragane Y. Kulms D. Metze D. Wilkes G. Poppelmann B. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) was the primary responsible apoptotic trigger in our experiments is strongly suggested by our finding that UV-induced apoptosis occurred after irradiation of cells at 25 °C as well as at 4 °C (data not shown). Irradiation at 4 °C blocks UVB-induced CD95 clustering but has no effect on UV-mediated DNA damage (38.Aragane Y. Kulms D. Metze D. Wilkes G. Poppelmann B. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). As to the biological implications of our findings, it is important to keep in mind that in the skin dermal fibroblasts are a powerful source for HGF/SF (39.Stoker M. Perryman M. J. Cell Sci. 1985; 77: 209-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HGF/SF production is induced in these cells after stimulation with phorbol ester (40.Gohda E. Kataoka H. Tsubouchi H. Daikilara Y. Yamamoto I. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), interleukin-1 (41.Matsumoto K. Okazaki H. Nakamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and tumor necrosis factor-α (42.Tamura M. Arakaki N. Tsubouchi H. Takada H. Daikuhara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8140-8145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because production the latter two factors by KC is induced by UV irradiation (43.Kupper T.S. Chua A.O. Flood P. McGuire J. Gubler U. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 44.Kock A. Schwarz T. Kirnbauer R. Urbanski A. Perry P. Ansel J.C. Luger T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1609-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), their secretion would result in the triggering of HGF/SF production by fibroblasts and the establishment of a paracrine loop between epidermal and dermal symbionts, allowing the survival of KC after UV injury. UV-induced apoptosis is thought to contribute to skin homeostasis by preferentially eliminating KC with irreparable DNA damage,i.e. potentially precancerous cells, and has been referred to as “cellular proofreading” (25.Brash D.E. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 525-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), in analogy to proofreading and excision of incorrect base pairs during DNA synthesis. Indeed, mice that are deficient in p53 and therefore have a decreased capacity of DNA repair show a decreased tendency of sunburn cell formation and are more susceptible to the development of UV-induced tumors (45.Hill L.L. Ouhtit A. Loughlin S.M. Kripke M.L. Ananthaswamy H.N. Owen S.L. Science. 1999; 285: 898-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). For this reason UV-induced KC apoptosis by itself cannot merely be regarded as a harmful event but is thought to help reduce or prevent skin carcinogenesis (25.Brash D.E. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 525-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 45.Hill L.L. Ouhtit A. Loughlin S.M. Kripke M.L. Ananthaswamy H.N. Owen S.L. Science. 1999; 285: 898-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Protection of KC by the inhibition of apoptosis might therefore be a double-edged sword potentially favoring the survival of cells with DNA damage. A possibility to circumvent such a harmful scenario would be that HGF/SF-protected KC enter a postmitotic state. We could show in our experiments that KC protected by HGF/SF do not further proliferate in vitro. If this holds true in vivo, these cells would be removed from the replicating population, thereby reducing the risk of transformation while keeping them alive and thus maintaining the integrity of the skin barrier. With regard to the differences observed between cells in primary culture and cell lines bearing p53 mutations, it is tempting to speculate that HGF/SF might preferentially protect nontransformed KCin vivo while leaving transformed cells to be eliminated by UV irradiation, implying a possible beneficial effect of strong UV irradiation in the removal of precancerous epithelial skin lesions.

Cyclosporin A inhibited phosphate-induced CL fusion, whereas Pronase pretreatment of mitochondria abolished it, suggesting that mitochondrial permeability transition pore and protein(s) are involved in the fusion process.

The role of mitochondria in neurodegenerative disease has been increasingly supported (1.Wallace D.C. Science. 1999; 283: 1482-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2630) Google Scholar).

Despite the complexity of the mechanisms involved, mitochondria appear to provide a link between the initiator caspases and the downstream effector caspases. Mitochondria release apoptosis-inducing factors that trigger DNA fragmentation of isolated nuclei (4.Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Castedo M. Hirsch T. Marchetti P. Macho A. Daugas E. Geuskens M. Kroemer G.

It is known that these molecules are bound to the inner mitochondrial membrane, whose integrity appears to be essential for mitochondrial functions. Cardiolipin (CL) is present only within the inner mitochondrial membrane, strictly associated to mitochondrial electron transport complexes and transporters (10.Robinson N.C. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The specific requirement of heart cytochrome c oxidase for CL has been demonstrated (11.Sedlák E. Robinson N.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14966-14972Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The small basic protein cytochrome c specifically binds to CL (12.Shidoji Y. Hayashi K. Komura S. Ohishi N. Yagi K.

Yang J. Jones D.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), both proteins must be sensitive to CL lipid matrix. Studies on the release of cytochrome c from the inner mitochondrial membrane indicate that peroxidation of CL causes disruption of the molecular interaction between CL and the protein (12.Shidoji Y. Hayashi K. Komura S. Ohishi N. Yagi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Degradation of mitochondrial CL occurs during p53-induced apoptosis (15.Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar) or in mitochondrial damage induced by nitric oxide in human leukemia cells (16.Ushmorov A. Ratter F. Lehmann V. Dröge W. Schirrmacher V. Umansky V. Blood. 1999; 93: 2342-2352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A significant decrease in CL and other phospholipids was observed in brain mitochondria during ischemia (17.Nakahara I. Kikuchi H. Taki W. Nishi S. Kito M. Yonekawa Y. Goto Y. Ogata N. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 839-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A genetic model system to study the role of anionic phospholipids in yeast mitochondria indicates that the complete lack of CL causes a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential (18.Jang F.

In aged rat heart mitochondria, cytochrome c oxidase activity is restored to the level of the young control by exogenous CL (20.Paradies G. Ruggiero F.M. Petrosillo G. Quagliariello E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 136-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In this study, the ability of mitochondria to acquire CL, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and phosphatidylserine (PS) from exogenous sources in vitro through a fusion process was demonstrated. The fusion rate was dependent both on the nature of lipids and on the respiratory state of mitochondria. The acquired phospholipids specifically influenced both the transmembrane potential of mitochondria and the release of cytochrome c. Octadecyl rhodamine B chloride (R18), 3,3′-diexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6(3)), and 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1) were from Molecular Probes Europe BV. Pronase, digitonin, carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), 3,6-bis(dimethylamino) acridine (acridine orange; AO), and 10-N-nonyl-3,6-bis(dimethylamino) acridine (NAO) were from Fluka Chemie AG (Italy). Hepes, cytochrome c, complete protease inhibitor mixture, ADP (K+ salt), pyruvic acid, and malic acid were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Pyruvic acid and malic acid solutions were adjusted to pH 7.0 with KOH. Cyclosporin A, CL, PG, and bovine brain PS were obtained from Sigma. Prior to use, phospholipids were purified by column chromatography (21.Rouser G. Kritchevsky G. Yamamoto A. Marinetti G.V. Lipid Chromatographic Analysis. 1. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1967: 99-161Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-cytochrome c polyclonal IgG and donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Mitochondria were prepared from rat brain cortex as previously described (22.Monni M. Corazzi L Migliorati G. Roberti R. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 173: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 0.32 m sucrose, 2 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) (S/H buffer), and biochemical characterization was performed as described (22.Monni M. Corazzi L Migliorati G. Roberti R. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 173: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In some experiments, Pronase treatment of mitochondria was performed by incubating mitochondria (1 mg of protein in 1 ml of S/H buffer) with Pronase (25 μg) at room temperature for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding protease inhibitor mixture (0.5 μg) and pelletting by centrifuging 10 min at 9,000 ×g. Respiratory activity of mitochondria was modulated with ADP (0.8 mm), with pyruvate and malate (1.5 and 3.0 mm, respectively), or with ADP, pyruvate, and malate (0.8, 1.5, and 3.0 mm, respectively, state 3). When specified, potassium phosphate was added. In the resting state, substrates and phosphate were omitted. An ethanolic solution of R18 (10 μl, 1 mg/ml) was added to 1 ml of mitochondrial suspension (1 mg of protein). The mixture was kept in the dark for 40 min at room temperature and chromatographed on a Sephadex G-50 column to remove the noninserted R18. In some experiments, Pronase treatment of mitochondria was performed before the insertion of R18. The amount of R18 incorporated was calculated by comparing R18 fluorescence of mitochondrial suspensions solubilized with 0.03% Thesit to that of standard R18 solutions. For R18 surface densities of ≤10 mmol/mol of membrane lipid, the fluorescence quenching of the probe was linearly related to surface density, thus allowing the determination of fusion extent (23.Camici O. Corazzi L. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 175: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). CL, PG, or PS unilamellar vesicles were prepared in S/H buffer by reverse phase evaporation (24.Szoka Jr., F. Papahadjopoulos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4194-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (2371) Google Scholar). Liposomes were sized by extrusion using polycarbonate Unipore membranes (0.1-μm pore size; Millipore Corp.). Phospholipid concentration was determined by phosphate assay (25.Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fusion was assayed in a cuvette containing S/H buffer, R18-loaded mitochondria (0.1 mg of protein), and liposomes (50 nmol lipid) in a final volume of 2 ml. After the addition of potassium phosphate and respiratory substrates, fusion was monitored by following fluorescence increments at 580 nm (λex, 560 nm) using a Shimadzu RF-5000 spectrofluorometer. Minimal initial fluorescence values of R18-mitochondria before starting fusion were set at 0%. Fluorescence in the presence of 0.03% Thesit was taken as 100%. Mitochondria (0.3 mg of protein) were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in the presence of respiratory substrates and CL liposomes (20 nmol of lipid), in S/H buffer (total volume 0.45 ml). To remove nonfused CL, samples were layered on 0.5 ml of 0.6 msucrose, centrifuged for 10 min at 11,000 × g, and the pellets were resuspended with 0.4 ml of S/H buffer. NAO probe was added to a final concentration of 50 μm, and samples were incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Each sample was then divided into two identical aliquots; one was treated with digitonin (0.4 mg/mg mitochondrial protein) to remove the outer mitochondrial membrane. After incubation in ice for 30 min with stirring, all samples were centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 20 min, and NAO fluorescence (λex, 494 nm; λem, 530 nm) was measured in mitoplasts and in the supernatant. The pH-sensitive dye AO was used to visualize the acidification of the intermembrane space of mitochondria. Mitochondria (0.6 ml, 0.8 mg of protein) were mixed with CL liposomes (15 nmol of lipid) in the presence of 5 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7.4), ADP, pyruvate, and malate. Potassium phosphate and respiratory substrates were omitted in controls (resting state). The mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C and centrifuged on 0.5 ml of 0.6 m sucrose for 10 min at 11,000 × g. Pellets were resuspended in 0.6 ml of S/H buffer, and aliquots (0.1 mg of protein) were placed in a cuvette containing S/H buffer (total volume, 1.5 ml). After the addition of AO (4 μm final concentration), the suspension was stirred for 2 min, and AO fluorescence (λex, 494 nm; λem, 530 nm) was measured. Mitochondrial swelling was determined by measuring the decrease of light scattering at 520 nm of a mitochondrial suspension (75 μg of protein in 1.5 ml of S/H buffer) in the presence of potassium phosphate and respiratory substrates, with or without 15 μm CCCP. In some experiments, mitochondria were pretreated for 5 min with cyclosporin A (5 μm). The loss of scattering induced by CCCP within 5 min was considered the maximal swelling value. Mitochondria (0.4 mg of protein) were incubated with CL, PG, or PS liposomes (20 nmol of lipid) in the presence of 5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4). Respiratory activity of mitochondria was started by adding ADP, pyruvate, and malate in a total volume of 0.2 ml. The mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, and lipid excess was eliminated by centrifugation on 0.5 ml of 0.6m sucrose, as described. Lipids were extracted from aliquots of mitochondria (26.Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and phosphorus was determined in phospholipid classes after separation by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography (22.Monni M. Corazzi L Migliorati G. Roberti R. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 173: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Mol % of CL was calculated taking into account 2 mol of phosphorus/mol of CL. Mixtures containing mitochondria (0.8 mg of protein), 0.5 μm DiOC6(3), 5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), and respiratory substrates (total volume, 0.5 ml) were preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Positive controls contained an additional 3 mm NaN3. After the addition of S/H buffer or CL liposomes (20 nmol of lipid), incubation was continued for 10 min. Samples were layered on 0.5 ml of 0.6 m sucrose and centrifuged for 10 min at 11,000 × g, and pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of S/H buffer. Aliquots of DiOC6(3)-loaded mitochondria (0.1 mg of protein in 0.2 ml of S/H buffer) were incubated at 37 °C for various times. At the fixed time, mitochondrial suspensions were centrifuged for 10 min at 9,000 × g, the pellets were resuspended in 0.2 ml of S/H buffer, and DiOC6(3) fluorescence was determined (λex, 484 nm; λem, 501 nm). For mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) determination, isolated mitochondria (0.3 mg of protein) were incubated for 5 min at room temperature in the dark, in the presence of 0.3 μm DiOC6(3) or 1 μm JC-1, in different respiratory conditions. CL, PG, or PS liposomes (20 nmol of lipid) were added, and fusion was allowed for 5 min at room temperature. Suspensions were analyzed immediately by flow cytometry analysis, using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems) equipped with a focused argon laser. For complete depletion of Δψm(positive control), the mitochondrial uncoupler CCCP (100 μm) was used. Data were analyzed and stored in a data management system (LYSYS software). DiOC6(3) green fluorescence (FL1) was plotted on a logarithmic scale versus the frequency of events. The mean value of the integral of fluorescence (IGFL) was also evaluated (22.Monni M. Corazzi L Migliorati G. Roberti R. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 173: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). JC-1 fluorescence of mitochondria was detected as described (27.Cossarizza A. Ceccarelli D. Masini A. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and red/green fluorescence emission (FL1/FL2) of particles was reported as a dot plot. For the cytofluorimetric analysis of CL content, mitochondria (0.3 mg of protein) were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with 0.3 μm NAO in different respiratory conditions. The green fluorescence (FL1) of the CL-specific dye was monitored as previously described. First, mitochondria (0.2 mg of protein) were incubated for 20 min at 20 °C in the presence of increasing potassium phosphate concentrations (pH 7.4). In some experiments, incubations were performed in S/H buffer without phosphate for up to 60 min at 37 °C. The mitochondrial pellet and the extramitochondrial medium were recovered by centrifugation for 10 min at 9,000 ×g. Next, mitochondria (0.2 mg of protein) were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence of 5 mm potassium phosphate, respiratory substrates, and liposomes (15 nmol of lipid). Controls were without liposomes. Samples were centrifuged on 0.5 ml of 0.6m sucrose as described. Recovered mitochondria were incubated for an additional 20 min at 37 °C in the presence of 20 mm potassium phosphate and centrifuged at 9,000 ×g for 10 min. In both experiments, pellets and supernatants were subjected to Western blot analysis, using anti-(cytochrome c) IgG. The specific interaction of NAO probe with CL was exploited to evaluate CL level in mitochondria incubated in different metabolic conditions. Mitochondria were loaded with NAO in the presence or absence of respiratory substrates and analyzed by cytofluorimetry. In the resting state, the fluorescence histogram was shifted to the left, compared with metabolically active mitochondria (Fig. 1), suggesting a loss of CL during incubation at low energy. Since CL decreased in the resting state, we examined the conditions required to supply CL from exogenous sources. Potassium phosphate, essential for mitochondrial respiration, was found to trigger the mixing of CL liposomes with the outer mitochondrial membrane. The fusion extent, measured as R18 fluorescence dequenching, increased up to 7 mm potassium phosphate and remained constant at higher concentrations (Fig. 2A). The same results were obtained when sodium phosphate replaced potassium phosphate. Respiratory substrates did not trigger fusion in the absence of phosphate but influenced the phosphate-dependent fusion. In fact, a mixture of ADP, malate, and pyruvate activated the process, whereas ADP was inhibitory (Fig. 2B). Exposure of mitochondria to 5 mm potassium phosphate resulted in slow mitochondrial swelling and mPTP opening, as suggested by a 5% decrease of light scattering. Mitochondrial swelling did not increase at potassium phosphate concentrations higher than 5 mm but increased after the addition of 10 μmCCCP, producing a 12% decrease of light scattering. Opening of the mPTP was not accompanied by cytochrome c release, observed only for phosphate concentrations higher than 10 mm (Fig. 3). Cyclosporin A negatively affected the kinetics of phosphate-triggered CL fusion to mitochondria (Fig. 4), indicating that mPTP was involved in liposome fusion. Phosphate was ineffective in promoting CL fusion with Pronase-treated mitochondria (Fig. 4).Figure 4Fusion kinetics of CL liposomes to R18-loaded mitochondria. Liposomes (50 nmol of lipid) were added to 2 ml of S/H buffer containing 5 mm potassium phosphate and control or Pronase-treated R18-mitochondria (0.1 mg of protein), and the elicited R18 fluorescence was monitored. The effect of cyclosporin A (cys A) (10 μm) on the fusion of CL with control mitochondria was evaluated. Pronase treatment of mitochondria was performed before the insertion of the fluorescent probe. Each sample presented the same maximal fluorescence intensity in the presence of 0.03% Thesit. A representative experiment of three is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether the ability of potassium phosphate to trigger fusion of liposomes to mitochondria depended on phospholipid classes, the fusion rate of CL was compared with that of PG and PS. The fusion extent of liposomes to R18-mitochondria was CL > PG > PS (Fig. 5). Mitochondria were enriched with selected phospholipids by exploiting the ability of potassium phosphate to trigger the fusion of liposomes to mitochondria. In a standard experiment, metabolically active mitochondria were incubated with CL, PG, or PS liposomes in the presence of potassium phosphate and respiratory substrates. After fusion, the lipid excess was removed by centrifugation, and the phospholipid composition of fused mitochondria was determined. Total phospholipid content was within the value of 373 ± 18 nmol/mg of protein. Phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine were 32 ± 4 and 34 ± 5% of total, respectively. CL increased from 16 ± 2 to 23 ± 3 nmol/mg of protein (4.3–6.1%) in CL-fused mitochondria; PG increased from 14 ± 2 to 19.5 ± 3 nmol/mg of protein (3.8–5.2%) in PG-fused mitochondria; PS increased from 26 ± 3 to 32 ± 4 nmol/mg of protein (7–8.6%) in PS-fused mitochondria. NAO was used to evaluate the fate of fused CL in mitochondria, after incubation with CL liposomes, respiratory substrates, and/or potassium phosphate. After centrifugation on 0.6 m sucrose to remove nonfused CL, mitochondria were incubated with NAO, and aliquots were treated with digitonin to remove the outer mitochondrial membrane. NAO fluorescence was measured in mitoplasts and in intact mitochondria. In nonfused mitochondria, about 66% of NAO fluorescence was associated with mitoplasts, indicating that CL was localized mainly in the inner mitochondrial membrane. In CL-enriched mitochondria, NAO fluorescence in mitoplasts increased to 72 and 90% when fusion was performed in the presence of phosphate and phosphate plus respiratory substrates, respectively. Acidification of the intermembrane space of mitochondria that follows respiration causes trapping of the weak base AO in a protonated form, resulting in the formation of nonfluorescent dimer and multimer aggregates. Therefore, the decrease of pH in the intermembrane space of mitochondria can be measured as a decrease in AO fluorescence. Acidification was observed in the presence of respiratory substrates. Acidity was significantly enhanced in CL-enriched mitochondria during respiration but not in the resting state (Fig. 6). Acidification was also observed in PG-enriched but not in PS-enriched mitochondria (not shown). DiOC6(3)-loaded mitochondria were incubated in different respiratory conditions in the presence of CL, PG, or PS liposomes. After fusion, flow cytometry analysis was performed and IGFL values were calculated from single-parameter frequency histograms. IGFL value of 56 was measured in the resting state (Fig. 7). However, the basal value decreased during incubation of mitochondria at 37 °C (not shown). Complete depletion of Δψm in the presence of the mitochondrial uncoupler CCCP (positive control) and increase of Δψm in the presence of potassium phosphate and respiratory substrates were observed (Fig. 7). ADP, malate, and pyruvate had no effect on Δψm in the absence of potassium phosphate (not shown). An approximate 3.8- and 2.5-fold increase of IGFL was measured in CL- and PG-enriched mitochondria, respectively. In contrast, about 33% IGFL decrease was detected in PS-enriched mitochondria (Fig. 7). The observed increases of Δψm in CL- and PG-fused mitochondria were not measured when mitochondria were incubated with CL and PG in the absence of potassium phosphate (not shown). Δψm of Pronase-treated mitochondria was comparable with control in the resting state. However, Pronase treatment of mitochondria abolished the Δψmincrease during incubation with respiratory substrates and CL liposomes (Fig. 7). The fluorescent probe JC-1 was used to evaluate mitochondrial heterogeneity with respect to Δψm. JC-1 selectively enters into mitochondria and changes color from green to orange after Δψm increase. Δψm distribution of mitochondrial populations is reported in Fig. 8. Each dot represents a single organelle analyzed for its green (abscissa) and orange (ordinate) associated fluorescence. In the resting state, mitochondria appeared as scattered, heterogeneous particles, most of them (80%) with green fluorescence. In the energized state, a shift toward orange fluorescence was observed, although about 20% of particles still exhibited a low energy state. Enrichment of mitochondria with CL produced a homogeneous mitochondrial population, 97% of particles with high fluorescence values. Mitochondria were loaded with DiOC6(3) and incubated with respiratory substrates. CL liposomes were added, and fusion was allowed. After the removal of phospholipid excess by centrifugation on a sucrose gradient, the ability of DiOC6(3)-loaded mitochondria to retain the fluorescent probe was tested. A time-dependent decrease of retained fluorescence was observed in control but not in CL-fused mitochondria (Fig. 9). A basal value of DiOC6(3) fluorescence was retained in NaN3-treated mitochondria. These data indicate that CL not only increases the uptake of DiOC6(3) but also stabilizes the probe in the mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondria retained cytochrome c, when incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in S/H buffer; loss of cytochrome c was observed when incubation was prolonged to 60 min (not shown). A massive release of cytochrome c in the extramitochondrial medium was detected in the presence of 20 mm potassium phosphate (Fig. 10). However, in CL- and PG-enriched mitochondria, potassium phosphate did not elicit the same effect, and cytochrome c was retained in the inner membrane. PS enrichment of mitochondria did not prevent the loss of cytochrome c. The present study provides evidence that some functional parameters of brain mitochondria are influenced by exogenous selected phospholipids acquired in vitro through a fusion process. We found that mitochondria, incubated in the absence of respiratory substrates, were subjected to Δψm decrease, cytochrome c release, and CL content reduction. CL is an essential phospholipid for many mitochondrial functions, which renders mitochondria completely autonomous for the synthesis of this lipid (28.Daum G. Vance J.E. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 103-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Also, PG is synthesized in mitochondria, whereas other lipids, such as PS, are imported from mitochondria-associated membranes through a mechanism regulated by the respiratory state of mitochondria (22.Monni M. Corazzi L Migliorati G. Roberti R. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 173: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Mitochondria can be enriched in CL through the fusion of CL liposomes. Fusion was triggered by phosphate (Fig. 2) in a concentration range that influenced mPTP but not cytochrome c release (Fig. 3). Mild proteolytic treatment of the outer mitochondrial membrane inhibited the phosphate-dependent fusion process (Fig. 4), suggesting that phosphate interacts with protein factors that, in mPTP opening conditions, allow mitochondrial acquisition of phospholipids. Hence, phosphate is not fusogenic per se, unlike divalent cations, such as Ca2+ (29.Pistolesi R. Corazzi L. Arienti G. Membr. Biochem. 1990; 9: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The extent of liposome fusion depended on phospholipid classes (Fig. 5). Fused mitochondria were enriched in selected lipids. Compared with control, individual enrichment of CL, PG, or PS was about 44, 39, and 23%, respectively. Since in a standard fusion experiment, 20 nmol of lipids were mixed with 0.4 mg of mitochondrial protein, it can be calculated that 11–14% of added phospholipids were fused with mitochondria. Therefore, the enrichment was 5.5–7 nmol/mg of protein, less than 2% of total mitochondrial phospholipids. The endogenous pool of CL is localized in the inner membrane of mitochondria (30.Hoch F.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1113: 71-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Experiments performed with NAO demonstrated that fused CL enriched the inner membrane. Consequently, the fusion process is consistent with a model in which CL fuses with the outer mitochondrial membrane and flows inside through the contact points. The inhibitory effect of cyclosporin A on CL liposome fusion (Fig. 4), the localization of mPTP on the contact points (31.Crompton M. Virji S. Doyle V. Johnson N. Ward J.M. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 66: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and the effect of potassium phosphate on mPTP suggest that mPTP opening is necessary for CL molecules to migrate into the inner mitochondrial membrane. This route might be operative also for PG, the biosynthetic CL precursor (32.Ostrander D.B. Sparagna G.C. Amoscato A.A. McMillin J.B. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38061-38067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and for PS, the substrate of PS decarboxylase, localized on the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane (22.Monni M. Corazzi L Migliorati G. Roberti R. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 173: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). AO is known to concentrate in acidic compartments. The enrichment of the inner mitochondrial membrane with CL favored the accumulation of AO. This result suggests that localization of the probe in the intermembrane compartment of mitochondria is a consequence of pH decrease that follows increased metabolic activity (Fig. 6). Evaluation of the functional heterogeneity of mitochondria populations under various metabolic conditions was performed by cytofluorimetry with DiOC6(3) and JC-1 probes. Frequency determinations, using single-parameter fluorescence histograms, monitored the dynamic behavior of mitochondria. Δψm was modulated in vitro by respiratory substrates and strongly increased after CL or PG supply (Fig. 7), indicating that not only CL but also PG is possibly involved in mitochondrial respiration. Moreover, JC-1 indicated that the enrichment of mitochondria with CL brought the low energy population to high Δψm values (Fig. 8). In contrast, fusion of PS to mitochondria required Δψm consumption (Fig. 7), thus confirming that the driving force for importation of phospholipids resides in the mitochondrion (22.Monni M. Corazzi L Migliorati G. Roberti R. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 173: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Despite the availability of substrates and the presence of CL, Pronase-treated mitochondria worked at basal level (Fig. 7). This result indicates that Pronase removed translocation factors without causing the rupture of the outer membrane, thus preventing substrates and CL from reaching the inner membrane of mitochondria. DiOC6(3) balanced between the aqueous medium and the inner mitochondrial membrane, depending on membrane potential (Fig. 9). Following the addition of CL, the equilibrium shifted to the right. DiOC6(3) release kinetics indicated a time-dependent Δψm decline in control (Fig. 9). The release of DiOC6(3) from CL-enriched mitochondria was very low, even after prolonged incubation, demonstrating that fused CL not only enhanced but also maintained the respiratory activity. It has been hypothesized that the extent of cytochrome c association with the inner mitochondrial membrane is dependent on the interaction with CL and is regulated by the redox state (33.Soussi B. Bylund-Fellenius A.C. Schersten T. Ångström J. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We found that phosphate, although acting on mPTP opening, did not induce cytochrome c release up to 10 mm, confirming that cytochrome c release is independent of the mPTP (34.Andreyev A.Y. Fahy B. Fiskum G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This result suggests that phosphate-triggered cytochrome c release requires a phosphate concentration threshold, able to weaken CL-cytochrome c interactions. Enrichment of the inner membrane with CL or PG prevented cytochrome c release (Fig. 10), possibly by increasing the phosphate concentration threshold. The stabilization of cytochrome c in the membrane correlated directly with the high Δψm of brain mitochondria after fusion with CL or PG (Fig. 7). In this respect, the ability of PG to partially substitute for CL is in agreement with the finding that cytochrome c presents binding sites for both CL and PG (35.Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1770-1774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Detachment of cytochrome c from the inner membrane is an early event that leads to mitochondrial suffering and cell death. In cardiomyocytes, the decrease of mitochondrial membrane CL leads directly to decreased affinity of the membrane for cytochrome c, thus facilitating release for the initiation of programmed cell death (32.Ostrander D.B.

Mitochondrial defects occur in a wide variety of neurodegenerative disorders (36.Orth M. Schapira A.H. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2001; 106: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Loss of CL has been documented in brain mitochondria during ischemia (17.Nakahara I. Kikuchi H. Taki W. Nishi S. Kito M. Yonekawa Y. Goto Y. Ogata N. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 839-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and postischemic reperfusion (37.Nakahara I. Kikuchi H. Taki W. Nishi S. Kito M. Yonekawa Y. Goto Y. Ogata N. J. Neurosurg. 1992; 76: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c release from mitochondria was monitored in cultured cerebrocortical neurons treated with staurosporine and N-methyl-d-aspartate (3.Budd S.L. Tenneti L. Lishnak T. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6161-6166Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and in glutamate-induced neuron death (38.Luetjens C.M. Bui N.T. Sengpiel B. Münstermann G. Poppe M. Krohn A.J. Bauerbach E. Krieglstein J. Prehn J.H.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5715-5723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are no data available on the correlation between CL and cytochrome c stability in the inner membrane of mitochondria in brain. In this work, we exploited the possibility of transferring exogenous CL or PG to the inner membrane of brain mitochondria through a phosphate-mediated fusion process in vitro. The enrichment of the inner mitochondrial membrane with CL or PG may be relevant to the electrostatic interactions of cytochrome c with membrane lipids, resulting in the reinforcement of membrane-protein interactions. As a consequence, cytochrome c is retained in the mitochondrion, preventing the activation of downstream signals in apoptosis. In addition, a homogeneous mitochondrial population characterized by high Δψm is produced, thus improving mitochondrial functionality. We thank Carlo Ricci for technical assistance."

In this study, formation of 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), was measured in testicular cells from rats after 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE) exposure in vivo and in vitro after incubation with EE with or without an antiestrogen. In vivo, preadult (30-35 days) and adult (110-120 days) Wistar rats received 0, 2.8, or 56 mg EE/kg body weight as intraperitoneal injections (n=6). After 1 or 4 h, the 8-oxodG/10(6) dG ratio was measured in the liver, kidneys, and testes. Testes DNA analysis revealed an age-related effect (adult animals had a higher ratio than the young animals) and a concentration effect in preadult rats (increased EE-concentration caused increased ratio), but no time effect. No differences were found in the liver or kidneys. In vitro, testicular cells were isolated and incubated with EE concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1000 nM. The results indicated an increase in 8-oxodG/10(6) dG from 0 to 10 nM estrogen. At 1000 nM, the level was close to control level. Coincubation of 10 nM EE (maximum damage) with an estrogen antagonist, ICI 182.780, abolished the effect at 10 nM, indicating that the damaging effect is estrogen receptor mediated."
https://openalex.org/W2126474190,"Most loci that are regulated by genomic imprinting have differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Previously, we showed that the DMRs of the mouse Snrpn and U2af1-rs1 genes have paternal allele-specific patterns of acetylation on histones H3 and H4. To investigate the maintenance of acetylation at these DMRs, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation on trichostatin-A (TSA)-treated and control cells. In embryonic stem (ES) cells and fibroblasts, brief (6-h) TSA treatment induces global hyperacetylation of H3 and H4. In ES cells only, TSA led to a selective increase in maternal acetylation at U2af1-rs1, at lysine 5 of H4 and at lysine 14 of H3. TSA treatment of ES cells did not affect DNA methylation or expression of U2af1-rs1, but was sufficient to increase DNase I sensitivity along the maternal allele to a level comparable with that of the paternal allele. In fibroblasts, TSA did not alter U2af1-rs1 acetylation, and the parental alleles retained their differential DNase I sensitivity. At Snrpn, no changes in acetylation were observed in the TSA-treated cells. Our data suggest that the mechanisms regulating histone acetylation at DMRs are locus and developmental stage-specific and are distinct from those effecting global levels of acetylation. Furthermore, it seems that the allelic U2af1-rs1 acetylation determines DNase I sensitivity/chromatin conformation.

The allelic expression of imprinted genes in mammals depends on whether the allele is inherited from the mother or the father (1.Surani M.A. Cell. 1998; 93: 309-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Genetic experiments have established that allelic differences in DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides are essential for the correct expression of most imprinted genes (2.Li E. Beard C. Jaenisch R. Nature. 1993; 366: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). The great majority of imprinted loci have defined regulatory sequences that are methylated predominantly on one or other of the two parental alleles.

Pickard B. Kelsey G. Reik W. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 881-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). However, CpG methylation cannot be the sole determinant in the somatic maintenance of imprints. At constitutive DMRs, allelic methylation patterns must somehow be protected from the genome-wide demethylation that occurs following fertilization and during early stages of development (reviewed in Ref. 4.Haaf T. Chromosome Res. 2001; 9: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although some mouse DMRs lose methylation during preimplantation development, they can regain allelic methylation patterns at later stages (3.Constância M. Pickard B. Kelsey G. Reik W. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 881-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). To account for such observations, it has been argued that the somatic maintenance of epigenetic marks at DMRs may involve multiple, interdependent, modifications including DNA methylation, nonhistone protein binding, and alterations to nucleosomes and chromatin (5.Feil R.

It has been suggested that the DMR comprising exon 1 of the human SNRPN gene on chromosome 15q11-q13 (11.Glenn C.C. Saitoh S. Jong M.T. Filbrandt M.M. Surti U. Driscoll D.J. Nicholls R.D. Am. J. Hum.

This DMR corresponds to the imprinting control center involved in the neuro-developmental Prader-Willi Syndrome (13.Shemer R. Hersko A.Y. Perk J. Mostoslavsky R. Tsuberi B.Z. Cedar H. Buiting K.

Genet. 2000; 25: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar); and both in humans and mice, it shows increased histone H3 and H4 acetylation on the unmethylated paternal allele (15.Saitoh S. Wada T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 66: 1958-1962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16.Gregory R.I. Randall T.E. Johnson C.A. Khosla S. Hatada I. O'Neill L.P. Turner B.M. Feil R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5426-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Histone H4 associated with the differentially methylated region-2 of the IGF2 receptor gene (Igf2r) on mouse chromosome 17 is heavily acetylated on the unmethylated paternal allele and underacetylated on the maternal allele (17.Hu J.-F. Pham J. Dey I. Li T. Vu T.H. Hoffmann A.R. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4428-4435Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The DMR encompassing the imprinted U2af1-rs1 gene also shows pronounced acetylation differences between the methylated maternal and the unmethylated paternal allele. By using antisera specific for particular acetylated lysines on histones H3 and H4, we previously established that the underacetylation of H4 at the methylated U2af1-rs1 allele is confined to lysine 5, whereas for H3, at least three of the four acetylatable lysine residues were underacetylated. Similar results were obtained for the constitutive DMR comprising exon 1 of the mouse Snrpn gene (16.Gregory R.I. Randall T.E. Johnson C.A. Khosla S. Hatada I. O'Neill L.P. Turner B.M. Feil R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5426-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that by inducing high levels of CpG methylation on the paternal U2af1-rs1 allele, we could bring about underacetylation of H3, but not of H4, lysine 5 (16.Gregory R.I. Randall T.E. Johnson C.A. Khosla S. Hatada I. O'Neill L.P. Turner B.M. Feil R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5426-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, allelic differences in histone acetylation can be both histone-specific and lysine residue-specific and can be linked differently to CpG methylation. In the present study we explore how allelic patterns of histone acetylation are maintained at the DMRs of the imprinted mouse genes U2af1-rs1 and Snrpn by examining the in vivo effects of trichostatin-A (TSA), a highly specific inhibitor of histone deacetylases (18.Yoshida M. Kijima M. Akita M. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17174-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used ES cells and differentiated cells derived from interspecific hybrid embryos to compare directly the maternal and paternal alleles of the U2af1-rs1 and Snrpn genes in chromatin and expression assays. This analysis demonstrates that the DMRs at the imprinted Snrpn and the U2af1-rs1 genes are highly resistant to TSA treatments that cause global hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4. In undifferentiated ES cells, but not in embryonic fibroblasts, and at the U2af1-rs1 DMR only, TSA treatment induces selective, lysine residue-specific changes in acetylation. These changes are associated with altered chromatin conformation along this imprinted locus. Mice that were maternally (Matdi11) or paternally (Patdi11) disomic for chromosome 11 were produced by intercrossing animals heterozygous for the Robertsonian translocation Rb(11.13)4Bnr (19.Cattanach B.M. Kirk M. Nature. 1985; 315: 496-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Primary embryonic fibroblasts were derived from day 14 fetuses (line EF1; Ref. 16.Gregory R.I. Randall T.E.

For chromatin assays, early passage (<passage 5) EF1 fibroblasts were used. ES line SF1-1 was cultured in ES medium with 103 units/ml of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (20.Dean W.L. Bowden L. Aitchison A. Klose J. Moore T. Meneses J.J. Reik W. Feil R. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 2273-2282PubMed Google Scholar). For chromatin studies, semiconfluent early passage (<passage 15) SF1-1 cells were used that were morphologically undifferentiated. For TSA treatment, exponentially growing cells were cultured for 6 h in medium supplemented with TSA (at 300 nm). Nuclei were isolated from tissue or cultured cells and were resuspended in DNase I, MNase, or MspI digestion buffer at ∼107 nuclei/ml, as described previously (10.Feil R. Boyano M.D. Allen N.D. Kelsey G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20893-20900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For the DNase I assay, 200-μl aliquots of nuclei suspension were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C at increasing concentrations of enzyme (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). DNA extraction and Southern hybridization were performed as described previously (10.Feil R. Boyano M.D. Allen N.D. Kelsey G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20893-20900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Hybridized filters were analyzed by phosphorimager (FLA3000, Fuji) and intensities were determined using the Quantity-One imaging software (Bio-Rad). Probe 7 is a 397-bp fragment (nucleotides 3556–3953 of the sequence for GenBankTM accession number AF309654) and probe 8 is 389-bp (nucleotides 7336–7725 of the sequence for GenBankTM accession number AF309654). For reverse transcriptase PCR analysis, poly(A)+ RNA was extracted from cells using a Qiagen “Oligotex direct mRNA kit.” First strand DNA synthesis was from 100–200 ng of mRNA using random primers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). cDNA was used as template for U2af1-rs1 amplification (forward, cgcagatcagacatactgcgg; reverse, tgtggtacggccagcctatg) and Snrpn amplification (forward, gagagggagccggagatg; reverse, ttgctgttgctgagaacgtc) in a mixture containing [α-32P]dCTP, and the resulting products were migrated through an SSCP gel. For total RNA extraction we used a Qiagen “RNeasy kit.” Northern hybridization was with a 250-bp HindIII-PstI fragment from the 5′ end of the mouse Gapdh gene, a 499-bp fragment comprising exon 7 of Snrpn (16.Gregory R.I.

Boyano M.D. Allen N.D. Kelsey G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20893-20900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Histone extraction from cultured cells and analysis of purified histones on acetic acid/urea/Triton gels were according to Bonner et al. (21.Bonner W.M. West M.H. Stedman J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 109: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Western blotting and immunostaining with antisera to acetylated histones were as described previously (22.Keohane A.M. Lavender J.S. O'Neill L.P. Turner B.M. Dev. Genet. 1995; 22: 65-73Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Purification of nuclei, partial fractionation of chromatin with MNase to obtain fragments of predominantly 1–5 nucleosomes in length, and immunoprecipitation with affinity-purified antibodies were performed as described previously (23.O'Neill L.P. Turner B.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3946-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The following antisera were used: R252/16 (to H4Ac16), R41/5 (to H4Ac5), R224/14 (to H3Ac14), and R47/9/18 (to H3Ac9/18) (24.White D.A. Belyaev N.D. Turner B.M. Methods. 1999; 19: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For PCR-SSCP, 50 ng of each from the extracted DNA samples were used to PCR amplify (36 cycles; T-annealing = 60 °C) in the presence of [32P]dCTP (1% of total dCTP) from two regions in U2af1-rs1: a 293-bp region of the 5′-UTR (forward, cgcagatcagacatactgcgg; reverse, tgtggtacggccagcctatg) and a 163-bp 3′-UTR region (forward, ctaattcccaaccaagttaca; reverse, aaaacaacatgggaagccag). Snrpn primers amplified a 228-bp region at the DMR1 (forward, agttgtgactgggatcctg; reverse, gcggcaacagaacttctacc). Denatured PCR products were resolved by SSCP gel electrophoresis (25.Gregory R.I. Feil R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: R1-R4Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Following migration, gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films or analyzed by a phosphorimager (FLA3000, Fuji). The relative band intensities were calculated using the Quantity-One imaging software (Bio-Rad). Acetylation studies were performed on interspecific hybrid cell lines. In all ChIP assays, the parental alleles were compared directly by using a combination of PCR amplification and electrophoretic detection of SSCP (25.Gregory R.I. Feil R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: R1-R4Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For our studies, we selected a primary embryonic fibroblast line, EF1, that is (C57BL/6 × Mus spretus)F1 for proximal chromosome 11 on a homozygous C57BL/6 background (16.Gregory R.I. Randall T.E. Johnson C.A. Khosla S. Hatada I. O'Neill L.P. Turner B.M. Feil R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5426-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and a (C57BL/6 × M. spretus)F1 embryonic stem (ES) cell line (SF1-1; Ref. 20.Dean W.L. Bowden L. Aitchison A. Klose J. Moore T. Meneses J.J. Reik W. Feil R. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 2273-2282PubMed Google Scholar). In both cell lines, the two imprinted genes that we analyzed, U2af1-rs1 and Snrpn, had maternal DNA methylation at their DMRs and were expressed exclusively from the paternal allele (16.Gregory R.I. Randall T.E. Johnson C.A. Khosla S. Hatada I. O'Neill L.P. Turner B.M. Feil R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5426-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 20.Dean W.L. Bowden L. Aitchison A. Klose J. Moore T. Meneses J.J. Reik W. Feil R. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 2273-2282PubMed Google Scholar). To explore the role and regulation of the paternal allele-specific H3 and H4-lysine 5 acetylation at U2af1-rs1 gene, we set out to alter levels of acetylation by treatment of the interspecific hybrid cells with TSA. To minimize pleiotropic or cell cycle effects of TSA (18.Yoshida M. Kijima M. Akita M. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17174-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we restricted the treatment time to 6 h at a concentration of 300 nm. In initial experiments, we found that in undifferentiated SF1-1 ES cells, prolonged TSA treatment (12 or 24 h at 100 or 300 nm) led to extensive detachment of cells from the culture dish and severe restriction of cell growth after removal of the drug. In contrast, TSA treatment of SF1-1 ES cells (and EF1 fibroblasts) for only 6 h did not give rise to gross morphological changes or cell detachment, and cells continued to grow normally after TSA removal (data not shown). We analyzed global levels of H3 and H4 acetylation in untreated cells and in cells harvested immediately after the 6-h treatment. In the SF1-1 ES cells, the short treatment was sufficient to induce a major increase in histone acetylation, detected by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blotting of bulk histones separated on acetic acid/urea/Triton X-100 gels (Fig. 1). Gel scanning showed that ∼80% of all histone H4 in the TSA-treated ES cells was present in the tetra-, tri-, or diacetylated forms, as compared with less than 5% before treatment. Based on immunostaining with antisera to H3 acetylated at either lysine 14 or lysines 9 and/or 18 (the antiserum used does not discriminate between H3 acetylated at lysines 9 and 18), TSA treatment also induces a dramatic increase in global levels of H3 acetylation (Fig. 1A and data not shown). Very similar results were obtained with the embryonic fibroblast line EF1 (Fig. 1B). The effects of TSA on acetylation at U2af1-rs1 were investigated by performing chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on untreated and TSA-treated SF1-1 and EF1 cells. Antibody-bound fractions were assayed for paternal and maternal DNA from the 5′- and 3′-UTRs of the U2af1-rs1 gene, by PCR amplification and electrophoretic detection of SSCP (Fig. 2A). Of critical importance for the application of PCR-SSCP to allelic acetylation studies is the demonstration that PCR amplifications from (C57BL/6 × M. spretus)F1 genomic DNA give equal amounts of C57BL/6 and M. spretus-specific fragments on SSCP gels. This is shown in Fig. 2 for the U2af1-rs1 regions analyzed. We have shown previously that, in untreated ES cells, the methylated, maternal U2af1-rs1 allele is underacetylated at H4 lysine 5 and at H3 lysines 14 and 9/18 but not at H4 lysines 8, 12, and 16 (16.Gregory R.I. Randall T.E. Johnson C.A. Khosla S. Hatada I. O'Neill L.P. Turner B.M. Feil R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5426-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In TSA-treated ES cells, ChIP/PCR-SSCP assays show that levels of histone H4 acetylated at lysine 5 (H4Ac5) became similar on the maternal and paternal U2af1-rs1 alleles at both the 5′- and the 3′-UTR (Fig. 2, B and C, respectively). TSA also has an effect on H3Ac14 levels; paternal/maternal ratios are about 2-fold lower in TSA-treated cells, although the paternal allele remains more highly acetylated. In contrast, TSA did not effect the relatively low levels of H3Ac9/18 on the maternal U2af1-rs1 allele. If anything, the measured ratios of paternal over maternal H3-K9/18 acetylation were even higher than in the untreated cells (Fig. 2, B and C). These findings, summarized in Table I, suggest that in ES cells, TSA induces a significant gain of maternal acetylation on H4-lysine 5 and H3-lysine 14. In contrast to the specific effects in ES cells, in the EF1 embryonic fibroblasts, the preferential acetylation of both H3 and H4 on the paternal U2af1-rs1 allele remained essentially unaltered after growth for 6 h in the presence of TSA (Table I). Hence, despite its pronounced effects on global levels of H3 and H4 acetylation in these differentiated cells (Fig. 1B), TSA did not affect the relative allelic levels of acetylation along U2af1-rs1.Table ISummary of PCR-SSCP data, presented as the ratios of paternal over maternal acetylationU2af1-rs1, 5′-UTRU2af1-rs1, 3′-UTRSnrpn, DMR1SF1–1 ES cells H4:Ac161.11.22.0Ac54.82.06.8 H3:Ac144.03.66.8Ac9/183.72.0>10SF1–1 ES cells + TSA H4:Ac161.71.42.3Ac50.81.14.0 H3:Ac141.92.16.3Ac9/186.43.9>10EF1 fibroblasts H4:Ac161.01.0Ac52.42.1 H3:Ac14>10>10Ac9/18>10>10EF1 fibroblasts + TSA H4:Ac161.30.9Ac52.22.0 H3:Ac14>10>10Ac9/18>10>10 Open table in a new tab TSA treatment did not affect the expression of the U2af1-rs1 gene. Levels of U2af1-rs1 mRNA measured by Northern hybridization were unaltered by TSA treatment of ES cells and fibroblasts (Fig. 3A). When assayed by the more sensitive reverse transcriptase PCR amplification technique, expression in the TSA-treated ES cells continued to be from the paternal chromosome exclusively (Fig. 3B). Before treatment of the SF1-1 cells with TSA, all CpG methylation at the U2af1-rs1 locus was present on maternal chromosomes. Specifically, about 85% of SF1-1 cells showed maternal methylation of a unique NotI restriction site in the 5′-UTR and of 24 HpaII restriction sites distributed along the locus. This was not altered by TSA treatment, and U2af1-rs1 methylation in EF1 fibroblasts was also unaltered by TSA (Fig. 3C and data not shown). In adult brain and liver (10.Feil R. Boyano M.D. Allen N.D. Kelsey G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20893-20900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and in kidney (Fig. 4B), chromatin along the repressed maternal U2af1-rs1 allele is severalfold less sensitive to DNase I in vivo than its paternal counterpart. A similar differential was observed in the ES cells and the fibroblasts, at the passages that were analyzed in this study. Hence, when incubating nuclei purified from these cells at a range of increasing concentrations of DNase I, the repressed maternal allele became fully digested only at severalfold higher enzyme concentrations than the active paternal allele (Fig. 4, C and D). To investigate whether this allelic difference in generalized sensitivity along U2af1-rs1 is associated with paternal allele-specific histone acetylation, we studied DNase I sensitivity in the TSA-treated SF1-1 ES cells. Using a Southern blotting approach, we found that the maternal U2af1-rs1 copy invariably becomes more DNase I-sensitive upon TSA treatment, acquiring a generalized sensitivity to DNase I similar to that of the paternal chromosome. This was observed using a BglII +SacI restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) (Fig. 4B) that encompasses the 3′-half of the gene, in which no hypersensitive sites are present (10.Feil R. Boyano M.D. Allen N.D. Kelsey G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20893-20900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In contrast, TSA did not have a predominant effect on the differential sensitivity in the EF1 fibroblasts, in which the maternal U2af1-rs1 allele remained more resistant to DNase I than the paternal chromosome (Fig. 4D). This agrees with our finding of unaltered allelic acetylation in these TSA-treated differentiated cells. To analyze nuclease sensitivity at the opposite end of the gene, we made use of the PCR-SSCP polymorphism at its 5′ extremity (see Fig. 2), encompassing 293 bp in which no hypersensitive sites are present (10.Feil R. Boyano M.D. Allen N.D. Kelsey G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20893-20900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Hence, nuclei from control and TSA-treated SF1-1 and EF1 cells were incubated at increasing concentrations of DNase I, and extracted DNA samples were used to PCR amplify from the 5′-UTR, followed by migration of the PCR products through a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (precisely as for the PCR-SSCP analysis of immunoprecipitated chromatin, Fig. 2). This showed that in the untreated ES cells and fibroblasts, the paternal allele was more readily digested by DNase I than the maternal allele (Fig. 5). In the TSA-treated ES cells, however, similar amounts of maternal and paternal PCR products were amplified at all but the highest nuclease concentration used, indicating that the maternal and the paternal alleles had become much more similar in their sensitivity to DNase I. In the EF1 fibroblasts, TSA treatment did not change the differential PCR amplification at the 5′-UTR; the repressed maternal allele remained more resistant to DNase I digestion than the expressed paternal allele (Fig. 5). The differential, generalized sensitivity to DNase I seems not to be associated with significant differences in the positioning of nucleosomes along the maternal and paternal U2af1-rs1 alleles. This was apparent from analysis of mice that were maternally (Matdi11) or paternally (Patdi11) disomic for chromosome 11. Purified liver nuclei from Matdi11 and Patdi11 mice were incubated for increasing lengths of time with micrococcal nuclease. Genomic DNA was extracted from these MNase series, digested with the restriction enzyme HindIII, Southern blotted, and hybridized with small probes (probes 7 and 8, respectively) from the opposite extremities of a 4.2-kb HindIII fragment that comprises most of the U2af1-rs1 gene (Fig. 6). The MNase digestion profiles revealed by hybridization with both these probes appeared identical for the Matdi11 and Patdi11 nuclei (Fig. 6). This finding agrees with our earlier observation (10.Feil R. Boyano M.D. Allen N.D. Kelsey G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20893-20900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) that the parental alleles of U2af1-rs1 have a similar sensitivity in vivo to MNase. We also analyzed nuclei from early-passage androgenetic and parthenogenetic ES cells, and in these monoparental cells the U2af1-rs1 MNase digestion profiles were similar (data not shown). In adult tissues, the U2af1-rs1 locus displays differential sensitivity to the restriction endonuclease MspI, with chromatin on the silent and methylated maternal chromosome being highly resistant to this methylation-insensitive enzyme (10.Feil R. Boyano M.D. Allen N.D. Kelsey G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20893-20900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This difference may be attributed to the presence of methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) proteins on the maternal allele (16.Gregory R.I. Randall T.E. Johnson C.A. Khosla S. Hatada I. O'Neill L.P. Turner B.M. Feil R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5426-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In contrast to its pronounced effects on the generalized DNase I sensitivity in ES cells, TSA did not significantly alter the differential MspI sensitivity along the U2af1-rs1 locus (data not shown). The 5′ part of the imprinted Snrpn gene has a DMR (DMR1, Fig. 7A) at which methylation is established in the female germ line and is maintained in all embryonic lineages (26.Shemer R. Birger Y. Riggs A.D. Razin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10267-10272Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we established that the DMR1 of Snrpn has paternal allele-specific patterns of histone acetylation. As for U2af1-rs1, the differential acetylation at histone H4 is most pronounced at lysine 5, whereas at histone H3, all lysine residues analyzed show paternal acetylation (Ref. 16.Gregory R.I. Randall T.E. Johnson C.A. Khosla S. Hatada I. O'Neill L.P. Turner B.M. Feil R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5426-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar; Fig. 7B). We find that TSA causes no detectable change in the relative levels of acetylation on the maternal and paternal Snrpn alleles. With antibodies to acetylated H3 (lysines 14, 9, and 18) and H4 (lysine 5), most of the chromatin precipitated from the DMR1 originated from the paternal chromosome, as in the untreated cells (Fig. 7B). The expression of Snrpn appeared also unaltered by TSA treatment of ES cells (Fig. 7, C and D). We were unable to perform allelic acetylation studies on the EF1 fibroblasts, since these are homozygous C57BL/6 for chromosome 7 (where Snrpn resides). However, TSA did not lead to any detectable increase in Snrpn expression in these cells (Fig. 7C). A key finding in this study is that whereas TSA induces global hyperacetylation on core histones H3 and H4, only partial (or no) effects are observed at the constitutive DMRs of the imprinted loci analyzed. Only in undifferentiated ES cells, at U2af1-rs1 but not at Snrpn, did brief TSA treatment lead to a selective increase in the relative levels of histone acetylation on the repressed maternal chromosome. The TSA-induced changes in ES cells are confined to specific lysine residues and are associated with increased sensitivity to DNase I along the imprinted locus. These findings raise questions about the regulation of histone deacetylation at DMRs and its role in chromatin organization and gene repression. The observed effects of TSA on U2af1-rs1 were cell type- and lysine residue-specific. In ES cells, TSA abolished the paternal/maternal difference in H4Ac5 at U2af1-rs1 and reduced, but did not eliminate, the difference in H3Ac14. In contrast, there was no evidence for a gain in H3Ac9/18 on the maternal allele, despite the fact that TSA treatment led to a major increase in overall levels of H3-K9/18 acetylation in the ES cells. One interpretation of this result is that continuous HDAC activity is necessary to maintain the allelic acetylation differences in H4Ac5 and H3Ac14 in ES cells. In contrast, in primary embryonic fibroblast cells, TSA had no effect on the relative levels of H3Ac14, H3Ac9/18, or H4Ac5 on the maternal and paternal U2af1-rs1 alleles. Although underlying mechanism(s) need to be determined, this difference between the two cell types would imply that acetylation patterns at U2af1-rs1 become somehow stabilized and resistant to TSA upon differentiation. In contrast to the results with U2af1-rs1, at the constitutive DMR of the Snrpn gene, we found no evidence for allelic changes in H3 and H4 acetylation in TSA-treated ES cells. One possible interpretation of this finding is that, in contrast to the regulation of global histone acetylation, which seems to involve continuous HDAC activity, there is a strongly reduced, or possibly cell cycle-regulated, turnover of histone acetate groups at these two DMRs. Alternatively, the HDAC activities that maintain the allelic acetylation patterns at U2af1-rs1 and Snrpn could differ in their sensitivities to TSA, either because the enzymes involved are distinct or because they are associated with different proteins that alter their catalytic properties. For example, the NAD-dependent deacetylase SIR2 is highly resistant to TSA (27.Barlow A.L. van Drunen C.M. Johnson C.A. Tweedy S. Bird A. Turner B.M. Exp. Cell. Res. 2001; 265: 90-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The selective effect of TSA on H4-lysine 5 and H3-lysine 14 acetylation at U2af1-rs1 raises the possibility that the enzyme(s) involved are specific for these lysine residues. Several HDACs show preferences for specific histones or lysine residues. Histone deacetylase Hda1p in yeast, for instance, preferentially deacetylates H3 in vitro (28.Carmen A.A. Rundlett S.E. Grunstein M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15837-15844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), while histone acetylation patterns in mutants lacking this activity suggest a preference for H3 and H2B in vivo (29.Wu J. Suka N. Carlson M. Grunstein M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 117-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Yeast HOS3p has a preference for H4Ac5 and H4Ac8 and H3Ac14 and H3Ac23 (30.Carmen A.A. Griffin P.R. Calaycay J.R. Rundlett S.E. Suka Y. Grunstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12356-12361Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Specificity can also be substrate-dependent. HDAC1, as part of the NuRD complex, for example, deacetylates all H4 lysines in free histones, but only lysines 5, 8, and 12 in chromatin (31.Zhang Y. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bird A. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, so far no HDACs have been shown to be specific for H4Ac5 or H3Ac14 in chromatin. In ES cells, TSA abolished paternal/maternal differences in generalized DNase I sensitivity along U2af1-rs1, while at the same time, allelic differences in H4Ac5 and H3Ac14 were reduced or abolished. In differentiated embryo fibroblasts, in contrast, there was no detectable change in relative levels of H3-K14 or H4-K5 acetylation and no allele-specific increase in DNase I sensitivity. These correlations do not, in themselves, establish H4-lysine 5 and/or H3-lysine 14 as mediators of DNase I sensitivity. They do, however, demonstrate that DNase I sensitivity on the maternal U2af1-rs1 allele is not dependent on global changes in histone acetylation but may be regulated by the selective acetylation/deacetylation of specific lysine residues on H3 and H4. Our study did not consider core histones H2A and H2B, and we do not exclude a possible co-involvement of acetylation at these core histones. Now that suitable antisera are becoming available, this can be investigated. It was reported recently that chromatin at silenced transgenes acquires increased DNase I sensitivity in vivo after only a few hours of TSA treatment (32.Chen W.Y. Townes T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and a correlation between histone underacetylation and chromatin compaction has also been demonstrated at the chicken β-globin chromosomal domain (33.Hebbes T.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1823-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). It is unclear how precisely deacetylation of lysine residues on H3 and H4 leads to compaction of chromatin. The N-terminal tail of histone H4 links neighboring nucleosomes in core particle crystals, and such interactions might influence chromatin compaction in vivo(34.Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been established that the N terminus of H3 is essential for the formation of condensed chromatin fibers (35.Leuba S.H. Bustamante C. Zlatanova J. van Holde K. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2823-2829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and several recent in vitro studies show that the extent of histone deacetylation at tail domains influences chromatin condensation (36.Annunziato A.T. Hansen J.C. Gene Expr. 2000; 9: 37-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 37.Wang X. He C. Moore S.C. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12764-12768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Alternatively, acetylation of specific residues on H3 and/or H4 could prevent, either directly or indirectly, the association of nonhistone proteins that are involved in chromatin compaction. Centromeric chromatin is particularly susceptible to the effects of TSA and loses its ability to retain heterochromatin protein-1 (HP1) on prolonged treatment with this HDAC inhibitor (38.Taddei A. Maison C. Roche D. Almouzni G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). TSA treatment did not induce methylation changes at U2af1-rs1, and the chromatin on the methylated maternal chromosome remained highly resistant to the restriction endonuclease MspI (which recognizes sites that can be methylated but is not methylation-sensitive). One possible interpretation of the unaltered MspI resistance of chromatin is that there is continued binding of proteins to methylated CpG dinucleotides. Several studies have demonstrated physical association between HDACs and MBD proteins (reviewed in Ref. 6.Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar), and in a previous study we demonstrated in vivo association of MECP2 with the methylated maternal U2af1-rs1 allele (16.Gregory R.I. Randall T.E. Johnson C.A. Khosla S. Hatada I. O'Neill L.P. Turner B.M. Feil R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5426-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Such association of specific MBD proteins to methylated DNA represents an attractive targeting mechanism that could, at least partially, account for the observed low acetylation at histones on the maternal U2af1-rs1 allele. We found no evidence that TSA induces expression of U2af1-rs1 or Snrpn. A few hours of incubation with TSA also failed to de-repress the silent parental alleles of the imprinted Igf2 and H19 genes on mouse chromosome 7 (39.Grandjean V. O'Neill L. Sado T. Turner B. Ferguson-Smith A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 488: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast, prolonged treatments of cultured cells with TSA has been reported to induce expression of the normally silent allele of the imprinted Igf2 gene and the Igf2- receptor gene on mouse chromosome 17 (17.Hu J.-F. Pham J. Dey I. Li T. Vu T.H. Hoffmann A.R. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4428-4435Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 40.Pedone P.V. Pikaart M.J. Cerrato F. Vernucci M. Ungaro P. Bruni C.B.

Chem. 2001; 276: 8674-8680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In these experiments, cells were grown for 24 h in the presence of the HDAC inhibitor. Perhaps, passage through S phase, or even a complete cell cycle, is necessary before the switch to a new transcriptional state can be accomplished at imprinted genes. We note, however, that TSA treatments of up to 72 h do not lead to de-repression of the silent maternal alleles of the U2af1-rs1 and Snrpn genes (15.Saitoh S. Wada T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 66: 1958-1962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 41.El Kharroubi A. Piras G. Stewart C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8674-8680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and this supports our main finding that the DMRs at these imprinted loci are particularly resistant to the effects of this HDAC inhibitor.

https://openalex.org/W1834444221,"Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) present on the surface of the trematode blood fluke Schistosoma has been implicated in the regulation of glucose scavenging from the host blood. Determination of the molecular structure and functional characteristics of this molecule is a crucial first step in understanding the novel function for AChE and in evaluating the potential of schistosome AChE as a target of new parasite control methods. We have determined the primary structure of acetylcholinesterase from Schistosoma haematobium. Immunolocalization studies confirmed that the enzyme was present on the parasite surface as well as in the muscle. The derived amino acid sequence possesses features common to acetylcholinesterases: the catalytic triad, six cysteines that form three intramolecular disulphide bonds, and aromatic residues lining the catalytic gorge. An unusual feature is that the fully processed native enzyme exists as a glycoinositol phospholipid (GPI)-anchored dimer, but the sequence of the C?terminus does not conform to the current consensus for GPI modification. The enzyme expressed in Xenopus oocytes showed conventional substrate specificity and sensitivity to established inhibitors of AChE, although it is relatively insensitive to the peripheral site inhibitor propidium iodide. Distinctions between host and parasite AChEs will allow the rational design of schistosome-specific drugs and vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2055455260,"The selective deletion of a discrete surface-exposed epitope (residues 254–262; 250-loop) in the β domain of streptokinase (SK) significantly decreased the rates of substrate human plasminogen (HPG) activation by the mutant (SKdel254–262). A kinetic analysis of SKdel254–262 revealed that its low HPG activator activity arose from a 5–6-fold increase in Kmfor HPG as substrate, with little alteration in kcatrates. This increase in the Kmfor the macromolecular substrate was proportional to a similar decrease in the binding affinity for substrate HPG as observed in a new resonant mirror-based assay for the real-time kinetic analysis of the docking of substrate HPG onto preformed binary complex. In contrast, studies on the interaction of the two proteins with microplasminogen showed no difference between the rates of activation of microplasminogen under conditions where HPG was activated differentially by nSK and SKdel254–262. The involvement of kringles was further indicated by a hypersusceptibility of the SKdel254–262· plasmin activator complex to ε-aminocaproic acid-mediated inhibition of substrate HPG activation in comparison with that of the nSK·plasmin activator complex. Further, ternary binding experiments on the resonant mirror showed that the binding affinity of kringles 1–5 of HPG to SKdel254–262·HPG was reduced by about 3-fold in comparison with that of nSK·HPG. Overall, these observations identify the 250 loop in the β domain of SK as an important structural determinant of the inordinately stringent substrate specificity of the SK·HPG activator complex and demonstrate that it promotes the binding of substrate HPG to the activator via the kringle(s) during the HPG activation process.

Unlike other human plasminogen (HPG) activators, like tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase, SK does not possess any intrinsic enzymatic activity. Instead, SK forms an equimolar, stoichiometric complex with “partner” HPG or plasmin (HPN), which then catalytically activates free “substrate” molecules of HPG to HPN by selective cleavage of the Arg561-Val562 peptide bond (2.Castellino F.J. Chem. Rev. 1981; 81: 431-446Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 3.McClintock D.K. Bell P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 43: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). It is believed that consequent to the initial SK·HPG complexation, there is a structural rearrangement within the complex, and even before any proteolytic cleavage takes place, an active center within the HPG moiety capable of undergoing acylation is formed (3.McClintock D.K. Bell P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 43: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This activated complex is rapidly transformed into an SK·HPN complex and develops an HPG activator activity. Unlike free HPN, however, which is essentially a trypsin-like protease with broad substrate preference, SK·HPN displays a very narrow substrate specificity (4.Markus G. Werkheiser W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2637-2643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structural basis of the conversion of the broadly specific serine protease HPN to a highly substrate-specific protease, once complexed with the “cofactor” SK, with exclusive propensity for acting on the target scissile peptide bond in HPG has been the subject of active investigations with both fundamental and applied implications (5.Parrado J.

SK has been shown to be composed of three structurally similar domains (termed α, β, and γ), separated by random coils and small, flexible regions at the amino and carboxyl termini (5.Parrado J. Conejero-Lara F. Smith R.A.G. Marshall J.M. Ponting C.P. Dobson C.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 693-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 7.Conejero-Lara F. Parrado J. Azuaga A.I. Smith R.A.G.

Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The recently solved crystal structure of the catalytic domain of HPN complexed with SK strongly indicates how SK might modulate the substrate specificity of HPN by providing a “valley” or cleft in which the macromolecular substrate can dock through protein-protein interactions, thus positioning the scissile peptide bond optimally for cleavage by the HPN active site, thereby conferring a narrow substrate preference onto an otherwise “indiscriminate” active center. In this structure, SK does not appear to induce any significant conformational changes in the active site residues directly but, along with partner HPG, seems to provide a template on which the substrate molecule can dock through protein-protein interactions, resulting in the optimized presentation of the HPG activation loop at the active center of the complex (6.Esmon C.T. Mather T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 933-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 8.Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). However, the identity of these interactions and their contributions to the formation of the enzyme-substrate intermediate(s) remains a mystery so far. Besides the well recognized “switch” in substrate preference (4.Markus G. Werkheiser W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2637-2643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the binding of SK to HPN results in a severalfold enhancement of the Km for diverse small molecular weight chromogenic peptide substrates but relatively little alteration in their kcat values as compared with free HPN, indicating that the primary, covalent specificity characteristics of the active center of HPN upon SK binding are unchanged but result in steric hindrance/reduced accessibility for even the small molecular weight peptide substrates. Thus, the remarkable alteration of the macromolecular substrate specificity of HPN by SK is currently thought to be due to “exosites” generated on the SK·HPN complex, as shown recently by the elegant use of active site-labeled fluorescent HPN derivatives (10.Boxrud P.D. Fay W.P. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14579-14589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Peptide walking studies in our laboratory had also indicated that short peptides based on the primary structure of SK, particularly those derived from selected regions in the α and β domains, displayed competitive inhibition for HPG activation by the preformed SK·HPN complex under conditions where the 1:1 complexation of SK and HPN was essentially unaffected (11.Nihalani D. Raghava G.P.S. Sahni G. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1284-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 12.Nihalani D. Kumar R. Rajagopal K. Sahni G. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) However, the crystal structure of SK complexed with microplasmin(ogen) (8.Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), while providing a high degree of resolution of the residues involved in the SK·μPN complexation, yielded few unambiguous insights regarding the interactions engendered between the activator complex and substrate HPG. This is probably due to the binary nature of the complex (i.e. an absence of a juxtaposed substrate molecule, large average thermal factors especially in the β domain, and a total absence, in both partner and substrate HPG, of the kringles that are known to be important in HPG activation) (13.Lin L-F. Houng A. Reed G.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4740-4745Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, despite a detailed and high resolution exposition of the overall nature of protein-protein interactions in the SK·μPN binary complex, discrete structures/epitopes of SK, if any, that are directly involved in the exosite formation process by the full-length activator complex have not yet been identified. Previously, charged side chains, both in HPG, particularly around the active center (14.Dawson K.M. Marshall J.M. Raper R.H. Gilbert R.J. Ponting C.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12042-12047Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and in SK in the β domain (16.Chaudhary A. Vasudha S. Rajagopal K. Komath S.S. Garg N. Yadav M. Mande S.C. Sahni G. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2791-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 17.Lin L-F. Oeun S. Houng A. Reed G.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16879-16885Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), have been shown to be important for HPG activation ability. However, a clear cut identification of a structural epitope/element in conferring substrate HPG affinity onto the SK·PG activator complex has not been demonstrated until now. Of the three domains of SK, the central β domain displays maximal affinity for HPG (15.Conejero-Lara F.C. Parrado J. Azuaga A.I. Dobson C.M. Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2190-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the N-terminal α domain displays relatively lesser affinity for HPG with the γ domain showing much less affinity of for HPG. 2V. Sundram, K. Rajagopal, A. Chaudhary, S. S. Komath, and G. Sahni, unpublished observations. Solution and structural studies suggest that both α and β domains are involved in the substrate recognition phenomenon (8.Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 12.Nihalani D. Kumar R. Rajagopal K. Sahni G. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies have also implicated positively charged residues in the β domain to be important but have failed to show that these residues are directly involved in substrate recognition by the binary complex (17.Lin L-F. Oeun S. Houng A. Reed G.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16879-16885Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). An examination of the crystal structure of the free β domain (18.Wang X. Tang J. Hunter B. Zhang X.C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and its comparison with the other two SK domains possessing closely similar (but not identical) structures revealed the presence of a distinct flexible loop in the β domain (the 250-loop) that protrudes into the solvent (Fig. 1). In the present study, we chose to delete this loop based on the premise that if this structural motif is involved in substrate recognition, discrete deletion of this loop would lead to a selective increase in Km of the activator complex. The results obtained provide clear cut evidence of the role played by this nine-residue loop in substrate recognition and thus identify a functionally important component of the macromolecular substrate-specific exosite operative in the SK·HPN complex, which interacts via the kringle(s) in HPG. Glu-plasminogen was either purchased from Roche Diagnostics Inc. or purified from human plasma by affinity chromatography (19.Deutsch D.G. Mertz E.T. Science. 1970; 170: 1095-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). The RNA polymerase promoter-based expression vector, pET23(d) and Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) were products of Novagen Inc. (Madison, WI). Thermostable DNA polymerase (pfu) was obtained from Stratagene Inc. (La Jolla, CA), and restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, and other DNA-modifying enzymes were acquired from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Oligonucleotide primers were supplied by Integrated DNA Technologies Inc., (Indianapolis, IN). HPN was prepared by digesting Glu-HPG with urokinase covalently immobilized on agarose beads using a ratio of 300 Plough units/mg HPG in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 25% glycerol, and 25 mml-lysine at 22 °C for 10 h (15.Conejero-Lara F.C.

Mande S.C. Sahni G. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2791-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All other reagents were of the highest analytical grade available. A set of mutagenic and flanking primers, carrying unique restriction sites, were used in polymerase chain reactions to generate DNA fragments having overlapping ends. Thereafter, splicing-overlap-extension PCR (SOE-PCR) reactions (20.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6832) Google Scholar) were carried out, resulting in amplification products, which were cloned in the pET23(d) expression vector (16.Chaudhary A. Vasudha S. Rajagopal K. Komath S.S. Garg N. Yadav M. Mande S.C. Sahni G. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2791-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21.Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers for SOE-PCR for the construction of SKdel254–262 were as follows. The mutagenic primers were as follows: upstream primer, 5′-AACAGGCTTATAGGGAAATAAACAACACTGACCTGATATCTGAGAAA-3′; downstream primer, 5′ TGTTGTTTATTTCCCTATAAGCCTGTTCCCGATTTTTAA 3′. The flanking primers were as follows: upstream primer, 5′-ATTTATGAACGTGACTCCTCAATCGTC-3′; downstream primer, 5′-ATAGGCTAAATGATAGCTAGCATTCTCTCC-3′. Oligonucleotide primers for SOE-PCR for the construction of βwild type and βdel254–262 were as follows. Sequences of the mutagenic primers were as follows: upstream primer, 5′-AACAGGCTTATAGGGAAATAAACAACACTGACCTGATATCTGAGAAA-3′; downstream primer, 5′-TGTTGTTTATTTCCCTATAAGCCTGTTCCCGATTTTTAA-3′. Sequences of the flanking primers were as follows: upstream primer, 5′-GTGGAATATACTGTACAGTTTACTCC-3′; downstream primer, 5′-ATCGGGATCCTATTTCAAGTGACTGCGATCAAAGGG-3′. Both proteins were expressed intracellularly in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells after induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside essentially according to the instructions of the supplier (Novagen Inc.). The host-vector system for the expression of the cDNA corresponding to mature SK from Streptococcus equisimilis H46A after in-frame juxtaposition of an initiator methionine codon (so as to express the protein as Met-SK) has been described earlier (16.Chaudhary A. Vasudha S. Rajagopal K. Komath S.S. Garg N. Yadav M. Mande S.C. Sahni G. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2791-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, protein sequence analysis of the purified SK expressed intracellularly in E. coli (referred to as nSK hereafter) was found to have its N-terminal Met removed at a 50% level. The same case was seen in the mutant (SKdel254–262) prepared similarly from E. coli employing the same expression vector. The pelleted cells were sonicated, and the proteins in the supernatants were precipitated with ammonium sulfate (16.Chaudhary A. Vasudha S. Rajagopal K. Komath S.S. Garg N. Yadav M. Mande S.C. Sahni G. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2791-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This fraction, after dissolution in 20 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.5, was then chromatographed on a Poros-D anion exchange column fitted onto a Bio-Cad Sprint liquid chromatographic workstation (Perseptive Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA). nSK/SKdel254–262 were eluted using a linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.5 m) in 20 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.5. The eluted proteins were more than 95% pure, as analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Both proteins were expressed intracellularly in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells as inclusion bodies. The pellet obtained after sonication was taken up in 8 m urea and placed under gentle shaking conditions for 30 min to effect dissolution. After a high speed centrifugation step, the protein in the supernatant was refolded by 20-fold dilution with 20 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.5. The β domain was then purified to more than 95% homogeneity by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose Fast-flow (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C using a linear NaCl gradient (0–0.25 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.5). Microplasminogen, the catalytic domain of plasminogen (residues Lys530–Asn790) devoid of all kringles was prepared by cleavage of HPG by HPN under alkaline conditions (0.1 n glycine/NaOH buffer, pH 10.5) at 25 °C. Microplasminogen was purified from the reaction mixture by passing through a Lys-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences), followed by a soybean-trypsin inhibitor-Sepharose 4B column to absorb HPN and μPN, as reported (22.Shi G-Y. Wu H-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17071-17075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The flow-through was then subjected to molecular sieve chromatography, after concentration by ultrafiltration, on a column (16 × 60 cm) of Superdex-75TM (Amersham Biosciences). The purity of μPG formed was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, which showed a single band moving at the position expected from its molecular size (22.Shi G-Y. Wu H-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17071-17075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteolytic fragment containing all of the HPG kringle domains (K1–5) was prepared by incubating HPG with urokinase-free HPN (5:1 ratio of HPG and HPN) under alkaline conditions (0.1 n glycine/NaOH, pH 9.0) for 72 h at 25 °C. Under these conditions, the proteolytic conversion of native HPG to K1–5 was found to be quantitative, with minimal residual HPG. HPN was removed from the reaction mixture by passing through a soybean trypsin inhibitor-Sepharose column (1.6 × 3.6 cm). This was followed by gel filtration on Superdex-75, to obtain HPG- and μPG-free K1–5. The purity of this preparation was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis (23.Wu H.-L. Chang B.-I. Wu D.-H. Chang L.-C. Gong G.-C. Lou K.-L. Shi G.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19658-19664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation with urokinase, which is known to be a good activator of μPG irrespective of the presence of kringle domains (22.Shi G-Y. Wu H-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17071-17075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used to establish that the activation of this preparation, when used as substrate, was comparable with that obtained when using SK·HPN as the activator species. Aliquots (50 nm) were withdrawn from equimolar HPG·nSK/SKdel254–262 complexes at regular periods and transferred to a 100-μl quartz microcuvette containing 2 mm tosyl-glycyl-prolyl-lysine-4-nitranilide-acetate (Chromozym® PL) and 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, at 22 °C. The change in absorbance at 405 nm was monitored to compute the kinetics of amidolytic activation (12.Nihalani D. Kumar R. Rajagopal K. Sahni G. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 24.Wohl R.C. Summaria L. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2005-2013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Five μm HPG was added to an assay cuvette containing 5.5 μm nSK/SKdel254–262, 100 μmNPGB, and 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and the “burst” of p-nitrophenol release was monitored at 410 nm as a function of time at 22 °C (3.McClintock D.K. Bell P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 43: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 25.Chase Jr., T. Shaw E. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2212-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Varying amounts of HPG were added to the assay cuvette containing fixed amounts of nSK/SKdel254–262 and chromogenic substrate (1 mm), and the change in absorbance was monitored at 405 nm as a function of time at 22 °C. Also, the kinetics of HPG activation by HPN·nSK/SKdel254–262 complexes were measured by transferring suitable aliquots of preformed HPN·nSK/SKdel254–262 complexes to the assay cuvette containing different concentrations of substrate HPG (24.Wohl R.C. Summaria L. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2005-2013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To compute the kcat, the number of HPN active sites was determined using the NPGB reaction (3.McClintock D.K. Bell P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 43: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 25.Chase Jr., T. Shaw E. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2212-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 26.Wohl R.C. Arzadon L. Summaria L. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1141-1147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). nSK/SKdel254–262 and HPN were precomplexed at 4 °C in equimolar ratios (100 nm each) for 1 min in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and an aliquot of the reaction mixture was transferred to a 100-μl assay cuvette containing 50 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.5, and varying concentrations of the chromogenic substrate (0.1–2 mm) to obtain a final concentration of 10 nm complex in the reaction. The reaction was monitored spectrophotometrically at 405 nm for 5 min at 22 °C. The kinetic constants were calculated by standard methods (25.Chase Jr., T. Shaw E. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2212-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Association and dissociation between HPG and the nSK/SKdel254–262, referred to hereafter as binary interaction, were followed in real time by resonant mirror-based detection using the IAsys PlusTMsystem (Cambridge, UK) (27.Cush R. Cronin J.M. Stewart W.J. Maule C.H. Molloy J. Goddard N.J. Biosensors Bioelectronics. 1993; 8: 347-354Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 28.Buckle P.E. Davies R.J. Kinning T. Yeung D. Edwards P.R. Pollard-Knight D. Lowe C.R. Biosensors Bioelectronics. 1993; 8: 355-363Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In these experiments, streptavidin was captured on biotin cuvette according to the manufacturer's protocols (IAsys protocol 1.1). This was followed by the attachment of (mildly) biotinylated HPG to the streptavidin captured on the cuvette. Nonspecifically bound HPG was then removed by repeated washing with phosphate-buffered saline followed by three washes with 10 mm HCl. The net response chosen for the immobilized biotinylated HPG onto the cuvette was 700–800 arc seconds in all experiments. Experiments were performed at 25 °C in 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5 × 10−3m NPGB (binding buffer). The latter was included in order to prevent plasmin-mediated proteolysis. After equilibrating the cuvette with binding buffer, varying concentrations of either nSK or SKdel254–262 were added, and each binding response was monitored during the “association” phase. Subsequently, the cuvette was washed with binding buffer, and the “dissociation” phase was recorded (29.Myszka D.G. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Following each cycle of analysis, the cuvette was regenerated by washing with 10 mmHCl, and base line was reestablished with binding buffer. In parallel, in the control cell in the dual channel cuvette, immobilized streptavidin alone was taken as a negative control for the binding studies. In experiments where EACA was used to examine its effect on SK-HPG interaction, the binary complex was formed between ligate nSK/SKdel254–262 and immobilized HPG in binding buffer (as described above). The dissociation of the binary complexes was done by washing the cuvette with EACA instead of buffer alone. The data were analyzed after subtraction of the corresponding nonspecific refractive index component(s), and the kinetic constants were calculated from the sensorgrams by nonlinear fitting of the association and dissociation curves according to 1:1 model A+ B = AB using the software FASTfitTM, supplied by the manufacturers. Briefly, the association curves at each concentration of ligate were fitted to the pseudo-first order equation to calculate the observed rate constant (kon). Then the concentration dependence of kon was fitted using linear regression to find the association rate constant (ka) from the slope of the linear fit (30.Morton T.A. Myszka D.G. Chaiken I.M. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The dissociation rate constant (kd) was calculated from the average of four dissociation curves obtained at saturating concentration of ligate. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) was then calculated as kd/ka. Values of KD obtained using this relationship were in good approximation to those obtained by Scatchard analysis of the extent of association (data not shown). Resonant mirror technology-based biosensor was also used to measure the rate and equilibrium dissociation constants describing interactions between soluble ligate (PG, μPG, or K1–5) and nSK/SKdel254–262complexed with immobilized HPG, a situation simulating substrate binding to binary complex and hereafter referred to as ternary interaction. In binary interaction studies, it was evident that when soluble nSK/SKdel254–262 was added to immobilized HPG, a rapid and avid SK·HPG binary complex formation occurs. The dissociation of this complex is very slow due to the high stability of the SK·HPG complex, as has been observed by others also (15.Conejero-Lara F.C. Parrado J. Azuaga A.I. Dobson C.M. Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2190-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). After allowing the complex to dissociate maximally (∼20 min), the dissociation base line becomes stable, which remains unaffected even after washing with 2.5 mm EACA. It has been reported that when SK was preincubated with immobilized HPG, EACA was >100-fold less potent at dissociating the binary complex than it was at preventing binary complex formation when SK and EACA were added synchronously to immobilized HPG (13.Lin L-F. Houng A. Reed G.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4740-4745Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, this comparative resistance to dissociation of the SK·HPG binary complex by EACA permitted us to study ternary substrate interaction under conditions that did not adversely affect the stability of the binary interaction. In contrast, EACA was found to be strongly inhibitory to ternary complex formation (see below). In a typical ternary interaction experiment, a stable binary complex was formed by adding a saturating amount of either nSK or SKdel254–262 onto HPG, immobilized on streptavidin captured on biotin cuvette. After maximally dissociating the binary complex with binding buffer and washing with 2.5 mm EACA, a stable dissociation base line was obtained. Varying concentrations of either “ternary” HPG (0.1–1.0 μm), μPG (1–6 μm), or K1–5 (1–6 μm) were then added to monitor the binding by recording the association phase. Subsequently, the cuvette was washed with binding buffer three times, and the dissociation phase was recorded. After each cycle of analysis, the original base line was reestablished by stripping off the undissociated ternary ligate with 2.5 mm EACA followed by three washes with binding buffer. It was established that EACA, at this concentrati"

The addition of calmodulin increased the Vmax and the apparent Ca2+ affinity of both the wild type and d296–349 enzymes indicating that the activating effects of calmodulin were not affected by the deletion. At low concentrations of Ca2+ and in the presence of saturating amounts of calmodulin, the addition of phosphatidic acid increased about 2-fold the activity of the recombinant wild type pump.

Taken together these results suggest that (a) deletion of residues 296–349 recreates a form of PMCA similar to that resulting from the binding of acidic lipids at the AL region; (b) the AL region acts as an acidic lipid-binding inhibitory domain capable of adjusting the Ca2+ affinity of the PMCA to the lipid composition of the membrane; and (c) the function of the AL region is independent of the autoinhibition by the C-terminal calmodulin-binding region.

The overall topology of the PMCA is similar to that of other P-type ion motive ATPases with about 10 transmembrane segments (M1–M10) and most of the protein exposed to the cytosol (1.Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2115-2118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Four genes for the PMCA have been identified in humans, and each of these genes produces additional isoforms by alternative splicing of primary transcripts (2.Strehler E.E. Zacharias D.A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 21-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the PMCA (∼135 kDa) is slightly higher than that of other P-ATPases, and this is mainly due to the extended C-terminal region (C region) and also to the insertion of a highly charged segment of about 60 amino acids in the loop between M2 and M3. In this report we call the latter the AL region. The C region includes a calmodulin-binding autoinhibitory domain, and the binding of calmodulin enhances both the Ca2+sensitivity and the turnover of the pump. Alternative splicing of mRNA modifies region C leading to isoforms with different responsiveness toward calmodulin activation (3.Penniston J.T. Enyedi A. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 165: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The removal by limited proteolysis or deletion mutagenesis of the C-terminal 120 amino acids including the calmodulin-binding autoinhibitory domain suffices for a calmodulin-like activation (4.Sarkadi B.

Acta. 1992; 1105: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and this effect has been in part accounted for by the finding that these lipids interact with the calmodulin-binding site (12.Filoteo A.G. Enyedi A. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11800-11805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Brodin P. Falchetto R. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, the fact that acidic lipids are capable of enhancing the Ca2+ sensitivity of the PMCA to a greater extent than calmodulin suggested the existence of an independent acidic lipid-responsive region (5.Enyedi A. Flura M. Sarkadi B. Gardos G. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6425-6430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Papp B. Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Caride A.J. Penniston J.T. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4577-4582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of controlled proteolysis with trypsin of the PMCA from human erythrocytes (mostly isoform h4xb) have shown that the activating effects of acidic lipids is lost concomitantly with the appearance of a 76-kDa peptide lacking the N-terminal portion of the molecule and the C-terminal regulatory region (5.Enyedi A. Flura M. Sarkadi B. Gardos G. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6425-6430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Papp B. Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Caride A.J. Penniston J.T. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4577-4582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the proteolytic fragment of 76 kDa and its precursor, a lipid-responsive peptide of 81 kDa, have identical C termini, it was inferred that the portion of the AL region cleaved during the 81–76-kDa conversion (amino acids 315–358) is involved in lipid activation (14.Zvaritch E. James P. Vorherr T. Falchetto R. Modyanov N. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8070-8076Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In addition, it was later shown that synthetic peptides made with the sequence of segment 339–360 specifically bind acidic lipids (3.Penniston J.T. Enyedi A. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 165: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 13.Brodin P. Falchetto R. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As with the C region, alternative splicing at the so-called site “A” can generate different versions of the AL region. These changes were proposed to affect the sensibility of the PMCA toward acidic lipids (15.Adamo H.P. Penniston J.T. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 16.Heim R. Hug M. Iwata T. Strehler E.E. Carafoli E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, no functional consequences of the changes in this region have been reported. In this study, we have investigated the effects of deletions in the segment 296–356 of the human PMCA4xb. This segment encompasses the variable region between M2 and M3 (AL region) close to the site of tryptic cleavage associated with the acidic lipid activation (Fig. 1). The mutant proteins were successfully expressed either transiently in COS-1 cells or in a stable form in CHO cells. Contrary to our expectations, the recombinant PMCAs with deletions involving residues 350–356 were completely inactive suggesting that, in addition to its proposed regulatory role, this segment is also necessary for the biogenesis of a functional enzyme. In contrast, deletion of residues 296–349 resulted in a fully active pump with a high affinity for Ca2+ characteristic of the activated form of the PMCA that would result from binding of acidic lipids at the lipid-binding site of region AL.

The expression vector pED was a generous gift of Dr. Randall J. Kaufman, Genetics Institute, Boston. The construction of the cDNAs coding for the wild type h4xb and the C-terminally truncated mutant ct120 were described previously (7.Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10621-10626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Adamo H.P. Verma A.K. Sanders M.A. Heim R. Salisbury J.L. Wieben E.D. Penniston J.T. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). They were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pED (18.Kaufman R. Davies M.V. Wasley L.C. Michnick D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4485-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). To obtain a cDNA coding for a mutant lacking residues 300–356, two fragments were synthesized by PCR using the h4xb cDNA as template and the pair of primers A1–3EGE and 5EGE-2096. Primer sequences are as follows: A1, 5′-ctgcaggtcgaccatggcgaacccat-3′; 3EGE, 5′-gaacagccagacgcgtcttctttttctccccttcg-3′; 5EGE, 5′-gagaaaaagaagacgcgtctggctgttcagattgggaa-3′; and 2096, 5′-caatggcccgggctgtgttgatg-3′. Primer A1 has a SalI site incorporated at its 5′ position, whereas primer 5EGE-3EGE contains a restriction site for nuclease MluI. The PCR products were digested either with SalI and MluI or MluI and BspEI (internal site naturally occurring in the wild type h4xb DNA at position 1911) to produce cohesive fragments coding for residues 1–299 and 357–719, respectively, and cloned into the corresponding position of pED-h4xb or pED-ct120. Mutant d296–349 was obtained using oligonucleotides A1 and 887 5′-cttcttacgcgtcccttcgtcatcctcattgacc-3′. A similar strategy was used to obtain the other mutants. The nucleotide sequence of the mutant cDNAs extending between the SalI and BspEI sites was verified by dideoxy chain termination sequencing. COS-1 or CHO(dhfr−) cells were lipofected using either the ESCORT transfection reagent (Sigma) or polyfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. COS-1 cells were harvested 48 h after transfection for the preparation of microsomes. Stable CHO cell lines expressing the recombinant wild type h4xb was described previously (19.Adamo H.P. Grimaldi M.E. Garcı́a Arguinzonis M.I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14893-14899Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To express in a stable form the d300–356 and d296–349 proteins, the transfected CHO cells were split into dishes of 15 cm in diameter 48 h post-transfection and cultured in a selective Eagle's α-minimum essential medium without ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides, supplemented with antibiotics and 10% of dialyzed fetal calf serum. After 3 weeks about 3–5 of the resulting colonies were cloned and expanded, and the expression of the pump was investigated by immunoblotting. The crude microsomal membrane fractions were prepared by the procedure of Enyedi et al. (7.Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10621-10626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was estimated by means of the Bio-Rad protein assay, with bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were carried out as described previously (20.Adamo H.P. Grimaldi M.E. Bredeston L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1464: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Proteins were electrophoresed on a 7.5% acrylamide gel according to Laemmli (21.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar) and subsequently transferred to Millipore Immobilon membranes. The membranes were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 5F10 monoclonal antibody (22.Adamo H.P. Caride A.J. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14244-14249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Caride A.J. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Penniston J.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) from ascites fluid (dilution, 1:2000). For staining, biotinylated anti-mouse immunoglobulin G and avidin-streptoavidin peroxidase conjugate were used. Ca2+ uptake assays were performed as described previously (19.Adamo H.P. Grimaldi M.E. Garcı́a Arguinzonis M.I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14893-14899Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 100 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3 at 37 °C), 5 mm NaN3, 0.1 μm thapsigargin, 4 μg/ml oligomycin, 20 mmsodium phosphate, 1.5 mm ATP, 95 μm EGTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2 and CaCl2 (labeled with45Ca) to give the desired concentration of free Ca2+. The free concentrations of Ca2+ were calculated using the program of Fabiato and Fabiato (24.Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). Vesicles (10 μg of protein) were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP. The reaction was finished after 5 min by filtering the samples through a 0.45-μm filter. The 45Ca taken up by the vesicles was determined by counting in a scintillation counter. Uptake activities were expressed per mg of membrane protein. For each data point the activity of the recombinant PMCA was estimated by subtracting the activity of the endogenous PMCA (Ve) from the overall transport activity. Ve was obtained as Vc× (Ie/Ic), where Vc is the rate of Ca2+ uptake by microsomal vesicles made from cells transfected with vector without insert; Ie is the intensity of the endogenous PMCA band in microsomes containing endogenous and recombinant enzymes as determined by immunoblotting, and Ic is the intensity of the endogenous PMCA band in microsomes made from cells transfected with vector without insert. The values of Ve were less than 20% of the total Ca2+uptake. To measure the effect of PA on the activity of the recombinant PMCA, PA was dissolved in methanol:chloroform (2:1) at a concentration of 17 mg/ml. Immediately before use, the methanol:chloroform was dried off, and the lipid was resuspended in 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3 at 37 °C), 160 mm KCl. The suspension was sonicated for 5–10 min until clear, and an aliquot was added to the reaction media. The microsomes were preincubated at 37 °C with PA for 5 min in the reaction medium before initiating calcium uptake by the addition of ATP. The phosphorylation reaction was carried out at 4 °C in a medium containing 30 μg of microsomal protein, 160 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0 at 4 °C), 4 μmthapsigargin, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.06 mm LaCl3 in a reaction volume of 0.25 ml. La3+ was added because it is known to stabilize the phosphoenzyme of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump (25.Luterbacher S. Schatzmann H.J. Experientia (Basel). 1983; 39: 311-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 μm[γ-32P]ATP and terminated after 1 min with 15 μl of a solution containing 100% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitated proteins were dissolved in sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE in a 7% acrylamide gel according to Sarkadi et al. (4.Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Foldes-Papp Z. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9552-9557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After drying the gel, autoradiographs were produced with 24–72 h of exposure at −70 °C using X-Omat x-ray films. Microsomes from CHO cells were suspended in a medium containing 0.05 mm EGTA, and the reaction was initiated by the rapid addition of 5 μl of trypsin 0.1 μg/μl (ratio of microsomal protein:trypsin of 20:1). After incubation on ice for 30 s or 1, 10, or 25 min the reaction was stopped with 4 μl of aprotinin 1.2 mg/ml. Controls (0 s) were done without trypsin. Our initial goal was to see how much of the region AL could be removed from the PMCA molecule without changing the maximum capacity of the enzyme to transport Ca2+. To detect changes in the activity without the interference of the calmodulin-binding autoinhibitory domain, the deletions were made in the fully active ct120 pump (7.Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10621-10626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblots of microsomes from transfected COS cells showed two major bands, one of about 140 kDa corresponding to the endogenous PMCA and the other of faster migration corresponding to the recombinant ct120 enzymes (Fig. 2). Despite some variation in the amount of expressed proteins due to the efficiency of the transfection, none of the deletions significantly affected the amount of recombinant PMCA. We began making deletions at downstream residue 300 because the amino acid sequences of different PMCA isoforms started to diverge approximately at that position. In fact, residues 301–312 were absent in the alternatively spliced option h4zb of isoform 4 (26.Keeton T.P. Shull G.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The deletion was extended to residue 356 because previous proteolysis work suggested that the segment 315–358 was not essential for activity (5.Enyedi A. Flura M. Sarkadi B. Gardos G. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6425-6430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Papp B. Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Caride A.J. Penniston J.T. Gardos G. J. Biol.

Mutants lacking residues from segment 300–349 were as active as the ct120 pump. Moving the deletion upstream to residues 296–349 to remove a cluster of three consecutive lysine residues still resulted in a fully active enzyme. In contrast, shifting the deletions downstream to residue 356 led to a near total loss of the Ca2+transport activity.Table ICa2+ transport activity of ct120 Ca2+ pumps with deletions in the AL regionMutantRate of Ca2+ uptake%d300–314105 ± 21 (4)d300–338121 ± 31 (4)d300–34694 ± 18 (3)d300–349117 ± 15 (9)d296–349100 ± 14 (3)d300–3561 ± 5 (2)d314–35625 ± 17 (4)d339–35629 ± 14 (4)d346–3562 ± 7 (3)The rate of Ca2+ uptake from COS cell microsomes was measured for 5 min at 37 °C in the absence of calmodulin.

In order to characterize in more detail mutants d296–349 and d300–356, they were stably expressed as full-length Ca2+pumps in CHO cells. The expression levels estimated by immunoblotting were 100 and 60% of the wild type for d296–349 and d300–356, respectively (not shown). The ability of the mutants to form an acyl phosphate from ATP was investigated (Fig. 3). Membranes containing the h4xb or the ct120 enzymes showed strong bands corresponding to the phosphorylated recombinant pumps. The active mutants d300–314(ct120) and d300–349(ct120) were also capable of forming phosphoenzyme. In contrast, only a weak band similar to that of the endogenous PMCA was observed in microsomes containing mutants with deletions involving residues 350–356. Thus, in these mutants the lack of Ca2+ transport activity was accompanied by the loss of the ability to react with Ca2+ and ATP to form the phosphorylated intermediate. The structure of the mutant proteins was investigated by examining their sensitivity to degradation by a brief exposure to trypsin (Fig. 4). The proteolytic PMCA fragments were recognized either with antibody 5F10, which reacts in the central portion of the molecule (amino acids 719–738), or antibody JA9, which reacts near the N-terminal end (amino acids 16–75). As reported before (4.Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Foldes-Papp Z. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9552-9557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Papp B. Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Caride A.J.

Acta. 2000; 1464: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), a small amount of PMCA fragments that likely result from the activity of endogenous proteases are detected in the microsomal preparation before the beginning of the treatment with trypsin. As the digestion progressed the recombinant wild type protein was cleaved to fragments similar to those previously observed (5.Enyedi A. Flura M. Sarkadi B. Gardos G. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6425-6430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using human erythrocyte membranes. Despite its lack of activity, the d300–356 protein was rather stable and only became significantly degraded after 10 min of digestion. The relative resistance to degradation by trypsin was more obvious in mutant d296–349. Particularly noticeable in the mutants was absence of a proteolytic fragment of about 35 kDa produced by cleavage after lysine 314, and the lower amounts of other fragments of smaller size that also originated from the N-terminal portion of the molecule. However, whereas the intensity of peptides of 90–81 kDa was very weak in mutant d296–349, in mutant d300–356 a fragment of about 85 kDa detected by JA9 accumulated at the longest times of proteolysis. After knowing that residues 296–349 may be removed from the PMCA without altering the maximum Ca2+ transport activity, we examined the effects of this deletion on the affinity of the PMCA for Ca2+ and its regulation. Fig. 5 shows the dependence of Ca2+ uptake on free Ca2+ with or without added calmodulin. In the absence of calmodulin the recombinant wild type enzyme had low activity and low Ca2+ affinity (K0.5 about 1 μm). Under these conditions and at low concentrations of Ca2+, d296–349 was between 2 and 10 times more active than the recombinant wild type pump. However, as the Ca2+ concentration increased the Vmax of d296–349 reached a value similar to that of the recombinant wild type enzyme. Thus, the absence of residues 296–349 activated the PMCA by enhancing its response to Ca2+. Calmodulin had a similar effect on the recombinant d296–349 and wild type enzymes increasing the Vmax at saturating concentrations of Ca2+ and reducing the K0.5 for Ca2+. In addition the cooperativity for Ca2+activation, which was shown to be a characteristic of the calmodulin-activated pump (5.Enyedi A. Flura M. Sarkadi B. Gardos G. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6425-6430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was less evident in the d296–349 enzyme. Because the only mechanisms that have been reported to decrease the K0.5 for Ca2+ to values lower than those obtained with calmodulin are the removal by proteolysis of region AL and the treatment of the enzyme with acidic lipids (5.Enyedi A. Flura M. Sarkadi B. Gardos G. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6425-6430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,6.Papp B. Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Caride A.J. Penniston J.T. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4577-4582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in the following experiment we investigated whether the activation caused by deletion of residues 296–349 was additive to that of acidic lipids. To examine the activating effects of acidic lipids due to the putative N-terminal acidic lipid-binding site, the activity of the recombinant PMCA was measured at low concentrations of Ca2+ and in the presence of a concentration of calmodulin high enough to saturate the C-terminal calmodulin acid lipid-binding site (Fig. 6). Under these conditions, increasing concentrations of PA stimulated the activity of the recombinant wild type reaching a maximum value of about 200% at 30 μm PA, and then it decreased at higher concentrations of PA, probably reflecting the inhibitory effect of acidic lipids reported previously (8.Niggli V. Adunyah E.S. Penniston J.T. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 395-401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Brodin P. Falchetto R. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Eur. J.

J. 1998; 329: 637-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In contrast, PA minimally affected the activity of mutant d296–349 increasing its activity up to a maximum of about 120% at 75 μm PA. The N-terminal portion of the segment of amino acids connecting transmembrane helices M2 and M3 of the PMCA is part of the recently identified domain A of the SERCA that is highly conserved in all P-ATPases and is essential for catalytic activity (28.Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar). In contrast, the C-terminal portion of the M2–M3 loop that we called the AL region is only present in the PMCA, and it was proposed to be involved in the regulation of the PMCA by acidic lipids (6.Papp B. Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Caride A.J. Penniston J.T. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4577-4582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Zvaritch E. James P. Vorherr T. Falchetto R. Modyanov N. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8070-8076Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Assuming that the primary function of this region would be the regulation of the activity of the enzyme, it should be possible to remove it from the molecule without altering the maximum capacity to transport Ca2+. Indeed this is exactly what results from the removal of the C-terminal calmodulin-binding region (7.Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10621-10626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies (5.Enyedi A. Flura M. Sarkadi B. Gardos G. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6425-6430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Papp B. Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Caride A.J. Penniston J.T. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4577-4582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using limited tryptic proteolysis have shown that cleavage by trypsin after arginine 358 leads to a fully active 76-kDa fragment that is no longer responsive to activation by acidic lipids. In apparent contradiction with these findings, we found that deletions including residues 350–356 led to the loss of Ca2+transport activity and phosphorylation from ATP. The discrepancy between the result of limited proteolysis and deletion mutagenesis may indicate that residues 350–356 not only have a regulatory function but they are also required for the biogenesis of a functional PMCA. Because the interaction with anionic lipids has been shown to be important for the correct insertion and targeting of membrane proteins (29.van Kompenburg W. Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. de Kruijff B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4261-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 30.van Voorst F. de Kruijff B. Biochem. J. 2000; 247: 601-612Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar), it will be interesting to investigate whether the deletions in the AL region affect the delivery of the PMCA to the plasma membrane. Mutants d300–356 and d296–349 seemed more resistant to trypsin digestion than the recombinant wild type pump. Although this may in part result from the removal of the proteolytic site at position 315, it also suggests that the global structure of the protein was not grossly altered by the deletions. Furthermore, the proteolysis patterns suggest that in these mutants the cleavage at position 358 was impaired. Nevertheless, at the longest times of proteolysis a fragment of about 85 kDa detected by JA9 became more intense in mutant d300–356 than in either the recombinant wild type or mutant d296–349, a fact that may reflect a structural change associated with the lack of activity of mutant d300–356. The crystal structure of SERCA has shown that the M3 and other transmembrane helices are longer than predicted previously (28.Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar). If this is also the case for the PMCA, the N-terminal end of M3 would be at valine 351, and hence the deletion of residue 350–356 would directly affect the structure of M3. This transmembrane segment has been shown to be critical for the function of SERCA (31.Andersen J.P. Lykke-Moller Sorensen T. Povlsen K. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23312-23321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and is part of the binding site for the highly specific SERCA inhibitor thapsigargin (32.Zhong L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12994-12998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We found that at saturating concentrations of Ca2+, mutants with deletions involving amino acids from the segment 296–349 had a Ca2+ transport activity similar to that of the recombinant wild type pump. The importance of a net excess of positive charges on the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane segments for a proper membrane topology is well known (29.van Kompenburg W. Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. de Kruijff B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4261-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 30.van Voorst F. de Kruijff B. Biochem. J. 2000; 247: 601-612Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, because the activity of mutant d296–349 was preserved, it seems that residues 296–349 are not critical for the correct folding or insertion of the PMCA in the membrane despite the fact that the deletion of amino acids 296–349 effectively removed 15 positively charged residues from the segment preceding M3. Although the removal of residues 296–349 did not significantly affect the Vmax of Ca2+ transport, it changed the behavior of the pump at low concentrations of Ca2+. Like acidic lipids, the deletion of residues 296–349 increased the Ca2+ affinity of the pump, and it did so more effectively than calmodulin. Moreover, when the calmodulin-binding site was saturated with calmodulin, the d296–349 enzyme was not significantly stimulated by phosphatidic acid. These results suggest that the d296–349 mutant resembles the activated form of the PMCA resulting from the binding of acidic lipids to their site in the AL region of the molecule. The N-terminal acidic lipid-responsive segment of the PMCA is bracketed by two segments near the catalytic region of the pump that were proposed to form a receptor site for the C-terminal autoinhibitory sequence (33.Falchetto R. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1612-1621Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Because calmodulin had a similar effect on the recombinant d296–349 and wild type enzymes, it seems that the activation of the PMCA by the binding of acidic lipids to the AL region does not modify the inhibitory interaction of the C-terminal segment with its receptor site. Because acidic lipids also bind and activate via the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain (12.Filoteo A.G. Enyedi A. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11800-11805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Brodin P. Falchetto R. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the independence of the effects associated with the interaction of acidic lipids at a site in region AL has been difficult to assess. This in part was due to the fact that it has not been possible to use partial proteolysis to remove selectively the region AL of the molecule without also cleaving the C-terminal segment. In this respect, the mutant d296–349 may be useful to study in more detail the effects of acidic lipids on the enzyme not activated by disruption of the inhibitory interaction between the C-terminal domain and the catalytic region of the pump. According to a model proposed previously (5.Enyedi A. Flura M. Sarkadi B. Gardos G. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6425-6430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Papp B. Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Caride A.J. Penniston J.T. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4577-4582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) the Ca2+pump may be in three distinct functional states as follows: (i) the resting state with low Vmax and low Ca2+ affinity (K0.5 >1 μm); (ii) the calmodulin activated state of high Vmax and intermediate affinity for Ca2+ (K0.5 ∼0.5 μm); and (iii) acidic lipid-activated state of high Vmax and high Ca2+ affinity (K0.5 ∼0.2 μm). The results of the deletion 296–349 suggest that, through the interaction of the AL region with the acidic lipids of the membrane, the PMCA could adopt a fourth state characterized by low Vmax and intermediate or high affinity for Ca2+. It has been suggested that a lower rate of Ca2+ extrusion by the PMCA due to a decrease in the level of activating phosphoinositides facilitates the rapid transient elevation of intracellular Ca2+ after stimulation by agonists (34.Wang K.K. Villalobo A. Roufogalis B.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 46-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 35.Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19529-19535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Because the affinity for acidic lipids at region AL would seem higher than that of the C region (9.Choquette D. Hakim G. Filoteo A.G. Plishker G.A. Bostwick J.R. Penniston J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 125: 908-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 12.Filoteo A.G. Enyedi A. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11800-11805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Brodin P. Falchetto R. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that under normal resting conditions when the free cytoplasmic Ca2+ level decreases to a level where calmodulin activation is insignificant, the phosphoinositides keep the PMCA in an activated state similar to that exhibited by the d296–349 enzyme, and in response to the activation induced by an agonist, the PMCA would lower its affinity for Ca2+. Our results suggest that in the absence of acidic lipids the AL region keeps the PMCA in a state of low affinity for calcium. In the wild type enzyme the binding of part of the AL region to the anionic lipids of the membrane is expected to relieve this inhibition. However, if this region is deleted as in mutant d296–349, the interaction with acidic lipids is no longer required for a high Ca2+ affinity. Thus, according to this model we propose that, besides the well characterized C-terminal autoinhibitory domain, the PMCA would contain an additional autoinhibitory membrane-binding domain. Autoinhibitory lipid-binding domains are characteristic of amphitropic proteins such as the CCT (cytidine 5′-triphosphate CTP phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase). The soluble CCT becomes activated when it binds to membrane lipids (36.Cornell R.B. Northwood I.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 441-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Like the PMCA, the CCT is highly sensitive to anionic phospholipids and fatty acids, and their effectiveness relates mainly to the negative charge of the head group. Moreover, in analogy with the d296–349 mutant, truncation of the CCT enzyme to remove the membrane-binding site generates a constitutive active enzyme (37.Lykidis A. Jackson P. Jackowski S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 494-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The nature of the apparent increase in Ca2+ affinity of the PMCA mediated by acidic lipids is a major quest for future work. It is worth mentioning that recent studies (31.Andersen J.P. Lykke-Moller Sorensen T. Povlsen K. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23312-23321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) of the SERCA have led to the proposal that the N-terminal portion of M3 is involved in the control of the access to the Ca2+ transport sites. In the PMCA, the occurrence of the AL region just upstream M3 may turn the function of this transmembrane segment unusually sensitive to the lipid composition of the membrane."

These morphological changes included increased spreading ability of transformed NIH 3T3 cells on fibronectin. Of the six tyrosine phosphorylation sites in pp125FAK, phosphorylation at position 861 (Tyr-861) was clearly decreased during detransformation by TSA. It resulted from decreased activity of Src family tyrosine kinase and/or decreased amount of Src kinase interacting with pp125FAK. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Tyr-861 was reduced substantially by the Src family kinase inhibitor, PP1, while overexpression of Src kinase increased its phosphorylation, implying that Src kinase regulates phosphorylation of pp125FAK at Tyr-861. All of these findings suggest that increased phosphorylation of pp125FAK at Tyr-861 correlates with Ras-induced transformation of fibroblasts, and TSA is able to detransform them through regulation of pp125FAK phosphorylation at Tyr-861 by an Src family kinase.

Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 21.Aplin A.E. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 695-705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3787) Google Scholar). As integrins bind to ECM, they become clustered and associate with cytoskeleton and signaling complexes that promote the assembly of actin filaments (20.Schoenwaelder S.M. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 22.Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3787) Google Scholar). The reorganization of actin filaments into larger stress fibers, in turn, causes more integrin clustering, thus enhancing matrix binding and organization by integrins in a positive feedback system (22.Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3787) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation has been shown to be a common and ubiquitous response to integrin-ECM interaction (22.Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3787) Google Scholar), and focal adhesion kinase (pp125FAK) is the major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein during cell-ECM interaction.pp125FAK participates in the regulation of cytoskeletal organization as a cytosolic kinase, which phosphorylates cytoskeletal proteins such as paxillin (23.Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), and/or a scaffolding protein for the recruitment of other Src homology 2 (SH2) or SH3-containing signaling molecules. Tyrosine phosphorylations of pp125FAK regulate its interactions and functions (24.Ilic D. Damsky C.H. Yamamoto T. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 401-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Six tyrosine phosphoacceptor sites in pp125FAK have been identified, namely Tyr-397, Tyr-407, Tyr-576, Tyr-577, Tyr-861, and Tyr-925 (25.Calalb M.B. Zhang X. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Biochem. Biophys.

Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). Upon integrin engagement, pp125FAK is autophosphorylated on Tyr-397 (27.Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W.

Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Association of c-Src leads to additional pp125FAK phosphorylation at Tyr-925 to create binding sites for SH2-containing proteins such as growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) (26.Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar, 31.Sieg D.J. Ilic D. Jones K.C. Damsky C.H. Hunter T. Schlaepfer D.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5933-5947Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), which in turn activates the ras cascade pathway. Maximal catalytic activity of pp125FAK is achieved by Tyr-576 and Tyr-577 phosphorylation and Src kinase association (25.Calalb M.B. Zhang X. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In addition, increased phosphorylation of Tyr-407 and Tyr-861 has been found in Src-transformed cells (25.Calalb M.B. Zhang X. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), but the exact role of this phosphorylation is unclear. Since many functions of pp125FAK are dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation, the high level of pp125FAK phosphorylation may alter the normal functions of pp125FAK. This is the case in cell transformation. pp125FAK is heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated in Src-transformed cells (28.Guan J.L. Shalloway D. Nature. 1992; 358: 690-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), with sites other than Tyr-397 also being phosphorylated (25.Calalb M.B. Zhang X. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 26.Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar), and most of the other tyrosine residues are phosphorylated by Src kinase in vitro (32.Owen J.D. Ruest P.J. Fry D.W. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4806-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Similar to transformed cells, increased metastatic activity of prostate cancer cell lines correlates with increased pp125FAK expression and increased overall tyrosine phosphorylation (33.Slack J.K. Adams R.B. Rovin J.D. Bissonette E.A. Stoker C.E. Parsons J.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1152-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems that tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK participates in regulation of transformation in fibroblasts.In the present study, we investigated the role of pp125FAK in detransformation using the HDAC inhibitor, TSA. Inhibition of HDAC activity down-regulates Src kinase activity, and in turn decreases phosphorylation of pp125FAK at Tyr-861. These changes, together with increased expression of several cytoskeletal proteins, result in spreading of Ha-ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells with a detransformed morphology. Therefore, TSA-induced detransformation correlates with decreased pp125FAK phosphorylation at tyrosine 861 in ras-transformed fibroblasts.DISCUSSIONThese studies show that Src family kinases are involved in Tyr-861 phosphorylation of pp125FAK, and this phosphorylation correlates with ras-induced transformation of fibroblasts. Inhibition of HDAC activity causes a decrease of Src activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK at Tyr-861, which results in detransformation of ras-transformed NIH3T3 fibroblasts.In our experimental scheme, TSA-induced detransformation is coincident with changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK. Among six known phosphorylation sites in pp125FAK, the most dramatic change is decreased phosphorylation at Tyr-861. A relationship between Tyr-861 phosphorylation and transformation and/or tumorigenesis has been proposed, since 1) phosphorylation of pp125FAK at Tyr-861 is increased in Src-transformed fibroblasts (25.Calalb M.B. Zhang X. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 26.Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar), and 2) increased phosphorylation of pp125FAK at Tyr-861 promotes increased cell migration in the highly tumorigenic prostate cell lines (33.Slack J.K. Adams R.B. Rovin J.D. Bissonette E.A. Stoker C.E. Parsons J.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1152-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Since decreased Tyr-861 phosphorylation of pp125FAK by TSA leads to a normal, detransformed morphology, this study strongly suggests that phosphorylation of pp125FAK at Tyr-861 is critical for the transformed morphology of fibroblasts.The phosphorylation of pp125FAK at Tyr-861 is decreased by PP1, a Src family kinase inhibitor, and is increased by overexpression of c-Src (Fig. 8, C and D). Consistent with decreased phosphorylation at Tyr-861, TSA-treated fibroblasts show decreased Src kinase activity (Fig. 8A) and decreased interaction of Src kinase with pp125FAK (Fig. 9). Thus, it is likely that Src kinase is involved in phosphorylation of pp125FAK Tyr-861. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that other kinases exist, since the in vitro concentrations of PP1 that yield 50% inhibition for two major Src family tyrosine kinase in fibroblasts, Fyn and Src, are 6 and 170 nm, respectively (37.Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar), and a significant reduction of phosphorylation at Tyr-861 requires about 10 μm PP1.How does HDAC activity regulate Src kinase activity? It is known that HDAC inhibitors increase the expression of gelsolin, a Ca2+-dependent actin filament-severing and capping protein, by transcriptional activation of the gelsolin gene (38.Kwon H.J. Yoshida M. Nagaoka R. Obinata T. Beppu T. Horinouchi S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2625-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 39.Tanaka M. Mullauer L. Ogiso Y. Fujita H. Moriya S. Fruuchi K. Harabayashi T. Shinohara N. Koyanagi T. Kuzumaki N. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3228-3232PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it may induce regulatory protein(s) that regulate Src kinase activity. Interestingly, HDAC inhibitor-induced morphological changes are suppressed by microinjection of anti-gelsolin antibodies, showing critical role of actin-associated proteins in cell morphological changes (38.Kwon H.J. Yoshida M. Nagaoka R. Obinata T. Beppu T. Horinouchi S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2625-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In fact, TSA induces several different proteins, including integrin β1, RhoA, and paxillin (Fig. 2). Since Src kinase activity is dependent on cytoskeletal organization, it may also be possible that detransformed morphology regulates Src kinase activity.At this point, it is unclear how increased tyrosine phosphorylation at Tyr-861 is associated with transformation of fibroblasts. It seems that the kinase activity of pp125FAK per se is not directly involved. Tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK remains unchanged at tyrosines 576 and 577 (Fig. 5) and is required for its maximal kinase activity. Consistently, pp125FAK activity is not affected by TSA based on in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 10). The amount of pp125FAK remains unchanged after TSA treatment, implying that Tyr-861 phosphorylation is not involved in the stability of pp125FAK. Tyr-861 phosphorylation may be involved in interaction of pp125FAK with other signaling molecules and may create a new binding site to recruit SH2-containing signaling molecules that promote fibroblast transformation. Alternatively, this phosphorylation may regulate the interaction of pp125FAK with SH3 domain-containing proteins, since Tyr-861 is located in the middle of two proline-rich regions, PR1 and PR2. These regions are involved in interaction with SH3 domain-containing proteins such as Graf and p130cas (40.Hildebrand J.D. Taylor J.M. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3169-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 41.Cary L.A. Han D.C. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Thus, it may interrupt the interaction of pp125FAK with SH3 domain-containing proteins, which negatively regulate transformation. Protein(s) specifically interacting with pp125FAK in transformed cells will provide more clear answers on the relationship between pp125FAK phosphorylation and transformation. Altered cellular structure, shape, and cytoskeletal architecture are hallmarks of malignant transformation (1.Spencer V.A. Davie J.R. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 2000; 35: 27-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the most characteristic cytoskeletal changes in tumor cells is the loss of actin stress fibers, suggesting that alteration of the actin-containing microfilament system is crucial for transformation (2.Kwon H.J. Owa T. Hassig C.A. Shimada J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3356-3361Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Several cytoskeletal proteins are known to be down-regulated in transformed cells (3.Zhong Y. Delgado Y. Gomez J. Lee S.W. Perez-Soler R. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1683-1687PubMed Google Scholar), and overexpression of the reduced proteins can revert the transformed cell morphology into normal phenotypes (4.Nakayama S. Sasaki A. Mese H. Alcalde R.E. Tsuji T. Matsumura T. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 93: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, cytoskeletal protein regulation is intrinsic to the morphology of transformed cells. Modification of chromatin structure by histone acetylation is an important mechanism in controlling gene transcription (5.Sun H. Taneja R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4058-4063Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 6.Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 89: 325-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). The acetylation state of histone is regulated by reversible enzymes, histone acetyltransferase and histone deacetylase (HDAC)1 (7.Knoepfler P.S. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1999; 99: 447-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 8.Ait-Si-Ali S. Ramirez S. Barre F.X. Dkhissi F. Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Girault J.A. Robin P. Knibiehler M.

Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Trichostatin A (TSA), a potent and specific inhibitor of HDAC (10.Hoshikawa K. Kwon H.J. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 11.Futamura M. Monden Y. Okabe T. Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Yokoyama S. Nishimura S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1119-1123PubMed Google Scholar), is widely used to study the role of histone acetylation in gene expression. Recently, it has been shown that inhibition of HDAC activity by TSA is able to revert the morphological changes seen following the transformation of cells in culture with v-sis and v-ras oncogenes (12.Sugita K. Koizumi K. Yoshida H. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 168-172PubMed Google Scholar). TSA-treated cells become more flattened and have well organized actin stress fibers (13.Suzuki T. Yokozaki H. Kuniyasu H.

A relationship between Tyr-861 phosphorylation and transformation and/or tumorigenesis has been proposed, since 1) phosphorylation of pp125FAK at Tyr-861 is increased in Src-transformed fibroblasts (25.Calalb M.B. Zhang X. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 26.Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar), and 2) increased phosphorylation of pp125FAK at Tyr-861 promotes increased cell migration in the highly tumorigenic prostate cell lines (33.Slack J.K. Adams R.B. Rovin J.D. Bissonette E.A. Stoker C.E. Parsons J.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1152-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Since decreased Tyr-861 phosphorylation of pp125FAK by TSA leads to a normal, detransformed morphology, this study strongly suggests that phosphorylation of pp125FAK at Tyr-861 is critical for the transformed morphology of fibroblasts.The phosphorylation of pp125FAK at Tyr-861 is decreased by PP1, a Src family kinase inhibitor, and is increased by overexpression of c-Src (Fig. 8, C and D). Consistent with decreased phosphorylation at Tyr-861, TSA-treated fibroblasts show decreased Src kinase activity (Fig. 8A) and decreased interaction of Src kinase with pp125FAK (Fig. 9). Thus, it is likely that Src kinase is involved in phosphorylation of pp125FAK Tyr-861. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that other kinases exist, since the in vitro concentrations of PP1 that yield 50% inhibition for two major Src family tyrosine kinase in fibroblasts, Fyn and Src, are 6 and 170 nm, respectively (37.Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar), and a significant reduction of phosphorylation at Tyr-861 requires about 10 μm PP1.How does HDAC activity regulate Src kinase activity? It is known that HDAC inhibitors increase the expression of gelsolin, a Ca2+-dependent actin filament-severing and capping protein, by transcriptional activation of the gelsolin gene (38.Kwon H.J. Yoshida M. Nagaoka R. Obinata T. Beppu T. Horinouchi S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2625-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 39.Tanaka M. Mullauer L. Ogiso Y. Fujita H. Moriya S. Fruuchi K. Harabayashi T. Shinohara N. Koyanagi T. Kuzumaki N. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3228-3232PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it may induce regulatory protein(s) that regulate Src kinase activity. Interestingly, HDAC inhibitor-induced morphological changes are suppressed by microinjection of anti-gelsolin antibodies, showing critical role of actin-associated proteins in cell morphological changes (38.Kwon H.J. Yoshida M. Nagaoka R. Obinata T. Beppu T. Horinouchi S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2625-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In fact, TSA induces several different proteins, including integrin β1, RhoA, and paxillin (Fig. 2). Since Src kinase activity is dependent on cytoskeletal organization, it may also be possible that detransformed morphology regulates Src kinase activity.At this point, it is unclear how increased tyrosine phosphorylation at Tyr-861 is associated with transformation of fibroblasts. It seems that the kinase activity of pp125FAK per se is not directly involved. Tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK remains unchanged at tyrosines 576 and 577 (Fig. 5) and is required for its maximal kinase activity. Consistently, pp125FAK activity is not affected by TSA based on in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 10). The amount of pp125FAK remains unchanged after TSA treatment, implying that Tyr-861 phosphorylation is not involved in the stability of pp125FAK. Tyr-861 phosphorylation may be involved in interaction of pp125FAK with other signaling molecules and may create a new binding site to recruit SH2-containing signaling molecules that promote fibroblast transformation. Alternatively, this phosphorylation may regulate the interaction of pp125FAK with SH3 domain-containing proteins, since Tyr-861 is located in the middle of two proline-rich regions, PR1 and PR2. These regions are involved in interaction with SH3 domain-containing proteins such as Graf and p130cas (40.Hildebrand J.D. Taylor J.M. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3169-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 41.Cary L.A. Han D.C. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Thus, it may interrupt the interaction of pp125FAK with SH3 domain-containing proteins, which negatively regulate transformation. Protein(s) specifically interacting with pp125FAK in transformed cells will provide more clear answers on the relationship between pp125FAK phosphorylation and transformation. These studies show that Src family kinases are involved in Tyr-861 phosphorylation of pp125FAK, and this phosphorylation correlates with ras-induced transformation of fibroblasts.

Two Tis-binding protein complexes, named vR1 and vR2, were observed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays using nuclear extracts from both KSHV-negative and -positive cell lines. A sequence fragment GAGTTAATAGGTAGAG in the cis-element was shown to be required for the DNA-protein interactions as well as the repression of vIRF promoter activity. Point-mutation analysis identified TTAAT and GTTAATAG as the core sequence motifs for the binding of vR1 and vR2, respectively.

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus viral interferon regulatory factor reverse transcriptase 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate dithiothreitol chloramphenicol acetyltransferase electrophoretic mobility shift assay The life cycle of herpesviruses consists of two phases: latent infection and lytic infection. Viral latent infection is generally associated with the development of herpesviruses-related tumors. Viral lytic replication often causes cell death; however, it also produces virions that are spread to other hosts (15.Kieff E. Shenk T. Semin. Virol. 1998; 8: 471-480Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In Kaposi's sarcoma tumors, the majority of KSHV-infected cells express viral latent antigens; nonetheless, a small number of these cells also undergo viral lytic replication (16.Moore P.S. Chang Y. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 2001; 356: 499-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). KSHV encodes a unique set of nonstructural genes targeting at cellular signaling pathways, most of which are viral lytic genes (17.Russo J.J. Bohenzky R.A. Chien M.C. Chen J. Yan M. Maddalena D. Parry J.P. Peruzzi D. Edelman I.S. Chang Y. Moore P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14862-14867Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that KSHV lytic replication in a small number of Kaposi's sarcoma tumor cells is essential for sustaining Kaposi's sarcoma lesions through a paracrine mechanism (16.Moore P.S. Chang Y. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 2001; 356: 499-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, delineation of the molecular mechanism controlling the expression of KSHV lytic genes could help understand the pathogenesis of KSHV-related diseases. One of the KSHV nonstructural regulatory lytic genes is the ORF-K9 that encodes the viral interferon regulatory factor (vIRF). vIRF is a 449-amino acid protein that shares sequence homology to cellular interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) (17.Russo J.J. Bohenzky R.A. Chien M.C. Chen J. Yan M. Maddalena D. Parry J.P. Peruzzi D. Edelman I.S. Chang Y. Moore P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Early reports have demonstrated that vIRF causes cellular transformation of NIH3T3 and Rat-1 cells through the inhibition of interferon- and IRF-mediated signal transduction, prevents UV-induced apoptosis, and regulates the expression of KSHV genes (25.Gao S.-J.

These results indicate that vIRF is a genuine viral oncogene and a potent transcriptional regulator. Elucidation of the molecular mechanism controlling vIRF expression could lead to the understanding of its precise role in regulating the expression of cellular and KSHV genes. Two ORF-K9-related transcripts, a major transcript of 1.7 kb and a minor transcript with additional 84 nt sequence upstream of the 5′-end of the major transcript have been identified (33.Chen J.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The expression of the minor transcript is weak, and can only be detected by nested-RT-PCR in uninduced KSHV-infected cells (33.Chen J. Ueda K. Sakakibara S. Okuno T. Yamanishi K. J.

The reaction was performed with 35 cycles at 94 °C for 40 s, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. vIRF promoter reporter constructs used in deletion analysis have been described previously (34.Wang X. Zhang Y. Deng J. Hong Y. Zhou F. Montalvo E.A. Gao S.-J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 1.052-kb DNA fragment spanning the region −991 to +62 relative to the vIRF gene transcriptional start site (+1) was inserted into the HindIII/XbaI sites of a promoter-less and enhancer-less chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) vector, pCAT-Basic to generate the reporter construct pCAT-991. The 5′-end sequence of pCAT-991 was then sequentially deleted to generate constructs pCAT-499 (−499 to +62), pCAT-337 (−337 to +62), pCAT-125 (−125 to +62), and pCAT-56 (−56 to +62) (Fig. 1, A and B). The CAT reporter plasmid pBLCATReg was constructed by inserting the PCR-amplified sequence from −337 to −125 upstream vIRF transcriptional start site into the HindIII/BamHI sites upstream of the HSV-TK promoter (pBLCAT2) fused to the CAT gene. pBLCATReg-rev was constructed by inserting the sequence from −337 to −125 in a reverse orientation into pBLCAT2 (Fig. 2A). CAT reporter plasmids pBLCATRegI, pBLCATRegII, and pBLCATRegIII were constructed by inserting the corresponding regulatory sequence of vIRF promoter into the HindIII/BamHI sites upstream of TK promoter in pBLCAT2. These plasmids contain the upstream regulatory sequences of vIRF promoter from −258 to −161, −323 to −234, and −499 to −334, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B). To further dissect the RegI sequence (−258 to −161), overlapping oligonucleotides (−258 to −230, −241 to −219, −231 to −201, and −203 to −161) (Table I) were synthesized and cloned into the SalI site upstream of TK promoter in pBLCAT2 to generate CAT reporter plasmids pBLCATRegI-1, pBLCATRegI-2, pBLCATRegI-3, and pBLCATRegI-4 (Fig. 4, A and B).Table IOligonucleotides used for mapping the cis-element upstream of vIRF gene promoterPrimersSequence of the primers (5′→3′)Regl-1GATTTTGTATGATGTTTCTCCACGAGTTARegl-2CTCCACGAGTTAATAGGTAGAGTRegl-3TAATAGGTAGAGTGCTCTTTCTGACATATCTRegl-4TCTTTTTTGGGTATGGTGGGTGGGGGTGGAGGGCGGCA GATTG Open table in a new tab ΔpCAT-991 was generated by deleting the RegI-2 sequence in wild type reporter plasmid pCAT-991 using QuikChangeTMSite-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Briefly, sequence deletion was performed on the pCAT-991 construct using oligonucleotide primers that lack the targeted sequence. The reaction was performed for 18 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 9 min. After temperature cycling, the parental supercoiled dsDNA was digested with DpnI restriction enzyme at 37 °C for 60 min and used to transform the Epicurian Coli XL1-Blue supercompetent cells (Stratagene). The oligonucleotides used for the deletion of RegI-2 sequence were as follows (* denotes deletion position): Da oligonucleotide 5′-GATTTTGTATGATGTTT*GCTCTTTCTGACATATC-3′; Ds oligonucleotide 5′-GATATGTCAGAAAGAGC*AAACATCATACAAAATC-3′. The constructs D1pBLCATRegI-2, D2pBLCATRegI-2, and D3pBLCATRegI-2 were generated by inserting the oligomers with the target sequence motifs deleted into the SalI site upstream of the TK promoter in pBLCAT2 (Fig. 7, A and B). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing with a Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit on an ABI 373-S sequencer (PE Bio-system, Foster City, CA). All plasmids used for transient transfection were prepared with QIAfilter Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Transfection experiments were performed with LipofectAMINETM 2000 reagent according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). CAT assay was performed as previously reported (25.Gao S.-J. Boshoff C. Jayachandra S. Weiss R.A. Chang Y. Moore P.S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1979-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiencies were normalized by co-transfection with a reporter plasmid pSV-β-galactosidase and β-galactosidase activity was determined following the instructions of the manufacturer (Promega). The conversion rate of the modified 14C-labeled chloramphenicol was calculated with a Multi-Analysis Program (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Nuclear extracts from HeLa, BC-1, BC-2, and BCBL-1 cells were prepared as described previously (40.Latchman D.S. Transcription Factors: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 107 cells were collected and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline by centrifugation. Each cell pellet was suspended in 400 μl of low-salt buffer (1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9)), and swelled on ice for 15 min. After the addition of 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40, the cell pellet was mixed and vortexed for 10 s. Following centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 s, the pellet containing the nuclei was resuspended by gentle stirring with a pipette tip in 50 μl of extraction buffer (25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9)). The mixture was then incubated with rocking for another 20 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 45 min, the supernatant was collected, diluted with equal amount of dilution buffer (5 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, and 1 mmDTT), and stored at −70 °C for future use. Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the Tis sequence (RegI-2), D1RegI-2, D2RegI-2, D3RegI-2, M6, and M9 were commercially synthesized and purified by PAGE (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA). The oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using a 5′-end labeling kit (Promega), and used as probes in EMSA experiments. The oligonucleotide sequences (single strand) were as follows: RegI-2, 5′-CTCCACGAGTTAATAGGTAGAGT-3′; D1RegI-2, 5′-CTCTTAATAGGTAGAGT-3′; D2RegI-2, 5′-CTCCACGAGTAGAGT-3′; D3RegI-2, 5′-CTCCACGAGTTAAGT-3; M6, 5′-GAGTTGATAGGTAGAG-3′; M9, 5′-GAGTTAATCGGTAGAG-3′. EMSA was performed in 10 μl of reaction volume at room temperature. Each reaction mixture (10 μg of cell nuclear extracts, 0.5 μg of double-stranded poly(dI-dC), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 4% glycerol) was incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and then for an additional 20 min after the addition of the probe (30,000–50,000 cpm). For competition experiment, the reaction mixture was preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with 100-fold excess of competitor DNA before the addition of the radiolabeled probe. For antibody supershift assay, the radiolabeled probe was added after the reaction mixture was incubated for 45 min at room temperature with 1 μl of antibodies to either c-Myc or Nkx2.5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or δEF1 (a gift of Dr. Yujiro Higashi). The samples were then separated in a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE at 320 V for 45 min. To determine the core sequence motif(s) of Tis, the M0 oligomer, 5′-GAGTTAATAGGTAGAG-3′ (Fig. 8A), was used as wild type sequence. Sequential point mutations were introduced for each of the nucleotides to test their effects on DNA-protein interactions. The mutant oligomers were employed as competitors in EMSA with the labeled oligomer Tis as probe. The wild type and mutant oligomers were listed in Fig. 8A. In a previous study, we have mapped the vIRF core promoter to a DNA fragment from +62 to −56 upstream of vIRF transcriptional start site (34.Wang X. Zhang Y. Deng J. Hong Y. Zhou F. Montalvo E.A. Gao S.-J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Reporter plasmids containing DNA fragments from +62 to −56 (pCAT-56) and −125 (pCAT-125) had strong CAT activities similar to pBLCAT2 (Fig. 1). In contrast, reporter plasmids containing DNA fragments from +62 to −337 (pCAT-337), −499 (pCAT-499), and −991 (pCAT-991) had 88, 91, and 93% reduced CAT activities, respectively, compared with pCAT-125 (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that the 5′-flanking region of vIRF gene contains a negative regulatory cis-element repressing its promoter activity and this element is located at the region from −337 to −125 upstream of vIRF gene transcriptional start site. To determine whether the upstream negative regulatory cis-element of the vIRF gene promoter can exert its effect on a heterologous promoter, a single copy of the DNA fragment (−337 to −125) was inserted into the upstream of the TK promoter in pBLCAT2 (Fig. 2A) to generate pBLCATReg plasmid. Compared with that of pBLCAT2, the TK promoter activity (pBLCATReg) was reduced 87% in HeLa cells (Fig. 2B), indicating that the cis-element also has a repression effect on the heterologous TK promoter. Similarly, the TK promoter activity was reduced 85% when the cis-element was inserted in a reverse orientation into pBLCAT2 (pBLCATReg-rev and Fig. 2B), indicating that the repression function of the cis-element is orientation-independent. To map the region involved in the repression of promoter activity, the sequence region from −337 to −125 was dissected into two fragments (−161 to −258 and −234 to −323), and their corresponding CAT reporter plasmids pBLCATRegI and pBLCATRegII were constructed by inserting these fragments into the upstream of TK promoter in pBLCAT2 (Fig. 3, A and B). Since the sequence region from −499 to −334 had no repression effect (Fig. 1), its corresponding construct pBLCATRegIII was used as a control. When transiently transfected into HeLa cells, pBLCATRegII showed promoter activity similar to pBLCATRegIII, suggesting the region from −323 to −234 is not responsible for the repression of promoter activity. In contrast, pBLCATRegI had 85% lower promoter activity than that of the parental plasmid pBLCAT2 (Fig. 3C), indicating that the region between −258 and −161 in the vIRF gene promoter is involved in the transcriptional repression of the promoter activity. To further map the negative regulatory cis-element, 4 overlapping oligonucleotides within the region from −258 to −161 (RegI) were synthesized and used to construct plasmids pBLCATRegI-1, pBLCATRegI-2, pBLCATRegI-3, and pBLCATRegI-4 (Fig. 4, A and B). As shown in Fig. 4C, pBLCATRegI-1, pBLCATRegI-3, and pBLCATRegI-4 had CAT activities similar to that of pBLCAT2. In contrast, pBLCATRegI-2 had 85% lower CAT activities than that of the parental plasmid pBLCAT2. These results indicate that the RegI-2 sequence contains the negative regulatory cis- element, whose negative repression function is independent on its position to the TATA box. To further confirm the effect of RegI-2 on the repression of vIRF promoter activity, RegI-2 sequence was deleted in the reporter plasmid pCAT-991 by site-directed mutagenesis. As shown in Fig. 5, deletion of the RegI-2 sequence (ΔpCAT-991) relieved its repression effect on wild type pCAT-991. The CAT activity of ΔpCAT-991 reached 78% of pCAT-125 (100%). These results demonstrated the critical role of the RegI-2 sequence on the repression of vIRF promoter activity. Taken together, the above results indicate that the negative regulatory cis-element (−241 to −219) in vIRF promoter is a transcriptional silencer, and is named Tis. To determine whether Tis has any potential binding site(s) for transcriptional repressor(s), its sequence, RegI-2 (5′-CTCCACGAGTTAATAGGTAGAGT-3′), was used as a probe in an EMSA. As shown in Fig. 6A, when crude nuclear extract from HeLa cells was used, two major shifted complexes were observed (lane 2). Treatment of the nuclear extracts with unlabeled RegI-2 strongly inhibited the intensities of the shifted complexes (lane 3), indicating that both shifted complexes were RegI-2-specific DNA-protein interaction complexes. The protein complexes bound to the upper and lower bands were named as vIRF regulatory sequence-binding protein complex 1 and 2 (vR1 and vR2), respectively. To determine whether the DNA-protein binding pattern could be reproduced in KSHV-infected cell lines, the nuclear extracts from BC-1, BC-2, and BCBL-1 cells were employed in EMSA. As shown in Fig. 6B, the RegI-2-specific DNA-protein interaction complexes were also observed in BC-1, BC-2, and BCBL-1 cell lines, indicating that the RegI-2-binding proteins are present in both KSHV-negative and -positive cell lines. To define the binding site(s) of transcriptional repressor(s) involved in the transcriptional repression, the MatInspector2.2 program was used to analyze the potential binding sites of transcriptional factors (41.Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar). Comparative analysis of RegI-2 sequence with the GenBankTM data base did not identify any identical binding sequence of known transcriptional factors. However, the sequence was found to contain the core sequence motifs corresponding to several potential transcriptional factor(s), including a Myc/Max motif, a Nkx2.5 motif, and an δEF1 motif (Fig. 7A). To determine whether these sequence motifs were related to the repression of promoter activity, deletions corresponding to these motifs were introduced into the wild type RegI-2 sequence (23 nucleotides) (Fig. 7B). The resulting oligonucleotide D1RegI-2 (5′-CTCTTAATAGGTAGAGT-3′), D2RegI-2 (5′-CTCCACGAGTAGAGT-3′), and D3RegI-2 (5′-CTCCACGAGTTAAGT-3′) were used to generate reporter constructs D1pBLCATRegI-2, D2pBLCATRegI-2, and D3pBLCATRegI-2. In a transient transfection assay, deletions of the sequence motifs TTAATAGG (D2pBLCATRegI-2) and ATAGGTAG (D3pBLCATRegI-2) relieved the RegI-2 (pBLCATRegI-2) repression of TK promoter activity by 80 and 50%, respectively. In contrast, deletion of the sequence motif CACGAG (D1pBLCATRegI-2) had no effect on relieving the RegI-2 repression of TK promoter activity of pBLCATRegI-2 (Fig. 7C), suggesting that the sequence motifs TTAATAGG and ATAGGTAG are critical for the repression of promoter activity. To further determine whether these sequence motifs are critical for the binding of vR1 and vR2, the oligonucleotides D1RegI-2, D2RegI-2, and D3RegI-2 were used as competitors of RegI-2 probe in an EMSA. As shown in Fig. 7D, D1RegI-2 with the sequence motif CACGAG deleted strongly competed with RegI-2 for the formation of both vR1 and vR2 (lane 6). This pattern is similar to that when RegI-2 itself is used as a competitor (lane 3), suggesting that the sequence motif CACGAG is not essential for the binding of the repressor(s). When the oligomers D2RegI-2 (lane 4) and D3RegI-2 (lane 5) were used as competitors, the DNA-protein binding pattern remained unchanged, indicating that both sequence motifs TTAATAGG and ATAGGTAG were essential for the DNA-protein interactions. Indeed, the oligomer D1RegI-2 produced the same shifted patterns as RegI-2 did (Fig. 7E). In contrast, no shifted complex could be detected when labeled oligomers D2RegI-2 and D3RegI-2 were used as probes (Fig. 7, F and G). Taken together, these findings suggest that both sequence motifs TTAATAGG and ATAGGTAG are required for the binding of the repressor(s). To determine the contribution of each nucleotide in the DNA-protein interaction and identify the core binding motifs of the transcriptional repressor(s), point mutations were introduced into the wild type oligomer (M0) sequence 5′-GAGTTAATAGGTAGAG-3′. A panel of sequential mutant oligonucleotides (M1 to M15) were generated and used as competitors in an EMSA using oligomer RegI-2 as a probe (Fig. 8A). As shown in Fig. 8B, the wild type oligomer M0 had strong competition for both vR1 and vR2. When used as competitors, the mutants M1, M2, and M11 to M15 had almost the same competition effect as RegI-2 for both vR1 and vR2 complexes. However, mutants M4 to M8 competed less efficiently for vR1, indicating that the TTAAT motif is required for the binding of vR1 (Fig. 8, B and C). Similarly, mutan"
