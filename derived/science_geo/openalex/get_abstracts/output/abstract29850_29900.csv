https://openalex.org/W2156087814,"Episialin is a mucin-type glycoprotein present at the luminal side of most glandular epithelial cells. We have isolated cDNA clones encoding episialin and determined the structure of the gene. The gene encodes a transmembrane protein which consists of, for the greater part, tandem repeats of 20 amino acids. The number of these repeats varies between 40 and 90 among different alleles. The repeats and most of the remainder of the protein are very rich in potential O-linked glycosylation sites. Two different splice variants were found. Interestingly, the proteins encoded by these two variants differ in their signal sequences and in the extreme amino-terminal parts of the mature proteins, suggesting alternative processing of these two species."
https://openalex.org/W1520666812,"We have hypothesized that ligand-induced binding sites (LIBS), i.e. sites expressed on cell surface receptors only after ligand binding causes the receptor to change shape, mediate subsequent biological events. To test this hypothesis, we have raised monoclonal antibodies that preferentially react with an integrin (platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa) after it bind Arg-Gly-Asp-containing ligands. The 13 anti-LIBS antibodies obtained define at least three distinct GPIIb-IIIa epitopes; one of these epitopes is also expressed following occupancy of another integrin, the vitronectin receptor. Certain of these LIBSs appear to mediate functions, since the antibodies that define them inhibit GPIIb-IIIa-mediated fibrin clot contraction or platelet adhesion to collagen. Nevertheless, none of the anti-LIBS antibodies inhibit binding of the primary ligand, fibrinogen. These data indicate that LIBS may mediate distinct consequences of receptor occupancy."
https://openalex.org/W1533579770,"Treatment of suspension-cultured parsley (Petroselinum crispum) cells with fungal elicitor triggers rapid, transient and sequential phosphorylation of a number of proteins, as shown by electrophoretic analysis on two-dimensional gels. This response is rapidly reversed by removal of the elicitor from the medium and appears to be specific. It is not observed in cells exposed to other environmental stress factors, such as heat shock, UV irradiation or treatment with mercuric chloride. Pronase digestion of the elicitor has the same negative effect on protein phosphorylation as its previously demonstrated effect on the activation of some pathogen defense-related genes, suggesting a link between these two phenomena. Some of the changes in protein phosphorylation are among the earliest known events following elicitation. The phosphorylation of a neutral 45-kDa protein, which is found in both the microsomal and cytoplasmic fractions, can be observed as early as 1 min after the onset of elicitor treatment. The phosphorylation of a 26-kDa nuclear protein also starts increasing very early. The changes in protein phosphorylation in response to the elicitor are dependent on the presence of Ca2+ in the medium. Our data are compatible with the hypothesis that protein phosphorylation is involved in the signal transduction processes following elicitor recognition by parsley cells."
https://openalex.org/W1488147817,"The effects of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on terminal differentiation of chondrocytes and cartilage-matrix calcification were investigated. Rabbit growth-plate chondrocytes maintained as a pelleted mass in a centrifuge tube produced an abundant proteoglycan matrix during the matrix-maturation stage, yielding a cartilage-like tissue. Thereafter, they terminally differentiated to hypertrophic chondrocytes which produced high levels of alkaline phosphatase. These cells induced extensive calcification of the matrix in the absence of additional phosphate (Kato, Y., Iwamoto, M., Koike, T., Suzuki, F., and Takano, Y. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 85, 9552-9556). Addition of bFGF to the chondrocyte cultures abolished the increases in alkaline phosphatase activity, 45Ca deposition, and the calcium content. These effects were dose-dependent, reversible, and observed in the presence of cytosine arabinoside, an inhibitor of DNA synthesis. The inhibitory effects could be observed only when chondrocytes were exposed to bFGF in a transition period between the matrix-maturation and hypertrophic stages. As chondrocytes differentiated to hypertrophic cells, bFGF became less effective in inhibiting the expression of the mineralization-related phenotypes. The present study also shows that although the rate of [35S]sulfate incorporation into large, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan in the cell-matrix fraction is very high during the matrix-maturation stage, it abruptly decreases by 90% after terminal differentiation. Furthermore, the terminal differentiation-associated decrease in proteoglycan synthesis was delayed by bFGF. These results provide evidence that bFGF inhibits terminal differentiation of chondrocytes and calcification."
https://openalex.org/W1523952463,"We have characterized the odorant binding properties of purified bovine odorant-binding protein (OBP) using as a ligand [3H]3,7-dimethyloctan-1-ol ([3H]DMO). A broad variety of odorants, including terpenes, aldehydes, esters, and musks, bind to OBP with affinities of 0.2 to 100 microM. Odorant affinities for OBP correlate most closely with their stimulation of an odorant-sensitive adenylyl cyclase as well as hydrophobicity. We also measured the kinetics of binding for the ligands, [3H]DMO and 2-isobutyl-3-[3H]methoxypyrazine. Dissociation of both is markedly accelerated in the presence of excess unlabeled ligand. Competition curves of displacers for [3H]DMO binding are shallow, and saturation binding isotherms for 3H-odorants are curvilinear. These kinetic and equilibrium binding properties suggest that OBP interactions with odorant ligands are negatively cooperative."
https://openalex.org/W1583477127,"A protein kinase C alpha (PKC alpha) cDNA confers increased phorbol ester binding activity to intact cells when transiently expressed in COS cells or expressed stably in transfected rat 3Y1 fibroblasts. A point mutant (PKC alpha K----R) of PKC alpha, where Lys368 at the putative ATP-binding site is replaced with Arg, confers enhanced phorbol ester binding activity to both transiently and stably expressed COS and 3Y1 cells, respectively. Like endogenous and exogenously expressed wild type PKC alpha, the mutant PKC alpha K----R is translocated from the cytosol to the particulate fraction when cells are treated with a phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). On the other hand, the mutant PKC alpha K----R is not degraded when cells are treated with TPA, making a clear contrast to wild type PKC alpha; i.e. the mutant is resistant to TPA-mediated down-regulation. The mutant lacks kinase activity as expected, as judged by autophosphorylation and by a kinase assay using a peptide substrate, although the phorbol ester binding activity remains intact. These results suggest a link between the kinase activity of PKC alpha and the sensitivity to TPA-mediated proteolytic degradation. We propose that autophosphorylation of PKC alpha is a prerequisite for proteolytic cleavage associated with the down-regulation of PKC alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1483429575,"Radioimmunoassays that detect pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts and cyclobutane dimers were used to determine the relative induction of these photoproducts in nucleosomal (core) and internucleosomal (linker) DNA in human cell chromatin irradiated with UV light. Cyclobutane dimers were formed in equal amounts/nucleotide in core and linker DNA, whereas (6-4) photoproducts occurred with 6-fold greater frequency/nucleotide in linker DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1552492783,"Previous studies indicated that synthesis of B beta chain may be a rate-limiting factor in the production of human fibrinogen since Hep G2 cells contain surplus pools of A alpha and gamma but not of B beta chains, and fibrinogen assembly commences by the addition of preformed A alpha and gamma chains to nascent B beta chains attached to polysomes. To test whether B beta chain synthesis is rate limiting Hep G2 cells were transfected with B beta cDNA, and its effect on fibrinogen synthesis and secretion was measured. Two sets of stable B beta cDNA-transfected Hep G2 cells were prepared, and both cell lines synthesized 3-fold more B beta chains than control cells. The B beta-transfected cells also synthesized and secreted increased amounts of fibrinogen. Transfection with B beta cDNA not only increased the synthesis of B beta chain but also increased the rate of synthesis of the other two component chains of fibrinogen and maintained surplus intracellular pools of A alpha and gamma chains. Transfection with B beta cDNA did not affect the synthesis of albumin, transferrin, or anti-chymotrypsin and had a small inhibitory effect on the synthesis of C-reactive protein. Taken together these studies demonstrate that increased B beta chain synthesis specifically causes increased production of the other two component chains of fibrinogen and that unequal and surplus amounts of A alpha and gamma chains are maintained intracellularly."
https://openalex.org/W1581245087,"Cell-free protein-synthesizing systems derived from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells that have been exposed to elevated temperatures retain the inhibition of translation that is seen at the cellular level. A multisubunit cap binding protein complex able to restore protein synthesis in these cell free systems was purified from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells via affinity chromatography using m7GTP-Sepharose and fast protein liquid chromatography on Mono Q. The purified complex contains an Mr 220,000 polypeptide (p220) and an Mr 28,000 polypeptide (p28), both of which are components of eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF-4F). p28 is identical to eIF-4E. Restoring activity was relatively free of the Mr 46,000 polypeptide (p46) that is the third component of eIF-4F and does not appear to be dependent on its presence. p28 associated in a complex with p220 is 85% phosphorylated; however, the majority of p28 is not associated with p220, and this free form is only about 50% phosphorylated. The correlation between association of p28 with p220 and high levels of p28 phosphorylation suggests a possible role for phosphorylation in association of p220 with p28."
https://openalex.org/W1591744435,"The of the basolateral Na+/bile acid (taurocholate) cotransport system of rat hepatocytes has been studied in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Injection of rat liver poly(A)+ RNA into the oocytes resulted in the functional of Na+ gradient stimulated taurocholate uptake within 3-5 days. This Na(+)-dependent portion of taurocholate uptake exhibited saturation kinetics (apparent Km approximately 91 microM) and could be inhibited by 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-disulfonic acid stilbene. Furthermore, the expressed taurocholate transport activity demonstrated similar substrate inhibition and stimulation by low concentrations of bovine serum albumin as the basolateral Na+/bile acid cotransport system previously characterized in intact liver, isolated hepatocytes, and isolated plasma membrane vesicles. Finally, a 1.5- to 3.0-kilobase size-class of mRNA could be identified that was sufficient to express the basolateral Na+/taurocholate uptake system in oocytes. These results demonstrate that expression cloning represents a promising approach to ultimately clone the gene and to further characterize the molecular properties of this important hepatocellular membrane transport system."
https://openalex.org/W1558889227,"Treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome with azidothymidine (AZT, zidovudine) reduces p24 antigenemia, increases CD4 lymphocyte counts, reduces the frequency and severity of opportunistic infections and prolongs life. However, AZT and other dideoxynucleosides do not diminish the ability to isolate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Failure to clear infectious virus may be due to inadequate inhibition of virus production by macrophages, a major reservoir of HIV infection. Cells of the macrophage lineage take up large amounts of parenterally administered liposomal material. To direct larger proportions of antiretroviral nucleosides to this important HIV reservoir, we synthesized phosphatidylAZT, AZT diphosphate dipalmitin, phosphatidylddC and phosphatidylddT, novel phospholipid prodrugs which are readily incorporated into phospholipid bilayers. These liposomal liponucleotides were shown to have antiretroviral activity in HIV-infected U937 and CEM cells. In vivo, it is anticipated that liposomes containing the antiretroviral liponucleotides will be taken up in large proportion by macrophages. This property would appear to make phosphatidylAZT and the related compounds promising candidate agents with a special potential to target drug to the macrophage reservoir of HIV infection, thereby reducing the toxicity of the antiviral nucleosides to other cells."
https://openalex.org/W1524646539,"Detailed structure-function information about human lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is unavailable because it is difficult to purify large amounts of the enzyme for study. To circumvent this problem, we constructed an in vitro LPL expression vector. Human LPL cDNA was cloned and inserted into the expression vector p91023(B). After transfection of COS M-6 cells with the human LPL cDNA construct, LPL enzyme activity was detected in cell extracts and culture medium. Purified human apolipoprotein C-II caused a 5-fold stimulation of the recombinant human LPL expressed in vitro. Using site-specific mutagenesis, Ala residues were substituted for Asn residues at two potential N-linked glycosylation sites (positions 43 and 359) and at a third unrelated Asn (position 257) in the LPL cDNA. RNA blot analysis demonstrated the presence of a single mRNA species in COS cells transfected with wild-type and mutant LPL expression vectors. Intracellular and secreted LPL activity was absent in the construct containing an Ala for Asn mutation at position 43, whereas the same substitutions at positions 257 and 359 did not appreciably affect activity. LPL activity was also absent in another construct containing a Gln for Asn mutation at position 43. Quantitation of LPL protein mass concomitant with measurement of enzyme activity showed that substitution of Ala or Gln for Asn at position 43 resulted in the production of an enzymatically inactive protein which accumulated intracellularly but was not secreted into the culture medium. Our report represents an initial documentation of the expression of cloned human LPL in vitro and of the importance of Asn-43 for both enzyme activity and secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1574588787,"The synthesis of fibrinogen in the liver is drastically enhanced during the inflammatory process. Two factors are involved: glucocorticoids and the hepatocyte stimulating factor which is identical with interleukin 6 (Il6), also called interferon beta 2. The function of the 5'-flanking region of the human beta-fibrinogen (beta-Fg) gene has been studied by deletion analysis with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene as a transient expression vector. In this analysis, a fragment containing 150 base pairs (bp) upstream from the cap site is sufficient to drive expression of the CAT gene in the hepatoma cells HepG2, but not in HeLa cells. The beta-Fg gene is induced by dexamethasone and Il6 in HepG2. We identify a domain located between -2900 and -1500 bp upstream from the transcription start point involved in dexamethasone sensibility. This distal regulatory region can confer hormone inductibility to a heterologous promoter and exert its effect in either orientation. The sequence located between -150 and -82 bp upstream from the transcription start point is responsive for the Il6-stimulated expression. This 68-bp sequence contains probably all the cis-acting Il6-responsive element of the human beta-Fg gene."
https://openalex.org/W1535120995,"Soluble proteins which reside in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum share a common carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptide Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL). Addition of the tetrapeptide to a normally secreted protein is both necessary and sufficient to cause retention in the endoplasmic reticulum. In order to characterize the critical residues in the KDEL signal, cDNAs encoding proneuropeptide Y (pro-NPY) with the 4-amino acid carboxyl-terminal extension KDEL or a series of KDEL variants were expressed in the AtT-20 cell line. AtT-20 cells, a mouse anterior pituitary corticotrope cell line, synthesize, process, and secrete the pro-ACTH/endorphin precursor. Since post-translational processing in AtT-20 cells has been extensively characterized, it provides a model system in which the processing of a foreign peptide precursor (pro-NPY) and the endogenous precursor (pro-ACTH/endorphin) can be compared. Altered cDNAs encoding pro-NPY with KDEL, DKEL, RDEL, KNEL, KDQL, or KDEA at the COOH terminus were used to generate stable AtT-20 cell lines. The processing of pro-NPY to neuropeptide Y and the carboxyl-terminal peptide was studied using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, tryptic peptide mapping, and radiosequencing. Addition of the tetrapeptides KDEL, DKEL, RDEL, or KNEL to the COOH terminus of the neuropeptide Y precursor, a peptide hormone normally processed and secreted from neuronal cells, caused complete intracellular retention of the unprocessed prohormone in AtT-20 cells. However, KDQL and KDEA-extended pro-NPY molecules were processed and secreted like wild-type pro-NPY when expressed in AtT-20 cells. The secretion of proNPY-derived peptides in these cell lines paralleled secretion of endogenous pro-ACTH/endorphin-derived products under both basal and stimulated conditions. These mutagenesis studies demonstrate that variants of the KDEL retention signal can direct intracellular retention."
https://openalex.org/W2104497370,"Preparations of mRNA isolated from rabbit lung and liver were used in the construction of libraries that were screened for cDNAs encoding the pulmonary or hepatic isozyme of the flavin-containing monooxygenase. The hepatic library was screened with cDNA encoding the flavin-containing monooxygenase expressed in pig liver, and a clone containing a 2.0-kilobase insert was detected and isolated. This cDNA insert encoded a protein of 535 amino acids with a primary structure 87% identical to that of the pig flavin-containing monooxygenase. The pulmonary library was screened with polyclonal antibodies to the flavin-containing monooxygenase expressed in rabbit lung, and a clone containing a 2.6-kilobase insert was detected and isolated. Although the protein encoded by this insert also contained 535 amino acids, its primary sequence was only 56% identical to that of the liver enzyme. The sequences of several peptides obtained by digestion of the purified rabbit pulmonary flavin-containing monooxygenase with trypsin matched exactly with sequences derived from the cDNA structure. Tissue-specific distribution of mRNA for the hepatic and pulmonary isozymes of the flavin-containing monooxygenase was consistent with the distribution of protein, an indication that expression of flavin-containing monooxygenase is controlled at the level of transcription. Analysis of genomic DNA indicates that both the hepatic and pulmonary enzymes may be products of single genes."
https://openalex.org/W1608248046,"To gain insight into the transport of sterol from lysosomes to the plasma membrane, we studied the efflux of lysosomal free cholesterol from intact Fu5AH rat hepatoma cells to high density lipoprotein (HDL) and other extracellular acceptors that promote sterol desorption from the plasma membrane. The procedures involved pulsing cells at 15 degrees C with low density lipoprotein that had been reconstituted with [3H]cholesteryl oleate and then incubating the cells at 37 degrees C in the presence of a sterol acceptor, while monitoring both the hydrolysis of [3H]cholesteryl oleate in lysosomes and the efflux of the resulting [3H]free cholesterol to the acceptor. After warming cells to 37 degrees C, rapid hydrolysis of [3H]cholesteryl oleate began after 10-20 min, and the lysosomally generated [3H]free cholesterol became available for efflux after an additional delay of 40-50 min. The kinetics of hydrolysis and the delay between hydrolysis and efflux were unchanged over a wide range of HDL3 concentrations (10-1000 micrograms of protein/ml), and with acceptors that do not interact with HDL-specific cell surface binding sites (phospholipid vesicles, dimethyl suberimidate cross-linked HDL). In addition, the delivery of lysosomal cholesterol to the plasma membrane was unaffected when cellular cholesterol content was elevated 2.6-fold above the normal control level, or when the activity of cellular acyl-coenzyme A/cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) was stimulated with exogenous oleic acid. We conclude that in the Fu5AH cell, a maximum of 40-50 min is required for the transport of cholesterol from lysosomes to the plasma membrane and that this transport is not regulated in response to either specific extracellular acceptors or the content of sterol in cells. The lack of effect of increased ACAT activity implies that the pathway for this transport does not involve passage of sterol through the rough endoplasmic reticulum, the subcellular location of ACAT."
https://openalex.org/W1529243021,"The reconstruction of the purified sodium- and chloride-coupled gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter from rat brain into asolectin liposomes requires the addition of brain lipids (Radian, R., and Kanner, B. I. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 11859-11865). The reconstitution assay was used to identify the component(s) from brain lipids responsible for the stimulation during the fractionation of brain lipids. The distribution of the active component was found to be similar to that of cholesterol. Furthermore, cholesterol was found to mimic the effect of brain lipids and it stimulated the transport activity up to 20-fold. Optimal reconstituted transport activity was achieved with mixtures of cholesterol and any one of several phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylglycerol. gamma-Aminobutyric acid transport in these liposomes of defined composition exhibited all the properties of the native transporter, such as the absolute dependence on sodium and chloride and electrogenicity. Cholesterol could not be replaced by cholest-4-en-3one and other steroids, and thus its effect is probably not due to effects on membrane fluidity. The requirement was also not due to effects on intactness of the liposomes or incorporation of proteins into them. Furthermore it was found that the reconstitution of the sodium and potassium coupled L-glutamic acid transporter from rat brain also required cholesterol. However, in this case the optimal activity was reached by 4-5-fold lower levels of cholesterol than those necessary for gamma-aminobutyric acid transport. When cholesterol depletion from the transporters was incomplete, addition of exogenous brain lipids was not required. Thus, if the cholesterol was still associated with the transporter proteins, its final concentration, as a fraction of the total lipids present in the reconstitution mixture, was only about 0.01 mol%. Thus, it is likely that the effects of cholesterol are due to direct interactions with the cotransporters and not to an average effect on membrane properties."
https://openalex.org/W1497115893,"Three newly discovered non-heme bromoperoxidases isolated from marine algae were found to catalyze the production of singlet oxygen in reactions composed of the bromoperoxidase, hydrogen peroxide, and bromide. The bromoperoxidases studied were vanadium bromoperoxidase (V-BrPO) from Ascophyllum nodosum, native non-heme bromoperoxidase from Corallina vancouveriensis (which contains vanadium and iron), and the vanadium-reconstituted bromoperoxidase derivative from C. vancouveriensis. These enzyme systems generated near infrared emission, characteristic of singlet oxygen. The emission had a peak intensity near 1268 nm, was greatly increased in 2H2O-containing buffers, and was greatly decreased by the singlet oxygen quenchers, histidine and azide. The yield of singlet oxygen was approximately 80% of the theoretical yield. A unique feature of the non-heme bromoperoxidases distinct from the iron heme haloperoxidases, was the remarkable stability of the non-heme enzymes in the presence of singlet oxygen and oxidized bromine species. V-BrPO turned over multiple aliquots of 2 mM hydrogen peroxide without losing efficiency. In contrast, iron heme lactoperoxidase was completely inactivated after turnover of the first aliquot of 2 mM hydrogen peroxide, and iron heme chloroperoxidase was 50% deactivated. The profile of singlet oxygen formation by V-BrPO and the near stoichiometric yield of singlet oxygen suggest that the mechanism of singlet oxygen formation is the same as the mechanism of dioxygen formation determined by oxygen probe measurements."
https://openalex.org/W1558718094,"Cysteine conjugate S-oxidase activity, with S-benzyl-L-cysteine as substrate, was found mostly in the microsomal fractions of rat liver and kidney. In the presence of oxygen and NADPH, S-benzyl-L-cysteine is converted to S-benzyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide; no S-benzyl-L-cysteine sulfone was detected. The Vmax for S-benzyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide formation by kidney microsomes was nearly 3-fold greater than the rate measured with liver microsomes. Inclusion of catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione, butylated hydroxyanisole, the peroxidase inhibitor, potassium cyanide, the cytochrome P-450 inhibitors, 1-benzylimidazole and metyrapone, or a monoclonal antibody to cytochrome P-450 reductase did not inhibit the metabolic reaction. Flavin-containing monooxygenase alternate substrates, N,N-dimethylaniline, n-octylamine, and methimazole inhibited the S-oxidase activities. Analogues of S-benzyl-L-cysteine, S-methyl-L-cysteine, and S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine inhibited the S-benzyl-L-cysteine S-oxidase activities, whereas S-carboxymethyl-L-cysteine and S-benzyl-L-cysteine methyl ester had no effect. These results provide clear evidence against the involvement of reactive oxygen intermediates or cytochrome P-450 in the sulfoxidation of S-benzyl-L-cysteine and indicate that the S-oxidase activities may be associated with flavin-containing monooxygenases which exhibit selectivity in the interaction with cysteine S-conjugates."
https://openalex.org/W1587933079,"The domain structure of transcription termination factor rho was analyzed by partial trypsin cleavage and by photoaffinity labeling with ATP and oligo(C)5. A rho subunit consists of three distinct domains of nearly equal size that are connected by trypsin-sensitive linker segments. The amino-terminal domain binds to oligo(C)5 and has sequence segments with extended similarity to conserved elements in other RNA-binding proteins and a segment that has identities with another known cytidine nucleotide-binding protein. The middle domain has the ATP-binding site and has most of the sequence segments with similarity to conserved elements in other nucleoside triphosphate-binding proteins. The function of the third domain, the carboxyl-terminal domain, has not been identified. Both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains are relatively resistant to further trypsin treatment. The ATP-binding domain is also relatively resistant when it is linked to the amino-terminal, RNA-binding domain, but has not been detected as a separate digestion product. This result plus the finding that ADP and ATP inhibit the cleavage in the linker between the two domains indicate that those domains interact intimately in spite of their functional distinctions."
https://openalex.org/W96591720,"A novel parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHRP) has been isolated from tumors associated with the syndrome of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. The human PTHRP gene appears to use multiple promoters and contains alternatively spliced 3' exons which give rise to three PTHRP mRNA classes, each bearing multiple copies of an AU motif that has been associated with mRNA instability. We report here that inhibition of protein synthesis leads to the super-induction of PTHRP mRNA expression in a number of human and rat cell lines. This phenomenon was found to reflect both an increase in the rate of PTHRP gene transcription and a stabilization of PTHRP mRNAs. The transcriptional mechanism appears to preferentially involve the activity of a short downstream promoter of the gene, which is presumed to be regulated by a labile repressor protein. Our findings indicate that both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms may be important control points in the regulation of PTHRP expression in normal and malignant cells."
https://openalex.org/W1525907101,"Circular dichroism (CD) studies of parathyroid hormone (PTH), its oxidized forms, and some fragments of the hormone are described. The CD spectrum of native PTH (84 amino acids) and the active fragment, 1-34 PTH, suggests that most of the secondary structure resides in the amino-terminal segment of this hormone. Oxidation of the methionine residue at position 18 has a small impact on secondary structure, whereas oxidation of the methionine at position 8 produces substantial changes. Oxidation of both methionines produces secondary structure changes that are greater than the sum of those seen upon oxidation of the individual methionines. The CD spectrum for the 3-34 fragment of PTH is identical to that of the 1-34 fragment, and that of the 7-34 fragment is only slightly different. The spectra of the 13-34 and 19-34 fragments are markedly altered from that of the 1-34 peptide, and those of the 9-84 and 19-84 fragments of native PTH are significantly different from the intact hormone. Computer-assisted estimates of secondary structure content, and difference spectra, were utilized to evaluate the secondary structure content of the peptides. These results suggest that residues 6-12 are important in formation of helical secondary structure and that a reverse turn may be important for the folding of PTH into a conformation with high affinity for receptors. Residues 1 and 2 appear to make no contribution to the secondary structure and may be directly involved in activation of receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1601112148,"The precursor for transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) is a membrane glycoprotein that can establish contact with epidermal growth factor/TGF-alpha receptors on adjacent cells or can be cleaved to release TGF-alpha that diffuses into the medium. Cleavage of pro-TGF-alpha occurs at Ala/Leu-Ala/Leu-Ala-Val-Val sites located at each end of the mature TGF-alpha sequence. To characterize the cleavage process of pro-TGF-alpha and the role of glycosylation in this process, we have introduced a pro-TGF-alpha expression vector in wild type Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and in the mutant CHO cell clone ldlD that has a reversible defect in protein glycosylation. Analysis of metabolically labeled and cell surface-labeled products immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against the extracellular TGF-alpha sequence and the cytoplasmic pro-TGF-alpha C-terminal domain shows that cleavage of pro-TGF-alpha in wild type CHO cells occurs in two steps. Both processing steps occur after pro-TGF-alpha reaches the cell surface. In the first step, pro-TGF-alpha rapidly (t1/2 = 30 min) loses the amino-terminal segment that precedes the TGF-alpha sequence. In the second step, pro-TGF-alpha is cleaved at the carboxyl terminus of the TGF-alpha sequence releasing this factor into the medium. This second step is slow (t1/2 = 2 h). The action of pancreatic elastase added to CHO-TGF-alpha cells mimics the first step but not the second one. Synthesis, cell surface exposure, rate of cleavage, and generation of bioactive TGF-alpha in ldlD-TGF-alpha cells are not markedly affected by the lack of N-acetylgalactosamine-dependent protein O-glycosylation or galactose-dependent glycan chain modification. The results indicate that, despite their similarity in amino acid sequence, the two cleavage sites that flank TGF-alpha may be processed with different kinetics which can lead to retention of pro-TGF-alpha on the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1568909088,"Extrathyroidal production of 3,3',5-triiodothyronine from the thyroid secretory product, thyroxine, is catalyzed by tissue-specific iodothyronine 5'-deiodinases. Type I 5'-deiodinase (5'D-I) produces greater than 75% of the T3 found in the circulation and in thyroid hormone-responsive tissues and is most abundant in rat liver and kidney. In this study, we used the bromoacetyl derivatives of T4 (N-bromoacetyl-[125I]L-thyroxine, BrAcT4) and T3 (N-bromoacetyl-[125I]3,3',5-triiodothyronine, BrAcT3) as alkylating affinity labels to identify 5'D-I-related protein(s). BrAcT4 and BrAcT3 rapidly and irreversibly inactivated 5'D-I activity in liver and kidney microsomes. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of affinity labeled 5'D-I preparations showed that approximately 80% of the affinity label was incorporated into a protein with a Mr of 27,000 (p27). 5'D-I substrates and inhibitors specifically blocked affinity labeling of p27 with a rank order of potency (BrAcT4 greater than BrAcT3 greater than 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (rT3) approximately flavone EMD 21388 greater than iodoacetate greater than N-acetyl-T4 (NAcT4) greater than N-acetyl-T3 (NAcT3] identical to that determined for inhibition of 5'-deiodination. Hyper- and hypothyroidism-induced increases and decreases in 5'D-I activity, respectively, were matched by comparable changes in the quantity of affinity labeled p27. BrAcT3 was a less effective affinity label for p27 and minor labeling of a new band with 53 kDa was observed. Molecular sieve chromatography of detergent-solubilized 5'D-I showed coincident peaks of p27 and 5'-deiodinating activity with an apparent Mr approximately 51,000. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that p27 was a single polypeptide with a pI of 6.1. Approximately 2-5 pmol of p27 were present per mg of liver microsomal protein, equal to previous estimates for 5'D-I content. Our results suggest that p27 represents the substrate binding subunit of type I 5'-deiodinase, the enzyme catalyzing the key reaction in the activation of T4 to the thyromimetically active T3."
https://openalex.org/W1482783228,"Cytosols contain a heat-stable, chelatable, anionic, molybdate-like factor that stabilizes glucocorticoid receptors in a heteromeric complex with hsp90 (refers to the 90-kDa heat shock protein) and inhibits their transformation to the DNA-binding state (Meshinchi, S., Grippo, J.F., Sanchez, E.R., Bresnick, E.H., and Pratt, W.B. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 16809-16817). In this work, we demonstrate that removal of this factor by passage of L cell cytosol through the metal-chelating resin Chelex-100 makes the glucocorticoid receptor unstable, thus markedly facilitating both its dissociation from hsp90 and its transformation to the DNA-binding state. In normal cytosol, both temperature-mediated dissociation of hsp90 and temperature-mediated receptor transformation are hormone-dependent events. In the Chelex-treated, metal-depleted cytosol, however, temperature-mediated dissociation of hsp90 and receptor transformation occur very rapidly in a manner that is no longer hormone-dependent. When boiled L cell cytosol is added to the metal-depleted receptor system, the hormone dependence of both temperature-mediated dissociation of receptor from hsp90 and receptor transformation to the DNA-binding state is reconstituted. Like boiled cytosol, molybdate stabilizes the receptor complex and inhibits its transformation in metal-depleted cytosol, but it does not reconstitute the hormone dependence of the system. These results support the proposal that an endogenous metal anion interacts with the glucocorticoid receptor to stabilize it in the heteromeric, inactive, non-DNA-binding state in cytosol and that binding of the hormone promotes conversion of the receptor to the DNA-binding state through an effect on this metal anion center."
https://openalex.org/W2159782795,"Metallothioneins constitute a multigene family in the yeast Candida glabrata. Two genes, designated metallothionein-I (MT-I) and one member of the metallothionein-II family (MT-II), were cloned and sequenced previously (Mehra, R. K., Garey, J. R., Butt, T. R., Gray, W. R., and Winge, D. R. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 19747-19753). Southern analysis of the genomic DNA samples from different wild-type isolates indicated that the MT-I gene was always present as a single copy but multiple (3-9) and tandemly arranged copies of one MT-II gene were present in different strains. Strains of C. glabrata highly resistant to copper salts were obtained by repeated culturing of wild-type isolates in medium containing increasing concentrations of copper sulfate. These strains showed further stable chromosomal amplification (greater than 30 copies) of the MT-II gene. The MT-I gene remained as a single copy. Amplified copies of the MT-II gene were always arranged tandemly. One of the copper-resistant strains acquired more copies of the MT-II gene by apparent duplication of the chromosome carrying this gene. The size of the amplification unit was 1.25 kilobases. The principal MT-I and -II genes of C. glabrata were shown to map to different chromosomes by electrophoretic karyotypic analysis. The length of chromosome carrying MT-II gene increased appreciably in strains exhibiting the highest amplification of this gene. Northern analysis showed increased basal levels of MT-II mRNA in strains having highly amplified MT-II locus."
https://openalex.org/W1534151756,"Cytochrome P-450cam, a monoxygenase responsible for the regiospecific hydroxylation of camphor, binds its substrate through complimentary van der Waals contacts and the formation of a single hydrogen bond between tyrosine 96 and the ketone group of camphor. Substrate association is positively regulated through the binding of a monovalent cation and the oxidation-reduction potential modulated by the spin state of the ferric heme controlled by water access to the sixth coordination site of the iron. Removal of this single hydrogen bond via site-directed mutagenesis of tyrosine 96 to phenylalanine 96 defines this aspect of the protein structure as responsible for the linkage between cation and substrate cooperativities, the degree of spin state conversion resulting from water access via macromolecule and substrate dynamics, and suggests a specific location for the cation binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1493193887,"We investigated the interaction of the human plasma proteinase inhibitor heparin cofactor II (HC) with human neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G in order to examine 1) proteinase inhibition by HC, 2) inactivation of HC, and 3) the effect of glycosaminoglycans on inhibition and inactivation. We found that HC inhibited cathepsin G, but not elastase, with a rate constant of 6.0 x 10(6) M-1 min-1. Inhibition was stable, with a dissociation rate constant of 1.0 x 10(-3) min-1. Heparin and dermatan sulfate diminished inhibition slightly. Both neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G at catalytic concentrations destroyed the thrombin inhibition activity of HC. Inactivation was accompanied by a dramatic increase in heat stability, as occurs with other serine proteinase inhibitors. Proteolysis of HC (Mr 66,000) produced a species (Mr 58,000) that retained thrombin inhibition activity, and an inactive species of Mr 48,000. Amino acid sequence analysis led to the conclusion that both neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G cleave HC at Ile66, which does not affect HC activity, and at Val439, near the reactive site Leu444, which inactivates HC. Since cathepsin G is inhibited by HC and also inactivates HC, we conclude that cathepsin G participates in both reactions simultaneously so that small amounts of cathepsin G can inactivate a molar excess of HC. High concentrations of heparin and dermatan sulfate accelerated inactivation of HC by neutrophil proteinases, with heparin having a greater effect. Heparin and dermatan sulfate appeared to alter the pattern, and not just the rate, of proteolysis of HC. We conclude that while HC is an effective inhibitor of cathepsin G, it can be proteolyzed by neutrophil proteinases to generate first an active inhibitor and then an inactive molecule. This two-step mechanism might be important in the generation of chemotactic activity from the amino-terminal region of HC."
https://openalex.org/W1585503267,Rabbit liver cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase exists in several subforms which have different isoelectric points. Incubation of the purified enzyme with chymotrypsin cleaves the enzyme at Trp14. The released amino-terminal 14-mer peptide was shown to exist in three forms of equal concentration. The peptides differ in structure only at the asparaginyl residue at position 5. In addition to asparagine at this position we found both aspartyl and isoaspartyl residues. The deamidation of Asn5 does not appear to occur during the purification of the enzyme. The in vitro rate of deamidation of Asn5 in the enzyme is more than 5-fold slower than the rate of deamidation of this residue in the free 14-mer peptide. The isoaspartyl residue at position 5 serves as a substrate for protein carboxyl methyltransferase both in the free 14-mer peptide and the native enzyme. The enzyme which has had the amino-terminal 14 residues removed by digestion with chymotrypsin still exists in several forms with different isoelectric points. Reaction of peptides from this enzyme with carboxyl methyltransferase suggests that there is at least one more asparaginyl residue in this enzyme other than Asn5 which has undergone deamidation with the formation of isoaspartyl bonds.
https://openalex.org/W1519480067,"The expression of the hepatocyte Na(+)-dependent bile acid transport protein during liver development and in hepatoma cells has been characterized using a monoclonal antibody (mAb 25D-1) which specifically recognizes this 49-kDa carrier system. mAb binding studies demonstrated a greatly reduced concentration of this transport protein on the surface of hepatoma tissue culture (HTC) cells, a result consistent with the greater than 95% reduction in bile acid transport capacity when compared with normal adult hepatocytes. Immunoprecipitation procedures with 25D-1 were utilized to quantitate the presence of this transport protein in HTC cells as well as in adult hepatocytes that had been labeled with [35S]methionine or Na125I. These studies indicate that the 49-kDa transport protein is not expressed either on the surface or in any intracellular compartment in HTC cells. mAb binding to fetal cells (day 17) also indicated a greatly decreased number of transport molecules in the plasma membrane. Total cell content of this carrier protein during the next 7 weeks of liver development, as measured by immunoprecipitation, increased in a linear fashion reaching 92% of the adult level at 4 weeks after birth, which parallels the increase in transport function. These results demonstrate that bile acid transport capacity is directly related to the level of expression of this 49-kDa membrane protein."
https://openalex.org/W1498056836,"Recent studies showed that the enzyme rhodanese could be reversibly unfolded in guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) if aggregation and oxidation were minimized. Further, these equilibrium studies suggested the presence of intermediate(s) during refolding (Tandon, S., and Horowitz, P. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 9859-9866). The present work shows that native and refolded enzymes are very similar in structural and functional characteristics. Kinetics of denaturation/renaturation were used to detect the folding intermediate(s). The shift in fluorescence wavelength maximum was used to monitor the structural changes during the process. First order plots of the structural changes during unfolding and refolding show nonlinear curves. The refolding occurs in at least two phases. The first phase is very fast (t1/2 much less than 30 s) and accounts for the partial regain in the structure but not in the activity. The second phase is slow (t1/2 = 2.9 h) during which the enzyme fully regains its structure along with the activity. The fractional renaturation of rhodanese due to the fast phase, monitored in various concentrations of GdmCl, describes a transition centered at 3.5 M GdmCl which is very similar to the higher of the two transitions observed in the reversible refolding. All of these findings support the presence of detectable intermediate(s) during folding of rhodanese."
https://openalex.org/W1599637568,"Bacterial expression of eukaryotic proteins is a tool of ever-increasing importance in biochemistry and molecular biology. However, the majority of the recombinant eukaryotic proteins that have been expressed in bacteria are produced as fusion proteins and not in their native conformation. In particular, correct formation of quaternary structures by recombinant proteins in bacterial hosts has been reported very rarely. To our knowledge, correct intracellular formation of multimeric structures containing more than one interchain disulfide bridge has not been reported so far. We have constructed three plasmids which are able to direct expression of recombinant rabbit uteroglobin, a homodimeric protein with two interchain disulfide bridges, in Escherichia coli. Among these, the plasmid pLE103-1, in which the expression of recombinant uteroglobin is controlled by a bacteriophage T7 late promoter, is by far the most efficient. With pLE103-1, recombinant uteroglobin production reached about 10% of total bacterial soluble proteins. This protein accumulated in bacterial cells in dimeric form, as it is naturally found in the rabbit uterus. Recombinant uteroglobin was purified to near-homogeneity and its NH2-terminal amino acid sequence was confirmed to be identical to that of its natural counterpart, except for 2 Ala residues the codons for which were added during the plasmid construction. This protein was found to be as active a phospholipase A2 inhibitor as natural uteroglobin on a molar basis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of high level bacterial expression of a full length eukaryotic homodimeric protein with two interchain disulfide bridges in its natural, biologically active form. The plasmid pLE103-1 may be useful to explore structure-function relationships of rabbit uteroglobin. In addition, this plasmid may be useful in obtaining high level bacterial expression of other eukaryotic proteins with quaternary structure, as well as for other general applications requiring efficient bacterial expression of cDNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2139458626,"The effect of ADP-ribosylation on the function of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (EF-2) was investigated by kinetic analysis of the EF-2-catalyzed hydrolysis of GTP in the presence of ribosomes and by direct determination of the affinity of the modified factor for the ribosome. Under conditions where the concentration of EF-2 was rate-limiting, the ADP-ribosylation reduced the maximum rate of GTP hydrolysis and the second order rate constant Kcat/Km by approximately 50%. A similar decrease in Kcat and Kcat/Km was observed when the concentration of ribosomes were kept rate-limiting. The affinity of EF-2 for the pretranslocation type of ribosomes was reduced by 2 orders of magnitude after ADP-ribosylation. No effect was observed in the interaction with the post-translocation type of ribosomes, the ribosomal conformation responsible for activation of the EF-2-dependent GTPase. We conclude that the ADP-ribosylation affects both the association of the modified factor with pretranslocation ribosomes and the hydrolytic capacity of the factor."
https://openalex.org/W1648792039,"The CO-binding kinetics and the optical spectra of the NO derivative of the homodimeric hemoglobin from Scapharca inaequivalvis have been investigated over the range between pH 7.0 and 2.0. In the deoxygenated derivative, protonation of the proximal imidazole at very low pH values and the consequent cleavage of the Fe-N epsilon bond result in a approximately 50-fold enhancement of the rate constant for CO binding, as found in other hemoproteins. However, in the case of the hemoglobin from S. inaequivalvis, the pH profile displays a cooperative behavior (n = 1.8 +/- 0.1), a unique feature that differentiates this protein from any other hemoprotein investigated thus far. Cleavage of the proximal bond in the NO derivative of S. inaequivalvis hemoglobin likewise displays a very steep pH transition. The mode of assembly of the homodimer, in which the heme-carrying E and F helices provide the subunit interface and bring the hemes at a much shorter distance (18.4 A) than in vertebrate hemoglobins, is likely to provide the structural basis for this unique behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1572397475,"We recently reported that prostaglandin (PG) E2 stimulated phosphoinositide metabolism in cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells and that PGE2 and ouabain induced a gradual secretion of catecholamines from the cells (Yokohama, H., Tanaka, T., Ito, S., Negishi, M., Hayashi, H., and Hayaishi, O. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 1119-1122). Here we examined the involvement of two signal pathways, Ca2+ mobilization and protein kinase C activation resulting from phosphoinositide metabolism, in the PGE2-induced catecholamine release. Either the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) could enhance the release in the presence of ouabain, and ionomycin-induced release was additive to PGE2-induced release, but TPA-induced release was not additive. PGE2 dose-dependently stimulated the formation of diacylglycerol and caused the translocation of 4% of the total protein kinase C activity to become membrane-bound within 5 min. These effects were specific for PGE2 and PGE1 among PGs tested (PGE2 = PGE1 greater than PGF2 alpha greater than PGD2). Furthermore, the phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C inhibitor neomycin inhibited PGE2-induced accumulation of inositol phosphates, diacylglycerol formation, translocation of protein kinase C, and also stimulation of catecholamine release. Both PGE2- and TPA-induced release were inhibited by the depletion of protein kinase C caused by prolonged exposure to TPA, but ionomycin-induced release was not inhibited. We recently found that the amiloride-sensitive Na+, H+-antiport participates in PGE2-evoked catecholamine release (Tanaka, T., Yokohama, H., Negishi, M., Hayashi, H., Ito, S., and Hayaishi, O. (1990) J. Neurochem. 54, 86-95). In agreement with our recent report, PGE2 and TPA induced a sustained increase in intracellular pH that was abolished by the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine but not by the calmodulin inhibitor W-7. Ionomycin also induced a marked increase in intracellular pH, but this increase was abolished by W-7 but not by staurosporine. These results demonstrate that PGE2-induced activation of the Na+, H(+)-antiport and catecholamine release in the presence of ouabain are mediated by activation of protein kinase C, rather than by Ca2+ mobilization, resulting from phosphoinositide metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1493451313,"CON8 is a single-cell derived subclone of the 13762NF transplantable, hormone-responsive rat mammary tumor that proliferates rapidly in serum-free medium. Addition of either glucocorticoids or calf serum alone caused a slight stimulation of CON8 proliferation. However, glucocorticoids required the presence of specific serum proteins to strongly suppress CON8 cell growth. Furthermore, the anchorage-independent growth of CON8 cells was significantly reduced in the presence of glucocorticoids and serum. We have designated this serum activity GMGSF, for glucocorticoid modulating growth suppression factor. Inhibition of cell growth was limited to steroids with strong glucocorticoid biological activity, while exposure to the glucocorticoid antagonist RU38486 prevented this response. Half-maximal growth inhibition and half-maximal expression of a glucocorticoid-inducible gene product (2 nM) occurred slightly below the half-maximal receptor binding of [3H]dexamethasone (10nM). We have also selected a variant mammary epithelial tumor cell line, derived from CON8, denoted 8RUV7, whose proliferation and soft agar colony formation failed to be suppressed by glucocorticoids in the presence of serum. These glucocorticoid-resistant variant cells possess functional glucocorticoid receptors, competently produce the glucocorticoid-responsive gene product plasminogen activator inhibitor, and along with CON8 cells express milk fat globule protein antigens on their cell surface, indicative of their mammary epithelial cell character. We are using this variant line to genetically dissect the molecular mechanism of the glucocorticoid/GMGSF growth suppression pathway in mammary epithelial tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1897366877,"In order to elucidate the photophysical mechanisms of cellular phototoxicity sensitized by doxycycline, MGH-U1 human bladder carcinoma cells in vitro were treated with 20.7 microM doxycycline and irradiated with either a pulsed (lambda = 355 nm, pulse duration = 24 ps) or a continuous wave (lambda = 351 nm) laser. Cumulative radiant exposure and irradiance were systematically varied in experiments with both lasers. Phototoxicity was assessed by epifluorescence microscopy of unfixed cells using rhodamine 123 labeling of mitochondria. With the continuous wave source, the cumulative radiant exposure required for induction of phototoxic injury was independent of irradiance. With the 24-ps-pulsed source, a significantly lower cumulative radiant exposure was required to induce the phototoxicity when the peak irradiance was 5.8 x 10(7) or 1.3 x 10(8) watts cm-2 compared with when peak irradiance was either lower (6.0 x 10(6) watts cm-2) or higher (7.6 x 10(8) watts cm-2). The measured fluorescence lifetimes of doxycycline in buffered saline solution were longer than the laser pulse duration of 24 ps. The increased efficiency of photosensitization at the optimal peak irradiance in the ps domain appears to result from sequential multiphoton absorption involving higher excited states of the singlet manifold. At the highest irradiance studied, on the other hand, reduced efficiency of photosensitization is attributed to increased photodegradation of doxycycline from higher excited states by processes such as photoionization. A model consistent with these observations is presented along with calculations, based on simple rate equations, that fit the essentials of the proposed model."
https://openalex.org/W1513994146,"The effects of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) on the transfer of cholesterol esters mediated by lipid transfer protein (LTP) and its affinity for lipid and lipoprotein particles were investigated. When the single bilayer vesicle preparations (containing phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, cholesteryl ester, and apolipoprotein- (apo) A-I at the molar ratio of 90:30:1.2:0.18) or high density lipoprotein 3 (HDL3) were used as the cholesteryl ester donor and low density lipoproteins (LDL) as the acceptor, the transfer activity of LTP was enhanced by the addition of low concentrations of LCAT. In contrast, no enhancement of cholesteryl ester transfer was observed upon addition of LCAT to either the discoidal bilayer particle preparations (containing phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, cholesteryl ester, and apo-A-I at the molar ratio of 90:30:1.2:1.0) or high density lipoprotein 2 (HDL2). Although both apo-A-I and apo-A-II promoted the transfer of cholesteryl ester from vesicles to LDL, the additional enhancement of the transfer by LCAT was observed only with the vesicles containing apo-A-I. Gel permeation chromatography of LTP/vesicle and LTP/HDL3 mixtures in the presence and absence of LCAT showed that the affinity of LTP for both the vesicles and HDL3 increased upon addition of LCAT. In contrast, neither HDL2 nor discoidal bilayer particles showed any significant enhancement of LTP binding upon addition of LCAT. By using LCAT covalently bound to Sepharose 4B, a maximal interaction between LTP and bound LCAT was shown to occur at the ionic strength of 0.16. Deviation from this ionic strength reduced the extent of the interaction. At the ionic strength of 0.01 and 0.5, the elution volume of LTP was identical to that of bovine serum albumin."
https://openalex.org/W1546295466,"The oxidative half-reactions of anthranilate hydroxylase (EC 1.14.12.2) were examined in the presence of anthranilate and modified substrates. C(4a)-Hydroperoxyflavin (C(4a)-FlOOH) and C(4a)-hydroxyflavin (C(4a)-FlOH) intermediates were detected in oxidative reactions with all substrates. Thus, the oxygenation reactions of the enzyme are similar to those of flavoprotein hydroxylases that convert phenolic compounds to catechols. These observations support a mechanism proposed for this enzyme (Powlowski, J. B., Dagley, S., Massey, V., and Ballou, D. P. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 69-74) involving nucleophilic attack of the substrate on C(4a)-FlOOH, and formation of an imine intermediate that is subsequently hydrolyzed. Anthranilate hydroxylase is therefore a typical flavoprotein hydroxylase with the added capacity of hydrolyzing imine intermediates. Fluorine substituents on the aromatic ring decreased the rate of conversion of C(4a)-FlOOH to C(4a)-FlOH, as predicted by this mechanism. Hydroxylation of 3-fluoro- and 3-methylanthranilates resulted in the formation of nonaromatic products that appeared to stabilize the C(4a)-FlOH. No evidence was found for a high extinction intermediate (intermediate II) (Entsch, B., Ballou, D. P., and Massey, V. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 2550-2563) under conditions where it was readily detected with other flavoprotein hydroxylases. It was shown that the spectra of the nonaromatic products (which are quinonoid forms) could not be summed with the spectra of C(4a)-hydroxyflavin to obtain that of a putative intermediate II, thus ruling out that explanation for previous observations of II."
https://openalex.org/W1497843695,"The transparency of the mammalian lens is primarily maintained by short range order among the major proteins of the lens fiber cells, the crystallins. Although these proteins are highly conserved at the amino acid sequence level, it has proven difficult to establish that they possess other than structural functions. We find that when non-lens proteins are added to concentrated solutions of alpha-crystallin, aggregation is induced, presumably through excluded volume effects. In contrast, the monomeric gamma-crystallins and the low molecular weight form of beta-crystallin (beta L) cause a decrease in the size of alpha-crystallin. When the naturally aggregated form of alpha-crystallin is examined, gamma- and beta L-crystallin, as well as a reducing agent, also cause partial dissociation as detected by dynamic light scattering and size exclusion chromatography, while no effect is seen with non-crystallin proteins. Furthermore, the chemical cross-linking of alpha-crystallin is inhibited by gamma- and beta L-crystallin but not by other proteins. The ability of gamma-crystallin to inhibit the association of alpha-crystallin is primarily localized to the gamma-II form which contains a high degree of exposed thiols. Only small amounts of gamma- and beta L-crystallin, however, can be cross-linked to alpha-crystallin in mixtures of the three proteins even at very high protein concentrations. These results suggest that one possible role for the lower molecular weight crystallins may be to minimize through a reductive effect the intrinsic tendency of alpha-crystallin to aggregate, an association reaction implicated in the loss of lens transparency."

The concentrations of inhibitors in the culture medium required for 50% inhibition of growth were 0.32 microM for 24-thia-5 alpha,20 xi-cholestan-3 beta-ol (2), 0.009 microM for 24-methyl-24-aza-5 alpha,20 xi-cholestan-3 beta-ol (3), 0.95 microM for (20,21),(24,-25)-bis-(methylene)-5 alpha,20 xi-cholestan-3 beta-ol (4), 0.13 microM for 22-aza-5 alpha,20 xi-cholestan-3 beta-ol (5), and 0.3 microM for 23-azacholestan-3-ol (7). 23-Thia-5 alpha-cholestan-3 beta-ol (6) had no effect on protozoan growth at concentrations as high as 20 microM. Ergosterol was the major sterol observed in untreated C. fasciculata, but significant amounts of ergost-7-en-3 beta-ol, ergosta-7,24(28)-dien-3 beta-ol, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-e beta-ol, cholesta-8,24-dien-3 beta-ol, and, in an unusual finding, 14 alpha-methyl-cholesta-8,24-dien-3 beta-ol were also present. When C. fasciculata was cultured in the presence of compounds 2 and 3, ergosterol synthesis was suppressed, and the principal sterol observed was cholesta-5,7,24-trien-3 beta-ol, a sterol which is not observed in untreated cultures. The presence of this trienol strongly suggests that 2 and 3 specifically inhibit the S-adenosylmethionine:sterol C-24 methyltransferase but do not interfere with the normal enzymatic processing of the sterol nucleus. When C. fasciculata was cultured in the presence of compounds 5 and 7, the levels of ergosterol and ergost-7-en-3 beta-ol were suppressed, but the amounts of the presumed immediate precursors of these sterols, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3 beta-ol and ergosta-7,24-(28)-dien-3 beta-ol, respectively, were correspondingly increased. These findings suggest that 5 and 7 specifically inhibit the reduction of the delta 24(28) side chain double bond. When C. fasciculata was cultured in the presence of compound 4, ergosterol synthesis was suppressed, but the sterol distribution in these cells was complex and not easily interpreted. Compound 6 had no significant effect on sterol synthesis in C. fasciculata."
https://openalex.org/W881255368,"Dexamethasone has a potentiating effect on phenobarbitone mediated induction of cytochrome P-450b + e mRNAs in adult rat liver. However, the glucocorticoid inhibits phenobarbitone-activated transcription of cytochrome P-450b + e mRNAs by 60-70%. This inhibitory effect is evident in run-off transcription of the endogenous genes as well as in the transcription of an added cloned gene fragment. Dexamethasone inhibits the phenobarbitone-mediated increase in the binding of a transcription factor(s) to the upstream region of the gene as evidenced by gel retardation and Southwestern blot analysis. The glucocorticoid does not stabilize the phenobarbitone-induced polyribosomal cytochrome P-450b + e mRNAs but appears to stabilize the nuclear transcripts. It is proposed that a negative element may mediate the action of dexamethasone at the level of nuclear transcription and stabilization of the nuclear transcript may account for the potentiating effect of the glucocorticoid on phenobarbitone-mediated increase in cytochrome P-450b + e mRNAs in the cytoplasm of the adult rat liver. However, the cytochrome P-450b protein levels are slightly lower in phenobarbitone + dexamethasone treatment than in phenobarbitone-treated liver microsomes."
https://openalex.org/W1587739820,"Medium-chain S-acyl fatty acid synthase thioester hydrolase (thioesterase II), a discrete 263-residue serine active-site enzyme, modifies the product specificity of the de novo lipogenic pathway in certain specialized tissues by hydrolyzing the thioester bond linking the growing acyl chain to the 4'-phosphopantetheine of the fatty acid synthase. Modification of one thioesterase II cysteine thiol with thionitrobenzoate inhibited interaction with the S-acyl-fatty acid synthase substrate but not with acyl-CoA model substrates. The identity of the sensitive cysteine residue was determined by treatment of the thionitrobenzoyl enzyme with cyanide and cleavage at the amino-terminal side of the S-cyanocysteinyl residue. Two small cleavage products were isolated; their molecular masses (889 and 675 Da) and amino acid compositions indicated that both originated from cleavage at Cys256. A new technique of electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was utilized to confirm that the heterogeneity displayed by the products of S-cyanocysteinyl cleavage resulted from the presence, in the purified preparations, of both full-length and a truncated form of the enzyme missing the carboxyl-terminal Leu-Thr peptide. The proportion of full-length polypeptide present appeared to correlate with the activity of the enzyme toward its natural substrate. The results of modification of Cys256 by thionitrobenzoate and removal of residues 262 and 263 by endogenous proteases indicate that integrity of the carboxyl-terminal region is important for interaction with its acyl-fatty acid synthase substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1589126557,"The prolactin (PRL) gene in clonal strains of rat pituitary tumor cells in culture (GH cells) exhibit several regulatory responses, similar to the ones observed in rat pituitary gland. A comparative analysis of regulation of PRL gene expression in PRL-producing (PRL+) and PRL-nonproducing (PRL-) GH cells was conducted by monitoring the PRL promoter driven transient expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene in GH4C1 (PRL+) and GH12C1 (PRL-) cells. The PRL promoter activity was drastically inhibited only in PRL-nonproducing cells (PRL-) and not in PRL producing cells (PRL+) when a 80-base pair (bp) DNA sequence from 5'-flanking region of PRL gene (located between -330 and -250 bp) was included in the PRL-CAT fusion gene constructs. Furthermore, a DNA/protein interaction involving this 80-bp DNA sequence and a 60-kDa nuclear protein was detected only in PRL- cells but not in PRL+ GH cells. These results suggested that the strain-specific suppression of PRL gene in PRL-, GH12C1 cells was mediated via interaction of a cis-acting negative regulatory element with a negative regulatory trans-acting factor in these cells. The negative regulatory element within the AT-rich 80-bp DNA sequence was mapped immediately adjacent to the site of interaction of trans-activators of PRL gene."
https://openalex.org/W1598847530,"The cause of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Type VII (EDS VII) is considered to be defective removal of the amino-terminal propeptide (N-propeptide) of Type I procollagen due to deficiency of procollagen N-proteinase, the enzyme responsible for the normal proteolytic excision of this precursor-specific domain. Molecules retaining the N-propeptide (pN-collagen molecules) are thought to cause defective fibrillogenesis and cross-linking which eventuate in dramatic joint laxity and joint dislocations, the clinical hallmark of this variety of EDS. Recent studies demonstrate that some EDS VII patients harbor small deletions of either the pro-alpha 1(I) or pro-alpha 2(I) chain of Type I procollagen. We have found an 18-amino acid deletion (due to exon outsplicing) in a mutant pro-alpha 2(I) chain from such a patient. The deleted peptide is the junctional segment (N-telopeptide) linking the alpha 2(I) N-propeptide and major triple helical domains; loss of this short segment results in union of these latter domains and produces a shortened pN alpha 2(I) chain. Directly extracted tissue collagen and pepsin-digested fibroblast collagen contain this mutant pN alpha 2(I) chain and normal alpha 1(I) chains, but not pN alpha 1(I) chains, indicating that the relatively larger alpha 1(I) N-propeptide is excised from the related alpha 1(I) chains. The fate of this alpha 1(I) N-propeptide was unclear and therefore whether or not the intact N-propeptide was, in fact, retained in native mutant collagen was also unclear. In this paper, we describe morphologic, chemical, and immunochemical studies which indicate that the alpha 1(I) N-propeptide is retained in noncovalent association with the mutant pN alpha 2(I) chain in native mutant collagen molecules both in vivo and in vitro. In both instances, the alpha 1(I) N-propeptides are proteolytically cleaved from the related alpha 1(I) chains. These data suggest that retention of a partially cleaved, but essentially intact N-propeptide in mutant collagen may play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W1675231742,"The technique of photoaffinity labeling has been applied to the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent enzyme 2',5'-oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetase to provide a means for the examination of RNA-protein interaction(s) in the dsRNA allosteric binding domain of this enzyme. The synthesis, characterization, and biological properties of the photoaffinity probe poly[( 32P]I,8-azidoI).poly(C) and its mismatched analog poly[( 32P]I,8-azidoI).poly(C12U), which mimic the parent molecules poly(I).poly(C) and poly(I).poly(C12U), are described. The efficacy of poly[( 32P]I,8-azidoI).poly(C) and poly[( 32P]I,8-azidoI).poly(C12U) as allosteric site-directed activators is demonstrated using highly purified 2-5A synthetase from rabbit reticulocyte lysates and from extracts of interferon-treated HeLa cells. The dsRNA photoprobes activate these two 2-5A synthetases. Saturation of 2-5A synthetase is observed at 6 x 10(-4) g/ml poly[( 32P]I,8-azidoI).poly(C) following photolysis for 20 s at 0 degrees C. The photoincorporation of poly[( 32P]I,8-azidoI).poly(C) is specific, as demonstrated by the prevention of photoincorporation by native poly(I).poly(C). DNA, poly(I), and poly(C) are not competitors of poly[( 32P]I,8-azidoI).poly(C). Following UV irradiation of 2-5A synthetase with poly[( 32P]I,8-azidoI).poly(C), the reaction mixture is treated with micrococcal nuclease to hydrolyze azido dsRNA that is not cross-linked to the enzyme. A radioactive band of 110 kDa (the same as that reported for native rabbit reticulocyte lysate 2-5A synthetase) is observed following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The specific photolabeling of the 2-5A synthetase suggests that the azido dsRNA is intrinsic to the allosteric binding domain. The utility of poly[( 32P]I,8-azidoI).poly(C) for the detection of dsRNA-dependent binding proteins and the isolation of peptides at or near the allosteric binding site is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1890415133,"The adenovirus single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein (DBP) is necessary for the elongation step in viral DNA replication. In an attempt to characterize the putative ssDNA-binding domain of the DBP, we purified and characterized the Ad2ts111A DBP, which contains a glycine-to-valine substitution at amino acid 280. This mutation is adjacent to that in the previously studied Ad2+ND1ts23. Ad2+ND1ts23 exhibits a temperature-sensitive defect in DNA replication, and its DBP has previously been shown to bind ssDNA with reduced affinity. Ad2ts111A DBP, like Ad2+ND1ts23, does not support adenovirus DNA replication in vitro at elevated temperatures. However, the Ad2ts111A DBP binds ssDNA more tightly than does Ad2+ND1ts23 and is not temperature sensitive in this function. To determine the nucleic acid-binding properties of DBP, we applied spectrofluorometric techniques, which had not been used previously to study adenovirus DBP. Using the homopolynucleotide poly(1,N6)-ethenoadenylic acid (poly(r epsilon A], we have determined that the binding site size is approximately 16 nucleotides. In 20 mM NaCl, the Ad2wt, Ad2ts111A, and Ad2+ND1ts23 DBP proteins all bound stoichiometrically to poly(r epsilon A) with overall apparent affinities above 108 M-1. Based on titrations carried out at higher salt concentrations, however, the stability of these complexes did appear to increase in the order Ad2+ND1ts23 less than Ad2ts111A less than Ad2wt. By these techniques, we have confirmed also that the DBP of another temperature-sensitive mutant, H5ts107, like the Ad2ts111A DBP, retains its ability to bind ssDNA even at a restrictive temperature utilizing the salt concentration compatible with adenovirus DNA replication in vitro. The H5ts107 DBP, which contains an amino acid substitution at position 413, is defective for in vitro replication at nonpermissive temperature but is not temperature sensitive for binding to ssDNA. In summary, our results indicate that the replication defects of the Ad2ts111A are similar to those of H5ts107 and cannot be attributed to defective, nonspecific ssDNA binding by the DBP. It appears that ssDNA binding by itself is not sufficient to account for the role of DBP in adenovirus DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1599658440,"The protein 114/A10 is expressed in structurally heterogeneous forms on the surfaces of all murine hemopoietic cells that are responsive to the growth factor interleukin-3, including multipotent progenitors. Despite their structural diversity, all forms of 114/A10 appear to be expressed from a single gene that encodes a peptide with a potential transmembrane segment, three sequences with homology to epidermal growth factor, and an N-terminal domain consisting of eight perfect or near perfect tandem repeats of a 27-amino acid peptide that has a very high content of serine and threonine. Constructed cDNAs that encode deleted or hybrid forms of the 114/A10 protein have been expressed on COS cells in order to localize sites of post-translational modification. The results demonstrate that the structural diversity of 114/A10 is confined to its N-terminal repeat domain and probably arises through extensive O-linked glycosylation within each of the repeats in that domain. The highly modified N terminus of 114/A10 projects from the outer surface of the cell and could serve as a ligand for lectin-like proteins or could modulate the activities of the adjacent epidermal growth factor-like domains of 114/A10."
https://openalex.org/W1576170067,"A mechanism for beta-chlorophenethylamine inhibition of dopamine beta-monooxygenase has been postulated in which bound alpha-aminoacetophenone is generated followed by an intramolecular redox reaction to yield a ketone-derived radical cation as the inhibitory species (Mangold, J.B., and Klinman, J.P. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 7772-7779). Based on the assumption that the ketone radical is the inhibitory intermediate, an analogous system was predicted and verified (Bossard, M.J., and Klinman, J.P. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 16421-16427). In the present study, the role of alpha-aminoacetophenone as the proposed intermediate in the inactivation by beta-chlorophenethylamine was examined in greater detail. From the interdependence of tyramine and alpha-aminoacetophenone concentrations, ketone inactivation is concluded to occur at the substrate site as opposed to potential binding at the reductant-binding site. Using beta-[2-1H]- and beta-[2-2H]chlorophenethylamine, the magnitude of the deuterium isotope effect on inactivation under second-order conditions has been found to be identical to that observed under catalytic turnover, D(kappa inact/Ki) = D(kappa cat/Km) = 6-7. By contrast, the isotope effect on inactivation under conditions of substrate and oxygen saturation, D kappa inact = 2, is 3-fold smaller than that seen on catalytic turnover, D kappa cat = 6. This reduced isotope effect for inactivation is attributed to a normal isotope effect on substrate hydroxylation followed by an inverse isotope effect on the partitioning of the enol of alpha-aminoacetophenone between oxidation to a radical cation versus protonation to regenerate ketone. These findings are unusual in that two isotopically sensitive steps are present in the inactivation pathway whereas only one is observable in turnover."
