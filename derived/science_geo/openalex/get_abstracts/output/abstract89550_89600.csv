https://openalex.org/W2067202413,"A human autoantibody from a schleroderma patient was found to immunostain interphase and mitotic centrosomes in a variety of vertebrate cells. Electron microscopic immunocytochemistry localized this antigen in dense pericentriolar material (PCM) surrounding the centrioles. The meiotic spindle of the mouse egg has no centriole but it exhibited a broad PCM band at each pole. This pattern was also found from the first through fourth mitotic divisions. During this time PCM was found assembled at a single locus in the cell and exclusively in mitotic cells; it was not observable in interphase cells. In the blastocyst, only polar trophoblast cells had characteristic centrosomes throughout the cell cycle. Results suggest PCM can exist, disperse, and reorganize during the cell cycle independently of the centriole, and its distribution in the embryo differs in cells having different fates."
https://openalex.org/W1516800253,"Abstract The plasma membranes of isolated guinea pig hepatocytes were made permeable with saponin. The cells were then suspended in a medium resembling cytosol in which the level of ATP was kept constant with an ATP-regenerating system. Intracellular ATP-dependent 45Ca and 40Ca sequestration was then followed at various concentrations of Ca2+ in the medium. It was found that ATP-dependent Ca uptake could be divided into two mechanisms: a low affinity high capacity uptake sensitive to 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) and oligomycin, thought to be mitochondrial, and a low capacity high affinity uptake, which was insensitive to DNP and oligomycin, thought to be mainly endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The threshold for ATP-dependent Ca uptake by the latter pool was about 20 nM Ca2+. The process had an EC50 value of 0.3 microM (for 45Ca) and a capacity of 2.7 nmol/45Ca/mg of protein. The mechanism also had a high affinity for ATP (EC50, about 43 microM). There was no significant accumulation of Ca by the postulated pool until the [Ca2+] of the medium was greater than 1 microM. The concentration of Ca2+ in the cytosol of normal unstimulated hepatocytes was estimated from measurements of phosphorylase a activity to be about 0.18 microM. At this [Ca2+], the ER pool of the saponin-treated hepatocytes accumulated Ca but there was no evidence of any Ca uptake into the mitochondrial pool. This suggests that most of the exchangeable Ca in a normal cell may be in DNP and oligomycin-insensitive pools (presumably the ER or possibly the plasma membrane) and suggests that these pools are likely to be involved in the increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] which occurs after stimulation by Ca-mobilizing hormones."
https://openalex.org/W1976269234,"The biochemical and functional characterization of the nerve growth cone is of major interest for studies on mechanisms involved in nervous system development. We describe the isolation from fetal brain of membrane-bound fragments of nerve growth cones by density gradient fractionation. These so-called growth cone particles are highly uniform and identifiable on the basis of their organelle complement. Furthermore, they co-purify in mixing experiments with fragments of radiolabeled and light microscopically identified nerve growth cones from primary cultures. The possibility of isolating growth cone fragments in quantity renders feasible the analysis of molecular mechanisms involved in growth cone function."
https://openalex.org/W2079346360,"The monoclonal antibody ECCD-1 inhibits Ca2+-dependent cell-cell adhesion in teratocarcinoma cells, recognizing a cell surface component of MW 124,000. When mouse embryos at various preimplantation stages were cultured in the presence of ECCD-1, the compacted morphology of the 8- to 16-cell-stage embryos was destroyed. In these embryos, cell proliferation normally occurred and development of blastocyst-like vesicles was attained. However, these embryos did not contain inner cell mass (ICM). We found that ECCD-1 affects the pattern of polarization of the cell surface in late 8- and 16-cell-stage blastomeres, as detected by staining with fluorescence-labeled concanavalin A. In normal blastomeres, the pole was always apart from the cell-cell contact plane. In those cultured in ECCD-1, formation of the pole tended to be inhibited, and if observed, the pole was close to the cell-cell contact plane. We discuss the possible mechanisms for inhibition of ICM formation caused by blocking Ca2+-dependent cell-cell adhesion between blastomeres."
https://openalex.org/W2104451293,"Two independent γδβ-thalassemias are each associated with large deletions. We show, by comparing DNA sequences, that the deletions are due to nonhomologous DNA exchanges. The 5′ breakpoints are located approximately the same distance apart and in the same order along the DNA as their 3′ breakpoints. Two independent cases of hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin, also involving large deletions, show the same unexpected relationship between their 5′ and 3′ breakpoints. This relationship is most simply explained if, within each pair, the deletions are of approximately the same length. The results suggest that the four deletions were generated by a common mechanism. Perhaps their 5′ and 3′ breakpoints are physically close in the nucleus, although far apart on the linear DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2075030432,"Dynorphin-A-(1-8), an opioid peptide widely distributed in the rat central nervous system, is present in vasopressin-containing neurosecretory cells terminating in the neural lobe of the pituitary. Electron microscopic immunocytochemistry reveals that dynorphin-A-(1-8) is contained within the same neurosecretory vesicles as vasopressin and vasopressin-associated neurophysin in the neural lobe of the rat. The results indicate that dynorphin may be released in the pituitary concomitantly with vasopressin during the antidiuretic response."
https://openalex.org/W2066799680,"Acetylcholine receptor-rich membranes from the electric organ of Torpedo californica are enriched in the four subunits (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and for polypeptides at 43 kd and 270 kd. Reaction of these membranes with 3H-N-ethylmaleimide (3H-NEM) demonstrates that most of the available free sulfhydryls reside on the 43 kd protein. Cross-linking reagents that contain NEM as one reactive group, and N-hydroxysuccinimide as the other, were used to study the topography of the 43 kd protein in AChR-rich membranes. Proteins from cross-linked membranes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and the composition of crosslinked products was determined by Western blots and monoclonal antibodies. A crosslinked product at 110 kd was labeled by a monoclonal antibody to the beta-subunit and by a monoclonal antibody to the 43 kd protein, but not by monoclonal antibodies to the alpha, gamma, or delta subunits. The 110 kd crosslink was not produced in the presence of 10 mM lithium diiodosalicylate, which dissociates the 43 kd protein from the membrane. Thus the 43 kd protein is intimately associated with the AChR and in close proximity to the beta-subunit."
https://openalex.org/W2071850617,"A method was developed for the high-resolution measurement of breaks in prematurely condensed chromosomes at the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The dose response for fragments (breaks) produced immediately after x-irradiation of confluent cultures of normal human cells was linear down to 10.9 rad (0.109 Gy) and extrapolated to zero effect at zero dose. The curve had a slope of 0.063 breaks per cell per rad, which is at least an order of magnitude greater than that for breaks scored in the same cells after they have progressed to mitosis following subculture. When incubated at 37 degrees C half of the breaks disappeared in 2 hours. A slower, perhaps nonrejoining component was apparent at later incubation times. The initial rate of break rejoining was similar to the rate of increase in survival after incubation because of the repair of potentially lethal damage and is also in close agreement with recently reported values for the rejoining of double-strand breakage in DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2070128645,"Xenopus laevis ribosomal gene plasmids bearing different length spacers were injected into oocyte nuclei in competition with each other. The spacer has two basic effects on transcription from the gene promoter. First, if the competing pair have unequal spacer lengths, the gene promoter attached to the longer spacer is always dominant in transcription (the competition effect). Second, as the total amount of spacer in the reaction increases, the total amount of transcription decreases (the sink effect). Both the competition and the sink effect are attributed to sequence elements that are 60 or 81 bp long, which are present in multiple copies in the spacer and are related in sequence to part of the gene promoter. The bp elements confer competitive dominance either orientation. A model which explains both the competition and the sink effects is discussed in which the bp elements are attraction sites for a factor(s) which is needed to activate the gene promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1569356536,The behaviors of oligosaccharides obtained by hydrazinolysis of asparagine-linked sugar chains in an erythroagglutinating phytohemagglutinin lectin-agarose column were examined to define the structural determinants required for the interaction of asparagine-linked sugars with erythroagglutinating phytohemagglutinin. The minimal structural unit required for erythroagglutinating phytohemagglutinin binding was (formula; see text) in which R1 and R2 represent either hydrogen or sugars and R3 represents either GlcNAc leads to Asn or (Fuc alpha 1 leads to 6)GlcNAcOT.
https://openalex.org/W2075647419,"With functional assays we selected a monoclonal antibody (anti-Arc-1) that perturbs specific cell-cell contacts of MDCK epithelial cells in tissue culture. The cells loosen their tight junctions, become uncoupled, and their polarity is abolished. Several findings show that the corresponding antigen appears to be a cell-surface protein of MDCK epithelial cells but not of other established cell lines: radioactively labeled antibody could be absorbed on the surface of intact cells; immunoscanning electron microscopy showed a homogeneous surface distribution of the antigen; and the antigen was extractable from the cells by EDTA. Absorption on Western blots and gel filtration showed antigenicity at 130 and 40 kd. This study shows that the hybridoma technique, in combination with functional screening of the monoclonal antibodies, allows the identification of new and specific molecules involved in cell-cell adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2038433336,"We have previously isolated cDNA clones homologous to mRNAs present at elevated levels in transformed mouse fibroblasts. Clones of Set 1 contain a dispersed repetitive element present thousands of times in the mouse genome. This repeat identifies in mouse embryos a large number of transcripts that are quantitatively regulated during development. At maximal expression these RNAs constitute between 1% and 3% of polyadenylated RNA. A pattern of Set 1-related transcripts very similar to that observed in midgestation embryos is found in pluripotential EC and EK cell lines, and the abundance of these RNAs decreases upon differentiation in vitro. However, the F9 line of EC cells, which has a more restricted developmental capacity, exhibits a much simpler pattern of transcripts containing the Set 1 repeat."
https://openalex.org/W2028980732,"The uninephrectomized rat given desoxycorticosterone (DOC) provides a classic model of ""sodium-dependent"" hypertension. In such rats, the extent to which a given dietary intake of sodium induced an increase in blood pressure depended on whether or not the anionic component of the sodium salt was chloride. With normal and high dietary intakes of sodium, sodium chloride induced increases in blood pressure much greater than that induced by approximately equimolar amounts of sodium bicarbonate, sodium ascorbate, or a combination of sodium bicarbonate and sodium ascorbate. A normal amount of dietary sodium chloride induced hypertension, whereas an equimolar amount of sodium bicarbonate did not increase blood pressure. This difference could not be attributed to differences in sodium or potassium balances, weight gain, or caloric intake. The DOC model of ""sodium-dependent"" hypertension might better be considered sodium chloride-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W1965887510,"The Mnt repressor of Salmonella phage P22 recognizes a 17 base pair operator. We constructed an Mnt binding site with two symmetric operator-constitutive mutations. We then selected Mnt mutants that have lost the ability to bind the wild-type operator but acquired the ability to bind the mutant operator. Four independent mutations change the same CAC codon in the mnt gene to CCT or CCC. The corresponding amino acid change in Mnt is His6 leads to Pro. DNA binding assays with purified wild-type and mutant proteins confirm the change of binding specificity in vitro. Wild-type Mnt binds strongly to the wild-type operator, but binds the mutant operator with 1000-fold less affinity. The mutant Mnt binds with converse affinities to the two operators."
https://openalex.org/W2023779693,"We have developed a chloroplast in vitro transcription system capable of transcribing tRNA genes (trn) from the spinach and Euglena gracilis chloroplast genomes. The RNA polymerase contained in the chloroplast extract transcribes the spinach chloroplast trnM2, trnV1, and trnl1 loci and the trnV1-trnN1-trnRl-trnL1 cluster in the EcoG fragment of the Euglena chloroplast genome. Restriction enzyme modified templates were used to demonstrate that the tRNA genes are transcribed in vitro. RNA fingerprint analysis confirmed that tRNAmMet, tRNA1Ile and tRNALeu are correctly processed transcripts from the spinach chloroplast trnM2, trnll, and Euglena trnL1 loci respectively. CCAOH is added to the mature tRNAs in vitro by a 3′ nucleotidyl transferase present in the chloroplast extract. Deletion mutants were constructed from the trnM2 locus to evaluate the role of 5′ flanking sequences in transcription initiation and processing. DNA sequences between positions −56 to −85 upstream of the trnM2 locus are required for maximal transcription of tRNAmMet, but are not essential for processing. The RNA polymerase involved in chloroplast trn transcription is distinguishable from the RNA polymerase isolated as a DNA-protein complex from spinach chloroplast that is active in rRNA transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2044798101,"Fragments of the recently cloned human gene for the beta subunit of nerve growth factor (beta-NGF) were used as hybridization probes in analyzing two sets of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids for the presence of human beta-NGF sequences. Results from the first set of hybrids assigned the human beta-NGF gene to chromosome 1 and ruled out the presence of sequences of comparable homology on any other chromosome. With the second set of hybrids, which contained seven different, but overlapping, regions of chromosome 1, the NGF locus was mapped to band 1p22."
https://openalex.org/W2002763210,"Antisera to human syncytiotrophoblast microvillous cell surface membranes from different placentas are cytotoxic for lymphocytes from some people but not others, demonstrating the presence of allotypic trophoblast-lymphocyte cross-reactive (TLX) antigens. Exploratory principal components factor analysis, performed on limited data consisting of 300 cytotoxic reactions produced by ten separate trophoblast antisera on a panel of lymphocytes from 30 random donors, suggested the presence of three distinct TLX antigen groupings. It is proposed that such TLX alloantigens are central in establishing maternal recognition and protection of the blastocyst, and that lack of recognition results in implantation failure and spontaneous abortion. These findings are compatible with contemporary results of immunotherapy to prevent recurrent spontaneous abortions, and their implications extend to other conditions of allogeneic coexistence, such as organ transplantation and the tumor-host relationship."
https://openalex.org/W1592566788,"Haloenol lactones can act as enzyme-activated irreversible inhibitors for alpha-chymotrypsin: acyl transfer to the active site serine releases a halomethyl ketone that remains tethered in the active site during the lifetime of the acyl enzyme, poised to alkylate an accessible nucleophilic residue. To investigate the structural determinants for chymotrypsin suicide inactivation with haloenol lactones, we prepared a series of nine lactones, differing in ring size (6-membered valerolactones and 5-membered butyrolactones) and in the nature of the aromatic substituent (phenyl and alpha-naphthyl), and the halogen (bromine and iodine). The inactivating behavior of these lactones is characterized by a binding constant (Ki) and three rate constants, for inactivation (k2), catalytic hydrolysis (kc), and spontaneous hydrolysis (kh). The six-membered valerolactones were much more potent inactivators than the butyrolactones, having both higher affinity and more rapid inactivation; the alpha-naphthyl-substituted lactones were also more effective, but the nature of the halogen had relatively little effect. The spontaneous rate of hydrolysis of all of these lactones is low. The turnovers per inactivation of these lactones vary from 91-1.7, with some of the alpha-naphthyl-substituted lactones approaching ideal behavior (stoichiometric inactivation). These studies indicate that several haloenol lactones are effective enzyme-activated irreversible inhibitors of chymotrypsin, and that their potency and efficiency depends markedly upon certain structural features of the lactone system."
https://openalex.org/W28622005,"Deglycosylation of bovine skin proteodermatan sulfate with chondroitinase ABC yielded a protein core with an apparent molecular weight of about 45,000. The amino acid sequence of this preparation was determined up to position 24. This region was enriched in acidic amino acids and proline compared with the whole protein core and it was predicted to be highly folded. The amino acid sequence determined in these experiments has a gap at position 4. Results obtained after beta-elimination-sulfite addition showed that residue 4 was an O-substituted hydroxyamino acid. The latter was identified as serine by sequencing the NH2-terminal region of the protein core (Mr approximately 43,000) isolated after a more complete deglycosylation of the proteoglycan with anhydrous HF. Serine 4 may be an attachment site for one of the few dermatan sulfate chains present in the proteoglycan."
https://openalex.org/W2085184588,"The pluripotential hematopoietic stem cell is influenced by at least one gene that differs between DBA/2 and C3H/He, and C57BL/6 inbred mouse strains. This gene(s) manifests itself by its effect on susceptibility to killing of spleen colony forming cells (CFU-S) caused by hydroxyurea (HU). In strains DBA/2 and C3H/He 20% of the CFU-S population is normally in S phase whereas practically none from strain C57BL/6 are synthesizing DNA. On the other hand, in C57BL/6 in equilibrium DBA/2 allophenic mice we observed that the proportion of DBA/2 erythrocytes was higher than the proportion of DBA/2 lymphocytes; the fraction of platelets and neutrophils with the DBA/2 genotype fell between the values for erythrocytes and lymphocytes. Control experiments using mice congenic at the Fv-2 locus confirm that in both situations we are examining effects of a gene(s) other than Fv-2. For the effect on the S phase fraction of CFU-S, we refer to the gene(s) as Stk (stem cell kinetics). We suggest that the observed skewing in composition among the various mature blood cell types in C57BL/6 in equilibrium DBA/2 allophenic mice is caused by allelic variants of the Stk gene. Such variation would favor the formation of DBA/2 erythrocytes, platelets, and neutrophils over those of the C57BL/6 genotype."
https://openalex.org/W1528395898,"The fatty acid synthetase of animal tissue consists of two subunits, each containing seven catalytic centers and an acyl carrier site. Proteolytic cleavage patterns indicate that the subunit is arranged into three major domains, I, II, and III. Domain I contains the NH2-terminal end of the polypeptide and the catalytic sites of beta-ketoacyl synthetase (condensing enzyme) and the acetyl-and malonyl-transacylases. This domain, therefore, functions as a site for acetyl and malonyl substrate entry into the process of fatty acid synthesis and acts in part as the site of carbon-carbon condensation, resulting in chain elongation. Domain II is the medial domain and contains the beta-ketoacyl and enoyl reductases, probably the dehydratase, and the 4'-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group of the acyl carrier protein site. Domain II, therefore, is designated as the reduction domain where the keto carbon is reduced to methylene carbon by sequential processes of reduction, dehydration, and reduction again. Throughout these processes, the acyl group is attached to the pantetheine-SH of the acyl carrier protein. The latter site is distal to the cysteine-SH of the beta-ketoacyl synthetase, constitutes the 15000-dalton polypeptide at the COOH-terminal end of Domain II, and connects to Domain III. When the growing chain reaches C16 carbon length, the fatty acyl group is released by the thioesterase activity, which is contained in Domain III. A functional model is proposed based on the aforementioned results and the recent evidence that the synthetase subunits are arranged in a head-to-tail fashion, such that the pantetheine-SH of the acyl carrier protein of one subunit and the cysteine-SH of the beta-ketoacyl synthetase of the second subunit are juxtaposed. In this model, a palmitate synthesizing site contains Domain I of one subunit and Domains II and III of the second subunit. Therefore, even though each subunit contains all of the partial activities of the reaction sequence, the actual palmitate synthesizing unit consists of one-half of a subunit interacting with the complementary half of the other subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1521546861,"Mitochondrial monoamine oxidase was inactivated with 2-[2-14C]phenylcyclopropylamine, dialyzed, and treated with acidic 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine. Contrary to the report of Paech et al. (Paech, C., Salach, J. I., and Singer, T. P. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 2700-2704), the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone obtained was not that of 2-phenylcyclopropanone, but rather of cinnamaldehyde. Furthermore, denaturation of the labeled enzyme in the presence of sodium borohydride resulted in retention of 5.6 times more radioactivity than in its absence. Based on these results, a mechanism of inactivation of monoamine oxidase by 2-phenylcyclopropylamine and the structure of the enzyme-inactivator adduct are proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1576632289,"Cultured porcine kidney cells (LLC-PK1) form polarized epithelia that transport glucose from apical to basal surface as in the renal proximal tube. The ability of these cells to transport glucose is known to increase as the epithelium forms and matures in culture. We find that epithelia grown in medium containing 25 mM glucose have reduced hexose transport compared to epithelia grown in 5 mM glucose. This difference is not the result of differences in seeding efficiency and can be reversed by changing the concentration of glucose in the growth medium. Increased transport in epithelia grown in 5 mM glucose is the result of increased influx on the sodium-coupled apical membrane transporter rather than changes in efflux. This difference is apparently the result of more apical membrane transporters in epithelia grown in 5 mM glucose. The number of high affinity phlorizin-binding sites is greater in epithelia grown in 5 mM glucose (about 0.8 pmol/10(6) cells) than in 25 mM glucose (about 0.25 pmol/10(6) cells). The increase in the number of glucose transporters induced by the low glucose medium is specific in that there is not a comparable change in activity of marker enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatase, or glucose 6-phosphatase). The nature of the intracellular signal elicited by extracellular glucose remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1495497204,"Two recombinant human leukocyte interferons (A and D), five hybrid interferons containing varying portions of A and D, and one fibroblast recombinant interferon were tested over a wide range of concentrations for their ability to modulate cytolytic activity of human natural killer (NK) cells. All of the interferons tested were purified to homogeneity. Although all the interferons were active, there were significant quantitative differences in their ability to augment cytolysis and the rank order of potency was reproducible among donors. The various recombinant interferons were also tested for their ability to augment mouse NK activity and the parental D and the A/D hybrids exhibited significant augmentation of cytolysis, which was consistent with their interspecies reactivity in viral neutralization assays. There generally was a direct correlation between antiviral activity and the ability of interferon to augment mouse NK activity; however, this correlation was not evident when tested on human cells. The study of these hybrids led to the identification of two molecules (A/D Bgl and A/D Pvu) which are very active in augmenting mouse NK activity. In addition, considerable insight has been obtained regarding the structure-function relationship of these leukocyte interferons and their ability to boost murine NK. This biological activity was associated with the COOH-terminal portion of the D interferon."
https://openalex.org/W1568429864,"Rabbit myocardial lysophospholipase-transacylase was purified 69,000-fold to near homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-Sephacel, hydroxylapatite chromatography, and high precision liquid chromatography. The purified protein was a single band (Mr = 63,000) after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining. It had a specific activity of 4 mumol/mg/min for fatty acid release and 2 mumol/mg/min for phosphatidylcholine synthesis. Both its hydrolase and transacylase activities were saturated at a lysophosphatidylcholine concentration of 20 microM and transacylation was prominent at submicellar concentrations of substrate (2 microM). Fatty acid release obeyed Michaelian kinetics, but Line-weaver-Burk plots of transacylase activity were parabolic. In contrast, plots of the reciprocal of the initial reaction velocity of phosphatidylcholine formation (1/V) versus 1/[S]2 were linear. Computer simulations of a reaction mechanism in which two molecules of substrate formed a ternary complex with the enzyme resulted in linear Lineweaver-Burk plots for fatty acid release and linear 1/V versus 1/[S]2 plots for phosphatidylcholine synthesis. Low concentrations of long chain acylcarnitine (5-20 microM) markedly inhibited both fatty acid release and phosphatidylcholine synthesis. Inhibition of lysophospholipase-transacylase by L-palmitoylcarnitine was reversible by dilution or dialysis. Since long chain acylcarnitines increase in the cytosolic compartment of ischemic myocardium, these results suggest that inhibition of lysophospholipase-transacylase by long chain acylcarnitines contributes to the accumulation of lysophosphoglycerides in ischemic myocardium with consequent deleterious effects on membrane function."
https://openalex.org/W1536057757,"The complete sequence of 595 amino acids of the alpha-I domain of human erythrocyte spectrin has been determined. Peptides derived from three different protease cleavages were purified using high performance liquid chromatography and subjected to automated amino acid sequence analysis. These data along with sequences of the cyanogen bromide and large tryptic peptides (Speicher, D.W., Davis, G., Yurchenco, P.D., and Marchesi, V.T. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 14931-14937) represent most or all of the sequence of spectrin alpha-I. The single remaining ambiguity is the precise termination of the COOH terminus of the alpha-I domain. The sequence data suggest that the 595 residues presented here represent the complete sequence of the alpha-I domain, but the apparent size of the COOH-terminal CNBr fragment suggests the existence of an additional 38 residues at the end of the domain. The sequence of the alpha-I domain contains a single type of internal homology composed of multiple 106-amino acid repeats consistent with the occurrence of multiple gene duplications during the course of spectrin evolution. The only portion of the alpha-I sequence which does not appear to contain this sequence repeat is the segment containing the NH2-terminal 17 residues. This unique segment may be part of the oligomer binding site. No disulfide bonds appear to be involved in the structure of alpha-I and cysteine is not highly conserved. Calculations of secondary structure suggest the presence of short helices which fold into triple helical segments approximately 50 A in length. There is little beta sheet structure. A model of spectrin structure incorporating the repeat unit and proposed secondary structure is presented. A computer search of alpha-I sequence with the National Biomedical Research Foundation database of 2145 protein sequences did not detect any significant relationships. Spectrin is apparently the first member of a new class of proteins to be structurally characterized."
https://openalex.org/W1553883441,"WRK-1 rat mammary tumor cells respond to vasopressin with an increase in the rate of phosphatidylinositol turnover. Evidence derived from a series of experiments performed under various prelabeling conditions suggests that the hormone-sensitive phosphatidylinositol resides in a distinct pool within the cell, accounting for approximately 17% (8-37%) of the total cellular phosphatidylinositol. The possibility that two distinct cell types might explain this finding is unlikely since neither newly cloned nor thymidine-blocked cells exhibit any alteration in the nature of their response. This hormone-sensitive phosphatidylinositol moiety has the following characteristics. 1) Under equilibrium labeling conditions, it is completely turned over within 5 min of hormone addition. 2) It is both synthesized and degraded even in the absence of hormone, although at a much slower rate. 3) Under the conditions employed, there does not appear to be transfer of phosphatidylinositol from the insensitive to the sensitive pool. A model of these events is outlined."
https://openalex.org/W1592354393,"In attempting to describe a halide-binding site in halorhodopsin (P580), a light-driven chloride pump in halobacterial membranes, we have investigated the effects of chloride and bromide on flash-induced absorption changes in this pigment, and studied the effects of a diuretic drug, MK-473, on the photochemistry and the transport. We find that at high sulfate or phosphate concentrations, but in the absence of halide, the principal photointermediate is P660, whose half-life is about 1.5 ms. When chloride or bromide are added, the production of P660 is depressed and its half-life becomes longer (up to approximately 10 ms). With increasing halide concentration, the cycle proceeds more and more via the alternative photointermediate, P520, whose half-life varies with the halide concentration in a fashion similar to that of P660. Transport activity, measured during sustained illumination, increases in a manner parallel to the accumulation of P520 up to about 400 mM halide, but declines at concentrations above this value. The transport is inhibited by MK-473 with competitive kinetics, and the effects of this inhibitor on the photocycle are also consistent with displacement of halide ions from their binding site. The observations reported here suggest that chloride and bromide bind to P580, P660, and P520, and that this binding is to a distinct site on the protein."
https://openalex.org/W2093688251,"The intestinal epithelial cell brush border (BB) is a useful model for nonmuscle cell motility. We studied regulation of BB motility by analyzing myosin phosphorylation and its association with the cytoskeleton. Our results demonstrate that myosin associates with the cytoskeleton only when it is dephosphorylated. Myosin light chain kinase substrates release myosin, phosphorylated and in the form of filaments, from the cytoskeleton. Although ITP and GTP serve as myosin ATPase substrates, they do not cause BB contraction, myosin release, or phosphorylation. Brush border contraction occurs with ATP or with a mixture of ITP and ATPγS. Therefore, phosphorylation regulates myosin association with the cytoskeleton, myosin is not bound at the actin-myosin binding site, and when phosphorylated, myosin forms filaments for movement."
https://openalex.org/W1538965311,"Chicken fatty acid synthetase is cleaved by alpha-chymotrypsin into two fragments of molecular weight 230,000 and 33,000. These fragments may be easily separated by ammonium sulfate fractionation and gel filtration to yield pure preparations. The large 230,000-Da fragment contains all of the core activities of the fatty acid synthetic sequence i.e. acetyl and malonyl transacylases, condensing enzyme, beta-ketoacyl and enoyl reductases, the dehydratase, and the acyl carrier protein. The smaller 33,000-Da fragment retains the thioesterase activity which catalyzes the release of the completed acyl chains from the complex. Antibodies against the purified thioesterase fragment cross-react with analogous (Mr 33,000) peptides released from the complex by other proteases, as well as with all proteolytic intermediates that were predicted by peptide mapping to contain the thioesterase segment (Mattick, J. S., Tsukamoto, Y., Nickless, J., and Wakil, S. J. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 15291-15299). Amino acid sequence analyses demonstrate that the thioesterase domain is located at the carboxyl terminus of the synthetase monomer, thereby orienting the proteolytic (and functional) sites within the complex with respect to the direction of transcription and translation."
https://openalex.org/W1514158379,"The alpha-I domain of human erythrocyte spectrin was produced by a mild tryptic digestion of the intact molecule and purified by a single step affinity chromatography procedure using a monoclonal antibody. A tryptic peptide representing the alpha-I domain, which migrated on polyacrylamide gels as an 80,000-dalton peptide, was subjected to automated Edman-Begg degradation. Products from automated sequencing were identified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Two smaller proteolytic products of the alpha-I domain (T74 and T50) were also subjected to automated sequence analysis. CNBr cleavage of the alpha-I domain produced nine unique peptides which were separated by gel filtration on a high performance liquid chromatograph. Peptides were further purified by reverse-phase chromatography and characterized by amino acid analysis. Partial sequences were determined by automated NH2-terminal sequence analysis. A single aspartate-proline bond, which was partially hydrolyzed during the cyanogen bromide cleavage reaction, was also identified. These sequence data include the first 86 residues of the alpha-I domain, and the spectrin oligomer binding site has been tentatively localized within the first 39 residues. The sequence of 293 residues of a total 633 residues in the alpha-I domain is presented and represents the first structural information for this protein."
https://openalex.org/W1499001151,"Purification of human mitochondrial creatine kinase has been difficult and procedures that were highly successful in purifying canine enzyme failed for human mitochondrial creatine kinase. In the present study, we employed ultracentrifugation to remove the lipid, urea to prevent aggregation, followed by a final step of chromatofocusing which yielded a preparation of human mitochondrial creatine kinase with a specific enzyme activity of greater than 400 IU/mg. Biochemical and immunological characterization showed the preparation to be highly pure and free of even trace amounts of other creatine kinase isoenzymes. Antiserum specific for mitochondrial creatine kinase was developed which exhibited no cross-reactivity to cytosolic creatine kinase and mitochondrial creatine kinase did not cross-react with antiserum to the cytosolic forms. Marked differences were noted, both biochemically and immunologically, between mitochondrial creatine kinase and the cytosolic forms. Human mitochondrial creatine kinase was shown to have a molecular weight of around 82,000 and to be composed of two subunits of equal molecular weights around 41,000. Aggregates of mitochondrial creatine kinase were observed with molecular weights of around 200,000 in the absence of urea or if isolated from material after having undergone proteolysis. Isolation from fresh material or in the presence of urea inhibited aggregate formation for both canine and human mitochondrial creatine kinase. Despite claims of several investigators that mitochondrial creatine kinase exhibits two to three forms with varying molecular weights, our data indicate a single enzyme form made up of a subunit with a molecular weight of 41,000 and the high molecular weight aggregates appear to be induced artifacts. A radioimmunoassay was developed for human mitochondrial creatine kinase which, with appropriate modifications, should detect mitochondrial creatine kinase in human plasma."
https://openalex.org/W1553339047,"Although the formation of bilirubin monoglucuronide by hepatic microsomes has been easily demonstrable, that of bilirubin diglucuronide, the principal conjugate of bile, has been more difficult. Therefore, an examination of the uridine diphosphate glucuronate-dependent microsomal formation of these two conjugates has been made utilizing a high performance liquid chromatographic method which quantitates the isomeric forms of the products. Initial studies indicated that at high starting bilirubin concentrations, only bilirubin monoglucuronide was formed; whereas at lower concentrations (approximately 15 microM), bilirubin diglucuronide could be formed efficiently, but only under very specific conditions. Untreated microsomes and microsomes treated with Triton X-100 did not differ; each formed monoglucuronide efficiently, yet formed diglucuronide poorly. Digitonin or UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pretreatment, in contrast, was found to facilitate bilirubin diglucuronide formation, the former much more than the latter. The activity of mannose 6-phosphatase, an enzyme located on the inner surface of the microsomal vesicles, did not correlate well with the bilirubin diglucuronide formation. Time course studies with digitonin and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine indicated a precursor-product relation between bilirubin monoglucuronide and bilirubin diglucuronide, and product isomer composition studies indicated that the bilirubin tetrapyrroles were stable (no random dipyrrolic exchange had occurred). Temperature studies with the digitonin-treated preparation demonstrated an increase in monoglucuronide-forming activity over the 0-25 degrees C range, whereas diglucuronide formation increased dramatically over the range from 25 to 35 degrees C. The results indicate that microsomal diglucuronide-forming activity differs characteristically from monoglucuronide-forming activity, and that it is intensely sensitive to the manipulation of its microsomal membrane environment."
https://openalex.org/W1603636427,"The metabolism of 3RS-[2RS-3H]mevalonate in the 10,000 x g supernatant fractions of homogenates of bovine retinas has been studied. Very efficient incorporation of the labeled mevalonate, approaching quantitative utilization of its 3R-isomer, into lipid products was observed. The extent of incorporation into saponifiable lipids was very substantial. Analysis of the labeled saponifiable lipids indicated that these lipids were composed almost exclusively of C15 and C20 isoprenoid acids. The major C15 acids corresponded chromatographically to trans,trans-farnesoic acid and cis,cis-farnesoic acid. The major C20 isoprenoid acids corresponded chromatographically to trans,trans,-trans-geranylgeranoic acid and an unidentified C20 isoprenoid acid containing at least one cis-double bond. Analyses of the nonsaponifiable lipids indicated the presence of labeled squalene, a C30 fraction containing lanosterol and/or 24,25-dihydrolanosterol, and a C27 fraction containing cholesterol, 5 alpha-cholest-7-en-3 beta-ol, 5 alpha-cholesta-8,24-dien-3 beta-ol, 5 alpha-cholesta-7,24-dien-3 beta-ol, and cholesta-5,24-dien-3 beta-ol. Trace components corresponding chromatographically to 5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-en-3 beta-ol and cholesta-5,7-dien-3 beta-ol were also detected."
https://openalex.org/W1587373400,"The present study provides strong evidence for the involvement of rat liver microsomal cytochrome b5 in the first reduction step of fatty acid chain elongation. The rate of reoxidation of NADH-reduced microsomal cytochrome b5 was markedly stimulated (up to 3-fold) by the addition of increasing concentrations of beta-ketohexadecanoyl-CoA (1-8 microM). A quantitative analysis of product formation, the effect of cyanide, and anaerobiosis completely exclude the possibility that desaturase activity accounted for the beta-ketohexadecanoyl-CoA-induced stimulation of the cytochrome b5 reoxidation rate. Using liver microsomes from untreated rats, the beta-keto substrate was found to stimulate the rate of reoxidation of cytochrome b5 by 30%. However, when liver microsomes from fat-free diet rats were employed the stimulation was more than 3-fold, suggesting that the beta-ketoacyl-CoA reductase is inducible by a high carbohydrate, fat-free diet. This study also provides evidence for the noninvolvement of cytochrome b5 in the terminal reaction step (second reduction step of chain elongation), which is catalyzed by the trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase. Although trans-2-hexadecenoyl-CoA significantly stimulated the NADH-reduced cytochrome b5 reoxidation rate under aerobic conditions, it did not have any stimulatory effect under anaerobic conditions. One interpretation of these results is that the trans-2-hexadecenoyl-CoA is substrate for the microsomal delta 9 desaturase system. Consistent with this conclusion was the fact that the trans-2-hexadecenoyl-CoA inhibited the liver microsomal delta 9 desaturation of stearoyl-CoA to oleoyl-CoA."
https://openalex.org/W1542354583,"The ability of different cytochromes P-450 from rabbit liver microsomes to bind cholesterol and to catalyze 7 alpha-hydroxylation of cholesterol was studied. Cytochromes P-450LM2 and P-450LM3b did not bind cholesterol and were inactive in cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylation. Cytochrome P-450LM4 from phenobarbital-treated rabbits as well as cytochromes P-450LM4 I and P-450LM4 II from cholestyramine-treated rabbits were able to bind cholesterol. Only cytochrome P-450LM4 II catalyzed 7 alpha-hydroxylation of cholesterol. Cytochrome P-450LM4 II also bound 5-cholestene-3 beta,-7 alpha-diol and 3 beta-hydroxy-5-cholesten-7-one. These compounds competitively inhibited binding of cholesterol. Cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylation was inhibited by its product 5-cholestene-3 beta,7 alpha-diol."
https://openalex.org/W1681060105,"The cyanogen bromide (CNBr) fragments of the two link proteins (LP) were examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The observed apparent molecular weight difference between LP1 (Mr = 44,500) and LP2 (Mr = 48,500) was the reflect of a molecular weight difference between their NH2-terminal CNBr fragments (Mr = 19,000 and 24,000 for LP1 and LP2, respectively). The latter are glycosylated contrary to the COOH-terminal parts of the molecules. Fluorhydric acid/pyridine treatment suggests that LP1 and LP2 have a protein core of identical size. They differ from their common tryptic fragment (T-G200-3 fraction) by the presence of an additional short peptide. The latter was highly glycosylated in LP2 but not in LP1. Deglycosylation together with CNBr treatment corroborates the hypothesis that LP1 and LP2 possess a similar protein core."
https://openalex.org/W1588792083,"Extracellular treatment of human erythrocytes with papain completely converted the chymotryptic 38,000-dalton fragment of Band 3 to the 29,000-dalton fragment and inhibited the transport of inorganic phosphate in the cells. The inhibition, however, was not complete, indicating the presence of two components in the anion-transport system: the one resistant to papain digestion and the other sensitive to the digestion. The latter activity is well correlated with the degradation of the 38,000-dalton fragment. The activity remaining in the cells treated with papain was markedly different from that of the control cells. The remaining activity was not inhibited by pyridoxal phosphate and dinitrostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, potent inhibitors to the anion transport, whereas phenyl phosphate inhibited the activities of both papain-treated and control cells. The results indicate that the anion-transport system consists of multiple anion-binding sites and a part of the system which is sensitive to pyridoxal phosphate and dinitrostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid was located in the papain-sensitive portion of 38,000-dalton fragment. A possible model of the anion-transport system was presented."
https://openalex.org/W1974786854,"Nonmalignant diploid human fibroblast cells (GM3498B) derived from a skin biopsy of a patient with Bloom's syndrome have been transformed by transfection with DNA from a tumorigenic mouse cell line (Ha-8) carrying a single copy of the Harvey murine sarcoma virus (Ha-MuSV) genome. The transformed cell lines have an extended life-span, form colonies in agarose, and proliferate in nude mice--characteristics of neoplastic transformation. Like the parental cells, they also exhibit a high spontaneous level of sister chromatid exchanges. Finally, the transformed cells contain most, if not all, of the Ha-MuSV genome as well as the human rasH sequence. These experiments show that these diploid nonmalignant human cells can be used as recipients in transfection experiments for studying the genetic control of neoplastic transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1590677545,"Abstract The 35 S percursor of the Neurospora mitochondrial large rRNA contains a 2.3-kilobase intron located towards its 3' end. The intron RNA is excised in a single cleavage-ligation reaction and is detectable in mitochondria by Northern hybridization experiments. We now show (i) that the free intron RNA is a full-length linear molecule, and (ii) that it, like the Tetrahymena nuclear rRNA intron, contains an extra, noncoded guanosine residue at its 5' end. The latter finding suggests that the Neurospora mitochondrial large rRNA may be spliced via a phosphoester transfer mechanism similar to that proposed for the self-splicing Tetrahymena intron."
https://openalex.org/W1592679953,"The present study determines the characteristics of isotopic Na and lactate exchange under equilibrium conditions in horse kidney brush-border membrane vesicles. The influence of one solute (Na+ or lactate) on the isotopic exchange of the co-transported species (lactate or Na) was analyzed in detail. Analysis of the data suggests that Na and lactate interact sequentially with the carrier. The observed apparent symmetry between the activating effect of low Na concentrations and the inhibiting effect of high Na concentrations on the lactate exchange process suggests that the carrier functions according to a glide symmetry model where the two solutes bind to the carrier according to an iso-ordered Bi Bi process. This conclusion is strengthened by the properties of the 22Na exchange process catalyzed by the lactate carrier. Direct measurement under equilibrium conditions of the coupled Na+/lactate transport indicated a stoichiometry of 2:1. These data, along with those obtained in a previous study (Mengual R., and Sudaka P. (1983) J. Membr. Biol. 71, 163-171) allow us to propose a mechanism for the Na+-lactate cotransport, involving a transport system that functions according to an iso-ordered Bi Bi process where binding and debinding of Na+ occur first, followed by the lactate molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1521529727,"Abstract The reactivity of the carboxyl groups of hemoglobin S to form amide bonds with glycine ethyl ester by carbodiimide-activated coupling, and the influence of this derivatization on the functional properties of the protein have been investigated. Incubation of carbonmonoxy or oxyhemoglobin S with 20 mM 1-ethyl-3-(3'-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide in the presence of 100 mM [14C]glycine ethyl ester, at pH 6.0 and 23 degrees C for 1 h resulted in the modification of, on an average, three carboxyl groups of the protein. The Hill coefficient of the modified hemoglobin S was 2.7, indicating normal subunit interactions. The derivatization increased the oxygen affinity of the molecule (the P50 was lowered from 8.0 to 5.0). The derivatization also resulted in an increase in the minimum gelling concentration of hemoglobin S from 16 to 24 g/100 ml. The reaction conditions used for the derivatization of the carboxyl groups of hemoglobin S are very selective for the protein carboxyl groups; very little of the label is associated with the heme carboxyls. Tryptic peptide mapping of the modified hemoglobin S indicated that the peptide beta T5, i.e. the segment representing amino acid residues 41 to 59 of beta-chain, accounted for nearly 75% of the label associated with the globin, demonstrating the high selectivity of the derivatization. Sequence analysis of the derivatized beta T5 demonstrated that at least 65% of the label incorporated into hemoglobin S is targeted toward the carboxyl group of Glu-43(beta), identifying it as the most reactive carboxyl group in hemoglobins. The results suggest that modification of the carboxyl group of hemoglobins S, presumably the gamma-carboxyl of Glu-43(beta), reduces the propensity of deoxyhemoglobin S to polymerize."
https://openalex.org/W1501135214,"The addition of ATP to turkey gizzard myosin causes an enhancement of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. The level of fluorescence enhancement is determined by the myosin conformation. The transition of myosin from the folded (10 S) state to the extended (6 S) state is accompanied by a decrease in the fluorescence level. Phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of myosin does not directly influence fluorescence and will induce changes only if the myosin conformation is altered. Under the appropriate conditions, phosphorylation of myosin favors the transition of 10 S to 6 S. The phosphorylation dependence of the associated fluorescence decrease is not linear, and it is proposed that the phosphorylation of both light chains is required for the full transition. The tryptophan residues involved respond to the binding of ATP at the hydrolytic sites. Since the fluorescence properties of gizzard myosin are influenced by the myosin conformation, it is reasonable to assume that the active sites are also modified by the shape of the myosin molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1552482999,"In fall and winter, the liver of the winter flounder produces large amounts of alanine-rich (60 mol %) antifreeze proteins for export to the circulation. We have examined the tRNA in the liver to see if the seasonal production of antifreeze protein is accompanied by changes in tRNAAla isoacceptors. Total tRNA from the liver of winter fish showed an approximate 40% increase in alanine acceptor capacity over tRNA from summer fish. In contrast, the acceptor capacities for other amino acids showed no seasonal difference. When labeled alanyl-tRNAs were separated by reverse phase chromatography-5 chromatography, a large proportion of the increase in alanine acceptor capacity was in one of three main peaks. Measurements of the optimum temperatures for various flounder amino-acyl-tRNA synthetases suggest that alanyl-tRNA synthetase functions best between 0 and 5 degrees C, which is the sea water temperature when antifreeze protein synthesis occurs, while prolyl- and valyl-tRNA synthetases are most active between 20 and 30 degrees C. These differences in temperature optima and the seasonal variation in tRNAAla levels and isoaccepting species may both serve to optimize antifreeze protein production by increasing the translational efficiency of its mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1563732229,"A new microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH2) has been identified and characterized. This enzyme has properties which distinguish it from previously described cytosolic (cEH) or membrane-bound (mEH1) epoxide hydrolases. The enzyme is an integral microsomal protein which is not dissociated from the membrane by repeated washing, high ionic strength salt, or chaotropic agent solutions, or by sonication. It is very different from the normally described microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH1) as shown by its different substrate specificity and kinetic properties and by immunological criteria. In contrast to the hitherto described microsomal epoxide hydrolase, mEH1, the new enzyme effectively catalyzes the hydration of transdisubstituted oxiranes such as trans-stilbene oxide and trans-beta-ethyl styrene oxide and has no appreciable activity toward benzo(a)pyrene 4,5-oxide. It is also structurally distinct, in that it does not cross-react with antibodies raised against the normally described microsomal epoxide hydrolase mEH1. This newly described microsomal epoxide hydrolase probably represents an important factor in the control of reactive epoxides; its location in the membrane ensures access to lipophilic epoxides generated by membrane-bound monooxygenases, and its substrate specificity is such that it can hydrolyze epoxides poorly metabolized by the previously described microsomal epoxide hydrolase."
https://openalex.org/W1509281594,"ATP-supported but not Site I or Site II respiratory chain-linked 45Ca2+ transport into isolated rat liver mitochondria is profoundly inhibited by a small molecule present in the cytosolic fraction. This inhibitor was purified and shown to be identical with ascorbic acid in a number of chemical properties, cytosolic abundance, susceptibility to ascorbate oxidase, and to agents that otherwise block the effect of authentic ascorbic acid. Experiments with a variety of free radical scavengers and glutathione indicated that ascorbate inhibition of calcium transport is mediated through a 1-electron-free radical mechanism rather than a conventional 2-electron reaction. Calcium transport mechanisms may, therefore, be a target in the pathophysiology of disease processes that influence the intracellular ratios and levels of ascorbate and physiological radical scavengers."
https://openalex.org/W1521751540,"In an effort to assess the influence that crystallization may have on protein conformations, optical absorption spectra of crystalline state hemoglobin derivatives have been examined. These spectra were obtained from photoacoustic spectra using a computer-assisted analysis. Comparisons of crystal and solution state hemoglobins using crystal minus solution state difference spectra indicate that the conformations of these proteins are similar in both states. Crystallization does not change the absorption properties of horse oxyhemoglobin or the cyanide and azide adducts of horse and human methemoglobin. Spectra of crystalline methemoglobins, which are prepared by ligand exchange in the crystalline state, are identical to the spectra of the final crystalline state adduct prepared without ligand exchange. Further, the allosteric effector, inositol hexaphosphate, causes the same spectral changes in solution and crystalline state hemoglobins. However, differences between crystal and solution state spectra of both fluoride and aquo methemoglobin are observed. These differences suggest that small but perhaps functionally significant changes in the heme regions of these derivatives accompany crystallization."
https://openalex.org/W1573791518,"In an effort to examine the consequences of phase state changes on protein structures, optical absorption spectra of several bovine hemoglobin derivatives in lyophilized, ammonium sulfate-precipitated, and crystalline states were examined. Absorption spectra were used to compare protein conformations. Differences between solution and several solid state spectra were apparent. They were greatest for lyophilized preparations, were inhibited by ligand binding, the tightest binding ligand being the most effective inhibitor, and were substantially or totally reversible upon dissolving the solid state protein. Though the magnitude of spectral changes varied, they all indicated characteristically different proportions of the protein were converted to a reversible hemichrome in each type of solid state preparation. The extent of hemichrome formation was correlated with the degree to which the protein tends to be dehydrated in each solid state preparation. This may reflect the role of water in determining the three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin. Absorption spectra of solid state hemoglobin preparations were obtained from photoacoustic spectra using a novel method for spectral analysis. Results presented here demonstrate the utility of this procedure in probing structures of solid state proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1539320528,"We have developed a chemical procedure for determining the sidedness of the NH2 termini of sucrase-isomaltase complex in the small intestinal brush-border membrane. The methodology involves amidination of sealed right-side-out brush-border membrane vesicles with the impermeant imidoester 3-[dimethyl-2-[( 3H]acetimidoxyethyl)ammonio]propanesulfonate with subsequent quantitation of this reaction at the NH2 termini of sucrase-isomaltase. It was found that amidination yields were every similar for the reaction of 3-[dimethyl-2-[( 3H]acetimidoxyethyl)-ammonio] propanesulfonate with intact membrane vesicles and with leaky, deoxycholate-extracted membrane fragments. This demonstrates that the NH2 termini were equally accessible to the impermeant reagent in both systems and, hence, are exposed on the outside of the sealed membrane vesicles. The methodology developed does not involve proteolysis and should be of wide applicability."
https://openalex.org/W1605194700,"Abstract Static and dynamic light-scattering methods have been used to investigate the structure of chick limb bud chondrocyte proteoglycan aggregate in 0.4 M guanidinium chloride. Zimm plot data for proteoglycan aggregate yield a molecular weight of 45 +/- 8 X 10(6) which compares well with a value of approximately 43 X 10(6) obtained by combination of the diffusion and sedimentation data via the Svedberg equation. The molecular weight of the proteoglycan subunit was determined previously to be 1.4 +/- 0.3 X 10(6), which indicates that the average proteoglycan aggregate molecule contains 32 associated subunits. This is in good agreement with electron microscopy which suggests an average of approximately 25.5 subunits/aggregate; it can be concluded that the aggregates visualized by electron microscopy are also present in solution. These data are also compatible with the ratio of the hydrodynamic volumes of proteoglycan aggregate and subunit. The formation of the aggregate structure has little effect on the solvent-binding capacity of the components: both proteoglycan aggregate and subunit have expanded coil conformations that include approximately 99% solvent."
